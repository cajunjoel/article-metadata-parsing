By BRYAN and ANNE PECK (Cheltenham)
Very little has appeared to date in avicultural literature on the ten
species of Spiderhunters which make up the genus Arachnothera. Gener-
ally grouped with the Sunbirds in the family Nectariniidae, they do,
however, differ in several respects from the true Sunbirds by lacking
metallic coloured areas of plumage in the male, having no noticeable
dimorphism between the sexes (in most cases) and the different, often
unique nest structure, characteristics which would make them strong
candidates for family status in their own right. Their distribution is
throughout South-east Asia and some of the Indonesian and Philippine
islands.
Classification of species within the genus depends on the author.
Gruson (1976) lists them in alphabetical order but for the purpose of
this article, which concerns avicultural experiences, the order of sequence
is based on diet, display and behaviour. It must be noted, however, that
some species have yet to become available to the aviculturist. An asterisk

A. chrysogenys and A. flavigaster are commonly called the Lesser
Yellow-eared and Greater Yellow-eared Spiderhunters respectively by
aviculturists but as this tends to indicate a close relationship, we have
used Yellow-eared and Spectacled as, apart from the visual, there are no
close ties.

Importation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9609795" page_id="58079968"  page_num="2" year="" vol="">
Before quarantine, Spiderhunters were imported into Britain in large
numbers, most of which arrived in very bad condition. The main problems
were two-fold - bad feet and Candida fungus in the mouth regions. These
days, only one importer brings them into Britain with any regularity and
those that have been released from quarantine have mostly been in superb
condition, although a few have had poor feet, due mainly to the way in
which they were trapped. Fungus is now a problem of the past as it can
easily be treated with Nystan lightly dabbed on the infected areas twice a
day. Diet, which is dicusssed next, and seclusion are the main priorities
with newly imported birds. All but two species have been imported since
quarantine restrictions were imposed, and of these the Grey-breasted and
Spectacled are the most numerous.
Diet
In captivity the bulk of the diet must be made up of a good quality
nectar mix. There are many such mixtures that can be used and the follow-
ing has proved very successful with us over the last few years:-
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.7659155">
50 gr. white sugar
5 mgr. activated dried yeast
5 mgr. plant pollen
These ingredients are made into a paste and diluted with 500 ml of
boiling water and allowed to cool. The following are then added.
20 mgr. spoon of Minamino
2Vi mgr. Becosym "B" group structure
2Vi mgr. fresh minced beef
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.9975025" page_id="58079968"  page_num="2" year="" vol="">
It has been found that Spiderhunters make better use of their nectar
if fed from an open dish on the floor of the cage rather than fed from
the more conventional type of water hopper. We use a 3 inch diameter
earthenware dish as it is a good size for one bird's food and the fruit and
cake, fed with the nectar, can easily be picked out. Fruit, which is added
to the nectar, must be finely dried. A variety is accepted including

apple, grape, banana, tomato, and elderberries and red and black currants
when in season. Carrot is also taken. It must be diced very small for the
smaller members, but can be V 4 inch cubes for the larger species. We have
experimented with an electric blender to combine fruit and nectar but
this makes it into a paste which our Spiderhunters will not take. We also
feed separately brown bread and milk sweetened with a little sugar.
A fine grade softfood can also be offered but with what is already
provided, it should not be needed but does provide variety if taken. The
addition of a mineral supplement such as SA37 or Stress will provide
most of the extra minerals and Adexolin will do the same with the vita-
mins. Both are best added to the nectar rather than the bread and milk.
Extra calcium can be provided in the form of cuttlefish "bone", scraped
to a powder and sprinkled over the nectar. We also add Orlusc insectile
mix and dried insects on alternate days with the fruit.
Insects are essential for longevity and must be as varied as possible
and take the form of blowflies, fruit flies, spiders, crickets, first and
second instar locusts, small moths and butterflies; in fact, any soft bodied
insect that is available. Some types must be persevered with even though
the birds may take some time before they become accustomed to them.
The first Spiderhunter I kept in the 1960's was A chrysogenys and he
was fed about 20 Wolf Spiders daily. He lived for five years, eventually
dying from a form of stroke. Now, 15 years later, I rarely feed spiders,
preferring crickets and first and second instar locusts. One or two a month
are given per bird and then only as a tid-bit. We find this is ample and
there is little doubt that they could do without spiders altogether - but
we find that it has become a habit of ours while in the garden to catch
any spiders seen.
Housing
With a group of birds that have not been bred in captivity, how to
house them for optimum success is purely speculative. It is known that
they can be kept for periods of five years or so in both cage and aviary.
Cages are most important during the first year of captive life as they
enable birds to be acclimatised and fully established. They should be of
the box type, at least a metre long by half a metre high, with depth the
same. Perching is most important as Spiderhunters are hygiene conscious
wiping their beaks on the perch to remove food that has adhered to the
beak after each feed. Therefore, two sets are kept and changed daily.
Perches should be of soft wood or natural twigs. We prefer soft wood
dowl, redwood, spruce, deal or birch. Soft wood holds its moisture for
longer periods; natural twigs dry out very quickly. Apple, pear and
elder can become hard in a matter of weeks, whereas soft wood can be

soaked when dry. It has been found that soft wood leads to fewer foot
troubles.
A box type cage will decrease the initial stress period because the
bird can find seclusion and should settle quickly if not disturbed more
than necessary. Needless to say, only one bird per cage cuts out com-
petition for food and roosting positions. This type of accommodation
is also important if specimens need medication.
After the first moult, an aviary is more in line with today's thoughts
and a small tropical house to one pair of Spiderhunters would be ideal.
An outside flight could be utilised during summer months and readers
are requested to refer to Mr. R. Elgar's notes on Humming Bird manage-
ment in a previous issue of this Magazine (Volume 88, No. 4) as the sugges-
tions put forward by him can be applied equally to Spiderhunters.
Spiderhunters, as stated previously, have not bred in captivity and
for them to have a chance, the provision of large-leaved plants is essen-
tial. The nest structure of various species is divided into three types:
open cup suspended from a leaf; two leaves stitched together; and a
tunnel type nest stitched to the underside of a leaf. Material for con-
struction must be as varied as possible but the availability of masses of
cobwebs is important as without this a nest will doubtfully progress
very far.
The species of plants able to support this type of nest that are
available to the aviculturist are limited but three which are available
and can be tried are the Cheese Plant, Rubber Plant and Banana. The
latter plays host to nests of some species in the wild and the provision
of several of the dwarf varieties would perhaps give the best chance of
success. The related Sunbirds have been known to accept an artificial
structure, usually a box, so the provision of an artificial nest, a long
wicker tunnel supported beneath a large leaf, may coax them into nest-
ing. Such a tunnel would probably have to be home made.
All the large Spiderhunters have parts of the day which are filled
with high activity. This does not seem to be so with A. longirostris and
A. crassirostris.
Little Spiderhunter Arachnothem longirostris
Range: India to South West China, south to the Philippines, west to
Malaya and most of the islands within this rectangle. Twelve subspecies
are recognised.
Habitat: Reputed to be a common species inhabiting secondary forest
growth, cultivated gardens and areas where wild bananas grow, and is said
to play an important part in their pollination.

slate grey tinged with green; tail lighter tipped with off-white. Upper
breast and throat grey-white, belly and undertail coverts yellow. Eyebrow
stripe grey, white below. Bill dark blue grey (blackish), the lower mandible
lighter. Eye dark brown. Feet blue grey. Both sexes have pectoral tufts
which are only visible when roosting or in the male when displaying. Those
of the male are orange-yellow and females are yellow. Adults lose all
yellow and green in captivity, except for pectoral tufts which become
lighter. Differs from A. crassirostris by feet, facial markings and thinner
bill. Immatures have a paler eye stripe and throat tinged yellowish olive.
Comments: Having owned the nominate race and several of the sub-
species, there is very little between them. Like the Thick-billed Spider-
hunter, it is difficult to establish, mainly because both are very insecti-
vorous, and not nearly so inquisitive as larger members of the genus. There
is some difference in the size of birds imported from different areas, but
most are heavier than crassirostris.
They travel badly, with very few living long in captivity and generally
are not nearly as robust as the larger Arachnothera. Insects, especially fruit
flies, are vital and in this respect they are like the Asiatic Sunbirds. With
a great deal of patience they can be induced to take large spiders, crickets
and first and second instar locusts.
The moult seems to take a greater toll on A. longirostris due mainly to
the fact that they are reluctant to sample more diverse food. It is also a
species of a nervous disposition- we have had a female for three years that
is still quite flighty, which would indicate strong flight reflexes.
A. longirostris in general is an early rooster and also very selective about
the roosting perch. They have the ability to hover in the manner of some
sunbirds. They can be kept in small groups, the pair bond apparently being
very strong in this species.
The Little Spiderhunter has a peculiar bathing routine: it enters the
water backwards, washing its tail and vent first. I have heard of other birds
bathing in this way but never witnessed it before. All individuals of this
species that we have owned have bathed in an identical way.
Thick-billed Spiderhunter Arachnothera crassirostris
Range: Southern Thailand, Malaysia, Sumatra and Borneo. No sub-
species.
Habitat: A rare species of lowland forests and secondary growth up to
4,000 feet.
Description: Size 6 V 2 inches. One of the smallest species in overall length
and certainly the lightest in body weight. Crown, nape, back, wings and
tail dark grey; tail tipped as in longirostris. Upper tail and belly light yellow,
upper breast and throat grey. Eyebrow light grey with the dark grey eye

stripe stretching to nape. Most field guides indicate that pectoral tufts are
present only in the male, but we believe this to be incorrect as birds that
we have owned have displayed to each other and on roosting both exhibi-
ted pectoral tufts which, when held in the hand, are difficult to find. Bill
brown with dark flesh coloured feet.
Comments: One of the most delicate of the genus to establish and even
then they require special foods and much attention. Establishing is made
all the more difficult because of their shyness and very few learn to take
food from the hand. Time is a strong factor as most die within 18 months
of importation, usually from heart, liver or blood disorders. Post mortem
examinations of dead birds reveal liver and heart discoloration, due we
think to a greatly over-rich diet. Once tame they should be induced to a
diet of more fruit and less of a sugar diet. We have had several but they
seldom live more than two years.
This species is seldom imported because of its rare status in the whole
of its range. It does not stand the inclement weather of Britain very well
and if housed outside, quarters should be heated to around 55*F at night.
One egg laid on floor of cage was small in size - 10 mm - and was white,
lightly speckled with mauve at the blunt end.
Naked-faced Spiderhunter Arachnothera clarae
Range: Philippines and its many islands.
Habitat: A bird of lowland jungle and ravines near water.
Description: Crown, nape and upperparts, including tail and secon-
daries, olive-brown; primaries old gold; feet flesh coloured with scales
edged brown; toe nails dark; eye brown; bill black; naked skin on both
sides of face below eye. Breast grey, but feathers give a two-tone effect as
one side of breast feathers is a darker grey. No pectoral tufts, but distinct
gold shoulder patches which could be a sex difference. These are a distinc-
tive field character. Dupont describes the body colour as green, but the
subspecies we own, Ac. luzonensis, is as above.
Comments: Hardy in cool temperatures but would not stand our win-
ter conditions. Very tame even when first imported and mixes well with
other birds although it will not tolerate other spiderhunters. Has a great
liking for newly-hatched stick insects and spiders.

Head study of Arachnothera chrysogenys, showing eye ring and ear patch
patch (not connected). Yellowish on the throat; forehead streaked; bill
brown, lighter below; eye light brown; feet flesh coloured. Immature are
duller and lacking streaked forehead; some have reduced ear patch and eye
ring or it is lacking completely.
Comments: This species is not over-aggressive when two or more are
kept together, but must be watched as they can at times turn spiteful.
When they do fight, they tend to strike for the eyes and head region.
Insectivorous, especially spiders of all sizes, even very large garden spi-
ders. Will tame very quickly if tempted with spiders; all those we have
kept have done so.
Grey-breasted Spiderhunter Arachnothera affinis
Range: Thailand, Malaya through to the Greater Sunda Islands.
Habitat: Forest secondary growth near flowering banana. Locally
common over most of its range up to 3,500 ft.
Description: Upperparts olive-green with darker streaks on throat and
forehead. Olive-grey beneath becoming much paler at vent and underside
of tail. Primaries and tail dark grey with tail bands occasionally present.
Pectoral tufts are light in colour although some carry more yellow than
others. Bill brown but tip and underside a lighter shade; feet pink tinged
and eye colour varies from light to dark brown. Length 7 in (18 cm) but
the Malay raceAtf. modesta is smaller.
Comments: Not aggressive and can be kept in small groups. Although
two males will occasionally "sham up" to each other, it rarely develops

quisitive as other members of this group, it is more insectivorous than
the larger species, taking flies, spiders, crickets and first instar locusts but
it has trouble with larger insects. Nest not described, but in captivity has
built in a finch nest-box. Often misnamed by dealers as it can be mis-
taken for A. robusta and A. everetti.
Long-billed Spiderhunter Arachnothera robusta
Range: Sumatra, Borneo, Malaya and Thailand.
Habitat: Forest secondary growth up to 4,500 ft.
Description:Olive green on back, wings and tail; breast and belly
lighter, lightly streaked and tinged yellow on centre of breast and belly.
Very small area of naked skin around eye; beak dark brown, horn-
coloured underneath, about 10 mm thick at base and 50 mm in length.
Wing shoulders bright yellow. Each tail feather is tipped with a white spot
giving the impression of a band. Pectoral tufts are yellow in the hen and
orange in the male. Length approximately SVi in (21.5 cm).
Comments: Very aggressive and difficult to keep two together. Both
sexes show pectoral tufts when displaying and when roosting. Once estab-
lished, quite easy to keep, accepting the diet offered to the larger species
but probably the least insectivorous of the genus imported. Very vocal, a
short note often repeated for long periods. Bathes regularly and tames
quickly.
Streaked Spiderhunter Arachnothera magna
Range: Himalayas, China, India, Burma, Malaya, Thailand and Laos.
Breeds between 1800 and 4500 ft in India.
Habitat: Forest, secondary growth and clearings, especially near wild
banana.
Description: Length 6 V 2 -IV 2 in (16.5-19 cm). Yellow olive, streaked
black, finely on throat but getting larger on breast, back and head. Tail
and wings brownish green. Bill black; feet vary from orange to yellow and
eyes from black to brown.
Comments: When birds were imported from India they were quite
numerous but few have been imported recently. Suffers badly with its
feet when first imported. The birds we have owned of this species that
were of Indian origin seemed to mix quite well together but those from
Malaya were quite aggressive.
Very easy to feed, even when first imported and will take most insects
plus most forms of conventional food, i.e. sponge cake and nectar, bread
and milk, fruit and soft food. Very tame. It is reputed to be the largest of
the spiderhunters but from personal experience this is not so; the largest

birds we have owned are A. clarae and A. flavigaster.
Spectacled Spiderhunter Arachnothera flavigaster
Range: Sumatra, Borneo, Malaya and Thailand.
Habitat: Locally common in secondary growth.
Description: Body, head, wings and tail olive green; breast and under-
tail greyish yellow. Covered edge of flight and tail feathers brownish green.
Bold eye ring and ear patch yellow. Beak dark brown; eye brown and feet
horn-coloured.
Comments: One of the easiest to feed. A large bird, probably the
largest if measured by body weight. Very tame and can be kept in pairs or
groups, but again must be watched. Able to take large insects such as adult
crickets and third instar locusts.
Whitehead's Spiderhunter Arachnothera juliae
Everett's Spiderhunter Arachnothera everetti
Both of the two remaining species of spiderhunter occur only on
Borneo and it is unlikely that either has been imported. Information about
their natural history can be found in The Birds of Borneo by B.E. Smythies.
We have seen a skin of everetti and have grouped it, along with juliae
in Group 2 where we think they belong.
The groupings below are based on observations and experience of the
various species in captivity and what we have been able to find out about
their natural history.
Group 1: A. crassirostris, A. longirostris
This group consists of the two smallest species which are similar in
plumage although this is not the major similarity, the important common
characteristics being diet and display..
The display of both is a series of stretch-posing by the male and wing
fluttering by the female. A. longirostris will show its pectoral tufts most
times it displays, but crassirostris only shows them when posing with its
wings open. Both have tail feathers tipped or barred and the feet of both
are very similar to those of the large sunbirds, in that the toes are formed
with the nails being short but curved.
We experienced great difficulty in getting these two species to take
any substitute for live food which was difficult to supply as they would
only take small spiders and fruit flies. It was some time before house flies
and bluebottles were taken, and even then the birds showed little interest.
They would probably have taken small stick insects but at the time we
had not started to use these.
A friend had a longirostris that laid an egg on the floor of a cage. Ours

have never shown any nest-building behaviour, although they did mate.
Group 2: A. clarae, A. chrysogenys, (A. everetti), A. affinis, A. rob-
usta, (A. juliae)
This group contains the true spiderhunters. In appearance they are very
similar. A. clarae has the shortest beak but this is not an indication of how
insectivorous it is as the most insectivorous species in the group is chryso-
genys but none is very dependent on live food in its diet.
The songs of A. clarae, affinis and robusta are so similar that we are
unable to tell them apart \ chrysogenys has a higher pitched song.
The dietary requirements are basically half insectivorous and half
nectar and fruit. Notes from wild observations indicate that fruit juice,
rather than the actual fruit, is eaten.
Group 3: A. magna and A. flavigaster
This group contains the largest species of the genus. Both are robust
birds and able to take quite large insects. The display of A. magna is
mainly wing flutterings and neck stretching; its whistle is a sharp note.

BREEDING THE HYACINTHINE MACAW
Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus
By DAPHNE and WALTER GRUNEBAUM
(Gloucestershire)
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.938977314285714" page_id="58079977"  page_num="11" year="" vol="">
Six years ago we acquired a pair of Hyacinthine Macaws and as we
were unfamiliar with these beautiful birds, we sought information when-
ever possible. We discovered from reference books that they inhabit the
forests, swamps and palm groves of the interior of southern Brazil and
the westernmost parts of Bolivia; also that a great deal of their habitat is
now being lost, owing to the opening up of Brazil, and that numbers of
the birds are used by the natives for food.
Their diet consists of fruit, seeds and nuts of various kinds. They are
mostly seen in pairs and, if disturbed, will circle round, screeching, and
then settle in the tops of tall trees. The staff at Kew Gardens told us that
the trees have a very quick leaf fall, and are almost immediately re-estab-
lished.
These macaws are the largest of all parrots, their length overall being
35 inches (89 cm); the tail of the immature bird is a little shorter.
All this was interesting but did not make us much the wiser at keeping
Hyacinthine Macaws in captivity in the English climate and with the
limited variety of food available here.
When our birds arrived, they were seen feeding each other and gave
every indication of being a true pair. The cock bird had a long white tail
feather and several white flecks on his shoulders so it was easy to dis-
tinguish him from the hen. We put them in our largest aviary, which was
not at all suitable as it was made of wood but it did have a flight 10 ft
(3 m) high and nearly 40 ft (12 m) long. Their "house" measured about
8 ft (2.5 m) x 12 ft (3.65 m) at the apex, with a large, sturdy box 2 ft
(61 cm) square, with a tin base, placed as high as possible on one wall. The
birds obviously liked the height but it proved disastrous from our point of
view, when trying either to inspect or photograph. A barrel was provided
on the ground, together with two others in the flight outside, placed at
various heights. All these barrels were ignored. Several natural branches of
various thickness were fixed inside for them to roost on and, again, were
placed as high as possible. Their house was well lit and heating was also
available, used mainly at night. Their house opened on to a covered
"verandah" where they had their food and drink, and where they could
see all that was going on. From there they had their long flight to a small
perspex-covered shelter at the far end, where they could get out of the

wind, which they cannot tolerate. Several branches of fresh willow, ash or
fruitwood were placed in the aviary, along one side only to allow the birds
flight to be uninterrupted.
When they first came to us, their diet consisted solely of coconut,
Brazil nuts and an occasional apple. Nothing else was taken, and sunflower
seed was totally rejected so their diet was the first problem we had to over-
come. We put another pair of macaws in an adjacent aviary, and the sight
of these birds obviously enjoying banana and various foods eventually
persuaded the Hyacinthines to add other fruits and vegetables to their diet.
After two years, in late March, the hen became interested in her box
and laid two eggs. The incubation period is 28 days but at the end of this
time the eggs vanished, presumably infertile. Alter another two months
she laid two more eggs, but regrettably the chicks were dead in shell. The
following year the hen died in May, quite suddenly and without any signs
of previous illness. The post mortem examination disclosed that she had
no eggs inside her, that she had emphysema and a fatty heart. Perhaps her
previous unsatisfactory diet had some bearing on this.
The cock bird appeared distraught at her death, so we put a young Blue
and Yellow Macaw into the aviary to keep him company. She taught him
to eat sunflower seed, albeit reluctantly. During this time we searched for
another bird, without any success. The cock bird went into moult and lost
his white feathers.
After three months of indefatigable search, we eventually found
another bird. It was not surgically sexed so we had to take a chance. Its
feathers were dull and the yellow skin around the lower mandible was a
pale cream colour, which, compared to the colour of our cock, which was
dark orange, looked almost anaemic and on arrival she ate only Brazil nuts
and white sunflower seed.
We put the two together in September 1982 and after three months we
noticed that her diet had changed and they were both eating a good variety
of food, which consisted mainly of coconuts, Brazil nuts and sweetcorn
(fresh or defrosted frozen), augmented by bananas, grapes, apples, peas,
broad beans and carrots, in season, and a few peanuts and walnuts. These
last were not much favoured. Gradually the sunflower seed was abandoned.
We no longer worried about their diet as their feathers were shining and
the yellow skin on the new bird was becoming darker by the week.
The first indication that they might be courting came when we opened
the trap for the cock to fly at liberty to which he had been accustomed
before his first hen died though since then we had kept him shut in. To
our astonishment he would not go out! He became very excited and flew
backwards and forwards into his house, refusing to go near the trap.

Shortly after this we saw, and heard them mating and on 26th March 1983
to our great relief, she laid two eggs. Three days before the 28-day incuba-
tion period ended the cock opened up the roof of his flight and both birds
were found playing about the garden. As it was her first time at liberty,
with eggs in the box, it was a nasty moment. However, by leaving them
quietly to their own devices, they put themselves back in with no trouble
at all but they lost interest in the eggs which disappeared, presumably in-
fertile. It was then the 25th April.
However, in May 1983 the hen was back in the box again, sitting tight.
The first egg must have been laid between 14th and 16th May. We increased
the heat at this point, and with the aid of an old boiler and a piece of pipe,
we were able to get a thin plume of steam into the house, thereby increas-
ing the level of humidity. We would do this once or twice a day for an
hour or two. It was interesting to see that from this moment, whenever we
approached the aviary, the parents would assume a defensive position with
backs together and tails crossed, accompanied by loud cries. They would
stay like this until we moved away.
It was on 15th June that we heard the unmistakeable sound of macaw-
chick noises coming from the box. It was an unforgettable moment, for
although we have bred so many Blue and Yellow Macaws, somehow this
was very different. The next day we were able to see the chick, which was
tiny and appeared to be black skinned. There was also a second egg which
had been abandoned. On 19th June we looked in again and saw that the
chick was now definitely pink and already much larger. The parents now
started to search for grit early in the morning and we put a pile of lime-
stones in their flight, which they would pick up and grind in their beaks.
We have never seen them eat commercial grit. On 17th June yet another
egg appeared but by the following night it had vanished. The chick then
made steady progress, dark quills being visible by 7th July.
The parents' diet at this time consisted of the usual coconuts and
sweetcorn but they now enjoyed broad beans which were in season, and
the first early peas. However, they could not be persuaded to eat any kind
of soft rearing foot, which was eaten in quantity by the Blue and Yellow
Macaws. A lot of cuttlefish "bone" was taken and daily vitamins were
given in the drinking water.
At six weeks the yellow skin around the black beak and eyes could be
seen and the chick started to look like a real Hyacinthine. The tail was
about 5 in (12.5 cm) long and, apart from a few bare patches on its back,
the chick appeared to be fully feathered and had become very aware of
its surroundings. The parents now started to consume large quantities of
cob and hazel nuts, even when they were still green and unripe.

After another five weeks of steady progress, on 7th September the
chick came out of the box and was found on the floor of the house. The
parents would not go to it but sat on the side of the box calling to it. We
waited, agonising over what best to do, but as it made no attempt to
move, we eventually picked it up and put it back inside the box. After
another day or two, it came out on to the verandah without further
mishap.
However, our satisfaction over its progress was short lived. It appeared
listless and rather nervous of climbing about; we thought this might be due
to its fall at the start. It did not make any serious attempt to eat and
would pick up a piece of sweetcorn and let it drop again, without taking
anything from it. We began to worry when it failed to go back in to roost
with its parents at night, in spite of their desperate efforts to get it to do
so. The cock was obviously aware that something was amiss, and tried to
make the chick eat. He stayed pathetically over the food tin, bobbing his
head and making encouraging little noises but the chick did not respond
and on the day we had decided that it would have to be taken away, it
was found once more on the floor. Although we had not been too happy

i
about its general behaviour, it had nevertheless appeared to be in good
physical shape up to the moment that it failed to go in to roost at night.
It had undoubtedly caught a chill and quick action was called for. We took
it into our house, boosted the room temperature to 80-85*F and laid the
chick on a hot water bottle. Our veterinary surgeon visited and gave it a
tube feed of Complan and Farex, and a B12 injection. The next day it was
still obviously very ill but it was fed every two hours and we felt that it
was holding its own. Someone then suggested that we should wrap it in
foil under the infra-red lamp. This we did and the result was extraordinary
in that, that very same evening, it was up and sitting on the edge of its
box! Feeding was still very difficult as the syringes which we had seemed
inadequate for a bird with such a large beak. However, when some friends
who were experienced in these matters brought us a much larger plastic
syringe, which was, in fact, for basting roast meat, feeding became very
much easier and the chick started to make a rapid recovery. However, if
the temperature in the room dropped below 75 F, the chick deteriorated
again, so a close watch had to be kept. The weight of the chick had dropped
to around 2 lbs at this time, but after five days of regular feeding, it was
once more on its feet and taking an interest in life. We removed it from the
small room, gradually lowering the heat, and installed it in a sunroom,
where it could see other birds. After a short time it was able to hold food
for itself, and was able to cope with peanuts and half-shelled Brazil nuts,
banana, apple and it would try to scrape coconut. For about 10 days we
continued to give it three daily feeds of soft food, but all milk-based food
such as Milupa had to be stopped as the chick started to scour. By adding a
teaspoon of live yoghurt to some apple puree and Farex, this condition
was cured in five days. At the end of three weeks, the chick started to
refuse soft food altogether and now (October 1983) it spends most of the
day wrestling with half-shelled nuts, s,mall pieces of sweetcorn, apple and
soaked raisins. It has become very affectionate. The cock parent has spot-
ted him through the glass and has been down to investigate, regurgitating
as hard as he can. The hen is still not at all interested. We think that they
would still accept the chick, as long as it can feed itself, but now unfortu-
nately the weather is too cold to put it outside, even though it now weighs
over 4 lbs.
Conclusions
In spite of their size, Hyacinthine Macaws do not seem to be very
robust, and for this reason we have never contemplated surgical sexing,
nor have we ever wanted, or indeed needed (until now!) to hand-rear as we
felt that if it could be a natural process, then so much the better for both
mother and chick. Our Blue and Yellow Macaws have reared a brood of

three this season perfectly adequately.
Hyacinthines seem to be very loveable and extremely intelligent birds
but, with their enormously strong beaks, special attention should be paid
to their housing, as we have learned to our cost, a stone and metal con-
struction being the most satisfactory. They also need a never-ending sup-
ply of branches to strip and chew, and they consume a prodigious amount
of food, especially during the breeding season. They are also capable of
making an appalling noise if they are disturbed by strangers, or suffering
from boredom or frustration. Some form of heating to maintain the over-
night temperature at around 70*F, together with some means of increasing
the level of humidity, proved successful in this instance, and the nest-box
was one-third filled with dampened bark and peat to make an atmos-
phere of humid warmth for the eggs.
Breeding the little Hyacinthine has been a wonderful and worthwhile
experience, but we have one regret - the cock bird seems to have lost his
white feathers. It is now well over a year and there is still no sign of them!

As described above, the Hyacinthine Macaw Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus has
been bred by Mr. and Mrs. Walter Grunebaum and this is believed to be the first
success in this country. Anyone knowing of a previous breeding in Great Britain or
Northern Ireland,or any other reason that would disqualify the claim, is asked to
inform the Hon. Secretary.
Shortly before going to press, an article was received from Mr. Gerd Volkemer,
also on breeding the Hyacinthine Macaw. As so little has been published on this
subject, and as Mr. Volkemer's account included some additional details, a precis of
his article is given below. We would like to extend our congratulations to Mr. and
Mrs. Grunebaum and to Mr. Volkemer for breeding such a difficult species which we
hope will now become a regular event, and that their experience will enable captive
breeding stocks to be established eventually.

A pair of these beautiful macaws was obtained in 1977 but unfortu-
nately one died shortly afterwards. It was not until four years later that I
obtained a further bird to make up the pair.
This pair was placed in an aviary measuring 4mx2mx 1,5 m wide
with inside quarters of 1.75 m x 2 m x 1.5 m wide. The temperature was
kept slightly above freezing point during winter although these birds seem
not to be sensitive to cold weather. A matchwood nest-box 1 m high x
50 cm x 50 cm was installed; the entrance hole was 20 cm square. Metal
plating was placed around all corners of the box to prevent it from being
destroyed and oak branches were placed around the entrance for the birds
to chew if they wished.
Their diet consisted of various fruits, dried beef bones, a mixture of
corn, oats, wheat, hemp and some smaller seeds, sunflower and peanuts.
Calcium and minerals were mixed with the food and small pieces of mussel
shell were also given. Every four weeks, the birds received a five-day course
of multi-vitamins in their water. They also showed a fondness for small
stones (1-4 mm).
At the end of May both birds adopted a defensive attitude towards
their nest-box whenever the aviary was approached. The female would
disappear inside before peering out and biting the oak branches surround-
ing the entrance, while the male stood nearby adopting an aggressive pos-
ture. Occasionally both birds would sit close, nodding their heads while
holding beaks and uttering a loud "rolling" noise.
Copulation took place with both birds sitting next to each other, tails
crossed with the male placing a foot on the female's back.
The first two eggs laid disappeared after a fortnight but on 2nd June a
further two were found. These measured 50 mm x 35 mm, were pure
white and the weight of one was 20 grams. The female incubated for
approximately 30 days (exact duration was difficult to determine because
of their aggressiveness). Only one hatched. This chick produced soft noises
Tor several weeks before going through a period of silence until it started
to become very vocal.
Its eyes opened at about two weeks of age and it left the nest at three
months. At this point the plumage was duller than in adults and a paler
yellow around the eye.
In addition to their normal diet, sprouted oats, wheat, sunflower and
corn and unripe corn-on-the-cob (maize) were also given.
In 1983 this pair reared another two young and an additional pair
produced one.

One hundred years ago, in 1884, Maarten Dirk van Renesse van Duiven-
bode presented a magnificent collection of birds and animals from New
Guinea to the Royal Natural History Museum in Belgium. Among them
was a new lory which was dedicated to the donor (Prestwich, 1963).
In the following century, little has been learned about this very
beautiful bird. It was first seen alive in Britain in 1929 when at least four
birds were imported. At the time not much more was known about it
: other than that it was found in northern New Guinea. This is a lowland
species, found up to about 200 m (660 ft). Rand and Gilliard (1967)
found it to be "only fairly common" and recorded that it was usually seen
j in small parties of up to six or eight birds in the tops of forest trees. For-
shaw (1978) records that it is irregularly distributed, being common in
some areas but uncommon to rare in others. Near Maprik, in north-western
Papua New Guinea, Pearson (1975) carried out a six weeks' survey from
September to November on a 15 hectare plot of lowland primary forest.
He found the species to be an uncommon resident of the mid-storey. In
the same year Greensmith observed five Duivenbode's Lories in a mixed
flock with Rainbow Lorikeets feeding at the top of a high tree in second-
growth forest.
During the period 1973 to 1978 several New Guinea parrots, primarily
lories and Fig Parrots, made their reappearance in aviculture, having pre-
viously been known only from the era of small private importations in
the first 30 years of this century. They included Duivenbode's Lories,
which appeared in small numbers; despite every care, many proved diffi-
cult to establish. By the early 1980s no one in Britain had bred the species
(which had been reared in the USA and Germany) and I doubt whether
there were 20 birds in the UK.
This is a lory which could be confused with no other: indeed, few
parrots have such distinctive and unusual plumage and no other parrot
has a colour scheme of rich brown, yellow and violet. The predominant
colour is dark brown. The head is strikingly marked in adult birds with a
band of yellow from the lores, encircling the beak and throat; the fore-
head is also bright yellow. The entire under wing coverts are bright yellow,
also the thighs and a patch on the sides. The underside of the tail is
bronze-yellow. The narrow, elongated feathers of the nape and the sides of
the neck are yellow (dull, not bright) in adults. Lower back, rump and

under tail coverts are violet or deep blue. Breast feathers have the con-
cealed part yellow; primaries are black with a large yellow patch on the
inner web. Beak, cere and legs, also the skin surrounding the eye, are
black. The iris is dark brown, with an inner circle of pale yellow.
Length: 31 cm (12 in).
In the first and second editions of Parrots of the World the word "un-
described" appears after immature plumage. After comparing moulted and
unmoulted birds of the year, I can provide the following description of
immature Duivenbode's Lories:
The yellow area on the face (but not under the wings) is duller and less
extensive than in adults. The elongated nape feathers are brown, not
yellow. The naked skin surrounding the eye and lower mandible is white,
not black as in adults; the bill and cere are black. The size is noticeably
smaller.
Adult males are generally larger and of bolder appearance than females,
although not to the pronounced degree of the Black Lory C. atra.
The genus Chalcopsitta contains four long-tailed lories, of perhaps more
contrasting coloration than is found in any other parrot genera. The
Cardinal C. cardinalis is red, the Black C. atra is black and the Yellow-
streaked C. sintillata has possibly the gaudiest array of colours seen on a
parrot, but is green above. C. duvenbodei has already been described. The
Cardinal is extremely rare in captivity; the other three I have kept and
have bred the Black (Low, 1978). The Chalcopsitta lories are fascinating
birds, beautiful, extremely responsive to man and highly intelligent. They
nearly all become tame in time, even imported adults. Young birds quickly
start to mimic, without any conscious effort to teach them on the part of
their owner: some adults kept in an aviary will mimic the sounds of human
conversation without actually producing words.
Unfortunately, however, they are extremely noisy and frequently emit
harsh, ear-splitting shrieks of a power which is perhaps equalled only by
the largest cockatoos. When in breeding condition their calls are persistent
and even more excrutiatingly unpleasant.
Our Chalcopsitta lories have, as their basic diet, nectar which consists
of malt extract (1 heaped tablespoonful), Milupa baby cereal (a variety of
fruit flavours) (two or three heaped tablespoonsful), glucose (two heaped
tablespoonsful) and a little condensed milk, dissolved in hot water and
then made up to 1 litre (35 fluid oz) with cold water. This is changed
twice daily or more frequently in very hot or very cold weather. I am not
entirely convinced that this is a good rearing diet for Duivenbode's Lories,
although it has proved satisfactory for other species (plus various fruits
and vegetables and, in some cases, seed) and in future will attempt to

supplement this. The problem with the Duivenbode's is that they are most
conservative feeders and usually decline to accept foods other than sweet
corn and a little apple and pear. This is in complete contrast to the Yellow-
streaked Lories which will consume almost any food offered.
Prior to being introduced to the male in November 1978 the female of
our pair of Duivenbode's had been kept with another female for about
three years. Her initial reaction to the male was one of fear; she crouched
in the corner of the aviary on the floor, although at no time has the male
behaved aggressively towards her. After several months they were totally
compatible. I neglected to note when copulation first occurred but believe
that this was in 1981. The first breeding attempt was in 1982. Two eggs
were laid; one chick hatched and died the same day.
Because of the extreme aggressiveness of the male in breeding condition
(he would attack anyone who entered the aviary - a total transformation
from the timid adult when first acquired) the pair was moved to a new
aviary in February 1983. A few feet from their former enclosure, it was
designed to allow nest-box inspection from outside the aviary. The meas-
urements were 7 ft x 3 ft x 6 ft (2.1 m x 91 cm x 1.8 m high).In a seclu-
ded position, protected by a wall, shrubs and conifers (and covered in
polythene in the winter), it has no shelter. The nest-box is permanently
in position for roosting purposes. It measures 9 in (23 cm) square and
21 in (54 cm) high. Several inches of pet litter (obtained in compressed
packs from pet shops) line the base.
Mating and courtship feeding had been observed for several weeks prior
to their removal. Removal did not interrupt the breeding cycle. They soon
entered the new nest-box and by 12th April the female was incubating one
egg. The completed clutch, as in most lories, was two eggs.
I inspected the nest on*the evening of 5th May, when the female made
a brief sojourn into the flight and, to my surprise, saw a wriggling chick.
I had a split second before the female's return to decide what to do -
and removed it just as she came in through the nest entrance. The chick
was fluffy, indicating that it was not newly-hatched; it had either hatched
on the previous day or early that morning. There was no food in its crop
but it seemed strong and healthy. After it had been in the brooder a little
while, it fed eagerly on our usual lory chick food. This consists of approxi-
mately equal parts of Boots bone and beef broth with vegetables (baby
weaning food) and Heinz tinned fruit dessert. This is simply mixed with
water and heated until it starts to boil. It is quick and easy to make and
will rear any lory species. At first the chick could take only small amounts
and needed to be fed every hour or hour and a half.
Next evening I inspected the nest again and was surprised and delighted
to find a second chick. Again, I just managed to remove it before the

female returned. I greatly dislike removing chicks in these circumstances -
before the parents have been given an opportunity to rear - and silently
vowed that next time they should have a chance to rear their own. On
removal the second chick was more obviously newly-hatched than the
first. It weighed 8 g, as against 9 g of the first chick. The chicks had the
bill very dark brown, with a contrasting white egg tooth. The long white
down was not densely distributed over the body.
By the time they were seven days old, the chicks' feet had assumed a
brown tinge. Between 10 and 19 days their bodies took on a darker
appearance as the feather tracts of the second down became apparent.
Being dark in colour, they were most conspicuous. By about 20 days the
second down was erupting. This was dark grey in colour. The eyes started
to slit at about 12 days but were not fully open until about three weeks.
The toes of one chick were in the correct position, while all those of the
other were still pointing forward; this is quite common at this age.
On 29th May, at about 24 days, the first contour feathers were erupt-
ing, shortly to be followed by the head feathers. At this stage they had a
somewhat untidy appearance, retaining wisps of the first down on the
head and back. By the time they were five weeks old the body feathers
had just broken through the sheaths. These were dull brown above and
yellow-tipped brown below. There was a tinge of yellow on the opening
feathers of the forehead, cheeks and ear coverts. The white area of skin
surrounding the eye was very prominent. The large, sturdy feet were
black. The chicks weighed 130 and 140 g.
By then the temperature in the brooder had been reduced from about
92*F to 82*F (27.7 *C). Their feathering was well developed by six
weeks - nearly covering the mantle, underparts and crown. The younger
chick had deeper coloured and more extensive yellow feathering on the
forehead and ear coverts and at the sides of the beak. However, by the
time they were weaned and after the first moult, they were indistinguishable.
Their tails were, at six weeks, Vi in (12 mm) long.
By this stage they were very vocal, their food soliciting call sounding
like that of a Trichoglossus lorikeet chick amplified. They were quite
active and their nails were painfully sharp. At seven weeks they were
transferred from the brooder, in which the heat had been gradually lowered
to about 79*F (21*C), to an unheated weaning cage. This is simply a box
12 in x 16 in x 12 in high (31 x 41 x 31 cm), with a hinged lid and a wire
front. The young birds stand on a false floor of welded mesh under which
there is a thick layer of wood chippings. These weaning cages are utilised
in preference to larger, open parrot cages, as a convenient transition from
the brooder.
By now the young Duivenbode's were almost fully feathered, except

The young Duivenbode's Lories on the point of taking off to land on the
photographer's head. They were very difficult to photograph!
under the wings (the final area to feather in lory chicks); the tails were
very short, less than 2 in (about 4 cm). They were becoming vocal and
adventurous, and their personalities were emerging. The older chick was
perching and could climb to the top of the weaning cage. A week later
they had outgrown this and were transferred to a metal cage 24 in (61 cm)
long with a wire front.
When offered nectar on 30th June the older chick soon started to
feed. Within two days both were drinking substantial amounts, filling
their crops between spoon-feeds. The older chick quickly learned to
drink in the same manner as an adult, while the younger at first lapped,
keeping its lower mandible outside the nectar container. A week pre-
viously their food had been augmented with CeDe Canary rearing food,
as provided to larger parrot chicks, as they had seemed a little on the
thin side.
Within a few days it became impracticable to keep them in the metal
cage and they were transferred to a 6 ft (1.8 m)indoor flight. On 30th and
31st July they were placed outdoors for most of the day but brought
indoors at night because thunderstorms were imminent. They settled
down quickly in their outdoor aviary, finding the nectar within minutes.

At this stage they were still receiving a late night spoon-feed, partly
because they enjoyed the attention and because I believe that weaning
should be as protracted as possible.
Meanwhile, the parents had nested again; the female laid on 28th and
30th June. I was able to ascertain the incubation period as 24 days, as the
eggs hatched on 21st and 23rd July. Fortunately it was easy to inspect
the nest as the female would leave whenever fresh nectar was provided.
For the first two days of the first chick's life 1 inspected the nest two or
three times daily and never found it with any food in its crop. On the
third morning I fed the chick and returned it to the nest. That evening
there were two chicks and I removed both for a quick feed. I fed the
younger and found to my relief that the other had a full crop.
Thenceforth the female became much more protective of the nest;
while she allowed me a quick look when she left, she would return before
I could ascertain how much food was in the chicks' crops. I continued to
check the nest two or three times daily - as it is up to the eight-day stage
that losses of lory chicks are most likely to occur - and all seemed to be
progressing well.
The only food taken during this period was nectar and a little corn and
apple; other fruits and greenfoods were ignored. The female was very at-
tentive to the chicks which usually had bulging crops. However, as often
happens with lory chicks, the older was appreciably heavier and probably
receiving a greater share of the food. On 21st July I was quite concerned
about the younger and removed it quickly to find it weighed only 41 g.
At the same age the hand-reared chicks had weighed 83 g and 74 g. Some
extra litter (wood shavings) was added to the nest, which remained dry.
While this was being carried out, the parents showed extreme anxiety,
screaming and biting at the nest-box from which they had been prevented
access. Because of their concern I decided to leave the chicks with them,
although neither was as well developed as their hand-reared counterparts.
By 23rd July they had some wispy down remaining, but no signs of
feather tracts. A week later both were totally devoid of down - and I
suspected that they were being plucked by the female. Feather tracts
were evident, especially on the wings.
By 21st August the younger chick was totally devoid of down and no
feathers were emerging. As it was a source of worry, it was removed for
hand-feeding. Its weight was 89 g. It then progressed well and had greatly
increased its weight to 140 g by 30th August. By the middle of September
it was fully feathered but remained in a heated brooder because it had a
much younger Dusky Lory Pseudeos fuscata as a companion. Doubtless it
would have consumed nectar at an earlier age but this was not oftered
until 25th September when both young lories were moved to a weaning

cage. The five and a half week old Dusky consumed nectar equally as
enthusiastically as the Duivenbode's.
Also on 25th September the Duivenbode's reared by its parents
emerged from the nest-box - after 11 weeks. It sat quite calmly in the
aviary. The night promised to be fine and mild; nevertheless, I took the
precaution of returning it to the nest-box. It was roosting out after its
parents had retired to the nest. On the following night the procedure
was repeated but the young lory emerged immediately from the nest to
roost alone on top of it. After several weeks it roosted inside with its
parents.
Unfortunately, I cannot record this as a total success story. On the
morning of 2nd December, following a very cold night with several degrees
of frost, one of the May-hatched youngsters was found dead in the nest-
box. My veterinarian provided the following post mortem report: "The
main finding - and the cause of death in my opinion - was a large cyst of
ureate-like material ventral to the cloaca but not affecting the cloacal
bursa. This contained about 15 ml of fluid and bulged out as soon as the
abdomen was opened. The material had no smell and there was no sign of
infection or inflammation. The bird was a female and the areas affected
seem to be the distal oviduct/uterus (shell gland). I feel that this is prob-
ably a congenital abnormality in this bird and that the cyst had gradually
been filling throughout its life."
On a brighter note, I am pleased to report that several months after our
initial success, Duivenbode's Lory was bred in two other collections in the
UK - by Mrs. Patricia King and at Birdland, Bourton-on-the-Water, one
youngster being reared in each case.

Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.974464533333333" page_id="58079993"  page_num="27" year="" vol="">
The genus Poospiza consists of some 16 species of Neotropical buntings;
they are small, active and acrobatic birds which are not well known in avi-
culture. Importations into the UK have always been small in number and
erratic and because of their quietly coloured plumage, they have lacked
the popularity of more colourful and available genera, such as Paroaria,
Sicalis and Corysphospingus. There have been very few successful breedings,
the most recent is probably forP ornata in Sweden (Zackrisson, 1972).
The limited information available indicates that they are, like other
Neotropical Emberizidae, opportunistic breeders, with a rapid reproduc-
tion rate when triggered by "optimum" environmental conditions. They
are very insectivorous when breeding and if a good quality insectivorous
diet is provided, reproduction in outside aviaries is not inhibited by
declining photo period and temperature.
P hispaniolensis has also been known as Bonaparte's Warbling Finch;
the species is sexually dimorphic.
Description
Cock: Bill blackish and glossy, rather long and slender, hides brownish,
lower eyelid white, long white eyebrow stripe surmounted by narrow dark
line, side of head black, upperparts grey, wing coverts with a greenish buff
wash, tail black with the inner webs of outer feathers whitish. Underparts
white, side of breast and body grey, centre of breast black, sides of vent
chestnut, legs and feet light brown.
Hen: Bill greyish brown, eyebrow stripe greyish white, upperparts
brown streaked with dusky, tail greyish brown, underparts greyish; the
hen lacks the black on the sides of head and centre of breast.
Distribution and habitat
South-west Ecuador and coastal Peru; cactus, scrub and cultivation.
Birds and housing
A pair of P hispaniolensis was purchased in October 1980 and housed
in an outside heated bird room during the winter. During 1981 and 1982

they were housed outside in my No. 3 aviary (3.25 x 1.5 x 2.25 m) from
April to November.
Food and feeding
The birds are fed on a millet mixture with the addition of canary seed,
niger, hemp and maw; a commercial insectivorous softfood is also given,
but seldom eaten. Seeding grasses are given throughout the year. Livefood
consisting of mealworms, maggots and small house crickets are also given
throughout the year and when the birds are breeding, collected livefood
from nettle beds and bushes is provided.
Breeding
Although both birds were fit and active, the cock also singing frequent-
ly throughout the seasons, no breeding activity occurred during 1981 and
1982. They were released into No. 3 aviary on 25th May 1983 and both
birds were very active, the cock singing continuously. On 5th August, the
hen began to build a nest in a clump of coniferous branches fixed to the
aviary side. The nest was completed by 8th August and copulation was
observed. Both birds chased away other species from the site ( Uraeginthus,
Amandava Waxbills and a pair of Tambourine Doves Turtur tympanistria).
The first clutch was infertile. One chick was hatched and reared from each
of the second and third clutches (Table 1).

The same nest was used for the three clutches, a deep cup of dried
grasses and straw, lined with finer grass stems (Plate 1) built in a fork of
cut conifer branches. The hen alone built the nest and during this period
the cock was continually chasing other birds from the site.

Very pale blue ovates, marked at the larger end with small blackish
and dark ash spots, three to a clutch.
Incubation
Like other Neotropical buntings, the hen was a close sitter and toler-
ant of nest inspection. The incubation period was 13 days, carried out
entirely by the hen. The cock occasionally fed her while she was incuba-
ting, although she came off the nest to feed herself and exercise.
Chicks
The nestling has dark greyish skin, with greyish brown down; the gape
is pinkish with whitish gape flanges, darker near bill tip. Both parents
fed the chick, the cock brooding when the hen came off to feed. This
pattern was repeated for the chick of the third clutch. In common with
other Neotropical bunting species, the chicks left the nest at an early
age (10 and 9 days respectively); neither the primaries nor tail feathers
were fully developed and they could not fly effectively for another four
to five days.
At 26 days (plate 2) the young have the bill dark horn, the irides are
light brown, the forehead, crown and nape are greyish brown with a pro-
nounced greyish white eyebrow stripe. The area from the bill across the
upper face to the nape is brownish grey, the throat and lower cheeks are
greyish white. Breast and abdomen are light grey, heavily streaked with
dark brown, the upper surface is greyish brown, streaked with darker
brown, wings and tail brown, with a few feathers tipped with light grey,
legs and feet light flesh colour.
The parents fed the chicks almost entirely on live food, collected from
nettle beds and bushes, supplemented with mealworms and small maggots.
House crickets and insectivorous softbill mixture was provided but was not
fed to the chick. However, the young birds, when independent of their
parents, took both crickets and soft food. When the hen was incubating
the third clutch, the cock fed and guarded the first chick that had hatched.
The young became independent of the parents at 24 and 25 days respec-
tively, eating hard seed and all other foods provided. At the time of writ-
ing (30th November 1983) the first hatched chick is darker on the side
of the head, wings and breast, and appears to be a young cock.
Behaviour
P. hispaniolensis is an active, fast flying species, constantly flirting the
wings and tail and perching on the sides of the aviary and plant growth,
and acrobatic and effective at catching flying insects. Pair bonding and pre-

copulatory display consists of bill touching, the birds flying towards each
other then briefly touching bills while hovering. When perched, they move
rapidly towards each other along the perch and touch bills. Bill touching
is often followed by copulatory chasing, the cock chasing the hen until
she perches. The soliciting posture consists of the hen raising her head,
flirting the wings and tail, and then the tail is moved to one side and
raised. The cock then mounts with rapid wing beats. There is often an
element of aggression in this display, usually from the hen who will jab
at the cock after bill touching. During copulatory chasing, the cock will
make a circling movement of the head in line with the body; the head is
raised, moved back and then lowered and thrust forward in one rapid
movement. Zackrisson (1972) reported that breeding Pretty Warbling
Finches P. omata were very aggressive to other species, killing a waxbill.
In view of this, I was apprehensive. However, although the cock, and
occasionally the hen, chased other birds from the nest site, no serious
aggression occurred. Both parents were bold when I entered the aviary,
flying at my head and sometimes lightly brushing me with their wings.
Voice
The call notes are a che it cheoo. The cock's song is loud and cheerful,
rather complex for an Emberizinae species. I have noted it as choo whit
cheoo, choo chit wit cheoo cheoo, cheoo whit chee cheoo, choo chit wit,
chit chee cheoo cheoo chit, chi cheoo wit. When I entered the aviary or a
cat was sighted they gave a low chut chut.
Summary
The breeding of captive P. hispaniolensis is described with notes on
behaviour and voice. In common with other Neotropical buntings, they
lay small clutches and are multi-brooded. The young have a rapid rate of
growth and development.
In a temperate climate, reproduction is not inhibited by declining
photo-period and temperature.

A White-cheeked Touraco has been successfully hand-reared at Padstow
Bird Gardens from an egg deserted by the parents, for no apparent reason,
after ten days' incubation.
A clutch of two eggs was placed in the incubator at a temperature of
99*F. The incubation period for the White-cheeked Touraco is 21-22 days,
the eggs being laid at two-day intervals, with two being the normal clutch
size. We were surprised when chipping was heard from the eggs on the
23rd day as we had just begun to think that the chicks were dead in shell.
The first chick to hatch was very small and had obvious difficulty in
breathing which got steadily worse and it died later that same day. The
second chick hatched within minutes of the first, on the 24th day of in-
cubation. This chick was much stronger than the first and it struggled
for a few seconds to free itself from the shell, then, exhausted by its
efforts, it slept for several minutes; upon waking it started to preen itself
by throwing its head over its back and pulling at its thick, black down.
At this stage, it was still quite weak and could only support its head for
a second or two.

White-cheeked Touraco being fed at 14 days old
Once dry, it showed signs of being hungry and a Chinese Painted
Quail egg, which was also about to hatch in the incubator, almost became
its first meal!
The Touraco was reared on a low fat, natural yogurt and first stage
baby food "Fruit Delight" mixture, to which was added small quantities
of calcium lactate, Vionate and Farlene baby cereal. The ingredients
were mixed well and slightly warmed by adding a little hot water.
The Touraco, whose eyes opened on the second day, would gape at
the slightest vibration but it was a further five days before it responded
by sight alone. It was fed by a 5 ml syringe to which a small length of
soft rubber tubing had been attached. At first, it was fed about 3 Vi ml
of food every hour through the day, then once last thing at night and
again in the small hours of the morning.
To cool it down, as when a brooding adult gets off the chick to feed
it, the young Touraco was removed from the incubator at each feed.
To make the chick feel more secure, I placed it in a small cardboard
box measuring 6 x 6 x 4 in. It was lined with limpet shells to give its
feet a good grip and to stop its legs from splaying. The shells were covered
with absorbant kitchen paper, which had to be changed every time it
defecated, which was usually three times an hour.

The temperature in the incubator was gradually reduced by a couple of
degrees each day until the chick seemed most comfortable at 85*F.
At eight days old, small black pin feathers had begun to show through
on its tail, wings and down its spine. It would preen these feathers con-
stantly, removing the protective sheaths as the feathers began to emerge.
At feeding times it would now become very agitated if its food was not
delivered quickly enough and its ration steadily increased to 5 ml an hour.
By 20 days, the young Touraco had nearly replaced its baby down with
black feathers, which, although preened regularly, always looked scruffy.
The chick was now moved into a large, unheated cage so that it could get
plenty of exercise. When let out to be fed, it would immediately try to
sample the numerous plants around the room.
Its mischievous antics were a delight to watch as it would always try to
scale the highest furniture in the room, and as it could only fly very poorly
this always resulted in it falling back and damaging its newly-developed
tail feathers.
At three weeks, it had begun to pick up small pieces of fruit and so it
was gradually weaned from the syringed food on to solid fruit. By five
weeks, it was fully independent and was, therefore, moved into an outdoor
aviary during the day and brought back in at night.
Now at five months old, it has moulted into a handsome bird with
perfectly formed legs, toes and feet.

The Golden-breasted or Regal Starling has long been regarded as the
most striking, if not the most beautiful of the African starlings. The
metallic blue, green and violet upperparts contrasting with the bright gold-
en-yellow underparts and long tapering tail, make this bird a treasured
avicultural species. Native to the arid acacia regions of Somalia and Kenya,
this magnificent bird can be seen in many U.S. zoos, but unfortunately it
is still breeding in only a few.

Lincoln Park Zoo received its Golden-breasted Starlings from Kenya
during July 1977. The birds are kept in a heavily planted free flight
exhibit approximately 31 metres long, 9 metres wide and 9 metres high,
with approximately 30 other species including Violet-backed Starlings
Cinnyricinculus leucogaster, Superb Starlings Spreo superbus , and White-
headed Buffalo Weavers Dinemellia dinemelli. In general, the birds coexist
quite well, the only skirmishes occurring when the Spreos had young at
which time they would aggressively chase other Starlings away from any
mealworms or crickets put into the exhibit. In addition to live food, all
of our starlings are fed an insectivorous mix, consisting of ground fruit,
egg, and meat with a multivitamin additive.
Our first encouraging sign with this species began in the spring of 1979
ft &amp;quot;
when they began displacing the Spreos at the food plates and at areas
where live food is provided. Soon nesting material, leaves, grass and
feathers, were being carried to a wooden nest-box about 5 metres off the
ground. The box measured 25 cm x 25 cm x 37 cm high with a circular
opening 9.1 cm in diameter.
When the eggs were laid, approximately 21 cm of nesting material was
in the nest-box. The eggs, usually three or four, are greenish blue with
reddish brown speckling. Since we could not determine precisely when the
eggs were laid without disturbing the birds, an exact incubation period
cannot be determined. Although eggshell is rarely found, a successful
hatch is usually determined by both adults carrying mealworms in their
bill to the nest-box. To counteract nestling mortality, the young starlings
(including Superbs) are generally removed from the nest at 10 days to
two weeks old for hand-rearing. This may also induce the adults to lay a
replacement clutch. The average weight of five chicks at 12 days old was
45.8 gm. Hand-rearing is difficult at first as the young are reluctant to
beg for food, however keeping them in a dark box and tapping lightly on
the side of the nest-cup prior to feeding will work, with patience. Nestlings
are hand-fed soft, white mealworms and a commercially prepared bird of
prey mix. Young Golden-breasted Starlings begin to eat on their own at
between three to four weeks old.
From 1979 to 1981 inclusive, twelve young were produced from our
breeding pair and send on loan to other zoos. Unfortunately, our breeding
female died in 1981. At the time of writing, a second female, received on
loan from the Denver Zoo, has hatched her first clutch of three eggs.

Tockus flavirostris
By B. MARSHALL (Kineton, Warwickshire)
I obtained a pair of Yellow-billed Hornbills in October 1982 and, as
they had come from an outside aviary, I had no hesitation in putting them
outside. Initially they were housed in a cage 4 ft x 2 ft (1 m 22cm
x 61 cm) to enable me to settle them down and get their aviary ready.
Their permanent aviary had to be modified before the Hornbills could
be put into it. It was originally an L-shaped construction in the top
corner of the garden and consisted of two 10 ft x 4 ft (3.05 x 1.22 m)
aviaries to which was attached a shed 6 ft x 4 ft (1.83 x 1.22 m) providing
inside quarters of 4 ft x 2 ft (1.22 m x 0.61 m) for each aviary. The
conversion was simple enough as all it entailed was moving the dividing
partition to give one aviary 14 ft x 4 ft (4.27 m x 1.22 m) for the Horn-
bills and one aviary 6 ft x 4 ft (1.83 x 1.22 m) for the original occupants -
three pairs of White-bellied Manikins. The foliage and perches were strip-
ped from the intended Hornbill aviary, except for small evergreens, and
the whole floor dug over. Large perches were then placed at either end of
the aviary. Two nest-boxes were fitted; one approximately 18 in x 18 in x
18 in (46 x 46 x 46 cm), filled to a depth of 6 in (15 cm) with a mixture
of peat and rotten wood and with a 4 Vl in (11.5 cm) diameter hole, was
placed at the end of the aviary nearest the shelter with the hole facing
down the length of the aviary. The other box, measuring 12 in x 12 in
x 24 in (30.5 x 30.5 x 60.1 cm), filled in the same way, and with the same
4 Vi in diameter hole, was fitted to the back panel of the aviary with the
hole facing the front of the aviary and the house.
Although not surgically sexed, I thought the birds were a pair. Whilst
the plumage was identical, one bird was noticeably smaller than the other,
having a smaller head and beak, and this I took to be the hen. From
subsequent behaviour, I was proved correct.
The birds were placed in the shelter part of their aviary and shut in for
about two weeks. On allowing them access to the aviary itself, the cock
bird was first to emerge, uttering what was later discovered to be an alarm
call. This alarm call was used frequently at times when he was unsure of
strangers or unusual happenings around the aviary. Having satisfied himself
that all was well, he then fetched the hen out and together they continued
to inspect every part of the aviary, including a cursory check of the nest-
boxes.
The pair over-wintered outside with no problems at all. Although we

did not have too bad a winter, they still had access to the shed which was
kept above freezing by two 12 in tubular heaters which were thermostati-
cally controlled.
In the early part of the spring, the birds showed a lot of interest in the
nest-boxes, though most of this interest seemed to be in the larger one and
consisted mainly of removing, and subsequently replacing, bits of the
filling material.
On 3rd June 1983, the birds were seen mating and for the next month
the aviary was a hive of activity during which time many alterations had to
be made. The birds were very tolerant of my continual interference,
albeit, in my opinion, for their benefit.
Despite all their attempts at shoring up the 414 in diameter hole in the
nest-box, they were having no luck at all. Obviously the average garden
mud was not suitable, and so a trip was made to the local hills with two
buckets. This resulted in some beautifully soft, very adhesive mud which
: seemed ideal for the job but, unfortunately, this was not the case and they
were still having trouble getting it to adhere. At this point we decided to
remove the perch from the nest-box and nail bark to it, thus giving the
front at least the appearance of a tree and at the same time giving the birds
a much thicker area around the hole. The results of this modification were
immediately apparent as, within 24 hours, the entrance hole was getting
smaller. My own conclusions from this were that they were quite willing
to accept this artificial tree but the wood needed to be at least 1 in (2.5
cm) thick to allow mud, etc. to be plastered on. The Hornbills preferred
to cling below the entrance hole, as opposed to perching.
On 15th July 1983, the hen entered the nest-box and, with the aid of
the cock, sealed herself in, leaving only a slit about 3 in (7.5 cm) high
by Vi in (1.5 cm) wide through which the cock bird fed the hen religiously.
He seemed a lot more agitated at this time and whenever strangers ap-
proached the aviary, he would fly continuously backwards and forwards,
utttering his alarm cry.
On 19th August, five weeks after the hen had entered the nest-box for
the final time, chicks were heard in the nest-box. They seemed to under-
stand the sounds of their parents immediately, calling when the hen
had accepted food from the cock and going silent, no matter what, on
! hearing the alarm call of the cock.
All went very well until about 24th or 25th September, when the
r food intake began to drop. The cock bird was still as attentive as ever and,
as it was approximately 70 days since the start, I concluded that they
would probably be coming out very soon.
On the morning of 4th October, some 82 days after the hen had
been walled into the box, a hole no more than 2 in (5 cm) diameter was

knocked in the seal and she
emerged, very well feathered,
having moulted during her
enforced confinement, but
she was very thin.
The pair promptly set
about re-sealing the hole, but
not before it had been noted
that at least one well-grown
chick was in residence. It
took them about two hours
to restore the seal to its
former state, then the waiting
game continued.
On my arrival home from
work at about 5.30 p.m. on
4th October, 1983, I checked
the Hornbills. The adults
were sitting on a perch
looking decidedly bored, and
close examination of the
nest-box showed the hole
to be completely sealed.
Something was seriously
wrong! Having read all that I
Yellow-billed Hornbill at 51 days could on the breedings of
T ockus, I knew there were no
records of this before. I decided to feed the birds and see if some fresh
food would stimulate them into opening up the hole and feeding the
chicks. Unfortunately this did not work. Although they did feed and
perched near the box, no attempt was made to open up the box. At
6.30 p.m. it was decided to bring any chicks that were still alive into
the house and hand-rear them.
The entrance hole was carefully broken open and a solitary chick was
found alive and well inside. It was also evident that other chicks had died
at some time during the rearing.
The chick weighed in at 150 grams and was almost fully feathered. The
beak was very much smaller than those of the parents, being only about
2 in (5 cm) long. It had a grey beak and its legs were grey black as in
the parents. The plumage was the same as the parents in colour although
the tail was a lot shorter. The actual boxy size was about that of a hen
bird. However, the pink wattles and bald facial skin were grey coloured

in the chick.
The chick, though very strong and extremely well fed, did not look
at all well and its eyes were glazed. It was placed in a hospital cage and
left for two hourse during which time it huddled in the corner of the
cage. When the time came to feed the chick, it seemed to have perked
up quite a lot and most certainly had a will of its own. The biggest prob-
lem with hand-feeding was probably the size of the chick's tongue as it
was only about one-third the length of the beak which meant that all the
food had to be placed well back.
Within 24 hours of being brought indoors, the chick was a changed
bird, refusing to stay still whilst being fed, preferring to perch on the
spar of a chair or on someone's shoe or arm. It showed all the signs of
its parents' curiosity and intelligence, it had the ability to pick food up
almost immediately but had some difficulty in tossing it from the end
of its beak and catching it at the back to allow it to be swallowed; its
success rate will obviously improve with age.
After three days, the chick was transferred from its hospital cage to
a 4 ft (1.22 m) show cage where it spends most of its time preening and
cursing anyone who gets too close. It seems to be settling down well.
On 8th October 1983 I removed the nest-box for inspection and found
inside a dead but well-formed chick of about five weeks, which could
possibly explain the lower intake of food in late September. Throughout
the rearing the cock had been passing large amounts of newspaper to the
hen and this was neatly layered inside the box, possibly being used to
absorb the very liquid droppings. The hen, as was mentioned earlier, had
moulted in the box. By the layering of newspaper in the box, it is pos-
sible to see that the hen did, in fact, moult prior to the hatching of the
chicks.
At all times, diced fruit was available to the birds, together with meat,
mealworms and crickets, and soaked sponge cage. Although the parents
fed on all of these foods, the chick was reared entirely on meat and live
food. Whilst the hen was sitting, I changed the meat content of their diet
from mince to what our butcher sells as dog mince. It consists of a variety
of meat bits and pieces which are apparently passed through a mincer with
larger holes. The Hornbills prefer this mince to the ordinary mince. It was
interesting to note that whenever the meat from a chicken wing was
offered, this was taken in preference to all other foods.
Why the chick was sealed in completely, I do not know and probably
never will. Next year, however, there are going to be some alterations to
the nest-box in that it will be positioned so that the hole faces north and
it will have a removable back partition with an inner glass cover to allow
me to check on the progress of things. I will also be able to remove any

dead chicks as the smell of the decaying chick may have been what trig-
gered the sealing of the box.
The filling in the box will be deeper for two reasons: firstly, because
the inmates are apparently supposed to eject droppings from the box
through the slit - with only 6 in (15 cm) of filling, they could not possibly
reach the slit which was some 14 in (35.5 cm) higher. This distance be-
tween the chick and the hole, despite the wooden struts inside the box,
may have made it impossible for the chick to climb out of the box with
the hen, had it wished to.
The chick, now some 10 days out of the nest, is feeding well, mostly on
dog meat with the occasional mealworm, but it is showing no signs of
eating any fruit or sponge cake. Despite being very tame and friendly when
out of its cage, the chick still insists on hissing and uttering alarm calls
when its food is placed in the cage, if it is in there.
It is not known at what age these birds achieve maturity but we hope
that a mate will be acquired in the not too distant future and another

By PATRICIA STOODLEY (Portsmouth, Hampshire)
At Broadhalfpenny Down Conservation Sanctuary we try not to carry
too many lame ducks'. It has been our policy for a number of years to
weed out parrots that are non-producers, or at least rear too few chicks.
The cost of labour, housing and food make it essential to utilise the aviary
space available to the best advantage.
Birds kept at the Sanctuary are mainly Amazon parrots, macaws and
Pionus parrots, and by retaining only the most prolific breeding birds in
the collection there is every possibility that the progeny will be equally
prolific as the parent stock.
Our strict programme to improve breeding in our stock would not be
looked on favourably by those who become attached to their birds and
cannot find it in their hearts to part with those that do not produce young.
Regrettably, no matter how engaging these parrots are, we cannot afford
the luxury of keeping them, and usually an understanding home is found
where they will be appreciated as pets.
Even with the best of care, breeding failures cannot be totally elimina-
ted. Occasionally a pair that has reared chicks successfully many times
before will fail to nest. Perhaps one or both birds will not be in good
enough condition to breed, or they may have infertile eggs or chicks
dead in shell.
We give particular attention to these pairs, first eliminating the possi-
bility of outside disturbance being the cause of the breeding problem -
cat, fox, hawk, rats, etc., can all prove devastating. The nest-box is also
inspected for dampness, mice, ants, etc., and also for structural damage
such as the bottom being chewed away.
If there are no obvious external reasons why a particular pair have
failed to breed, then attention is turned to the birds themselves.

We start,if necessary, with a worming programme. Then, although our
diet is not considered to be a contributory factor to poor fertility, since
it is used in general throughout the Sanctuary and the breeding results
here are way above average, any breeding pair failing to go to nest is
given higher concentrations of the vitamins and minerals essential to
high fertility. We find that the most effective method of providing these
additions in a palatable form is to increase the amount of kelp powder
and vitamin B12, also known as cobalamin, or cyanocobalamin, in the
diet.

The rations we feed generally contain a wide variety of beans and
peas: butter beans, black-eyed beans, chick peas, flageolet beans, green
garden peas, green whole lentils, haricot beans, kidney beans, lima beans,
soya beans, etc. They are soaked in water overnight and then heated to
boiling point. When cool, they are added to wheat, maize, pearl barley
and buck wheat. The latter is a grass seed and is not usually considered
to be a wheat. These cereals are also soaked in water overnight but are
not heated.
Fruit and vegetables are added. We use apple, carrot, celery, orange,
beetroot, garden greens, winter radish, boiled sweet potatoes, lucerne
and live twigs. Most of our parrots prefer bitter-tasting foods, and they
also relish dandelion plants including the roots. The mixture can be put
\0x25A0 through a food processor and fed as a mash with a little meat, milk, fish
or broth, or it can be fed in its whole state.
We add a liberal sprinkling of kelp powder daily to each pair's dish
of food. The vitamin B12 is given in a little milk. We could feed it
poured over cake, rusk or bread, but our parrots willingly drink this
pleasant tasting liquid as a treat. Although soluble in water, B12 needs
to be combined with calcium for best results, and milk therefore makes

Before the breeding season gets under way, the incubation room and
the brooder, or rearing room, are thoroughly cleaned. All accessible
surfaces are washed down with Aquasan. This is a liquid sanitising agent
\ for livestock drinking water, and is effective as a disinfectant, fungicide,
algicide and deodorant. It is odourless, non-irritating and non-toxic. More
commonly used in poultry and pig units to keep the drinking water clear
! of slime and bacteria, it helps to prevent transmission of disease through
i water.
-
To make doubly sure, the rooms are also fumigated with Microgen,
which is a pill source of formaldehyde gas and contains 90% formalde-
hyde.
During the breeding season, we anticipate having some 100 Amazon,
macaw and Pionus parrot chicks hatch in the incubators, this being only
a part of the total number reared. To achieve this success it is necessary
to acquire technique in the use of an incubator. Eggs of the larger parrots
are too valuable to adopt the 'happy Jack' approach of 'having a go and
hoping for the best'!
There are several commercial incubators on the market, but our units

have been purpose-built to suit our particular requirements. Eggs are
moved from incubator to incubator as they progress, and once hatched
the chicks are taken to the brooder room.
The 1983 breeding season started early for us at the Sanctuary with the
Scarlet Macaws A. macao, Blue and Yellow Macaws A. ararauna ararauna
and Green-winged Macaws A chloroptera all laying eggs in January. It was
a good year for our macaws: the Green-winged and the Scarlet produced
three clutches each pair, the first two clutches from each pair being
hatched in the incubators. We have only one mature pair of Blue and
Yellow Macaws and they produced five clutches, a total of 17 eggs. These
were hatched in the incubators, and because the birds looked like nesting
again, the nest-box was closed up. So many chicks from a single pair of
macaws in one season is exceptionally high. The other macaws averaged
eight chicks per pair.
In early March, the first of the Amazon parrots produced eggs. These
were from the White-fronted Amazons Amazona albifrons albifrons. They
have been nesting here since 1979 and are always the first Amazons to
lay. Their eggs, if taken newly laid for artificial incubation, hatch within
24 days. Both the nominate race and the smaller subspecies A a. nana
produce double clutches.
Within a few days of the albifrons making a start, the Pionus come
into lay. Eggs from the Plum-crowned Parrot P. tumultuosus , the Bronze-
winged Parrot P. chalcopterus and the Coral-billed Parrot P. sordidus
corallinus are collected for artificial incubation. Their second clutches are
also taken, but the third clutches are left in the natural nest for the parents
to rear. The more common Pionus eggs are not collected for artificial in-
cubation because we cannot give time or space to these in the rearing
room.
The poorest nest was from a young pair of Buffon Macaws Ara mili-
taris ambigua. They hatched only two chicks, and since it was their first
year of parenthood, they were not permitted to have a second clutch.
During the season some 19 species of Amazon parrots were bred here.

The male Yellow-shouldered Amazon A. barbadensis barbadensis again
reared chicks, his hen being a Yellow-fronted A. ochrocephala ochro-
cephala. It is such a pity that we are unable to find a mate for him from
his own species.
The Finsch's and Parvipe are early nesting Amazons, dropping eggs
soon after the White-fronted. The Finsch's chicks at hatching have a small
beak unlike most other parrot chicks. The Parvipe chicks, although closely
related to the Double Yellow-headed, have a totally different call. It is a
delightful deep rich cluck-cluck which suits these rather large, heavy
Amazons.
The Salle's are fairly early nesting birds also, and their chicks each year
are just as spiteful as the adults. I do not know why we continue to work
with this species. In my opinion, they have little to commend them as
aviary birds. Once in good condition they become quite dangerous both
to their keeper and to each other.
It is interesting to watch a large mixed group of Amazon fledglings
feeding. Several food dishes are placed about the pen, and a truly mixed
bunch descend on the food, but all keeping well out of the way of the
Salle's Amazons who feed together. Any bird coming near their food dish
is soon sent away with a sharp peck.
Where large numbers of chicks are reared there is always a higher risk of
infection, and some zoos find it necessary to inject chicks at hatching
against pseudomonas.
The sanitant Aquasan that we use at the Sanctuary will kill pseudo-
monas, and not only is it used to wash down in the brooder room and
incubation rooms, but it is also used to wash hands and clothing before
handling chicks. Many of the household disinfectants do not kill pseudo-
monas, including the well-known brand of disinfectant used in the nursery
for washing and sterilising.
Outbreaks are usually airborne, and thrive in the warm humid condi-

tions of the brooder room. Unfeathered chicks appear to succumb more
easily than older ones. It is an airborne gram negative baccilus, and if not
treated the chicks die of septicaemia in a surprisingly short time.
There are many forms of pseudomonas, and our veterinary surgeon,
Mr. Andrew Greenwood, a member of this Society, has found the drug
Gentamicin highly successful in treating infected birds. Gentamicin is
nephrotoxic, and the patient must be kept fully hydrated using water
and electrolytes replacement therapy. Chicks at only a few days old make
a rapid recovery almost immediately after receiving the drug by injec-
tion.
Some breeders who contacted us during 1983 were also troubled by
outbreaks of Candida. This yeast fungal condition is usually first noticed
inside the mouth parts of affected hand-reared chicks and caged birds.
Candida in aviary birds is not as quickly detected, and all too often the
bird dies.
In the sanctuary the feeding of hand-reared chicks is as hygienic as we
can make it, and each chick is examined every day for Candida. The
mouth parts of the macaw chicks in particular, with their deep side
pouches, are wiped clean after every feed with a cotton wool bud dipped
in Miconazole which is supplied by our veterinary surgeon. It clears up the ;
most persistent 'deep in the crop' cases within a day or two.
This year we had some 60 young Amazon parrots and some Pionus
parrots surgically sexed, many before they were weaned. It is customary
to have this small operation carried out after the birds are a year old,
which necessitates carrying them over the year taking up aviary space
that could be put to other use.
Having our chicks sexed so young this season enabled us to keep
back unrelated birds required for breeding, and to place others where
wanted as tame young birds as soon as they were independent and before
they grew away from close human contact.
Isolated cases of misfortune and the resultant bad publicity have made
some people unsure about having their birds surgically sexed. When
approached on this subject I always give the same reply. It is said that
vetennary surgeons, like doctors, practice. Find one who has his first
1000 successful cases under his belt, and he will not be gaining his prac-
tice on your birds!
During the year we had several visitors from overseas. I would like to
mention just one - Professor S.W.J. Seagar, Associate Professor of Texas
A. and M. University, USA. He is engaged in major work with parrots
and visited the Sanctuary to learn from our project. We learnt so much
from him during his visit, and were particularly interested in his work on
artificial insemination of parrots.

and hope to work towards it some time in the near future. It was indeed
most satisfying to meet such an eminent veterinary surgeon, and exchange

SOME ASPECTS AND PROBLEMS OF
SEXUAL DIMORPHISM IN BIRDS
By DEREK GOODWIN (Petts Wood, Kent)
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990617181818181" page_id="58080014"  page_num="48" year="" vol="">
As most readers will know, birds (and other creatures) are said to be
sexually dimorphic when the male and female differ markedly from each
other in size, shape or coloration. Strictly speaking, if the only marked
difference is one of colour, as, for example, in the Bullfinch Pyrrhula
pyrrhula or the Indigo Bunting Passerina cyanea it is more correct to say
that they are sexually dichromatic. In this article, however, I shall use the
terms "sexual dimorphism" and "sexually dimorphic" to cover marked
and immediately obvious differences between the sexes, whether these in-
volve only colour; colour, size and shape as in the Pheasant Phasianus col-
chicus and Peacock Pavo cristatus; or size alone (apart from small colour
differences) as in the Watercock Gallicrex cinerea and Great Bustard Otis
tarda.
I propose to discuss some generalities and examples and indicate some
problems. Hopefully, some readers might be able to give information lead-
ing towards answers.
In some birds the sexes are identical in coloration, if allowances for
plumage state and minor individual or geographical variations are made.
Usually cocks average a little larger than hens, have proportionately
slightly larger bills and their heads will tend to have a "bolder" or "coarser"
profile but not usually sufficiently so for a single cock or hen to be sexed
on its appearance alone. The Herring Gull Larus argentatus, Speckled
Pigeon Columba guinea and Java Spanow Lonchura oryzivora are examples.

In many species, in which the sexes are often said to be alike, cocks are
in fact usually or always a little brighter than hens and/or have more
brightly coloured or differently coloured irides, orbital skin or bills, or
else have some of their feathers quite differently marked but not so as to
markedly alter their general appearance. The Common Partridge Perdix
perdix, Rock Pigeon Columba livia, Pink Cockatoo Cacatua leadbeateri ,
Great and Blue Tits Pams major and P. caemleus each come into one of
these categories.
Naturally, for Nature has no consideration for Man or Man's concepts,
there are species showing sexual differences in brightness of plumage
really too great to be classed as "a little brighter" and yet hardly warrant-
ing inclusion among those with "marked and immediately obvious differ-
ences", the Mourning Do veZenaidamacroura and the Greenfinch Carduelis
chloris for example. As, however, such of these species whose behaviour
and ecology are known do not show any differences from relatives in which
the cocks are only "a little brighter" than the hens and which can be
attributable to their greater degree of sexual dimorphism, they will, for
present purposes, be "lumped" with the latter.
That justly renowned and perhaps most readable of all Victorian
naturalists, Alfred Russel Wallace, discussed at length the correlations
between sexual dimorphism (or its absence) and breeding behaviour in
birds in one of his many most interesting books ( Natural Selection and
Tropical Nature). Inevitably I, or anyone else who now writes on the sub-
ject must repeat, probably in less felicitous words, some information
already given by him. I apologise to both his shade and my readers lor this
and to make amends urge the latter to read this and all Wallace's other
books at their earliest opportunity.
In general we find the following correlations between differences or
similarities between the sexes and the role of cock and hen in reproductive
behaviour:
(1) Where the sexes are alike or very similar in appearance, whether
they are cryptic or conspicuous, both sexes usually help to care for the
young and in many cases both sexes incubate the eggs and brood the
young.
There are, however, a number of species that are exceptions to this
general rule.
(2) Where both sexes are conspicuously coloured, even on the upper
parts , the nest is either roofed over or in some hole or other place where
the incubating bird cannot be seen from above except in the case of spe-
cies, usually large, which have few nest predators which the adults cannot

drive off and/or which nest in places where nest predators are not normally
a significant danger to the brood or the brooding or incubating parent.
The White Stork Ciconia ciconia, swans Cygnus spp., and the pied imperial
pigeons Ducula bicolor and D. spilorrhoa are examples.
Of course, these evolutionary correlations of appearance and breeding
behaviour came about long before Man reached his present numbers,
world-wide range and destructiveness. He is often a very serious predator
on birds that come into this category.
I should perhaps add that building roofed nests and nesting in cavities
may have other functions beside concealment of the incubating parent(s)
and that it is not only brightly coloured speices, like bee-eaters Merops
spp. and kingfishers Alcedo, Halycyon , etc. that do so but also many
sombrely coloured species.
(3) Where the male is very much more conspicuous than the female and
the nest is open-topped (whether cup-shaped, saucer-shaped or nearly
flat) and not concealed in a hole or cave, only the female incubates and
broods the young. The male may or may not help to feed and protect the
young. On the whole the greater the difference between the sexes, the
greater the likelihood that the male will pay little or no attention to the
young. The Golden Pheasant Chrysolophus pictus is an example of the
latter and the Bullfinch Pyrrhula pyrrhula of those in which the cock helps
to feed the young.

There are some true exceptions to this general rule but a still greater
number of apparent exceptions. In these latter the male's conspicuous
markings may be on his face, breast or underparts, where they are hidden
from view when he crouches low in alarm on the nest when he has seen,
or the alarm calls of other birds have warned him, that a bird of prey is
about. The Masked or Namaqua Dove Oena capensis is an example. Or the
male's plumage, though much brighter and more conspicuous on an open
perch may be just as cryptic as (or no more obvious than) that of the hen,
when he is sitting on a nest among vegetation. This is almost certainly the
case with many (though not all as we shall presently see) of the fruit
doves of the genus Ptilinopus. Probably also with those brightly coloured
tanagers of the genus Tangara in which the sexes are alike or nearly so,
and which, so far as is known, all build open nests.
(4) "Lek" birds, that is those species in which, during the breeding
season, the males spend much of their time displaying, in association with
others of their sex, at particular (and usually traditional) display grounds,
which are visited by the hens for mating purposes only, commonly show
extreme sexual dimorphism in size, shape or colour, often all three. The
Capercaillie Tetrao urogallus, Sage Grouse Centrocercus urophasianus,
Ruff Philomacus pugnax and Blue Manakin Chiroxiphia caudata are
examples.
There are, however, some interesting exceptions to this rule - the Calf-
bird Perissocephalus tricolor , the Screaming Piha Lipaugus vociferans
(Snow, 1982), probably also the Great Snipe Gallinago (formerly Capella
media) and some of the small, dull-coloured hummingbirds of the genus
Phaethomis. In all these species the cock advertise themselves by loud
calling and are much more vociferous than the hens but, of course, the
same is true of many "everyday" birds that form typical pair bonds.
(5) In all species in which the hens are markedly brighter (and usually
also larger) than the cocks, the hens take a very active role in couitship
and the cocks alone incubate the eggs and care for the young. The bustard-
quails Tumix, phalaropes Phalaropus and Pheasant-tailed Jacana Hydro-
phasianus chirurgus are examples.
It might be mentioned that although in most cases the more conspicu-
ously coloured sex is as big as or larger than the other, this is not invariably
so. In many birds of prey, especially some falcons Falco and sparrowhawks
and goshawks Accipiter the male is much smaller but also more brightly
coloured than the female, and in some birds of paradise the brightei male
is marginally smaller.

The above generalisations apply equally to birds in which the sexual
differences are constant throughout adult life and those in which they
depend in part or whole on a breeding plumage that is worn for only part
of the year. Included among those latter species are the Snow Bunting
Plectrophenax nivalis and Chaffinch Fringilla coelebs in which the colour
changes are brought about by a presumably genetically programmed shed-
ding of the ends of many of the head and body feathers.
Cock Snow Bunting Plectrophenax nivalis
Lett, in autumn. Right, in the breeding season. The shedding of the feather ends, the
so-called "abrasive moult" changes the bird's appearance (when not in flight) from
predominantly butfish to vivid black and white. The bill also turns from yellowish
to black.
In many cases it is very easy to deduce probable reasons for the
generalisations listed above. A more conspicuous cock incubating or
brooding would be in greater danger of both his own life and that of his
offspring, tendencies to gieater conspicuousness will soon be checked in
the hens of species in which the female incubates on an open nest and is
vulnerable to many feathered enemies. The lek system, in which the
dominant cocks who have the most central display positions copulate with
most or all of the hens, will clearly encourage or permit a degree of con-
spicuousness and increase of size that is useful in competition with other
cocks but would have too many drawbacks in a species that practiced one-
to-one pair bonds.

In these two very different birds, the striking sexual dimorphism is primarily due
to the male's enormously elongated and ornamental upper tail-coverts which nor-
mally conceal the true tail.
In the Blue or Common Peafowl (shown here) the hen is much less colourful than
the cock but the same is not true of the related Green Peafowl Pavo rnuticus.
Only peahens incubate and care for the chicks but the brilliant cock Quetzal
shares incubation "duties", but in the concealment of a tree hole nest. The ends ot
his long tail coverts may protrude from the hole and give away his presence to the
human hunter but it is likely that to any non-human predator it would be mistaken
for just one more bit of greenery in the mountain forest.

Often we find within the same family of birds some species in which
there is marked sexual dimorphism and others in which it is, respectively,
less marked, slight and virtually absent. In some of these, for example the
pheasants, partridges, etc., Phasianidae, such differences are often or
usually correlated with significant differences in breeding behaviour. But
this is not always so, or at least in our present state of knowledge appears
not to be. In describing some of these cases, I hope that readers will be
alerted to note any behavioural or ecological differences that they observe
and which might throw light on why some species have evolved a strong
degree of sexual dimorphism and others not.
Among the family Estrildidae, the waxbills, grassfinches, avadavats,
munias and their allies, we find almost every degree of sexual dimorphism,
at least as regards to coloration or lack of it. Yet, so far as we know, the
roles of the sexes in parental care are simialr in all species and all build
covered nests or else nest in holes so that the incubating parent is invisible
to a passing hawk or other predator.
Presumably in this family the advantages or disadvantages of sexual
dimorphism are not linked with the sexual roles in parental care. Sexual
differences in which the cock is largely red or brightly coloured tend to
be commonest in relatively unsocial species which live in pairs and many
in which the sexes are alike are highly gregarious. There are, however,
several exceptions. The Zebra Finch Peophila guttata, for example, is
highly social and strongly sexually dimorphic. I have elsewhere (Goodwin,
1982) suggested that there might be a premium on sexual dimorphism in
some social species if it permits quicker and more efficient pair formation
than might otherwise be the case but this is mere speculation and I hope
some of my readers will be able to offer at best definite information and
at worst fresh ideas on the subject.
It might be mentioned that the cordon-bleus show three different types
of sexual dimorphism or lack of it. In the Cordon-bleu or Blue-breasted
Waxbill Uraeginthus angolensis the sexes are almost or nearly quite alike
in colour in some populations; in others the female has less blue on her
underparts than the male. In the very closely related Red-cheeked Cordon-
bleu U. bengalus, the cock differs strikingly from the hen in having two
crimson cheek patches of which she shows not a vestige. He also has more
and usually brighter blue on his plumage, although there is a great amount
oi geographic (racial) variation in the amount, brilliance and distribution
of the blue on face, breast and flanks in hens of this species. In the Blue-
headed Cordon-bleu U. cyanocephala the cock is much brighter and more
extensively blue than the hen but does not, unlike his red-cheeked rela-
tive, possess any colour or markings, no hint of which is present in the
hen.

Observations on a few individuals (anecdotal evidence of no statistical
significance, my critics tell me) suggest that the hen Red-cheeked Cordon-
blue may have an innate sexual recognition of the cocks of her species not
possessed by hens of the other two species (Goodwin, 1971). There is,
however, nothing in what little is so far known of the ecology of the three
species to indicate why they should have evolved such differences as above
described.
The parrot family, Psittacidae, also show a wide range of sexual dimor-
phism or lack of it. In many the sexes are alike or differ only in the
colour of the iris, as in the Pink Cockatoo Cacatua leadbeateri, cere and
feet as in the Budgerigar Melopsittacus undulatus, or relatively small
areas of plumage as in the Rose-ringed Parrakeet Psittacula krameri. In
others there is marked sexual dimorphism and in a few of these, notably
the Mulga Parrot or Many-coloured Parrakeet Psephotus varius , the cock
not only looks much more conspicuous than the hen when in an aviary,
but is very much more easily seen in his natural habitat. Yet all parrots
nest in holes (No, I have not forgotten the Quaker Parrakeet, it nests in
holes within the great communal nest of bitten sticks) so it is difficult to
see why the hens should need to be more cryptically coloured than the
cocks, as the hens of the Mulga Parrot and several other species most
certainly are.
Mention must be made here of the remarkable sexual dimorphism of
the Eclectus Parrot Eclectus roratus in which the cock is brilliant green
with scarlet flank patches and (predominantly) orange bill and the hen is
mainly darkish red and purplish blue. This is often instanced as a species
in which the hen is brighter than the cock, but I fully agree with the late
Duke of Bedford (the avicultural one) who once wrote in our magazine
that he did not consider a brilliant green, scarlet and orange bird less
bright than a dull red and blue one. Observations on captive birds indicate
that in this species, as in other parrots in which the point is known, the
cockatoos and the Cockatiel excepted, only the hen sits and is led by the
cock. In the wild observations have suggested (Forshaw, 1978) that
several birds of both sexes are sometimes or usually involved with one
nest but, even if so, such sexual dimorphism is certainly not a usual
feature of species in which more than one pair attend a single nest or
its resultant young.
As with the estrildids, there is an open field for any observations that
might help us to understand why certain parrots are sexually dimorphic
and others not. I will add that although most predominantly green parrots
are very well camouflaged when among foliage, this is not always the case.
When in Australia I was surprised to find that the Budgerigar's predom-
inantly bright green and yellow plumage was highly conspicuous among

the dull greyish foliage of some of the trees of the Australian outback. The
same was true for the largely bright green Port Lincoln Parrot Barnadius
zonarius.
Within the pigeon family, Columbidae, we also find a complete range of
sexual differences and similarities of plumage. These birds differ from es-
trildids and parrots in that most of them build shallow, open nests in trees,
bushes or other vegetation. Of the relatively few species that usually nest
in holes or on ledges in caves, none are (markedly) sexually dimorphic.
The males of some of the sexually dimorphic pigeons are probably little
if any more conspicuous than the females to a passing raptor when they
are crouched "freezing" on the nest. This is hardly likely, however, to be
(or have been) the case with the Blue Ground Dove Claravis pretiosa and
the extinct Passenger Pigeon Ectopistes migratorius in which the cock has
bluish grey and the hen brown or greyish brown upper parts. Both share,
or shared, incubation in the most usual pigeon manner, the hen sitting at
night, early morning and evening and the cock during the middle hours of
the day. But the most marked sexual dimorphism seen in the pigeons is
that of the Orange Dove Ptilinopus (Chrysoena) victor in which the male
is bright orange with a greenish yellow head and the female dark green but,
strangely, with the head almost the same colour as her mate's. Recent
observations on a wild nest (W.N. Beckon, pers. comm.), on which the
cock was never seen incubating, suggest the possibility that this pigeon
may prove an exception to the general rule in that only the less conspic-
uous hen may incubate and brood. If so, it will be intriguing to discover
the parental behaviour of its close relative, the Yellow-headed Dove or
Green Do veP.(C) layardi in which both sexes are green.
A lot yet remains to be discovered about some pigeons and any avicul-
turists who breed a species whose nesting behaviour is not well known
should try to make observations on the roles of the sexes and times of
change-overs on the nest.
Unlike estrildids, parrots and pigeons, the woodpeckers, Picidae, are
seldom kept in captivity and certainly cannot be recommended as aviary
biids under any usual avicultural circumstances. They are, nevertheless, of
great interest in connection with questions of sexual dimorphism as I have
pointed out at more length elsewhere (Goodwin, 1968). For our purposes
they can be divided into wrynecks, which stand far apart from other
woodpeckers and consist ol only two closely related species in both of
which the sexes are similarly coloured ; the piculets, which are tiny tropical
woodpeckers with soft tails; and the typical woodpeckers which comprise
a great number of species, ranging from about the size of a Carrion Crow
Corvus corone to about that of a Tree Sparrow Passer montanus , spread
over the temperate and tropical parts of all continents except Australia,

and many islands adjacent to these continents. Most oi them feed entirely
or partly by "woodpecking" in trees but some feed on the ground, like our
Green Woodpecker Picus viridis and a few even nest there, in earth or clay
banks. It is this largest group that I shall refer to as "woodpeckers here.
The vast majority of woodpeckers show sexual dimorphism that
involves the cock having more red, or (less often) yellow, on his head than
does the hen. In some species the cock may only have a few red leathers
and the hen none at all, in others both sexes may have their heads largely
red but the hen with some small area brown, black-and-white, or black
that is red in the cock. In only a very few species are the sexes alike but
these few include species in which both cock and hen have an aproximately
equal amount of red on the head, as in the Red-headed Woodpecker
Melanerpes erythrocephalus and the Middle Spotted Woodpecker Picoides,
(formerly Dendrocopos) medius and Lewis' WoodpeckerAsyndesmus lewis
in which neither sex has any red (or yellow) on the head. In only three
species of woodpeckers are the sexes different without this dimorphism
involving red or yellow plumage. Only one of these, the Golden-shafted
Flicker Colaptes auratus, has any red on the head.
So far as I know, there are no observations to suggest that those wood-
peckers in which the sexes are alike, or nearly so tor in some ot them the
males are very slightly brighter than the females, differ significantly in
behaviour or ecology from their strongly sexually dimorphic relatives.
Juvenile woodpeckers usually show red or yellow on their heads in
their first plumage and very commonly are also sexually dimorphic. Often,

however, the red is differently placed to that of the adult. British readers
who have watched our commonest woodpecker, the Greater Spotted
Woodpecker Picoides ( formerly Dendrocopos ^ major will, no doubt, be
aware of a common error in books on British birds. These often state
that juveniles of both sexes have the entire top of the head red, and
accompanying pictures often show the juvenile thus, with the red extend-
ing down over the area on the nape where the adult cock has a red patch,
which is absent (black) in the hen. In fact the juvenile cock Greater
Spotted Woodpecker has no red at all on his nape where the adult male is
red. Only his forehead and forecrown (entirely black in the adults of both
sexes) are red. His sister although generally similar to him usually has the
red confined to her forehead, hardly extending on to the crown at all.
The question of juvenile plumages in the woodpeckers presents many
points of interest but I must not dilate on them here. Suffice to say that
in a few species the juveniles are without bright colours at all and that, in
general, as regards the amount of red or yellow on the head, juvenile
woodpeckers tend to come nearer to the family average than do adults.
That is in many species in which the adults have a lot of red on the head
(whether in one or both sexes) the juveniles have less and vice versa.
The typical sparrows of the genus Passer present a somewhat anala-
gous case to the woodpeckers, at least as far as the adults are concerned.
In the Yellow Sparrow Passer luteus and the Arabian Yellow Sparrow
P. euchlorus , the cocks are largely yellow in colour and the hens mainly
brown and grey. They are sometimes placed in a separate genus Auri-
passer. Most other species have a different form of dimorphism, the cocks
having a black bib, more or less (according to species) like that of our
House Sparrow P. domesticus which is lacking, or only slightly indicated,
in the hen. Usually they have other less obvious plumage differences in-
volving chestnut, rufous or golden-brown on the head and/or mantle of
the cock which is replaced by paler and/or duller shades in the hen.
The main exceptions involve both "hen-feathered cocks" and "cock-
feathered hens". The former are represented by the Grey-headed Sparrow
P griseus of Africa and some of its close relatives, the latter by our fami-
liar Tree Sparrow (and it alone) in which the sexes are alike, both having a
black bib, black cheek patches and the top of the head a purplish choco-
late colour, which fades to pale chestnut in worn plumage. The behaviour
of both House and Tree Sparrows has been well studied but nothing that I
have read of their behaviour or ecology makes it clear why the sexes
should be alike, and similar to the males of related species, in one but not
in the other. Perhaps some reader will be able to throw light on the matter?

parable sexual difference in size.
among the most intensively studied birds in the world so I will confine my-
self here to just one, possibly a little neglected aspect of sexual dimorphism
among them. This is the difference in size between the sexes, which is
slight or absent in most, rather marked in some, and striking in others,
notably in the well-known Muscovy Duck Cairina moschata and some
(though not all) of its relatives.
In Muscovies (both wild and domestic) and in the Comb Duck Sarki-
diornis melanotos the male is about twice the size of the female. Recent
studies on the Comb Duck (to which I regret I cannot find the reference)
suggested that large size in drakes had been selected for because successful
males were able to mate with more than one female.
Most (though not all) of the waterfowl that show such extreme sexual
dimorphism are hole nesters and I have always thought that difficulties
in finding tree holes that were large enough and safe enough may have
been a factor that, in an evolutionary sense, had prevented the ducks from
keeping up with their husbands in the matter of size.
Perhaps some of our waterfowl-keeping readers will give us their views
on this?

By PETER J. OLNEY (Curator of Birds)
How far the weather affects breeding results is not really known and
any correlation would be difficult to quantify accurately. Most aviculturists,
however, are usually more than willing to blame bad weather, be it too wet,
too cold, or too hot, for poor results.
Climatically 1983 was unusually interesting. A rather mild winter, with
an exceptionally mild January was followed in London by record rainfall
in April. England and Wales had the fourth wettest spring this century and
then a very hot summer, with London having its hottest weather since reli-
able records were first kept in 1840. How far all this influenced the breed-
ing of the birds in London Zoo is impossible to judge with any certainty.
There were, as always, many other factors which must have had an influ-
ence. My general impressions were that the mild winter encouraged early
display and nest building, but the wet spring caused low hatchability and a
number of prefledging deaths. Later layers and second clutches fared better
with higher fertility, relatively more successful hatchings and more success-
ful rearings. A number of birds laid early, but lost or abandoned their eggs
(e.g. Stone Curlew) or subsequently their young (e.g. African Thrush,
Lemon-rumped Tanager). Of the eggs laid by the Chilean Flamingos in the
spring, only one hatched, but of the six eggs laid in the summer, four
hatched and four were successfully reared. A similar pattern of events
occurred in the Abdim Stork colony, where, of the four first nests in the
spring, only one egg hatched, but in a later second clutch, both eggs
hatched and two young were reared.
Other parent-reared birds of note included: a Blue-crowned Motmot
from the same parents who, in 1982, reared two young; three Tarictic
Hornbills from a new breeding pair of which the male was reared here in
1979; Rock Peplar and Barraband Parrakeets in an outdoor colony of
these two species; an Oystercatcher from a pair in which the male was
reared here in 1978; Snowy Owls from a pair in which the male is at least
33 years old, having come to this collection in 1950, and fathered
48 chicks (this must be a record?) - he was rescued from the HMS Eros (!)
off the Azores, having flown on board. Other owls reared included Boo-
books, African Spotted, Abyssinian Spotted and Little Owls.
Artificial incubation and hand-rearing increases each year, even though
we have now got to the stage where we deliberately do not breed some
species because they are common enough not to be in demand. One of
the most satisfying successes in 1983 was the hand-rearing of seven South

African Crowned Cranes Balearica regulorum from three clutches incuba-
ted artificially. This success is an important development for although
cranes have been reared before in the collection, either at Regent's Park
or at Whipsnade, they have been the result of different management
techniques. Either the eggs and young have been left with the parents, or
they have been placed with domestic chickens who act as foster parents.
It has been part of our policy to concentrate efforts on crane breeding,
and this has included the building of aviaries off-public viewing at Whips-
nade. This policy, which has been immensely helped by laparoscope
sexing, appears to be succeeding. Four species - Red-crowned, Wattled,
White-naped and South African Crowned Cranes were bred at Whipsnade
in 1983.
A male Andean Condor was hatched and reared using the same proce-
dures as in 1982 when, for the first time in this country, a Condor was
reared. In 1983 the single egg was laid on 5th April, and after a few days
was removed to an incubator, where all went well until just before hatch-
ing. The egg had pipped, but because of the positioning of the beak, the
chick could not break out of the shell. On 2nd June, by carefully and
slowly removing parts of the shell with forceps, the chick was released
and emerged, healthy but rather tired-looking. He proved to be strong
and fast-growing, and somewhat larger than his sister of the previous
year.
Other artificial rearings of particular note included: two Ruffs, from
parents of which the female had been hand-reared here in 1980; five
Black-footed Penguins, which have now joined the colony of 19 birds of
which at least 12 have been bred here; an Oystercatcher; Chilean Tina-
mous, ducks, geese and many pheasants including Koklass, Swinhoe's,
Nepal Kalij, Siamese Fireback, Hume's Bar-tailed, Mikado, Scintillating
Copper, Cheer and Grey Peacock.
More and more cooperative schemes for the management and breeding
of various species are being put into effect, and as part of these schemes
a number of birds were sent to other collections, or were taken in on loan.
Examples of such movements included the despatch of 13 Lesser Flamin-
gos to the Wildfowl Trust, our male African Fish Eagle to Cricket St.
Thomas, and the receipt of two pairs of Rothschild's Grackles and a Red-
crested Turaco from Jersey.

colour plates; 4 black-and-white plates; many line-drawings and maps.
#53.40. ISBN 0.12.137301.0.
There are six volumes planned for this series (there may be a seventh on
the Malagasy region) and the aim of the authors has been to compile all
the available information about African birds, which they have found
scattered through a large, expensive, often unobtainable and now largely
out-of-date quantity of books; through the ornithological journals of
societies of many different countries, and in unpublished material such
as record card systems, collections of migration date and postgraduate
theses, as well as personal notes by the authors and many others The result
must certainly be the definitive handbook of African birds which will in-
clude every species occurring in this continent, migrants and vagrants as
well as residents. This first volume covers the orders from ostriches to
falcons.
This series was Leslie Brown's special goal and it is very sad indeed that
he did not live to see the first volume in its final form for it is a magnifi-
cent book, attractively designed and indispensable to anyone interested in
African birds.
Each resident bird has a distribution map and is described in full detail
with sections on its range and status, description, field characters, voice,
general behaviour, food and breeding biology. Visitors are also given ex-
tensive coverage.
The task of illustrating every bird has been achieved by Martin Wood-
cock and Peter Dayman in 28 colour plates. Whilst this method has its
artistic limitations (up to 40 species have been painted on some pages), the
paintings are useful and workmanlike. There are also four monochrome
plates and numerous line drawings. As one would expect, there is a superb
bibliography listing general and regional references as well as those for
each family of birds. In all, well worth saving up for.

Red and Yellow Diamond Doves
I would like to reply to Derek Goodwin's letter (Vol. 89, 1983, No. 2,
p. 121), since it was I who mentioned that red and yellow Diamond Doves
are common over here.
I just presumed that, since these two very attractive colour mutations
fetch only R20-30 a pair over here, they were common everywhere in
Europe. However, I cannot agree with Neville Brickell's description of
those he saw at Mitchell Park (a mixture of both colours and all ages).
The colours red and yellow can be likened to those same colours in the
domestic pigeon. The body colour is a little lighter grey than found in the
normal Diamond Dove, with the mantle and wings a pale yellow. Yellow
males seem to have a darker grey body colour than the females. Whereas
the red, to my mind the prettier of the two, has a light silver grey body
colour with the darker red mantle and wings. The red is a clear red, not a
brown red.
So the lighter bodied bird has the darker wings and the darker bodied
bird has the lighter wings - an attractive contrast. I can recommend them
to anyone who likes mutations.
We have other mutations here at Mitchell Park, including four colour
varieties of the Laughing Dove Streptopelia senegalensis including Pieds,
Black-eyed Whites, Cinnamons and Albinos - and there are quite a few of
these in aviaries in South Africa, also a few Pied, red and grizzle Rock

Strange though it may seem, the Avicultural Society does not possess a
complete set of all the Magazines published although we have been able to
acquire many of the missing issues in recent years. Listed below are issues
that we still require to complete the two reference sets held by the
Society, one of which is kept at the Society's offices for use mainly by the
Editor,
and the other in the joint Linnean Society/Avicultural Society

A quantity of photographs from the Avicultural Magazine, going back
some years, has been returned by the printers.
These originals will be kept in my office for six months during which
time I will be glad to hear from any authors wishing to claim their photo-
graphs and, if I have them, I will return them.
The printers have agreed that from now on they will return the origi-
nals of drawings and photographs promptly with each issue, so if authors
want to have their illustrations back eventually, would they please say so
when submitting them and print their name on the reverse of each, please?
Slides should also be named on the cardboard mount and if possible put in
some sort of protective casing as they do get so easily damaged.

Correspondence
THE AVICULTURAL MAGAZINE welcomes original articles that have not been
published elsewhere and that essentially concern the aviculture of a particular bird or
group of birds, or that describe their natural history. Articles should be preferably
typewritten, with double spacing, and the scientific names as well as the vernacular
names of birds should be given. References cited in the text should be listed at the
end of the article. Line drawings should be in Indian ink on thick paper or card;
photographs which illustrate a particular point in the article will be used where
possible and should be clearly captioned.

BREEDING PYGMY GEESE OF THE GENUS NETTAPUS
AT THE NEW YORK ZOOLOGICAL PARK
By DONALD BRUNING &amp; CHRISTINE SHEPPARD
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.953386" page_id="58080043"  page_num="77" year="" vol="">
The genus Nettapus has been kept only rarely in captive collections.
I Smallest of the waterfowl, they are generally weak competitors in a
mixed species flock. Highly aquatic, they do poorly on land and are very
vulnerable to predators. They prefer high tree hole nest sites and perches
and cannot function well if pinioned. They do not tolerate extreme cold
temperatures. This combination of factors makes pygmy geese difficult
to import and greatly limits the facilities where they can be successfully
housed and bred.
The New York Zoological Park has kept and bred two species of
pygmy geese: N. coromandelius , the Cotton Teal, and N. auritus, the

Nettapus coromandelianus coromandelianus
This is one of the smallest members of the Anseriformes. These birds
are found throughout Southeast Asia ranging from Ceylon, India and Chi-
na across Malaysia and Indonesia to New Guinea. Some populations are
quite sedentary but others, especially those in China, migrate several
hundred miles. Their flight seems awkward at times but they can manoeuvre
around trees as easily as Mandarin Ducks and their flight is quite fast. They
j normally nest in tree hollows.
Cotton Teal feed preferably among floating vegetation, with small
leaves and seeds being the major part of their diet. They roost in trees at
night but spend most of the day on the water feeding much like coots.
Although large numbers are caught each year in India these birds sel-
dom survive transportation and the dietary changes of captivity. Once

acclimatised they do live quite well in captivity if they can be kept away
from predators. One full-winged female at Cleres lived six years and even
laid two eggs in 1932 in an aviary. Another bird lived nine years in an j
outdoor aviary in England. Pinioned birds generally succumb sooner or
later to rats or other vermin. The New York Zoological Park felt quite
fortunate when a group of six were purchased from George Searles, a
private collector from Patchogue, New York, on 18th March 1971. These
birds were placed in a large heavily planted exhibit in our new World of
Birds building which was still under construction during 1971.
The birds were being fed a diet of soaked rice and millet as is generally
true of any waterfowl coming into the United States from Asia. Prior ex-
perience had shown that this diet is inadequate for any hope of keeping
these birds for a long period of time. We weighed all six birds immediately.
The average weight was 189 grams, but the birds varied from 168 to 238
grams.
We then set about altering the diet. Since the birds were eating only
soaked rice and millet we mixed a small amount of turkey pellets and
Gaines dog meal into the mixture, with a few mealworms and bits of
chopped kale added on top of each food pan. Since everything was soaked
the birds could not avoid eating some of the other items as they ate the
rice and millet. Gradually over a period of two months we increased the
amount of turkey pellets and Gaines dog meal while decreasing the
amounts of rice and millet. One of the smallest birds died after a short
period at the Zoo, but the other birds thrived on their new diet and in
their new home.
The exhibit itself is over 10 m in diameter and height. It is heavily
planted with Ficus trees and lower ground plants such as Diffenbachia,
ginger and Spathaphylum. A pool covers nearly 30 percent of the floor
area and is where the pygmy geese spend much of their time.
The young birds thrived and moulted into adult plumage early in 1972.
At this point it became apparent that we had four females and only one
male. The male was not in good condition and had a displaced wing. This
male lived for four years but was never able to mate with any of the
females. When the male died in February 1976, we began the search for a
new mate and in April 1977 we acquired two males from the Wildfowl
Trust in England. The new males immediately started courting the females.
Within a couple of months the first egg was found in the pool. A female
was regularly seen perched in the trees during the following two months.
On 28th August 1977, a clutch of two eggs was found in a beautiful
down-filled nest in a hollow tree cavity, approximately six feet (two
meters) above ground level. The female incubated until 10th September
when she was observed off the nest. When the female did not return to the

eggs within two hours, the eggs were removed and candled. Both eggs had
been fertile but apparently the female had abandoned the nest the previous
day as both embryos were dead. No further nesting activity occurred in
1977.
The female began to spend a lot of time perching in the trees during
late spring and summer of 1978 and she was observed carefully as she
nested during July. On 1st August she emerged with three ducklings. One
duckling caught its leg on the edge of the pool and was removed for over-
night observation. When the chick seemed well the following day, it was
returned to the exhibit with the female and the other two ducklings. The
third chick was unable to keep up and feed with the other chicks and it
died two days later. Quantities of live crickets and mealworms were
supplied during the month of August to supplement the adult diet. The
chicks appeared to start eating duckweed (Lemma) in a shallow pool and
it seemed to be the major item of their diet for the first few weeks. Duck-
weed was mixed with the adult diet and the chicks quickly acquired a
taste for turkey pellets and Gaines dog meal.
The two chicks grew rapidly and within six weeks were indistingui-
shable from the adult female. On 7th September, the chicks were banded
and weighed. They weighed 236 and 220 grams and seemed in good
condition.
As far as we can determine, this is the first successful breeding of this
species in captivity.
In 1979 a clutch of six eggs was laid. Six hatched and six were reared in
the original exhibit.
In 1980 a female was noted missing during the breeding season. On a
Friday, the day the female was not observed, we felt she might be nesting
but we did not want to cause a major disruption. After the female had not
been seen over the weekend we carefully searched the exhibit but found
no sign of her. We still hoped that she was carefully hidden on a nest.
J wo days later the male bird was also gone. We have never found out
what happened to the pair but have assumed that they were stolen. We
immediately instituted additional security measures, and moved the remain-
ing birds to a glass-fronted exhibit.
In 1981 a young pair produced two clutches of infertile eggs.
In 1982 the young pair produced two clutches of eggs from which six
chicks hatched. None were successfully reared in their new exhibit with a
deep pool and plenty of duckweed.
In 1983 we traded birds with Doug Goode and Mike Lubbock to pair
up our young birds. The young birds have produced a clutch of infertile
eggs.
Now we shall prepare for 1984.

The first captive propagation of African Pygmy Geese was at the pri-
vate collection of Winston Guest, on Long Island, New York. Mr. Guest
imported his birds in 1973 and two of the imported birds were donated to
the Zoo. The birds were kept in a heavily planted indoor exhibit, about
35 x 25 x 20 ft (10.68 x 7.63 x 6.10 m) . The cage floor is about 8 ft
(2.44 m) below the visitors' viewing area. The viewing area is an open
front, with plantings between it and a pool, approximately 10 ft (3 m) in
diameter and 18 in deep. There is a 10 ft planted area behind the pool.
Other exhibit inhabitants include a pair of Malayan peacock pheasants and
about 20 small passerines. The exhibit gets natural light through a skylight.
This is supplemented in winter with flood lights to provide a minimum of
12 hours of daylight.
The African Pygmy Geese laid their first clutch in September 1979.
The parents incubated and hatched one duckling from a clutch of eight.
This bird lived only one day. No eggs were laid in 1980. In 1981, 7 eggs
were laid in mid-August. Six hatched, but the parents failed to rear them.
The exhibit had been heavily supplied with duckweed. In July 1982, six
eggs were laid and all hatched on 12th August. The female was removed
and placed in a water brooder with three ducklings; the other three were
placed in a separate brooder. Because the female was too nervous, she was
placed back in the exhibit the next day, with the ducklings that had been
with her. Large amounts of duckweed were provided. Both members of
the pair then attended the young which swam and appeared to feed. All
died within the next day, however, and were found to have no food in the
gastro-intestinal tract. We had had similar problems with a clutch of Cot-
ton Teal which had appeared to be feeding well on duckweed, yet appar-
ently died of starvation. All but one remaining duckling failed to respond
to intensive efforts to induce feeding and died. The last bird fed readily
and was reared to adulthood. The pair re-nested in late September 1982
and laid six eggs. It was decided to pull these before hatching for hand-
rearing. The ducklings began to hatch at 6.00 p.m. on 18th October, and
immediately were exposed to a human hand and vocalisation to induce a
following response. A total of four ducklings hatched. They were placed
in a duck brooder measuring 8 x 4 x 2 ft (2.44 x 1.22 x 0.61 m) with a
removeable pool and adjustable heat lamp, and maintained at 85-88*F. A
heating pad was placed under the chicks after the first two days. Duck-
lings were marked with food colouring for identification and could also
be distinguished by size differences. The birds were weighed at the start
of every morning.

Early observations seemed to show that ducklings dabbling in water with
floating duckweed ingested water but that duckweed itself was of too large
a size to be ingested. Eventually, using a very shallow pan filled with a
tepid slurry of two parts powdered turkey pellets, one part powdered
Gaines dog meal and eight parts water, it was possible to induce feeding
by churning the mixture up near the chicks, simulating the action of the
parent's feet. The ducklings themselves would churn with their feet while
feeding. Initially the birds would feed only in water. Particles sifted on the
water surface in front of the ducklings could be seen to flow into the
mouth. It was necessary to add water occasionally as the food particles
absorbed moisture. New food was prepared three times a day. Approxi-
mately every two hours, nine times a day, food was presented. By vibrating
fingers through the water (about seven oscillations per second) the duck-
lings could be attracted to feed. This noise perhaps imitates the sound of
an adult dabbling. After seven to ten days it was possible to induce feeding
from the edge of the pan by generating currents of particles. The birds
still required a splashing noise or feeding would terminate prematurely.
During the first four days, while techniques were being developed, the
chicks did not eat enough to produce good weight gains. They were sup-
ported during days 5-10 by supplemental tube feeding. A mixture of one
tablespoonful of dry Gerber Hi Pro baby cereal, 1.5 gm Nutrical (a high
calorie veterinary supplement) and 17 cc water, heated to 100*F was
administered, 0.4 ml per bird, up to five times a day. Each bird was
treated differently, depending on its speed in developing self-feeding.
By the time the chicks were three weeks old, the large feeding pan had
been replaced by petrie dishes of wet feed and water and the ducklings
were swimming. None of the birds would feed itself until at least 21 days
and the last bird was about 30 days before it was feeding independently.
The feed at this time was still powdered pellets but with only so much
water as would be absorbed in half an hour.
The techniques described here represent a learning experience. Pygmy
Goose ducklings evidently are small particle strainers and most individuals
do not adapt readily to our standard rearing techniques which use dry,
crumbled pellets. It is worth noting that parent rearing (of Cotton Teal)
has been successful only in an exhibit with a shallow back pool. Failures
have taken place in exhibits with deep, well-scrubbed pools, where no
particulate matter would be available for parents to churn up for their
brood. Supplemental tube feeding was very useful in a case where diffi-
cult chicks were feeding, but not sufficiently. We hope to improve and
standardise these techniques in 1984.

By S.E. DYE (Curator of Birds) and A. MORRIS (Keeper)
In our winter programme of 1982 it was decided to rebuild a large run
of aviaries. The first to be completed was the toucan flight which was
some 20 ft by 10 ft wide with a height of 7 ft 6 in (6.10 x 3.05 x 2.29 m).
A feeding area measuring 5 ft x 4 ft x 7 ft 6 in ((1.53 x 1.22 x 2.29 m)was
built at one end, next to the service door. Perches were placed so that the
occupants had to fly the whole distance of the flight to be able to feed
from the feeding perch.
Several plants were bedded and the ground area grassed over, excluding
two small areas in which shallow water baths were placed.
A grandfather-type nest-box, the height of the aviary by 1 ft 4 in
(0.40 m), was built of 3 4 in marine ply and placed in the right hand corner
as far away as possible from the public. The entrance hole of 4 in
diameter faced the length of the aviary. An inspection door 2 ft from the
base was included and, to help conceal the box from the public, bamboo
was planted around it.
While the aviaries were being completed, a hen Toco Toucan which had
laid in previous years was being housed in an aviary alongside our tropical
house, where she could easily be shut in at night if the weather turned bad.
This bird had always been in excellent condition throughout our time
working at the park.

As the new aviaries were nearing completion, we took the opportunity
of buying a newly-imported male that had been surgically sexed. The bird,
a fine specimen, was heavily clipped on its left wing by trappers after being
caught, which slowed him down considerably.
He arrived at the park on 28th February 1983 and was kept on his own :
for two weeks so that we could observe his behaviour and feeding habits.
All proved satisfactory so, on 15th March, he was moved to an aviary
adjacent to the hen's. This went well but a period of very wet weather
forced us to lock them inside for a couple of days. When the weather did
break, the birds were let out in the early morning and at once the male
displayed to the hen. After several mornings this became a routine with
the hen responding at times by clapping her beak and calling to the male.
The nest-box in the new aviary was being made ready by the placing of
nesting material which consisted of 9 in of wood shavings and then 1 ft of
peat, followed by another 9 in of rotten wood shavings. This was repeated,
layer upon layer, until within 4 in of the hole.
On 13 th April both birds were released into their new aviary, where-
upon the visual differences between the sexes became apparent. Princi-
pally it is the larger bill size of the male but he also has a larger black spot
at the tip of the bill and a bolder black marking at the base; it was also a
darker shade of orange towards the tip. There was also a slight difference
noted in the call of the male.
By midday all was going well and there was no signs of stress or fighting
between the birds and both had found the feeding area with little trouble.
The diet offered consisted of a softfood which is made fresh every day
in the paik for all our softbilled birds. This consists of a basic mixture of
brown bread, grated carrot, apple and turnip or swede when in season; a
small amount of dried insect mix is added plus crushed Diet A pellets and
SA 37 multi-vitamin powder.
The toucans receive one 9 in round dish and two 4 in hang-on type
dishes, placed either side of the feeding perch. In the morning these are
filled with oui softfood mix plus chopped fruits such as apple, banana,
pear, grapes and a small amount of orange, and other fruits when in season
Mealworms are given as is a small amount of minced meat or sausage meat,
rolled into small balls. Chopped day-old chicks are fed twice weekly.
Mice are also given. Dishes are topped up mid-afternoon with dried insect
mixture.
By 15th April both birds were observed in and out of the nest-box and
the hen was seen to drop nesting material some 16 ft from the nesting
aiea. The box was checked on 20th May and it was found that about
~ ^ 9 in of the nesting material had been removed. Both birds were seen
to visit the nest over the next 10 days and mid-afternoon on the 30th

attempted mating took place. A display routine was performed which
consisted of bill clapping and the moving of the head and bill simul-
taneously by both birds in the same direction. Calls were very aggressive.
The box was checked again on 5th May and found to have a small
scrape about 3 in wide but there seemed to have been no more nesting
material removed. By the 19th the hen looked very swollen around the
vent and a close watch was kept on both her and the box. Both birds were
seen to leave the nest very early on the morning of the 22nd and inspec-
tion revealed one egg. The hen was observed to enter the nest for short
spells only for the remainder of the day.
Next day, the hen stayed in the box for most of the morning, only
vacating to feed. Another inspection revealed a second egg and at this
stage the cock became very aggressive. Each time the hen left to feed ;
the male would take up a position in front of the entrance hole as if
he was on guard until she returned.
She stayed in the box ah day on the 24th, apart from feeding in the
early evening. An inspection next day revealed a third egg and this was
taken to be a full clutch. The eggs are white in colour. From 25th May
to 8th June very little was seen of the hen other than the 20 minutes or
so when she left to feed. Food intake increased on 8th June and over the
next four days the male spent short spells in the nest-box and, as the hen
was seen very little over this period, it was thought that he was feeding her.
The hen was away from the nest for long periods on 12th June and the
male was taking little interest so it was decided to investigate. To our dis-
appointment no eggs were found but shells picked up at the base of the
box showed signs of having formed chicks in them. Incubation period was
in the region of 21-22 days for the first egg laid.
It was a disappointment to all concerned with the breeding but the box
has been reset and we are hopeful of success in the future.

The Hooded Siskin is a very active and colourful little bird (about
4 in/ 10 cm) and, according to the scant literature available, is long-lived;

an eight- or nine-year old hen breeding successfully being not uncommon.
The cock is vermilion red on the breast and rump. The back is similarly
coloured and marked with black pencilling. The head, upper parts of the
neck, tail and wing feathers are all black and the flights bear the charac-
teristic red colour flash.
The hen, although less briliantly coloured, is, nonetheless, very
attractive, being mainly grey throughout with flashes of red on the rump,
the upper breast and the face. The wings display the characteristic red
wing flash as in the cock.
Three years ago, I managed to acquire a pair of these delightful birds
and after having had them for about five months, I put them together in
early April as they were showing signs of wanting to go to nest. The cage
used was the box-type version and its dimensions were approximately
4 x 2 x 2 ft (1.22 x 0.70 x 0.70 m). I fixed a canary nest-pan high up in
one of the corners of the cage and provided the usual nesting materials
given to canaries. The hen subsequently went on to lay two clutches; one
of four and the other of six eggs. The eggs were laid on consecutive days
and were smaller in size than a canary egg, being chalk white in colour and
very similar to those of the Bengalese. Unfortunately, all ten eggs were
clear and later on that year the cock died, followed by the hen two
months later. Although I was extremely disappointed, this fleeting exper-
ience made me more determined than ever to be successful with the Black-
Hooded Red Siskin. The opportunity would come my way much sooner
than I thought.
In January 1983 I was extremely fortunate to acquire, through a local
dealer, a cock and two hens. The two hens were kept together in the
previously mentioned box-cage and the cock was housed in a smaller cage
by himself. I installed a tubular heater in order that the temperature did
not fall below 70*F. With the aid of artificial lighting, "daylight" was
gradually extended to 15 hours.
On 13 th February a nest was placed in each of the four corners of the
box cage. Following the very welcomed advice of a local British bird
breeder , the nests were "natural" and provided plenty of privacy for the

birds. The nest-pans were suspended from the cage roof by wire frames
which were surrounded by plenty of foliage. Nesting material was also
provided.
By this time the two hens were becoming increasingly aggressive to-.
wards each other and on 15th February I removed one of the hens and
introduced the cock bird into the breeding cage. The pair soon settled
down and the cock was seen feeding the hen. The following day the cock
was seen entering one of the nests on repeated occasions and distinctly
"calling" the hen from within the nest. When he emerged from the nest,
the cock would have nesting material held firmly in his beak with his
plumage all puffed out in display. He would then break into an arduous
song and chase the hen who would invariably ask to be mated. Within
two days the nest was ready and on 23rd February, exactly a week after
they had been paired up, the first egg was laid. The following day, how-
ever, disaster struck. The hen was found lying on the cage floor and it was
only too apparent that she was eggbound. Oil was applied liberally round
her vent and then she was placed in a show cage situated near the heater.
Thankfully, a few hours later the egg was passed. The hen, however, was
in very poor condition after this ordeal and was placed on her own in a
flight cage to recover. The eggs were placed under a canary hen and turned
out to be addled.
Two days later, on 26th February, the second Siskin hen was introduced
to the cock and they mated immediately. The same general behaviour was
observed as with the first hen. In this instance, however, the cock was
much more dominant and I believe this can be attributed to the fact that
the second hen had been introduced into "his" territory whilst in the first
pairing, it had been the reverse.
On 3rd March the first egg was laid and this was followed by four more
on consecutive days. The eggs were removed as they were laid and replaced
with plastic dummy eggs. The hen did not seem to mind this daily intrusion
and would return to her nest a few moments after the exchange of eggs
was effected. On 8th March the clutch was set and throughout the incuba-
tion period the hen was rarely seen out of her nest. The cock was always
in attendance and on numerous occasions was seen feeding the hen in the
nest.
On 20th March, one chick hatched and I decided to foster it out to a
pair of canaries which were proven feeders. The following day a second
Siskin chick hatched and was left with its parents. By 23rd March it was
apparent that the fostered chick was not doing too well and, in fact, it
required to be hand-fed at approximately hourly intervals. Two days later
this chick's condition had deteriorated considerably and, more in hope
than anything else, I returned it to the Siskin hen. The following day a

quick look at the nest revealed that the two chicks were alive and making
progress. The change in condition of the chick which had been fostered
was unbelievable! Everything continued to go well and on 29th March,
when the chicks were eight and nine days old, I inspected the nest
again. Both chicks were already nearly fully-feathered. Their plumage
was rich yellowish brown on the chest with black flights and tails. The
characteristic red wing flash was brown.
On 5th April both chicks left the nest and a week later were seen
eating millet spray on their own. By this time the hen had started to
build another nest and the cock was becoming increasingly aggressive
towards the chicks. On 16th April, at the age of 25 and 26 days, the
Siskin chicks were removed and placed in a stock cage, together with
two canary chicks which had also been separated from their parents on
the same day. The chicks were soon picking up food and were weaned
without any problems.
On 20th April, the first egg of the second round was laid and this
was again followed by a further four eggs. The same routine followed as
in the first round and on 6th May three chicks hatched. All went very
smoothly and on 12th May the three chicks were close-rung. As a matter
of interest, one of the chicks (which subsequently turned out to be a hen)
was smaller than its siblings and needed to be rung again two days later
as the original ring had slipped off. On 22nd May, when they were 16 days
old, the three chicks left the nest and on 1st June they were separated
from their parents. The following day I noticed that the three chicks were
not feeding themselves properly. I was tempted to return them to their
parents but decided against this form of action as the cock bird had al-
ready become very aggressive towards the chicks. Instead, I removed the
hen from the breeding cage and put her in the same stock cage with her
chicks. Much to my relief, she started feeding them immediately.
The first Siskin hen, which had become eggbound, was now fully
recovered and on 4th June I introduced her again into the breeding cage.
The cock mated immediately and five days later the hen laid the first of
three eggs. I had noticed that the hen was not sitting on the dummy eggs
and consequently decided to place the three Siskin eggs under a canary
hen which had previously reared four chicks when paired to an F 9 Siskin
hybrid cock. Unfortunately no chicks hatched from the three eggs, one
being addled and the other two dead in shell.
By early August it was obvious that I had bred four Siskin cocks and
one hen. When they started to lose their juvenile plumage, black specks
appeared around the head and neck of the young cock birds. When in
juvenile plumage there is no difference between the sexes although the
hen I bred was definitely smaller than her brothers.

As a general observation, I should say that not once did I see the Siskin
cock feed the chicks, either at the nest or when they had fledged. He
would, however, feed the hen tirelessly. The Siskin hen was an excellent
feeder and on the few occasions she left the -nest for more than a few
minutes, the cock would make sure that she soon returned to her duties!
The basic diet of my Siskins consists of a combination of canary mix-
ture and a British finch mixture. To this I add a teaspoonful per bird of
niger and condition seed. Maw seed and small millet are sprinkled over the
mixture. I also pass dog "Meat Munchies' through a coffee grinder and
sprinkle some of the resulting "meat powder" over the seed mixture.
A sprinkling of insectile food is also added. A millet spray is provided
for each bird and this is really enjoyed. Lettuce leaves and apples are
favourites and a bath is provided two or three times a week. When
the chicks were being reared I offered the adult birds some soaked seed,
grated cheese, hard-boiled egg and various proprietary canary-rearing
foods. The birds did not show any interest in these foods and the
practice was discontinued. When the young were in the nest four or five
millet sprays were consumed every day, together with half an apple and
a considerable amount of thoroughly washed lettuce leaves which the
birds really relish. When the chicks hatched, livefood was offered in the
form of ants' eggs, small mealworms and termites. The first two were not
taken but, for the first five days after her chicks hatched, the Siskin
hen consumed large numbers of termites. After the fifth day the rate of
consumption dropped considerably and by the seventh or eighth day the
hen would no longer be interested in this valuable source of protein.
In order to increase fertility, a Vitamin E solution is added to the drink-
ing water twice a week.
As a result of last year's success I now possess five cocks and three
hens. At the time of writing, the three hens have already been paired up
(a young cock with his mother, the young hen with her father and a young
cock with the unrelated flighted hen). All three hens have now built their
nests and should begin laying their first eggs within the next few days. As
you can imagine, I am really looking forward to breeding more of these
birds and the knowledge of the very real danger of their extinction has
given an added impetus to my determination to achieve my ambition of
building a free-breeding stud of Black-hooded Red Siskins.

There appears to be very little of detail written on the breeding in
captivity of the Chestnut-breasted Finch. The few books which mention
the species give only vague details and all emphasise that these finches
will not breed under cage conditions.
It is obvious that the authors of certain titles which have been pub-
lished over the past few years not only have not bred Chestnut-breasted
Finches, but have not kept up to date with the avicultural literature.
Otherwise they would surely have been aware that the species is fre-
quently being bred under cage conditions.
Not all aviculturists have facilities for aviaries and one wonders how
often such people have been deterred from keeping a species through
reading misleading statements made in what they presume to be up-to-
date books.
Nowadays I specialise in breeding Gouldian Finches Chloebia
gouldiae , but to add a little more interest each season, I do keep and
attempt to breed from one or two pairs of a different species. Last season
I decided on Chestnut-breasted Finches.
First nest
A guaranteed pair was purchased in June (1983) and immediately
housed in a box cage 91x41x41 cm. The birds proved rather shy, due
no doubt to having previously been housed in an aviary. They never com-
pletely lost their shyness, although the young they produced, once in adult
plumage, proved most confiding.
Before the birds were released into their cage, a nest-box was hung in
the right hand rear corner of the cage. The birds roosted in this from the
beginning. Soft hay had been placed in the nest-box, but within a matter
of days the birds had removed most of it and appeared to be searching
around the cage for nesting material.
As both birds took a keen interest in the nest-box, I collected some
newly-mown grass from the verge of a country lane. This appeared more to
the birds' liking and within a matter of days, the pair had built a globe-
like structure inside the nest-box. Within five weeks of purchase, the
Chestnut-breasted Finches had five eggs. They appeared to take little
interest in them, however, and because of this I removed the eggs and

placed them under Bengalese, giving the latter's clutch to the Chestnut-
breasted. It was most fortunate that I did this as, within three days, the
Chestnut-breasted had begun to incubate the Bengalese eggs in earnest
and I was able to return their own clutch to them, giving the Bengalese
eggs back to their rightful owners.
As already mentioned, the Chestnut-breasted Finches were rather shy
and because of this, whenever I entered the birdroom, whichever bird
was incubating at the time would immediately leave the nest. Be this as
it may, all five eggs duly started to hatch 12 days after incubation and
within two days all five had hatched successfully.
As this was the first time that I had attempted to breed Chestnut-
breasted Finches, I decided to make a photographic record of the growth
of the chicks and when they were four days old, I removed the nest-
box, opened the hinged lid and photographed the chicks for the first
time.
When the chicks were seven days old, the parent birds ceased to brood.
From experience with a further nest, I feel that this was a little early.
However, we were experiencing extremely warm weather at the time and
this no doubt had some influence on the parent birds.
As I always close-ring Gouldian Finches at 10 days old, I fully expec-
ted the Chestnut-breasted Finch chicks to be ready at the same age.
However, upon inspecting them at nine days, I found they were a little
large for close-ringing and experienced great difficulty in doing so.
Indeed one of the chick's toes bled during the operation.
By the time the chicks were 19 days old, the cock was seen to court
the hen continually and mating was seen to take place on numerous
occasions.
The chicks left the nest-box at 22 days. This I felt was a little prema-
ture and believe it was due to my accidentally knocking the nest-box while
feeding the birds, as the moment I touched the nest-box, the youngsters
exploded from it. However, it appears that the Chestnut-breasted chicks
do leave the nest at this age (see second nest). Due no doubt to the
chicks leaving the nest-box through disturbance, they did not return to
it for a couple of days, but spent most of the time sitting on top of it.
Newly fledged chicks are quite small, being nowhere near the size of
an adult. Indeed they do not appear to attain full adult size until they
have completed their first moult (from immature to adult plumage).
Not only are newly fledged chicks quite small, their plumage is far
from complete, the tail feathers being very short and pin feathers abound,
especially around the head and neck.
At five weeks of age, the chicks were removed from their parents and

placed in a large box cage 1.8 m x 41 cm x 41 cm. They settled well and,
due no doubt to being away from the rather shy parent birds, became
quite steady. At eight weeks a youngster was seen to sing for the first
time. It was immediately caught up and fitted with a split ring. Four weeks
later, two more were observed singing and these too were fitted with split
rings. All the first round chicks were in full adult plumage by the time
they were 16 weeks old.
Second nest
After removing the first round chicks from their parents, the breeding
cage was thoroughly cleaned. The nest-box was also cleaned, refilled with
fresh hay and placed in position.
The pair were so eager to go to nest again that they accepted the hay
placed in the nest-box, adding only a little extra from the small amount
placed on the floor of the cage. Within a day of removing the first round
chicks, the breeding pair had one egg. Three days later they began to incu-
bate. Both birds sat more "tightly" than they had with their first round
(due no doubt to becoming more used to me and to their surroundings).
Upon checking the nest-box two days after incubation commenced, they
were found to have a clutch of five.
Thirteen days after incubation commenced, a chick was found on the
floor of the far corner of the cage. It had not been fed and appeared to be
about 24 hours old. I placed it in the nest-box and the parent birds
appeared to accept it. However, two days later, the cock was seen to
push the now dead chick through the bars of the cage where it fell to the
birdroom floor.
As it was obvious that the chick had never been fed, I decided to check
the nest-box. Three chicks were in evidence; two with food in their crops
and one obviously newly-hatched. The fifth egg proved infertile and was
removed.
Two of the chicks were close-ringed eight days after hatching and the
remaining chick two days later. The parent birds ceased to brood on the
same day as the last chick was close-rung. At 22 days the chicks left the
nest-box for the first time, but returned to roost during the night period.
Two days later the hen had begun her third clutch. As the chicks roosted
in the nest-box, I decided to leave it in position even though I did not
want the parent birds to rear a third round. When the hen had completed
her clutch (again of five), I removed the eggs, placed them under Bengalese
and gave the Chestnut-breasted infertile Bengalese eggs to incubate.
When the chicks were 33 days old, the cock was seen to attack them
rather severely and the following day I removed them, at the same time
removing the nest-box to allow the adult pair to rest and moult.

Three of the five eggs hatched under Bengalese and the chicks were

Diet
The staple diet supplied to my Chestnut-breasted Finches consists of
Pearl White Millet, Panicum Millet and Plain Canary, all supplied in sepa-
rate dishes. Spray millet is available permanently as is oyster shell, lime-
stone and mineral grit. A piece of cuttlefish "bone" is attached to the cage
front permanently and flaked cuttlefish "bone" is supplied at least twice a
week to non-breeding birds. For breeding birds, especially when chicks are
in the nest, flaked cuttlefish bone is offered two or three times daily as at
such times the birds appear to relish it. A dish of soaked seeds (consisting
of one part Budgerigar mixture to one part Plain Canary seed) is given
daily. Non-breeding birds take only small amounts, but pairs with chicks
take the seeds avidly and are, therefore, offered as much as they will con-
sume.
Non-breeding birds appear to take no interest whatsoever in live food,
yet will take up to 40 mealworms each day when breeding. I find it prefer-
able to kill the mealworms (by nipping off their heads) before offering
them to the birds, otherwise the birds often drop them on the floor of the
cage and the mealworms then crawl away before they can be eaten. Meal-
worm pupae are taken avidly and when I have plenty of these, I feed them
exclusively.
Thoroughly washed lettuce is given to a breeding pair at least twice a
day; non-breeding birds are supplied only every other day. The only ad-
dition to the above diet is Vitaflight C, which is added to the drinking
water at all times and once or twice a week a teaspoonful of Kilpatrick's
Iodised Minerals (for pigeons) is placed on the floor of the cage.
Song and display
Chestnut-breasted Finch cocks are extremely vocal and can be heard
(and seen!) singing for hours at a time. Some cocks will even sing while in-
cubating. Peering was observed in immature birds, but this activity is not
nearly so pronounced as in the Gouldian Finch and once the Chestnut-
breasted reach maturity, the activity ceases.
The display of the cock Chestnut-breasted Finch consists of the back
and rump feathers being raised; the feathers of the lower breast and belly
are also puffed out. The cock stands sideways on the perch, facing the
hen, and bobs up and down, singing all the time. At no time do the feet
leave the perch. After a few moments, the hen will crouch and solicit by
quivering the tail. The cock then mounts immediately and copulation
takes place.

When wild-caught Australian finches were exported from their country
of origin, no doubt many could not be induced to breed successfully in a
cage. However, as there has been a total ban on the exportation of birds
from Australia since 1960, the birds in our collections have obviously been
bred under captive conditions for many generations. Many of the Austra-
lian finches are now almost fully domesticated (the Gouldian Finch espe-
cially) and it is obvious that many that were considered in the past to be
unsuitable for cage-breeding, could no doubt be induced to nest and rear
young if housed in a fairly roomy box cage.
From the experiences of other aviculturists as well as my own, it is
obvious that the Chestnut-breasted Finch can be cage-bred. A good basic
diet of clean seeds is essential, plus the additions already mentioned
above. It is debatable whether or not live food is essential as the three
chicks from the third round of my pair were successfully reared by Benga-
lese without live food being offered. However, the Chestnut-breasted pair
was seen to hunt around their cage immediately the chicks hatched. This
activity ceased the moment live food, in the form of mealworms (or meal-
worm pupae) was offered.
It is often stated that Chestnut-breasted Finches are almost impossible
to sex visually. I do not agree with this, but will refrain from describing
what I consider are plumage differences between the sexes as I feel it may
not prove entirely infallible. The obvious way to sex the species is by the
song of the cock. If this is done when young birds start to moult into
adult plumage, the birds can easily be distinguished from each other as no
two moult out in exactly the same way and if a split ring is fitted to all
birds observed singing, these can be used for future reference.
Many breeders have mentioned that they find it difficult to dispose of
surplus stock. I am certain that if they took the trouble to sex their young
birds, then they would sell them much more readily.

Nectarinia (Chalcomitra) amethystina amethystina
By F.C. BARNICOAT
(Johannesburg. Republic of South Africa)
The South African National Cage Bird Association's medal for the
breeding of the year has just been awarded to Mr. Jack Scheepers of the
Natal coastal town of Amanzimtoti for his breeding of the Black Sunbird
in January 1983. This is a well deserved achievement in a lifetime devoted
to avicultural pursuits which has taken Jack Scheepers far afield in a num-
ber of different countries in Africa. The breeding took place in a large
aviary, 17 x 10 x 3 m high, constructed of nylon shade cloth of 60% shade
strength. One end consists of an artificially constructed rock cliff with
waterfall and a stream winds through the aviary, which is attractively
planted with a wide variety of plants including leonotis, tree-ferns, brome-
liads, anthuriums and orchids which thrive in the subtropical climate of
the coastal region of Natal.
One male and three female Black Sunbirds were housed in this aviary
with a mixed collection of small seedeaters and softbills for about 18
months. The male suddenly turned aggressive and slaughtered all other
birds in the aviary except the three females of his own species and the few
quail. It was while this tragic occurrence was being investigated that the
pear-shaped pendulous nest was first discovered attached to a length of a
type of Brazilian air-plant known colloquially as "old man's beard", sus-
pended from the roof of the aviary. No further nest inspection was carried
out for fear of causing the birds to desert.
The nectar mixture is prepared approximately to the following recipe:
</bodyText>

The mixture is kept under refrigeration for up to two days and is success-
fully used lor a collection of some 17 sunbirds in another very large aviary,
including the Greater Double-collared, Lesser Double-collared, Grey, White-
bellied and Marico. The Olive Sunbird is the best one of all as a character,
but has proved too aggressive to keep with any other sunbird, even in a
very large aviary.

The breeding of the Black Sunbird, however, was totally dependent for
its success upon a large supply of live-food. Approximately 200 spiders a
day, for which several persons searched diligently on Mr Scheepers large
property, were provided and these were supplemented by a supply of
flying ants, which had been deep frozen and several fruit fly cultures in the
aviary. The single nestling grew rapdily and was a grey-brown colour, very
like its mother, when it left the nest. I viewed it in May, by which time a
small patch of the irridescent black colour had appeared at its throat, prov-
ing it to be a male. It was doing well in the large aviary with the other sun-
birds.
The parents were encouraged to repeat their success, and went down to
nest twice more. On both these occasions there were two youngsters and
the view is that possibly this was their undoing because it was not possible
to keep pace with the enormous amount of livefood required to feed two
babies simultaneously. Another disadvantage was that the supply of frozen
flying ants had been exhausted by the first baby. Unfortunately the babies
died when they were just beginning to feather. No doubt there will be
renewed efforts to succeed again when the summer comes.

described and, to this author's knowledge, has never before been bred in
captivity.
The Red-winged Laughing Thrush (also known as the Crimson-winged
Laughing Thrush) is found in pairs or small flocks in the mountainous
areas of Szechwan and Yunnan Provinces in western China. It is a mono-
morphic, thrush-like bird measuring 10.5 in (26.5 cm) in length. Its dis-
tinguishing characters are blood-red primaries and upper tail, with a grey
crown streaked with black. The body colour is a rufescent olive-brown.
Favoured habitat is forest undergrowth up to timberline, above which it
can be found in the low bushes which surround alpine meadows.
The San Diego Zoo acquired two flocks of wild-caught Red-winged
Laughing Thrushes, numbering seven and ten birds, from the Chengdu
Zoo, Szechwan Province, People's Republic of China, in August 1981 and
January 1983. During the 30-day quarantine period in the San Diego Zoo
hospital, the intial group of seven birds was treated with Pyrantel Pamoate
for nematodes, and the subsequent shipment of ten birds was treated with
Bithionol and Albendazole for flukes and sulphadimethoxine for coccidia.
All birds survived quarantine and were released for exhibit without mishap.
The flock was divided into four groups which were introduced to four
aviaries of various dimensions: two birds in an exhibit measuring 18 ft
x 15 ft x 7 ft (5.4 m x 4.5 m x 2.1 m); six birds in an exhibit measuring
40 ft x 15 ft x 15 ft (12 m x 4.5 m x 4.5 m); five birds in a walk-through
aviary of 12.000 square feet (1,080 square metres); and four birds in a
walk-through aviary of 8,000 square feet (712 square metres). All four
exhibits also house other bird species indigenous to Southeast Asia and
are variously planted with shrubs and trees found from that geographic
region.
This species captive diet consists of a "standard soft-bill pan" which
contains chopped fruits (apples, oranges, tomatoes, grapes, raisins, papa-
yas), chopped greens (romaine lettuce or spinach), moistened protein-meal
(trout chow, milled dog food, mockingbird meal, shrimp meal), blueberries,
and Zu-preem Bird of Prey Diet. Vionate multi-vitamin is sprinkled on the
chopped fruit. Also available, in a pan primarily for the gallinaceous birds
sharing the aviary, are mixed grains and pheasant pellets, from which the
Red-winged Laughing Thrushes are often seen feeding. There are daily
offerings of live crickets or mealworms. In all four aviaries, but especially
in the walk-throughs, naturally occurring live food is available in the form
of earthworms, moths, crickets, caterpillars and subterranean larvae, all I
of which have been observed as prey items for the constantly foraging
Laughing Thrushes. A common sight is three or four Red-winged Laughing
Thrushes energetically turning over leaves in the litter in search of inver-
tebrate prey.

During the latter part of 1981 and for the entire year of 1982, no nest-
ing activity was observed, although in all four flocks it appeared that all
the Red-winged Laughing Thrushes were compatible, often seen allo-
preening, and singing in duet. Their vocalisations are varied and musical,
with the most common song being best described as sounding like a two-
note police whistle.
In March 1983, a flurry of Red-winged Laughing Thrush nesting acti-
vity began in all four aviaries, involving what is thought to be, at most, six
pairs of birds. In all, 11 nests were built, being begun or observed on the
following dates: 3rd March, 15th March, 17th March, 18th April, 1st
May, 3rd May, 26th June, 27th June, 29th June, 1st July, 21st July. Nests
were built of dried grasses, bark fibres, pine needles, and bamboo leaves in
varying quantities, according to availability, in each exhibit. Nest form was
a bulky cup affair, measuring approximately IVi in (18 cm), in diameter,
5 in (12 cm) in height and 3 in (IVi cm) from nest lip to nest floor. The
highest nest from the substrate was about 6 ft (1.8 m), while the lowest
was about 3 ft (0.9m), with an average height of about 5 ft (1.5 m) for all
11 nests. Eight of the nests were built in Golden Bamboo Phylostachys
aurea , two were built in young Pomelo Citrus grandis , and one nest was
built in a freely attached nest basket. It appears that when and where avail-
able, Golden Bamboo is the nest site of choice. Nest materials are woven
around and between the Vi in to 1 in (1.3 cm to 2.5 cm) stems of the
bamboo, incorporating the bulk of the bamboo clump into the matrix of
the nest itself. Wherever available, bamboo leaves were used as the finish-
ing material to form the interior lining of the nest chamber.
Eggs were laid in eight of the eleven nests; two with one egg, five with
two eggs, and one with three eggs. Fertility was confirmed in only three
nests, three clutches disappeared without apparent cause (predation, auto-
predation?) and two clutches were incubated for 21+ days, abandoned and
determined to be infertile. In one of the fertile clutches (of one egg), the
embryo died in the egg prior to pipping. The eggs are typically oval-
shaped, with a smooth semi-glossed blue surface. They are richly spotted
with tear-shaped streaks the colour of dried blood, becoming more densely
marked toward the broad end of the egg. The four eggs measured had
average dimensions of 1.16 in x 0.86 in (2.97 x 2.20 mm).
In the two nests which produced young, the incubation period was
estimated to be 16 to 17 days. In all cases in which eggs were involved,
both parents shared in incubation duties. In the two cases in which young
were hatched (one hatchling and two hatchlings), both parents proved to
be diligent parents, sharing brooding time and foraging time, making
innumerable forays in search of live food for the chicks. Mealworms and
crickets were offered to the parents three to five times daily, along with

the daily "soft-bill" pan. Supplementary, naturally occurring live food was
always available. Characteristically, the parent birds would line up the in- ,
vertebrate prey in their beaks until full, before returning to the nest. Up to
a dozen mealworms were counted on one occasion in the parent s beak,
which were ultimately shoved into the nestling's waiting gape. The chicks
feather rapidly and fledge from the nest after 15 to 16 days. They remain
near the nest, clinging to surrounding twigs while being fed by the parents.
Eight days after leaving the nest, the chicks begin turning leaves, actively
searching for invertebrate prey, but remain dependent on the parent birds
for the majority of their diet for two to three weeks after leaving the nest.
One chick was attacked ten days after fledging by a second pair of Red-
winged Laughing Thrushes which was beginning to exhibit nest-building
behaviour. This chick was removed from the exhibit, and was hand-fed for
14 days, but ultimately died from its injuries. It is recommended that in
aviaries with limited resources (space, vegetative cover, nest sites and
material) nesting pairs of Red-winged Laughing Thrushes should be kept to
a minimum to prevent intra-specific aggression between nesting birds and
fledglings. Both pairs that successfully fledged young returned to nest
within one to two weeks after the chicks were self-sufficient. However, in
one nest the eggs disappeared, and in the other nest the eggs were infertile
and abandoned.
In view of the restrictions imposed on the exportation of nearly all of
mainland China's avifauna, it is hoped by the staff of the San Diego Zoo
that this recently established group of Red-winged Laughing Thrushes will
serve as the nucleus of a breeding flock. Successful breeding in the forth-
coming seasons will provide future generations of this handsome Laughing
Thrush to other aviculturists and zoos that are interested in keeping such a
charming songster.

Pyrrhura molinae
By Dr. W. MERCK
(Hamburg, Germany)
I received a pair of these conures in October 1981. The dealer had
offered to find a true pair from his stock by endoscopy, but the birds
seemed to me to be too small and slight for such an operation. Then
the dealer undertook to try to select a pair by his judgement, and he
was later proved right
As far as I know, up to that time this species was hardly ever impor-
ted into Germany but since then, they have been available occasionally.
The male and female are identical in colour but the behaviour of
my male is rather livelier and less shy, though the hen is not all that
timid. The cock feeds the hen from time to time out of the breeding
season.
The colouring is as follows: crown and nape dark grey, the latter
tinged with light blue, ear coverts greyish white, cheeks green, throat
and sides of neck whitish grey with feathers edged grey, upper breast
feathers edged with light brown, upper tail coverts tinged with light
blue, under tail coverts blue-green, primaries blue, tail on both sides
copper red, the remaining plumage green, bill and feet greyish-black.
I presume that my birds are of the race sordida as they do not have
any red on the abdomen, apart from a few hardly visible reddish feathers
(Arndt, 1983).
As with most of the other Pyrrhura species, the plumage is
not as strikingly brilliant as with so many other parrots, but in
their discreet colour composition and elegant shape, the
molinae make a charming picture, especially when the sun is
shining on them - which, by the way, they like if it is not too
intense. As their aviary is not shaded by trees, I put some
foliage on the wire over their favourite perching places. When a
group of these conures is flying, displaying their deep blue
wings, it is an especially pretty sight.
Green-cheeked Conures are lively birds, on the wing much of
the time and they are skilful climbers. In their ability to run fast
up and down the wire they resemble the Cyanorhampus parra-
keets. Branches for chewing are essential and very much appre-
ciated, whereas old wood, such as the aviary frames are made
of, is hardly touched.

The aviary measures 4 x 1.5 x 2 m (13 ft 2in x 5 ft x 6ft 6 in).The
attached shelter, measuring 1.5 x 1.5 x 2 m (5ft x 5ft x 6ft 6 in), can
be only moderately heated and in times of severe frost, the temperature
may drop to +3*C. Sometimes the parrakeets go down on the ground,
which is partly turfed.
These birds do not have a loud screech and only become a little
noisier when they are upset by something unknown, such as a strange
person or animal, so even sensitive neighbours cannot be irritated by
them. Nor are my birds very shy, and the presence of people in the
garden does not cause them to fly into the shelter. As they are out in
the aviary nearly all day, one can observe them well unlike shyer birds
that rush into their shelter the moment anyone appears.
Strangely, the Green-cheeked Conures did not go into a nest-box at
night, though two were provided, one in the flight and one in the shelter.
As far as I know, this is quite unusual amongst birds of the Pyrrhura
genus and they only changed at the beginning of the breeding season.
Though only recently imported in the winter of 1981/2, they proved to
be resistent to cold weather. I let them out into the flight when the
temperature was not below -2*C but I am sure that they would have gone
out in even colder temperatures. They also bathed in very cold water.
Their diet consists of the usual seeds (sunflower and oats are also
sprouted), of which sunflower and millet spray are preferred, corn-on-
the-cob (maize), a little biscuit, shredded carrots and much fruit - apples,
pears, grapes, figs and red currants. Wild berries such as hips, mountain
ash, hawthorn or white thorn, and cotoneaster berries of various sorts
are much relished as are chickweed and dandelion heads. Grit, cuttle-
fish "bone" and limestone are always provided. To date, they will not
touch spinach.
The birds became interested in the nest-boxes for the first time in
March 1983. Eventually they adopted a log in the shelter with a layer
of wood shavings. Soon mating took place and between the 28th March
and 5th April, five eggs were laid. Checking the log on 1st May, I found
four young in the nest. The fifth egg did not hatch and later disappeared.
As the parents were apparently worried when I entered the shelter, I
had few opportunities to observe the birds when feeding the young. As
tar as I could see, the cock was often in the nest (always at night). At
first the young were naked, thereafter covered with thin down. They were
apparently always well fed. The first chick left the nest on 11th June, the
others followed during the next days, but they went back into the box
quite frequently for some further days and during this time, were more
inside than outside. The first time out their movements were quite awk-
ward and hesitant, but soon they became used to the new surroundings

and learned to fly and to climb skilfully. They are now very lively, moving
about together and there is much mutual preening and playful struggling.
The plumage of the young differs only slightly from that of their par-
ents; the grey is paler, especially the ear coverts, the ceres are lighter
and the bill more brownish-grey. The size is the same.

This bird is also known as the Bronze-naped Pigeon and the Crimson-
winged Pigeon. It was named after the French naturalist Adulphe Dele-
gorgue during his African travels in 1847. Little is known about this rare
secretive species which may be seen singly or in pairs with flocks, some-
times gathering to feed in the early morning and late afternoon.
The male has the head slate grey suffused with slight green iridescence;
nape vivid iridescent mauve; band across hind neck white; mantle and
wings dark reddish brown shading to slate-black on lower wing-coverts;
rump blue-grey; tail blackish; underparts dark greyish pink shading to
reddish brown on the belly; eye dark brown or reddish; orbital skin around
eye dark pink to flesh pink; bill blackish with pale horn-coloured tip;legs
and feet reddish pink. The female has the crown and nape brown and lacks
the white collar. Young birds of the nominate race have not been described
but a juvenile of C.d. sharpei lacked the white collar; underparts dark
rufous; upperparts greyish brown, feathers edged with light rufous.
Delegorgue's Pigeon occurs in Pondoland (coastal), Transkei (high-
lands), eastern Griqualand to Natal (interior), western Zululand, eastern
Zimbabwe and southern Mozambique.
It is locally migratory according to food supply. It inhabits evergreen
forests and thick'woodland and is also found on the coast and on
occasions in mature pine plantations. It is rarely seen as it keeps mostly
within the protective 'cover' of the forest canopy, but is recorded mainly
on its call which is a distinctive, fairly loud coo-co-coo , followed by five or
six quiet coos. If approached, it remains motionless at first but once
flushed, flight is swift and direct.
This species appears to be mainly frugivorous, feeding in the upper
branches of forest trees on wild figs, various kinds of berries and fruit.
Recorded feeding on the large pinkish or red fleshy cones of Real Yellow-
wood Podocarpus latifolius, the small, single-lobed, yellow-green capsule
of the wild Poplar Macaranga capensis, and the black (when ripe) berries
of the Pigeonwood Trema orientalis. The stomach of one specimen con-
tained the larvae of cicadas, while that of another contained some small
quartz pebbles.
Delegorgue s Pigeon breeds from November to April. It constructs a
flimsy platform of twigs in a tree or shrub, usually about 5-7 m above the

ground. It lays two glossy white eggs; both sexes incubate and feed the
young (Kenya).
The species is in no danger of extinction as long as the relatively small
areas where it occurs remain protected. There are populations elsewhere
in Africa. I can find no record of its having been kept or bred in aviaries in
South Africa but the northern race C.d. sharpei is reported to have been
kept on rare occasions in British and American zoological gardens.

I have had a long association with the Tambourine Dove, or, to give it
its alternative names, Wood Dove or White-breasted Dove. The association
has been caused because their low, rapid flight has led them to fly into
moving cars using a road which runs through the middle of an evergreen
forest near my home on the coast. Many have come to grief, but those
stunned spend about a month recuperating in my hospital aviary before
being released back into the forest. The male has a snow white forehead,
throat, breast and belly; nape, ear-coverts and back ashy brown; tail dark
brown, the outer feathers with subterminal markings in black; iridescent
wing spots blackish purple; eye brown; bill purplish, with black tip; legs
and feet reddish purple. The female differs from the male in having the
white parts suffused with grey. Juveniles have the sides of the chest and
flanks barred, the feathers edged with greyish white.
This dove occurs from Sierra Leone and Fernando Poo in the west to
Ethiopia in the east, then southwards to north-eastern Angola, Zimbabwe
(except in the dry east), Mozambique, eastern Transvaal, Swaziland,
Zululand, Natal to southern and eastern Cape Province, South Africa.
They also occur on the islands of Comoro and Madagascar.
The diet includes weed seeds, grain, fruit and insects. They are particu-
larly fond of the seeds of the Castor oil plant Ricinus communis. They
have been recorded feeding on the seeds of Sorghum Sorghum bicolor,
Land Grass Eleusine africana, Flat-crown Albizia sp., Stink-hout Celtis
sp. and Fever Tree Croton sp., as well as the fruits of Waterbessie Syzigium
cordatum, Mulberry Morns mesozygia and Pigeonwood Trema orientalis
(Rowan, 1938). In captivity they accept a grain mixture consisting of
crushed red maize, lentils, tares, millet and sunflower. To supplement
the lack of castor oil in their diet, sponge cage was used. Lettuce, water-
cress, chickweek and spinach was their only supply of green food. The
chickweed was eaten on every occasion, and only small portions of the
lettuce and watercress, with no interest shown in the spinach. Various
types of fruit were tried but only orange and dried currants were accep-
ted. Insect life must play a large part in their natural food supply, as they
never refused such items as small mealworms, flying termites, small
brown ants, spiders, small slugs and dead flies.

platform of twigs and roots, placed at 1-10 m (3 ft 3 in to 33 ft) in a tree
or in the tangled branches of a creeper. A pair was recorded utilising a
nest originally built by Laughing Doves Streptopelia senegalensis (Mor-
phew, 1972). The nest construction is carried out by the female as the
male carries twigs to the nest site. Both birds share in the incubation with
the male sitting for long periods during the day and the female relieving
for short intervals. The female would take the night sitting. The incuba-
tion period is between 17-20 days. The egg shells are usually removed by
the male soon after hatching. The female closely broods the young for the
first few days whereupon both brood constantly. On hatching the young
have a brownish skin covered with pale creamy white down on the head,
scapulars and rump. At seven days the quill feathers cover a large portion
of the body. At nine to ten days the feathers start to appear from the
quills. The young birds leave the nest at 19-22 days. Hybrids between this
species and Green-spotted Wood Dove Turtur chalcospilos, Blue-spotted
Wood Dove Turtur afer and Namaqua Dove Oena capensis have been
recorded.

(Peterborough, Northants.)
The Blue-naped Parrot weighs somewhere between 170 and 200 g.
It has a resemblance to an immature Alexandrine Parrakeet Psittacula
eupatria with a broader, shorter tail. Its glory is the wing-coverts which,
to the bend of the wing, are black and towards the flights are gold bor-
dered. Some coverts are blue. The nape is blue and more blue is on the
rump. Contrary to published opinion (e.g. Delacour and Mayr, 1946,
Dupont, 1971, and Forshaw, 1978) the sexes are of different appear-
ance. Hens have the gold on the coverts muted to dull brass; they have
less blue both to the wing and nape, and the black is reduced and duller.
The bill is not so perfect and a brighter red.
The Blue-naped, as with the other Philippine parrots, was seldom
imported. I obtained four adult hens from the late (and so much missed)
Mrs. Stephanie Belford in the spring of 1977. The only one that had
good plumage was picked up dead the next day, presumably it succumbed
to the stress of capture and transport. The next best-feathered bird died,
of visceral gout, in January 1981. She and another had laid annual clutches
of two or three eggs every late May or early June. In February of 1983 I
managed, through an advertisement, to obtain the loan of a male from
Ken McKenzie. Neither of the remaining hens was ever able to fly. They
had a tousled look, for some feathers never grew and the vanes to the
biggest feathers had defective barbs, while the flight and tail feathers
always grew in a curve. As diet made no difference to their feathering I
assumed that this was the result of once having had "French-moult". The
two hens had always been amicable. They roosted in separate boxes and
the likelihood was that the borrowed male, like the Ring-necked Parrakeet
P. krameri (Smith, 1972) and the Derbyan Parrakeet P. derbiana (Hay-
ward, 1983) might have become a bigamist. I doubt that the hens would
have fought. The separated hen was held two flights away, in an identical
outside aviary, 2 x 1 x 2 m high. Regrettably, she was picked up dead two
weeks later, with a ruptured liver from a hard fall as she could only flutter.
As with the Alexandrine Parrakeet, the pair are more at ease in close
company than are the smaller-sized Ring-neckeds and will perch, often for
long intervals, quite relaxed with their bodies almost touching. The court-
ship noticeably lacked the neurotic (because it is superfluous) wiping of

the bill of many Psittacula parrakeets. In the early courtship days when
the cock preened his partner's head he had less of the spite and fear so
obvious in Ring-neckeds. He groomed her head. When approaching the hen
the courting male (this is also noticeable in Psittacula) held himself, pen-
guin-like, bolt upright with eyes blazing and a very slight drooping of the
wings and flaring of the tail. He marched grandly forward (his legs stretched
clear of the body) with long, gliding, deliberate steps. It was possible to
compare this stately gait with that of a normal bird for, as he approached,
the hen would sometimes walk off. As the upright, proudly advancing
male moved towards the hen, he had his bill always directly facing her
with the head held arrogantly high. No side-to-side swaying of the head
was seen. Usually the female squatted low while he, intending to copulate,
first looped his head over her back with his bill-tip against her opposite
neck side, as if he were trying to stop her moving, then climbed on her
back facing the wrong way round. Positioning himself in the correct direc-
tion, he began copulation by pressing his cheek next to hers for a second
or two then, lifting his head over her nape, pressed the other cheek and,
after a similar pause, back again. This pressing of alternate cheeks took
place with a perfect rhythmical pattern. Although quite vociferous birds,
no noise was heard during treading. A regular alternate pounding of the
neck of the female by the copulating male's head, called "hammering" is
seen in the Ring-necked and the Long-tailed Parrakeet (Smith, 1979) and,
incidentally, in fig parrots Psittaculirostris. If the hen was not willing to
mate she would hold herself in an imperiously high-stretched body and
head position, which usually set him doing stiff-legged jumps with eye-
blazing to punctuate his marching. Then he would take short flights
dropping vertically on to a perch, immediately followed by a short
bounce, an action very reminiscent of lories and fig parrots and surprisingly
elegant for so stocky a bird. On walking away from the hen, or less
commonly, when approaching, he would slide his lowered bill ahead of
himself. The frequency of copulation fell throughout incubation and was
never seen once the eggs hatched.
Nest excavation was done by the hen. This nest was used as a dormitory,
by both, for many months before laying, and after. The nesting container
was our usual dry (because of overhead protection) sloping, thick wooden
rectangular box. As has been our invariable practice, for many years now,
no nesting material was provided, except for generous lengths of softwood
quartering screwed along the length of the inside corners of the box for
the hen to chew at. From Mrs. Bonestall's account (1937) it appeared that
her hen Blue-naped Parrot might have picked up odds and ends from the
aviary floor to form a nest. However, the soft, warm material she describes
as forming the nest does seem more likely to have been gathered by mice.

Certainly the several clutches my three birds laid were invariably deposi-
ted on a thick accumulation of woodparings torn by the hens from the in-
terior of the boxes. Six clutches were of two and four of three eggs. All
were laid in the period of late April, through May to the first week in June.
This hen laid her first egg on 3rd May, 1983. The second followed three
days later. As expected, the male played no part in incubation. The first
egg was infertile. After asking Mr. McKenzie's permission (the first chick
had been promised to him) the eggs were put into a mechanical incubator.
On 2nd June the first egg (of her second clutch) was laid sixteen days after
removal of these. Another (three days later) completed this second, fertile
clutch. The eggs were left with the parents. The first hatched on 29th June
and the second two days later. This twenty-six day incubation matched
the incubator-hatched egg and Mrs. Bonestall's pair. Pipping commenced
three days before the chicks released themselves from the shell.
The incubator-hatched chick was immediately given to a pair of Ring-
necked Parrakeets that had a single three-day-old chick. (The foster parents
had, by removing their two previous clutches, been held back for this
purpose). The only difference, other than size, between the Ringnecked
Parrakeets and the Blue-naped Parrot chick was that the former was
completely naked. Blue-naped chicks have a thin, extremely sparse scatter-
ing of quite short (3-4 mm) down. This vestigial down never rubbed
off and was still there after three weeks. All the chicks were regularly
weighed. The Ring-necked Parrakeet-reared chick was weighed at approxi-
mately eight in the morning, when it had an empty crop, and the two
parent-reared chicks some time in the early afternoon when they usually
had full crops. (This might explain much of the difference in weight).
When four days old, two of the three were clearly yellow. Such a jaundiced
look, which is often noticed in fresh-hatched parrot chicks is, I believe, not
pathological. It may prove to be an accumulation of carotenes: the vege-
table pigments that colour, amongst other things, egg-yolk. Perhaps it is
the absorption of the yolk-sac that gives this effect.
As will be seen from the graph, growth was very rapid, the eyes opening
when 12 days old and by three weeks the chicks were covered by a dark
grey, secondary down, the follicles of which had appeared, and darkened
the skin, at 11 days old. By 24 days the quills of the feathers were sprout-
ing in the skin and at the 29th day the first green could be seen on the
secondaries and larger wing-coverts. When 40 days old, the eldest, solitary
chick was taken for (successful) hand-rearing by Mr. McKenzie. Because of
the deeper red to the bill and the larger amount of blue to the wing, it is
assumed to be male. The other two seem to be temale. The second chick
fledged after 56 days and the final one two days after that. Both are
beautifully perfect in feather and extremely tame. In appearance they are

smaller than the parents. The bill is a muddier and duller red; there is no
blue to the nape and only a little to the back; the wing markings are very
dull and indistinct. The tail feathers are pointed, not rounded as in the
adults, and the eyes are dark.
The surviving British population of the Blue-naped Parrot is between
14 and 20 birds. Included is the pair, and their two offspring (also bred
in 1983) owned by David Alderton. This number would be well adequate
provided that the necessary exchange of breeding birds takes place, to
establish them as aviary birds without having to obtain more from the
wild.

Owls in general are thought by Brazilians to be animals that bring bad
luck to people; they believe that where an owl sings at night, someone may
die soon. However, Brazilians are also attracted by nests, eggs and young
birds, if only to put them in captivity or destroy them.
A barred young Tropical Screech Owl was one such unfortunate bird
(Plate 1), hatched in a large warehouse at the Agronomic Institute at
Belem, Para, Brazil, and brought to me on 26th August 1966. 1 kept it in a
large bathroom, perched on a branch. It tried to peck and clapped its
beak when touched but soon became tame. On 4th October it closed its
eyes when I touched its head. It was in better health, clapped the bill less
and often flew around the room.
Feeding
While a head wound healed, the bird was fed raw beef and boiled eggs.
Water was provided by opening its bill and dropping in water with an eye-
dropper. On 16th October, when I discovered the first expelled pellet
containing dark material, I started feeding it one to two mice, three to
four geckoes, and several beetles every night. Feeding was not a problem,
except that when it arrived I had to open its beak and force the food in;
soon it was feeding by itself. These owls are often insectivorous, a bird
from Icapara (Sao Paulo) in the Museu de Zoologia of the University of
Sao Paulo had remains of insects in its stomach.
On 14th October I had provided a container full of water for it to
drink and bathe in. The bird got in the container and drank and then
stamped its feet in the water, sitting and lowering the head several times
so that belly and head would get wet. It stopped bathing when I watched
but resumed as soon as I left. The next day, when the container was
presented, the owl entered the water and drank but did not bathe.
Spicknall and Pickett(1983) did not see drinking in captive Rhinoptynx
clamator.
Plumage
When I received the young bird, it was covered with soft downy grey

feathers barred with a darker grey, almost black; its feet were ivory, the
bill light olivaceous grey, and the iris tan or orangeish brown. Forty days
later, on 4th October, the first body feather dropped. Every day thereafter
two to five more feathers dropped. Its legs had gained feathers with grey
bases and light brown tips, each with a dark brown subterminal bar. Its
bristles were longer.
On 20th October I noticed different new feathers on its neck. The new
feathers were streaked instead of barred, and there was a dark feather on
the superciliary line. Whenever it preened, a few body feathers dropped
and some remained next to its bill. On 26th October the young owl had a
series of white feathers along its superciliary line. Breast feathers with
dark stripes were increasing in number, forming a necklace and two rows
down the sides of the breast. On 7th November there was a line of short,
white ear feathers which were erected at the presence of strangers. On top
of the head, black feathers had increased in number, forming stripes. By
24th November the owl had a different plumage (Plates 2 and 3) than
when it arrived in August, and emitted at least three different types of
calls.
From observation of two young in a nest found on 17th October,
1972, on top of an old nest of the Great Kiskadee Pitangus sulphuratus in
a rubber tree at the Agronomic Institute (Oniki and Willis, 1983), we can
conclude that at hatching,young Tropical Screech Owls are covered with
fluffy white down and eleven days later their chests are covered with dark-
barred feathers. More than 40 days later the barred feathers drop gradually
and are replaced by the streaked plumage described above. Wetmore
(1968) describes a similar sequence of plumages from Panama.

On 13th October at 18:00 the young owl had given, for the first time, a
couple of sounds similar to the call of an adult owl. It had heard these
calls from a bird outside - ever since it was in the room a pair of Otus
choliba had been singing outside every night. On 25th October, the pet
owl also sang at 02:00. Its song was rather weak and short but it was exci-
ted and flapped its wings. The outsider approached the window where the
pet owl was. From this night on, it emitted a few faint and short songs
every night, often flying around the larger adjoining room.
In early December I took the pet owl to Sao Paulo City, where it es-
caped while I was feeding it. It perched on top of a high building and later
flew away.

containing two white, rounded eggs. The average weight of four eggs was
15.lg (range 14.5-15.5g).
On 19th October 1967, in the same warehouse where the young had
hatched in 1966, two fledglings were discovered. (One white downy young
about five days old weighed 24.lg.) This suggests that a pair was nesting in
the same site year after year.

SOME BIRDS SEEN ON A VISIT TO AUSTRALIA, NEW

(Illinois, USA)
To a parrot enthusiast Australia is a paradise, for it contains 52 species
of this family, including some unique forms such as the Long-billed Corella
Ccicdtuu tenuirostris. Therefore it was with great expectations of seeing
some of the native species that I visited this continent. That Australia is
the land of parrots was evident the minute our plane touched down at
Tullamarine Airport in Melbourne; as the plane made its way down the
runway, a pair of Galahs Eolophus roseicapillus was seen feeding in a strip
of grass - just a token of what was to be seen in the weeks ahead.
One of the delights of my trip was observing the Long-billed or Slender-
oili v q Corella in its habitat. I had thought that it would be rare, as sugges-

ted by some reports which have documented a contraction of range and
decline in numbers, yet this was clearly not the case: in a day and a half
of travellingjGordon Aitken and I observed some 20,000 specimens. They
were wary of man, a trait that could probably be attributed to persecu-
tion as an agricultural pest. Within parts of the range visited it could be
described with only one word - numerous.
The Sulphur-crested Cockatoo Cacatua g. galerita was sighted on num-
erous occasions, with one of the largest concentrations being observed
feeding on the ground at Rutherglen in Victoria. They make a magnificent
spectacle while in flight. Similarly, Galahs provide a treat for the bird
watcher and their antics while flying, as they dart between trees, calling
all the time, make them stand out in my memory.
Numerous other species were observed in the wild. Some seen in aviaries
are worthy of noting. An Eclectus Parrot Eclectus roratus in the collec-
tion of Paul and Joan Sperba of Ballarat, Victoria, is unique in its colour
scheme. Briefly, it could be described as having the colours of both male
and female. Probably a cock, it has shown no interest in nesting. The
Sperbas also breed Golden-shouldered Parrots Psephotus c. chrysoptery-
gius, a species which I found in numerous collections and which could
be said to be established. Probably the most consistent and successful
breeder of this species is Joe Mattinson of Wollongong, New South Wales.
He told me that in a 20-year period he has bred some 600, a remarkable
achievement! Mattinson also has Naretha Blue-Bonnets Psephotus haema-
togaster naretha , which I also saw in the aviaries of John Fell of Victoria,
and of several others.
The Hooded Parrot Psephotus c. dissimilis, which, in my mind, is far
more attractive than the Golden-shouldered, was also encountered in a
number of aviaries, in which it is established. This species display is most
attractive: males ruffle their black crowns, bring their wings slightly
forwards to reveal the rump and sway their tails from side to side.
A unique hybrid was seen in the collection of Victoria aviculturist
Stuart Anderson. When first told about it - a cross between a hen Aus-
tralian King Parrot Alisterus scapularis and a male Rainbow Lorikeet
Trichoglossus haematodus moluccanus - I was sceptical, yet after viewing
and talking to the breeder, there is no question as to its authenticity.
Produced in an aviary a couple of years ago, it could be described as
having lorikeet markings with the length of a King. Its actions con-
tained features of both parents and its voice was like that of the
moluccanus parent.
Non-parrot birds were many. Red-browed Finches Aegintha temporalis
were seen in small numbers in the vicinity of the Sir Colin MacKenzie
Fauna Park and in the southern part of Mornington Peninsula, both in

the state of Victoria. The Common Myna Acridotheres tristis was also
seen in numerous places, with a cinnamon-coloured bird being sighted
in the vicinity of Sid Smith's house in Harkaway.
New Zealand is not nearly so rich in avifauna as its neighbour Austra-
lia, but the birds that it does have are impressive. In parrots, all of which
have Maori vernacular names that start with the letter "K", it has a most
distinct group. One that I saw was the Kaka Nestor meridionalis] this was
on Little Barrier Island, which was visited through the assistance of John
Craig of Auckland University. Their presence here is quickly seen, as these
magnificent parrots fly about the ranger's home at West Landing. They
are tame, allowing a close approach.
Birds seen on Little Barrier could be classed in both subspecies accord-
ing to their dull or bright colours, suggesting that septentrionalis is invalid.
This island contains some equally interesting birds, such as the Tui
Prosthemadera novaeseelandiae which is quite common, the less abundant
Bellbird Anthomis melanura and the very large New Zealand Pigeon Hemi-
phaga novaeseelandiae, a largely fruit-eating bird that can be seen without
difficulty. The former are rather aggressive, chasing the second species
away from a feeding station baited with sugar-water. Kakas visited here
sporadically for sips.
Red-fronted Kakarikis Cyanoramphus novaezelandiae were seen occa-
sionally, in forests but more frequently in trees that grow along the rocky
shore. Unlike Kakas they did not allow a close approach.
In the aviaries of Fred Rix, a noted New Zealand aviculturist, I had the
priviledge of seeing a pied mutation of the Yellow Rosella Platycercus
flaveolus of which he has a number of breeding pairs; several of these
were nesting at the time of my visit. They are striking, in my eyes, much
more so than birds of normal appearance. Fred also had a red Blue-
cheeked Rosella P.a. adscitus, whose colour is probably due to liver mal-
function, and a hybrid Blue-cheeked x Northern Rosella. The last could be
spotted as "impure" by the pale head coloration.
My short stay on Viti Levu, the largest island in the Fijian chain, was
most rewarding for I was able to see three captive specimens of the
Collared Lory Phigys solitarius. They reminded me of Vini in their actions,
though they were not nearly as active. In the Nausori Highlands a single
individual of the rare Red-throated Lorikeet Charmosyna amabilis was
spotted as it flew across a road; it then settled on a wild-growing orange
tree, where it soon became inconspicuous. The antithesis of the status
of amabilis is that of the Common Myna, which has to be considered the
most common bird on Viti Levu. An hour did not pass that this biid was
not seen. They were especially abundant in open areas, clearly shying

away from thick forest. One cannot help but wonder what effect this
bird and the introduced mongoose have had on avifauna.
Reporting on every bird observed in the field would take many pages,
because the countries visited are so rich in avifauna. Similarly, aviaries
house a melange that would excite even the least interested individual.
For this reason, those described here are some of the most noteworthy.

DO CHICK AND DUCKLING DOWN PATTERNS FUNCTION
AS RECOGNITION MARKS?
By DEREK GOODWIN

<footnote confidence="0.600813666666667">
Among my more valued books is a Victorian masterpiece (Bingley,
1852). It is written in the form of stories told by a loving and learned
uncle to his small niece and nephew. In the first chapter, Uncle Thomas
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.984712052631579" page_id="58080088"  page_num="112" year="" vol="">
narrates what the Norwegians allegedly believed were the remarkable (and
remarkably unpleasant) methods by which the Golden Eagle managed to
bring about the deaths of Oxen that it fed on. The little girl comments: "It
is a very sagacious stratagem indeed, I really do not see how it could
proceed more efficiently if it was endowed with reason." The little boy
asks: "But is it true?".
Sometimes I feel like that little boy when confronted, in yet another
book, by some oft-repeated "ornithological fact". Here is one such, on
which I propose to give reasons for my doubts about its correctness. It is a
matter on which it would seem likely that many of our readers can give
first hand information and I hope these notes will stimulate many to do so.
The young of all nidifugous birds, that is birds that have active chicks
that leave the nest (whether for good, as with ducklings, or at first only
for short excursions as with some rail chicks) within from a few hours to
about three days (according to species) after hatching, and run or swim
actively thereafter, are clad in down. In the rails (Rallidae) the down is
usually black, except (sometimes) on parts of the head and in some water-
fowl (Anatidae) the ducklings or goslings may be uniformly blackish, as
those of our common Tufted Duck Ay thy a fuligula, or only obscurely

patterned as in most true geese ( Anser and Branta). In most, however, and
this includes all (at least, I think all) gamebirds and most ducks, the young
are strikingly patterned in light and dark colours, these patterns being
usually most striking when viewed from close to and from above.
In most young chicks or ducklings the down pattern is highly cryptic
and serves to camouflage them in their natural environment, especially
when the young, after first fleeing from the parent in response to its
warning calls, crouch motionless, either in the open or (according to
species or circumstances) in whatever cover they can find to hand. In some
waterfowl, notably the shelducks and their allies, the black and white
down pattern of the young is, however, far from inconspicuous under nor-
mal circumstances. At least this is the case with our common Shelduck
Tadoma tadoma and, I imagine, with its exotic relatives also.
Thus in most gamebirds and in many waterfowl the down pattern of
the young helps to conceal them from enemies that hunt by sight, such
as predatory birds and humans. The same is even more obviously true
for the chicks of many waders, the colour patterns of whose down blends
in an almost miraculous manner with the usual backgrounds of their
natural breeding habitats. Anyone who, like myself, has at times failed
to find the immobile crouching chicks of such birds as the Golden Plover
Pluvialis apricaria, Woodcock Scolopax rusticola or Oystercatcher Haema-
topus ostralegus will have no doubt about this and will, perhaps, have
been saddened at the realisation of the scale of the "massacre of the
innocents" throughout countless generations which alone could have
brought about the present near-perfection.
It should, however, be noted that in our present man-dominated and
man-manipulated world, birds often breed in man-made habitats against
whose background their natural camouflage may be far from perfect. In a
predominantly green water meadow, the predominantly rich russet chicks
of the Snipe Gallinago gallinago are not hard to see, and the same is true
of some other species under comparable conditions.
As a general rule the more closely two species of birds are related, the
more alike the colour patterns of their downy young will be. Where there
are marked exceptions to this, as with the ducklings of the Pochard Aythya
ferina and the Tufted Duck, this is usually because in one of the two con-
cerned the general darkening of the colour has obliterated the pattern.
Again, as a general rule (to which there are exceptions) the pattern seems
to be more conservative than the colour of the down. However, although
chicks of closely related species may be very similar indeed, usually there
are specific as well as generic differences in the colour pattern, especially
on the head.
In connection with this, another function has been widely claimed tor

D. GOODWIN - FUNCTION OF DOWN PATTERNS
the down patterns of gamebird chicks and ducklings (and sometimes, at
least by implication, for other nidifugous birds as well). This is that the
down pattern as a whole, or that on the head, serves as a species recog-
nition mark, and that the mother (or, presumably, the father in such birds
as phalaropes and bustard-quails) will kill or desert any chick which has
"wrong"markings.
The Heinroths, who placed the eggs of many different birds under
broody domestic hens, found that (I quote from Dr. M. Cullen's 1959
translation) - "By no means every hen will raise ducklings she has hatched
out. Some will not accept Pheasant chicks.and there are even
those who will only accept (Domestic Fowl) chicks whose down is coloured
like that of the South Asiatic Red Jungle Fowl, the wild ancestor of our
domestic Chickens". Immelman (1983) says that wild Red Junglefowl
Gallus gallus (formerly G. bankiva) will only care for young of their
own species "which they recognise by the head markings" and adds that
this selectivity has been lost to differing degrees in different breeds of
domestic fowl.
Lorenz (1971, p. 293) says that a mother Muscovy Duck will show
parental defence in response to the distress calls of a Mallard Duckling
seized by a predator but will then "treat it with utter enmity" because
the species-typical head markings, upon which parental responses depend,
are markedly different" (from those of a Muscovy Duckling).
The only detailed account I have read of a parent gamebird (or other
species) responding to the head pattern of a chick was that of a hen
Golden Pheasant (Lorenz, 1971, p. 169). She had hatched a young Com-
mon Pheasant Phasianus colchicus along with her own brood. She did not
harm the Common Pheasant chick but showed apparent conflict between
attacking and parental behaviour, pecking it gently but only when it was
close under her bill. "She would always fix her gaze on the head of the
changeling.".
That mother ducks of some species will attack ducklings that are not
their own is common knowledge. Anyone who has watched tame Mallards
on park lakes and village ponds will have seen all too many examples of
this and will also have seen that it occurs whether or not the strangers
have the "right" species-specific down pattern. That, as the Heinroths
have recorded, brooding domestic hens will often, perhaps usually, kill at
hatching time any fostered young (such as the Raven and the Little
Bustard instanced by the Heinroths) that differ from domestic fowl
chicks both in appearance^ voice is not to be doubted.
What I do doubt, however, is whether gamebirds, waterfowl or other
birds that have active chicks recognise them innately by their down
pattern (either as a whole, or the head pattern alone) and normally (if

ever) kill or reject a chick or duckling that is otherwise normal because it
does not show the normal down colour pattern.
Lorenz (1966, p. 100) describes experiments with deafened Turkeys
Meleagris gallopavo, that seemed to show that previously inexperienced
hen Turkeys recognise their chicks as such by their voices. I think it is
likely that in other birds that have active chicks, the same may be true.
There seems to be much evidence that many (perhaps all) individuals
of many different familes and species will accept chicks or ducklings that
do not show the normal down pattern. If the wild Red Jungle fowl hen
really does recognise her chicks by their colour pattern and kills wrongly
coloured young, then clearly this innate selectivity must have lapsed in
domestic fowls before the first white (yellow chicks) or black (black
chicks) mutations could have occurred and been successfully reared.
The melanistic form of the Common Pheasant arose spontaneously
among introduced stocks in England and elsewhere (Delacour, 1951,
Goodwin 1982). The chicks of this form are dark chocolate or blackish,
with pale areas (sometimes) on the head, quite unlike the much paler and
intricately patterned normal chicks.
Yet, obviously, these strange-looking dark chicks were, and still are, ac-
cepted by their mothers. I have myself seen a wild, normally coloured hen
Pheasant, caring for four half-grown chicks, one normal in colour, the
Female Pheasant with three normal and one melanistic chick
other three melanistic mutants.
Where Mallard breed in numbers in places where they are little, or not
at all harrassed by birds of prey, it is common for a variety which is dark
chocolate to greenish black, with a white patch on the breast, to crop up.
Less frequent, but still not really rare, are pure white or partly white indi-
viduals. I am talking here of birds that in size, shape and flying ability differ
in no way from normal wild Mallards, not of strayed domestic ducks or

obvious crosses between them and the wild Mallards. The ducklings of the
dark form are almost uniform blackish olive, those of the white form
bright yellow (fading after the first week or so). Yet, so far as I have seen, ;
their mothers accept and care for them, even when there are only one or
two such freaks in an otherwise normally patterned brood.
I saw this freak Mallard duckling at Wey-
mouth in 1983. It had what looked like a
white (not, to my surprise, yellow) "powder
puff' on the back of its head. It and one
perfectly normal duckling were evidently
the sole survivors of the brood. They were
not more than five or six days old and their
undiscriminating mother was normal in
appearance.
It is not clear whether the Muscovy Duck that Lorenz wrote of was of
the wild or domestic form of the species. Domestic Muscovies of the
wild colour, and also those which, though otherwise of the wild colour
pattern, develop white or partly white heads at the second moult are
when ducklings, patterned in blackish-olive and yellow very like (to human
eyes) the ducklings of the Mallard (though not exactly alike). I have
watched many domestic Muscovy Ducks with broods comprised of some
wild patterned and some partly or entirely yellow (white when adult)
ducklings and have never seen the mother discriminate between them.
The Black-shouldered or Japanned morph of the Peafowl Pctvo cvistatus
has repeatedly cropped up among wild-coloured stocks. The chicks (and
females) of this form are whitish and differ strikingly from the normal
ciy p tic ally patterned Peafowl chick. When they occur (as they probably
often do) in a wild state they are no doubt soon eliminated by predators
but, so far as I know, there is no evidence that such conspicuous little
freaks are ever rejected by their mothers, even when these are normally
coloured Peahens. That acute and observant aviculturist the late Miss
Fiances Pitt bred both forms, and had Black-shouldered (= whitish)
chicks produced by normal hens. She would certainly have noted and
recorded any such discrimination in the bird she so carefully observed and
so lovingly described (Pitt, circa 1924, and 1931).
Besides the above concrete evidence there is much circumstantial but
I think good evidence with other species. Whether good ever comes out of
evil is a debatable point but it is certain that knowledge often does. One
iesult of the past and ever continuing mass slaughter in Britain of thous-

ands upon thousands of gamebirds, waterfowl and Woodcocks for sport
(an activity approved of by many of our most influential bird protec-
tionists who are so horrified if a boy has a pet Kestrel or if a starving
peasant in the "third world" kills and eats a lark or a tern) is that such
freaks as do occur among these objects of the "legitimate sport" are
usually shot; and some at least of those thatare ; end up usefully as museum
specimens.
In the British Museum (Natural History) collection there are many
silver, fawn, pied and very dark varieties of the Red-legged Partridge
Alectoris rufa and the Common Partridge Perdix perdix. There are also
a few pied, fawn and very dark Woodcocks. I have myself seen an en-
tirely white wild Oystercatcher Haematopus ostralegus. There can be no
doubt that all these birds must have differed strikingly when young from
normal chicks of their species yet it is quite impossible that they could
have survived in the wild had their parents failed to care for them nor-
mally.
It would be interesting to hear, via the pages of this magazine, from
any readers who have had abnormally coloured young of any nidifugous
species hatched and reared by their own parents (or by foster parents of
the same species) as to the parent's responses. It would be useful to
know in such cases whether or not any of the brood were normally
coloured.
Of course, any observations of unusually coloured chicks in wild
broods of any species would be equally welcome.

Bird gardens and zoos are sometimes priviledged to be given parrots
and parrakeets by people who are concerned about the future of a pet
bird which they have found difficult to keep due to a change of circum-
stance.
Thus it was that in 1978 I was given "Polly", a Blue-fronted Amazon
Amazona aestiva, which has subsequently proved to be a cock. He was
followed by "Chaka", a hen of the same species. She arrived in 1980. I
do not know much about Polly's past, only that the man who gave him to
me married a woman who was not too keen on parrots! Chaka was bought
out in Africa and is named after a Zulu chief. Her owners decided to part
with her due to the arrival of their own offspring plus the fear of a parrot's
beak. Both parties concerned liked the thought of their respective birds
flying at liberty with the many other species of parrots here.
Polly has flown at liberty since 1979 and when the hen Chaka arrived,
it was love at first sight, so her confirnement lasted only for a few weeks.
Since then, their relationship has become closer with the result that they
reared a chick in 1982, in a nest-box in a tree some 20 yds from the site
where two Scarlet Macaws were also nesting.
This potentially dangerous situation did not lead to bloodshed, despite
the fact that macaws are well-known to be extremely aggressive when
breeding. Frequent visits by the macaws to the Amazon's nest-box was
repelled by the two Amazons, who retaliated by seizing the macaws by
their tails and so managed to drive them away from their nest-box. The
young Amazon was still being fed by the parents when it had been out of
the nest-box for three months. The noise the chick made was similar to
the bleeting of a sheep which caused surprise to passers-by who were
puzzled by what sounded like an airborne sheep!
It is encouraging that these Amazons are extremely hardy. They roost
away somewhere at night and during the course of their freedom have had
to face extremes of cold, wet blizzards and storm force winds. They
appear unaffected by this. They are extremely active birds and spend a
lot of time on the wing in the early mornings and evenings. This is con-
trary to what many people believe since I have heard it said that Amazons,
like African Greys, are sedentary birds. In my experience, African Greys
are strong and active fliers.
Before coming here, both Polly and Chaka were kept in the conven-

ional way, as parrots in a cage, with freedom in a room when their owners
illowed them out to exercise. Both birds were steady with me but not
ame though &amp;apos;I gather that they were tame with their previous owners. I do
lot think that they were truly humanised, as I have found some parrots to
ie. On first meeting, although it was evident that they were strongly at-
;racted to each other, Chaka seemed to be cautious if Polly came too near.
Towever, during the course of 1981 this cautiousness improved until they
reached a point of entering a nest-box together. Although well able to
defend their own territory, they have not caused any trouble to other
nesting birds. Within 100 yards there are two African Greys, who are
constantly entering a box but sadly have not produced any young up to
now.
As a species at liberty, the Amazon is the least troublesome of parrots.
I have not seen them defoliate the trees or known them to attack my
neighbours' fruit but I wish I could say the same of the other parrots.

LORIES AND PARROTS IN THE STEPHAN COLLECTION

tions in South Africa on his fruit farming estate at Somerset West, a
beautiful town at the foot of the Hottentots-Holland Mountains, some 40
kilometres east of Cape Town. His extensive ranges of aviaries are set out
in a wooded area and probably benefit from the partial shade cast by
many magnificent tall trees. The standard aviary length is 8 m of which
approximately 1.25 m is taken up by the shelter, which may be closed by
a door. Losses have been much reduced by closing all birds in the shelters
at night from 17h 30 until 08h00 the following morning. Each shelter is
supplied with a small heater, so that the shelter temperature may be ther-
mostatically controlled at 50*F, and a 15 watt red light bulb for night
lighting. There is double wiring between all aviaries. The floors are all of
concrete because it is thought that worm survival may be less than with
earth floors and concrete may be easily and more thoroughly cleaned.

F.C. BARNICOAT - STEPHAN COLLECTION
All birds bred at "Hathersage" are closed rung while in the nest with
dated and initialled aluminium rings. Not only does this procedure facili-
tate record keeping, but it is likely to become more significant in the
future as governmental and nature conservation laws the world over make
the movement of birds increasingly difficult. These closed aluminium rings ;
provide irrefutable proof of aviary breeding and it may be easier to legally
transport birds which have been so rung.
Harry Stephan has worked on three themes in his vast collection - the
Loriidae, Australian parrakeets and the smaller American parrotlike species,
especially the conures. Of these, the lory and lorikeet collection is the
most spectacular and, having been established on a fruit farm it is in a
unique and idyllic position for relatively easy feeding, and outstanding
results, and it is probably the biggest such collection in this country at the
present time. It is only possible to enumerate most of the species it com- i
prises with a note here and there on the breedings achieved.
Most of these birds take years to mature for breeding. The Black Lories
have not bred yet, nor the Yellow-streaked in six years, even though they
have been surgically sexed. Duivenbode's reared a young male in 1980,
after five years, and a pair in 1981 reared by the mother alone after the
death of the cock. A pair of Black-winged has produced 35 chicks through
the years. The Violet-necked reared three offspring; the father died and
unfortunately all three are hens. The Blue-streaked lost their young in the
nest. The Red or Moluccan do well and were down on eggs agin. The
Dusky seem well established and one of the pairs had two young in the
nest at the time of my visit in February 1982. The Scaly-breasted breed
intermittently and a young aviary-bred pair has now been established. The
Ornate breed like a machine, yet there was a five-year-long wait before
they commenced. Swainson's had two young ones in the nest. Forsten's
had bred regularly. Coconut Lorikeets had young in the nest and have
always bred well. Edward's and Perfect have not bred yet. Two pairs of the
delightful little Goldie's Lorikeet are consistently successful, rearing two
young at a time; a second generation young pair has still not nested in the
third season, hinting at a fairly long maturation period even for this small
species. The Black-capped had eggs in the nest and had bred in the past,
while a pair of Purple-naped were still too young to have nested. Chat-
tering Lories breed quite well; they are inclined to nest only in summer
and not all the year round as with many other species. There were two
pairs of Fairy Lorikeets; they have not succeeded in breeding yet. The
male of the beautiful pair of Stella's regrettably has a growth on his abdo-
men which may prevent breeding success. Two pairs of the recently im-
ported Musschenbroek's looked in excellent fettle, and one of the pairs
had had three young but had allowed them to die. This species appears to

sat more seed than other lorikeet species.
Among the Australian parrakeets are the King, which has bred in the
past, and the Amboina King, still to be bred. Crimson-wings have proved
fairly prolific. The Barraband's is, strangely enough, one of the few species
never to have reared young at "Hathersage". Ill fortune has dogged every
pair that has been kept, but the effort still persists. The Princess of Wales
does exceedingly well once a good breeding pair is obtained, and Rock
Pebblars have also bred frequently. Pileated had had a good season. The
Barnard's, Cloncurry, Port Lincoln and Twenty-eight were all represented
and the intermediate form between Port Lincoln and Twenty-eight. The
Cloncurry looks like breeding soon and the others have already bred
easily. There are all the Rosellas including the Green and the Brown's
which are, of course, the most valuable. In two years the Brown's reared
four offspring; then the breeding cock died. Now an effort is being made
to settle a young cock with the old hen, but he is belligerent in the ex-
treme and his wing has to be kept clipped. There was a lovely pair of Red-
vented Blue-bonnets reared at "Hathersage" and the old pair had given six
youngsters for the current season, which proves them to be successful
here. The pair of Yellow-vented Blue-bonnets had not yet bred. Except for
the Golden-shouldered all the Psephotus were represented, pride of place
going to the Hooded. There was an aviary containing nine young Hooded
from the current breeding season just coming into colour and showing
signs of becoming aggressive towards each other. This species has not,
despite these results, proved easy to breed. Though they are willing enough
to go to nest, the babies are frequently lost, often at quite a late stage, and
they may cause many bitter disappointments. There is a breeding pair of
Yellow-fronted Kakarikis, but the Red-fronted, with which excellent results
were achieved in past years, had happened to die out, so that a new stock
is now being sought. This can easily happen in great collections where only
one or two pairs of each species can be kept. Particular success has been
achieved with the Swift Parrakeet here, and four were bred in the last
season; they are going to be set up on a colony system. They are a lovely
bird, particularly brightly coloured and sleek in plumage.
Among the American species the small macaws - Yellow-collared and
Illiger's - are comparatively new additions and not established yet. The
Illiger's have twice laid fertile eggs but deserted them. A good collection
of conures is being built up, but here nomenclature can be a problem.
For example, in the trade the Green-cheeked, Azara and Red-bellied were
all offered at different prices and on receipt proved to be exactly the same
bird apparently offered for sale without reference to species or subspecies!
These birds have all bred extremely well, however. Other conures in the
collection are the Blue-crowned, which breed only once per year and only

one out of the four eggs was fertile owing to the poor feet of the cock,
two pairs of Red-headed, the Golden-capped, which had reared a young-
ster and subsequently killed it, though one had been fully reared the pre-
vious season, Sun Conures, which had just reared offspring, the Brown-
throated and Jandaya, which, strange to say, did not reproduce and the
Golden-crowned or Peach-fronted which breed well. There are odd speci-
mens of Petz and Cactus, as well as pairs of Patagonian and Painted which
have not bred to date. Celestial Parrotlets are also kept and have bred
prolific ally.
No doubt I have missed quite a number of species, but enough has been
said to indicate that here is an extremely productive collection of parrot-
like birds making a valuable contribution to aviculture in South Africa.

The discovery of new species takes a little time to filter through the
scientific literature but it is well worth wading through the mound of
technical jargon in the hope of finding such a report. The Wilson Bulletin
Vol. 94, No.2, p. 105, outlines the history surrounding the discovery of
the Pale-bellied Antpitta Grallaria carrikeri. The first specimen, a juvenile
was collected during 1976 but was thought to belong to an already named
species. Since then, both sexes, more juveniles and a nest containing three
young have been found. The species has so far been found at three cloud
forest sites, all from Peru.

By coincidence, several days after writing the previous note, another
copy of The Wilson Bulletin disclosed the discovery of another antpitta.
Volume 95, No. 1, documents the appearance of the Ochre-fronted Ant-

males, were collected in epiphyte-laden, stunted cloud forest in 1978.

Australian ornithologist John Courtney has for several years been using
:ape recordings of food soliciting calls of parrot chicks for taxonomic
-esearch. In Australia the number of non-native species available is very
few indeed. Members are asked to assist Mr. Courtney in his work, which
ias already produced some important results, by sending tapes to him at
Swan Vale, Glen Innes, New South Wales 2370, Australia, or to Rosemary
Low (13 St. Wilfrid's Road, New Barnet, Herts.) who will forward them on
to him.
If possible, chicks should be recorded at several stages during their
development, the age in days being given as an introduction to each record-
ing and, of course, the species.

On the same subject, it is pleasing to note a change of attitude by some
scientists when a new species is discovered, especially as most regions of
the world are comparatively well-explored and numbers of the species
must surely be low. In bygone years, a whole series of skins would be
collected for the world's museums.
However, no skin of Campbell's Fairy Wren is represented; instead
colour photographs taken at the time of discovery, along with measure-
ments, have been distributed among leading institutions.
This bird owes its discovery to R.W. Campbell, a bander working for
the Australian Bird Banding Scheme at Bosavi, a remote area in western
Papua New Guinea. On three visits (4th-11th February 1980, 6th February,
1981, and 6th-8th November, 1981) a total of five birds were netted and
banded. Other visits failed to find Campbell's Fairy Wren, underlining the
fragile status of the species. Rather optimistically it is being stated that the
range is likely to be a belt of forest some 300 miles long. Although chris-
tened Malurus campbelli, it appears to be a victim of "lumpers as it is
unlike the typical Malurus Wrens of Australia. If conventional methods
had been adopted in its classification, it would reside in the genus Cheno-
rhamphus.

The Masked Bobwhite Colinus virginianus ridgwayi is the subject of an
interesting article in the November 1983 issue of the Audubon magazine.
Its ornithological history is discussed in detail and includes conservation
measures projected for the future which, incidentally, revolve around the
release of captive-reared birds into carefully selected areas. Previous releases
have only been partially successful.

efforts of the New Zealand Wildlife Service in conserving their bird life

remained in mid-1980 but by April 1983 the population had risen to 120.
The intended five-year project will probably finish halfway through the
fourth breeding season.

Television is not a habit I give way to that much but I must admit that
the Autumn/Winter programming of Britain's four channels made certain
evenings very entertaining - some weeks as many as five evenings included
a showing of a wildlife programme, occasionally two. Admittedly, some
were repeats but when the quality ranked as high as the award-winning
three-part series by the B.B.C., "The Flight of the Condor , there were no
complaints.
One Sunday in November must surely have been the best night's viewing
for a long time with the showing of two 55-minute films, the first part of
"Flight of the Condor", undoubtedly one of the finest wildlife series yet
made, featured a sequence on Torrent Ducks amongst its gems but even
this was eclipsed by "Birds of Paradox", a BBC and New Zealand Television
Service co-production. Not only a whole programme devoted to birds

which is something in itself, but film of some very rare species indeed was
included. Covering flightless birds, it commenced with the familiar Ostrich
and progressed through sequences on Kagu, Takahe, recently discovered
species of Rail and Steamer Duck, and climaxed with unique footage,
taken with night-vision cameras, of the Kakapo. If this film has not yet
reached overseas television services, keep a look-out for it - it is truly a
superb piece of television.
Another highlight of the winter has been David Attenborough's new
12-part series entitled "The Living Planet" which has easily equalled his
previous excellent series "Life on Earth". This series is to be shown world-
wide and overseas members should keep a watch out for it. Amongst the
sequences in the programme covering rain forests is that of displaying

Red and Yellow Diamond Doves and Domestic Pigeons
I have read with interest Mr. W.D. Cummings' letter, commenting on
nine about red and yellow Diamond Doves. Not having had the pleasure
af seeing the Diamond Doves in question, I cannot, with any authority,
luggest whether Mr. Brickell's or Mr. Cummings's descriptions are nearer
vhat I, or others, would see in the birds.
I am, however, puzzled by an apparent contradiction in Mr. Cummings
description. He says: "The colours red and yellow can be likened to those
;ame colours in the domestic pigeon." Then, at the end of the same para-
graph, "The red is clear red, not a brown red."
But all the various shades termed "red" by fanciers of domestic pigeons
ive some shade of reddish brown, not a clear red in the ordinary meaning
of that term. True reds (clear reds) are seen in such birds as Scarlet Tana-
gers, Crimson and Eastern Rosella Parrakeets, and many others, but among
pigeons only in some of the fruit doves Ptilinopus and in some of the
bleeding-heart pigeons Gallicolumba. Similarly the "yellow" of domestic
pigeons is at best a warm sandy buff, certainly not the yellow of, say, a
Golden Oriole, Yellow Wagtail or yellow Canary.
In domestic pigeons the "dominant red" or "ash-red" may be any
shade from a rather washy mauve-tinged greyish brown to a warm reddish
brown on those parts of its plumage which (depending on pattern) would
be black in a bird of the "blue/black" colour. The colour known as
"recessive red" can vary from a dingy reddish brown with considerable
bluish grey tinge on rump and tail to a uniform rich, deep chestnut red ,
which latter is what fanciers breed for in most show breeds of pigeons
(when they are breeding "red" birds, of course).
The other day I received from Mr. Brickell a colour slide of a Diamond
Dove that was classed as a "cinnamon" in a show in South Africa. This
bird, so far as one can see (it is in a show cage and the wings and tail are,
of course, folded so one cannot see inner webs of primaries or rectrices), is
very similar to many "dominant red" domestic pigeons in coloration and,
like them, has washy pale grey primaries and tail.
Let us hope that some artist or photographer will soon favour us with
accurate pictures of all these varieties of the Diamond Dove, either in some
book we can buy or, if the Avicultural Magazine's available cash will run to
it, for publication in our magazine.

THE AVICULTURAL MAGAZINE welcomes original articles that have not been
published elsewhere and that essentially concern the aviculture of a particular bird or
group of birds, or that describe their natural history. Articles should be preferably
typewritten, with double spacing, and the scientific names as well as the vernacular
names of birds should be given. References cited in the text should be listed at the
end of the article. Line drawings should be in Indian ink on thick paper or card;!
photographs which illustrate a particular point in the article will be used where
possible and should be clearly captioned.

THE RARE NDUK EAGLE OWL
Bubo poensis vosseleri or B. vosseleri
AT THE LONDON ZOO
By PETER J. OLNEY
(Curator of Birds)

<bodyText confidence="0.996158391304348" page_id="58080111"  page_num="135" year="" vol="">
This rare forest-dwelling owl is found only in the Usambara Mountains
of north-eastern Tanzania. Very little is known about the bird, and there
have been no more than 20 positive records since it was discovered at the
beginning of this century. It was first described by Reichenow in 1908
from a specimen collected near Amani and sent to the Berlin Museum by
Dr. Vosseler (Kothe and Haase, 1908). Reichenow designated this bird,
which subsequently was shown to be a sub-adult, a new species Bubo
vosseleri. There were no further records until 1962 when a fledgling,
r unable to fly, was found in April in the high forest near Amani, at an
: altitude of about 3,000 ft. This bird was transferred from the East Africa
Malaria Research Institute in Amani to London Zoo in August of the
same year, and died of cardiac and circulatory failure some nine years
later in September 1971. Moreau (1964) used this individual to describe
the juvenile and subsequent sub-adult plumage, and to make comparisons
with the closely related Fraser's Eagle Owl Bubo poensis. He concluded,
on characters of size and pattern of underparts, that the Nduk Eagle Owl
! is a subspecies of poensis.
In December 1971 another individual was presented to the Zoo, having
been taken, in December 1969, as a downy young by local people to the
Research Institute in Amani, where it was looked after by Dr. White and
his wife. They kept it, almost as a house-pet, for nearly two years, feeding
it exclusively on rats and raw beef wrapped in cottonwool. In April 1975
two more birds were received by the Zoo, both having been picked up as

fledglings near Amani. One was found in December 1972, kept at the
Research Institute and fed on beef and occasionally mice. It was so tame
that it was allowed to live in a Jacaranda tree near the building and each
evening would come to collect its food, though it was also seen to hunt
for itself. The second bird was found in late January 1975 on the road
near Amani and when it came to the Zoo in April was still in its white
juvenile plumage with pale bluish beak and very pale bluish feet.
These three birds are still at the Zoo and are, as far as I am aware, the
only ones in captivity. We now know that we have a male and female, and
the other is probably a female. The pair, of which the male was hatched in
Tanzania in late 1969, and the female in late 1974, are housed in an aviary
measuring 18 ft long x 7 ft high x 6 ft wide (5.49 x 2.14 x 1.83 m). There
is a pond, some plants, and a 7 ft (2.14 m) long shelter at the back with a
peat floor, logs and a nest-box. Though generally inactive, especially
during the day, they are obviously now closely bonded. The nesting
season in Tanzania, from the evidence of when the young have been found,
must be between October and March. In the Zoo, what little breeding
behaviour has been seen has been between November and April. This
behaviour has been food-passing (November, December and January), and
calling (November to April), but has not yet led to egg-laying. The single
bird, hatched in Tanzania probably in late October or November 1972,
was separated from the obvious pair in 1981.
They are all fed on rats, mice, or strips of beef with a vitamin/mineral
supplement SA37, and have had no health problems since they arrived,
apart from a recurring 'bumble-foot' in the single bird.
The Nduk Eagle Owl is listed as rare in the Red Data Book (King, 1981;
Collar, 1982) because of its limited distribution and apparent confinement
to the one area of evergreen mountain forest. This habitat has been subject
to considerable destruction, particularly between 1880 and 1935 with
clearance for subsistence farming, and also more recently, with tea and
cardamon cultivation. Though much reduced in size, the remaining forest
areas are mostly within forest reserves even if they are not always ade-
quately protected. Possibly an undisturbed forest is not as essential as was
once thought, for most of the young owls found have been on the ground
in areas cleared for cardamon but where there is still a forest canopy. The
most recent population estimate suggests about 500 pairs, i.e. a density of
two pairs per square kilometre (Stuart, in Collar, 1982).
The problem remains as to whether the Nduk Eagle Owl is a full species
or is a subspecies of the nominate Fraser's. The few people who have
studied the living bird are tactfully non-commital: Moreau (1964) conclud-
ed from plumage similarities, though he was not emphatic, that it is a sub-
species; White (1974) pointed out that the call is similar, but significantly

different to the Fraser's; Olney in White's (1974) paper recorded a number
of differences in plumage between the Nduk and Fraser's, which were not
seen by Moreau. Comparisons between the three individuals now at the
Zoo, and two adult Fraser's also at the Zoo show there are distinct differ-
ences in adult plumage. The most obvious differences are that, compared
with Fraser's, the Nduk Eagle Owl has(l) dark brown patches (the blackish
brown spots noted by Reichenow in his'original description) on the breast,
which are more prominent and extend in two ill-defined lines down each
side of the body (in Fraser's these patches are confined to a broad band
across the upper breast), (2) the dark bars on the underparts are less thick
and more widely spread, and are, therefore, not so clearly differentiated,
(3) the border of the facial disc is wider and darker, (4) the facial disc is
lighter and more orange than orange-brown. The white shoulder bar formed
by the scapulars, which Reichenow used as a diagnostic characteristic in
describing his new species, in fact virtually disappears as the adult plumage
is assumed. In none of the adult Nduk Owls examined at the Zoo has there
been a white shoulder patch, though there have been one or two whitish
scapulars. The type specimen on which Reichenow based his original des-
cription is, therefore, quite definitely a sub-adult.

feathers and make a low clucking sound - chuk, chuk, chuk. There ap-
pears to be no difference between these sounds in the two owls. On three
occasions in November, December and January, in the semi-darkness of
early evening, a series of calls were heard from the Nduk Owls. In each I
case the calls consisted of a repeated (three to four times) regular double
syllable note. This was the same call that White (1974) heard, and different
from the call which he thought was made by Fraser's Owl. The pair of
Fraser's at the Zoo have not been heard to make any call apart from the
alarm 'chuckle'.
There is no doubt that the Nduk Eagle Owl and Fraser's Eagle Owl
are taxonomically close, though there are a number of marked differences.
Whether these differences are sufficient to justify the separation into two
species, or whether the separation should be kept to the subspecies level,
is still a matter of speculation. Fraser's Eagle Owl is found in the forests of
west Africa, across to northern Zaire, with two specimens being taken in
south-west Uganda (Snow, 1978; Britton, 1980). The closest record is still
at least 1000 km from the isolated population of the Nduk Eagle Owl in
Tanzania, and vegetation maps (Keay, 1959) show that the land between is
not forested. It seems likely, and there is corroborating evidence from
other birds, and butterflies (Moreau, 1964), that there must have been at
some time lowland forest extending right across Africa from west to east,
including parts of Uganda and Tanzania where forest no longer exists. The
disappearance of parts of this interlinking forest left isolated populations
in the coastal mountain forests on the eastern side, which have become
sufficiently different to deserve at least subspecies, and in some cases,
species categorisation. This is almost certainly what has happened to the
Nduk Eagle Owl. On the evidence there is at present, I would consider the
Nduk Eagle Owl is justifiably a subspecies, and in an evolutionary time
scale could become a full species.

A common bird, the Red-eared or Red-whiskered Bulbul has a large
range through India, Indo China, southern China and Malaysia. It shows
little fear of man, favouring villages, gardens, cultivated land generally and
is even found in and around large cities;it has also been introduced into the
United States. It is very popular as an aviary bird in Britain and is also
widely kept in its native countries.
The following notes form an account of a successful breeding by a pair
in my possession:
Background
Two birds were received from a dealer in September, 1982; they were
both in poor condition on arrival, neither having tails and, with few wing
feathers, were unable to fly. Their plumage was dirty and soiled, one bird
being almost bald on its head and neck. Their condition was worsened by
having undertaken a 27-hour train journey.

The birds were put into a box cage and the lights remained on through-
out the first two nights; the bald one, being very weak and hardly eating,
was put in a hospital cage where it died during the first night. The survi-
vor recovered well and by 20th November, when it was released into a
small indoor flight, had moulted completely and regained its power of
flight.
A replacement bird arrived in November after a much quicker journey
by road; he too was in poor condition but could fly reasonably well and
by the end of December had completed his moult. His general condition
being much better than the other's had been, he was released into the
flight immediately quarantine ended.
Sexing
I spent a great deal of time studying both birds, eventually coming to
the conclusion that I had a true pair. Initially I was struck by the coarser
build, especially the head and beak of the second bird, the cock, than that
of the hen; however, as he was also slightly bigger I did not discount the
possibility that they belonged to different subspecies. After moulting, the
:ock had a richer, darker brown on his back; furthermore, when the cock,
m intruder, was introduced, he immediately assumed dominance over the
resident hen. My efforts at identification were made easier by the cock
laving a split crest which, as it has not moulted out, I assume to be a per-
nanent fault.
Taming
The hen remained in a box cage for two months, during which time I
endeavoured to tame her. On arrival, as is often the case, she was very wild
and would never feed until I was out of sight. After a few weeks she lost
this terror although she remained very wary and would normally remain
frozen on her perch at the back of the cage whenever I offered her meal-
worms. If I put my hand in the cage, either to change the food pots or to
offer a mealworm, she would panic. The cock, though slightly bolder and
less panicky, behaved in a similar fashion but as he was in his cage much
j less time, could possibly have been tamed if I had tried for longer. When
in their indoor flight, any mealworms were quickly snapped up by a tame
pair of Pekin Robins, purchased at the same time as the cock bird. Any
attempts to tame them in the outside aviary were hopeless, both birds
retreating to the far end whenever I entered. During incubation of eggs and
young, the hen overcame her fear of me, remaining on the nest when I
passed by, little more than 3 ft from her.

The Bulbuls shared their indoor flight amicably with Zebra Finches,
Green Singing Finches, Pekin Robins and a Diamond Dove. On only one
occasion did I observe the cock threaten a particularly cheeky Zebra Finch.
When they had young, the hen became very protective and if, when she
was off the nest, I put my hand too close, she would fly down and attack
it. Both parents would threaten the starlings in adjoining aviaries if the
fledglings were clinging to the wire netting division.
Diet
The regular non-breeding diet consisted mainly of fruit: apples, pears,
bananas, peaches, grapes and oranges, varying with availability, diced into
fine chunks. To this was added mixed dried fruit soaked overnight and
bread mixed with malted food drink, whilst minced beef was offered once
or twice a week. During late summer, elder, hawthorn and blackberries
were offered but these had limited appeal and were often ignored. 'Haith's
Softbill Food' was provided, as well as a few mealworms daily; any millet
or seeds given were totally ignored.
During rearing they were given a mixture of nectar, rice pudding and
hard-boiled eggs, together with nectar in a separate dish; these items they
refused to try at all but possibly, had they been provided earlier, they
might have sampled them. Mealworms, ants' eggs, minced beef and small
grasshoppers were offered daily in large amounts, all of which were relished
and became almost the staple diet during this period. Two days before
nest-building was observed, food intake dropped by a third: the weather
had been very hot for at least a week beforehand but, if anything, con-
sumption had been higher than normal. The amount of fruit taken remained
low until about a week after fledging.
Housing
They remained in their indoor flight throughout the mild winter, the
room was moderately heated and, apart from the initial loss, no problems
were encountered.
On 26th April they were released into an outdoor planted aviary which
measures 2.95 m x 1.52 m x 1.93m high (9ft 8 in x 5 ft x 6 ft 4 in high)
with a small night house, 0.92m x 0.61m (3ft x 2ft). Additional shelter is
provided by covering part of the aviary roof with Perspex. Various shrubs
had been planted, most prominent being a bush of suckers surrounding the
trunk of an old pear tree standing almost centrally in the aviary. The back
is sheltered by a stone wall covered in ivy, whilst the front and right side
have aviaries adjoining. The night house is situated on the left side and is
only accessible from the outside by climbing up from the neighbours'

terraced garden, thus affording the birds plenty of privacy.
Display and courtship
The main drawback of this secluded and thickly planted Bulbul aviary
is that observation of the birds is extremely difficult. With aviaries in front
and to one side and the back wall of stone, the only view I had of them
was from the valley on the roof of our house which, being built on a hill,
was almost at the same level as the aviaries. Even from this uncomfortable,
and in good weather extremely hot, position my view is restricted to half
to two-thirds of the aviary. It is hardly surprising,therefore, that only on
two occasions did I witness an attempted display by these shy birds. Both
were disturbed, the first in early May, by a cat; observation on this occa-
sion was from a different position, my view being obscured partially by
creepers climbing up the side of the aviary and I could not confirm
whether the cock was, in fact, displaying. The second display, in August,
ended when a pear fell on to the aviary roof, but the raising and fanning
of wings and tail whilst calling to the hen corresponded with the descrip-
tion given by Rutgers in The Handbook of Foreign Birds .
Apart from the first display, no interest in breeding was shown what-
soever until the beginning of the nest construction in July, except for the
cock occasionally singing his melodious if repetitive song from a favour-
ite perch; however, the unseasonably wet weather until mid- to late June
may well have been partly responsible.
Nesting
An open-sided nest-box, partly filled with hay, was placed amongst the
ivy on the end wall but the Bulbuls were never interested in this. It was
during a routine inspection of this box on 13th July that I noticed a few
strands of hay and some leaves woven together crudely in the fork of a
pear shoot, about SVzft (1.06 m) off the ground. Leaving as quickly as
possible, I climbed up to my uncomfortable vantage point to watch.
Construction of the cup-shaped nest was undertaken solely by the hen,
with the cock trailing behind, chirping excitedly. Whenever approaching
the nest, she would look round for signs of danger before disappearing into
the bush: the cock rarely visited but would wait until she emerged and
follow her down to the ground where she collected the materials. She com-
pleted her task by the 16th having used hay, grass, feathers, and dead
leaves, lining it with fine grasses.
The first of three eggs was laid on the 19th; the eggs measured approxi-
mately 22-24 x 16-17mm and were pinkish white, heavily blotched with
reddish brown and a few blue-grey markings. Incubation by the hen com-
menced on the 21st; the cock was never seen to feed her and would never

go near the nest, the hen usually coming off to feed, mainly on mealworms,
after I had left the aviary. Before returning, she would bathe thoroughly
in fresh water, afterwards preening herself on a nearby perch, whilst the
cock would sit alongside, sometimes singing to her. These visits would
rarely last more than five minutes and were usually carried out twice daily.
Despite her nervousness, she never left the nest whilst I was in the
aviary but would not return if she had left before I entered, until after I had
gone; if on these occasions I examined the nest, she became very agitated.
On 31st July, after only 10 days' incubation, I discovered eggshells
beside the water dish. I increased the supply of live food, collecting ants' j
eggs and small grasshoppers from a nearby, south-facing bank to supple-
ment the mealworms of which, at that time, I had only a limited supply.
Though the cock was seen to take several of these, he was never seen
feeding them to the young and after carrying them around in his beak for
several minutes, would eat them himself.
Rearing and development
Taking Day 1 as the day following hatching, I have compiled the
following sequence of events. Two chicks hatched which were pinkish
grey with yellowish beaks; the remaining egg disappeared between five
days and fledging, the exact date not known.
Day 1 A thunderstorm during the night gave me cause for concern
but there seemed to be no ill effects.
Day 3 Black pin feathers broke through on the wings and there was
a slight increase in size. They were being fed almost solely on
grasshoppers at this stage.
Day 4 The chicks were seen begging for the first time; before, they
had lain in the bottom of the nest until the hen attracted their
attention.
Day 6 Pin feathers erupted on head, neck and back and started to open
on the head; they had grown well and covered the bottom of
the nest.
Day 8 Feathering well on their backs and wing primaries.
Day 9 Eyes opened for the first time.
Day 10 Apart from having no tails, they were fully feathered.
Day 11 Both chicks left the nest for the first time; initially they perched
just above it, but during the day they flew clumsily about the
aviary. The parents at this time were very nervous, especially
when I entered with mealworms.
The chicks were less than half the size of the adults, their
colouring, though similar to the parents, was a lighter brown on
back and wings, their heads were blackish but, again, not as dark

as the adults; their crests were almost non-existent. Throat and
breast white, speckled with brown, they had no red on them
whatsoever.
They were flying more, the parents following them anxiously.
Both chicks spent the night above the nest and showed no
desire to return.
The chicks had attained more confidence; their tails just begin-
ning to appear.
It was clear that the nest had been re-lined and the cock started
making half-hearted displays to the hen. At 19 days the chicks
were nearly three-quarters grown and by the 20th August the
cock was left in almost sole charge of them. The hen laid the
first egg of a new clutch and began sitting in the afternoon. It
was not until 29th August that they were first seen to feed, one
chick taking some mealworms, although for several days pre-
viously they had both been sitting by the dishes; the following
day both parents refused to feed them, eating any mealworms
themselves. Both young were independent and almost fully
grown by 4th September (Day 35), and, apart from a total lack
of red, resembled their parents.
On 11th September, I first noticed pink feathers round the
vent and, at the time of writing (31st October), the red is just
beginning to appear on their cheeks.
Second Round
Incubation began after the first egg, differing from the first round,
when the hen started after the second. Two chicks hatched out on 1st Sep-
tember, after 11 and 12 days' incubation, the third hatching the following
day, again after 11 days. The weather had deteriorated by this time and,
after three days, the nest began to disintegrate. All the chicks were begging
lustily from two days, something the first clutch rarely did, but by four
days, one had disappeared. It could easily have fallen out of the badly
listing nest but a search of the ground below revealed nothing.
Any attempts of mine to repair the nest resulted in an attack by the
i courageous hen whilst the cock and fledged young joined in the alarm
; chorus. Development of the chicks was about a day behind the first round
but both chicks remained healthy until the evening of the seventh day,
when one fell out; this was found dangling on a briar below the nest. I
attempted to remove it but it was well hooked and the hen became very
alarmed and attacked me. I made quite sure that it was dead, then left it
until the following day, by which time she had lost interest.

The cock was regularly seen feeding the surviving chick and I suspect
that he had fed the first round young as well, thicker foliage allowing him
to be more secretive. The hen removed and ate the faecal sacs and the nest
always remained clean.
The chick was seen perching on the top edge of the capsizing nest after
10 days- it was fully feathered but, with a cold wind blowing, it looked
extremely uncomfortable standing with both eyes closed, refusing food
offered by the parents. Deciding it had left prematurely, I again endeav-
oured to repair the nest, with some success, and placed the chick inside;
the hen, after much scolding, returned to brood the chick when I left. My
hopes of it staying were short lived, for, by lunchtime it had clambered
out. I waited until early evening to replace it but, when it would not stay,
reluctantly I left it out. The night was cold and the chick, which had
eaten little during the day was found dead the following morning.
No further attempts at nesting were made. The old nest finally col-
lapsed about three days after the chick died. During the rearing of the
second round, no aggression was ever shown towards the independent
young birds; they, in return, showed little interest in the chicks except to
join in the alarm calls whenever I interfered with the nest. All four have re-
mained amicably together ever since and will probably remain so until

BREEDING THE BLUE-EYED COCKATOO
Cacatua opthalmica
AT CHESTER ZOO

By PETER J. BLOOMFIELD (Assistant Curator of Birds)
Chester Zoo was lucky enough to purchase a pair of Blue-eyed Cocka-
toos from Mr. J. Best in March 1966. These birds are still in the collection
today and from that original pair we now have a collection of eight birds.
We were presented with a male Blue-eyed Cockatoo by a member of the
public in November 1975; this bird was suffering from a bad case of feather
plucking and has remained in the same state since that time, only on occa-
sions moulting out into good plumage - this happening after breeding.
Nevertheless, he has proved to be a good bird to breed from.
The first breeding occurred at Chester in 1973 when the birds were
housed in an isolated aviary away from the public in the garden of Mr. W.
Timmis, the Curator at that time. The birds were left completely alone
except for feeding, and as a consequence, few records were kept of that
early success. The youngster reared in 1973 turned out to be a female and
so we were able to make up another pair on receiving the presented male
in 1975.
For unexplained reasons, no further breeding took place until 1979
when both pairs of birds, now housed in the Parrot House, produced one
chick each. In both cases, the young bird was reared and they turned out
to be a male and a female. The parent birds had been given a barrel to
nest in, with a top opening, and this was filled three-quarters full with a
mixture of peat and wood chippings which were placed on an upturned
turf cut to a depth of about four inches.
Breeding again took place in 1981 and once more each pair produced
one chick, both of which were reared to maturity and turned out to be
two males.
1982 was a disastrous year for the Blue-eyed Cockatoos. Both pairs
went to nest but an egg from the 1966 pair disappeared, we think to a
predator, and it was then decided to remove the egg from the other pair
and place it in the incubator to avoid the same thing happening to that
egg.
The artificial incubating went well and the bird hatched without any
problems but it did not appear to respond well to the diet we were rearing
it on, despite the fact that it was a diet which had proved successful for
rearing other cockatoos. As a consequence, the bird grew up with a
slight deformity and we had to keep it in its rearing pen in the Parrot

Outside aviaries for Blue-eyed Cockatoos at Chester Zoo
House. It was from here one afternoon in October 1982 that the bird was
stolen, and we have not heard anything more about it since then.
In 1983, our youngest breeding pair went to nest about mid-May and
this time the female laid two eggs which turned out to be fertile. The
first chick was noticed on 14th June and the second on 20th June, the
eggs having first been seen on 11th May. The exact incubation was not
determined but we put it down to approximately 30 days. Both parents
seemed to share the incubation duties and both birds were very pro-
tective of the nesting area whenever it was approached by a keeper. Dis-
turbance by the keepers was kept to a minimum, but the design of the
Parrot House only allows us to place the nesting barrels, at most, 12 ft
from the public, however this does not appear to upset the birds.
We now have a group of eight specimens of this species at Chester
and in February 1983 we sent a pair of these birds to Rotterdam Zoo on
breeding loan. Although our original birds are now getting old, we are
very hopeful for the future of this species at Chester Zoo, and aim to
continue to breed them and keep our colony going. This now seems
especially important in the light of recent correspondence with Mr. Roy
MacKay of the Baiyer River Sanctuary in Papua New Guinea, who
informs me that a party of American bird watchers passed through New
Britain recently and did not record this species at all.

The attached drawing shows the four outside aviaries in the Parrot
House that house our collection of Blue-eyed Cockatoos; these measure 12
x 12 x 12 ft (3m 66cm), with the same measurements for the inside
area.
The diet for the Cockatoos during the breeding season consists of a
normal parrot mix plus a varied selection of fruit and vegetables. On the
hatching of the young, we add soaked seed, egg rearing food, boiled
maize, vitamins including Vionate and Bemax.
As a postscript to those interested in the breeding successes of
psittacines, in September 1981 our male Red-tailed Black Cockatoo was
sent to Rotterdam Zoo, Holland, to make up a pair of this interesting&amp;quot;
species. I am pleased to report that, in the summer of 1982, these birds
reared one youngster to maturity and talking to the Curator of Birds,
Han Assink, on 19th December 1983, he informed me that another
chick was hatched this year and fledged only that morning.

In 1972 I wrote a book about finches. I had been keeping birds for
some 25 years by then. The first birds I ever kept were an unfortunate pair
of Tri-coloured Nuns, as they were invariably referred to in those days. A
friend sold them to me, and lent me a Yorkshire Canary show cage to
keep them in. This lad had been given a couple of elderly Norwich Canary
I hens by his father, and his great ambition in life was to breed a Chaffinch
mule. He reasoned that the best way to do this would be to place a Chaf-
finch's clutch beneath one of his old hens. Then, from the resultant brood
of tame Chaffinches he would select a good young male to breed with his
canary. He never succeeded in rearing the Chaffinches, let alone creating
the elusive Chaffinch mule. However, his case stayed in my mind for many
years afterwards and, together with the experience with the Munias, was
probably as much the cause of my addiction to finches as anything.
When I wrote the book, I attempted to synthesise in one source a ref-
erence to every finch that had ever been recorded as being kept in cap-
tivity. As much as possible, I relied on personal experience, but to cover
all the species in this way would have been impossible. The tally of about
350 was not bad. However, it never occurred to me that in the space of
ten short years my company would send me to three different contin-
ents of the world, nor that in each I would succeed in finding many spe-
I cies of finches that I had not only not kept, nor seen, but had not even
listed in my book. In the following notes I would like to list those spe-
cies. I will also mention species that are in the book but only where I have
learned something new in the intervening years.
My motivation in writing about the birds I have kept is not to lay
down any rules but to prompt readers to add their experiences to the
benefit of all. I am continually surprised, and a little distressed to find
how often there are expert and experienced bird keepers who have never
shared their knowledge - and how many countless thousands of birds
live out their lives non-productively, even anonymously, because their
keepers simply did not realise that the species could be bred (for example)
or might have lived twice as long on a different diet, or might have enchan-
ted the neighbourhood with its song.
From Spain in 1974, I went to live in Venezuela for three years. I
became a director of the Audubon Society there, led expeditions and

outings, and carried out an exhaustive 13-month survey of a large ranch
that covered both hill country and lowland. I set up netting stations for
banding and photographing the local birds. Venezuela is an incredibly
rich country in its variety of geography, and the number of species of birds
being second only to Colombia. From the Andes to the Llanos, the Amazon
to the Caribbean coast, it is a bird-watcher's paradise.
In 1977 we moved to Chicago, living on the lake shore. The migrating
birds moved up the lake shore in vast numbers each spring, and back down
again each autumn. I soon discovered that scores of birds would hit the
windows of the modern ape house at the Lincoln Park Zoo, and also the
enormous McCormick Place Conference Centre. Every day at dawn during
the migration seasons I collected dead and injured birds, keeping perfect
specimens for painting, nursing invalids back to health (and being forced
to keep some over winter) and consequently became a good friend of the
Curators of Birds at the Zoo and the Field Museum. My job at that time
took me around the world two or three times a year but, living in the US,
I could neither import nor export any birds.
In 1980 we moved to Tokyo. I soon contacted the Yamashima Insti-
tute and they introduced me to a man who is the main importer of birds
into Japan, and nearly all of his stock comes from China. We have become
good friends and he saves me "new" species and odd individuals of great
interest.
In each of the three countries I have discovered the pet shops where
the owner is a bird enthusiast and, in the case of Venezuela and Japan, the
source of local native birds.
It can readily be seen by the reader that my peripatetic life has enabled
me to acquire a very wide experience of bird life, and bird keeping, but I am
equally lacking in profound experience. Not since I left England to live in
Denmark in 1967 have I had my own good-sized aviary where I have been
able to keep birds in something approaching a natural situation. Some of
my cages have been large - I have kept owls, magpies, toucans, rollers,
parrots, buzzards and others - and I have bred some finches. I mention
this to avoid giving the wrong impression. My bird keeping has been rather
more like that of Arthur G. Butler than that of Frank Meaden. So, if the
reader has kept any of the species mentioned in the following notes and
can add to the information given, please write to the Editor.
F*i any reader who has a copy of my original book, I would like to
point out that the list of 'Records of Birds Bred in Captivity" (pages
~9_-303) does include references to lengthy and valuable reports that are
not bleedings, but will be of considerable utility to ah aviculturist intent
on breeding the birds concerned. This is clarified in the introduction
(page 16) but not in the introduction to the list on page 292. This over-

sight on my part led my good friend Derek Goodwin, in his review of the
book, to say ".(I find myself) not only credited with the breeding of
those waxbills with which (I) succeeded, but with two - Jameson's Fire-
finch and Black-crowned Waxbill - with which (I) did not!" In each case,
in fact, I had recorded the reference for the first successful breeding, and
then added the Goodwin references for the benefit of the researcher. Both
of those being infinitely more readily available to the average reader than
the Avicultural Magazine for 1935 and 1936 - and, if I may say, much
more useful references for somebody attempting to breed the species
himself.
Several years ago the name Charles Sibley gained some notoriety on
account of the studies this scientist was carrying out. It seemed that he
needed the albumen from the eggs of birds to analyse the chromosomes
in the protein. There were several cases where the eggs of rare birds of
prey had been obtained, and the judge in the ensuing court cases always
seemed to speak up on the side of the protectionists and against the
researchers. Since then Sibley's DNA studies have become widely recog-
nised, and there is little doubt that considerably valuable and relevant
discoveries have resulted. I regret that I cannot give a reference, since the
following came by the way of personal correspondence from a friend
who attended a symposium last year in the USA. It seems that in a paper
presented by Dr. Sibley and two associates, A.H. Bledsoe and J.E. Ahlquist,
DNA-DNA hybridisation comparisons indicated that several South Ameri-
can "finch" genera (Sicalis, Volatinia, Haplospiza, Oryzoborus and Diuca )
are tanagers, not emberizines. Other genera ( Tersina, Catamblyrhynchus,
Nephelornis and Cyanerpes) are also tanagers. For the purpose of this
paper, I have left the former group in my collection of finches, but it is
certainly worth recording the fact here.

The buntings are perhaps the most disparate and most widely distribu-
ted subfamily of finches. They range across North America and Asia to
Japan where political and legal restrictions result in very many species
being unknown to the average aviculturist and - in many cases - virtually
unknown to the serious ornithologist as well. It is this group that has
produced the most exciting discoveries for me, in each of the four con-
tinents in which I have lived.

CHESTNUT BUNTING Emberiza rutila

<bodyText confidence="0.987408837837838" page_id="58080130"  page_num="148" year="" vol="">
From the coloured plate in a text book one could assume that this bird
is a race of the Red-headed Bunting E. brunniceps but in life it is signifi-
cantly different. It is a smaller bird, noticeably so, and with a more lively,
tit-like nature. The males in autumn are extremely variable, depending on
age, but it is always easy to distinguish the sexes.
My birds showed a liking for plain canary seed and the occasional meal-
worm. They are peaceable in a mixed collection, in my experience, and if
anything are inclined to be slightly cowed by their more robust companions
(e.g. Yellow-browed and Red-cheeked Buntings). A lone male kept in a
cage by itself sang sweetly, and often.
JAPANESE GREY BUNTING Emberiza variabilis
This is a largish bunting, fairly typical in shape and character with a
slightly longer tail than usual.lt varies in length from 6Vz to 7 in (16.5 to
17.8 cm). An adult male is instantly recognisable, being grey all over with
a horn coloured bill, pink legs, and whitish undertail. The juvenile male is
similar but more brown and heavily streaked above. The female is a very
difficult bird to identify if seen separately, being buff below, well streaked,
brown and heavily streaked above. The pale malar stripe is very noticeable
and a russet rump also distinctive. Neither bird has any white in the tail.
My experience with this bird is very limited. I bought a single male in a
pet shop in Tokyo. It was very wild and had been kept in a secluded cor-
ner in the company of a few Chestnut Buntings. Its plumage is remarkable,
being thick and soft with a dense black down at the base of the body
feathers. Despite being essentially grey all over, it is a beautiful species.
During the six weeks I had it in my collection it was very active, apparent-
ly quite fit, but one morning I found it dead.
Many finches will live quite happily on what is virtually an all seed diet
until they sicken with something. Then they will begin eating soft food,
mealworms, fruit, in fact almost anything. Very often such birds will pre-
fer to eat only one kind of seed. This Grey Bunting showed no such ten-
dencies at all. It was quite a mystery.
Subsequently I found a female that I kept over the winter of 1983/3.
It too was very wild and never settled down. It also had a very dense down
on the body feathers. It was occasionally irritable with other birds with
which I kept it.
It is a bird of thickets and is happy in cover. Given the chance, I would
keep it in a well-planted, roomy outdoor flight.

the white malar stripe of that more familiar bird. This species also lacks
the black head in fresh winter plumage, but on the male there are clear
vestiges of black showing that will distinguish it from the female. The
female can be told from the European bird by the lack of streaking on the
breast, and an even, rust-coloured rump.
Out of a shipment of about 2000 birds from northern China, there was
just one pair of this lovely bird. They were both sick, suffering from
gastro-enteritis, and the female soon died. The male lingered on for some
weeks, regularly suffering a relapse before eventually dying. From two
sick birds one can hardly get an accurate idea of what the species is like as
an avicultural subject.
From this limited experience, however, together with some observations
in the wild, I would say that the male is a bold territorial bird, an open
songster, and a good subject for a collection.

TRISTRAM'S BUNTING Emberiza tristrami

<bodyText confidence="0.998811375" page_id="58080131"  page_num="149" year="" vol="">
A sparrow-sized bird with the sexes rather similar, and not easy to sex
in winter plumage. The head of the male is black with a white stripe down
the centre of the crown, white eyebrow superciliaries, a white malar stripe
and a small white patch behind the ear coverts. The upper parts and flanks
brown, reddish, streaked on back wings and flanks. The female's head is
dark brown, her throat is whitish, and ear coverts huffish. The Yellow-
browed Bunting is quite similar but can be told by the yellow on the fron-
tal superciliary.
It may also be referred to as the Black-throated Bunting, or Taiga Bunt-
ing. It has a small distribution in Manchuria and winters in Korea and
China.
From the big importation mentioned earlier, I sorted out many corpses
and identified several bodies as being- Tristram's Bunting. I kept a good
pair for painting. To look at, they are extremely dull and unexceptional
birds in any sense. According to the Japanese importer they are rather
delicate and of little interest.

Another sparrow-sized bunting from Siberia that migrates south to

likely to show up in dealers' lists in winter plumage, it might well be con-

are a little duller yet.
This is another rather dull and drab species that I could only recom-
mend for the dedicated bunting enthusiast. No doubt in a roomy aviary
one would see the bird at its best, fit males would sing and become more
showy. However, it was not at all noteworthy. As with the preceding spe-
cies I have only collected this bird from those dead on arrival from China.

<bodyText confidence="0.999776714285714" page_id="58080132"  page_num="150" year="" vol="">
A delightful and slender little bunting, indigenous to Japan. It is yel-
lowish all over, olivaceous on the upper head becoming brownish on the
back, wings and tail. The head is an even colour except for dark lores and
a most distinctive whitish eye ring. The bird also has two pale wing bars.
The female is similar to the male but a little paler and duller. Not always
easy to sex.
This is a prized and popular cage bird in Japan. While a few specialised
shipments get out of China each year, the Japanese prefer to keep the
locally-caught birds. Only males are kept, as the females are not regarded
as songbirds.
In a large cage with other species of bunting, it seems to be a slight and
delicate species. But, despite the overwhelming similarity of many bunt-
ings, the white eye ring of this one, while not being unique, is very dis-
tinctive. I had great difficulty in obtaining a female. The various shipments

ually I did sort out one female from a cage of about 40 males. I have
found that the text books that show both sexes in colour all seem to exag-

The lone male I kept over one winter developed into a sweet songster,
but not an exuberant extrovert by any means.

On one occasion, while inspecting a shipment of birds from China, I
saw an unknown single bird which I immediately bought. I am ashamed to
say that I could not identify it. I finally forced myself to recognise it as a
Yellowhammer.Demenfev says that the eastern race erythrogenys is a
little smaller, less yellow, less streaked on the flanks and less yellow on the
head. This bird was distinctly smaller than the European Yellowhammer. I
kept it from October through to June and my hopes that it was a young
male were not realised. There is nothing like wishful thinking in an avi-
culturist to keep cages full and crowded, is there? I released it before
taking off on home leave that summer.

in identifying it. The importer and the man from the museum both had no
doubts, however.
In personality it was a lively but very steady bird that kept its crest
erect most of the time. The browns of the face and back were very soft
and lovely. Whilst it was very peaceful it was always first to the meal-
worms which it gobbled with great enthusiasm. It was a frequent and en-
thusiastic bather as well. I have since kept several pairs under varying con-
ditions and found this to be a peaceful and beautiful bird, and a fine
songster.
ELEGANT BUNTING Emberiza elegans
In my book I reported that it was a highly prized cage bird in Japan
where it was valued as a song bird. The bird I kept in England 20 years ago
was not a songster, and I could find no record of its song in the literature.
I speculated that it might not be such a good songster by western standards.
Since coming to Japan I have kept it on several different occasions. I
bought a pair in 1980, and since females are very rare in captivity, hoped
to be able to export them to England for breeding but, failing to get a
licence, I released them. I then bought a locally-caught Japanese bird and
kept it over the winter of 1981-82. It settled well, sang occasionally in
company but when caged by itself quickly became a rich and persistent
songster and I could see that its reputation and price (a good male would
be about #40 to #50) were justified.
Subsequently I kept another solitary male which would frequently
throw its head back and utter a short sweet phrase which became rather a
bore because of the lack of development or variation. I found that they
all ignored greenfood, fruit and mealworms, but when I put some greenfly-
infested branches in their cages, they gobbled them eagerly.

Previously I had written of the Rustic Bunting, "I doubt whether these
or any other small buntings from the north of Europe would stay fit and
in perfect condition if deprived of insect food permanently." I had kept a
pair in a large, planted garden aviary and had drawn this slightly odd con-
clusion from watching their behaviour and great affection for mealworms.
In Japan I have kept a fine pair of the large race to our north, known as
the Kamchatkan Rustic Bunting. I should interject here that some author-
ities do not recognise any subspecies of this bird. I believe the plumage
variations and sizes may be individual and not geographic. In this case,
the male was a full half-inch longer than the female and much more boldly
marked. She appeared more sandy in coloration too. They were good and
lively cage birds that settled very well, showed a distinct preference for

canary seed and took the occasional mealworm.
Regarding the food issue, it seems unnecessary to keep buntings on
seed all year round. I have noticed in Japan it is common for dealers to
feed buntings, and other finches, on softfood in the summer months. If
kept indefinitely on dry hard seed, some birds will develop melanistic or
pure white feathers.
LITTLE BUNTING Emberiza pusilla
Herbert Murray wrote to me telling me about his Little Buntings. He
had a pair that he found quite inoffensive. The sexes were distinctly di-
morphic in breeding plumage, but in fresh autumn plumage they became
very similar indeed. They nested - on the ground - but never hatched
young. These birds spent most of their time on the ground, seeming to
eat a wide variety of food and giving the impression of being quite insecti-
vorous, especially during the breeding season.

I have received a few odd single birds from northern China. In my cages
they have always been peaceful, very shy and easily disturbed by their
more rumbustious and larger congenors. I would say they were definitely
best kept in secluded and peaceful - meaning uncrowded - quarters. One
male sang freely and sweetly, with a Skylark-like continuance. A note I
have made says that the chestnut cheek patches are not diagnostic in
autumn plumage. It may be distinctive in Europe, but in Asia many
buntings have very similar plumage. One bird I bought had several white
feathers, in matched even positions - outer tail and inner greater wing
coverts. They successfully disguised the bird. I believe the shipper had
kept it on simple seed (mainly millet) for a long time.

This bird may be rare in western aviculture but it appears regularly in
the trade in Japan and Hong Kong. I have kept it twice now, each time
selecting a good pair for painting. An old adult male in early summer is
most strongly marked and the touch of yellow on the black-and-white
striped head is very clear. In flight, away from the observer, the russet
rump and white outer tail is very noticeable.
In fresh autumn plumage the sexes are very similar, but males definitely
seem (and usually are, in fact) larger. From the number dead out of a
shipment of 2000 or so from China, I would say that they did not travel
well, and my first pair arrived with gastro-enteritis that took me ages to
cure. In general it seems to be a peaceful bird but I have clear memories
of a female occasionally being irritated and rather bitchy. One note in my
diary remarks on them being "a little pushy". They took both green food
and mealworms and were most enthusiastic bathers.

Also known as the Masked Bunting, but something of a misnomer.
Basically a typical yellow-bodied bunting, brownish and streaked above,
female duller than the male but similar. The four distinct subspecies all
differ mainly by head markings but when seen live, the races are suf-
ficiently different as to appear to be different species. By an extraordinary
stroke of good fortune, I have kept - or have corpses -of all four.
The nominate race E.s. spodocephala I have not kept, but retrieved
several fine corpses from the disastrous shipment mentioned a few times
already. Of the four subspecies, the adult male of the nominate race is the
one that truly justifies its name as its head is entirely grey with a slight
olive tinge and a little streaking. E.s. oligoxantha is similar but noticeably
paler with only a slight yellow tinge to a white belly. The grey head is
much paler.

E.s.extremi-orientis is regarded as synonymous with E.s. melanops by
some authorities. We had several birds of both "types" in the shipment,
identified by the skins from the Yamashima Institute, and I found the for-
mer similar but not as brightly coloured as the latter. These birds are some-
what olivaceous on the head, yellow below and streaked on the flanks. The
Japanese race E.s. personata is the brightest of all, but quite variable. It is
the only race with a yellowish chin and throat.
Six extremi-orientis/melanops birds arrived with bad gastro-enteritis
and most soon succumbed. The sexes were very difficult to distinguish in
fresh autumn plumage. In their healthier periods they ate a variety of seeds,
nibbled greenfood and took mealworms. The Japanese birds I have kept
have settled well, but males have definitely tended to be aggressive, to
their own females especially but eventually settled down to peaceful co-
existence. They definitely preferred canary, hemp and white millet, taking
a little greenfood and a few mealworms. In roomy, uncrowded quarters
the male is bold, displays himself well, and is a cheerful and regular song-
bird. I think they would make a positive addition to a roomy mixed un-
crowded aviary.

Not much has been written about this bird in confinement, least of all
breeding. I note that it was first bred by Teschemaker in 1909, but was
delighted to see that P.J. Adams bred them in 1981 and reported the de-
tails on the front page of Cage and Aviary Birds (1st May, 1982). They
bred in a roomy, well-planted aviary. After a couple of occasions when the
nestlings died at five weeks, Mr. Adams took a brood from the nest at
eight days and hand-reared them. Not enough breeders bother to report
their breedings and many of those who do fail to give the kind of details
that other aviculturists find particularly relevant. Mr. Adams is one of the
good ones and he reports on diet in great detail. The staple diet for his
Cirl Buntings is plain canary, paddy rice and millet sprays. In the breeding
season they also have Avivite insectile mixture mixed with grated cheese,
moistened with honey, and blended with chopped mealworms peppered
with Vionate. A point of distinction worth noting is that 30 to 40 moths
were taken daily, collected with the aid of a mercury lamp.

paler with dark brown on the head instead of black. The books may refer
to this bird as Siberian Meadow Bunting and Dement'ev gives each race a
different adjective.
The Siberian Red-eared Bunting, E.c. cioides , is basically a Siberian
bird and it has reddish-brown ear-coverts as the name suggests. The Chin-
ese Red-eared Bunting E.c. castaneiceps comes from China and Korea and
has brown ear-coverts. Both races may migrate a little southwards in the
winter but appear not to reach the areas from which birds are commonly
exported to Europe. A few may come out of Hong Kong. The Japanese
Red-eared Bunting E.c. ciopsis has black ear-coverts and does not occur
outside Japan.
For me, it is a common bird, that can be found easily in lowland forest
and cultivated fields and open countryside. The male is a bold and fre-
quent singer, perching on an exposed branch and seems quite unafraid of
one approaching close. I have kept a few pairs for painting and found them
to settle very well. Females were far less steady than males. I also acquired
a fine pair of the Chinese race which I was fortunate enough to be able
to send to England a couple of years ago for a serious A.S.P.E.B.A. breeding
attempt. My diary contains the following notes on feeding: great fondness
for canary seed, and took canary mixture readily but ignored the hemp.
Mealworms were taken occasionally but not with the frantic enthusiasm
that some buntings display. A female kept over one winter settled well and
sang well and sweetly in the spring before being released. The Chinese
birds were enthusiastic bathers but in contrast the Japanese birds were not.

The first recorded breeding of this bird was in 1930 in the Avicultural
Magazine (page 311), referring to A. Martin's achievement in 1911 but
virtually nothing has been recorded that can encourage the aviculturist. A
more recent breeding by Mr. Hodges of Devizes was printed in Cage and
Aviary Birds (5th July, 1980). The birds bred in a small aviary that was
sparsely planted. The young were fed on soaked seed, small maggots, "nectar
blend", and insectile mixture, and the report also made mention of
".ants' eggs when available". There was some aggressive behaviour
toward a Singing Finch and a cock Firefinch. the Singing Finches were
removed at one point.

Another bunting my old friend wrote to me about was the Crested

In his considerable experience it did better in a large flight. He said it took
a wide variety of food. I watched it in the giant walk-through bird zoo
aviary in Singapore where it was obviously doing very well. I suspect that
climate is a key factor.There is a good recent reference to the breeding
of the Black-crested Bunting Melophus lathami by Mats Tell in the
Avicultural Magazine (1983, Vo. 89, 3, pp. 133-135). I believe it is the
same species asAf. melanicterus.

6-7 in (15-18 cm) long, sparrow-sized and rounded of body. At a glance
a typical North American bunting. Brownish above with brown to black
streaking and centres of flights^ white edges to median wing coverts and
pale tips to greater wing covers give two wing bars. Blackish stripes on
head, white superciliaries with the part between the eye and the bill yellow.
Distinctive difference is white throat with greyish cheeks, sides of throat
and upper breast. There is a colour form of this species with the super-
ciliary cream or pale brown.
Juvenile birds are duller, more streaked below, and less distinctly
marked on the head. It is not so easy to tell juveniles from freshly-moulted
adults in the autumn.
According to Peterson, the two colour forms, brown-striped heads and
black-and-white striped heads, occur in both sexes, but the species pairs
polymorphically. However, this is not confirmed in the Audubon encyclo-
paedia.
This is a ground-feeding species - like so many North American buntings.
It hops forward over leaves and ground debris, scratching with a forward-
and-sideways kicking movement, each foot moving outwards. They are
noisy and active feeders. It is important to know this about these and
related species because it makes them somewhat unsuitable as cage birds.
I have kept them in small normal cages, and large flight cages. In the
latter I have covered the floor of the cage with peat, leaves and bark, and
scattered seed and mealworms. In this way, the birds kept active and
obviously in better condition. Sick birds recovered much more rapidly
in this cage type. However, the mess caused in the room is not funny, and
dust will get everywhere, so be warned. They are excellent birds for a
roomy open aviary that is well planted with shrubs and trees where you

For some reason this was the most common species to crash into
the shore line windows in Chicago. To begin with, I brought every dazed
staggering bird home - up to a dozen at a time - but my limited facilities
could not cope. I kept a late juvenile over winter one year and it was a
model cage bird. My notes suggest that it is not an aggressive bird under
normal circumstances (I kept singing males in the spring). It was the
first species to the clean bath every morning and first to the mealworm
bowl. In North America it is too common to be regarded as an ideal
aviary subject, but clearly it is a species well worth keeping and studying.
Incidentally it has hybridised with several other American sparrows.
HARRIS'S SPARROW Zonotrichia querula
Eight individuals of this species were donated to the Lincoln Park Zoo,
fChicago, while I lived there. The curator gave them a large (20 ft/6 m
long or more) flight with a few companions like thrushes to provide a little
variety and extra interest for the public. I visited often, drew them, and
discussed them. They seemed to be rather dull in the sense that they sat
around a lot doing nothing. In contrast a Shama and some Swainson's
Thrushes that I remembe^ were always active and on the move, and a
White Wagtail was a joy, running up and down the stream and pond.
Harris's Sparrow is a big bird and apparently a peaceful and gentle species.

Sparrows, these birds are very intelligent and will never enter a trap twice.
They quickly learned to spot a mist net and would jink up and over, or
into reverse with amazing skill.
One year I caught several individuals with balled swellings of the feet.
Most of these I kept in an attempt to cure them. Some bad cases required
surgery, but in general I found a vitamin-rich diet, combined with daily
application of a cortisone cream, usually did the trick. Some cases were
actually cured by diet alone. It seemed to me that the habit some people
had of throwing out rice and white bread was causing the damage.
Herbert Murray wrote to me in Venezuela to tell me of his experience
with the species. He said: "The last time I had this bird it bred in my
aviaries. The nest was placed near the roof about 6 ft (lm 83) above
ground level. The adjoining aviary was being re-roofed and the cock bird
escaped. There were young in the nest at the time. The cock did not
disappear but stayed close by, hunting for insects which it passed to the
hen through the wire roof. When repairs were completed the cock was
recaptured and returned to the family. The young were reared."
To the best of my knowledge that is the only recorded breeding of the
Rufous-collared Sparrow. Incidentally, in my book I wrote " females
are similar but are a little larger." That may well be true of southern
races from Argentine or Chile, but in Venezuela I found the bird to be
impossible to sex visually. There is a tremendous amount of variation of
plumage. I once drew a series of detailed head markings to check this
and provide a record and came to the conclusion that the coloured plas-
tic bands were not really necessary as - with a bit of concentration and
practice - every individual could be identified by its head and throat
patterns.

variable in density and amount of colouring (there have been 31 races

In my experience it is a bird of suburban gardens, parks and shrubby
woodland, but in fact it ranges over a wide variety of habitat. The Song
Sparrow leeds on the ground, taking insects of various kinds, berries
and small Iruits, and all kinds of seeds. I found it very easy to keep on a
diet ot mixed seed, a few mealworms and seeding weeds like chickweed.

with fierce energy. I have no doubt that in a mixed collection a fit male
Song Sparrow might cause problems if there are similarly-plumaged species
present.
Mrs. Nice wrote a great deal about the Song Sparrow forty or so years
ago, and I believe that her exhaustive studies included keeping birds in
cage and aviary. Anybody fortunate to be able to keep a pair would be
well advised to obtain copies of Mrs. Nice's work, if possible. The Song
Sparrow is a night migrator and so was one of species I collected in
numbers as a result of window strikes at crack of dawn. One bird that I
picked up had a broken leg and a dropped wing. It was extremely ner-
vous for the first couple of weeks but it gradually settled, and became
quite tame. The wing healed, but always drooped a little. Similarly the leg
also mended, and was able to grip a perch but it too was permanently a
little askew. I kept this bird in a flight cage with a pair of Bengalese. The
Bengalese had a globular wicker basket that they always roosted in, and
pretended to breed in. To my fascination the Song Sparrow always roosted
in this basket, sharing it with the female Bengalese. The male Bengalese,
however, could not take this and would go off to a quite corner to roost
alone.
This individual Song Sparrow sang a great deal, softly and very sweetly,
and also during the night. I was very sad to release it late in May by which
time it was clearly fit and healthy again.

5-6 in (12.5-15.5 cm) long, very similar to the Song Sparrow but with a
shorter, rounder tail. The eyebrown superciliary is greyish and the bird is
noticeably greyer on the side of the head and neck. Also the breast has a
band of cream, finely streaked. This may form a spot in the centre of the
breast but it is unlikely to be the cause of a mistake in identification.
In the wild this is a secretive, skulking and shy little bird that seems to
live entirely on the floor of dark shrubby woodland. Roger Tory Peterson
says that it is "...afraid of its shadow", and I think this is an apt reference.

5-6 in (12.5-15.5cm) long, it is a smaller bird than its measurements
suggest because of a longer tail than is usual in American sparrows. It is a
rusty brown bird above, not so streaked as most finches, and buffy below
without any streaking. The bill is a distinctive pink, and there is a notice-
able whitish eye ring. The sexes are alike and I was not able to find any
difference among those that I found.
One bird I found almost dead during the spring migration of 1978 I
took home and placed in a small cage with a mystery Munia hybrid that
I had been given. It settled immediately, becoming close (literally) friends
with the Munia. They roosted tightly snuggled up to each other. It took a
I wide variety of seeds, soft food and a few mealworms. It impressed me as
being a lively and active bird, rather tit-like in its behaviour. Another
individual that I picked up settled down very well but I see from my notes
that while it ate a variety of seeds, it showed no interest in mealworms,
fruit or greenfood.

impressed by their size, for they are big finches. I was also impressed at the
considerable variation in plumage * amount of rufous, extent of streaking,
etc. It would be tempting to infer some sexual dimorphism here but there
is none. Despite the large size of the species, I found it to be peaceful and
none of the smaller sparrows ever seemed to feel threatened. One individual
had obviously crashed very heavily into the windows for it was badly con-
cussed and had great difficulty co-ordinating its feeding. It would crack
seed and crumble it but not actually swallow. It went light and died, one
of the very few losses I ever experienced in Chicago.
Having now seen a lot of this species in the wild, I can thoroughly
endorse my earlier remarks in my book. It is a handsome finch and well
worth the space it would need. It is also a fine songster, considered by
many to be the best of the American sparrows. Incidentally, my notes
indicate that Fox Sparrows will eat a wide variety of seeds, but I made no
record of them taking mealworms.

One dawn, at the end of the autumn of 1978, I was walking around the
McCormick Place Conference Centre, wondering whether there would be
any late migrants when I came across an exhausted and nearly dead Tow-

before it showed signs of life. I kept it over winter and released it in the
spring. It was an utter joy to keep. Despite its large size it was quite peace-
ful and never threatened another bird. It came into full song in the early
spring. Just two days after releasing the male, I collected a female in exactly
the same place where I had found the male six months earlier. It was in
mucfl better shape, and was released just a week later.

In my notes I recorded that the sexes are alike. This is not accurate. In
the field in autumn they are certainly all very much alike, and a freshly-
moulted male will look exactly like an old female. In the spring, however,
the males are clearly a more distinctive grey, lacking the brownish wash of
the female. Immature birds in the autumn have a slight streaking on the
breast and flanks.
I picked up considerable numbers of these birds, both live and dead.
They were always lively and highly-strung and in most cases were released
as soon as they were feeding well and obviously recovered. Those that I
kept for longer periods remained shy and nervous. They are similar to the
Diuca Finch Diuca diuca in appearance, but very different in personality.
My birds always kept to the floor of their cages and it was rare to see them
perched. I once saw a couple in a dealer's cage in Chicago. The man ob-
viously knew he was running foul of the law by keeping a native bird but
he claimed they came into the country with a bunch of exotics. As in my
direct experience, they sat about on the floor of the cage.
In America the Junco is often called the Snow Bird as it appears in
numbers when snow is on the ground, and it is a common visitor to
feeding stations. On these occasions it will often fly to a bird table to
feed, but will clearly prefer to feed on the ground searching for scattered
seeds. I have no experience of any of the races other than the Slate-coloured.
From a study of their varying habitats, nonetheless, I would guess they
would all respond to a similar care and diet in an aviary.

My diary in Venezuela reads as follows: recently fledged birds caught at
Camatagua, late October '75. Adult male and young female kept. They
sorted over seeds furiously, obviously looking for something else. Gave
both mixtures, plus insectile mix, green grass seeds and mealworms. The
latter were quickly eaten, also a mealworm beetle. The female accepted
handfeeding three times, but she was very weak and did not adapt quickly.
The handfeed was a mix of cream cheese, chopped mealworms and Vionate.
She was well-streaked on the breast, slightly greyer with the cap definitely
browner. An immature male was caught showing short but well defined
crest (half in "paint brushes"). It was quite vociferous when caught.
These are surprising birds in the wild and definitely"ctf regular "Finches".
They are rather like regular warblers found in woodland, feeding among
the leaves in low canopy foliage and dense shrubberies where there is
little or no seed to be found. Over a couple of years I caught them many
times and often kept them for a day or two deliberately to see if they
would take seed. I always had difficulty, usually serious difficulty in keep-

ing them. They never took dry seed, and sometimes would not even take
mealworms. I often sat by a netting station in the foothills and watched
them hunting for insects beneath the leaves. Males can occasionally be
seen singing, short simple bursts, repeated continually. A song that was not
at all structured or melodic according to my ear.
The reader should note that these notes refer to newly-caught birds.
I have had 20 years' experience with keeping newly-caught wild birds in five
continents and rate this species as one of the most difficult. Birds that
survive in the bird trade must be rather robust. The fact that they take
seed is no reason to keep them on such a diet. I revise my book, they
should not be treated as if they were "normal" buntings. Incidentally, I
have been told by a friend that the Sibley egg white protein analysis
studies indicate that the Coryphospingus and Rhodospingus are tanagers.

Herbert Murray told me about a pair he had kept. They preferred 'a
low bush to live in'. His birds attempted to breed one year. According to
Herbert, they built a perfectly good nest, laid a full clutch, sat and brooded
perfectly, and hatched them. However, a pair of European Goldfinches had
built their nest close by, and their brood hatched about the same time.
Both adult Red-crested Finches seemed to be distracted by the nestling
Goldfinches, and fed them rather more often than they did their own
brood. Unfortunately, the Goldfinches did not return the compliment.
The Red-cresteds would feed the Goldfinches whole mealworms, which
appeared to go down very well.
The outcome of the story is that the Goldfinches fledged, strong and
healthy, while the Coryphospingus died in the nest.
I bought a pair of these birds in Caracas. They were part of a shipment
from Argentina. They mixed in very well with other small finches in
their enclosure. They adored mealworms, took lettuce eagerly, and were
equally fond of apple and orange. I have not observed them in the wild. In
Chicago there were a few in the open birdhouse of the Lincoln Park Zoo.
Under pseudo-tropical conditions they behaved very much like the Pileated
Finches in Venezuela. There was an excellent report in Cage and Aviary
Birds recently by Stuart K. Johnson. The birds successfully bred in a small
planted aviary shared only with some Chinese Painted Quail. The young
were reared on "small live food and egg yolk". Mr. Johnson declared the
ambition to establish a breeding strain.

its behaviour in this habitat it has apparently developed much the same
set of characteristics, being intelligent, bold, strident but very wary of man.
For about 18 months I set traps in and around my garden, banding every
bird I caught and carefully noting all its specifics before releasing it. The
Saffron Finch proved to be a very hard bird to trap. A decoy would always
pull in immatures and if one were able to catch one of a pair, using it as a
decoy would be sure to catch the other, but, as with House Sparrows, it is
almost impossible to catch the same bird twice.
Venezuelan Saffron Finches are sexually polymorphic and it is extremely
difficult to distinguish the sexes unless in the hand. With a known (banded
as a rule) pair under regular observation, the male can be seen to be bigger, j
bolder and more upright.
They retain juvenile plumage until their third year^pairing and breeding
in the second year. During this second year males show more yellow than
the females, a difference not noticeable in the first, third or, as far as I
could tell, subsequent years. The fully adult male in definitive plumage
tends to be more orange on the crown than his mate.
The many younger birds I kept all settled well and were amiable
enough. Older birds tend to be more aggressive. I agree with Arthur Butler
when he said many years ago that sparrow would be a more appropriate
appellation than finch. However, the rest of the genus is a homogenous
group of grassland finches, and S. flaveola seems to be the aberrant one.

In my book, I correctly described the male as being dull olivaceous all
over with a black head, but somewhat misleadingly described the female as
being a "duller, drabber version". I failed to convey that she lacks any
black on head or breast. This is an important distinction to prevent a
young male being taken for a female. Immatures are a duller, slightly
browner olive but males show traces of black at a very early age. However,
they do not acquire the rich black until a full moult.
Thanks to a very exhaustive and comprehensive banding programme, I
did a thorough population study in the suburb of Caracas where I lived. I
found the old males to be quite territorial, defending an area the size of a
tennis court, but many immatures drifted through, hanging around for
weeks and months. Fully black-faced males were immediately challenged
and driven away by fierce song and display chases.
The nest is a spherical affair made entirely of dry grasses with an en-
trance hole at the side, normally placed in a shrub or bush 3-5 ft from the
ground. The nestlings will eject themselves very easily, as do all tropical
species in my experience, then sit dejectedly in some secluded spot
chirruping regularly. I found that if nestlings were placed in a cage, the

They settle very easily in captivity and, like their cogenors, the better-
known Cuban and Olive Finches, are good subjects for domestication.
They take all kinds of seed readily, some fruit (mine liked orange and
papaya) and I often saw them combing the stems of weeds apparently
looking for insects, aphids, or something similar. Paul Schwarz and I both
found it an easy to bird to handrear.

I found this bird along the northern cordillera of Venezuela. It is such a
dull-coloured bird amongst the brackens and brown grasses as to be very
hard to see. When one flies up out of a hummock and drops down into
some ferns it looks exactly like the very common Black-faced Grassquit.
However, an adult male of the latter will defy you with a burst of song as
you pass, and it is possible to find him quite often because of this. I am
not aware of the Dull-coloured Grassquite doing this. Both Paul Schwarz
and I kept it with other Tiaris spp. and with some Sporophila spp. Paul
went to far as to hand-rear them and record the songs, calls, etc., and make
sound spectrographs. Neither of us had any doubt that this bird is a Tiaris
Grassquite and not a Sporophila seedeater, as listed in most reference
books today.
It does, in fact, have a song, but it is much weaker than that of the
Black-faced. The sexes are absolutely alike. It is very easy to cater for.
JACARINI FINCH Volatinia jacarini
I would like to add to the description I wrote in 1970 that the female
may be distinguished from all other grassquits by the streakings on throat,
breast and flanks. Immatures are very similar to adult females but are
generally a little more olivaceous but young males show some black on the
wing coverts very early on. Once some black has begun to show, they
begin to sing.
They take to cage life easily and settle down almost immediately, but
an adult male in breeding condition takes a long while to come back into
song, although one male I caught was in full song again within 24 hours of
being placed in a cage. They were the first birds to enter any decoy trap,
indeed if they are in the vicinity it is difficult to catch other birds without
resort to a mist net. They will invariably gorge themselves on millet before
then attempting to find a way out.
Having now seen the bird in the wild on countless occasions, I can say
that the novelty of the display song-and-dance flight should not be denied
either the bird or the owner, and they should definitely be kept in an
open flight outdoors. I noted two successful breeding reports in 1975.

Sporophila lineola
These two birds both occur in Venezuela; they are migratory but seem
to have the most fascinating overlapping range. One is an off-season visitor
in the other's breeding range and vice versa. I believe lineola ranges and
breeds further south than bouvronides which is more northern. The only
significant difference between them physically is a white stripe along the
crown of lineola. De Schauensee seems to be of the opinion that they are
conspecific. The late Paul Schwarz carried out lengthy comparative studies
from hand-rearing both types to recording call notes, display songs, etc.
Then to the west of Venezuela appears another form, probably a true
species, the Black and White Seedeater S. luctuosa, which has no white on
the head, nor any white on the rump. But there are specimens in the field
which are intermediary between any two of the three, or all three!
The fully adult male has a white rump, not scalloped black as in
younger birds. The song is a typical Sporophila song, being a strung-out
series of very attractive warbles and whistles. It always begins the same
way with predictable phrasing but gradually develops until it ends with
loss of pattern and free improvisation. I kept several in all combinations
and collections. Males together bicker and occasionally scrap - when
breeding they will scrap fiercely. A pair will settle well but the male will
sing much less. Females settle less easily and tend to be more nervous.
They prefer the various millet seeds to any other, both dry and fresh.
They have never shown any interest in mealworms, softfood and virtually
none in fruit.

wild and traumatised. By March 1976 moulted into full first adult plu-
mage, flights moulted November 1976 - February 1977 and head moul-
ted again in March. Now in basic definitive plumage, black head richly
velvet. In full song. I can detect notes and phrases from the wild birds in
the garden and other birds in the bird room, including the Kiskadee! and
the Cowbird. It is now less adventurous with food but will still taste

anything offered. Loves mealworms, and will chew the skins dry.
I then found a female, a lone bird as part of a mixed shipment from
Holland. The pair settled very well. The male sang less often, and not
anywhere near as long rambling as before. In a large cage with other
\0x25A0birds he has become mildly aggressive to other seedeaters, but not
bullying. The female is very peaceable. They were placed in a large flight
cage alone, settled very happily with never a bicker. They loved lettuce,
but only sampled orange. Then in the early summer I was transferred to
Chicago.

There are several species of ruddy-breasted seedeaters, of which

ny South American period were S. hypoxantha, S. ruficollis, S. castanei-

think it is outside the scope of these notes to enter into a long debate

<bodyText confidence="0.9895129" page_id="58080154"  page_num="172" year="" vol="">
I bought a male in very poor condition from a boy at the side of the
road in the interior of Venezuela, November 1974. It took three months
for the bird to recover and gain fresh plumage, but it became a fine bird,
very steady and an excellent songster. However, it was very aggressive,
would chase away any bird twice its size and would complain vociferously
if another bird sat on the same perch. (The cage was about 5 ft cube) It
took all kinds of seed, fresh grass, apple and pear but did not like orange
or banana. It was an enthusiastic bather. I caught a female for him and
she settled well, her black bill looked large and out of proportion. I
released them once painted. Subsequently I caught a beautiful male in
immaculate condition and took it to paint and compare. It was still wild
and unsteady after two months, when I released it. About this time, while
netting humming birds for photography and identification, we caught a
pair of Slate-coloured Seedeaters S. schistacea, a species that would be
virtually indistinguishable unless the two were side by side. The white
throat patches are not consistently diagnostic as they do not appear in all
schistacea and may appear in intermedia. Side-by-side the Slate-coloured
Seedeater is larger, longer, and slimmer, but the key in any case is the bill,
and I trust that my sketch shows clearly the narrower upper mandible of
schistacea. It is not sufficiently clear in the illustration in my book.

Another very similar grey sporophila is the Plumbeous Finch S. plum-
bed. The race that I am familiar with is S.p. whitleyana. It is virtually
identical to the Grey Seedeater but has a brownish-horn bill, and whitish
chin and mesials . It replaces S. intermedia at higher elevations. In my ex-
perience it is a shy, solitary species. Males will select a high exposed branch
for a lookout post.

Whilst visiting Peru in 1978 and 1979 I saw many small finches in the
bird markets. Mostly they were either &amp; peruvianus or the Drab Seedeater
S. simplex. It is a slightly larger bird than the average Sporophila , being
drab olive-sandy all over. The bill and feet are horn-coloured in both sexes
and juveniles, but paler in juveniles. I saw plenty of these birds around
Lima and in September (the time of both visits), males were singing
on an upmost exposed branch every time, and chasing each other around
vigorously. They certainly ignored other seedeaters (I saw S. peruvianus
and S. telasco in the same areas) but I gained the impression they might be
quite bothersome in confinement.

West Indian Aratinga conures have never had a wide appeal in aviculture.
This is due in part to their largely all-green coloration and rarity in captivity.
Most are legally protected, the exception being Aratinga nana of Jamaica,
and A.p. pertinax on St. Thomas. The former is considered an agricultural
pest, and the latter is an introduced species brought to the island by early
Dutch seamen.
The largest and least known of these insular Aratingas is the Hispani-
olan A. chloroptera. A predominately green bird, it has a conspicuous
white periophthalmic ring and red under wing-coverts. These two features
are prominent even in flight, and could prove an ideal field identification.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999067880952381" page_id="58080156"  page_num="174" year="" vol="">
A. chloroptera occurs on Hispaniola and two off-lying islands, Beata
and Soana. It favours jungles, but also occurs in the lowlands. It is an
agricultural pest to pigeon peas('gandules', the vernacular in the Dominican
Republic) and guavas, also possibly corn. Preference for arboreal termitoria
as nesting cavities is shown, but if these are absent, hollow trees or palms
are used.
Aviculturally speaking, it is a rarity that has been bred in very few col-
lections in the Dominican Republic, Denmark and the USA. In the latter,
it was bred around 1936 by Vance Wright. Subsequently, hybrids were
reared at Lincoln Park Zoological Gardens, Chicago, Ill., and in my collec-
tion.
The single bird that is now in my possession was privately imported
around 1975. He resided at a zoological park in New Jersey until early
1981 when he arrived in my collection.
In behaviour there are affinities with the Noble Macaw Ara nobilis , but
his voice is much harsher and does not resemble that of any other insular
Aratinga.
When I acquired the bird, I hoped to obtain a mate for it so that a
breeding programme for this species could be started. This, however, was
easier said than done and up until now, none has been located. I would
very much like to hear from any American aviculturist who has this species.
Also, the bird is extremely aggressive and refused all mates until a
female Nanday Conure Aratinga nenday was offered. This bird had been a
friend's pet for many years, and had never been offered a mate. On intro-
duction, he immediately walked over to her and fed her. If there is such a .
thing as avian love at first sight, this is a supreme example.
While I do not favour hybridisation, the Nanday was offered out of
necessity; I wanted to know my bird's potential as a breeder and to learn
more about his reproductive behaviour.
After being together for exactly two months, the first of four eggs was
laid; three were fertile, one was clear. After 26 days of incubation, the first
chick hatched. It was totally covered in white down, very much resembling
a true Aratinga chloroptera. Two more chicks hatched, and were all removed
for hand-rearing so that notes on their development could be made.
The secondary down was very dark grey, different in this respect from
chloroptera chicks which have an almost white secondary down. Develop-
ment was similar to that of other Aratingas, except that growth was much
slower and that chicks were extremely aggressive. When the eldest chick
was four weeks old, it was severely injured on the bill and wing; this degree
of aggression has been noted in other conures, notably Aratinga jendaya.
After a fortnight the three chicks were reunited, and no further problems
were encountered.

At three months old the chicks differed slightly from the male parent
in coloration. The plumage is green, except for the breast feathers which
have a bluish cast, and the thighs which have red feathers, undoubtedly in-
herited from the hen bird. The eye-ring is like that of the male parent
* but is off-white.This has lightened and may continue to do so as the
young age. A conspicuous feature is the dark green crown, and reddish
coloured feathers that surround the lower mandible. Underwing coverts
show slight traces of orange, but this colour will probably intensify with
age. In true chloroptera young the underwing coverts take about a half-
year to reach the intensity of adults.
The mandible is large with grey streaking near the base. Feet and
tongue are dark grey.
The young are extremely attractive, much more so than the male parent
but with a considerably higher inflection to their voice. This makes them
almost unbearable and in this respect they are surpassed only by Golden
Conures Aratinga guarouba.
The pair went back to nest, and hatched three young from four eggs;
one was infertile. These three chicks are almost identical to the first,
differing only in the conspicuous red feathers on the bend of the wing and
underwing coverts.
If no hen chloroptera is found, one of the hybrid young will be paired
to its father.

Since this article was received, Mr. Silva has written to say that very
recently several chloroptera , which had been imported by a private avi-
culturist through legal means, were received. In addition, one of the
hybrid females laid last year, but all of the eggs were clear,almost certainly
due to her young age (under 12 months old).

We have received some interesting correspondence from Uwe Wagner in
Scharfstedt, Germany, which Stephen Lacey has very kindly translated.
Mr. Wagner is a keen ornithologist and his birdwatching expeditions have
given rise to some unconventional avicultural experiences.
In May 1982 he found a young Cuckoo at the base of a house wall,
surrounded by broken eggs. The only place it could have come from was a
Swallow's nest under the eaves, so he returned it and waited patiently.
Sure enough, the parent Swallows greeted it warmly and fed it at once,
and continued to care for us until it was fully fledged. Unfortunately, on
the day it embarked on its first flight, the young Cuckoo was surprised by
a neighbour's cat and collided with a stone pillar, breaking its wing in the
process. It had to be rescued, therefore, a second time. The wing was
repaired by Mr. Wagner and during its two-week convalenscence, the bird
was* fed on a diet of caterpillars, flies, mealworms, fruit and greenstuff.
When it was fit enough, it was released.
In the same month, he discovered two pheasant's eggs in a cornfield
which would have been destroyed by the farmer's tractor if they had been
left alone. Mr. Wagner collected them and took them home.
Coincidentally, he had a solitary female Buzzard which had just laid
some eggs in a nest in her aviary and Mr. Wagner decided that it would be
an interesting experiment to see if she would rear the pheasant chicks.
She hatched them alright but failed to entice them to feed on meat. For-
tunately there was alternative food available and the chicks did not starve.
Every evening the chicks sheltered under their foster mother who cared for
them as fastidiously as any natural mother. Eventually, they too were re-
leased into the wild - and so was the Buzzard. Mr. Wagner has sent several
colour photographs showing the chicks in the nest.

The overall population of Kirtland's Warbler Dendroica kirtlandii is
believed to be as low as 200 pairs. Nesting in a tiny region of northern
Michigan and wintering in the Bahamas, this tiny bird is causing problems
for the protectionists who are trying to increase its numbers. The bird
nests only in stands of Christmas-tree size jack pines, growing on dry,
sandy soil, with low ground cover. Under natural conditions, this habitat
is maintained only by forest fire and therefore occurs only in scattered
tracts. Although jack pines grow across the continent from Nova Scotia
to British Columbia, a combination of factors seem to be restricting popu-
lation growth. Experiments have shown that the bird will nest amongst
red pines so it may give preference to size and form. Ground cover is also
of importance as the tiny nest is embedded in the sand under low ground
cover. Under the Endangered Species Act, 135.000 acres of suitable
habitat are now protected, resulting in the population stabilising.

Field studies have revealed that Eucalyptus flowers, the main food
source for many lories and lorikeets, produce very little nectar, insuf-
ficient to cover the daily requirements of even the smallest member of
this family. However, the flowers of Eucalyptus produce large quantities
of pollen suggesting a constituent energy source. The tongues of most
lories and lorikeets are adapted for the collection of pollen without damag-
ing the delicate flower and several species, on dissection, have been found
to have their alimentary canal completely filled with pollen. Because of
these findings, Dr. Karl-L Schuchmann suggests, in an article in Trochilus
(1984) 5: 45-48 that pollen, instead of being mixed in with the nectar of
captive lories and lorikeets, should be offered dry in a separate container.
The same issue of Trochilus contains, amongst others, papers on the
Fiery-tailed Awlbill Avocettula recurvirostris and jSatis and Platysteira
flycatchers.

The Red or Hooded Siskin, endemic to Venezuela, is a highly endan-
gered species on the verge of extinction in the wild. The I.U.C.N. Red
Data Book lists this species with an unknown population, but states that
there has been a considerable and seemingly irreversible decline in recent
years.
One of the main reasons for this decline is the great demand in the cage
bird trade, as it hybridises willingly with domestic canaries, producing the
highly prized "red factor". Although protected in its homeland, illegal
collection still persists, thus threatening remaining populations further.
Following a letter in the Avicultural Magazine (1983, p. 120) by Mary
Goodwin and resultant correspondence between several aviculturists, it
has been decided to attempt an analysis of present captive populations to
commence on 1st January 1985. The aim is to assess not only numbers but
their success rate and to compile data on techniques adopted by avicul-
turists in the management of this endangered species.
We appreciate the work involved for keepers but to enable the project
to gather as much information as possible we are asking for details to be
provided under the headings listed below. Answers should be as complete
as possible, clearly defined under the separate headings, and forwarded to
the relevant collator listed at the end of this notice as soon after 1st January
as possible.

Quite a number of interesting guide books have been published recently
and readers may care to have some details:
Of these books, probably the most important is An Atlas of the Birds
of the Western Palaearctic by Colin Harrison, published by Collins (Lon-
don) (322 pages, price #12.95, ISBN 0 00 2197294). The area covered
stretches from the southernmost part of the Sahara as far north as Spitz-
bergen and Franz Josef Land, and from the Azores in the west as far east
as Afghanistan and Pakistan. There is a map for each of 639 species of
birds in the Western Palaearctic (Europe, North Africa and Middle East)
and the breeding ranges of a further 167 species from adjoining areas are
mapped to show patterns of distribution across Eurasia as a whole. This is
the first time that all such information has been made available in a single
volume.
The maps (excellently prepared by Crispin Fisher) indicate summer,
winter and resident distributions and, where relevant, periodic invasions or
irruptions and where a bird may occur on passage. The accompanying text
gives the bird's status, climatic range, typical habitats and nest sites. Whilst
this is essentially an atlas rather than a guide to the birds of the area, there
is a small line drawing of each species at the bottom of the page as an aide-
memoire. The extensive text amplifies the maps.
This is a very valuable guide, with interesting and stimulating text and
extremely good value.
Whilst in Europe, two new handbooks are welcome. The first is the
English edition of Birds of the Mediterranean and Alps by Lars Jonsson,
published by Croom Helm (160 pages, price #5.95. ISBN 0 7099 1413 X).
This volume is the last of a series of five on European birds by this well-
known ornithological artist. One hundred and seventy-two species are
described, each with a distribution map, and illustrated by the author in
most attractive watercolours showing the birds in characteristic postures
in their natural environment.
This will be a most useful, and very inexpensive field guide for visitors
to this area, particularly for holidaymakers.
The Birds of the Balearics by David A. Bannerman and W. Mary Ban-
nerman, is also published by Croom Helm (230 pages, price #29.50.
ISBN 0 7099 0679 X).
Despite the continuing attentions of resident and visiting birdwatchers,
no definitive handbook in English existed on the birdlife of the Balearic
Islands as a whole and the eminent ornithologist, Dr. David Bannerman,
started work on filling this considerable gap in the 1970s but failing eye-

sight caused him to cease work in 1978 when his wife, W. Mary Banner-
man, continued the writing. Sadly, Dr. Bannerman did not live to see the
finished work.
This is not a field guide, since only a few of the species included are
illustrated. These illustrations are contained in 12 attractive colour plates
(average six species to a plate) by Donald Watson and there are some
black and white illustrations and line drawings. The text, however, is
much more extensive, giving very ample coverage of each species - its
description, distribution, habitat, feeding habits, status, etc. Migrants are
included.
The book is a very valuable addition to the literature though its high j
price and few illustrations would perhaps not make it attractive to the
hundreds of thousands of holidaymakers to this area for whom the long-
established Field Guide to the Birds of Britain and Europe by Roger Tory
Peterson (Collins) would be more appropriate and helpful.
Les Oiseaux de Chine, de Mongolie et de Coree (The Birds of China,
Mongolia and Korea) - Passerines, by R.D. Etchecopar and F. Hue, pub-
lished by N. Boubee, Paris (704 pages, price 520 francs, ISBN 2 - 85004-
037-1) follows its companion volume on the non-passerine birds of this
area, and completes the series by these two distinguished authors on The
Birds of the Near and Far East (1970) and The Birds of North Africa
(1964).
This is a monumental work covering almost 650 species. Nearly all of
the 350 species that are resident in the area covered have a distribution
map and are illustrated in 22 colour plates by Patrick Suiro and Gilbert
Amani, or in line drawings. The accompanying text describes each species
with points for identification, behaviour, breeding and local and world-
wide distribution. There is an index of latin names, vernacular names (in
French and English) as well as a useful bibliography.
With an elementary grasp of French the text is not too difficult to
follow and the comprehensiveness of this work makes it an important
addition to any ornithological library.
The Birds of Zimbabwe by Michael P. Stuart Irwin, published by
Quest Publishing Ltd., P.O. Box 567, Harare, Zimbabwe (464 pages,
price 9 Zimbabwe dollars, paperback, ISBN 0 86925 156 2) is a very
comprehensive and authoritative work on the birdlife of Zimbabwe. The
author was Curator of Ornithology and now Regional Director of the
National Museum in Bulawayo and he has drawn extensively on his many
years ol museum work and field experience in Zimbabwe and neighbour-
ing territories. This is a handbook rather than a field guide and the
author s stated aim has been to set out all that is known about the distri-
bution, habitat, migration or seasonal movements and ecology of each of

the 635 species occurring in Zimbabwe.
The value of this book is much increased by the 25 superb colour
plates by Peter Fogarty which are so far above the standard usual in hand-
books and guides produced today. They are much more than just illustra-
tions, being complete pictures reminiscent of the work of the late D.M.
Henry, and are quite remarkable for their clarity, liveliness and perfect
composition.
Another book from Africa is Birds of the South-Western Cape by Joy
Frandsen, published by Sable Publishers, P.O. Box 98014, Sloane Park,
2152, Republic of South Africa (237 pages, price 27.60 Rands plus
2.0 Rands for postage, ISBN 0 620062606).
Whilst this book has been written mainly for birdwatchers in that
area of South Africa, it is of general interest because of the outstanding
quality of the photographs which have been chosen from the collections
of many South African photographers. Two hundred and sixty-two
species are described, each accompanied by a really excellent colour
photograph and these are more than adequate for identification pur-
poses, showing all the essential characteristics that differentiate similar
species. The reproduction is also of a very high standard.
The Carnegie Museum of Natural History, 4400 Forbes Avenue, Pitts-
burgh, Pennsylvania 15213, USA, publishes interesting regional fauna
guides and a complete list may be obtained from the Publications Sec-
retary. A recent example is West Virginia Birds - Distribution and Ecology ,
by George Hall (Special Publication NO. 7, 190 pages, price 20.00 U.S.
dollars, plus 2.50 dollars postage. ISBN 0 935868 05 4). This is a very
interesting and excellently produced book which sets out the status of
the birdlife generally in this state as well as of the individual species
resident. There is a very comprehensive and valuable bibliography.
The Birds of the Ligonier Valley by Robert C. Leberman is Carnegie
Museum of Natural History's Special Publication No. 3 (67 pages, price
5.00 US dollars, plus 1.00 dollar postage) and is a very attractively pro-
duced survey of the present status of the birds living in this valley in
south-western Pennsylvania. It is illustrated by watercolour plates painted
by H. Jon Janisk and line drawings by Carol H. Rudy.
Finally, The Handbook of the Birds of India and Pakistan by Salim Ali
and S. Dillon Ripley is being republished by Oxford University Press, the
latest of the ten volumes to appear being No. 3: Stone Curlews to Owls
(327 pages, price #17.00, ISBN 195613023). Additional forms have been
added to the original 1969 production of this standard work, together
with four new colour plates by F.P. Bennett Jr.

RSPB NATURE RESERVES. Edited by Nicholas Hammond. Croom Helm

<bodyText confidence="0.997259482758621" page_id="58080168"  page_num="186" year="" vol="">
Ltd. Beckenham, 1984. 184 pages; 20 colour photographs; six colour
illustrations; three black and white photographs; numerous line drawings
and 11 maps. Price #9.95.
Practically every country in the world now has its share of areas that
are protected for the benefit of wildlife, be they reserves or national parks.
The acquisition, management and problems associated with such areas are
rarely explained to the amateur naturalist so it is a more than welcome
change to be given an insight into nature protection, in this instance, the
reserves that come under the wing of the Royal Society for the Protection
of Birds, Britain's premier bird protection organisation.
The contents start with a brief introduction followed by sections on
how the R.S.P.B. acquires reserves; managing reserves the R.S.P.B. way;
seabird cliffs; terns on R.S.P.B. reserves; estuaries and salt-marsh; reed-
swamps; lagoons and open water; floodmeadows; upland oak woods,
highland birchwood; lowland deciduous woodland; lowland heathland;
native pinewood; moorland in Scotland and Wales; Orkney moorland; and
a gazetteer of reserves. Two appendices cover habitats for birds in the U.K.
and reserves acquired in 1983.
The gazetteer lists alphabetically nearly 80 of the Society's more not-
able reserves, giving national grid references, directions, brief introduction,
composition of habitat, management techniques and an insight into
recorded wildlife; preference obviously is given to birds but plants, spiders,
mammals, reptiles, amphibians and insects are also touched upon where
studied.
Although the book holds little for the aviculturist, many of us have
more than just a passing interest in wild birds and as such, this is an excel-
lent and informative guide for those wishing to visit ideal areas to see our
native species in their natural environment.

Some 67 members spent a most enjoyable afternoon on 1st September
1984 at Chestnut Lodge, Cobham, Surrey, as guests of Miss Ruth Ezra and

admired the magnificent display of roses as well as the many unusual and
attractive shrubs, trees and plants, tropical as well as hardy. The highlight

was the tour of the aviaries, a delight for everyone. Beautiful landscaping,
combined with the very practical arrangement of the aviaries, designed for
the best benefit of the birds as well as their keepers, amply testified to
Raymond Sawyer's renowned taste and knowledge. This is now generally
acknowledged worldwide to be one of the great private collections. The
birds were all in fine condition, many having bred this year, and there was
much of interest to see.
Violaceous Plantain-Eaters, or Touracos, have been bred at Chestnut
Lodge this year and reared by their parents, believed to be for the first
time in Great Britain. Scissor-billed Starlings were also bred but unfortu-
nately survived for only a few days after leaving the nest (this species is
not believed to have been bred in Britain before). Black-winged Stilts
have again bred for several years running - their first breeding at Chestnut
Lodge is also believed to be a 'first'. Ringed Plovers have bred in the
Waders' Aviary, where there were also several families of Avocets, and
White-breasted Rails with babies could be seen. Also in this aviary was an
attractive group of South American Jacanas, and the White-throated Bee-
eater and Golden-winged Sunbird, both of which Raymond has kept
since 1972 - this bee-eater must surely be the only bird of its species in this
country? Members were delighted to see the Superb Sunbirds and also
the Buff-throated Sunbird which Raymond is sure has not been seen in
Britain since the 1950s, and a magnificent pair of Toco Toucans on which
are pinned high hopes. In the tropical house could be seen a Moho or
Oriole Warbler from West Africa, and some very handsome Malayan
Black-crested Jays aroused much admiration. Other breeding successes
this year include a Satyr Tragopan, Palawan Peacock Pheasant, Green
Junglefowl, Tufted Guineafowl, Congo Peafowl, four Keas and a Stella
or Papuan Lory (probably not bred in this country since the last century).
Also on the lake in front of the house was a delightful family of six
young Pacific Brent Geese with their parents.
Throughout their tour, members were accompanied by a very tame
Common Trumpeter and a young Stanley's Crane, bred at Chestnut Lodge
this year, whilst Vulturine Guineafowl, Demoiselle Cranes, and Grey-
necked Cranes (some full-winged) strolled about the lawns in front of the
house.
After all these, and many more delightful sights, members were ready
to appreciate the magnificent tea at which Miss Ezra was a very gracious
hostess. Members sat on in the garden for a long time, renewing old
friendships, and altogether it was a most pleasant and memorable occasion.
We are particularly grateful to Miss Ezra and Mr. Raymond Sawyer for all
their hospitality and generosity in donating the entire proceeds of the
ticket money (some #144, including donations) ) to the Society's Lunds.
Our sincere thanks for all their loyal support over many years.

First Breeding Medals
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992583733333333" page_id="58080170"  page_num="188" year="" vol="">
Is it not time that the Avicultural Society abandoned the practice of
awarding a medal for first breeding? In many cases, these first breedings
reflect chance rather than objectivity and are, in any event, of limited
value to either aviculture or the Avicultural Society.
Since our Society has a considerable and desirable international mem-
bership, would it not be better to establish a policy of honouring those
who have made a contribution towards avicultural advance and that these
awards should reflect our debt to people in other countries as well the
British aviculturist?
It might well be that under a new scheme, recipients would also be
some of the first-breeding Medal holders but I would suggest an award
reflecting avicultural merit, honoured by our august Society, would have
more value than the present system. This seems to me to require the
element of good fortune and, after so many years, a cynical look at what
is left to be bred for the first time!

The Lemon-breasted Canary

remember them are as follows:-
In the 1950s Mr. Scheepers was trapping in Mozambique. This was his
livelihood and it can thus be assumed that he was exporting birds to Bri-
tain, U.S.A. and Europe. Either in 1958 or 1959 Mr. W. Collard (past
Chairman of the Natal Avicultural Society and Director of the Natal Zoo-
logical Gardens) and one or two members of the N.A.S. paid a visit to
Mr. Scheepers and stayed for a few days with him. Whilst looking through
the holding or stock aviaries, Mr. Collard noticed this unusual-looking bird,
and mentioning this to Mr. Scheepers, was told it was a rather funny-look-
ing Peach Canary (our local term for the South African Grey Singing Finch).
Over the next few days, Mr. Collard and his companion/s visited the
native market in Lourenco Marques and there, to Mr. Collard's amazement,
was a cage which contained another three of the same species. Although
Mr. Collard tried to buy them, the African owner would not sell. Later,

however, Mr. Collard asked Mr. Scheepers if he could buy the one he had,
and hoped that he would be able to persuade the market stall owner to
part with a mate. Mr. Scheepers then gave the bird to Mr. Collard who
luckily managed to obtain a mate from the market.
Unfortunately the birds did not live long in South Africa and their
bodies were entrusted to Mr. Monty Baddeley of the Durban Museum.
These were kept in the refrigerator until Dr. Clancy returned from leave.
When he saw the birds, his first reaction was that they were hybrids but
after due thought and consideration, Dr. Clancy and Mr. Lawson set out to
collect specimens and succeeded in doing so in 1960.
The puzzling part about this Lemon-breasted Canary saga, which is
well-known in local avicultural circles, is if Mr. Scheepers trapped about
40 examples in 1959, as stated in Mr. BrickelTs article, where did they go
to? Surely if they had been exported, one of the dealers concerned would
have drawn someone's attention to them? There surely could not be 40
'funny-looking Peach Canaries' or 'hybrids'!
It would be most interesting to find out just who should be credited
with the initial discovery of this species - perhaps some of the readers
would care to give their views.
Thank you for a magnificent magazine.

released from quarantine in December 1981, despite their high cost and a
previous warning from a bird breeder in Germany that they were "impos-
sible to keep alive in aviaries for long". I hoped that the climate and alti-
tude of Johannesburg might suit them, as they come from the Andes
Mountains, between 6,000 and 16,000 ft, of Peru, Bolivia, Chile and
Argentina. They were strikingly beautiful, the male being velvety black
with golden wing bar and patch under the tail. The hen was readily dis-
tinguishable by being greyish black with lemon yellow wing bars and tail
patch. They had an attractive hovering type of flight in which the yellow
under the wings became visible, and they were reminiscent of some huge,

exotic butterfly. They are far larger than the more commonly kept Siskins
being more the size of a Greenfinch but with small, sharp beaks.
I attempted to acclimatise my pair in a spacious 6ft cage in a birdroom
in which I breed Red Siskins. Here the use of a heater thermostatically
controlled, and a humidifier is available. Black Siskins, however, have the
same dense type of feathering as most European birds and seem adapted
to withstand low temperatures.
The main problem with them manifested itself at once, viz. an extreme
reluctance to eat anything and great shyness even about taking water. I
had hoped that niger seed and maw seed, on which Red Siskins subsist,
would be an easy answer, but they would not touch either. I supplied
every type of seed and at every level, even fixing little dishes among the
branches supplied for perching, and finally covering the whole floor with a
thick layer of mixed seeds, a procedure that works with some newly-caught
difficult species like the Green Twinspot. I tried every kind of softfood
and greenfood I could think of, but not even ripening millet sprays grown
in my garden or bunches of chickweed laden with ripening seedpods would
tempt them.
In desperation I searched through my avicultural literature but, apart
from Robin Restall's accurate description in Finches and other seed-eating
Birds , I could find only one avicultural account written by T.F.M. William-
son in Bird Notes of April 1919. He had written about his pair in a mixed
collection in his Californian aviary. His Black Siskins "fed entirely on
ordinary rape seed, and though they ate sparingly of lettuce. they
never touched any grass or other wild seeds." Rape was the one seed that
I had not tried, as Iliad given it no chance among such luxuries as gold-of-
pleasure, teazle and an excellent wild grass seed mixture. I rushed out and
bought both black and red rape, in the hope that the problem was solved.
This was the first seed in which my Black Siskins showed any interest,
but mine merely picked up the seeds and rolled them around in their beaks
for some time before dropping them to the floor again. I gave all seeds
dry and soaked and in various stages of germination, but nothing availed.
The male only lived for 20 days and the female for 26 days. Presumably
they took a little water when I was not looking and at long intervals they
swallowed a few grains of the smallest yellow millet. The manner in which
they fed was erratic. They would appear puffed up and about to die, then
presumably they swallowed a little seed and they would be better for a
day or so. In the end they lost interest altogether and I force-fed them
with a syringe. This feeding seemed to totally disagree with them and from
this point on, I realised that the whole distressing battle was lost.
Mr. Bill Steel bought a pair on the same day as I did and we compared
notes. His were housed in an aviary with an indoor shelter and outdoor

flight The hen starved to death within 10 days, but the cock took to
plain canary seed and was fond of lettuce. It liked to go out into the
flight and sing in the sun. We thought that this bird, having settled down,
might live to a good age, but within three months it was unexpectedly
found dead one morning.
This species was mentioned in one advertisement in England at that
time, so presumably a small number of them were on the market in
Europe. It would be very good to hear from any fancier who fared better
with this difficult species. The other pairs in South Africa sold quickly
and I do not know what became of them. The silence about them would
indicate that they, too, quickly perished.
Aviculture is not only about success stories, and these should not be
the only stories reported in our magazines. There is as much, or more, to
be learnt from failures. If I had my chance over again I would try the
Black Siskins in an outside aviary with much natural cover in which they
could retreat. This might give them a greater degree of confidence and
stimulate them into eating a satisfactory diet. Or they might be a species
that is stimulated by the flock, because the batch imported seemed to
survive the three-week quarantine period in comparatively unattractive
surroundings with relative ease.

(1919-1977)
Many members will remember the artist David Reid-Henry who was an
active member of the Society and wrote many articles for the Avicultural
Magazine , as well as contributing 37 superb colour plates which appeared
in the Magazine between 1951 and 1971.
His widow, Louise Reid-Henry, is preparing a catalogue of all his works
and will be pleased to hear from any members who have his paintings or
who know the location of any. Strict anonymity will be preserved but
Mrs. Reid Henry would be very grateful to have a description of each
painting, its size and medium. (He signed his works 'D.M. Henry', in block
capitals).
A number of publications are being planned on the work of this
important artist and a list of his works, as complete as possible, will be of
great assistance to these projects.
If anyone can help, please write to Mrs. Reid Henry, c/o the Editor.

BREEDING THE FIRE-TUFTED BARBET
Psilopogon pyrolophus
AT CHESTER ZOO

residents of the montane rain forest in Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula.
The mainly green plumage is enlivened by the strikingly marked head
and chest, the double yellow and black breast-band being most distinc-
tive. The sexes are similar but the male differs in having maroon mixed
with the black of the hind-crown.
On the 27th April 1984 Chester Zoo obtained a pair of these Barbets
from a supplier in England and they were housed in one of the indoor
aviaries within the Tropical House. This aviary measures 7.0m x 2.6m
x 4.0m high and is planted with a selection of tropical plants including
Hibiscus, Asparagus plumosa and Calathea pulchella. No aggression was
shown between the Barbets and the Red-billed Hornbill Tockus erythro-
rhynchus and Sun Bittern Europygahelias which shared the same enclo-
sure.
The Barbets quickly settled in their new aviary and were fed our
standard large softbill mixture of minced beef, commercial insectile
food, grated boiled egg, carrot and chopped apple, supplemented with
. Fresh fruit (pears, melons, grapes, plums, bananas, etc.) was
I provided as in season.
On 8th May it was noticed that the Barbets had already chiselled
Dut several holes in the upright old tree-trunks which had originally
ieen provided for the White Woodpeckers Leuconerpes candidus that
lad previously occupied this aviary. By 15th May the Barbets had
{elected one particular hole (in a log close to the adjacent aviary, now
lousing the Woodpeckers) and were spending long periods within that
lole.

R. WILKINSON &amp; W. McLEOD - FIRE-TUFTED BARBET
Two more Fire-tufted Barbets were purchased on 17th May. Lacking
the maroon hind-crown, these two presumed females (or immatures) were
housed in a different aviary within the Tropical House. Although out of
sight of the original pair, vocal contact was quickly established with fre-
quent exchanges of lengthy churring call notes.
Over the next month, when it seemed likely that our original pair
had indeed laid in the favoured nest-hole, the Barbets were disturbed as
little as possible. On 5th June calls from the nest-log indicated that at
least one chick had hatched. We immediately provided mealworms (dusted
in Vionate) which the parents readily accepted to feed to their chicks.
From one to three mealworms were carried per nest visit. The parents
normally ran these through their mandibles several times before feeding
them to the young. To ensure that the Barbets received adequate amounts
of live food, the Sun Bittern and Red-billed Hornbill were transferred to
the adjacent aviary housing the Woodpeckers. We then started feeding
locusts in addition to the mealworms; these were accepted as suitable
rearing food by the parents although mealworms still appeared to be the
favourite food item. Both sexes fed the young. Initially one bird would
remain in the nesting hole until the second arrived with food, but later in
the nestling period both parents spent increasingly longer periods outside
the nest. Observations on 11th June suggested that the male was taking the
larger part of the burden of feeding the young. Pink mice, and later pink
rats, became the major food items over the next few weeks; these were
treated as the mealworms, being dutifully mandibulated before being
carried to the nest.
Disaster struck on 26th June when the male Barbet was found dead on
the floor of the aviary. Despite food being always available to these birds,
the post mortem examination revealed an empty gut. Why the bird had
failed to feed was not revealed. We spent an anxious few hours waiting and
watching to check whether the female would continue to feed the nestlings
in the absence of the male. The female did continue to feed the nestlings
but each time she flew to the nest-hole, the Red-billed Hornbill in the adja-
cent aviary flew at her through the wire. Relocation of the Hornbill
removed this stressful situation and on 3rd July we were rewarded with
the sight of a young Barbet peering out of the nest-hole.
Over a week elapsed before the first chick fledged on 11th July, six
weeks after the first chick calls were heard, and a second youngster
fledged on 14th July. The fledglings differed from the adults in being
slightly smaller and were paler in colour. Those parts that are green in
the adults were of a bluer shade, and the yellow parts were whiter in the
young. The fledglings also differed in having whitish rather than crimson
tipped facial bristles. Pinkish-orange orbital rings were pronounced when
</bodyText>

they first left the nest but faded over the next few weeks. By 19th July
the youngsters were feeding themselves. Interestingly, they then rejected
the pink mice and rats on which they were reared in favour of fresh fruit,
the favoured items being apple, grapes, pear and banana.

BREEDING THE GREEN-CHEEKED AMAZON PARROT
Amazona virdigenalis
AT THE ORNITHOLOGICAL INSTITUTE, OBERHAUSEN,
GERMANY

In the summer of 1982 the Ornithological Institute, Oberhausen, was
successful in breeding Green-cheeked Amazon Parrots Amazona viridi-
genalis. Until now this Amazon has been bred rarely in captivity. After a
few successes in South Africa (Boswell Collection, 1976), England
(J. Stoodley, Peterborough, 1979) and Switzerland (Mattmann, 1981),
this is the first recorded breeding in West Germany.
In the aviaries of our Institute there lives a pair of this species which
was imported in 1977 from north-eastern Mexico. The birds were placed
in an outdoor aviary, measuring 2.0 x 2.0 x 1.0m ( 6 V 2 x 6 V 2 x 3 V 2 ft). The
shelter measured 2.0 x 1.0 x 1.0m ( 6 V 2 x 3Vz x 314 ft). Their diet consisted
of a seed mixture containing sunflower seed, peanut kernels, peanuts in
shell, pine nuts, hard maize, oats and wheat. They also had fruit, vege-
tables and dried shrimps. Very milky maize and protein food was a fav-

Green-cheeked Amazon Parrot at 11 weeks old
ourite diet for the young birds after leaving the nest-box.
In spring 1981 the parrots were given a nest-box, which was fixed in
the shelter, protected from exposure to rain and direct sunlight. Nesting
material consisting of rotten wood was placed in the base to a depth of
about 10 cm (4 in).
After a short time the birds showed great interest in the nest-box,
followed by elements of social behaviour, culminating in copulation. In
the middle of May three eggs were laid, of an average size of 26.2 x 35.2
mm, and they resembled eggs of adult Pionus parrots (see Lantermann,
1983a).
After an incubation period of 28 days, one of the chicks hatched and
developed well for 10 days but died during a thunderstorm one night, as a
result of the stress of the adult birds. That year no second clutch was laid.
The parrots began moulting in the middle of July.
Already by March 1982 new pairing activities could be observed, es-
pecially courtship feeding and social preening. These two elements play an
important role in the social behaviour of highly developed neotropical
parrots and introduce copulation which took place several times a day.
The first egg was discovered in the nesting cavity on 15th April, followed
by a second egg on 18th April. The female started brooding on 16 th April
and the male also seemed to share this activity. The adult birds only left
the nest-box to feed and defecate (see Lantermann, 1984a).
Two chicks hatched after an incubation period of 28 days. At first the

begging sounds of the young parrots could be heard several times a day,
but in later weeks they became more and more quiet.
The development of the young birds took about nine weeks. The eyes
opened in the fourth week and the first feathers appeared at the beginning
of the fifth week. Eight weeks after hatching they were nearly fully
fledged and sometimes peeped out of their nest-box hole.
Both chicks left the nest at the end of the ninth week. Because of the
few nest inspections no exact information about the development of the
young parrots can be given here. Both young birds resembled the adult
Amazons, but only the forehead and the lores were red; the tail was
shorter, the band that runs from above the eyes down the sides of the neck
which is violet-blue in adults was pale blue in the immatures; the iris was
greenish-grey.

In the coming years the colouring process of the plumage will be
studied and compared with related species, also bred in our aviaries. Fur-
thermore, the colour variation of the iris from hatching to sexual maturity
seems to be helpful in determining the age of imported birds, especially
 |the Amazon parrots (see Lantermann, 1982, 1983b).
We would like to integrate the young birds into a larger group of Green-
cheeked Amazons to obtain more detailed information on the social beha-
viour of this species. In co-operation with German zoos and birdparks, we
hope to be able to repeat this success with other, newly-formed pairs, to
see this species, which is apparently becoming endangered in the wild
(Ridgely, 1980) become established in captivity (Lantermann, 1984b).

spent months in shipment with waxbills and munias. It must have reached
Venezuela from Argentina via Holland. A year later it finally recovered its
health and plumage and was identifiable as a male Band-tailed Seedeater

phila by its chestnut under-tail coverts, which are diagnostic of the Cata-
menia finches. I have not seen the female but according to de Schauensee,
she is reddish brown broadly streaked with black above, fulvous below,
streaked with dark brown. Both sexes have a white band across the under
surface of the tail.
My diary notes this: it takes small seeds but clearly prefers millet over
all. It is not at all adventurous with food and rarely does more than taste
fruits or greenstuff. The male sings sweetly, a continuous gurgling squeaky
burble that goes on and one. It is not in the least aggressive, in fact, rather
timid. On one occasion when I had a great shortage of space, I put a tiny
ground dove in its cage. It quickly retired to a corner and cheeped plain-
tively, apparently in fear, as if calling for help. It was very happy when in a
cage all by itself. It appears never to bathe.

Another species of Catamenia I saw, but never caught was the Plain-
coloured. There is an excellent plate of it in Phelps and de Schauensee and
it appears to be very similar indeed to the Band-tailed. The female appar-
ently is like the female Band-tailed but without any streaking on the under-
parts. I saw this bird high up in the Andes above the tree line in the Para-
mos. It kept very much to cover when we were in evidence but when out
of danger, it would sit on an exposed stem and watch us.

I must admit to having difficulty with this genus. In my book I dis-
cussed the inadequacy of mentions in the literature, and the difficulty
anybody would have in identifying a bird accurately. I sketched the head
and upper wing of eleven species, adult males, with the intention of provi-
ding a diagnostic reference. I made this chart at the Bird Room of the
Natural History Museum in Tring, and used colour in the original. The
printer, however, having promised a dozen colour plates when the book
was commissioned, cut me down to one, and the serins took priority over
the Warbling Finches.
Imagine my chagrin when, a few years later, in Venezuela, I obtained
a "pair" of unidentified birds from an importation from Holland, and
found my black and white sketches inadequate. They were eventually
identified as the Pretty Warbling Finch, an adult male of which I had kept
some years earlier. Again, very recently in Tokyo I obtained an adult male
of this species and was able to compare it to the colour sketches of my
pair in Venezuela which consisted of an immature male and a female.
My notes in Venezuela show that the outer tail feathers of the male

were all white while those of the female were dark brown at the base. The
male I have now follows. A single adult male in the Field Museum in Chi-
cago had much broader cream wing bars than either of my males (which
have white bars). In the female there is white on the lesser wing coverts.
They are easy birds to keep as they are quiet and in ordinately peace-
ful, being excellent company for waxbills. However, from a dietary view-
point they would be much better kept with tanagers. They love ripe green
food, and all live food, and will take soft food.

SLATY FINCH Haplospiza rustica
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9803181875" page_id="58080190"  page_num="200" year="" vol="">
Formerly listed as Spodiomis rusticus by de Schauensee, this is a rare
and difficult bird to find, but it does have a wide range and could find its
way on to the market. The bird I caught and examined was about 5 in
long and was a uniform slaty grey all over. The bill was coral and the legs
orange - not in accordance with de Schauensee, but as I also caught the
Plumbeous Sierra Finch for comparison, albeit in a different location, I
came to this conclusion. As the plumage was faintly striated, I thought it
must be an immature.
I did not keep this bird at the time, regrettably, for I can offer no
comment on it in confinement. However, in the wild it appears to be a
very secretive bird, keeping well hidden or hopping about the ground
among the frailejons (we were in the paramos, above the tree line), and it
seemed to be extremely shy. It could be that such behaviour is a function
of living in such a habitat, and in a suitable aviary the bird would show
more of itself. I doubt it.

Those interested in South and Central American birds will no doubt
lave a copy of The Guide to the Birds of Venezuela (de Schauensee and
Phelps) with its excellent illustrations by Guy Tudor and others. There is a
fine plate by Wayne Trimm showing the brush-finches of Venezuela. Finch
and tanager enthusiasts must be intrigued by this little-known genus.
Before arriving in Venezuela I had not even heard of brush finches, let
alone knew what they were. Soon after arriving in Caracas, however, I was
invited to the home of some keen ornithologists who lived further up the
hills (about 5,000 ft, Caracas being about 3,000 ft). While sitting on the
porch watching the birds come to feed and drink, I was electrified by the
appearance of a tanager-sized bird, all orange on head and breast, yellow
belly, and olive green above. It gulped at the papaya/ and banana for a few
mintues, then disappeared. It was my first sight of the Ochre-breasted
Brush Finch and I became quite obsessed with the genus from then on.
These are invariably birds of dense underbrush of rainforest hillside.

Occasionally a local bird has become accustomed to the feeding station of
somebody's garden, and will come to feed in open view generally; however
r they are skulking, retiring and very shy of humans. It is extremely difficult
to observe them in the wild, and the only times I have ever done so have
been when I have been sitting still for a long period just waiting for some-
thing to come along. The sign is the kicking or tossing of leaves as a soli-
tary bird comes foraging over the ground through the undergrowth. They
are said to feed on small invertebrates but mine ate a great deal of every-
thing - including a lot of seed.

I caught and banded many dozens of these birds in the Cordillera north
of Caracas and thus enabled much more accurate observations of territory
and behaviour. De Schauensee lists four races, one of which has a white
chin, but I only ever saw the northern (coastal area) race. The sexes are
alike but I found the male to be easy to detect in the field by his habit of
erecting the crown feathers frequently (there is no crest), and in the hand
by anal tuft comparison - the male has long yellow "guide" feathers. With
matched pairs the male is also almost 10% larger ( 6 V 2 in). Juveniles are
much duller olive with olive heads and yellowish bib and mesial. The
orange of the head comes through very soon.
I kept several individuals for painting, both young and adult. They
settled easily in large roomy cages and fed happily on mixed seeds, a little
banana, apple and orange. They liked mealworms but I gave only a few
each day. They stayed in excellent condition. They never showed any
sign of aggression, nor did I ever hear them make a noise. I noticed that in
the wild, young birds accompany their parents on foraging parties and I
never noticed any sign of aggression then. This is the only brush finch that
I have seen in groups, however small, and the only one that would forage
above ground level, being occasionally seen in bushes and shrubs 10 ft
above ground level. It would be an undeniably fine aviary bird.

About 7 in also, a big finch with the head striped grey and black, white
throat, black pectoral band, olive above and dingy below. The sexes are
alike. I have never been able to observe this bird in the wild, but one day a
friend called at the office to say that a Stripe-crowned Brush-Finch had
flown into his bedroom window pane, stunned itself, and he feared serious
injury. I duly collected the bird and took it home. I kept it for a few
months in a large cage with other local birds, finches and tanagers, before
painting and releasing it.
It settled very well and was always peaceful with no sign of aggressive-
ness. I found that it ate almost nothing but seeds. Subsequently I learned
that the sexes are alike, while immature birds are virtually uniform sage
green all over.
Skutch devotes a whole chapter of observations on this species. He des-
cribes the song as thin, high-pitched and squeaky, and very short being
easy to overlook. He was also of the opinion that it fed on small insects
and dead leaves. Insects they undoubtedly take, but I am equally certain
that small seeds are a basic diet ingredient.

When Herbert Murray read my notes on this species, he wrote to me
saying that they were very dull in their behaviour, ".the dullest birds I
ever had or have ever seen. They seemed to eat a bit of everything." Ap-
parently his pair led totally uneventful lives and ".died after a couple of
years, unlamented." Herbert Murray was a great aviculturist and we were
good friends. I sent him birds from Spain, including the Spanish Sparrow,
which he successfully bred. His experience with tanagers was equal, or
greater than that of Mr. N. Oregaard-Olesen, and during my time in Vene-
zuela we exchanged a lot of correspondence on tanagers. If Herbert found
Greyish Saltators dull, I believe him.
I caught an adult in my Caracas garden and caged it with some other
thrush-sized birds, including tanagers. It settled immediately, and very
well. It took a lot of fruit but, as I did not keep it alone, I cannot say for
sure how much softfood or seeds it took. At the bird table in the gardens
they took a lot of banana and orange. I have watched them in many loca-
tions in the wild but have only seen them take leaves, biting bits out, and
buds.
They are shy and somewhat skulking birds, keeping to cover. The song

of the male is the most distinctive and easy to recognise in the clamour of
a dawn chorus, and the male will sing from on high on and off throughout
the day. Its determination and clarity, however, far outweigh its musical
ability. I would put it slightly behind the European Missel Thrush in this
respect. Incidentally, male and female will "duet", singing antiphonally.

<bodyText confidence="0.998920722222222" page_id="58080193"  page_num="203" year="" vol="">
During my three years in Venezuela I managed a complex 13-month
study of the natural history of a large ranch in the interior. Among the
many hundreds of birds caught were many Streaked Saltators, and I became
very familiar with the species. I decided to keep an adult male for a while.
First I must point out that the Venezuelan race is a richer-coloured bird
than those in Central America or the Caribbean Islands. Its plumage is a
rich glistening, olivaceous green above, not the "dull olive green as des-
cribed in my book. Also, the eyebrow is yellow, not white as illustrated by
ffrench. Finally, the cutting edges of the bill are rich yellow as is the gape.
My bird was placed in a large cage with a Kiskadee. This was a mistake
as the Kiskadee bullied the Saltator and kept it away from the food. I took
the Saltator away in a very thin and half-starved condition. It refused to
eat and I had to force-feed it with mealworms for a day or two. I also
dropped Vionate in its bill, and mixed glucose in the water. It recovered to
settle down on a mixed diet of fruit, softfood and mealworms.
To begin with, I offered different dishes with various seeds, banana,
papaya, apple, pear and orange. The softfood was a locally-manufactured
dry mix that I combined with honey and grated cheese. At first the Salta-

tor ate only orange, and this fruit remained its outright preferred food
until its eventual release. At the end it was eating orange, mealworms (10
a day), softfood and a little millet. From my observations of the bird in
the wild, it seems to eat buds and leaves, but mainly buds.

I have not kept this bird but I observed it several times in Venezuela. It
was found in the upper reaches of large, open trees in open areas between
dense woods. I never saw it low down nor in thick cover. A pair would
carefully comb the branches, bark and leaves, picking at unidentifiable
things, presumably insects of different kinds, small beetles, etc., and also
taking birds and tender bits of vegetation.
I came across a dead one on the highway, still in good enough condition
to paint. It has a strong bill like all saltators, and presumably is fairly om-
nivorous. It is essentially grey above, darkest on the crown. There is a
strong white superciliary, and a white spot at the base of the bill. The
throat is also white but the rest of the head is black. The sexes are alike.

My description of this bird was taken from a comparison of skins in
the British Museum. When I finally collected it live in Venezuela, I found
it to be a little different from my expectation. In many ways it is inter-
mediate between the Virginian Cardinal and the Pyrrhuloxia spp. .Also, in
the birds that I saw, the male has no black on the face at all. My pair were
both longer and slimmer than the Virginian Cardinals I saw in Chicago.

Herbert Murray told me that he had kept it for a number of years and
\0x25A0: id
in his opinion it was the finest cardinal of them all. He found the beak to
be amazing and commented on the bulging muscles connected to it. Like
me, Mr. Murray found the female to be a very attractive bird in its own
right. His birds came from Colombia, according to his shipper and "...they
came from semi-desert country". The bird in Venezuela is also found in
semi-desert.
I have watched this species in aviaries in the Caracas Zoo and these
observations agree with my own experience, and that of Herbert Murray,
that it is a peaceful bird and safe in mixed company. Mine took mango,
orange, apple, pear and papaya freely, but only took a little banana. They
also took softfood and mixed seeds. They really had a fondness for sun-
flower and my notes suggest that this seed accounted for about 50% by
bulk of the food eaten.

I bought a male of the Argentinian race from a pet shop in Caracas.
It was badly plucked and almost completely bald. After two months
with not a pinhead showing, I was resigned to having a vulturine grosbeak
in my collection for ever. However, it did eventually begin sprouting when
it began a full moult, and became a fine feathered and beautiful bird. It
would eat about a handful of sunflower seed a day, would take some fresh
millet on the stem, very little fruit, but no mealworms or softfood despite
the good example set by tanagers in the same cage. It was quite peaceful.
I caught an immature male of the smaller Venezuelan race. At first, I took
this bird for a female but it cut its forehead and quickly grew blue feathers.
It too was peaceful in the same cage as the older bird.

I subsequently placed this younger male in a cage with a male American
Blue Grosbeak (imported from Mexico). Despite the larger size and senio-
rity of the Mexican bird, the Venezuelan bird pursued it mercilessly and I
had to withdraw it. I then placed it with various other, non-related finches
and it behaved perfectly.
This bird was a great character. It bathed with enthusiasm and took
every food I offered from sunflower to all the other seeds, fruits, lettuce,
chickweed, seeding grasses, etc.

I came across several males in a shipment from Mexico, and bought one
to make comparative colour records against the other blue grosbeaks. In a
3 ft (91.5 cm) cube wire cage with a few other seedeaters, it did well;
however, when placed in a cage with a smaller, immature male Venezuelan
Blue-black Grosbeak, it was pursued relentlessly and they had to be separa-
ted.
It is a large bird with a large bill but the shape of the bill is more like
that of a large sparrow than that typical of the grosbeaks (like the Haw-
finch). It took a variety of seeds with a preference for sunflower, but not
to the overweaning degree of all the other grosbeaks mentioned here.

This bird is known throughout South America as Rey del Bosque (King
of the Woods). We occasionally had a pair resident in the hills above Cara-
cas and could always bring it to within a couple of trees by playing record-
ings of its song which, incidentally, is strong and attractive. However, it
appears to be totally a bird of the tree tops and we could never bring it
down to our level. I once saw an old male with one leg in a pet shop in
Caracas and took it home at once. It developed a big callous under its leg
as it had great difficulty in perching. It would eat nothing but sunflower
seed. However, it remained fit and sang sweetly and often. During a five-
week trip to England I left it in the care of a friend who claimed it sang
well, but then had to leave it with another person who obviously was very
incompetent. Upon my return, I found it had gone light, also had chronic
conjunctivitis, and died within two days.
Later I found another bird - also imported from Argentina, I under-
stood - but although this bird had both legs it was in wretched condition
with bad diarrhoea, eyes dull, and very worn, broken plumage. Like many
finches - especially Embetiza buntings and Ploceidae weavers - with intes-
tinal problems, it took mealworms avidly. These I dosed with Vionate.
The bird soon recovered, taking mixed seeds with a distinct preference for
sunflower, also a little softfood, and apple, pear and lettuce.

They seemed to be not at all aggressive to other birds, but the conditions

On one January trip, deep into the interior of Venezuela, we saw great
flocks of Dickcissel, North American birds over-wintering in South
America. The following year, at the same time, I was better prepared and
set several mist nets on one part of the ranch where the birds had been
seen that week. At the end of a long and fruitful day, with dozens of
species photographed and a few hundred banded, we began rolling up the
nets. At the very last net, to my surprise and delight, were about 20 Dick-
cissels. I kept two very well marked individuals but not for long as their
cage was opened by accident. These birds were, of course, in winter plu-
mage with buffish edging to much of their feathering. I was struck by the
considerable variation from individual to individual, and also by their size
as they seemed to be as large as big sparrows.
In the short time I kept them they were noisy and aggressive birds
that ate a normal seed mixture. In behaviour I would liken them to the
Common Starling, including the chattering.
PASSERINA BUNTINGS Passerina spp.
There is a strong school of thought that maintains that all six species
of Passerina are, in fact, but races of one species. Conspecific or not, the
fact that they occupy significantly different geographic and climatic
ranges and, in my experience, have different personalities, justifies treat-
ing them distinctly in aviculture. Nonetheless, every effort should be made
to make comparative records. All aviculturists, especially those keeping
adult pairs in breeding condition, pairs of more than one species, would
serve their hobby well if they kept comparative observations.
Breedings of the Lazuli Bunting are extremely rare so it is worth
noting a report in Cage and Aviary Birds (29th November, 1973) by
G.M. Harrison-Wells. One bird fledged from the second brood - other
nestlings were found dead on the aviary floor. The parents took various
seeds, chickweed, and were very keep on mealworms. The breeding oc-
curred in a mixed aviary and there was no recorded aggression.
I collected a few Indigo Buntings in Chicago, both sexes, in the spring
and autumn. I did not keep them for long as they invariably bickered and
disturbed their companions. Herbert Murray kept the Varied Bunting
over many years. There were several abortive breeding attempts, and his
best effort was when nestlings reached the age of 10 days before deser-
tion. With the experience I have now (here in Japan almost everything is

hand-reared from Zebra Finch and Java Sparrow upwards) I think I would
have attempted to hand-rear. However, looking back on it, doubtless I
would have left my birds the way Herbert did. His flights were very large
and well planted. Nonetheless, he attributed his failure to the birds being
highly insectivorous when rearing.
I have recorded two reports concerning the Nonpareil Bunting in
Cage and Aviary Birds (August 1980). One is from M.G. Montague, who
gave a well-detailed near miss (2.8.1980). Then there was a letter to the
Editor from C.S. Reski (30.8.1980) reporting a successful breeding in an
outdoor planted flight in Cornwall. Apparently the birds had plenty of
livefood, including crickets and grasshoppers.
Finally, I have the following note recorded in the margin of my copy
against the Rainbow Bunting: bred in England in 1975 by Mr. and Mrs.
Aberdeen. I am sorry that I did not record the source of this information
as it no doubt refers to the first breeding of the species in England.

The White-cheeked is one of the most widely-kept touracos, so prob-
ably needs no description. The plumage is described and illustrated by
Mackworth-Praed and Grant (1952). It is an Ethiopian bird, T.l. leucotis
being the western race. The eastern race is Donaldson-Smith's Touraco
T.l. donaldsoni, which has the crest red, not black. This race is much more
rarely kept. T. ruspolii, Prince Ruspoli's Touraco, is a closely-related, pos-
sibly conspecific form with a very restricted distribution in southern
Ethiopia. The other species completing this sub-group within the genus is
Hartlaub's Touraco, T. hartlaubi, from Kenya and Tanzania. All are birds
of highland forest.
The White-cheeked Touraco was regularly imported in the 1960s and
early 1970s, but rarely since then. It is the most commonly-bred touraco,
young having been reared in at least 13 collections in the U.K. in the last
ten years, although the only detailed account of the breeding of this
species to have been published in the AviculturalMagazine until now came
from America (Everitt, 1965). The first British breeding record in the
Avicultural Magazine appeared in 'News and Views' in 1964, saying
simply: 'Interesting breedings: W.H. Rose, White-cheeked Touraco, one
and two reared'. According to the Members' List at that time, Mr. Rose
was living in Market Harborough, Leicestershire. There was a report of
London Zoo having bred them in 1971 (Olney, 1972), although the first
breeding there was actually in 1969 (Zool. Soc. London, 1969). Surpris-
ingly I can find no earlier published breeding records for the U.K. Second
generation White-cheeked Touracos were reared at Padstow Bird Gardens
in 1980 ('News and Views', 1980).
Summary of breeding results
My first two birds were obtained early in 1976. These proved to be two
hens, producing two eggs each in 1977. In 1978 a male was obtained and
paired with one of the hens (Pair 1); 10 eggs were laid, four hatched and
three young were reared. One young cock was retained and paired with the
other hen (Pair 2).
In 1979 Pair 1 produced three eggs but the hen was killed by the cock
during incubation. One egg was fostered to Pair 2, also incubating at the

time. Pair 2 produced 16 eggs, none of which hatched, but reared one
young bird from the Pair 1 egg.
In 1980 a new hen was obtained for the cock of Pair 1. Six eggs were
laid but none hatched. Pair 2 produced 19 eggs but again none hatched.
In 1981 Pair 1 produced eight eggs, of which three hatched and two
young were reared. Pair 2 produced 15 eggs, of which four were hatched in
an incubator and two young were reared, one by the parents and one by
hand.
In the winter of 1981-82 the cock of Pair 1 suffered badly frostbitten
feet, so a new cock was obtained and paired to this hen. Seven eggs were
laid, of which five hatched and four young were reared (two by hand). Pair
2 laid 10 eggs in 1982, all of which hatched and eight young were reared
(five by hand). All the 1982 hatched eggs of both pairs were incubator-
hatched.
In 1983 the cock of Pair 1 attacked the hen, so was replaced by the
original cock. Despite his badly injured feet, of the six eggs laid two were
fertile and two young were reared. These were hand-reared from two
weeks as the parents were fighting. Pair 2 laid six eggs, of which three were
incubator-hatched but the young not reared successfully. The cock bird
was then replaced by the one removed from the Pair 1 hen earlier in the
season. Two more eggs were laid and one young bird reared by the parents
but was later killed by White-browed Laughing Thrushes Garrulax sannio.
Therefore, in the years 1978-83, a total of 22 young have been reared.

Both aviaries have shelters approximately 6 x 3 x 6 ft high (1.83 x
0.92 x 1.83 m) in wooden sheds and have about a quarter of the roof and
sides covered with plastic sheeting. Both flights are planted with shrubs
and climbing plants. Some artificial lighting is provided in the shelters
during the winter, but no heating until late 1981, since when a minimum
temperature of about 40*F has been maintained. The birds are usually
shut in at night during the winter, also during the day in severe weather.
Feeding
Food consists mainly of fruit. Bananas, apples and soaked sultanas
form the staple diet, but other fruits including pears, grapes, peaches, tom-
atoes, plums, cherries, oranges, guavas (tinned), elderberries, blackberries
and strawberries, are given as often as possible. Other foods such as boiled

rice, potato, carrot, peas, sweetcorn, minced beef, boiled egg and chopped
lettuce have occasionally been mixed with the fruit, but usually prove un-
popular. Most of the fruit is fed chopped and mixed with a universal food
or equivalent, currently Haith's Prosecto, and also a multivitamin powder
such as SA37. The softbill food is also provided separately but rarely taken.
Whole, peeled apples and pears are sometimes fed, fixed on nails. Powdered
cuttlefish 'bone' is sprinkled on to the fruit when hens are known to be
laying. At this time hens can often be seen searching the aviary floor and
will sometimes take grit and small pieces of cuttlefish.
Maggot pupae are taken when young are being fed, and at other times
by some birds. One hen often eats Russian Vin e Polygonum baldschuanicum
leaves when feeding young. The birds are usually fed once daily, but at
least twice when feeding young or in hot weather.
Breeding
Nest-sites used have included fruit and fish boxes and a wire basket.
Most nests have been in an apple, or similar box, hung on its side with a
board about 3in (7.5 cm) wide fixed across the bottom of the open front,
and another board underneath to strengthen the base and fill any gaps if
necessary. A good base of hay is provided and the birds add a few twigs.
They have not successfully built nests in these boxes without the hay.
Clutches are of two or three eggs, more often two, laid on alternate
days. Incubation usually begins with the laying of the second egg irres-
pective of clutch size and is shared by both sexes, taking 21-23 days. The
young hatch with eyes open and covered in thick black down except for a
line along the crown, which remains naked until the crest grows. The
lores are also naked. The bill is black at the tip, pale at the base. The
chicks are fed by regurgitation and rarely left alone in the nest, one or
sometimes both parents sitting beside them when not actually brooding.
Young leave the nest at 20-27 (most often 21-24) days old. At this
stage they are very much smaller than the parents with short wings and
tails and the bill mainly black. I have sometimes had to replace young in
the nest but they usually find their own way back, although they cannot
fly. One flight has a Russian Vine growing near the nest which makes
this very easy, and I have seen young running up the wire flapping their
wings at 22-23 days to reach a perch near the nest. They continue to use
the nest as a roost for some time. It has always proved necessary to
remove the young if eggs are hatched from a subsequent clutch, other-
wise the period for which they are tolerated is very variable.
The transition from down to juvenile plumage is difficult to determine
due to the dark colouring and downy texture of the first plumage on the
underparts. The young birds can show a little red on the wings at only

three weeks old. By two months the white facial markings are visible and
the beak and eye-wattles are starting to turn orange. Growth continues
rapidly after fledging, but full size and colour is not attained until about
six months old.
One of the main obstacles to successful breeding is aggression within
pairs, experienced by most breeders, including Berry and Todd (1982),
Delacour (1973), Steel (1973).. With my birds the males have always been
dominant, although other breeders have encountered aggressive hens. The
original cock of Pair 1 killed his first mate while they were incubating eggs,
after breeding peacefully with her the previous season in the same aviary,
and almost killed his second mate while they were feeding young. In both
cases the attacks took place during electric storms, although all three cocks
have also attacked hens under other circumstances. I have quite frequently
had to split pairs for periods from hours to months, and at all times of
the year.
Artificial incubation and hand-rearing
I first tried artificial incubation in 1981 as at that stage my breeding
results had steadily worsened since the initial success. This was largely due
to the cock of Pair 2 refusing to incubate. The hen would initially incubate
alone but consistently deserted before the eggs hatched. If the eggs were
removed as soon as the clutch was complete and incubated artificially, the
hen was usually sitting on another clutch when they hatched and would
accept the young if this second clutch was removed. Even the cock would
feed and brood young supplied in this way although for only 10-14 days,
after which he would turn on the hen, who would rear the young perfectly
well on her own if the cock was then removed. Of course, this then left
the second clutch to be hand-reared. This technique has also been used
with the other pair when necessary.
Since 1982 eggs have been incubated and hatched in a Reliable Thermo-
stat 'Vision' still-air incubator, set at 99.5-100*F with the egg-tray in-
verted to bring the eggs closer to the thermometer. The eggs are turned
twice daily until pipping. The water tray is kept only just wet until
pipping, when more water is added. No humidity readings have been taken
but high humidity during incubation can be harmful, as I discovered in
1981 with a clutch set in a friend's incubator, of which two died after
pipping and one within a day of hatching.
These eggs are, however, otherwise very tolerant of less-than-perfect
incubation. The first egg hatched artificially was one of two which spent
the first week in a Reliable Thermostat hospital cage, which ran steadily
at 98-100*F. The eggs were well insulated from the heat source and a
small dish of water was kept in the cage. The eggs were then put into a

friend's 'Curfew' incubator with some chicken eggs, where one hatched
(fortunately before the chickens) and was reared by the parents. Several
eggs have hatched after being deserted in mid-incubation, probably for
several hours in some cases. Since obtaining the 'Vision' Incubator only
one fertile egg has failed to hatch and this was probably due to poor
incubation by the parents before its removal from the nest.
On hatching the birds are brooded in an incubator if possible for at
least the first few days (the 'Curfew' incubator makes a particularly
convenient brooder) and are then transferred if necessary to a box with
a lamp. The temperature is reduced to 95*F in the first day, then gradually
reduced further.
The first feed is usually given 6-12 hours after hatching, although the
young will beg after only an hour. Feeds are usually given every l-l 1 ^ hours
for the first day, then every two hours, and are gradually reduced to every
three hours as the young grow. Intervals between night feeds are two of
three hours on the first night, then two of four hours for the next few
nights, followed by one of six hours and eventually seven to eight hours.
A variety of rearing foods has been used, including various mixtures of
Complan, Farex, Horlicks, baby foods including Heinz Fruit Dessert and
Bone &amp; Beef Broth, and Milupa fruit flavours, mixed with fresh banana
and vitamins including Cytacon and Abidec or SA37, and plain yoghurt
for the first few days. This mixture, made with warm water, is syringe-fed
for the first two weeks, when the diet is gradually changed to small
pieces of fruit, mainly banana, and soaked Purina dog meal which is taken
from the fingers. This change in feeding techniques seems to make weaning
easier and the birds can usually be weaned at four to five weeks.
Several young have died or been culled during hand-rearing, the most
frequent cause being badly splayed legs. This problem often seems to be
linked to the substrate on which the young are kept. They are best kept in
small containers giving some lateral support (e.g. small rectangular marga-
tine tubs), on a relatively rough material (some paper towels are too
smooth). I have only experienced this problem once with parent-reared
young, when the parents had removed almost all the nesting material from
the box.
This condition was cured in one hand-reared bird by strapping the leg
to the body for a few days with masking tape, but this treatment failed in
two other cases, and seems more likely to be effective if the condition is
noticed in the early stages. In my experience, only one leg is affected
initially. The same problem has occurred in several other collections in at
least leucotis, hartlaubi and persa, often in parent-reared nestlings and for
no apparent reason, sometimes affecting only one bird in a clutch of two.
One bird with only very slightly splayed legs, not noticed at first, was

had perfect legs but bent toes, probably due to a break in incubation to-
wards the end of the incubation period. Otherwise the hand-reared birds
appeared perfectly healthy and only one bird, reared alone and kept alone
for some months afterwards, showed abnormal behaviour with other
touracos. As far as possible the young were reared in groups and put
within sight and sound of adult touracos as early as possible.
Conclusion
Touracos in general are often keen to breed in captivity but regular
successful breeding is much less common. Young have been reared from
only a fifth of the eggs laid by my birds, despite high fertility. Much sim-
pler hand-rearing diets have been used successfully (Berry and Todd, 1982)
and I will experiment further if the opportunity arises. I apologise for the
imprecision, and in some areas, total lack of my records, and I hope that
other breeders will continue to publish data.
Although at least nine species of touraco, of three genera, have bred in
Britain in recent years, and at least 14 are currently present in British
aviaries, only two, apart from T. leucotis, can now be said to be breeding
regularly. These are Schalow's T. schalowi , and the Red- or Pink-crested
T. erythrolophus, and these only in one and two collections respectively.
A large number of Hartlaub's Touracos have been imported in recent
years and hopefully these will soon start to breed regularly, as well as
several more rarely-imported species which have recently been available in
small numbers. It is important that our captive touraco populations do not
become too inbred, particularly in view of the ever-increasing difficulties
in obtaining wild-caught stock. Birds bred in my aviaries have now pro-
duced young in at least three other collections. In two cases these were
birds paired to completely unrelated stock from other sources; the birds of
the third pair were both bred here but were not closely related.

NOTES ON THE BROWN- HEADED PARROT
Poicephalus cryptoxanthus

The Brown-headed Parrot is also known as the Brown-hooded and Con-
cealed Yellow Parrot. It is usually seen in pairs or small flocks of four to
twelve birds, but up to 40 have been recorded. They are rather wary and
therefore keep themselves concealed in thick foliage of the upper
branches of trees. Conversational chatter is kept up continuously while
feeding. If disturbed, their flight is very fast and direct while they utter
very loud, harsh, ear-splitting shrieks and display bright yellow on the
under wing-coverts. They have been observed coming to drink at midday.
The sexes are alike and measure between 22-24cm in length. The
general plumage colour is green; head and neck dusky brown with a
yellowish wash; sides of head, throat and upper breast light buffy olive;
mantle and back yellowish green, the feathers laced with deep green; wing-

coverts and secondaries olive-green; under wing-coverts bright yellow:
primary-coverts and primaries brownish green, tinged on outer webs with
blue; under tail-coverts and rump bright olive-green; tail olive-brown,
tipped with green; iris pale greenish yellow; bill, upper mandible dark grey
becoming blackish towards tip, lower mandible whitish; legs and feet
greyish black. There is an excellent colour plate of the Brown-headed
Parrot painted by D.M. Henry, opposite the first page of the Avicul-
tural Magazine in 195 5.
P.c. tanganyikae differs from the nominate race in having the head
more olive-brown; rump, upper tail-coverts and underparts brighter and
more yellowish. Immatures paler than the adults, the upper breast suffused
with dull yellow.
The nominate race occurs in eastern Zululand, eastern Swaziland,
Transvaal (lowveld), south-eastern Zimbabwe and Mozambique (south of
the Save River). P.c. tanganyikae occurs in Mozambique (north of the Save
River), southern Malawi, eastern Tanzania and coastal Kenya, including
the oft-shore islands of Zanzibar and Pemba. This parrot is locally com-
mon throughout the lowlands, especially in the coastal districts where it
frequents coconut and cashew nut plantations and mangroves. It is also
quite common in dry Acacia woodland and the edges of undeveloped

cultivation. It feeds on a large variety of seeds, grain, fruits, nuts, berries
and nectar. These parrots have been recorded feeding on the nectar from
the dark maroon flowers of the Sausage Tree Kigelia africana , the fruit of
wild figs, Ficus spp., fleshy yellow-brown fruit of the Nyala Tree Pseudo-
cadia zambesica, globose fruit of cultivated Cassava Manihot esculenta,
inflorescences of Coconut Palms, seeds of Baobab Adansonia digitata ,
unripe seeds of Kaffirboom Erythrina sp., extracting the seeds from
the pods of Knob-thorn Acacia nigrescens , Umbrella-thorn A. tortilis and
Smooth-bark flat-crown Albizzia gumnifera, and probing the blooms of
Flat-flowered Aloe Aloe marlothii and orange-yellow petals of the Kiaat
Tree Pterocarpus angolensis. They have also been seen eating the young
green shoots of trees. They are partial to ripening grain and will raid
villagers' millet, maize and sorghum crops, devouring some but wasting far
more.
In captivity the birds will accept a basic diet of two parts sunflower
seed, plus one part each of white millet and canary seed. This may be sup-
plemented with apple, grape, spinach and raw peanuts. They are also fond
of the shoots of Bluegum and Silver Oak. As a rearing food a basic nectar
mixture of caramel and brown sugar mixed with warm water is quite ade-
quate as well as soaked sunflower seeds, Cheddar cheese, bread and milk
and corn-on-the-cob (maize).
Recorded breeding is in June (Tanzania), May and June (Malawi), June,
July and September (Mozambique), April and October (Zimbabwe) and
May, June to July in South Africa. From aviary observations of the court-
ship display the male struts back and forward along the perch with beak
held high, and uttering a series of single note twitterings followed by a
loud scream. This performance is repeated for several minutes. Six nests in
the wild revealed that all were in holes in trees, living or dead, with one
being an old woodpecker hole, and with entrances of 5-10m from the
ground. The nest cavity of one was 12 cm in diameter and 50 cm deep,
while the other measured 90 cm deep. The eggs lay on bare wood. The
Baobab is a known favourite of this species for breeding. The 2-3 eggs are
white, glossy and measure about 31 x 23mm. Low (1980) reports a suc-
cessful breeding of cryptoxanthus in captivity. One egg was laid in a nest-
box which measured 25 cm (10 in) square and 45 cm (18 in) deep with
the bottom lined with inverted turf and peat; after 26 days it was assumed
that the egg had hatched as a near-naked chick was observed a few days
later; the young bird left the nest 12 weeks after hatching. The Brown-
headed Parrot is known to hybridise extensively with Meyer's Parrot P.
meyeri on the Motali River in the north-eastern Transvaal province of
South Africa to the Sabi River in Zimbabwe. Museum specimens show the
presence or absence of yellow over the head and a loss of green over the

Mozambique hybrids were produced by crossings with the Meyer's Parrot

bread and water, putu (maize meal boiled until the water evaporated) and
corn-on-the-cob.

The Little Button Quail is about the same size as Chinese Painted Quail
-the cock is slightly smaller, the female somewhat larger.
It is a patchy, coffee-coloured bird, its back being bright brown with
lighter patches; the patches on the wings are larger than those on the
shoulder and on the back. This pattern is formed by the juxtaposition of
feathers with darker margins next to feathers with small, brighter patches,
which start from the head. On the wing-coverts the margin turns into a
dark brown band across the feather, while the patches become larger,
covering up to half the feather. This pattern goes on across the breast.
The female has dark brown feathers on the throat - in the male these
feathers are lighter brown. The feathers on the abdomen are longer and
red-brown in colour; the tail is short, the legs are flesh-coloured and the
bill yellowish.
Several subspecies of this quail occur on the different continents, in
Asia, Australia and Africa, and there is a subspecies in Europe, T.s. sylva-
tica , formerly found in Spain and Portugal, but now very rare and even
feared extinct in most parts of the range.
In the tropics these quail are used for fighting in much the same way as
in cock fighting. At night, when the oil candles burn in the cabins and it is
quiet in the surrounding bushes, these small birds are attracted up to the
burning lights and are then caught. The females are used for fighting which
is on a smaller scale than with game cock fighting, and often takes place
indoors because the birds are smaller. One can buy these quail very cheap-
ly in the oriental bird markets.
As a child, I kept these charming birds and they became very tame. We
played circuses with them making them jump over our finger or through a
bamboo ring. When they could be bought in the Netherlands some years
ago, I resolved to buy some; the importer found it very strange that I
bought three males to one female.
I put one male and one female in an outside aviary, in which I kept
Neophema parrakeets. The bottom of the aviary consisted mainly of pure
sand. As our daytime and night time temperatures differ considerably, I
decided to enclose the aviary with sheets of glass so that the temperature
inside would remain constant, especially when there was sunshine during

the day. To make their surroundings as natural as possible, I put several
big stones and grass clumps in the aviary.
Soon the male started to display and to call the female towards a
sheltered place he had formed between the stones and the grass clumps.
The female laid five eggs which were brooded by the male, and three
chicks hatched after 28 days incubation. As in nature, these young lived
on insects though I gave the birds insectile food as well as hard-boiled egg
yolk with crushed biscuit. Only the male cared for the chicks, feeding
them from food which they took out of his bill. In the same way, the male
made them drink by dropping water from its lower mandible into the
chicks' open beaks.
Meanwhile, I had put the female with another male and after about a
month, these had chicks too, but I was unsuccessful with the third male.
As I had no other aviary available, I left the female with the male and
though he too brooded the eggs, when the chicks were about two days
old, the female became aggressive and after a short struggle, the male was
beaten. I put the chicks in a shoe box which was kept to the right tempera-
ture and fed them with a fine paint brush. Their food consisted of egg-
food mixed with flour and made into a pulp with water and this was then
dripped from the paint brush on to the open bill of the chicks. This feed
could take up to an hour as the chicks had to have their bills open at the
right moment to swallow the food. After about three days, it became
easier and every hour they were given about five drops each. From that
moment on, the time between each feed was lengthened until they got
their food every third hour on the seventh day. From then on they ate
germinated millet given by the paint brush. When they were 14 days old,
they were able to feed themselves, so I put them into a larger box. I gave
them cow heart which, whilst still frozen, was scraped with a teaspoon to
give a really fine consistency This clung to the paint brush and was then
fed to the chicks, being mixed with egg after several days, and they grew
up successfully.
It was a pity that most of the chicks I bred proved to be hens because,
owing to their peculiar method of breeding^ the best proportion is five
cocks to one hen.
During the winter they stayed on the dry sandy floor, with dry straw
in a corner which they hid in. By accident, one bird was trodden to
death because they all dived into the straw whenever one went near them.
Their protective coloration is very effective and makes them almost in-
visible in the straw.
It is a pity that these very attractive birds are no longer imported, as
my strain will eventually die out from inbreeding as they are all bred
from the same hen.

THE ATTRACTION OF LORIES TO THE MADRONE TREE
By FRED BAUER
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.979063621621622" page_id="58080211"  page_num="221" year="" vol="">
(Garberville, California, USA)
The so-called 'Strawberry Trees' (Ericaceae) are amongst the most orna-
mental of the evergreen trees, and there are over a dozen species in both
the Old and New worlds. The dark, shiny green leaves, white flowers and
strawberry-like fruits are very attractive and various species have been
introduced into many gardens and parks all over the world including
Britain where very old specimens thrive, mainly in the more southerly
parts.
Perhaps the best known member of the family is the Madrone Arbutus
menziesii, a native of the Pacific slopes of North America, and whilst, of
course, there are no lories native to this area, I have discovered that many
if not all lories are strongly attracted to this plant.
In the countryside of the Mattole Valley in California where my aviaries
are located, the Madrone tree is a common and often spectacular feature.
It is said that the largest Madrone in the world lives nearby; this tree
measures over 100 ft (30.5 m) in breadth, its trunk being 16 ft (4.88) thick.
After watching native birds (especially the Bandtail Pigeon) eagerly
consume quantities of Madrone fruit, I introduced these abundant little
globes to my psittacines. The brilliant red berry-like, half-inch spheres were
accepted enthusiastically by some (Caiques, Hawk-headed Parrots, Eclec-
tus and Amazon parrots) and ignored by others (macaws, cockatoos and
most lories).
The following spring (1983) I offered Madrone flowers to the lories. All
species eagerly worked the small white, five-petalled, urn-shaped flowers
(somewhat like Lily of the Valley) with their nifty little tongues and many
of them then crushed and ate all or portions of them. This was quite plea-
sing to me as I had not found my lories show much interest in domestic
flowers.
Madrone flowers are borne in large clusters in great profusion on a stiff
central stem. Since most of them are high off the ground, I use an orchard
pole pruner to reach and cut the clusters. They are gathered in large har-
vest baskets and carried to the aviaries. Strong winds also make them avail-
able from time to time. It is a wonderful resource and I feel that these
flowers are an important addition to my lories' otherwise largely contrived
and unnatural diet. I cannot say that they provide a particular vital ingre-
dient, but they certainly supply a vital element of interest and pleasure.
But there is more to the lory-Madrone story. This winter (1984) I

F. BAUER - LORIES &amp; MADRONE TREE
discovered that some parrots are very fond of the smooth, bark-less skin of
Madrone twigs. These are a smooth, deep red in winter and bright, yellow-
green when growing. Except for new buds, these birds do not eat the
leaves. Most do not chew the wood but quickly peel off the thin skin and
eat it.
I was quite surprised at what happened when fresh Madrone twigs were
placed in the lory flights. Immediately every bird set about licking the
leaf sockets (I had removed the leaves to avoid litter). They then began
to preen themselves vigorously, as does a dog with fleas. I examined the
twigs and the birds with a lens but could find no parasites. This preen-
ing occurs within seconds of contact with the twigs and continues unin-
terrupted, in an urgent manner, until the source of the exciting substance,
whatever it is, is exhausted or every feather is treated. The birds do not
show much interest in dry, dead twigs.
After the leaf sockets are licked clean, the skin of the twig is opened
by biting, though it is not eaten as it is by the other parrots, and the
preening continues. It is very exciting to watch, especially the Stella Lories
Charmosyna papou stellae , who pull the whole of their long tails through
their beaks, requiring a real stretch over their backs to reach the tips. Each
bird also coats its feet with the substance until the skin glistens.
What is going on? What substance is this, and what is the requirement?
I decided to experiment further. I tried other plants, 28 to date. Several
(Douglas Fir, Arizona Cypress, Incense Cedar) generated a similar response
but none so far has stimulated the behaviour described above with nearly
the vigour that the Madrone does. Madrone will excite the lories even
when presented immediately after exposure to one of the other varieties.
The attraction is also strongly present when Madrone twigs are introduced
to hand-fed fledglings, especially Stella Lories. There is an immediate and
instinctive need for this substance.
Those members who are familiar with the terms 'anting' and 'smoke-
anting' will recognise a possible connection with the lory-Madrone pheno-
menon. Anting is a behaviour pattern in which the birds apply living ants
to their bodies, or bathe in smoke from burning twigs or chimneys. I have
not been able to find a convincing explanation for anting.
At this point let me remind members that such experiments could be
dangerous to their birds as some plants might be toxic. I have found, how-
ever, that healthy birds that are regularly supplied with non-toxic plant
matter do not consume that which is harmful to them and in the wild all
birds come in contact with poisonous plants. Nevertheless, perhaps it is
best to experiment on the more plentiful species first.
Whatever the attraction the Madrone has for lories, I consider it is
necessary if for no other reason than the birds' acute desire for it.

SOME NOTES ON THE SPECKLED PIGEON

Introduction to the species
The Speckled Pigeon Columba guinea has several other vernacular names.
In avicultural circles it is often known as the Triangular-spotted Pigeon and
in South Africa it is usually called the Rock Pigeon. As some writers of
regional avifaunas prefer inventing new English names to using long-estab-
lished ones, it has also been called Hackled Pigeon, Guinea Pigeon and
Red-eyed Pigeon.
It is one of the most widespread of the African Columba species, being
found from northern Africa (south of the Sahara) to the Cape of Good
Hope, although it is not evenly spread over this vast area and is absent
from tropical forest and other areas of unsuitable habitat.
In southern Africa it was until fairly recently mainly or entirely depen-
dent on the presence of sea or inland cliffs inaccessible to or not frequen-
ted by monkeys and other climbing nest predators. Further north, how-
ever, and especially in parts of western tropical Africa where it overlaps
geographically with the Rock Pigeon Columba livia , it was (and is) associ-
ated with the presence of Borassus palms, nesting in the cavities at the
bases of their large leaves (Harwin, 1963). Over much of its range it has
now taken to nesting and roosting on or in buildings, on sheltered ledges
under bridges and in mine adits. Hollows in trees and old nests of the
Hammerkop and various other situations (see especially Rowan, 1983) are
also used as nest sites (Goodwin, 1983, Rowan).
In captivity and doubtless in the wild also, the roles of the sexes in
parental and nesting behaviour is similar to that of Rock, feral and domes-
tic pigeons. The cock brings the nesting material and the hen builds with
it. The first egg is laid in the evening and the second on the next day but
one after, in the very early afternoon I think, but cannot now remember
with certainty. The incubation and fledging periods are shorter than those
of Rock and domestic pigeons, about 15 and 22 days respectively, in my
rather limited experience.
The Speckled Pigeon feeds on the ground in open country or savanna,
sometimes locally in towns, very often on arable land. When available,
cultivated seeds such as wheat, millet, maize, dari and ground nuts (pea-
nuts) comprise much of its food, which otherwise consists mainly of seeds
of wild plants. It is often shot for sport or food. On balance, however, it
has probably benefitted from modern man's provision of buildings, food

and water supplies. Also from his destruction of tropical rain forest and its
subsequent replacement by savanna conditions or cultivation, this has
permitted it to extend its range in the present century.
In the highlands of Abyssinia and Eritrea the Speckled Pigeon overlaps
widely with another rock-haunting species, the White-collared Pigeon
Columba albitorques. The two are much of a size and seem, at least in
Addis Ababa where both are, or at least recently were, quite common, to
have very similar ecological requirements (Pitwell and Goodwin, 1964). So
far neither is known to be having a harmful effect upon the other there
but it seems likely that they may compete to some extent. Introduced
domestic pigeons have gone feral in many African towns. They would
seem likely to prove a serious competitor to town-nesting Speckled Pig-
eons, perhaps also elsewhere as both species occur together in natural
sites on crags in at least one area of South Africa (Rowan). No competi-
tion between the two has been recorded but this may merely reflect the
tendency of many ornithologists to pay little attention to wild pigeons and
even less to feral pigeons.
Description .
The Speckled Pigeon of the nominate race C.g. guinea, which is found
in tropical western, central and eastern Africa, is about the size of the
average feral pigeon, perhaps a little larger than the latter when it is a bird
of (mainly) dovecote pigeon derivation, but a little smaller than a racing
homer pigeon or feral pigeons derived from this breed. The mantle and
most of the wing coverts are dark reddish purple which may fade to light
chestnut brown in worn and bleached plumage. A white triangular mark at
the tip of each covert feather results in a profuse white spotting over the
closed wing. The neckis encircled with a broad collar of bifurcated feathers
that are chestnut tipped with silvery green or silvery pink. The primaries
and secondaries are dark grey, the tail blackish with a grey central band
and some white on the outer edge of the two outermost tail feathers. The
rest of the plumage is pale silvery grey. In flight the dark shoulders and
tail contrast with the very pale lower back and rump.
A striking feature at close quarters is the large expanse of red or pur-
plish red orbital skin. The eye is yellow with an orange or golden or red
outer ring. The bill is black with a powdery white cere (when the bird is
in good condition) and the legs and feet salmon, flesh pink or pale red.
The race from southern Africa, C. guinea phaenota, tends to be slightly
smaller with proportionately slightly smaller bill, less extensive bare
orbital skin and denser, softer body plumage. It is much darkei on the grey
parts, and to some extent elsewhere, and has smaller white spots on the
wing. Juveniles of both forms are duller. Skead gives detailed descriptions

D. GOODWIN - SPECKLED PIGEON
of nestlings and juveniles of the South African form.
Personal involvement
I was about 15 when I first saw Speckled Pigeons. Cycling along a road
near Wraysbury, I noticed a number of aviaries in the grounds of a large
house (or small mansion). At once I stopped and scanned the aviaries
through my poor quality 6 x 30 binoculars. I saw Golden, Silver and Am-
herst Pheasants and, much more exciting, a pheasant and two pigeons
completely new to me. Moreover both we re very attrac tive and quite unlike
anything I had seen before. They were, in fact, a cock Swinhoe's Pheasant
and two Speckled Pigeons. I soon identified the former (from some book,
I suppose) but the pigeons remained a mystery until some years later.
Then I visited the place again and actually bought a Barbary Dove from
the lady in the great house. I took the opportunity of asking what the (to
me) mysterious pigeons had been and was told Triangular-spotted Pigeons
from Africa.
In May of 1941, the troopship, on which I and some hundreds of other
young soldiers were en route for the Middle East, stopped for two weeks
in Durban. Here, in a place called Clairewood Camp, we stayed for an
incredibly luxurious break. We were fed on South African army rations
which were not only, understandably, superior in quality to what we had
been used to but incredibly generous in quantity. Quite appropriately, this
food was served out to us by a genial South African army cook beside
whose girth and stature an adult male Mountain Gorilla would have looked
like a marmoset. To me, even better than the delights of gluttony, was our
being granted a great deal of free time.
Unfortunately I had unwisely taken my parents' advice and left my
binoculars at home (a decision I still bitterly regret at the age of 63 and
always shall) so I only got good views of the tamer wild birds. I saw no
wild Columbidae except some Red-eyed Doves Streptopelia semitorquata
and one cock Tambourine Dove Turtur tympanistria.
The Red-eyed Doves were in Mitchell Park and it was in the municipal
aviaries there that I saw Speckled Pigeons again, this time of the dark
southern race. As is the case in Britain, so in South Africa, it seems that
municipal authorities are unable to resist the temptation (I suppose
because they get the birds as free gifts?) to crowd their aviaries with dom-
esticated species to the detriment of the often rare, valuable and interest-
ing wild species that are housed with them and forced to compete, or more
often fail to compete, with them. These two Speckled Pigeons were in
an aviary with about 30 or 40 domestic pigeons of various breeds. There
were only a few nesting boxes for all these birds and, of course, each was
in possession of a pair of domestic pigeons. I was, however, able to glut my

eyes on the (to me) strange, dark beauty of the South African Speckled
Pigeons. It did not then, I think, occur to me that I might one day own
some birds of this species.
In the early 1950s I began keeping Speckled Pigeons through seeing a
pair advertised for sale, in Cage and Aviary Birds I think, and sending off
for them. When they arrived one had an injured wing, although it could
fly, and I think both were cocks but as neither came into breeding con-
dition, I am not sure of this. Some few Speckled Pigeons, the most
effeminate-looking hens and the most masculine-looking cocks, can be
sexed by minor details of head shape and expression but many cannot.

The bowing display of a vigorous male in full breeding condition is more
emphatic and exuberant than the self-assertive version of the bowing
display, which both sexes habitually use, but there is not a great deal in
it. I must confess that I was hopelessly wrong at first about two indivi-
duals which later proved their sex by breeding successfully. One was a
bird that I had picked out from eight others in a dealer's cage because
it had the most effeminate-looking head, and which later turned out to be
a cock. The other was a young hen which I bred, from a cock of the
southern race paired to a hen of the nominate race. While assuming and
just after having assumed her first adult plumage, this bird was so demon-
stratively aggressive and so constantly chasing after and displaying to other
Speckled Pigeons that I assumed she was a cock, until the effeminate-
looking cock mentioned above suddenly began to display to her, when
they paired and shortly bred successfully.
In all I kept, at one time or another, a total of ten Speckled Pigeons,
seven of which I had bought and three of which I had bred. Both for
aesthetic and scientific reasons I had hoped to be able to keep some or
all of them free-flying and, in view of their often living in or on buildings
in Africa, thought (wrongly as it turned out) that this would not prove
difficult.
The first "liberation" was quite unplanned. My only phaenota cock and
his 21 day-old daughter, who had fledged only the day before, escaped
accidentally and flew off into a snowstorm. I feared the worst but some
ten minutes later the cock was back, walking about on the roof of the
converted garage in which he lived. I thought it was only a matter of time
with him, so opened the doors (first penning his mate in their nest-box)
and also the door of a nearby aviary, while I searched for the young bird.
To my surprise, I never saw the cock bird again. It is most unusual for a
pigeon to be lost after it has once come back and I am still surprised at his
disappearance.
I had little hope of his daughter but, again to my surprise, she was back
next day and eating some corn by an aviary. This seemed a remarkable feat
as she had never fed herself before and was only 22 days old. Her growing
up had also involved her becoming timid (though from the time she was
eight days old I had spent some time handling and talking to her each day)
and when I went out, she flew off right away. However, next day she was
back and went inside the aviary whose door had been left open.
This 50% success under very adverse circumstances, led me to think
that it should not be difficult to "settle" Speckled Pigeons. I cannot now
remember the details but know that I liberated two under what I thought
were more suitable circumstances, but they went off and never came back,
and two others that escaped also never returned though one was picked up

dead five miles away two weeks later and returned to me (all had name
and address rings on them).
I think a probable reason for my failure may have been that the area in
which I lived was rather densely wooded and, from the air, in spite of open
areas created by large lawns and roads, was probably too unlike the natural
habitat of C. guinea for them to feel at ease in it or to return to it once
they had flown to a distance. I suspect that anyone living in a more open
area and who was more careful than I was to experiment at first with only,
one of a pair of nesting birds would be luckier.
Though I found most of my Speckled Pigeons were tame enough to
be watched from a few yards away, as with many other birds, complete
tameness could only be got by hand-rearing. The young bird mentioned
above was handled, brought into the house among people and so on during
her early days (eighth to 20th days) but nevertheless did not show com-
plete tameness. However, two of her young ones that I took from the nest
when eight days old and hand-reared became and remained absolutely
tame.
Unfortunately, I had to move to London in 1956, and my Speckled
Pigeons and other birds had to be given away. I tried to find good and
suitable homes for them but am not, with hindsight, at all sure that I
succeeded in this. Since then my Speckled Pigeon watching has been con-
fined to specimens in zoos, especially in the Snowdon Aviary at the Lon-
don Zoo in the 1960s and up to 1976.
Captive care and breeding
Though, of course, as for all birds, the bigger the enclosure they are
kept in the better, I found my Speckled Pigeons throve and bred success-
fully in enclosures of quite modest size. Some were housed mainly in a
garage, converted into an aviary but wired only in front, about 25 x 10x8
ft high (7.62 x 3.05 x 2.44 m); others in an aviary rather larger and higher
and with a shelter about 10 x 6 x 8 ft (3.05 x 1.83 x 2.44m) attached to
it. The birds always seemed rather quieter and more ready to breed in the
garage, probably because there they never had cats or hawks try to get at
them from above.
In very large aviaries, like the Snowdon Aviary at the London Zoo, it is
possible to have several pairs of Speckled Pigeons breeding in one enclo-
sure but in a more confined space, it certainly is not. I found that once a
pair came into breeding condition they would start attacking any other
conspecifics kept with them. Only when these latter were removed (and as
soon as they were) would they begin to nest. I have been told of a case
where a South African aviculturist habitually kept many pairs in an enclo-
sure of moderate size and found that if they were all left together then

eventually the dominant breeding pair would get tired of persecuting the
others and nest in spite of their presence. Such a course is, I think, to be
deplored on humanitarian grounds and those with enclosures of moderate
dimensions should be content with one breeding pair of Speckled Pigeons
in each.
I fed my birds on wheat, millet, canary seed, maple peas, peanuts and
hemp. Peanuts were a favourite food so I used to give these as titbits when
I was with the birds and also, in the winter months, to give each bird a
peanut or two that had been smeared with a drop of halibut oil, every few
days. As I had no heating in my aviaries, I thought giving such allegedly
"heating" seeds as hemp and peanuts could do no harm and might do
much good. The first pair to breed reared a single young bird (the other
egg had been broken), in freezing winter weather, very largely on hemp. It
was in perfect condition when it left the nest and remained so. Grit,
"Kilpatrick's Pigeon Minerals" and salt were supplied ad lib. Like all my
other pigeons, these birds ate lots of the Kilpatrick's minerals when feed-
ing young from four to 20 days old.
I used to put sawdust down deeply - 6-8in deep (15-20 cm), so it would
not blow about - on the floor of the garage aviary and the sheltered part of
the other and scatter and bury panicum millet in it. This kept the birds
busily searching about in it for some time each day. Speckled Pigeons will
nest in any sort of box or other receptacle that a domestic pigeon would
use.
Racial hybrids and varieties
A hen that I bred from a cock C. guinea phaenota to a hen C.g. guinea
was intermediate in coloration and plumage density but closer to her
father, especially in the shade of the grey parts of her plumage, than to her
mother. Two young that she produced when mated to a cock C.g. guinea
were barely distingushable from the latter race. Indeed, had I not known
their parentage, it would not have occurred to me that they were not pure
C.g. guinea.
I observed two colour varieties that were bred, undoubtedly from nor-
mally coloured parents, in the Snowdon Aviary at the London Zoo in the
1970s. One, that I first noticed as a juvenile in early 1973, had moulted
fully into adult plumage when I saw it again in March 1974 and took notes
on it.
It had some white primary feathers in each wing. The grey parts of its
plumage (but not the purplish chestnut parts) were slightly paler than
normal. The tips of the display feathers on its neck were paler, more sil-
very and less pinkish or greenish than normal. Its irides were not orange
but dark, like a "bull-eyed" pied or white domestic pigeon. Its bill, instead

of being black, was a pale fleshy grey, inclining to pure pale flesh at the
tip. The orbital skin and feet seemed rather dull but did not otherwise
differ from that of a normal bird.
The other bird was far more handsome. It was perfectly normal in plu-
mage colour but when first seen (by me) in 1974, when it was in adult
plumage but probably quite young, it had the orbital skin brick red,
strongly tinged with orange. In 1976, when I saw it again, its orbital skin
was a lovely bright deep orange, which contrasted very strongly with the
red or purple-red orbital skins of all the other Speckled Pigeons in the
aviary. It was a cock and was displaying vigorously on my last visit to the

I have seen the display flight of this bird only in the Snowdon Aviary a
the London Zoo. To my surprise it appeared more similar to that of the
Wood Pigeon Columba palumbus than to that of the Rock Pigeon. The dis-
playing bird would fly upwards with a loud clatter and an odd (for a pig-
eon) "fluttery looking" flight, then glide with wings held slightly below
the horizontal and with tail partly spread. Perhaps some of our readers can
give us details of display flights of wild Speckled Pigeons with unlimite
space available to them?
I have discussed the other displays and voice of this bird in a previous
article in our Magazine (Goodwin, 1956). Suffice here to say that its dis-
plays are very similar to but by no means identical with those of the Rock
and domestic pigeons. Its coos are loud and have a tone and intensity very
suggestive of the display coo of the Wood Pigeon. Its advertising coo starts
with a few muffled and slow notes which increase in speed and loudness.
Its display coo suggests a long-drawn version of the Rock Pigeon's but!
quite lacks the "broken" effect and has a more Wood Pigeon-like tone
throughout.

The crake aviary at the Phoenix Zoo houses one pair of African Black
Crakes. The aviary is 2.4 x 6.1 x 3 m (8 x 20 x 10 ft) and encloses a pond
0.92m (3ft) in diameter, having varying depths of 1.3 to 7.6cm (V 2 - 3in).
We have found our Crakes to be extremely aggressive and intolerant of any
other birds in their enclosure.
The Crakes were purchased in February 1977 and they first went to
nest in the spring of 1978. They nested in palm fronds set up on the
ground in "A frames", one frond flat against the wire and one leaning
about 20.3-25.4cm (8-10in) apart. They reared several clutches but only
one chick (probably the oldest) from each clutch would survive. The
others would grow weaker by the day and finally die. Some attempts were
made to hand-rear the weakest chicks on mealworms but with no success.
In December 1978, the female began eating her eggs. Sometimes she would
eat them as soon as they were laid, other times she would eat them after
they had been incubated for awhile. Many times she did not even eat
them, she just dragged them to the pond and broke them. However, she
still incubated some clutches full term.
According to S. Dillon Ripley (1977), egg-eating is a common practice
with Black Crakes. In some instances, both sexes destroy the eggs. Our
male, however, has never been known to destroy an egg and incubates
them very conscientiously.
By 1982 the female was destroying all her eggs, so we decided to re-
move them and incubate them artificially; no easy task as the eggs are
laid at night, a clutch of four eggs being laid on successive nights. We
would take them away as soon as they were laid and incubate them in
our waterfowl incubator at 99.5*F dry bulb and 89*F wet bulb or 68%
humidity. The incubator automatically makes a 90* turn once every
dour. The incubation period is 20 days.
Our female then began to re-lay every two weeks for the entire sum-
mer. We became concerned about her health and offered her dummy eggs
as replacements, but she continued to lay. We supplemented the hard-
boiled egg yolk and mealworms of the diet with Osteoform, a calcium and
/itamin supplement by Vet-A-Mix. Finally, in September she stopped
laying and she and the male have been incubating the dummy eggs. This
occurrence coincided with the addition of new and more spacious palm

frond nests which afforded the pair more seclusion and privacy.
Of the several clutches that we hand-reared, we found that the chick
from the first laid egg was always strong with a good appetite and easily
reared. The second chick would be a little less willing to thrive. The third
chick would often be quite weak and only the keeper's determination
would keep it alive. The fourth chick would be weaker still and often
have crooked toes; by gently massaging the toes frequently throughout the
day, they would correct themselves in about one or two weeks.
We also found that chicks must be hand-reared separately. The oldest
and strongest chick seems to intimidate the others and will grow while
the others will not, even though the others are getting food. When chicks
are eating well on their own, they can and should (for socialisation) be re-
introduced. This is a gradual process as chicks are very territorial even at a
young age.
The chicks are kept in boxes with a heating pad at one end so that they
can move closer to or further from the heat source. The heating pad is
placed half on the bottom of the box and half going up one side. Towel-
ling is then placed over the entire bottom of the box, covering the heating
pad to keep it from getting soiled. A smaller cloth is placed over all and is
removed once or twice daily for cleaning. The chicks also like to have a
cloth to burrow under. A 1.3 x 1.3cm (Vi x Hin) welded wire top is fitted
over the top of the box to keep the chicks from jumping out. A towel is
put over the top of the box on the heating pad side to keep heat in and
provide privacy.
Given below are the formulae used for hand-rearing the chicks:
1st week :
Soaked freeze-dried ocean plankton )
) - sprinkled with spirulina
)
Soaked trout chow
hard-boiled egg yolk
live brown worms (available at aquarium shops) served in water
In daylight hours only, feed from tip of finger every half hour to
hour, beginning when chick is 12 hours old. Some thicks are much
more active and willing to eat than others. Feed as much as they
will eat at each time. They will refuse when full. Dip beaks in fresh
water to accustom them to water supply.
2nd week
Start encouraging chicks to eat independently. Each chick will res-
pond to this differently.
Add to the first week's diet:-

Ground bird of prey diet (canned dog food can be substituted) and
white stage mealworms (after hard chitin skin has been shed).
Ground dry dog food, high-protein crumbles, chick starter, and
parrakeet seed (all dry and kept in a dish available to chicks at all
times).
Continue to feed all that the chick can eat at half to one hour
intervals. Even when the chick is eating independently, it is often
the keeper's presence that triggers him to go to his food dish. When
it is established that the chick is eating independently, it can be
left for longer periods. The nature of the food, however, requires
that it is changed often.
3rd-4th weeks
Start introducing soaked egg-maker pellets, shrimp meal, occasional
brown mealworms, whole bite-sized dog food in with other dry
mixture, and finely chopped fruits, vegetables and greens (they
particularly like avocado). Decrease plankton and brown worms.
8th week
By now the chick should be on the adult diet which is:
A pan of egg-maker pellets, trout chow, shrimp meal, chopped fish,
VilecSol vitamins (by Vet-A-Mix), soaked in water.
A fruit pan consisting of various fruits, vegetables, hydroponic
barley, hard-boiled egg and bird of prey diet.
A pan containing dog chow, egg-maker pellets, high-protein
crumbles, pigeon mix and parrakeet seed.
6-12 mealworms per day per bird.
Grit and oyster shell.

Whilst surveying an Essex importer's stock in 1970,1 observed a single
greenish, almost featherless pigeon, covered with droppings, on the bottom
of a small aviary with a wounded Turtle Dove and various finches. More
out of pity than interest I purchased both the unidentified pigeon and the
Turtle Dove, on my terms.
After proper feeding and conditions I found that I had a hen Thick-
billed Green Pigeon who, having found her self respect, provided my col-
lection of doves and pigeons with its first fruit-eating pigeon.
In 1972, at the November Cage and Aviary Show, I finally identified a
healthy male out &amp;apos;of about 20 assorted birds in various conditions and ages
in a cage at the bottom of the display. I bought the bird at my price since
the salesman had no idea what the bird was and was obviously glad to get
rid of it. The nuptial introduction established the dominance of the female
which I suspect stemmed from greed - two feeding dishes restored the
marital bliss. Because of the copious production of loose droppings, the
birds enjoyed their first year of marriage in a large mynah cage with a wire
floor.
Daily life consisted of parrot-like walking their perches when not facing
each other on opposite perches in contemplation. This behaviour con-
tinued when released into a large flight. From observations it would appear
that these birds climb rather than fly and this is further confirmed by the
unusual grip of the foot which is more like that of a climbing bird than of
a pigeon.
Year round food consisted of diced pear, apple, peach, melon, bananas
and British garden fruit when available. Dry Universal Food was sprinkled
on the fruit twice weekly and mynah pellets were given daily. Water, al-
though available, was taken infrequently and I suspect only for cleaning
the beak and preening.
During 1973 the pair showed little sign of courting or mating and, apart
from the odd grunt, had little or no voice. It appeared that the birds were
either too old or were incompatible. Each autumn I returned the birds to
the original mynah cage in a heated bird room but, in the autumn of 1973,
I put several branches and some straw in the cage with them. I did this
purely out of sympathy, to provide them with plenty of climbable mater-
ial.

Early in 1974, still in their fairly confined quarters, the pair started
tail-bobbing and displayed obvious interest in each other, sexually. Gut-
teral notes and owl-like hooting or wooing preceded and terminated with
the cock lowering his head towards the hen. The hen then responded in a
similar manner. The cock's display appeared to be in attraction and the
hen's response one of aggression.
Several eggs, two in a clutch and pure white, were casually laid on the
wire floor. The third clutch finally encouraged an attempted incubation
by the hen.
This serious attempt at breeding prompted the removal of the pair to
quarters 2m wide x lm deep x 0.70m high (614 x 314 x 214ft) with the
floor covered with approximately 0.30m depth of peat. These quarters
were filled almost totally with branches and were part of an outside flight
complex, roofed with translucent ribbed plastic which, in summer reached
a temperature of 90*F during the day and dropped, at night, to 40-45*F.
In the seclusion of this environment and provided with a handful of
straw, the pair made a nest on the peat floor furthest from the access door.
Two eggs were laid with both birds taking turns to incubate.
Both birds, when approached on the nest, turned to display a cocked
tail and vent with the head lowered away from the intruder. The unoccu-
pied mate would perform a positive injured flapping away from the nest
to attract the "predator's" attention. The sitting bird always "sat" very
firmly regardless of approaches and there was no wing clouting associated
with pigeon defence.
Generally my observations indicate that in captivity the birds do not
breed until they are quite mature, possibly two to three years old, and
must have complete seclusion and a warm environment. Seclusion can be
provided by giving plenty of branches for cover. I suspect that in the wild
these birds do not stray very far from their roost which provides them
with the cover and their food. There is very little flight and movement is
confined to climbing, so much so that one would think they were parrots
rather than pigeons.

The two birds developed into adult plumage indicating a cock and a
hen bird. The hen bird was slightly smaller than the parent adult hen and
the cock bird very much smaller. I suspect the initial acceleration in devel-
opment of the second squab to be lost during development on self-feeding,
means that they, like the parents, needed separate feeding dishes as they
would not share.

ON THE OCCASION OF THE NINETIETH ANNIVERSARY
OF THE AVICULTURAL SOCIETY

Origins are always fascinating. The Avicultural Society was founded in
Brighton towards the end of 1894 by Horatio R. Fillmer and C.S. Simpson,
two intimate personal friends, who had recently entered upon their pro-
fessional careers in law and medicine respectively. They coined the term
'aviculture', edited the first two volumes jointly - they were published
monthly at five shillings per annum or sixpence an issue - and acted as
Treasurer and Secretary respectively.
Having been bird enthusiasts from childhood, they had a fair amount of
experience in the care of a number of foreign species but, as Fillmer him-
self admitted in 1933, it is doubtful whether they would have succeeded in
making the Society a success without the co-operation of two much older
and more experienced bird keepers. Reginald Phillips, an elderly, white-
bearded retired civil servant, lived in a small house in the Hammersmith
district of London with his charming wife. The entire back garden was
wired over and connected to the drawing room of the house, and here they
achieved amazing breeding successes with birds such as the Australian Blue
Wren and Regent Bowerbird. And Dr. A.G. Butler, who worked for the
Entomological Department of the Natural History Museum, kept a large
and varied collection of birds as a hobby at his home in Beckenham. They
were both very keen and fruitful contributors to the Magazine from their
vast fund of knowledge on all matters avicultural.
Simpson relinquished his work for the Society after two years owing
to the demands of his profession, but Fillmer continued as Editor to the
end of the century, when his proposal to widen the scope of the Maga-
zine by including domestic birds, such as canaries, was opposed. This
apparently distressed him to such an extent that he resigned and subse-
quently founded an opposition journal called Bird Notes in October 1901,
which was destined for a highly successful run until 1924. From 1925 on
Fillmer was made a Vice-President of the Avicultural Society and came
back into the fold. Shortly before his death in 1942, he disclosed a long
and well-guarded secret. There was always a certain mystery about the
articles and correspondence in the Magazine from a Mr. Septimus Perkins.
This was obviously an experienced aviculturist, but he was constantly
changing his address and no one could get to visit him. The truth was that
there was "never no sich person" and Septimus Perkins was a nom de

plume for Fillmer himself, who also contributed frequently under his own
name thereby the more easily maintaining the deception. No doubt our
current Editor still has problems getting copy for the Magazine but I doubt
that she is having to go to such lengths!
In November 1894 David Seth-Smith, then a dashing young man of 19,
paid a visit to J.B. Housden, a retired business man, whose home was high
on Sydenham Hill, almost outside the gates of the Crystal Palace, south-
east London, where he won so many prizes with his birds. The young j
David was after some Australian Crested Doves which Housden was breed-
ing at the time. He was much impressed by Housden's business-like aviaries
and the number and condition of the many rare species he was seeing for
the first time. As David Seth-Smith was leaving, Housden rather tenta-
tively took from his pocket what looked like a small pamphlet, saying that
he thought it might interest him as it was the first number of a new publi-
cation called the Avicultural Magazine , published by a new Society he
thought he might like to join. So Housden put up Seth-Smith as a member.
What a fortuitous moment! For so began David Seth-Smith's 70 years of
distinguished service to the Society. As a most forceful Editor he took the
Magazine to unprecedented success during two terms of editorship (1901-
1909 and 1925-1934). Though a qualified civil engineer he became Cura-
tor of Birds and Mammals at the London Zoo and was famous throughout
Britain as the pioneer of natural history broadcasts. His friendly voice
came over the air in the 1930s every Monday in the "Children's Hour",
beginning, This is the Zoo Man speaking . When he died in 1963 he was
the much loved and respected President of the Avicultural Society.
Likewise James Housden's great interest in birds, ardent support of the
Avicultural Society and numerous contributions to its Magazine were
never failing. In 1942 at the ripe age of 92 he spent part of the last evening
of his life perusing his favourite bird books.
These, and so many, many others, who followed on, have through the
vicissitudes of ninety years (which included two World Wars) kept the
Avicultural Society together and maintained its matchless Magazine. They
have loved bird-keeping with the "love life-long-o" and been loyal to the
Society to the end of their earthly road. They are far too many to mention
and they come from all walks of life, from the most humble to doctors,
professors, dukes and even a King of Great Britain.
We believe that with the sources of birds for aviculture fast closing to
us on all sides, there has never been as great a need for the type of infor-
mation of which the Avicultural Magazine is a possible purveyor as at the
present time. Let us hope that where some have led the way, others will
continue to follow proudly on.

The world-famous Wassenaar Zoo is co-operating with the World
Wildlife Fund in a project to bring together young Bearded Vultures, now
thought to be extinct in the Alps. Out of approximately 550 zoological
gardens im the world, only eight zoos are recorded as breeding this rare
species and Wassenaar is the only Dutch zoo to join in this project.
Their female Bearded Vulture "Benno", born in 1983, will, for the
present, make up a pair with a male in Neumunster Zoo, West Germany,
and the intention is to release their possible offspring in the Alps.
"Benno" was hatched in an incubator and hand-reared with the greatest
care. Now independent, she can be safely put on the aeroplane to Neu-
munster, in the hope that soon her children may be given their freedom
far away from Wassenaar Zoo. It would be interesting to have later
news of how this project, which is being co-ordinated by the World
Wildlife Fund, succeeds since it seems to be an admirable example of
aviculture helping conservation.

Further to the interesting article by Mr. and Mrs. W. Grunebaum on
Breeding the Hyacinthine Macaw (Vol. 90, No. 1: pp. 11-16), believed to
have been a British 'first' for which the Society's Medal will be awarded,
Mrs. Grunebaum writes (October 1984) that the pair of Hyacinthines have
successfully reared another baby. The latest offspring is now flying outside
strongly and the full length of the flight. It was hatched on 5th June and
left the nesting box 14 weeks later. Apart from giving extra food and heat,
Mrs. Grunebaum did not interfere in any way and says that it was much
easier to rear than the first chick!

Malcolm Ellis has sent the following African notes:
The new species of sunbird collected on the Uzungwa Mountains, Tan-
zania, in August 1981 (see "News and Views", Vol. 89, No. 3, 1983), has
been named the Rufous-winged Sunbird Nectarinia rufipennis. Its secon-
daries are rufous-cinnamon, so is the outer web of the primaries. Presu-
mably this characteristic applies to the male and female. Otherwise, the
male is described as having a deep blue neck and back and a purple throat
with a blue then maroon breast band and a dark grey belly. The female is
heavily streaked and spotted on the underside.
Kenya has issued a new set of postage stamps featuring rare birds. The
five species figured are all considered endangered or vulnerable, in some
cases because of the threat to their habitat. The five are the White-backed
Heron, Quail Plover, Heller's Ground Thrush, White-winged Apalis and
Papyrus Gonolek.
Heller s or the Taita Ground Thrush is treated now as a very distinctive
race of the Northern Olive Thrush. The Apalis (a small, brightly coloured
warbler) may already be extinct in Kenya. Known there first from two
specimens collected in 1878, the White-winged Apalis has not been rec-
orded in Kenya since 1961, when a third was collected.
In Tanzania, this Apalis was rediscovered in the Uzungwa Mountains
by Simon Stuart, who discovered the Rufous-winged Sunbird.
Three ornithologists have claimed for Kenya the world record for the
most bird species seen in a single day. The three left Lake Baringo just
after midnight and finished in a suburb of Nairobi at 11.30 p.m., when an
African Wood Owl brought their tally to 290 species. The previous record
was 288 species, seen in Zambia in 1975.

A little-known watercolour of an American Egret painted by the great
naturalist and artist, John James Audubon, has been reproduced for the
first time anywhere in a poster being issued by the New York Historical
Society. The full-colour poster reproduces the 1813 watercolour (37 3/8 x
25 in.) of a lifesize Egret in a version of the bird that was not included
in the artist's monumental The Birds of America. The poster is the first in
a planned series of full-colour reproductions to be issued by the Society
from its unique Audubon watercolour collection and its publication coin-
cides with the approaching bicentennial of the artist's birth on 26th April
1785.
The poster, priced at 16.50 US dollars (unframed), measures 36 x 24in
(91.5 x 61.0 cm), was designed by Bruce Campbell and printed by Rapo-
port Printing Corporation on 801b Warren's Lustro Offset Enamelled Dull
Cover. It is available at the Museum Shop at the New-York Historical
Society, 170 Central Park West, New York, N.Y. 10024, or by mail (post-
age and packing extra - please write for an estimate).
For more than 100 years, the New-York Historical Society has been the
home of hundreds of Audubon watercolours and memorabilia, including
433 of the 435 original watercolours that served as the models for The
Birds of America. In February 1863, twelve years after Audubon's death
his widow offered these pieces to the Society for the modest sum of
4000 US dollars; today the value of this unique collection is nearly im-
possible to estimate.
The habitat of the American Egret is widespread, ranging through
North and South America. In the United States it can most often be
found in the Gulf States.

A Cinnamon Senegal Dove

In the October-December, 1977, issue of the Magazine (Vol. 83, No. 4),
W.D. Cummings refers to white, pied and other mutations of the Senegal,
Palm or Laughing Dove being 'popular' in South African aviaries. A further
note by the same author, in the first issue of the current year (Vol. 90,
No. 1) refers to Pied, Black-eyed White, albino and Cinnamon Streptopelia
senegalensis at Mitchell Park Aviaries, Durban.
Early this year I saw a 'Cinnamon Senegal Dove' advertised in Cage and
Aviary Birds and sent away for it. On arrival, the bird proved to be of a
basic fawn colouring, with all the normal markings present, bearing the
same relation to the original as the domestic Barbary Dove does to its pro-
genitor, the African Collared Dove S. roseogrisea. Although kept with a
normal male all summer, the Cinnamon Senegal (said by the dealer to have
laid infertile eggs while in his possession) showed no response to the for-
mer's nest-calling, and was found&amp;apos; dead a few days ago. A pity, as I naturally
had hopes of establishing the mutation. I should be very interested to hear
of anyone else having this or other colour varieties of the species in their

of fruits, and these usually of species whose wild forms occur within its

In the hard weather of January 1982, two Fieldfares spent much time
in the garden of my former home at Herne Hill, in south-east London
Both were first seen on 8th January, one on 13th January, both were
present on 14th, 15th, 16th and 17th. When first seen, they appeared to

richer in fats and proteins than fruit, but these efforts proved vain.
On the day the Fieldfares were first seen in the garden, many other
birds, including Blackbirds Turdus merula were feeding on soaked bread
and various scraps. I had the impression that it was the sight of these other
birds feeding that first attracted the Fieldfares but by the time they had
alighted, their interest was centred on a small wild Rose Rosa canina bush
that still had some ripe hips on it. One of the Fieldfares plucked a hip and
swallowed it with some difficulty. Then, taking alarm for some unknown
reason, both flew off.
On 13th, when I was again home all day, one Fieldfare came and fed on
the hips. As few were now left, I cut a sweet apple in two and impaled the
halves, cut side up, in the rose bush. When the Fieldfare returned a few
minutes later, it went at once to one of these (ignoring the rose hips) and
eagerly ate the pulp. I then cut some bits of raw, lean meat into "worm-
like" short strips of a suitable size for a Fieldfare to swallow, washed them
to remove the stickyness that sometimes makes birds refuse raw meat,
when they would otherwise accept it, and laid the strips, each separate,
on the cut surface of the apples. When the Fieldfare returned, it not only
refused to sample the meat, it even picked up three pieces in its bill and
flung them aside in the course of eating the apple pulp.
On the next three days both Fieldfares came to the garden for food
several times each day. I supplied impaled halved apples, their cut surfaces
rubbed and covered with fine white sugar and with suitably sized morsels
of meat, milksop and cooked egg placed on them. The Fieldfares very
eagerly age the sugared apple pulp but, except to toss them aside at times,
made no attempt to eat any of the other foods placed on them (all inci-
dentally, prime favourites with the local Song Thrushes T. philomelos and
Blackbirds). Most of the time there were various scraps on the ground and
much soaked bread with other birds feeding on these. The Fieldfares were
mutually hostile so that, at any one period, only one would be in the
apple-supplied rose bush and one would be seeking food on the ground. At
such times the bird on the ground never attempted to sample any food
other than fallen apple or rose hips and the droppings of its companion or
itself when these apparently consisted mainly of only partly or poorly dig-
ested hips.
Many birdwatchers assume that birds of any species, when hungry, will
take any food, natural or unnatural, that they come across, provided, of
course, that they are physically capable of dealing with and digesting it,
but this is not always the case. Even individuals, and perhaps especially
starving individuals, of such species as the Wood Pigeon Columba palutn-
bus, feral pigeon C. livia, and Black Kite Milvus migrans, may refuse to
sample a "new" food if they do not see conspecifics eating it and, at least

in the case of the Wood Pigeon (pers. obs.), sometimes even if they do. I
was, however, surprised that the Fieldfares refused meat and cooked egg
that was carefully prepared so as to be easily swallowed and placed so that
they almost certainly would (and, in fact, did) pick it up in their bills
(though only to discard it) in the course of feeding.
On the morning of the 17th, both Fieldfares came and fed but it was
then thawing fast and they were not seen again in the garden. Some modern
dieticians tell us that sugar is positively harmful to the human system,
except when taken in the forms in which it occurs naturally in fruits or
other food but these Fieldfares showed a striking improvement in condi-
tion after only a few feeds on the sugared apples. White sugar too!

THE AVICULTURAL MAGAZINE welcomes original articles that have not been
published elsewhere and that essentially concern the aviculture of a particular bird or
group of birds, or that describe their natural history. Articles should be preferably
typewritten, with double spacing, and the scientific names as well as the vernacular
names of birds should be given. References cited in the text should be listed at the
end ol the article. Line drawings should be in Indian ink on thick paper or card;
photographs which illustrate a particular point in the article will be used where
possible and should be clearly captioned.

Enclosed is the double issue devoted to conservation and aviculture
(Nos. 1 and 2, 1985). We apologise for the delay in sending it out, but we
do hope that you will enjoy reading it and will feel that it was worth wait-
ing for. We have tried to include articles on as many different groups of
birds as possible and hope that more authors may be stimulated to write
for future issues.
Our aim has been to try to present a collective picture of the ways in
which aviculture and nature conservation can work together, and the
results already achieved as well as the future potential. We would like to
ask members to show this issue to anyone else who may be interested and
perhaps persuade them to join the Society. We still need more members
and more donations to keep the Avicultural Magazine up to standard.
Further copies of this Conservation issue may be obtained from the
above address at the following prices each, including packing and postage
(surface mail): Members - British #5, Overseas #5.50 (12.50 US dollars)
Non-members - British and Europe #5.50, outside Europe #5 (15 US
d * Magazines Nos. 3 and 4 for 1985 will be ordinary general issues: No. 3
will be received from the printers shortly, but there is still just time to
send short notes and advertisements for inclusion in No. 4.

As avicultural subjects, the lories are among the most beautiful and
interesting of all birds. They comprise 11 genera, of which the most dis-
tinctive are, perhaps, the tiny Vini species. Found on islands of the South
Pacific, none has ever been exported on a commercial basis and all are very
rare or unknown in aviculture.
Of the five species, two are unusual in having the plumage blue and
white - the Ultramarine V. ultramarina, which is light blue and exquisitely
patterned, and the Tahiti Blue Lory V peruviana which is dark violet blue.
The plumage is set off by the white 'bib' and orange-red bill and feet. It
measures 14 cm (514 in) and weighs 31 g to 34 g, males being heavier.My
measurements are from live birds held in the hand; Forshaw's length of
18 cm is incorrect.
The plumage is identical in male and female except for the white bib
which may be marginally deeper in the male. Males have the head and bill
slightly larger, also the feet, which may be deeper orange than the female's.
! Sexual differences are not obvious in some of the young we have reared,
f At San Diego Zoo surgical sexing is used to determine sex, the instrument
employed being a 2.7 mm Wolf Laparoscope. The anaesthetic used is 4 mg
I of Ketamine which does not induce complete relaxation but is apparently
adequate for the procedure. The birds are not allowed to feed for at least
one hour before surgery. John Mitchell, senior keeper, informed me: 'Tahi-
tians tend to remain sleepy for three to five hours post surgery and are
given supplemental heat during recovery. They stay at the hospital for
48 hours' observation and are then returned to their enclosures.'

A vicultural History
In 1936 Eastham Guild, an American resident on Tahiti, took a number
of Tahiti Blue Lories to England. This would appear to be the first record
of this species in aviculture. The birds were acquired for the Duke of Bed-
ford (Lord Tavistock). After several months most of them died and it was
believed that the diet was at fault. All but one pair of the eight survivors
were then sent to Dr. Derscheid in Belgium. The remaining pair bred on at
least two occasions, despite the vicious behaviour of the male towards the
female. Tavistock (1938) recorded that on the first occasion 'about eight
weeks' elapsed from the time of the laying of the eggs to the emergence of
the youngster from the nest. This was incorrect as young spend about nine
weeks in the nest.
At about the same era, in the USA, Mrs. Gilbert Lee also kept this
species and hatched chicks which were not reared.
The captive history of this species would have ended at this point had
it not been for the activities of smugglers in 1977.
Distribution and Status
The Tahiti Blue Lory is found only in the Society Islands, the most
western of the Tuamotu Islands and on Aitutaki in the Cook Islands. On
Tahiti, the principal Society Island, it is believed to have become extinct
during the early years of the present century. It is rare on all accessible
islands within its range and apparently is common only on isolated small
atolls in the Tuamotu group.
Lorshaw (1978) describes this species as "seriously endangered". This
view is not shared by David Holyoak who studied the birds of Lrench
Polynesia during the 1970s. In his opinion neither this species nor the
Ultramarine "seem imminently threatened." His belief is that the main
long-term threat is "from forest loss" but as these species are not con-
fined to undisturbed forest, "they may survive in gardens" (Holyoak, pers.
comm. 1983).
These contrasting views make one point clear: field work is urgently
needed to establish the status of this very vulnerable species. Its range
has contracted; it was formerly much more widespread in the Society Is-
lands and in the Tuamotu Archipelago. It probably is not endemic to the
Cook Islands but perhaps was introduced there. In 1976 Neville Gare
stated that Tahiti Blue Lories occurred there in gardens near habitation
but were not conspicuous and total numbers appeared to be low (Lorshaw
1978).
Reportedly, it is common only on small atolls, thus nowhere is its
population likely to be large. Lorshaw believed that rats were responsible
* oi its extirpation from Bora Bora; he searched intensively and unsuccess-

fully for it there in 1971 and found rats to be prevalent. These tiny birds
have no chance of survival against rats which nest in palms and other trees
in the tropics. Coconut palms are the usual nesting site of Blue Lories, thus
rats could be a serious threat to their existence. Other reasons suggested
for their decline and disappearance are the introduction of the Harrier
Circus aeruginosus which may or may not have preyed on this species and
the introduction of a mosquito (Culinoides) which is a vector of avian
malaria.
Re-introduction to Aviculture
On 2nd October 1977, Dr. Art Risser, Curator of Ornithology at San
Diego Zoo, met two men who visited the Zoo. One was from Tahiti and
the other from New Caledonia. They said they were interested in acquir-
ing birds and asked to be put in touch with aviculturists in southern Calif-
ornia. Next day Dr. Risser was informed by several aviculturists that the
men were offering pairs of Vini peruviana . Customs agents were notified.
The men were arrested on 7th October, tried on 25th October, found
guilty and sentenced.
Meanwhile, the birds "became entangled in red tape" (Risser, 1979). At
that time birds not quarantined for the minimum 30 days were destroyed.
Because of their rarity, customs officials who legally had custody of the
confiscated birds, sought an exemption to the destruction rule. While their
fate was decided, the birds were in quarantine at San Diego Wild Animal
Park. Their fortunes were followed by thousands of interested bird lovers
and aroused national interest. I still have a file of newspaper cuttings and
copies of letters to senators and various officials who literally pleaded for
their lives.
I received a call from Dr. James Dolan, general curator of San Diego
Wild Animal Park. One way to overcome the problem might be to quaran-
tine them overseas. If this was permitted, would we take them, he asked?
The Ministry of Agriculture responded to the emergency and issued a
licence to import them in record time. (Fortunately, in those days no
other licence was required.)
Thus it was on a frosty morning in early November that my husband
and I anxiously awaited the arrival of a very precious consignment at
London Airport. We carried the box out into the wintry sunshine and lift-
ed the protective sacking to reveal the most exquisite birds imaginable. My
first reaction was how tiny they were and my second was wonder at the
glossy depth of their midnight blue plumage. No picture can prepare one
for their beauty and animation.
They were placed together in one flight in the quarantine room and
were soon feeding and exploring. It occurred to me how like tits were their

actions and call notes; they have a rasping contact note reminiscent of that
of the Blue Tit Parus caeruleus. I can visualise small groups of them work-
ing their way through coconut palms when feeding, rather like tits moving
through trees in search of insects. Presumably they do not need to move
far in search of food and have no need for rapid and sustained flight.
Forty years previously the Duke of Bedford had recorded sudden and
unexplained losses in his group of Tahiti Blue Lories. Within the next few
weeks we were to have the same problem. Nothing significant could be
found on post mortem. In desperation I spoke to the late John Yealland,
who was curator of the Duke of Bedford's birds when the Blue Lories
(both species) were included in the collection. He told me everything he
could remember but we remained mystified concerning the losses. With
hindsight and several years' experience of breeding these birds which, in
temperament are totally unlike any other lory I have kept, I have little
doubt that the losses were due to stress induced by other birds. Tahiti
Blue Lories can be extremely aggressive. I do not mean that they inflict
physical injuries on each other but they can quite literally stress a com-
panion to death.
A recent occurrence is a typical instance. Two year old birds, siblings,
had lived together in a 6 ft (1.8 m) flight all their lives. Late one evening,
when I turned out the birdroom light and switched on the blue 15 w
nightlight, one was chasing the other. At 6.45 am next morning one bird
was missing. When it appeared from behind the nest-box it was severely
distressed. Guessing that its companion had been chasing it, I immediately
caught up the aggressor and put a heat-lamp above the other. It sat on the
nectar pot with eyes half closed and wings hanging down. I knew that the
next half an hour would be crucial and that it would either lapse into a
coma from which it would never recover, or it would gradually improve.
Fortunately, the latter occurred. This bird had no injuries but had been
frightened almost to death by its companion. I never dared to reunite the
two birds but after one week I introduced an unmated bird into the flight
of the one which had been so near to death. I was surprised and delighted
to find that they were compatible.
Fighting between siblings can occur before they are weaned at 12 weeks
and separation has sometimes been necessary at this early age. On another
occasion, when introducing two young birds, one hand-reared and the
other parent-reared, in a flight which was neutral territory, the hand-reared
bird behaved so aggressively that the two had to be separated after a few
J minutes.
The Duke of Bedford recorded of his breeding pair that although the
male was most affectionate towards the female at times, on other occasions
he would turn on her viciously without warning. At San Diego Zoo the

same problem has been experienced. One morning John Mitchell arrived
just in time to rescue the hen from being killed by the male. At the time
the pair were rearing a chick. The female was removed and the male reared
the chick on his own.
In my experience Tahiti Blue Lories can be greatly stressed by removal
to new surroundings, even if only a few feet from the former accommoda-
tion. On one occasion a pair was moved a few feet from a cage to a flight
in the same birdroom. One turned on the other and gave it a severe beating.
On another occasion four young birds were removed a few feet from small
holding cages to a small planted heated flight. One died within three hours
of being placed inside (no aggressive behaviour had occurred) and another
showed signs of stress and had to be moved back to the cage.
This aspect of keeping and breeding Tahiti Blue Lories is extremely dis-
couraging. Most of our youngsters are hand-reared, and hours of work go
into the rearing of each one. Yet so often a totally healthy bird will die
within minutes as a result of stress from a situation which would not cause
any other lory to bat an eye.
After the 90-day quarantine period of the original group, arrangements
were made to return them. Within two hours of placing them within their
travelling cage two were dead and a third so severely stressed it never re-
covered. The attempt to return them was, therefore, abandoned. However,
San Diego Zoo already had Tahiti Blue Lories in its collection. A second
group of smuggled birds had been confiscated on 25th January, 1978.
Precedent had been set for exemption from destruction and, after being
quarantined in Honolulu, they went to San Diego Zoo, where they were
placed on exhibit in May of that year.
Meanwhile, we had been left with three birds, two females and one
male. The male was paired to a female who was in nest feather on arrival,
ie, she was less than six months old. She celebrated her ability to produce
by laying an egg from the perch in May 1979 (jrist before she was two
years old). The next clutch consisted of two infertile eggs which were in-
cubated by male and female (Low, 1980). A third clutch was laid that year.
When the nest was inspected on 26th November it contained a dead newly
hatched chick and one live chick which was probably one or two days old.
It was removed for hand-rearing.
Since that time the pair has bred continuously. Infertile eggs have been
rare and dead-in-shell unknown. Incubation is shared, as has been men-
tioned, but tire male appears to do more than his fair share. The same
applies to the feeding of young chicks.
fhv. incubation period would appear to be 25 days. Eggs measure ap-
proximately 17 mm x 15 mm. Incubation normally starts with the laying
of the first egg. On a single occasion the two chicks hatched four days

apart, instead of the usual two days apart. On one occasion only, both
hatched on the same day. The chick hatched four days after its sibling
would have stood little chance of survival so both were removed for hand-
rearing when the youngest was two days old.
The pair has never reared young beyond the age of four weeks and is
not normally allowed to feed the chicks after they are two weeks old. I
greatly dislike continually removing chicks, thus on two occasions they
were allowed to keep their young. Each time one was killed in the fourth
week so the other chick had to be removed. The risk of loss is too high,
thus chicks are now invariably removed before two weeks. Experience has
taught me that when chicks become noisy they must be removed; when
fed adequately they are quiet. The parents seem to be poor feeders and
the chicks' crops are never bulging.
This is in complete contrast to a sibling pair hatched on 26th and 28th
February, 1982. They are kept in a small planted house, thermostatically
maintained at 65*F (18*C). The first clutch, a single egg, was laid on 11th
February, 1984. It was broken halfway through the incubation period.
The next egg was laid on about 6th April. It hatched on 1st May. It was
exceptionally well-fed and cared for. In this case hand-reared birds proved
to be far superior parents than their wild-caught parents. I would empha-
sise this point because there are still people who believe the myth that
hand-reared birds are useless for breeding purposes.
The reverse is usually true. Being tame and steady they are not stressed
by nest inspection. We usually change the nest litter every week when
lories have chicks. When I removed the chick for this purpose and held it
in my hand, its mother would perch on my hand and preen it or feed it.
The moments when I held two generations of Tahiti Blue Lories in one
hand were unforgettable.
The chick left the nest on 30th June, aged 61 days. It was a joy to see
it with its parents. Within two weeks it could do everything they could do.
A male, it was removed on 9th September and a few weeks later a hand-
reared female, just weaned, was placed with it in a small flight. The two
birds were immediately compatible. The young pair made no further at-
tempt to nest that year.
This is in complete contrast to the imported female who recycles usu-
ally within three weeks, sometimes four. The year from November 1983 is
typical of their breeding activity. Two eggs were laid by 28th November;
one hatched on 22nd December and the chick was removed for hand-feed-
ing on 28th December.
The female laid on 26th and 28th January 1984. The first chick
hatched on 18th February and two chicks were removed for hand-feeding
on 26th February.

There were two eggs by 2nd April, one of which had hatched by the
26th. The chick was removed on 6th May.
The female laid about 25th May. By 24th June two chicks had hatched.
They were removed on 1st July.
Two eggs were laid by 3rd September. A chick seen on 28th September
was about four days old. It was removed on 7th October.
The first egg of the next clutch was laid on 6th November.
Of the seven chicks hatched by the pair in this period, two died during
the weaning period, one is currently six weeks old and the other four were
reared.
Chicks
Newly hatched chicks weigh 2 g or less. They are covered in longish
white down. This is not dense, as in some lories. At 10 days the feather
tracts appear as rows of tiny black dots. The eyes start to slit at about two
weeks but may not be fully open until 18 to 21 days. At five weeks the
wing feathers are erupting and, a few days later, the feathers on top of the
head. As the feathers open, the chick assumes a distinctive appearance,
shared only by (some or all?) Charmosyna lorikeets. The cheeks, lores,
throat and upper breast are bare when the surrounding areas are feathered.
At this stage the narrow, elongated, partly bare head reminds me of a Pes-
quef s Parrot.
Birds in nest feather are very dull coloured. The underparts are the first
area to be covered in feathers and these are dull blue-grey. The upper parts
are dull bluish, brighter blue on the head. There are a few grey or greyish-
white feathers at the side of the beak. The feet and bill are black. The
first white feathers appear at about five months and full adult plumage by
about six months. It takes longer for the feet and beak to take on the
orange-red coloration of the adult.
A spoon - no other implement - is used for feeding chicks of all ages,
including newly hatched ones. A Tahiti Blue Lory of a few hours old,
weighing only 2 g, will feed readily from a spoon. I have never had a young
parrot chick of any species which did not immediately accept spoon-
feeding and would attribute non-acceptance of the spoon, to the food or
both not being hot enough.
Chicks are fed at periods varying from every one and a half hours (for
the first two to three days), every two hours (up to about two weeks),
then every two to two and a half hours. Feeding is carried out between
6.15 a.m. and 11.15 p.m. Chicks up to about eight days receive a 3 a.m.
feed, this is extended to 4 a.m., 5 a.m., and 6 a.m. by the time they are

Crops are never filled grossly and the crop is usually empty for a period
of about half an hour between each feed. It is then quickly apparent if a
chick's crop is not emptying normally - the first indication that something
is wrong.
Newly hatched chicks are kept at a temperature of 92-95*F. This is
gradually reduced until by the time chicks are fully feathered at about
eight weeks old, or earlier in the summer, heat is discontinued.

Rearing Food
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.972906058823529" page_id="58080270"  page_num="12" year="" vol="">
The diet used throughout the rearing period is a very simple one. It
consists of two types of Heinz tinned baby foods in equal parts: 'Pure
Fruit' and 'Bone and Beef Broth with Vegetables'. Brand's 'Essence of
Beef is added to the food for about 10 days after the chicks are removed
from the nest. This additional protein is to replace the small insects which
I believe these birds would feed to their young, were they available.
Diet
Every day these birds receive 'nectar', sponge cake and nectar, a little
sweet corn (maize) and fruit. The latter includes apple and pear; pome-
granates and grapes are more highly favoured. A little greenfood, such as
spinach and lettuce, is given occasionally. Tiny insects are eaten by birds
in planted enclosures. Mealworms are ignored; presumably they are too
large.
The nectar mixture used is made up fresh two or three times daily as
follows: one heaped dessertspoonful of malt extract is dissolved in boiling
water. Two dessertspoonfuls of glucose or one of honey is added, then
three of a fruit-flavoured Milupa baby cereal. Water is added to give about
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.985010868421053" page_id="58080271"  page_num="13" year="" vol="">
35 fl oz (1 litre) of mixture, then about half a dessertspoonful of Fussell's
condensed milk. The condensed milk can be omitted in hot weather.
Some items of food are treated like playthings and are provided mainly
for this purpose. For example, the younger ones react to a small leafy sprig
of celery or a grape by laying on their backs and playing with it held in the
feet.
Playful characteristics
. Young birds are especially playful and will be seen every day rolling to-
gether on the floor. A two and a half year old pair still use the flat surface
of the nest-box for this purpose. Almost any small item will be used in
play. They delight in swinging, especially from a twig suspended loosely
from the roof of the flight. They work up a speed as they swing it like a
pendulum.
ij I have often observed young birds swinging from the wing or foot of
another youngster as it swung from beneath the perch by one foot. The
most favoured preening position of one young male is to hang beneath the
perch by one foot.
(10*C). Even though they are housed indoors permanently, and therefore
protected from the elements, a room heater or infra-red heat lamp (Sala-
mander, with a shatter-proof ceramic element, made by Infrared Inter-
nationale Ltd. of Salisbury, Wilts.) is used when the birds look uncom-
i fortable. If they roost in their nest-box a heater at night is not necessary,
but not all my birds use their nest-box for roosting. Nest-boxes measure
about 5 in 2 (13 cm 2 ) and 9 in (23 cm) high.
Given a choice between a bark-covered oblong nest-box and a natural
i log, a young hand-reared pair chose the latter. The internal dimensions
were 3 in 2 (8 cm 2 ) and 12 in (31 cm) high. Nesting material consists of
pet litter obtained in compressed packs (Petcraft). The behaviour of the
above-mentioned pair was interesting. When their single chick was about
j six weeks old, they ceased to brood it at night and roosted elsewhere, in
j the nest-box.
This pair is kept in a small planted house measuring 4 ft (1.2 m ) and
6 ft (1.8 m) high. (This size is adequate for this small species which has a
j weak flight.) The house is thermostatically controlled at 65*F (18*C). A
sprinkler system is installed for the benefit of birds and plants. The lories
delight in bathing in a Kentia palm when the sprinkler is turned on. In a
small space they are quite destructive to vegetation, having totally des-
troyed a passion flower vine and severely damaged a Ficus. Nevertheless,

I wish it were possible to keep all of them in this way. They derive such
pleasure from climbing and bathing in the plants and in sliding down ver-
tical stems. Once one has kept small lories in this way, bare, sterile flights
seem totally unsatisfactory.
The pair in the planted house provides more enjoyment than possibly
any other birds in the collection. The house adjoins the kitchen, whose
large window forms one side of their house. Delightfully inquisitive, they
often fly on to the ledge beneath the window to observe what is happening
in the kitchen. If nectar is being made, they demand a share. Like all
lories, they prefer it still warm.
Avicultural future
In December 1984 two young birds were taken to the Bronx Zoo in
New York. They will join some bred by San Diego Zoo. To safeguard the
future of this exquisite little bird in aviculture, it is vitally important that
other breeding groups are established. Its vulnerability in the wild makes
it imperative that it is established in aviculture.

(Division of Wildlife and Rangelands Research, CSIRO, Australia)
If
By 1979 the Woodhens Tricholimnas sylvestris, Slater 1869, of Lord
Howe Island were in grave peril. Few of these endemic forest-dwelling
rails remained on their small subtropical oceanic island in the south-west
Pacific and they were obviously on the brink of extinction. However,
much has happened in the last five years and today we can look at the
prospects for survival of Woodhens with much greater confidence.
The Woodhen story has been one of co-operation between research and
management. Research was needed to provide a basic understanding of
their biology. Management had to cope with restoration of habitat and the
urgent need to increase Woodhen numbers.
Research has ranged in many directions. It has involved the study of
all sorts of material held in museum, library and private collections;
labelled specimens, early photographs, paintings, manuscripts and many
published reports. All of these sources had to be carefully examined in
; the hope of throwing some new light on the plight of the Woodhen. Much
field work had to be done to determine exactly how many Woodhens
there were and what was their present distribution. Information was
needed urgently on many aspects of the life history of the Woodhen to
define broadly its environmental requirements. We had to establish why
it had declined and determine whether anything could be done to save it.
Management involved the consideration of a captive breeding pro-
gramme. Eventually, this was set up and it achieved great success but, at
the same time, efforts had to be made to remove predators and ensure
that as much as possible of the former habitat of the Woodhen was avail-
able for it to populate, either by release of captive-reared birds, or by a
natural colonisation from what remained of the wild population. But first
a little more about Lord Howe Island, its flora, fauna and history.

Flora, fauna and history of Lord Howe Island
Lord Howe is a volcanic island on a submarine ridge in the North
Tasman Sea at latitude 31*32 South and longitude 159*05 East. This
is about 700 km in an ENE direction from Sydney, New South Wales,
Australia.
The main island is roughly crescent-shaped and about 12 km long
by less than 3 km at its widest (fig. 1). Clustered about it are several
smaller islands and rocky stacks, including a group known as the Admir-

massive rock pinnacle rising sheer to 550 m, about 30 km south of the
main island.
At the northern end of the main island are hills rising to 150 m with
extensive sea cliffs. Much of the centre of the island is low lying, edging
a shallow lagoon and coral reef to the west. The southern half consists of
two imposing mountains, Mt. Lidgbird, 777 m, which has steep sloping
sides and no plateau; and Mt. Gower, 852 m, almost surrounded by verti-
cal cliffs with a summit plateau of 26 hectares. The tops of the moun-
tains are frequently in cloud and are covered by moss forest.
There is no evidence that Lord Howe Island was visited by man until
its discovery in 1788. Since then much has changed (Hindwood, 1940).
No native land mammals occurred on the island but several have been
introduced. Several species of land birds have become extinct. Two nat-
jive land reptiles, a skink Leiolopisma lichenigera and a gecko Phyllo-
dactylus guentheri , are rare; the land fauna of invertebrates has been
greatly reduced, certainly in numbers and, to some extent, in richness of
species (Recher &amp; Clark, 1974a and b). The flora has been modified
: considerably (Pickard, 1983).
Human settlement, which has been continuous since 1834, has resul-
ted in extensive clearing of lowland forests; but over much of the island,
especially the mountains, the native vegetation would appear to remain
unaltered. Generally it is dominated by subtropical rain forest, much of
it including one of four endemic palms. However, these forests are prob-
ably much altered in composition and structure as a result of grazing and
i foraging by feral populations of pig, goat and the accidentally-introduced
Black Rat. Only the sparse vegetation of the offshore islands is likely to
have remained little changed by man. Today there are about 250 people
resident on Lord Howe Island, augmented by a similar number of tourists
during the height of the summer season. There is an all-weather airstrip
providing easy access by light aircraft.
More than 130 species of birds have been listed for Lord Howe Island
 |(Fullagar et al, 1974). Many of these are vagrants and today only 28
species are known to breed regularly on the islands. Most indigenous
land birds are now extinct (Table 1). Altogether, a dozen or so species
J, have been introduced to Lord Howe Island, but only the Masked Owl Tyto
novaehollandiae and the Peewee Grallina cyanoleuca seem to have become
established (Recher, 1974). Masked Owls were deliberately introduced in
the late 1920s, together with several other owls, in the erroneous belief
that they might have some benefit in rat control. A small population of
the Masked Owl has persisted since then and has been a serious predator of
seabirds locally on the main island. At least eight species of land birds have

during the recorded history of Lord Howe Island. Today, at least 13 spe-
cies of seabird breed on the islands (Table 3).

The Woodhen
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.969007529411765" page_id="58080277"  page_num="19" year="" vol="">
The Woodhen is a flightless rail of medium size, having a body weight
of about 450 g. It is of a general olive-brown colour, but the wings are
boldly marked with chestnut and black bars. Woodhens have rather long,
slightly down-curved bills. The New Zealand Weka Gallirallus australis is
larger, but similar in colour in some of its plumage types, but the bill of
the Weka is much stronger and more wedge-shaped (see Fullagar et al,
1982).
From all accounts the Woodhen was once common and distributed over
most of the main island (Hindwood, 1940; van Twets &amp; Fullagar, 1974).
There is no evidence that it ever occurred on any of the offlying islands
and this is not surprising since none of them supports a forest vegetation.
The Woodhen is listed amongst the 21 endangered genera of birds by
the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. The only other
member of the genus, Tricholimnas lafresneyanus of New Caledonia, seems
now to be extinct (Stokes, 1979; Fullagar et al, 1982). It is generally
agreed that the closest living relatives of the Woodhens are the Banded
Landrails Gallirallus philippensis and the Wekas (Ripley, 1977; Fullagar
et al, 1982).
The plight of the Woodhen was not fully appreciated until as recently
as 1969, by which time the remnant population was, for all intents and
purposes, confined to the top of Mt. Gower (A.B.C., 1974); Disney,
1974a &amp; b; Disney &amp; Fullagar, 1981; Fullagar &amp; Disney, 1975). From the
time that Lord Howe Island was discovered it is probable that various
factors have led to a rapid decline in the numbers of Woodhen.
In the early 19th century the island was visited regularly by the crews
of sailing ships calling for food and fresh water. There is little doubt that
they would have taken any Woodhens they could find. The island was
permanently settled from 1834 and by 1853 the Woodhens were recorded
as only inhabiting the mountainous parts. Although small numbers were
known to persist in a few lowland areas well into the present century,
there is no doubt that the decline had been very rapid. With people came
dogs and cats (before 1845), pigs (before 1839), goats (before 1851) and
eventually the Black Rat (in 1918) (Fullagar and Disney, 1975; Recher
&amp; Clark, 1974b; Recher and Ponder, 1981).

Mt. Gower Study, 1971-1982
An environmental study of Lord Howe Island in 1971 (Recher &amp; Clark,
1974a) led to an intensive study of the biology of the Woodhens remaining
on Mt. Gower. For most of the time nearly all birds were marked. At first
celluloid colour-bands were used to recognise individuals when resighted,
but latterly-we preferred to use the numbered aluminium bands anodised
in various colours. Woodhens are relatively easy to catch. After some
refinements we found that with a little cunning we could shepherd birds
into a short length (10 m) of wader net. We used the upper shelf of a
twin-shelf net. Sometimes the loud territorial or other calls of the Wood-
hen played from a cassette player were helpful in retaining the birds close
to the netting site, but not always. Non-territorial birds often react un-
favourably to replay of Woodhen calls of any kind. However, in certain
circumstances replay may be useful in drawing Woodhens directly into the
net.

Woodhens on Mt. Gower feed on a wide variety of invertebrates includ-
ing molluscs, earthworms, amphipods and isopods (Miller &amp; Kingston,
1980). They always forage with the bill and do not use the feet to dig for
prey in the forest litter.
Woodhen males are larger than females and first year birds are dis-
tinguishable by their pointed primary feathers (Fullagar &amp; Disney, 1981).
Brown eyes are characteristic of young birds, but territory-holding Wood-
hens have bright crimson eyes.
The number of Woodhens on Mt. Gower, including those using the
Little and Thatch Pocket areas below the southern razorback (to be men-
tioned later), has probably remained reasonably steady at 20-25 birds for
some time, perhaps the last 50 years. From our observations this number
would include no more than 8-10 territorial pairs (Disney, 1974a &amp; b;
Disney and Fullagar, 1981; Fullagar &amp; Disney, 1975). Between 1978 and
1981 the number of pairs fell below this level and for some of that time
fewer than six pairs were known to be present. This was further compli-
cated by removal ol three pairs in May 1980 to set up the captive breed-
ing colony. By 1982 we reckoned that a reasonable recovery had occurred
when nine pairs were found during a comprehensive survey; and in 1983 at
least seven pairs were known to be present on top of Mt. Gower (not in-
cluding the Pockets).
Annual recruitment of young is often very poor. In most years five or
iewer chicks survive the breeding season and we have strong suspicions
that in some seasons none has been reared. Our best year was 1982/83
when no less than 10 chicks were banded.
At least one male Woodhen has survived for 13 years on Mt. Gower.
Overall, 25% of marked Woodhens are not seen again four months after
banding; 50% disappear within 18 months and 75% before three years.

Half of the chicks banded have not survived to one year old (Disney &amp;
Fullagar, 1981).
Generally, pairs remain together for life and use the same territorial
area of about 2-3 ha throughout that time. This territory is defended by
vigorous territorial calling for much of the year and, if necessary, this is
reinforced by aggressive pursuits in which intruders are driven off merci-
lessly on being detected.
It is clear that most eggs are laid between August and December. How-
ever, very few nests have been found because it is probable that most of
them are concealed down burrows made by Providence Petrels Pterodroma
solandri , which are abundant on Mt. Gower (Fullagar and Disney, 1975).
We have no evidence of broods of more than two and many are singles.
Rarely does it seem to be possible for Woodhens on Mt. Gower to be
double brooded. The season 1982/83 was an exception in that at least
one pair was certainly double brooded.
The juveniles usually remain with the adults until April or May and
they seem to disperse in June and July. The annual moult in adults occurs
after breeding in February and March. It includes the simultaneous moult
of 'flight' feathers typical of rails.
Setting up the Woodhen Project
Between 1971 and 1975, all work on the Woodhen was organised by
John Disney, then Curator of Birds at the Australian Museum, Sydney.
Various specialists were involved from time to time, in short but intensive
periods of field work on the island. However, much of the effort expended
during these years was given voluntarily, with the logistic support being
made possible by funds provided by the Lord Howe Island Board, the Aus-
tralian Museum Trustees and the Australian Commonwealth Department
of the Environment. Our studies during these five years led to publicity on
the precarious status of the Woodhen (e.g. A.B.C., 1974). In 1976 we
piepaied a submission outlining our views at that time about further work
on the Woodhen and suggesting what might be done to prevent what then
seemed to be its imminent extinction (Disney, 1977; Disney et al, 1976).
In 1978 Dr Ben Miller was appointed by the National Parks and
Wildlife Service, New South Wales, to start a two year full-time study of
the Woodhen, based on our recommendations. Ben Miller was to be resi-
dent on the island and an important part of his study was to be a careful
evaluation of the options for captive breeding and recolonisation. The
work was now being funded as a special project supported by public dona-
tion collected by the National Parks and Wildlife Foundation of New
South Wales.

P.J. FULLAGAR - LORD HOWE ISLAND WOODHENS
Ben Miller was able to corroborate our earlier findings. He checked all
parts of the island for Woodhens and notably some small hanging valleys
or 'pockets' below the southern ridge of Mt.Gower, which had remained!
unexplored until that time (see fig. 1). These pockets proved to be the!
only significant new localities for Woodhens, but because of their size it
seems that they can support at the most only two pairs (Miller &amp; Mullette, I
in prep.).
In Ben Miller's assessment the pig was the major drawback to successful I
recolonisation by Woodhens. He initiated work on its eradication and this i
was eventually taken up by the Lord Howe Island Board with great suc-
cess. Pigs have almost certainly been brought close to elimination from the
island by a vigorous campaign of shooting with the help of dogs to track
and bail-up the animals.
The Black Rat does not seem to present as serious a problem for
Woodhens as might be supposed. Early reports suggest that Woodhens
were capable rat catchers (see Fullagar et al, 1982) and our own observa-
tions would bear this out. Indeed, rat densities were found to be much
higher on Mt. Gower than anywhere else on the island (Miller &amp; Kingston
1980).
Cats have been controlled by trapping since 1976, but do not seem
nowadays to stray far from the settlement areas. Possession, breeding and
further importation of cats is now strictly controlled.
It is to be hoped that eventually the Masked Owl will be eradicated; but
so far the necessary effort required to track down and shoot the remaining
population has not been forthcoming. However, some useful reduction in
numbers is being achieved locally in sensitive areas.
A most important contribution by Ben Miller, in collaboration with Dr.
Tim Kingston of the Australian Museum, was a detailed study of soil fauna
throughout the main island. This was done to obtain some idea of the food
lesources available in different parts of the island and especially to identify
potential sites for re-introductions of Woodhens where food would not be
a limiting factor.
Captive breeding and relocation of Woodhens
In 1980, following recommendations by Ben Miller, a Captive Breeding
Centre was established on the island and a New Zealand aviculturist,
Glenn Fraser, was appointed with the responsibility of breeding as many
Woodhens as possible for recolonisation by release of the captive-reared
young birds. This centre was located in Steven's Reserve, a lowland forest
area within the Settlement, and consisted of several large closed pens
surrounded by a high cat-proof perimeter fence. Incorporated on the site
were laboratory and food preparation areas and also incubator and rearing

rooms (Fraser, 1983).
By June 1980, three pairs of Woodhen had been established in capti-
vity. These Woodhens had been selected as territory-holding birds in the
wild. Thirteen chicks were reared in the first season and 19 in the second,
by which time the breeding stock had been raised to five pairs. In the third
season a further 34 were reared and 12 more before the captive breeding
programme was wound up in December 1983.
At the foot of Mt. Gower on the south-west side of the island there is a
steep scree, partly stabilised by lowland forest, known as Little Slope (fig.
1). It was clear that this site was particularly suitable for the first attempts
at re-introduction of Woodhens. Ben Miller and Tim Kingston put it thus:
"Little Slope is a particularly attractive prospect for re-introduction.
Apart from the absence of pigs and the availability of a rich food resource,
at is isolated from the rest of the island by a cliffline and is inaccessible to
pigs, goats and dogs.Feral cats have not been sighted there for 30
years.The Woodhen was abundant on Little Slope early this century.
Its disappearance was probably due to habitat damage by goats which,
when put there in the late 1920s, multiplied rapidly and seriously reduced
the ground vegetation. In 1955, 300 goats were shot and the population
exterminated. The ground cover is once again thick, especially in the
gullies, and it appears that habitat recovery has been sufficient to permit
re-occupation by the woodhen" (Miller &amp; Kingston, 1980).
The first four captive-bred Woodhens were liberated on Little Slope in
May 1981. A further three were released in December followed by seven
more in February 1982 and a final group of eight birds in June 1982. By
that date the total release of captive-bred Woodhens had reached 22 indi-
viduals (11 males and 11 females). Woodhens proved to be difficult to
locate on Little Slope, but no signs of breeding were evident during the
first 18 months.
Shortly before dark on Friday, 18th February, 1983, John Disney,
Chris Davey and I made up a reconnaissance party which located and
then captured the first two chicks known to have been reared by captive-
reared Woodhens after release back into the wild.
Eventually it was established by us that four pairs of Woodhens were
holding territories on Little Slope, two of which had bred successfully and
for the second pair it was evident that two broods had been reared. Three
other males were holding territories, which in total gave a known survival
to that date of at least half of the Woodhens released in this area.

some excitement, because he was found near Salmon Beach, a lowlands
area at the extreme south end of the settlement (fig. 1). A Woodhen on
the lowlands was exceptional, not to mention the mystery of where he had
come from. However, as time passed he became well established and de-
fended a territory centred on a rambling garden with the run of adjoining
paddocks, a small reed swamp and some nearby lowland forest. In Novem-
ber 1981 a captive-reared female Woodhen was successfully introduced to
his territory to form a pair. This was achieved despite an earlier failure
with this male when he had been brought into captivity, but had proved to
be too aggressive and was, therefore, released back in his chosen territory.
Dubbed the 'Back Garden Approach', this combination of wild and
captive-reared Woodhens, occupying a garden area and being provided with
supplementary food, began to produce an incredible output of broods.
Nine clutches were laid in the first year and by June 1983 (18 months)
this female had laid her 11th clutch (a total of 29 eggs) from which 16
chicks were reared. Multiple broods were observed in which young birds
from one brood assisted in defence and feeding of chicks of a subsequent

rood (Fraser, in prep.). Woodhens from this source have now established
sveral territories at the southern end of the lowlands area on the island,
iy June 1984 it was becoming difficult to obtain accurate figures on their
umbers. An estimated 10 to 20 pairs were present. Several of them had
een assisted by translocation to favourable sites.
Final liberations
Erskine Valley, between the two mountains, was the next most im-
portant site for liberations after Little Slope, especially with the know-
3 dge that Woodhens were spreading well in the settled lowlands. In Ers-
;ine Valley the first group of 17 birds was released in January 1983, fol-
owed by eight more in February and a further nine in June. Some more
tirds were liberated at Boat Harbour, east of Mt. Lidgbird and at the 'Goat
louse' high on the north-eastern side of Mt. Lidgbird. In all, 74 captive-
&amp;gt;red Woodhens were released by the end of 1983 (Table 4).
By June 1984 the number of Woodhens at large on Lord Howe Island
nust certainly have exceeded 200 compared with less than 30 only five
&amp;apos;ears before. It is still, of course, early days to judge the success of the
project and the next few years are most important if the Woodhen is to
pecome well-established.

What has it cost and what has been achieved?
Converted to 1984 values the entire field programme, which concen-
trated on the Mt. Gower Woodhen study and involved 15 visits to Lord
Howe Island between 1971 and 1983, cost about 70,000 dollars (Austra-
lian). The Captive Breeding Project, including the two years of full-time
study by Ben Miller, cost the Foundation 268,000 dollars. Some addition-
al costs cannot be assessed accurately as, for example, work done as part |
of the Woodhen studies, by Rangers employed by the Board. Control ofj
goats and pigs has probably cost an additional 20,000 dollars.
If asked why the Woodhens should be conserved, we can no doubt i
provide some moral justification based on years of neglect. The avifauna
of Lord Howe Island is also a major biological resource and the Woodhen
could well be a symbol of conservation and enlightened management, if
not for all of Australia, then certainly for Lord Howe Island (Recher.
1981). In conserving the Woodhen it must be accepted that it has not been
a difficult species to manage. It is flightless, confiding and can be observed
readily in the wild even though it so often chooses to live in the densest of
vegetation. Captive breeding has been rewarding, and this critical part of
the project has run without serious complications. Success in captive
breeding must be attributed to good planning, close attention to detail and
above all the exceptional skill and patience of Glenn Fraser. The gradual
build-up in our knowledge about the Woodhen has meant that a logical
plan of action has been possible at each step.
One of the most striking features of the study has been the clear
demonstration that the residual population of Woodhens on Mt. Gower
survived in desperately marginal habitat. Endangered species should not
necessarily be assumed to occupy remnant prime habitat. Mt. Gower was
free ot a critical predator, but ecologically the population was delicately
balanced with little room for error. Mt. Gower could not support a very
large population and the capacity for increase was severely restricted for
those birds that did manage to hold territories. It is remarkable that a
small population persisted at this site for so long - probably 50 years.
In contrast, Woodhens on the lowlands show much greater rates of
increase and reveal social behaviours within the breeding groups that are
more or less impossible for Mt. Gower Woodhens. Too much attention to
detail on Mt. Gower might have led to concepts about behaviour and
population dynamics that would be irrelevant for an understanding of
Woodhens on the lowlands.
Captive-bred Woodhens have been re-introduced successfully into
their natural environment, have survived and have been shown to breed
and rear young. I believe there is no other example of this course of
action yet demonstrated in the conservation of any species of endangered
bird.

BREEDING LEAR S MACAW
Anodorhynchus leari
AT THE BUSCH GARDENS (Tampa, Florida)
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9742675" page_id="58080288"  page_num="30" year="" vol="">
By ED BISH (Curator of Psittacines)
The first hatching of a Lear's or Indigo Macaw occurred at Busch Gar-
dens in July 1982. The Lear's Macaw is very similar in appearance to the
Hyacinth but smaller in size and greenish-blue in plumage. This species was
known only from captive birds which reached collectors and zoos in the
mid-19th century. It is kept in fewer than half a dozen collections outside
its native Brazil and had never previously nested in captivity.
The male of the Busch Gardens pair was on breeding loan from another
well-known Florida collection, Parrot Jungle in Miami. On the same day it
hatched, the chick was taken to Miami, where it was successfully hand-
reared by Mr. and Mrs. Jerome Scherr, owners of Parrot Jungle.
On 22nd September, 1982, a second chick was hatched at Busch Gar-
dens, and it was being reared by the parents but did not survive. Two
chicks were hatched in 1983, but did not survive. This year, the first
clutch of three eggs was infertile. Two chicks hatched from the second
clutch of three eggs on 27th and 29th June and are now being hand-reared
by Mr. and Mrs. Scherr.
The birds which make up our breeding pair are quite old, the male
having been in the Parrot Jungle collection for over 25 years, and the
female in the Busch Gardens collection for over 20 years.

At Busch Gardens they are housed in a cage measuring 3 ft (0.92 m) sq
and 7 ft (2.14m) high. The nesting area is behind a concrete block wall,
with an opening large enough for a macaw to enter the nesting area, which
jmeasures 3 ft sq. and 4 ft (1.22m) high. The nesting facilities inside the
nesting area consist of two metal wash tubs, wired together at their open
end, with a small opening cut in the top tub. Wood shavings are used for
nesting material. The tubs and nesting area are thoroughly cleaned and
disinfected twice a year, and all precautions are taken to insure a healthy
environment for this pair of birds. They have been laying three to four
clutches of eggs every year, so quite a lot of time is spent in the nesting
area.
Their diet consists of peanuts, sunflower seed, safflower seed, small
dog biscuits, wheat germ oil, carrots, celery, Chinese cabbage, apples, beets
and vitamins.
Breeding Lear's Macaw is a most notable achievement as this species
is the rarest and most endangered of all parrots. It has often been des-
cribed as one of the greatest mysteries in South American ornithology
for, until 1978, all that was known about it was that it came from Brazil.
The location of this species had never been found in the wild by natural-
ists, although it was thought to exist in north-eastern Brazil, in the state
of Bahia. Then in 1978, Helmut Sick, a Brazilian ornithologist, discovered
the Lear's Macaw in an inaccessible wilderness area on the Bahia plateau,
previously thought to be an unlikely habitat for any macaw species. A
flock of 20 birds was seen, but the range of this species is apparently very
limited and the total population small. It is a fortunate coincidence that
part of this Macaw's habitat lies within a reserve.
For many years this species was thought to be a hybrid of the
&amp;apos; Hyacinth A. hyacinthinus and the Glaucous Macaw A. glaucus , but this
theory has now been discounted since the discovery of a viable wild
population which is ecologically isolated from the other two species.
Concern has already been expressed that collectors and dealers might seek
out these birds due to their enormous commercial value, and measures
are now being taken to protect this area.
Meanwhile, breeding Lear's Macaw in captivity is of very great impor-
tance. At this time, there are not many Lear's Macaws in captivity - two in
Brazil, one in England, one in Paris, and two in the United States other
than the breeding pair at Busch Gardens.

Drepanoptila holosericea
By Dr. HENRY QUINQUE
(Bondy, France)
The Cloven-feathered Dove is fascinating for its exceptional beauty, its
secretive habits and the almost complete ignorance that has prevailed
about its way of life and breeding behaviour.
It was first described in 1811 by Temminck and represented in Plate 32
of his sumptuous monograph Les Pigeons, which was brilliantly illustrated
by Pauline de Courcelles, Madame Knip. It was therein given also the amu-
sing popular name of'Vlouvlou'.
The scientific name aptly expresses its two principal morphological
characters: the divided ends of the wing feathers and its overall silky ap-
pearance.
It is a fruit-eating pigeon of the family Treronidae, endemic to the island
of New Caledonia and the unique species of its genus.
Although in theory completely protected by the law, its insular habitat
renders its survival in the long term unlikely, and its extinction would be a
grievous loss. To preserve it, captive breeding is an essential supplement to
its protection in the wild.
Dr Jean Delacour's excellent Guide to the Birds of New Caledonia (in
French) has been widely read on the island and has had a decisive influence
in making the public aware of this exceptional and fragile jewel which has
been entrusted to their care and which they must preserve for posterity.
I am constantly asked for this book, which is now scarce and a reprint is
urgently required.
It has been my good fortune to achieve repeated success in breeding the
Cloven-feathered Dove in captivity and I wish to lay before you my exper-
iences. The account of the bird in the wild which I shall give is, for the
main part, due to information supplied to me by Monsieur H. Bregulla,
a very competent ornithologist whose speciality is the Pacific avifauna.
Description
The genus Drepanoptila can be defined by the following three special
characters:
1) The crest formed by the dense silky green feathers of the forehead
making a rounded bulge which gives the head a typically elongated
profile.
2) The primary feathers of the wings, shaped like an italic 'S' are divi-

ded at the ends, a feature unique among birds. The posterior part of
the division is rounded, but the anterior part is very slender, sickle-
shaped and forming a hook at the tip. This unique formation produces
a peculiar musical whistle at each beat of the wings.
3) The silvery dorsal bars - the back is marked by transverse bars on the
wings and the tail. These vague and misty marks are like a fine silver
powder sprinkled over the green of the plumage. The minute grains
resemble the scales of butterfly wings and give the impression that if
touched they would stick to the fingers, or if blown upon they would
fly away. They seem like a deposit on the feathers, an impression
heightened by the fact that their shade is not uniform but deeper at
the middle than at the edges of the bars.
The adult male is a magnificent bird, fairly large, well-formed and
powerful without being bulky. The average length is 32 cm (1214 in) and
the weight 220 g (7% oz). The head, neck, breast, back and thighs are a
brilliant emerald green with gold reflections, varying according to the
incidence of the light. An elongated pure white stripe extends from the
base of the bill and tapers to a point in the centre of the breast.
The eye is reddish-brown, the bill small and thin, bluish-green at the
base and black at the tip.
The belly is yellow with green reflections and the under-tail coverts,
which are as long as the 14 tail feathers, are golden yellow. The division
between the emerald green of the breast and the yellow of the lower
parts is clearly marked by two regular upward curving semicircles. The
pure white line of the upper semicircle is emphasised by the pure black
semicircle, twice as wide, below it.
The feet are dark red, large and powerful, the toes enlarged by exten-
sions of the skin below. They are partly concealed by wide silky tufts
which completely cover the tarsi.
The adult female is smaller, less brilliant and much more slender than
the male. Its length averages 28 cm (11 in) and its weight 160 g (just over
5Vi oz). It has all the characteristics of the male but in a lesser and duller
form, although the prevailing green is also very beautiful. The belly is
greenish, thinly spotted with yellow; the yellow of the under-tail coverts is
much less brilliant. The semi-circles of the breast occur in some females
but are indistinct, in others they are practically absent. The tips of the
flight feathers and the bill are black.
Behaviour
The Cloven-feathered Dove is gentle and trusting, but at the same time

nervous and very sensitive to its environment. During the period of accli-
matisation I kept several pairs without any problems for several months in
a small tropical house of 10 yd 3 (9.10 m 3 ). Serious problems began with
efforts to isolate the pairs. Each time that a pair was put in an aviary by
itself it refused all food. Curiously, the birds remaining in the group be-
haved in the same way. After several attempts we were obliged to put the
birds back together. They then began to eat immediately.
When the pairs were finally separated for breeding, we suffered the loss
of one female, which was killed almost immediately by the male. This
period was a severe trial from which we drew the conclusion that this bird
is sedentary, sensitive to its social environment, and that it is essential to
respect the compatability of pairs.
Habitat
The Green Pigeon, which is its local name, is strictly endemic to the
island of New Caledonia.
Although never numerous, it is found in those parts of the island where
there are humid forests or groves which provide the fruits on which it
feeds. A friend informed me that he had found several individuals in an
abandoned coffee plantation.
Silent when feeding, it is practically invisible when motionless in the
foliage. Only a very keen ear can detect the peculiar whistling of the wings
as it moves from one branch to another. It always perches as high as pos-
sible when feeding and only descends to the lower branches when the
fruits above are exhausted. When it drinks it is seldom on the ground but
almost always perched on a low branch overhanging the water. Although a
number of birds come together to feed, they are not gregarious and the
pairs separate when they have fed. The bird is sedentary but groups move
to different localities determined by the availability of ripened fruit. In
captivity they never bathe or dust themselves.
Food
Like the Ptilopidae, they are frui - rs and are r special! v attracted by
fruits of the fig family. Tnese fruits wh.. &amp;apos;&amp;quot;*pe are frequently parasitised by
insects and their eggs and larvae, which provide an indirect supplement of
animal protein to the diet.
In captivity, a balanced diet is essential to keep the bird in good health
and prevent too much gain in weight as well as the production of infertile
eggs. We give fruit cut in pieces, which are swallowed whole, even when
quite large - grapes or raisins, apples, pears, currants, blueberries and wild
berries such as those of cotoneaster and hawthorn.Cubes of tomato and
boiled carrot are much appreciated. In the aviaries pieces of leaf and buds

are often eaten. However, an addition of protein is essential, and we use a
softbill mixture spread on the fruit. It is thanks to this mixture that we
obtained our first fertile eggs but the paste is never accepted on its own
and must be mixed with fruit. Insects are always refused.
Breeding
Breeding is only possible from a pair which is perfectly compatible,
otherwise the life of the female is at risk or the male completely indif-
ferent. Pairs have been kept in two sorts of accommodation: either in a
large parrot aviary with a heated shelter of 10 yd J (9.10 m ) and access to
an external wire mesh enclosure 13 yd (11.83 m) in length. One corridor
gives access to the shelter and there is another on the outside; alternatively
we use a humid tropical house of 10 yd 3 (9.10 m 3 ^ without access to the
open air. The latter system seems best to avoid accidents, because where
there is access to the open air a bird can panic at the appearance of an owl
or rat and kill itself against the wire mesh. The nests we offer are of three
kinds: either a box with a wooden base or a mesh base, or a wicker basket
15 cm (6 in) in diameter and 5 cm (2 in) deep.
The baskets are usually chosen provided that they contain a few twigs
and are hidden in the foliage.
Song
Normally sparing in voice, the Cloven-feathered Dove becomes noisy in
courtship. In any case the song cannot be confused with that of any other
species.
The underlying theme of the male's song is a plaintive wavering sound,
something like a ship's siren heard through the fog, but it can be imitated
by the human voice with a disyllabic whoo-oo , of which the first syllable is
long, deep and vibrant and the second, short, much higher and decrescendo.
The first syllable lasts for two or three seconds and the other lor only a
fraction of a second. The musical phrase contains five themes (rarely four)
at intervals of five or six seconds. The repetition of this phrase of five
themes constitutes the song which may last for three to five minutes.
During the song the bird is normally perched in a resting position, the beak
is closed and only a slight rhythmic swelling of the throat is to be seen.
This normal song is especially heard in the morning and evening, but
i some birds perform it only rarely. At the time of courtship it is another
matter. Though the melody of the song is identical, its tone is much
deeper and its strength much greater, so that it can be heard at a distance
of 200 yd (182 m).
For a period of eight to ten days the male sings for sessions of half
an hour to an hour long, sometimes repeated during the day, sometimes

even at the beginning of the night.
The attitude of the bird is then surprising: clutching tightly to the
perch, it appears from the front to have the shape of the heart on a play-
ing card. The head is no longer visible, pressed right down on the breast
by a complete bending of the neck. The beak is in the area of the black
and white semicircles. Only a slight movement of expansion of the body
accompanies each theme of the song. During the first two or three days
the male appears to sing only for himself, sometimes at a considerable
distance from the female, who remains indifferent.
Towards the third or fourth day, she comes very close to the male and,
beside him on the same branch, makes rapid jerky movements. Almost
at once the male begins to move in the same way, but for the purpose of
choosing a nest. He inspects and explores all of the branches that are
available several times a day. Then he perches on the edge of the nest he
has chosen or on a neighbouring branch.
I have noticed a curious action for which I have at present no explana-
tion, but it is regular. For two or three days before the laying of the eggs
the male descends to the ground on several occasions and remains there
for quite a long time.
The association of the special courting song and the descent of the male
to the ground are two signs which confirm that the eggs are about to be
laid. The female then settles on the nest and the male's song ceases.
</bodyText>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.524282">
The Egg
Since Layard's paper in 1882, it has been thought that the clutch con-
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9937956875" page_id="58080298"  page_num="36" year="" vol="">
sisted of two eggs, in contrast to other species of Treronidae.
We can confirm that this is untrue, and in this case at least our extra-
ordinary pigeon conforms with the other members of its family in laying
only a single egg.
Indeed, before arriving at suitable accommodation and food for our
birds, we obtained about 30 eggs, all infertile or broken. In each case the
clutch consisted of a single egg which is white and very elongated, averag-
ing 36.5 x 25.5 mm in size and 12 g in weight.
Incubation
Incubation takes 21 days. During this period the female only leaves the
nest tor a few minutes three or four times a day to defecate and rapidly
consume a large quantity of food.
The male never takes part in the incubation, but keeps very close to
the nest to protect it while the female is away.
If the egg is infertile or damaged, a replacement is laid, generally within
three weeks, the shortest delay recorded being 10 days. If a young is

reared, the next egg is laid about two months after it becomes independent.
The Young
Twenty-one days after the egg is laid, the two halves of the shell are to
be found on the ground as far away as possible from the nest. The female
stays on the nest without feeding for the first 24 hours.
The newly-hatched chick is tiny and covered with silky white down. Its
&amp;apos; skin is greyish pink. The eyes, which are closed, open on the fifth day, and
are black. The feet are pink; the bill soft and bluish, swollen at the tip
which is black. Both eyes and feet appear at this stage abnormally large.
We were extremely surprised by the rapid growth of feathers. While the
chick is still very small, green wing and tail feathers appear. By the 13th
day it perches on the rim of the nest, completely covered with feathers,
except on the crown of the head, where they are sparse and downy, and in
the area of the sternum. The general colour of the body is already a
beautiful grass green, clearly separated from the abdomen which is mouse
grey. The under-tail coverts are already yellow.
The upper parts have a peculiar characteristic. Many of the green feath-
ers of the neck and back are edged with yellow. Three continuous scal-
loped bars of beautiful golden yellow extend across the back at the places
where the silver bars will later appear. Similarly green feathers edged with
yellow are, in fact, found in small numbers on the back of the thighs of
the adult.
On the 14th day the young bird leaves the nest, but flies badly, hence
the importance of the protective mesh below the nest.
On the 21st day the young bird flies off, with vigour and confidence
and does not return to the nest. It does not produce in flight the charac-
teristic whistling of its parents. The swollen appearance of the forehead is
already visible as well as the white stripe on the throat. Its size is about
half that of the female. It does not feed itself until the 25th day, but the
mother continues to feed it until the end of the fifth week. The male takes
no part in feeding the young. The female, after feeding herself, perches
on the rim of the nest while the young cheeps softly. It puts its beak into
.its mother's beak to make her regurgitate. The young flutters its wings
while the mother spreads hers, letting them droop at the moment of
regurgitation.
Though the male does not seem to take any part in rearing the young,
it is clear that he takes an interest in everything and that his role is
essentially that of guardian. He stays continually in the neighbourhood of
the nest and follows the young at a distance of a few feet when it begins
to move about in the branches. At such a time the normally timid male
is not likely to retreat when the door of the aviary is opened, but to spread

his wings in a threatening attitude while emitting a muffled monosyllabic
whoo.
The female, when disturbed, can make a sound of the same kind, scarcely
audible beyond a distance of four or five yards.
Unfortunately this idyllic period does not last, and without warning the
protective father can brutally attack his young and kill it in a few minutes.
For this reason, we remove the young pigeon on the 21st day and keep
it in a small cage to be fed by hand. When it is able to feed itself on the
25th day, we move it to a cage 2 yd (1.83 m) long where it can fly. Birds
reared in this way are calm and trusting.
From the third month the sexes are distinguishable by the appearance
in the male of the golden yellow under-tail coverts and the first appearance
of the two semicircles on the breast. They begin to appear near the wings
and extend gradually inwards to join at the centre of the body. At three
and a half months, the female attains her final size, while the male con-
tinues to grow until six months.
At nine months the silver dust seems to settle gradually on the wings.
At one year the male assumes his complete adult plumage with the
unique branching of the tips of the primaries; at the same age these appear
also in the female.
The Moult
The moulting of the Cloven-feathered Dove is something of a mystery.
There is no post-juvenile moult. The feathers gradually change their tex-
ture and colour without being shed.
In the adult, we have noticed a more marked shedding of feathers in
June and July. For the remainder of the year we find, from time to time,
a single feather on the ground, so that the sexual activity of these birds is
uninterrupted and makes possible three broods in one year.

Young reared in captivity are as brilliant in plumage and as robust as
their parents. Some males are even larger.
At the time of writing, we have established second generation pairs
which are perfectly compatible, and one of the males has begun a court-
ing song.
Among accidents suffered by the young, we have had a dislocation of
the hips, complicated later by a nodular arthritis involving salmonella. We
believe this was because the base of the nest was too smooth. One chick
was crushed on the fourth day by the mother panicking when the door of
the aviary was roughly thrown open. It is, therefore, essential to warn the
birds before opening the aviary. A third bird was lost through our mistake
in leaving it in the cage too long before releasing it into the aviary.

Although this wonderful species is completely protected in New Cale-
donia, it is under a serious threat of extinction.
Its principal enemy is still man, who stupidly kills this remarkable bird
for the sake of a few ounces of meat.
It is also the victim of animal predators such as the Sparrow Hawk
Accipiter haplochrous and rats and feral cats. Forest Fires, which are often
extensive and beyond control, destroy nests and young. Finally, the pro-
gressive felling of the forests aggravates a situation that does not encourage
optimism. To deal with these threats, there have arisen two opposing atti-
tudes among conservationists on the island. Some pig-headed conserva-
tionists vigorously oppose any taking of birds from the wild, mainly on the
grounds that there is no hope of breeding this species in captivity. In fact,
so far as we know, not a single Drepanoptila has ever been reared in cap-
tivity in New Caledonia. Fortunately there are a small number of more
enlightened people who understand that the only real chances of survival
for this species lie in serious study of the bird in captivity leading to
attempts at breeding.
Special acknowledgement is due to the heads of the Department of
Water and Forests, led by Monsieur Cherrier, and the Noumea Forest Park,
which has been developed by the efforts of Monsieur J. Begaud, an en-
lightened aviculturist, and Monsieur H. Bregulla. These gentlemen have
untiringly resisted the fierce attacks of their opponents and carried on
their work amid difficulties only matched by their selfless determination.
Thanks to their efforts a limited programme of taking birds from the
wild has been carried out under proper controls. I have had the honour of
benefitting from this, thanks to the quality of my establishment and my
long experience in aviculture, and so the Government of New Caledonia
entrusted to my care a group of birds, officially and without charge.
During the course of my life I have reared many rare or difficult species of
birds, but a very few of my successes have given me as much satisfaction
as that of contributing towards the survival of the Cloven-feathered Dove.
I hope that my great friend, Dr. Jean Delacour, the President of the Avi-
cultural Society, will allow me to dedicate to him this successful breeaing
programme as a token of my affectionate regard.
However, the achievement is not Final and continual efforts must be
made. There is always the possibility that the 14 birds so far reared could
suffer an accident which would put the whole scheme in jeopardy. Yet we
have gained valuable new experience, and above all have proved that the
Cloven-feathered Dove can be reared in captivity, even in our climate. This
encourages a hope for the future of this wonderful bird.

Postscript
Unfortunately the Cloven-feathered Dove is not the only threatened
bird in New Caledonia, and I have been occupied for several years in the
breeding of other species in danger of extinction which belong to this
zoologically isolated island.
I have reared another pigeon, very beautiful and imposing as well as
interesting for being endemic and never bred in captivity in New Cale-
donia. It has been gradually decimated by intensive hunting. The White-
throated Pigeon Columba vitiensis hypoenochroa is a seedeater. It lays
only one egg, like Drepanoptila , but frequently lays on the ground. On the
other hand, both parents share equally in the incubation and rearing of the
young, which is pure black, speckled with abundant gold down. We intend
to publish our observations in due course, showing that this species also
can be saved by aviculture.
The Horned Parrot Eunymphicus c. cornutus is a magnificent bird with
a supple crest 2 in (5 cm) long, formed by two spatulate feathers of vermi-
lion red. Its young, sometimes reared in burrows in the ground, are insecti-
vorous during the first two weeks of their life, and have on the head a re-
markable round white spot, which disappears by the end of the third week.
A related form, even rarer, inhabits the island ofOuveain the Loyalty
Island group. This very beautiful and extremely rare Ouvea Parrot E.c
uvaensis has a crown composed of six rigid green feathers curved forward.
I published a detailed account of the breeding of these birds in the Avi-
cultural Magazine (1980). It brought me some violent reproaches, when I
was naive enough to expect only encouragement.
It is only by constant efforts that we can reach success in these ven-
tures, which only recently would have appeared impossible. Threatened
species are as precious as the ancient manuscripts and historical monu-
ments left by our ancestors. We are their trustees for future generations
and for this it is well worth making sacrifices.

GENETIC AND DEMOGRAPHIC MANAGEMENT OF
CAPTIVE RED-CROWNED CRANES Grus japonensis
By SCOTT SWENGEL

(Aviculturist, International Crane Foundation, Baraboo, Wisconsin, USA)
The Red-crowned (Manchurian) Crane is an endangered species that has
only become well established in captivity within the last decade. The wild
population is approximately 1,000, consisting of: 350 on Hokkaido, Japan
(von Treuenfels, 1984), roughly 500 breeding in north-eastern China (Yi-
ching and Long-rong, in press), and about 200 breeding in the eastern
USSR (Shibaev, 1982). Both the USSR and China have established nature
preserves within the Red-crowned Crane's breeding range, so we can begin
to consider restocking the mainland Asia population if it continues to dec-
line. Maintaining a genetically diverse captive population is, therefore, an
important part of the conservation programme for this beautiful bird.
Although the Red-crowned Crane has a long history in captivity, few
zoos had consistently bred it until the late 1970s. The establishment of
the Red-crowned Crane Studbook by Dr. Shigeharu Asakura of the Tokyo
Ueno Zoo in 1973 created an increased awareness of the need to breed this
species.

Prior to 1975 deaths among captive Red-crowned Cranes exceeded the
number bred, so wild birds were continually needed to keep the popula-
tion stable. The captive population began to increase in 1975 due to
improved breeding success, and it has grown in every year since then
(Table 1). Excluding emigrations to, and immigrations from, the popula-
tion, the number of captive Red-crowned Cranes grows annually by about
7.5%.
There are approximately 120 registered Red-crowned Cranes in cap-
tivity, but a number of zoos have not registered their birds. The total
captive population is probably about 160.

Although the Red-crowned Crane is increasing its number in captivity,
the population is plagued by a low genetic diversity. Most of the chicks
hatched during the last 15 years were produced by only three males and
four females. This swamping of the gene pool by a few individuals has
caused the effective population size to be less than one-half that of a
similar population where the offspring are distributed randomly among
the breeding pairs (Swengel, in press). The optimal distribution of off-
spring is one in which each pair has the same number of progeny.
Only half of the 55-60 genetically unrelated lines of Red-crowned
Cranes in captivity have bred. If zoos were to co-operate and breed each
pair equally, by allowing them to have only three to four offspring, the
genetic diversity within the population would increase dramatically.
The disproportionate number of progeny produced by a few pairs
has also made inbreeding more difficult to avoid. Most breeding centres
have only one breeding pair, so all the offspring produced at these sites
will be inter-related. In order to avoid inbreeding, these zoos must trans-
fer some of their captive-bred birds to other places and/or acquire mates
for those that remain.
The International Crane Foundation (ICF) has sent six Red-crowned
Cranes to Walsrode Bird Park, Germany, three to Tokyo Zoo, Japan,
and one to San Diego Zoo, USA, during the past two years because the
birds were all related. These zoos are locating unrelated mates for the
cranes they have received. Several other breeding centres have made
exchanges of Red-crowned Cranes in recent years.
Inbreeding probably decreases the fertility and hatchability rates of
Red-crowned Crane eggs. Inbreeding does not inherently lower the gene-
tic variability within a population. However, inbreeding does decrease
the genetic diversity in a population when it slows the population's
growth rate, as it appears to do in Red-crowned Cranes. For this reason,
Red-crowned Cranes should not be inbred. I have proposed a mating

scheme that minimises inbreeding in captive Red-crowned Cranes
(Swengel, in press).
Table 2 shows that, over the period 1976-1981, the fertility and
hatchability rates of inbred matings were much lower than those of
non-inbred matings. These data are not statistically significant because of
the small sample of fertile eggs from inbred matings (Oliver Ryder, pers.
comm.), but they show that, during the period sampled, non-inbred
matings produced one hatch per 3.0 eggs while inbred matings produced
only one hatch per 9.0 eggs.
The latest Studbook for Red-crowned Cranes (Asakura and Ito, 1983)
shows that five of the 17 pairs that had eggs were inbreeding and that
nine of the approximately 30 pairs in captivity are composed of related
birds.
Since several pairs of Red-crowned Cranes have already produced
eight to 30 offspring, the future breeding of their progeny needs to be
limited. In this way we could limit the number of descendants of these
overproductive pairs so that the pairs with few offspring could even-
tually equal them in reproductive success. The breeding centres should
concentrate on breeding those genetic lines that are under-represented
in the population. The variation in the number of offspring among the
pairs has a large effect on the genetic diversity of populations (Dennis-
ton, 1977).

Several endangered species, such as the Siberian Tiger, have captive
populations that exceed the space that zoos are either able or willing
to allot to these species. This will soon be true for the Red-crowned
Crane unless we agree on a demographic plan for this species. A demo-
graphic plan prescribes a desired age and/or sex distribution for a popu-
lation and strives to maintain an optimum population size.
Before captive Red-crowned Cranes exceed their optimum popula-
tion, or K, the Carrying Capacity, we need to solve the population's
genetic problems. Otherwise, needless effort will be expended to pro-
. duce chicks that are genetic liabilities to the population. We can accom-
plish this by slowing the population's growth long before it reaches K.
Genetically expendable birds could be used for display at zoos that do
not breed Red-crowned Cranes.
In captivity, a newly hatched Red-crowned Crane chick has a 70%
chance of surviving one year and a one year-old crane has a 91.5% chance
of living to age two. After that, the annual survivorship rate is nearly
constant at about 95% (Fig. 1). Such high survivorship allows the cap-
tive population to grow despite its low reproductive rate.

An annual reproductive rate of only 8.54 chicks hatched per 100
adults (four or more years old) is enough to maintain a constant pop-
ulation for captive Red-crowned Cranes when the age structure of the
population is stable. The growing captive population has an annual
reproductive rate of 31 chicks per 100 adults. The population also has
an expanding age structure, with many individuals in the youngest age
classes and relatively few in the older ones (Fig. 2).
Fig. 2 compares the age structure of captive Red-crowned Cranes to
those of three hypothetical populations: 1. a stable age distribution -
one whose age structure remains unchanged from year to year as long
as the population does not change; 2. the projected age distribution of
the present population 15 years from now; and 3. the age distribution
of the population in 15 years if its productivity were stabilised to 8.54
chicks per 100 adults per year.
If the present population were adjusted to 100 individuals, its
population would rise to 374 in 15 years and it would still have an ex-
panding age structure (many young individuals). If the population were
limited to an annual productivity of 8.54 chicks per 100 adults, the
population and age structure would become stable within about 15
years. This population numbers 104 and its age distribution is nearly
stable (Fig. 2).
The survivorship data show that, to maintain a constant population
size, pairs must average 3.4 offspring during their lifetimes. The op-
timum number of chicks per pair is, therefore, three to four.
Summary
The Red-crowned Crane is an endangered species that has only re-
cently begun to breed well in captivity. The captive population grows
7.5% per year and numbers about 160. The genetic diversity of the pop-
ulation is severely depressed because a very few breeders have produced
most of the offspring. This has also made inbreeding more difficult to
avoid. The genetic diversity could be greatly increased by concentrating
on breeding the genetic lines that are under-represented in captivity and
by limiting the productivity of the offspring of the most prolific breeders.
A demographic plan would benefit captive Red-crowned Cranes by
stabilising the population at its optimum level. Its high survivorship
enables this species to maintain a stable population with an annual re-
productive rate of only 8.54 chicks per 100 adults. This rate would sta-
bilise the currently growing population, and its age structure, in about
15 years. The population may soon exceed the space allotted to it if we
do not limit its growth rate. In a stable population, pairs of captive Red-

By I.J. BRYANT
(Wildlife Officer)
The National Wildlife Centre (as we are now known) is a government
funded institution established in 1962 and operated by the New Zealand
Wildlife Service with the prime objective of holding and breeding in cap-
tivity endangered species of native birds. The ultimate aim of this opera-
tion is to provide birds to boost dwindling wild populations or for estab-
lishing new wild populations in other areas. For some species these goals
are unattainable and it is far more effective to rely on other conservation
methods, i.e. transfers from island to island, as with the Saddleback Phile-
sturnus carunculatus and the Stitchbird Notiomystis cincta, or egg transfer
and cross fostering within an existing population, as with the Chatham
Island Black Robin Petroica traversi.
In addition to its conservation role, the centre also provides for wildlife
research and education. In recent years the centre's responsibilities have
been extended to include native reptiles, bats and frogs.
The following species of threatened or endangered native birds are
either currently held or have been held in the past at the National Wildlife
Centre.

LITTLE SPOTTED KIWI Apteryx oweni
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999306285714286" page_id="58080310"  page_num="48" year="" vol="">
Status: None currently held here although birds were at the centre
until 1979.
Suitability: As with all species of kiwi, these birds adapt well to cap-
tivity and have been successfully bred.
Potential: Good, although in the short term translocation of wild-
caught birds appears to be the best conservation option.
Formerly widespread in both the North and South Islands, the Little
Spotted Kiwi was, until recently, thought to be confined to the west coast
of the South Island and to Kapiti Island where a small number of birds was
released around 1900. However, recent surveys have shown that the Kapiti
Island population of around 500-600 birds may be all that remains. Why
this species should have disappeared from the mainland (where other spe-
cies of kiwi remain) and yet has flourished on Kapiti Island is uncertain
although it is possibly because of the bird's small size and inability to cope

Status: Four males and one female are currently held.

Potential: Very good although not a priority species.
Still fairly common (although localised) in the North Island, this sub-
species of Brown Kiwi has had a chequered career. Although suffering
from the onslaught of introduced predators (Mustelids, pigs, etc.), drastic
habitat modification, and possum trapping, the Kiwi is now re-establishing
itself in some areas where predator numbers have been reduced as well as
colonising rough farm land and exotic pine forests as opposed to the trad-
itional habitat of native bush.

Potential: As for A a. mantelli
Fairly abundant in western and north-western areas of the South
Island, this species does not seem to have suffered greatly from human
settlement of New Zealand and, in fact, appears to be extending its range.
BROWN TEAL Anas aucklandica chlorotis
jl
Status: Ten breeding pairs.
Suitability: As with most waterfowl, this species is well suited to cap-
tivity and breeds well. Up to 60 young birds are available for release
annually into suitable coastal lagoons.
Potential: Because this species breeds so well it can be classified as
'self-sustaining' in captivity.

country) numbers no more than 1500 and is confined mainly to Great

CAMPBELL ISLAND TEAL Anas aucklandica nesiotis
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999057904761905" page_id="58080312"  page_num="50" year="" vol="">
Status: Three males and one female are currently held.
Suitability: These birds were captured in 1984 and have settled in very
well. This small flightless form of brown teal should do as well as its larger,
more mobile cousin.
Potential: I can see no reason why this species should not breed as
freely as the Brown Teal.
Until recently only a dozen or so individuals had ever been seen and
only three specimens are known to be in museum collections (one col-
lected in 1886 and two in 1944).
Despite its name, there seem to be no records of this bird ever having
occurred on Campbell Island, although it is possible that they were ex-
terminated by an invasion of rats around 1810. The bird is known to
occur only on the nearby islet of Dent.
A 1975 estimate put the population of teal on this small island at
between 30 and 50 birds. A 1984 expedition to the island reported only
four positive sightings of birds and were unable to make an estimate of
the total population. The most alarming fact to come from this visit was
that several very recent landslides had occurred on the island affecting
what appear to be the principle habitats. Because of this, a special ex-
pedition was mounted in June 1984 to capture birds for a captive breed-
ing programme.

Status: Four adult pairs.
Suitability: As with the Campbell Island form, I can see no reason
why this species should not adapt well to captivity.
Potential: As for Campbell Island Teal.
Although apparently eliminated from Auckland Island itself (by
feral cats, pigs and rats), this small, flightless duck survives in stable,
although low, numbers on several surrounding islands (1974 estimate
1200-1500 birds). During the 1984 expedition to capture Campbell Island
Teal a number of this race were collected also for captive breeding pur-
poses.

Status: Fifteen males and ten females.
Suitability: Although taking longer than most waterfowl, this species
adapts well and thrives on a completely artificial diet. In the wild these
birds exist almost solely on the aquatic invertebrates which occur in swift
mountain streams. As it is not possible to duplicate this situation in cap-
tivity, the birds are weaned on to a pelleted food containing the same
basic nutrients.
Potential: Although problems have been experienced in the past, this
species is now breeding well in captivity.

the population at around 2000 birds. For a variety of reasons this species
is considered to be in a vulnerable position. As mentioned earlier, these
birds occur in fast flowing mountain streams and it is here that the prob-
lem lies. In some cases hydro-electric dams are slowing the flow of water
to the detriment of the aquatic insect life and in other areas land erosion
(brought on by forest clearance or grazing animals) deposits large quanti-
ties of silt with the same effect.
TAKAHE Notomis mantelli
Status: Two adult pairs and two birds of unknown sex.
Suitability: Adapts well to captivity and a supplementary artificial diet
although requiring large enclosures to provide adequate grazing area (ap-
proximately one hectare).
Potential: As a 'self-sustaining' captive population, the potential is
fairly good but as a species which could (by captive breeding) make a
significant contribution to the wild stock potential, it is very low. Only
five chicks have been successfully reared since the inception of the breed-
ing programme some 20 years ago.

About 120 Takahe still exist in the wild. In one particular study area
the population dropped from 50 birds to 12 between 1963 and 1980. Al-
though this appears to be a dramatic drop it is probable that the birds
have simply moved to other areas following a loss of winter habitat and
competition for food from Red Deer Cervus elaphus. Predation by Stoats
and Wekas Gallirallus australis is also an influencing factor.
Current conservation methods being used include aerial top dressing
with fertiliser to enrich poorer habitats, deer and predator control and
extending the range by relocating birds to other suitable areas, including
predator-free islands.

<bodyText confidence="0.997242642857143" page_id="58080315"  page_num="53" year="" vol="">
Status: None currently held but a further attempt to establish a
captive colony is to be made within the next year or so.
Suitability: Birds which have been kept here were reared from eggs
taken from the wild. They proved to be an adaptable, easy to cater for
species.
Potential: Probably very good, as other small plover species have
been bred outside New Zealand.
Having been exterminated on the mainland by introduced predators
in the 1880s, the Shore Plover is now restricted to South-east Island
in the Chatham group. The species is currently safe, but the accidental
introduction of any mammalian predator to the island could spell dis-
aster. This is why a captive breeding programme is to be established in
order that the offspring produced may be used to colonise other suit-
able islands.

BLACK STILT Himantopus novaezealandiae
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998269" page_id="58080315"  page_num="53" year="" vol="">
Status: Sixteen birds (eight adults and eight juveniles).
Suitability: Well suited to captivity provided the aviaries contain
; suitable habitat. The adult birds were hand-reared from eggs collected
:
from the wild in 1979/80 as this is preferable to capturing wild birds
which do not adjust well to confinement.
Potential: As a captive species their potential is excellent and al-
though only one pair have bred so far, I am confident that this is purely
a spatial problem which can be overcome. This one pair has already
contributed to the wild population by producing 11 eggs in the last
season for transfer to wild foster parents.

Less than 50 birds survive in the wild and although the numbers are
increasing slowly (due largely to egg manipulation within the wild popu-
lation) the birds still face the ever present threats of predation by feral
cats, ferrets and rats, and the loss of habitat through drainage operations
and hydro-electric developments.
This species hybridises with the Common Pied Stilt Himantopus
leucocephalus and it is these cross pairings or the hybrids they pro-
duce which are being used as foster parents either for the eggs from the
National Wildlife Centre or eggs rescued from nests under threat in the
wild.

Until recently the Kakapo was known to survive only in remote areas
of Fiordland, in the South Island, and all birds handled (about 20) have
been males. However, a major breakthrough was made in February 1977
when a colony was discovered in an isolated area of Stewart Island. In this
population of up to an estimated 30 birds, 11 have been confirmed as
females. As this colony is under constant pressure from feral cats, 21 birds
have so far been moved to predator-free Little Barrier Island.

ANTIPODES ISLAND PARRAKEET Cyanoramphus unicolor
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992634" page_id="58080317"  page_num="55" year="" vol="">
Status: One male and two females are held here although there are up
to 30 birds scattered around New Zealand in zoos and private collections.
Suitability: An extremely suitable captive species although some prob-
lems have been encountered when this long-isolated bird comes into con-
tact with mainland avian diseases to which it has no immunity.
Potential: As with other New Zealand parrakeets, this species breeds
freely and has become 'self-sustaining' in captivity.
This, the largest of the New Zealand parrakeets, inhabits the sub-Ant-
arctic Antipodes Island group where, at the moment, it is quite secure and
numbers several thousand. However, should the habitat be altered or
should predators become established, the chances of these ground-nesting
birds surviving are very slim. For this reason alone, captive populations
g
have been established as an insurance against extinction.

Cyanoramphus auriceps forbesi
Status: Three males (the only captive female died recently).
Suitability: Although generally well suited to captivity, this species
has proved difficult to breed. This is mainly due to the fact that the
birds are poor parents and foster parents (if available) must be used. A
further problem with this species is the birds' extreme nervousness when
nesting. They will not tolerate disturbance of any kind and will readily
destroy their eggs. Even feeding the birds while they are nesting can have
a disturbing effect.
Potential: Probably fairly good provided more stock can be obtained
and foster parents are available at the appropriate time.
This large subspecies of the mainland Yellow-crowned Parrakeet
occurs only on two small islands in the Chatham group. Although cur-
rently secure, this species faces the same problems confronting the birds
of the Antipodes Islands.
STICHBIRD Notiomystis cincta
Status: Three juvenile pairs of Stitchbirds were received in April this
year. This species has been bred here previously.
Suitability:Appears well suited to captivity although the birds show
a preference for large, well planted aviaries.
Potential: Stitchbirds probably present a reasonable potential as a
'self-sustaining' captive species although captive breeding is not a current
conservation strategy.
Until recently, Stitchbirds occurred only on Little Barrier Island having
been exterminated by introduced predators from the mainland by 1900.
Unfortunately this island sanctuary was (until 1981) overrun with feral
cats which we now know were having a drastic effect on the Stitchbird
population. Since these cats were exterminated by the Wildlife Service
the Stitchbirds have increased dramatically and birds are now being
translocated to other secure islands.

Once distributed over most of the North Island and many small off-
shore islands, the North Island Saddleback was known to survive on
)nly one small island when, in 1964, the Wildlife Service began a series
jpf experimental introductions to other suitable islands. These island
transfers have been most successful and the species now thrives in good
lumbers on at least ten islands.
The survival of this species seems assured and captive breeding as a
conservation measure is not really necessary.

Suitability: As for the North Island subspecies.
Potential: As for the North Island subspecies.
As with the North Island Saddleback, these birds cannot survive in
he presence of introduced rats Rattus norvegicus and R. rattus and
other mammalian predators. Because of this, they have been exter-
ninated from most of their original range and are now restricted to a

landful of small islands off New Zealand's south coast. Successful
sland transfers have been used to establish further populations.

Status: Three males and two females.

Potential: As Kokako are only a recent acquisition of the Centre
heir breeding potential is unknown although one pair was seen carry-
ag nest material around last summer.
Although originally found in forests throughout the island, it is prob-
ble that this species underwent a reduction in numbers before the im-
act of European settlement.
It now survives in a number of widely distributed pockets. The main
urrent threat to the survival of this species is the continual logging of

infortunately diminished in numbers dramatically in recent years.
I Of the three species, the Little Spotted Kiwi Apteryx owenii appears
;o have disappeared completely from the mainland. The final demise was
probably caused by the introduced mustelids. A chance liberation at the
:urn of the century has left a population of around 400 pairs on a small
sland off the coast and all these birds probably originated from just two
 |)airs.
The Large Spotted Kiwi A. haastii is still secure in the South Island but
Subjected to continued habitat destruction.
Of the Brown Kiwi A. australis , the Steward Island subspecies A.a.
awryi is plentiful within its limited range whereas the South Island sub-
i .pecies A.a. australis is at high risk with only 20 odd individuals having
)een sighted in recent years. The North Island subspecies A.a. mantelli
vas numerous until very recently but is now diminishing rapidly under a
! and development scheme whereby developers recover 45% of all costs of
ievelopment from the government. Therefore, what was formerly marginal
and has now become viable development under the new subsidy scheme,
o the detriment of kiwis and indeed other species.

B.E. ROWE - NEW ZEALAND KIWIS
The burrowing and nocturnal activities of kiwis have made study diffi-
cult, and much work remains to be done particularly in areas of popula-
tion dynamics and territory sizes. Despite the fact that the kiwi is the
national emblem, there is only one researcher working on the species.
The Otorohanga Zoological Society started work on the aviculture of
the kiwi around 12 years ago. The keen senses of smell and hearing, fac-
tors not normally attributed to birds, caused a few early problems. The
birds tended to associate the smell of a regular keeper with feeding and
would frequently refuse to eat if another keeper handled their food. The
current diet, which has been developed over the years, consists of (per
adult bird):
Sliced ox-heart 200 gms
Cooked rolled oats 180 gms
Soya bean oil 2.5 gms
Wheat germ flakes 2 gms
T.V.L. special premix No. 178 2 gms
The ox-hearts are trimmed of most of the fat and hard material and
sliced into 'Julienne' strips of about 5 cm long. The premix, wheat germ,
and oil are mixed with the meat, and the rolled oats, which have been
previously cooked and cooled, are stirred in. The rolled oats are cooked
to produce a heavy viscous solution which is used to prevent the meat
from drying out and also provides vegetable matter in the diet.
In the wild, a wide variety of insects and worms is eaten, along with
various berries and seeds. The stomach contents of one bird even pro-
duced a freshwater crayfish.
Wild birds handed in are offered only the artificial diet and although
no bird has yet refused to eat it to the point of death by starvation, the
specimen that refused to eat for 43 days must have got very close to it.
This particular bird returned to reception weight within three weeks.
As kiwis are territorial and can be extremely aggressive in the breeding
season, it has been the practice to keep only one pair in an enclosure.
Space is not a limiting factor at Otorohanga, so outside breeding enclo-
sures are around 250 m 2 each in area. An enclosure of this dimension
ensures an element of natural foraging and shows no sign of fouling.
Burrowing activity seems confined to nesting so perimeter fencing is
taken only half a metre below ground level. To prevent bill damage
through wire, solid fencing is taken up to a metre high and a further
metre is added with wire and electrified outriggers to prevent access by
predators.
The nocturnal enclosures are also large at 60 m , whereas 30 m z would

be quite adequate. A well drained base of rich loam and leaf litter is pro-
vided and kept damp at all times to prevent lung infections which can
occur with inhalation of dust. Good ventilation is essential to avoid fungus
growth. Temperatures above 20*C tend to cause lethargy in kiwis.
Burrows are provided for the birds in outside and nocturnal enclosures.
These consist of a tunnel 70 cm long and 19 cm^, linking on to a box 24 x
35 x 29 cm high. These measurements can be varied slightly but happen to
coincide with standard timber sizes.
Kiwis breed at two to four years old and require up to six months to
settle into a new enclosure as a pair, before breeding. Eggs can be laid any
month of the year but peak production is midwinter to early spring. One
to three eggs are laid, the usual clutch being two. These are produced at
around 21-day intervals with incubation commencing after development
of the extensive brood patch - about a week after the first egg is laid. Egg
weight represents approximately 20% of the hen's weight and the X-Ray
photograph shown here graphically demonstrates the space occupied by
the egg inside the hen.
The incubation period is 71-80 days. The air cell lies eccentric at the
large end of the egg and must lie uppermost throughout incubation. The
egg is not turned at all during incubation.
Telemetry methods used at Otorohanga gave incubation temperatures
of 36*C at the top of the egg and 26*C on the bottom. Currently incu-
bation is done in still-air incubators where temperature layering approxi-
mates actual determined gradients. Forced draught or even temperature
development has not been attempted at this stage.
Kiwi chicks lack an egg tooth and first break the shell with a single
puncture at the air cell end. High humidities are required from this point
to prevent the extremely tough shell membrane from drying out and
hardening. One to two days later, pressure is exerted using the already
massive feet and the end of the shell (which is somewhat thinner) breaks
open to release the chick.
The chick is fully feathered at hatching but unable to stand and the
legs strengthen over several days. Chicks are kept in the incubator for six
days, on rough surface towelling to prevent splayed legs. On the seventh
day they are placed in a brooder where, on the seventh and eighth night
they venture out and eat pieces of twig and small stone to prepare the
crop for food. Feeding proper starts on the ninth night. Handling during
the first few weeks, if not done with extreme care, is generally fatal. The
brooders used have a darkened controlled heat area with an access to a
dirt-filled run approximately 1 m x 1.5 m long. The adult food mix is
offered from the start although the meat is sliced a little thinner. No chick
has yet refused food. The chicks do not actively imprint and can be reared

in isolation. They dislike being stroked or handled.
Several escapees have proved that captive-reared kiwis are quite capable
of survival in the wild.
Financial constraints limit aviculture as a means of building up or re-
introducing this species into the wild. The costs of maintaining enough
pairs for breeding and rearing large quantities of chicks to six months, old
enough for liberation, are prohibitive when all feeding and housing costs
are considered. The survival of this species in New Zealand will depend on
active habitat preservation which currently is sadly lacking.

DECLINE OF THE GREATER PATAGONIAN CONURE

The decline of the Greater Patagonian Conure is well known, yet it was
not until recently that its truly precarious status was reported. Jurgen
Rohmann was quoted in Chile Forestal (August, 1982) to the effect that
total aggregates are 1,000. This alarming decrease can be imputed to the
removal of young by local people for pets or food. Although protected,
the law is apparently not enforced - a most disconcerting case for unless
stringent measures are taken, its existence in the next century will only be
in text books and possibly confinement.
This parrot is rare in aviculture, although it is held by collections in
England, Italy and Chile. Breeding successes have been reported in these
three countries. The total number of young produced is very small, so
better management of the birds is pertinent; pairs must be used to their
full capacity so that as many young as possible can be reared.
Up until the present time, no serious breeding scheme was in operation
in Chile but this is chancing, for Guillermo Moreno of Chilian has plans
that call for the establishment of a breeding centre for this and other
endangered species.
Colony breeding, which is usually the rule with the nominate subspecies
patagonus , is not to be recommended for this subspecies, which is much
more aggressive. Therefore, only a single pair should be kept in an aviary.
Trading between the collections that have specimens and the inception
of a Studbook should be given priority. If captive birds are properly
managed and young dispersed to other collections with the goal of estab-
lishing pairs, there is no reason why the Greater Patagonian Conure cannot
become established in captivity.

Assessing the status of any species of bird in captivity without a general
census is most difficult. I shall give a broad opinion, based on my observa-
tions and the general trends that occur from time to time with bird species
held in captivity in Australia, with additional information from South Aus-
tralia. Individual state fauna laws have played quite a significant role in the
keeping of at least two of the species under discussion .
The species to be described in this paper are the Golden-shouldered
Parrot Psephotus chrysopterygius , the Hooded Parrot P. dissimilis, the
Turquoise Parrot Neophema pulchella, and the Scarlet-chested Parrot
N. splendida.
Their captive status in Australia will be described as follows: increasing-
ly productive populations; steadily increasing rather than decreasing; quite
plentiful without being abundant; and moderately common. These classifi-
cations are based on the overall bird collections held by aviculturists in
Australia and bearing in mind the greatly increased interest in Psittaci-
formes during the past 15 years. The improved husbandry in aviculture in
Australia has minimised many of the problems that were experienced by
bird keepers several decades ago and the accumulated knowledge and ex-
perience available today should ensure the future of these four species in
Australian aviculture.
If a general understanding and good working liaison is adopted between
the various government fauna bodies and the various avicultural societies,
the future of our rare birds will be preserved. Although published records
of the world status of birds held for avicultural purposes is either sketchy
or unavailable, the Red Data Book, compiled by the International Union
for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, provides statistics on
the status of threatened species throughout their world range. This should
not be confused with birds held in captivity as there are many species
listed as rare in the wild that are quite common in aviculture. I have often
thought how interesting and exciting it would be to have a general census
held, say, every three years, of all birds kept in captivity so as to draw
comparisons with the status of wild populations.

History and status in captivity in Australia
To trace the introduction of the Golden-shouldered Parrot into Austra-
lian aviculture, we must turn the clock back to 1922. According to Alan
Lendon (1960), a collector called McLennan obtained and hand-reared
some young birds, of which ten were presented to Taronga Park Zoo in
Sydney. No breeding reports were recorded for these birds and they
lived on for several years.
There appears to be no further record of Golden--shouldered Parrots
being obtained for aviculture in Australia until 1952 when Sir Edward
Hallstrom acquired two adult males, one of which he mated to a female
Hooded Parrot. After two expeditions to Cape York Peninsula in 1955.
his collection of Golden-shouldered Parrots had increased to about 20
birds (Lendon, 1960). With these additional birds, Sir Edward was able
to select pairs and by 1956 he was breeding pure-bred young.
When Alan Lendon visited Sir Edward Hallstrom in August 1959, his
flock had grown to about 40 birds. It was during this visit that Sir Edward
offered Lendon a pair that had been bred in 1958. Alan Lendon brought
the young Golden--shouldered Parrots back to his aviaries in Adelaide
and early in 1960 the late Fred Lewitzka and I were invited to view them.
Both birds were in full adult plumage and excellent condition. In mid-
September the same year the pair were nesting and four eggs were laid,
three young were seen on 12th October, but unfortunately all were dead
a week later. The birds were housed in an aviary measuring 6 x 3 x 6 ft
(1.83 x 0.92 x 1.83m) with a shelter section at the rear measuring
3 x 3 x 714ft (0.92 x 0.92 x 2.29m). The Golden-shouldered Parrots were
the sole occupants of the aviary. A nest-box was placed in the shelter
section 6 ft from the ground; the inside measurements of the box were
10 x 6 x 6in (0.25 x 0.15 x 0.15m) with a spout entrance 4in (0.10m)
long and 2 x 2in (0.05 x 0.05m) inside. Decayed wood dirt was placed
in the bottom of the box. In August 1961 breeding was in progress again
and the first egg was laid on the 29th, followed by four others on alter-
nate days. By 24th September all five eggs had hatched and the first
young left the nesting box on 25th October. Approximately 14 days
later the birds were independent. By November the following year (1962)
the young were fully coloured and were all males.
The Avicultural Society of South Australia awarded their bronze
medal to Alan Lendon for the first official breeding of this species in
captivity in South Australia.
By this time the well-known aviculturist Joseph Mattinson, of New
South Wales, had become very interested in the Golden-shouldered Parrot

and during a journey to Cairns, Queensland, in 1960 he spoke to an offi-
cial in the Department of Agriculture regarding the birds and was assured
of a permit if he could obtain any. Eventually he was successful and
secured four males and one female (Mattinson, 1975).
Those five birds became the nucleus of Joseph Mattinson's stock and
in his article (1975) he wrote: "We have 20 pairs of Golden-shoulders, not
all of which are of course in breeding condition and this year raised about
60. There is still a significant deathrate in Golden-shoulders and we should
be raising well over a hundred each year but are limited to the number
which we can hand-rear as this is very time consuming".
During the breeding season of 1974 I observed the Golden-shouldered
Parrots in Joseph Mattinson's collection and was amazed at the young
birds being reared, clutches of four and five being quite common.
From the stock of both these aviculturists it was not long before Gol-
den-shouldered Parrots appeared in collections around Australia. This is
one of a number of species included on the eighth schedule (Rare Species)
of the South Australian National Parks and Wildlife Act, 1972-74.
Under Section 51(a) of the Act, in part, in order to have such animals
in your possession it is necessary to have a Rare Species permit (Section
55). This Section provides for the Minister for the Environment to grant
such a permit where he is satisfied that:
a) It is in the interests of scientific research, or
b) It is desirable for the sake of conserving animals of a rare species to
do so.
By June 1975 there were eight people in South Australia keeping 37
? Golden-shouldered Parrots in captivity. All were held under permit with
the expiry date 30th June 1975. After that date it was necessary for re-
newal of their permit.
By now Golden-shouldered Parrots were increasing in captivity in all
states of Australia. It was during that time that the Queensland Parlia-
ment passed legislation affording stringent protection to the Golden-
shouldered Parrot in the wild, their reason being that numbers in the wild
appeared to be decreasing and the possibility of birds being smuggled out
of Australia was a further threat so that every effort was needed to pro-
tect the species.
The original idea was that all Golden-shouldered Parrots that were
held in captivity in Queensland should be forfeited to the government for
scientific research, if suitable facilities to house them could be found.
Naturally unrest was evident among aviculturists throughout Australia
when they were advised of this plan. Ministers of Conservation in each
State and Territory became involved and by then the numbers of birds
held by aviculturists in Australia were fast increasing.

Although the authorities held discussions no uniform decision could
be agreed upon and, therefore, it was left to each State to formulate its
own regulations. Up until that time (1975) Golden-shouldered Parrots
were purchased within and from most States in Australia. As mentioned,
breeding results were greatly improving.
From 1st July 1975, persons with Golden-shouldered Parrots in South
Australia were not permitted to dispose of their birds to other avicul-
turists within that State. Permits would be issued to send Golden-shoul-
dered Parrots to other States if permission was granted from their autho-
rities. Although there was an outcry from South Australian aviculturists,
a number of breeders eventually disposed of their birds interstate and by
1980 three persons still held a total of approximately 16 birds in their
collections.
During the breeding season of 1980, one of these aviculturists decided
to make a concerted effort with the birds still in his possession as he was
very worried by the decline of this rare species within South Australia. He
reared 19 young to independence. It is pleasing to note that in New South
Wales and Victoria there was a steady increase in breeding from 1975 to
1980 and in 1984 permits were once again being issued in South Australia.
It is to be hoped that, through the experience gained during the past 20
years, in a short time this very rare and beautiful species will increase its
status in aviaries throughout Australia.

During the early 1840s the celebrated ornithologist John Gilbert was
exploring an area north-east of Darwin, near Port Essington, which is loca-
ted on the Coburg Peninsula and apparently he failed to record the Hooded
Parrot. In 1845 the Leichhardt expedition passed through the country
now inhabited by the species with no sightings recorded, and in 1846
Elsey, a collector with the Gregory expedition, failed to record the parrot
while passing through what is now known to be the heart of the Hooded
Parrot's range.
In 1863, while travelling northwards from Newcastle Waters, Stuart's
expedition also appears to have missed sighting the Hooded Parrot. It was
not until 1894, during a collecting expedition by Professor Knut Dahl in
tropical northern Australia, that specimens of the Hooded Parrot were
taken near the Mary River in the Northern Territory (Barrett, 1949).
These specimens were sent to Norway (incredible as that may seem!)
and were described by Collet in 1898 (Condon, 1975).
From those findings it would appear that the Hooded Parrot was not
abundant at the time of European settlement and it is quite possible that
their numbers have actually increased in the wild since those early times.
Their appearance in captivity in South Australia occurred in the late
1920s. W. Hamilton was the first aviculturist to be recorded officially as
having bred them, in 1930 and subsequently he was awarded the Avic-
ultural Society of South Australia's Bronze Medal for his achievement.
The Hooded Parrot has, for many years, been subjected to numerous
rumours regarding possible stringent fauna regulations regarding captive
birds in Australia. These possible threats have left an uneasy feeling among
*many aviculturists and the thought of perhaps, one day, a ban being placed
on the species in captivity has disuaded many breeders, both new and
experienced, from keeping more than one or two pairs. This has prevented
the development of the Hooded Parrot to its fullest potential.
The numbers in captivity in Australia should be far greater than they
are today (mid-1984). During the 1970s the total captive population in
South Australia was probably between 450 to 500. The approximate
numbers in captivity throughout the whole of Australia (1984) could be
in the vicinity of 2000.

It would surely be a sad day if stringent regulations were introduced
to prevent the Hooded Parrot from further development as a captive spe-
cies because the knowledge gained about the species during the past 50
years, plus the improved husbandry of today, can only enhance the
species' existence for generations to come.
In my opinion the Hooded Parrot is full of character and certainly one
of the more unique and distinct species of Australian avifauna.
It should also be remembered that the field studies of the Hooded
Parrot would not be able to compare with the captive studies that have
been carried out by aviculturists in Australia.
The Hooded Parrot is on the official list of Australian Endangered Birds
and while their numbers at present are not critical, either in the wild or
in captivity, every effort should be made for continuous, careful and
selective breeding by aviculturists, together with a close watch by wild-
life authorities on the natural habitat of the species.

The Turquoise Parrot was first described in 1792 by Shaw in The
Naturalist's Miscellany , Vol. 3, plate 96 (Condon, 1975). It is interesting
to read the early history of this species. Prior to 1900 the Turquoise Parrot
j; was quite common in areas of south-eastern Australia. John Gould (1865)
wrote, "All those who have traversed the 'bush' in New South Wales will
recognise in this lovely species an old favourite, for it must have often
come under their notice".
At the turn of this century a dramatic decline in the existence of the
species was noted. It would seem that the clearing of land, the expansion
of European settlement, severe drought conditions and possibly disease
were the major factors (Immelmann, 1968).
By 1917 many ornithologists feared that the Turquoise Parrot was
extinct. In 1973, in a most comprehensive article on this species, H.E.A.
Jarman wrote: "An old trapper informed G. A. He uman, of Sydney, (1927),
that the Turquoise Parrot had been the commonest parrot in his district
30 to 40 years previously. He would catch two or three dozen before
breakfast and sell them from 2/- to 2/6 per pair. Heuman ruefully com-
mented that he had recently paid 30 dollars for a male bird that was acci-
dentally netted with some finches".
Unfortunately we have no records of the success rate in captivity of
birds trapped in those early years. We can only surmise that at least a
percentage did survive. From 1920 onwards, sightings of the Turquoise
Parrot became more frequent with reports from New South Wales, Vic-
f toria and Queensland. In December 1926, Simon Harvey of Adelaide,
South Australia, bred four Turquoisine Parrots in captivity, and during
the breeding season of 1927, a young male from the first breeding of the
previous year (12 months old) fathered a nest of four, all were reared to
) maturity. Shortly after the Avicultural Society of South Australia was
founded in 1928, Simon Harvey submitted a breeding report for the first
official breeding of the Turqoise Parrot in South Australia and was duly
awarded the Society's bronze medal.
. It would seem that, from those first breedings, the Turqoise Parrot
would soon become abundant in aviaries but this was not the case.
i
During those early years of aviculture the keeping and breeding of finches
; far surpassed the number of parrots kept, and the few people keeping
Turquoise Parrots found that infertile eggs were common. Alan Lendon
(1973) relates his early experiences with the species and although a num-
ber of young were reared the problem of clear eggs was also encountered.
From about 1956 Turquoise Parrots became more popular with avicul-
turists and by 1976 most parrot collections throughout Australia housed

from one to ten pairs, or more. I would estimate their numbers in cap-
tivity in Australia today (1984) to be approximately 8000. Their numbers
in the wild have increased considerably and at this stage they are not a
threatened species. However, I would hasten to add that, although the
Turquoise Parrot appears to be safe at present, I believe that it is one
species that should never be neglected, either by aviculturists or orni-
thologists.

The Scarlet-chested Parrot was first described by John Gould in 1840
from a specimen that was sent to him with no information other than it
was a native of Swan River Western Australian. It was not until 1845 that
Gould received further specimens which were collected by Johnson Drum-
mond near Moore's River in Western Australia (Gould, 1972). Although
this species was observed on a number of occasions after that period, it
was not until 1914 that a sighting by the late Hermann B. Scholz was to
have a major effect in the development of the Scarlet-chested Parrot in
captivity in Australia.
In 1914 Hermann Scholz was working with a survey gang, which was
associated with the construction of the East-West Railway line, situated
near Lake Hart, in South Australia. It was near that location that Scholz
observed his first adult male Scarlet-chested Parrot. Although at that
time the bird was unfamiliar to him, its striking beauty remained in his
mind. Scholz saw the Scarlet-chested Parrot again in 1931, when a
female was rescued from a hawk on his farm at Yaninee on the west
coast of South Australia (Scholz, 1965). This was the beginning of a long
and dedicated era for a man and his love for one of Australia's rare parrots.
By 1937 Scholz had sufficient birds to start a line breeding programme.
He carefully selected the best of his young ones and eventually was breed-
ing from no less than 12 adult pairs. This pattern of breeding continued
until his death in the 1970s. During 1930, the late Simon Harvey, a prom-
inent aviculturist in South Australia, stayed with Hermann Scholz on his
property at Yaninee in the hope of finding the Scarlet-chested Parrot.
"Needless to say, we did not sight any" (Scholz, 1965). However, in 1932
several birds arrived in Adelaide and by June that year Simon Harvey had
in his possession the very beautiful Scarlet-chested Parrot.
Within ten months of living in an aviary, one pair showed an interest in
nesting, eventually rearing five young; another pair went to nest on 24th
August 1932, and five more young were reared. This breeding was record-
ed as the "first official breeding" in South Australia and Simon Harvey
was awarded the Avicultural Society of South Australia's bronze medal for
the first breeding and the silver medal for the most outstanding breeding of
the year.
In South Australia during 1972 the Fauna Conservation Act 1964-65
was repealed and replaced by the National Parks and Wildlife Act, 1972.
As the Scarlet-chested Parrot was a rare species in the wild, it was listed
on the Eighth Schedule (Rare Species) and certain restrictions were there-
fore imposted upon keeping the species in captivity. The new Act was not
received favourably by aviculturists, as a ten dollar annual permit fee was

required, plus a rare species record book giving details of breedings, sales
and deaths. Dealers were not permitted to trade with the species thereby
restricting the movement of surplus stock out of South Australia.
During that particular time (1972) there were approximately 2457
Scarlet-chested Parrots held by aviculturists in South Australia.
The legislation had a depressing effect on the overall status of the
Scarlet-chested Parrot throughout Australia and, owing to the build up
of surplus birds within South Australia, many breeders refrained from
placing nesting logs or boxes in their aviaries, and the situation became
serious. After discussions between prominent aviculturists and members
of Parliament (over a period of two years), the Scarlet-chested Parrot was
again allowed freedom of trade. On 31st February 1980, South Australian
aviculturists had in their possession 3558 Scarlet-chested Parrots and this
number at the time of writing (mid 1984) would be at least three fold
throughout the whole of Australia. Readers might infer from this article
that the Scarlet-chested Parrot is a common bird in captivity but I would
suggest that any species which has a captive population of 10,000 or less
is not common and we should ensure that we do not become complacent.

Conclusion:
In Australia the captive populations of the four parrots mentioned are
probably greater today than at any other time.
There is no potential risk at the moment of gene damage with any of
the four species. Many breeders have developed their own genetic families
and as long as this scientific approach is adopted, each generation that is
produced enhances the survival rate of each species. If a numerical ranking
system could be adopted, this would be beneficial in assessing the status of
birds in captivity; this in turn would monitor any declines, thus allowing
for concerted breeding efforts to eliminate the threat to the species' sur-
vival.

THE LAYSAN TEAL - RECENT HISTORY AND FUTURE?

have been called in recent monographs on waterfowl (Phillips, 1923;
Delacour, 1956, 1964), had not been kept in captivity by 1956, the time
of the appearance of Delacour's second volume of his major work dealing
with the waterfowl of the world. By the time of the final volume, however,
much had been learned of this remote, isolated island and its diminutive
duck. Laysan is a narrow islet of raised coral reef, scarcely three miles long
with a central, brackish pond that periodically varies in size, with dunes
reaching less than 40 ft above the sea and with little vegetation and sus-
tenance. The birds appear to be adapted to living on insect larvae of lepi-
doptera, flies and beetles with occasional brine shrimp in the brackish
pools. The island lies in the Leeward chain of old, eroded volcanic sea
mounts, some 485 miles WNW of Honolulu, Hawaiian Islands. In 1957, a
government census disclosed that the population of Teal, poorly surveyed
in previous years, had increased greatly to a presumed near-saturation
point of some 400-600 individuals. From my then post at Yale University,
I joined with others in writing to the U.S. Department of the Interior's
Sport, Fisheries and Wildlife Bureau to suggest that such an overpopula-
tion might produce a 'crash' in numbers, and that some capture and cap-
tive rearing might be attempted. This opinion fortunately coincided with
that of the Bureau and of the Hawaiian Board of Agriculture and Forestry,
and two sets of birds were caught, in 1957 eight duck, and in 1958, some
36. These birds were distributed among five zoological parks interested in
captive breeding, the Wildfowl Trust, and private collections including
Dr. Delacour's and mine in Litchfield, Connecticut. Young began to be
leared in Connecticut in 1959 and in a number of the major collections
successfully in following years and a stable, but small population has been
maintained ever since. Laysan Teal have been described in their natural
habitat as relatively tame, inclined to scuttle away from intruders into
the vegetation without flying (in truth they can fly but, like isolated, insu-
lai bird populations in general, seem to tend to avoid doing so), and to be
aggressive among themselves, keeping in small groups or pairs. The same
behaviour has been noted in captivity. First efforts at rearing them pro-
duced evidence of aggression, difficulty in getting young to feed and a
penchant lor live food. However, the resulting captive population now
seems easy enough to rear and to keep. Subsequently the status of Lay-

san Island has been extensively described and the remarkable fluctuation
in number of the Teal discussed. A comprehensive summary and recent
history and ecology of the Lay san Teal, including notes on the first cap-
ture of these birds in the late 1950s, was published by R.E. Warner (1961).
Berger (1981) published an historical account of the bird's existence on
Laysan, noting, as had Warner, the fluctuations in the island population
over the known years of record.
Until recently the lowest estimate of the population of Laysan Teal
was that of Bailey (1956), who estimated that when he visited in 1912,
only some seven individuals were extant. More recently still, a record pub-
lished by Ely and Clapp (1973, Table LT3), is perhaps the most striking
record of a species' survival ever alleged. It appears to be a fact that in
1930 a surviving pair existed on Laysan, of which the male and the then
existing nest were destroyed in a storm. The remaining female proved to
be gravid, laid again in a new nest, and produced living young! Survival
could be described as existing on a razor's edge.
The future of the Laysan Duck or Teal thus depends on two factors: a
responsible and conscientious effort to maintain captive stock in the face
of natural fluctuations on Laysan in recent years of between 400 and 600
individuals (King, 1977), and the constant danger of predator introduction
or natural disasters. This responsibility, however, presents an added prob-
lem as most aviculturists will admit. Who is to be responsible? The little
Laysan Duck is inconspicuous, "not pretty", as one might say. Most pub-
lic collections of waterfowl do not include it, and those among us avicul-
turists who care are subject to mortality, errors of judgment and natural
disasters, just as are the natural inhabitants of Laysan. Our U.S. Govern-
ment has no consistent policy in regard to aviculture at present, witness
the ups and downs of Pohakaloa in Hawaii, and some of the reserves on
the mainland where experimental programmes are carried on. In all con-
science, our Government should help bear such an international respon-
sibility.
Finally, why is the Laysan Teal (as I prefer to call it) so important?
I have written twice about the bird in this journal (1943, 1959), point-
ing out how interesting small island populations are. In 1960 I wrote
about the duck on Laysan and maintained that it should be considered an
endemic species, a monotypic one within the genus Anas for several
reasons which I might quote here again herewith, after giving measure-
ments and a drawing of the downy plumage (Ripley, 1960):
'The size of the eggs of the Laysan Teal, and the size of the ducklings
are both extraordinarily large in proportion to the adult birds which are
the size of teal. There is apparently an allometric rate of growth which
differs markedly from the Mallard, involving not only initial size of the

egg and young but also body proportions. There must be an adaptive
value for this isolated, reef-inhabiting duck in having an egg and duckling
at hatching age so large in proportion to the adult. In addition, the bill
size and shape suggest an adaptation to insectivorous diet.
'Delacour and Mayr (1945) have emphasized the conservative nature
and taxonomic value of downy plumages of waterfowl. On the basis of
the rather striking downy plumage differences, proportionate growth
differences, bill shape, small size and coarse plumage, I would be inclined
to keep Anas laysanensis as a monotypic species within the Mallard Anas
platyrhynchos superspecies. '
One additional point might be mentioned. In the 26 years that this
species has been kept at Litchfield, we have never had a hybrid between
this duck and other species, including the slightly larger Hawaiian Duck
Anas platyrhynchos wyvillliana. The latter is a difficult form to keep in
captivity, as unless isolated, it may hybridize with forms of the Mallard,
including a variety of species such as the Australian and Spot-billed Mal-
lards. Such an indication, as well as the rather aggressive nature of these
little creatures, would seem to indicate that on balance the Laysan Teal
prefers to be 'itself. Under the circumstances, I would be inclined to
respect that suggestion and treat the species in a similar manner.

In 1970 The Peregrine Fund, a private, non-profit-making organization
affiliated with Cornell University, undertook a long-term project to develop
and refine methods for the captive propagation of falcons. The ultimate
goal was to utilize captive-bred progeny to replace the extirpated Peregrine
Falco peregrinus population in the eastern United States, as well as to
augment the much reduced wild populations in western states (Cade,
1974).
Today (1984) the Peregrine Fund consists of breeding facilities located
at Ithaca, New York, Fort Collins in Colorado, and at the University of
California, Santa Cruz. In addition, construction has begun at Boise, Ida-
ho, for a new programme - The World Center for Birds of Prey.
Our Cornell breeding colony consists of peregrines obtained from di-
verse geographic sources - including birds from Arctic and boreal North
America, the Pacific Northwest, Scotland, Spain, Australia, South Ameri-
ca, as well as various crosses between individuals from the above popula-
tions.
The first young Peregrines were reared at our Cornell facility in 1973,
when four laying females produced 20 young. Table 1 illustrates our total
eastern production to date. Numbers produced have steadily increased
over the years, peaking in 1982. Our initial four laying females have been
increased to 24, and the 20 young produced in 1973 have risen to 93 in
1982. By 1983 the total production at our three research facilities since
our work started had reached 1011 Peregrine chicks.
While we are pleased with our accomplishments to date, we have en-
countered some problems that have prevented full realization of the
maximum reproductive potential of our adult females. The most serious
problem has been associated with the fertilization process. Currently we
are achieving an overall fertilization rate of nearly 60%, essentially the
same as in our early years.

This comparatively low rate, despite improved semen collecting and
inseminating techniques, can be attributed to: 1) decreased fertility in
many of our older breeding pairs; 2) a general deterioration in egg quali-
ty associated primarily with our older birds; and 3) allowing falcons
requiring artificial insemination to lay the first egg of a clutch before
initiating insemination, thereby losing the possibility of fertilizing the
first, and frequently the second, egg.
Inseminations were initially carried out by depositing semen from a
capillary tube approximately 5-10 mm into the cloaca of the female.
The results from this technique were poor, yielding fertility rates of
approximately 10%. Currently an insemination syringe is used to depo-
sit semen 25-50 mm directly into the manually everted oviduct. Ferti-
lization rates of nearly 75% are achieved using this technique (Weaver
and Cade, 1983).
An additional important consideration in the management of a
breeding facility is the availability of sufficient quantities of high quality
semen. Semen must be readily available to inseminate non-copulating,
as well as human-imprinted, laying females at the appropriate time.
Initially we employed the standard manipulative technique for obtain-
ing semen utilized by the poultry industry similar to that described by
Lake and Stewart (1978). We found, however, that in addition to the
considerable stress on the male involved, the quantities of semen ob-
tained are small and irregularly produced, ranging from 10-50 micro
litres per collection, and frequently are contaminated with urates. Now
we use a technique employing sexually mature males imprinted on
humans and trained to copulate voluntarily on a special hat worn by the
human companion (Boyd, et al 1977). A male so socialized and con-
ditioned can be expected to yield copious quantities of fresh, high
quality semen on a daily basis for an extended period. Table 2 illus-
trates the seasonal semen production in 1983 of four imprinted males
conditioned to copulate on a mating hat (see also Cade and Fyfe, 1978).
In conjunction with this need for semen, a project is currently under
way at The Peregrine Fund to perfect cryo-preservation of raptor semen.
The availability of viable frozen semen will allow for the extended
storage of desirable genes, and eventually will aid in their preservation,
exchange and transfer.
Our falcons are hatched in forced air incubators following the para-
meters of incubation worked out by Rahn and Ar (1974), Rahn et al
(1977), and in general we have achieved a consistent hatch rate of from
70-80% of our fertile eggs (see Weaver and Cade, 1983, for further de-
tails on propagation).
To maintain long-term production in captivity, it is important that re-

productive capacity should not diminish in, succeeding generations of
breeders. Table 3 indicates that at our Cornell facility in the years 1973
to 1983, the productivity of the Fj generation has been comparable to
that of the original wild-caught parent generation. Any apparent dif-
ferences noted in the percentage of fertile hatched and the percentage
reared can be attributed to our manipulation of incubation parameters,
with little, if any, biological significance. Some birds of the F 2 gene-
ration are also breeding now, but it is too soon to draw conclusions
about their reproductive performance.
We have encountered few problems associated with the growth and
behavioural development of our chicks. The young falcons reared at our
facilities appear indistinguishable from wild birds (see, also, Sherrod,
1983).
In order to establish captive-reared Peregrines in the wild, we have used
three release techniques: hacking, fostering, and cross-fostering. These
techniques have been described in detail by Sherrod and Cade (1978),
Cade (1980), Sherrod et al (1982). The technique of'hacking' is actually a
modification of the falconer's method of the traditional hack (Michell,
1900), the major difference being that, whenever possible, we allow all
falcons to return to the wild. Briefly, the hacking process involves placing
three to ten nestling Peregrines approximately 30 days old in an enclosed
artificial eyrie, a 'hack' box, where they are fed and cared for by on-site
attendants. After about two weeks in this enclosure, when the birds are
nearly capable of flight, the hack-box is opened allowing the birds to fly
when they are ready. Following their release, the birds return to this
artificial eyrie for food until such time (about five to six weeks) as they
become independent and leave the hack area. Hack-boxes have been
placed on natural sites (cliffs) as well as on man-made sites (towers and
city buildings).
Fostering involves placing young Peregrines in the established eyrie
of a nesting pair of Peregrines, thus increasing natural production and
supplementing depleted local populations.
Cross-fostering has been accomplished by placing Peregrine chicks in
the active eyries of Prairie Falcons Falco mexicanus in the western states.
In Germany it has been done using pairs of Goshawks Accipitcv gcntilis
(Saar et al, 1982).
Our first experimental attempts at releasing captive-bred Peregrine
Falcons to the wild occurred in 1974 when we fostered two downy
chicks into a wild Peregrine eyrie in Colorado and hacked a second set
of two from the roof of a building overlooking a university campus in
New York State (Cade, 1974). It was not until 1975, however, that
captive production reached a level sufficient to allow major restocking

experiments to begin. In that year we released 16 young at five sites (two
in cliffs and three on towers) in the East. Since 1974, the Peregrine Fund
has released a total of 1011 captive-bred Peregrines in the continental
United States. During 1983, 511 young have been released at 22 hacking
stations in nine eastern states, and an estimated 402 of these have sur-
vived to independence (Barclay and Cade, 1983). A total of 500 captive-
bred young have been released in 12 western states, and an estimated 375
have survived through the first four weeks after release and dispersed nor-
mally.
The first encouraging results from our hacking efforts occurred in 1976
when a male released in 1975 at a coastal tower in New Jersey returned to
the very same hack-box where he had been originally released and fed with
the young currently being hacked there that season (Cade and Dague

Table 4 shows the number of adult birds recorded as returning to
release sites each year in our eastern programme. Each year as the number
of young being released in the east increased, the population of returning
adults has slowly built up. With the increase in the wild population, a
sufficient density of falcons had apparently been reached in 1979 to allow
pair formation and maintenance with some stability. The first reproduc-
dive attempt in the eastern U.S. that we are aware of by a captive-bred
falcon occurred in 1979 when a lone female, 'Scarlett', released in 1977,
established a territory on the United States Fidelity and Guaranty building
in Baltimore, Maryland. 'Scarletf accepted an artificial nest-box filled with
^ jvci and iaid three infertile eggs. Following full-term incubation, four
cnicks hatched at our breeding facility at Cornell were subsequent-
&amp;apos;- v ! )Stere d to this dedicated female and successfully reared by her. Also in
- 9 /9, four pairs were formed at previous hack-sites, and one pair laid two
i 1 1ile eggs. Unfortunately, these eggs disappeared late in incubation, and
: k U nion by crows is suspected to have been the reason.

In 1980, two pairs of Peregrines nested in the eastern U.S., producing
four young. This milestone, the first known successful nesting of Pere-
grines east of the Mississippi River in more than 20 years, demonstrated
conclusively the suitability of the hacking process as a means of success-
fully establishing a population of Peregrines in the wild.
Table 5 summarizes the nesting attempts and the production of wild-
produced young as a result of our efforts in the eastern U.S. Following
our initial success in 1980, the number of adult pairs formed and young
produced has steadily increased. With this build-up of the wild population,
pairs have started occupying new and diverse territories. In addition to
the coastal tower sites, a pair used a traditional cliff site successfully for
the first time in 1981 (Cade and Dague, 1981), and in 1983 the first of
our birds bred on bridges in a busy metropolitan area (New York City)
(Cade and Dague, 1983).

Table 6 shows the eastern hacking results according to type of site
used. As can be noted from the data, the best release sites for hacking
young falcons have been coastal towers. A total of 238 young have been
released from the tower sites with an average of 81% of the young dis-
persing successfully. Inland cliffs are the second most utilized hack-
sites, where about 75% of the 216 young survived to become indepen-
dent. Urban areas have been used as release areas for only 57 young.
In 1983 there were at least 16 pairs of adults established in the mid-
Atlantic region of the East Coast. Nine of these pairs laid eggs and pro-
duced 23 young, an average of nearly 2.6 young per successful pair. We
anticipate continued growth and expansion of this founding population,
and we believe that a self-sustaining wild population will be established
in the next few years.

In our western programmes, where remnant populations of anatum
Peregrines still exist, re-introduction (Table 7) has emphasised the direct
fostering of young and cliff-site hacking, with 199 and 209 young res-
pectively, being released by each of these methods. Hack towers are less
frequently constructed because of the preponderance of natural cliff
sites in suitable habitat, so only 51 young falcons have been released from
such towers, while cross-fostering to Prairie Falcon eyries has been used
Lu 35 young. Six chicks were released in urban areas. The above data
include 59 young hatched from wild eggs.

We have often been asked, 'What happens to young falcons once they
are released?' In a wild population the mortality rate for young Peregrines
has been calculated to be nearly 67% for the first year birds and about
20% for subadults (Young, 1969) (see also Lindberg, 1977). Mortality
rates for our hacked birds have been determined to be about 26%, with an
overall first year mortality of 66.7% (Barclay and Cade, 1983). Causes
for these losses during the hacking period are shown in Table 8. As can be
noted in the East, the three primary causes for losses of young Peregrines
at release sites are: premature dispersal, predation by Great Horned Owls
Bubo virginianus, and adult Peregrine harassment. During recent years,
whenever possible, we have endeavoured to avoid as potential hack sites
those areas which have demonstrated a high likelihood of owl predation
or possible harassment by adult Peregrines. In so doing, we have achieved
a survival rate for our hacked birds of nearly 90%. By continuing to be
selective in our choice of release sites, we believe we can maintain this
favourable survival rate in the future.
In the West, predation by Golden Eagles Aquila chrysaetos , as well as
Great Horned Owls, has accounted for the greatest losses of both adult
and juvenile Peregrines. Even though we try to avoid areas inhabited by
these two species, they continue to pose a serious threat to our release
efforts in the West.
In the Rocky Mountains and adjacent areas, thanks in large measure
to the production and release of large numbers of Peregrines over the
past eight years by our Fort Collins programme, many banded Peregrines
have been seen at natural eyries and release sites. In 1983, in Colorado
alone, there were 13 locations where adult or subadult Peregrines def-
ended territories, and for the first time in many years two historical
eyrie sites were re-occupied (W. Burnham, 1983). We are also pleased to
report additional encouraging data from the Pacific Coast. Historically,
a population of approximately 17 nesting pairs of Peregrines occupied
cliffs on the central coast of California. By the early 1970s this number
lad dwindled to one or two non-producing pairs. Following intensive fos-
tering efforts by the Predatory Bird Research Group at Santa Cruz, over
10 pairs and four single birds could be found in this same area by 1982
(Cade and Dague, 1982).
We believe that the Peregrine Fund and its co-operators have con-
tributed significantly towards arresting the decline in Peregrine popula-
tions in the continental U.S. We have already witnessed an increase in
breeding pairs and in the production of wild young. It appears that this
population build-up, increased production and re-occupation of tradi-
tional eyrie sites, as well as colonization of new areas, may parallel the
initial phases of recovery observed in Peregrine populations in Great

Britain and Europe (Ratcliffe, 1980).
Cade (1980) has summarized the basic biological requirements neces-
sary to establish captive-produced Peregrines in the wild. Released birds
must possess: 1) behavioural patterns allowing social interaction and
reproduction to occur in the wild; 2) strong site specific attachment to
areas where they are released; 3) migratory habits allowing them to breed
successfully in release areas; and 4) a survival potential comparable to a
wild falcon. Finally, 5) the environment must be sufficiently free of
pollutants and harmful chemicals to allow released Peregrines to live and
breed successfully. Based upon our re-introduction results, it is reasonable
to assume that the first four requirements have been attained. There is
still serious concern, however, that chemical residues in the environment
may continue to interfere with reproduction, particularly in the western
regions of the United States.
Early reports indicate that 1984 has been exceptionally productive
both in the breeding chambers and in the wild. Preliminary production
data indicate that during this past season approximately 266 captive-
bred Peregrines were reared at our combined facilities. To this figure must
be added 71 young produced from wild eggs incubated in our laboratories
making a grand total of 337 young Peregrines - more than in any previous
year. Of this number 333 were added to the wild population, the remain-
der being held for breeding stock.
Additional encouraging news has reached us from the field. In the
East, where our founding population has continued to increase since our
first success in 1980, we have reports of 27 established pairs of Peregrines
in addition to 11 single birds on territory, for a total of 65 birds seen.
Sixteen of these pairs attempted to breed in 1984, and 12 were successful.
Thirty wild young were produced for an average of 2.5 young per success-
ful nesting attempt.

CAPTIVE MANAGEMENT OF THE EASTERN WHITE STORK

The Eastern White Stork (Fig. 1) is considered to be one of the most
endangered members of the stork family, Ciconiidae. Although once ab-
undant in Japan and Korea, the species has been extirpated from both
countries. The main breeding area for the stork is south-eastern Siberia,
where Russian scientists estimate the population to be 400-500 nesting
pairs (S. Smirenskii, pers. comm.). Chinese scientists undertook a heli-
copter survey in the northern province of Heilongjong, China, in spring
1984, and counted over 100 of the Eastern White Storks. Several nests
were also located (D. Parish, pers. comm.). The Chinese have also found a
major wintering area - Shengjin Lake in Anhui Province - where approxi-
mately 270 birds were counted in the winters of 1982-83 and 1983-84
(Wang Qishan, pers. comm.).
The last wild bird in Japan was captured in 1971. In Korea in the same
year a breeding pair was discovered in Umsung. Prior to this discovery,
the stork was presumed extinct in that country. According to the local
people, the pair had been nesting there for forty years! Unfortunately,
three days after the historic discovery, the male was killed by a local
hunter.
Although breeding storks no longer occur in Japan and Korea, winter
migrants are often reported from several locations. Some storks winter
further south, along the south-eastern coast of mainland China. One bird

Eastern White Storks in captivity
Two birds from the original population in Japan are still maintained
in captivity. Ten additional storks in Japanese zoos and aviaries were
either caught as wintering birds or were imported from China. The female
stork whose mate was killed in 1971 was caught in 1983 and has been

kept at the Grand Park Zoo (Kim, pers. comm.). Three storks were seen
in the Peking Zoo in the spring of 1984 (Luthin, pers. comm.), but no
more information is available. San Diego Zoo received four storks from
China in 1982, of which three survive (A. Risser, pers. comm.).
The species has never bred in captivity, despite earnest efforts, parti-
cularly by the Japanese. Following a drastic population decline in the
1950s and 1960s due to injury and sickness caused by pesticides, the
Japanese began an intensive propagation programme in 1963. Sadly, the
birds captured in these two decades have had numerous health problems,
undoubtedly related to heavy mercury contamination, and thus have
not been healthy enough for pairing and breeding. A hybrid was produced,
however, between an Eastern White Stork and a European White Stork.
With the exception of the storks in Japan and China, the captive birds
in other countries have been too young for breeding, as the storks in East
and West Germany and the Soviet Union were brought to the zoos as
young birds.
The storks at the Vogelpark Walsrode were provided by the Soviet
Government for initiation of a captive propagation programme for con-
servation purposes. A conservation plan was developed between the Soviet
Government and the International Crane Foundation (USA) in summer,
1979. Two pre-fledged chicks arrived at the Vogelpark in July 1980, and
an additional ten (two adults, eight chicks) arrived in June 1981. The
chicks were collected from separate nests along the Lower Amur River
(Wennrich, 1982).
Sex determination
Bill length can in some, but not all, cases be used for sex differentiation;
i.e. males have longer bills than females. However, 42% of the sample (four
males, four females) had culmens of intermediate length, and culmen
length alone was insufficient for determining sex. An even greater indivi-
dual variability is noted in the length of the tarsus. Fifty percent (six
males, six females) of the total sample fell within the intermediate range;
there was some separation by sex, however (see Fig. 2). Both male and
female of the confirmed pair at Vogelpark had culmens and tarsi of nearly
equal length, and this character alone is insufficient to distinguish the two.
There exists a slight sexual difference in bill-clattering behaviour. The
female of a known pair, as well as two unpaired females were observed ex-
tending their necks forward towards males and clattering very quietly and
slowly (fig. 3). Data are being analysed to determine quantitative beha-
vioural differences between sexes.
Sex determination from analysis of the droppings has been perfected
for the Eastern White Stork, and this technique would undoubtedly work

The eleven storks at Vogelpark Walsrode range in age from three to
eight years. Since February 1983, when an individual was killed by its
supposed mate, the birds have been partitioned into individual cages to
avoid further aggressive interactions. Prior to that time, the young birds
had been maintained together in small groups and presumed pairs.
Although the European White Stork is known to pair at two years and
iay eggs at three, the age of first-breeding of the larger Eastern White Stork
is unknown, although a slower maturation is suspected for this large
northern ciconiiform. Believing that at three years old, the birds may be
able to pair, the Vogelpark initiated an intensive research/management
plan for the storks in the winter of 1984.
Cages
The storks are held in individual enclosures isolated from public view-
ing, measuring 14 x 4 x 3.8 m. A wooden shelter 4 x 3 x 2.2 m is common
to two adjacent pens, and can be subdivided to accommodate a pair. Adja-
cent pens have three doors in common: one outside the shelter and two
inside. This arrangement makes it easy to bring the pair together for care-
lul observations. Within the entire enclosure unit, storks and cranes are
placed alternately to avoid intra-specific fighting and to allow establish-
ment of individual territories.

A perch was provided for each stork. A log approximately 5-6 cm in
diameter and 4 m long was placed parallel to the back fence. Six of 11
birds quickly accepted the perch, and they preferred to roost on the perch
instead of the ground. The other five never used the perches at all. Perhaps
a stork is not so adept at using a narrow perch, but rather needs a flatter,
broader surface. The Eastern White Stork often perches on rooftops and
electric power lines, where flat surfaces are provided. One small advantage
to the use of a perch is that those birds accustomed to using a perch were
also quick to utlise a nest when provided, but birds which did not perch
took much longer to become used to using a nest platform. The perching
birds also seemed more calm than those which did not perch.

Nest Platforms
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992231846153846" page_id="58080361"  page_num="97" year="" vol="">
Nest platforms appear to be of critical important for storks to develop
pair-bonds. Males of the European White Stork return to their nests prior
to the arrival of the females in the spring. A week or two later the females
arrive. The female is believed to select the male based on the nest alone!
At first, males tend to chase females away, but persistent females even-
tually are accepted, and copulation on the nest ensues (B. Schmitt, pers.
comm.).
The nest platforms of the Eastern White Stork at Vogelpark are larger
than those usually used for the European storks, measuring 2 m in dia-
meter, and placed approximately 1.3 m above the ground, allowing at
least 2.5 m 'head room' for copulation. The base is slotted for drainage.
The nests were 'started' for each pair early in the season, and placed in
the cage of the male. Long branches of 2-3 cm diameter were weaved
through vertical sticks nailed to the side of the nest. Smaller twigs and
straw were placed inside the fabricated nests. After the bird accepted a
nest, twigs and straw were provided regularly from late March to early
May. In addition to the twigs, storks often took evergreen branches,
fresh grass and feathers to the nests.
Diet
The young storks were fed minced fish, one-day old chicks from which
heads, feathers and legs were removed, beef hearts and live worms.
Supplementary vitamins and calcium were provided. As adults, the birds
receive whole fish and day-old chicks. At the start of the breeding season,
additional calcium powder and multi-vitamins are provided. Birds are
fed daily at midday. More fish and chicks are eaten during the peak of
the breeding season, after which the intake falls to normal.

Observations of pairing activities
The Eastern White Stork seems very particular in its mate selection.
During spring 1984, despite numerous attempt to establish pairs, only
one certain pair was formed from the 11 individuals. The sequence of
events was as follows:
(a) Originally, the two birds were maintained in distant pens within the
facility. The distant male, however, responded to the female's bill-clat-
tering with his own clattering. The date was 20th January.
(b) On 24th February, the male and female were moved closer to each
other, where one corner of their pens touched. The birds often met at
this corner and frequently bill-clattered together. Due to their nearly
identical appearance, it was then still difficult to discern what sex they
were. In fact, since the female was much more active than the male, it
was presumed that she was a male, and vice versa! The male clattered by
himself on 28th February, and the female followed suit.
(c) On 6th March the birds were moved to adjacent pens and a nest
platform was placed in the male's enclosure. He came up on to the nest
almost immediately and started nest-building. The two birds often stood
beside each other at the fence, still regularly clattering together and at
this time they allo-preened through the fence. What appeared to be a
'frustrated copulation' by the male (I shall refer to this as 'intentional
copulation') was performed in front of the female on 8th March (see
fig. 3). The male, although at first rather inactive, became increasingly
aggressive and active with nest ownership.
(d) On 9th March, the door between the pens was opened. Despite good
compatibility through the fence, the male was at first aggressive towards
the female, and the female fearful, when put together. The storks were
separated during the nights, and allowed to be together during the days.
On 12th March the female was exchanged with the male, to test her
reaction to the nest. She perched near the nest, but never landed on it.
Until early May, the male and female were allowed to interact during
the day, but were separated at night. The female never seemed interested
in nesting, and the male appeared 'frustrated'.
(e) On 7th May, two artificial eggs were placed on the nest. The male
immediately started incubating. Simultaneously his aggression disappeared,
and the female tended to approach him more often. Finally, the door
was allowed to be kept continuously open between the pens.
(f) On 15th May the female came to the nest for the first time, and again
on 18th May. Her clattering was answered by the male. From that day
on, the female roosted on the nest; however, she seemed uninterested in
the eggs.
(g) On 23rd May, a hatching egg of the European White Stork was put in

the nest. The male incubated the egg through the night, but abandoned it
in the morning.
(h) The egg was removed, and later the male attempted to copulate with
the female. By that time, the female was completely comfortable at the
nest. The pair nest-built, allo-preened, and bill-clattered together. The male
mounted the female several times on 25th May, but the female was un-
receptive. However, the pair-bond has persisted through the summer.
Since the male is six and the female three years old, it is presumed that
.
the female is still too young to begin breeding, and hence, despite good
pairing, did not respond to the male's initiatives. Nonetheless, we are quite
hopeful for next year.
In the European Stork, the female seems to select her mate (B. Schmitt
pers. comm.). Two Eastern White Stork females at the Vogelpark also
respond to particular males with mutual clattering. Perhaps, as with its
close cousin the European White Stork, females of this species also select
their mates. We hope to learn more in the coming season at Vogelpark.

Summary of management recommendations

<listItem confidence="0.994962" page_id="58080363"  page_num="99" year="" vol="">
(1) Whereas the European White Stork is somewhat colonial, the Eastern
White Stork appears to be a solitary nester (although there are reports ol
semi-colonial nesting (Y. Shibaev, pers. comm.)). The storks seem to do
better and are less aggressive if separated from their own kind.
(2) Careful observation of the storks is important for proper pair-forma-
tion. Observations should be made from a blind (hide), as the species is
quite shy and behaves unnaturally in the presence of humans.
(3) There is a good chance that a high level of aggression may be demon-
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.940364625" page_id="58080363"  page_num="99" year="" vol="">
strated prior to the formation of a good pair. Extreme caution should be
exercised to ensure adequate time for the birds to become comfortable
with each other, and ample space should be provided when birds are in-
troduced together, to allow for 'escape room if aggression is initially
demonstrated. It has been observed that there is no aggression in the
European White Stork once a pair is formed. The only incident of'mate-
killing' was when a female, behaving abnormally due to a brain tumour,
was killed by her mate. It is suggested that this abnormal behaviour may
have suggested an intruder to the male (B. Schmitt, pers. comm.).
Aggression is known between individuals of the same sex in the Euro-
pean White Stork, and two incidents of same-sex killings have been
reported from Japan (K. Vos, pers. comm.; Komiya, 1982).
(4) Perches may serve some useful function for the Eastern White Stork.
The perches were used by some and not by others. The individuals that
used the perches seemed to adjust to the presence of a nest much sooner
than those that used no perch. Perhaps a flat surface could serve a better

perch than a thin log. Perches are not necessary if a nest is present.
(5) A nest is probably very important for pair-bonding. The nest helps
promote the development of the pair, and stimulates territoriality and
the brooding urge. Since copulation occurs on the nest, at least 2.5 m
should be allowed overhead. Nest diameter can be between 1.5 and 2.0 m.
Nest materials should be provided continuously.
(6) An abundance of food should be provided to the storks at the onset
of the breeding season, as they consume more food at this time. At the
Strasbourg Zoo in France, one of the most successful stork centres of
Europe, the White Stork diet includes fish, one-day old chicks, cooked
pork liver, chicken feet, necks and heads, vitamins and calcium (B. Schmitt,
pers. comm.).
(7) A studbook for the storks is being developed at the Vogelpark Wals-
rode. Based on information from questionnaires that I sent to zoos and
from known locations of these birds, I have located a minimum of 38
Eastern White Storks in captivity (see Table 1). If a successful re-introduc-
tion programme is developed for the species, those organisations which
hold storks must co-operate to ensure careful and responsible genetic
management to produce a population for release.

(8) Continuous research on seasonal activity patterns, courtship and
breeding behaviour should be promoted for both captive and wild
Eastern White Storks in order to increase chances for successful breeding
in captivity, and to further develop a careful conservation programme for
the species.
Summary
Proper management techniques should result in successful captive
breeding. The ultimate goal of a propagation programme for the Eastern
White Stork is for future release into suitable habitat where it once oc-
curred, including Japan and Korea. As part of its comprehensive plan for
the species, Vogelpark Walsrode has begun developing captive management
techniques, is working closely with Soviet and Chinese scientists to learn
more about the wild stork populations, and has already contacted organi-
sations, scientists and zoos in Korea and Japan to initiate steps for the
future re-introduction of the rare storks into these countries. Protected,
pesticide-free habitat needs to be located, and the mechanisms of the
re-introduction programme are being worked out. Much can be learned
from the experience of the European Stork stations, which have had a
high degree of success with stork release projects (K. Vos, B. Schmitt,
pers. comm.).
We are hopeful that our understanding of this formerly little-known
species will help to build a good breeding programme in captivity, and that
efforts will benefit this endangered species.

THE HAWAIIAN GOOSE Branta sandvicensis IN THE 1980s

<bodyText confidence="0.98750445945946" page_id="58080366"  page_num="102" year="" vol="">
(The Wildfowl Trust, Martin Mere, Lancashire)
The success of attempts to breed the Hawaiian Goose or Nene in
captivity in England at Slimbridge and in Hawaii at Pohakuloa is probably
well known (Kear and Berger, 1980). From a low point, reached during
the 1940s, of less than 50 individuals in the world, the population has
risen to something over 2500. Hawaiian Geese are now fairly common in
zoos and avicultural collections and appear to be doing well there. In the
wild, however, the situation is not so encouraging.
Between 1949 and 1982, 1779 birds were reared in captivity in Hawaii
and 1071 by the Wildfowl Trust. Since 1960, 1808 of these geese have
been released into the wild, 1319 on the big island of Hawaii and 489 on
the nearby island of Maui. On Maui, a substantial proportion of the birds
came from England, reared either at Slimbridge or in Norfolk by Jack
Williams with whom some of the Wildfowl Trust birds had been placed on
loan. In addition, many hundreds of Hawaiian Geese have been bred by
private aviculturists since the early 1970s when the species became gener-
ally available.
The release of captive-bred birds into sanctuary areas in the uplands of
Maui and Hawaii was successful at first in increasing the estimated wild
population on Hawaii to 450 in 1972 and to 650 by 1977. On Maui, esti-
mations suggested that there were 150-200 in 1975, and between 225 and
325 in 1977 (all the Maui birds had been reared in captivity or were the
offspring of such birds, whereas some truly wild stock had still remained
on the island of Hawaii). Because of the apparent breeding success of the
birds that had been set free, and the increase in population size, releases
of captive-reared Nene slowed down after 1976.
Then in the late 1970s, numbers on both islands declined; by
1980 only 300 geese were estimated to be present on Hawaii and 100-
150 on Maui (Devick, 1982). Investigations suggested that this was
because half the adults were failing to breed every year, the goslings were
suffering high mortality perhaps during adverse weather conditions, and
there was heavy predation on eggs and incubating females (Stone et al,
1983). The Hawaiian Goose population now breeds almost exclusively in
the highlands where there is relatively little clement weather compared
with the lowlands, to which the birds used to move to breed in the old
days, and where the food supply may be deficient. Poor nutrition may be
the reason why only a small proportion of the potential population nests

every year, and could also contribute to the low gosling survival.
A recovery plan has been formulated (US Fish and Wildlife Service,
1983) and includes the recommendation that a predator control pro-
gramme, to reduce the numbers of mongooses, should be introduced.
Nutritional requirements of young and old geese need to be known, release
sites at lower elevations should be sought, release techniques need to be
E improved and, most importantly, captive-reared Nene must continue to be
used to bolster the wild population.

forests of Nagaland and neighbouring Manipur, in north-eastern India on
the border with Burma. The reasons for its endangered category are princi-
pally based on its limited distribution in a politically sensitive area. Al-
though reasonably well distributed in captivity on the Continent prior to
World War II, they died out, to all intents and purposes, during that period
though the last cock bird survived for a further 20 years or so. In 1983
two pairs were sent to Britain from Kohima in Nagaland where they have
around 15 in captivity. They bred in 1984. Due to small egg clutches of
4-5 eggs, building up large numbers in captivity will be difficult and slow.
At present there would be no grounds or necessity for reintroduction.

From south-eastern China in the mountain forests of Fokien, the
Cabot's Tragopan is the most easterly in distribution of the group. Like
the Blyth's Tragopan, they almost died out in captivity during World
War II.
A small group was maintained at the Pheasant Trust based on birds
sent over from Hong Kong by Dr. K.C. Searle. This group was distribu-
ted in 1977/78 to America, Germany and Belgium. Those in America
have been very successfully propagated, partly by artificial insemination,
and good numbers have been reared during the past two years.
Whilst the 1979 World Pheasant Association's Census showed just
12 Cabot's Tragopans in captivity, this number increased to 50 by 1982
and there must now be double that number, which is encouraging.
The status of the Cabot's Tragopan in China is at present uncertain.
WESTERN TRAGOPAN T. melanocephalus
This is certainly the rarest of the Tragopans and is now principally
located along the cease-fire line between India and Pakistan in Kashmir,
and in Himachal Pradesh where, fortunately, it is included within the
area recommended for a new National Park.
It is the only Tragopan to have proved really difficult in captivity.
A few were bred in France in the period from 1864-1893 but they died
out completely from around then onwards. Since that time only three
specimens have reached Europe alive. A pair was sent to the Pheasant
Trust in the 1960s, but the cock died soon after arrival. The hen sur-
vived for several years, laid eggs and even produced chicks when crossed
with a Temminck's Tragopan. One further cock bird reached Antwerp in
1981 but only survived for a few months.
Two years of field studies were carried out for the World Pheasant
Association in 1982 and 1983 by Kamal Islam who recorded over 100
sightings.
A project is in hand to make a further attempt to establish them in
captivity during the next few years. However, breeding them in really
large numbers will never be possible since, like all the Tragopans, egg
production is limited.

It was first reared in captivity in 1913 but became scarce princi-
pally as a result of two world wars. In the 1950s a small importation of
new stock, by the Pheasant Trust, led to a major revival in their num-
bers which continue to hold up well though they declined by over 100
between 1979 and 1982. Five hundred and thirty-two were recorded
at the 1982 World Pheasant Association's Census and the same comments
on the rearing of large numbers apply as for the Hume's and Elliot's
Pheasants (see below).
ELLIOT'S PHEASANT S. ellioti
The Elliot's Pheasant is found only in China, in evergreen, broad-
leaved forest in the south-east. Little of the original forest remains and
it is undoubtedly under pressure though it may be within some of the
newer forest reserves but this is unconfirmed.
The last pheasant census in 1982 recorded 847 in captivity, a drop of
300 since 1979. The majority relate back to birds imported before
World War II though two cock birds were imported in 1974 to the Pheas-
ant Trust and produced many offspring, and more recently two cocks and
a hen were imported by San Diego Zoo. Good fertility resulted from the
new importations but fertility generally is low - around 55% compared
to the norm of 90% in the wild. Chicks tend to be very wild and active
on hatching but usually rear quite easily.
This is a hardy species and easily kept in captivity. Like many other
pheasant species, it suffers from inbreeding though this could easily be
overcome by aviculturists taking more trouble in making up pairs. The
breeding of viable numbers for a re-introduction project would be per-
fectly feasible.

<bodyText confidence="0.943177307692308" page_id="58080369"  page_num="105" year="" vol="">
Hume's Bar-tailed Pheasant is the third of the pheasants in this genus
to be listed as endangered. Though first found in Manipur just over 100
years ago, Burma forms the largest part of its distribution and for this
reason there is little recent information on it.
In 1962 the late F.E.B. Johnson imported a few pairs to his Stagsden
Bird Gardens in Bedfordshire; he was successful with them immediately
and at the last census there were 527 birds distributed between over 10
countries.
Hume's Bar-tailed Pheasant belongs to the same group of pheasants as
Elliot's and is very similar in behaviour in captivity. So long as existing
stocks are maintained in a sound genetic manner, then breeding viable
numbers for re-introduction should not be a problem.

The distribution of the Cheer Pheasant through Pakistan, at the western
end of its range, through north-west India to central Nepal at the eastern
end, has probably always been patchy and non-contiguous.
This is the only pheasant of its genus and it is unusual in that the cock
bird plays a major part in brooding and rearing the chicks and the family
behave very much as a covey. They keep well below the snowline and
appear to be attracted to the grass cutting and cultivation of man, making
them rather vulnerable to hunters. Their patchy distribution has not helped
them in their fight to survive man's ever upward move into the mountains
and there are now only a few pockets of them left in northern India, with
probably the best and safest population being in western Nepal. Fortunately
they do well in captivity and are the subject of a most encouraging re-in-
troduction project in the Margalla Hill, north of Islamabad, Pakistan. Over
50 poults were released in 1983 and a similar number is hoped for in 1984.
There were frequent sightings of small coveys of Cheer Pheasants in the
release area from August 1983 through to April 1984.
It is hoped that a full field study of them in Uttar Pradesh, in northern
India,will get underway in 1985. At present the World Pheasant Associ-
ation maintains a flock of around 60 birds for the production of eggs for
the Margalla Hills project. In 1982 the numbers in captivity were around
460, and an excess of 300 eggs per annum have been despatched to Pakis-
tan for some eight years.

These magnificent birds come from western China in the area from the
province of Szechuan through to Tibet at the eastern end of their range
where they were unmolested by the Buddist population.
The first recorded pair in captivity goes back to 1891 but they did not
become firmly established in captivity until the 1970s when Jersey Zoo
played a major role in establishing them.
They are reasonably prolific layers, but fertility does seem to be variable
and it could be that pairing them in aviaries throughout the year is not
good practice.
With 434 recorded at the last World Pheasant Association census (a
25% increase in three years), there is little doubt that it would be possible
to obtain good numbers of fertile eggs if the need and opportunity for a
re-introduction project arose.

Undoubtedly the Brown Eared became very tame and imprinted on
man and fertility was poor. However, in 1976 the World Pheasant Associ-
ation initiated a project to use artificial insemination with them. This was
extremely successful and showed that this technique could be used at any
time to boost numbers and ensure mixed bloodlines. Numbers in captivity
are now around 564.

<bodyText confidence="0.968109136363636" page_id="58080371"  page_num="107" year="" vol="">
The Chinese Monal has a smallish distribution area in the mountains of
south-east Kokonar and western Szechuan at around 12-16,000 ft, over
2,000 ft above the White Eared Pheasants in the same area.
Very few specimens have ever come into captivity in the West, but in
1983 a pair were imported by San Diego Zoo and four chicks were hatched
in 1984. These represent the only known captive stock of this large and
endangered game bird though presumably others are in captivity in China.
However, there is probably no reason why numbers should not be built up
in a similar fashion to the Himalayan Monal of which there are over 1,300
in captivity, but it will take time and some additional stock will be neces-
sary to prevent inbreeding.
SCLATER'S MONAL L. sclateri
The Sclater's Monal takes over in distribution where the Himalayan
Monal ceases in northern Assam, and then eastwards across the Indian
border into China. Whilst it has been well recorded in the wild, only one
I cock bird has been recorded in captivity although a report was received
some years ago of a pair in the Rangoon Zoo.
As with the Chinese Monal, there is no known reason why Sclater's
should not do well in captivity and the failure to do so is probably due
only to the fact that this species lives in an inaccessible area and its
comparatively sparse distribution has not provided the opportunity.

they have survived reasonably well and numbers increased from 36 in
1979 to 59 in 1982.
We need to learn far more about this species before it would be prac-
tical to set up a re-introduction project. In the meantime, protection of
their forest habitat is of prime importance.
EDWARDS' PHEASANT L. edwardsi
Though discovered in 1895 it was not until 1923 that this species
was first brought into captivity in the West when Dr. Jean Delacour
shipped 15 birds to Cleres and bred from four cocks and three hens
which he retained in 1925.
The stock today is all derived from those original birds. Genetic
degeneration began to show up seriously in the 1970s and a Stud Book
was started by the World Pheasant Association. The resulting attention
to genetics created an immediate increase in numbers which was still
continuing at the time of the 1982 census when 690 were recorded in
captivity. There is little doubt that if a good number of pairs was
collected together, considerable numbers could be reared and further
improvement would be made to the stock.
IMPERIAL PHEASANT L. imperialis
This species was discovered and named by Dr. Jean Delacour in 1923.
Only one pair was captured and they bred successfully at Cleres in 1924.
The original cock bird was lost, along with the entire collection, in 1939
after the outbreak of war.
Sadly, there are now no pure survivors of this species in captivity
though specimens that look identical, produced from crossing cock birds
with a Silver Hen, still survive. Twenty-four of these reconstituted birds
remained alive in 1982.

There are reasonable numbers (around 500) in captivity and their survi-

eggs in a clutch can never be captive-bred in very large numbers, and it is
to be hoped that steps to ensure its protection in Palawan will be taken
before it is too late.

Neither subspecies is at present represented in captivity. It is likely
that, as with the Great Argus, clutch size is restricted to two and that the
birds take three years to mature. Captive breeding of large numbers would,
therefore, never be practical and this is another species whose long-term
survival is really dependent on the survival of their habitat.

THE CAPTIVE PROGRAMME FOR THE ENDANGERED
PUERTO RICAN PARROT Amazona vittata
By JAMES W. WILEY
</sectionHeader>

(US Fish and Wildlife Service, Palmer, Puerto Rico)
The Puerto Rican Parrot is one of the world's most critically endan-
gered birds. When Columbus arrived in 1493, the species was abundant
throughout Puerto Rico and three offshore islands (Mona, Culebra, Vie-
ques); however, parrot populations declined precipitously when European
colonists began cutting forests to cultivate the land. Habitat destruction
was undoubtedly the primary cause of the parrot's decline, but many other
factors (e.g. natural and introduced predators and competitors, as well as
pet-taking) figured importantly in the near loss of the species (Snyder,
1978; Wiley, 1980). By 1975 only 13 parrots survived in the wild and were
confined to the 11,000 hectare Caribbean National Forest in eastern
Puerto Rico. This population has slowly responded to intensive research
and management, and it now numbers about 30 birds. Still, this extremely
small population could suffer 'overnight' extinction from disease or a
hurricane. This vulnerability has made the captive propagation programme
crucial to recovery of the species.
The captive programme
The current conservation programme was started in 1968. It is a co-op-
erative effort of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), the US
Forest Service and the Department of Natural Resources of the Common-
wealth of Puerto Rico. A captive propagation project was initiated in 1971
as security against the complete loss of the species in the wild and to pro-
vide an additional source of young birds to augment production of the
wild population. The first captive efforts were conducted at the FWS Patu-
xent Wildlife Research Center in Maryland, USA, where two females dona-
ted by the Puerto Rico Zoo (Mayagiiez) and one wild-caught adult male
were housed. In 1973, the emphasis of the programme was redirected from
capture of wild birds to more intensive efforts to rehabilitate the wild
population. At that time, the site of the captive programme was shifted to
Puerto Rico, and an aviary was established in the heart of their remaining
range in the Luquillo rain forest. The aviary's location was critical for
co-ordinating egg and chick transfers between captive and wild pairs. Many
ot the chick and egg transfers must be made immediately and unless the
aviary support is close to the wild nest, such transfers would be impossible.

J.W. WILEY - PUERTO RICAN PARROT
The Puerto Rican Parrots are held within a concrete two-storey build-
ing as a precaution against vandalism and the frequent and severe tropical
storms. The building also houses a food preparation room, facilities for
incubating eggs and brooding chicks, a shop, and living quarters for staff.
Another aviary within the station compound, but isolated from the Puerto
Rican Parrot facility, contains a flock of Hispaniolan Parrots A. ventralis.
All parrots are kept under an artificial photoperiod system that can be
adjusted to stimulate breeding activities and thereby achieve egg-laying
synchrony with the wild parrots and between the captive Puerto Rican and
Hispaniolan flocks. The captives are fed foods consisting primarily of
fruits, vegetables, grains, and seeds. The captive parrots' diet is augmented
by seasonal wild foods (e.g. Sierra Palm Prestoea montana) from the rain
forest. Vitamin and mineral supplements are added to the diet daily.
The two surviving birds (the wild-caught male and one female) at Patu-
xent Wildlife Research Center were transferred to the Puerto Rico aviary
in 1977. Since that time, the captive flock has grown to 27 birds through
harvesting wild eggs and chicks, and retention of some captive-produced
chicks when they could not be fostered into wild nests. Acquisitions from
the wild are used to maximise genetic diversity or to save eggs or chicks in
situations where survival was judged hopeless (e.g. nest desertion). To
minimise impact on the wild population, no additional adult wild birds
have been taken into captivity.
During the recovery programme's early years, many parrot eggs were
transferred from wild nests to the aviary to safeguard the eggs against loss
to Pearly-eyed Thrasher Margarops fuscatus and Black Rat Rattus rattus
predation as well as to avoid egg-fouling in nests with moisture problems.
Dummy eggs were substituted in the nests to maintain incubation beha-
viour in the adult birds until chicks were returned to the nest cavity. The
parrot eggs were incubated in artificial incubators, and chicks were hand-
reared for about one week or until they showed good vigour and health.
Most predation and leaky nest problems have now been solved (Snyder &amp;
Taapken, 1978; Wiley, 1980; Wiley, in press). Eggs are normally left in
the cavities, although nests are checked frequently and watched as often
as possible from nearby hides.
Captive production
Production by the captive flock of Puerto Rican Parrots has been disap-
pointingly low. All mature females have produced eggs, but only two have
formed successful pair bonds that resulted in fertile eggs. Several problems
have plagued the captive programme, including a biased sex ratio (many
more females than males), poor pair bonding, and incorrectly sexed birds.
Accurate and safe sexing techniques have now been developed (Erb and

lercovitz, 1980). Also, the addition of birds has improved the sex ratio of
idults (3+ years) to a more favourable nine females to six males. However,
tdult behavioural problems continue to impede the captive breeding effort.
Since 1978 when the first fertile eggs were produced, a total of 46 eggs
lave now been laid by two females. Of these, 61% (n = 28) have hatched
ind 82% of the chicks (n= 23) have survived to fledge. Because a main ob-
ective of the captive programme is to augment wild production, ideally all
:aptive-produced chicks would be fostered in wild nests. A total of 13
;oaptive-produced chicks have fledged from wild nests. However, only two
:o four wild nests are active each year and normally one or two chicks can
ie fostered into each nest. When foster nests in the wild were not available,
captive-produced chicks (n = 11) have been retained in captivity as pros-
pective breeders. In the future, free-flying juveniles will be released into
: the forest under controlled conditions so that they are gradually 'weaned'
'From human care and integrated into the wild. Experiment results using
captive-reared Hispaniolan Parrots released in the Dominican Republic
suggest that similar techniques could be applicable for the Puerto Rican
Parrot (Wiley, 1983). Development of such techniques is also critical to
future re-introductions of Puerto Rican Parrots in restored parts of its
former range.
h
Use of substitute species
Ironically, we have had much better success with breeding the closely-
related Hispaniolan Parrots. New pairs have formed easily and we have had
to partially limit their production at times. The Hispaniolan Parrot flock
consists of six breeding pairs and 22 non-breeding young. These parrots
are used to test the safety, reliability and effectiveness of new procedures
and techniques prior to their application to the endangered Puerto Rican
Parrots. This includes determining proper doses of medications, developing
sexing techniques, refining nutritional regimes, developing artificial incuba-
tion temperatures, and experiments to mount radio telemetry packages
and training birds to accept them (Wiley and Gee, 1981).
Hispaniolan Parrots have also been used in experiments to determine
methods of increasing Puerto Rican Parrot egg and chick production. Two
types of replacement clutches have been induced in captive parrots:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.828279333333333" page_id="58080377"  page_num="113" year="" vol="">
(1) 'Double clutching', where the entire clutch is removed soon after it is
completed and the bird replaces it with a second set of eggs, and
(2) 'Sequential clutching' (Wiley, 1983). At least some Amazona parrots

are indeterminate layers, so that if each egg is taken as it is laid, the female
will lay a replacement egg. The average size of unmanipulated clutches of
the captive Hispaniolan Parrots is 3.7 +/- 0.2 (S.E.) eggs (range 2-5; n = 19
clutches). Double-clutching resulted in an average increase of 111% more

eggs (mean 7.8 +/- 0.5; min-max 6-9; n = 6) than in unmanipulated clutches.
Sequential removal experiments produced an average of 222% more eggs
(mean 11.9 +/- 2.3; min-max 4-21; n = 8) than control clutches.
After these experiments, comparable trials were performed on captive
Puerto Rican Parrots with similar results. Whole-clutch removal resulted in
an average increase of 90% more eggs (mean 5.7 +/- 0.4 eggs/clutch; min-
max 4-7; n = 13) over unmanipulated clutches (mean 3.0 +/- 0.3; min-max
1-5; n = 14). An average increase of 170% more eggs (mean 8.1 +/- 0.9;
min-max, 5-12; n = 9) than in normal clutches were produced by sequen-
tial removal of eggs. Replacement clutching manipulations are now also
done when needed at wild parrot nests, because of these successes.
Captive Hispaniolan Parrots serve as foster parents for both wild and
captive Puerto Rican Parrot eggs and chicks (Wiley, 1983). Although we
have techniques for artificial incubation of eggs, using foster birds for that
task is more reliable because artificial incubators are subject to egg-damag-
ing temperature changes caused by fluctuations in electrical power at the
remote aviary. Hispaniolan Parrots are used as foster parents because they
do a better job than human handlers in rearing Puerto Rican chicks. His-
paniolan Parrot eggs and chicks in turn are given to inexperienced Puerto
Rican Parrot pairs so that they can practice and improve their parental
techniques. However, it is still necessary to hand-rear some chicks that
require attention to injuries, parasites, or that cannot be placed into a
nest either because they are are not of the right age or nest space is un-
available.
Perhaps the most important use of the Hispaniolan Parrots has been
to provide captive-produced chicks for temporary replacement of Puerto
Rican Parrot chicks at wild nests. Each wild nest is critical to the growth
of the wild population. If a problem at a wild nest endangers the eggs or
chicks, the Puerto Rican Parrot eggs or young are transferred to the
aviary for care. During this period, less valuable Hispaniolan Parrot eggs
(or artificial 'dummies' if the eggs are not close to hatching) or nestlings
are substituted in the nest until the problem is solved.
The Future
Captive propagation will continue to be a vital part of the recovery
programme for the Puerto Rican Parrot (Wiley and Gee, 1981). Artificial
insemination techniques are being developed at the Patuxent Wildlife
Research Center (using Senegal Parrots Poicephalus senegalus) and at the
Puerto Rico Field Station aviary. Once perfected, this technique is expec-
ted to improve egg fertility among some pairs and among egg-laying, but
mateless females.

Rican Parrots will be made in the Luquillo Forest late in the 1985 breed-
ing season. We plan to follow these birds with radio telemetry. When the
wild population shows a very substantial growth (perhaps 200 pairs)
within the Luquillo Forest, a second aviary with a release facility will be
established in a distant forest in order to re-introduce a second wild popu-
lation.
The Puerto Rican Parrot has made slow, but promising progress toward
recovery. However, because the population has had fewer than 60 individ-
uals for at least 17 years, genetic diversity has become extremely restric-
ted. Rapid population growth is needed to reduce the probability that
genetic problems (e.g. decreased egg fertility, poor vitality of offspring)
will affect species fitness. At the same time, the conservation programme
must proceed with extreme caution to minimise mistakes that would limit
the parrot's recovery. With such a small population, the slightest error
could have long-lasting effects.

THE AVICULTURAL SOCIETY REGISTER OF BIRDS BRED
IN THE BRITISH ISLES BY AVICULTURAL SOCIETY MEMBERS

The above survey was first attempted for the 1973 breeding season. I
Published in the July-August 1974 issue of the Magazine, it covered
3 12 forms bred by 60 contributors. This was an encouraging start, and the
compiler, Peter Brown, expressed the hope that more members would
report their breeding results for 1974. This second effort listed 360 forms
bred by 86 contributors. These first two Breeding Registers had been in-
cluded in ordinary numbers of the Magazine; the 1976 Register was a slim
volume in its own right, with well over 500 forms bred by nearly 300 avi- I
culturists.
At this stage four collators were involved in its production. If the
Register had continued to grow at this rate, it would eventually have
become a fairly complete survey of all non-domesticated birds bred under
controlled conditions in the British Isles. As such, it might have helped to
moderate some of the restrictive legislation that has appeared in recent ij
years, affecting the keeper of European species. The more birds that are I
seen to be bred, the more aviculture will be seen as a force for conserva- I
tion rather than a consumer of wildlife. Unfortunately, the novelty of
having one's breeding results published seems to have worn off, for a ^
great many people. Only 35 breeders have contributed to the 1983 Reg- \0x25A0
ister which I am collating at present. Many people may be afraid of having 1
their birds stolen if their names and addresses are published. However, re-
quests for anonymity are always honoured, and even a long list of anony-
mous breeders would be better than nothing.
If even fewer breeding returns are submitted for 1984, it will not be 1
worth producing the Register, and an interesting and valuable exercise &amp;apos;
will have come to an unnecessary end. So please , British members, if you
bred any birds in 1984, send details either to the Hon. Secretary or \
directly to me. Thank you.

CAPTIVE BREEDING PROGRAMME FOR THE MOST

With a known population of no more than 21 individuals, the Oriental
Crested Ibis Nipponia nippon is one of the most endangered avian species
in the world. In a major effort to safeguard the species from extinction,
the Chinese Government has developed a comprehensive research/manage-
ment/captive breeding programme for the species. This programme has res-
ulted from an historic meeting of government officials, scientists and zoo
personnel at the Peking Zoo during May 1984, in an attempt to assist the
last population of these birds.
The only known wild birds are found in Shaanxi Province, nesting at
1200 m in the Qinling Mountains. There, 17 birds have been located by
the Chinese scientists. One individual in the Peking Zoo and three at an
ibis breeding facility ('Toki Center') in Japan constitute the other known
individuals. Sadly, there has been no breeding success at the Japanese cen-

The ibis breeding facility has been designed and will be constructed at
the Peking Zoo in 1985. One or several eggs and/or chicks from the last
remaining nests of the ibis will be brought to the facility to supplement
fc the solitary bird already there. The Chinese Government has asked the
W.W. Brehm Fund for International Bird Conservation, West Germany, to
assist with this important undertaking. The Fund has developed an agree-
ment with the government whereby design and construction of the facility
will be financed in part by the Fund. Since the Vogelpark Walsrode (which
created the Fund) has had many years of breeding experience with numerous
species of ibises and spoonbills, it was an obvious choice to be asked for
assistance. Once the facility is constructed, the Fund will further help pro-
vide all necessary equipment and supplies for its operation. Additionally,
field researchers working on the Crested Ibis in its natural habitat have been
provided with research equipment and materials for their work in 1985.
The forthcoming breeding programme for the species may be a signifi-
cant step in the conservation of this extremely rare species, as its situation
in the wild is, at best, precarious. A conscientious captive programme can
supplement the very low numbers in the wild, and could in the future be
used in a release programme into suitable habitat.

CONSERVATION ISSUE OF THE AVICULTURAL MAGAZINE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999271743589744" page_id="58080382"  page_num="118" year="" vol="">
When we appealed for contributions to this special issue, we could not
have foreseen that so many authors would respond so splendidly, from all
over the world, and we soon realised that it would be invidious to make a
selection for only a normal sized issue. The obvious solution was a double
issue, covering January-March and April-June, and in the course of prepa-
ration, two members offered to donate coloured plates which add greatly
to the importance of this issue.
We thank you for your patience and hope that you will feel that this
double issue was worth waiting for. We are sure that it will help to draw
attention to the very real contribution that aviculture is now making to
the conservation of rare species and that copies will also be bought by
many non-members.
We are indebted to many people for its realisation, above all, David
Coles whose enthusiasm and persistence have persuaded and encouraged
authors to write. Richard Daniels has sacrificed many hours of precious
painting time to read the proofs and has made valuable suggestions to
improve the text. The colour plates, which have been made possible by
the generosity of Dr. Henry Quinque and an anonymous member, have
greatly enhanced this issue. Most of all, we thank the authors, all busy
people, who have spent a lot of time working to contribute so much
original material.
In recent years, the populations of many avian species have declined
alarmingly in the wild and this issue illustrates a few of the successes
which are occurring in breeding captive stocks of endangered species. As
has been seen so often, the main cause for the decrease in numbers is the
destruction of the birds' natural habitat, due to deforestation and building
new roads and towns with accompanying industries. This trend is further
accentuated in the case of island species which have no possibility of
moving into a new environment - the plight of the Amazona island species
amply illustrates this point. Captive breeding must, in many cases, prove
to be the only form of survival and even the most ardent nature conserva-
tionists must concede that it is better for a species to continue under good
captive management than to die out altogether. There is always the
possibility of re-introduction to the original wild habitat, should the
circumstances become favourable, though this may be a forlorn hope in
many cases where the 'wild' no longer exists. So often the aims of avicul-
turists and conservationists have seemed to be at variance and we must
now hope that the two parties become reconciled and that captive manage-
ment and nature conservation work together for the same end.

Aviculturists would wish for a more flexible attitude on the part of
governments so that requests to import precious breeding stock can be
sympathetically received. No responsible aviculturist now would want to
see a return to large importations of rare species for unknown destination,
but if adequate captive breeding stock is to be established, and then main-
tained by periodic introduction of new genes, it is essential that dedica-
ted breeders are able to maintain the minimum number of birds neces-
sary. They, in turn, must, of course, be prepared to be accountable for
their birds and to co-operate with others in exchanging stock and making
up breeding pairs. The maintenance of studbooks will become increasingly
important.
An essential element in successful captive management is the exchange
of information and it is vital that all experience gained from keeping and
breeding rare species, particularly those of genera which have not been
bred previously, should be made available to all and we are determined
that the Avicultural Magazine should be a very important means of this
communication. To this end, we do hope that we can rely on the con-
tinued support of our members by providing more articles, financial help
and, that vital element of any endeavour, encouragement.

A SUCCESSFUL BREEDING OF THE
WHITE-BELLIED TOURACO Cory thaixoides leucogaster
AT THE HOUSTON ZOO
</sectionHeader>

By WILLIAM TODD, DAVID C. GRUBBS &amp; HUGO LAHERA
(Bird Section Staff, Houston Zoo)
Of the Musophagidae, the White-bellied Grey Touraco (Go-Away
Bird) must rank among the handsomest, its sharply delineated grey and
white plumage, elegantly appointed with black, and its slim proportions
presenting a stately, almost formal appearance. It is unique in the family
in displaying the sole example of readily-apparent sexual dichromatism:
the beak of the male is jet black, that of the female grey-green. The species
is native to eastern equatorial Africa, from Ethiopia and Somaliland
southward into Kenya, and, like its congeners, frequents acacia woodland;
it is reputed to inhabit drier country than any other touraco and to be
largely dependent on acacias for food (Moreau, 1958). Two or three pale
blue eggs (the colour is also unique in the family) are laid in a flimsy nest
typical of touracos and are incubated by both parents.
The New York Zoological Park was first successful in breeding this
species in 1975. A single chick was hatched on 6th September and, at the
age of two weeks, was removed from the nest and hand-reared, reaching
independence and surviving until 26th September, 1976. During 1976 and
1977, 16 chicks were hatched but none survived for more than four days,
approximately seven suffering congenital deformities (Donald Bruning, in
litt.). In 1982 the breeding pair was generously offered on loan to the
Houston Zoo.
A concise survey of our touraco breeding programme has appeared
previously in this magazine (Berry &amp; Todd, 1982). Following a routine
quarantine period ending on 24th August, the White-bellied Grey Touracos
were housed alongside other species in a similar flight measuring 7 x 15 x
7 ft (2.14 x 4.58 x 1.14 m) with a 10 ft (3.05m) high wooden shelter in

which the nest platform is located out of public view. At this time only a
standard diet was provided consisting of mixed fruit (chopped papaya,
apple, grapes and soaked rasins), moistened dog and cat kibble, and
chopped spinach and endive, the fruit being r &amp;apos;i*ovided twice daily. Addi-
tionally, game bird breeder crumbs and dry mynah pellets were provided
ad lib., and the birds were occasionally observed to eat these items. This
diet, with the supplements noted below, continues to be supplied.
Although the birds displayed some interest in the nest provided, no
serious breeding activity occurred until April 1983, when both sexes were
observed alternately sitting in the nest. On 30th April it was confirmed
that two eggs were present, one hatching on 18th May after an undeter-
mined incubation period. Unfortunately this chick was found dead six
days later. Necropsy indicated an impaction of leaves from a Crepe Myrtle
Lagerstroemia indica tree in the flight. No further nesting activity took
place before the male's death on 2nd August of acute hepatitis.
In the meantime, a second male had been lent by the Pittsburgh Aviary;
this bird and the lone female established a pair-bond after an initial period
of adjacent introductory housing.
As no breeding activity was apparent by early spring 1984 (many
touraco species breed year around in Houston), the birds were moved to
another flight of similar design in which a small acacia Acacia radii had
been planted. This proved attractive and the birds began eating any leaves
that could be reached. In addition, as the unsuccessful attempt had indica-
ted a strong inclination for the parents to feed greenfood, an entire head
of Romaine (Cos) lettuce was attached daily to a perch from which they
could easily tear bits of leaves. Finally, honeysuckle Lonicera japonica
stems with leaves and blossoms, when available, were attached to the
perch. The birds consumed all plant material provided, and we believe
this was crucial to their successfully rearing chicks. As an additional en-
couragement, a second smaller nest platform containing a handwoven
framework of dried vines over straw was fixed on the shelter wall a short
distance below the older nest which contained only straw. On 11th April
eggs were observed in the upper nest, and on 5 th May, the first chick
hatched, followed by a second two days later. The incubation period is
approximately 25 days, though reluctance to disturb the birds has made
exact calculation impossible.
One chick was found dead on the cage floor on 11th May, but the
other appeared to thrive and was on the point of fledging when it died
suddenly of undetermined causes. At this stage, it was feathered like an
adult, including white belly and black accents on crest, wings and tail,
and had a black beak.
The birds renested quickly: by 25th June the male was observed incu-

bating on the lower nest (possibly to escape the heat of the tin roof
above the upper box), thus confirming the presence of eggs. The first of
three eggs hatched on 16th July, and although one of the nestlings was
discovered dead on the cage floor, the remaining two survived to fledge
on 7th and 13th August. The second to leave the nest was markedly
smaller, indicating that the chick that died may have been the second to
hatch.
At fledging both were feathered like an adult, though with propor-
tionately shorter crests and tails, and both had black beaks. (At the time
of writing [8th October] both their beaks remain black, and we are as
yet uncertain if beak colour is a reliable indicator of sex at fledging.) The
white bellies of both young were very soiled with faecal material in the
nest which had not been as sanitarily maintained as those of other toura-
cos.
On 20th August, the larger fledgling was observed eating honeysuckle
buds, though both continued to be fed by their parents until at least
11th September when the adults were again visiting the nest-box and
appeared to be ignoring the juveniles. The latter began to consume large
quantities of greenfood, anxiously awaiting their keeper's placement of
fresh lettuce and honeysuckle.
At the time of writing, the first egg of another clutch has been laid,
and we look forward to continued success with this species.

Note added at proof stage
By late Spring 1985, one of the above-mentioned chick's beaks had turned grey-
green, thus indicating that it is a female. This distinction is apparently acquired with
approaching sexual maturity.
By August 1985, two more chicks had been successfully reared to independence.

Included amongst the large family of tanagers are the 24
species of Euphonia which occur southward from Mexico where
they are found in pairs or groups at the edges of forests, search-
ing for insects, berries and small fruits. They are dumpy little birds gener-
ally about 4 in (10 cm) in length with short tails and stubby bills.
In September 1983 we purchased a pair of Golden-breasted Euphonia
which was to live in our Tropical House together with pairs of Black-
capped Zosterops, Purple Sugar Birds, Black-chinned Yuhinas and Blue-
chinned Sapphire Hummingbirds. The male is bright yellow on the fore-
head and forecrown and all underparts from upper chest. The remaining
plumage, including the throat from chin to upper chest is black with
purple and blue glosses: the tail has white patches on the underneath; the
beak is black with grey at the base. The female bears no resemblance,
being a dull olive green which is brighter above and pale below.
After keeping them in a cage for a week to make sure that they were
healthy, as we do with all newly-acquired birds, the Euphonias were
released into the tropical house where, to our disappointment, they dis-
appeared amongst the dense foliage, only to be seen on occasions at
the feeding trays.
To ensure a varied diet is received, they are given chopped pears and
grape daily, chopped banana, of which they are very fond, three times a
week, half an orange once a week and half an apple twice a week. Other
fruits are given when in season. Mealworms are given daily in moderation.
Dishes of Claus insectivorous mixture and drinking tubes with
Biotropic Nectar are always available. I find that all the birds are
very fond of both these products.
Both birds remained very shy until April 1984, when the male was seen
taking a leaf bath after I had sprayed the plants; after watching him for a
while, the female began doing the same and they enjoyed it so much that
it became a daily event. During the next few weeks they became very ac- ,
tive and wherever the female went, the male was never far behind. Each
time I passed or entered the tropical house, they could be heard calling to
each other. All the hanging baskets, which contained large Boston Ferns,
were thoroughly investigated and then, on 10th June, the female was seen
carrying strands of coconut fibres to one basket. Within five days she had !
constructed a dome-shaped nest from the fibres, the male helping occa-

sionally. On 17th June the first of three eggs was laid - it was pinkish white
with brown spots which were heavier at the broad end. Incubation did not
start until the last egg was laid and the female then sat tight, leaving the
nest only to feed. The male, who sat close by most of the day, produced
a sound which can only be described as similar to a squeaky wheelbarrow.
On 1st July, after an incubation period of 12 days, the first egg
hatched, followed by the second the next day; the third turned out to be
clear. Rather than cause any disturbance, no attempt was made to look at
the chicks.
To ensure that an adequate supply of live food was available for the
parents to rear the chicks, in addition to white mealworms, fruit fly mag-
gots and buffalo worms, we collected insects, green caterpillars and spiders
in a bucket at two-hourly intervals. Preference was given to the caterpillars
and spiders, which were first eaten by the parents and then fed regurgita-
ted to the chicks. The male was first to feed; when he finished, the female
took her turn and then remained in the nest until the next feed.
When the chicks were nine days old, I had the chance to take a quick
look in the nest. Their eyes were open, they had dark skin and were begin-
ning to grow flight feathers, but apart from this they were completely
bald. It was not until they were 15 days old that pin feathers started to
appear, and by this time they had doubled in size and were being fed vast
amounts of caterpillars and spiders, still regurgitated. I noticed that the
parents were also adding pieces of pear and grape to the chicks' diet. The
male would now feed them by clinging to the front of the hanging basket
and just poking his head inside the nest.
In the days that followed, their growth rate was rapid and when they
left the nest on 23rd July, at 23 days old, they were fully feathered and
able to fly. Whilst one resembled the hen, it was obvious that the other
was a male by the underneath of the tail feathers which, although short,
had white patches appearing. He also had some black feathers in his
wings.
Both parents continued to feed the chicks until 31st July and it was at
this time that I noticed the female was missing. On checking the nest,
thinking that she might have returned to lay some eggs, I was surprised to
find she had built another nest round the other side of the hanging basket.
Unfortunately there were no eggs and no sign of the female. With a sink-
ing feeling I began to search amongst the plants and, as expected, I found
her dead. At the time we could find no apparent reason for her death, but
later wondered if the spiders and caterpillars collected the day before had
any connection. Having depleted the supply near to home, they were col-
lected from bushes near to a cornfield some distance away. As a male
Black-chinned Yuhina, who had also been eating them, fell ill and we had
bad rashes appear on our hands and necks, it occurred to us that the field

may have been sprayed with an insecticide.
The male continued to feed the young for a further week and they
were then left to fend for themselves. Neither made any further attempt to
beg food from him.
From then on the male was to surprise us by singing a delightful song
that we had not heard before. We hope we shall be able to obtain another
wife for him to sing it to.
As described above, the Golden-breasted Euphonia Euphonia xantho-
gaster has been bred by Mrs. Lloyd-Roberts and this -is believed to be the
first success in this country. Anyone knowing of a previous breeding in
Great Britain or Northern Ireland, or of any other reason that would
disqualify this claim, is asked to inform the Hon. Secretary.

BREEDING THE GROSBEAK STARLING
Scissirostrum dubium

The Grosbeak Starling is indigenous to the Celebes (Salawesi), and from
the notes available, it would appear to be quite numerous in the south part
of the island, although the subspecies S.d.pelingense appears on a few
islands around the north-east peninsula. I would guess that the race I own
is the nominate race.
The whole of the body and head are slate grey, the primaries and tail
feathers black, the rump and sometimes thighs and flanks are streaked
with orange and shining red. The feet, legs and beak are lemon yellow. The
beak is quite large, as the name suggests. The eye is grey, and the bare skin
is grey/black. The tail is graduated and quite long. From beak tip to tail
tip the bird is about 8 in. long.
For many years I had wanted to own this species since I first encoun-
tered it when visiting Mr. M. Sherbourne of Bristol in the late Sixties. I
have two pairs which were obtained from a dealer some three years ago
and both pairs have produced eggs and young but failed to rear them until
this year.
One pair (A) was housed in an inside flight 8 x 3 x 6 ft high (2.44 x

Adult pair of Grosbeak Starlings with chick that was successfully reared
0.92 x 1.83 m) and they laid and hatched eggs from the first few months
that I had them. They are now housed outside in an aviary 3 x 5 x 6 ft
high (0.92 x 1.53 x 1.83 m) and are in full moult at the time of writing.
The other pair (B) were housed over winter in a 4 x 1.6 x 1.6 ft (1.22 x
0.46 x 0.46 m) cage. Being an optimist where my birds are concerned,
I supplied them with a nest-box 6 x 6 x 10 in high, of the same design as
a garden tit box but larger (both pairs like this type of box). The box was
placed at the back end of the cage; two perches were placed across the
depth (1.6 ft) of the cage, one about Vi in diameter at the nest-box end
and at the other end a largish, rotting log was used as a perch. The birds
chipped at this log in the fashion of barbets but never took any of the
chips into the nest. From past experience, I had learned to leave the nest-
box empty of nesting material, also I did not supply any nest material in
the cage. The box was lined with newspaper which was also used to cover
the floor of the cage. The birds tore it into thin strips which they used on
the floor of the nest-box. The paper is not made into a cup but just
scattered and only about 15 strips are used which seems a very small
amount.
The normal clutch is two eggs, light blue speckled with shades of brown
at one end, and varying in shape from oval to triangular. The eggs hatch at

variable periods, from 18 to 22 days, and are perfectly chipped about two-
thirds up the egg. On hatching the chicks have tufts of light-coloured down
which turns grey after a few days. Up until about 10 days old, they look
like young thrushes, but then the beak starts to take shape. To me, they
seem to take a long time fledging.
From pair B there were two eggs, both hatched but one chick died at
about 20 days old. The remaining chick left the nest on 14th May 1985
and was self-feeding about six days after leaving the nest.
I have had two chicks leave the nest. The first chick was from pair A
but it died the day after leaving the nest. This chick was unusual in that
it had no markings on the rump or thighs. The chick from pair B took
about 35 days to leave the nest but did not subsequently return and the
parents started nesting again. This chick had very faint pink/orange streaks
on the rump and flanks.
The diet for the chick's parents was very ordinary. I had tried all forms
of food - stick insects, wax moths, crickets, buffalo worms, mealworms,
beetles, figs, avocados - but nothing worked. The pair in the cage (pairBj
were given only a few extra mealworms. Their diet consisted of diced
apple, tomato, carrots, grape, peas, sweetcorn, cabbage and currants -
this was mixed together and Claus Pekin Robin Softfood added. Claus
Flycatcher food was also fed but in a separate dish. Claus Pekin Robin
food is the fatty type, not the one with honey, and has a high rice paper
content which all my softbills like. About 20 mealworms and five wax
moth worms were also given daily. All dishes were washed and the news-
papers on the floor changed daily. Brown bread and nectar (mashed) was
also given. All the food was eaten except the mealworms - often a few
were left next morning. It was noticed from the start that the chick was
reared on the fruit and Claus Insectivorous Mixture. By sound I would say
that it was regurgitated.
On leaving the nest the chick was complete in plumage, being a lighter
grey and orange than the parents. The legs were pinkish and three weeks
after leaving the nest they started to turn yellow. The beak was yellow
and about half the size of the parents' beaks. The chick grew up to be a
perfect specimen and my fears that it might have had rickets, as some
starlings do, proved groundless.
In my opinion, apart from the Glossy Starlings, this species is one of
the most beautiful of all tire Sturnidae. It adapts readily to cage, aviary
and food, and is eager to nest, but shy. It should make a good species for
both the experienced aviculturist and tire beginner to breed.

The Golden Heart is a small, attractive dove from New Guinea, measur-
ing about 8 in long, the upperparts a rich chestnut brown, throat and
breast golden-yellow, wings barred with pale grey and the legs and feet a
dull red.
A pair of these birds is housed in the indoor tropical flight where they
spend most of their time foraging on the ground, which is typical of their
behaviour in the wild.
During the year (1984) they built several nests, but were disturbed at
some point of the incubation period by a pair of Luzon Bleeding Heart
Doves Gallicolumba luzonica which was also trying to nest. These birds
were eventually removed to an outdoor aviary where they successfully
bred, leaving the Golden Hearts to settle down to some serious breeding
I activities.
They were very industrious, building several nests from rootlets and
dead leaves. A single egg was laid on several occasions but the chick failed
i to hatch; the first egg was infertile and the second nest fell off a Monstera
leaf, smashing the egg which revealed a well-developed embryo.
The Doves did not give up, however, and soon built a nest about 2 ft
j from the ground on a large Crinum x powellii leaf, situated at the front of
the building, alongside the public viewing area. They sat tightly, alter-
nating during the day, totally undisturbed by the public.
On 18th June, after an incubation period of 17 days, the chick hatched
and was seen to be covered in fluffy, cream-coloured down. All went well
until the sixth day when the squab was found dead in the nest, still being

brooded by the female. We believe that it died from suffocation as it had
a full crop and had looked healthy the previous day. The nest, we feel, was
built too near to the public area and the adults were afraid to leave the
infant.
Even this setback did not deter them for long as they soon built again.
This time the nest was at the back of the tropical house where they laid
and began incubation within a couple of days. During the afternoons both
birds sat on the nest until the chick hatched on 22nd July. The squab grew
rapidly and by the 30th July, wing feathers had started to appear.
On one occasion, whilst I was cleaning the tropical house, the female
was startled from the nest. She flew to the ground, cooing and shaking
her wings vigorously but once I had left the nest-site, she returned to the
nest and resumed brooding. This broken wing display was seen several
times during the following weeks.
The squab fledged on 7th August and was seen to feed itself on the
23rd, on a dove seed mix and small pieces of fruit. Whenever the adults
approached, however, it still begged for food. By 30th August it was fully
independent, taking various seeds, diced fruit and livefood in the form of
maggots and, occasionally, small crickets and stick insects.
The Golden Heart Doves enjoy taking a shower and, whenever the hose
pipe is used in the tropical house, they lie on one side with a wing out-
stretched. Once completely soaked, they turn over and repeat the process.
The young dove took its first shower on 7th September. It had acquired
full adult plumage within three months of leaving the nest, and the adults
have since built a new nest and are at present incubating another egg.

RANDOM NOTES ON BIRDS IN THE USSR
By JEFFERY BOSWAFE
(Bristol)
Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.97484896969697" page_id="58080401"  page_num="131" year="" vol="">
I have been visiting the USSR and enquiring into the relationship be-
tween the Soviet people and their birds for over a quarter of a century.
Knowing of my frequent visits to behind the Iron Curtain, friends and
acquaintances often put to me such questions as: Do the city comrades
feed the birds? Do they put up nest-boxes? How popular is birdwatching?
What is the state of Soviet bird science? Is there a Soviet bird protection
society? How many bird reserves are there? What laws, if any, protect the
birds? Is there a 'Glorious Twelfth' when the proletariat take to the taiga
to shoot Willow Grouse Lagopus lagopusl Do Soviet wildfowlers bring
down geese and ducks from the autumn skies? Are any birds regarded
as pests in the USSR? Which bird species are favoured by serious Soviet
aviculturists? And which cage birds find favour among Soviet families?
What of domestic birds - is the chicken supreme or the Muscovy Duck
Cairina moschata ?
Some of these questions I have already dealt with either in the Avicul-
turalMagazine (Boswall, 1983, 1985a) or elsewhere (Boswall, 1984, 1985b
and 1985c; Boswall &amp; Wilson, in press; Boswall, Wilson &amp; Dickson, 1982).
The USSR
For a start, the USSR is so vast that answers are likely to vary. Further,
there are 270 million people of whom only half are Russians. The others
are Ukrainians, Uzbeks, Belorussians, Kazakhs, Tartars and so on, speaking
a variety of languages and perpetuating a diversity of cultures in which
birds could play very different roles.
Within this great country - easily the largest on earth - there are 15
republics (of which Russia, i.e. the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist
Republic, is only one, though easily the largest and the most influential).
Birds and the Proletariat
Just how interested in providing nest-boxes for birds is the average
Soviet citizen? Artificial nesting sites are provided as frequently as not for
the Starlings Sturnus vulgaris , a much-loved bird in Russia. A Starling nest-
box is called a skvorechnik and is a characteristic feature of village gardens
and country farms. In Leningrad the bird uses boxes on the balconies of
the upper storeys of high rise blocks. Nest-boxes are also put up for other

birds. Take Lithuania. There the Ministry of Forests instructs foresters to
make and site nest-boxes. Boxes with a 32 mm hole are for Great Tits
Pams major and Pied Flycatchers Ficedula hypoleuca, but may also
attract a few Coal P. ater and Crested Tits P. cristatus. Those with larger
entrances are for Rollers Coracias garmlus but may get used by Jackdaws
Corvus monedula, and the largest boxes of all are for Tawny Owls Strix
aluco. Even more interesting is the story of a Lithuanian bird of prey
fanatic called Shablevicius who was lucky enough to find the very first
nest of Tengmalm's Owl Aegolius funereus for the republic. But since the
birds nested in a natural hole in a tree, they were difficult to study. Over
the next few years, however, he persuaded ten or a dozen pairs to occupy
the boxes he had put up for them. Encouraged by this success he then
put up platforms for Lesser Spotted Eagle Aquila pomarina, Common
Buzzard Buteo buteo and Goshawk Accipiter gentilis in situations also
more suitable for observation than those the birds might have chosen for
themselves, and was rewarded with more than one pair of each moving in!
The arrival of spring is heralded also by the song of the Great Tit in
the towns and the Skylark Alauda argensis in the country; also by the
return of the Starling and the Rook Corvus fmgilegus. The Rook, not the
Swallow Himndo mstica, is the Russian harbinger of spring. Witness the
famous painting in the Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow which is entitled
The Rooks are Back'. It is by the 19th century Russian painter Savrasov
and shows birds re-occupying the colony to repair nests. For only 40 p.
I was able to buy a poster-sized reproduction of this painting, one of a
print run of 200,000. Come autumn, both the Rook and the Starling
desert Russia for more hospitable climes to the west and south.
During a recent mid-winter visit to the extreme south of the USSR I
was amused and interested to catch up with the wintering Rooks. They
too had become commuters! In the ancient city of Samarkand, in the rep-
ublic of Uzbekistan, thousands of Rooks fly in steadily each winter even-
ing from the surrounding agricultural flatlands to use as a dormitory the
trees of Maxim Gorky Boulevard. At dusk, wave after wave of black shapes
flap steadily towards the city centre, like feathered bombers in a Hitch-
cock-style movie. The steadiness of their course, and their relentless num-
bers, are uncanny. After assembling on outlying trees the birds drop down
into the central roost as darkness falls. Next morning, below the trees
besides whitewash, pellets (castings) of indigestible grain husks, a few dead
birds are to be found. I can easily believe that as many as 10,000 birds
assemble nightly and that their catchment area has a radius of at least 15
miles (Boswall, in press).

bird photographs called In the World of Birds. It is the first of its kind and
was published in Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania, by Mokslas and com-
prises 280 pages, 382 colour stills and 160 distribution maps. It sells there
for 27 roubles and in Britain (Collets) for #35. The text and captions are
in English, Russian and Lithuanian. The driving force behind this publica-
tion, the like of which had never before been seen in the USSR, is a young
Lithuanian bird photographer called Algirdas Knystautas. Helped by
Arvydas Liutkus as co-author, and by photographers resident in the Soviet
Far East and in the Ukraine, "A 1" Knystautas has brought together in an
attractive volume facts and photos from the length and breadth of the
largest country on earth. The very first photo is of the Relict Gull Larus
relictus , a species first discovered for science as recently as 1968 nesting on
a lake called Alakol in south-east Kazakhstan, near the border with
western China. After a series of double-spreads that act as an aperitif, the
book groups the photographs by six regions of the Soviet Union: the
northern seas and islands, the tundra, the temperate zone, the southern
seas and lakes, the mountains of Central Asia and Ussuriland (near Vladi-
vostok) in the Soviet Far East. Ten thousand copies are said to have been
initially printed; just how many were sold to Soviet citizens and how many
to tourists in the hard currency shops it is difficult to know. The book was
reprinted in 1984 (5000 copies) and 100 were imported for sale in the
UK. To any western ornithologist the volume is of immense interest. Here
on page after page are not only birds of his own (capitalist) garden, but
also species he never dared to hope to see even in a book. There is Radde's
Leaf Warbler Phylloscopus schwarzi and Gray's Grasshopper Warbler
Locustella fasciolata , both at the nest in the temperate zone; and in the
far north the Great Knot Calidris tenuirostris , the Red-breasted Goose
Branta ruficollis and the Siberian White Crane Grus leucogeranus, a trio
of Soviet endemics.
Except for scientific treatises, few other popular books devoted to
birds can be found. A field guide, published in 1968, has not been reprin-
ted.
On the role of natural history in Soviet radio broadcasting, I know
a little. On Moscow radio, Igor D. Nikol'skiy, the State University researcher
in bioacoustics, has done about 75 five-minute pieces over the last 15
years under the generic title Native Nature. His little word picture for
January 1985, complete with a few bird voices, including that of Sabine's
Gull Lams sabini , was about the Chukotka peninsula on the 'home' side of
the Bering Strait, opposite Alaska.
In Estonia I have a friend called Fred Jiissi who is a freelance wildlife
broadcaster. He has a weekly spot called ABC of Nature which is broadcast
on Tuesdays at 7.00 p.m. Fred not only broadcasts regularly about birds
for Estonian radio, but also tapes their voices in stereo and publishes them

on gramophone records.
Birdwatchers in the USSR
Now available in the west is an English translation of the afore-men-
tioned Field Guide to the Birds of the USSR (Flint and others, 1984).
Princeton University Press commissioned a translation from a Russian
emigre, resident in Massachusetts, Natalia Bourso-Leland. As long ago as
1967, this lady accompanied the first (?) group of Americans to go bird-
watching in the Soviet Union. Such trips are nowadays quite common and
depart from several countries. A fortnight's package holiday in June to Ir-
kutsk, the old capital of Siberia (only a 40-mile drive from Lake Baikal) is
by no means unheard of. To anyone taking such a trip the new book
(which sells in the UK for #59.10, a high price) would be invaluable. For
particularly perceptive and helpful reviews of this book see Redman (1984)
and Wilson (1985).
One enterprising Swedish birdwatcher, during a birding trip that em-
braced Moscow, Irkutsk in central Siberia, and Frunze, the capital of the
central Asian Soviet republic of Kirghizstan, produced a 90-minute cassette
sound tape of 30-odd Soviet passerine bird songs and calls to help with
field identification. His name is Lars Svensson and he sells the cassette for

Birdwatching by Soviets is almost unheard of. The major exception is
the three Baltic states where maybe 200-300 birdwatchers are active.
But this is not to say that children and young teenagers are not inter-
ested and active. The Young Biologists' Circle of the Moscow Zoo recently
celebrated its 60th anniversary. It is said to have set a number of young
persons on the path to professional ornithology. There is also the Moscow
Society of Naturalists, a young persons' organisation organised under the
aegis of the Department of Vertebrate Zoology at the State University.
One of the lecturers there, Nicolai Formosov, takes six children out twice
a month to visit forests and lakes.
Other Soviet ornithologists may have been influenced in their youth
when members of the Komsomol (the Communist Union of Youth), an
organisation which encourages the erection of nest-boxes.
Soviet bird science
What is the state of ornithology in the Soviet Union? How many pro-
fessional bird people are there? Those of us who attended the 18th Inter-
national Ornithological Congress in Moscow in August 1982 were surprised
to find several hundred Soviet ornithologists descending on the Lomono-

hyper-active Eerik Kumari; from Verkhoyansk in north-east Siberia came
the trim and bearded figure of Yuri V. Labutin, well-known to me for his
work on the Little Curlew Numenius minutus, a Soviet endemic; from
even further east came the zoosome twosome Yuri Shibaev and his wife
Natasha Litvinenko, he a bird of prey expert, she a student of the Black-
tailed Gull Lams crassirostris\ from Alma-Ata in Kazakhstan came Dr.
Anatoly Serna who has studied the song of the Starling. Moscow acquain-
tances of mine included the shy and gifted Igor D. Nikol'skiy of the
Department of Vertebrate Zoology at the University; Victor Zubakin, a
behaviourist with a particular interest in gulls, and the ebullient Vladimir
E. Llint, a leading government nature conservationist. The total attendance
from east and west was of perhaps 800 bird students, ably shepherded by
the Secretary-General, Valery D. Ilyichev.
There are believed to be at least a thousand professional ornithologists
in the Soviet Union (out of a population of 270 million persons). These
full-timers work in the academies of science (one 'all-union', and one in
each of the fifteen republics), in universities, teacher-training colleges
(usually translated as 'pedagogical institutes') and in nature reserves. Many
of the amateurs, particularly those east of the Baltic republics, are persons
whose profession is in one branch of biological or medical science who
have birds as a hobby. Of all these 'birdmen', one seems, by the common
consent of professional and amateur alike, to be of pre-eminent ability and
devotion. His name is Vladimir V. Leonovitch and he works as an art his-
torian in Moscow's Pushkin Museum of Art. Lor more than half a century
he has been active as a field ornithologist. Untrained in science, but innately
talented, this tall, distinguished-looking, Lrench-speaking batchelor, now
just over 60, has such skill as a nest-finder that he is said to employ witch-
craft (!). He was long ago granted special dispensation under Soviet law to
build a scientific collection of eggs and birds' nests, provided he bequeathed
them to the Zoological Museum in Moscow. He is said to have one clutch,
at least, and often a series of clutches, of more than 500 Soviet nesters, all
beautifully preserved and painstakingly labelled. All have been taken per-
sonally. Leonovitch acquires none by exchange or purchase. His contri-
butions to the literature can be matched by no other amateur and (dare it
be said?) by few professionals. Among his major contributions is a paper
on the Red-breasted Goose, the symbol of the 1982 Moscow ornithologi-
cal Congress and, now, of the newly-formed USSR Ornithological Society
(Krechmar and Leonovitch, 1967). Also he has compared the origins of
the bird communities of the Kyzylkum (Red Sand) and Karakum (Black
Sand) Deserts of the south.
Valery Ilyichev and Vladimir Llint had intended to have ready by
August, 1982, for sale to delegates the first volume of their new, ambitious

work The Birds of the USSR (1982) but it was not to appear until later in
the year. A near miss. However, by dint of great personal effort, my long-
standing friend Boris Veprintsev did have available the gramophone
records (Veprintsev, 1982) designed to accompany the Ilyichev-Flint
volume. Thereby hangs a story. One of the many fascinating facts of
Soviet society concerns the distribution of goods. Take books on ornith-
ology. Each day at the Congress two or three different ladies would appear
each with boxes of new books and a portable table, and would set up shop
for as long as stocks lasted. Each lady would then disappear never to be
seen again, having sold buyers Volume 2 of this work but knowing nothing
of Volume 1, etc. The only way to cope with this problem is to keep a
day-long lookout and at each opportunity rush in, flood whichever woman
with roubles and grab two of everything you know, or suspect you don't
already have in your hotel bedroom. Later you can compare 'overlaps' and
'holes' with other collectors.
Boris's discs were on sale, but 10 minutes' walk from the site of the
Congress! The word soon got round and delegates hurried across to pur-
chase. I was tempted to buy 100 copies of each of the discs, set up my
own shop by the Congress noticeboard and sell at 10% profit. But I
allowed my Russian friends to dissuade me. There had been others who
had tried to introduce capitalist ideas.

son (in press).

A question that is often put to me enquires about a possible Soviet
society for the protection of birds. The answer has to be that in the USSR
there are, of course, no charities. The state tries to look after everything.
No organisation independent of the government could purchase land as a
nature reserve. There is, however, in each of the 15 republics a quasi-gov-
ernmental nature protection society. In Russia (i.e. the Russian Soviet
Federated Socialist Republic and easily the largest of the 15) 34 million
people pay 30 kopecs (about 30 p.) per year to the Russian Society for
the Defence of Nature.Quite a lot of money! Some is spent on education
and publicity; posters are produced for schools, bookmarks for adults.
Russians are avid readers so thousands of bookmarks are produced by the
society, each picturing an endangered bird. Other roubles go towards the
planting of trees and putting up of nest-boxes. Certain members are
trained as voluntary hunting inspectors who check licences, and try to
prevent poaching.
Article 18 of the Soviet Constitution reads: 'In the interests of the
present and future generations, the necessary steps are taken in the USSR

to protect and make scientific, rational use of the land and its mineral
and water resources, and the plant and animal kingdoms, to preserve the
purity of the air and water, ensure the reproduction of natural wealth,
and improve the human environment'. The extent to which the Soviet
government achieves this is not easy to assess. The current five-year plan
(1981-1985) set aside 10.3 billion roubles (roughly #10b) for nature
conservation (Sinyakov, 1983). It would be interesting to know how
it is spent, No doubt some is expended on endangered birds, though
much is said to go on water purification installations.

The idea of Red Data Books, that list endangered species has really
caught on in the Soviet Union. Several republics have produced them,
including White Russia and the Ukraine, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan.
The fully revised second edition of the overall 'all-union' work appeared
in March 1984, and treats (text, map and colour-painting) 80 birds, inclu-
ding exotic, surprising and mysterious species. One exotic bird is the Bar-
headed Goose Anser indicus that nests on high mountain lakes usually
under the protection of a colony of gulls - Brown-headed Gulls Larus
brunnicephalus in the Pamir mountains, for example. A surprising rarity
is the Shag Phalacrocorax aristotelis, a bird difficult for us to think of
as threatened. The most mysterious bird has to be the Slender-billed
Curlew Numenius tenuirostris . No nest has been found for about 50-60
years, but 800 birds were seen wintering in Morocco in 1964 and 123 in
1975. Migrants have been seen at irregular intervals over 40 years, the
largest group being 48 in the Crimea in 1975. The world population is
probably no more than a few dozen pairs.
The most famous rare bird in the USSR, as in the USA, is a kind of
crane. In the USA it is the Whooping Crane Grus americana, in the USSR
the Siberian White Crane Grus leucogeranus. The Soviet summer popula-
tion of the Siberian White Crane is 90 territorial pairs (not all necessarily
old enough to be breeding; cranes may not reproduce until seven years
old); including younger, non-territorial non-breeders the world total
comes to 300. And yet, on 15th FEbruary 1984, at Lake Poyang on the
Middle Yangtze, the Chinese claim to have counted 840 birds (Anon,
1984).
The International Council for Bird Preservation lists the following 14
Soviet birds as endangered (the Soviets themselves list 80 in the 1984
2nd edition of their All-Union Red Data Book):-

In 1982 I was invited to visit a bird show in Moscow and was taken
around by an English-speaking member of the Moscow Avicultural Soci-
ety, Irene Yershova. This experience I described earlier in the Avicultural
Magazine (Boswall, 1983).
Pigeons wild, pigeons tame
In the mountains outside Dushanbe, the capital of the Tadzhikistan
republic on the border with Afghanistan, I was lucky enough to see truly
wild Rock Doves Columba livia. A party of birds flew into a great cave in
the hillside where, according to my companion, Islom Abdusalyamov, they
nest alongside a pair of Eagle Owls Bubo bubol The Rock Dove is, of
course, the wild progenitor of the feral Street Pigeon, a bird which is
found in Soviet cities as it is in most of the cities of the world. In Alma-
Ata, the capital of Kazakhstan (next door to Tadzhikistan) on a very cold
mid-winter day, I saw scores of these birds fighting for crumbs with the
local Hooded Crows Corvus corone comix in the courtyards of old-style
wooden houses. In Samarkand, the legendary city conquered in turn by
Alexander the Great and by Genghis Khan, I visited the Sunday morning
ornamental pigeon market. Twelve or 15 sellers were there, the earliest by
7.30 a.m. Some were older Uzbek men wearing traditional ornamented

square skull caps and quilted, florally-decorated coats; others were younger
men wearing the drab clothes of the current generation. The pigeons were
of three main ornamental breeds: 'straight' Rock Doves but with orna-
mentally feathered feet; the brown breed known as the Jacobin, and a
strikingly black and white strain.
In certain cities in the USSR the sporting use of these birds is a well-
established feature of life in the Soviet Union. Moscow birds are taken by
train to such release points as Kiev (800 km) and Lvov (1,200 km). An
impressive route newly pioneered by the homing pigeon fraternity in
Odessa, the port on the Black Sea, is to transport the birds to Archangel,
the Arctic port on the White Sea! The flight home is over 2,000 km.
Using wild birds
Of the 700 plus wild bird species in the USSR, about 150 are of econo-
mic importance as objects of food and sport and as sources of material for
clothing. Willow Grouse, Black Grouse Tetrao tetrix and Quail Coturnix
coturnix are among the traditional game birds that are hunted for subsis-
I tence or sport, as are less familiar species like the Rock Partridge Alectoris
graeca and the Black-billed Capercaillie Tetrao parvirostris. Swans are
protected at all times but five kinds of geese are commonly shot including
the Brent Branta bemicla, the Whitefront Anser albifrons and the Lesser
Whitefront A. erythropus. Many kinds of duck may lawfully be taken, in-
cluding the Baikal Teal Anas formosa where it is numerous; so too may
various waders including three kinds of curlew and even the Collared
Pratincole Glareola pratincola. Pigeons, sandgrouse and rails (Coots Fulica
atra , Moorhen Gallinula chloropus and Corncrake Crex crex) are also
killed. In the Mediterranean tradition Blackbirds Turdus merula and
Fieldfares T. pilaris are trapped in Georgia. The eggs of Guillemots Uria
aalge may be taken under licence, and Eiders Somateria mollissima are
farmed for their down on the shores of the Baltic, White and Barents seas.
Grebes, divers and cormorants are taken for their 'fur'. This information is
summarised from Bannikov and Uspenskiy (1973).
In 1980, Soviet law in respect of wild nature was fully revised. A little
booklet (made of awful newsprint, as are most books in the USSR) sets

Let us take the case of a man who wishes to shoot a Capercaillie Tetrao
urogallus. He can legally do this in only one of two open seasons, autumn
or spring. If he chooses spring then he has to find out which ten days this
spring are 'open'. Game biologists advise the authorities according to
whether the season is early, late or normal (normal = 21st-30th April).
Secondly, he may shoot only a male and thirdly his bag limit is one bird in
ten days. Fourthly, he has to have a licence for that bird (and for up to

three Woodcock Scolopax rusticola a day or whatever), as well as his
personal hunter's licence. Lastly, he cannot shoot his Capercaillie cock
just anywhere - only in a specified area. For example, a nature reserve in
Kalininskaya oblast (county) 300 km from Moscow is surrounded by a
buffer zone in which Capers may be shot.
On arrival, the hunter has to report to an official and show his licence;
on departure he has to show his 'bag'. One hunter I met takes the sport so
seriously that he has rules for himself of almost self-flagellatory character.
He takes only a gun and axe and matches, makes himself a bivouac from
natural materials and sleeps rough!
Duck hunting is a real delight to - among others - the Politburo's highly
durable Foreign Minister, Andrei Gromyko, who is known to go shooting
while at his dacha (small country villa) at Vnukovo.
A brief mention of falconry is made in another article in this Magazine
(Boswall, 1985a).
Birds as pests
As in other countries, some birds are economically disadvantageous.
Most notably those that assemble on airport runways and give rise to bird
strikes. One method tried in the Soviet Union (as elsewhere) to reduce the
incidence of these mishaps is the local broadcasting of the distress cries of
the relevant species. The Soviet Ministry of Defence was involved in the
production of a gramophone record that includes recordings of the distress
cries of the Black-headed Larus ridibundus and Common Gulls L. canus.
Tellingly, it also includes the alarm call of the Starling and of four
members of the crow family, including the Rook. The record also includes
the agitated cries of the Bee-eater Merops apiaster. This bird is apparently
a nuisance to commercial bee-keepers! The USSR is the world's premier
honey producer. In the Ukraine, for example, the local apiarists hold that
the birds take too many bees. In Kazakhstan a detailed investigation was
undertaken in 1956 when 500 Bee-eaters were shot in order to assess their
diet. The birds were also consuming 'harmful' Eastern Hornets and the in-
vestigators concluded that on balance the birds were economically valuable
and should be afforded protection! The use of sound recordings to scare
them away from hives seems a sensible compromise (assuming it works,
which the record sleeve doesn't say!).
C onclusion
To sum up: in the Soviet Union birds have acquired roles, as they seem
to have everywhere else, in art and science, culture and economics, gas-
tronomy and sport, and in the giving of companionship and simple pleasure.

Postscript
Coincidentally, in the journal Falke in 1985 (32:166) there is a note
by Altaju Shatkanbatjew under the heading "Burkutschi - the falconer'
about falconry in Kazakhstan. The full text, translated by Michael G.
Wilson, to whom I am indebted for permission to reproduce his work, is as
follows:
'Falcpnry is one of the oldest forms of hunting. It was still widespread
in Kazakhstan at the beginning of the 20th century. The most important
of the falconer's birds is the Golden ('Royal') Eagle Aquila chrysaetos.
The Kazakhs call the falconers 'Burkutschi' which comes from their word
for A. chrysaetos - 'Burkut'.
The Golden Eagle is flown mainly at foxes Vulpes vulpes, V. corsac,
gazelles Gazella subgutturosa , antelopes Saiga tatarica and even wolves
Canis lupus. Experienced 'Burkutschi' can catch 20 to 30 foxes during
the course of a winter. The number of 'Burkutschi' has declined signifi-
cantly in recent years. In each of the 19 regions of Kazakhstan (2717.3 ha)
there are now scarcely more than two to three. Golden Eagles are found
throughout Kazakhstan, apart from the treeless deserts and steppes, but
have become rare in recent years and are in need of special protection. In
our country, considerable attention is now being devoted to the question
of conserving rare and disappearing animals and increasing their numbers.
It is to be hoped that the Golden Eagle will not disappear from Kazakh-
stan, allowing the national and noble art of falconry to be forgotten; far
better that new and genuine lovers of the sport, people with a profound
knowledge of the hunting birds, should continue the dying tradition.'

As some of the more 'mature' among my readers may recall, a pair of
Bullfinches Pyrrhula purrhula were almost the first birds that I kept as a
small child (Goodwin, 1952). As those were the only Bullfinches I have
kept, I feel some diffidence in writing an article on the species and its con-
geners. My excuse must be that the Bullfinch is a favourite bird of mine
and one I have watched a certain amount in the wild. I have seen other
species of bullfinches only as museum skins but the genus as a whole,
although small, is so distinct from other finches, so little known and above
all so beautiful that I thought I would touch on them all.
The line sketches that I have done in order to make the descriptions
more easily envisaged have no pretensions to art or to a minutely detailed
accuracy.
Description and distribution of the Bullfinch
The Bullfinch Pyrrhula pyrrhula is found throughout much of tem-
perate and northern Europe, from the Iberian Peninsula, Ireland and Scan-
dinavia to Manchuria, northern China and Japan. Many different subspe-
cies or geographical races have been described. Here, to save space and
tedium, I will only describe those races found in western Europe and the
more distinct among the races found elsewhere. Of these, the grey-breasted
P-P. cinerea and the Azorean Bullfinch Pp. murina may have reached
specific status although they are currently treated as races of P. pyrrhula
by those who consider themselves authorities on such matters.
The race of the Bullfinch found in Britain, P. pyrrhula pileata (formerly
P.p. nesa), is a shade smaller than a British or European House Sparrow
Passer d. domesticus, a little plumpish in usual outline but almost always
looking sleek and elegant. The cock has the back a slightly bluish grey, the
cheeks, breast and most of the underparts a soft pinkish red or pink. There
is much individual variation, from dull brick pink to a bright rosy red but
most often of a delicate salmon-pink hue. The hen has the back greyish
brown to chocolate brown, the cheeks, breast and most of the underparts
a light chocolate brown, often with a slight pinkish tinge. I have seen two
or three hens that had these parts brownish pink in colour. In both
sexes the cap and very small bib are black, the rump is white, and the
upper tail coverts, tail and most of the wings black, richly glossed with
blue and purple. The wings are crossed with a pale grey bar.

D. GOODWIN - BULLFINCHES
To save time, in describing other races of this species, the term 'breast'
will be used to include all those areas (see above and sketches) that are
pink in the British cock Bullfinch, when describing forms in which these
areas are concolourous.
In their first (juvenile) plumage young Bullfinches have the parts that
are grey, brown or pink in adults of a general light huffish brown tinge,
without any sign of the streaking that the young of most finches of other
genera show in their juvenile plumages. Their wings and tail are similar to
the adults' but they completely lack the black cap. They acquire adult
plumage in their first summer or autumn (depending on how early or late
they were hatched).
The nominate race of the Bullfinch P.p. pyrrhula from northern and
eastern Europe is appreciably larger than the British race. The cock has the
grey and pink parts of his plumage paler but usually also brighter than
cock British Bullfinches. The hen is also much paler, greyer above and
usually more tinged with pinkish on the breast. Up until the mid-193Os
these large, bright Bullfinches were imported into Britain in large numbers
for sale as 'Siberian Bullfinches'. Many of them may well have come from
Siberia.
The Bullfinch from central and western Europe, P.p. europoea, is simi-
lar to the British race but usually slightly brighter. In the Iberian peninsula
a rather small race, P. p. iberiae, occurs whose breast (the cock's) is much
brighter and redder than in other forms.
Bullfinches P.p. griseiventris, from parts of Japan, Korea, Sakhalin
Island and Ussuri, differ in the cock having the cheeks a very bright pink
but the breast and those parts of the underparts that are pink or red in
other races are grey, more or less tinged with pink. In P.p. kurilensis, from
the Kurile Archipelago and northern Japan, the breast is clear grey, contras-
ting strongly with the pink cheeks.
Most distinct is P.p. cineracea from the Northern Altai, parts of Mon-
golia, Amur and Manchuria. It is sometimes stated (e.g. Nielsen, 1981) that
in cineracea the sexes are alike but this is not the case. The cock has the
breast a clear pale grey; the breast of the hen is pale pinkish brown. In the
cock the back is grey without any trace of brown. The hen, though rather
grey above, like the hen of the nominate race, is tinged strongly with
brown on back and scapulars.
The Bullfinch P.p. murinae from the Azores, long thought extinct, and
probably not far off that unhappy state, ought probably to be given speci-
fic rank. Although it no doubt derived either from P. pyrrhula or some
form ancestral to them both, it shows the common (though not invariable)
comparative dullness and coarseness of island forms to a marked degree.
It has a proportionately larger bill and a dull greyish rump. In general

coloration it much resembles the hen of the British Bullfinch. It is usually
said that the sexes are identical in colour but this, once again, is not so.
Cocks have their breasts, underparts and flanks suffused with a reddish
tawny tinge that is lacking in the hens.

Descriptions and distributions of other species of bullfinches
In all species the wings, rump and tail are very similar in colour and
pattern to those of our Bullfinch and I shall not describe them except
where they differ appreciably.
These other bullfinches fall into two groups, which might be descrip-
tively termed the 'brown bullfinches' and the 'masked bullfinches'.
In the first group are two closely related forms, the Brown Bullfinch,
Pyrrhula nipalensis and the Philippine or White-cheeked Bullfinch P. leu-
cotis.
The Brown Bullfinch is found in the sub-Himalayan regions of Pakistan,
North India and Tibet east to North Vietnam and Taiwan and south to
Burma and Malaya.
At a first glance it looks like a rather obscurely marked hen Bullfinch.
The body colour is dull greyish brown. The cap and bib feathers are
blackish with greyish brown edges, giving a speckled effect. Behind the
eye is a small whitish area. As if to make up for the lack of any large
areas of red, pink or orange, the wing and tail quills show an intense
development of the wonderful bluish purple lustre common to the genus.
The visible (when wings and tail are folded) parts of the tail and primaries
are vivid purple, fringed with velvety black. The tail is proportionately
j longer and more strongly forked than in other species. The rump is strik-
ingly patterned with a white band 'sandwiched' between two jet black
areas (see sketch).

The Malaysian race P. nipalensis waterstradti has a paler and greyer
cap and bib, the individual feathers of these areas being grey with only
slightly darker central streaks.
The Brown Bullfinch is often written of as if it were sexually mono-
morphic. However, the sexes do differ. The small innermost secondary
has a red stripe on it in the male and a straw yellow one in the female.
Close up this is quite conspicuous to the human eye and no doubt much
more so to the pyrrhuline eye when its owner is in sexual mood. A cor-
responding but duller red mark is found on the same feather of the cocks
of those races of P. pyrrhula which have pink or red on the breast.
I SJS |Innermost secondary (visible part) of Brown Bullfinch. The
V he unshaded part of the inner web is red in the male, straw yellow
\&amp;} in the female.
The Philippine Bullfinch is sometimes treated as a race of the Brown
Bullfinch but I concur with those who think it best given specific rank.
It is, as its name suggests, found in the Philippine Islands. It differs from
the Brown Bullfinch in having the entire cap and bib glossy black, exten-
sive white cheeks, yellowish drab underparts, buff undertail coverts and
less highly ornamented wing and tail quills. The stripe on the innermost
secondary is red in the cock and pale orange in the hen.
In his important paper on the behaviour of the European Bullfinch,
Nicolai held the opinion that these brown species are more primitive than,
and ancestral to, the species that have large areas of pink, red or orange
plumage. I think, however, that in view of their common possession of a
'capped' head pattern and (to varying degrees) a tendency to conspicu-
ously differentiated cheeks in the cock, nipalensis and leucogenys are
more closely related to pyrrhula than are the masked species.
The Red-breasted or Beavan's Bullfinch is found from the Himalayas
to China and Taiwan. The cock has a black face mask narrowly outlined
in white. The rest of his head, mantle, upper breast and back are dull
grey. His lower breast is bright orange-red. The wings, rump and tail are
very similar to, and somewhat intermediate between those of the Bull-
finch and the Brown Bullfinch.
The hen has grey crown and cheeks, coffee brown mantle and back,
and paler coffee brown breast and underparts, except for the white ven-
tral regions and undertail coverts.
The Red-headed Bullfinch Pyrrhula erythrocephala is found only in
parts of the Himalayas and south-eastern Tibet. The cock has a black

face mask, orange-red crown and nape, the cheeks, breast and most of the
underparts vary individually from orange suffused with grey to rich
orange-pink. The back and mantle are grey. Otherwise the bird is very
likeP. erythaca.
The hen has a drab area on the forecrown, immediately behind the
black face mask. The rest of her crown and nape are a delicate yellowish
green, a unique colour among bullfinches. She is pale drab on the under-
parts and dark drab on the mantle and back.
While the foregoing species are all roughly about the size of the British
race of the Bullfinch, the beautiful Orange or Golden Bullfinch Pyrrhula
aurantiaca, from parts of northern Pakistan and the north-western Hima-
layas, is smaller.
The cock Orange Bullfinch has the usual black face mask (see sketches).
His wings, tail and ventral regions are very like those of the other masked
bullfinches except that his wing bars are pale orange and his long upper
tail coverts partly white. His body is a lovely golden-orange, slightly
darker on the head and back and slightly paler and brighter on the cheeks
and underparts.
The hen has a dull grey head (the black mask excepted), yellowish
fawn back and pinkish buff breast shading to light dull yellow on the
lower breast and flanks.
In order to save space I have not described the juvenile plumages of
these other bullfinch species. In all of them the juveniles show differences
from the adults comparable to those inP. pyrrhula and specific differences
are less marked than in the adults.

Remarks on presumed relationships of bullfinches
The three capped species, the Bullfinch, Brown Bullfinch and Philip-
pine Bullfinch, are completely allopatric. In some plumage characters
the Philippine Bullfinch is intermediate between the other two and I
favour treating all three as members of the same superspecies. The Azores
Bullfinch might best be raised to specific rank within this same superspe-
cies.
The range maps given by our fellow member, Dr. Colin Harrison, in his
stimulating book on bird distribution (1982) show apparent areas of over-
lap between the Orange and Red-headed Bullfinches, the Red-headed and
Red-breasted Bullfinches and between both of these latter and the Brown
Bullfinch. !
These maps are, however, necessarily small scale and it seems uncertain
whether any two bullfinch species actually breed in the same place. If
they do, one would expect to find differences of voice, behaviour or habi-
tat (or all three). So far as I know, such have not been recorded but that
means little as I know of no detailed study of any of these species.
Ecology and behaviour ofP. pyrrhula
These notes refer only to the Bullfinch in Britain and Germany, where
it has been much studied and where I have (Britain only) observed it. They
are not intended to be comprehensive and are biased towards what I have
myself seen. Anyone requiring fuller information, indeed anyone seriously
interested in this lovely bird, should also read Nicolai's important paper on
it and the relevant sections of Newton's excellent book on the European
finches.
The Bullfinch is a bird of deciduous, mixed and coniferous forest, prob-
ably under natural conditions in or near the forest edge or other areas
where there are bushes, shrubs, young trees and small open areas as well as
fully mature trees. In Britain it is found widely on the mainland, occurring
in most places where there is a combination of suitable bush and tree
cover for nesting, roosting and resting and where food is available. It often
breeds in churchyards, young conifer plantations, large tree- and bush-
grown gardens, and even in hedges in partially open country. It is often
said that it has increased greatly in recent decades and is now common in
towns and open farmland as well as in its former haunts. Well, although
the Bullfinch occurs in small numbers in some large town gardens or
parks with plenty of cover, it certainly cannot (in Britain) be thought of as
a town or park bird in the sense that Blue Tits and Blackbirds, let alone
feral pigeons and House Sparrows, are. As for the open farmland, I have
yet to see a Bullfinch (other than one passing in flight overhead from one
wood to another) more than 50 yards (and very seldom more than five)

from the nearest bush or tree, or a Bullfinch's nest in a farmland hedge
more than 100 yards from the nearest wood, coppice or orchard.
In captivity, and probably also in a wild state, Bullfinches pair for life
in their first winter or spring although earlier they may form temporary
pair bonds with a bird of either sex (Nicolai). In spring and summer wild
Bullfinches are usually seen in pairs, except for cocks whose mates are
sitting, pairs with flying young and recently bereaved individuals. In
autumn and winter one often sees presumed pairs, sometimes two birds
of the same sex, keeping company, and very often small parties of from
three to ten individuals. Such parties often show a preponderence of one
sex and this is not necessarily related to the general sex ratio in the area.
One may come upon a feeding group of, say, five hens and one cock and
then a half mile or less away another of, say, six cocks and two hens. The
largest party of Bullfinches I have ever seen was about 20 birds together.
The hen Bullfinch takes the initiative in pair formation by a symbolic
threatening of the cock, to which he, if sexually responsive, responds by
fluffing out his pink flanks, angling his glossy tail towards the hen, and
flying short distances from her in a peculiar manner. This display serves,
Nicolai discovered, to establish the cock's dominance over the hen; after
this,further courtship, which involves mutual bill-touching and later the
cock feeding the hen, can follow. If the cock is not interested, he flies
right away at the hen's first overtures but in captivity, where he cannot
do this, he is likely to be chased and beaten up by the infuriated hen. 'Hell
hath no fury .'. Nicolai found that a healthy cock Bullfinch has an
absolute inhibition against attacking or even defending himself against a
hen. This, of course, does not apply to Bullfinches that have been imprinted
on humans and are not reacting socially to their own kind. These may
actually kill hen Bullfinches misguidedly imprisoned with them, as did the
late Frances Pitt's famous 'Bully' (Pitt).
The Bullfinch nests in bushes, hedges, shrubs, young conifers and
climbers such as Honeysuckle. The nest is most often near the periphery of
the tree, bush or etc. and well screened by vegetation. This position makes
it rather difficult for a person to find although when in deciduous growth
it is easy to see once the leaves have fallen. The nest consists of two parts,
a shallow platform and surround of small twigs, and an inner cup of fine
roots and occasionally root-like fibres and horsehairs. The roots are often
collected from the ground on woodland paths and one can often see the
hen tugging at them while her mate, who accompanies her, appears only
to 'lend moral support'. In reality, his alert, not pre-occupied presence
probably lessens the risk of her being surprised by some predator when
busy collecting nesting material.
As with the Canary (when allowed to behave naturally) and many

D. GOODWIN - BULLFINCHES
other finches, the cock Bullfinch takes the lead in searching for a nest
site and calling his mate's attention to it but she alone builds the nest.
The contrary has sometimes been thought owing to the facts that the cock
has a sexual display in which he shows or presents symbolic nest material
to his mate and that he sometimes briefly sits and 'nest-calls' in a partly
built nest. The eggs, usually four or five, are pale blue with small dark
reddish markings which are usually concentrated in a zone round the
larger end of the egg. The hen alone incubates and broods the young, fed
by the cock. Both sexes collect food for the young when they are old
enough for the hen to leave them unbrooded by day.
The Bullfinch feeds primarily on seeds. Here, as elsewhere, I use the
term 'seed', 'fruit' and 'berry' in their everyday meanings regardless of
whether or not they would be technically so termed by the professional
botanist. Among other reasons for so-doing is that birds agree with the
'ignorant' non-botanist; seed-eating and fruit-eating birds, respectively,
take what the layman would call seeds or fruits regardless of, and some-
times contrary to, their botanical classifications. The Bullfinch eats a
variety of seeds from many species of herbaceous plants, shrubs, bushes,
trees and creepers. These include the seeds of some fruits and berries such
as those of the Honeysuckle, Rowan and Bramble. Captive Bullfinches
will sometimes eat fruit pulp but I have not seen any evidence of wild
birds doing so, though they may ingest some juice in the course of separa-
ting out and dealing with the seeds. I have not seen a wild Bullfinch
show any interest in a fruit, such as that of the Yew, whose seed was
clearly 'impossible' for it and Bramble seeds are not usually fed on until
winter when the 'blackberries' that contained them have dried and shri-
velled. Among plants and trees whose seeds are, at any rate in Kent and
Surrey, taken in quantity by the Bullfinch are the Dandelion, Sow Thistle,
Stinging Nettle, Meadowsweet, wild violets Viola spp., some docks (I am
afraid I do not know which species these are), Honeysuckle, Silver Birch
and Ash. Very hard seeds, such as those of the Hornbeam, so beloved by
the Greenfinch and the Hawfinch, do not appear to be taken by the
Bullfinch.
In late winter and early spring, the Bullfinch also eats buds, chiefly
flowerbuds of which the outer parts are discarded and only the embryonic
centres swallowed. Under natural conditions wild Pear, Hawthorn, Black-
thorn and Crab Apple seem among the most favoured and, unfortunately
for the Bullfinch, the often more nutritious buds of many of our cultiva-
ted fruit trees are preferred by it when available. Newton found that the
damage done in orchards depended largely on the supplies of Ash seed
available in late winter and early spring and that, in general, the failure
of the Ash to produce a good crop every second year resulted in a cor-

respondingly greater amount of bud-eating in such years.
Bullfinches prefer to feed perching on the tree or plant but will often
come onto the ground, especially on a path in or alongside a wood or cop-
pice, to feed from very low or prostrate plants or to search for fallen seeds.
They do not hold catkins, seed-heads and the like under one or both feet
when feeding, as Redpolls, Siskins and Goldfinches do, nor can they hang
upside down like the Blue Tit. They are, however, able to stretch upwards,
downwards or to either side to seize food with the bill to a remarkable
degree while still keeping firm hold of their perch. Very frequently one
can watch Bullfinches, Redpolls and a pair of Blue Tits all feeding in the
same seeding Birch, each species using different techniques and consequently
different movements and postures.
Dandelion seeds are often a major food, especially where these plants
are growing at the outskirts of a wood or along a woodland path. Unlike
the Goldfinch which prefers the ripe seeds of the fully opened Dandelion
'clock', the Bullfinch prefers them when they are already brown but
before the seed head has opened of itself. The bird bites through the
covering near the base of the (former) flower head to get at the seeds.
When feeding on Sow Thistle, especially if this is growing in a place a bit
too open for the bird's peace of mind, the Bullfinch often hovers prettily
to pluck a billful of vegetable down and seeds and carries them off to a
perch to deal with. I have also seen the Bullfinch hover in order to pick
(presumed) insects or other small invertebrates from the undersides of
leaves. So far as I know the Bullfinch and the Goldcrest (presumably also
the rare Firecrest but I have only once ever seen this species feeding and
then it did not) are the only British species to use this hummingbird-like
tactic.
Nicolai found that in his study area Bullfinches took no animal food
even when rearing young. This is, however, not everywhere the case. I
have seen Bullfinches in southern England that were undoubtedly collect-
ing small invertebrates though I was not able to be certain what. Newton
records caterpillars, small spiders and small snails as fed to the nestlings.
Rather surprisingly, the snails were de-shelled. I suspect that they would
not be so treated at the period of maximum bone growth of the young.
I The Bullfinch and Man
Man must have affected the Bullfinch, and all other birds, by his altera-
tions of the environment. Little or nothing is, however, known about the
Bullfinch in primaeval Europe, certainly nothing of its status in Britain
before man started messing around with things. I shall, therefore, here
confine myself to some brief notes on the interactions of the Bullfinch
with man in his role of bird keeper and &amp;apos;vermin' destroyer.

D. GOODWIN - BULLFINCHES
Its beauty, comparative 'steadiness' even when wild-caught, and the
ability of at least some hand-reared cocks to learn to pipe tunes, formerly
made the Bullfinch a popular cage and aviary bird. In the middle of the
last century, Mayhew found that it was a favourite pet bird with London-
ers. A good young Bullfinch then fetched from 2 shillings and 6d. to
3 shillings (more than many people then earned for a day's work) and a
piping bird 3 guineas. In my childhood in the late 1920s and early 1930s,
the price had only risen to 5 or 6 shillings for cocks and about half that
for hens.
Mayhew estimated that about 30,000 Bullfinches were brought yearly
to London for sale, many from the immediately surrounding country but
some from further afield. These figures seem rather dreadful but it is
doubtful if the worst excesses of the cage bird trade involved (in Britain)
more, if as many, Bullfinches as are now killed as 'vermin'. Newton (writ-
ing, or at least publishing, in 1972) states that on 'the average fruit farm' a
few hundred are killed annually but over a thousand on any Targe farm in
well-wooded country'.
Needless to say, any aviculturist who takes even a couple of young Bull-
finches would render himself liable to prosecution unless he has a licence
permitting him to do so. Which licence I do not think he would easily get
unless he had 'friends at court'. As I have no personal post-childhood ex-
periences of Bullfinch-keeping, I will say no more on the subject except to
hope that some of our members who do keep and breed this bird will tell
us of their observations on it, and to refer other to Nicolai's work.
Trapping in cage traps baited with seeding docks is the officially recom-
mended method of destroying Bullfinches (Newton) but the bird has been
much shot at in the past (and probably still is) and I think it is shooting
rather than trapping that has made the Bullfinch in Britain usually more
afraid of man than other finches (except the Hawfinch). Up until the very
recent past the Goldfinch was trapped at least as much as the Bullfinch
and it (the Goldfinch) is usually the least timid of our finches except for
the Redpoll and Siskin.
The Bullfinch is, apparently, much less afraid of man in Germany
(Lohrl, Nicolai). Lohrl indeed compares it with the Siskin for its trustful-
ness (Vertrautheit) and fearlessness (Furchtlosigkeit) towards man, a com-
parison that would certainly not be apt in any part of Britain where I have
observed these two species.
The Bullfinch, although timid, is not wary or suspicious. It is easy to
stalk and it often fails to notice the watcher if he or she is still. If, how-
ever, it does notice a human approaching, it will usually flee sooner than
would a Chaffinch, Greenfinch or Linnet and much sooner than would a
Goldfinch, Redpoll or Siskin. This is especially the case if it is on or near

the ground or in some open space. If it is feeding well up in a tree, it will
(at least in areas where it is seldom shot at) often allow the watcher to
approach more closely.
Bishop Mant (though he seems to have seen an unusually brilliant cock
Bullfinch) perfectly describes the bird's usual reactions to man in a verse
I cannot resist quoting:
Deep in the thorn's entangled maze,
Or where the fruit-trees thick'ning sprays
Yield a secure and close retreat
The dusky Bullfinch plans her seat:
There, where you see the clustered boughs
Put forth the opening bud, her spouse
With mantle grey and jet-like head,
And flaming breast of crimson red,
Is perched with hard and hawk-like beak,
Intent the embryo fruit to seek,
Nor ceases from his pleasing toil
The orchard's budding hope to spoil,
Unless with quick and timid glance
Of his dark eye, your dread advance
He notice, and your search evade
Hid in the thicket's pathless shade.
Bishop Mant's bird poems are 'spot on' for accurate observations as
j&amp;apos; here where he knew that the frightened Bullfinch nearly always flees
into thick cover. Other finches when disturbed by man either fly up
and away, or up into some tree.
Voice
Partly because of my ignorance of modern techniques of voice study
and partly to keep this article within what I hope are reasonable limits, I
shall not deal with this aspect of the Bullfinch except to say that most of
its calls are low pitched, often audible at a surprising distance in view of
their softness, and entirely pleasing. The same is true of its short song.
Nicolai (1956) deals in detail with the Bullfinch's voice.
The Bullfinch and the Jay: some intriguing parallels
The Jay Garrulus glandarius is one of many nest predators on the eggs
, and young of the Bullfinch. The two species are well apart in their feeding
habits. Apart from the fact that, at least in many parts of Britain, both
have man as their most potent and destructive enemy, they have in com-

mon that they frequent rather similar habitat. Indeed, if one made allow-
ances for size and mentally 'scaled down' (or up) the habitat when com-
paring, then one might say very similar habitat.
The Bullfinch shows four intriguing resemblances to the Jay which, if
they are not mere coincidence, must be adaptations to habitat in a broad
sense (certainly not to feeding behaviour or foods within that habitat),
and, if they are mere coincidence, are still more surprising. These are:

(1) The nest is built of the same materials and although not exactly a
miniature version of a Jay's nest (the twig portion is more plat-
form-like as a rule) is very near it.
(2) Both species have a white rump patch and a blackish tail, a com-
bination of features possessed by few other species of finch and by
no other species of jay.
(3) Both species have a bi-coloured ornamental innermost secondary;
black and dull red in the Bullfinch, black and chestnut in the Jay.
(4) Both species differ from most other members of their family in
that they usually flee from man into cover, not 'up and away'.

As the contrary is so often stated, it seems pertinent here to emphasise
that all races and all species of bullfinches are sexually dichromatic, even
if, to human eyes, some are more obviously so than others.

RECHERCHE ISLAND GEESE
Cereopsis novaehollandiae griseus
By DAVID CROMPTON
(The Wildfowl Trust, Martin Mere, Lancashire)

Although only comparatively recently 'rediscovered' as a separate sub-
species, the Cape Barren Geese from the islands off Western Australia were
given the scientific name Anser griseus Vieillot as early as 1818 (Vieillot,
1818). Frith (1982) suggests that the population of geese in the Recherche
Archipelago is no more than 500; thus it is one of the world's rarest wild-
fowl.
On a visit to the Australian Agriculture Department's Poultry Research
Station at Wembley in 1979, members of the Western Australian Wildlife
Authority Bird Committee viewed adjacent pens containing Cereopsis
stock from Tasmania, South Australia, and the Recherche Islands. The lat-
ter birds were readily distinguishable by coloration: their most noticeable
features were the greater extent of white on the crown and neck, the paler
pink of the legs, and the fact that the black of the feet extended up the
front of the leg as far as the 'knee'. An impression that the birds were
sturdier was verified by their heavier weights (Storr, 1980).
Of the eight birds in question (five males and three females) two pairs
were offered to the Wildfowl Trust and were received into quarantine late
in the autumn of 1982. A further pair was retained by Perth Zoo. Shortly
after release from quarantine, the pairs were divided between the Trust's
Slimbridge and Martin Mere reserves. During March both pairs nested, the
first eggs being laid at Martin Mere on the 15th and at Slimbridge on the
19th. At Martin Mere subsequent eggs were laid on the 17th, 19th, 21st,
24th and 25th when incubation commenced. At candling two weeks later,
all the Martin Mere eggs were found to be fertile but, sadly, the Slimbridge
ones were clear.
At the end of 35 days' incubation, the eggs were again examined and
although two had addled, four were still viable and on 2nd May, 39 days
after incubation commenced, there were four newly-hatched young in the
nest. These goslins were left with their parents for rearing and no problems
were encountered. In general they seemed stockier and darker, particularly
on the back, than 'normal' Cereopsis goslings. Sexing revealed that we had
two pairs. Growth rate and time to fledging were normal for the species;
however, as juveniles the voices of the Recherche birds seemed to be of a
higher pitch and remained so until they reached adolescence.
The youngsters were separated from their parents in September and

were sent to Slimbridge, one pair remaining there, the other going on
breeding loan to a private collection. The adult Slimbridge birds were
removed to Martin Mere. This pair started nesting again on 19th Novem-
ber, five eggs being laid up to 28th November, but again all were infertile.
On 11th December, the original Martin Mere pair laid once more and
started incubating on the 21st. Sadly, these goslings did not survive due to
inclement weather at the time.
A small experiment was carried out on the Slimbridge pair after their
second failure, involving feather clipping around the cloaca of both birds.
Obligingly this pair re-nested at 14 days, three eggs were clear but the
other two seemed viable, and one hatched on 5th March.
Of 20 eggs laid by two geese, the average weight has been 124.5 g and
the linear dimensions 78.3 x 53.7 mm. These measurements are not sig-
nificantly different from those of eggs laid by South Australian birds; a
larger sample produced by many more females is required.
Recherche Cereopsis seem to require no different management tech-
niques from the nominate race, but observations suggest that they are
less aggressive towards humans, even during the breeding season and at
the nest site, although other geese and ducks provoke territorial behaviour.
Apart from an incubation period four days longer than expected, the only
other peculiarity of the two imported pairs appears to be a reluctance to
moult; none has so far shed any flight feathers, although some body moult
has occurred.*

CONSERVING THE ALEUTIAN CANADA GOOSE AND THE
WHITE-WINGED WOOD DUCK AT THE WILDFOWL TRUST
By RALPH HODGSON
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.976740222222222" page_id="58080430"  page_num="160" year="" vol="">
(Wildfowl Trust, Slimbridge, Gloucestershire)
The Aleutian Canada Goose cannot now be classed as endangered but it
is certainly a rare species, particularly in captivity. Its sole habitat was the
1100-mile chain of Aleutian Islands stretching south and west of Alaska
where, in the early 1900s, they could be found breeding in thousands. In
attempts to develop fur farming, residents in Alaska released Arctic Foxes
on almost all these islands with the result that after World War II just a
handful of these geese could be found surviving precariously only on the
4000-acre island of Buldir near the Asian end of the chain. This island,
isolated, and with no harbour, had escaped the fur farming venture and the
US Fish and Wildlife Service decided that a fully-fledged endangered spe-
cies recovery programme was justified. A plan was formulated to clear the
major islands of Arctic Foxes and so increase the natural habitat and it was
decided to rear goslings in captivity in the USA for restocking the cleared
islands.
The first 18 goslings were taken on Buldir in 1963 and in 1966 the first
generation of captive Aleutian Geese hatched successfully. To reduce the
risk of disease and to spread the gene pool, several other breeders joined
the production efforts but the return of captive-bred geese to native nest-
ing grounds presented problems, one of which involved their winter migra-
tion, as no one knew where they spent the winter months. It was not until
1974 that this secret was resolved - they went to the northern coastal areas
of California.
Since then several hundred Aleutian Geese have been bred and reared in
North America and the programme of re-introduction on fox-free islands
has continued, together with interim protection on their wintering
grounds. In 1967 the US Fish and Wildlife Service sent a pair of Aleutians
to the Wildfowl Trust on breeding loan and subsequently a further male
and two females were received from America. As far as we know, these are
the only Aleutian Geese to come to Europe.
The first pair bred at Slimbridge in 1973 and have bred every year since
then, a total of 82 reared over 12 years . There are now (January 1985)
over 50 Aleutian Geese alive in Europe and of those originating in the
United States, only the original pair still survive, now 18 years old. The
remainder are held in the various trust centres and by a limited number
of recognised breeders.

The White-winged Wood Duck is in rather a different category. Its
natural habitat is the rain forests of Asia, in particular Assam, East Pakis-
tan and Thailand. This habitat is being gradually destroyed and the prob-
lem is to ensure the permanent protection of sufficient natural habitat to
justify survival and possibly re-introduction from captive-bred stock.
The first White-winged Wood Ducks to arrive at Slimbridge were wild-
caught in Thailand in 1955 and consisted of six males and four females.
In those days our aviary accommodation was limited and we also had con-
siderable difficulty in finding the right food. The birds survived but we had
no success in breeding and the last one died in 1961. Then, under the aus-
pices of the World Wildlife Fund, we received two consignments from
Assam in 1969 and 1970, which gave us four pairs of these very rare birds
from which are descended all the present population in Europe and the
USA.
To reduce the risk of disease, young birds have been distributed on
breeding loan to other Trust centres and recognised breeders, including
the Jersey Wildlife Trust. This latter Trust has been very successful and has
already sent back to the Wildfowl Trust a number of young birds. We now
have over 100 of this species registered in our Stud Book and within the
next year or so we should be in a position to plan a programme for re-in-
troduction to a suitable habitat in its natural homeland. We have also
been able to send about four pairs on breeding loan to the United States,
where they have already had considerable breeding success. In 1984 we
were able to send birds to Hongkong and Thailand and thus establish a
breeding nucleus close to their natural habitat.

THE FEEDING AND BREEDING OF THREE PO ICE PH ALUS
PARROTS IN CAPTIVITY AND IN THE WILD
By NEVILLE BRICKELL

I wish to list some findings by aviculturists on nesting, and by ornitho-
logists on feeding, in the hope that it may fill some gaps in Forshaw's
splendidly lavish work, Parrots of the World.
Blancou suspected that the Niam Niam Parrot P. crassus nests during
the August-September rains. Nothing is known of its breeding habits in its
natural state. In Mozambique three recently caught adult birds were placed
in an aviary measuring 2.4 m (8 ft) high, 1.5 m (5 ft) wide and 3.6 m
(12 ft) long. Banana leaves were fastened to the wire netting on the sides
of the aviary to give the birds as much privacy as possible until they had
become accustomed to their new home. The birds were not disturbed,
except to place the food and water just inside the door. After two months
the spare bird, which was being mercilessly pecked by the other two, was
removed and placed in a flight with a Brown-headed Parrot.
Nest-boxes and natural logs, which contained observation holes at the
back, were hung up at the far end of the flight. There was no activity from
the birds, which were assumed to be a pair, for three weeks. They were
then seen to enter the natural logs four or five times a day. A single egg
soon appeared, with three others being laid at daily intervals. Only the
female incubated. The male spent long periods in the nest during the day.
Only three chicks hatched^ the first hatched at 27 days and was covered
in a fine greyish white down. Both adults fed the chicks, which left the
nest at 13 weeks after hatching. They were strong on the wing within a
few days but were dependent mostly on the male for food for the next
two weeks, returning to the nest each night with the female to roost.
These parrots feed on a variety of seeds. Stomach contents revealed
partly digested millet and pale yellow seeds. Nothing further seems to
have been recorded in the wild. In captivity they accepted a basic diet
of two parts sunflower seed and one part mixed canary seed. Fruit given
consisted of apple and orange, with no interest shown in guava and plum.
Greens eaten were beans, peas (in the pod) and cabbage stalks as well as
corn-on-the-cob (maize). The young were reared on putu, a favourite
food of the local Africans which is made by boiling maize meal in water
until the water evaporates causing it to form into lumps similar to that
of dry porridge. They also had hand-baked bread dampened with water
or goat's milk.

N. BRICKELL - THREE POICEPHALUS PARROTS
Though the Ruppell's Parrot Poicephalus rueppellii is common, little
is known of its nesting in the natural state, except for three records,
namely: in the nest-hole of a Baobab A dansonia digitata&amp;apos;, the dead branch
of a Brachystegia tree and in an Acacia in what appeared to be an old
woodpecker's hole. Breeding has been recorded in February (three eggs),
May (chicks in nest) and June and September (juveniles collected) and
August (chicks in nest). Further information was gathered from a success-
ful aviary breeding. Four eggs were laid on a layer of decayed willow pulp
in a standard-type parrot nesting box. Incubation, which lasted 30 days,
started when the last egg was laid. Only the female brooded though the
male sat in the nest-box with her during the day; both parents fed the
chicks. The young left the nest at five weeks but did not fly for some
time, only roosting above the box (pers. comm. Coetzee). This early
departure may be due to a disturbance at the nest. The duration of a
second nesting period was 58 days (Nelson, 1974). Adult plumage is
acquired approximately 14 weeks after leaving the nest (pers. comm.
Abrey, 1980).
This parrot feeds on seeds, fruit and buds and shoots. It has been
recorded feeding on the seeds of Leadwood Combretum imberbe, Blue-
thorn Acacia erubescens, Ana tree A. albida and Sweet-thorn A. karoo
as well as its golden-yellow blossoms, and shoots and seeds of Ele-
phant's Foot Elephantorrhiza . Fruit in the form of wild figs Ficus and
seeds of wild melons. In captivity, the daily diet may include spinach,
peas in their pods, stalks of cabbage, young lettuce, thistle and Brus-
sel sprouts; also the green shoots of Blue Gum and Silver Oak. Fruit
such as apple, orange, peaches, soft pear, figs, plums, soaked raisins and
currants; also shelled ground nuts and corn-on-the-cob.
Many nests of the Meyer's Parrot P. meyeri have been recorded in
recent years, giving information on nest measurements, clutch sizes and
growth of chicks but the incubation and nestling periods have not been
acurately measured in the wild. Aviculturists have indicated the incuba-
tion period at 29-31 days and nestling period at eight to nine weeks.
Recorded feeding on the pods, fruits or nuts of Narrow-leaved Mahoboho-
bo Uapaca nitida , Pale-fruited Monotes Monotes glaber, Russet Bush
Willow Combretum hereroense, Rough-leaved Rasin Grema flavescens,
Manila Sclerocarya caffra , Kudu-berry Pseudolachnostylis maprouneifolia,
Buffalo-thorn Ziziphus mucronata, Syringa Melia azedarach, Cross-berry
Grewia occidentalism flowers of Weeping-boer-bean Schotia brachypetala,
seeds of Brachystegia and other leguminous trees and it is suspected that
the seed pods of Black monkey-thorn Acacia burkei are eaten. Occasion-
ally troublesome in cultivation, feeding on maize, sorghum and millet.
They also raid orchards as they are fond of oranges and figs.

GRASS-CARRYING DISPLAY IN THE BICHENO FINCH
Poephila bichenovii
By A.J. MOBBS
(West Midlands)
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.999373944444444" page_id="58080436"  page_num="166" year="" vol="">
Nowhere in the literature can I find a description of grass-carrying in
the sexual display of the Bicheno Finch.
Having recently observed two cocks in my collection carrying out this
procedure, I felt it should be recorded.
Both cocks had been housed with a hen in their respective breeding
cages for two weeks and the hens had already begun to lay their first
clutch of the season. In each case, a nest-box had been provided, first
being filled with a mixture of soft hay and coconut fibre hollowed out
to form a nest-hole. Also a small amount of nesting material had been
placed on the floor of each breeding cage.
The courting display was as described by various authors (Cayley, 1932;
Morris, 1958; Goodwin, 1982; Immelmann, 1982), except that the exces-
sive bill-wiping (described by Morris) has yet to be observed, although
this behaviour, in a more subdued form, has been seen from time to time.
The courtship display of one cock bird when the hen was introduced
can only be described as perfunctory as the cock was seen to bill-wipe
no more than six times in approximately 60 seconds, after which he
mounted the hen and copulation took place. The cock was silent through-
out.
Mating has not been observed in the second pair; however, the cock is
extremely vocal (for a Bicheno Finch) and can be heard and seen singing
many times throughout the day.
When the grass-carrying sequence was observed, in both cases the cock
bird was displaying from a perch opposite to that of its respective hen,
the latter appearing to take little interest in the performance.
Both cocks chose a piece of dried grass some 200 mm in length and
it was noticeable that the grass selected was unlike that which would be
used for nest-building in that it was somewhat thick and not in the least
pliable. The cocks were not observed taking up the grass, but were first
encountered when the grass was already being held in the beak. Through-
out the sequence, both cocks faced their respective hens. Both cocks were
seen to give a series of bows with the beak held in a horizontal position
at all times. As the birds became upright after each bow, the legs were
stretched to their utmost and the feet appeared (on occasions) to leave the
perch slightly (no more than 3 mm). The grass-carrying sequence, as I ob-
served it, lasted for approximately two minutes in both cases, after which

the birds released the grass allowing it to fall to the cage floor. Because I
entered the birdroom when the sequence was already underway, I feel
that both birds may have ceased the activity described through distur-
bance rather than because the sequence had been completed. As both
cocks were already carrying out the grass-carrying sequence when 1 entered
the birdroom, it is impossible to estimate the length of time the sequence
may be carried out.
Perhaps it should be mentioned that throughout the grass-carrying pro-
cedure, both cocks were silent.

Despite a rather cold and wet start to 1984, the number of species and
individuals bred was approximately the same as in the previous year. The
majority of birds in the collection are now captive-bred, being either
hatched here or in other collections.
Almost all of those species which breed in colonies are in groups which
are entirely or mainly composed of captive-bred individuals. For example,
the colony of Black-footed (Jackass) Penguins now numbers 19, and of
these 13 were bred here, nine being handreared. One bird, 'Cherry',
hatched in 1977 and our first successful handrearing, has herself paired
and laid. These eggs have been artificially incubated and the chicks subse-
quently handreared. Thus our worry that a handreared bird might not
breed has been dispelled. For this species the main advantages in taking
away the eggs are that egg-stealers are defeated, and there can be greater

control over incubation and the diets of the chicks. Although hand-feeding ;
is hard work and involves the careful preparation of food, it is still worth-
while. Four birds were reared in this way in 1984.
Of those species breeding in colonies which rear their own young, the
most noteworthy are the Abdim's Storks and Chilean Flamingos. The Ab-
dim's Storks nest on platforms 7 ft (2.14 m) from the ground in an en-
closed aviary, and the Chilean Flamingos nest on the Three Island Pond on
an area where the nest sites are separated from the public by a series of
waterways and small islands. In both cases it is enjoyable and educational
for visitors to watch the birds caring for their young. Of the Abdim's Stork
group, all 20 birds were captive-bred, 14 of them at London, including
four this year. The Chilean Flamingo colony is now composed of 41 birds
of which at least 20 are captive-bred, and of these 18 were bred here, in-
cluding five this year.
A success of particular interest was the handrearing of a Bateleur Eagle.
On a bitterly cold day in January the Bateleur Eagle laid her egg in an
untidy nest of twigs which was balanced precariously on a platform in the
back of the aviary. By 20th January, because of the nervousness of the
female and the weather conditions, it was decided to take the egg away to
the safety of an incubator. Here it was kept at a temperature of 36.5-
37.5*C with a relative humidity of 50-55%, and turned manually five
times daily. On 29th February the first signs of hatching were seen when a
minute crack appeared at the blunt end of the egg. The egg, still in the
incubator, was placed on damp towelling in a wire box and the humidity
raised to 60-70%. By then the chick could be heard faintly calling from
within the egg, but little movement could be detected. The chick was in an
abnormal position inside the egg, and so on 1st March a few pieces of
shell around the crack were gently removed. On the following day at 12.00
a fragile looking chick was helped out of the shell. The total incubation
period had been 55 days. On 3rd March the tiny chick, weighing only
109.9 g, was put into a human incubator at a temperature of 34.6*C. At
14.10 on the same day the chick, still weak and incapable of holding its
head up, received its first meal - selected pieces of freshly killed mice
dusted with a vitamin/mineral supplement. Over the following weeks the
chick grew slowly but steadily. At its last weighing, when nearly 10 weeks
old, it weighed 1990 g, not much less than its father. The plumage of the
young bird is mainly a golden brown and it will probably be at least six
years and repeated moults before the black, white and chestnut plumage
of the adult develops.
Other noteworthy breeding successes included the artificial incubation
and handrearing of a Stone Curlew (parents captive-bred at the Norfolk
Wildlife Park and kindly presented to the Zoo in 1982), four Crowned

Cranes, 13 species of galliform, including a Vulturine Guineafowl, Bamboo
Partridge, Koklass, Scintillating Copper, Blue Eared, Grey Peacock and
Bronze-tailed Peacock Pheasant, and six species of waterfowl including
Brent Geese and Hawaiian Geese.
Parent-reared birds included an Oystercatcher, three of the rarely-bred
Ruppell's Parrot, five Rock Peplar Parrots, five Sacred Ibis, and sue species
of owl, including, for the first time in this collection and very rarely else-
where, the White-faced Scops Owl.
By the end of 1984 it was obvious that the Bird of Prey aviaries, built
in 1910 from a design by the architect-trained Curator of Birds, David
Seth-Smith, had come to the end of their life, and would need to be demo-
lished.
The aviaries had lasted, virtually unchanged in shape and size, for
nearly 75 years. There is some sadness at losing the aviaries, which have
been such a prominent feature of the Zoo for a long time, but their
removal was inevitable.
Of the birds housed in these aviaries and elsewhere, we aim to keep at
least seven potential breeding pairs - Egyptian Vulture, Black Kite, Brah-
miny Kite, Long-legged Buzzard, Bateleur Eagle, Harrier Hawk and Com-
mon Buzzard - and a small number of individuals. Most will be kept, at
least for a while, in the Eastern Aviary and Sothern Aviary. Altogether
we still have 11 species of raptor.
By the end of 1984, potential homes for the birds of prey of which we
would need to dispose, had been found. These included other zoos and
private collections, and in some cases single birds had the opportunity of
joining other single birds of the same species.
More and more co-operative schemes for the management and breeding
of various species are being put into effect and as part of these schemes
a number of birds were sent to other collections, or were taken in on loan.
Examples of such movements included the despatch of 12 Grey-headed
Gulls to Berlin Zoo, and the receipt of breeding pairs of Congo Peafowl
from Antwerp Zoo.

A NOTE FROM EAST BERLIN ZOO
Pair of Harpy Eagles with young in East Berlin Zoo
In a letter dated 27th February 1985, Dieter Minneman of the Tierpark
Berlin writes: 'This year we have had in Berlin a very hard winter. The
temperature was for a long time minus 20 degrees Celsius. It gave some
problems with my birds of prey. Some kinds, e.g. condor, vultures and
eagles, I had to put into heated accommodation. Some of my species
from cold areas, e.g. Himalayan Griffon Gyps himalayensis, Bearded Vul-
ture Gypaetus barbatus and Bald Eagle Haliaeetus leucocephalus are be-
ginning to breed. My pair of Harpy Eagles Harpia harpyia hatched a young
one on 17th January. One week before a young African Fish Eagle Hal-
iaeetus vocifer hatched in an incubator. This I believe may be a world

NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ALMA-ATA ZOO

Despite the fact that New Year's Eve is celebrated in the grand manner
in the Soviet Union, and alcohol there is not entirely unknown, two orni-
thologists (Anatoly Gistsov and Ernar Auezov) turned up promptly, as
promised, at 11.00 a.m. at my hotel on 1st January, 1985, to escort me
on foot to the Alma-Ata Zoo. Alma-Ata is the capital city of the Soviet
Republic of Kazakhstan, and lies only 200 km from the border with the
Sinkiang province of the People's Republic of China.
January temperatures average -8* Celsius here but December 1984 had
seen days with -30* and New Year's Day was -20 . Mixed flocks of Car-
rion Crows of the "Hooded" race Corvus corone cornix and feral Rock
Pigeons Columba livia hustled in the yards of the wooden houses for
breadcrumbs sprinkled on the snow there by housewives.
In the grounds of the Zoo itself, scroungers were commoner. It was
feeding time for the hardier waterfowl, kept outside. Three species of Old
World Swan, Cygnus olor, C. columbianus and C. cygnus, White-fronted
Geese Anser albifrons , Bar-headed Geese Anser indicus, Mallard Anas
platyrhynchos and so on were crowded into a small area of open water
surrounded by ice. But much of the grain thrown down for them must
have ended up in the crops of 50 Hoodies, a hundred House Sparrows
Passer domesticus and at least a score of Laughing Doves Streptopelia
senegalensis and the one Collared Dove S. decaocto.
Other water birds were confined in heated houses. In one such house
were assembled Coivnoitmts Phalacrocorax carbo, Spoonbills Platalea leuco-
rodia, Grey Herons Ardea cinerea, Cattle and Little Egrets Bubulcus ibis
and Egretta garzetta, Black Storks Ciconia nigra and White and Dalmatian
Pelicans Pelecanus onocrotalus and P. crispus.
The gulls that shared the house were of particular interest to me. Not
only was there a Lesser Black-backed Lams fuscus (a long way from its
wild home for so indistinctive a bird!), and its more easily explained
cousin the Herring Gull L. argentatus, there were two adult Great Black-
headed Gulls L. ichthyaetus, one in apparently full summer plumage
and both 12 years old. This species I had previously seen in winter plu-
mage in Abu Dhabi, but the memory in no way lessened the pleasure
of the resplendent New Year's Day bird. Even more exciting was to set
eyes on a living Relict Gull L. relictus (another of the so-called "hooded"
gulls) with a Black-headed Gull L. ridibundus standing right next to it

for easy comparison. Both were in winter plumage. The bird was pointed
out to me, appropriately enough, by Ernar Auezov Ernar is a truly local
ornithologist, an ethnic Kazakh, a shy man with immense knowledge of
Kazakh birds. It was he who in 1968 discovered the Relict Gull, a j
species new to science, having found a colony of them on a tiny island in
Lake Alakol, a salt lake about 340 m above sea level.
By now (13.00 hours) Valery Khrokov, a professional wader enthu-
siast, had joined the party as had the Curator of Birds at the Zoo, Ikar
Borodikhin. With justifiable pride Ikar showed me the Zoo's birds of
prey. An egg was expected to appear that day or the next in the "nest"
of a pair of Lammergeiers Gypaetus barbatus. In 1983 the female had
laid on 27th December. Since 1972 this pair has reared a total of nine
young. Himalayan Griffon Vultures Gyps himalayensis numbered four,
Black Vultures Aegypius monachus also four. The Zoo's falcons included
a trio of beautiful Lanners Falco biarmicus and several Sakers F. cherrug.
The four Gyr Falcons {F. gyrfalco of Soviet taxonomy) had been taken by
Borodikhin as eyasses from an eyrie on the Yamal Peninsula in the Arctic
Ocean. Two Central Asian Peregrines (F. pelegrinoides of Soviet taxo-
nomy) completed the quartet of handsome long-wings.
Two Steller's Sea Eagles Haliaeetus pelagicus were present and four
White-tailed Eagles H. albicilla. The largest flight cage held five Imperial
Aquila heliaca and eight Steppe Eagles A rapax.
One of the four Golden Eagles A. chrysaetos was a bird trained for
falconry (a form of aviculture, of course), by one of the Zoo's keepers,
Abilkhak Turlibaev. During his one month's vacation in the previous
(1983-4) winter, at a location about 150 km from Alma-Ata, he had flown
the bird daily while himself mounted on horseback! The quarry? Red
Foxes Vulpes vulpes , of which, during four weeks, his bird caught 13.
Abilkhak's father was both shepherd and falconer - and a commercial fal-
coner in the sense that he sold the fox skins to supplement his winter in-
come. With the passing of the older generation this practice is dying out,
though Albilkhak guesses that there may be a hundred such shepherds left
in the Kazakhstan and maybe twice that number next door in the neigh-
bouring Kirghizstan Soviet Socialist Republic. As recently as the 1950s a
thousand such birds were involved in this remarkable example of com-
mercial falconry. The record-holding eagle captured 300 foxes in one
year. A few birds are flown at mountain wolves Canis lupus.
Meanwhile back at the Zoo it was 15.00 hours and I was now joined by
the Assistant Director of the Zoo (a lady) and by an interpreter. After
looking at parrots, pheasants, cranes and ratites, we were served with
coffee, biscuits and syrupy cherry jam and many of my questions were
painstakingly answered. Ikar Borodikhin, who is also a student of wild

birds, presented me with a copy of his (1968) paperback book on the
birds of Alma-Ata. A helpful chart appended to the usual systematic
textual treatment of species allowed me to tot up 46 species normally
present in January. Of these, I had seen, by 17.00 hours, only 10 and of
these only the Laughing Dove was a "new" bird. Given more days' resi-
dence in the city than three, I would have gone in search of the Red-
fronted Serin Serinus pusillus, the Brown Dipper Gnclus pallasii, the
Brown Accentor Prunella fulvescens, the White-winged Spotted Wood-
pecker Picoides leucopterus and others. Next time, perhaps.
Next time also I would like to establish closer contact with the orni-
thologists at the Kazakh Academy of Sciences' Institute of Zoology where
the bird work is directed by Edward Gavrilov. He has at least ten pro-
fessional bird people working under him. Besides the three already men-
tioned there is Anatoly Serna whom I had met at the 18th International
Ornithological Congress in Moscow in 1982. To him and other workers
in the bird section I presented the first three volumes of the Birds of the
Western Palearctic (paid for partly by the sale in the U.K. of Soviet bird
song gramophone records given to me on previous visits to Moscow), and
I received in return no less than 25 volumes on Soviet, mainly Kazakh,
birds. These are now in the Edward Grey Institute Library at Oxford,
where some of them will be used by Michael G. Wilson (a Russian-speaking
British ornithologist) in compiling certain species accounts for Volume 5
et seq. of the Birds of the Western Palearctic. It would appear that I was
the first Western ornithologist to visit Alma-Ata within living memory and
to contact these scientists on their home ground. With so much work going
on, Alma-Ata must surely rank as one of the more active ornithological
centres in the USSR? To judge from the references sections of their papers
they have a better knowledge of our literature than we of theirs.
At 18.00 hours each of us went our separate ways. It was the end of a
freezing but enlightening day.
Except that . In bed I flicked through the Kazakh Red Data
Book they had given me. It was Volume 1 on vertebrates. It included 43
birds, starting with two pelicans, two herons, two storks, a spoonbill, an
ibis and a flamingo. Threatened Steppe birds included the Demoiselle
Crane Anthropoides virgo, the Great Bustard Otis tarda , the Little Bustard
Tetrax tetrax and the Houbara Chlamydotis undulata. Rare All-Union
endemics for which responsibility falls largely on Kazakhstan are the
Sociable Plover Chettusia gregaria, the Relict Gull and Pander's Ground
Jay Podoces panderi. The endangered Kazakh bird that I would most like
to see is the Ibisbill Ibidorhyncha struthersii, a strange bird of the pebbly

closest I have so far come is to see a film of the species made by a resi-
dent of Alma-Ata, Vyacheslav Belyalov. This species was also ingrained
in the memory of my interpreter-guide. She had once served a party of
British birdwatchers who had not only got her to search for the Ibisbill
through pretty unforgettable terrain, but had got her up before dawn
three mornings in a row!
Time to close the book; but I won't be getting up before dawn!

breeding biology of African shrikes. The Slate-coloured Boubou Lani-
arius funebris and other bush shrikes are the subject of a comprehensive

The species has suffered a drastic decline in recent years and it is hoped
that the ducks will be released in Kiskungsag National Park. Slimbridge has
also sent two pairs of White-winged Wood Ducks Cairina scutulata to a

In the past few years, mention has been made in this column of new
discoveries in the bird world. Yet another has been discovered, this time
on a remote coral atoll off the coast of Sudan. The species concerned has
been christened Red Sea Cliff Swallow Hirundo perdita but a great deal
still remains a mystery for the type specimen was found as a corpse on the
atoll. A thorough search of skins at the British Museum (Natural History)
failed to find the bird and it was duly given the specific name of perdita
(meaning lost) which refers to the fact that the bird was either a migrant
or a vagrant. Speculation now surrounds the locality where the bird will
eventually be found to be resident but top of the list is the hills of Ethio-
pia where a number of new species have been discovered in the last 15
years or so ( BBC Wildlife Magazine).

A natural spin-off from the avicultural aspect of birds is observing them
in their natural habitat. It is a pastime I enjoy for, besides learning more
about birds, it is also very relaxing. Having watched birds on four contin-
ents, I have always been happy with whatever happened to be in the local-
ity at the time. I must admit that a record is kept of the species seen but
in no way do I consider myself a 'twitcher'. Many people are, however,

Blakiston's Fish Owl Ketupa blakistoni is the subject of an excellent
feature article in the March 1985 issue of BBC Wildlife Magazine. The
account, written by Dr. Mark Brazil contains valuable facts about this

ever, to see a scientist advocate the initiation of a captive breeding pro-

Malcolm Ellis writes about the November-December 1984 issue of
Swara, the magazine of the East Africa Wildlife Society, which has the
cover adorned by a beautiful coloured photograph of a Great Blue Tour-
aco. Inside are more photographs, illustrating an article by Mhorag Candy,
about her study of this, the largest of the touracos, until now little-studied
in the wild.
According to the brief biolgraphical notes about the author, a full
account of her study has been published in th q Journal of the East Africa
Natural History Society and National Museum and currently Mhorag
Candy is writing up her study of Ross's Touraco.
In the previous issue of Swara, in an article about the traditional head-
dresses worn by Masai and Samburu youths, following their circumcision
ceremony, Daniel Stiles estimated that in the period from 1980 to the
end of the century, 2,400,000 small birds may be killed in Kenya and
used to make these head-dresses.

Dispensed with at the end of the youth's* healing period, some three
months or so after the ceremony, each head-dress may be made from the
skins of as many as 40 birds. Species used include the Superb Starling,
kingfishers, orioles, the Rufous-crowned Roller, Black-headed Bush
Shrike, Red and Yellow Barbet and different weavers.
The dead birds of various species, mixed together, seemingly without
any set patterns and all with their wings closed, are laid side-by-side,
around a halo-like wooden frame. Then, as a finishing touch, some Ostrich
feathers, which have been picked up on the plains, may be added to com-

only female being christened Old Blue because of the colour of her leg
band. In the intervening years the population has risen to approximately
30, but, sad to say, Old Blue is now dead. Aged 14, she was commemora-
ted in the New Zealand Parliament, the first such honour accorded to an
individual bird by any government anywhere.

A perfect example for the argument of keeping species pure and not
culturing for abnormal forms, either by mutation or hybridisation, is high-
lighted perfectly in horticulture. The familiar 'African Violet' Saintpaulia
ionantha, so often propagated as a house plant in many forms, is con-
sidered by some to be extinct in its native Tanzania. This obviously raises
the point of how pure some of the cultured stock is. Horticulture is noto-
rious for its ability to come up with new varieties of almost any plant in a
very short time but are we, as aviculturists, capable of the same thought-
lessness. Birds present more difficulties but we seem to have done a per-
fect demolition job on the Budgerigar's form and colour. A lot is preached
about captive breeding as an aid to conservation and justifiably so,as it is
an indispensable tool but I just wonder how pure species like the Splendid
Parrakeet, and for that matter, other species where breeding of colour mu-
tations is on the increase, will be in 20 years' time in relation to their ori-
ginal wild form and colour. Are Cockatiels and several lovebirds due to
follow the Budgerigar?

VISIT TO CHESTNUT LODGE, COBHAM,
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9762826" page_id="58080448"  page_num="178" year="" vol="">
On 1st June 1985, some 70 visiting members and guests enjoyed the
generous hospitality of Miss Ruth Ezra and Mr. Raymond Sawyer at their
beautiful home in Surrey. The weather was warm and sunny and Raymond
escorted us around the aviaries - a continuous scattering of mealworms
gave us closer views of his avian favourites. Although early in the season,
the impressive breeding results at Chestnut Lodge were already enough for
us to appreciate the care and expertise needed for their achievement.
A superb pair of Violaceous Touracos, successfully bred last year for
the first time in Britain, again had two well-grown young. Other species
with young included Kookaburras, Emerald and Amethyst Starlings and
Rothschild's Grackles. Previous successes with waders had been repeated,
and three species - Avocets, Black-winged Stilts and Ringed Plovers - had
young. Hopes were high for Stanley, Crowned and Demoiselle Cranes, all
of which had eggs. An elegant pair of Golden-breasted Ground Doves,
which had successfully bred iast season, were incubating.
The number of interesting and unusual species to be seen included
Malayan Black-crested Jays, Bhutan Long-tailed Mynahs, Long-tailed
Sibias and a Timor Sparrow. Keas which had bred last year were nesting
and other psittacines nesting were Dusky and Stella Lories. In the garden
aviaries, Toco Toucans, a Scarlet Cock-of-the-Rock and some delightful
Egyptian Plovers were much admired. On the lake a pair of Pacific Brent
Geese had repeated their annual success with six goslings. Cuban Flamin-
goes, in brilliant colour, made a wonderful contrast for the geese as they
paraded on the lawn bordering the lake.
A really marvellous afternoon ended with tea on the lawn, and the
visitors sat for a long time chatting in the sunshine and watching the full-
winged cranes displaying.
Jeffrey Trollope
On behalf of everyone present, we would like to thank Miss Ezra
and Mr. Sawyer very much for working so hard to give us all such an
enjoyable afternoon. It was also particularly generous of Miss Ezra to
donate the proceeds (#164 including donations) to the Society's funds.
The loyal support and interest of these two Vice-Presidents is very much
appreciated by all members of the Society.

BIRDS OF THE CAYMAN ISLANDS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996041105263158" page_id="58080449"  page_num="179" year="" vol="">
By Patricia Bradley. Published by the author, Cayman Is., 1985.
245 pages. 72 colour photographs. ISBN 0903826 763.
Distributed in U.K. by Law Reports Int., Trinity College, Oxford
Everyone interested in birds, be they aviculturist or ornithologist, will
eventually purchase a field guide to the birds of a certain geographic
region. One soon realises that almost without exception these contain no
photographs, but paintings. One exclusion will be reviewed here, for I was
so impressed with Patricia Bradley's Birds of the Cayman Islands that I
decided to take a pen to hand and give my opinion - something that I
rarely do for a book.
Published by the author this year, the book consists of 245 pages. The
foreword is by HRH the Duke of Edinburgh, with a preface by Dr. Oscar
Owre, MaytagProfessor of Ornithology Emeritus and Professor of Biology
at the University of Miami, Florida. That these two distinguished gentle-
men would permit their names to appear in the book alone elucidates its
extolled nature.
Indubitably the most unique aspect of the book is the photographic
portfolio of all the breeding birds of the islands. Each of the 72 colour
photographs is equally superb; indeed, placing one above the other would
be an almost impossible task. My favourites are of the Bananaquit Coereba
flaveola, which I have watched several times in the Caribbean, and of the
Cayman Island Amazon Amazona leucocephala caymanensis , for which I
travelled there specifically to observe last year.
Most of the photographs were taken by Yves-Jacques Rey-Millet,
though 11 are by the author.
The first 20 pages of actual text describe the islands, conservation, a
list of endemic and nonbreeding birds, etc. This area contains a glossary
and the topography of a bird - a pertinent point for a person unaquainted
with field ornithology.
The aforementioned is followed by 162 pages describing all of the birds
on the Cayman Islands. Particulars are divided into several headings, des-
I cribing such details as field characters, status and habitat. This is certainly
the most valuable area..
The remaining pages consist of two appendices and an index.
This IVi x 4 3 A in. hardcover book is not only a must for a visitor intent
on bird-watching in the Cayman Islands but is so outstanding in its con-
tents that it deserves a place on every bookshelf. Certainly it has one on
mine.

AUSTRALIAN PARROTS - A FIELD AND AVIARY STUDY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.975821675" page_id="58080450"  page_num="180" year="" vol="">
By B. Hutchins and B. Lovell. Published by the Avicultural Society
of Australia. 185 pages. ISBN 0959298320. Obtainable from J. Buchan,
14 Driftwood Drive, Cden Waverley, Victoria 3150, Australia, price 18.00
Australian dollars, including packing and posting by surface mail to any-
where in the world.
During the past decade several books have been published dealing with
parrots endemic to Australia. The most recent work by Barry Hutchins
and the late Bob Lovell, is undoubtedly the most useful to aviculturists,
although ornithologists will find it equally applicable in the in-depth cover-
age.
The book sets itself apart from predecessors in more than one way. It
deals with 36 species and 22 subspecies of Australian parrots, of which the
authors have kept 33 and nine respectively. Of these, 25 species and seven
subspecies have bred in their aviaries, making them uniquely qualified to
write on their subject. Between them they have observed every psittacine
discussed, save for the Paradise Parrot Psephotus pulcherrimus and a race
of the Northern Rosella Platycercus venustus hilli.
This treatise excludes cockatoos, Fig Parrots, Eclectus and a few other
genera but their absence does not detract even a modicum, for these are
either not common in aviculture or have been the subject of other books.
The space that would need to be devoted to those few species has been
converted to a comprehensive coverage of parrots that are better known
in aviculture (save for certain cockatoos and Eclectus).
This softcover book contains no colour plates; the co-authors wanted
to place pertinent details in the pages that these would consume.Ergo, the
185-page work is full of very valuable details on each of the species in
field and aviary. In addition, particulars on management, housing, aviaries,
feeding and diseases are included.
Some may consider the absence of plates a debit, but I cannot concur
with such an observation. There are numerous books that contain excel-
lent colour photographs or illustrations of the birds - and these books
could be used as a reference by those unfamiliar with the appearance of
Australia's parrots.
Maps are provided for every species and several subspecies.
This book was launched on 17th May 1985 by Graham Shotter, direc-
tor of the Royal Melbourne Zoological Gardens, during the opening cere-
mony of the 3rd National Avicultural Convention, in Melbourne. In the
course of his address, Shotter described the book as '.quite clearly a
remarkable publication.'.

shrieked out the knowledge of the authors. Certainly, the last paragraph
in Ron Hasting's foreword bore testimony. He wrote the most fitting
accolade: This excellent book will undoubtedly become a standard
reference on the parrots of Australia and I highly recommend it to all
bird-lovers, whether their particular interest be aviculture - or the wider
field of ornithology'.
I thoroughly agree with Hastings.

THE DICTIONARY OF AVICULTURE - Keeping and breeding Birds
By Richard Mark Martin. Published by Batsford, London, 1983
240 pages; 93 line drawings. Price - #7.95. ISBN 0713441569
Richard Mark Martin is an experienced professional aviculturist who
obviously researched a great deal when compiling this book - an alpha-
betically arranged reference work giving details of breeding, rearing, and
general care of birds in captivity - 'pure' aviculture, to quote the author's
own words.
Although many species of birds are included, it is impossible to in-
clude every known species, so for this reason only those known in avi-
culture are documented.
The dictionary commences with Accipitridae and ends with Zygo-
dactyl and most 'terms' used in aviculture are to be found between these
entries. General entries include: management, accommodation, diet,
breeding, disease, etc., and is illustrated with the author's own excellent
line drawings.
Cross referencing is used throughout which I personally found un-
necessary, but those inexperienced in avicultural jargon - the beginner
particularly - will find this useful, and glean much information from its
pages. This book, however, will undoubtedly find a niche on the book-
shelf of both the beginner and the experienced aviculturist alike.

Race of Amazon Parrot new to Aviculture
In 1984 a previously unknown subspecies of a very well-known
Amazon Parrot was introduced to aviculture. The Marajo race of the
Yellow-fronted Amazon was virtually a myth, being known only from
two skins. Its validity was doubted by some.
In August of last year, when I was in Florida, Ramon Noegel
showed me a photograph of two birds supposedly of this race, Amazona
ochrocephala xantholaema. It had been given to him by a Brazilian
aviculturist who had visited him a few days previously and depicted
two captive birds. Never having seen skins or photographs I was in-
trigued and obtained a photograph of the photo.
A couple of weeks later a well-known British aviculturist telephoned
me with the news that he had been offered birds of this race which were
then on the Continent.
The following month I received a letter from a well-known animal
collector in the Netherlands containing absorbing news. He wrote: 'On
my recent expedition to Brazil I found a good number of xantholaema in
the Paru river area. I observed several flocks, some of them containing
about 25 birds, and obtained some of them.
This is a large bird about the size of a Double Yellow-head. Its wing
measurement is 235 mm and the tail 123 mm. Weight is 530 g. It has the
crown, lores and cheeks yellow and some birds also have yellow extend-
ing to the nape and with red feathers over the yellow areas. The bend of
the wing is blood-red. The bill is larger than in the Yellow-fronted Ama-
zon.
They have a green band on the forehead, like the blue band of the
Blue-fronted Amazon but smaller - from about Vi cm up to 1 cm (the
wing speculum is red).'
The photograph from the Netherlands depicts the beak as being
larger than that of the Yellow-fronted; the upper mandible is horn-col-
oured and dark grey and the lower mandible is dark grey. The thighs are
green, yellow nearest the foot.
Its appearance is more reminiscent of the Blue-fronted Amazon
aestiva from the photograph. Perhaps this race can be used as evidence
that ochrocephala and aestiva form a superspecies.
Taxonomy aside, the introduction of xantholaema into Europe is a
most interesting event. There are now three birds in the UK so hopefully
this race will be breeding here within the next few years.
Culmhead, Somerset Rosemary Low
P.S. Since writing the above, I have seen xantholaema in two collections and have been
informed that this subspecies was in a private collection in Europe several years

The Lemon-breasted Canary
I read with interest the letter by Eric A. Clewlow on the Lemon-
breasted Canary Serinus citrinipectrus in Vol. 90, No. 3, of the Avicul-
tural Magazine. In Durban Museum Novitates, Vol. 6, Part 4, 1960,
P.A. Clancey and W.J. Lawson state that 'in October, 1959, Mr. C.H.
'Jack' Scheepers, of Bela Vista, Maputo, southern Portuguese East Africa,
trapped about 40 examples of an unknown species of canary of the
genus Serinus Koch during the course of a big-game collecting safari to
Manguyane, near Panda, in the Inhambane district of Sul do Save. Most
of the canaries remained in Mr. Scheeper's aviaries until late August,
1960, when many of them were studied at close quarters by members of
the Durban Museum staff during the course of our recent ornithological
expedition to southern Portuguese East Africa. While the duty of describ-
ing the new species to science has fallen to us, full credit for the initial
discovery of the species must be given to Mr. Scheepers.'

Trichoglossus and Glossopsitta lorikeets wanted
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.958863214285714" page_id="58080453"  page_num="183" year="" vol="">
I intend to do a taxonomic revision of the two lorikeet genera Tri-
choglossus and Glossopsitta. To be able to make the revision I must
have access to living specimens of the birds. I am interested in all the
species and subspecies of the two genera except: T.h. haematodus, T.h.
mitchellii, T.h. forsteni, T.h. capistratus, T.h. moluccanus, T. euteles,
T. omatus and T. (G.) goldiei.
The birds will not be killed or harmed during or after the investiga-
tion. I am a breeder of lories and lorikeets myself so the birds will be
taken good care of. All importations will be handled separately by
commercial quarantines. The revision is supported by the Zoological
Institution of Lund, Sweden, and has a non-commercial status with
possibilities to make importations direct from Australia.
I hope that Avicultural Magazine readers may help me to get the
birds I need.

A general note on rearing exotic pheasant chicks and ducklings
and how their down patterns affect this
The article on this subject by my old friend and colleague, Derek
Goodwin (Vol. 90, 1984, No. 2, p. 112) stimulates a reply.
As a breeder of a wide variety of pheasants and exotic waterfowl over
many years, reared by both natural mothers and by foster-parent Bantam
hens, I should like to quote a few of my own observations and exper-
iences.
The fact that the young of every species of waterfowl and pheasant
has its own patterning could suggest a case for either identification or
camouflage. Identification seems to be stronger by the parents when the
chicks are more grown, for broods mix easily when first hatched but not
when the young are over a week old. Obviously camouflage plays a part
in the first few weeks of life when the chick is weak and vulnerable.
Instinctive behaviour activity on hatching being acceptable to both
parent and young determines the strength of the relationship more than
the patterning, and vocal communication develops and strengthens the
bond as the chick develops. If the chick is of a different colour, it is
accepted if it conforms actively and vocally. For example, pheasant
chicks, as soon as they are strong enough, need to leave the nesting site,
for on dispersal they are less vulnerable to predators, and the pheasant
hen follows and vocally intercommunicates with the chicks to keep the
group loosely together and they can rejoin her for brooding. This is the
time when most chicks are lost from wandering out of hearing range of
the mother, and it is also the time when foster parent broody hens have
problems brooding their foster pheasant chicks, unless they are confined
to a small coop, where the chicks cannot wander far from the broody
hen. After a few days, a bond is formed, or a routine is entered into that
is acceptable to both foster parent and chick. Sometimes foster parents
have a hard time, for on the other hand there are pea-chicks who await
the every move of their foster mother and even will not feed without her
encouragement, regardless of the choice of food. These two extreme
cases emphasise the need for steady, reliable, proven foster hens, and I
find Pekin Bantams are of the all round best. Even the most reliable
little Pekin hen will not accept new alien chicks after the 4th/5th day
from hatching, if they are not identical in shape and colour to her own,
of whatever species.
The young of each species has its own behaviour pattern fixed. Thus
if one species of, say, du ck hatches another's ducklings and their actions
after hatching differ, then confusions arise and this weakens any prelimi-
nary relationship, until after a few days they drift apart and the duck-

lings die without the protection and brooding of the mother duck. Some
ducks lead their broods and other species follow their ducklings and keep
contact by frequent vocal calls. Instinctive behaviour is a survival kit
dictated by the environment in which they live and it cannot be changed.
Abnormally coloured chicks would not suffer to the same extent
except that they may be more visible to predators.
The Muscovy duck mentioned by Derek Goodwin is an example.
Although extremely tolerant, through its long association with man, it
cannot adapt to the set behaviour patterns and voices of the ducklings it
hatches, and although they are first-class incubators, they make very in-
different mothers and resent being moved or confined. I have had them
hatch and, for the first day or two, tolerate pea-chicks, guinea fowl
chicks, Black Swan cygnets, geese, etc., and rear domestic ducks but I
would never risk valuable ducklings with them unless they could be con-
fined and controlled, and they are too casual for me.
I too, as Derek Goodwin mentions, have had a Red Jungle Fowl hen
hatch partridge Silkie chicks, and kill all of them with a peck on the head
because of the bump where the future crest would be, although vocally,
actively and in patterning they would be the same as her own chicks. An
extreme case of intolerance occurred this year.A full-winged pair of
Moluccan Rajah Shelduck hatched 11 ducklings which I thought was
rather a lot for her to brood, for the nights were chilly at the time and
this was her first brood. So I decided to remove six ducklings and give
them to a reliable Pekin hen who had been sitting for two weeks on
dummy eggs. I put them under her in the late afternoon and shut her up
in a coop so that the inside was dark and she could hear but not see the
ducklings, so enacting the hatching process. The following morning,
when opened up for feeding, she had fully accepted her strange brood of
heavily marked ducklings, but what was as important, they had accepted
her. Since they were hatched under their natural mother and paraded
round the enclosure subject to her vocal commands, this goes to prove
that identification between mother and duckling in the first few days
after hatching is not too strong but is much stronger when the bond has
been formed after four or five days of association.
I am glad to report that all 11 were reared safely, both made excellent
parents and the ducklings were grouped together again at three to four
months old.
I do not recommend the mixing of broods although in the early stages
it is possible, but if left too long together, there is the danger of bonds
being formed, sometimes very difficult to break, and subsequent hybridi-
sation. Hybridisation between any species can be attempted if the young
are reared together. I believe in keeping the species pure and maintaining

When I appealed in th q Avicultural Magazine (Vol. 90, 1984, No. 1) for
help in obtaining a complete set of Avicultural Magazines, I could not have
foreseen such a magnificent response from one of our greatest supporters.
Dr. Lee Lenz wrote promptly from California, offering to donate a com-
plete set of bound volumes, to be placed in the library held by the Avicul-
tural Society in the Linnean Society's Library at Burlington House, Picca-
dilly, London. The books have now arrived and as soon as a special book-
plate has been stuck in all of them, they will be placed in the Library
where they will be available for reference by all members of the Society
who have Library tickets (#2 per year, available from this office).
I know I can speak on behalf of the President, Council and all members
of the Society in expressing our deep gratitude to Dr. Lenz for such a
valuable gift which will be appreciated and used by many of our members,
both now and in the years to come.
May I renew our plea for Magazines to make up the second set of
Avicultural Magazines held here at Ascot, which is used continually by
the Editor? The missing issues were listed in my original appeal.
If anyone has bound volumes of any year that they wish to dispose of,
either by sale or gift, I would be very glad to hear from them.

THE FOREIGN BIRD FEDERATION (BRITAIN)
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993443153846154" page_id="58080457"  page_num="187" year="" vol="">
The Foreign Bird Federation was formed in 1984 to represent British
national and area societies specialising in the keeping of foreign birds. Its
aim is to involve itself in subjects of mutual concern and interest to keepers
of this group of birds, and in aspects which probably no individual society
could undertake alone, particularly with regard to future legislation.
The response has been very good and nearly all area and national
societies, including the Avicultural Society, are now affiliated to the Fed-
eration. Its Council is elected at an Annual Delegates' Meeting and its
members are chosen to be as broadly based as possible. Two members of
the Avicultural Society's Council are currently serving on the Federation's
Council - Mr. R. Oxley (Chairman) and Mr. David Coles.
In addition to putting aviculture's case to the Ministry of Agriculture
and the Department of the Environment, the Federation is establishing a
central record of birds bred in Britain. The member societies will con-
tribute their members' breeding returns for collation in a main register
which will not only be a very interesting record, but a valuable reference
when talking to the government about measures which might seek to limit
the importing and keeping of foreign birds in this country. The breeding
register is being collated by Mr. D. Bardgett, 216 Skipton Road, Keighley,
West Yorkshire.
As an aid to breeding, an 'Exchange and Mart' scheme has been started
through which breeders can obtain mates for odd birds and this is already
proving very successful. The object of the scheme is to assist private avi-
culturists and owners of public collections in disposing of or obtaining odd
birds to make up potential breeding pairs. It does not apply to British
birds or any of the domesticated foreign species. Further details of the
scheme may be obtained from Mr. B.C. Rawson, 6 Elm Grove, Old Arley,
Coventry CV7 8NT.
The Council of the Foreign Bird Federation believes that the first steps
towards strength through unity have been taken but only time will tell
whether or not the current format is the correct one and, no doubt, indi-
vidual aviculturists will hold different views on the matter. Any thoughts
ideas or even constructive criticism are always welcome and can be put
forward to any Council Member or direct to the Secretary, Mr. C. Stevens,
Monks Cottage, 58 Preston Crowmarsh, Benson, Oxfordshire. Mr. Ste-
vens will also supply copies of the constitution, mandate and general
rules (a stamped, self-addressed envelope would be appreciated).

BREEDING THE LESSER VASA PARROT
Coracopsis nigra
AT CHESTER ZOO
By P. JAMES
(Assistant Curator of Birds)

<bodyText confidence="0.99130128" page_id="58080467"  page_num="197" year="" vol="">
As reported in the 1983 November issue of th e Avicultural Magazine,
Chester Zoo obtained two pairs of Lesser Vasa Parrots from Switzerland in
June 1982. On completion of their quarantine period, the birds arrived in
the Zoo in mid-August, to be housed in an aviary which had been specially
built for them. This aviary measures 50 ft x 20 ft x 10 ft high (15.25 m x
6.10 m x 3.05 m high), is south facing and gives the birds as much privacy
as possible without actually taking them off show.
Three weeks after receiving the birds in the Zoo, one was sadly lost to
a stoat; steps were then taken to prevent this happening again. Although
nest-boxes were present during the 1983-1984 seasons, only slight interest
was shown in the boxes by our three remaining birds. The aviary was
broken into overnight on the 11th November 1984 and one of the females
was stolen never to be recovered. It was then decided to contact the
supplier again and he sent us two males and one female in exchange for
surplus parrots from Chester. Finally we purchased a female from a dealer
in England to make our stock up to three pairs.
The new birds completed their quarantine period on 4th April 1985,
after which all six birds were housed together in their purpose-built aviary.
No aggression has been observed in keeping these birds in a colony system.
From the day they were all introduced into the aviary there has been a
lot of display in the group, with the females chasing the males around and
appearing to be the dominant sex.
We first noticed that a female was missing in the morning on 29th July
1985, and she remained in the box all that morning. She disappeared again
for the morning on 31st July. During her time out of the nest-box there

P. JAMES - LESSER VASA PARROT
was a lot of activity in the aviary with all six birds. The first mating that
we saw took place on 4th August and, from staff observations, the hen
started sitting properly on 8th August. During the time that she was sitting
we did not go near the nest-box but fed the birds at the other end of the
aviary. When the female came out to feed there was a lot of display, chas-
ing and feeding with the female calling continuously. On 26th August, I
inspected the nest-box and observed two chicks and two unhatched eggs;
the chicks appeared to be about two days old. From laying the first egg
on 29th July, until the chicks were seen was 28 days; from the day when
she started incubating properly, on 8th August, was only 18 days so I am
not sure of the true incubation period, although I think it could be about
24 days.
Of the four nest-boxes the birds were given, they chose a 'grandfather
clock' style of box which measured 8 ft high x 1 ft 2 in deep x 1 ft 2 in
wide (2.44 m x 30.10 m x 30.10 m). This was filled with peat and wood
chippings on a 50/50 ratio to about 4 in (0.11 m) below the entrance hole.
The first chick fledged on 30th September and the second on 1st
October. On fledging, the young parrots resembled the adult birds, except
that they had horn-coloured bills, a very pale grey ring around the eye and
a pale grey tip on the tail feathers. The youngsters were fed exclusively by
the female with the male showing little interest in them at all.
We believe that this is the first breeding of this species in the United
Kingdom.
As described above, the Lesser Vasa Parrot or Black Parrot Coracopsis nigra has
been bred at Chester Zoo and this is believed to be the first success in this country.
Anyone knowing of a previous breeding in Great Britain or Northern Ireland, or of
any other reason that would disqualify this claim, is asked to inform the Hon. Sec-
retary.

Corvus imparatus
IN CAPTIVITY

In late January 1985 we received a letter from Mr. William D. Toone,
Assistant Curator in Ornithology at the San Diego Wild Animal Park
(California), stating that he wished to find a new home for the park's six
"Mexican Crows" Corvus imparatus. Our work on jays (e.g. Hardy, Webber^
and Raitt, 1981) had prompted Dr. Amadeo Rea, Curator of Birds at the
San Diego Natural History Museum, to suggest to Mr. Toone that we might
be interested in keeping these crows in captivity to study their behaviour.
We were indeed interested and had, in fact, been making plans to study
birds of the two populations of so-called Mexican Crows, both in captivity
and in the wild.
These two populations are isolated from each other by at least 300 km.
One, the "Tamaulipas Crow", inhabits the eastern coastal plain of Mexico
from northern Tamaulipas south to Veracruz and San Luis Potosi, while
the other, the "Sinaloa Crow", inhabits the Pacific coastal plain from
southern Sonora south to Nayarit. Anatomically, the two forms are vir-
tually indistinguishable, except for possible statistical differences in the
lengths of their tails (Johnston, 1961), and for this reason have usually
been considered to be a single species. Davis (1958) first recognised the
remarkable difference in the voices of the two forms: that of the Sinaloa
Crow is a gentle falsetto ceow (Fig. le), while that of the Tamaulipas Crow
is a gravelly low-pitched croak (Fig la-d), likened by many people to that
of a frog. Because of this difference in their voices, Davis (ibid.) con-
sidered the two forms to be separate species, the eastern population re-
maining C. imparatus , and the western population becoming C. sinaloae.
Ornithologists (see for instance A.O.U., 1983) have tended to disagree
with Davis's declaration. An exception is Goodwin (1976) who treats
the two forms, with some hedging, as separate species. Field students
familiar with both forms are likely to be impressed by the difference in
their voices, and enjoying the addition of a species to their life list, to
think of them as distinct species.
Since little is known about the behaviour and breeding of Mexican
Crows, we eagerly accepted Mr. Toone's offer.

History of the Captive Flock
Dr. Rea informed us that US Government officials had confiscated
these six crows and 13 others in 1977 at the US-Mexican border, from
persons attempting to import them and claiming that they were "fruit
crows" or cotingas, hence not protected! There is no record of where
they were caught or how old they were at the time. The authorities
turned them over to Dr. Rea, who kept them in a cage on the roof of
the San Diego Natural History Museum. While they lived there one of the
birds escaped through a small hole in the cage and lingered nearby where
it could often be heard calling. Dr. Rea found that the escapee got at
least part of its food by coming to the cage, where the birds inside passed
food to it through the mesh. He also found that the escaped bird roosted
in the cage at night, coming and going by the hole through which it had
escaped. He recaptured it one night by closing the hole when it was inside
the cage.
In the early 1980's, Dr. Rea gave the birds to the San Diego Wild Ani-
mal Park, where they lived in a small cage out of the public's view. Thir-
teen of the 19 birds died between 1977 and 28th February, 1985, when
the survivors came to us.
Only three were of known sex when they arrived, but two of the others
formed a pair and bred the same spring. Dr. George V. Kollias, of the
University of Florida College of Veterinary Medicine, laparotomised the
sixth and found it to be a female.

We colour-flagged the crows on both tarsi as follows: males - Blue-Blue
(Bl-Bl), Green-Green (G-G), and Orange-Orange (0-0); females - White-
White (W-W), Pumpkin-Pumpkin (P-P), and Yellow-Yellow (Y-Y).
Our aviary was designed by and constructed for the late Dr. Franz
Sauer in the 1960's. It is 12 m long x 5 m wide x 4 m high (39/4 ft x 1614
x 1314 ft approx.) and is covered with 14 in mesh hardware cloth. It is divi-
ded roughly in two across its width by a hardware cloth partition with a
gate in it. In three upper corners of the aviary we placed shelters, each
with a roof about 1 itT, walls on two sides, and two perches. We placed a
hardware cloth nest platform, 45 cm with a 5 cm-high parapet, in one of
the shelters in the east chamber, where it was about 3.5 m (1114 ft) above
the ground. Each chamber had a water basin with a water drip, and a
metal box about 1 x 1 x 1 m , open on one side, for a food shelter. We
left open the gate between the two chambers until the crows began to nest.
The San Diego Wild Animal Park had kept the birds on a diet of coarse-
ly chopped apples and slightly moistened high-protein dog chow.We gave
them dry dog chow instead, as we had done with our captive Scrub Jays
Aphelocoma coerulescens and they quickly accepted it. The crows often

wasted the apples that had been cut into quarters; they wasted less if we
cut the apples into eighths or smaller pieces. For the first month after
their arrival, we gave them raw peanuts in the shell but these proved to be
of little interest to them, a surprise to us because peanuts were the favourite
food of our captive Scrub Jays. We found that the crows preferred grapes
and oranges to apples.
Our captive Scrub Jays would feed only live food to their nestlings, so
we expected that the crows would do likewise. We hoped to keep the
parent crows from eating most of the expensive live food we provided by
giving them an abundance of their other favourite foods while they were
feeding young. Therefore, about midway through incubation, we began
daily to provide red and white grapes and quartered oranges. In the last
week before hatching we began to give the breeders live mealworms (larvae
of Tenebrio beetles) and crickets. We gave the mealworms paper towels
soaked in a multi-vitamin and mineral solution as a source of moisture. We
offered waxworms to the crows but they would not eat them or feed them
to the young.
Throughout the nestling period and for about two weeks after the
young left the nest, we continued to provide live food twice a day, as well
as oranges, apples and grapes once a day. We then began to reduce grad-
ually the amount of live food and to substitute for it canned dog food as
a source of protein for the young. At about four weeks after fledging, all
the birds' diets consisted largely of apples and dog chow, with the occasional
addition of watermelon or other fruit.

As soon as they arrived in Gainesville, the birds showed by their deep
froggy voices that they are Tamaulipas Crows. The adults produce at least
four major variations on their basic call. One of them (Fig. la) is apparently
the same as the call that Sutton (1951) phoneticised as " gar-lic Fig. lb
shows a call that is essentially the first part, or "gar", of the " gar-lic ",
These two are by far the commonest calls given by the adults. Fig. lc
shows a call that can be phoneticised as " kawoo ", and Id shows a quiet,
muttering call that is probably impossible to render in words. The crows
tend to give the two former calls when they mob us; the latter two when
they are calmer or undisturbed. We have twice heard a crow give a rattling
call, similar to the rattle given by so many other corvids (Goodwin, 1976),
but we have not been able to record it.
When a relatively calm Tamaulipas Crow gives any of the calls shown in
Fig. la-d, it extends its head forward, fluffs the feathers of its throat, and
lifts the tips of its wings about 10 cm off its back. All of this is done simul-
taneously just as the crow utters the call; its posture returns to normal at

the end of the call.
Breeding
We first saw signs of what we thought might be pair formation on 9th
March, when we noticed that 0-0 and W-W spent much time perched to-
gether in the west chamber, while the other crows stayed in the east
chamber. On lOthMarch, we first saw either 0-0 or W-W feed and preen the
other.
We were not certain that this behaviour meant that these two were
forming a pair; as early as 2nd March we also noticed G-G persistently
following Y-Y around the aviary, preening it and feeding it, yet both were
male!
Preening in these two "pairs" usually started when one crow approached
another with its foreparts lowered, its bill pointed down, and the feathers
of its nape fluffed. The crow that it approached either retreated, ignored
it, or preened it. The crows usually preened others around the eye, the
base of the bill, and on the nape. We occasionally saw mutual allopreening
between 0-0 and W-W. When a crow retreated from another that approached
it in the head-down posture, the approaching bird often followed or pur-
sued it. Since the crows that invited preening oftenpn effect, supplanted
the preeners, it is hard to consider the preeners to have been dominant .
Nest-building
On 9th March we placed an armful of sticks, each about 5-10 mm in
diameter and about 30 cm long, in the east chamber, because we expected
that any breeding pair would build on the platform we provided there.
Instead, on 13th March we found several of these sticks laid on the perch
and even stuck into the mesh in the shelter in the west chamber. Appar-
ently 0-0 and W-W were attempting to nest in that compartment, and to
isolate themselves at least partially from the other crows. Therefore, on
14th March we put a nest platform, identical to the one in the east cham-
ber, in the shelter where 0-0 and W-W had placed the sticks. By the 15th
they had already piled many sticks on this new platform. Early on 16th
March we provided more nest material, including fibres from the leaves
of the Cabbage Palm Sabal palmetto. We thought that the crows would
use the fibres in the final formation of the nest lining, as Florida Scrub
Jays Ac. coerulescens use the fibres of Scrub Cabbage Palm Sabal etonia.
On the 17th we noted that the crows had woven the palm fibres into the
foundation rather than reserving them for the cup. On 20th March we saw
0-0 adding material and forming the cup-shaped lining with typical corvid
shaping movements (Goodwin, 1976).
0-0 and W-W stayed in the west chamber most of the time after they

started their nest, and the other crows stayed in the east chamber. Several
times on 20th March 0-0 flew into the east chamber, where W-W followed
it immediately. Once when they did so, they both landed on a ledge where
they performed a mutual display in which they extended their necks,
pointed their bills down, and drooped their wings with their wrists held
out from their bodies. In this posture they walked slowly, about 15 cm
apart, sometimes in the same general direction, sometimes just milling
about near one another. This display is similar to those performed by
several other species of Corvus, as summarised by Goodwin (1976). As
they performed this display one of the other crows tried to approach
them to within less than 30 cm; one of the displaying crows made it back
away by jabbing at it with its open bill.
The nest seemed to be complete by 21st March, the last day we saw a
bird (0-0) add material. The foundation, of sticks and palm fibres, was
about 16 cm high and about 45 cm in diameter. The inner cup, of palm
fibres and a few leaves, was about 7 cm deep and about 20 cm in diameter.
We then closed the gate in the partition between the two chambers,
separating the breeders from the other crows. We realised that these crows
might be co-operative breeders (i.e. that in nature other flock members
might be allowed to feed the young), yet we were also wary that in con-
finement, otherwise normally attentive helpers might disrupt a pair's
breeding and possibly even prey on eggs or nestlings. Dr. Scott Winter-
stein, who has seen Sinaloa Crows nesting in the wild, told us that they
appeared to be loosely colonial but not co-operative breeders. Therefore,
we decided to give the nest builders maximum privacy and security, in the
hope that we could see them carry out the first successful nesting of this
species in captivity.
Egg-laying
Our assistant, Lisa Reinert, found the first egg on 3rd April. Previously
W-W had flown from the nest whenever Ms Reinert entered the aviary, but
this day W-W remained perched on the rim of the nest until she climbed up
to it. Both parents were unusually tame and devoured newborn mice while
she stood in the enclosure.
On the morning of 4th April there was a second egg in the nest. The
next day was dark and rainy and the nest was not checked. By late after-
noon on 6th April the nest contained four eggs. Thus, it appears that the
female laid one egg per day, beginning on 3rd April and ending on 6th
April, though possibly beginning on 2nd April and ending on 5th April.
Incubation and Hatching
Although it was difficult to watch the birds, we think that the female,

W-W, performed all of the incubation. On 20th April there were still four
eggs in the nest. On the morning of 22nd April there were only three, with
no trace of the fourth. Late on the afternoon of 22nd April, we found two
hatchlings and an egg in the nest. On 25th April the third egg had still not
hatched, so we removed it and prepared it as a specimen for the Florida
State Museum. It proved to have been infertile. The salvaged egg's shell
(UF 13182) is pale blue, delicately streaked lengthwise with pale olive
buff. It measures 23.9 mm x 32.7 mm. We found no remains of the other
egg shells.
The Nestlings
At hatching the young were completely naked and had greyish green
skin. We handled and photographed them for the first time on 28th April.
Their eyes at this time were barely open and they were still completely
without feathers; even the feather tracts were difficult to see. By slightly
over one week of age, the nestlings were fully twice their size at hatching.
On 3rd May their feather tracts were clearly visible, but the quills were
merely bumps on the skin. By 6th May the birds were in full quill. On
9th May the young were fully feathered on the dorsal tract, but otherwise
the sheaths had not broken. By 13th May almost all of their feathers had
emerged from their sheaths and their eyes were fully open. Their plumage
was dull black, their irides dark, and their bills and legs dark dull grey. On
14th May one nestling perched on the rim of the nest. Each day from then
until fledging the young spent more time perched on the rim. On 17th
May we banded the two young P-G and G-P.

On 20th May, when we removed a nestling to be examined and photo-
graphed, the other jumped from the nest and fluttered to the ground. We
put it back in the nest where it settled down. On the morning of 24th May
we found one of the young, G-P, on the edge of the nest and the other,
P-G, just a few centimetres away from the nest. Later the same day we
found P-G perched on a limb 1 m (314 ft) below the nest. When ap-
proached, the bird flew up to the mesh of the aviary, then hopped back
onto the nest.
On 26th May we found both young out of the nest; both could flutter
about and even fly upward for a few metres. Yet most of the time they
remained in or near the nest.
On 27th May we found both on a perch 4 m (1314 ft) from the nest.
They had left the nest permanently. At fledging, both young had half-
grown tails. By mid-June their tails were full length, and at a distance the
young were hard to tell from the adults.

After the young left the nest, they called when they begged for food
from their parents and when they joined the adults in mobbing people
who came near the aviary. The calls they used in these two situations
sound, and appear in sonograms, remarkably like calls that we have heard
in spring and summer from wild adult-sized Fish Crows Corvus ossifragus
that may, however, have been young-of-the-year. We recorded the call in
Fig. lg from one of a group of wild Fish Crows that alighted on the aviary
to look at and call to the Tamaulipas Crows.
By 10th June, though still begging from their parents, both young fed
themselves most of the time. By 18th June the juveniles still occasionally
begged for food but they seemed strong, full grown, and able to take care
of themselves.
We then opened the door between the two chambers. At first the birds
acted as though they were unaware that the door was open. By 23rd June
the breeders and their young began to make brief forays through the gate,
but the parent birds still seemed to exclude the other adults from the west
chamber. By late July all of the birds travelled throughout the aviary. At
the time of writing (early November) the young birds' voices are still
distinctively different from those of the adults.

Introduction

<bodyText confidence="0.96923" page_id="58080477"  page_num="199" year="" vol="">
Native to open woodland regions of south-eastern Brazil, Uruguay, and
eastern Argentina, the Yellow (or Green) Cardinal is a species of New
World seedeater which is uncommonly kept in U.S. zoos. Of the seven
existing South American cardinal species, previously only the Red-crested
Cardinal Paroaria coronata and the Red-capped Cardinal P. gularis have
been commonly kept in captivity for avicultural purposes.
Description
The male's pronounced black crest, crown and throat, lemon-yellow
eyebrow and moustache streaks, and its olive-green back and olive-yellow
breast and flanks make it one of the most distinctive and unusual birds of
the Cardinal group. The female is similarly marked but duller, with white
replacing the yellow moustache and eyebrow.
Housing
One adult wild-caught pair of Yellow Cardinals has been housed at the
National Aquarium in Baltimore in a 5,500 cubic metre Neotropical
Aviary exhibit since January 1983. Opened in 1981, the glass-covered
exhibit is a pyramid, with a base measuring 25 x 25 x 35 m (82 x 82 x
114% ft) and 21 m (68% ft) high at the peak. The exhibit has been
planted to represent a naturalistic stratification of Neotropical ecological
zones (emergent, canopy, understory, ground, field and marsh) The 4m
(13 ft) high 'gunnite' walls, covered with vines and epiphytes, surround
the large central planted area, providing cliffs and outcroppings for
additional habitat availability. Several pools, waterfalls and a 12 m (39% ft)
stream are also present.
Inhabitants of this exhibit include over 35 species of Neotropical wad-
ers, waterfowl, psittacines, softbills and seedeaters, three species of turtles,
four species of iguanid lizards, tropical freshwater fish and a pair of Two-
toed Sloths. Nearly all species are free-ranging throughout the exhibit. In
general, all species co-exist well, although some minor territorial disputes
do occur during the nesting season.

Climate varies slightly with the seasons, but generally a 24-28*C tem-
perature range is maintained. Relative humidity runs between 60 and 70%.
Photoperiod is difficult to control, due to late night openings throughout
the year. Twelve to 14 hours of light are received on these weekend days,
while a normal mid-Atlantic photoperiod is maintained on the remaining
days.
Diet
Food pans are distributed to all animals in the exhibit twice daily at six
feeding stations. The Yellow Cardinals feed most readily from a seed dish
comprising canary, millet and sunflower seeds, dried peas and corn, but
also feed from pans intended for softbilled birds containing ground fruit,
e gg&amp;gt; meat with a dry crumble base, plus multivitamins. They also feed
from the live insect drop (crickets, mealworms and waxworms) which is
performed at 0730 hours daily.
Reproduction
Limited information exists regarding this species, but, like other New
World members of the family Fringillidae, Yellow Cardinals have appeared
to be fairly opportunistic in their breeding habits, providing proper envir-
onmental requirements have been met.
The pair of Yellow Cardinals was introduced to the exhibit in January
1983. The first signs of nesting activity were in April of that year. Half-
hearted attempts were made to construct a nest using tree fern bark, Ficus
sp. leaves and stripped palm fronds, but the birds quickly abandoned the
nest. In the following months the male continued to court the female
actively and in July a second attempt at nest construction was made,
again to no avail.
In May 1984, a nest was found in a Cecropia sp. tree, 3 m (9% ft) above
the ground, similar in materials used to those nests built the previous year.
Three eggs were present. The eggs were a pale greenish-blue, heavily
mottled with brown at the larger end, and less so at the small end. The
nest was extremely flimsy, and had to be artificially supported with wire.
Two chicks hatched on 14th May 1984, the third egg proving infertile.
The parents were fierce defenders, chasing away birds several times their
size which came within several meters of the nest area. By 14 days, the
chicks had become extremely active, exercising growing wings and perch-
ing at times on the edge of the nest. Becoming an easier target for other
potentially predaceous species and because the nest at this point consis-
ted primarily of only support wire, the chicks were removed to off-show
quarters.
The chicks weighed 23 and 28 gms, and were fed a combination of live
insects and a formula nestling food. By 28 days the chicks were flying

&amp;gt;
strongly, and by 35 days were eating the adult diet on their own.
After the chicks were removed, the parents soon began constructing a
new nest 6.5 m (21% ft) up in a stand of thorny bamboo. Again, primarily
tree fern bark and leaves were used, but the branching stalks of the bam-
boo growing into the exhibit perimeter wire allowed the nest greater stabil-
ity. Due to the location of the nest and the protection it received from the
thorny bamboo, nest checks were not made. Both female and male were
readily observed incubating until 28th June 1984 when both were seen
carrying live insects to the nest. Using a mirror attached to a long pole and
binoculars, it was determined that two chicks were present. At 10 days
both chicks were found at the base of the bamboo, one in shock, the
second scared but unharmed. The first expired within several hours, but
the other was reared with no mishaps using similar techniques as with the
first clutch.
In 1985 the parents built again in the bamboo, but even higher. Two
chicks from two clutches hatched on 12th June and 9th July, 1985, were
reared. This brings the number of chicks reared to five in the 1984 and
1985 seasons - two males and three females.
Consent ution
In Uruguay the Yellow Cardinal is considered to be in the Appendix III
category, according to the Convention on the International Trade of En-
dangered Species (C.I.T.E.S.). This makes importation of future specimens
of this species unlikely.
As no Yellow Cardinals have been reared in U.S. zoological collections
between 1980 and our successes in 1984-1985 (according to the Inter-
national Species Inventory System, or I.S.I.S.), the National Aquarium in
Baltimore is initiating a co-operative breeding programme with other insti-
tutions, including the Vancouver Aquarium, Philadelphia Zoo and the
Burnet Park Zoo, which currently maintain individuals of this species. It is
hoped that with the introduction of additional blood lines and our contin-
ued breeding successes, this bird's future in captivity can be assured.

SOME RARE INSECTIVOROUS SOFTBILLS BRED IN 1984

The genus Prinia comprises 13 species which live in the tropical and
subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. They are generally grouped in the
subfamily Sylvinae but recent examinations by Sibley have persuaded
Wolters (1983) to assign the genus Prinia to a new family, the Cisticolidae.
The two subspecies of the Bar-winged Prinia Prinia familiaris live on the
islands of Sumatra, Java and Bali, where they are common birds on cultiva-
ted land, living in dense, low vegetation in the damper areas. The West
Java birds breed during all months of the year while the Bar-winged Prinias
of East Java only breed from January to May at the start of the rainy
season. Outside the breeding season they rove about in small groups in
search of insects.
The Bar-winged Prinia is the size of a small warbler with a long, greyish
tail ending in a broad, white-bordered band. The body is mainly grey
above with some bright white spots on the wings and white on the under-
parts. In the breeding season the male has a small grey band across the
breast. The eyes are brown, the bill is black (more horn-coloured in young
birds).
The pair in my collection were put into an aviary measuring 2.00 x 3.5
x 2.5 m high ( 6 V 2 x IP /2 x 8^ ft) containing some large plants in tubs. In
the thick shrubs the birds soon built a globular nest out of fine fibres and
two pale green eggs, flecked with brown, were laid. Only the female sat on
the eggs. After a fortnight the nest was empty and only the eggshells were
to be found on the ground of the aviary. Some days later, a further three
eggs were laid. After an incubation period of 12-13 days, the chicks
hatched but were put out of the nest within hours. A month later a new
nest was built in a dead broom bush but once again the hatched chicks
were put out of the nest - we could see the female carrying the chicks
in her beak and beating them on a branch, like worms. However, the next
breeding attempts were successful. The birds now accepted all different
living insects such as small mealworms, crickets, 'ant eggs', and preferred
the maggots of the wax-moth and spiders. Both Prinias fed their chicks
well and after 13 days, two small, short-tailed Bar-winged Prinias left their
nest and were soon independent from their parents. The pair made two
more successful breedings producing two young birds from each.
The Bar-winged Prinia showed a very interesting display though their
song was unremarkable. I am sure that in the breeding season they should
not be kept with more than one pair of the same species because my birds

were very aggressive towards their own or closely-related species.
The family Cisticolidae also contains the genus Orthotomus, whose
members are found extensively through South-east Asia and its islands.
The eight species prefer moist, tropical lowlands where they live hidden in
the undergrowth.
Two species came to my aviary: the Common or Long-tailed Tailorbird
Orthotomus sutorius and the Ashy Tailorbird O. ruficeps. Like the Prinia,
the Tailorbirds also belong to the well-known biologist, Dr. K.L. Schuch-
mann(Bonn) who placed these birds with me to attempt first breedings.
Because the two species of Tailorbirds fought, they had to be kept in
separate aviaries. The Common Tailorbird is one of the best-known birds
in his own country although only a few people have seen him in the wild.
The nine subspecies are spread from the North-west Himalayas and South-
west China to Malaysia and Java. Different from the normal description,
my male Long-tailed Tailorbird is not olive on the back but only grey
and is also rufous on the cheek (like the male Ashy Tailorbird). During
the breeding season he has two elongated tail feathers. The underparts
are white. The female lacks the long tail feathers and is more grey-olive
above.
Soon this pair sewed a loop out of fibres on the underside of a broad
leaf of a Hymenocallis plant, which was to be used as the basis for a
further nest-cup. Two pale green eggs with large brownish spots (17 x
12 mm) were laid but unfortunately the female died so there was no
result.
The six subspecies of the Ashy Tailorbird live in the bush and wood-
lands of western Burma and southern Thailand, southward to the Sunda
Islands. The male bird looks similar to the Common Tailorbird but lacks
the elongated tail feathers and is ashy-grey on the breast. The female
is also similar but is only grey above.
The male Ashy Tailorbird sewed several nesting pouches out of the
large leaves of Hibiscus rosa-sinensis, or Piperaceae plants, and these
were made into finished nests but unfortunately the leaves dried up very
soon so that they had to be tied up with a wire.
Later they built a nest in a closed nesting basked from fibres as are
usually used by estrildid finches. They laid two white, brown-flecked
eggs which were incubated by the female only. After 13 days one bird
hatched but was abandoned after five days. In a new attempt, two chicks
hatched and were brought up by the adults who preferred to feed small
spiders and maggots of wax-moths. At 14 days one young Tailorbird left
the nest. It looked like the female without the long tail feathers and the
rufous colour on the head. While the male provided for this chick, the
iemale started a new clutch from which one young bird was reared also.

The last insectivorous bird that I bred in 1984 was the Red-faced
Crombec Sylvietta whytii which lives in eastern Africa from southern
Ethiopia southward to Rhodesia and Mozambique. All the members of
this genus are very short-tailed and have a slightly curved bill. Like the
titmice, they hop through the bushes hunting small insects. They build
a deep, bag-like cup nest at the end of a thin twig. In my aviary they
always have great difficulty in building such a nest and although I tried
to give very different nesting materials, they needed a long time to com-
plete the nest and sometimes it was bound to fall to bits before the
breeding season was over. Both sexes sat on the whitish, reddish-brown
freckled eggs and after 13-14 days one chick hatched. The parents fed
the little Crombec very well but after ten days the male was mating
again and I had to take him out of the aviary. Four days later the chick
left the nest and continued to be fed by the female for a further three
weeks until I separated it. At once the young bird fed itself but did avoid
coming down to the floor of the cage. At four months old it changed to
adult plumage with silvery grey above and extensive rufous on the under-
parts.
These successful breedings are a great encouragement to me as I now
hope to breed other rare insectivorous birds in the future, such as the
Paradise Flycatcher and Wattle-eyes.

ELECTRIFIED FENCING FOR AVIARIES
AND ENCLOSURES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997905027027027" page_id="58080486"  page_num="208" year="" vol="">

Electrified wires and fences are frequently used to prevent domestic
livestock from entering areas of crops or valuable land, and also around
enclosures to prevent predators. In recent years wildfowl breeders have
developed a system of electrified wires around their enclosures and pens
as added protection against intruders. These systems can easily be adapted
for use with aviaries where predation, or worrying by potential predators,
is a problem.
The equipment for running an electric wire or fence is available from
farm suppliers or direct from manufacturers, as listed at the end. It con-
sists of an energy supply, either mains or battery, an energiser which
transmits pulses of current at high volts, but at low amps so that it is not
dangerous to humans, galvanised wire and various insulators and fixings
to suit a variety of situations. The energiser costs approximately #60-#80
and the smallest size is capable of electrifying three miles of wire. They
do seem very reliable and if one calculates the loss of a few rare or expen-
sive birds, it is perhaps worth the investment.
To set up a system of electric wires or fence is quite straightforward
as long as one bears in mind the basic principle behind it. The intruder
has to touch the live wire and be earthed in order to get a shock. There-
fore a sparrow perching on the live wire is unaffected, but the cat that
touches the galvanised mesh of the fence and the live wire is perfectly
earthed and gets a shock. The predators of wildfowl and aviary birds
are many and varied and this has to be borne in mind when designing the
system. An electric fence obviously offers no protection against preda-
tory birds. When dealing with foxes, dogs and cats, the enclosure fence
of an open pen must be high enough to prevent them clearing it without
touching it. A 6 ft (1.83 m) fence with a short 45* overhang at the top
has proved effective in London suburbs when an electric wire has been
placed along the top of the overhang (see diagram). Some waterfowl
breeders prefer to have a higher fence, say 8 ft (2.44 m), with an electric
wire running round around it at the 6 ft mark, so that predators get a
shock whilst clambering up and consequently fall back. If the fencing
material itself is not a good conductor of electricity, for example plastic-
coated fencing, wooden panels, etc., then the addition of galvanised
earthing wires running alongside, but not touching, the live wire is
necessary to make sure the intruder is still earthed, even if its feet are not

on the ground.
Rats and foxes are good diggers and it is wise to dig the fence in at
least 1 ft (0.31 m) below ground level unless the aviary has a concrete
base. Even more effective is to bury the fence 1 ft down and then turn it
1 ft out as well. If digging-in presents a problem, it is sometimes possible
to lay Vi in (0.012m) mesh 18 in (0.46 m) out along the ground, pegging it
firmly every six inches (0.152 m). It is fairly obvious from observing rats
and foxes, that they will try to climb into the enclosures before they
expend great energy digging. When dealing with rats, mink, stoats, etc.,
Vi in mesh is necessary from the ground up to the point of the electric
wire so that they cannot squeeze through the mesh and hence avoid the
electric wire. This also prevents your own birds from putting their heads
through the mesh and touching the electric wire themselves. We have
found that to run an electric wire at about 9-12 in (0.23--0.305 m) off the
ground close to the fence is ideal. If the Vi in mesh is turned out 3--4 in
(0.076 - 0.10 m) over the electric wire (see diagram), it means that the rat
has to touch the electric wire while trying to negotiate the turn-out. Above
the electric wire the fence mesh can be larger, depending on your own bird
size, of course, which is usually cheaper and more pleasing on the eye.
Assuming your fencing is fixed to the outside of the posts, there should
be no easy way in for climbing rodents.
From our personal experience with an enclosure for ducks and geese,
we have found that the bottom electric wire also deters cats, dogs and
foxes because they tend to be inquisitive and often touch the live wire
with their nose or paws and a small shock is enough to send them running.
In a roofed-in aviary the problem is often that these animals scare the
birds rather than actually getting into the aviary and this, of course,
can lead to birds damaging themselves or dying of shock. In such cases,
a little ingenuity must be used to place the electric wires in such a way as
to stop them. A single or double strand could be mounted around the roof
of the aviary on short posts to deter animals clambering on the roof. The
system is very adaptable as the electric wire runs out from the energiser
and does not have to return to it. It can also branch off from the main
wire or you can run two parallel electric wires from the energiser. It is
worth noting, however, that if the electric wire is touched by wet foliage
or grass, there will be a leakage to earth, which will reduce the power
going along the wire. Some models have a warning mechanism (visible or
audible) when the wire is being earthed and it is a good idea to place the
energiser where you can frequently check it, i.e. your bird-shed, garage,
porch, etc.
Although the initial outlay of such a system is quite high, maybe #120,
we feel we owe it to the birds in our care to give them the best protection

possible. An electric wire system does not.negate the need for secure
fencing, but it does act as an effective back-up.

BIRDS IN MOSCOW ZOO AND OTHER SOVIET ZOOS

On 5th November 1985 I spent a few hours at Moscow Zoo and was
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.9729278" page_id="58080489"  page_num="211" year="" vol="">
shown round by the Director, Vladimir V. Spitsin, and the Scientific
Secretary, Natalia I. Istratova. The Zoo was created as long ago as 1864
when it was only the twentieth such establishment anywhere in the world.
Today it occupies 17 hectares.
In the short time I was there it was not possible to gain a comprehensive
view of the Zoo's feathered population but such facts as were obtained
may be set down.
I asked particularly about cranes and was shown, to my delight, nine
species. It was gratifying to set eyes on a Siberian Crane Grus leucogeranus ,
albeit a bird with a deformed beak. There were seven Red-crowned Cranes
G. japonensis (three pairs, plus one) and five White-naped Cranes G. vipio
These last included a breeding pair - one bird from nature brought in as a
casualty and one bird imported from Baraboo, Wisconsin - and a
younger, non-breeding pair. One Sandhill Crane G. canadensis pratensis,
two Common Cranes G. grus and half a dozen Demoiselles Anthropoides
virgo completed the Palearctic cranes, to which have to be added two
Afro-tropical species: the South African Crowned Crane Balearica regu-
lorum (three birds) and the Sudan Crowned Crane B. pavonina cecilae
(two birds), and an Oriental species, the Sarus Crane Grus antigone (two
birds).

It was also a pleasure to see four White Storks of the black-billed east-
ern form Ciconia ciconia boyciana. There was one pair and two 'spare'
males.
I was taken to the incubator room, a very clean, neat and tidy place.
There, in 1985, 603 eggs of 71 species had been hatched including those of
waterfowl, pheasants and birds of prey. To give just one example at ran-
dom: two eggs of the Tawny Eagle Aquila rapax orientalis were success-
fully hatched. Two years earlier nine eggs of Ross's Gull Rhodostethia
rosea , taken from nests in the wild (presumably in north-eastern Siberia)
had been incubated. Of the nine, only seven hatched out, and of these
seven young ones, five died of aspergillosis within a year. A further bird
died at two years and three months old, but one surviving Ross's Gull
was there to be admired.
Of course, many birds are allowed to keep and to hatch out their
own eggs in the Zoo grounds, particularly species of waterfowl. One of
the problems these birds face is the depredations of their eggs and young
ones by Hooded Crows Corvus corone comix. Not only are these crows a
nuisance to other birds in this way, they also steal food. The crows even
empty the litter bins in their search for titbits. In consequence, between
three and four thousand crows are trapped and killed every year by the
Zoo authorities and their bodies are fed to appropriate Zoo residents.
Feral pigeons Columba livia and House Sparrows Passer domesticus are
also fellow-travellers, but apparently no action is taken against them.
Among the larger birds of prey the pair of Steller's Sea Eagles Haliae-
etus pelagicus was particularly impressive. The couple were housed along-
side five Golden Eagles Aquila chrysaetos , a breeding pair of Lammer-
geyers Gypaetus barbatus, a breeding pair of Himalayan Griffons Gyps
himalayensis, and two Bald Eagles Haliaeetus leucocephalus.
I was told that the Zoo's total bird population was over 2,000 indi-
viduals, of over 300 species, and was handed a booklet giving the results
of an earlier census taken on 1st January 1983. An analysis of this list
gives 2,058 individuals of 289 races of 268 species (Anon. 1984). Else-
where (Spitsin, 1984) the figures given are 1,672 individuals of 312
species.
On the day of my visit, darkness had fallen before I could see all the
birds of prey so I turned at once to the pages of the booklet that would
tell me what I might have missed. Among the larger species, the Zoo
held (on that date, at least) seven White-tailed Eagles Haliaeetus albicilla,
a pair of Old World Black Vultures Aegypius monachus and six Imperial
Eagles Aquila heliaca.
By turning to another book (Spitsin, 1984) the Soviet equivalent of
the International Zoo Yearbook, it was possible to determine the num-

bers and distribution of rare birds among 37 Soviet zoos. Apparently
all these establishments had also undertaken censuses on 1st January 1983.
By a coincidence, the number of species listed as 'rare' is also 37. Five of
the species are cranes. No less than 13 Siberian Cranes, nine males and
four females, are listed for the Oka State Nature Reserve. Only Moscow
Zoo held Eastern White Storks (two males and two females on that date),
but 14 zoos held 28 Black Storks Ciconia nigra. Other rare species include
two pelicans, a flamingo, eight Anatiform birds, five pheasants, two
parrots and a dozen Falconiform birds. To give now some example man-
ners of rare raptors: on 1st January 1983, 90 Tawny Eagles were held in
27 zoos, 46 Imperial Eagles in 23 zoos, 44 Golden Eagles in 21 zoos, 41
White-tailed Eagles in 16 zoos, 18 Lammergeyers in 10 zoos, five Steller's
Sea Eagles in three zoos, three Short-toed Eagles Circaetus gallicus in two
zoos, three Bald Eagles in two zoos and three Pallas's Sea Eagles Haliaeetus
leucoryphus in two zoos.
It is clear from another section of the book that of these rare raptors
only three species were bred in captivity in Soviet zoos in 1982: the White-
tailed Eagle (one zoo), the Lammergeyer (two zoos) and the Tawny Eagle
(one zoo).
In conclusion it is worth mentioning that 79 bird species are listed in
the second (1984) edition of the Red Data Book of the USSR (Borodin,
1984).

THE FEEDING AND BREEDING OF THREE SOUTHERN
AFRICAN SERINS IN CAPTIVITY AND IN THE WILD
By NEVILLE BRICKELL

After first reading C.J. Skead's book in 1960, The Canaries ,
Seedeaters and Buntings of Southern Africa , I decided that in the years
to follow I would try to fill some of the gaps listed as 'No Data' in his
work. Milewski (1978) also seemed to have had a similar idea as his efforts
and patience have paid off with his survey on the feeding habits of serins
in the south-western Cape Province, South Africa.
As seeds play the major part in the eating habits of the so-called can-
aries, it is important that the correct mixtures are available in the aviary at
all times. Pre-packed seed usually contains four parts yellow manna, one
part red manna, two parts canary and one part white millet. The more ex-
perienced aviculturists tend to make up their own mixtures. This must be
supplemented with soft, green achenes which are the small seeds of Com-
posite flowers, such as Senecio and Ursinia. The so-called seedeaters,
in fact, eat much less seed than might be supposed and feed on wild berries
and fruit as it comes into season. As a substitute, grated apple, sliced
orange, half-peeled grape, pear, guava, banana and fig can be given. Fresh
washed greenfood should be supplied regularly as it provides the vitamins
and minerals needed to complete a good staple diet, and limited quantities
should be given at a time, with the stale greens being removed daily. The
dark greens such as watercress, spinach, carrot tops, thistle and chick-
weed have a high vitamin content. It is not easy to provide a regular
varied supply from the local pet store. The termite has had to become the
major feeding item in many parts of Africa. Winged termites can be caught
as they emerge from the ground just before a rain storm is due. These can
be stored in a container in the refrigerator for many months. Mound ter-
mites are the most popular and these great earth castles are broken up and
kept in potato sacks which will give a supply of ants for at least a month.
All the serins swallow small coarse sand known as grit to assist in the diges-
tion of seeds which is evident in the faeces. In the aviary, crushed oyster
shell or cuttlefish 'bone' will act as a valuable adjunct to grit. Water has
been left until last but it is no less important to food. Newly-acquired
birds will prefer rain water to that from a reservoir but will soon accept
the latter in a few days.
The White-throated Canary Serinus albogularis is also known as the
White-throated Seedeater. In the wild it has been observed feeding at the

seedheads of aloes, buds of euphorbias and achenes of Composite flowers.
Milewski (1978) recorded that small seeds were also important in their
diet, in addition to the larger seed types and a wide range of soft plant
parts as well as taking kernels and large seed.
Percentage figures of food genera revealed: 11% Polycarena, 6%
Zygophyllum, Erodium, Acacia, Olea, 4% Kleinia, Othonna, Euryops,
Chrysanthemoides, 2% Emex, Microloma, Relhania, Sonchus, Protea
(possibly partly insects ), Stoebe, Eriocephalus, 13% Salsola, 8% Raphanus,
10% Chenopodium\ additionally the succulent leaf-pulp from Asteraccae
and Mesembryanthemaceae . In the aviary, they have been recorded feeding
on the unripe seedheads of the Blackjack Bidens pilosa and wild Sunflower
Efelianthus annuus and ripe seeds of Pepperweed Lepidium africanum,
Klein Geelbossie Senecio polyanthemoides, Smeltersbossie Flaveria biden-
tis and Khaki Weed Alternanthera pungens. Ripe and green seeds of
Guinea Grass Panicum maximum , Blue Panic Panicum laevigatum, Garden
Setaria Set aria pallide fusca, Hay Chloris virgata, Natal Redtop Rhynchely-
trum repens , Thatchgrass Hyparrhenia hirta , Giant Paspalum Paspalum
urvillei, Ostrich Grass Erigeron canadensis and Broad-leaved Panic Panicum
deustrum. Petals are eaten from Dwarf Marigold Schkuhria pinnata , Red
Salvia Salvia africana and the fruit of Cestrum Cestrum laevigatum (Black
Inkberry), African Mulberry Morns mesozygia and Wild Plum Harpe-
phyllum caffrum (Kaffir apple).
The Bully Canary Serinus sulphuratus is more commonly known out-
side Africa as the Sulphury Seedeater or Brimstone Canary. It takes seeds
on growing plants including those of pine cones and wild mustard. It has
been recorded feeding on the green or dry seeds of the Candelabra Tree
Euphorbia ingens , Red Salvia Salvia africana and Blue Lupin Lupinus
angustifolius. The fruit and seeds of wild Grenadilla Passiflora edvlis, wild
Fig Ficus burtt-davyi, Cat-thorn Scutia myrtina and pulpy berries of the
Australian Privet Ligustrum sp. and African Mulberry Morns mesozygia.
Milewski (1978) records the Bully as frequently feeding on relatively
large seed types, chiefly seed kernels in developing fleshy fruit. The per-
centage figures of food genera were: 6% Diospyros, 8 % Pelargonium, 2%
Pinus, Cassytha, 1% Cononeaster, Psoralea, Stellaria, Eriocephalus, 5%
Raphanus, Chrysanthemoides , 43% Olea , 3% Chenopodium and 3% unid-
entified. Aviary birds will readily accept the seeds of the Paw Paw Carica
papaya but usually discard the fruit, also the seeds of plants and of grasses
listed for the White-throated Seedeater in addition to Swaziland grass
Digitaria horizois , Canary Creeper Senecio tamoides and Parrot Leaf Al-
ternanthera ficoidea. My thirty-year survey has revealed that the Bully
will accept the following fruits: Nana-berry Rhus dentata, African Cran-
berry Vaccinium exul, Common Forest Grape Rhoicissus tomentosa.

All three species feed live food to nestlings in small quantities, namely
mealworms, termites, aphids, small earthworms and ants' eggs and pupae.
The Bully has been recorded on two occasions feeding small maggots to
nestlings and once small slugs when no other live food was available in
the aviary.
The White-throated Canary constructs a loosely made, shallow cup of
stems and rootlets lined with vegetable down, placed 1-3 m up in the fork
of a bush. It breeds from August to April and three or four, sometimes
two, eggs are laid. The eggs are white, pale greenish, bluish or pinkish
cream, usually immaculate but occasionally spotted and scrolled with
purple, brown and black at the large end. Egg measurements average (50)
19.8 x 14.6 (17.2 - 22.1 x 13.5 - 16.6). Both sexes incubate. The incuba-
tion and nestling periods are not recorded for the wild, but in aviary birds
incubation is recorded as 13 days (1), nestling period 17 days (1).
The Bully Canary builds an open shallow cup which may be strong
and compact or untidy and loosely constructed. The lining may consist of
soft fine grass fibres, woolly down, string, rags or pappi of Composite
plants. The nest may be situated in the fork of a low bush, in a bunch of
bananas or in tall euphorbias. Breeds from July to November in the Cape
Province, South Africa, and with records for all months, except April, in
Zimbabwe. Two to four eggs are laid. They are white, pale green or blue,
spotted and streaked with purple, brown and black. Egg measurements
average (28) 19.5 x 14.2 (17.8 - 20.8 x 13.4 - 14.8). Incubation is by the
female, and lasts 12/4 - 17 days (4); the nestling period is 15-21 days (2).
The Yellow Canary constructs an open shallow cup consisting of grass
stems, rootlets, tendrils and soft weeds which may be neat and compact
but is sometimes ragged and rather loose. The lining is of fine grass and
other soft materials. Nests are built in a low bush or small tree 30 cm to

3m up from the ground. There are records of nests on the ground. The
breeding season is from December to March in the Transvaal, July to Octo-
ber in the Cape Province, South Africa, and August to January in South
West Africa (Namibia). Three to four eggs are laid which are usually white,
sometimes pale green or blue, plain or sparsely spotted and lined with
purple, brown and black. Egg measurements average (80) 18,0 x 13.2
(16.1 - 20.6 x 12.5 - 14.6). Incubation is by the female and lasts for
12-14 days (2); the nestling period has been recorded as 14 days in the
wild, 15-19 days (2) in aviary birds.
To encourage all three species to breed, branches can be fixed to the
battens of the aviary in the hope that the birds will construct their own
nests. Nesting receptacles such as the wicker canary cup and half-open
nest-boxes should also be available. Nest lining material in the form of
coconut fibre, soft grassheads, moss, cow or horse tail hair, wool, cat
fur, feathers, string, fragments of cloth and partly dried weeds will be
adequate.

The Black-faced Swee Estrilda melanotis is more commonly known
outside Africa as the Dufresne's Waxbill. A common species, usually found
in pairs or small family parties. They are generally very quiet and therefore
easily overlooked, unless disturbed when the alarm call, an explosive tzwee
is heard. It frequents low undergrowth on the edges of evergreen forest
where it spends a lot of the time feeding on seeding grassheads.
The male of the nominate race has the forehead, crown, nape and
upper mantle grey; lores, ear-coverts, sides of face, chin and upper throat
black; mantle and wing-coverts olivaceous green; rump and upper tail-
coverts red; tail blackish; lower throat, breast and flanks pale grey; belly
and under tail-coverts grey, washed with pale yellow; eye red; bill, upper
mandible black, lower red; legs and feet blackish. The female lacks the
black face being pale grey instead. Young birds resemble the female but
the rump and upper tail-coverts are dull rusty orange; bill blackish. E.m.
bocagei differs in being more distinctly barred on the mantle, scapulars
and wing-coverts; belly and under tail-coverts are lemon yellow.
The East African Swee or Yellow-bellied Waxbill are the common
names reserved for three races from East Africa. E.m. quartinia has no
sexual dimorphism. Forehead, crown, nape and sides of face grey; chin
and throat pale grey; rump and upper tail-coverts scarlet; underparts
greenish yellow, deeper on centre of belly. E.m. kilimensis differs from the
proceeding race in being slightly more olivaceous on the mantle. E.m.
stuartwini is similar to E.m. kilimensis but crown, nape and hindneck are
markedly paler and more bluish grey; mantle and wing-coverts pale green
rather than olive-brown; rump and upper tail-coverts less crimson; flanks
less dusky. The names Neisna dufresneyi nyansae Neumann, 1905, and
Neisna minima Ogilvie-Grant, 1906, are synonyms of E.m. kilimensis
(Clancey, 1969).
E.m. melanotis occurs in the South African provinces of the south-

This species feeds largely on grass seeds, including Natal Red Top Rhyn-
chelytrum repens , Blue Finger Grass Digitaria stentiana and Guinea Grass
Panicum maximum , also Thistle seeds ( Compositae ), unripe seeds of the
Black jack Bidens pilosa and probably seeds of other plants. It feeds on

air, or eaten on the ground. In captivity it has been recorded feeding on
small earthworms, moths, spiders, aphids, thrips, mealworms, ants' eggs
and pupae and mound termites while feeding young. Greenfood in the
form of chickweed, watercress, lettuce or sprouted seed must be given at
least once a fortnight. Softfood can be supplied in the form of the pro-
prietary breakfast cereal 'Pro Nutro', hard-boiled egg, wholewheat bread
or moistened dog biscuits.
In its natural state it constructs a rather flimsy, pear-shaped nest of
dry grass with the entrance hole at one point, and thickly lined with
grass seedheads and feathers. The nest may be sited in the fork of a tree
or shrub, often in a conspicuous location in the garden around houses.
E.m. melanotis breeds from November to March but is also recorded in
June and July. In the aviary it will readily accept the standard finch type
nesting-boxes or utilise any old vacant nest of weavers. The egg colour
is pure white and the measurements are average (50) 13.9 x 10.5 (12.8 -
14.6 x 9.8 - 11.1) mm for E.m. melanotis. A clutch may consist of four
to ten eggs, the large numbers probably being due to two females laying
in the same nest. Aviary clutches average four to seven eggs (six pairs).
The nesting success of six nests was four to five fledgings per nest. Addled
or infertile eggs were left in the nest until the fledglings had ventured out
for the first time. Priest (1971) gives incubation as 11-16 days in the wild.
Aviary birds average 12-13 days (six pairs). Both sexes incubate. The
nesting period is for 19-22 days (six pairs). Both adults feed the young.
The young return to the nest for the first few nights and are independent
at 15-19 days (12 birds).
The Pin-tailed Whydah Vidua macroura has been recorded parasitising
E.m. melanotis in the Cape Province, South Africa.

THE SOUTHERN AFRICAN POPULATION OF THE
GREY WAXBILL Estrilda perreini

This bird is also known as Perrein's Waxbill, Black-tailed Grey Waxbill,
Black-tailed Lavender and Vinegar-tail. It is a shy species which darts into
the nearest thicket when disturbed while uttering a thin, slightly explosive
pseeu, pseeu ; it is usually found singly, in pairs or in a small family group
and is extremely active when seeking food both on the ground and among
the foliage of bushes and creepers. The sexes are alike.
The identification of the nominate race has been described by a num-
ber of researchers and therefore further comment is not necessary. Clancey
(1974) states that E.p. perreini is darker above than E.p. torrida and still
darker than the darkest specimens of E.p. incana, and the rump and upper
tail-coverts are still darker carmine than in the latter. Adults occasionally
have white spots, or white spots on carmine feathers on flanks. E.p. incana
is to be found in the coastal regions and lower midlands of Natal, Zulu-
land, eastern Transvaal, provinces of South Africa as well as Swaziland, Sul
do Save district of Mozambique and eastern Zimbabwe. E.p. torrida in the
Sofala district of southern Mozambique, extending to the littoral of
northern Mozambique and in the south of Malawi along the Shire River.
The species inhabits dune forest, riparian thickets and open woodland.
It feeds by perching on or clinging to seeding grassheads, using the feet to
hold down the food. Besides grass seed which seems to be the major food
source recorded for the wild, Little (1963) observed the birds taking the
seeds of Casuarina, an exotic belonging to the beefwood family and eating
at blossoms of Marula Scterocarya caffra. In the aviary it has been obser-
ved feeding on Goose grass Elusine indica, Catstail Dropseed Sporobolus
pyramidalis, Giant Paspalum Paspalum urvillei. Natal Redtop Rhynchely-
trum repens and Garden Setaria Setaria pallide-fusca. Besides the various
kinds of commercial seeds, they must be supplied with live food regularly
when breeding, namely ant pupae, spiders, aphids, small or cut-up meal-
worms and mound termites. They are partial to nectar which can be
prepared by mixing caramel and brown sugar to form a syrup which can be
placed in a canary tube feeder and fixed to a branch. They have been
noted feeding on the very small ants which are attracted to the syrup.
Breeding takes place from October to March in Natal; there is also a
record for December from Zululand. In the courtship display the male
picks up a long grass stem in its bill and hops around the female singing

and, at the same time, moving the grass from side to side. Copulation does
not occur immediately after the ceremony, but during allo-preening when
the female crouches and performs a rapid vibrating tail movement. Nests
are placed 3-5 m from the ground in a tree, bush or bamboo stand. The
roughly constructed, retort-shaped nest is composed of dried grasses and
seedheads and lined with fine grasses and feathers. A short entrance tun-
nel protrudes from the top of the nest. In southern Africa it has been
recorded utilising and relining the nests of waxbills and weavers, for
example, the Forest Weaver Symplectes bicolor. In captivity I found they

which I purchased from my local pet store. I did find that the old grass
nests of the Thick-billed Weaver Amblyospiza albifrons, Spotted-backed
Weaver Ploceus cucullatus, Yellow Weaver P. subaureus and Masked
Weaver P. velatus were used for roosting only. Four to eight white eggs
were laid. The average measurements for 30 eggs recorded in the wild
were 14.6 x 11.4 (13.7 - 15.4 x 10.5 - 11.5). Both sexes incubated for
12 days with the young fledging at 19-21 days. Immature birds returned
to roost each night for a further 6-8 days in the breeding nest. The nest-
ing success of six nests was four to five fledglings per nest. Young birds
lack the black line through the eye and have duller red over the rump and
upper tail-coverts.

STRAY NOTES ON THE EUROPEAN TURTLE DOVE
By PHILIP G. SCHOFIELD

(Dorchester, Dorset)
Since seeing my first wild Turtle Doves Streptopelia turtur on a Suffolk
heath in my childhood, the species has been a favourite of mine. A locally
common breeding bird where conditions are suitable, its purring note can
be heard continuously from May to August in favoured areas, never
grating on the ear as can the trisyllabic hooting of the ubiquitous Collared
Dove S. decaocto. The Turtle Doves of my teens were relatively abundant
on the heathland to the east of my native Ipswich, nesting in scattered
hawthorns on the local golf courses, and feeding on the adjacent farmland.
Every nest I found was in a hawthorn, between five and eight feet (1.5 -
2.5 m) from the ground.
Young Turtle Doves, like most Passerine species but in contrast to the
domestic pigeon, have an unfortunate tendency to vacate the nest prema-
turely if disturbed. This must have happened to a somewhat bedraggled
youngster brought to me with a smashed wing in early June, 1971, having
been found with no visible means of support. I hand-reared this bird on
soaked British Finch mixture with a little soaked wheat, and it became
quite tame while caged indoors. Unfortunately the broken wing failed to
knit, and the damaged portion ultimately fell off, leaving an effectively
pinioned bird. This being so, (it was and is a hen) she could not be returned
to the wild, and is, in fact, still with me in robust health. The following
year I was able to obtain an aviary-bred male, and until his death last year
the pair reared many young. Their first few seasons were unsuccessful
until I realised that it is the male that selects the nest site, 'nest-calling'
(crouching and cooing with twitching wing tips) until the hen joins him
there. This behaviour is interrupted by spells of the cock 'driving' his mate,
often pecking at her head and neck; such pursuit stops when the female
is actually on the nest. Only then does nest construction begin. The hen
remains at the nest site while her mate collects short lengths of twig and
presents them to her; she then arranges them to her satisfaction. The
secret of breeding from my flightless female Turtle Dove lay in arranging
a sufficiently seductive nest site to attract the male, near enough to the
ground for the female to reach it without difficulty.
European Turtle Doves are easily sexed, the cock having a naked reddish
purple eye-ring which is lacking in the hen. This feature is already evident
when the young are still in juvenile plumage. Adult feather is assumed in
the spring of the year following that in which the bird was hatched. Adult

birds also become appreciably brighter at this season, apparently by the
same process of feather abrasion that brings the male Brambling Fringilla
montifringilla into summer plumage.
Although two nests appear to be usual in the wild, my captive Turtle
Doves have managed to rear three broods in a season. Even in a small
aviary some 6 ft (1.83 m sq), I found that young of successive broods
could safely remain with the parents until the following spring when they
had to be removed. I once lost a beautiful yearling hen by failing to re-
move her from the breeding aviary when the old male showed signs of
resenting her continued presence in spring. Presumably it is the assumption
of adult plumage that makes the difference between acceptance and aggres-
sion. I found the closely related Senegal, Palm or Laughing Dove S. sene-
galensis far less tolerant, young birds having to be removed from the
parents for their own safety as soon as they could feed themselves.
The two young in a nest are not necessarily the traditional 'pigeon pair'
of opposite sexes. Four young reared in two rounds in 1981 all laid eggs
the following spring.
My Turtle Doves have proved very amiable with other species, although
they will not agree with other Streptopelia species. I have seen them kept
under very crowded conditions with the domestic Barbary Dove S. 'risoria'
but only the latter bred, and not very successfully, under such conditions.
Turtles in my aviaries have lived peacefully with both Indian Green-winged
Chalcophaps indica and Stock Doves Columba oenas, these distantly rela-
ted birds ignoring each other's existence most of the time.
Turtle x Barbary hybrids are easily produced, and favour the Turtle in
the generation, having fewer bars on the neck and a long drawn-out di-
syllabic coo, very different from the single purring note of the Turtle or
the cuck-roocoo of the Barbary. I had a hybrid male for several years, but
only bred one young, which was to all intents and purposes a grey Bar-
bary - a reversion to the dominant colouring of the latter's wild ancestor,
the African Collared Dove S. roseogrisea. Having sold this F 2 young to a
dealer, together with a batch of young Barbaries, I never managed to rear
another. Both with the original Barbary hen, and later with a female
Collared Dove, fertility was excellent but few eggs actually hatched. Of
those that did, all the old hybrid's subsequent offspring died in the nest,
often as they were feathering. I have read of grey Barbary strains being
established from hybrids, so evidently not all Turtle hybrids are of limited
productive capabilities. However, a female hybrid which a friend kept at
liberty mated to a Barbary cock, never hatched an egg. Turtle Doves
would presumably cross with other Streptopelia as readily as with the
Barbary. A rarer hybrid is that with the domestic pigeon, which has been
achieved on a number of occasions, using a small Tippler or a Tumbler

I have referred to a female Barbary x Turtle hybrid kept at liberty. My
old hybrid cock was often allowed to fly free, but I always tried to ensure
that he roosted in the aviary, as Tawny Owls Strix aluco were abundant in
the area, and these birds are partial to dove suppers. An aggressive indivi-
dual, he would pursue local Collared Doves far over the horizon, but
never lost his way, always returning to his Barbary mate. The latter could
not be left free unsupervised, being of a naively trusting disposition where
cats and dogs were concerned. Not all these hybrids are such reliable
homers. A friend in Devon had four young of the year, grandchildren of
my old pair on their mother's side, flying free last autumn. Having deligh-
ted their breeder with much spectacular fast flying, they all disappeared on
the same day, and were presumed to have migrated.
While on the subject of migration, an odd thing happened to my old
pair of Turtles in 1978. At that time they were still in the care of my
parents at the family home in Ipswich. The male escaped at Easter of that
year, and although seen and heard in the gardens nearby, defied attempts
at recapture. However, towards the end of October, when the last of his
wild conspecifics had left for Africa, this aviary-bred bird returned home
and demanded access to the aviary, which needless to say was hastily
granted.
Although not normally found wild in these islands in winter, my Turtle
Doves have always proved extremely hardy, wintering in comfort with
only an open-fronted shelter which they always have the sense to use. A
wild bird in Dorset in the 1960's showed considerable enterprise. Having
decided (or been compelled by circumstances beyond its control) to spend
the winter in this country, it joined up with a free-flying flock of Barbaries
then kept at Portland Bird Observatory, eating their food and roosting
indoors with them at night!
My thirteen-year old hen Turtle Dove may with reasonable luck be with
me for some time to come. In the Avicultural Magazine for May 1936,
Dr. C.H Macklin refers to a Turtle Dove in his possession still in good
health at the age of 29!

Colius striatus
By SUSAN L. BERMAN
(Dept, of Biology, College of the Holy Cross, Worcester, Mass., USA)
Mousebirds (Coliiformes) have been the subject of natural history
accounts (Van Someren, 1956; Rowan, 1967), as well as systematic and
anatomical investigations (Murie, 1872; Garrod, 1896; Sclater, 1903;
Pycraft, 1907; Lowe, 1948; Verheyen, 1956; Berman and Raikow, 1982),
but behavioural studies of the group have been limited to isolated and
often conflicting reports. The following observations are a by-product of a
morphological study of the hindlimb musculature of the order (Berman &amp;
Raikow, 1982). In confirming our functional interpretation of peculiarities
of the hindlimb, I observed two small colonies of captive Colius striatus,
the Speckled Mousebird, for 14 months. The purpose of this paper is to
report findings that are in conflict with previous studies, as well as those
not previously recorded, and to confirm observations of uncertain validity.
All of the birds were acquired from the Pittsburgh Aviary. They were
trapped out of a very large indoor area from a flock that had been breed-
ing freely for five years. They had not been banded, hence age and rela-
tionships were uncertain. I was unable to sex them using Gibson's method
(1980) or any other external characters. Individuals were distinguished
from one another by notches in their rectrices. One eventually revealed
itself to be a female by copulation and egg-laying.
The first colony initially consisted of five, and later eight birds. They
were housed indoors in a wire mesh cage 5 x 3 x 6 ft high (1.53 x 0.92 x
1.83 m high), containing a network of dead branches along with fresh
pine brances suspended from the roof. The birds were maintained on a
diet of fresh fruit and vegetables placed in a container hung 3 ft (0.92 m)
above the floor. Water was provided in a shallow bowl on the floor. A tray
12 x 16 x 2 in (0.35 x 0.97 x 0.05 m) containing fine sand was placed in
one corner of the cage to permit dust-bathing. This colony was observed
from September 1980 to August 1981.
A second colony of six individuals (one of the original colony and five
new birds) was kept in a large outdoor aviary measuring 25 x 10 x 7 ft
high (7.75 x 3.10 x 2.17 m), half of which was completely enclosed. A
diet that was identical to that of the first colony was provided, but as the
mousebirds shared the aviary with six peafowl, commercial turkey feed
was available on the ground. This colony was observed from mid-August
1982 to late October 1982.

SUSAN L. BERMAN - SPECKLED MOUSEBIRD
Use of water
There have been some questions concerning the use of water by mouse-
birds. Gibson (1979) never observed the C. macrouris in his aviary drinking
water. Rowan (1967) observed the three South African species (C. colius,
C. indicus and C. striatus ) drinking water in the wild, but only C. striatus
took water in his aviary. Moreover, the birds drank using suction, as in the
Columbiformes. Shifter (1972) observed captive C. indicus, C. macrouris
and C. striatus drinking a mixture of honey and water. Each of the C. stri-
atus in my aviaries were observed drinking in this manner at least once.
Observations were made for varying periods at different times of the day,
and records of the frequency of each individual's trips to the water were
not kept. But, as the total number of instances recorded each week
throughout the 14 months was from three to five, drinking seems to be
reasonably common behaviour in C. striatus. It is likely that relative
humidity and moisture content of their diet determine the quantity of
water consumed.
Rowan (1967) observed water bathing in pet mousebirds, but never
in his aviary birds. Schifter (1972) observed captive C. indicus, C. mac-
rouris and C. striatus bathing against wet leaves. Gibson (1980) records
captive C. macrouris bathing against wet flower heads. On three occasions
in the small indoor aviary (twice in September and once in January) I
observed different individuals of C. striatus bathing in the water dish on
the floor. The baths lasted from three to five minutes and the birds got
little more than their breast and abdomen wet. On another occasion, in
late September, three of the birds in the indoor colony were induced to
bathe from branches when misted with a hand sprayer. Bathing behaviour
was not observed in the outdoor aviary, but it is likely that the birds took
advantage of the rain, rather than using the water dish.
Food-sharing
Whereas Rowan (1967) reports only occasional food-sharing between
captive adult C. colius, C. striatus and C. indicus , this was a very common
activity among the birds in both of my colonies. Food items were often
carried to a waiting individual clear at the opposite end of the cage. Three
of the birds engaged in this activity among themselves more often than
with the others, and two of these three later proved to be a pair. Food-
sharing, however, was never observed in connection with courtship or cop-
ulation, as described by Schifter (1967).
In addition, a teasing behaviour with some preferred food item was
common. Typically a bird would carry the item to the vicinity of some
individual at a distance from the food dish. Holding the item in the bill,
the bird would point it first toward and then away from the other bird

with short, upward jerks of the head. This usually resulted in the item
being stolen, and in eight observed instances this theft was accomplished
with the foot, rather than the bill.
Courtship and nesting behaviour
There are only a few accounts of courtship behaviour in mousebirds.
James (1948) described a display followed by copulation in C. indicus.
In this case it was the female that carried out the display. Rowan (1967)
described the same display in a tame C. indicus. As it was not followed
by copulation, the sex of the bird was not determined. Schifter (1967)
gives a description of breeding behaviour in C. indicus, C. macrouris and
C. striatus.
From November 1980 onwards, I frequently observed courtship and
copulation in one pair of C. striatus kept in the indoor aviary. The display
was similar to that given by the previous descriptions with one exception.
Whereas Schiften (1967) observed his C. striatus bouncing only 1 cm
above the branch, mine consistently bounced a full 4 cm, like that des-
cribed for other species. In each case only the male displayed. Typically
after about five minutes of the 'bouncing and hooing' behaviour, the fe-
male would land next to him and copulation, lasting from 3-4 s, would
take place immediately. The same pair constructed nests on four occasions
(Table 1). The nests were as described by Rowan (1967). Pieces of string,
twigs, and dried grass were the main constituents. Overgrown broccoli, a
favourite food, was often supplied in July. The nest constructed at that
time was regularly 'decorated' with yellow broccoli flowers. The stems had
been poked into the substance of the nest, and the flowers hung down
below. Rowan (1967) has also observed this habit in C. striatus.
Both parents took turns incubating. Rowan (1967) suggests that at
least in the South African species more than two birds may participate in
construction of a nest, and that a nest may contain the eggs of more than
one hen. I never observed any interest in a nest on the part of birds other
than the parents. None of the eggs hatched, and each nest was abandoned

after three weeks. Examination of the eggs in the April clutch revealed
embryos in a very early stage of development. I suspect that failure of the
first three attempts may have been due to low temperatures in the room
where the birds were kept.
Rowan (1967) compiled data indicating that South African mouse-
birds are capable of breeding any time of the year, but do so most fre-
quently during the warmer months, and at times when vegetation is put-
ting on new growth. Schifter (1967) concluded that mousebirds were
opportunistic, breeding at any time of the year when conditions were
favourable. I found no correlation between temperature and breeding
behaviour, but almost all my observations of courtship and copulation
took place following two or three days of rain, such as might promote
rapid plant growth given the proper temperatures.
Agonistic behaviour
Gibson (1979) and Rowan (1967) comment on the gregarious and
non-aggressive nature of mousebirds. Rowan actually relates incidents
in which different flocks of the same species were drawn together, ap-
parently fully accepting one another. Likewise, Schifter (1972) kept three
species (C. indicus, C. macrouris and C. striatus ) in the same aviary and
never observed any conflicts. My observations were quite the opposite.
Each group of birds had been caught in the same trap, hence it seems
likely that they were foraging together and were members of the same
family group. In any case, there was no aggression among the first five
birds, which had been trapped together and introduced into the cage with
the original five. Fighting broke out immediately. The original group
banded together and chased the new birds, biting them on the feet and
the back of the head. At one point one of the aggressors used his foot
to seize one of the new birds by the tail, pull him off a branch, and dangle
him upside down momentarily.
After 45 minutes the fighting began to diminish and the two groups
retired to opposite sides of the cage. Eight hours after the introduction of
the new birds, individuals of the two groups were feeding quietly from the
same dish. When they all roosted in the same clump, it seemed that inte-
gration had taken place, confirming previous reports of the peaceful
nature of these birds. No further aggression was observed during the next
14 days.
On the morning of the fifteenth day, after hearing an unusual amount
of vocalisation from the aviary, I found the three new birds dead. They
had all been killed in the same manner: the feathers on the back of the
head had been pulled off, the skull opened, and part of the brain removed.
One of the original five was still occupied with a victim as I approached
the cage, hence the possibility of rodents can be discounted.

The same sequence of events took place in the larger aviary. After
three seemingly peaceful weeks, the bird from the original flock was
killed in the same manner, presumably by the five new birds, which had
been trapped together.
It can certainly be argued that, both being captive, and thus unnatural
situations, this is not normal behaviour. However, as the four birds were
killed in the same manner, and by birds of another group, it is possible
that this is part of their behavioural repertoire. At the very least, these
observations shed doubt on previous reports of the consistently peaceful
nature of these birds.
Digit configurations
Mousebirds have long been of interest morphologically because of
their ability to rotate both the hallux and the fourth digit cranially and
caudally, producing zygodactyly, anisodactyly, or pamprodactyly. Digit
configurations are often associated with certain postures or activities in
the groups possessing them, so it seemed possible that in mousebirds
certain arrangements could be correlated with particular activities. Initial
observations (Berman and Raikow, 1982) as well as these subsequent
studies indicate that this is not the case in at least one species. C. striatus
is entirely opportunistic in its digit configurations. Opposability of the
first and fourth digits enables the foot to conform to or grasp any surface
with which it comes into contact.

A QUESTION OF IDENTITY
By TONY SILVA
(Illinois, USA)
Correct identification of certain subspecies of parrots is a problem that
</figure>

everyone eventually faces. Normally their correct identity is irrelevant,
except when pairing for breeding but there are two parrots whose misid-
entification can prove costly - to the extent of several hundred dollars.
Allow me to explain.
Almost monthly I receive calls from aviculturists having one problem
or another with the Tres Marias Amazon Amazona ochrocephala tres-
mariae, (subspecies of the Yellow-crowned Amazon), an insular parrot
found on four islands off Nayarit, western Mexico. The scientific and
common names are derived from three of these islands - Maria Madre,
Maria Magdalena and Maria Cleofas. The fourth island, the smallest in the
group, is called San Juanico.
Confusion arises because Yellow-crowned Amazons of the subspecies
magna, from the Atlantic lowlands in Tamaulipas to Tabasco, or older
Double Yellow-crowned Amazons (subspecies oratrix ) are frequently,
but incorrectly, called 'Tres Marias Amazons'.
Until 1981 I accepted birds heavily endowed in yellow as tresmariae ,
but that year a visit to the Los Angeles County Museum started to cast a
doubt. In the upper archives were several specimens collected by K.S.
Stager in 1956 on Maria Madre. They certainly differed from what avicul-
turists were calling 'Tres Marias Amazons'.

I-
Sometime later I met Walt Hansen, an aviculturist in San Diego, who
told me of his interest in tresmariae and in visiting the island to see what
the lineament was of live birds. I encouraged him to travel there. After
some difficulty - visits to the island are controlled by the Mexican Depart-
ment of Prevention and Social Re-adaptation, given that the whole of
Maria Madre is a penal colony - he received permission from the Director
General Licenciado Antonio Garcia Orozco. In the second week of April
1983 he arrived on Maria Madre via a Mexican navy vessel.
His return to the US disclosed some interesting and (for me) unsur-
prising information: the true tresmariae is very much unlike those that
have been referred to as such in the trade. His evidence is backed by a
number of photographs of adults and young - a move that should quell
those that impugned his findings, doing so presumably because they
would be unable to procure the very large sums obtained from tresmariae
I
for magna or old oratrix.
Walt Hansen published his findings in the February/March 1984 issue
of Watchbird. Details can be summarised as follows:
Immature birds have far more yellow than typical oratrix , approximat-
ing that of magna ; it extends to the terminus of cheeks, or is about equal
to that found in four year old oratrix. The head of adult tresmariae is
covered in an 'indefinable' colour of yellow, which is noticeable in skins; it
lacks the intensity of that found in magna. The bend of wing of the insular
birds has very little yellow and red, the extent being identical to typical
oratrix. Yellow on the thighs is reduced to a minimum, not nearly
covering the complete area as in some magna. Prominent in tresmariae and
not in other Yellow-crowned (including belizensis, the Belize Yellow-
crowned) is a bluish wash to underparts - a characteristic prominent even
in study skins.
Why did confusion arise? My opinion is that it can be attributed to the
absence of magna from Forshaw's Parrots of the World (Lansdowne Press,
Australia); he amalgamated magna with oratrix. Virtually everyone dealing
with parrots uses this mongraph as the standard, but given the absence of
magna thinks that the birds heavily endowed with yellow belong to
tresmariae.
The Atlantic magna was described by B.L. Monroe and T.R. Howell in
a paper published by the Museum of Zoology, Louisiana State University,
in 1966. Characteristics are noted in this subspecies as follows: size is large
(from whence the scientific name is derived - in this respect it exceeds
both oratrix and tresmariae ), and head is entirely yellow, a colour that is
extensive on thighs and bend of wings (which also contain red). A linea-
ment often obvious but not noted by Monroe and Howell is the presence
of reddish edged or tinged feathers in the nape of male magna and tres-

mariae.
Using the above criteria, there are no tresmariae in confinement in the
US to my knowledge, but there are a number of oratrix and magna, the
last having arrived (legally and illegally) in any quantity since the late
1970's.
The other enigma is the Triton Cockatoo Cacatua galerita triton from
Indonesia, New Guinea and certain small islands. It can be separated from
the other races of galerita by the broader crest feathers, blue orbital ring,
longer nape feathers and (in many) heavier bill. Tritons are often confused
with Medium Sulphur-crested Cockatoos C.s. eleonora, which has a
smaller, slimmer bill, narrower crest feathers, smaller size and white
orbital ring, though immatures may have a blueish tinge to the perio-
phthalmic ring; this area thickens with age, when it turns white.
Using measurements in Parrots of the World one gets the impression
that differences between triton and eleonora are not substantial - but they
are. Living birds, side by side, show the aforementioned features.
As with tresmariae , the prices fetched by triton are far greater than for
Mediums, often called Eleonora Cockatoos, after the scientific name.
Correct identification of these two parrots on both the part of the seller
and buyer is therefore imperative.

Whilst we would never wish to cramp an author's style in any way, even
less to discourage members from writing at all, we are sometimes asked for
guidelines as to what is needed, and it may well be that valuable informa-
tion is going unrecorded because authors did not realise that it was of in-
terest. Therefore the following notes are offered as suggestions, but not
rules, for contributors to the Avicultural Magazine:
Articles should be preferably typed (in double spacing), but neatly
hand-written articles are perfectly acceptable. They must not have been
published elsewhere in the same form. The scientific names of birds
should be given as well as the vernacular and alternate vernacular names.
We prefer not to include long and complicated tables but can add a note
saying that copies of these are available from the Editor, on request.
The maximum length of articles is usually 5,000 words but longer
articles can be published in separate instalments; there is no minimum
length and indeed short notes or letters for inclusion in the Correspon-
dence Column are always welcome.

The following guidelines may be of help when making notes and later
in writing them up. It must be emphasised that these are ideal requirements
and that the lack of some of this information should in no way discourage
authors. Less fully comprehensive accounts, provided they give accurate
information, are always welcome.
However, in the case of a presumed first breeding in the British Isles,
where the author is claiming the Society's Medal, it should be pointed out
that the Society's Rules require that: 'The account of the breeding must
be reasonably full so as to afford information to our Members, and must
appear in the Avicultural Magazine before it is published elsewhere. It
should describe the plumage of the young, and be of value as a permanent
record of the nesting and general habits of the species. These points will
have great weight when the question of awarding the Medal is under con-
sideration.'
Ideally a breeding report should try to give the following information:
A brief description of the species, its distribution and habitat, its
status in the wild and in aviculture. Longevity, if known. Whether a
good avicultural subject.
History of breeding pair - ages, how long kept, whether captive bred,
any previous breeding attempts.
Description of accommodation - sizes of indoor and outdoor aviaries,
layout, how furnished, whether and how heated, whether shared,
other birds in adjoining aviaries.
Diet, including vitamin and mineral additives; how many meals a day
and when given.
Veterinary and hygiene notes.
Breeding:
Nest-box - description and when put in. Nesting material.

In reference to Dr. Quinque's paper on breeding the
Cloven-feathered Dove (Drepanoptila holosericea)
In common, I presume, with all other readers of our magazine who
have any interest in either doves or bird behaviour, I read with great
interest and pleasure Dr. Henry Quinque's article (in Vol. 91, Nos. 1 and 2
of our magazine) on his breeding of the Cloven-feathered Dove.
Considered only from an avicultural point of view (and I do not write
'only' in any deprecatory sense, far from it), the repeated successes that
have justly crowned his painstaking and no doubt costly efforts must be a
source of great satisfaction to himself and should arouse the commenda-
tion and admiration of others.
From the point of view of bird behaviour, his article brings us the first
proof that in at least one species of pigeon only the hen incubates, broods
and feeds the young. This proof comes at a most timely moment, as some
recent observations in the wild on three other fruit doves have suggested,
though not with certainty proved, that in them also only the females
build, incubate, brood and feed young.
These three species are the Orange Dove Ptilinopus victor , the Golden
Dove P. luteovirens and the Green or Velvet Dove P. layardi. They are
sometimes put in a separate genus Chrysoena, and although in my pigeon
book, I gave Chrysoena only subgeneric rank, I may well have been wrong
to do so.
These three species all occur in the Fiji Islands, no two occurring
together on any one island. Although much smaller than the Cloven-
feathered Dove and quite distinct from it, their shape and plumage texture
suggest (at least to me) that they and Drepanoptila are more closely
related to each other than any of them is to the more typical species of
Ptilinopus. None of them shows comparable differences in the size of the
sexes to those of the Cloven-feathered Dove but two of them show marked
sexual differences in colour, that in the Orange Dove being perhaps the
greatest in any pigeon as the adult cock is almost all brilliant orange and
the hen almost all dark green in colour.
A nest of the Orange Dove and a nest of the Green Dove, found in the
wild, were each visited on several occasions at different times of day and
only the hens found on them. A female of the Golden Dove was seen
carrying a twig to its nest site (usually the male's 'job' in the pigeon
family) and then building with it. A few years ago, William N. Beckon
wrote a most stimulating paper on these three odd Fijian doves, pointing
out that the above observations, and some others not involving nests, all
strongly suggested even though they did not conclusively prove that these
three doves might be polygynous, with successful males holding territory

in which more than one female nested and reared her young. Dr Beckon
kindly sent me a pre-publication copy of his paper (which I still have) but,
unfortunately, I do not now recall whether, or if so where, it was pub-
lished.
One of Dr. Quinque's most intriguing observations is that the male
Clovenfeathered Dove, in the days prior to the hen's laying, 'descends to
the ground .and remains there quite a long time' at intervals. Is it
possible that in the wild display and copulation take place on or near the
ground? Or even that the Cloven-feathered Dove may, like some other
mainly arboreal tropical forest birds, be a 'lek' bird that has its display or
mating places on the forest floor?.
Such a question as the last may sound absurd but not more absurd,
surely, than it would have been ten years or so ago to ask the same ques-
tion about any parrot? Yet we now know (see, inter alia, p. 55 of the same
issue of our magazine) that one parrot does do this. And a flightless one at
that!
As he does not describe it, I presume that, at the time of his writing the
article, Dr. Quinque had not actually seen copulation by his Cloven-
feathered Doves. If he now has, I hope he will describe it in our magazine
together, of course, with any other new observations he makes on these
birds.
It is to be hoped that Dr. Quinque, and later others, will be able to
perpetuate this unique and beautiful dove in captivity. Also that adequate
protection from sportsmen (or are French bird protectionists, like their
British counterparts, legally bound not to oppose 'legitimate sport'?) and
adequate reserves of suitable habitat can and will be maintained for it in its
native island.
Indeed, at risk of annoying conventional conservationists, and first
assuring them that our fair editor is not responsible for the opinions of her
correspondents, I would suggest that if numbers of Cloven-feathered Doves
can be bred, and if an island (or better still two or three islands) can be
found where it would seem likely to thrive and unlikely to incommode
any bird as rare, unique and beautiful as itself, there would be a very good
case for introducing and trying to establish it elsewhere.

Sulking in Parrots
Two unusual events occurred recently in our collection of parrots, that
I have not come across before, and both occurred during the same week
and in two individuals of the same species.
Placing unmated birds in outdoor enclosures amongst suitable com-
panions is always a problem, and involves consideration of many factors
including the strength, temperament, flying ability and food accessibility
of and for all the inmates - but is always easier if none of them have been
resident in the aviary for too long.
I have a small range of six aviaries, too public to be suitable for breed-
ing pairs, that I have been using for new introductions to the Park, mixed
with unmated birds, and I consider four birds of a parrot size to be suffic-
ient for each.
In one flight I had two cock Thick-billed Parrots Rhynchopsitta pachy-
rhyncha, cage-cramped and unable to fly very well, and one adult hen
Zimbabwean Cape Parrot Poicephalus suahelicus which was fit and active
and they had been together for two months or so. Next door I had a
newly-introduced cock and hen South African Cape Parrots P.r. robustus
still a little cage-cramped, but becoming active and vocal and beginning to
take an interest in each other and they had been out of doors for six weeks
or so. Further on, I had two cock Slender-billed Cockatoos Cacatua e. pas-
tinator.
I had a spare cock Bare-eyed Cockatoo Cacatua sanguinea for which I
had to find an aviary so I put it in the first aviary. The Thick-billed Parrots
showed aggression to it but since it was a good flyer, it could quietly
move out of the way and by the end of the day, things had settled down
with the Cape Parrot hen and cockatoo cock showing not the slightest
interest in each other. Incidentally, my experience with Cape Parrots is
that they can show unprovoked aggression towards other birds and are
generally not good mixers.
The next morning the Zimbabwean Cape hen was sitting in the sun, on
the ground below the feeding table, surrounded by sunflower seed, and I
thought nothing of it until in the afternoon she was still sitting in the same
place and I became suspicious. I got one of the staff to move her as she
was so obviously weak. We took her inside to the bird room, put her in
a cage with heat and gave her antibiotics in the drinking water as a pre-
caution but by the evening she could barely lift her head. She obviously
was too weak to feed herself and so was force-fed with moistened Pro-
Nutro.
But to cut a long story short, she survived and within the week was
100% fit again. One explanation for this could be that she had to change

her night roosting place because of the new inmate, and got a chill as a
consequence but since the nights here at that time were very mild, I do
not think this would apply. Anyhow, I had my doubts until the second
incident occurred.
A few days later I put a single hen Lesser Sulphur-crested Cockatoo
Cacatua sulphurea in with the pair of South African Cape Parrots and
this time I was watching the reactions more carefully. There was abso-
lutely no interest of any kind shown between the three birds and one
could have concluded that they had been together for years.
However, there was one small difference in the activity of the Cape
Parrots - the hen was flitting about, calling as usual, but the cock bird
was sitting against the back wall as if he was roosting for the night. I
checked on him at least six times a day and always he was in the same
position. Bearing in mind the incident in the next door aviary, I removed
the cockatoo and immediately the cock Cape Parrot flew over to the
clip-on food dish and started to feed. I dsitribute many feeding sites
when I mix birds, or first introduce them to new quarters, and he had
easy access to two, and was, in fact, sitting above one seed tray, so food
was no problem. By the following day he was his old self again.
I can only conclude from these two unusual happenings that the
Poicephalus parrots, including Jardine's P. gulielmi which is a poor travel-
ler, are uncommon in captivity because possibly their stress factor is not
fully understood. There is no doubt that they were distressed by the
introductions of a new bird and showed this, not by aggression, but by
sulking. They were fully used to seeing the white cockatoos next door.
Finally, I have at least got a pair of Zimbabwean Cape Parrots sitting
on eggs (June 1965) but they are winter breeders here and we now have
two pairs of each variety in the collection, and the pair of South African
Cape Parrots mentioned above are looking in their box and taking an
interest in each other.
