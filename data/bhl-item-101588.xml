For the Year igoS-g.
The completion of the present Volume brings our second
series to a close, the Committee having considered it desirable
to commence a new series with the issue for November.
We believe that the present Volume will be found equal
in every way to those that have preceded it, and to contain a
large amount of valuable avicultural matter. The usual number
of plates, both coloured and otherwise, have appeared, and are
well up to the Society's high standard.
The year has seen some considerable changes as regards
its officers. In May last Mr. Seth-Smith, being obliged to
resign the post of Hon. Editor, on his appointment as Curator
of Birds at the Zoological Society's Gardens, the Committee
thought it advisable to appoint an Editor at a small salary, and
were fortunate enough to secure the services of Mr. Frank
Finn, certain members of the Society having generously con-
tributed to a fund raised for this purpose.
The Committee regret to announce that the Hon. Business
Secretary, Mr. T. H. Newman, having served for five years, has
decided that he will not seek re-election for another term. They
are pleased to announce that Mr. R. I. Pocock has kindly con-
sented to fill the post. Mr. Frank Andrews will act as
Secretary's Assistant at a small remuneration.
As we are about to embark upon a new series, the Com-
mittee sincerely hope that the members will make a great effort
to increase the size and usefulness of the journal by their con-
tributions. We want, not only records of the breeding of rare
birds, but accounts of common species of foreign birds and of
British Birds. The latter seem to have been somewhat neglected
by aviculturists lately, but our members are reminded that the

Report of the Council. v.
Avicultural Magazine includes in its scope British as well as
foreign birds, and the Editor will always be glad to receive con-
tributions on this subject for publication.
Members are reminded that they can always help the
Society by introducing the Magazine to those who are un-
acquainted with it, and by proposing them as new members, for
only by this means can the numbers of the Society be increased.
Finally, the Committee desire to thank all those members
who have helped to produce the present volume by contributing
to its pages.
Signed for the Council,

The Medal may be awarded, at the discretion of the Committee, to-
any Member who shall succeed in breeding, in the United Kingdom, any
species of bird which shall not be known to have been previously bred in
captivity in Great Britain or Ireland. Any Member wishing to obtain the
Medal must send a detailed account for publication in the Magazine within
about eight weeks from the date of hatching of the young and furnish
such evidence of the facts as the Executive Committee may require. The
Medal will be awarded only in cases where the young shall live to be old
enough to feed themselves, and to be wholly independent of their parents.
The account of the breeding must be reasonably full so as to afford
instruction to our Members, and should describe the plumage of the young
and be of value as a permanent record of the nesting and general habits of the
species. These points will have great weight when the question of awarding
the Medal is under consideration.
The parents of the young must be the bona fide property of the
breeder. An evasion of this rule, in any form whatever, will not only dis-
qualify the breeder from any claim to a Medal in that particular instance,
but will seriously prejudice any other claims he or she may subsequently
advance for the breeding of the same or any other species.
In every case the decision of the Committee shall be final.
The Medal will be forwarded to each Member as soon after it shall
have been awarded as possible.
The Medal is struck in bronze (but the Committee reserve the right
to issue it in silver in very special cases), and measures inches in
diameter. It bears on the obverse a representation of two birds with a nest
containing eggs, and the words " The Avicultural Society--Founded 1894."
On the reverse is the following inscription : " Awarded to ( name of donee}

THE KING BIRD OF PARADISE.
Cicinnums regius.
By Mrs. Johnstone.
I do not think I shall ever forget the excitement in our
household produced by the first arrival of two King Birds of
Paradise in 1904. They arrived in the autumn of that year, and
were two lovely cocks in glorious plumage and condition. They
were looked at a dozen times a day to make sure they were alive
and well, and I used to waste hours watching their pretty move-
ments and admiring the smoke grey plumes tipped with vivid
green which, when resting, they spread out like dainty fans from
under the wings. They were admired and envied by all, and
Mons. L'Hoest of Antwerp made a special journey to Rougham
to see them. Finally Mr. Pocock carried them off in triumph to
the Gardens, where they lived, I hope, happily, but not as long
as their successors have every appearance of doing; for four more
perfect specimens it would be hard to find than are at present in
the New Bird House of the Zoological Gardens.*
Mr. Goodfellow, their importer, was successful in obtain-
ing several pairs; the following year his example was followed
by other importers, who also brought pairs to England. Of these
birds, from what I can hear, not a large number remain alive.
The Zoological Society possess two pairs in perfect con-
dition, and beyond this, including my own, only three aviaries
possess pairs of these lovely birds; and it is of my own five birds
(two cocks and three hens) I am asked to write a short account.
Most unfortunately the two adult males in the Zoological Gardens have quite recently
died.--E d.

On the King Bird of Paradise.
Not an easy task as, of all birds I have ever kept, these are the
most difficult and yet the most interesting to study. I do not
think I need describe them, the beautiful plate gives a splendid
idea of the beauty of the bird ; but of one thing there is no doubt
no pen could describe, no artist paint, the marvellous glea?n on
the red feathers of the King Bird of Paradise. The feathers are
more like hairs, a gleaming shining crimson, shading to orange
plush on the top of the head.
The cock in the aviary is exceedingly shy. Now and
again he can be seen in the thick bushes, in the outside flight of
the aviary, and then it is a pleasure to watch the quick dancing
movements, up a slender bough, springing from side to side or
hanging head downwards, eagerly scanning the long grass in
search of insects. The instant he realises he is being watched
there is a flash of crimson and he is gone--to the dark, quiet fir
boughs thickly placed at the top of his aviary.
The hen is a most entrancing little bird, very lively and
comparatively tame. She has the same quick dainty movements
as the cock, but does not in the least mind being watched.
These birds when they were first imported arrived in fairs,
or so-called pairs. I quite realised that the young cock does not
assume the red plumage for some time (I believe three years), so
it was not a matter of great surprise to me when, in the following
spring after their importation, one of my hens turned into acock.
Since then another hen has assumed the red plumage, and as I
was unable to keep so many cocks, I sold them, and at intervals
have heard of them at various great birds shows, causing much
admiration and interest.
If now I was asked to choose a hen King bird from amongst
several apparent hens, I should choose a small bird, not very
clearly marked and not a very yellow bill. Both my hen birds,
who eventually became cocks, were fine bold birds, large, and I
should have said particularly fine hens. The immature cock is
not shy, only when he assumes his very brilliant plumage does he
become so, a wonderful instinct, and a great protection against
birds of prey, etc.
These birds have many and varied calls. I thought I knew
them all--from the gurgling little song to the long clear call--

but just lately I have heard many other calls, and there has been
much excitement in the aviary, the cock constantly displaying to
the liens, and all the birds showing that something unusual is
taking place. Can it be that this is their breeding season and
nesting may be contemplated.
Mr. Goodfellow who has seen a nest and eggs of this bird,
describes it as composed of small sticks and lined with fibre and
placed in low scrubby bushes. As to whether or no they are
polygamous is unknown. Mr. Goodfellow thinks it probable; it
is certain he says that the hen rears the young birds when
hatched, alone, the cock being driven away, but whether or no
he nests again with another mate is uncertain. A young bird
brought to him by the natives in an almost featherless condition
was hand reared by him on hard-boiled egg and banana, for a
time, until one of the caged hens took the youngster and com-
pleted the rearing, feeding entirely on egg and banana. This
bird was for over a year in Mr. Astley's aviaries, and finally
returned to mine; it was in perfect health and condition, so there
should be no difficulty in rearing the young if the birds nest.
There will not be that exhausting drain on both purse and
patience which the constant supply of live insects necessitates in
the rearing of the young of the majority of insectivorous birds.

CURASSOW.
(Crax hecki&amp;apos;).
By R. I. Pocock, F.R.S., M.B.O.U.
Superintendent of the Zoological Society 1 s Gardens.
Perhaps the most interesting event in bird-breeding
during the past summer in the Zoological Gardens has been the
hatching and, up to the present time, successful rearing of two
Curassows.
In the Society's fine collection of these birds, the Globose
Curassow (Crax globicera ) has been represented for some years
by three specimens, a cock and two hens. As is the rule in
gallinaceous birds the sexes differ considerably from one another.
The cock not only has at the base of the beak a large clear

Mr. R. I. Pocock,
yellow globular caruncle, whence the technical and trivial names
of the species are derived, but is also fairly uniformly black in
colour with the belly and vent white. The lieu, on the contrary,
which is but little inferior to the cock in size, has no excresence
and no yellow upon the base of the beak, and is totally differently
coloured. The feathers of the head and upper part of the neck
are black with white bars ; the lower part of the neck is black
and unbarred, and the black tint gradually fades into the brown
black mottled hue which pervades the rest of the body with the
exception of the breast and belly which are ruddy-buff.
In the compartment of the Eastern A.viary usually
occupied by these birds there has also been for some years a hen
example of another species of Cnrassow, which was named by
Reichenow Crax hecki, in honour of Dr. Heck, the distinguished
Director of the Zoological Gardens in Berlin. So far as the
colour of the plumage is concerned this is a very different looking
bird from the hens of the Globose Curassow. On the head and
neck the white predominates to such an extent that the feathers
may be described as white with black bars; while those of the
upper side of the body are mostly black and brown, barred with
white and buff, the lower side being wholly of the latter colour.
Yet in spite of the differences between the hen birds, there
is no doubt that the two species are nearly allied. Indeed the
presence or absence of bars on the feathers of hen Curassows
may be an uncertain and deceptive guide to affinity; for. as has
been recorded by Mr. Ogilvie-Grant, in the hens of Sclater's
Curassow (Crax fcisciolata ), of which there is an example now
living in the Gardens, the white bars appear to decrease with age
whereas, according to Reichenow, they became more pronounced
during the two years that the typical example of Heck's
Curassow lived in Berlin.
I do not know the meaning of the difference in colour
between hen Curassows with white - barred, and those with
uniformly darlc-toned plumage. But when one compares the
striped hens of Sclater's and Heck's Curassows with the un-
striped dark liued specimens of the Globose and Yarrell's
Curassows exhibited in the Gardens, the suspicion arises that the
differences must coincide with some differences of environment

or habit, and probably have a protective, or to be more accurate
a procryptic, significance. Perhaps indeed the striped species
frequent forests where the foliage is comparatively thin and
allows the light to flicker and filter through ; while the unstriped
species, may-be, occur in places where the dense foliage shuts-
out the light and produces sombre surroundings in harmony
with the dusky plumage of the birds.
Now our cock Globose Curassow never displayed any
special friendliness towards either of the hens of his own species ;
but, on the contrary, seemed to be more attracted by the hen of
Heck's Curassow. Why this preference for an alien I do not
know. A taste for a variegated pattern of plumage, sexual
selectionists might suppose. Possibly; rather do I suspect, how-
ever, that the guiding factor in the choice was some subtle sense
whereby he learnt that this particular hen was a likely breeder.
However that may be, when in 1906 the Curassows were placed
for the summer months in our great aviary, this pair bred and a
chicken was hatched, which unfortunately did not live for long.
While the breeding and incubation were in progress, the pair
proved impossible inmates of the aviary where other birds had to
be kept. The cock wanted the entire place for himself and his
mate, and there was no peace from sunrise to sunset. During 1907
they were left in the Eastern Aviary, and no inclination to pair
was evinced by either bird. In the spring of the current year, a
compartment of our Northern Pheasantry was set apart for them,,
all other birds being excluded except a pair of White-crowned
Pigeons, which we thought--wrongly as it turned out--would
not interfere with them. Our expectations that they would breed
were verified.
Towards the end of June the cock bird made a nest of
willow twigs up in the branches under the shed at the back of
the enclosure ; and in this two eggs, which by the way were white,
were laid. But the White-crowned Pigeons also wanted to make
use of the nest, and the disturbance caused by the Curassows&amp;apos;
resentment of this trespass, resulted, it is believed, in the smash-
ing of both eggs. I11 any case they were found broken on the
nest. This accident was soon remedied. The pigeons were taken
away, fresh willow twigs were supplied and were woven into the

nest by the cock, and about a week after the loss of the first eggs,
the hen laid a couple more. This was on July 12th. During the
first ten days of incubation the hen was frequently off the nest
during the day but sat all through the night. After that time
she sat close during the day, only leaving her post to feed. The
cock, be it noted, although diligent in constructing the nest, took
no part in the incubation of the eggs ; nor did he feed his mate
while sitting. Early in the morning of the twenty-eighth day
after the eggs were laid, that is to say on August 8th, the chicks
were found sitting on the edge of the nest, with the ben on the
ground below calling upon them to descend. This they soon did,
dropping without hurt a height of about five feet, and presumably
breaking the fall by means of their wings which were furnished
with flight feathers perhaps about an inch long, and resembling
in this particular the wings of newly-hatched Brush Turkeys.
Their wings however were not strong enough to enable them to
get up into the nest again ; and I do not know whether at that
time they would have availed themselves, as they did afterwards,
of facilities for climbing up, had they been provided. For the
first five nights the hen brooded them on the ground. After that
she roosted high up on the perch ; and they, left to take care of
themselves, roosted on a branch below, but as near to her as they
could get. Extra branches were then put in. Of these they at
once took advantage, and thereafter climbed to the perch and
roosted every night by her side. When the three were about 011
the ground together during the day time the chicks ran to their
mother's wings for shelter in case of alarm or if rain came on, just
like the chickens of pheasants or fowls. When food was given to
them the hen picked up the pieces in her beak, and in response
to her crooning call the chicks ran up and took it from her. Some-
times she made no attempt to tender the food to them but merely
stood still and let the first one that reached her take it. At other
times she would deliberately present it to one or the other.
This method of feeding the young is intermediate between the
method ordinarily practised by rasorinal gallinaceous birds and
that adopted by ordinary passerine species. They were fed at
first upon mealworms and hard boiled yolk of egg. The white of
the egg the mother would not touch. Afterwards they took to

vegetable food, and I have frequently seen the mother sum-
mon them for pieces of bread and broken up ground-nuts given
to her by passing visitors.
Whether the cock bird would have taken any part in feed-
ing the chickens I do not know. He had to be taken away
because it was impossible to attend to the wants of the hen and
Hen of Heck&amp;apos;s Curassow, feeding her io -weeks old chick.

28 Mr. R. I. Pocock,
*chickens on account of the vigour with which he assaulted the
keeper *
When six weeks old the chickens were about the size of
Partridges, but looked larger on account of the great develop-
ment of the long feathers of the wings and tail. The crest was
showing like a little top-knot on the head. The general colour
of the wing feathers was black clouded with brown and speckled
and vermiculated with white; the white, by the way, being more
abundant in one specimen than in the other. The latter will
probably prove to be the cock bird. The back and the head,
apart from the incipient crest, still retained the down. Along the
\0x25A0spine extended a rather broad black-edged brown stripe set off
on each side by a dirty white stripe, which was itself bordered
externally by a much thinner blackish brown stripe.
At the time of writing (October 20th) the chicks, although
over ten weeks old and of considerable size, still take food from
their mother's beak, but they peck of their own accord as well.
The larger of the two is as big as a Pheasant, and resembles
almost exactly the hen of the Globose Curassow, except that the
feathers of the well-developed crest are black, with a small
white spot at the bottom of each. The other, which is a much
\0x25A0smaller and altogether more backward bird, takes after its mother
11 colour but has a good deal less white about the head, neck,
and wings, and practically none on the interscapular area of the
back. This bird appears to be delicate and mopish and less
likely to thrive than its twin.

the first day after hatching.

intervals during the day. After this they spend the nights
perched by her side on a branch well above the ground,
reaching their position by climbing.
9 They feed at first upon insect food, and afterwards take to
the diet of their parents.
10 For several weeks they do not peck food from the ground but
take it from their mother's beak. At ten weeks old they
feed themselves and are also fed by her.
One or two circumstances mentioned in the above
given account give me the excuse to introduce a subject
connected with bird-breeding which is, I think, of the greatest
scientific interest. The Curassows in question furnished an
admirable illustration of a phenomenon, familiar no doubt to
most aviculturists, but one which is none the less remarkable for
all that. I refer to the wonderful extent to which the repro-
ductive activities of birds appear to be influenced, both in the
way of suppression and stimulation by what seem to us to be
trivial factors in their environment, factors indeed which the
inexperienced would declare to be quite inadequate to produce
the results that apparently follow from them. For instance, the
pair of Curassows bred in 1906 and in 1908 when a suitable site
and nesting materials with which to build were at hand. In
1907 they evinced no sign of even wishing to breed when these
desiderata were not available. Again when the first two eggs of
1908 were smashed, the loss was made good in a few days ; and
no one will suppose that the second lot would have been pro-
duced but for the accident which robbed the birds of the first
clutch. This suggests that incubation acts upon the organisation
of the hen in some way adverse to the development of eggs, and

conversely that the cessation of incubation and of family cares
act as a stimulus to the organs concerned in egg-formation, pro-
vided that the time of the year be favourable. Similarly the breeding
of the birds in 1906 and 1908 and their sterility in 1907, under
the conditions mentioned above, show that what is true, if true it
be, of incubation, is no less true of nidification. The two indeed
apparently influence the hen in a manner analogous to that pro-
duced upon some female mammalia by lactation. But the intimate
physiological connection between lactation and reproduction
in mammalia brings this phenomenon within the scope of our
comprehension. Nidification and incubation on the contrary are
merely manifestations of particular instincts; they are occupa-
tions followed in obedience to certain innate promptings and, as
such, fall into the category of psychical not of physiological
phenomena. Yet if the supposition be correct that the repro-
ductive activities are affected by these occupations, the fact con-
stitutes a problem in physiology which, so far as I know, cannot
be quite matched in the mammalia, although an approach to it is
seen in the internal effects produced by the emotion of fear or in
the stimulus to salivation supplied by the sight of appetising
food.
I have merely cited nidification and incubation as possible
causes in determining the maturation of eggs, because the
Curassows furnished the data. I do not doubt that other factors,
apart of course from food and bodily health, produce the same
apparent results, The question, however, is clearly one for in-
vestigation ; and perhaps some of my avicultural colleagues may
be induced to record their experiences and opinions on the sub-
ject so that the suggestions above put forward may be finally
refuted or confirmed. That the question at issue is worth dis-
cussion must be admitted ; and I have ventured to draw attention
to it in the pages of our magazine largely because it brings us
face to face with physiological possibilities of importance outside
aviculture and ornithology, and shows that the cult of birds may
have a value beyond the gratification of the tastes and interests of
those who practise it, beyond even the new facts in natural
history it is constantly revealing.

When I, for the second time, peeped into the log, just a
month later (July 23), I found that the nest had been covered over ,
only a little slit at the extreme back of the roof having been left
open, barely large enough, not large enough one might have
supposed, to allow of the passage of the birds to and fro. Four
eggs were laid, presumably on June 20, 22, 24, 26; thus the
complete roofing in of the nest, and the blocking up of the
side aperture, would appear to have synchronized with the laying
of the fourth egg. On and from the 20th, the female had been
sitting so far as her house-building labours had allowed her to,
but, on the 26th, was not seen at all--she had commenced to sit
in earnest: we now see why she was so anxious to have her work
finished off by the 26th.
How was the roof supported ? The roof was just below the
level of the top of the log--nothing at that time had been placed
across the top: all the support was from below. Doubtless,
upright sticks, like those already mentioned, acted like pillars
and kept it from falling in. But the work must have been per-
formed with quite remarkable cleverness for, up to the very last,
it was perfectly intact, and never once betrayed the slightest sign
of weakness.
The female pretty frequently carried in additional material,
but it was used in keeping the aperture small; for the climbing
of the birds, especially of the nestlings, up and down, tended to
enlarge the aperture ; and the duty of keeping this hole as small
as possible, unquestionably for the purpose of hiding the treasures
within, was faithfully attended to so long as a single nestling
remained to be concealed-- and after ! ! I When I last saw the
nest, the aperture was barely large enough to allow of the
entrance of a mouse ; the thickness of the roof, too, had been
increased--for Mine. Nigrigenis had ulterior motives. There
were one or two "pillars" near the entrance hole; and one day
I found a sparsedly feathered nestling on the roof, who, boy-like,

Mr. R. Phillipps,
had climbed up one of the pillars and got out. Some time later,
when taking a peep, one youngster, probably the same precocious
urchin, three times climbed up this perpendicular stick, hand
over hand as it were, and climbed down again in like manner on
finding my face so near. Another point that struck me was the
large amount of space the nestlings seem to have inside the nest,
shewing that the supports must have been few in number--but
how firmly they must have been fixed !
The Rosy-faced Lovebird used to sit well on her eggs.
The Red-faced Lovebird sat like a stone: I never saw such
a creature. I remember well my first experience. The female
had entirely disappeared ; and I, supposing that she must be
dead, instituted a thorough search for the body. On reaching
into a sloping log which was hidden away and difficult of access
--and I must have made much noise and shaken the place well--
I found a chilly little morsel of feathers inside (the log was too
large and the nest of little account), with wings partially out-
stretched over the eggs. I pulled her out, and she lay on the
palm of my open hand, with wings apparently rigidly outspread,
like a prepared specimen. I thought she was paralysed and
helpless--when suddenly she took wing and flew rapidly away.
But the Black-cheeked Lovebird is a very shy sitter ; she
seems to be unceasingly expectant of the advent of some deadly
forest foe; and this fear is seen reflected in the care with which
she endeavours to conceal her eggs and young. In early days,
when I crept into the birdroom, I used to notice that invariably
she would be sitting in and filling up the side aperture. After
this aperture had been closed, she was always to be found
crouching on the top of the log, ready to dart off at a moment's
notice ; and even now as I write, in respect of her second nest,
although she has learnt to have full confidence in me and never
flies, the old instinct prevails, and she is invariably to be found
on the top of the log when I enter the room. I have had cases
in which the female, not satisfied with the nest, has in a like
manner kept watch over the safety of her eggs but never at-
tempted to incubate them ; and I feared that this might be
another such a case ; but one day I did succeed in getting within
sight of the log so quietly that I was in time to see her appearing

at the top, coming up from the inside, shewing that she had been
on the nest until the moment that she became aware of my
presence: certainly she is a very watchful bird. She is quite
silent during the nesting period, never uttering a sound. The
other female, too, who is sitting in the garden, flies quietly and
rapidly away if her nest be approached.
The male did not assist in the work of incubation. He
did not, at that period, give me the impression of being a par-
ticularly devoted lover; indeed, he looked exceedingly bored,
and spent most of his time in the garden, but always sleeping in
the birdroom. I do not know that he fed the female while she
was sitting, perhaps not ; but he fed her assiduously after the
young were hatched.
During her first "sitting," whenever the female went into
the garden, she almost always carried a strip of wood or piece of
broom back with her to the nest; but in many little ways she is
now behaving differently. Perhaps she regards the nest as in-
capable of improvement--and she never seems to leave it!
It was on or about July 15 that I noticed a change in the
state of affairs, the apathetic male waking up and becoming
more active, and occasionally visiting the birdroom ; on the 23rd,
the female commenced to come into the garden, and was fed
there. From the 29th, she passed a good deal of time daily out-
side, away from the nest; but it was not until the 30th that I saw
her take food herself.
It was 011 July 23 that I first saw a young bird in the nest.
One could only see a portion of the inside, but a nestling a few
days old was visible. O11 the 26th, I saw two nearly naked little
things squatting side by side, like a couple of young pigeons.
On the 29th, Mr. Seth-Smith inspected the nest, and reported
four young of different ages, all right. On August 4 I first
noticed a touch of colour, one sturdy youngster having a pale
yellow-red beak. O11 the 12th, the crowns of the nestlings had
all the appearance of being fully feathered.
By this time, the young birds had become as it were " con-
scious" ; and, when I peeped in, I would find the whole lot with
their heads and necks extended and stretched straight out along
the bottom of the nest, after the manner of Thicknees. From

Mr. R. Phiujpps,
what natural enemy did instinct teach them to conceal them-
selves? The females sit on their eggs in fear and trembling, and
are ever ready to take refuge in flight. The nestlings, unable to
fly, try to save their skins by squatting flat and remaining im-
movable. Is their hereditary foe to be looked for in the snake or
in the monkey tribe ? Perhaps the latter. And here I can pic-
ture to myself some shallow pated clever-one asking the question,
quite innocently of course, " To what species of monkey did they
recognise a resemblance in Mr. Phillipps?" Imbecile , how could
it be but to Colobiis caudatus, for is not this species universally
acknowledged to be the most handsome of all the handsome
monkeys!
On August 13 the two elder, after playing 'possum for a
moment, stood boldty up, raising their heads towards the open-
ing. Along their backs and down their necks there were the
usual tracks of feathers, but they were far from being fully
covered ; their tails, less than an inch being visible, shewed the
subterminal band of black quite well marked, especially in the
eldest where the markings were of a deeper black and much
more clearly defined. The forehead shewed the colour of the
adult, or seemed to ; and the salmon-red patch on the chest was
conspicuous. The nostrils were quite covered and hidden; I
could not manage to get a glint of light on to an eye--in the
shade of the log, the irides seemed to be quite black.
So far as I was able to observe, the young in the nest were
practically mute: I never heard them either call for food or
audibly respond to its arrival. Once or twice I fancied I heard a
sort of whimpering when I took hold of the log--and that is all-
I took care, of course, only to approach the nest during
the absence of the parents.
The first young bird to leave the nest, probably the pre-
cocious youth already referred to, appeared 011 August 22 ; but,
for a few days at any rate, he returned to the nest after a short
outing. For some time, the fledgelings regarded the log as a
haven of refuge; their first thunder-storm, for instance, sent
them cowering back to the log with great precipitancy. No.
2, I think a female, appeared on the 25th. The green of the
general plumage of these two birds was at first very dull, but

rapidly became brighter, and the flanks yellower; the breast-
patch at first was very bright ; the brown of the forehead ex-
tended farther back in "A" than in " B," and then there came
some green or greenish. The black on the sides of the chin
seemed to be as deep as in the parents, but only a little colouring
extended upwards behind the eyes. The head of B seemed to be
broader than that of A, and, although the younger, " she " seemed
to be the larger bird. But all the differences of shading quickly
assumed a dull level--the young and the old, as seen in the
garden, became very much alike. Even the yellow in the red of
the beaks of the fledgelings seems to have gone. No. 3 had
joined the group on the 27th, as usual in the quiet of the early
morning; and the fourth and last came out on the following day,
carefully tended by one of its parents. I think the latter must
have been " hurried" out of the log, for it was less forward than
the others, and was fed by the male for some days after the others
were feeding themselves. They quickly took to nibbling at green
food, but on and from the 30th the three were feeding on dry
seed, &amp;c., with their father.
The four young birds are fond of climbing and gambolling
about, and, with their father, form a pretty group. They are
now, young and old, quite amicably inclined towards the other
birds, though often sparring among themselves.
And where is mother? Once more she is on her nest,
having laid the first egg of a second clutch probably on August
30. She is sitting very steadily, never leaving the birdroom, and
has at length come to have such confidence in my integrity that,
after climbing up and inspecting me, she will return to her eggs
without waiting for me to leave the room.
On September 5, noticing from the movements of the odd
female that she had nothing of value in her nest, I got a step-
ladder and made a hurried examination. On a sheltered sloping
shelf, divided into sections, there were three large " mounds" of
various nesting materials, amongst which millet stalks and sticks
from the birch brooms were noticeable. I had marked the one
from which she had fled, and did not stop to examine the others.
As usual, she had slipped quietly from the nest and had dis-
appeared in the recesses of the "forest" (birdroom). I11 the far

distance I heard a wailing cry, reminding me of that of the
Hobby, under similar circumstances, when there are only eggs
or very young nestlings in the nest: but she was disturbing the
other sitting female, so I could not linger. The nest proper was
low down, in a corner, at the very back of the sheltering heap of
stuff, and contained one egg, a glance at which betrayed its con-
dition. It is rather slender in shape, with prolonged ends, the
smaller end being almost pointed, and just a trifle smaller and
slimmer in character than are those in my collection of the Red-
faced Lovebird. This female has not returned to her nest--yet ;
but she and the male are always together, and are now quite
friendly.
September iS :--This female has not returned to her nest,
a nest that has been profaned by the hand of man. She is
sitting as far away from the spot as possible, in a small travelling
cage stuck up in a high corner of the garden aviary. The young
birds seem as if they would come to ^a-sf-maturity at an early
age; one has been singing regularly for some days.

GOOILUST, HOLLAND.
By F. E. Blaauw, C.M.Z.S., M.B.O.U.
Amongst the birds that have been bred at Gooilust this
season the following are, perhaps, worthy of being noticed.
My Wattled Plovers {Sarciophorns pectoralis&amp;apos;), which reared
a pair of young ones last year, have again laid this season and
reared a couple of young ones. The number of eggs was again
two, so that I suppose this is the usual number.
A pair of Emerald Doves (Chalcopelia chnlcospilos ) which
nested successfully the year before, have again reared a pair of
young ones, which have moulted and are in full plumage now.
Needless to say that the metallic spots on the wings of all the
young ones are green, just as they are in the parents. The old
birds are very prolific and have a pair of babies for the third time
at the present moment. The chicks, when still on the nest, feel

a cold wet day very much, and often die if the sun is obscured
too long.
The pretty Turtur humilis is the most prolific and most
successful breeder of all the exotic doves I know ; all the summer
the broods succeed, one upon the other, and the young ones are
nearly always reared.
A pair of Sonnerat's Jungle Fowl was very successful in
its breeding operations, and I succeeded in rearing ten chicks,
which proved to be five cocks and five hens. The hen laid three
times, each clutch consisting of four eggs. The first two clutches
I took away and put under bantam hens, whilst I left her the
third clutch on which she sat herself, hatching four chicks. One
of these died and the other three are now nearly half grown.
The two first clutches produced seven chicks which are
now almost full grown. The chicks are beautifully marked with
rich chestnut markings on orange yellow and are reared on ants r
eggs. The cocks of these two earliest broods are now assuming
their full dress plumage. The waxy yellow spots of the back are
the first to appear, and are almost complete now ; in the oldest
birds the ornamental neck feathers and those of the tail are now
only just beginning to sprout.
The old cock when moulting after the breeding season is
over, does not get his yellow-spotted neck feathers in the first
instance, but assumes a sort of eclipse plumage, the new neck
feathers being short and plain grey.
At the present moment (Sept. 8th) the cock is assuming
his breeding or nuptial dress, and all his ornaments are growing
again.
Incubation lasts 18-19 days.
Amongst the Waterfowl that bred here I may mention the
breeding of a pair of Golden Eyes (Clangula glaucion , Linn).
The birds had been on my pond six or seven years, but in May
last the female laid for the first time. She laid three beautiful
green eggs in two boxes placed on poles in the water, but did not
sit herself, so that the eggs had to be hatched by a domestic hen.
The three eggs hatched, but one chick died the first day, the two
others growing into a fine pair of young birds which are now full

grown. I believe this is the first instance of Golden Eyes having
bred in captivity.
The White-eyed Ducks (Nyroca ferruginea) were not so
successful this year as usual, many eggs being clear.
Amongst the geese I may mention three fine Orinoco
Geese (Chenalopex jubata&amp;apos;) which have been reared under a
domestic hen, and are the offspring of a pair which were born
here some eight years ago.
Tittle Orinoco chicks are beautifully marked with black
stripes and spots on a yellowish ground, with rich brown shading
between the two colours.
Ashy-headed (Bernicla poliocephala&amp;apos;) and Ruddy-headed
Geese ( B. rubidiceps) raised a couple of broods.
The female of a pair of Lesser White-fronted Geese laid
one single egg, shaped much like a German sausage, and sat on
it until it burst. Needless to say that nothing could possibly
have come of it.
My Sandwich Island Geese bred so very early this year
that most of the eggs were spoiled by the frost, so that only two
chicks hatched on a bitterly cold day. One of them died, but
the other one lived and is now quite full grown. It has even
moulted into the adult plumage. I have now four pairs of these
rare geese.
Tike last year and the year before my pair of White-necked
Cranes bred two chicks, but this year I was not so successful as
usual in rearing them. One died when quite small on a cold day,
and the second one, when about two feet high, stuck fast in the
mud of the pond, broke both its wings struggling to get out, and
died a couple of days later.
The White Indian and Australian Cranes both laid, but
the eggs did not hatch.

A short time back I received from Mr. H. D. Astlejr a letter
asking me if I could find out for him the name of a dove he had
lately received along with a pair of Blue-headed Pigeons ; as
these latter come from Cuba the probability was that the unknown
dove also came from there. A drawing of the head showed that
the bird belonged to the genus Geotrygoji , and as only two or
three species inhabit Cuba I soon found out that it was the
species known as chrysia.
About a fortnight later a small parcel arrived, containing
the somewhat mangled remains of the bird. I was able to have
a skin made of it, so that I could take it to the Museum to be
sure that it was identified correctly. It is a very rare bird, only
three skins are at South Kensington, and what was interesting to
find out was that one of them had formerly lived in the Zoo-
logical Gardens, so that this is probably the second time this
beautiful bird has been imported alive. No mention of " chrysia"
will be found in the " List of Animals," so that the specimen at
the Gardens probably was entered under the name montana , by
which this species has often been called.
It is rather a small bird, not being much larger than the
well known Red Ground Dove ( G. montana), in fact Mr. Astley's
Bird is actually smaller than a specimen I have of montana, but
one of the skins in the Museum was a good deal larger and
brighter coloured. In colour the wings are light chestnut, the
head and neck are glossed with metallic green and violet re-
flections, whilst the mantle is adorned with the most brilliant
metallic purple ; a whitish band passes under each eye, the chin
and throat are also whitish, the breast is vinous.
It is a pity that this group of Ground Doves is not more
freely imported, as nothing can exceed the brilliant metallic hues
of many of the species. Mr. Astley's bird was sexed as a female.
In life its bill had a curious downward curve, but this is not
borne out by the Museum birds, so was probably the result of an
accident. It is also known from Haiti, the Bahamas and Florida
Keys. T. H. Newman.

PIGEON.
Geophaps script a.
By T. H. Newman, F.Z.S., M.B.O.U.
(i Concluded from page 343, Vol. VI).
To return to the history of the second young one. July
13th was very wet, the young bird was sitting under the shelter,
it spends most of its time there if the weather is not fine, but
seems to prefer sitting ou the grass among the shrubs when fine.
It ran into the flight when I went into the aviary, some time
later I heard it chirping among some ivy, soon it came into sight,
and one of its parents ran to it and seemed to talk to it for a
minute or two, in the way these Pigeons do, and as the young
one wanted to be fed, uttered a low note (all Pigeons seem to
have a special note when about to feed their young) which was
heard by the elder young one which was some distance
off; it ran up and the parent fed both at once., The young
do not flap their wings much when being fed, though they
are sometimes quivered a little. The old bird then left the
young ones, which remained sitting facing one another ; the
elder bird pecked a grain or two of seed, which remained
sticking to the bill of the 3&amp;apos;ounger. The second bird was now
seventeen days old and about the size of a small Quail, the
white markings 011 the face were getting quite conspicuous and
the white stripes on the side of the breast were beginning to
show. The young bird at this stage chirps very like a young
game bird, a sort of soft twitter, though it can be heard some
distance off; the chirping note is replaced by a more pigeon-like
squeak when being actually fed. If the young wander about
much one wonders how the parents find them when in the wild
state, they are certainly very active and the old birds do not keep
by the young. A pair of young which have lately left the nest
seem to keep constantly together, though they move from place
to place, and their parents seem to keep a watchful eye on them.
July 14th. The young one was very active stretching and
flapping its wings ; it was pecking about ou a sanded path a good
deal. Its tail was short, just reaching beyond tip of wings, very

unfledged and bare under its wings and on sides of body, and a
bare space without feathers on each side of upper surface of head.
It does not seem able to fly yet ; when jumping down about
two feet it only seemed just able to break its fall, though the
quills are well developed. The green speculum of the adult is
represented by blackish feathers only washed with green.
July 16th. Young one growing fast: tail beginning to
lengthen and showing beyond the wings.
July 20th. Twenty-four days old, beginning to fly, saw it
flutter about four feet up wire netting ; it is getting wilder, still
very bare under wings and on sides of top of head, both egg
teeth still in position.
July 21st. Young one walks about more like its parents
when frightened squats down beside a clump of grass, etc., but
runs away as soon as it thinks itself unobserved. One of the old
birds offered to feed it, but it did not seem hungry ; the elder
young bird came running up and was fed, though it was now two
mouths old and nearly as big as its parents.
July 24th. Second young one is four weeks old and has
got the proportions of the adult bird, as its wings and tail have
grown. The white marks on the face are as conspicuous as in
the adult; it is about half the size of its parents. The feathers
are coming on the sides of the head and are nearly ready to burst
their sheaths ; white line behind eye now very plain ; chin, throat
and space a little below eyes and ears still almost bare of feathers,
both egg teeth in place but becoming very worn and small \
sides of body and under surface of wings very bare, but feathers
coming. When frightened it flies strongly for several yards.
July 28th. Very vigorous and able to fly well; feathers on
side of head very nearly full grown, a black row of feathers has
appeared over each eye, more white feathers on throat, but chin
and sides of lower mandible quite bare, bare skin greyish flesh
colour ; egg tooth from upper mandible gone, lower one still in
place, but seems now almost to project from end of mandible, so
near to tip is it; underneath wings still showing bare skin but
many feathers nearly full grown.
July 29th. The young resembles its parents in shape and
proportion, but is fully a third smaller, the tail also appears

longer in proportion ; chin and throat still very bare, the bare
skin extends in a line down centre of throat and branches off on
each side, in a line extending to a point under each ear ; this
bare space is edged with white and is all white in the adult. The
primaries are already being renewed, the tenth (innermost) is
nearly an inch long and the ninth has just been dropped ; lower
egg tooth still retained.
August 5th. Young one growing very plump, central
portion of under surface of wing still bare ; chin and base of bill
to eye quite bare of feathers, bare skin dark purplish grey,
eighth primary (new feather) showing plainly but not yet burst
its sheath, the first primary in each wing (first feather) is still
growing, tail feathers seem to be full grown, feathers on top of
head are now quite long and practically full grown ; skin round
the eye getting white, just a speck of lower egg tooth left, the
rest seems to have been worn away.
August nth. Young one now between six and seven
weeks old, growing, though still very far from being full grown,
chin more covered with young white feathers in sheath ; sides of
lower mandible and space between bill and eye still quite bare
without any trace of feathers. A general moult is now in pro-
gress, numerous new feathers, especially 011 the breast are com-
ing up between the first feathers, some being half grown, tenth
(new) primary full grown, ninth about half grown, last trace of
egg tooth has disappeared, the central tail feathers, basal half of
the others and upper tail coverts are freckled with light brown.
In the adult these parts are solid brown, the first plumage is very
similar to the adult, the chief difference being that all the brown
feathers of the upper surface are indistinctly vermiculated with
light brown, the edges are paler as in the full grown bird, which
has these feathers solid brown with lighter tips, the breast of the
young bird is not so grey, and the speculum on the wing is a
mixture of brown and black, the black portion being tinged with
green but not like the bright metallic glossy green of the adult.
This brings my notes on the second young bird to an end, so I
will now go back to the first young one hatched on May 23rd.
O11 the 7th of July it was between six and seven weeks old,
just at the age at which we left No. 2. It was very like its

parents but slimmer, so that the tail seemed longer in proportion,
it rather reminded me of a pea-chick.
On July 24th, nearly nine weeks old, it was perched on a
thick triangular perch about a couple of feet off the ground with
the old cock bird ; it seemed in a playful mood, it jumped from
one side to the other several times, after each jump it drew itself
up stiffly, all the time the feathers on the crown were erected so
as to form quite a crest. Presently it flew to the ground and up
again, standing in front of its parent with feathers of crest and
back rather raised, it lowered and raised itself several times in
quick succession ; it did this two or three times, the old cock
cooed to it with the usual three notes. I have never seen the
old birds indulge in these antics, they may be the actions of the
female when courting. Hen doves and pigeons often show off to
the cock bird when mating in a way seldom seen at other times,
from this I take this elder bird to be a hen. It was still being
fed as I saw five days later; it was now only very little smaller
than its parents, but still slimmer looking. In colour it is
almost the same, just a shade greyer in tone, the crest seems
distinctly longer than in the adult. Does this show that the
ancestors of Geophaps were crested like the closely allied Plume-
doves ( Lophophaps ) ?
August 1st. Ten weeks old, it was now practically as
large as its parents, the skin round the eye had turned bluish
white as in the adults, four primaries had nearly been renewed,
and about six of the green speculum feathers had been grown,,
beginning at the end nearest the body, the two central tail
feathers had been moulted and were just starting to grow again,,
many of the small body and wing feathers had been renewed.
August 5th. The eldest young bird has filled out and now
seems as plump as its parents.
August nth. Between eleven and twelve weeks old it has
now moulted most of its small body feathers, a few of the first
feathers remain about the middle of the scapulars and are dis-
tinguished by their mottled ends and faded lighter tips, the sixth
primary is growing, seventh to tenth have been renewed, second-
aries just beginning to be moulted, central tail feathers about two
thirds grown, the next pair have been shed, the green speculum

is now complete, the feathers round base of bill are fully de-
veloped. The colours of the soft parts are : iris , dark brown ; skin
round eye bluish white, slightly tinged with green behind and
*carmine in front of eye ; bill, dark brown, dusted with greyish at
base and on cere; feet, scales purplish grey, soles, back of tarsus
and joints of scales ashy ; claws, dark brown. Its actions remind
me very much of a pea-hen when walking slowly, on turning,
the tail is often bent to one side, just as I have seen pea fowls do,
.and when running the head is held very high, the neck being
stretched out to its full length, while the wings are drooped and
\0x25A0the tail is slightly raised, being kept tightly folded.
On the 12th and 14th July two eggs were laid in different
parts of the aviary, the birds made no attempt to sit. O11 the
15th I put the eggs under some other doves: on the 20th one
was cracked and the other deserted. I put the sound egg under
-another pair; it hatched 011 August 1st. Incubation again seven-
teen days, counting from July 15th when the egg was set. This
young one was never properly fed, as I had not got any birds
which were due to hatch about this date, and on August 4th I
found it on the ground, dead some hours. It is this bird that I
sent to the Museum. On July 21st and 23rd the hen again laid
in her old nest, and on August 8th two young were hatched,
being the sixteenth day of incubation.
I am afraid the above notes read like a collection of
statistics, but I thought it best to put them down in full, so that
there can be no excuse in the future for not knowing what the
3 7 oung of Geophaps are like. I have no reason to doubt that the
young birds were quite normal in every way, they seemed per-
fectly strong and healthy from the very first, and the conditions
under which the birds are kept, in a large aviary, with grass,
-growing shrubs, with stones and thick branches to perch on, are
sufficiently like their natural habitat not to materially interfere
with the habits of the species. We have traced the young from
the egg until it is virtually full grown.
I11 summing up I do not think that anything has been
noticed to merit this group being separated from the more typical
Pigeons. The mode of incubation thoroughly accords with that

resemble other pigeons ; true they leave the nest and run actively
at an early age, but this is to be expected in the young of such a
terrestrial species. It would be very unsafe for the young to
remain helpless on the ground for a lengthy period. Though
the young leave the nest so small they take a long time, over two
months, to attain full growth. The unexpected points were the
discovery of a second egg tooth, which is retained apparently till
it becomes worn away, and the fact that the young begin to
inoult before the first plumage is complete, so that by the time
the bird has reached its full size it has also attained its adult
plumage. I have not heard of any young ones being hatched in
this country since those whose fate we were reminded of last
year. In P.Z.S., 1892, p. 77, we read that one of the young
"about fourteen days old . . . was actually killed by falling
from a slight elevation." This would be about the time the
young bird would naturally wish to leave its nest, but from the
description of the young I do not think they were so strong as
mine, doubtless owing to their having been hatched under Bar-
bary Doves. Young were reared in Melbourne Zoo in 1904.

O11 January 22nd I had the pleasure of meeting our member
Mr. C. B. Horsbrugh at Perth, who was on his way to New
Guinea in quest of living Birds of Paradise. Much to my regret
he had been unable to book his passage in time to travel out to
Australia with me, and had followed by the next mail-steamer.
We went round the Perth Zoo together in company with Mr.
L. Le Souef, and in the afternoon went to Fremantle where Mr.
Horsbrugh rejoined his ship and Mr. Le Souef and I sought out
Mr. Wallace's collection of birds, etc., which he had been getting
together to take home. After some trouble we discovered him
in a small house in a back street. Two rooms of the house were
occupied with numerous large cages containing a wonderful col-
lection of Parrakeets and Finches, Kingfishers, Honeyeaters and
Doves ; in the back premises were Wallabies and Lizards, while

the back garden was used as a run for Emus. I am glad to hear
that Mr. Wallace had good luck in bringing this interesting
collection home.
.The following day Mr. E. A. Le Souef and I started for the
forest country of the Margaret River district, celebrated for its
wonderful limestone caves, where we expected to be rewarded
by the sight of many interesting birds.
We left Perth early in the morning and travelled due south
to Busselton, a small seaside town, about one hundred and fifty
miles from our starting point, the journey occupying the greater
part of the day. I was ever on the look out for birds as we
journeyed along. We passed through many miles of country
where every tree in sight was leafless and dead, a truly dreary
sight, but one dear to the eyes of the settlers, for it means that
the forest trees have all been ring-barked and thus killed for the
purpose of converting the forest into rich pasture land.
A small party of seven or eight Budgerigars (Melopsittacus
undulatus ) flew along parallel with the train for a short distance,
giving me the only view I ever had of this familiar little Parrakeet
in an absolutely wild state. As we approached the end of our
train journey, many birds were seen from the carriage windows.
Bee-eaters (Merops ornatus) were sitting on the telegraph wires
and hawking for insects, the railway embankments being favourite
nesting sites of theirs. Honey-eaters, Friar-birds, Wood-Swallows
and " Magpies " were seen, the latter being quite numerous.
We reached Busselton about six o'clock in the evening,
but still had a drive of some thirty-five miles before us. We
decided that it would be best to get this over the same evening
as the time at our disposal was limited. My companion had
given instructions for a telegram to be sent ordering a carriage
to be ready for our drive, but this had either been forgotten or
had miscarried, and we had considerable difficulty in finding a
conveyance of any kind. However, the local chemist had a
buggy and two good horses, but these had already had one long
journey that day and were not fresh enough for another run of
thirty-five miles, but we were told that by going a longer way
round we could change horses at Yallingap, where one of the
caves is situated, and there is a Government accommodation house.

This route added ten miles further to our journey, but it was a
beautiful evening, and we knew that a few hours later the moon,
which was almost full, would be up, so we looked forward with
considerable pleasure to a long midnight drive. After an excel-
lent dinner at the well-equipped hotel I joined some of the^hotel
visitors in a turn at " diabolo," until our buggy arrived.
We left Busseltou about eight o'clock, our two steeds pull-
ing us along at a good pace in spite of their having already had a
twenty mile run the same day ; but it is extraordinary what these
Australian horses will do. The grass on all sides appeared to me
to be absolutely burnt up, hardly a green blade being anywhere
visible, yet its quality is such that sheep fatten wondrously upon
it, and horses, fed on nothing else, look sleek and fit, and will
accomplish journeys which very few English horses, though fed
on the best of corn, could approach.
We had not gone far before I noticed a large owl-like bird
hawking about in the gloaming, which, on our approach, flew on
to the top of a telegraph pole and there remained motionless,
neither did it move when we drove right past it, and I perceived
that it was a Frogmouth ( Podargus ), one of the most interesting
of Australian birds. Our driver, with the characteristic instinct
of the colonial, remarked that it was a pity we had not a gun with
us ! We had a small rifle in our baggage, but we did not tell him
so, and the bird, which I admit I wished I had been able to
capture alive, was left in peace. From the pasture land which
stretched away on either side of the road we heard the wee-loo
zvee-loo of the so-called Peewit, the Australian Stone Curlew or
Thick-knee Plover f. Burhinus grallarius), and the zno-poke of the
Boobook Owl was heard in the distance.
We reached the half-way house of our drive about 11.30
p.m. where we waited about twenty minutes to change horses.
Mr. Le Souef and I left the buggy and strolled into the precincts
of the accommodation house, where the barking of a dog roused
the attendant from his bed on the verandah. There was, of
course, no time to see the cave, neither could the attendant be
expected to show it to us at that time of night, though he told 11s
something of its wonders. I questioned him as to whether he
ever saw Black Cockatoos in the neighbourhood, and he assured

Mr. D. Seth-SmiTh,
me that hardly a day passed without one or more flocks passing
overhead ; only that afternoon he had seen a large flock.
We resumed our journey about midnight, the moon having
just risen, without which we could hardly have proceeded, as the
road here became a mere track through the forest of huge
eucalyptus trees.
There were numbers of Opossums in this forest but, al-
though the moon shone brilliantly, it was extraordinarily difficult
to see them, and I doubt if I should have seen any had not my
companion, whose eyes were as sharp as a bushman's, pointed
them out to me. A small excrescence would appear on the side
of a tree trunk, and this would very rapidly ascend until it
reached the branches where it would generally disappear alto-
gether, hiding behind some limb. Mr. Le Souef was very anxious
to try a shot at one with a small rifle he had brought with him,
but however easy it may be to pot these little creatures with a
shot gun, to shoot them with a rifle at night, when it is impossible
to see the sights of one's weapon is a totally different matter.
The shot had no effect so far as the bullet was concerned, but the
report was answered by loud cries of gnoolark gnoolark as a party
of Black Cockatoos (CalyptorhyucJnis baudiui ), disturbed from
their rest in the tree tops, took flight.
For mile after mile we continued through the forest, and
reached our destination at 3 a.m., our arrival being heralded by
the loud barking of dogs which awakened a trusty old servant
known as " Dutcliy," who turned out and conducted us to the
house where, late as the hour was, our kind hostess welcomed
us and provided us with comfortable quarters.
The next morning we were out fairly early for a long walk
in the forest. A family party of small grey Fantails {Rhipidura
preissi) were busy capturing flies around some stables, taking no
notice of our presence; most graceful little birds are these, con-
tinually drooping their wings and their tails outspread swaying
from side to side. The party consisted of the two old birds and
three young ones, the latter being constantly fed with flies by
their parents.
Western Australia must be almost unsurpassed for the
beauty of its wild flowers at the right season, that is in the winter

and early spring. In the hot dry summer vegetation is practically
dormant. At the time of my visit I was able to form some slight
idea, by the number of withered seed pods, of what the flowers had
been. As it was, the blue Lobelia was growing everywhere and
the ground in places was carpeted with maiden-hair fern. A fox-
terrier which accompanied us started a monitor Lizard, locally
known as a "guano," which hurriedly scampered up the trunk of
a large eucalyptus, carefully keeping on the opposite side of the
tree to where we were. These lizards grow to a very large size,
some measuring as much as six feet in length.
A bird which interested me considerably, and which was
common in the forest country was the Leaden Crow-Shrike
{Strepera plwnbea), known in the district as the " Squeaker," a
name which suits it well. It is about the size of a Piping Crow,
of a dull black colour, the tail-feathers being broadly tipped with
white. It is shy and very noisy and disliked by the settlers on
account of its partiality for fruit. However I am told that, if
taken from the nest and hand-reared, Squeakers make most
delightful and intelligent pets.
During the heat of the day practically no birds were to be
seen or heard, but in the afternoon a great change took place, and
bird life was much in evidence. We heard the uumistakeable
and frequently repeated cry of the Black Cockatoo, at first in the
far distance and then nearer, until a party of more than twenty of
these magnificent birds passed within a hundred yards of us,
their white ear-patches showing very conspicuously. They
passed on over the tops of the trees and settled on the leafless
branches of some huge forest giants which had undergone the
process of ring-barking. We soon heard others approaching and,
within a very short space of time, three or four parties of
Calyptorhyncluis baud ini had passed us. They are very noisy
birds ; their cry, which sounds like " gnoolark," being constantly
uttered as they fly, and also when settled, if danger is suspected.
These birds are very rarely kept in captivity in Australia, and
most of the settlers go so far as to assert that they cannot be kept,
a statement which however is by no means correct. Nevertheless
there is undoubtedly a great difficulty in getting newly-caught
birds, or young birds taken from the nest, to feed ; and this fact

On his Visit io Australia.
made me very anxious to ascertain exactly as to what constituted
the chief food of these birds in a wild state. I therefore shot a
specimen the following day and opened its crop, which contained
one mass of large whitish grubs, and nothing besides. These
grubs live under the bark of dead or dying Eucalyptus trees,
those that have been killed by ring-barking showing, as a rule,
clear evidence of the work of the Black Cockatoos, the bark being
torn off in strips.
The very handsome Yellow-collared or "Twenty-eight"
Parrakeet (Barnardius semitorquat 7 is&amp;apos;) was constantly i 11 evidence,
and at times the call-note, sounding like " twenty-eight " was
frequently uttered. Most of those I saw were in pairs, and on
two occasions I saw the cocks showing off to, by slightly droop-
ing the wings and spreading the tail, and feeding their mates.
As we walked across some swampy ground, thickly covered
with wattle-scrub, through which the tracks of Wallabies ran in
every direction, we flushed a pair of Brush Bronze-wing Pigeons
(Phaps elega?is) from almost under our feet; they flew with low
rapid flight and were soon lost to sight in the forest beyond.
A large grey Friar Bird or Leather-head was next seen,
perched on a leafless bough, but it did not allow of very close
approach.
A family party of White-browed Wood-Swallows ( Artanms
superciliosus) interested me very much. The country where we
found them was fairly open, the ground covered with low scrub,
and here and there medium-sized trees. The old birds were
constantly taking short flights after insects with which they re-
turned to the branches of one of these trees and fed the chicks.
The flight of these birds is very graceful and pretty.

NIGHTJARS BREEDING IN CAPTIVITY.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99911103125" page_id="32659617"  page_num="51" year="" vol="">
The Field , of October 17th, publishes an interesting
account of the breeding in captivity of a pair of Nightjars
belonging to Dr. 0 . Heinroth of Berlin, who, with the able
assistance of Mrs. Heinroth, keeps a good collection of native
insectivorous birds. I11 November 1906, a male bird was obtained
which had been fed entirely by being crammed, a practice which
had to be continued for nearly a month, when it commenced to
take food presented to it with tweezers, and finally was per-
suaded to take food from the ground.
During the spring of last year this bird tried to make a
nest, and its owner did his utmost to procure a mate for it.
In July two young birds were obtained, which proved to
be a pair. Of these the male was sent to the Frankfort Zoo, as
the original male would not agree with it. The remaining pair
were kept in a large cage during the night and morning, but
were allowed the free flight of Dr. Heinroth's study or dining-
room during the rest of the day.
Pairing took place at the end of May, and the male com-
menced to form a nesting place on a peccary-skin rug in the
dining-room, by twisting round and round and scraping with his
feet. Eggs were laid on the 2nd and 4th of June, the female
sitting well, her place being taken by the male when she left to
obtain food.
Incubation lasted sixteen and a quarter days, both eggs
hatching successfully. The young were fed by the parents by
the latter inserting their bills as far as the nostrils into those of
the chicks. Both young were successfully reared as were a
second brood of two, hatched in July, incubation in this case
occupying nearly two days longer than in the previous instance
owing to the birds leaving the eggs for longer periods.
These Nightjars are described as being extraordinarily
tame.

PROLIFIC BUDGERIGARS.
Sir, -- I starLed an aviary last spring, but so far have only tried
Budgerigars. I reared about 60 this year from four pairs. One bird had ten
eggs in the setting and brought off nine young birds successfully ; as far as I
can hear this is a record, and if you think so it might interest readers of the
Magazine. W. H. Workman.

one nest, the eggs being all laid by the same bird.-- Ed.]

Sir, --Is not this something of a record ? I had five young Parrot-
Fiuclies hatched on June \\th. They are all now fully moulted and like
their parents.
I removed them to another aviary to give their parents a chance of a
second brood. Two of these young ones have built a nest and it now has
two eggs in it. Is this a record ?

THE BREEDING OF THE PARTRIDGE TINAMOU.
Sir, --I was at the Natural History Museum yesterday and from
skins produced to me by the authorities there it is clear that my Tinamous
are not really " perdicaria " but " NolhoprocLci maculosa.&amp;apos;&amp;quot; I think it best to
let you know this at once and I feel that I owe the Council an apology for
the mistake. At the same time I never had the slightest doubt until
yesterday as to the name " perdicaria&amp;quot; being correct--especially as the
Birds have a very Partridge-like appearance.
As there seem to be between sixty&amp;apos; and seventy different sorts of
Tinamous--most of them very little known--a mistake is not surprising,
particularly&amp;apos; when the best books on the subject are only obtainable by the
experts.
Whether or not it will be well to have a note on the matter in next
month's Magazine is of course for you to say&amp;apos;. I should be very sorry to
mislead anyone. C. Barnby Smith.
[Several of the species of Tinamous so closely resemble one another
that unless one can actually&amp;apos; compare specimens with properly identified
skins it is very difficult to be sure of the species ; and it is hardly surprising
that such a mistake should have occurred. In the last number it was
announced that a Medal had been granted to Mr. Barnby Smith for rearing
young of Nothoprocta perdicaria , the Medal however was not ready&amp;apos; when
the above letter was received so lias been withheld.

Referring to the Medal that it was decided to award to Mr. Barnby
Smith for breeding Nothoprocta pendicaria (Vol. VI., p. 348); from a note in
our correspondence columns it will be seen that the birds were wrongly
identified, and the Medal has consequently been withheld.
O11 page 257, (Vol. VI.), Mr. Teschemaker gave an account of the
successful breeding in his aviaries of the Dwarf Ground Dove ( Chamcepelia
griseola), and it seems probable that this species had not previously been
bred in captivity in the United Kingdom.
At page 337. Mr. Newman commenced his account of the successful
rearing of young of the Partridge Bronze-wing Pigeon (Geophaps scripta).
Two specimens of the species were hatched at the Zoo. in 1891, but the
records of the Zoological Society show that these were incubated by
Barbary Doves and were not reared so probably Mr. Newman is the first ta
rear this species successfully in this country.
On page 345 Mr. C. Barnby Smith records the successful nesting in liis
aviaries of the Black Francolin (Francolinus vulgaris ) a species which, very
possibly, has not before reared young in captivity in the United Kingdom.

A NATURE STORY FOR BOYS AND GIRLS.
We have received from Messrs. Witherby &amp; Co. a book entitled
"The Changeling." It is from the pen of a well-known naturalist, Sir
Digby PiGOTT, and describes the adventures of the hero, a small boy with
a love for natural history, who, under fairy guidance, proceeds to the haunts
of birds and beasts, himself changed into one of them, and has many
thrilling adventures.
The book is delightfully written, and the habits of the creatures
dealt with are faithfully portrayed; it is also well illustrated and will prove
a great delight to all boys and girls who are fond of natural history. It can
be obtained from Messrs. Witherby &amp; Co., 326, High Holborn, W.C. for 2/6.

NOTES ON ROCK PTARMIGAN, HARLEQUIN
DUCK, ETC.
By C. Barnby Smith.
In the June number of the Magazine I mentioned that I
was about to visit Iceland and hoped to bring back some birds.
The most satisfactory result of my visit from this point of view
was the arrival at my house on the 5th of October of five healthy
Rock Ptarmigan (Lagopus inpestris ).
These Ptarmigan, which are usually regarded as a circum-
polar species nearly related to the Common Ptarmigan, have a
strange fascination for me and, as probably few members of the
Avicultural Society have had opportunities of seeing them both
in their native land and in captivity, I am writing a few notes
about them.
The Rock Ptarmigan, formerly very abundant in most
parts of Iceland (except the interior desert), is now getting
scarce in the South West, but it is still abundant in the North
though much persecuted by Falcons, and the last few j^ears a
good deal thinned by shooting for exportation.
The hen birds are of greyish brown plumage in summer,
the cocks retaining a good deal of white, and both cocks and
hens of course turn white in winter.
When I arrived in the My vatu District on the 19th of June
I rode some thirty miles without seeing a single hen as they were
then all sitting. Three weeks later they were to be seen all over
the district marshalling their little broods out of the way of
intruders.

Mr. C. Barnby Smith,
The cocks are wonderfully tame at this time of year and
*often sit on a lava rock within a few yards of a passer by, and
make a weird croak not altogether unsuggestive of the affliction
of " mal-de-mer." It is wonderful how the plumage of the cock
Ptarmigan seems to tone with the surroundings. It is illegal to
take Ptarmigan in Iceland until September, and later in the year
they grow very wild.
A very courteous Icelandic farmer accordingly promised
to try and capture me some birds in September. I myself had to
return to England in mid July, and on my return I despatched to
Iceland string netting to catch the Ptarmigan, wire netting to
make an aviary pending the sailing of the ship, and lastly I sent
many sorts of likely and unlikely foods in the hope that some
would be appreciated.
After some difficulty seven Ptarmigan were netted early in
September but they declined at first to take readily to artificial
food. My Icelandic friend accordingly collected them some
natural food for a time and gradually got them to take more
and more of the artificial.
In a letter which he sent me with the birds he says:

"with the birds are grown on Uva ursi. The other kind of
"berries the Ptarmigan are fond of are growing on what they
" call in Latin Empetrum nigrum, Vaccinium uliginosum and V.
myrtillusP
The idea of sending bear-berries to give the birds a little
natural food aboard ship seemed to me excellent, and the birds
stood the voyage well.
On arrival they were already in a three quarters winter
plumage, and the effect of change of latitude and climate on
their future plumage will, I venture to think, be of interest to
those who care for game birds.
A few days after arrival I pinioned the Ptarmigan (losing
one as the direct result) and turned them down into a large grass
uncovered run. I feed them on small seeds (a mixture known as
Chiklco,") dari and a few berries. They are very fond of the

ends of grass leaves, also clover flowers and many seeds of
different weeds which they find amongst the grass. They do not
move much in the middle of the day but feed very actively for
about an hour at sunset. One thing puzzles me, namely, that
about dusk each evening they repeatedly tap with their bills the
larch poles which support the wire netting of their enclosure. If
the object is to get insects they can scarcely have acquired the
habit in Iceland as there are virtually no trees there.
I have given the birds some pieces of rock to perch on,
and of course keep them supplied with plenty of water. In their
enclosure is a large bare sandy spot where they are fed. They
are exceedingly tame and come running to be fed. It may be
that English summers will be trying to the birds but Icelandic
summers are much hotter than most people suppose. Last sum-
mer was exceptionally hot and I had good opportunities of
watching Ptarmigan, which seemed by no means distressed by a
temperature which I felt uncomfortably hot. The trouble of
getting these birds has been very great, but if they live and breed
in this country I shall feel amply repaid.
I hoped to bring back with me from Iceland some Harle-
quin Ducks, or at any rate some Harlequin Duck eggs to hatch
in this country. Judging from Messrs. Pearsons recorded ex-
perience I thought there would be no difficulty in getting fresh
eggs in the North of Iceland at the time of my visit. However,
I learnt on the 20th June that almost all the Harlequin Ducks in
the district where I stayed had already brought off young, and
only one nest was known, and the duck in this case was already
sitting. This nest was on a good large island in the middle of a
rapidly flowing river--the island being covered with low bushes
in the middle and grassy round the edges. The nest was under
a bush about fifteen yards from the water and contained only
four eggs (the others having been taken by a farmer).
After some difficulty I got a sitting hen (these are very
scarce in the locality), and having proved her earnest desire to
sit, I took some cotton-wadding with a hot water bottle in, a
basket and, committing myself to the back of a small Icelandic
pony and to the care of a still smaller Icelandic boy, I forded
to the island and brought back the eggs in triumph. The eggs

could do was to leave behind many injunctions as to feeding,,

I may mention that the writer of this letter (who is an
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.974795285714286" page_id="32659630"  page_num="58" year="" vol="">
observer of nature) told me that Harlequin Ducks sit about five
weeks, and when I pressed him to diminish the time he said that
at any rate they sat much longer than any other duck he knew.
Since the new Game Laws came into operation in Iceland
Harlequin Ducks have rapidly increased and are now very
common on the fast running rivers in the North. As they are
very tame in the breeding season they present a most charming
sight.
In the immediate vicinity of Lake Myvatn ducks of all
kinds simply swarm. The ducks most in evidence being the
" Long-tails," but Scoters, Pintails, Golden-eyes, Teal, Mallard,
Wigeon, Scaups, and other varieties are in abundance. Whether
or not the eggs of the rarer sorts could be got over and hatched
in this country I do not know. It might be worth a trial next
year if a steamer were coming direct from the North at the right
season.
I was informed by the owner of a well known " Eider Duck
farm " that the broods of Eider Ducks often get hopelessly mixed,
and that one old bird will attempt to look after twenty or thirty
young ones. The nests of the Eiders are exceedingly thick in
favourite spots near the coast, but Falcons and other enemies are

numerous. I myself caught on a fly a four-pound brown trout
that had previously swallowed two Eider chicks.
I brought back with me from Iceland a pair of Falcons
taken from the nest, and it was interesting to note the gradual
growth of the feathers and alteration in the birds' disposition as
they grew older. There seems no difficulty whatever in rearing
these birds, but I was surprised to see a pair which had been
reared in Iceland on fish diet were quite as fine as others reared
on meat. Many intelligent Icelanders say that the Grey-White
Falcons (said to be "Greenland Falcons") are really the same as
the Icelandic Falcon which, they say, changes to grey and white
plumage when a few years old. I only saw one of these grey-
white birds. It was darker than the specimen " Greenland
Falcon " in the South Kensington Museum. Perched on a point
of lava rock its plumage harmonised precisely with its surround-
ings, but when seen near at hand the bird presented a magnificent
*spectacle.
Red-necked Phalaropes are very plentiful at present in the
neighbourhood of Myvatn, and in the latter part of June their
nesting operations were in full progress.
All the nests I found were in small tufts of grass within a
few feet of water. In one case the sitting bird returned to his
nest whilst I remained watching within a distance of five yards.
In another case the parent bird, alarmed at my approach, took a
solitary chick to swim into the middle of a little pool about eight
yards across. After a minute or so, finding nothing happened,
he brought the chick ashore and began to brood it in full view of
me on the other side of the pool. I do not know whether Red-
necked Phalaropes have been much observed brooding their
young, but this was a very pretty sight, the chick standing up-
right and reminding me (though of course on a very different
scale) of the little Avocet at the Zoo in 1907.
I happened to come across a Dane who was stationed in
Iceland to collect skins, and he showed me, in his bedroom, a
Phalarope running about the floor. I asked him to catch it for
me, which he did, and I found it in good condition. He told me
it was a bird he had winged when shooting three weeks previously,
and it since then lived in his bedroom, being fed on maggots and

flies. I have no reason to doubt the truth of his statement; at
any rate there was the Phalarope in good health.
I reasoned thus: if a wounded Phalarope will live in a
bedroom in Iceland for three weeks is it not possible to get
healthy Phalaropes to survive the journey to England, if suitable
food is provided on the voyage ? If kind fates permit me to go
to Iceland next summer I hope to make the attempt. Doubtless
there are many difficulties, but the Phalarope is such a charming
little wader he is worth a good deal of trouble.

Paradisornis rudolphi.
By Sir Wirriam Ingram, Bart.
During nearly fifty years before the y^ear 1904, only sixteen
Birds of Paradise had been received at the London Zoological
Gardens, and these only arrived one or two at a time. Dr..
Wallace, the great naturalist and traveller, although he made
several attempts, was never successful in keeping, for any length
of time, those birds that were brought to him alive. It was only
in the year 1904 that any satisfactory result was achieved in
keeping any number of these lovely birds in captivity. Mr.
Goodfellow, who had had much experience in importing tropical
birds, such as Lories, Parrots, Pigeons, etc., landed in England
two King Birds, two Paradisea minor and one Paradisea apoda
all of which eventually found their way to the Regent's Park
Zoological Gardens. In the following year I was successful in
landing at Genoa, for my aviaries near Monte Carlo, twenty Birds
of Paradise, three King Birds, one Paradisea minor and sixteen.
Paradisea apoda. Again in 1907 I imported twelve pairs of King
Birds, and six females of the Great Bird ( P. apoda ) ; and this
year I have been the means of introducing alive into this country
more than fifty Birds of Paradise belonging to seven different
species never before imported, including one specimen of that
exceeding rare and beautiful bird, the Blue Bird of Paradise
(Paradisornis rudolphi).
It was after viewing the case of stuffed Birds of Paradise
in the Natural History Museum that I was first stirred with the

intense desire of seeing alive a Blue Bird of Paradise, and also
a Six-plumed Bird ( Parotia sexpennis) ; there is something so
beautiful and attractive in these stuffed specimens, even in their
attenuated glory, lacking as they do the gloss and radiance of
the living bird, that it is no wonder that I was eager to try, if it
were possible, to follow up my former successes by securing
living examples of these gorgeous birds. The result of my
enthusiasm has been that, in the year 1908, there have been
specimens of both of these rare and exquisite birds on view at
the Zoological Gardens. Alas! the sojourn of the Rudolphi was
brief indeed, as he survived only three weeks after arriving in
London. It is of the story of the importation of this Blue Bird
that I have been asked to write.
Carl Hunstein, the adventurous gold-miner and naturalist,
first discovered the Blue Bird of Paradise, which proved to belong
to quite a new genus and was called Paradisornis rudolphi, being
named after that well known ornithologist, the late Crown Prince
of Austria.
Carl Hunstein found the bird in the far interior of British
New Guinea, on the &amp;quot;Stanley Owen Range, about 8000 feet above
the sea level. He had to penetrate, with only one or two native
followers, into the country of the cannibals. From the time of
its discovery very few dead specimens have reached Europe, and
it is pretty well known that, to procure this bird, one would have
to travel far into the Interior. I knew that I had given my
collector an exceedingly difficult task to get this bird. However
I was most fortunate in the choice of the gentlemen whom I
selected to undertake this arduous journey. Mr. C. B. Horsbrugh,
the head of the expedition, had already had much experience in
travelling and collecting in South Africa, and it was fortunate
that I found him at liberty to undertake the duty. Mr. Stalker,
who accompanied him, had already had some experience in col-
lecting in Central Australia and also in British New Guinea. I
was indeed lucky in persuading the heads of the Zoological Society
to join with me in the enterprise; they gave me the greatest
assistance by using their influence in getting important members
of the Commonwealth Government of Australia to give their
support to the expedition, and render much assistance which
proved of the greatest value.

Sir Wiixiam Ingram,
The district which Mr. Horsbrugh eventually chose, acting
on the advice of the Governor of British New Guinea, was that
lying to the east of Mount Yule, near the head of the St. Joseph
River. I will not here recount the numerous adventures and
difficulties that Messrs. Horsbrugh and Stalker encountered
before getting together a sufficient number of Birds of Paradise,
that is, as many as they could conveniently manage on their long
journey home, but suffice to say that after some weeics collecting
they had obtained several specimens of the lovely Count Raggi's
Bird (. Paradisea raggiana), Lawe's Six-plumed ( Parotia lawesi),
Hunstein's Magnificent Bird ( D. hunsteini), the New Guinea
Rifle Bird (. Ptilorhis intercedens), and some Manucodes, but no
example of P. rudolphi. By this time they had learned that this
species was far away; some of the natives from a distance recog-
nised the bird from a colour drawing which was shown to them,
but they assured Mr. Horsbrugh that it lived many miles away,
far in the interior, and they made him understand that even in
its native haunts the bird was very rare; therefore Horsbrugh
and Stalker were in a great dilemma, but they eventually decided
on the wisest course, that was for them both to return to the
coast, one to take the valuable consignment they had collected to
England, the other to remain and make a great effort to reach
the place where the Blue Bird might be found, and if possible to
secure some specimens. As Mr. Stalker was ill, suffering from
bad sores in his hands and legs, it was decided that he should
rest at Yule Island and recuperate there, and Mr. Horsbrugh
should return to Europe. The latter was successful in bringing
home safely the most varied and important collection of birds
that had up to that time ever reached this country.
Some time afterwards I had news of Stalker's movements,
he had recovered from his illness and had started alone for the
interior ; he had many difficulties to overcome, having to cut his
way through a tropical forest, the inhabitants of three villages
being engaged for ten days cutting a path. Stalker had taken
with him ten natives, skilled in capturing live birds, and when at
last he had reached the locality where the Blue Bird might be
found he was confronted with the most serious obstacle he had
yet met. His native followers refused to go into the bush in

search of the birds, as they had learnt that the chief of the district
resented their intrusion into his country and had threatened
literally to "eat them up" if he caught them. There was only
one alternative to returning empty handed with all the labour of
months wasted, and that was to beard the Lion in his Den. I am
glad to say that Stalker, who is a plucky little Englishman, chose
the latter and, with only an interpreter, boldly went into the
chief's,! village and demanded a palaver. At first the Potentate
refused to believe Stalker's assurance that they had come with no
evil intent but simply to catch alive a bird ; and it was only after
he was told that there was a great white chief who had more
white warriors than there were trees in the forest, who desired to
see a live specimen of this particular bird, and had told Stalker
to get one, and had sent as a present to the chief a splendid toma-
hawk, that he was induced to give his consent to the strangers
hunting in his province. Stalker had to persuade the chief
to remain in his camp as a sort of hostage before his hunters
would agree to go out in search of the Blue Bird. They only
saw one flock of six, three of which were captured, but unfort-
unately two of them were so much injured that they both died
the next day. Although the surrounding country was searched
for fourteen days longer no more specimens were seen, and
Stalker had to start back on his long journey to England, more
than sixteen thousand miles.
The captured bird was a very fine male, exceedingly healthy,
and never seemed to suffer at an)&amp;apos;&amp;apos; time during the months he was
spending in a small cage on board ship, passing through several
different climates; and it seems sad indeed that he only survived
three weeks after he was deposited in the Zoo, dying of Protozoan
enteritis. I cannot but think that, as he came from the higher
ranges of mountains in British New Guinea, where the climate is
not so relaxing, the New Bird House, where he was placed in the
Zoo, was of too high a temperature and too enervating.
When I first saw the live Blue Bird I was somewhat
disappointed with his appearance; he resembled in colour and
shape a small Jackdaw with a very comical expression, arising
from the clown-like effect caused by the two slightly curved
and narrow lines of white feathers, one just above and one just

Rev. F. R. Blathwayt,
below each eye, his plumes too were not " en evidence " having
been considerably reduced by his confinement for so many
months in a small cage. It was only after he had been placed in
one of the large aviaries in the New Bird House at the Zoo that
I was able to inspect him more closely; when he flew from his
perch down on to the ground, the magnificence of his azure blue
plumage was most conspicuous ; the sheen of the feathers on his
back was like spun glass, glistening like the ripples of the water
of the blue Mediterranean sea. The dull black plumage too, in
certain lights, reflected the various hues of the rainbow. It is
remarkable that the black plumage of several of the Paradise
Birds has this peculiarity of changing in certain reflected lights
into iridescent colours, green, blue and copper; this may be
observed on any day in the case of the Parotid lawesi now in the
Zoological Gardens. It must be a wonderful and entrancing
sight to see the Rudolphi displaying with his full plumage in the
sunlight amidst the foliage of his dancing tree. The natives
who caught the bird say they saw him displaying on a creeper,
climbing up the face of a cliff in a ravine. There were six birds
altogether disporting on the same plant.
I very much doubt if we shall ever see his like again ; the
expense and risk in procuring this bird are too great for any
private person to undertake, but, as long as I live, I shall always
think of what might have been, had my bird lived to renew his
plumage and to give an exhibition of his display.

THE CHALK CLIFFS OF YORKSHIRE.
" Though rising&amp;apos; gale and breaking foam
And shrieking sea-birds warned him home." Byron.
A bang on the door at 4.45 a.m. on June 17th last, roused
me up for my first visit to the cliffs about Flamborough Head.
My first thought was "Is it a fine day?" No, the rain was
pouring down from a leaden sky. It poured incessantly during
a three-and-a-half hours railway journey. It came down harder
than ever during the five hours we tramped from Bridlington along
the summit of the great cliffs, and, driven in from the sea by a

stiff breeze the rain-water found its way through every garment,
wetting us to the skin and leaving the sandwiches limp and
sodden in our pockets- " A pleasant ramble indeed ! " someone
will say; but the bird enthusiast is not kept indoors by the
vagaries of the weather. What we saw on those cliffs amply
repaid us for dripping garments and even for sitting more than
three hours, waterlogged, on the homeward journey.
What are the chalk cliffs of Yorkshire? Few bird-lovers
need to ask the question. Their fame reaches far and wide.
Look at a geological map of England and you will see that the
chalk formation running across England from Dorset to Norfolk,
with branches to Dover and Beach)&amp;apos;&amp;apos; Head, is continued along the
Lincolnshire Wolds into Yorkshire and faces the North Sea at
Flamborougli Head with a magnificent rampart extending for
some eleven miles along the coast, and rising in places to an
elevation of well over 400 feet. The grandeur of this white wall
alone repays the trouble of a visit, but it was the desire to see the
teeming bird-population of the cliffs that urged us on to battle
with the unfavourable elements on that day in mid-June. Seven
miles of cliffs thickly populated with rock-birds ! Is not that
sight good enough to make up for much personal discomfort?
As we walked along those chalk cliffs stretching from
Flamborougli Head Lighthouse towards Filey, four species of
birds were much in evidence. These were Guillemots, Puffins,
Razorbills and Kittiwakes. The first-mentioned species was by
far the most numerous, the Puffins coming next in point of
numbers. The sea, hundreds of feet below, was dotted over with
the rock-birds, of which, numbers were constantly hurrying in
front of the cliff face or dashing with that peculiar swift flight
to or from the sea, while from time to time a perfect avalanche of
startled birds would pour headlong from a ledge of the cliffs
into the waves which lashed the boulders below. The stiff sea
breeze buffeted the birds when on the wing and seemed to in-
convenience their flight considerably, sometimes blowing them
right over in the air and turning them from the course they had
shaped towards some favourite ledge. Sometimes they would
hang in the air against the wind a few feet from the cliff top, so
close to us that it seemed we could catch them in a butterfly net;

Rev. F. L. Blathwayt,
at other times they would dash down wind like a shower of
meteors. Though the rain was pouring down upon us we con-
stantly found ourselves lying full length on the edge of the cliffs
and, with field-glasses quivering in the wind and blurred by rain-
drops, trying to learn something of the busy life on the faces of
those walls of chalk.
And what a wonderful sight it was! The rock-birds and
the little grey Kittiwakes seemed to have taken advantage of
every available ledge and cranny on the face of the cliffs. In
spite of the fresh breeze, a fishy odour pervaded the air, and no
wonder, for as we peered over the cliffs or gazed at their faces
from some projecting promontory a wonderful sight met our
gaze. The Guillemots were clustered on some of the wider
shelves like swarms of bees ; on other cliffs they were scattered
more sparingly over the entire surface as the narrow ledges
afforded resting places for themselves and their eggs. Sometimes
on a mighty white wall sheer and smooth for several hundred
feet, a dark horizontal or diagonal bar might be seen traversing
its surface. This line on closer inspection proved to be formed
of hundreds perhaps thousands of Guillemots, sitting by their
mates or on their eggs, on the only resting place the particular
cliff could afford them. The Puffins for the most part seemed to
prefer those parts of the cliffs where they could find a little soil
in which to burrow and bring up their solitary offspring. The
Razorbills mingle with the Guillemots, but are not nearly so
numerous, and lay their eggs half hidden in crevices and sheltered
places. The Kittiwakes during our visit were not very much in
evidence on the wing, as they seemed anxious to shelter from the
force of the wind, but we saw several colonies of these birds, the
members for the most part busy incubating their two eggs or
brooding over their newly-hatched chicks in the scanty nests
stuck to tiny ledges of the cliffs. Now and again a screaming
Kittiwalce would chase away a marauding Jackdaw, and a pair or
two of Herring Gulls might constantly be seen wheeling about
the cliff face on the look out for exposed eggs. A confused babel
of chattering cries and wailing screams was constantly rising up
from below, notes of anger, jealousy, defiance, welcome and love
mingling together and harmonizing with the raging elements and
the general weirdness of the scene.

Rock Doves and Stock Doves were also breeding in the
caves and on the cliffs, but the four species first mentioned in this
" ramble " are those which especially claim these cliffs as their
summer home, and which chiefly delight the bird-loving visitors.
Such w T as my first impression of these famous white walls,
but it only whetted my appetite to see them again on a fine day.
Accordingly a few days later, June 23rd, I managed to snatch
another holiday, and journeying this time alone, found myself at
mid-day once more on the edge of those sea cliffs. And how
different were the conditions of the weather! In place of the
driving rain a warm sun shone down from an almost cloudless
sky, the heat being tempered by a light N.E. breeze. The cliff-
climbers were busy with their work, which consists of gathering
for sale the sea birds eggs which in hundreds and thousands are
laid on the ledges and crannies of the cliffs. This right of egg
gathering is granted by the neighbouring farmers to about four
gangs of men, who keep strictly to their own ground. The
season for gathering begins about the third week in May and
finishes at the end of June. After that date the birds are allowed
to lay their eggs and hatch out their young in peace. It is stated
that from these cliffs some 130,000 eggs, chiefly Guillemot's, are
taken in a season, but in spite of this the birds are said to in-
crease yearly. Most of the eggs are used as food, being sold at a
wholesale price of about twelve or sixteen a shilling ; others are
applied to the processes of clarifying wine and dressing patent
leather. Visitors to the cliff top can pick ordinary specimens
from the men's baskets at twopence apiece, but exceptionally
well marked varieties have been sold for seven shillings and six-
pence each or even more.
Razorbills and Guillemots produce only one egg at a lay-
ing, but if this is taken a second or even a third is laid at
intervals of from seventeen to twenty days. These last facts I
have gathered from an authority who knows these cliffs well.
It afforded me great interest to watch the gangs at
work. The process appeared to be as follows. A member of
the gang (consisting of about five men) first drives an iron stake
into the ground at the cliff top, to which a hand-rope is attached
and the loose end flung over the cliff. The 'dimmer,'as the

man who descends is called, tlien sits in a hemp sling attached to
a second rope which is passed round the body of a man, wearing
a leather apron, who does the lowering. This man sits on the
ground and digging his heels well into the soil pays out the rope as
the ' dimmer' walks backwards to the cliff edge. At the extreme
edsre the latter sticks into the soil an iron stake with a revolving
wheel at the top, and passing the body-rope over the groove of
the wheel is lowered quickly over the cliff by his companions
above. A code of signals by jerking the rope regulates the
' dimmers ' movements on the cliff face, and when the command
'up' is given he is hauled straight up by those above, and
empties the eggs he has gathered, from the canvas bags slung
around him, into large baskets. The process is then repeated,
until all the ledges to be visited that day have been thoroughly
worked. This is done sjcstematically, and some cliffs, if in danger
of being over-gathered are allowed to lie ' fallow' for a time. It
is no doubt owing to the systematic gathering that only fresh
eggs are taken and the numbers of the birds are not diminished.
The only danger the 'dimmer' has to face is from falling stones,
and that is guarded against by a hard hat stuffed with grass.
Guillemot's eggs vary in colour and marking to an enor-
mous extent, and the men say it is impossible to find two exactly
alike. Large basketsful of eggs just brought up make a pretty
picture, ranging from pure white through various shades of
green and greenish blue, unmarked, blotched, streaked, and
pencilled in endless variety, up to dark eggs smeared over almost
the entire surface with chocolate and reddish brown. Razorbill's
eggs are far more constant in their markings and never show
the green varieties.
On the day of my visit a large excursion party was watch-
ing one of the gangs at work, and to quiet one or two of the more
lively spirits who were in constant danger of falling over the
cliffs, the men consented to let them down to try their hand at
e gg&amp;apos; n g- The first shaped very well, but the second youth
provoked a roar of laughter, as on being hauled up it was found
that he had managed to get his ropes in an extraordinary tangle
about his body. That particular gang must have done a good
trade that day, as they had brought up some hundreds of eggs

and many of the excursionists were buying them as souvenirs of
their visit, at prices ranging from twopence apiece. " Are you
going to eat them ? " I said to one, who had bought half-a-dozen
or so. " No thank you," said he, " I'm much too dainty." He
\0x25A0 told me however that someone had just ordered several dozen
eggs to lay by for the winter. I cannot speak of the flavour of
these eggs from personal experience, but I see no reason why
they should not be as palatable as Penguin's eggs from the Cape,
&amp;apos;which have lately been on sale in London as table delicacies.
The demand however for Guillemots eggs in one way or another
seems equal to the supply, and judging from the countless
swarms of birds haunting the cliffs, there is little danger, so long
as a close season is observed, of the numbers of the Guillemots
jbeing seriously diminished.

A NOVICE'S AVIARIES.
By W. R. Temple.
Among the many interesting and instructive articles in the
\\Avicultural Magazine I have never seen a description of the first
1 attempt in avicultural management by a novice : and as I have
been asked by several members of the Society to write an account
of my experience, I propose, with great diffidence, to write of the
doings in my aviaries this season. Perhaps it would be best if I
briefly describe the aviaries first. There are four of them alto-
gether. Three, which I will call A B and C. consist of indoor
flights about 12 ft. square and 9 ft. high, which open into outdoor
flights of rather larger dimensions. The indoor parts are heated
{ with hot-water pipes, and the flights are laid down with turf and
planted thickly with shrubs.
These three aviaries are at the bottom of the flower garden,
built against a high wall facing South. The fourth avian'- D is
in the kitchen garden. It has an outer flight 36 ft. long, 24 ft.
wide and 12 ft. high. This flight opens at one end into a glass
shelter about 12 ft. long, 9 ft. wide and 8 ft. high, which again
i opens into a similar glass covered shelter heated with liot-water

of September and kept on till the end of March, but plenty of
! ventilation is given.

Mr. W. R. Temple,
I got my small stock of birds together last autumn and
this spring. They consisted of what I believed to be three pairs
of Parrot Finches, one pair of Long-tailed Grassfinches, one pair
of Masked Finches, six pairs of Gouldians (mostly Red-headed
cocks), one pair of Pintailed Nonpareils, two pairs of Ruficaudas,
and some small fry in the shape of two pairs of Orange-cheeked
Waxbills, a pair of Amaduvades, a pair of Cordon Bleus and a
pair of African Firefinches.
I next devoured all the articles I could come across in the
Aviculhiral Magazine . and among others, one written by Mrs.
Johnstone, in which she said that " to breed Parrot Finches they
must have an aviary to themselves." Up to the end of March
my six Parrot Finches were all together, and they seemed to
spend most of their time in fighting and chasing each other
about. When several Parrot Finches are together I think I have
discovered an infallible method of distinguishing the pairs. I
have a box cage hung up, with a sliding front of wire bars,
heavily weighted. This drops very freely into a groove. I raise
it up and fasten it with a long cord, and put all the seed pans
inside. I then watch for a Parrot Finch to go inside. He (or
she) is presently joined by another. If they are a pair they will
proceed to quietly eat out of the same pan and down goes the
trap ; if they are not a pair one at once chases the other out.
Acting on this principle I put one pair of Parrot Finches in A,
another in B, all the other birds in C, except the Gouldians,
Pintailed Nonpareils, a pair of Cordon Bleus and the other pair
of Parrot Finches, which I put in D. I hung up a number of
nest boxes and a few cocoanut husks in the inside part of the
aviaries only ; and every evening, just before dusk, all the birds
were driven in. This I did not do at first, but one night a
terrific thunderstorm killed several Gouldians, and others were
frightened to death by the ubiquitous cat.
Inside A and B there were three boxes, and these the two
pairs of Parrot Finches at once commenced to stuff full of hay.
They continued to make nests and pull them to pieces till the
beginning of June, when they commenced to sit in earnest.
Those in A made their nest in a box very high up at the top of
the aviary, and those in B in a box within 3 ft. of the ground. I

know that there were young ones in the nest in A on June 14th
and in B on June 25th. In A three young ones left the nest on
July 5th, and in B five left the nest on July 15th. Now a curious
thing about these young birds was that, whereas the whole five
in B were green all over , in A one was green and the other two
were marked with red almost as plainly as their parents. I found
when the young leave the nest they all sit in a row at the highest
point of the aviary, packed as close together as possible. They
were all terribly wild and the moment I went near the place to
feed them the young ones would fly madly about the place till
they were absolutely exhausted. I have come to the conclusion
that a young Parrot Finch is about as tough as they make
them.
I was away from home for five weeks from August 2nd,
and on my return found that the old hen and two of the young
</bodyText>

ones in A had died, but all those in B were flourishing and
almost as red on the head and tail as their parents. The pair in
B showed signs of wanting to nest again, I therefore removed the
odd cock (the widower) from A and put the five young ones from
B into A with the other young bird : thus six young ones were
altogether in A and the original pair in B.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.993015294117647" page_id="32659647"  page_num="71" year="" vol="">
The behaviour of these young birds astonished me. It
must be remembered that five of them left the nest 011 July 15
and the other on July 5. Four of these young birds paired and
each pair built a nest, and on Sept, inid (when they were about
three months old) there were five eggs in each nest. They did
not attempt to sit, however, so I removed all the eggs. I gave
two of them to a friend in Eton who put them under a hen
Gouldian Finch, and she hatched them both but would not feed
them. Surely this is early precocity.*
The original pair in B nested again and five strong young
ones left the nest on Oct. 28 and are doing well, f
I ought to mention that I have the electric light laid on in
the aviaries and can turn it on from the house. This is done at
six o'clock every morning and enables the old birds to feed their
young.
The letter appearing- on page 52, was written some weeks before publication,
t The old birds are now (Nov. 14,) sitting again on five eggs.

Now as to feeding these birds. I give Canary, white and
brown millet (in three separate pans), spray millet, and eight
mealworms per pair. When they have young I give, in addition,
some of Trower's improved " Cecto " food, hard boiled egg, and
fourteen mealworms.
The two Parrot Finches in D, I fancy are two cocks, as
they showed no signs of breeding and are not too amiably dis-
posed towards each other.
Of the other birds the Gouldian Finches laid over fifty
eggs. For the most part they seemed to lay about in any of the
nest boxes in the most haphazard waj^ and, having deposited
their eggs, took no further interest in them. I had, however,
very bad luck with them, as on the night of the heavy thunder-
storm before mentioned, three hens were all inside sitting on
eggs and their unfortunate dissolute husbands were out all night.
They all perished and the hens forsook their nests. I succeeded
in the end in getting ten young ones flying about in the aviary,
but of these six died. The Pintailed Nonpareils laid but did not
sit. The Cordon Bleus had very bad luck. They built a beauti-
ful little nest of hay and pine-needles against the wall in the
inside aviary. They laid several clutches of eggs, but were
always interfered with by the Gouldians, who picked their nest to
pieces. Finally they gave up the nest and built in one of the
nest boxes, where they hatched four young ones, but the cock
died the day they hatched. I doubt if he ever saw his offspring.
The hen, single-handed, reared two of them till they were ten
days old, and then they died.
I forgot to mention that there is a separate division in the
inner compartment of D, and in this was a cock Red-headed
Finch and a hen Ribbon Finch. These hatched four nests of
young hybrids, but always threw them out of the nest when a
couple of days old. A pair of Harlequin Quails in the outside
flight of D reared a family also. These gave no trouble, and it
was not until they could fly that I discovered they were there.
Of the birds in C three nests of Ruficaudas and two of Long-
tailed Grass-finches were reared. The Amaduvadesand Orange-
cheeked Waxbills also hatched out but failed to rear their young.
On the whole I do not think I can be said to have done so

THE CAVES OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990290642857143" page_id="32659649"  page_num="73" year="" vol="">
The third day of our visit to the Margaret River district of
Western Australia we decided to devote to a drive through the
forest to the caves, the nearest of which was situated about
seven miles from where we were staying. The country here
contains many subterranean streams running through limestone
rock, the result being that, where this has been worn away by
the action of the water, large caverns have been formed under-
ground which have been marvellously decorated by nature.
While the underground stream has been at work hollowing out
the cave, the rain-water soaking through the soil from above
becomes charged with carbonic acid which, when it reaches
the porous limestone becomes again highly charged with this,
together with a certain proportion of iron oxide. This solution,
constantly dripping from the roofs of the caves, deposits its
lime, and gradually forms the curious fantastic ornaments such
as stalactites, stalagmites, shawls, rock-snow and so forth;
objects of the most extraordinary beauty, many of which are
delicately coloured by the oxide of iron which is frequently
present in the solution.
During our drive to the Caves we again encountered two
large parties of Calyptorhy?ichus baudini as well as numbers of
"Twenty-eight" Parrakeets, Leaden Crow-shrikes or "Squeakers"
were also constantly seen and heard. I noticed one or two other
Parrakeets which I could not identify, so during a halt in our
drive, during which our driver went to see a friend whose shanty
was some little distance from the road, I strolled into the forest
with a gun to endeavour if possible to shoot, for identification, one
of these Parrakeets. They were very shy, perching as a rule on

Mr. D. Seth-Smith,
the highest branches of the trees, which here grew to such a
height that their topmost branches were practically out of range
of a shot gun. However I soon secured a specimen which proved
to be the beautiful Pileated Parrakeet, Porphyrocephalus pileatus.
After this I was able to identify many of these birds which
generally flew about in pairs or small parties of three or four
individuals. Fantail Flycatchers, White-breasted Robins (. Eop -
saltria leucogaster), several species of Honeyeaters and Thick-
heads ( Pachycephahis ) were also noticed.
On arrival at the entrance to the Mammoth Cave I strolled
round amongst the giant Karri trees which there grow profusely,
and was rewarded by the sight of a large flock of small Lorikeets
which came swinging into the tree tops at a tremendous pace.
They were very wild, and dashed off again as I approached the
foot of the tree. It was impossible to see their colours, but they
were doubtless Purple-crowned Lorikeets ( G/ossopsitlacus porphy-
rocephalus). On approaching close to the entrance to the Cave a
party of four Stanley Parrakeets ( Pl&amp;apos;atycercus icterotis) flew up from
the ground and settled amongst the high branches of a tree. We
saw several of these pretty Parrakeets, they were not at all timid,
allowing us to approach them fairly closely as they fed on the
seeds of the various wattles.
The Mammoth Cave is so called on account of its large
size. My pen is not capable of adequately describing its wonders,
so I will quote the following description by Mr. Erskine May,
from the Western Australian Year Book for 1900-01 :--
"This cave . . . has been given the name of " Mam-
moth " on account of its majestic proportions and its colossal
- formations. The entrance to the cave has an Eastern aspect,
and, surrounded as it is by an exuberant growth of ferns, roughly
hidden amongst the giant trees of Australia--the noble Karri--is
most charmingly and imposingly situated. Passing through it,
an enormous dome is entered, which contains many stalactites of
the greatest beauty. This portion of the cave is best seen at
night time, as otherwise the daylight prying through the entrance
detracts considerably from the mysterious beauty of the scene
within. From the door of the cave to its furthermost recess,
wonder after wonder presents itself at almost every step, but

throughout the whole of this subterranean fairyland its bewilder-
ing beauties can only be adequately appreciated by those who
have had the good fortune to be able to examine for themselves
these exquisite specimens of Nature's handiwork. The most
prominent features that claim attention are: (i) " The Eagle's
Wings," two huge formations which have a most striking resem-
blance to an eagle with slightly raised wings perched on an
immense boulder ; (2) " The Tree," a marvellous little stalagmite
about three feet in height, with twig-like projections of lateral
stalactites growing in a complete circle, the very semblance of
a young tree throwing out its branches ; (3) "The Cathedral and
Organ Pipes," the latter of which not only resemble an organ in
form, but on being struck by the hand fill the cavern with clear,
melodious notes of a particularly unique and weird sound ; and
(4), last but not least, this cave possesses " The Mammoth Shawl,"
which, with its artistically blended colours, hangs gracefully
between two walls, with a careless-looking fold in the centre, its
edges being most delicately and beautifully scalloped."
A drive of a mile and a half brought us to the entrance of
" The Lake Cave," which is considered the most beautiful cave
that has yet been explored. To enter it one has first to descend
into an enormous hollow in the ground, which has been formed,
long ago, by the subsidence of part of the roof of the cave. This
great circular pit, some acres in extent, is over 300 feet in depth,
the sides being sheer cliffs. Ferns and other vegetation grow
luxuriantly in this hollow, and several huge Karri trees, whose
highest branches reach to about the surrounding ground level,
Kangaroos and Wallabies occasionally fall into this huge hole,
and on one occasion the skeleton of a large Kangaroo was dis-
covered, and beside it the remains of a Dingo which had evidently
been chasing the Kangaroo when both fell into this hollow.
The entrance to the cave itself is by a mere hole just large
enough for one person to descend at a time. The roof is domed,
and from it hang myriads of pure white stalactites which, when
illuminated by the magnesium lantern, present a wonderful ap-
pearance, being reflected in the clear water of the stream which
here covers the greater part of the floor of the cave, and has
given it the name of the "Lake Cave." In the middle of the

lake, about two feet above the water is the " Suspended Table."
It is 15 feet long by 7 feet wide and about one inch in thickness
and is hung from the ceiling of the cave by two enormous
stalactites.
During our drive home we made two captures, the first
being a Stump-tailed Lizard (Trachysaurus rugosus) which lay in
the centre of the roadway and only opened its big mouth as the
horses passed over it, fortunately without touching it. These
lizards or " Yarners," as the Aboriginals call them, are about
twelve inches in length and covered with large scales which vary
much in colour according to the hue of the soil upon which
they are found. They are very slow movers, trusting for safety
to their wonderfully protective coloration, and merely opening
their great mouths when one goes to pick them up. Our second
capture was a young " Squeaker," which had evidently just left
the nest. I saw this bird fly up from the roadway on to a mound
at the side, and, jumping down from the buggy, gave chase. It
could fly a little and gave some trouble in catching, but I finally
secured it, and deposited it in a basket in the buggy. I fed this
bird on raw meat and bread and milk and it got on well, being
almost able to feed itself when I left Perth a few days later. But,
alas, on my return three months later to take away my Western
Australian stock, I learned that my "Squeaker" had died.
During our drive home a large Kangaroo crossed the road-
way in front of the buggy, going at a great rate. It belonged to
the Western form of the Great Kangaroo (Macropus giganteus),
which has been separated as a sub-species under the name of M.
vielanotus.
The following morning a very young Rat Kangaroo ( Betton -
gia penicillata ) was brought in by a man who had heard that I
wanted any kind of living creatures that could be procured. This
was a charming little animal and showed no sign of fear. It
wanted a pouch to sleep in, so we procured an old tea-cosy which
it immediately took a " header " into and curled up to sleep. I
fed it on warm milk from a spoon, and it got on well and was
eventually reared to maturity in the Perth Zoo, and formed part
of the collection that I brought home.
The sea-shore was within two or three miles of 11s, and

one afternoon we walked over to it, crossing moor-land covered
with a kind of heather and low scrub. We found two Stump-
tailed Lizards which went into our pockets. An Australian
Bustard or so-called Wild Turkey (. Eupodotis australis ) was seen
flying over the moor and settled some distance from us. With
my field-glasses I watched the bird closely, and could see that he
was also watching us, as he kept perfectly still with head raised
in the air. My companion endeavoured to stalk him while I
remained where I was. Needless to say the bird rose and dis-
appeared long before my friend was within gun shot. These
magnificent birds are getting very scarce as everyone tries to
shoot them for " the pot." But every year a few visit this neigh-
bourhood about midsummer to feed on the myriads of grass-
hoppers. The Short-tailed Wallaby abounds here, and their
tracks through the scrub and on the sand of the sea-shore run in
every direction. A pair of Brown Hawks came sailing out to-
wards the sea as we stood on the beach.
The evening before we left this neighbourhood we went
for a row along the Margaret River. By the footpath close to
the river I noticed several Sacred Kingfishers ( Halcyon sa?icta).
The river banks were steep and wooded on one side, and quite a
number of "Squeakers" accompanied us along the river bank
uttering loud cries as if in protest at our appearance. White-
fronted Herons (Ardea novcz-hollandicz ) were numerous along the
margin of the stream and rose at our approach ; and overhead a
pair of Wedge-tailed Eagles {Aquila audax) floated on motionless
pinions.
Early in the morning of January 28th we left on our return
to Perth. During the drive of some 35 miles to Basselton we saw
several interesting birds. Parties of Pileated Parrakeets, called
in this district " King Parrots," were often seen as they dashed
through the forests and "Twenty-Eights" were everywhere.
The Western form of the White-backed Piping Crow was quite
common, and we saw several Wedge-tailed Eagles. One large
party of Purple-crowned Lorikeets ( Glossopsittaais porphyroce-
phaius ) passed over us, uttering the cries so peculiar to Lorikeets
of all kinds ; but, like those we saw near the Mammoth Cave,
they were as " wild as hawks," dashing away when I walked
towards the tree into which we saw them go.

Near Basselton I saw a bird which I had been constantly
on the look ont for since my arrival in these parts, namely the
Ma turns pulcherrimus, the beautiful Bine Wren peculiar to
Western Australia. It was a male in full plumage, from head to
tail of different shades of blue and purple, and was hopping
about the grass on the road side as we approached. This species
is very much rarer than its relative of the Eastern States.
The last day of my stay in Western Australia was chiefly
spent at the Museum, where the Director, Mr. Bernard H.
Woodward was most kind in showing me the fine collection of
Western Australian fauna. Mr. A. W. Milligan, who probably
knows the birds of this State better than anyone else, also kindly
met me there and pointed out the birds of special interest.
On January 30th I set sail on the R.M.S. "Orontes" for
Adelaide.

Dr. Butler's articles 011 Foreign Birds which have been
appearing for some time in Canary and Cage Bird Life have
doubtless been read by most of our members, who have probably
long since discovered their value and looked forward to the time
when they should be republished in a permanent form. Part I
has now appeared in the form of a handsome volume of 205
closely printed pages, in which the author treats of about 400
species, from the Thrushes to the Weavers, describing their
plumage, habits, food, and general management in captivity.
This book will be found of the greatest service to all
aviculturists, the author's wide knowledge of birds, both from the
strictly ornithological and the avicultural standpoints, having
been used to produce a most reliable and exhaustive treatise.
There are many text illustrations, the majority of which

are good, though a few of these might with advantage have been
omitted ; and the value of the book is much enhanced, by the
addition of an index to scientific names. There is however na

omission, as the majority of aviculturists know their birds only
by these.
BIRD MIGRATION.
The Committee appointed by the British Ornithologists'&amp;apos;
Club, to investigate the difficult subject of the immigration of
birds to these islands, are doing some very valuable work.
During the migration periods, observers in all parts of the United
Kingdom regularly send in their Reports week&amp;apos;by week, of the
arrival of migrants, and Reports are also received, by permission
of the Master and Elder Brethren of Trinity House, from the
various lighthouses round the coast. The information thus
obtained is worked out and tabulated bv the Ornithologists who
form the Committee.
The Third Report of the Committee, which forms Volume
XXII. of the Bulletin of the British Ornithologists&amp;apos; Club (Witherbv
&amp; Co., price 6/-) is now to hand, and deals with the Spring
immigration of 1907.
The season was somewhat exceptional, wintry weather
being experienced throughout April, after a fine and warm spell
in the latter part of March. The migration was therefore un-
usually late, being at its height in the first half of May. On the
15th of that month the largest and most important immigra-
tion of the season was recorded at St. Catherine's Lighthouse
in the Isle of Wight when individuals of no less than eighteen
different species killed themselves against the lantern.
The species are dealt with separately in the report, and
maps are published showing the dates of arrival at various
points. A chapter is added at the end on the Autumn move-
ments of migrants in 1906.

the harmful and the useful species of birds. "Hawks" and
Owls have a bad time of it in almost all parts of the civilized
world, until the farmer is forced to recognise that plagues of
voles, rats and mice are the direct result of the indiscriminate
slaughter of his best friends, the birds that alone can keep them
in check. Moreover persecution is augmented by foolish super-
stition, the Boers looking upon the Barn Owl as a bird of ill-
omen, the popular belief being that if one of these birds screeches
on a house top at night one of the inhabitants is sure to die soon.
The same superstition being also applied to other species of Owls.
The pamphlet before us is issued by the Bird Protection
Committee of the South African Ornithologists' Union, the
author being Mr. Alwin Haagner, the Hon. Secretary of that
Union. For convenience the author divides the birds of prey
into two groups : Nocturnal (Owls), and Diurnal (Hawks, Fal-
cons, Kestrels, Buzzards, Kites, &amp;c.) The Owls are, with hardly
an exception, extremely useful and harmless, and the very best
friends of the farmer. Of the large group of Diurnal Birds of Prey
the author points out which species are useful and which are
harmful.
THE EMU.
The October number of our Australian contemporary con-
tains an instructive article by Mr. A. H. E. Mattingley on the
habits of the Uowan or Mallee Hen (Lipsa ocellata ), one of those
interesting megapodes or mound-builders characteristic of the
Australian region. The author describes the bird's habitat, the
curious habit of constructing mounds, partly composed of
decomposing vegetation, by the fermentation of which the eggs
are incubated, and traces the bird's curious nesting habits back to
its reptilian ancestors.

DESTRUCTION OF BIRD LIFE AT LIGHTHOUSES.

Sir, --The terrible destruction of bird life against the Lighthouses in
the migratory season is sad to contemplate, and yet, I suppose, nothing can
be done, or surely it would have been done before this. Is it known to
many of onr members, I wonder, that tens of thousands of birds of all kinds
meet their death against one lighthouse alone during the year? St.
Catherine's (Isle of Wight) and Heligoland being particularly fatal. I have
seen literally heaps of them brought in to onr clever naturalist and taxider-
mist here, Mr. Bristow, for a few specimens to be " set up " for collections.
Only yesterday he showed me Meadow Pipits, Gold-crests, Wagtails, White-
throats, Wheatears, Redstarts, Garden Warblers, Blackcaps, Grasshopper
Warblers, Nightingales, Willow Wrens, Chiffchaffs, besides any amount of
Blackbirds, Thrushes, Swallows, Robins, and sea birds of all sorts, indeed
almost every wild bird one could name. Eight}&amp;apos;- had been brought in that
morning alone, all in faultless plumage and condition.
Bird-trappers'destruction is jnst a drop in the ocean compared with
this wholesale slaughter. I understand netting has been tried, but the
swiftness of flight still renders the impact fatal. I did not understand,
however, if it were wire or string netting, which latter might possibly make
all the difference in the world. I should be glad if this appeal would arouse
the sympathy and desire to help onr feathered friends, I myself feel, among
our members. E. A. H. HARl&amp;apos;r.iCY.

Sir, -- I have been much interested by Mr. Pocock's article in the

of describing the mating of a cock Globose Curassow and a hen Heck's
Curassow? For even if we grant that they are very nearly allied, they are
at all events distinguished as distinct species, and such a heading is
most misleading, apart from its inaccuracy.

<bodyText confidence="0.884163411764706" page_id="32659658"  page_num="82" year="" vol="">
Sir, --Just about ten weeks ago a hen Rifle-Bird, just arrived from
New Guinea, escaped from its cage, was seen for a few days about and then
disappeared, and we all made up our minds it was dead.
Last night I had a telephone message from a keen naturalist, who
lives at Langton, a village two miles away, to say that a strange bird had
been brought to her, and asking if we had lost one. It had dashed against
the Vicarage window and so had been caught. I told her of this Rifle Bird,
but thought it was impossible it could be the lost bird. However, from her
description it sounded so like it that I sent up and had the bird brought
down. It was the lost lieu Rifle-Bird in ver}&amp;apos; fair condition though a little
weak and dazed. This morning it appears perfectly well although rather thin.
We have had ip of frost, and cold wet nights, and for ten weeks this
bird has lived in the woods and is apparently none the worse. After this I
think we over coddle our Paradise Birds, and next year I believe they
could be wintered in a cold avairy without heat. This bird was freshly
imported and had been caged for mouths before it escaped.

A STANLEY CRANE.
By Mrs. Gregory.
I have lately bought a very beautiful and extremely tame
Stanley Crane. As soon as he arrived and was let out of the
travelling crate he began to dance with joy and spring up in the
air with his bill wide open. He seemed delighted with his new
home, and soon went straight to the pond and bathed. Then he
made friends with the other birds and wisely gives way to the
Crowned Crane, who always has and always will " rule the roost "
--thus peace is maintained.
From the first the Stanley attached himself to me, and
very soon I could do anything I liked with him except induce
him to come into the house. Full of suspicion, he would stand
on the door mat peering in, but no further would he venture.
So I waited until he had sufficient confidence to follow me in of
his own accord, and now he will walk from room to room after
me, like a dog. He is full of curiosity, as most Cranes are, and
touches the furniture, curtains, etc. with his bill. Silver orna-
ments interest him, and he can never resist pulling my thimble
off my finger, or carrying off scissors if I am sewing. I think the
Stanley is the gentlest of all the Cranes. At the same time he
likes to try to frighten strangers by rushing at them with wings
outspread and sometimes pecking their shoes.
He is a tall bird, about 4ft. 6in. in height, the plumage of a
soft bluish grey shade, the top of the head is white, and the eyes
are large, dark, and expressive. The lanceolate feathers on the
breast are the same colour as the body, unlike those of the
Demoiselle which are almost black. I am told that these Cranes

require a little meat sometimes, but I cannot get mine to eat any.
I feed him on grain, equal quantities of wheat, dari, and husk
rice, and less of maize. At first he ate worms but now does not
care for them and only searches for insects. At night he sleeps
in a comfortable shed, separated by a wire door from my Crowned
Crane. At seven in the morning they are both let out.
The head of the Stanley Crane is very peculiar. The
feathers on it are short and thick and very close, and the bird
puffs them out when pleased or excited, and this gives the look
of a swollen head.
I have had some extremely tame Cranes, but none more so
than this one. I have even opened a window in the dusk and
called to him by name and he has answered each time with a
"cluck." Sometimes I hide in the garden and watch him
(unseen) searching for me, until he walks in triumph to the
shed or summer-house or wherever I may be. Then he is so
companionable! If I sit writing or reading he stands close by
my side preening or looking up at me until I say, "Now, Beu,
come for a walk," when he paces up and down the gravel walks,
following so closely that I sometimes feel his bill touching me.
Since I began to write this account my Stanley Crane has
been seized by a sudden and very violent illness, caused we think
by his having eaten something poisonous, probably found on a
large load of manure on which he had been searching for insects.
For nearly three days he took absolutely no food, only drank
water. His eyes were closed most of the time and his bill rested
on his breast. I felt I must make some effort to save him or he
would die from weakness. In vain I tried food of many kinds,
he would not open his bill, even for spiders. So, very gently,
I did it for him, at the same time, pushing in a live insect.
He took a large number and swallowed them all. Next day
he seemed a little stronger and less drowsy. I fed him every
few hours in the same way and occasionally gave well boiled
maize. Gradually I got his strength back until he could pick up
food for himself. The insects I gave were wood-lice, which I
was able to get in large quantities from a friend who has a small
pine wood in his grounds. He had some trees cut down and the

bark split off. Between the bark and the tree these creatures
were collected in hundreds, and I brought some of the pine
needles and bark away to keep them alive in. An old doctor
\0x25A0once told me that wood-lice contained iron, and years ago used
to be put into medicines for human beings. There must be some
special virtue in them, as this is the second Crane I have saved
by giving plenty just in time.
It was touching to see this dear bird trying to crawl after
me, but too weak to go above a few yards. Now, I am glad to be
able to say, he can once more flap his wings and preen his
feathers and walk up in his stately way to meet me at the garden
gate.

THE COACH-WHIP BIRD.
By Reginald Phillipps.

<bodyText confidence="0.974464045454545" page_id="32659667"  page_num="85" year="" vol="">
During the last few months, references to the Coach-whip
Bird (.Psophodes crepitans ) which is now at the Zoological Gardens
have appeared in various papers, all more or less inferring, some
positively stating, that it is the first living example of the species
that has reached this country. But such is not the case, for Mr.
Carrick had brought over a male six years previously, which
passed into my hands (per Mr. Hamlyn) on the day following its
arrival--on the 27th of May, 1902.
Judging by my specimen, the male, although it cannot
*stand undue exposure to cold, is a good liver, and is, by nature
and habits, well adapted to aviary life, at any rate during the
warmer months of the year. In a cage, it is thrown away and
quite out of place. According to my own experiences of the
two species, it is a far better liver than the Pied Grallina (Magpie
Lark), and yet, when I visited the Gardens this last summer, I
found the latter in an aviary and the former mewed up in a cage
in the hot New Birds' House. No wonder that the unhappj&amp;apos;
creature has never (so it is stated) been heard to utter its call !
The male Coach-whip Bird is a man of affairs, and passes
much of his time bustling about among the trees, or "digging
away" (to quote from my notes) on the ground in search of
insect life, &amp;c., very much to the benefit of his health and spirits.

Mr. Reginald Phillipps,
And I cannot help feeling strongly that the authorities at the
Zoological Gardens would have done better with their Whip Bird
if they had cautiously introduced it into one of the Western
Aviaries, or some other good-sized aviaiy with a sheltered portion
and a natural outdoor attachment; for, if properly managed, it
becomes a bold and impudent fellow ; and, as it has a good
supply of self assurance, it soon makes itself at home, and can
hold its own in the company of any ordinary large birds. Being
of local habits, it should not be moved about from place to place,
but should be left alone and allowed to settle down, so that its
natural ways may be brought out.
My Whip Bird arrived in excellent condition, saving a
slightly clipped wing, and was loosed into the birdroom, with
garden aviary attached, on June ist, and soon picked up full life
and vigour. If the Zoo. bird had been similarly treated during

the warm weather, supposing it to be a healthy specimen, it too
would have become developed in body and mind ; and the
comical way in which a good male suddenly pauses in the midst
of his many affairs, lifts up his head, opens his mouth, blows his
whistle, cracks his whip, and whacks his beast, would have
given huge delight to thousands of young people (for he is not
shy nor easily abashed)--and to many an old one too.
The Coach-whip Bird is mainly insectivorous, and obtains
most of its food on the ground. I was informed that, on the
voyage over, a little scraped raw meat was regularly given to my
bird ; but probably in captivity this species is better without it
when good insectivorous food is obtainable ; however, a little
scraped cooked meat (beef or mutton) is often of great value to a
bird of this kind. I noticed that my Whip Bird had a little
weakness for hunting any lame duck that might chance to be in
the aviary ; and I suspect that, in the wild state, it is not averse
to helping itself to a nestling, a mouse, and the like, when it
happens to light upon one in the bush. It is not a bird I should
care to trust in an aviary of small finches, or even with breeding
quails--the chicks would "mysteriously disappear," I expect.
My Whip Bird was first heard to utter his call, and that
pretty frequently, on June 16, three weeks after arrival, in the
early morning before we were up ; and, afterwards, it was so
commonly repeated as to cease to attract especial attention;
although it was always interesting to watch the bird while
uttering it--and of great interest to my neighbours on one side
who regarded him as a curiosity, but a cause of much grumbling
on the part of others who were systematically unamiable. His
favourite " coach road " was a bare pole or perch, some yards
long, and fixed up some 8ft. above the ground. My note runs:--
" He bustles about and then stops, raises head rather high,
\0x25A0opens his mouth, gives a whistle (sometimes high, sometimes
low), then a sudden shake or jerk of the head and out comes the
crack." The preliminary whistle would be prolonged for the
space of a good breath before the crack came, and usually was
on a moderately high note, but not infrequently on a much lower
one ; the mouth would be opened as wide as by a fledgeling
Thrush asking for food. There were occasional curious and
pleasing variations to the usual calls.

Captain G. A. Perreau,
It is a pity that a female has not been brought over, for, if
I may judge by my own male, it is a species that would readily
breed in a good-sized, natural, thickly wooded garden aviary ,-
and the question, if still a question, as to the part taken by the
female in the calls of these birds in the Australian bush would
be set at rest.
My poor bird met with a sad coach accident, from the
effects of which he died on the 20th January, 1904, after having
been with me little more than a year and a half. If it had not
been for this accident, there is no reason why he should not have
been alive now, for, as I have already remarked, at any rate the
male is a good liver--but beware of a too generous application
of the Fresh Air treatment, for it is possible for British weather
to be too bracing even for the Coach-whip Bird !

In the AviculUiral Magazine , Vol. III., New Series, page
366, I gave an account of my small aviaries, and promised a
further account of my new aviaries which were just completed
at that time.
The accompanying plan and elevations will, I hope, explain
the general idea. Our house is square, facing south, with a
verandah all round it. Portions of the verandah have been con-
verted into the rooms, dressing rooms, See. The ground falls
away to the South-East. The main Bakloh ridge runs North and
South on the West, near enough and high enough to give shelter
from storms without shutting off the evening sun. A spur runs
down close behind the aviary on the north side. The house
shelters the aviary on the East. So it can be seen that the posi-
tion is almost ideal in a place where storms and cold are more
to be feared than heat. The climate I have mentioned before,
but would like to add that the winter, cold as it is, is far more
favourable to aviculture than the English one; we are not often
long without sun.
The aviary was added by me to the house with the idea
that it could be turned into an office room when I leave. I expect

that future generations will wonder at the door and window
arrangements. It is a span-roof building fitting into the West
roof of the house and is as large as possible, having due regard
to the light and " breeze ways " of the house. I should have
liked another six feet at least in length to givens another aviary,
but had to cut away a good bit of khud as it was. The verandah
is apt to drip in bad weather in a couple of places owing to the
slight slope, not enough to worry about. I am a great believer in
getting as much verandah space as possible.
Referring to the plan (see separate plate), A. A. A. are small
windows a foot square, about 4ft. off the ground. B. is a 6ft. by

out-door flights at the back, but the space was unsuitable and I
feared draught. D. is a glass window (see Figs. I. and III).

The remaining four foot opens as a door and is usually kept shut

hinged down the middle so as not to obstruct the view into the
aviary verandah when left open, as it generally is by day.

Captain G. A. PkrrKAU,
G. G. are aviary cages (see Figs. I. and III.) four in
number, in two tiers. Each has a door 2ft. by 2ft. 6in. high, in
the bottom of which is a 6iu. high door to allow safe feeding,
There was a large door between each pair, but this was taken
away as it was such a nuisance having to go into the Parrakeet
shelter to feed birds in the far aviary cages. The floor of the top *
tier is of zinc sheets fixed on 1 in. planks.
H. is a set of shelves 6 by i# by 8ft. high, which I had j
used previously as shelves and cages. The two bottom shelves
are still used as shelves, the remaining top ones form cages i^ft.
high, each of which can be partitoued into three. The top of the
top shelf is covered with zinc and the space above is at the
disposal of the birds in the Finch aviary.
Corners more or less cosy are formed by boarding in the
near corner of the Finch aviary and the far corner of the
Parrakeet aviary, and a foot wide plank runs along the top of the
aviary cages (see figures).
There are two small 6in. square openings in the wall on
the ground level between the verandah and the shelter. The
idea was that these openings would be useful for ground birds,
odd cripples or young, but they are a bit too small.
Shelves (gin. at sides and i2iu. at end) cover all available
wall space of store-room.

don't touch " is the Sahib's request. Much of the rubbish there
is the result of much labour, logs and odd bits of wood for nest-
boxes, experimental cages and traps, &amp;c. The chair is com-
fortable enough to laze in, but solid enough to sit on while doing-
carpentry (?) odds and ends, cages, nest-boxes, &amp;c. A stout
empty box gives me a useful carpenters' bench. A small
moveable table, close at hand here for books, writing material,
&amp;c., completes the watching portion of the aviary, to my mind
almost the most important part, indirectly at any rate. The bow-
window in the drawing-room is useful in cold weather orto watch
new or shy birds.
Seed in bulk, chiefly millet, is stored against the wall.
The table by the old aviary has a shelf underneath, and is most
useful for putting out things to be cleaned and for the servants to
leave eggs, vegetable, &amp;c., for insect food which I mix. A tin for
rubbish to be thrown away is by the table, also two large water
cans to be kept filled. The bliisti cleans and refills the water
dishes every morning, and the tap is just along the walk past the
walnut tree, but I find wateris often wanted for odd jobs, hence
the filled cans.
The old aviary I have already described, so I think I have
gone all over the ground outside the aviaries proper; "live food "
breeding may be touched on later, also vermin.
The ground under the covered portion is stone flagged.
The walls are stone masonry ijft. thick. The roof is of 1 in.
pine planks, covered with iron sheets, painted. Gutters carry off
the rain and snow water. Verandah posts are of wood (painted)
set in stone. Uprights in the flight are of wood about qin.by 3m.
let into the ground ; they are tarred below and painted above
ground. Similar uprights are fixed against the walls about 4ft.
apart. I have fastened cross pieces on these where required, and
have found them most useful for fixing up branches, nest-boxes,
&amp;c. I have seen aviaries condemned by authorities as being too
woody. Of course iron looks nice and is more permanent, but
wood is much more " amenable" for those who do odd jobs about
the aviary themselves, and mite is not much to be feared in
aviaries.

wooden frames to take off when glass requires cleaning. A
foot plank runs along the bottom where cats could do damage.
Where the ground is not masonry round the outside of the flight,
there are attached to the bottom of this plank L-shaped pieces of
perforated zinc i8in. down and i8in.out. The ditch thus formed *
is filled with stones to help drainage. Wire netting would have
been cheaper and equally efficient as a protection against under-
ground vermin.

Buffalo, N.Y., we are in possession of facts concerning the disaster.
On the morning of March 14th, a flock of some 300 or 400 Swans
( Olor. columbianus), rare migrant along Niagara River, lit upon
the upper reaches of the river, probably attracted by the open
water. All day the birds remained on the river, numbers of
them at times could be seen floating down the river, carried
along by the current until the proximity of the cataract caused
them to rise and fly back to a place of safety. The day following
(March 15th) was stormy, rain and thunder at intervals. The
birds appeared in distress, and not being able to obtain food,,
added to the constant exertion necessary to keep them out of
danger no doubt weakened them. Shortly before noon, a work-
man who was engaged in removing some lumber from the ice-
bridge, was startled by a loud cry. Turning around he saw a
Swan struggling at the upper edge of the ice-bridge, but on look-
ing towards the Falls he saw a great mass of struggling Swans in
!

evident distress being swept by the current and floating ice to-
wards the bridge. Helpless after their terrible plunge over the
Canadian Falls the unfortunate birds were indeed in a terrible
plight. Many had been killed outright, many others badly
injured were unable to recover themselves, they were prisoners
and, conscious of their helplessness, their cries were heart-rend-
ing. Soon the news of the catastrophe spread, the Game Laws of
Ontario permitted the taking of Swans until April 30th, and it
was not long until men and boys, armed with guns and sticks,
hastened to the scene and rapidly completed--as Mr. Savage
says--the closing scene of nature's great tragedy--the sacrifice
of the Swans. The number of Swans taken on March 13th was
102; the following day some more were taken, only about 15a
yards from the Horse-shoe Falls. On the 22nd, twelve more came
over the Falls, nearly all of these were captured, three were seen
to rise from the broken waters between the base of the Falls and
the ice-bridge and fly back over the Falls into the river.
It was thought that several of the birds would have re-
covered had they been left alone, but the destruction was com-
pleted by the watchers on the shore-line. Mr. Savage secured
one specimen in a stunned condition, which he sent to the Zoo in
Buffalo, where under the care of the Curator it finally recovered,
and is now a celebrated specimen, at home on the placid waters
of Park Lake.
Mr. Fleming secured thirty-three specimens which he care-
fully measured, adding the sterna to his collection. An exami-
nation of the Swans showed that several had broken wings, others
had clavicles dislocated, and oneortwo had the sternum crushed,
while iu a number the lungs were markedly congested.
The birds were iu good condition, but the stomachs were
empty. The weights varied from 12 to 18 lbs. Many were first
year birds, while some were very old. One specimen, a female,
and not the largest, measured 51^ inches in length and 81 inches
from tip to tip of its extended wings. A friend writing me from
Buffalo informs me that to his knowledge 152 birds were taken.
The total weight of the victims exceeded one ton.
It was a matter of much regret that no effort was made to
protect or aid the unfortunate victims : it is reasonable to believe
that many might have been rescued.

Dr. A. G. Butler,
The birds were reported as ' good eating,' that was the
final judgment that ' overcame ' and completed the doom of the
birds. Each year, from the middle to the end of March, a
number of Swans are washed over the Falls. In 1906, sixteen ;
1907, six ; and in this tragedy, 1908, one hundred and fifty-two.

THE SOFT PARTS OF THE BLUE-NAPED COLY.

<bodyText confidence="0.985024233333333" page_id="32659678"  page_num="94" year="" vol="">
By Dr. A. G. Butler.
Of the various species of Colies or Mouse-birds the follow-
ing have hitherto been imported as cage birds: C. slriatus, C.
7 iigricollis, C. leucotis , C. castanonotus , C. colius , C. erythromelon ,
and C. macrurus.
When reading up the different published accounts respect-
ing the wild life of the last-mentioned :-- C. macrurus, I was
struck by the many dissimilar descriptions of the colouring of
the soft parts; and it has made me wonder whether, as in the
case of the little Passerine Dove, these differences may not have
local significance and indicate the first steps towards the sub-
division of this species or, in other words, represent what are
now regarded as subspecies.
I think it would be interesting, if one could secure a good
series of specimens from different parts of its range, to see
whether there was not some other local difference either in the
shades of the plumage, the size of the blue spots on the nape, or
the various measurements, which would support this view.
Aviculturists at home are not in a position to settle this
point; for I believe the Blue-naped Coly has hitherto only reached
the Zoological Gardens of Amsterdam and Copenhagen (unless
Mr. A. L. Butler has sent home living examples recently), but
curators in Museums might, with a little trouble, secure good
series from the various collectors in Northern and Western Africa
and so settle an interesting question.
The description of the soft parts of C. macrurus in the British
Museum " Catalogue of Birds " is that given by Von Heuglin,
who appears to have secured his specimens at Khartoum; it
runs: "Feet rosy crimson, the soles bluish yellow; iris and
orbital ring crimson."

I have not the remotest notion what "bluish yellow" can
mean, unless it means green. Heuglin says " coerulescente-
flavidis" which is a trifle more vague.
In an article describing an Expedition to the White Nile
(. Ibis, 1901, p. 264) Mr. H. F. Witherby thus describes the soft
parts:--"Iris red; bill--upper mandible pinkish red with black
tips ; legs and feet purple ; orbits bare, lake-red." In the same
volume Mr. A. E. Pease (p. 670) says: " Iris brown, naked skin
round eye dark red ; bill red at base, black at the tip : legs dull
red."
The following year (Ibis, 1902, p. 42S) Mr. R. Me. D.
Hawker says " Iris hazel ; bill red, black at tip, legs and feet
purplish red."
I11 1906 Mr. J. Jackson "On birds collected during a
journey to the Ruwenzori Range" (Ibis, p.522) thus describes
the soft parts :--" Iris crimson ; bill coral, tip and lower mandible
black ; bare patch round eye plum-coloured ; feet heliotrope-
coloured."
Combining these descriptions we learn that, in life, this
Coly has the bill with the upper mandible red, blackish horn at
base and tip, lower mandible black ( Heuglin) ; "upper mandible
pinkish-red with black tip, lower mandible black ( Witherby) ;
"red at base, black at tip" (Pease and Hawker ) ; " coral, tip and
lower mandible black " (Jackson); feet "rosy crimson with bluish
yellowish soles" (Heuglin&amp;apos;)-, "purple" (Witherby)-, "dull red"
(Pease) ; " purplish-red " ( Hawku &amp;apos;) ; " heliotrope " (Jackson) ; iris
" crimson " (Heuglin) ; " red " ( Witherby') ; " brown " (Pease) ;
"hazel" (Hazvker); "crimson" (Jackson)-, orbital naked patch
"crimson" (Heziglin); "lake red" (Witherby)-, "dark red"
(Pease); plum-coloured" (Jackson.)
With all this apparent inconstancy of colouring in the soft
parts it would be somewhat perplexing for a taxidermist to stuff
a specimen correctly, for exhibition in a Museum ; or for an
artist who had to prepare a coloured plate of the species. All
the above naturalists describe with authority, from birds before
them in the flesh; and though we may allow a little latitude for
varying conceptions of colour, it would be absuid to suppose
that the same bill could be described by one man as pinkish-red

Mr. H. E. Attewell,
and by another as coral-red ; that the feet should be called by
one man rosy-crimson, by another purple, by a third purplish
red, and by a fourth heliotrope; that the same iris should be
described variously as crimson, red, brown, and hazel ; or the
same orbital ring as crimson, lake-red, dark-red, and plum-
coloured, though perhaps this last might be possible.
Therefore, as I said before, there seems here to be evidence
that C. macrurus possesses certain local races differing in the
colouring of the soft parts, and it is quite possible that other
characters may be discovered by which they may hereafter be
distinguished, if a sufficient number of specimens from all parts
of the range can be compared. I think it quite likely that the
size of the beak may vary in the races, as it does in the species;
but it must be borne in mind that this difference occurs also
between the sexes.

THE 'MOSQUITO HAWK' OR JAMAICA

Because of its complete unsuitability for confinement of any
kind I fear the Magazine readers' interest in my subject will
*consequently be small. My notes have the merit of freshness,
however, of being quite recently made, therefore I pass them on.
The ' Give-me-me-bit ' does not stop to explain what ' bit '
it is demanding. I take it to be a matter of fourpence half-penny !
The old fold in Jamaica will tell you that, say eighty years ago,
when Spanish silver was current here and larger coins more
plentiful than small, these bigger ones were cut with shears and
the pieces called ' bits.' Though no longer seen nor current,
reckonings, particularly amongst the country folk, still include
the ' bit.'

book on Ornithology would tell. I therefore refer any curious
to such an extent to a Natural History. A gully here (Jamaica)
famous for its Green Todies, has, amongst its other habitues, a
number of ' Give-me-me-bits,' that is during their stay in Jamaica.
At the proper season, say June or July, one may come across the
bird's domestic arrangements.
On June 14th, and of course on the bare ground, somewhat
higher than the ground around, yet still in the gully bed, which
but ten days earlier was in full flood, I surprised a ' Give-me-me-
bit.' Clumsily rising from a yard or so before me she alighted,
maybe fifteen yards distant and, although so near, an inex-
perienced eye would not have easily detected her, so well does
the bird's coloration and its studied deshabille lend to the shade
of soil and trash around. With ruffled plumage and extended
wings the bird felt satisfied no doubt of its own security and also
its egg. This, after some search, I was pleased to find. When
found one at first wonders why the search has been in any way
difficult. It is at the same time conspicuous and the reverse.
A11 object of great beauty lying on the bare soil and withal a
pebble! Either end of the egg is equally obtusely rounded, and
it is somewhat larger than an average domestic pigeon's egg. It
resembles a variety of marble, a polished mottled grey. Now
the native belief or superstition around the handling of a Mos-
quito Hawk's egg is
' Tek (take) up liegg, tele up trouble,
Put it down, put down you (your) luck.'
I did not know this at the time. A dilemma is suggested anyway.
A pair of Barbary Doves found themselves 'up a tree'
eleven days later. I carried home this egg and, distributing the
evil consequences, placed it in their nest. The egg was most
indifferently brooded aud I feared. One bird--the hen--being
naturally a little shortsighted covered it each night, but the cock
being (also naturally) more sagacious, appeared less ready to lend
support to the general scheme. He seemed to like it beside him
rather than beneath him. Sure enough, however, after eleven
days of these proceedings there was the new baby !
Its feeding was as great a problem to me as to the foster-
parents. The foster mother protested when asked to give up her

child, while her better half, with the superior wisdom already
referred to, seemed to look 011 with enjoyment at the thought of
the 'picnic' somebody was going to have over that baby. Eighty-
eight grains was that baby's weight. Eighty-eight grains of
liveliness and loveliness, quite blind yet able to make sundry
little shuffling runs. The bird's down, in colour, being a sandy
grizzle, would even better harmonize with its natural surround-
ings than would either old bird or egg. For two days, and with
some difficulty, we kept the little stowawa_v going with moths;
then the inevitable happened.
Dusk is the time when ' Give-me-me-bits ' are mostly in
evidence, and there must be singular aberration somewhere.
Noctural birds usually seek darkened resorts for repose and nidi-
fication do they not? Like some others of his kin, the ' Give-
me-me-bit' differs, yet who can understand the reason for such
an opposite extreme? Instead of the shade and darkness with
consequent comparative cool this bird seeks the very hottest site
for incubating and also the most exposed. The glare and heat
reflected from such a situation as is usually chosen are enough to
blind the sitting bird and cook the egg. A thermometer laid on
the ground beside them would no doubt register upwards of i20 y
Fahrenheit. Does the bird cover the egg by day to keep it cool ?
When disturbed while so engaged I have known the ' Give-me-
me-bit ' to take wing and, flying to and fro, to swoop immediately
overhead, making behind one such a startling whirr as to make a
nervous native almost justifiably superstitious, a whirr such as a
pheasant makes.
Not the least extraordinary habit of this bird is that of
choosing a conspicuous (yet inconspicuous again) roosting place ;
conspicuous when once noticed but only then. For some days a
forked branch of a lignum vitce tree, about nine feet from the
ground and but slightly oblique, nor more than xjin. in diameter
was the sleeping place of one in our garden. Quite aware of one's
presence, the Mosquito Hawk made no other movement than to
blink his big eyes, a butterfly net would have captured him quite
easily.

AMERICA.
By Hubert D. Astley, M.A.
During a visit which I paid to the United States in
September and October, I received a very warm, courteous and
kindly welcome from some of the best known and most enthu-
siastic naturalists and ornithologists, notably, Professor H.
Fairfield Osborn who is the Head of the New York Natural
History Museum and Zoological Park; Mr. C. William Beebe, a
member of our Society and Curator of the collection of living
birds at the Zoological Park ; Mr. Chapman a well-known writer
of ornithological works, who is also at the Natural History
Museum, and others.
I can never forget the kindness of these gentlemen, and
the trouble they took in writing to me, not once but several
times, in order to ensure their welcome to me being a certain
one, in spite of each and all being busy men, who could ill-afford
the time they sacrificed for my benefit.
I was anxious to obtain and carry away a Hermit Thrush,
and on writing to Mr. Beebe about it, he immediately answered
to the effect that not only would he be delighted to present me
with some, but that he would also give me other species.
It ended in my bringing home the following Thrushes:
Hermit&amp;apos;s, Wilson's, Wood Thrushes and Migratory Thrushes,
which latter are far better known as ' Robins.' They, along with
some Blue Birds, Baltimore Orioles and Rose-breasted Grosbeaks,
were brought down to the docks by the head-keeper [Mr. Stacey,
an Englishman] with an ample supply of food for the voyage,
and safely deposited on board the floating Hotel, the Lusitania,
These North American Thrushes are far tamer than our English
Thrushes would be under similar circumstances, for the day 7 after
I reached home, one of the Wilson's and a Hermit were hopping
about my bird-room as if they had been there all their lives,
coming to me to take a mealworm from my fingers, and splashing
in a bath close to my feet. They are wild-caught birds, and in
beautiful condition.

Mr. Hubert D. Asteey,
larger than a well grown Nightingale, being 6.7 inches in total
length. A dainty-looking bird ; a true aristocrat. Its shape and
demeanour, as well as its upper colouring, remind one strongly of
our famous songster, but the throat and breast are spotted as in
our Song Thrush.
This bird has the singular habit of raising its tail, which is
in proportion longer and more slender than that of our Song
Thrush, and allowing it to fall slowly back into its natural
position, which movement generally follows the act of perch-
ing. It is, like the Thrushes of North America, migratory;
breeding from the northern United States northwards, and being
well-known in the eastern United States; then moving south.
A few winter even as far north as the Hudson River.
Mr. John Burroughs in his charming book 'Wake-Robin,'
gives a very beautiful description of its song. He observed the
bird especially in the Adirondac Mountains. He writes:--
"Ever since I entered the woods, even while listening to the

" lesser songsters, or contemplating the silent forms about me,
" a strain has reached my ears from out of the depths of the
" forest that to me is the finest sound in nature--the song of the
" Hermit Thrush.
" I often hear him thus a long way off, sometimes over a
"quarter of a mile away, when only the stronger and more per-
fect parts of his music reach me; and through the chorus of
" Wrens and Warblers I detect this sound rising pure and serene,
"as if a spirit from some remote height were slowly chanting a
" divine accompaniment.
" This song appeals to the sentiment of the beautiful in me,
"and suggests a serene religious beatitude as 110 other sound in
" nature does. It is perhaps more of an evening than a morning
"hymn, though I hear it at all hours of the day.
"It is very simple, and I can hardly tell the secret of its
" charm. ' O spheral, spheral! ' he seems to say ; ' O holy, holy !
" O clear away, clear away ! O clear up, clear up ! ' interspersed
" with the finest trills and most delicate preludes. It is not a
" proud gorgeous strain like the Scarlet Tauager's or the Rose-
" breasted Grosbeak's; suggests no passion or emotion--nothing
" personal--but seems to be the voice of that calm sweet solemnity

" one attains to in liis best moments. It realises a peace and a
" deep solemn joy that only the finest sonls may know."
Mr. Nehrliug writes:--"The highly interesting Hermit
" Thrush might be called the ' May-Blossom ' of our birds. Its
" charms are manifold, but the enthusiastic observer and lover
"of birds is rarely able to penetrate the solitude of its swampy
" northern woodland home."
Dr. Hatch, in his 'Birds of Minnesota,'observes:--"My
" earliest personal observation of the time of its arrival in the
" vicinity of where I reside was April 5, 1875. It seldom sings
"immediately after its arrival, but in due time those which
" remain to build nests overflow with the ebullition of fervid
" melodies.
" I have often listened to the delicious notes, which in my
" ear are in no way inferior to those of the Wood-Thrush. I am
" not surprised that those who have heard him for the first time
"should be ready to exalt him higher than the other in the scale
of song, when I remember the associations amid which they are
" found.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.900346842105263" page_id="32659685"  page_num="101" year="" vol="">
"The silence, the delicious solitude of this clioristry under-
" neatli the shadows of the grand leaf-canopied forest, awaken
" feelings, sentiments, and inspirations, eminently calculated to
" lend enchantment to his liquid silvery bell-toned notes."
The nest of the Hermit Thrush is always built 011 the
ground, another connection of similitude to the habits of our
Nightingale, generally under low bushes in swampy places.
American ornithologists are inclined to the idea that this
bird's song is, in its own peculiar way, not inferior to that of the
Nightingale. There is one interesting fact to remember with
regard to the songs of the North American birds compared with
those ot Europe, which is that whilst many are continuous in
their strains, the great majority of their American cousins sing
in separated strophes, with very distinct pauses between each
one.
It remains to be proved whether the graceful and charming
little Hermit Thrush will live well in captivity or not.
Wilson's Thrush ( Turdus fuscesccns ) known also as " The
Veery," and the " Tawny Thrush " is very much like the Hermit

Mr. Hubkrt D. Astrry,
in shape, size, and demeanour, but may be recognised by its grey
flanks and uniform tawny-brown, or russet-brown colour, the
tail being of the same tint as the back. The throat is pale buff
with very light dusky spots. 1
Its summer quarters are in the Eastern United States,
extending beyond the frontier into British North America. It ,
goes north to Hudson's Bay, and west to the Saskatchewan.
It is, with the exception of the American Robin, the commonest
of the Thrushes in Southern New England during the season.
It enters Connecticut about the last week of April, and reaches
Massachusets early in May.
Some of Mr. Nelirling's notes are as follows :--"According
"to my experience the Veery is shy and circumspect, more re-
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9016929" page_id="32659686"  page_num="102" year="" vol="">
" tiring and fonder of solitude than the Wood-Thrush, and con-
sequently rarer in woods often frequented by man. As a rule
" it is found in the deepest seclusion. It chooses for its haunts
"and nesting place more swampy and damper spots than its
"congener, the Wood-Thrush.
" It is always found in the neighbourhood of water, either ;
"close to a rushing rivulet, wandering under thick shrubbery,
" near a thick gurgling spring or a pond. In the sunlight falling
" through the high trees myriads of mosquitoes, gnats, and other
" water-loving insects hover. The whole forest ground is covered
" with old completely moss-grown logs which have almost turned
"to soil. One sinks almost to the knees into the decomposing
" mass, which is the very life-spring of the rich plant-growth.
" In this silent solitude the Veery must be sought, if the friend
" of nature and especially of bird-life would make its acquaint-
ance. The Veery is one of the most exquisite songsters of its
" forest solitude. It is in truth a rival of the Hermit, the Olive- j
" back, and the Wood-Thrush. One hardly knows to which to
" award the palm. In many respects the Veery's song reminds
" one of the Wood-Thrush, but it is not so loud and flute-like,
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9611286" page_id="32659686"  page_num="102" year="" vol="">
"and seems to be more modulated. The bird sings so diligently,
"that it is often heard long after sunset. Hence in some places
"in New England this bird has been called the ' Nightingale.'"
The song has been described as consisting of an inexpres-
sibly delicate metallic utterance of the syllables ta-weel'ah,.

ta-weel'ali, twil'ah, twil'ah, "accompanied by a.fine trill wliich
rendered it truly seductive."
The Wood Thrush (T. vmstelimis). I fancy I am correct
in saying that the Hermit Thrush and the ' Veery ' have not been
represented in the Regent's Park Zoological collection for some
time ; but not very long ago, four or five Wood Thrushes were
sent over with a collection of other birds of the United States,
and at least two of these pretty Thrushes are still alive.
They are easily distinguished by the foxy-red colour of the
upper surface, especially 011 the crown of the head and nape of
the neck, and by the black spotting on the sides of the body, the
whole of the ground work of the underparts, from throat to vent,
being very white. It inhabits the Eastern United States to the
Plains, north to Ontario and Massachusets, south in winter to
Guatemala and Cuba.
It breeds from Virginia and Kentucky, northwards. In
captivity this Thrush seems to be remarkably tame, hopping close
to one in the aviary, and quickly making itself at home.
For a description of this pretty Thrush in its wild state, I
must again avail myself of Mr. Nehrling's work on North
American Birds, where he writes:--
" It is found chiefly in low damp woodlands which are
" thickly covered with undergrowth, and prefers for settlement
"the shady interior to the noisy and busy neighbourhood of man.
" Here one can hear the wonderful, harmonious, flute-like song
" from early dawn until the fall of the evening twilight.
"In the mountains of North Carolina and elsewhere, it
" loves to nest in the grand evergreen rhododendrons. The Wood
"Thrush rarely appears in its northern home before the middle
"of May--often some days later--at the time when the first

Mr. Hubert D. Asteey,
"and pleasing characteristics. No lover of sweet sounds can
"have failed to notice it, and, having once known its source, no
"one can fail to recognise it when heard again. The melody is
"one of great sweetness and power, and consists of several parts,
" the last note of which resembles the tinkling of a small bell,
" and seems to leave the conclusion suspended. Each part of its
"song seems sweeter and richer than the preceding."
The nest of this Thrush is a firm compact structure,
chiefly composed of decaying deciduous leaves, closely packed
together. They are strengthened by an intermingling of a few
dry twigs, and the whole is lined with fine roots and dry grasses *
sometimes mud is used for the intermediate lining.
In my aviaries this Thrush moves about on the ground in
a very similar manner to the English Song Thrush, cocking its
head on one side to listen for the movements of a worm and then
hopping off to repeat the same manoeuvre elsewhere. It is
smaller than our bird, being 7.5 inches in total length.
It is curious that those birds which are tamest and most
confiding in their wild state are oftentimes by no means so trust-
ful in captivity ; whilst those that prefer to shun the habitations
of mankind, seeking the solitudes of nature's recesses, quickly
lose their timidity. Such is the case with the three Thrushes
about which I have written, whilst the fourth species, the Ameri-
can 'Robin,' which everywhere in the United States and Canada
is as familiar a bird as our Blackbird and Song Thrush, seems
inclined to act as do his English cousins, who when taken from
their wild state are by no means particularly tameable for some
time after their capture. Not that I would infer that the Ameri-
can Robin is truly resentful and irreconcilable, but he seems at
first to be less completely fearless than his confreres of the more
untrodden ways.
The American Robin or Red-breasted Thrush (T.
migratori-iis) is very widely distributed in North America, breed-
ing from Mexico to Alaska and Hudson's Bay.
The pilgrim fathers of Massachusetts called this Thrush
the Robin, or Robin Redbreast, because it reminded them of the
beloved and familiar bird of their English homes. No doubt one
of the first birds they saw was this Thrush with his breast very

similarly coloured, and to this day he is highly prized by the
people of New England, who have protected him so that he has,,
like they themselves, multiplied greatly and taken up his abode
in towns and cities.
This Thrush is extremely handsome with his dark ashy-
grey upper parts, inclining to black on the head, his white throat
streaked longitudinally with black, his chestnut breast, white
abdomen and under tail-coverts. His shape, size, and general
bearing, remind one strongly of our Blackbird, as well as of the
Fieldfare, but the American birds flock together in very much
greater numbers on migration.
Let Mr. Nehrling again help us with his original observa-
tions upon this Thrush.
"The early spring flowers still sleep beneath snow and ice,
"the cold north and west winds still wildly sweep the northern

" part of our country. All nature seems dead. Suddenly, and
"entirely unexpectedly, a loud song of jubilation is carolled from
"the top of a neighbouring elm. There, in the top of yonder
" dark green pine is perched another one of these singers. They
"are Robins, just returned from their winter quarters, heralding
" in reverberating jubilation the approach of spring. This, our
" beautiful familiar Thrush, certainly merits the name 'harbinger
"of the vernal season,' for it is one of the first of our birds to
"arrive from the south.Usually it will remain in
"spite of the wintry garment covering nature, searching for
" food in spots where the snow has melted, and enlivening its
" habitation with its powerful music. . . . All our Thrushes,
" with few exceptions, are timid and shy, and shun the society of
"man. Most of them retreat to the deep woodland solitudes
" far from the abodes of man. All this is different with the Robin.
" Though originally a true forest bird, it has now everywhere
" attached itself to man, and, though still retaining its former
" sagacity and vigilance, has become quite confiding and fearless.
" You can find the Robin everywhere, in field and forest, in
" meadow and marsh, 011 hills and in valleys, in parks and gar-

" dens, and even high up in the mountains." . . .
The same writer goes on to describe the bird's song.
"It is during the breeding-season that the Robin's truly
' melodious and pleasing song is loudest.

Mr. Hubert D. Astlky,
"A harbinger indeed, it is the first bird to carol from the
" tree-tops the near arrival of spring. The song, though simple
"and modest, is not without effect at such a time in the suow-
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.963232263157895" page_id="32659690"  page_num="106" year="" vol="">
" covered, sadly silent landscape ; it fills desolate nature with in- .
"describably ioyous life and gives voice to man's longing for the
" warm, soft, and mild breezes of spring and the odour of opening
"flowers. The Robin's manner of singing is significant.
" While man)&amp;apos;- of our birds choose a concealed bushy spot
" where they sing, and moreover accompany their song with lively
" movements, the Robin selects an exposed spot, usually the top
" of a tree and pours forth its song for hours from this lofty
" perch.
" It sits quietly with its bill directed to the sky, and sings
" most earnestly and persistently early in the morning, as soon
"as the dawn appears in the east, and in the evening long after
" the fading of the bright sunset.
" Many students of bird-life, and even our great Audubon,
" compare the Robin's song to that of the European Blackbird, ;
"and maintain that the song of both birds is very similar.
"Judging from my own experience, which is confined to caged
" Blackbirds, I would say that this is only conditionally true, viz.,
" so far as the voice, the note itself, is concerned. Both birds,
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.8645410625" page_id="32659690"  page_num="106" year="" vol="">
"which are very near relatives, have a powerful and beautifully
"flute-like whistle, but the Blackbird's song is more continuous,
" more modulated ; the Robin's briefer, more monotonous. The
"Blackbird is one of the very best and most superb of songsters,
" and the comparison of the two birds shows that our Robin is to
"be classed with the finest of singers."
The American Robin nests quite readily in an aviary, a
pair at our Zoological Gardens having done so twice during the
summer of 1908.
In their native country they are to be seen hopping about
in gardens, orchards, and meadows, in precisely the same fashion
as do our Black Ouzels (Blackbirds) in England. Their return
in the breaking forth of the springtime is to the New Englanders
much like the return of the Swallows and Cuckoos to us.
After the long severe winter, when the earth has been
snow-bound for many many weeks, one can picture the extreme

pleasure of those who have eyes to see and ears to hear, when
the beloved Robins return from the south, and fill the air once
more with their warblings.
I should like to quote again, in conclusion, from Burroughs'
"Wake Robin," where he writes with regard to these four
Thrushes, and his words are selected from different portions of
his opening chapter " The Return of the Birds."
" If we take the quality of melody as the test, the Wood
"Thrush, Hermit Thrush and the Veery Thrush stand at the
"head of our list of songsters."
Discoursing upon the talents of the Mocking Bird as a
songster, he continues:--"The emotions excited by the songs

" of these thrushes belong to a higher order, springing as they do
" from our deepest sense of the beauty and harmony of the world.
" The Wood-Thrush is worthy of all, and more than all,
"the praises he has received, and considering the numbers of
" liis appreciative listeners, it is not a little surprising that his
"relative and equal, the Hermit Thrush, should have received so
" little notice.
" It is quite a rare bird, of very shy and secluded habits,
" being found in the Middle and Eastern States, during the
" period of song, only in the deepest and most remote forests,
" usually in damp and swampy localities. O11 this account the
" people in the Adirondac region call it the 'Swamp Angel.' Its
" being so much of a recluse accounts for the comparative iguor-

<bodyText confidence="0.926001230769231" page_id="32659691"  page_num="107" year="" vol="">
"ance that prevails in regard to it. The cast of its song is very
" much like that of the Wood Thrush, and a good observer might
"easily confound the two. But hear them together, and the
"difference is quite marked: the song of the Hermit is in a
"higher key, and is more wild and ethereal. His instrument
"is a silver horn which he winds in the most solitary places.
"The song of the Wood Thrush is more golden and leisurely.
"The Wood Thrush is the handsomest species of this
" family. In grace and elegance of manner he has no equal.
"Such a gentle, high-bred air, and such inimitable ease and
"composure in his flight and movement! How plain, yet rich
"his colour,--the bright russet of his back, the clear white of his
" breast, with the distinct heart-shaped spots !

" It may be objected to Robin that he is noisy and demon-
"strative&amp;apos;; he hurries away or rises to a branch with an angry
" note, and flirts his wings in ill-bred suspicion. The Wood
" Thrush has none of these under-bred traits. He regards me

" Thrushes.
"Walk out toward the forest in the warm twilight of a
"June day, and when fifty rods distant you will hear their soft
"reverberating notes, rising from a dozen different throats. It is
"one of the simplest strains to be heard,--as simple as the curve

This Show was held on December 4th and 5th in the
Horticultural Hall, Westminster, a hall that is eminently suit-
able for such an exhibition, being exactly the right size, well-
lighted, free from draughts, and of a comfortable temperature *
in fact the present writer knows of no more suitable place for a
bird-show in the Rondon district.
So far as the British and foreign section were concerned
(we did not take particular note of the Canary section) the
exhibition was a great success, the foreigners being perhaps the
rarest lot that have ever been seen together at a bird-show. Mr.
Frank Finn acted as judge of this section and had no light task
in some of the classes, where almost every bird was perfect.
The first of the Foreign Classes was devoted to Budgeri-
gars, Rove-birds and Hanging Parrots. None of the latter
were however present. The first prize went to Mr. C. T. Maxwell

for a solitary specimen of the rare Black-cheeked Love-bird ( Aga-
pornis nigrigenis ), a species so well figured and described a few
months since in this journal ; the second and third places being
won by Mrs. Leslie Miller with pairs of Guiana Parrotlets ( Psitta -
culce guianensis&amp;apos;) and Rosy-faced Love-birds respectively.
The next class w&amp;apos;as for the Larger Parrakeets, Lori-
keets and Lories, and here were shown some decided rarities.
First came a fine specimen of the rare Black-throated Lorikeet
(Trichoglossus nigrigularis )* one of the rare New Guinea species-
introduced to aviculturists by Mr. Walter Goodfellow. This was
shown by Mr. Maxwell, who also took third prize with an Elegant
Grass Parrakeet ( Neophe?na elegans), a species which appears to
be approaching extinction, being practically unknown now to
Australian catchers and aviculturists. Mr. O. Millsum was
awarded the second prize for a fine specimen of the rare Black-
winged Lory ( Eos cyauoge?iys), a species practically unknown to
aviculturists in this country. A Varied Lorikeet (. Ptilosclera ver-
sicolor ), a Sun Conure ( Conurus solstitialis ) a very rare bird now-
a-days. Many-coloured Parrakeets and White-eared Conures
completed the notable exhibits.
Of the Larger Parrots a Hawk-headed Parrot was the
most interesting exhibit, and well deserved its first prize.
The class for the commoner Waxbili.S obtained only six
entries, which called for no especial notice.
The next class was for the rarer Waxbills, Mannikins, etc.
and contained some very good birds. Mrs. Leslie Miller's perfect
pair of Painted Finches {Emblema picta&amp;apos;) came first, followed by a
beautiful pair of Violet Eared Waxbills ( Granatina granatina&amp;apos;) r
owned by Mr. Maxwell, who also obtained third prize with an
equally good pair of Red Faced or Melba Finches ( Pyteliamelba ).
A nice hen Vinaceous Firefinch (fourth) was sent by Mr. W.
Cook. Other good birds in this class were :--Australian Crimson
Finches (pair), Australian Waxbills, and single specimens of the
same species as some of the prize-winners.
The class for Grassfinches, Weavers and Whydahs was
not very well patronized. The first-prize winner called a " Gaboon

Series], facing page 21.

Weaver," was a fine male specimen of a species of Sperviospiza,
doubtless A. guttata, one of the Blue-billed Weavers, the first we
have seen alive. This was another of Mr. Maxwell's rarities, as
were also the second prize winners, a pair of Painted Finches
*( Emblema picta). This species won in both this and the class
before, but as it is difficult to say whether it is a " Waxbill" or a ,j
''Grassfinch" the judge, in our opinion, was quite right in
noticing it in both classes. Probably it is more of a Grassfinch
than a Waxbill, but so is the Crimson-finch and perhaps the
Australian '&amp;apos;Waxbill," which would be more correctly termed, as
the Australians term it, the " Red-browed Finch."
The third prize in this class went to Mr. Galloway for his
beautiful pair of the uncommon Scaly-crowned Finches ( Sporo -
pipes squamifrons) ; and there was also shown as perfect a pair of
Pintail Nonpareils as we have ever seen.
In the class for Grosbeaks, True Finches and Buntings
Mrs. E. Galloway obtained first prize with a fine Black-faced
Serin ( Serinus capistratus ) (?) ; Mr. Townsend's Rock Bunting
(Fringillaria tahapisi) came second, and a Diuca Finch ( Diuca
diuca ) belonging to the same gentleman was third ; while Mr.
Maxwell won fourth place with a cock Cuba Finch:
The Tanagers were a grand lot and competition was very
keen, Mr. Maxwell again won the chief honours, his four ex-
hibits being placed ist, 2nd, 4th and li.c. These comprised a
Red-tliroated Tanager ( Glossipiila rjtficollis), the first we have
ever seen on the show-bench; a Black-throated, a Spotted
Emerald ( Calliste gzUtaia&amp;apos;) and a Maroon. Mr. W. R. Pickles
took the third prize with a Maroon Tanager, while those that
failed to obtain prizes, but were rare and interesting were Mr.
Townsend's team of Tricolor, White-capped, Archbishop, and
Magpie; Mr. Millsum's pair of Magpie Tanagers, Mr. Watts'
Olive and two Superbs.
The class for all species of Sugar Birds, Honey-eaters,
etc. contained three specimens, a pair and a single male, of the
Black-faced Sugar-bird ( Chlorophanes spiza ), a well-known South
American species, but one that is almost unknown to avicul-
turists. The pair, which were awarded first prize, belonged to
Mr. Townsend, who informed the writer that they have nested

and produced eggs in a cage. Here then is a very beautiful
Sugar-bird that apparently would be very likely to nest success-
fully if given a chance in a fair-sized aviary. Mr. Galloway sent
a nice Blue Sugar-bird (.Dacuis cay ana ) and there were two
Golden-fronted Chloropsis.
The most interesting class in the show was that for all
species not catered for elsewhere. Here were some extremely
rare birds, possibly the most choice collection ever seen together
at a bird show.
Cuban Trogan (.Prionotelns temnurus).
The first prize winner was a Cuban Trogan (.Prionotelns

dull and uninteresting bird otherwise. The chief colours are
metallic green above, pale grey on the breast and red on the
abdomen. Curious liair-like filaments extend from the ear-
coverts.
This bird was shown, like most of the other rarities in the
show, by Mr. C. T. Maxwell, and bore testimony to his great
skill in keeping and exhibiting soft-bills in first-rate condition.
The second prize winner was a fine Giant Barbet belonging to
Mr. Townsend ; the third a very steady cock King Bird of Paradise
(Mr. Maxwell) ; fourth, a fine pair of White-spotted Jay Thrushes
ylanthocincla ocellaia ) from the Himalayas, fine birds for an aviary
but too large for a show-cage. These were sent by Mr. O.
Millsum.
This class also contained two Mexican Jays, a splendid
Niltava Flycatcher, Blue-winged Siva, Plumbeous Redstart,
Dhyal-bird and two Shamas.
The class reserved for members of the London Cage Bird
Association contained such rarities as a White-capped Redstart,
pair of Colies, Black-headed Sibia and Archbishop Tanager.

Sir, -- K indly allow me a short space in order to reassure Dr. Ticelmrst
with regard to the birds I saw in Kent. They were A &amp;apos;alius aquations, as a
matter of fact I only noticed one Moorhen (Galliuu/a chloropns) on that
occasion. I know of course that Rails do not usually shew themselves in
such a manner as to be seen by the unobservant eye, but I was readily
able to detect the presence of those I saw. Personally I cannot understand
the statements that the Water Rail is uncommon ; rarely seen would hardly
be a statement of fact because I feel sure that anyone who has had any
\0x25A0experience of this bird either in the field or aviculturally would readily

discern and distinguish them in their natural surroundings. There appears
to he a very great interest taken in these birds judging bv the number or
letters I have received since the publication in the September number of
the Magazine, of my notes, asking either for further information or to their
behaviour and treatment in captivity, or else enquiring where they can be
purchased.
I am personally acquainted with at least one instance of their breed-
ing iu^tlie county of Kent, as I saw the young ones in one of the ponds close
by Rishburgh Castle, near Sandwich, curiously enough within two miles of
the sea. This, however, is some few years ago, and I cannot recollect the
exact lyear; the fact cannot constitute a scientific record. There can be
little doubt that the Water Rail.must&amp;apos;breed every year within the confines of
the county&amp;apos;, but naturally&amp;apos; the y&amp;apos;oung as well as the old birds are not always
seen by those qualified to make the observation or who are sufficiently
interested to record the same. Pkrcy W. Farmbokough.
Through Mr. Farmborough's courtesy I have been able to see his
reply to my letter re Water Rails in Kei:t, before publication. Since he now
states definitely&amp;apos; that the birds he saw were Water Rails we must accept his
observation, but I cannot regard it as other than an unique experience to
see seven of these birds at one time in one field and close to a railway&amp;apos; line
and a passing train. I am very glad however to have drawn from him a
definite record of the Water Rail breeding in Kent, and since it is of
importance and would no doubt be of great interest I would ask him to be
so good as to publish a full and detailed account of the circumstances.

THE HIMALAYAN SNOW-COCK AND THE BLOOD PHEASANT.
Sir,--I have a friend in Nepal who has special facilities for getting
birds from there, and who would try and get me the " Blood Pheasant"
(llhagenes crueutus) and the "Himalayan Snow-cock" (Tetraogallus him-
alayensis) if there is a reasonable probability of the birds surviving the
journey to England and living in confinement.
As regards the Snow-cocks I never heard of their being kept in
captivity.
As regards the Blood Pheasants, the Prince of Wales when in India
had some given to him but I am told they all died owing to being sent to
Calcutta in the hot season.
I am also told that several dealers have made attempts to get Blood
Pheasants over but without success, though I do not quite see why.
I should like to ask if any&amp;apos; members have had any experience of
either Snow-cocks or Blood Pheasants, and if so would they give the benefit
of such experience.
A little actual practice is worth a lot of theory.

Sir,--I have been so much interested in Mr. Temple's article on his
experiences in starting an out-door aviary. I think members hardly realise
what a help to others, when described, struggles are, and many hints they
give are the greatest assistance to others. Would any member give their
experiences of starting an out-door parrakeet aviary; it would be most use-
ful if someone of experience would tell others what Parrakeets have been
found to agree together, especially through the nesting period. Could
some experienced member say if they have found it possible to keep say a
pair of finches, such as Parrot-finches or Gouldian Finches, with Parra-
keets, such as Stanley and Kings. I should much like to keep even a pair
of these but do not know if it is safe to put them together at breeding time.
I have found Budgerigars most vicious with Canaries.

THE WAXWING.
By W. H. St. Quintin. F.Z.S., M.B.O.U.
The Waxwing (.Ampelis garrulus ), the subject of this
paper, is one of three species of the genus Ampelis, which is
generallj'&amp;apos; placed near the Shrikes. It is circumpolar and, alone
of the three species which inhabit Europe, at irregular intervals
visits these islands.
Its near ally, A, cedrorum, is found in the whole of North
America, migrating iu winter as far south as Jamaica and
Cuba, and is by no means as boreal as our bird. It is smaller
than the latter; and, besides other characteristics, as Dresser
points out, can always be distinguished by its under tail coverts
being "yellowish, instead of being bay" in colour as in A.
garrulus.
The third species, A. phoenicopterus, the Japanese Wax-
wing, has red ends to the tail in place of golden-yellow, and has
no wax tips to the secondaries, and their outside webs are red
instead of white. It breeds in Japan, and in winter wanders into
North China.
But to return to A.garrulus, or the Bohemian Waxwing,
or Chatterer, as it used to be called. Surely no bird was ever
worse named ! It is no more Bohemian than British and, as to
garrulity, anyone who has kept the Waxwing will agree that
its silence is remarkable. Its only note is a shrill, weak, trilling,
cry, which has been compared to the call of the Blue-tit.
As will be seen by the accompanying illustration, the
Waxwing is an extremely pretty bird, and the decorations that it
wears are very unusual and showy. There is no seasonal change,

Mr. W. H. St. Quintin,
the plumage being the same winter and summer. Nor is it by
any means agreed amongst authorities that there are any external
indications by which the sexes can be distinguished.
The skin of a juvenile in the Natural History Museum in
London has no wax tips or yellow markings on the wings, only
the j&amp;apos;ellow band on the tail. But Dresser figures a nestling
which, in August, carried five wax tips, but the secondaries had
no white edges.
In the adult the shafts of the secondaries are prolonged
into horny, narrow points, like red sealing wax, seven or less in
number. Occasionally (in the large series of skins in the Museum
there are three examples), there are scarlet wax tips at the end
of the yellow band on each tail-feather. Very probably this is
not so much a mark of age as of exceptional vigour in the in-
dividual : for the unusual decoration is apparently usually corre-
lated with very broad rich yellow tail-bands.
In one of the above mentioned three skins (a Norwegian
one), the yellow edges of the primaries are veiy pale, perhaps
denoting that the bird is in its second year.
Of a pair which twice hatched young in my aviary in 1903,
I could onljr distinguish the female by the accidental fact that she
had a few feathers permanently disarranged on her shoulder by
the claw of some nocturnal assailant, probably a cat or Tawny
Owl. Both she and the cock were in equally brilliant plumage,
and I could detect no difference in their notes. But with regard
to the skins at the Museum ; each of the three with scarlet
tail tips is a male.; and, on the whole, the very finest gold and
scarlet ornaments seem to be worn by males, as might be ex-
pected.
I have described (. Avic. Mag., Vol. II., New Series) how we
failed to rear the young hatched here in June and July 1903;
mainly I believe owing to the unfortunate position of the nest,
which was fully exposed to the sun. I have always felt that if
the birds had been in a larger, cooler aviary, well provided with
bushes, grass, &amp;c. we should have done better. I am still hope-
ful of better success !
I think it may be interesting to some of ny fellow members
to see the accompanying reproduction of an accurate portrait by

Mr. Grouvold, of one of the eggs laid here ; the first, so far as I
can learn, that has ever been laid in confinement by the Wax-
wing. There now remains on the British list no bird which is a
tolerably frequent visitor, about whose eggs and nesting habits,
it has to be said that nothing is known ; much, even in the last
year or two, having been learnt about several species breeding in
the vast "Tundra" swamps of Siberia, but which visit these
islands more or less regularly in spring or autumn.
But it was very different half a century ago. And about
no conspicuous and easily identified species was there more com-
plete ignorance than about the subject of this paper.
It was not till 1856 that Mr. John Wolley was able to
announce that, as the result of several arduous journeys to Lap-
laud, he had discovered the secret of the Waxwing ; and one can
imagine the gratification of the great Oologist, when he told his
audience the now familiar story of the peasant Ludwig's finding
the nest and eggs, which he himself was able to verify the next
year. One of the original nests brought home by Mr. Wolley can
be seen in the National Collection in Cromwell Road. It is of
dark tree-lichen, interwoven amongst dry spruce twigs, and lined
with dead grass and a few feathers. Mr. Phillipps has given the
whole narrative, as well as further information about the Wax-
wing and its allies, in this Magazine (New Series, Vol. I.)
One great obstacle to studying the habits of the Waxwing
has been the irregularity of its movements ; not only when it
wanders south to avoid the severity of the arctic winter, but also
when it is selecting a district to breed in. One can understand
why its appearance here should be uncertain, as its visits depend
upon the conditions of the weather far north and east of us. But
it is less easy to understand why, in the breeding area, it is in
some years quite plentiful ; while in others, on the same ground,
it can hardly be found. In 1856 we read that Mr. Wolley received
from his collectors twenty-nine eggs ; and one may be sure that,
for such a prize, the district was well searched. In 1857 he him-
self, with all his ardour, could not " get a sight of" a single pair
of the birds; and his nearest approach to success was the dis-
covery of one forsaken nest, with broken eggs lying on the
ground below. I11 the next year the bird was abundant, and
about 700 eggs were sent out of the Muoniovara district.

On the Waxwing.
The Waxwing has some structural affinities with the
Starlings, and it resembles the Rosy Pastor in being sociable
in the breeding season ; and, like that bird, its presence in any
particular district at nesting time is extremely uncertain and
cannot be counted upon. A colony of Rosy Pastors will follow a
horde of locusts, and breed amongst them. It may be that the
Waxwing's selection of a locality to nest in is connected with its
food supply. Both young and adults feed largely in summer
upon insects--mayflies, craneflies, &amp;c., as well as upon certain
berries.
That this species is a plentiful one can be assumed from
the fact that enormous quantities are sometimes brought into the
northern cities for food. We read of "thousands" exposed for
sale in the flower market of St. Petersburgh ; and of " cartloads ,r
in the game market of Christiania in January, 1872. \_Cf, Dresser's&amp;quot;
" Birds of Europe."]
The Waxwing is not in much favour in this country as a
subject for aviculture; chiefly, I think, because it has often been
kept under unsuitable conditions. It has been condemned as
being sluggish, greedy, and dirty ; but this is only true if the
bird is kept in a cage. In an aviary, not too much exposed to
the full sun, at any rate, where there are plenty of shady places,
where the bird can take refuge from the glare of an English mid-
summer day ; with variety of perches, and yet with plenty of
space between to invite exercise, I think there can be no more
charming occupants of a garden aviary than a pair or two of
Waxwings. As might be expected, in this climate the bird can
be considered absolutely hardy, errors of diet excepted ; and this
question of diet need really present no difficulty. My experience
has taught me to discard all food of a farinaceous nature ; and I
feed my Waxwings upon " Insect food," as supplied by one of the
firms advertising in this magazine, with always plenty of currants,
either Zante or Sultana. When in season I hang up berried
sprays of hawthorn, privet, &amp;c., and when breeding I gave my
birds yolk of egg (flakes) and mealworms witli discretion. But
the bird in captivity, it must be remembered,- is subject to fits
brought on by indigestion ; and too generous a diet is as mis-
chievous as in the case of other (unfeathered) bipeds. I have-

only once been fortunate enough to see this delightful bird at
liberty. I had been examining a salmon pass on the river Ure
(Yorkshire) on Jan. 17th, 1893, and when near Westwick Dam, I
came upon a couple of Waxwings feeding on the hips of the dog-
rose in an old ragged hedge. The snow lay deep, but the sun was
shining, and I have a vivid recollection of the appearance of the
beautiful birds, as with very considerable effort they swallowed
the bright coloured berries. I have a note that they allowed me
to stand within seven or eight yards, and that I left them feeding.

Mr. Gekakd H. Gukney,
has become a charmingly tame and interesting bird and is, at
present, in very good order and health. This Concal as it is
often called is a common species in East Africa, frequenting the
dense bush, generally in the vicinity of water and living
principally amongst the reedy and jungly edges of lakes and
rivers, in which it crawls about searching for food. They
appear to be able only to fly a very short distance at a time
and seem unwilling to take to flight unless obliged to, crawling
in and out of the reeds and undergrowth almost like the Rails.
They have a beautiful loud, bubbling note, which sounds like
gurgling water being poured out of an inverted narrow-necked
bottle, and the natives call it the " water-bottle bird " and some-
times " Rain bird " because they say they call more loudly
before wet weather.
Away from civilization they appeared to be extraordinarily
tame and fearless of man, and my bird was caught by my native
gunbearer who saw it sitting in a small tree and, knowing my
predilection for anything alive, went into the bush and caught it
with his hands with hardlyany difficulty, the bird barely attempt-
ing to resist, merely hopping from one bough to another; at first
I thought it must be ill or hurt in some way, but I presently
found that it was simply its utter fearlessness of man which made
it appear to be so tame. We were on a shooting expedition at
the time and being continually on the move I did not think there
was much likelihood of my being able to keep it alive, as I
imagined in any case it would be a difficult bird to feed ; however
it seemed so extraordinarily tame and quiet that I determined to
try, and from the very first I had not the least trouble with it.
It began to feed at once on sopped bread, certain berries, grass-
hoppers, and the ever valuable "Abrahams' Egg Yolk,'' several
tins of which I had taken out to Africa with me. In a tiny cage
I brought my Centropus safely back to England, and though when
he arrived he looked very dirty and bedraggled his wonderful
crimson eye being the only clean bright bit about him, three
weeks in a large outdoor aviary soon did wonders with his plum-
age, and he is now in as perfect feather and condition as anyone
could wish to see a bird in.
Possibly from having been all the summer in too large an

aviary he lias lost a good deal of his wonderful natural tameness,
though he will still come and take a mealworm from my fingers,
but it frightens him now to be handled and stroked as I could do
at first. He is very secretive and retiring in his habits, lurking
and hiding among the thick foliage of a small tree in the aviary,
though on a sunny day he loves to climb up to the highest branches
and sun himself, spreading out each wing to get as much heat as
possible ; if anyone conies he at once crawls down into the leaves
again, where he remains motionless, only occasionally flirting his
long green tail. I have only twice heard my bird call or whistle
any of his wonderfully melodious notes since he has been in cap-
tivity ; the first time was 011 the journey home, at Marseilles
Railway Station at ten o'clock at night, when I was getting into
the " Rapide" for Paris, the Centropus suddenly burst forth into
a crescendo-like scale of bubbling notes, greatly to the amaze-
ment of the French porters, who had 110 notion that the large
brown paper covered parcel, which they had to carry so carefully,
contained anything alive ; his only note now is a low guttural
kind of hiss, which is frequently uttered if anyone goes into the
aviary, possibly from nervousness, but more likely I think,
as a mark of annoyance. My bird is very fond of water and likes
a large bath, especially on a bright sunny day he enjoys paddling
about in the shallow pan, not apparently searching for food, but
simply as an enjoyment; when he is engaged in this occupation
he holds his tail up quite high and is very careful to keep it
perfectly dry, occasionally he will put his head right down into
the water and if it is a very warm day, throws the water over his
back and wings; when he has finished his ablutions he walks
round and round the aviary with drooping wings and expanded
tail and presently finishes the drying by hopping up into a tree
until he can get the sun's rays upon his feathers. He is very
inquisitive, and if anything new is put into the aviary he at once
hops down and examines it in the most comical way, something
like a Magpie does.
When he first arrived I put him into a large outdoor cage
in which were a pair of small Ground Doves ; all went well for a
week, when one morning my man told me that there must be a
mouse in the cage as one of the Doves had been killed and half

eaten in the night; although I doubted its being the work of a
mouse, traps were set, but with no result. Two mornings later,
on going early to the aviary, I found the Centropus on the ground,
standing on the dead body of the second dove, which he was tear-
ing to pieces with his sharp bill and devouring with evident
relish ; since then I have constantly given him a dead Sparrow or a
mouse and he has always eaten them ; he is a voracious and by no
means particular feeder--insects, egg, sopped bread and fruit are
all part of his daily menu, but he loves a bit of chopped rabbit's
liver more than anything else. He does not appear to feel the
cold much, and though in a heated aviary at night, during the
day he always is out in the enclosure in front ; his condition and
order at present are very good and I see no reason why, with care,
he should not live for a long time.
Since writing the above notes I hear that Mr. Hamlyn
has received a pair of Centropus from South Africa, which maybe
the same species as mine, and if so my bird has no longer the
honour of being the only living example of this species in
England.

Rats give no trouble and cats not much. The latter some-
times cause a scare in the old aviary, when the catch-em-alive
box trap in the verandah is set and the obnoxious one is per-
manently removed. For practical purposes the few tame cats in
the station may be ignored, as they have not bothered me.
Any Hawk or Crow attracted to the aviary usually waits long
enough for a gun to be got out, and the trouble ceases. Snakes
cannot be kept out, but they seldom come, and the birds will soon
let you know and also locate the reptile for you. Owls would be
a nuisance perhaps if the birds roosted outside, but with an
occasional exception they roost undercover, having no encourage-
ment to do otherwise. Mice are the most apt to give trouble ;
though, bar eating seed, they have done no damage that I can
trace to them for certain. A tin or box placed in a corner close

enough to the walls to just allow a mouse to run round behind
with a set out unbaited " Nipper" trap at each end of the run is
deadly. They seem soon to learn the danger of a baited trap,
especially a " Catch-em-alive " one. If I find from their traces
that they circumvent a trap probably by jumping, I put an extra
one close to it with perhaps a third at the back, and virtue com-
bined with a little guile is rewarded. A couple of dozen
"Nippers" cost little, give little work, and set with a little
intelligence, occasionally changing the locatity, will keep the
pests practically down to vanishing point. Any trapping inside
is done with a wire-fronted box cage without a back. Three or
four set " Nippers" are placed on the bottom and the whole hung
or placed over the hole of ingress. On return from any absence
all nests and boxes are carefully examined and if necessary steps
are taken for destruction of intruders, but I generally find that
the enemy prefer to have their headquarters in the house walls,
and then they have to run the gauntlet of traps on the store-room
shelves. I have had no trouble from lizards, or insect vermin
large or small.
The ground in the flight is an naturel, or nearly so, i.e., the
clay soil and stone is left trampled as it was by the workmen
when building the aviary. Three or four feet along the outer
edge is turfed with growing sods changed as convenient or
necessary. This is watered from the outside with a little help
from the bhisti when changing the water inside. Flowering or
seeding plants, such as false Marigold, lettuce, beetroot, spinach,
etc., clump of wild millets and other seed bearing grasses are
roughly planted in the turf when available. The birds soon cut
them down to bare sticks, but it is seldom that they cannot be
replaced with something or other. Green or budding branches
are nailed or stuck up among other branches and are much liked ;
wild medlars and fir are most used as they are easily got and are
popular with the birds.
Branches cover the under roof of the covered portions and
the walls. Corners are stacked with branches to form bushes or
brush from floor to roof. Artificial perches run all the way round
the flight a few inches from the wire and about 5ft. from the
ground, one or two are also placed higher to allow the birds to

Captain G. A. Perreau,
enjoy the early morning sun as soon as possible. There is no
incentive to roost or nest in the open.
Nest boxes in detail would require an article to them-
selves and I must content myself with little more than mentioning
a few. I am sure one cannot have too many or too great a
variety. For small finches all sorts of domestic boxes and tins
come in useful; Liptou's one-pound tea tins are most handy,
with very little faking, to hang on wire netting. I must confess
to liking nests which easily satisfy my curiosity, so prefer the
above when fitted with doors, and which can also be easily taken
down to look at, but I use all sorts as well, husks and cocoanut
shells, home-made willow basket-nests, old hats, straw wine-
bottle covers on wooden ends, sections of hollow branches both
upright and horizontal, &amp;c. Boxes for Parrakeets are of even
greater variety as these birds are more exigent. I have found
a log, or a box with " log-wood " bottom and entrance at the end,
the best. I generally screw in a bit of " log-wood " inside the
entrance, to allow the Parrakeets to make their own chips. By
" log-wood " I mean wood from a hollow tree, from which the
inside rotten wood has come away naturally. I have found tinder
or cheesy rotten wood to be useless except as a toy. A good log
of tinder set up against a post with a few holes bored in it makes
a splendid toy, and is generally worth watching, especially when
there are young Budgerigars about. Budgerigars and Cockatiels
have bred with me in " gritty" rotten wood logs, but have never
reared full broods, the wood comes out in small chunks which
seem good neither for eggs nor young. I much regret money
wasted in a variety of small barrels. My Budgerigars have bred
in husks, but they much prefer boxes. Husks are, in my opinion,
much over-rated, picturesqueness is their only advantage over
boxes for any birds.
Young birds are (or should be) caught out as soon as they
are really able to look after themselves ; Parrakeets with a net,
others with the sieve traps except when they are wanted in a
hurry when the net is used for them too. The net is a large
butterfly net on a cane frame with practically no handle. The
sieve trap is a large wire-covered box held up by a cord which
runs on pulleys to a nail in the wall close to my chair. It has a

small door in one side to run captures into a small cage. This is
always left set.
Difficulty in procuring good grit is a great drawback in
many parts of India, but luckily we are free from this. The floor
in the covered portions is thickly strewn with good river sand
really coarse and fine grit, from which only the larger stones are
taken out. There are a few large rough stones on the ground in
the flight, put in as " perches" for Chats ; many birds, especially
Gouldians, like rubbing their beaks on these. Large lumps of
rock salt are placed on flat stones in the verandah and occasion-
ally damped ; a little is sometimes given crushed. Bits of
cuttle fish are always present and some, cut up fine, is given about
every other day and is much appreciated and, to my mind, is a
requisite for Grass-finches, especially when they are moulting or
have young.
Two iron pans, tinned, about i8in. in diameter, and about
2in. deep go to each flight for water. The bhisti cleans and re-
fills these every morning. A third, with a flat stone in it to form
an island, makes an excellent place for undesirable live stuff such
as white ants and "net-sweepings." Green stuff is simply thrown
on the ground. I might mention that this is given all the year
round regardless of frost. I have not my previous account by
me but am nearly sure I gave there a pretty full list of green
stuff, seeds, &amp;c., in use and, as this account will be longer than I
intended, I will not go over them again, but will only mention
my labour and seed saving arrangement. Three earthenware
dishes go comfortably in one pan similar to the ones for water,
one pan for each sort of seed, pans kept in the verandah. I can
comfortably carry four of the homely "Delhi flour" tins full of
seeds at once. Waste seed is turned out of dishes into the pans
and the dishes refilled. As the pans fill up the contents are
removed to kerosine oil tins (the ubiquitous and ever useful), and
screened in the compound when sufficient has collected.
I am purposely omitting insectivorous birds as I only
started keeping these in earnest in July, 1907. The3^ " sort of"
form another phase in my bird-keeping, and also no attempt was
made at breeding from them. The aviaries have generally been
rather overcrowded and the inmates a bit mixed, but I do not

Captain G. A. PERREAU,
complain about breeding successes. There are usually at least
two pairs of Parrakeets breeding or thinking about it in the
Finch Aviary, but I cannot recommend this mixture without
careful watching. My Mealy Rosellas brought four broods in
rapid succession without a mishap to the weaker inmates. Then
the cock wished to go on, but the hen thought she had done her
duty and I paid dearly for not watching the cock more carefully
or, to be more accurate, for disregarding the signs of a storm
brewing. I think that the inmates of my aviaries will best be
shown by giving my breeding results, successful or otherwise,
from June 1905 to March 1908.
Meal)'' Rosellas, one pair successfully reared eighteen in
four broods between April, 1906, and April, 1907. They showed
signs of wanting to nest again in March, 1908.
Cockatiels have bred continuously (or nearly so) since
April, 1905, seldom rearing more than three at a time.
Budgerigars, Green and Yellow, have bred ad lib. at all
seasons.
Madagascar Lovebirds, one pair, have reared two broods
in each of the two cold weathers I have had them.
Blue-winged Parrotlets : the hen several times retired to
nest boxes for three weeks at a time but never even laid, so I
parted with the only pair I had. I must say I do like allowing
birds to make their own choice of mates, even one alternative
mate is something.
Blue-crowned Hanging Parrakeets and Musky Lorikeets
I believe would have got as far as eggs this year had I not
come home in March.
It was only in April, 1907, that I was able to procure
(through the kindness of Mr. Ezra) cock Rosellas and hen Red-
rumps, both of these were ardently wishing to nest when I left.
Other Parrakeets have had no chance of nesting.
True Finches do not appeal to me much, and I have not
paid them much attention and, probably for this reason, have no
successes to record. Even Canaries, with which I did take some
trouble, have reared very few. The handsome Desert Finch

Accentor) had no chance, but were pairing in March, 1908.
Himalayan Goldfinches did nothing beyond feeding each other.
Other finches and buntings had no chance.
White Java Sparrows reared a fair number from spring to
autumn, the young becoming more splashed as the season went
on. The Grey only thought of nesting when I was leaving,
though I had them three years. I believe they nested almost at
once in a friend's aviary after my departure. Pekin Robins got
as far as carrying grass when they were banished for egg-
stealing. I think that those who depreciate the song of this bird
cannot have heard a good one ; I have not since my arrival in
England. Baya Weavers have had little chance at even nest-
building beyond giving the Parrakeets amusement in cutting off
their beginnings.
With my favourite " Ornamental Finches " I have had a
very good proportion of successes. Zebras have bred ad lib. at
all seasons. Bengalese not far behind. Sharp-tailed have bred
freely in the comparatively short time I had them, both amongst
themselves and with Bengalese. Striated after longdelay reared two
small broods towards the end of 1907. Long-tailed Grassfinches
have reared a good number during the last two years at irregular
seasons ; I have found the Yellow-billed the freer breeders.
Parsons and Cordon Bleus I have not had over long, they each
reared one small brood of three after repeated failures. Cherry
Finches reared one bird during the short time I had them.
Gouldians have reared a fair number each year between August
and March, the best pair raised fourteen in one season, in broods
of six, three, and five. I have had six or seven pairs going
the last two seasons in the same aviary and, according to my
experience, sexual selection had nothing to do with the colour of
the head. Spice-birds and Red Avadavats reared some small
broods in spring and autumn. My solitary Bronze-wing had two
young by a Striated hen.
Diamond Sparrows I have found delicate at first and liable
to ulcers on the beak, and it was only last year that I got a hen

acclimatised ; they got as far as eggs and were nesting again
when I got rid of them, prior to my departure. During the short
while I had them Green Avadavats and Tricoloured Nuns got as
far as young, and Black-headed Nuns and Chestnut-breasted as
far as eggs. Other ornamental finches had no chance, being odd
birds.
Bustard Quail laid several times but the cock would not sit.
Jungle Bush Quail laid and the hen sat well, and they had bad
luck in hatching the very day I had to clear out the aviary. I
only went in for Quail since 1907, but certainly shall not be with-
out them in future if I can help it. I think I have now gone over
all birds of which I have kept pairs long enough to give them a
chance to breed.
I find I have said nothing about heating. The first winter
I kept a Sunrise oil-stove burning at night. The second, I was
away and no heating was attempted, with apparently no harmful
results. The third, the stove was only used in especially bad
weather. Only once did the stove go wrong, and then fortunately
the smell of smoking oil penetrated the bedroom and the flaming-
stove was carried outside before harm was done. The room was
black all over and it could be seen for some time after which birds
had roosted inside. I own that I should like to heat the aviary
in winter if it could be done safely and economically, but after all
very many birds prefer roosting in the verandah, for instance
Gouldians and Hanging Parrakeets. These, one would think, of
all the birds, would require warmth the most, yet they have kept
as fit as anything. However I feel that heating might be bene-
ficial and that it could certainly do no harm, always provided
that the apparatus did not go wrong. Even in England this has
happened. Anglo-Indians (from the Punjab at any rate) can
easily understand my preferring to use heat as seldom as
possible.
I have before given my reasons for not'-going in for"
Indian birds and I fear many of our members will not care Pu-
tins account of common birds, but rarity is comparative and I
think I can safely say that I have had more difficulty in pro-
curing my common birds than most aviculturists have had over
their prizes. Actual expenditure, though not small, was the

consignments from abroad through the agency of an obliging but
non-avicultural friend, may sympathise with me without for-
getting their obligation to that friend.

By Mrs. Reid.
In the month of April, 1908, my hen Grey Parrot quite un-
expectedly laid a soft egg and was very ill, but got quite well in
a few days. On the 3rd of August the pair of birds were noticed
to be feeding each other and very affectionate. I therefore began
using much lime, old mortar broken up and cuttle fish bone,
which was grated over all their food. On the 6th a nice sound
egg was laid ; on the 8th a second ; after an interval of five days
a third egg.
The hen sat steadily from the very first, only leaving the
nest for about fifteen minutes in the morning, generally bathing
then, and for another ten minutes in the evening before sunset.
The male bird fed her constantly and most regularly, and was
extremely good and devoted. O11 the 6th Sept, a chick was
hatched ; on the 7th another; and the third chick did not come
out till five days later, when I was beginning to feel sure the
third egg was bad.
For the first week the male bird did not feed the young at
all, he fed the mother continually and she transferred the food
to the chicks, but after about a week I noticed he was also
feeding them and working very hard at it. Their usual food is
Indian corn soaked for twenty-four hours, then well washed and
given to them damp; they also have hemp seed with a sprinkling
of canary and millet, and a spoonful or two of rice, tapioca, or
any other milk pudding that is going, and plenty of ripe banana,
of which they are very fond.
For the first fortnight they seemed to give the chicks no-
thing but soft food, later they gave much hemp, some canary or
millet and ground or monkey nuts. I was sorry, however, to

notice very soon that the parents were not attending properly to
the youngest chick ; they visibly neglected it and even some-
times pushed it quite away from them into a corner by itself. It
died when about a fortnight old, and I then found its legs and
feet were very much deformed and twisted. I do not know if
this was the reason its parents turned against it, but I thought it
most unnatural and wicked of them.
About the middle of December, not earlier, the young birds
began to come out to the edge of their nest barrel, and were quite
tame and nice with me, readily taking food from my hand. They
now come right out, and try to go all over their aviary, but when
I see they look tired I catch them in a strong cloth (their beaks
are already pretty powerful), and put them back in their nest.
It is, I suppose, too soon to judge with certainty, but they
look like a male and female, one having a much smaller hen-like
head than the other. Their eyes are almost black, at least, very
dark slaty. They are very strong and healthy, in fact, in splendid
condition. These parrots occupy a small aviary to themselves,
but during the day the door generally stands open, and they,
like all my other parrots, have been accustomed to go about the
garden and grounds for hours. I cut a few feathers in one wing
every two months and they seldom stray far. During the time of
incubation the hen bird never came outside the aviary and the
male bird very seldom.
They nested in a small barrel fixed on its side inside a box,
open in front and high up in one corner of the aviary. They had
been accustomed to sleep in this barrel before they adopted it as a
nest box. I had put a good thick layer of sawdust in the bottom
and before laying the hen covered this with soft down which she
took from her breast. In front of the barrel runs a strong perch
which goes right across the aviary, so that the birds step right
out of it without trouble.
I am afraid I am writing at too great length, but sincerely
hope some of my fellow aviculturists will be interested to know
that Grey Parrots really can be successfully bred in confinement.

Saxicola monticola.
By Dr. A. G. Butler.
It will be remembered that, when sending me a pair of this
species Major Horsbrngh promised, in the event of their living,
to forward all his notes on the species for publication in the
Magazine.
In August I received a letter in which Major Horsbrugh
says:--" I am so sorry to hear the cock is dead, as the changes in
plumage would have been most interesting to watch.
" I did not send you any notes, as the last letter I had
from you informed me that the birds had only been with you a
few hours and I took it for granted you would write again ; not
hearing from you I concluded the birds were dead.
"The pair I sent you were hatched in an empty paraffin
tin which I found lying on the veldt. The nest was a very large
affair and was chiefly constructed of mud. It contained three
eggs when I found it, and, owing to the heavy rains which had
just fallen, was very wet indeed.
" When I took the youngsters on Nov. 26th, --07, there
was no trace of the third egg.
"The father of these birds had a white cap and black
body, but no white stomach, and I have found males breeding in
all the last six stages of plumage mentioned in your article.
" The male bird I sent you was getting grey at his first
moult, which apparently upsets the remarks on page 194, Sclater
and Stark."
"The cock had just assumed this plumage on March 5,
when he left here for England. From my notes I see, that
another cock bird, one of a brood of two, was reared in the
Garrison Club, Potchefstroom, and these two birds have haunted
the Club verandah up to date (March 5th). This cock bird has
white stomach, grey cap and white shoulder-knots with black
body, just like a bird I received in Bloemfontein that had a
similar plumage at its first moult.
" Do you agree with me that in this species there must be
two colour phases for the male bird, all my observations tend to
prove this theory?"

I then wrote and tried to induce Major Horsbrugh to write
a full account of this species, from personal observation, for the
Magazine ; but I suppose he was weary of this particular species,
or had no more to add respecting it; at any rate I heard nothing
further from him and have at length decided no longer to keep
back the interesting notes in his letter.
The hen Chat is in very vigorous health and does not seem to
grieve over the loss of her brother : she moulted without trouble
about the end of August and beginning of September, becoming
--at this her second moult--perhaps a trifle more smoky in tint
--but still in no sense what anybody with an eye for colour could
call black.
I found that she accepted red currants with as great plea-
sure as grapes, but they seem to have been scarce in 1908 as I
only twice succeeded in obtaining them for her: grapes she eats
\0x25A0every day of her life, tearing a hole, catching them by the edge
of it and slinging them away, thus gradually breaking them up
and swallowing them piecemeal.
The commonest call-note of this bird appears to be a rat-
ling and rather shrill " Hrrreet," with which I am often greeted
when I approach the flight-cage in the morning. On one occa-
sion this was followed by a succession of about six not unpleasing
notes almost amounting to a short song. One other note, which
struck me as being either indicative of alarm or perplexity, was
uttered for the first time on January 2nd of the present year
while the floor of the conservatory was being scrubbed, it sounded
like the sharp yap of a little dog and was repeated at intervals
for about a quarter of an hour.
When I look at the perfect condition and abounding health
\0x25A0of this neat little Wheatear, I must confess that I often feel
annoyed to think that the male bird also was too far gone for
restoration when it reached me. The slight nervousness which
the lieu bird exhibited at first when I changed her food has en-
tirely passed away, though she often takes exercise in the same
manner. I have never seen others of my birds act quite like it
when taking flying leaps :--she starts from one perch across to
the opposite end of the cage which she uses as a spring-board
from which she returns to the opposite end and then to the perch

is taken advantage of. As a general rule birds fly from perch to
perch ; and it is, I suppose, only the rapidity with which the
Chat strikes the wall with the soles of its feet and flings itself
back which prevents it sliding on the smooth surface.

The voyage from Fremantle to Adelaide occupies four
days, and there is no means of travelling from the Western to the
Kastern States except by sea, though the construction of a trans-
continental railway, traversing the mighty desert ( is seriously
contemplated. When this railway is constructed two or three
days will be saved in the journey from home to Victoria or New
South Wales, and the Great Australian Bight, dreaded by those
who do not love the sea, will be feared no longer.
Fortunately the Bight was 011 its best behaviour when I
*crossed it in the good ship " Oroutes," and one was able to
observe in comfort the bird- and animal-life of the Australian
seas.
As we left Fremantle Harbour great numbers of Silver
Gulls (La?ns nov&amp;lt;z-hollandi(Z) followed the ship, while Cormorants
both black and pied were perched in numbers on every buoy or
post at the harbour mouth. Outside, as we approached the open
sea, Petrels were seen, skimming the waves like so many Swal-
lows. The common Petrel of these seas is the "Mutton Bird"
*or Short-tailed Petrel (^Puffnis teuuirostris), a species which breeds
in vast numbers on the islands in Bass Strait, where the young,
which are provided with an extraordinary quantity of oil}&amp;apos;- fat,
form the staple food of the islanders. The way in which the
young Mutton Birds are taken and preserved for food has often
been described, and I will not dilate upon it here
Several other species of Petrels frequent these seas, but
*one who is new to these regions and inexperienced in the study
of this group of ocean birds, has great difficulty in distinguishing
between the species as they glide in circles over the waves, per-

fectly in their element far from any resting place save the ever-
rolling sea.
Gannets (Sula serrator ) are common in these seas, and we
frequently saw them, generally flying in twos or threes across
our bows. Their principal nesting home is on the smaller islands
situated in Bass Strait, where there are vast colonies. Farther
north, before our arrival in Australian waters we had seen the
Brown Gannet or "Booby" (Sula sula), a species of the tropics,
which in these cooler waters south of Australia is absent. Flying
fish which, to one who has never before been in tropical waters
are so interesting, were only seen singly or in small parties
here, instead of in great shoals as we had seen them in the
warmer seas. It is extremely interesting to watch them.
As the ship ploughs along, throwing up wings of spray
from her prow, these curious fishes, scared by the strange monster,
rush to the surface and spring into the air. Their long fins,
entering the less dense element, vibrate at an enormous rate,
and they fly away over the surface, undulating their flight with
the surface of the sea, rising and falling over the rolling waves for
twenty, fiftv, a hundred, or even a hundred and fifty vards. As
one watches them, each moment expecting to see the splash ;
which ends their flight, they continue on and on occasionally just i
lipping a wave, but continuing until at length their fins having &amp;apos;
apparently become dry by the hot sun and rapid motion through
the air, they fail to surmount a wave and, with an ignominious
splash, descend into the water. It has been said that they do
not really fly, but only sail with motionless fins- There is no
doubt whatever in my mind however that they do actually fly, and
fly well ; and I watched them very carefully indeed, often through j
powerful glasses.
Shoals of Dolphins were often seen, and are most interesting
to watch, as they come with great leaps out of the water, generally
making towards the ship ; shining brown objects witli long
pointed snouts. Long after the ship has passed them they can
be seen leaping and tumbling about like so many sea-kittens-
at play.
The most numerous birds perhaps are the Albatrosses,
though there were not so many seen on the outward as on the

return journey three months later; magnificent birds they look
as they sweep round the ship or follow in its wake in constant
expectation of a good feed from the refuse thrown overboard. It
is a fine sight to watch these mighty birds majestically sailing on
motionless wings in the brilliant sunlight just above the ship&amp;apos;s
deck, their bright eyes apparently taking in every detail of the
ship. The common species here is the Black-browed Albatross
or " Molly Hawk" of sailors, the Diomedea melanophrys of the
ornithologist. The White-capped Albatross ( Thalassogeron Cantus&amp;apos;)
also frequents these seas, and Mr. Dudley Le Souef has given us
a most graphic account of one of their nesting colonies on
Albatross Island, Bass Strait, in his Wild Life in Australia and
in the Ibis ( 1895). The Flat-billed Albatross ( T. culminatus) and
the Yellow-nosed Albatross ( T. chloroi&amp;apos;liynchus) also have their
home in these regions, and the Sooty Albatross ( Phcebetria
fuliginosa ) is frequently seen. The great Wandering Albatross
(.Diomedea exulans) frequents these waters in limited numbers,
but I cannot say for certain that I actually saw it here myself.

THE ADELAIDE ZOOLOGICAL GARDENS.

On the morning of February 3rd we docked at Port Ade-
laide, where I left the ship, deciding to proceed to Melbourne by
train, as I was anxious to spend some time in the Adelaide
Zoological Gardens. The city of Adelaide is some distance from
the Port, the train journey occupying something like half-an-
hour.
The Adelaide Zoo, belonging to the Zoological and Accli-
matization Society of South Australia, was opened as a Zoo about
twenty-five years ago; it is prettily situated to the north of the
town, close to the Botanical Gardens. It is small, about seven-
teen acres in extent, but perhaps the prettiest Zoo in Australia.
The entrance fee is the same as that of the other Australian Zoos,
namely sixpence, and Saturday is a free day. In consequence of
this last arrangement very little money is taken at the gate, as
nearly everybody waits until a Saturday before paying their visit.
About ^800 is taken annually at the gates, and the Gardens are
subsidised by the Government to an extent of ^2000 per annum,
with occasional extras for special work.

Mr. D. Seth-Smith,
When I entered the gate almost the first sound that greeted
me was the voice of Lorikeets, and I consequently made straight
for a large aviary from which I imagined the sound proceeded.
I discovered however that the sound eminated from a large
Eucalyptus tree which was covered with its pretty feathery white
flowers. Not more than six feet from me, on a branch of this tree,
sat a Musky Lorikeet (Glossopsittacus concinnus ) busily extracting
the nectar from the flowers. It is extraordinarily difficult to
detect these birds among the green leaves of the trees. This tree
contained quite a dozen of these pretty Parrakeets, but it was
only after very carefully searching the branches that I was able
to detect them. These birds were remarkably tame and I think
I could nearly have captured them with a butterfly net as they,
in company with various Honev-eaters, especially the White-
bearded or New-Holland Honey-eater (.Meliornis novce-hollandice)
busily hurried from flower to flower in quest of the drop of sweet
honey which each contained.
I made towards the house of the Director, Mr. A. C.
Mincliin, who courteously gave me particulars about the Gardens
and conducted me round them. Here, as in the other antipodean
Zoos, foreign animals are better represented than those indi-
genous to Australia ; but it is hardly surprising that the Aus-
tralian people should care little for their own native fauna which
they chiefly regard as vermin, to be destroyed at every oppor-
tunity, but Adelaide was by no means so far behind in this
respect as Sydney.
The large Carnivora are well represented and the climate
appears to suit them to perfection ; Lions, Tigers, Leopards and
Jaguars having bred successfully. The inside dens for these
animals are lined with white glazed tiles, and look beautifully
clean. Monkeys also succeed to perfection and most of the
commoner kinds have bred. Yaks, White-tailed Gnus, and
Camels have also bred ; and an old Indian Buffalo has lived
in the Gardens for twenty-four years.
The semi-tropical climate is excellent for a Zoological
Garden and most animals do well. There are some nice aviaries
recently erected. A large octagonal flight, about thirty feet in
diameter and about the same height, is fitted up with numerous

logs and branches of trees for Parrakeets, which have access to a
smaller brick building for shelter. Here were a fair number of
examples of the commoner species of Platycercus and Psephotus.
Near to this is another flight aviary for Finches, sixty feet long
by thirty feet in width and over twenty feet in height with a
shelter house of some fourteen feet square. This is occupied by
the commoner "Ornamental" Finches. A large pheasantry was
in course of erection at the time of my visit, each compartment
being thirty-six feet long by fifteen feet wide, wire netting of
f inch mesh being used in order to keep out the introduced
Sparrows which are such a nuisance in the Eastern States of
Australia.
There is a flock of ten European Flamingoes, all looking
exceedingly well in a fair-sized ornamental pond surrounded by
palm trees.
The Adelaide Zoo has a much smaller income than any of
the other Zoos in Australia, and taking this fact into consider-
tion, I think its condition is extremely creditable to its Director.

I took the afternoon mail-train to Melbourne, where I
arrived about ten o'clock the following morning. The journey
is not an interesting one as one sleeps most of the time, and only
a few hours of the journey are spent in daylight. Part of the
track is through sandy desert, and however careful one is to
shut every window in the railway compartment, one wakes in the
morning to find oneself and one's belongings smothered with fine
whitish sand. Few birds can be identified from the carriage
windows except such common kinds as Laughing Jackasses and
White-backed Magpies, the last of which were seen in numbers. I
identified Rosellas and Pennant Parrakeets and saw others which
I took to be Redrumps. Wood-swallows I also saw after passing
the Victorian border. Mr. Dudley Le Souef, the Director of the
Melbourne Zoological Gardens, kindly met me at the arrival
platform, and conveyed me in his carriage to my hotel. On the
way however we called on Mr. Archibald Campbell, the well-
known author of The Nests and Eggs of Australian Birds and
editor of The Emu , at the Custom House.

Mr. D. Seth-Smith,
The first place I was anxious to see was the Melbourne
Zoo, and early in the afternoon I wended my way thither.
These Gardens are well situated at the north of the city.
A cable train takes one out to the gates of the Royal Park, from
which a horse-drawn tram runs to the gates of the Zoo. On my
way to this institution I was much struck by the number of the
common Indian Mynah, one of the introduced species which
Australia could well have done without. This, together with two
other undesirable species, namely the Starling and the House
Sparrow, are the common town birds of the Eastern States of the
Commonwealth. At present Western Australia is immune from
undesirable avian aliens ; may she long remain so.
The Zoological Gardens of Melbourne occupy about fifty
acres, and are the oldest Gardens of the kind in Australia, as
well as the richest, with an income of some ^5,000 per annum, of
which the Government contributes some .#3,000. The entrance
fee is sixpence 011 week-days and one penny on Sundays. Most
of the ordinary menagerie animals are kept here, but I was some-
what disappointed at not seeing more of the rarer Australasian
fauna. Kangaroos are well represented, though the interesting
tree-climbing forms are represented by a single specimen of
lyUmholtz's Tree Kangaroo only. Wombats, Tasmanian Devils,
Kangaroo Rats, and Echidnas were on view, and a single speci-
men of the delightful Koala or " Native Bear" occupied a com-
partment of a large aviary. The Director told me that these
harmless and charming little animals are most difficult to keep in
*close confinement, but so long as they can have a large enclosure
and, most important of all, growing eucalyptus trees to climb in
and feed upon, they can be kept for a long time.
There is a large wire enclosure, divided into several com-
partments, each perhaps some thirty feet in length by somewhat
less in breadth. One of these contained the Koala, the others
being occupied by birds, mostly pheasants of various species. In
one compartment is the Brush-turkeys' mound, from which pro-
bably by far the greatest number of young Brusli-turkeys that
have ever been reared in captivity have emerged. The Melbourne
authorities claim that their success is due to their having dis-
covered the secret of the correct composition for the nest, a

secret which, by the way, is jealously guarded. I think however
that the secret is contained in the one word "climate." Brush-
turkeys have been reared successfully in the very adverse climate
of London, so there should be no difficulty about breeding them
wholesale in Australia, and doubtless the reason the other Aus-
tralian Zoos have not succeeded is because they have never really
tried.
Quails of the commoner Australian species were here, and
the Stubble (C. pectoralis) and Swamp ( Syncecus austialis) have
bred. Bronze-wings, Partridge Pigeons and Plumed Doves were
also in this aviary.
The Eagles' aviary, a circular building divided by numerous
partitions radiating from the centre, contained Wedge-tailed and
White-bellied Sea Eagles, while one compartment was occupied
by a fine pair of Mallee Fowl or Lowans (. Lipoa ocellata ), and
another contained a couple of hybrids between the Monaul and
Silver Pheasant.
The Waders' pond is prettily situated with a background
of bamboos, and contained several European Flamingoes, a pair
of Black-necked Swans and Spur-winged Plovers. The Flamin-
goes do not thrive very well, the Director's explanation being
that the climate is too cold for them ; but as they do well in the
colder counties of England, some other reason must be looked
for.
I noticed several specimens of the Australian Stone-plover
or Thick-knee (Burhinus grailarms&amp;apos;), as well as White and Straw-
necked Ibises.
Among the animals that have bred successfully in the
Melbourne Zoo may be mentioned Lions, Tigers, Leopards,
Brown Bears, several species of Monkeys, including the common
Marmozet, Crested Porcupine, African Tortoises, Tiger-snakes,
Ostriches, Emus and Australian Cranes.
I looked in vain for either the Platypus or the Lyre Bird,
both of which, I was told, have lived in the Gardens. There is a
small enclosure containing a pond with an island in the middle,
and this is labelled " Platypus Pond." I believe there was once
a living Ornithorhynchus paradoxus there for a short time.
Polar Bears, of which a fine pair are exhibited, do very

well in Melbourne, their house being built with a cool aspect and
containing a large bath in the centre.
The Owl cages were miserably small and not worthy of
their occupants, which included most of the commoner Australian
Owls, and some specimens of the Frogmoutli (. Podargus ).
The wild birds that frequent the Melbourne Zoological
Gardens are worth mentioning. The most numerous is the
European Tree Sparrow, next comes the House Sparrow and the
Starling. I pointed out to the Director that the great majority of
the Sparrows which infest his gardens are Passer mo?itanus , a
fact he had not noticed, and which struck me as somewhat extra-
ordinary, as the sparrows met with in the city itself were certainly
our old friend Passer domesticus. I saw the Goldfinch there also,
and Blackbirds and Thrushes. A pair of Laughing Jackasses
were proving themselves somewhat of a nuisance in the way of
swallowing young ducks, &amp;c., and Mr. Le Souef told me he
should be obliged, he feared, to shoot them. Honey-eaters were
often seen and occasionally the Common Wood-Swallow ( Artamus
sordidus), and the Tame Magpies* were often joined by wild
ones. The most interesting sight I observed there was witnessed
one evening, after closing time when, in company with the
Director and Mr. Archibald Campbell, I walked round the Gar-
dens at sunset. On almost every high tree were perched Nankeen
Night Herons ( Nycticorax caledonicus ) and numbers were flying
about. One huge Willow-tree was literally covered with these
quaint-looking birds, many of which flew up from the ponds as
we approached. Every evening they come here in hundreds,
and the sight was one to be remembered.
(To be conthmed ).
Quite a number of tlie hitherto almost unknown Black-cheeked
Lovebird (Agapornis nigrigenis) have recently been offered for sale by the
English dealers, who have we believe obtained them from Germany.

A hand-reared Snipe.
A HAND-REARED SNIPE.
Hi
The retiring habits of the Common Snipe render the study of its
habits when wild extremely difficult, and little is known regarding much of
its economy. The observations, therefore, recently made by Mr. Hugh
Worm aid and published in the January number of British Birds, on the habits
of a Snipe which he reared by hand from the egg, are of considerable
importance : and the successful hand-rearing of such a bird is certainly a
very creditable accomplishment.
The young Snipe was hatched in an incubator on May nth, 1908,
incubation having lasted twenty days, at a temperature of 102* Fahr. For
twenty-four hours the young bird was left to dry in the incubator before it
took its first meal. For the first two days of its existence, the young bird
ran backwards instead of forwards, which Mr. Wormald thinks is the habit
of the young birds in a wild state, and he has the corroboration of
Mr. Richard Kearton for his observation that young Snipe do not pick up
food for themselves at first, but take it from the bill of the parent bird. In
consequence of this habit the young Snipe had to be fed entirely&amp;apos; by&amp;apos; hand
for the first fortnight of its life, the food supplied consisting of small worms,
of which a large quantity were consumed. When the young bird had
learnt to take food itself it readily ate maggots and any&amp;apos; small auimalculse
that it found at the edge of a small pond, or in mud supplied to it in a pan.
On May 17th the first sign of feathers appeared on the shoulders,
after which the feathering was very rapid, the feathers on the tail and back
of the neck being the last to appear. The bird commenced to moult in the
last week of September by losing its tail-feathers; the outer pair being the
last to fall. The moult was completed a month later.
Mr. Wormald finds his Snipe very&amp;apos; sluggish, and believes that all
Snipe are naturally so when undisturbed. He proceeds: -- " He lives in a
cage in the smoking-room, and sits every evening on a board in front of the
fire. On being taken out of his cage and placed on the board his usual pro-
cedure is to give himself a shake (this he always does after being handled),
and then eat two or three worms, after which he retires as near the fire as
he can get, and 'suns' himself for some little time."
The extreme flexibility&amp;apos; of the bill of the Snipe is well known, and it
is well shown when the bird yawns, when the last inch or so of the upper
mandible is raised upwards. It enables the bird to grasp worms under-
ground without even opening the bill itself.
The tame Snipe is noticed to feed entirely by " feel," being unable to
see a worm right under him, but if one is placed two or three inches directly
in front of him " he catches sight of it at once and walks up to it, then feels
about with his bill until he touches it, when it is instantly swallowed." He
feeds both during the day and night time, and swallows a quantity&amp;apos; of grit
which can be heard grinding in his gizzard quite distinctly at a distance o

several feet. The hearing of the bird is very acute, and it is sometimes seen
to listen like a Thrush, then dive its bill into the turf and bring up a worm.
That the bird is extremely tame can be seen from the accompanying
photographs by Mr. P. If. Balir, which are reproduced from British Birds.
It will even "display " to its owner, walking round and round his hand and
uttering its spring note with tail spread like a fail.

Sir, --Though unable to give any hints from personal experience on
the keeping of different kinds of parrakeets in peace together in an aviary,
I think the subject of agreement and disagreement of different species of
birds, when living in captivity, is certainly one to be studied.
I have kept all kinds of birds together in just a flight cage of 4 feet
wide with a dome top, and it has been an endless source of amusement to
me to notice all their different characteristics, and the various ways in
which they regard each other--but, at the least sign of bullying I im-
mediately take out the offenders, and by careful observance, it is possible

to keep quite a variety of birds in a moderate sized cage in a sitting room,
if yon have not the means, nor the space for an out door aviar}'.
In an ordinary flight cage of the size I mentioned, I had a fine cock
Greenfinch, a cock Bullfinch, a yellow hen Budgerigar and a cock green
one, all living together in perfect harmony. I have had lately to put a
Goldfinch, which was with them, into another compartment for becoming a
general bully and a deadly enemy of the Greenfinch. But the favourite of
the community was a most attractive little hen Pekin Robin which, to my
sorrow, died quite suddenly after being ill only three days; she became
very tame, and would take things from my fingers, although quite wild
when I first bought her in a market in Brittany, where she was taken out of
a small low cage almost solid with tiny fluttering Avadavats, etc. Would
that something could be done to prevent such cruelty to birds sold in the
Continental markets, and which are bought wholesale from the ships which
arrive at Marseilles from foreign countries. My Robin and the green Bud-
gerigar became devoted friends, and would sit quite close together on a
perch, combing and preening each other, and carrying on a little rippling
conversation.
I have also kept Canaries with the rest, but had to take them out
because the Bullfinch drove the hen about so unmercifully, and the cocks
fought the Greenfinch.
I have suffered from having to leave my birds, while away, to the

I would not trust a parrot loose in a room with small birds which it
could touch. I have had no experience with them in an out door aviarv,
but have known a small Green Parrot which I had, to be most vicious in
attacking small birds and doves. Having got loose from its cage one morn-
ing I found it sitting most comfortably inside a small Bullfinch's cage, hav-
ing bitten and turned out the owner, it was perfectly unashamed and called
out in a triumphant voice " Pretty Polly ! " AqiCK Hutchinson.

Sir, --Our earlier Members will call to mind that in vol. III. of our
first series I record the fact that, being informed that the favourite food of
the Pine Grosbeak in Canada consisted of berries of Mountain Ash, I put a
bunch of these berries into the aviary in which I kept half a dozen of these
birds, that two of them at once flew down and devoured them and by the
evening were staggering about helplessly as if frightfully drunk, having no
sense of direction in flight, missing perches and falling heavily to the
ground; also, although before when I entered the aviary they would come
quite close and feed from my fingers they were now scared almost to death,
dashing themselves recklessly here and there: they had constant diarrhoea,
were too blind to find their seed, fell into the water pan, had frequent fits
and died miserably after two days.

Correspondence.
In 1902 I was violently attacked in The Feathered World , by one of our
militant members for concluding that the berries had anything to do with
the illness and death of these birds; his conclusion was that I was substitut-
ing propter quod for post quod. It was therefore with especial interest that
I received a letter from our member, Mr. E. J. Brook, in which he says : --
"Remembering that you told me that you had lost your Canadian Pine
Grosbeaks after giving them Mountain Ash berries, and seeing in your book
that these birds had all the appearance of being violently drunk after eat-
ing the berries, you may be interested to hear of their effect on some Black
Game. "A brother-in-law of mine owns some property in the Duinfrieshire
hills and a few years since planted a quantity of Mountain Ash trees as wind
screens. This year there was an enormous crop of berries, and one da)&amp;apos;, on
going to look at them, my brother-in-law noticed that a number of Black
Game that were sitting about on the grass looked queer. He approached
quite close to the birds and the wdiole lot of them, both cocks and grey liens
were " stupidly drunk." I quote his own words.
I11 a later letter Mr. Brook mentions that his Birds of Paradise have
been given Mountain Ash berries, about a dozen at a time, without bad
results. But he adds;--Possibly the numbers given were not sufficient;
anvway it is a matter of interest, and small points help to solve problems.
" I have just mentioned this to my wife and she tells me that people
staving with us in Perthshire have remarked that the Rowan (Mountain
Ash) berry jelly we have made to be eaten with Venison, seems to be quite
alcoholic. There is certainly no alcohol used in making the jelly."
It would be interesting to have a careful chemical analysis made of
these berries bv some competent man, to discover what it is which has this
stupifying and even poisonous effect upon certain birds, though apparently
not on others, while human beings are to a certain extent susceptible to its
influence. A. G. Buteer.

By Hugh Wormald.
The subject of these notes is so well-known now-a-days
that an article from me may be superfluous, but I have been
asked by our Editor to contribute a few lines, and that must be
my excuse.
As an aviary bird the Californian Quail is to be thoroughly
recommended, very hardy, readily tamed, easily kept, and an
extraordinary prolific breeder. They will do well and breed
freely in quite a small aviary, which should have a covered
shelter at one end, plenty of clean gravel or sand for the birds
to dust in, and some growing grass, the latter should be renewed
constantly when possible, for turf quickly fouls. They should
also be provided with bushes and perches, and in the spring
tussocks of high grass to nest among. I find that they thrive
well on dry "chick food" and green stuff, such as groundsel,
chickweed, etc. The young should be fed on ants' eggs, hard
boiled eggs, meal, and green food cut up small. It is a good
plan when possible to take their foster mother (a hybrid between
the Jungle Fowl and Silkie bantam for choice) in an open field
with a thinnish bottom, so that the chicks can roam about at will
and find insects for themselves.
The following is a good instance of their laying powers in
captivity. East spring a single hen in one of my aviaries laid an
egg every day from the 3rd of April, only missing three days,
until she had laid 144 eggs, very nearly all of which proved
fertile. Altogether from three pairs I got some 260 eggs!
I have at the present time an absurdly tame Californian

The Californian Quail.
Quail cock who lives loose in my office, he is really rather a
nuisance as lie will fly up into tlie typewriter while in use, or
on to the back of one's chair, and stroll about on my letters.
However, as soon as the weather improves, I am going to allow
him full liberty both indoors and out of doors.
I am told by sportsmen who have shot this Quail iu
America that as a game bird he has no equal, one of my
informants, a Scotchman, going so far as to say that he is
superior even to the Red Grouse ! But 011 this subject I am
unable to speak from experience.
This Quail has from time to time been turned out in
England, for example on Lord Malmesbury's estate at Hum, in
Hampshire, but they were not a success, for I hear that they all
disappeared, probably being freshly imported birds they
migrated, or attempted to migrate, or a few were shot.
This spring, however, I hope to send ten pairs and fifty
eggs up to Yorkshire. The birds are to be turned down and the
eggs placed in Partridges' nests. Since the birds have been bred
for three generations in confinement it seems reasonable to hope
that they have lost their migratory instincts to a large extent. I
trust that this experiment may be a success, though barring
Game Birds I cannot say that I am personally in favour of
liberating Foreign Birds in the British Isles. But I do not think
I shall be contradicted when I state that Hungarian Partridges
and certain Pheasants, such as the Mongolian (.Phasianas mongo-
licus) have greatly improved our native stock.
It may not be out of place here to make a few remarks
about hens used for hatching Quails' and other small birds' eggs.
By crossing the Baukiva Jungle Fowl with the Silkie hen, I have
obtained a fowl which I have used with the very best results.
This cross has all the good sitting powers of the Silkies and is an
excellent mother, having smaller feet than the Silkie and being
very careful where she puts them down. I used this breed
last year for hatching and rearing Grouse, Partridges, and
Pheasants, and found them excellent in every way, so careful
were they that throughout the season they did not break a single
egg. This will appeal to anyone who has gone iu for rearing
large quantities of any kind of game.

By W. H. St. Quintin, F.Z.S., M.B.O.U.
If not too late, I may perhaps be allowed to give some
account of breeding results amongst my birds last summer
(1908).
In the first place the Ravens beat all their previous records
by rearing five very fine young birds, which safely left the nest
and are now dispersed amongst various members of the Society.
As soon as February comes in, the old pair are impatient to
begin nest building. The hen alone feeds the young during the
first week. I have never before, in a season, had so many nests
amongst my Waterfowl. Except Shovellers, which have bred
here in other years, all the commoner freshwater British ducks,
as well as Mandarins and Carolinas, went to nest. The most
interesting kinds reared were Eider, Nyroca or White Eye, Pin-
tail, American Wigeon, and Garganey. Besides a pinioned birds'
brood, we hatched eggs found in a wild Garganey's nest
(recorded in " The Naturalist ") and reared six young birds.
A fine hybrid Tragopan, T. satyra x T. tcmmincki, was
reared, and is now gradually showing colour. I am not very fond
of hybrids, but having a fine male T. satyra and no hen, I mated
him with an unattached female T. temmencki. This and other
Tragopans' nests were, as in other seasons, built off the ground,
In spruce, or yew trees.
My poor old Snowy Owl, in spite of advancing years (she
and her mate were brought from Norway by a kind friend in the
summer of 1891) went to nest, and a young one was reared till it
was a week old. Then, unfortunately, as has happened more
than once lately, the female went amiss, and the young one was
neglected.
As with other Raptores, the burden of procuring prey, and
of bringing it to the nest falls, in the main, upon the male

Mr. R. Phillipps,
parent: while it is the business of the female to divide the food,
and to pass it to the young. In this case she was too poorly to
perform her duties. These Owls are very fierce when nesting,
and impatient of close observation : and unfortunately we did not
discover, till too late, that, though plenty of food was brought to
the nest, the nestling was not being attended to, and the poor
little thing died, of starvation I fear, literally in the midst of
plenty.
A brood of Capercaillie was hatched and the chicks hand-
reared to more than Quail size, when, as has often happened
before, they seemed to contract chills, and died apparently of
pneumonia, although every care was taken to prevent this.
I shall never cease to regret the misfortune that overtook
the fine brood which we almost reared in 1907, when, after
escaping the ailments that beset these birds when very j-oung,
they succumbed to enteritis accidentally introduced, and when
the cocks were beginning " to show colour."
Of all young birds that I have had anything to do with.
Capercaillies are the most tender and difficult. I have only
once succeeded in completely rearing them. Some four years,
ago we reared two fine females to the adult stage.

Agapornis nigrigenis.
By Reginald Phillipps.
When I wrote about this species last October, I wrote
" to order," as the article had to accompany an illustration, and
prematurely, as some points had not then been made clear, so a few
concluding remarks may not be out of place. But it must be
borne in mind that my experiences are drawn from only one little
flock confined to a narrow region and kept under restricted con-
ditions ; I find them remarkable in the readiness with which they
learn and fall in with the laws and customs of their new world
and adapt themselves to circumstances, and they may have
formed habits differinsr somewhat from those of the wild state.

Further Notes on the Black-cheeked Lovebird. 149
Doubtless, before long, however, other members will breed this
Lovebird, and it will become possible to compare and check
conclusions.
For, thanks (or very much otherwise) to the energy and
enterprise of the Germans, who in this as in so many other
matters put 11s to shame--will the bragging Briton never burst
through his chrysalis covering of conceited self-complacency and
wake up!--the Black-cheeked Lovebird is now common and a
drug in the market: that is, the British markets have been
flooded by the overflows from Germany, with the " leavings" of
the foreigners--What a proof of our greatness ! How proud we
should be !
But, to business.
As regards the sex of the Black-cheeked Lovebird, I sup-
pose it may be taken as accepted that the iris of the male is of a
lighter colour, a more yellow brown, than that of the female. I
find (see below) that the dark iris of a female squatting on her
eggs at the bottom of a log does not catch the eye as the lighter
iris of the male might do. I am still under the impression that
the colour of the under wing-coverts of fully adult examples
differ; those who keep their birds in cages, and can examine
them at will, may readi^ decide that point.
My Black Cheeks were admitted into the reserved garden
aviary in the autumn, and revelled amongst the living foliage.
There has been a great deal of bark nipping; but not a single
instance of an attempt at inserting strips amongst the feathers
has come under my notice; they are enthusiastic carriers of
materials for nesting and fortification-building purposes, but all
are carried in the beak.
How are we to account for this notable difference, and
other differences, between the nesting habits of A. roseicollis and
those of A. nigrigenis ?
Any one reading the rather detailed account of the nesting
of the former that I gave in July, 1896(0.8. II., 130-2) can hardly
fail to be struck with the difficulty those birds experienced in
finding a nesting-site which they considered to be safe and suit-
able (" artificial nesting places of every kind--logs, barrels, cocoa-
nut husks--all were ignored") compared with the readiness with

which the Black Cheeks go to nest in almost any receptacle that
may come in their way. O11 looking back, I find that, at that
time, I had Choughs, various foreign Jays and Pies, and also
Parrakeets and Lorikeets both large and small; and a goodly
number of these would have been able to raid any ordinary
nesting place. Can any influences of a similar nature prevail in
the regions frequented by the Rosy Faces which do not press
with equal force upon the wild Black Cheeks? Or is it simply
that the latter, with their advanced intelligence and superior
architectural genius and ability, while retaining so much of their
old ways as was good--to wit, the bark peeling--have burst
asunder and cast to the winds the ancient and worn-out shackles
of tradition and superstition which fettered their forefathers--the
necessity for carrying materials amongst their feathers (so as to
leave the beak free for climbing, ib., p. 132) with all the limitations
which that custom involved--and now extend their bark nipping
to twig cutting, and carry sticks, of necessity in the beak, with
which they keep the bark strips in position, construct a dome to
cover the nest proper, and thus make a really serviceable nest,
and both hide and protect their eggs and young? As I pointed
out before ( ib ., p. J31), it is not possible for a domed nest to be
builded with such limp stuff as chawed bark (the Black Cheeks
do not hold with chawing the bark too much); it does very well
for filling up the bottom of a more or less perpendicular shaft of
small diameter, but, under other conditions, is inadequate and
insufficient; and, when the cavity is large, the time occupied by
the female in carrying enough to form a heap is serious (ib. t
p. 132).
It is well known that, when in a small place, the Rosy-faced
female will carry (in her beak) sticks and almost anything to her
nest-hole ; but, as far as n^ experience goes, when she has access
to living trees, she will never carry any single thing but bark,
and that, not in her beak, but hooked on to the feathers of the
lower back and upper tail-coverts.
How different is the behaviour of my Black-cheeked Love-
birds! They carry, indeed, a sufficiency of bark to enable them
to form a splendid little nest, snug and comfortable--but their
forte is not bark- but cut ting and stick- carrying. With them

the stick is their life, the very breath of their nostrils ; when they
wake up in the morning, their first thought is of sticks; when
they go to bed at night, they repose in the midst of sticks, and
doubtless dream of sticks. When they quarrel, it is either over a
stick or because they havn't a stick to quarrel over. Tugs-of-war
occur every day, and many times a day, but they use not a rope
but a stick:--it is all stick! stick! stick!--they have sticks ou
the brain ! Mr. Astley objects to their name; they might truly
be called " The Stick-carrying Lovebirds."
Since their range has been extended to the garden proper,
they have deserted the birch brooms and gone in for twigs and
branclilets cut from the living tree ; all the same, when spread
over the ground on the feed, should one come upon a dead stick,
it is immediately seized and hurriedly carried off to its
destination.
P&amp;apos;or a time, there were leaves on the twigs, but the twigs,
with the leaves, were carried off as cut; to what extent they
approved of the leaves, which withered so soon, I cannot say.
After the fall of the deciduous leaves, they attacked a holly, so
the leaves would seem to have had some attraction for them.
The faded leaves, in some cases I particularly noticed, were
arranged so as to add to the general air of neglect that these
birds affect, when circumstances permit, around and about their
nest*.
Most of the trees in my garden at present are bushy limes ;
and by the middle of January every one had in a way the appear-
ance of a Christmas Tree--&gt;a tree with a something attached to
the end of each of its multitudinous branclilets. Several inches,
occasionally more than a foot, had disappeared from the end of
every branchlet, the terminal portion having been gnawed off,
leaving a ragged and untidy tip which produced the effect re-
ferred to.
When a bird has secured its prize, it flies with eager haste
* When shut off from the garden and leaves are not to be had, these birds frequently
carry millet stalks to their nest, and often fix a spray hanging out of the aperture of a log
or receptacle that has but one way of entrance and which cannot be stopped up, especially
if the hole be a little large or too much exposed.
This is manifestly not accidental ; and it occurs to me that they probably make use
of the sprays as the best substitutes obtainable for well-leafed branclilets--R. P.

Mr. R. Phillipps,
to the nearest bare perch, and thence to the outlet from the gar-
den, from which point there is a straight fly to the bird room
window. Here it momentarily pauses to arrange the branchlet
in its beak, and here it is usually attacked by a rival builder, and
many a tug-of-war takes place; but our little bantam is as tena-
cious of its stick as a bull-terrier would be and rarely loses it.
At any rate now, it is never balanced in the mouth as a dog or a
Bower-Bird carries a stick, but is grasped at the thick end--and
away our little friend hurries in a bee-line for its nest. The
stick, being held at the end, is dragged through quite a small
aperture into a log, the bird going backwards in tight places; and
in acting thus the Black-cheeked Lovebird exhibits a higher in-
telligence even than such a cute bird as the Jackdaw, who, hold-
ing a stick about the middle, will drop it over and over again,
and often abandon it, because it cannot manage to shove the stick
either crossways or sideways into the hole or crevice in which it
is building its nest.
With the Rosy species, I noticed that only the female
carried material. The Black-cheeked male sometimes helps his
mate, but to what extent he does so I am unable to determine.
Perhaps not very much, for I sometimes think that the female is
the larger and the more strongly built bird of the two, her heavy
work having developed her frame more fuliy, as is not improbable.
Since I last wrote, I have looked into several nests, some
built in upright logs with only a side entrance, but with a
revolving top for examination purposes. The sticks, placed
perpendicularty, were arranged all round the interior, leaning
inwards towards one another, so as to leave only a narrow hole
or funnel down the centre; and in the depths below could be
dimly seen the eggs all close together in a snug little nest of
bark. This is a common type of nest, especially where the
diameter of the log is small. One nest of the old mother, in a
large log with open top, was deserted before it had been com-
pleted, and the engineering work by which the roof was to have
been supported exposed to view. The structure was being erected
on the corkscrew staircase principle, and was being strongly and
substantly builded. In another case, in a tall log of small diameter
with only a side entrance open, there was such a nest as the first

one described ; a few days later, on taking a second peep, I found
that a " corkscrew" had been arranged, which to a considerable
extent shut off the interior of the nest from view.
Some of the nests have been built on concealed ledges,
and in boxes lying sideways. A vast amount of stuff is used in-
some of these cases, varying according to the size of the place,
but all of these are constructed on the same principle. The
receptacle is closed up towards the back by a wall or barrier, with
a regular glacis externally, only just a tiny hole being left, on
the most sheltered side, at the extreme top of the breastwork;
then an abrupt fall to the very bottom in the interior, where, in
a small and carefully lined nest, the eggs are deposited. The
second nest of the cripple (p. 36 of last November) was built in
such a box, in the garden, at the top of the open aviary. Then
came frost, the rime lying on the roof within a few inches of the
nest; and, fearing disaster to mother and child (three clear eggs,
one nestling), I took down the box. Being unable to insert
my hand from the front, I prised off the back, and the interior
was fully exposed to view, The brave little cripple, not able to
gather bark, had built the bulk of the very solid barrier of hay,
which was closely compacted together, the nest being as cleverly
lined with the same material as that of any Lark or other soft-bill
might have been. But in this as in every case sticks were like-
wise used, chiefly to top the barrier and protect the entrance hole.
I may mention here that I carried the cripple's nestling
into the birdroom, placing it in various receptacles, out of each of
which it clambered and hid itself away. Times without number
I drove the broken-hearted mother from where the nest had been
into the birdroom, occasionally shutting her in for a while, but
three days elapsed before she found out and recognised her lost
child. From the moment of recognition, she practically never
left it, and succeeded in rearing a splendid bird. For some three
days I had to mouth-feed this little imp ; and I am very proud of
m}&amp;apos;- foster child.
The eggs of this species vary considerably in shape, even
in the same nest: elongated and pointed and also short stout
ovals, and likewise the perfectly true oval, may be found. The
usual number of a clutch is four ; but the mothers would seem

Mr. R. Phiujpps,
to be in the habit, after disposing of the first clutch, to lay
immediately a supplementary clutch of three in the same nest,
which is not used a third time. But, with me, these supplemen-
tary young have seemed to exhibit a lack of robustness, and
certainly a lack of colour, the facial region not being dark, and
the breast patch only feebly represented by a faint smudge of
whity-brown--all pointing to exhaustion. On one occasion, I
came across a clutch of five.
As a rule, now that the birds know me so well, the females
sit closely ; but this does not always continue, at any rate in the
birdroom. One. thing they lack, like too many humans : they fail
to see the necessity for the cleaning of their living-room. In
their African forests, they got on very well without any old
woman coming along with mop and pail ; and they, or some of
them, resent the visit of the bird-woman, which they regard in
the light of an intrusion and an aspersion on their character.
Not always so, however. On one occasion, supposing that all the
birds were in the garden, I lifted down a log, and found in it
such a typical nest as already described. On peering down into
it, I paused, and might have exclaimed with R. B.--
"Wee, sleekit cowetin, timorous beastie,
O, what a panic 's in tliy breastie !"
but my timorous beastie, instead of starting awa wi' bickering
brattle, played 'possum as, with partially extended wings, she
concealed her treasures from my gaze ; but it was noticeable that
her head, extended down on the nest, was laid sideways, and that
one large dark eye was very wide-awake indeed. I gently re-
placed the log, and she did not come out. This was the fledge-
ling No. 2 referred to at the bottom of p. 34 of last November.
The same thing occurred this January with the cripple, who so
entirely disappeared that I feared she might be dead, but, on
examining her nest. I found her sitting complacently -- and
neither did she fly. And down the aperture of a rather exposed
log I now sometimes catch a glimpse of a tail disappearing, like
that of a rabbit diving into its burrow, save for the absence of
the white scut.
The cripple has no mate; and, when there is but one male
to two females, the course of events does not always run quite

smoothly. One day, during the time that she was sitting in the
garden, the old pair were seated on a high perch, cheek by jowl,
barely a yard away from the nest. Suddenly she came ont and,,
with all the effrontery and vulgar assurance of a Hagar, plumped
herself down on the unoccupied side of the male and solicited
food. Now a man is a very patient being, and can stand a great
deal ; but there are limits even to his endurance. When he is
alone, well, a visit from No. 2 may be endurable ; but for No. 2
unblushingly to link on to his left arm while No. 1 is hanging on
to his right is going a little too far. Virtuously holding his head
aloft in indignant protest, and looking painfully shocked, the
male slowly opened his mouth, and she, like a shot, dabbed her
mouth in. With all the suddenness of a steel trap, his mandibles
snapped upon hers, and she, in her turn, was caught. Dangling
in the air, in vain she struggled and kicked like any suffragette,
and something like a half-minute must have elapsed ere she fell
fluttering to the ground. Instantly gathering herself together,
she scuttled back to her nest with more speed than dignity ; and
many weeks passed before she again trusted herself to his tender
mercies. The incident, or rather its result, is of value as it
proves that a solitary female can and will rear at any rate one
young one without receiving the usual regurgitated food from
the male.
After young have left the nest, sometimes two will begin
to keep company at quite an early age; and when once two have
taken up with one another, although still children, they remain
true to one another, and almost immediately commence to set up
housekeeping together. Towards evening, they may be seen
hunting about for a suitable unoccupied sleeping box. If it
prove acceptable, they will continue to occupy and eventually
will nest in it. If they like it not, each afternoon they may be
seen searching diligently for a new place, until they find one to
their liking. Thus it is that, while they live in communities,
and regularly congregate and feed together, yet they scatter in
pairs over the forest in order to find separate sleeping and nesting
quarters. I particularly notice that each declared pair of birds
strive to the uttermost to settle down at some spot which is far
removed from any other home.

Why should the colour around the beak of this species be
so dark, so different from the brilliant colouring of the faces of
so many of the genus? The Masked Lovebird ( A. pet sonata) is
the only one like it in this respect, as far as I know, Fond as it
is of trees, it is also very fond of the ground. Sometimes my
flock of Black Cheeks will have disappeared, no trace of so much
as one of them in house or garden. Whither have they gone?
Then I become aware that the grass is being agitated by some-
thing other than the wind, and I find that the whole lot of them
are grubbing about under the grass, as a mole may be seen to do
if you are clever enough to catch him at it, sprouting seeds, etc.,
not insects, however, being the probable attraction. And even
now that winter is here and the garden so bare, they may often
be seen spread over the ground like a flock of Larks searching
for food or some aid to digestion. If their faces were bright,
the colour would become dimmed or marred ; consequently
Nature has painted them so as to suit their mode of life&amp;apos;. Even
cutting and carrying sticks is apt to soil the hands. Some
hypercritics may say that I have put the cart before the horse!
Well, we will not spend time, like our friend in the hollow tree,
debating in our minds which came first, the egg or the mother
Owl. It has all been most beautifully and suitably arranged ;
and our little friends the Black Cheeks, notwithstanding their
habits, always look clean, and trim, and tidy. Moreover, not
infrequently I see them tubbing in the ordinary washing saucers
on the ground, so no wonder their faces are sweet, and smiling,
and lovable.
THE HARDIHOOD OF GARDENER BOWER
BIRDS, ETC.
By Hubert D. Astley, M.A., F.Z.S.
During those dreadful days of fog and biting frost in the
last week in January, when the wind was in the east, and all was
damp and drear, my two Gardener Bower Birds proved their hardi-
ness. One remained out of doors, with the thermometer 2i v , and
the other kept in the roosting house with the window open,
where the temperature was only 36* because the hot air pipes are

but an off-shoot from the larger aviaries, and consequently do
not give out much heat. When the blizzard of snow came in the
last week of December, 1908; one of these Bower Birds sat out
all day on an exposed branch, having on his head a cap of
frozen snozv ! The bird could have sheltered inside had he
chosen ; but he did not choose.
I take it that these birds are very solitary in their wild
state, for they do not agree together, and if one approaches any-
where near the other, there are angry grating cries, not unlike
those of a Jay. They are extremely shy and untractable,
although the one that is always in the open part of the aviary is
becoming more docile. If however any stranger appears, the
bird is down amongst the bushes in a moment, and will sit either
on the ground or crouch beneath foliage, remaining perfectly still
and becoming quite invisible, it's yellow-brown plumage, that is
dark brown with a yellow tinge, assimilating closely with the
earth beneath it.
Birds that are very timid, sometimes become extremely
bold. I am hoping for this change with my two specimens of
Amblyornis subalaris.
I lost a splendid A. inornata , at least I believed him to be
of that species, through the bird dashing wildly out of a bush
against the wire-meshing; whereupon he died of concussion of
the brain. A great shock to both him and me!
He ; for a post mortem proved his sex ; was decidedly larger
than the other birds, and his loss was a disaster, as he was with-
out much doubt the only one in captivity, at any rate in Europe^
With regard to the birds at the London Zoological Gardens
being able to resist and thrive in the winter cold, as they can in
the purer air of the country, one feels doubtful. The air is un-
doubtedly not so clean, and the begrimed fog on their feathers
must to a certain extent handicap them. They cannot derive
the same benefit from bathing, and if they peck about in a grass
enclosure, they pick about on very grimy grass! One has only
to look at Town Cranes in the Zoo, compared with Country ones.
The former never look really clean and glossy, whereas my
Manchurians are white as driven snow.
My pair of White-crested Touracos have practically passed

the winter out of doors, both their plumage and condition being
in the perfection of that of wild birds. It is true they perch a
good deal in the roosting house which is warmed, but the large
windows are always wide open, and I have seen them hopping
and bounding outside from branch to branch on the coldest da}*-
in winter in evident enjoyment.
My extremely rare Purple - breasted Parrot (Triclaria
cyanogaster ) has passed the winter in an unlieated outdoor aviary,
along with a female Red-capped Parrot, both birds having a sheen
on their plumage which is generally only to be seen in wild birds.
I so seldom saw them, that I brought them into the house in
January, caging them in the conservatory. The following day
the Red-capped Parrot had commenced to pluck her breast; and
had alieady laid bare a patch of a square inch of flesh. Either
she was indignant at being imprisoned in such small quarters, or
else the unaccustomed heat irritated her skin. I liberated her
again and she at once ceased to pluck.
My pair of Queen Alexandra Parrakeets (Spathopterus
. alexandrce ) have also passed the winter in an unlieated aviary
with a sheltered house to go into when they choose.
A pair of Red-capped (Pileated) Parrakeets are in splen-
did condition, and are almost always out in the open in fog,
snow and rain.
A Tantalus Ibis from India is to be seen under the same
conditions, making use of a kennel to sleep in.
On the other hand, certain species of birds, such as
Curassows and Guans cannot be left out in hard weather as their
feet become frozen; and yet Pheasants and Peafowl are un-
affected in this way, and also Rheas.
In conclusion, one knows how much better one feels for
going out even in a thick fog and a hard frost, rather than sitting
in a stuffy room near a fire; how much more brisk one is in the
morning for open windows in one's bedroom. Many tropical
birds live at high altitudes, and experience cold nights and mists,
if nothing worse: and yet they are not always allowed even the
luxury of an open window.

Probably in Aviculture as in most other matters, one
learns as much from mistakes and failures as from successes, and
it is the knowledge that we can learn many matters from out-
failures, that makes our disappointments easier to put up with.
Do not let the beginner in Aviculture loose heart because
some rare and beautiful bird that he thought was thoroughly
acclimatised and safe, suddenly takes ill and dies, or is seen
lively and healthy one moment and the next is found dead on
the ground, such things have happened to all of us, and it is
from such " beautiful corpses " that we must learn lessons for
future guidance.
My own method when I find a bird dead, and the reason
for death is not obvious, is either to send it away for examination
or to skin it and place the body in 7 per cent, formalin or
methylated spirits for preservation till some medical friend
comes along, and then we examine it together and talk 011 any
disease or injured part we may find and discuss possible means
to prevent another such case.
A case in point was that of a very fine Six-plumed Bird of
Paradise that fell dead from its perch, examination showed an
annurism on the heart had burst. Nothing could have saved the
bird, but I learned from the condition of the body that the
feeding was evidently right, and so I knew there was no necessity
to treat the others any differently than I had been doing.
Last autumn or early winter I lost certain birds from lung
troubles. These birds were with others in various compartments
of a large aviary, and the ones that died had all been for some
months during the summer in a small aviary with a floor of
cinders where they were doing very well when I went to Perth-
shire in August. Early in October my aviary keeper noticed
that the birds in this small aviary were not looking well, so he
moved them, but they all gradually dropped off till only two
Gouldiau Finch cocks and one Toucan were left. The fault in
this case was undoubtedly housing the birds in an aviary with a
floor that was not impervious to moisture, all went well so long
as the weather was dry, but the exceptional rain of September

and October soaked the ground to such an extent that the air in
the aviary was damp and chilly. No more makeshift aviaries
for me.
It may be remembered by some readers of the Aviciiltural
Magazine that I have recommended barley water as a constituent
in the food for Lories. I may perhaps mention that I am more
than satisfied with this method of feeding. My Lories never
give any trouble and I should not be surprised if the milk in the
food could not be still further reduced in quantity.
THE DISPLAY OF THE MONAL PHEASANT.
By C. Barney Smith.
That metallic beauty, the Monal Pheasant, is by no means
uncommon. It is however not so commonly kept in captivity but
that I considered myself fortunate when, on the ioth of January,
I witnessed a cock bird give a striking courting display.
He lowered both wings, stiffened the copper-red feathers
on his neck to look like a small ruff, drew his bill under his chin
so as to display his crest better, and then crept slowly round a
grassy mound to look if the hen was observing him.
Finding this to be the case, he crouched low on the
ground, dropped his wings even further, and spread out his tail
into a fan-shape as far as it would go--which was a long way.
He then suddenly raised his tail upwards and bristled up all his
feathers, the head being lowered near the ground. He next
lowered his tail, still keeping it spread out fan shape, and
commenced such a loud rattling and rustling of all his feathers
(accompanied by a plaintive whistling) that I could scarcely
believe it was the bird making so much noise. He then closed
his feathers, except the tail (which he still spread to its utmost
extent) and gave several frog-like leaps forward in the direction
of the hen, stopped short, jerked himself suddenly right-about-
face, gave a flourish of his fan-tail in front of the hen, suddenly
closed his tail and then ran away.
Apart from natural interest in such grotesque movements,
two things strike me (i) whether it was not unusually early for
such courting display and (2) whether Monal Cocks when dis-
playing do not ordinarily keep their feathers closed.

During my stay in Melbourne, Mr. Archibald Campbell
very kindly arranged to take me for a delightful week-end trip
to a Station on the Penton Hills, owned by the Messrs. Brittle-
bank, two keen ornithologists of the best type who do everything
in their power to encourage and protect the wild birds.
On the 8tli of February, 1908, Mr. Campbell and I left
Melbourne by an afternoon train for Bacchus Marsh, about thirty
miles out, where we expected to meet Mr. Brittlebank and drive
out with him. However we received a message to the effect that
he had had to go into Melbourne and would be returning by the
next train. So we had some time to wait, which we turned to
account by going for a bird-observing stroll. There is a large
public park situated near to the railway station, and in this we
had ample opportunity of doing some bird-watching. We had
not gone many steps before we heard the characteristic pee-wee ,
pee-wee of the Pied Grallina or Magpie-lark, a family party of
which we soon discovered on the muddy banks of a small lake,
the water of which, on account of the drought, was very low.
There was an adult pair with three young ones, the latter
occasionally being still fed by their parents, though they were
very well able to take care of themselves. The male, with
his black face, was easily distinguished from his white-faced
mate and young. O11 our approach the entire family flew up on
to an old leafless willow stump, but as we remained still all flew
down again to the mud except the male, who kept guard on the
tree, every now and then, as he detected a movement on our
part, uttering loud cries and flapping his wings as a warning to
his family. Close at hand, as we sat on the bank of the lake, a
soft twittering came from a clump of thick bushes, which might
have been made by a party of English Gold Crests. " Malums "
whispered my companion, and I fixed my attention on the bush.
Soon two minute forms, with long tails held erect over their
backs, came from below the bush and hopped about quite close
to 11s on the grass, busily capturing tiny insects. Soon others

Mr. D. Seth-Smith,
came forth, and we watched a whole family of six Blue Wrens,
but not one in colour unfortunately, all of a soft brown, the most
dainty and aristocratic looking little creatures. The English
Goldfinches' twitter made one imagine one's self back at home,
and' as we approached a cottage the flocks of house-sparrows
that rose up reminded one more than ever of home. But the
illusion was soon dispelled .as a party of some dozen or more
"Yellow-tails " (Acanthiza chrysorrhoa ) flew up from the grass,
auda perfect cock Blue Wreu (Malurus cyaneus) appeared on
some low bushes in front of us.
The males of this lovely little bird seem to be very irregular
in the time at which they change their dress: some were com-
pletely in undress plumage at this time while others, such as the
solitary male above-mentioned, were in full dress. Mr. Brittle-
bank arrived after dark, and we drove out to his Station.
The following morning Mr. Campbell and I rose early and
went out. A short distance from the house the ground com-
menced to slope away to a creek with thickly wooded sides, and
towards this we made our way. White-backed Piping Crows,
or " Magpies," as the Australians call them, and as we will call
them here, were about the farm-buildings in numbers, looking
out for any chance of plunder. These are the only birds that
Messrs. Brittlebank do not strictly preserve as they sometimes
become too numerous and are nearly as bad as our Jackdaws are
here in the way of stealing.
We soon had abundant evidence of the drought which was
becoming more serious here than it had been for many years.
During the famous drought of a few years ago this part of Victoria
did not suffer; grass was plentiful, and sheep and cattle from
affected districts were being brought here to feed on the abundant
supply. At the time of my visit all of this was changed. Out-
side the rabbit-proof fence one looked in vain for grass. The
hill sides were bare red soil, from which the rabbits had eaten
every green blade. Within the fence the herbage was becoming
dried up, but there was still some left, and the rodents had taken
to climbing the fence, and were all too numerous within the
boundary.
As we descended the slopes towards the creek we came

into a region of birds innumerable. Wood-swallows sat above us
011 the trees or hawked around for insects. Tiny Spotted Parda-
lotes (Pardalolus punclatus) were busy searching the leaves of the
gum-trees for insects. Rosella Parrakeets ( Platycercus eximius&amp;apos;)
were numerous, and below, in the creek, we heard the notes of
Pennants (P. elegans.) The very merry note of the White-
throated Thickhead ( Pachycephala gutlziralis&amp;apos;) was constantly
heard and the bird seen. The charming little Blue Wren was
common enough, many males being seen in full plumage, but
these were often solitary, while at times a whole party would be
met with, all females or young males, or adult males in undress
plumage. With the aid of field-glasses the sexes can easily be
distinguished when in undress plumage, as the males retain the
bluish tail and have no reddish skin round the eye, a character
possessed by the females. I11 the creek we met with the Grey or
melodious Shrike-thrush ( Collyriocincla hartno?tica), one of the
best songsters in the Australian bush. Several Pennant Parra-
keets were seen, and I watched them for some minutes through
my field glasses as they fed on the seeds of various Wattle bushes.
Most of these were in immature plumage of green, splashed with
crimson.
A little bird that was quite common there was the White-
shafted Fan-tail, a charming and tame little grey flycatcher with
a conspicuous white eye-stripe. Another tame species which
was common here was the Yellow-breasted Robin ( Eopsaltria
australis ), somewhat larger than our red-breast, but quite as tame ;
a brownish bird with a pale yellow breast. We stayed here but a
short while as we had arranged for a long ramble after breakfast.
On our return up the banks of the Creek we listened to the
coo of the Bronze-winged Pigeon ( Phaps chalcoptera&amp;apos;), and saw
the little Red-browed Finch (AEgintha temporalis ), well-known to
aviculturists at home by the erroneous name of " Sydney Wax-
bill." Honey-eaters of some half-a-dozen species were identified,
thanks to my having as a companion one of the very best of
Australian field ornithologists.
Furnished with the very important billy can, and pro-
visions for our lunch, camera, and field glasses, the Messrs.
Brittlebank, Mr. Campbell and I set out early in the forenoon for

Mr. D. Seth-Smith,
tlie Werribee Gorge. We started down into the aforementioned
creek and followed the nearly dry stream bed until we came to
the approach to the gorge.
As we approached a large flowering Eucalyptus tree we
heard the note of Lorikeets, and soon discovered numbers of
these birds busily working at the flowers. Most were Muskies
(Glossopsittcicus concinnus&amp;apos;), but after watching for some time we
were able to identify several specimens of the Little Lorikeet
(G. pusillus). These honey-sucking Parrots are remarkably tame
and take hardly any notice of one, feeding industriously on the
flowers within a few feet of the observer. We watched this in-
teresting tree for some time as the birds kept arriving singly or
in twos and threes. The Eucalyptus trees are very irregular in
flowering, only perhaps a few scattered trees being in flower at
the same time in a whole forest, and these are sure to be visited
by the honey sucking birds such as Lorikeets, Wattle-birds and
Honey-eaters of many kinds. Pennant Parrakeets, mostly in
immature plumage, were common in this gorge, and allowed of
a fairly close approach. The little Red-browed Finch ( SEgintha
tempo?alis) was very common in places, but by no means easy to
see though their note was constantly heard. They nest all about
here, being especially partial to clumps of mistletoe which grow
in the Wattle bushes.
A Whistling Eagle (Haliastur sphenurus) flew past 11s, being
mobbed by a Brown Hawk ( Hieracidea o?&amp;apos;ie?italis ) ; the loud cries
of the Black Magpie or Grey Crow Shrik ^{Strepera ciuieicaudata)
came from the wooded sides of the gorge.
While we "boiled the billy" and did justice to the ample
provinder which our kind hostess had provided, we watched the
little Scrub-Wrens, small birds something like our Hedge Spar-
rows, Blue Wrens, Tree Runners, Spine-billed Honeyeaters, and
other small fry which appeared to take very little notice of our
presence.
On our return that evening we saw more rabbits than I had
ever seen together before. The station had been surrounded by
a so-called rabbit-proof fence of wire-netting let well into the
ground, and under ordinary conditions this is quite effectual, but
in times of drought, when almost every blade of grass outside the

fence is demolished, rabbits will climb quite a high fence rather
than starve, and we witnessed that evening what they had
done in this way. As we approached they ran before us in
droves, the majority making for the fence, knowing that their
home lay on the other side. We had no dogs with us but suc-
ceeded in capturing several rabbits with our hands as they ran
backwards and forwards trying to find an exit. There were one
or two black or sandy-coloured ones amongst the host we saw,
proving their descen t from tame stock. What would not the
Australians give to be rid of this link with the old country, this
introduced pest?
The species of birds we identified 011 this trip may be
perhaps worth enumerating as follows:--
Whistling Eagle ( Haliasiur sphenurus), Brown Hawk ( Hieracidea

Aidemosyne modesta x Poephila personata.
By H. L. Sich.
This bird was brought up entirely by a pair of Masked
Finches, neither of which I believe to be a parent.
On May 30th, 1908, I turned into my aviary a pair of
Masked Finches, an odd hen, and a hen Cherry Finch. I could
not get a cock Cherry Finch until July 7th. On July 30th, after
a lot of coaxing, this bird left the Masked Finch's nest, coloured
like no other bird in the aviary. The upper parts were dark
biscuit brown, the top of the head darker. Throat and chest
lighter brown, nearly white on the belty. Wings rather darker
than the back, especially towards the tips, as seen when the bird
was perching. Tail blackish, bill lead colour, tarsus and toes
pinkish brown. On the 31st a real young Masked Finch left the
nest, but it was not in good health at the time and died a few
days afterwards. It was marked much like its parents. The
other bird, being stronger and larger, probably got most of the
attention and food. The hybrid left the nest in very good
condition, it could fly well and had good legs and tail, it was
and is rather a slim long-legged bird, showing a great amount of
tibia beyond the body.
A description taken at the end of September shows the
parentage. It has the song of the Masked Finch, also the beak
is the same size and shape as in that bird. Mask black,
narrower than that of the Masked Finch, throat, breast and
underparts like the Masked Finch, but without the rose tinge;
under tail coverts and between the legs nearly white. The
black patch behind the legs has appeared, in front of which are
a few short black bars. On the sides of the breast are a few
short bars a shade darker than the ground colour, lower down
these mingle with the black bars. Tail very dark brown. Bill
flesh colour. Toes and tarsus brown.
On January nth I took down the following description :--
Mask rather narrow, does not meet on the top of the head.
Cheeks and sides of head paler than the crown. The bird looks
very much like a Masked Finch at a little distance, but the sides

of the breast are barred with short bars only a shade darker than
the ground colour, lower down some of them become black.
The black band is placed behind the legs and is reduced to a
patch on each side and mixed up with brownish feathers.
The tail is rather thin looking. The two central feathers
are a little longer than the others and the webs are very
narrow for the last I inch, a fact which I did not notice in the
Masked Finch until this year.
Bill very pale yellow ; from the base to the tip of the
upper mandible runs a dark line, almost a ridge. At the sides
near the base of the lower mandible is an orange-yellow
circular patch. Toes and tarsus dark brown. I think this bird
must be a hybrid between the cock Cherry Finch and the odd
hen Masked Finch, as the other two were nesting at the time.
It seems curious that this hybrid should now be coloured so like
a Masked Finch, when on leaving the nest there was hardly a
feather in common between them, especially as a young Masked
Finch is marked almost exactly like its parents. My Cherry
Finches nested, but during my absence the nest was destroyed,
so I have no young Cherries to compare my bird with. Un-
fortunately the mother of the hybrid disappeared one day.

The London and Provincial Ornithological Society held
their fiftieth annual exhibition of Cage-birds at the Crystal
Palace from Friday, February 5th, to Tuesday the 9th, and the
number of entries was said to be the largest ever obtained at one
of these Shows. There were some five hundred specimens of
British birds alone, and the judges must have had a very
difficult task. A fair number of birds in the British Classes were
obviously Continental specimens, such, for instance, as the
Waxwings, Grey Shrikes, Meadow Buntings or Black Redstarts;
but, as there was no special Class for Continental birds, and all
birds included in the British list are, presumably, eligible to
compete in the British Classes, there can be no objection to their
doing so, and their inclusion certainly adds interest to the
Show.

There were four beautiful Choughs ; and one of the Wax-
wings shown was as perfect a specimen as it is possible to
imagine. Grey Shrikes, Meadow Buntings, Black Redstarts, and
a Middle-spotted Woodpecker ( Dcndrocopus medius) were all of
great interest, though the last-mentioned bird, which is not
British, should not have been entered as such, and was rightly
passed by the judge. Tree-creepers, Goldcrests, and such like
mites testified, by their generally excellent condition, to the
skill of their owners.
Mr. H. T. T. Camps judged the Foreign Birds which
comprised an extremely rare and beautiful collection. His first
Class was that devoted to Lovebirds, Budgerigars, and
Hanging Parrots, and was remarkable from the fact of there
being no less than five pairs of Black-cheeked Lovebirds (Aga-
po??iis nigrigenis) present. This species, as most of our readers
are probably aware, was unknown in this country a year ago, and
the only museum specimens known were two skins at Cape
Town.* But it is no more a rarity, and can now be purchased at
a very moderate figure. One pair escaped from its cage during
the Show ; the female of another pair occupied her time by laying
eggs in the cage.
The Blue-crowned Hanging Parrot ( Loriculus galgulus)
was represented by five specimens, but there were no full-
coloured males amongst them.
In the Class for the Larger Parrakeets and Lorikeets
Mr. C. T. Maxwell's Black-throated Lorikeet (Trichoglossus
nigzigularis) obtained the first prize, but it is questionable
whether it deserved to be placed above the fine pair of the rarely
imported (3rd prize) Pileated Parrakeets ( Porphyrocephalus
spurius) belonging to Mr. Beaty, albeit these were very shy, as
these birds, unsuitable as they are for a caged existence, generally
are. The second prize went to Mr. Millsum's Black-winged Lory
a rare bird, but one has seen it before. Mr. C. T. Maxwell's pair
of Rock Grass Parrakeets (. Neophema petrophila ) (v.h c.) greatly
took my fancy. A few of these have been imported by one firm
of dealers within the last 3^ear or two, but they are really

Notes on the Crystal Palace Bird Show.
*extremely rare birds, and belong to quite the most delightful
group of Australian Parrakeets, of which some of the most
lovely, e.g., the Turquoisine, the true Elegant, and the Splendid
Parrakeets are, I fear, almost gone, and gone for ever.
Mr. Maxwell and Mr. Millsum each sent a pair of Stanley
Parrakeets (.Platycercus icterotis), quite the best of the Broad-
tails in my opinion, from an avicultural point of view. Other
good birds worth noticing were a Violet-necked Lory, a very fine
King Parrakeet, a Purple-capped Lory, and a Lineolated
Parrakeet.
The Class for True Parrots, Macaws and Cockatoos
came next, but there was no single specimen of either a Macaw
*or a Cockatoo present, and nothing very extraordinary in the
way of Parrots. The Rev. G. H. Raynor sent a very nice tame
little Meyer's Parrot which easily carried off the first prize. The
second prize went to a magnificent Grey Parrot which, when I
Erst saw it, was busy enjoying a mutton bone. Its owner said it
had a bone, and by no means a dry bone, almost daily, and he had
had the bird eight years. Certainly it could not have been in
finer condition in spite of a portion of its diet consisting of meat
which, we are told by some of our most learned friends, is about
as bad as it can be for Parrots, and certain to start feather-
eating !
A Black-headed Caique took the third, and a nice pair of
Blue-headed Parrots (Pionus me?istruus) the fifth prize. I could
not find the fourth prize winner--probably it had eaten its
card.
The Class for the commoner Waxbilus, Grasseinches,
Weavers, &amp;e., contained nothing of special interest, and I have
no notes regarding it ; that devoted to the raven species however
contained some interesting exhibits.
Mr. Maxwell took the first, second, fourth and fifth prizes
here with (i) a beautiful pair of Australian Painted Finches
{Eviblenia picta ) (2) his " Gaboon Weaver" which I mentioned in
my report on the London Cage-bird Show as probably being the
Sperviospisa guttata ; a black and red bird with a bluish tint on
its stout bill ; (4) a fine pair of Melba Finches, and (5) a perfect
cock Violet-eared Waxbill.

170 Notes on the Crystal Palace Bird Shozv.
Mrs. E. Galloway obtained third prize with a pair of the
charming little Scaly-fronted Weavers ( Sporopipes squamifrons )
from South Africa. Mr. Maxwell had yet another rare exhibit in
a pair of Fire-tailed Finches (Zoticegizifhus bellus&amp;apos;). These little
finches are extremely rare here, and these are the first I
remember seeing at a Show. Why the the judge only awarded
them v.H.C. is quite incomprehensible. They occur in the South
of Australia and Tasmania and are said to be very delicate and
difficult to import. I started from Tasmania last April with
eight specimens and only lost one on the voyage of seven weeks
and have not found them delicate, but for all this they are very
rarely imported. There were Parrot-finches, Gouldians, and a
nice pair of Australian Crimson Finches here also.
In the Class for Grosbeaks, True Finches and Buntings,
Mrs. E. Galloway secured the first prize with a nice Black-faced
Serin ( Serinus capistratus), the same bird that obtained similar
honours at the recent London Cage Bird Show. Mr. Maxwell's
charming pair of Cuba Finches obtained an easy second prize ;
while a nice pair of Indigo Buntings, the cock in winter garb
(Mr. W. Cook) came third. A pair of some species of Spermophila
belonging to Mr. A. Sutcliffe obtained fourth prize. There were
three specimens of " Yellow-browed Buntings," a pair of
Japanese Hawfinches, Green Cardinals, a Diuca Finch, and one
or two commoner birds.
The Tanager Class is generally an interesting one, and
on this occasion was no exception to the rule. Mr. Maxwell
carried off the first three prizes with (1) a Black-throated, (2) the
rare Red-throated and (3) a Spotted Emerald Tanager, truly a
magnificent trio, and all in the pink of condition. Fourth and
fifth prizes were taken by Mr. Townsend with a fine Magpie
Tanager, and a Tri-colour Tanager respectively. A second
Magpie Tanager owned by Mrs. P. Smith, was very highly
commended, an Archbishop Tanager sent by Mr. R. J. Watts
was highly commended, and an uncommon Black-cheeked
Tanager, belonging to Mr. O. Millsum, commended.
There were eight entries in the Class for Sugar-birds, &amp;c.,
and they formed a very interesting and showy class. Mr.
Townsend's fine pair of Black-faced Sugar-birds ( Chlorophanes

spiza ) here, as at the London Cage-bird Show, were awarded the
first prize which they well deserved. The same exhibitor's
Yellow-winged Sugar-bird (2nd prize) was in most lovely
plumage and condition and beautifully shown. A single male
Black-faced, owned by Mr. Millsum, came third; another Yellow-
wing (Mr. Maxwell) fourth, and a Blue Sugar-bird (Mr. Millsum)
fifth.
This Class contained perhaps the most delicate birds in
the Show and some of the most valuable, but they were placed
in the most draughty corner in the whole place from which even
thickly clad humans preferred to move on to the risk of catching
a bad cold. It was not to be wondered at that several of the
delicate foreigners looked anything but well on the second day
of the Show.
The last Class that I have to mention was that for are
OTHER species, and this is generally the most interesting Class
in the Show, though a terribly disappointing one formally of the
exhibitors. It was no exception in this case. There were birds
that had probably never before been seen on the Show-bench at
all, and the owners might reasonably have expected good awards
for them, but there was also present a King Bird of Paradise,
and although the species is quite well known to aviculturists
now-a-days, and has proved itself to be easity kept ; still the fact
of its being a Bird of Paradise practically ensures its receiving a
first and several special prizes.
Mr. Maxwell is the owner of the King Bird and so received
the first prize. A Touracou belonging to Mr. A. Burrows
came second. Considering what an unsuitable bird lor a cage a
Touracou is, the very fair condition of this bird possibly accounted
for the judge's decision. Mr. O. Millsum's " Rusty-cheeked
Babblers" ( Po 7 ?iato)hi?ius erythrogenys&amp;apos;) which took third prize
were very nice birds, as were also his White-spotted Laughing
Thrushes which took the fifth prize. A very perfect specimen
of the Niltava Flycatcher belongingto Mr. Maxwell was awarded
fourth prize. This is certainly one of the most lovely birds one
can wish to see. Next to it, but for some unaccountable reason
without a card of any sort, was a beautiful White-capped Red-
start belonging to the same owner ; a very rare bird and well

shown. Mr. W. Cook's Yellow-eyed* and Scimitar Babblers
were both almost new to aviculture and extremely interesting.
This was a wonderful Class, for there were several more
birds of great rarity and interest and one could not help feeling
for the exhibitors in their bad luck at receiving no prize. Mr.
J. Dewliurst sent a very good pair of Mouse Birds or Coley's,
most difficult birds to keep in clean condition in a cage. A nice
Black-headed Sibia was shown by the same exhibitor. Mrs.
Sandy sent a beautiful pair of Mexican Green Jays, Mr. Maxwell
a Blue-winged Siva,f Mr. Cushing a Pitta, Mrs. Frostick a very
fine Sulphur-breasted Toucan and Mr. Millsuni a Rufous-chinned
Laughing Thrush.
I was very sorry to hear from Mr. Maxwell that his Cuban
Trogon which caused a sensation at the London Cage-bird Show,
had died shortly after it was entered for the present exhibition.

Captain .Stanley S. Flower, in conjunction with Mr. Michael J. Nicoll,
has prepared a very instructive report on the Wild Birds observed in the
Egyptian Zoo. at Giza.
For the last ten years great care has been taken to encourage and
protect the wild birds in these Gardens, with the result that both species
and individuals seem to have increased considerably, no less than 166
species having visited these Gardens of their own accord. I11 song-birds
Egypt is not deficient as has been stated "a visit to the Giza Gardens when
the Nightingale, the Rufous Warbler and the Olivaceous Warbler are in
song will at once dispel this illusion."
The Report is divided into two sections, viz., Species of birds found
wild in Egypt, which have visited the Giza Zoological Gardens of their own
accord " ; no less than 155 species being contained in this list, and " Foreign
Species of birds, which presumably must have escaped from captivity else-
where in Egypt, which have visited the Giza Zoological Gardens of their

as far south as this to escape the rigours of their northern homes in winter.
The Olivaceous Warbler (Hypolais pallida) nests in large numbers in the
Gardens, and its sweet song is constantly heard throughout the summer.
The Graceful Warbler [Dryrnceca gracilis) is an abundant resident, and its
persistent note is one of the most familiar sounds in the Gardens.
The Goldfinch also nests there regularly, as does the House Sparrow,
Hooded Crow, Barn Owl, Southern Little Owl and Palm Dove, while the
Moorhen and Stone Plover have also reared young there in a wild state.
An extraordinary increase has taken place in the numbers of Night
Herons and Shoveller ducks which frequent these Gardens in autumn and
winter. I11 the case of the former birds 108 individuals were counted on
January 15th, 1901, 360011 December nth, 1902, and now it is impossible to
count them. Up to 1902 twenty was the largest number of Shovellers seen
on the lake. Now it is estimated that over 500 take up their quarters there.
Of the introduced or escaped foreign species the following list is
given: Amaduvade Waxbill visited the Gardens in August and September
1905 to 1908--and breeds there; Java Sparrow recorded 011 four occasions-
Spice Finch twice recorded; Striated Finch three times; Indian Silver-bill
two seen ; Common Waxbill twice seen ; Cordon Bleu twice; Madagascar
Weaver three times; Grey Headed Lovebird six times observed; Rose-
ringed Parrakeet probably breeds in the Gardens ; there are at least fourteen
birds, but six are known to have escaped and three have been liberated. A
larger Green Parrakeet, probably the Indian Ring-neck, has been observed
in 1902 and 190S.
CORRESPONDENCE, NOTES, ETC.
A BLUE ROCK THRUSH FROM CUBA.
Sir, --Along with a fine specimen of Mimocichla rubripes, the red-
legged Cuban Thrush, there was sent me, on approval, a Blue Rock Thrush,
whose identity I have not been able to discover.
It is said to be also a Cuban bird. Anyone who knows the European
Blue Rock Thrush, [or 'Chat,' to be nearer the mark,] can easily picture it.
A bird of exactly the same size, and, speaking generally, of a similar
colouring. The differences are these: the bill is longer and more Starling-
like, the feathers 011 the throat and upper breast being, as in the Starling,
narrower and more pointed than in the European Blue Thrush. The pale
powdery blue upon the head which distinguishes that bird, extends in the
case of his Cuban cousin to the throat and breast, whilst a broad black line,
shewing up quite distinctly against the surrounding silvered-blue, runs
from the beak through the eyes, and these are very distinctive, being of a
bright but rather deep orange-red.
I did not keep the bird because my cage-birds already numbered more

than I could comfortably do with, but I could see that, like his European
relative, he would have become very tame, and when in really good feather-
ing, would be decidedly handsome.
Now will someone let us know his exact name? In the index of the
Ibis I can find no Petrocincla, (which this bird undoubtedly is), mentioned as
being found in the part of the world from which he came.

Sir, --My pair of Quail Finches have made a nest, and incubation
has been going on for five days. Can you tell me how many days incubation
lasts? What would von give as food if the young ones are hatched. It is
very interesting to watch these sweet little birds--the labours of nestmaking
and incubating seem in this case to be reversed, the female brings the
materials, feathers and grass, the male makes the nest, and up to this time
it is the male alone that sits on the nest, but he has a way of leaving the
nest for an hour or two at a time while he preens his feathers and has his
meals; this makes me rather anxious about the hatching of the eggs.
The birds first made a nest between two pieces of turf which had been
placed in the cage. This spelt disaster, as the top piece of turf dried up and
lumps of earth fell upon the nest and broke the eggs. Then all the turf
except the bottom layer was removed and dry grass placed in the cage; the
birds soon built another nest just like a Wood Wren's, with a little opening
just like the entrance of a Wren's nest. You can just see the white marks
on the bird's cheeks and his red bill, l&amp;apos;he eggs now being incubated aie
four in number, and are pure white, rather long. Wii.EI am Ingram.
l&amp;apos;he following reply was sent to Sir William Ingram .
The period of incubation would probably be from twelve to fourteen
days. It will be very difficult to provide living insects at this time of year

and so you will liave to rely chiefly upon good insectivorous food, contain-
ing plenty of the best ants' cocoons procurable and good yolk of egg ; and
yon might give as many small mealworms as the birds will take while they
are feeding young. Even at this time of year the common annual flowering
grass can be obtained in places, and I should be inclined to provide as much
of this as possible. You might give the small Indian millet seed in addition
to the white millet and Canary seed. D. SRTH-SMITH.

In a letter to the Editor Mr. E. J. Brook writes :--"I am very&amp;apos; glad
to hear that the Paradise Birds at the Zoological Gardens are to have out-
side houses and flights.* I find that my Paradise Birds are most lively at a
temperature of between 40* and 50* Falir., but they do not seem to feel cold
at about freezing point. If the houses get too warm they get dull. These
birds should have plenty of shade in summer as nearly all of them dislike
strong sun.
I give all my Birds of Paradise (except the Six Plumed) some finely
cut up raw meat once a week, I think they are better for it. My "Lesser

PECULIAR COLORATION IN A LOVEBIRD.

Sir,--T he colour change in a hen Madagascar Lovebird seems to me
remarkable enough to record. After the moult last autumn it changed
completely, and instead of being all green it had no green about it at all.
Flying about in a large outdoor aviary&amp;apos; I could scarcely tell what colour it
was, only that its back and wings seemed dark, its breast ruddy', aud the
whole plumage of a bronze hue.
Not until it died, which it did about a month ago (it had been in the
aviary some years and was old, that is for a Madagascar Lovebird) had I an
opportunity of examining it closely', then I found that the back was trying,
as it were, to be black, the breast red, and the upper part of the tail feathers
orange. Surely a singular change in an all green bird! A few of the
little feathers were quite black, quite red, and quite orange.
It would have been interesting to see what another moult would have
brought forth ; it was in good condition so far as flesh was concerned, and I
wish it had not died. The cock, equally old, remains quite normal in
colour. E. A. H. Hartricy.
* Mr. Brook refers to the outdoor flight aviaries which are being erected 011 the south
side of the small Bird House, in which it is intended to keep some of the Birds of Paradise.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990276027777778" page_id="32659782"  page_num="176" year="" vol="">
Sir, --Residing as I do in Kent, the correspondence re Water Rails*&amp;quot;
has been of considerable interest to me, and I have often wanted satis-
factory evidence of their breeding in the County. In some of our marshy
ponds, adjoining old mill ponds, are many Water Rails, but beyond seeing
the tracks of their feet on the soft mud and hearing an occasional chorus of
squeals and grunts in the evenings their presence would hardly be expected,
and it very unusual to see one show itself, except by long waiting or when
put up by a dog. I can quite agree with Dr. Ticehurst, that to see so many
Water Rails feeding in meadow&amp;apos;s, and in one instance no less than seven
together, is an unique and I should think an unusual occurrence, and Mr.
Farmborough is much to be congratulated for having been the first to
be able to record such a one. t
There can be no question as to the Water Rail being common enough,
especially in winter, but I must disagree with the statement that the I,and
Rail is now a common bird, with I believe the exception of some localities
in the west of these islands. The Land Rail or Corn Crake has become a
rare, or comparatively rare, breeding species, mainly, I presume, owing to-
their being almost all annihilated year after year by mowing machines. In
the autumn a certain number appear, but in most localities very few breed.

THE ZOOLOGICAL GARDF 1 NS.
The very fine male Great Bird of Paradise, that has for some four
years been one of the great attractions in the Gardens, died quite recently.
The post mortem examination revealed no sign of disease, but every
indication of old age.
A pair of Cape Barren or Cereopsis Geese brought fiom Tasmania with
the Australian collection have a nest, and the female has been sitting some
time: and a pair of Australian Winking Owls (Ninox connivens) also have
a nest.
"THE WAXWING."-- a correction.
Page 115, first paragraph, line 3, should read : " It is circumpolar and
alone of the three species inhabits Europe, and, at irregular intervals, visits
these islands."
[* See Vol. VI., pp. 303, 347, and present volume, p. 112.]
[+ It lias been suggested by one of our members that the Rails that Mr. Farmborough
saw feeding in the meadows must have been young Moorhens.--En.]

The Hermit Thrush, known as the Eastern Hermit
Thrush, to distinguish it from Audubon's Thrush, and the
Dwarf or Unalaska Thrush, which closely resemble it ; con-
stitutes the Eastern race of North America.
It is said to have occurred in Heligoland, in Germany, and
in Italy, Its breeding range extends over a wide area, for it has
been found nesting in British Columbia round Lake La Haclie.
It breeds from the Northern United States northward, and
winters according to Mr. Ridgway (" Manual of North American
Birds") from about 40* to the Gulf Coast. In Manitoba it is a
common summer resident, and it has been recorded in Ontario in
spring and autumn.
Dr. Hart Merriam found it nesting near Points de Monts
in Quebec, and it is common along the south shore of Labrador
and again on Anticosti Island.
Mr. Dwight, in his paper on the summer birds of the
Pennsylvania Alleghanies, writes as follows :--" Among some
" scattered pines at the top of Wopsonouock Mountain I found

" a pair feeding their young. As the abundance of this species
" can best be determined about sunset, when every male is
" pouring forth its evening song, I cannot say how abundant it is
" at this point. Often it was possible to distinguish a dozen
" singing at the same time in the early morning or the late
" evening hours."

writes:--" Great injustice would be done were the Hermit's
" musical powers overlooked in any sketch, however slight, of its
" life history. The earlier authors were evidently unaware of
" its accomplishments, for its melody is lavished on the gloom
" of the swamp, or lost in the darkening aisles of the forest,
" where years passed by before the ear of the patient and toiling
"student of nature was gladdened by the sweet refrain.
"Wilson denies its song; Audobon speaks of ' its single
" plaintive note.' "
" Nuttall seems to have first recognised the power and
" sweetness of the lay of our Hermit: he compares it to the famous
" Nightingale, that sweet princess of song, and ranks it far above
" the Wood Thrush. Later writers agree in this high estimate of
" the bird's powers.The weird associations of the spot
" where the Hermit triumphs, the mystery inseparable from the
" voice of the unseen musician, conspire to heighten the effect of
" the sweet, silvery, bell-like notes, which, beginning soft, low,
" and tinkling, rise higher and higher, to end abruptly with a clear,
" ringing intonation."
In another place the same author writes :--" How quietly

" the ground or near it, generally in some secluded low spot ;
" no mud is used in its composition, the whole fabric being a rude
" and inartistic matting of withered leaves, weed stalks, bark
" strips, and grasses--the coarser and stiffer substances outside,
" the finer fabrics within. The cup is small in comparison with
" the whole size, owing to the thickness of the walls and of the

Veery."
I am quite in love with my Hermits, of which I have five.
Graceful in their movements, they are also extremely fearless
-and gentle, as well as apparently hardy in captivity, for two of mine
have passed the winter in an outdoor aviary, and I have seen
them bathing when the sun was setting on a gloomy afternoon
in December or January. They keep themselves in beautiful
condition, looking sleek and compact.
In my bird-room one of them will hop about as un-
concernedly as if he were in the depths of his far-off forest
home, ever watchful for the opening of the mealworm or cock-
roach box, flitting to one's feet witli noiseless wings, his large
brown eyes expectantly watching.
In January one Hermit commenced to sing, of course he
sang sotto voce , but there were the sweet pure tinkling notes and
stanzas ; short stanzas following quickly one upon another, yet
uttered very deliberately; a voice quite unlike any of our
English birds.
Another of my Hermits suddenly commenced to moult
in January, a complete, quick, healthy moult ; which I presume
was an abnormal one, yet his food is the same as that of the
*others, although it is true that he lives in my sitting-room where
the temperature in winter is higher than in the bird-room.*
Viewed from the back, a Hermit Thrush when hopping on
the ground is exceedingly like a Nightingale, both in colouring
and style, only rather larger.
* Since writing- this account another Hermit Thrush has moulted in February.
The change of feathers has been a complete one, so that one may presume the vernal moult
to be normal in this species.
Usually when birds have a fresh plumage in the spring, there is a change of colouring,
as in the case of the Rock Thrush (Petiocincla saxatilis ), but if I remember right, the
primaries and tail feathers are not shed, which are so with the Hermit Thrush. In the
latter species however there is no marked change of colour, the breast spots maybe some-
what larger and bolder, though on the other hand, this may be due to the freshness of the
feathers.
Again, as I have only had my Hermit Thrushes since the commencement of
November, 1908, I have had no opportunity of observing the autumnal moult. The vernal
moult may possibly be a little premature with the caged birds, for the two out-of-door
birds have shown no signs of casting their feathers up to the time of writing [Mid-
February] and I have been out of England since then.

180 Mr. Hubert D. Astuey,
The Hermit has the same length of shank, and the same
carriage. It is curious that these beautiful little Thrushes have
scarcely ever been imported to England in days when such
importation was permitted, for they can be captured in fair
numbers on the autumnal migration.
As a single cage pet I can really imagine no bird more
charming in every way. They are very steady in a cage and do
not knock their tail-feathers about as is so often the case with
Nightingales.
The call-note of this species is a pretty low "chuck." The
male is perhaps slightly longer than the female, but it is
extremely difficult to distinguish the sexes apart.
My Hermits feed on an insectivorous mixture, a very
excellent one supplied by Mr. Galloway, of Caversham, but like
all insectivorous birds, fresh insect food is necessary for their
welfare ; not many mealworms, but cockroaches, gentles, flies,
spiders, wood lice, etc., and also fruit. They are very fond of
grapes, skinned, and cut into very small pieces, which can be
mixed with their every day food.
One of my Hermits most unfortunately had a wing&amp;apos;
broken : it was one of the outdoor aviary birds. Something had
probably chased him, and the wing was perhaps knocked during
flight against a bough. I brought him into the house and for
some days tried in vain to support the broken member by tying,
it up. I passed some soft knitting-wool round his body in front
of the legs, underneath the uninjured wing at the back of the
shoulder and over the broken one, tying the ends of the wool
firmly together. The little Thrush was quite undismayed under
such treatment, and hopped back into his cage when I loosed
him from my hand at the door of it ; he took up his position on a
perch and looked at me very deliberately. I went out of the
room to return in five minutes. The strand of wool was lying in
the sand, and the little Hermit was sitting on his perch with his
drooping wing, looking at me as if he were Maskelyne or Cook,
ready to make his bow after having been firmly tied up with
ropes before his audience, and having stepped out free again ! I
tried him again with silken thread, but again he picked it off,
shook out his ruffled feathers and remained unshaken himself.

But I conquered at last, fori wrapped him round with a strip
of plaster, plaster which adheres to itself directly the gummy
sides come in contact with each other, and the wing mended,
but it droops somewhat, as it had no doubt commenced to set
before I was able to support it in its right position. It was
fractured, a simple fracture, at the shoulder.
Wilson's Thrush, known also as the " Veery," and the
" Tawny Thrush " is not really perhaps a larger bird than the
Hermit, but a slightly lo?iger, that is from 6'8 inches to 7, whilst
the Hermit is from 6'4 to 67 inches, according to the sexes as a
rule. Its habitat is much the same as that of T. pallasi. I have
two, which I hope and believe are male and female. In their
nature and temperament, they closely resemble the Hermit
Thrush, sitting unconcernedly when out of their cages in the
birdroom, close to one and often watching one's movements with
apparent interest.

of North America," I have quoted writers, such as Mr. Nehrling,

writes:--" The Veery's mating and nest-building season, when
" the bird is in full song, is the genial month of May, in most parts

Mr. Hubert D. Astley,
" wooed is won--the home is made. Should we force our un-
" welcome presence upon the bird who is brooding her newly-
" found treasures with the teuderest solicitude, she will nestle
" closer still, in the hope of our passing by, till we might almost
" touch her ; when, without a word of remonstrance or reproach,
" she takes a little flight, and settles a few yards away, in silent
" appeal. If the time, the place, the scene, suffice not for our
" forbearance, with what poor words of hers may we then be
" moved ?
" The nest will be at our feet, most likely beneath some
" bush, resting upon a bed of leaves, or supported in the forks
" of some stems which spring directly from the ground. It
" seems large for the size of the bird, and perhaps not so neat
" and finished as we might expect ; for the Veery, though a
" patient and faithful housekeeper, cares little for appearances*
".The nest may contain four, perhaps five eggs,
" like those of the Hermit-Thrush, greenish-blue, without
" marking, except in rare instances, when a few specks appear,
" specially about the larger end.
" Varying estimates have been made of the Veery's powers
" of song. For myself, I rate this bird as one of the sweetest of
" our songsters, of whose clear bell-like notes, resonant, distinct,
" yet soft and of indescribable sadness, I have spoken on a&amp;apos;former
" occasion."

I nearly lost one of my Veerys on board the " Lusitania,"
in spite of the great kindness of the purser, who gave over to me,
key and all, a pantry in which to keep my birds. The delicately-
made and aristocratic little Thrushes were unused to being
huddled together in a stuffy travelling cage along with Cat Birds,
Blue Birds, etc. ; besides which if my poor Veery was anything
like oneself, that horrible slow and determined roll of the huge
ship deprived him of his appetite. Anyhow he sat huddled in a
corner, so that surreptitiously I contrived to convey him to my
cabin where his wants could be attended to, and where he could
rest in peace. Undoubtedly had I not done so he would have
succumbed, and I realised how difficult it must be to bring home
birds which have to be caged up on board ship for several weeks

instead of for one, and under circumstances far less advantageous
to their welfare. I had another anxious experience and a
mauvais quart d&amp;apos;he 7 ire of a different kind when my American
birds were first brought on board at New York. The keeper was
seeing that they had water to drink, when a hen Blue Bird
slipped out of the cage-door and fled off round the huge kitchen
of the "Lusitania," which happened, as it generally does happen,
to be overflowing with head cooks, under cooks, pastry cooks
and scullions. The Blue Bird flew over them, and I through
them, dimly conscious of being dangerously near to knocking
some of them over, and of the clattering of kitchen utensils
which stood in my path. Fortunately I managed to keep the
fugitive in sight by doubling as the Blue Bird doubled, and
finally ran her to ground in a large but dark aperture in the
wall which seemed a receptacle for lead pipes and various pieces
of matting. I had to clamber on to the dresser and could then
only grope blindly in dusty unseen corners. I had begun to
despair, when I thought I felt feathers ! Squeezed under a pipe,
which was by no means cold, was the Blue Bird ! She seems
happy enough now in an outdoor aviary, where she, along with
others, has passed the winter.
I feel relieved indeed that the two species of beautiful
little Thrushes, about which I have written, are apparently so con-
tented in captivity. Had they fluttered against their cage bars
or moped, one would have hated to have brought them from
their native land across the desert of water. I hope they, like
other birds, live in the present with no memory of the past. No
memory of still shady forests and dells luxuriate in moss and
overshadowing ferns, where streams trickle and deer mice leap.
No memory of tales that were told of their forbears who tinkled
their bell-like and silvery notes as the Red Indians bivouacked
near by, or crept stealthily on moccassined feet through the
dense underwood. The Indians have all but gone, and the
forests over many a mountain and vale have been felled, but the
people of that great country are waking up to a sense of their
responsibilities, and with that let us hope to sympathy for their
birds, of which they may justly be proud.

SOME GREAT BUSTARDS.

Seven years ago when we came to live in Hampshire our
first care was to make a home for Flamingoes and Great Bustards.
We made it out of two pieces of kitchen garden, separated by a
gravel walk. One piece was to remain as the birds' lawn, the
other to be transformed into " hills, valleys and lake " (literally
banks, hollows, and a little wading pool).
It was not an easy job, for we had to work down, first
through clay, then through chalky gravel and then through
flints, shaping the banks and levels as we went, till we found the
water. It took four men and two horses most of the winter to
do it ; and when they had finished it looked like nothing so
much as a working at Kimberley, but almost dirtier and more
depressing. As soon as it had dried out sufficiently the
gardeners came in and sifted it over with fine soil, and by the
summer it was covered with light short grass (Feshica ovina
var, tenuifolia).
It soon began to look quite a pretty little place. In order
that the birds might feel at home it was planted with things from
Spain and Morocco. Cistus grew there, Spanish and Moorish
Broom, Rosemary, wild Lavender, Asphodel, and the little Blue
Iris of the Hastern Mediterranean. The big outer bank was soon
covered by a dense low growing Sunflower (Harftcdium rigidunt),
smaller ridges by wild Thyme and wild Pink ( D . deltoides),
while elsewhere Bamboo, Tree Lupins and Bog Myrtle formed
excellent shelter. In one corner a forest of Jerusalem artichoke
made an admirable screen, useful even after it was dead. The
retreat was so arranged that blow the wind whence it might
complete shelter was always obtainable by the birds. The
banks were extra high against the South-West, the quarter of
our prevailing wind, which birds and plants so much dislike.
Then the Flamingoes came ; but as we were still without
Bustards we went off to Andalucia to see what we could find.
Though not successful in obtaining any captive birds we arranged
with Vicente Saccone, of Coria del Rio, to raise us some from the
nest.

Time went on and we heard no more. But in the spring
of 1907 I happened to meet Vicente, in Seville, and he told me he
had two hens read}&amp;apos;-, which he had reared by hand. This good
news made me look with still greater interest not only on the
wild birds on the cornlands, but also on a fine lot that walked
about a beautiful garden in Jerez de la Frontera. They came to the
steps every morning to feed from a lady's hand, and were quite
indifferent to the presence of the two great Spanish mastiffs and
the terrier that shared their food. They belonged to Mr. Walter
J. Buck, well known as one of the authors of that delightful
book Wild Spain.

Soon after my return home I received a letter from Mr.
Buck saying that he was sending with Saccone's hens the finest
male bird from his own collection. My delight at this generous
present was however soon to be damped by a letter in which
Vicente said he was despatching the hens, but that the male was
so seriously ill that he was keeping him back.
The hens, two beautiful birds, duly arrived. One had been
hatched in 1904, the other in 1905. This bird was smaller
than the former and had a brown nape and top to her head, but
she lost these feathers at the next moult and assumed the
lavender head of adult life.* Some weeks went by and then the
* Mr. St. Quintiu informs me that a hen bird in his possession, nearly twelve years old,
has a " rufous fawn nape and top to her head"

Mr. Aubyn Trevor-Battye,
male bird came. He was extremely weak and in very poor con-
dition. From the first he would never go to the bowl for food,
though he would take from the fingers pellets of poultry food and
barley meal, but often I had to make much demonstration in
front of his face before he would open his mouth.
The enclosure was full of weeds, such as hawkweed, which
others have found that Bustards like, and a fresh cabbage was
always kept for them, tightly fastened down so that they could, if
they so chose, pull at it satisfactorily. For a long while, however,
they would not touch green food, but were absolutely ravenous
for mice. Unfortunately after two years of vole plague our voles
and garden mice had become so scarce that there was great
difficulty in supplying their wants. So I had to initiate a Parcel
Post Mouse Service with farms that lay at a distance, and
regularly each morning the little boxes containing two dozen
came in with the letters. The price at first was4d. the dozen, but
later rose to 6d. To give an idea of a Bustard's mouse capacity I
may say that one day following a " sheening " (this is Hampshire
for a threshing) the school children kept coming with little
bundles of mice till the mice totalled 150 ; yet the three birds
polished them all off while still quite fresh, and this in the hottest
weather. The diet was varied with nestling Sparrows, but mice
they liked best. At no time would they eat any cut up rat or
mole. Given a small and tender rat about the size of a field
mouse they would eat it, but cut up pieces they would only pick
up and drop again, sometimes making a half angry, half fearful
noise as they did so. The sight of blood is evidently disturbing
to a bird which never breaks up its food, but bolts it whole.
I had forgotten to say that at first the birds ate a great
many earthworms. The smaller worms they swallowed at once,
but the very largest lob worms they would first pinch, and would
occasionally shake one violently from side to side, holding it by
the head, and sometimes barking at it. I used to think they
took these big worms for snakes. Yet they never caught a
grass snake who lived in this enclosure. Under a secondary
bank was some thorn and bracken in which Quails and
Partridges nested. Here four years running a Willow Wren
brought off her young. This summer the snake took one of the

young Willow Wrens in its mouth, and the gardener, attracted
by the demonstration of the old birds, rescued it only just
in time. The snake retreated through the bracken into a
mole's run in the bank. I always thought that sooner or later
the Bustards would kill that snake, but they never did. They
* caught many moths, and were always picking up out of the grass
some infinitesimal objects which one would not have supposed
it worth their while to trouble about. They always refused dor
beetles.
So we nursed the male Bustard into something like better
health, but he was always light, flat-chested, and a poor thing at
the best. Then his heart began to go wrong, and he would sit
I down with palpitations. At a distance of three paces or more yon
could hear his heart knocking like taps on a kettledrum. Then
he took to falling over from seizures of the heart, which naturally
frightened him very much. We righted him several times and
he rallied more or less, but one morning he was dead in their
house.
To return to the hens. When they first came they were
exceedingly shy and never ventured out into the open, but hid in
the artichokes. One could always find them there, squatting close
to the ground, their necks stretched out in front in the manner
of the Thick-knee. When roused they would walk or run along
close against the wire netting. At first the only way they could
be got to feed was by rousing them gently and then throwing
pellets of food into the run in front of them. By the end of
about ten days or a fortnight they were taking food well from the
hand but even then, feeding over, they would again move away
and hide. But that gradually wore off, and from extreme
shyness they passed to great boldness, mixed, for 110 evident
reason, with sudden fits of panic. When being fed they would
suddenly utter their grunting bark of alarm and move away.
I had not pinioned them but had cut all the primaries
excepting two from one wing of either bird ; but the Great Bustard
is remarkably powerful in its wings and this proved to be in-
sufficient, as shall be told.
They were constantly practising flight, running like
Ostriches with outspread wings. One day in a higher wind

than usual one of the hens was heard by the gardener flying. She
flew the length of the enclosure, passed over the high wire
netting, over a run inhabited by five eager greyhounds (into
which most mercifully she did not drop) and disappeared from
view. The alarm given, I picked up a cloak and ran out. Three
men and I scoured the land that lay between the garden and the
river half a mile away. In particular we spent much time in
searching every yard of a rough tussocky hummocky stretch in
which even an Ostrich might be invisible. All this to no purpose.
But as we returned disappointed we suddenly came upon her in
the only spot we had not yet searched, in a rough bit of grass
by the side of the cricket ground not 150 paces from the garden
fence. There she was, flattened down on the ground with
outstretched neck, and curiously invisible till you come right
upon her. The cloak was dropped over her, she was carried
back and both birds were immediately pinioned.
On February nth, 1908, I received from His Grace the
Duke of Bedford the kind gift of a male Great Bustard, and as I
hope that before long he may be the father of a family I may here
say a little about him.
I consider him the finest example of this noble species I
have ever seen in captivity. I have seen larger birds (the male
in the Zoo. is larger) but for vigour, smartness and hard condition
I have never seen his equal. He has been in fighting humour ever
since he came, and although after the breeding season he lost
his ruff and whiskers, he has kept up his display all through the
year. Even on that Wednesday, the coldest day of the year,
taken with a fit of vanity he reversed his feathers over his back
and turned about like a weather vane.
From the first he has been extremely bold, and has never,
like the others, been the victim of groundless alarm. At night
when it threatens wind and w r et we always walk the others into
their shelter. But this male bird has never allowed himself to be
driven ; lie stands his ground and will not budge an inch. We
have two ways of getting him into the shed ; either by offering
him a cap, on to which he immediately fastens, and so is led
along, or by allowing him to seize a corner of one's jacket or
fold of one's knickerbockers, when he will push one back and

back until at last be has pushed one into the shed. There one has
to disengage oneself as best one can, escape, and close the door,.
He pushes with his breast, bringing his whole weight against one
with surprising force. (Bustards of course fight exactly as
Turkeys do : they interlock their bills and then bear against one
. another.) He attacks anyone who enters the enclosure. There
are two apple trees on the Bustards' lawn, and while one gardener
was gathering apples another had to keep guard. His method of
attack is always the same. As soon as anyone enters the
enclosure he comes up at a run and confronts him. Then lie
halts and gradually works himself up into a rage ; when this is at
its height his wings droop, their shorter feathers are erected, and
his tail and certain body feathers point forward. He is ready
for combat. The next move is to advance sideways and " lay for
a chance." If you turn away a little, or even if your attention
is momentarily diverted, he whips round, lowers his head and
charges home. A nip from his strong bill is very effective.
This fighting transformation, which is continued through the
autumn and winter, is precisely that of the spring display,
excepting that the neck is not distended, nor the head and neck
retracted.
He has one little game which always amuses me. The
bird's accustomed position is on the highest part of the outer
bank at the point marked B. Here they have, as it were, their
citadel ; to this point they have made runs through the dense
Harpalium , and here they spend most of the day preening their
feathers, dusting themselves, and looking out across the river on
to hills once tenanted by others of their race.
Well, when I enter the enclosure the male runs up and
challenges as usual ; but if I spend some time cleaning up the
shelter house he gets tired and finds his way back to the
acropolis. When I have finished and leave the house he comes
down the bank, and lowering his head runs along out of sight
under cover of bank D, so as to head me off before I can get to
the gate. Then suddenly he comes bouncing out at the end of
the bank and often gets between me and the gate, and cuts me
off, laughing his hoarse laugh. He most evidently enjoys this

This guttural laugh of the male is one of the only three
sounds I have heard these Bustards' make. Another is the short
bark by which both sexes express fear and possibly also anger.
The male also has a call. George Taylor who feeds them has
*often heard it, I have only heard it once or twice. It is a difficult
sound to describe, but it is something like the whine of a dog,
\0x25A0only fuller, more musical, and curiously ventriloquistic. When
Taylor first heard it he thought it was made by one of the grey-
hounds some distance away. It is only uttered once and always
under the following conditions. When Taylor has fed the birds
he comes out by the gate, along the path (see diagram) on his
way to the food hut. The bird stands with lowered head and
straight neck, and watches him round, and when he has almost
reached the hut calls after him--just the one call. If faced--if
Taylor looks round at him--he will not call. The bird never
*calls after me, nor will he call if I go down and walk back with
Taylor.*
Others have kept these birds longer, and know more about
them than I ; but as every little helps perhaps I may here
give some conclusions I have formed about Great Bustards in
\0x25A0captivity.
I think their enclosure should contain as great a variety as
possible of ground. They are specially fond of getting up on to
mounds and hillocks, no doubt for sentry purposes. When
riding along in the evening in Spain you will see the Bustards
scattered all over the higher land. This is not to say that you never
see one in a hollow, you do exceptionally, but they like to keep
their look out from high points ; broken ground, then, makes their
*captivity so much more interesting. When they are playing they
like to run up and down a bank, and round the corners and ends
of banks. They are fond of dusting in the banks and making holes
there in which they can squat : and of course the radiated heat
from a bank is very good for them. I do not think that if kept
in an ordinary flat paddock they would be in such good spirits.
* A remark made in a letter by Mr. St. Quintin is interesting- as bearing upon this.
He says " Youug&amp;apos;Bustards 'whine' when hungry, or if one gets over the fence, and is
separated from its fellows. I expect the hen parent can find her youug by this cry in the
standing corn, etc." A. X-B.

My impression is that if these birds are to breed it is
better that they should not be kept in a very large place. The
object is to get them absolutely indifferent not only to men, but to
dogs, and other possible visitors. At the same time the enclo-
sure should not be so small that they would ever feel themselves
" cornered. Perhaps 50 yards x 25 yards is a good size for a Great
j Bustard enclosure.
About food. My own birds are fed morning and evening.
The staple of their food is Spratt's Poultry Food (without the oyster
shell) and barley meal. The first is wetted in the morning and
remains in soak till the evening, that it may swell thoroughly,
and not inside the birds. Then the meal is gradually stirred in
till the whole is nearly dry and will, when pressed, just hold
together in pellets. I11 the same way in the evening preparation is
made for the morning meal. This regime is varied by bits
of bread or toast, for birds, like human beings, get tired of always
having the same food. I11 the wild state no doubt Great
Bustards eat a great variety of animal food, such as mice,
locusts, and insects generally. A captive bird denied this will,
as we have seen, on the first opportunity take it ravenously, and
until it has satisfied this want it will scarcely look at fresh
vegetable food ; but, the craving satisfied, it will then as
greedily eat fresh cabbage.
It is orthodox to give them rock salt, and a large block
has always lain on their gravel path. But although constantly
under observation of myself or others, they have never been
seen either to peck at it or even to pick up any of the salted grit
that lies about it.
It is easy enough to keep sun and rain from the food
bowls, but not Sparrows and Starlings, and here I may point to
the gratitude, and I think profit, that awaits the inventor of such
an apparatus. I have little doubt that with patience Great
Bustards could be induced to feed from a modified form of the
ordinary trap-door pheasant-feeder, only of course these birds
,^w(c)uld not step up on to a ledge. The lever must be set in motion
from a good large platform on a level with the ground, and
depressing into a hollow.

a Great Bustard. My male bird is impudently, the liens gently
tame. Of course the fact that they are actually in the garden
itself is greatly in their favour ; for all day long they see the men
at work, or people passing along the paths by their enclosure.
Twice each morning five greyhounds go by that way,
and then the male Bustard runs up to the wire wall of his lawn
and challenges them. I believe in all their world there is but one
thing of which they are really afraid (though they are rather
shy of the children) and that one is the Chow-Chow "Muffin,"

Conurus solstitialis.
While looking up facts respecting the Connies for the second volume
of the book now in hand (Foreign Birds for Cage and Aviary ) I came across
an account of the successful breeding in captivity of C. solstitialis in Russ'
" Handbuch fiir Vogelliebliaber," pp. 200 and 201. The account runs as
follows: --
"Bred in 18S3 by Madame de Cerville of Rouen (France). M. H.
Gadeau de Cerville states that a pair was in the possession of his wife, from
1872 ; which in summer was confined in an open-air aviary ; from October
to April in a heated room. For four years the female did not lay in the
aviary, but during the following four years laid no less than 29 eggs, four to
six to a clutch. When, in 1881, the male died, it was immediately replaced,
and this pair, after two years nested successfully.
The female laid four eggs in July and three in August; incubated
alone; the duration of incubation was three weeks. The young were fed
by both male and female; they remained in the nest-box three months.
Nestling down short, whitish grey.
At four months the young plumage was green above, slightly mixed
with yellow ; wing- and tail-feathers pale yellow at base, deep blue at tips ;
crown, back of head, and sides of head orange-yellow, more or less greenish ;
under surface greenish yellow; abdomen pale red; eyes dark brown ; naked
orbital ring pale flesh coloured, encircled by reddish feathers; beak
brownisli-black, claws black."
Russ says that this Conure is easy to tame and gifted as a talker;

therefore it is evident that when Canon Dutton stated that " Russ makes
no remark upon their qualities as pets," he must have overlooked the note
in the Handbook.
As the above account of the breeding of the Yellow Contire in cap-
tivity seems to have hitherto passed unnoticed, our Editor expressed a wish
to publish a translation in the Magazine, in order that it might be available
for reference.
From the account of the breeding in captivity of the Yellow-headed
Conni e ( C.jendaya) quoted in Mr. Seth-Smith's " Parralceets," p. 34, it seems
probable that the three mouths which elapsed before the young Yellow
Connies flew, must include the period of incubation. Even then it seems
slow work; but the Parrakeets do not seem to be in a hurry when rearing
a family. A. G. BuTKER.

1908, by a number of enthusiasts in the City of Alameda. Since that date
the membership has been considerably increased, some of the new members
living in remote parts of the State. The membership is not to be limited

Its organization is practically the same, and its object is the study of
American and foreign birds in freedom and in captivity. Poultry and
pigeons, however, are to be excluded.
" At present meetings are held at the homes of the members about
San Francisco Bay in order that the various aviaries and their occupants

The seventy-seventh annual Report of the Royal Zoological
Society of Ireland is to hand and deals with the work of that
Institution during 1908. Financially the year was not a very
successful one, which fact is probably due to the extreme
depression in trade and consequent limitation of the spending
powers of the public. The gardens however have been kept in a
high state of efficiency and the animals have done remarkably
well on the whole, the mortality being extremely low. No less
than nine Lion cubs were born and reared during the year. But
more interesting to us as aviculturists is the account given of the
rearing of the Rhea chicks. Rheas are allowed to roam freely
about the grounds, and early in the summer, some twenty-three
eggs were laid, though one only of the two male birds seemed
inclined to sit. Eleven eggs were therefore given to this bird,
ten of which were hatched after an incubation period of tliirty-

eight days. Six of the chicks were weakly and died while the
other four were successfully reared.
Of the remaining eggs Professor A. Scott took charge of
eleven with the idea of placing them in an incubator and
endeavouring to rear the chicks by hand. His account of the
result of this experiment is published in the Report and is
decidedly interesting, though too long for reproduction in extenso
here. Six of the eggs proved fertile ; four unhatched, of which two
were reared. The temperature of the incubator was regulated to
the normal temperature of an Ostrich--992 0 , that of a Rhea
being then unknown to the experimenter, but this proved to be
much too low, and Professor Scott has since ascertained that the
temperature of a Rhea's body is at least 1050 F.

LORIES, LOVEBIRDS AND PARROT FINCHES.
Sir, --Would you mind telling me if you think a pair of Red Lories
ill an aviary iSft. square would interfere with three pairs of Black-cheeked
Love-birds? I find the latter very dangerous with small birds. They will
seize them by the leg and hold them struggling head downwards till they
bite their leg off.
My old pair of Parrot-finches that hatched fifteen young ones last
season have now been sitting for a week on five more eggs. These are the
o?ily birds that I have as yet allowed to start breeding.
March 15, 1909. W. R. Tkmppk.

kept would seem to be a somewhat dangerous proceeding, though of course
they might agree.

THE BLACK-WINGED HANGNEST.
Sir, --I shall be glad to know whether any of your members can tell
me whether the Black-winged Hangnest is a common species in captivity?
I bought a Hangnest a few weeks ago which was new to me (though this is
not saying much, as I know little or nothing about them) and was at first
unable to identify it.
Mr. Meade-Waldo, however, most kindly made out that it was Icterus
giraudi, the Black-winged Hangnest. The following is a description of the
bird. Bright-yellow, more or less tinged with orange; front and sides of
the head, throat down to the middle of the breast, and wings and tail black.
The dealer I purchased it from assured me it was a seldom imported species
and I certainly do not think I have seen one before.
Keswick Hall, Norwich. Gkrat,d H. Gurney.
Unless I. giraudi has been received quite recently by the London
Zoological Society it is quite unknown as a cage-bird in Europe. We get
few Central American birds and it is only of late years that, owing to the
energy of one or two aviculturists, the birds of Venezuela have been brought
prominently to the notice of the aviculturists of this countiy.

THE WATER RAIL IN HAMPSHIRE.
Sir, --As you have admitted some correspondence about Water Rails
in Kent I wondered whether it might be of interest to add something about
them in Hampshire, written from a district that probably holds as many
Water Rails as any area of equal size in England. Mile upon mile of reed-
fringed streams and water-meadows, of alder, osier, and quaking beds of
reeds, and of water-tangle generally, make the valley of the Test a paradise
for birds that are essentially liiders in swamps and streams.
The pursuit of natural history, or the claims of fishing or of shooting,
take me to the river lauds at all seasons of the year ; so I may almost be said to

live with the Water Rails. When waiting for a rise of fly the fisherman
may have to nurse his patience for an hour or even more, and then, if a
naturalist, he sits very still and sees many things. I am very fond of the
Water Rail, admiring its daintiness, its distinctiveness, and its address in the
presence of danger. Its elusive habits have led me to spend much time
over it.
Not even the Grasshopper Warbler is more secretive than the Water
Rail. One will not find the bird if one " goes after it," if one looks for it as
one may look for a Duck, a Coot ora Moorhen. We shall never see it at all
if it has the slightest suspicion that we are anywhere about. But if you put on
your best protective resemblance clothes, have no white linen showing, sit
down in the likeliest place and remain perfectly still, then you have a
chance. Should you be fortunate you will before long notice here and there
a bit of grass or reed close to the water moving a little, and then may catch
momentary glimpses of a small object threading about through the runs in
the herbage. If you did not know the Rail and its ways you might easily
take this for a water rat. As the day wears 011 the Rails begin to cry or
call, and you will seldom have heard in the stillness of a summer evening a
more startling sound. The voice of the Water Rail is amazing in volume
and variety, out of any proportion to the size of the bird. It is quite
impossible to attempt to phrase it syllabically. There are squeals, sometimes
with a shiver in them, there are gurgles and there are grunts. I have never
been able to see the bird clearly enough when calling, but one of the sounds
suggests a greatly dilated throat. In the winter it is far more silent.
When the water is falling in a "carrier" [irrigation channel] and it is
about half full, one sometimes sees a Water Rail, under the shelter of the
overhanging banks, coming daintily along on the wet mud, flirting its tail
and rapidly picking up small things, such as water snails. Occasionally
you surprise one sitting on a fence rail over the water, or on the low bough
of a willow. They distract the j'oung dogs a good deal when they are
looking for dead or wounded Snipe, twisting about all round them in the
most mystifying way. One Monday in December of last year when we
were shooting Snipe, a dog put up a Water Rail under my feet out of a
very thin fringe of low reeds by a side stream of the river. The bird
dropped into the water when half way across and swam to the opposite
bank. It swam very easily and prettily, jerking itself like a Red-necked
Phalarope.
I have never yet seen a Water Rail feeding away from the water, or for
that matter feeding in the open at all. With us it is, for instance, far more
of a water bird than the Snipe and, as far as I know, feeds only in the
shallow water and on the wet mud by the water's edge.
In the next valley the railway runs for several miles along the edge of
the water-meadows, sometimes close to the river. I have not seldom, from
the carriage window, seen .Snipe feeding by the carriers, but never a Water
Rail.

Correspondence.
On the day of the great blizzard in tiie beginning of this year I pnt
on my ski and went out over the downs. I came to the edge of a high down
commanding a wide and long expanse of water-meadow. All was white,
relieved only by glimpses of leaden water and by one vivid green ribbon of
grass, perhaps four yards wide and about two hundred long. Here the
water, turned into a carrier, had flowed so strongly that it had not frozen
but had overflowed, melted the snow and soaked the glass to right and left.
1 noticed that many birds were feeding here and took them to be Starlings.
I dropt down the steep hill, and as I reached the road, which at this point
runs along some thirty yards from my green ribbon, I heard a Snipe ' scape,'
then another and another. I looked carefully over the low hedge and then
to my amazement saw that, with the exception of a few Thrushes and a
Meadow Pipit or two, all these birds were .Snipe. They were very busy,
hurrying about, probing here and there and then getting up, sometimes
*silently, sometimes with a quiet 'scape,' to settle but a few yards further on.
As near as I could judge there were some seventy of them come in from all
around to the only good bit of feeding ground left. I need not detail the
*sequel to this, as it is not in the story ; it was a remarkable sight and it is
pretty safe to say I shall never see anything like it again. But the point is
this, that among all these birds I did not observe a single Water Rail.
In view of this letter I have spoken to a friend who was born on the
river, has lived on it all his life, and for fifteen years fished it on four
days in every week. He is a keen and accurate observer, and thoroughly
well acquainted with the birds of our valley, for when not fishing he
was watching birds. He assures me that he has never seen a Water Rail
out on the grass, or any where but close to the edge of the water, excepting
on one occasion. One day in the early summer he was sitting very quietly,
waiting for a rise, when a Water Rail came out of some cover closely
followed by another. The second was, no doubt, the male for he went
through very curious antics, fanning his tail and flirting his wings. They
only came out for about two feet and then returned to their hide.

AN UNRECOGNIZED AMAZON.

zon Parrot described by the author under the name of Psittacus hagenbecki
(the trivial name "Hagenbeck's Amazon Parrot" being added below. Of
course the type was a specimen without locality purchased from Hageubeclc
of Hamburg.
Russ says that it differs from ochrocephalus in its white beak with
blackish tip, the almost entire absence of red from the edge of the wing
and from the tail, as well'as the different marking of the latter (each feather
with an ill-defined reddish spot); from panamensis by its clearer green

Salvadori does not mention a blue-green spot on the abdomen, but he
does mention yellow thighs as a characteristic of C. panamensis, and I see
no imoortaut difference in the colour of the beak--" white with blackish
tip " {Russ), yellowish with lead-coloured tip (Salvadori) ; then the amount
of red in Amazon Parrots is certainly variable in some at least of the species.
Russ says that C. ochrocephalns and C. panamensis come in to the
market mixed together and are not usually distinguished. As both occur in
Colombia this is quite likely. Is it not also probable that where the two
species occur together they may at times interbreed and thus produce inter-
grades to puzzle the systematist ?
As C. hagenbecki of Russ is not mentioned in Salvadori's Catalogue, I
thought it might be well to call attention to it. A. G. BuTr.ER.
A RARE HYBRID AUSTRALIAN GRASSI-INCH.
Mr. Hubert 1). Astlev writes from his villaon Lake Como: " I arrived
here yesterday (Feb. 2bth) to find the whole place like the Swiss Mountains,
at this time of the year.
" My gardener, who is 27, says he never remembers anything like it
in all his life, and the consequence is that eleven small birds were picked
up dead in the aviary--frozen in the snow--including, alas and alack, a
beautiful and interesting family. Father, mother and five adult off-springs.
" For two years an odd male Australian Crimson F&amp;apos;inch (Neochmia
phaeton) and a single female Australian Star Finch (BathilJa ruficauda) have
tried to nest. This year they succeeded, only to succumb with the whole
family the day before my arrival ! It is curious that one should have
shewn no trace of it's father's blood, whilst the rest were all rather darkly
coloured above, i.e., much darker than the mother, but all had pale yellow
stomachs, and (to a certain extent) under tail-coverts, with dark red-brown
flanks. None of their tails are, I think, as long as the Australian Crimson
Finch's.
" One can quite understand a new species gradually appearing from
Hybrids like these. Is it not a great pity to have lost them ?
" I have had the parent birds for at least four years in an unheated
aviary--two years here and two years on the Riviera.
" The whole place is deep lin snow, and the birds would not make
use of the shelter provided for them."
[Mr. Astlev is much to be congratulated on obtaining this most
interesting hybrid. The loss of the whole family through the very
exceptional severity of the weather is most unfortunate. Ed.]

.Sir, --Could you let me know, if I get a pair of yellow Budgerigars

Correspondence.
Could you put me on to a pair of Rosellas for breeding later on, have
no room at present. Are Redrumps dangerous with other birds?
I got your Parrakeels some time ago, it is a lovely book. I hope you
will write some more like it ! W. H. Workman.
The following reply was sent to Mr. Workman :
If the green Budgerigars are all paired before y&amp;apos;oti introduce the
yellows, and provided the latter are a pair, there is not much likelihood of
the 1 wo varieties crossing, though the young would doubtless cross, and
after a few seasons you would probably have a very mixed lot.
You would probably get a breeding pair of Rosellas without difficulty
if you inserted a "Wants" advertisement in the magazine.
Redrumps are often spiteful to other birds.
I am glad you like the book Parrakeels. D. Srtk-SmiTH.
THE ABYSSINIAN LOVEBIRD.
Sir, --I am writing to ask you whether you can tell me what species
of Agapomis I have been given. A lady&amp;apos; has presented me with a pair,
which she purchased in Genoa last November, and she tells me that there
were several of them at the bird-dealer's where she acquired them.
About the size of the Rosy-faced Lovebird, certainly no smaller.
General colour: Bright grass-green. Primaries green with a sage-
brown tinge. Secondaries and up the edges of the shoulders deep blue-
black. Tails, dull green, with a blue-black band near the extremity.
Male: Forehead, and narrow edging round the eyes, orange-scarlet.
Female without the orange-scarlet forehead.
Bill in both sexes rose-scarlet and wax-like. Lower mandible pale
pink. The bill of the male being decidedly more massive than that of the
female. Feet grey; eyes deep brown.
They have very&amp;apos; pretty notes, sometimes a little resembling the Rosy-
faced Agapomis ; at other times the male has quite a twitter like the Ben-
galee or some such small finch. Their heads are rather on a broad, large
scale. They are most certainly some species of Agapomis.
I have no books of reference here, but fancy \ have seen the bird
figured in the Ibis. I have never seen it before in the flesh. They are
inclined to be quarrelsome, and I should be sorry to trust them with small
birds. As there were several at Genoa, one would have thought that some of
them would have put in an appearance in England. Perhaps they have ?
Hubert D. Asti.ry.
[This is undoubtedly the Abyssinian Lovebird (Agapomis taranta)
(.Stanley). It is the largest of the group, being over six inches in length,
and one of the few in which the sexes differ in colour. It occurs in
North East Africa from Abyssinia to Shoa, and, so far as we are aware, has
not yet reached England alive. Mr. Astley writes from Italy. Ed.]

THE CINNAMON TREE-SPARROW.
Passer cinnamomeus.
By Capt. G. A. Perreau.
Mr. Teschemaker, having successfully reared young of
this species from a pair I brought home with me last April, asked
me if I would care to write an account of the wild life of this
bird to accompany his account of the nesting, etc., in captivity.
This I am very pleased to do, and cannot make a better start than
by quoting in full Oates's account in The Fauna of British India --
Birds, of this and the nearly allied species, P. assimilis , Vol. II.,
No. 780.
" Colouration. Male. The upper plumage, from forehead
to rump, including the scapulars and lesser wing-coverts, bright
cinnamon-rufous, the feathers of the back with the inner web
black, wholly or partially, and all the feathers with very narrow
pale fringes ; upper tail-coverts brown with ashy margins ; median
coverts black, broadly tipped with white; greater coverts and
tertiaries black edged with pale rufous ; primaries and secondaries
black edged with pale fulvous; more broadly so at. the base and
just above the emarginations of the first few primaries ; lores
and round the eye black ; cheeks and ear-coverts pale yellowish
white; chin and throat black fringed with whitish ; a large patch
on each side of the throat bright yellow, lower plumage greyish-
yellow, more yellow on the abdomen and under tail-coverts.
The difference between the summer and winter plumage of this
Sparrow is very slight, the colours in the former season being
slightly more intense owing to the narrow fringes wearing
away.

with red on the rump and with black and fulvous streaks on the
back; lesser wing-coverts ruddy brown; median coverts black
tipped with white; greater coverts, quills and tail dark brown
edged with fulvous ; a broad fulvous supercilium with a broad
dusky band below it; the sides of the head and neck, and the
whole lower plumage pale ashy yellow.
" Iris reddish brown ; legs and feet dark reddish brown ;
bill pale brown in winter, black in summer. Length about 5.5 ;
tail 2.3 ; wing 2.9 ; tarsus .65 ; bill from gape .55.
" Distribution . The Himalayas from Murree to Bhutan up
to 7,000 feet; the Khasi Hills; the Naga Halls; Manipur; the
hills east of Bhamo ; the Karen Hills east of Tougugoo.
" Habits, etc. Chiefly a jungle Sparrow. Breeds in May
and June, constructing its nest in holes of trees as a rule, but
sometimes in houses. Eggs, four to six, of the sparrow type,
and measuring about .76 by .57.
" Passer assimilis, Walden, A.M.N.H. (4) v, p. 218 (1870),
is, I now find after a re-examination of the type, to be referred to
P. rutilans, Ternm., as already noted by Sharpe (Cat. B.M. xii.,
p. 827). The type of P. assimilis is said to have been procured
at Tougugoo, but there may be probably some mistake about
this, as the specimen was not shot by Wardlaw Ramsay, or other
trustworthy collector. It appears to be a dealer's skin. It is
also to be noted that a true pair of P. cinnamomeus were procured
by Wardlaw Ramsay on the Karen Hills near Tougugoo, and it
is unlikely that two distinct but closely allied Sparrows should
be found together in Tougugoo and its neighbourhood. Under
these circumstances I shall not include P. rutilans among the
birds of the Indian Empire. In case, however, it should be met
with, the male may be recognised by its similarity to the male of
P. cinnamomeus, from which it differs in having the cheeks and
ear-coverts pure white and the lower plumage ashy-white with-
out a trace of yellow. The females of the two species are indis-
tinguishable from each other. P. rutila?is is found in China."
The above quotation is long, but I daresay a good many of
our members have not access to this book, and unless my rather
limited experience is exceptional, I think this is one of the cases

where the aviculturist can do more than the cabinet or field
naturalist. I have met the bird in Chitral as low down as 4,500
feet in winter, and Captain Fulton met it there even lower. In
Chamba I have never seen it below 6,000 ft. in summer. Bakloh
is nearly 5,000 ft., but I have never seen it there, summer or
winter. In and about Dalhousie it is quite common, practically
taking the place of the Common House Sparrow.
In the summer of 1907 I took a month's leave to try
trapping. I spent a most enjoyable June at Kajiar, a little cup
in the hills a march beyond Dalhousie. There is a diminutive
lake in the middle of a large open maidan of splendid turf, round
which are gloriously wooded hills, abounding in birdy nullahs.
H. H. Sir Bhuri Singh, the Rajah of Chamba, had very kindly
placed his bungalow at our disposal and we had a lovely time,
though trapping results were practically nil. I was very poorly
equipped, which was just as well, as it is a bad season of the year
for meating off, and it seems a shame to trap in the breeding
season.
I had seen these Sparrows the year before in this place,
and, without bothering much about them, had put them down as
Cinnamon Tree-Sparrows. O11 closer examination through
field glasses I was rather disgusted to find no trace of yellow
about them. I took three young out of a nest just by our camp,
two others escaped out of my pocket as I was coming down the
tree and got away altogether. I put these three in a small cage
and let the old ones finish rearing them. I did not like to catch
the old pair as I feared they would discontinue feeding the
young. I also caught another half-fledged youngster, but the
old ones apparently spotted the smaller size and the intruder did
not live long. The others soon began to pick up cake, but it was
a long time before they took to soft food and seed.
The camp colony had become very wary, and I nearly had
to go without any more. Seed and cake were no use as a lure,
the birds used to frequent the bushes bordering the grazing, and
hawk insects, or get them off the ground near animals' droppings,
which swarmed with flies and gnats. All the nests I saw were in
holes in trees, in little colonies along the edge of the forest
where suitable trees existed. Young were beginning to leave

the nest soon after our arrival, and the old ones were making
preparations for second broods before we left. The day before
leaving I took the clap-nets and the young as call birds to a
colony about a quarter of a mile away. I was rewarded with a
fine old cock almost at once, but never another chance did I get
all day. My trapping paraphernalia is much improved and I
would back myself to do better another time. This bird had no
trace of yellow. He was certainly not a bird of that year, for my
young cock took some time to get his black throat and red head
and back, though I regret I did not record his progress. Of
course he might have be^eii a one year old, but some must have
been older amongst the ones I watched through the glasses.
On looking up the book I came to the conclusion that my
birds were P. rutilans. I meant to write to the Bombay Natural
History Society about it, but got no chance of sending skins. My
request for Sparrows with reddish heads procured me several birds
but they were Buntings (stracheyi zwdstewarti&amp;apos;). The young turned
out two hens and a cock. About the beginning of December I
think my birds shewed yellow, brighter in the cocks and were un-
doubted cin?iamomeus. This pleased me greatly, taking into con-
sideration that I had caught them to take home as pretty aviary
birds, and the yellow made all the difference in their appearance.
I regretted I could not record rutilans, but am pleased to be able
to record an interesting change of plumage, though I do not care
to tie myself down till I have made a series of skins from the
same locality and kept them alive throughout the year again,,
making more careful notes.
In March, 1908, when caging my birds to take home, I
found the yellow to be much duller, and by the time they went
to Mr. Teschemaker, early in May I think, they showed very
little yellow. I am much looking forward to the notes he is now
writing, and still more to those I hope he will give us later on to
see if his experience agrees with mine. I did not mean to men-
tion my experience in public till I had more to go 011, but it
seems a pity not to mention it when on the subject. I meant ta
have looked up the skins at the Nat. Hist. Museum, but somehow
have not managed to get time. Being for a time a man of lesiure
I never do seem to have time for half the things I want to do. I

know that Capt. Fulton, who made a collection of Chitral skins
the year before I did, also only took skins in the winter.
Many Anglo-Indian writers mention this Sparrow favour-
ably, not only in gratitude for being rid of P. domesticus , but,
according to Major Magrath, as being " quite an acquisition to
the avifauna of the hills." He also calls it " this handsome
sparrow," with both of which compliments I heartily concur. I
believe Mr. Teschemaker has the only ones in England. I won-
der they are not imported, as they are handsomer and smaller
than some that are. I fancy their temper is no worse, if as bad
as others. I certainly am inclined to attribute two casualties to
them (i.e. a newly-caught lieu Rose-finch and the other cock
P. citmamomeus). I believe Mr. Teschemaker cannot speak over
well of this cock, but let us hope that this is a case of individual
temperament, and I must mention in justice to his character
that, in the first place much more damage might easily have been
done in that aviary without causing me much surprise, owing to
the presence of defenceless birds, and in the second place that
notorious evil-doers were also present, a very mixed crowd.
Still the suspicion remains.
It seems hard on this charming little bird to leave him
with a slur on his character, I wish I had put the pill before the
sugar. I might add, though I have already written far more than
I intended, that the cock did all he could in feeding my caged
young and proved himself a model father.
THE NESTING OF THE CINNAMON
TREE-SPARROW.
By W. E. Teschemaker. B.A.
I am glad to have been able to induce Capt. Perreau to write
the above very interesting account of this species for two reasons.
In the first place I wanted our member to describe in his own words
the singular change of colour because I think we have here an
original observation of unusual interest. I may add that I have
held over this paper for some considerable time in order to have
further evidence to offer on this point. Secondly, it adds greatly
to our interest in the inmates of our aviaries to have some actual

Mr. W. E. Teschemaker,
details of their former life in a state of liberty. How often have
I vainly wished that my birds could unfold to me the story of
their early life!
In this case, however, I was more fortunate, for I know
that the first impressions of my Cinnamon Sparrows, as they
looked from their nest, were of the Kajiar--" the little cup in
the hills; " we can see the gallant Captain ascending the tree and
can even hear him say "Bother!" as he lost two of the young
birds on the way down. Further I had learnt that my birds were
two young hens and an adult unrelated male.
I received the Cinnamons on 4th May, and turned them
out about ten days later in the small " Waxbills' aviary"--not
without some misgivings, having been warned by Capt. Perreau
that they would probably prove spiteful. Perhaps it would be
well to say at once that I think this an unfair estimate of the
character of this species. Though very pugnacious with its own
kith and kin, I have found it quite harmless in an aviary even
when associated with birds much smaller than itself. Also I
hardly think Capt. Perreau has done justice to its personal
appearance. The adult male with his large black bib, bright
chrome chest and rich cinnamon back is distinctly a handsome
bird ; and so is the female with her yellow cheeks and richly
coloured and striated wings.
The Cinnamons made themselves completely at home in
their new quarters, proving as vivacious as the European Tree-
Sparrow, and fully as inquisitive. In a very few days' time they
had selected a nest-box and by 2nd June they had constructed a
nest of the typical Passerine domed type inside the latter. The
eggs also closely resembled the sparsely spotted type of the
eggs of the common House-Sparrow but are smaller : length
72 mm., breadth 53 mm. Some of the maculations are pale
reddish-brown and others sepia. Both the clutches I have seen
have been " fours."
They began to sit on the 13th June and, when I took the
nest-box down on the 26th June, it contained four young which
I estimated to be three days' old, giving us an incubation period
of ten days.

on the Nesting of the Cinnamon Tree-Sparrow. 207
For a few days the parents fed well and matters appeared
to be progressing satisfactorily ; but one morning I was amazed
to see them rolling over and over on the ground locked together
in furious conflict. I separated them and awaited the next act
in the drama. Before long the male carried some food to the
young, and, as he was, standing half in and half out of the nest
engaged in the very natural and laudable task of feeding, up
came the female and gave him a vicious peck from behind.
Straightway paterfamilias put his helm ' hard aport ' and emerged
in a furious rage and the two again fell to the ground, tearing at
one anothers' throats. So it was jealousy--just female jealousy--
which has upset so many households at one time or another.
There was nothing for it but to remove the male and, as a
necessary corollary, to destroy two of the young. The latter
were naked squabs, closely resembling the young of Passer
domesticus. The female reared the remaining two young success-
fully and they proved to be two males, resembling the female
but showing at an early age some traces of the black bib.
The following entry appears in my Log-book under date
4th July: "The two young Cinnamons flew. They are strong
and well- feathered, darker than the adult hen on back and crown,
grey on breast, the only buff being the stripe over the eye and the
lower margin of cheeks. They both show traces of a bib, the
dark feathers of the latter underlying the grey,"
About a mouth later this lieu laid another clutch of four
eggs, which found their way into my cabinet after being pliotoed
in situ.
And now a few words about the change of colour. As we
know there is nothing unique in this world but it is, I think, an
exceedingly rare thing for any passerine species to assume its
dullest colours in the breeding season and its brightest in the
depth of winter. Yet Capt. Perreau tells us that the adult male
he caught in the breeding season " had no trace of colour," and
that "about the beginning of December my birds" (i.e. both the
young and the adult males presumably) " showed yellow." Now
of course I was anxious to put this matter to the test, and, as
yellow is a colour not easily impaired by cage-life, I did not

anticipate any difficulty in the matter, and only retained the
young male for the purpose of observation.
The adult male began to show his yellow breast about the
middle of December, apparently through an actual change of
colour and not by casting any feathers, and as an exhibitor
offered to purchase a pair, and naturally wanted the best birds, I
sent him this bird. As bad luck would have it, it died shortly
after arrival and, with considerable reluctance, I therefore gave
him the remaining young male. I am unfortunately therefore
only able to confirm Capt. Perreau's observation to this extent:
namely, that the adult male certainly had a bright yellow breast
when I received it on the 4th May (though it had faded somewhat,
according to Capt. Perreau, by that date) ; that by the commence-
ment of July its breast had become entirely grey, only the cheeks
retaining the chrome colour ; that by the middle of December
there was certainly every indication that the plumage of the
former winter would be renewed. On the other hand Capt.
Perreau tells 11s that the young male (which was ultimately
killed by the adult male) also changed colour in December, and
this I cannot confirm because I have made careful enquiries and,
as lately as the 31st March, its present owner has informed me
that there was no indication of any change.
I am hoping, however, that this matter may still be cleared
up beyond any possibility of doubt because Capt. Perreau has
just returned to India and will be able to obtain a series of skins,
and on the other hand I hope to be able to keep an eye on the birds
which were bred in my aviary and record any change.
I11 conclusion I may say that I shall always think kindly of
Passer cinna 7 nomeus because, through the instrumentality of
this species, I have added to the number of my friends its
importer. Aviculture, as we must all have observed, has often
led to differences of opinion and even to bitter feuds, but I am
glad to think that this is not necessarily the case for, during
the past few years, I have made some good friends amongst
aviculturists.
Mr. Teschemaker appears to be entitled to receive tlie Society's
Medal for having successfully reared young of Passer cinnainomeus in his
aviaries, and recording the fact in our journal.-- Ed.

Although I had been fortunate enough to see a number of
Victorian birds, there were still some that I was particularly
anxious to meet with, foremost among which was the Lyre Bird,
the native Pheasant of the Colonists. This bird, I was told could
generally be heard at least, if not actually seen, within some
thirty miles of Melbourne, and I was advised to make my way to
Fern-tree Gully, where I should have as good a chance of meet-
ing with this bird as anywhere. For studying wild life there is
no time like the early morning, when every bird is abroad, busily
searching for its breakfast. My time was very much occupied
with the serious business part of my expedition so that I had not
the necessary leisure to go and stay in the bush as I should like
to have done. I had therefore to content myself on this occasion
with a half-day trip.
I decided to take the earliest train in the day to Fern-tree
Gully station. This, I ascertained, left a few minutes before
6 a.m. so, on the morning of February 13th, I left my hotel in
time to catch this train, which landed me at my destination soon
after 7 a.m.
Having, with some difficulty procured an early breakfast
at the Fern-tree Gully Hotel, I commenced my rambles. A foot-
path led up the side of a hill through thick scrub. Eucalyptus trees
towered above one and beneath them acacias, tree ferns and the
handsome cabbage palm. The thicket resounded with the songs
of birds from the rich notes of the Magpies or the melodious
notes of the Harmonious Ground-thrush to the tiny twitterings
of the White-eye (. Zosterops ) or the Blue Wrens (Mahirus). One
magnificent little specimen of the last-named species afforded me
considerable delight as he hopped about on the grassy path in
front of me, his little tail cocked up over his back and the blue
shields on his head and back shining in the sunlight like polished
turquoise. Of all the birds I saw in Australia I liked none so
well as the glorious little Blue Wren !

Mr. D. Seth-Smith,
But the chorus of music was varied by a sound very unlike
any other bird-sound I had heard, and had I not been rather on
the alert to detect it, I should probably never have recognised it
as the sound emitted by a bird at all. This was the note of the
Coach-whip Bird, a note exactly resembling the crack of a whip.
From the thickest of the scrub the note proceeded at intervals and
I sat still on a tree-stump hoping I might be fortunate enough
to obtain a glimpse of the bird. A lizard emerged apparently
from underneath the tree trunk upon which I sat and basked in
the sun almost at my feet, and as my eyes moved towards him I
noticed a solitary bull-dog or soldier ant on the path and com-
menced to tease him with the tip of my stick. These ants,
which are about an inch in length, whose bite is as painful as the
sting of a bee or perhaps more so, are very interesting little
creatures. They will not run away from danger but stand up on
their hind legs and face it, and it was most comical to watch the
little soldier fighting the end of my walking stick. Writing of
Bull-dog Ants reminds me of my introduction to these interest-
ing insects in Western Australia, which I omitted to mention in
my account of my rambles there. Mr. Ernest Le Souef and I
were returning from a long ramble in the Margaret River district
when we noticed the stump of a " black-boy" (the settlers' name
for the grass-tree) which had been hollowed out by decay and
filled in with earth by some insect. "An Ants' nest" remarked
my companion, and gave it a sound kick, sending the rotten
Stump and its contents flying. We considered it advisable to fly
also, for the stump had been converted into a nest of the venomous
Bull-dog ant, some hundreds of which now lay scattered in all
directions thirsting to attack the enemy who had attacked them.
But to return to Fern-tree Gully.
While quietly engaged in playing with the insect at the
safe distance of the length of a walking-stick, my attention was
arrested by a rustling among the dry leaves in the thicket close
by. The disturbance might have been caused by an English
Blackbird as it flung the brittle leaves away in search of worms.
I watched intently, and presently a fine Coach-whip Bird
(Psophodes crepitans ) appeared in full view as he hopped about in
search of an early meal. A handsome bird is this, black of hue,

with great white ear-patches and crest which is erected or
depressed at will. A slight movement on my part and he had
vanished, and I saw him no more, though his whip-crack was
now and then heard.
Higher up the gully, as I quietly strolled along, a sound
greeted me which I shall not readily forget, for it was the sound
I had come out to hear. From the thickest part of the scrub
suddenly proceeded the most powerful and sonorous notes it has
ever been my good fortune to hear from any bird. The musical
notes of the Magpie, the song of the Butcher-bird and many
other bird songs emerged from the depths of the thicket, but
with a fulness and power in their utterance that could come from
one bird only, and that the Lyre Bird. There was no mistaking
it; the deep richness of those notes, the extraordinary variety
of the song, sometimes of the harshest then of the sweetest
description ; these proceeded from that prince of mockers of
which Australian ornithologists are so justly proud.
There are supposed to be three species of Lyre Birds in
Australia, all confined to the South East and East, but there are
really only two species, the so-called Menura victories being
merely a geographical race of M. supe?ba of New South Wales.
M. alberti which is found in Queensland is however quite a dis-
tinct species, less handsome and with a differently shaped tail to
the southern species.
A bird that I was very glad to see was the Spotted Ground
Thrush ( Cinclosoma pundatuni). two of which flew up from the
ground a short distance ahead of me, their rounded tails and
wings giving them a peculiarly dove-like appearance. They
uttered no sound as they disappeared into the bush.
A small stream trickled down the steep bank, forming a
pool close to the path on which I walked. A beautiful White-
throated Thickhead (. Pachycephala gutturalis&amp;apos;) a lovely bird with
rich yellow breast, black head and white throat, was engaged on
the ground capturing some small insects near the pool, a most
unusual place for this species which is generally seen amongst
the branches of trees. As I watched it commenced to bathe and
seemed little disturbed by my presence. I met with this bird

Mr. D. Skth-Smith,
frequently in my rambles, but beard its beautiful clear note much
more often than I caught sight of the bird itself.
On the high ground at the head of the gully English
Goldfinches were quite numerous. They have found au ideal
home here, where they are not likely to be disturbed by the bird-
catcher.
As I commenced to descend into the gully again the rich
notes of the Lyre Bird again attracted my attention, but though
I made every effort to detect the bird itself, I was quite unable
to catch a glimpse of it. However, later, in New South Wales, I
was more fortunate.
A stream runs through the bottom of the gully, its banks
covered with luxurious tree-ferns and I reclined here for some
time surrounded by many birds. The charming little Scarlet-
breasted Robin (.Petrceca leggii) was here, his bright red breast
showing up like some brilliant scarlet flower ; the Yellow-breasted
Robin (.Eopsaltria australis&amp;apos;), a most industrious flycatcher, grey
above with bright yellow breast, sat motionless on a twig some
few yards from me, and every now and then would dart forth and
capture some insect, returning to the perch whence it came.
The Harmonious Ground Thrush hopped about on the grass
near by, and a Sacred Kingfisher flew past and alighting at some
distance from me scanned the ground below for some insect on
which to prey. His larger cousin the Laughing Jackass was here
also, and as I started towards the station flew from a gum tree
and made a bee line into the thickest part of the bush, and
alighting out of sight gave vent to his mocking laugh. But my
time was up and I made for the station and thence back to
Melbourne.
Aviculturists are few and far between in Australia, but I
had the pleasure of meeting one, a lady, whose skill in keeping
the insectivorous birds of that country is probably second to
none in that part of the world.
Mr. Dudley Le Souef drove me one afternoon to the
house of Dr. and Mrs. Horn, whose niece, Miss Helen Bowie, has
from a child been devoted to birds, and unlike the average
Australian "bird fancier," long ago recognised the fact that the

birds of her own land are far more interesting from the avicultural&amp;apos;
point of view that the domestic Canary or the Java Sparrow, and
so she and her uncle, Dr. Horn, have made a study of Australian
birds, especially the very attractive insectivorous and honey-
eating species. In quite a small back garden I was taken into
Miss Bowie's aviaries which were thickly planted with growing
shrubs. In the first of these my old friend the Sacred King-
fisher was perched supreme on an upper branch, and flew to his
mistress for a proffered grub. The charming Yellow-breasted
Robins came from their hiding places for a like attraction, and
Yellow and White-tufted Honey-eaters flew to the newly-filled
honey pots which were fixed 011 the branches, and sucked up the
syrup with the greatest eagerness. No less than four species of
Wood-Swallows ( Artamus ) were here also, most attractive birds
which do thoroughly well in captivity.
A splendid cock Blue-Wren ( Malurus ) shared an aviary
with some Gouldiau and other Australian Finches. This little
gem had been here for no less than three years, and for the last
two years had never gone out of colour but had moulted from
one full dress straight into another. The change of plumage of
this species is decidedly erratic in a wild state; possibly the older
the individual the shorter is the period during which it assumes
its undress plumage, and very possibly in very old males this
period is reduced to a vanishing point and the bird is always in
court livery. Miss Bowie's bird, kept as it is under conditions
very nearly resembling the wild state, seems to point to this
conclusion. The excessive heat wave that had visited Melbourne
shortly before my arrival had been responsible for the deaths of
a number of Miss Bowie's birds, the Honey-eaters especially
suffering, and the lady apologised for the small collection that
she was able to show me. I considered it a very fine collection
as it was, and what birds there were were certainly a very choice
lot. The beautiful little Spinebill (Acanthorhynchus tenuirostris&amp;apos;)
was here, a delicate mite reminding one much of a Sunbird of
somewhat sombre hue ; so was the tiny Flower-pecker or Swallow
Dicseum (.Dictzum hirundinaceum ) a charming little creature clad
in shining blue-black coat with scarlet throat and breast.

Pheasants, were White-fronted Herons, Night Herons and Black-
tailed Water-hens ( Tribonyx ventralis&amp;apos;). The last of these birds
is a very interesting species from the fact that it occasionally
arrives in the Southern states of Australia in incredible numbers,
while it may be practically absent for years. It is a striking
bird with an erect tail like that of a bantam hen, bright red eyes
and legs, and a mostly pea-green bill.
The Botanical Gardens in Melbourne, situated to the south
of the city, on the banks of the Yarra River, are perhaps the
most beautiful in Australia; and here, surrounded by native
and foreign semi-tropical foliage, one can see any number of
Australian wild birds. On the ornamental water Coots and
Wild Duck disport themselves, and Pied Grallinas walk grace-
fully on the well kept grass banks. The attractive and familiar
Black and White Fantail Flycatcher is almost always to be seen
here, and Honey-eaters of many species abound. Lorikeets,
especially Muskies, regularly visit the gum trees when in flower.
The ubiquitous White-eye ( Zosterops ) is always present in
numbers, and the Laughing Jackass and its small cousin the
.Sacred Kingfisher is often seen.
At the time of my visit there were a number of Aloes in
full flower, and these proved an irrisistable attraction to Honey-
eaters. The White-tufted species, a yellowish bird with small
white cheek tufts was the most numerous, and almost every plant
In flower was visited by a large Wattle-bird. The Yellow-tail
.(.Acanthiza ) and the tiny Spotted Pardalotes, the White-shafted
Fantail and Blue Wren were also included in my list of the
birds I saw in the Melbourne Botanical Gardens.
(To be continued).
On going to press we have received from Mr. George Carrick a cutting
from the Glasgozu Evening News of April 27th, relating to the sale of
Bostock's Menagerie. The most extraordinary bidding took place when
"the Australian Gin Gin bird, a small green bird of the parrot kind" was
put up. The bidding commenced at 10 guineas, and the bird was knocked
down for 260 guineas. This bird was said to whistle many tunes. Can any
member enlighten us as to the proper name of the "Gin Gin " bird ?

On the Ruby-throated Bulbul.
THE RUBY-THROATED BULBUL.
Rubigula dispar.
(Cat. B. Brit. Mus. VI., 167 ; Hand-list III., 334.)
WITH REFERENCES TO SOME KINDRED SPECIES.
By Reginald Phielipps.
Through the courtesy of our member Mrs. Johnstone, I
received a female of this species on January 26, 1904; this bird
survives, and is still in my possession. On October 17 of the
same year, thanks again to Mr. and Mrs. Johnstone, I received a
second example ; this one, although far healthier than the first,
was so short of quill feathers in one wing that it could not fly.
It was carefully nursed through the winter, and in May was
loosed out from time to time; but one day it was caught, injured,
and plucked by a Rufous-chinned Laughing-Thrush ( Trochalop-
terum rufigzdare), and died on May 23, 1905, from inflammation of
the lungs, &amp;c. This was a calamity, for, as far as I have been
able to learn, these two are the only specimens of Rubigula
dispar that have ever reached this country alive.
At the first, there was some doubt as to which of the two
species of Ruby-throated Bulbul my bird belonged, as it was
stated to have been procured in Celebes, from which island
neither is known. However, it transpired that it had been
obtained at a port-of-call on the way to Celebes ; and its title
was satisfactorily settled by a letter obtained by Mrs. Johnstone
from Mr. Cocksedge (who had been with Mr. Goodfellow,
and had brought the bird to England some ten days before I
received it) who, on February 5, wrote to her as follows:--" The
bulbul.came from Surabaya ; we bought them in a shop.
Surabaya as you know is an important port in Java, and they
must, have been bred there as they were so young they were
unable to feed." The call at Surabaya occurred about the end of
June, 1903, so my Ruby is now rising six.
The general colour above of this bird is olive-yellow, the
quills and tail feathers being brown but mostly edged externally
with the same colour as the back. The head and nape are deep
black, purplish black according to the Museum Catalogue--the
"purple" perhaps being perceptible in the case of the male but

Mr. Reginald Phillipps,
not noticeable in my female. There is a little knob at the top of
the head, which courtesy requires us to refer to as a crest. A
black cliin-spot. " Kntire throat brilliant scarlet." " Remainder
of under surface of body, from the throat downwards, deep
orange-yellow, paler on the abdomen, vent, and under tail-
coverts." Bill black; the feet of my bird are dirty-whitish.
The iris of the male is said to be " Vermillion red," of the female
"straw-colour"--that of my female might almost be lighter.
Sexes alike in plumage, but the male, a little over 7 inches in
length, is stated to be slightly the larger of the two. For some
two or three years--a not unusual occurrence with birds of a like
colour--my Ruby lost the orange in the yellow of the under
parts, but this she has since regained to quite a considerable
extent.
I should suppose that, in the wild state, the Ruby-throated
Bulbul feeds mostly on small berries, for I notice that my bird
does not seem to have an idea of breaking up any piece of food
which is too large to be swallowed whole. If she takes up a
piece of banana or grape, and is unable to swallow it, after a few
feeble attempts to gulp it down, she quietly drops it. For the
greater part of the year, she lives chiefly on bananas and sultanas,
both cut up. At one time, she had also cut up grapes, but these
have been discontinued. Lettuce torn up into very small pieces
she will occasionally partake of with satisfaction, also grass, and
probably bits of leaves and seeds. She sometimes helps herself
to a morsel of sop or cooked apple. Of course, during the
season, garden currants, etc., are supplied to the occupants of
the aviary, at which she "nibbles," but not with any particular
zest or relish. From time to time, but not very frequently I
think, she will take a piece of egg-flake, or give a peck at the
ants' eggs. She seems to do best on a general fruit and vegetable
diet, and without anything in the form of meat or mealworms.
As a rule, indeed, but not invariably, she will not look at either
mealworm, insect or spider.
The usual note of this Bulbul, a female be it remembered,
is a lively and very pleasing metallic twitter, Twit, too-wit,
frequently developing into something like Tit, twit, tiddle-de-
wink. When uneasy or excited, she not infrequently utters a

repetitions to Too, te, tit, to-who-are-you. Ce-ce go-a?id-do-it and
Come alofig and get it are not unfamiliar sounds. Perhaps it is
only when one conies to analyze the familiar notes of a bird that
one realises how they vary in detail : how can any one doubt
that they are able to speak to and understand one another!
After Ruby had lost a Mesia that for a while kept company with
her--I never heard it before--she being at the time anxious to
breed, she would occasionally, but not very often, break out into
a (usually) one-note bell-like call, continuously and rapidly re-
peated without a pause, lasting generally for between two and three
minutes, unquestionably a call for a mate. It was quite loud,
and in the stillness of the forest would have been heard at a very
considerable distance; it was uttered only in the garden, from
one of the highest perches, usually in the morning though not
especially early. On one occasion, it was tolled out as a parting
call before retiring in the evening, as a last despairing call for a
mate before withdrawing from the world for " brooding " pur-
poses for the fourth time that year (1906), and lasted close upon
four minutes. The call, in course of time, degenerated into a
repetition of tzvit and too-it.
She seems to be a bird of local habits, as a rule always
roosting in exactly the same spot. During the time she was
associated with the Mesia (see below), she passed the night on a
high twig in the birdroom, side by side with him, but this was
quite foreign to her nature. After his departure, if not interfered
with, she would sleep in a dark sheltered corner in a "house"
with a gable roof in the birdroom; but so nervous was she at
that time (1906) that, if I chanced to enter while she was prepar-
ing to go to rest and before she had settled down, she would not
gototheusual house. She seemed to have an instinctive dread of
being marked down to her sleeping perch :--countless numbers
of her ancestors during the ages have gone to roost in similar
trepidation, have been "snatched" during the darkness of the
night by some monkey or other creature, and never seen the
dawn. The life of the wild bird is a life of ceaseless and never-
ending terrors--never ending until the end comes, too often

Mr. Reginald Phileipps,
swiftly, cruelly, horribly*. As regards this Bulbul, I have formed
the opinion that, when wild, it does not necessarily roost high,
but rather seeks the densest thickets or the thickest foliage.
It is a little curious, but it used to be her custom to go to
roost exceptionally early, in the long days of summer often some
two hours before the other birds ; and if she were disturbed after
having settled down on her perch and nestled her head between
her wings, although the light might still be fair, she would behave
as if purblind, dazed, stupid, perhaps blundering on to another
perch hard by, from which, however much exposed, she would
not voluntarily move until the following morning. Small wonder
that her instinct taught her to hide herself well away before
going to sleep. Presumably her eyes were focused so as to be
in suitable touch with the glare of a tropical sun, and she was
unable to see in other than a good light. I speak in the past
tense as, during the last two years or so, I have not noticed any-
thing especially out of the way in this respect; presumably she
has got accustomed to the fogs and darknesses of London ; if
she has not done so, it is not from want of opportunity !
When I look back over my notes, it is almost startling to be
reminded what a difficulty and labour it used to be to keep this
bird alive. She could not stand cold, for her dress was like that
of an Arab, loose and airy, so loose, indeed, that, if handled, the
feathers came out wholesale; and, in my cool birdroom and
exposed aviary, for some two-thirds of the year she had to exist
in an atmosphere of shiver, excepting during the too frequent
intervals when she had to be caged and nursed. Moreover, she
was so ridiculously timid that she would hide herself away,
neglecting food and shelter, should any bird larger than a blue-
bottle come within a yard of her. And she required the most care-
ful dieting, for symptoms of seizures were not infrequent and
* Is the wild bird never safe, either by day or night ? What dweller in the country
is not familiar [if he has eyes and ears !] with the agonising cry of the Blackbird when
seized by the Sparrow Hawk, ere it has time to dart into the hedge or thicket but a few
yards distant ? I have seen [generations ago] a sitting Sparrow Hawk, a female, come off
her nest in the late evening, and for several evenings in succession, enter from below some
tall laurels in the shrubberies, and, working upwards, attack the sleeping Greenfinches, etc.,
who had gone to roost under the leaves, and not once go away empty handed--and all was
done so quietly ! R.P.

had to be watched for and provided against. In short, she was
unsuited for the life of a mixed aviary with access to miscellaneous
foods. Those who have several small aviaries, instead of only
one or two larger ones, have greatly the advantage with such a
subject as this to deal with. To what extent the confinement
and travelling about for some seven months prior to reaching
England may have been responsible for this delicacy and weak-
ness of mind and body I am not prepared to say ; I was told that
there had been two of them originally, but only one lived to
reach this country. A single male would have been less timid,
and a pair would have done better still. However, this solitary
spinster has so far progressed that she is now, apparently, in good
health and faultless plumage, and seldom gives me a moment's
anxiety as to her welfare, and has become so brave that she will
rifle the Cuba Finches' nests if opportunity offers, an exhibition
of courage that I could dispense with.
I11 cold weather, on the birdroom window being opened a
trifle, this bird's crisp Twit , too-wit simultaneously resounds
through the room and proclaims the event to all the inmates,
and she is one of the first to dart out for a fly and hail the morn
with her bright and cheery tiddle-de-wink and other notes. But
she will soon feel the chill, and, having no enemy to fear at
present, will quickly return to the birdroom for shelter ; for when
birds expose themselves to cold, as in cases occasionally related,
it is not because they like it, or that the exposure does not injure
them, but, as a rule at any rate, because there is some hindrance
to their seeking shelter, some fear in the way, in most cases just
another bird and nothing more. It is not the human subject
that frightens the bird in the aviary, that sometimes fills it with
terror, but some feathered companion, usually one of its own or
of a kindred species. This point is too often overlooked or made
light of by aviculturists--and then follows the post mortem,
and they are surprised !

The Rainbow Bunting.
THE RAINBOW BUNTING.
A short time ago I received the following letter from Mrs.
Miller, a most enthusiastic aviculturist, with a fine collection of
mostly rare foreign cage birds, which testify to the careful
treatment they receive by their excellent condition and tame-
ness.
"Dear Mr. Seth-Smith,
"Mr. Hainlyn lias sent me up a bird tliat I think must be very rare;
it is really very beautiful and I am anxious to know if you can name him
for me. The size is that of a small Tanager, but the build is more like that
of a Pekin Robin. The bill is short, rather thick, and of a metallic clear
bluish colour. Brow or forehead of a delicate sage green, head and back of
a lovely shining blue, like the blue on an English Kingfisher. Golden
rings round eyes (which are large and bright); breast of plum colour shading
to pale gold; dark green on wings and tail in places.
"The bird is very lively ; appears to be a seed-eater with a liking for
live insects and has no song as yet.
"I shall be pleased to show him to you. He is supposed to have
come from Venezuela. (Mrs.) K. L. MiEEER."
I called to see the bird which its owner most kindly
showed me. It was a truly lovely creature, which I recognised
as one of the Neotropical Buntings of the genus Cyanospiza, but
I was quite unable to name the species. However, when at the
Natural History Museum Mr. Chubb kindly opened the drawer
containing the genus Cyanospiza , and I at once recognised Mrs.
Miller's bird as C. leclancheri , a Mexican species. I had just been
reading Mr. C. W. Beebe's charming book entitled Two Bird-
lovers i?i Mexico, in which the author gives the following account
of this Bunting.
" The most beautiful of all the small birds was a bunting.
We christened him the Rainbow Bunting, but the books call him
the Leclanclier Bunting. These little finches flitted through the
underbush in pairs, searching for insects and seeds among the
leaves or mounting to the top of a small bush and giving voice to
their joy in a little ditty, the attempt at which was most to be
admired, for the twittering ended in promise. Their beauty and
vivacity evade all description. A photograph would convey no-
thing of their charm. Try to imagine a little feathered sprite,
less than five inches in length, with a crown of apple-green ;

cheeks, back, wings, and tail of turquoise-blue; throat and
underparts of clean lemon-yellow; with a band of delicate orange
across the breast ! His mate who follows him so faithfully and
listens to his pitiful song so admiring, has the greens and
yellows in softened indistinct lines. Altogether they are charm-
ing little birds, living in a region where their beauty falls only
upon such unappreciative eyes as those of vultures and coons."
To Mr. Beebe then belongs the credit of giving to this
beautiful bird an appropriate name, a name by which Mrs. Miller
intends henceforth to call her bird, and by which let us hope it
will be known to aviculturists in this country when some enter-
prising person takes the trouble to bring home some more of
these delightful birds. The Indigo Bunting (C. cyanea ) a first
cousin to the present species, though a very handsome bird, is a
dull-coloured creature by the side of the exquisite Rainbow
Bunting. D. S-S.

The third part of Mr. Eliot Howard's beautiful work on
the British Warblers is now published, and deals with the Black-
cap, Pallas's Willow-Warbler and Radde's Bush-Warbler. Every
page testifies to the extremely careful observations made by the
author. From the time these migrants reach our shores to the
day they leave Mr. Howard seems to have studied their every
movement, which he graphically describes, and his chapters on
their life history are of absorbing interest to every bird-lover.
The plates are, one and all, most beautifully executed by
Mr. Grbnvold, and are some of the best work that this clever
artist has produced. The attitudes are most life-like, and so
different to the conventional attitudes employed in the majority
of present-day bird illustrations. It would be difficult to praise
too highly the work of either the author, the artist, or the pub-

THE EMU.
Mr. Gregory M. Mathews, when studying the series of
specimens of Malurus in the Tring Museum, discovered some
specimens from South Alligator River which differed slightly
from M.pulchetrimus with which they had been identified. These
he has named Malurus Eilcis and his description appears in
the January number of our Australian contemporary, together
with a coloured plate by Mr. Keulemans. The latter may be of
service as a map showing the distinguishing colours of this newly
discovered race, but the figures, especially that of the female,
would otherwise hardly be recognised as referring to any species
of this elegant and dainty genus.
Mr. A. E. H. Mattingley concludes his most useful and
interesting account* of the Mallee-Fowl (. Lipoa ocellata&amp;apos;), which
is illustrated by photographic reproductions.
Mr. A. G. Campbell gives an interesting account of the
Flame-breasted Robin ( Petroeca fthcenicca&amp;apos;) whose migratory
movements this observer has very carefully watched.
Mr. F. E. Howe describes the birds observed by him during
a ramble in North-western Victoria in the height of the nesting
season, when no less than 112 species of birds were identified.
Mr. E. M. Cornwall's "Notes on Birds found breeding near
Mackay, North Queensland," are of particular interest, as the
author graphically describes the finding of the nest of the rare
Jabiru (. Xenorynchus asiaticics&amp;apos;). This was placed on a mass of
climbers which smothered the crown of a tall scrub tree. " The
nest was a large flat structure, composed principally of a long
trailing grass which grows along the sea-shore, few, if any, sticks
being used. It was placed on a mass of creepers large and strong
enough to support the birds if they got out of the nest. The
young birds were ungainly-looking creatures, and lay flat in the
nest, making no attempt to move when Mr. Neilson handled
them." The young birds, which form the subject of a photo-
graphic illustration, were judged to be about three months old
when they left the nest.
Interesting papers by Messrs. A. J. Campbell and Robert
Hall, and a liberal supply of Notes, etc., complete a capital
number of this useful publication.

The first number of the journal published by The Avi-
cultural Society of California, of which a notice appeared in our
last issue (p. 193), is to hand and gives promise of a useful
publication. As might have been expected this first number
deals with what might be termed very elementary aviculture, but,,
as the membership increases, the Committee will doubtless greatly
improve their magazine. We wish them every success, and feel
sure that whenever an opportunity occurs the members of our
Avicultural Societjr will offer them a helping hand.
THE BIRDS OF KENT.
Those of our members and readers who are specially interested in
British birds, and more particularly those living in the South-Eastern
counties, will be glad to know that our member Dr. Norman Ticehurst has
completed the manuscript of, and will shortly publish, an exhaustive work
on the birds of Kent, the county closest to the Continent and therefore of
especial ornithological importance. Dr. Ticehurst is one of the best and
most careful of present day working ornithologists, and we have no doubt
that his book will rank with the best of the numerous volumes that have
appeared on the avifauna of the British Isles. We understand that the
published price of this book, which will run to some 600 pages and be well
illustrated, will be 21/-, but that if subscribed for in advance the price will
be 16/- post free. Messrs. Witlierby and Co. (326 High Holborn) are the
publishers.
CORRESPONDENCE, NOTES, ETC.
THE SEX OF STANLEY PARRAKEETS.
Sir, --Is there any difference in colour of cock and hen Stanley
Parrakeets when adults? Mr Payne, at Bath, assured me when I bought
mine about 12 months ago that there was no difference, so he and I went
through his stock and selected one with a large head and without doubt a
cock, and another with a finer head and altogether more "benny" look,
but alike in colour except that the cock has some red on the back between
the shoulders and the other has not. I had little doubt my birds were a
pair until I saw those at the Crystal Palace Show, where I noticed the hens
had scarcely any red on them. Now I should be glad to know if the hens
at the Palace were very young birds, or if mine are two cocks.

except that the female was supposed to be slightly duller. Count
Salvadori, in the British Museum Catalogue of Birds, which should be a
reliable authority on such matters, simply quotes Ramsey's statement
that the female is "similar to the male, only slightly duller in colour.''
However the recent importation has shown this to be incorrect, the females
being quite differently coloured to the males, there being, as Mr. Arthur

It is with much regret that I am obliged, by the call of
duty elsewhere, to bid farewell, as Editor, to the members of the
Avicultural Society, though I hope I may be able still, occasion-
ally, to contribute to the pages of our Magazine. For seven and
a half years I have been in constant touch with our members
as the Honorary Editor of their journal, and during the whole of
that time I have received the greatest courtesy and help from
many true aviculturists and true friends ; and in handing the
work over to another I can only wish him the good fortune that
has been mine in receiving so much kind help and encouragement.
I should like to thank very sincerely all of those members
who have helped me so well in a task which has not always been
easy, and, at the same time, to ask them to continue their kind-
ness to my successor, in whose hands I have no doubt the journal
will prosper and increase in usefulness.
It is with much pleasure that I am able to announce that
Mr. Frank Finn, who is well known to our members as a most
careful and able worker and a great authority on avicultural
matters, has consented to take my place ; and I feel sure that the
magazine has a great future before it under his management.

Phlogccnas crinigera.
By T. H. Newman.
Probably no member of the great and beautiful order
Columbse attracts so much attention from the general public as
the common Bleeding-heart Pigeon, Phlogcenas luzonica, which
is certainly a startlingly beautiful bird, giving the impression of
having recently come out of a sanguinary battle, in which it has
apparently come off second best. But what shall be said of the
larger and far richer coloured subject of these notes? A glance
at Mr. Gronvold's very careful and exact drawing will show the
distribution of the colours, though no artificial process can re-
produce the exquisite sheen of the living bird. It must certainly
be reckoned one of the most harmoniously coloured birds in the
world.
It differs from its near ally by its larger size, the bars on
the wing are practically the same; in the common species the
general appearance is of a bird with an ashy grey upper surface
more or less tinged with green or pink according to the light;
in crinigera the top of the head, back of neck and mantle are of a
most beautiful green, glowing emerald-like in the sun ; the back,
scapulars, rump, upper tail-coverts and central tail feathers are
rich purple chestnut, the smaller feathers edged with metallic
green or pink according to the angle seen; the chin and throat
are pure white, which descends in a narrow line down each side
of the breast, dividing the green of the sides of the neck from
the beautiful large crimson maroon patch on the breast: this
patch, the # heart,' is much larger than in the common species,

Mr. T. H. Nkwman,
and, as the late Marquis of Tweedale noted in 1877, * s composed
of feathers of an even harsher and stiffer texture ; their bases in
both species are white. I notice that these feathers appear to
reach their full length before their sheaths burst; these then
present a curious appearance, being curved and narrower at each
end, rather resembling a miniature banana in shape. The under
surface is of a rich fawn colour, lighter on the middle of the
abdomen and under tail-coverts. The iris of both species has
been described as dark brown, this is more or less right for the
common bird, but even it has the iris tinged with bluish or
purplish; but Bartlett's bird has it of a most beautiful lilac colour
which perhaps most resembles the bloom found on hothouse
grapes and on some dark varieties of plums ; this adds very much
to the beauty of the bird. According to the British Museum
Catalogue of Birds the genus Phlogceuas comes under the head of
those with " Tarsus covered anteriorly with transverse scales or
scutellae" ; this is hardly correct at any rate for this member of
the genus, as the scales diminish rapidly in size from the toes
upwards, so as to leave about the upper third part of the tarsus
\0x25A0entirely devoid of scales.
The type in Paris was said to have come from the Sooloo
Islands, which locality seems to be incorrect; it does, however,
*occur in the neighbouring island of Basilan and in the large
island of Mindanao.
The first specimens seen in this country were purchased by
the late Mr. Bartlett from a dealer in Liverpool, in August, 1863,
\0x25A0consisting of one male and three females. Dr. Sclater, believing
them to be a new species, called them Phlogceuas bartletti, hence
the vernacular name ; an excellent plate by Wolf is given in
P.Z.S. for that year.
In P.Z.S., 1865, p. 239, Dr. Sclater describes the nesting of
the bird in the Gardens:--"I11 the following spring (1864) the
single male paired with one of the females, and bred five times
during the summer of 1864. The female deposited only one egg
on each occasion, making a very slight nest of small sticks in a
.flat basket placed 8 ft. above the ground in the Western Aviary.
The period of incubation was fifteen days; two of the young birds
were successfully reared, and are now in adult plumage, two

others died immature and are now in the British Museum. O11
the remaining occasion the egg was addled. The bird I now
exhibit is the breeding female, which, unfortunately, died a short
time since; but as the old male has mated with another female,
and the young male likewise shows symptoms of wishing to pair,
there seems every prospect of continuing to propagate this
highly interesting species in our aviaries." This pious wish only
seems to have been partially realized ; several specimens were
hatched in 1865 and one in 1867, after which the flock appears to
have died out, and the species has not been represented at the
Gardens since.
My pair reached me on 23rd July, 1907, from Mrs. Johnstone,
who had very kindly allowed me to have them. Three days later
I received the following most interesting letter from Mr. Walter
Goodfellow: " Mrs. Johnstone writes me this morning that you
have purchased a pair of Bleeding Heart Doves from her and re-
quests that I will give you any information that I can about them.
I fear that it is very little I can say ; I brought them to England
from Mindanao two years ago and believe they have always
enjoyed good health. They are by no means common in their
own country, and are very locally distributed around the somewhat
drier parts of the coast lands. I never shot any on either of my
expeditions to Mindanao, but I think I saw a pair on one occasion.
They are forest birds, but do not perch in the trees. You will
see they are far more beautiful than the ordinary Bleeding
Hearts. It is not at all likely that there are others in England
like them, for no birds come here from Mindanao or to anywhere
in Europe. I think I have brought over the only specimens of
these birds--two five years ago and three two years ago. Sir W.
Ingram had the first pair. One of these is still alive in Monte
Carlo. The other one of the last three got accidentally killed I
believe at Mrs. Johnstone's. When I was bringing them home
one got into a very weak state, and a few scraps of raw meat a
day, which I gave it, quite pulled it round. I believe they seem
to have done perfectly well on seeds alone, but they used, when
I had them, to be very fond of a little soaked bread or soft food."
The above letter contains all that I know about their wild
life; it is evident that they spend most of their time on the ground

Mr. T. H. Newman,
among thick bushes, flying at the sligliest noise so as easily to be
overlooked. They doubtless roost and nest in bushes and. low
trees at no great distance from the ground.
My birds spent nearly the whole of their time on the
ground, and had a wonderful way of hiding behind bushes and
of putting objects between themselves and the observer ; later
on they became much tamer and would hardly take any notice of
an intruder. They know full well how best to make use of all
their beauty when displaying; the cock had a curious habit,
turning in the direction of the hen, he would stand quite still,
and at regular intervals of a few seconds, would slowly raise his
wings to their full extent above his back ; this would be continued,
often for a considerable time, I think it was meant to attract the
lien towards him, he only did it when he could see her. The
display proper would begin by the cock lowering his head and
arching the wings so as to cause the bars to become very con-
spicuous ; he would then often pursue the hen, when quite
close he would suddenly stop, and, as it were reverse, that is to
say he would squat down in an upright position almost on his
tail, with head thrown back and breast fluffed out and protruded
so as to exhibit the " heart," the buff flank plumes, which are very
long and soft, standing well out on each side. Meanwhile he
would utter his curious rumbling coo. The sudden change from
lowered head and raised wings to the upright position was very
marked ; as is usual in such cases, the hen did not seem at all
impressed, but rather anxious to get out of the way ; they were
not very affectionate, and generally kept rather apart.
The birds came to me as a doubtful pair, though one (the
cock) was much larger and brighter coloured than the other,
which proved to be a hen. As the cock took to chasing its
companion, who could not fly, owing to an injury in the right
wing which seemed to prevent the primaries from growing, I
separated the birds in the late summer of 1907 for some time.
Early in 1908, the birds began to assert themselves more,
so that I suspected they were a pair, which was proved by my
finding, on 17th of June, an egg in a rough nest built in some
ivy only about 18 inches from the ground. The egg is large for
the size of the bird, decidedly tinted with cream-colour, and very

long in shape, one end being rather sharply pointed ; the shell is
rather smooth and glossy in texture. This first egg was broken
on the 23rd, when it was found to be addled. On July 5th,
another egg was laid in a nest made quite close to the first. On
the 8th an accident happened which might have ended fatally,
for I found the hen hung up by one leg to some of the material
of the nest which had become twisted round the foot; the nest
was dragged out of place, and the egg was on the ground, the
poor hen went lame for a day or two, and then quite recovered ;
one would have thought that this would have put her off nesting
for some time. I put the egg under some other doves, it also
proved to be addled ; I think it had got cracked from its fall. It
is this egg that is described above. O11 August 12th a third egg
was found, which was probably laid the previous day, the first
nest being again used. On the 27th of August, being a very wet
day, a young bird was found in the nest dead, with head injured
and yolk-sac not properly absorbed ; (I rather think the egg must
have been broken just before it was due to hatch). I placed it
in spirits ; it is scantily clad with very pale down, the bill is
long with only a very small egg-tooth on the upper mandible,
the breast is very plump for so young a bird, and the legs are
enormously developed ; it altogether presents a very strong
contrast to an infant Partridge Bronzewing ( Geophaps scripted)
which is its bottle-companion. Nothing daunted, the birds soon
made another nest, this time on the top of a small bush about 3
feet high ; how the hen got there I never knew, but I certainly
saw her jump off one day. On September 14th, I found a broken
egg on the ground, so that nest came to nothing. It will be
noticed that only one egg is mentioned for each sitting, thus
confirming the experience at the Gardens over 40 years before;
it is very curious that crinigera should only lay one egg, while
luzo7iica and platcnce , another allied Bleeding Heart, should lay
two at a clutch.
Some time before I had fixed a round hamper lid among
the ivy near to where the first nests had been made; sticks were
arranged so as to make it quite easy for the lieu to get up to it;
it was not three feet from the ground. Although I had never
seen the birds go near this provided nest, to my joy I found an

egg in it on September 26th. The birds sat splendidly ; from the
first the hen would let me stand quite close to her when sitting
without minding. On October 13th, both birds were sitting
together on the nest, which I had not seen them do before, and I
found the egg had hatched, making the period of incubation 17
days. On October 15th, I noticed that the young one was spar-
ingly covered with pale yellow down ; the flight feathers were
beginning to show through the skin. The hen did not leave the
nest, and resented my looking at the young one. On the 17th,
I first saw the young bird clearly; the male flew off the nest
making a good flutter, he raised his wings and ran out of the
bushes near me, evidently to attract my attention from the nest.
The young one was growing fast, the down on the upper surface
of body seemed rather darker (pale fawn), the primaries and
secondaries were sprouting well with other feathers in the wings,
no feathers visible anywhere else, eyes beginning to open.
20th, young one looking very well, feathers in wings
getting long, a few of the greater coverts just bursting and
showing dark fawn tips, the bill, which was flesh-coloured at first
was getting darker, two rows ot feathers on back, and tail
feathers beginning to show ; it was now one week old. 22nd,
sharp frost in the night; primaries beginning to burst, showing
dark chestnut tips contrasting with the fawn ones of the greater
coverts, head and crop-region beginning to show feathers in
sheath. 23rd, a great change since the previous day, many of
the small feathers on the wings having burst their sheaths,
showing dark brown with chestnut edges, three distinct fawn
coloured bands showed across the wing, which correspond to the
grey ones of the adult; bill and tarsus pinkish-grey, toes leaden-
grey, claws flesh-coloured. This was the first day I noticed the
old birds voluntarily leave the young one ; the weather was
milder than on the previous day.
26th, young one looking well, wings now quite fledged,
mantle and scapulars dark brown with narrow chestnut edges;
the blackish wing-coverts with their light tips form three broad
dark bands, separated by narrow buff ones, crop-region dark
brown with chestnut edges to the feathers, top of head chestnut,
the feathers having darker bases. 27th, cold damp morning after

much rain, }roung one fortnight old. First saw the hen feeding -
it, she stood on the edge of the nest with the young one in front
of her; it reached up to be fed, stretching its wings to their
fullest extent, so as to balance itself, one wing being stretched out
on each side of the parent's neck; it looked almost like some big
brown butterfly with its conspicuous wing bands; one wing was
often clinging round the mother's neck as if it was embracing her,
the wings were only flapped a little, and it occasionally uttered a
soft prolonged whistling squeak ; it was now almost too large to
be covered by the sitting parent, so that at least one wing could
be seen ; it never seemed to be left alone for a minute. 28th, wet
and foggy morning but warmer. The young one was alone in
the nest, when approached it suddenly got up and fluttered out of
the nest, its wings and legs were very well developed, but the tail
was very short, only just beginning to show; there was a pale,
whitish patch of feathers below the bare chin, no sign of red on
the breast, in fact this area was still bare; when replaced in the
nest it again flew out, this time settling quite lightly about two
yards away, and fluttered rather unsteadily along a path. 29th,
mild day, sun shining ; when first seen the female was on the nest
with the young one, she soon left it, when it walked to the edge
of the nest and seemed to wish to fly, presently it flew
strongly, though rather slowly, for about twelve feet, alighting
011 a thick log about a couple of feet from the ground ; this was
the first time I had seen it stand right up 011 its legs, which
were very long, the toes also seemed enormously developed. It
had not been there a minute, before it began to raise its wings at
intervals of a second or two, exactly as the old cock does when
he can see the hen ; it flew to the ground, and when approached,
flew the whole length of the flight, over 30 feet, against the wire
at the end, showing it could have gone further, and yet it was
only sixteen days old ; later on it flew up to a branch, 8 feet high.
When the young one was awa3% its mother went up to the nest
to look for it; she did not use the sticks I provided for that
purpose, but hopped up on to the top of a heap of stones on the
other side of the clump of ivy, and having gained a horizontal
branch, walked along it until she was above the nest, and then
&amp;apos; jumped down into it.

Mr. T. H. Newman,
About this time the hen frequently cooed ; she would
run after another bird, then suddenly stop, fluffing out her
feathers, and throwing herself back would utter her rattling coo;
it seemed to be the same as that of the cock, but not so loud,
also she did not throw herself so far backwards; I have not seen
her arch her wings as the male generally does, before he coos.
When walking the cock usually carried his tail slightly pointing
downwards following the curve of the back; on the other hand,
the hen invariably had hers rather raised. The 29th was the
last night the young one spent in the nest with its mother.
October 30th, the young bird very active on its legs; the
feathers on the cheeks are now beginning to expand and show
paler, but the whitish patch is inconspicuous unless the neck is
stretched upwards ; when crouching on the ground the bird is
very difficult to see ; the female is very attentive to it, picks
about on the ground as if trying to teach it to feed itself, but I
expect she was only picking up stray grains which had fallen
when feeding the young one. She frequently gently arranged
the feathers on the back and head of her offspring; this night
was spent on the ground with the hen brooding it, which speaks
very highly for the mother's devotion. I am quite sure the birds
never roost on the ground in the ordinary way.
31st. The young one spent the day on the ground, alter-
nately brooded and fed by both its parents. The hen seemed
anxious to get it to go under a heap of brushwood in the corner
which is piled up so as to form a shelter, but it did not seem to
understand, though she stood at the entrance and nodded her
head to it as though she wanted to feed it. When the hen left
the young one the cock came and sat by ; it afterwards it followed
him behind some bushes, he cooed in the usual rattling way but
softer than usual, then he uttered several low single notes which
I had not before heard. I think this must be the note used when
wishing to feed the young, but I had not heard the hen use any
note when feeding it. The young bird seemed very small to
leave the nest; it was barely half as large as its parents, but, by
the way, it could fly it would be able to get away if danger
threatened. Whenever the male approached the female she
retired ; for some days past he had been chasing her with arched

wings, doubtless thinking of nesting once more. I saw the cock
feed the young one, but he was much shyer about it than the
hen and did not like being watched. About five o'clock the
young one flew up to a thick perch where it passed the night
alone and quite iu the open. The next morning it was being
brooded on the ground by its mother; that night was passed in a
willow near its parents.
The young one now spent its days on the ground, gradually
becoming more active and independent, always flying up to a
perch and roosting alone at dusk ; at four weeks old the tail was
getting noticeable and the first beginning of the "heart" began
to appear. As the nights of November the 9th and 10th were
very cold and frosty I put the young one under shelter. It began
to feed itself when about a month old ; the nape and back of neck
began about this time to assume a green tint, which became
gradually brighter ; the crown, however, still remained chestnut.
The red patch on the heart began to show when about six weeks
old, there was a distinct groove down the centre of the breast,
which up to now had been bare of feathers ; the red patch at first
appeared in the form of red stripes down the breast. I last saw
the young one fed by the cock on Dec. 4, when it was over seven
weeks old.
On Dec. 18 I had the shock of finding the old hen dead ;
she had seemed perfectly well, and I was very sorry to lose her,
as, apart from her rarity, she had proved herself such a devoted
mother that I had become quite attached to her. A little over a
week later the young one followed her ; it had been hatched too
late and the wonder was it had lived so long and done so well.
During the very severe weather in January last the toes of the
cock became slightly frosted ; during the whole of the time I had
these birds they would always persist in roosting in the open,
and, though the first winter seemed to have been gone through
I without any ill effects, the exceptional severity of the last one
was I think too much for them. They certainly seem much
hardier than the common species. The cock died on the 18th of
March of this year. Thus sadly ends the history of this most
delightful and interesting family.

become extinct there is no reason why the life of this species
should not be indefinitely prolonged. It is most beautiful, hardy
and willing to breed in our aviaries ; where will you find its
equal ?
The nearest ally to Bartlett's would seem to be Keay's
Bleeding-heart (Phlogcsnas keayi), which is somewhat interme-
diate between it and the common species. It comes from the
Island of Negros, which lies between the habitats of its two
allies ; it resembles crinigera in its green head and neck and
purplish chestnut upper surface, while it has the bright red
patch on the breast like luzonicci, but differs from both by the
absence of dark bars on the wing and its white abdomen, while
a conspicuous white baud crosses the lesser wing-coverts.
Though this fine bird was only made known to science in
1900, Mr. Keay had known it for nearly twenty years before and
had kept it in cages several times.

I am not aware whether or not this very interesting little
bird has been successfully bred in captivity in England. I have
been very successful in breeding it in an out-door aviary in
Calcutta, and a short account of my experience may be found
of interest.
My aviary is merely a patch of ground, 24 feet square,
enclosed and roofed with wire netting, and with a covered shelter
at one end. I have dotted the enclosure about with a few shrubs
and tall grass, and its occupants are a variety of small finches,
together with some Waxbills, Weavers, Ground-larks of kinds
and several varieties of Quails. Among the latter, I had a dozen
Jungle Bush-Quail (three cock birds and nine hens) and on the
ground at the sides and corners of the aviary I placed a few
small baskets filled with soft grass.
Two of the Bush-Quail hens selected one of these baskets
as a common nesting-place and having laid ten eggs in it,

proceeded to sit jointly on them. Every two or three hours-
during the day, one or the other of them would leave the nest
for ten minutes or so, to feed and roll in the dust. The cock
birds, I noticed, never approached the nest during the incubation
period, but on the eighteenth day I found the whole flock of
twelve Bush-Quails huddled together on and around the nest,
and about two hours later they left the spot followed by nine
young birds.
Thenceforward, the whole of the adult birds appeared to
constitute themselves the common parents of the new arrivals,
the cock-birds however taking the larger share in looking after
and feeding the latter and brooding them. For the first week
the chicks fed mainly on gentles. After that, they took to grain,
though they were also quite partial to small grasshoppers..
Within three weeks they were fully fledged, though it was not
until some six weeks later that the distinctive markings of the
male birds made their appearance. From first to last I had no
trouble in the bringing up of the young birds. Soft food of some
kind for the first few days of their existence is apparently a sine
qua 7 io?i , and, according to my experience, both with the first and
the subsequent broods which I have succeeded in rearing, gentles
admirably answer the purpose.
The cock Bush-Quail at all ordinary times is an exceedingly
pugnacious bird,* but, as soon as young birds make their appear-
ance, the adult cocks temporarily sink their differences with each
other in order to join in the quaint patriarchal system of family-
rearing which I have described above.
I should like very much to know whether this bird has
been successfully bred by any other member of the Avicultural
Society.
It is one of the species kept by the natives of India as a fighting bird.--E d.

WITH REFERENCES TO SOME KINDRED SPECIES.
By Reginald Phillipps.
(Concluded from page 219.)
My Ruby, poor little woman, has led a very lonely life.
I have kept many different Bulbuls in my time; but, in a place
like mine with but limited accommodation, most Bulbuls become
a nuisance sooner or later, and I have discarded them, but mak-
ing an exception with the present case because it is rare and so
little known. And so it is that she has had no allied species to
associate with, no kindred spirit--with but one exception. Even
the presence of the second Ruby I have mentioned did not
seem to appeal to her ; but at that time she was not quite up to
the mark. During the period of over five years she has passed
with me, with one brief interval she has been alone in a crowd,
she has not made friends, she has not sought the company of
any bird, neither has any' bird sought hers.
For quite a long time, among the most spiteful and
pertinacious of her tormentors were the two Silver-eared Mesias
which were written about in the October and November issues
of 1903. In course of time the female died ; and, in October,
1905, the male Mesia and the female Ruby-tliroated Bulbul
commenced a friendship which continued until May, 1906, when,
owing to his loud voice, I had to send the Mesia away.
During the first two (see below) of the Bulbul's broody
fits, which dated from January, 1906, she had the Mesia for her
mate. He would often come and sit by her, but I fear was not
very sympathetic ; he seemed to think that she must be a jolly
fool to go to nest in mid-winter, and to sit so diligently upon
nothing. "I should like to see the colour of your eggs" he
would say, and intimated plainly that a sex which could give
way to such childish vagaries proved itself thereby to be con-
stitutionally unfit to have the vote. During her third broody
period, she keenly felt the loss of his companionship, and would
sometimes be very noisy, coming off her "nest" with a loud

twit, too-wit, tiddle-de-wink, tell-me-where-are-you, and other
calls, quite unlike her usual self. This restlessness continued
all through the summer ; she would have been off and away after
a mate if she had had the chance, after the manner of the mate-
less free bird. It was at this time that she gave utterance to
those wild bell-like calls which I have already alluded to.
For long long after the departure of the Mesia, his well
known call Wife: you-just-covie-here (N.S. I., p. 381) might still be
heard in the garden and bird room--not, indeed, as of yore,
shouted in imperative dictatorial voice, in a voice so masterful,
and yet so precious because so masterful, but borne softly on the
wind, like a whisper in the ear, as a murmur in the trees, a dream
in the stillness of the night, in a tone soft and still, in a note
passing sweet and gentle, so full of love and tender reminiscences*
Whence came it ? was it from his wraith ? an echo from the
tomb? Was he haunting his old beloved home where he had
spent so many happy hours? Alas! no; it was his poor little
widowed Ruby, disconsolate, forlorn, mourning over his dis-
appearance, and repeating to herself his familiar words. Who
shall say that her appealing calls for a mate were for any mate !
peradventure they were intended but for one ear ! And the fact
remains that from that time up to this day she has remained
isolated and alone, happy enough in a quiet humdrum sort of
way, but-- alone.

to drive her off, as I feared her health might suffer, but my

move but showed fight, more often she would flit on to the
nearest perch, give a twttter, stretch her limbs, take a " taste,"
and return to duty with unruffled composure.

laid, as far as is known, until 1908. The " nest " in every case was

*simply a scratch in the sand 011 the floor of one or other of the
" houses " in the birdroom ; at first she would scratch in the sand
with her feet like any old hen ; but little by little she became less
careful in this respect, and at times made use of any depression
that might appear suitable. It is in these "houses " that I place
rock-salt, etc.; and she usually selected a spot under the shelter
of a large lump of this substance. O11 rare occasions I have seen
her searching in the garden for a nesting-site, but nothing
pleased her, and she invariably returned to the shelter of the
birdroom. It is likely that she feels safer there than elsewhere.
As a rule, the other birds did not interfere with her. Once
she elected to nest in a house which is near to the domains of the
Varied Lorikeets. At pretty regular intervals, the male Lorikeet,
followed at a prudent distance by the female, would climb down
and invade this house and attack the Bulbul; then would follow
such a hullaballoo, wild screamings on the one side and indignant
twitterings on the other; then the Lorikeets, unable to lay hold
of her, would solemnly retire to their den, the Bulbul, like an
alchemist of the Middle Ages, would return to her pathetic task
of endeavouring to change grains of sand into infant Rubies,
and Silence would reign supreme once more. The Lorikeets
were as unsuccessful as I was in endeavouring to stop her sitting,
for, hardly waiting for the tail of the last to clear out of the way,
she would give an impudent twit-too-wit and return to her post
forthwith.
One day last autumn, I entered the birdroom and put up
a fledgeling Lovebird, who chanced to alight not very far from
the sitting Bulbul. With a wild unearthly scream, she attacked
the Lovebird so suddenly and savagely that the poor beast
dashed heedlessly off anywhere in frantic terror as for its life.
This frightful shriek seems to be a recognised weapon in the
armoury of the Bulbuls. In July, 1902, at page 185, I mentioned
a similar ear-splitting shriek emitted by a Brown-eared Bulbul,
Hemixus flavala, for a nefarious purpose, in which it, too, was
quite successful in the object it had in view.
Only one egg is known to have been laid by my Ruby-
throated Bulbul, and this was found in her scratch on August 27
of last year. This egg is of a reddish puce colour (of a lighter

shade towards the smaller end) mottled and spotted all over
with a darker shade of the same. I find that it is intermediate
in size between the egg of the Silver-eared Mesia and that of
the Black Lark--but bulkier in shape.
This species is only known from the islands of Java and
Sumatra. -
I will now briefly refer to the Indian Ruby-throated
Bulbul, and to two other kindred species : for my bird has been
mistaken for at any rate one of the latter, and that by those who
might have known better.
The Indian Ruby-throated Bulbuu, Rubigula gularis,
is almost a duplicate of R. dispar. It is stated to be a little
smaller, with a less clear black chin-spot, to have more yellow in
the plumage above and less orange in the yellow below. The
Museum Catalogue (VI., 167) gives the throat patch as "orange
scarlet," Jerdon (II., 87) as " beautiful shining ruby-red," and
"the rest of the plumage beneath bright yellow," and " irides
light yellow." As regards the latter, I do not know if there is
any difference between the sexes. Jerdon says of the throat,
" the feathers much divided and somewhat bristly." The Museum
Catalogue does not mention this, but says of R. dispar, " feathers
of the throat loose and stiffened."
This species is found only in the forests of the South
Indian Peninsula, and, as a live bird, seems to be little known.
It does not seem ever to have been brought to this country;
possibly it has never been seen in the Indian bird markets. Mr.
Frank Finn once wrote me that he knew the species only as a skin,
adding " I see Oates gives it as a rare forest bird even in India."
Jerdon tells us,--" This pretty species is found only in the forests
of Malabar, extending from Travancore to North Canara. It is
found from the level of the sea nearly to about 2,000 feet of
elevation. It is not common, frequents the more open spots and
glades in thick jungle, and is usually found in the neighbourhood
of water. It lives in small families, is sprightly and active,
hopping about the smaller branches of trees, and uttering now
and then its pleasant twitter, much in the manner of the crested
Bulbuls. Its food consists chiefly of fruits and berries."
These two are the only species in Rubigula which have
the ruby throat.

On the Black-headed Bulbul, etc.
The Black-headed Bulbul, Rubigula melanidera, with
the entire head black, is a trifle smaller than the foregoing, and
generally like them, but has the throat yellow like the rest of the
under surface. Sexes alike, but with the female the smaller. It
is said of the iris of the adults-- male, dull red ; female , dark
brown ; and also of the legs and feet-- male , blackish ; female,
deep plumbeous or blackish blue. The British Museum Catalogue
(VI., 168) says further:--"The Black-headed Bulbul is peculiar
to the island of Ceylon, inhabiting the forest tracts in most
parts of the island, and, in the Kandyan province, attaining a
height of 5,000 feet."
When we consider what a vast number of steamers of all
kinds touch at Colombo, it seems strange that this species also
should be unknown in this country except as a skin.*
The Black-crested Yellow-Bulbul, Otocompsa flavi-
ventris (Mus. Cat. VI., 161), the Rubigula flaviventris of Jerdon
(II, 88), was brought to this country in 1906, two examples being
deposited at the Zoological Gardens in April of that year by one
of our members. The likeness between this species and my bird
is only general, and the two may be distinguished at a glance by
any observant person. For instance, the Black-crested Yellow-
Bulbul has a real and conspicuous crest, instead of a mere knob,
and a black instead of a red throat; moreover, it is not nearly so
yellow as either of the Ruby-throated Bulbuls.
This species has a wide range. The Museum Catalogue
tells us that--"The Black-crested Yellow-Bulbul inhabits the
Himalayas, and also occurs in the forests of Central India.
Eastwards it extends through the Burmese countries into Cochin
China ; " and the more recent Hand-Eist--" Himalayas (Sutlej
Valley to Assam); Indian Peninsula; Indo-Chinese Provinces;
Malay Peninsula." Although so comparatively common, the
two birds mentioned above seem to be the only two that have so
far reached this country alive ; and the dealer in Bombay from
whom they were purchased, who called them " Nepal Bulbuls, '
stated that they were rare, and charged a higher price for them
than for a pair of Silver-eared Mesias.
* According to my experience, hardly any birds are to be picked up in Colombo,
the only noteworthy species X have seen on sale there is the Ceylonese Bat-parrot (Loriculus
indiczis). --Ed.

The path followed the folds of the azalea-clad mountain,
now near, now far from the noisy torrent, but ever trending
upwards towards the snows that sparkled in the distant sunlight.
At last it took a sharp bend and opened to view a little brown
village, nestling in a grove of pines and spruces. As we drew
nearer I noticed that three bamboo cages were hanging from the
walls of one of the houses--the village tea-house as it afterwards
proved to be. Upon closer acquaintance I found that these cages
contained a Varied Tit, a Japanese Bullfinch and two other birds;
one of the latter, obviously the male, being surprisingly beauti-
ful. These were Japanese Rose-Finches, known to ornithologists
by the unlovely title of Uragus or Carpodacus sanguinolentus.
Personally I prefer to think of a pretty bird by a pretty name and
A'oy^-Finches certainly do not seem as sweet to me by their other
and scientific name!
Now, when I first came to Japan, I had earnestly resolved
to resist all temptation in the form of live birds--for full well did
I know what trouble they meant when travelling from country
to country ! Had I not resisted the superb Ruby-throats and
dear little Suthoras at Shanghai, and again the handsome Blue
Flycatchers and the rare Temminck's Robins at Nagasaki ? But
these Rose-Finches were more than the heart of an aviculturist
could forego ! I did not even demur when the inn-keeper asked
me a comparatively large figure for them. I was only too well
pleased to think that he would part with them at all.
Well, having completed the first part of the bargain I next
had to consider the question of food. Being away from any town
and in the wilds of the mountains, it was essential that I should
buy some seeds for the birds there and then, while the opportu-
nity offered. I, therefore, again negotiated with the ridiculously-
polite inn-keeper--and by the twinkle in his eye I believe the
old fellow again had the best of the deal!
From that moment the two Rose-Finches never left us.
In their flimsy bamboo-cage, that had once hung on a tea-house
in the far away Niklco mountain, they travelled with us to many
places in Japan--then they crossed to Vladivostock. From Via-

divostock the train carried them westward across the steppes of
North Manchuria and through the flower-studded plains of
Siberia, to Moscow. From Moscow they went to Berlin ; from
Berlin to Ostend, and, before the summer was out, they reached
the shores of England. And how many times, during those long,
dreary days in the Trans-Siberian train, did we feel grateful that
these little birds were with 11s, to keep us entertained by their
cheery ways and lively twitterings? When the train pulled up at
some countryside station (which, alas, it did only too frequently)
I would sometimes venture away to gather grasses and weeds for
them--and on more than one occasion I was nearly left behind !
Apart from the delicate colouring of the male's plumage
--silvery white, pink, rose-red and fawn--these Finches were
very attractive to the eye, for they were extremely graceful in
form and their movements were both elegant and sprightl}''. The
male in particular had a pretty habit of frequently erecting the
feathers on the crown of his head, and this was especially the
case when he was uttering his short melodious little ditty. This
song was certainly not striking, being hardly more than a
pleasant twittering or low warble, but at the same time it had
the merit of being a gay and cheerful sound. The female, of
course, was a more soberly-clad bird and lacked the beautiful
carmine tints that characterised her spouse.
After the autumn moult the male lost much of his beauty,
as is the case with so many of the Palsearctic Finches, and he
never regained the bright dress that he wore in the days of his
freedom. But when the spring came round he was nevertheless
inclined to court his mate and both birds kept toying with their
grass and carried bits of it round the cage, evidently seeking a
nesting-site. At the moment I had no suitable aviary to give
them, but I intended to have one made immediately, and even
went so far as to give the order. However, I was then called
away from home, and later, I went to Norway for a month's
salmon fishing. So the summer slipped by and a golden oppor-
tunity was lost, alas ! never to be repeated. During the winter
months the female died.
I think I have observed elsewhere that the Japanese are
fond of keeping birds, and during my two visits to their islands,

On a peatliar Nesting Site of Mallard.
I saw a number of species in captivity ; but my two Rose-Finches
were the only ones that came under my notice. I fancy this
species must be fairly rare, or else of very local distribution, for
I never met with it in a wild state, although I devoted much of
my time to ornithology and visited widely separated districts.
It is probably a mountain bird, breeding in the pine-forests of
the more northern ranges; but I believe its eggs are still unknown
to science.
In summer the adult male has the head pearly or silvery
white, with the forehead and lores, close to the base of the bill,
rose-red. The upper surface shades from pinkish to rosy-carmine
on the rump, the back being streaked with dark brown. The
breast is also rose-coloured but is whiter about the throat and
neck. The female, of course, is much duller, brown or fawn
being the prevailing hue. Both sexes have two more or less
distinct whitish bars across the wings. The tail, which is com-
paratively long, is blackish with the outer feathers white ; it is
usually carried in a slightly raised position, and is frequently
being flicked to and fro, a habit that serves to give the birds a
perky and almost insolent appearance.
On the continent of North-east Asia, this species has a
near ally in Uragus sibiricjcs, a rather larger and less brilliant
bird.

On April 5th, while walking round one of our ponds, I
happened to see a Mallard duck fly out of a large oak tree grow-
ing on the side of a pool.
I returned for a ladder, and on climbing up was surprised
to find a duck's nest containing six eggs. The eggs, which were
placed in a natural hollow in the fork of the tree, were quite
exposed, and what nest there was consisted of small pieces of
bark and twigs off the oak tree.
Once more I returned home, this time for my camera and
a measuring tape. To photograph the nest I had a good deal of
bother fixing up my camera in the tree, as half a gale was blow-

ing, but eventually, by securely binding the legs of the camera to
boughs, I managed to make some exposures.
No. i gives a good idea of the site (the nest being just
behind where the egg is held), and
No. 2 shows the nest and eggs " in situ."
On measuring the height I found the nest to be fourteen
feet from the ground. Unfortunately, being in such an exposed
place the eggs were all frosted and spoilt.
It would be interesting to know in what manner the duck
would have managed to get her young down to the water.
[It is not very uncommon for Mallard to nest in trees, especially in
the heads of pollard willows ; sometimes also the deserted nest of another
large bird is utilized. In cases like this the young are simply allowed to
jump out and take their luck, which is usually good, as the fall does not
seem to hurt them.--E d.]

Among the visitors to my garden in Bloemfontein, one of
the most interesting is the Bacbakiri Shrike (Laniariusgutturalis).
A pair usually come in the early morning before I get up and
waken me with their loud ringing call-note as they hop about
in the leafy pepper trees. This tree ( schinus molle) is an in-
troduction from Australia, I believe ; it is an evergreen and in
winter bears long bunches of dry, reddish-coloured, hot-flavoured
berries, which are largely eaten by the various fruit-eating birds,
like the Pied Barbet (7 richolaevia melanoleucus ), Pale White-eye
(Zosterops pallida ), Bayards' and the Blackish Bulbul (Pycnonotus
layardi and P. ?iigrica?is&amp;apos;) and the Red-faced Coly ( Colius erythro-
melori ), all of which are to be seen from my windows at various
times of the day, both in the trees and at a bird-table which holds
decayed potatoes, old bananas, bird-seed, etc.
The Red-backed Shrike (. Lanins collurio ) visits us on mi-
gration, but its cousin the Jack Hanger or Fiscal ( L . collaris ) is
always here, the usual post of observation being the top of one of
the poles holding up the wire-netting surrounding the tennis-
court, from where morning and evening the cock gives us his
song--a song which would be quite pleasant were it not for the

harsh note which runs through it and sounds like--' Shadrach--
oh leave it--Shadrach-rack-rack oh leave it' constantly repeated.
Three species of doves are very common : the Senegal,
Cape Turtle Dove {Turtur capicola) and the charming little Cape
or Namaqua Dove ( CEna capensis~). I found two nests of this
latter species last June, which is nearly the middle of winter here ;
one of the nests was on top of a furrow in a ploughed field and
not a bush near it. I presume the eggs must have been near
hatching time, as the little hen would only go a few feet away from
her treasures, and as soon as I moved away she flew to them at
once and settled herself down in the most confidential manner.
The Cape Sparrow ( Passer arcuatus) and a little Fantail
Warbler ( Cisticola ) nest in the creepers on the verandah; the
latter shows marvellous skill in just avoiding the cat. Its eggs
show great variations, blue with reddish spots being the usual
type, but I have seen white, white with red spots, pale blue, deep
blue and greenish with no spots; from different nests of course,
those from each nest being of the same general type.
Cabanis's Thrush ( Turdus cabanisi ) a bird much resembling
our hen Blackbird of home and the Ground Scraper Thrush ( &amp;apos;Tur-
dus litsitsirupa ) come occasionally, but are always very shy and
rather uninteresting, especially as I have never heard them sing.
Jan Friedrick or the Cape Robin ( Cossypha cafra ) on the
other hand, sings beautifully though not very loudly, and every
evening its clear melancholy notes can be heard from the depths
of a thick pepper-tree. I find this species difficult to ' meat off,'
but once used to captivity it stands cage life well and sings well.
One I took home in&amp;apos; 1906 sang finely during the voyage and was
doing well when I gave it to the Zoo. It is quarrelsome to a
degree with its own kind, but harmless with other species.*
The common Weavers (. Hyphantornis velatuas and Quelea russi)
swarm, and do much damage to the farmers, but the only thing
i .that I dislike about them is their song.
i G
The Cape Wagtail ( Motacilla capensis) is a resident here
and sings quite sweetly ; it is a dull coloured little thing, but its
i |cleverly-concealed nest is always interesting, as it is so frequently
the host of the Didric or Green Cuckoo.
\
* The specimen alluded to by Captain Horsbrugh is still alive at the Zoo, where also may
be seen the Red-capped Lark and Blackish Bulbul, recently received there. -Ed.

246 On Birds of a Bloemfontein Garden.
The little Red-capped Lark ( Tephrocorys cinereal) simply
swarms here and is found in winter in flocks like our English
Skylark, which it much resembles in flight and note, except
that it does not sing. I picked up a very feeble one in immature
plumage, which was quite weak through having its ears and head
smothered in huge ticks. These I cleaned off and the bird was
soon quite flourishing in my aviary, where it shared the floor
with another common species here, the Grey-backed Finch-Lark
{Pyrrhulauda verticalis).
I was in the Kalahari Desert some time ago, and while
waiting at a water-hole to shoot Sandgrouse hundreds of these
little Pyrrhulaudas , both of this species and the little dark one
called the Dark-naped Lark (Z 5 . australis ) came for their morning
drink, and it was most remarkable to notice their great numbers
and extreme tameness.
The little Streep Kopje (stripe-head) or Cape Bunting
(Fruigillaria capensis ) is always pottering about on the stones,
singing his monotonous little song, and this little bird and his
cousin the Lark-like Bunting ( Fimpetuani ), who is equally
common, frequents all the gardens.
Three species of Starlings are here in winter: the Green
Glossy Starling (. Lamprocolius phcenicopterns bispecularis), locally
called ' glass-eye ' from its orange irides, the Common Spreo
(Spreo bicolor ), and the interesting Wattled Starling ( Dilophus
canmculatus), which goes about in company with .S. bicolor in the
winter. In the summer it goes off to the thickly bushed part of
the country, where it builds a nest like a Magpie, but breeds in
colonies or collections of nests. It is on the protected list through-
out the year ; I don't quite see why it is necessary to protect it,
as no one shoots it or worries about it, and it is very wild and
well able to take care of itself. Moreover, I do not believe it
kills as many locusts as the framers of the law for its protection
give it credit for. Spreo bicolor nests in holes in banks as a rule,
and lays a large blue egg of the usual Starling pattern.
This list comprises most of the commoner birds that are
seen from time to time, but I have taken 110 account of the
various hawks and eagles that come by day, nor of the owls that
worry the birds in my aviary by night; I trust, however, these
notes will be of some interest to aviculturists at home.

REARING DEMOISELLE CRANES UNDER HEN.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.96651096" page_id="32659883"  page_num="247" year="" vol="">
Sir,--M y Demoiselle Crane is now laying for the first time, and, as I
think the eggs will be fertile, I shall be glad of information as to whether
or not it is possible to rear these birds with a hen.
I think that Mr. Hubert D. Astley, when writing in the Avicullural
Magazine about Cranes, a year or two since, said that in was the custom in
some parts of Europe to collect the eggs of these birds for the purpose
of rearing under hens.
On the other hand, I understand that Mr. St. Qnintin, who has
reared young Demoiselles with the parent birds, says that the young do not
flourish unless the parent birds can find them plenty of natural food for the
first twelve days.
My Crane has at present only laid one egg, but I suppose I may
expect another; I doubt if she will sit well.
I should be glad of information as to whether it is possible to rear
with a hen, and as to how long the eggs take to hatch, and how the young
should be fed. Are earthworms, maggots, etc., good?
C. Barney Smith.
The folloiving reply has been sent to Mr. Barnby Smith:--
I do not think you would have any difficulty in rearing j&amp;apos;oung
Demoiselle Cranes under a hen ; the incubation period is about four weeks.
The hen should be a gentle, quiet one, as the young Cranes will need to be
fed by hand for the first week or two. I should give earthworms and
maggots (well-scoured), with mealworms, crickets, and cockroaches if
procurable, but artificial food, such as is given to young Pheasants, can
also be used, since you, and not the old ones, will do the feeding.

YOUNG BLACK-CHEEKED LOVEBIRDS DYING IN SHELL.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998629631578947" page_id="32659883"  page_num="247" year="" vol="">
Colonel Henry Fortescue would be much obliged if he can be given
any explanation regarding the following case. He has had a pair of Black-
cheeked Lovebirds since last December. They have been kept in a large
cage in a conservatory with an average temperature of 50 p to 55 p during
the winter months.
Both birds seem in excellent health. I11 January the'hen laid seven
eggs in a large cocoanut shell. She sat hard for fourteen days, then less
regularly for three days, and then left the eggs altogether.
Inside the eggs the young birds were fully formed and apparently
almost ready for hatching.
In the second half of April the hen again laid three eggs. .She has
sat for fourteen days. Yesterday one egg was thrown out of the nest and
replaced, and again thrown out this morning. It contained a dead chick
nearly ready to leave the shell.
The hen shows every inclination to desert the remaining eggs.
Colonel Fortescue would be grateful for any information to account
for this behaviour on the part of the birds.
P.S.--Colonel Fortescue has a large outdoor aviary, roofed with
glass and sheltered.

Co? respondence.
Possibly the birds might breed better if turned out; in this case
would it be too early in the year to put them outside ?
The lowest temperature in the outdoor aviary at night is not at
present ever lower than between 50 0 and 55 Q .
The following reply has been sent lo Colonel Fortescue :--
I am strongly inclined to think your Lovebirds have been disturbed.
I have found these birds shy sitters, and if the eggs were left too long, the
young would die in the shell and the nest would be deserted as you describe.
I11 the early days of sitting, if the hen were disturbed or frightened,
it would not matter much, but just when the young are due to hatch, it is
of great importance, as they die quickly if the eggs get cold.
If you turn the birds outdoors, a warm morning must be chosen, with
every probability of a warm night; it would, too, be advisable to keep them
in an unheated room for a day or two before turning them into the aviary,
so that they would feel the change less.
The cocoanut husk should be hung in a sheltered place in the aviary,
and in all probability, the birds will nest successfully.

Sir,-- 111 the May number of the Avicnllural Magazine, you have a
letter from Mr. Arthur, of Melksham, concerning the Stanley Parrakeet, in
wdiich he stated I assured him, when he bought a pair about thirteen
months ago, that there was no difference between the male and female.
This statement is incorrect; I told him at the time there was as much
difference in the sexes of the Stanleys as there is in the Many-Colours.

The regret which all our members will feel 011 parting with Mr.
Setli-Smith as our 1 Editor, will no doubt be considerably modified by the
knowledge that the duties which have caused him to resign the Editorship
are those of Bird Curator and Officer of Works at the Loudon Zoological
Gardens, which he has now undertaken.
The personal qualities which have made Mr. Setli-Smitli so popular
with all of us in his Editorial capacity, to say nothing of his avicultural
experience,will be of even more service to the avicultural community in his
greatly widened sphere of activity at the Gardens; indeed, his appointment
there is the greatest avicultural event that has happened of recent years,

The outside attachment of the Small Birds' House, shown
in our frontispiece this month, will no doubt be the great attrac-
tion for avicultural visitors, and I think most people will agree
that it is, in plan, about a model of what an aviary of the lean-to
type should be.
I have heard that the flights have been criticized as not
being high enough, but with this I do not agree, as a too high
flight is a great nuisance when birds have for any reason to be
caught, and if higher than the I&amp;apos;oosting-house it is always a
temptation for the birds to roost outside, and makes it very
difficult to drive them in. This defect has always been a great
objection to the fine centre dome of the Western Aviary at the
Zoo.
In the new aviaries are to be seen some very beautiful
species, which appear to great advantage among green outdoor
surroundings ; among these may be specified Raggi's and Lawes's
Birds of Paradise (Paradisea raggiana and Parotia lawesi ), Scarlet
Tanagers, Yellow-winged Sugar-birds, Australian Blue Wrens,
and Parrot Finches.
In one of the detached aviaries on the Canal Bank, which
is appropriately fitted up with rocks and boughs, four Keas
(Nestor notabilis), the sheep-killing Parrots of New Zealand, are
disporting themselves with the restless and meddlesome energy
so characteristic of this bird. Their movements, both on wing
and on foot, are not at all like those of other Parrots, but much
resemble a Raven's. They seldom use their bills in climbing,
and frequently hop both among boughs and on the ground, while
their wing-action is Crow-like.

Aviculture at the Zoo.
In the big Waders' aviary, opposite the Eastern Aviary,
a pair of the curious Tufted Umbre or Hammerkop (Scopus
umbrella&amp;apos;) are engaged in nesting, but seem undecided as to their
site. I have several times seen them pair; at this time they
utter a chattering scream, a point worth noting, as noisiness
when pairing is characteristic of birds of prey, and this curious
Stork has a strangely Buzzard-like plumage and a soft light flight,
more like a Hawk than a Wader.
In the small Wader's aviary a Reeve is sitting, and the
very old and shabby-looking Lapwing who has for years been
mated to a Ruff, has made another unsuccessful attempt to hatch
out an egg. It is a pity she cannot succeed, for a Ruff-Lapwing
hybrid would be worth looking at!
Two Secretary-birds have been pinioned and turned out in
the Elands' paddock, where they look very impressive stalking
about. I believe that this is the best way of keeping all birds
which use their legs more than their wings--that is to say, if a
large space is available ; in a small area they are better kept under
wire with full wings.
Some recent additions new to the collection, or rare, may
be noted : --
Green Troupiae (Ostinops viridis) from Venezuela. A
large species, as big as a Jay ; olive-green with yellow side
tail-feathers, and bright blue eyes. It is hand-reared and very
tame, perching on the hand. I do not know of any other having
been imported.
South-American Flamingo (.Phcenicopterus ignip a Hiatus).
Very similar to the European Flamingo, but much smaller, and
with the thighs and shanks lead-colour, only the hocks and feet
being pink. This has been exhibited before, but never in my
time.
Townsend's Solitaire (_.Myiadesies townsendi). A plain
grey bird about the size of a thrush, with a very short bill ; a
"soft-bill" and a fine singer. It comes from Mexico, and is
known as the Clarino. Mr. W. Frost had one some time back.
White-RUMPED Lory (Eos fuscaia). A very dark Lory,
mostly black, but with some red markings, especially below, and
with a white patch on the lower back, unique among Lories. It
is new to the collection, and to British aviculture.

The month of June, the most important month of the year
for nesting birds, has this year been most disappointing in the
way of weather conditions and extremely trying for the more
\0x25A0delicate of the foreign birds.
The most suitable aviary for breeding at present in the
gardens is the enclosure between the Monkey House and the Ape
House. This is divided into four compartments and at the present
time, birds are nesting in each of these. In one, a pair of Austra-
lian Rails (Rallies pectoralis&amp;apos;) made a nest in a tuft of grass at the
foot of a small bush, and on June 7th, brought off five chicks,
tiny black mites like young Moorhens. One was found dead the
following morning, but the other four are now half as large as their
parents. They are wonderfully clever at hiding themselves. I
have sometimes seen the mother brooding the four in the open,
have seen the hen leave them and the chicks remain for a
\0x25A0moment huddled together in a bunch. Presently they all
disappear in a twinkling; each one running in a different
direction, and hiding in the grass, and though one may enter the
aviary and make a careful search it is practically an impossibility
to discover their whereabouts.
A Grey-winged Ouzel is sitting steadily in the same
compartment as the Rails, her Blackbird-like nest built on the
stump of an old mulberry tree.
I11 another compartment is a hen Australian Ouail,
\0x25A0Coturnix pectoralis , mated to a cock Rain Quail. She has been
sitting her full time of sixteen days, and to-day I noticed two
\0x25A0empty egg-shells outside her nest though she had not yet left
with her brood.
A cock Varied Hemipode sits within a few yards of the
Quail, his mate taking no further notice of him now that she has
once deposited her eggs and left them to his care ; and, not far from
the Tutnix is a Tatanpa Tinamou, another species in which the

Mr. C. Barnby Smith,
male performs the duties of incubation and nursing. Here the
cock is sitting on five or six beautiful pink eggs.
A common Partridge has just brought off a brood of no
less than nineteen chicks from twenty eggs, an extraordinary
clutch indeed, and all laid by the one bird.
A pair of Malabar Mynahs are sitting in a nest in a box in
one of these aviaries.
The new flight cages to the Bird House are more suitable
for exhibiting birds than for their nesting, but we hope some may
succeed in rearing broods here. At present two young Black
Tanagers have been hatched in a nest in a small box tree in one
of these flights, and one so far appears to be doing well.
Several pairs of birds from the Bird House have been
transferred to the Pheasantries for breeding, and two pairs of St.
Helena Seed-Eaters have young.
A full-winged Wigeon made her nest in the middle of a
flower bed near the Three-island pond and hatched off eight
ducklings on June 6th ; three of these vanished, probably as the
result of the visits from Carrion Crows, but the other five are
doing well.
Amongst recent additions to our stock may be mentioned

It has long been one of my small ambitions to keep grouse,
and on March ist of this year there arrived for me three Swedish
Dal-ryper, or Willow-Grouse, sent from Copenhagen by Captain
George Lindesay. I had ordered a cock and two hens, intending
to try and mate one of the hens with a cock Rock-Ptarmigan.
All three birds arrived in excellent condition, but as they were in
absolutely snow-white winter plumage it was quite impossible to
distinguish a cock bird from a hen.
I at once turned the birds out into a grass run and fed them
on oats, wheat, dari and hemp seed ; and, of course, supplied fresh

water and flint grit, also providing birch branches Jwith catkins
on. These catkins the birds ate greedily from the first, and even
ate an inch or so of the ends of the birch twigs--often being
compelled to give great tngs to get the twigs broken. At the
end of three days I saw something was evidently wrong, as one
of the birds was in a state of frantic terror, rushing up and down
against the wire without any apparent reason, and not eating
freely. As the birds were all wild and shy, I could only ascertain
what was happening by careful watching from a distance. By
this means I found that one of the other birds was bullying this
one, and guessed (as proved to be the fact) that I had got two
cocks and one hen, and that the approach of the breeding season
was the cause of the disturbance. I at once put the cock that
was being bullied into another enclosure, and he soon settled
down. At the end of a few days he commenced to moult into
breeding plumage--turning speckled brown on the head at first,
then going chestnut on the chest and neck, and this chestnut
gradually shaded into dark grey-brown on the back--indeed this
bird was unusually dark and looked at one time as though he were
going to change to black on the back. The flight-feathers and
under-parts remained white. The moult of this bird was com-
pleted by the middle of April. The other cock and hen began
to moult about the 25th March, but the breeding plumage of this
cock turned out much lighter in colour than that of the first one.
The breeding plumage of the hen, when completed, was very
interesting in the way of rendering her invisible when squatting
even a few yards distant.
About the middle of March, for about a mouth, I supplied
the birds with willow catkins and twigs, as they seemed to like
these a good deal better than birch. The willows that are known
in the trade as " soft rods " are very suitable. I noticed the birds
eat grass for the first time on the 27th March, and after that they
seemed to prefer it (when obtainable) to birch and willow twigs.
About the 20th of April a friend kindly changed me my
first moulted cock for a hen. This last bird (which was a very
fine one) arrived in full winter plumage and did not complete
her moult until the beginning of June (about five weeks later
than the other two birds). I may mention that, when the new

Mr. C. Barnby Smith,
hen arrived, I placed her with the other birds, and the first
hen attacked her for a time, but as the enclosure was spacious,
and provided with retreats in the way of fir and birch branches,
nothing serious happened. The cock had developed a good deal
of loose red skin over his eyes in April. About the middle of
that month I noticed him showing off to the first hen. During
April and May he was very fierce, constantly running hastily
about and spreading his tail and crowing and cackling defiantly if
anyone came near the enclosure. When the two hens quarrelled
he often intervened and chastised them in turn.
The birds' enclosure was an uncovered triangular run,
about twenty yards each side, but I found that cats, or some
other enemies, visited it at night and terrified the birds, so I was
compelled to make in the middle of the run a small place a few
yards square, covered at top and sides with fine wire, and the
birds were driven into this every night.
This of course did away with my hopes of breeding, but I
dared not risk losing the old birds by leaving them out at night.
To my great surprise and delight I found on the 23rd of May
that the first-moulted hen had scooped out a little sandy hollow
at the foot of a broom in the outer enclosure, and. laid an egg.
Being anxious to secure this for hatching in due course under a
fowl, I took it from the nest and substituted a Plover's egg. This
was probably a rather stupid thing to do--anyhow the bird for-
sook the nest and did not lay again until the 30th May, when she
made another little hollow a few yards distant from the first and
laid again. I did not disturb the second nest, but it was also
deserted. This was perhaps not surprising, as there was a good
deal of traffic through the enclosure about this time, necessitated
by a hatch of little Mouals in another run beyond.
However, I think it quite possible that the second hen
Willow-Grouse may still nest and, I hope, with better results.
The eggs already obtained I am sending to Mr. Hugh Wormald,
knowing his skill in rearing game-birds.
My idea of a suitable place for, say, three pairs of Willow-
Grouse, is an uncovered grass enclosure about twenty-five yards
square, on a northern slope and gravel soil. It is natural to these
birds to have a good range, and, though they may survive for a

time in a very small space, yet they are not in the same spirits
and are far more likely to be attacked by disease.
The enclosure might be surrounded by wire netting about
nine or ten feet high, supported on larch poles--the netting at
the top being turned at least two feet horizontally outwards so as
to prevent climbing by cats, etc. As to the mesh, the three feet
near the ground should be three-quarters of an inch and for the
rest 2-inch mesh should suffice ; of course the netting should be
let a foot or so into the ground.
I should dig a few irregular hollows (throwing the exca-
vated earth into mounds alongside) and in and near the hollows
place some large blocks of limestone. The birds love to crouch
alongside these. As to planting, I should suggest 75 birches
about 3 ft. high, topped and planted at an angle of 45 degrees--
also groups of Pimis montana , savins and other junipers, a few
Irish and winter heaths, crowberry, white and other brooms,
roses of sharon, etc. These will soon form a pretty picture and
the birds will feel infinitely more at home than if in strange
surroundings. Moreover, shelter from the hot sun in summer is,
I think, essential--hence my preference for a northern slope.
No planting should be done within a few feet of the outside wire,
or the birds will be tempted to lie near the wire and so attract
passing enemies. I11 the breeding season the enclosure would
have to be divided, but wire netting about 4 ft. high could be
temporarily put down for this purpose.
As to feeding on birch and willow twigs in winter and
spring, I think it is quite hopeless to grow these in the enclosure
itself; the best plan is to get a stock of branches and lay them in
trenches in a sheltered part of the garden and give to the birds
when wanted. The branches will keep fresh for months. I
have found it necessary to cut the feathers of one wing as well as
pinioning the birds, as, if the situation is exposed a gale will
occasionally carry even a pinioned bird to a great height.
One or two recent attempts to introduce Willow-Grouse
into Scotland have been unsuccessful--the white winter plumage
of the birds having proved too attractive a mark for natural
enemies. However the Willow-Grouse give one such charming
visions of wild life that I would venture to strongly urge their
claims on all aviculturists who can give the necessary space.

Having completed arrangements with the Melbourne Zoo.
for obtaining by exchange a number of animals from that Insti-
tution, and having secured permission from the Victorian
Government to employ catchers, and made arrangements with
them to get birds for me, I was anxious to push on to Sydney.
A journey of some seventeen hours by rail brought me to
the metropolis of New South Wales. Comfortable sleeping-cars
are provided on these trains, but the railways, in one particular
at least, are behind those of the younger state of Western
Australia in that dining-cars are not provided. Dinner-time
having arrived, the train pulls up at a station ; there is a rush of
passengers to the dining-room on the platform, where a limited
number of waitresses are ready to serve a host of hungry travel-
lers, eacli one of whom wishes to be attended to first, in order
that he may be able to satisfy his appetite before the bell rings
and the return rush to the train commences.
As we approached the New South Wales Capital a wonder-
ful change in the aspect of the country presented itself, for the
drought from which Victoria was suffering had not been ex-
perienced here, and the country was beautifully green.
Three out of the four Zoological Gardens of Australia are
managed by one of the brothers Le Souef, and on arrival in
Sydney Mr. Sherbourne Le Souef, the Secretary of the N.S.W.
Zoological Society, very kindly met me and we proceeded to his
Zoo., which is situated in Moore Park, close to the famous cricket
ground. The gardens are small, only about fifteen acres in
area, and the stock kept is limited ; Australian animals, with the
exception of a fairly good collection of Kangaroos, being almost
absent. The larger Carnivora do very well here and breed freely,
though I understand that the stock has dwindled somewhat of
late. Three half-grown Tiger-cubs, which were not doing par-
ticularly well in their dens, were put out on collar and chain, and
the change seemed to suit them well, for they became so strong
that every now and then one would break his chain and com-

liience to rove the gardens until his keepers coaxed him back to
captivity. A female Indian Elephant, which daily added to the
revenue of the Society by carrying children, was remarkable from
the fact that she carried quite a coat of long hair ; she was quite
the most hairy Elephant I have ever seen.
Amongst the birds, the Crane family was the best repre-
sented, Japanese White-necked, Manchurian, Asiatic White,
Sarus, Demoiselle and Native Companion being all present at
the time of my visit. The collection of Waterfowl was poor, but
one exhibit worthy of record was a pair of hybrids between a
Black Swan atid domestic Goose, ugly-looking birds, clearly
betraying their parentage.
The houses in the Sydnejr Zoo. are small and in many cases
unsuited for their inhabitants, and the whole Zoo. is not worthy
of the fine city to which it belongs. The site in fact is ill-adapted
for a Zoological Garden.
During my stay in Sydney there was a talk of moving the
Zoo. to a new site on the opposite side of the harbour to that on
which Sydney itself is situated, and if this can be done there is
no reason why Sydney should not some day possess perhaps the
finest Zoological Garden in the world. There are hundreds of
acres of land here, at present thickly covered with native bush,
where the Coach-whip bird can be heard any day and the Blue
Mountain Lorikeet sucks the nectar from the flowering gums.
Ring-tailed Opossoms have their nests in the Wattle trees, and
all is as it was before the white man commenced to destroy
Nature's handiwork. This site, which has been, I understand, a
government military reserve, has been left untouched by the
speculative builder who has planted villas on almost every other
available site on the banks of this superb harbour. It is a site
for a Zoo that would be worthy of the oldest, and in many ways
the finest, city in Australia.
The wild birds in the Sydney Zoo. were very interesting to
me and afforded me some entertainment in endeavouring to add
some of them to my collection. I noticed that every evening,
just about closing time, quite a number of Pied Grallinas came
into the gardens and disported themselves upon the lawns and
round the ornamental ponds. I was very anxious to take some

Mr. D. Seth-Smith,
of these home, so tried to conceive some method of capturing
them. The best method I could think of was by means of the
ordinary bird-catchers' clap-nets, and as I found it impossible to
purchase these in Sydney I set to work to rig up a pair with some
netting I was able to buy. One day I discovered several dead
specimens of this bird, and ascertained that poisoned grain had
been laid down for the Sparrows, and the "Pee-wees" had taken
this and succumbed to its effects. However there were plenty
more left, and a couple of the dead birds, propped up with sticks,
made capital decoys.
One evening, as soon as the visitors had left the Gardens,
I set my nets with the decoys in position, and within five minutes
two birds came flying overhead and pitched right in the nets
close to the decoys. I pulled the string and secured one bird;
the other, flying straight upwards, managed to clear the nets.
This was encouraging, but I soon found that the nets Iliad made
were rather too heavy, and as these birds have a habit of jump-
ing vertically into the air when disturbed, instead of flying low,
they generally managed to clear the nets before they could be
pulled over. I secured two birds that evening, and the following
day had to leave Sydney on a trip to Brisbane, so my catching
was postponed for the time being.
Curiously enough, on my return, ten days later, the Pee-
wees had departed except for an occasional single bird or a pair.
Probably they are to a certain extent migratory, and I had
struck a number of migrants on the first occasion. I sub-
sequently captured two more, four being my total catch.
The introduced Indian Mynah is as common here as in
Melbourne, and every afternoon a small flock would appear, but
not being native birds they did not interest me particularly.
Quite the most charming birds in the Gardens were the
Blue Wrens, which were always present. On several occasions
I saw a female feeding young birds close to the Secretary's
Office, and the gorgeous little males were to be seen hopping
about on the grass, never far from a clump of bushes, at almost
any time.
White-eyes fZosterops ccerulescensj were the commonest of
the native birds met with in the Sydney Zoo., and their plaintive

note was heard in almost every bush. In the capture of these I
found no difficulty. I procured a trap-cage with four compart-
ments at the top. At first I thought I should require a call-bird
in the bottom part of the cage reserved for this purpose, but,
although the species swarmed all round Sydney, none of the
bird-dealers knew how to procure one for me, so I proceeded
without one. I placed two bananas, one on each of the two
clumps of bushes close to the Secretary's office, and in a short
time I found that the skin of these alone remained, the inside
having been eaten completely away. I then set the trap-cage in
one of the bushes, baiting each of the four compartments with a
piece of banana, and when I examined the trap about lialf-an-
liour later it contained four White-eyes. I had no difficulty
whatever in catching as many specimens of Zosterops as I wanted
and very soon had a cage full. These did very well, and I should
doubtless have brought nearly all of them home, but 011 our
return journey, during a gale in the Indian Ocean, a huge sea
smashed in the side of our bird-house on the steamer's deck,
some thirty feet above water line, and completely swamped the
cage containing these fragile birds, which resulted in the loss of
all.
Blue Wrens sometimes got into the trap-cage, but always
managed to squeeze out through the bars. But I was not
particularly anxious to catch these, as I had arranged with a
professional bird-catcher to secure all I wanted, and it would
have been a pity to rob the Sydney Zoo. of one of its, to me,
most charming occupants.
The Black and White Fantail Flycatcher was always to be
seen near the stores shed where, by the kindness of the Secretary,
I was permitted to keep most of my live stock. Flies frequented
this shed literally in millions, so the Fantails had a splendid
time, and it was delightful to watch the clever manner in which
they snapped up their prey. These house flies were much
appreciated by a cage-full of Garrulous Honey-eaters (Manorhina
oarnila&amp;apos;) which proved themselves to be extraordinarily clever at
capturing them, and I should hardly be exaggerating if I were to
say that no fly that was foolish enough to enter this cage was
quick enough to escape from it.

Mr. D. Dewar,
My collection grew by leaps and bounds, and a carpenter
who was specially employed in making travelling boxes and
cages was unable to keep pace with the number of animals which
kept on arriving. I paid daily visits to three or four animal
dealers' shops in Sydney, and secured many interesting creatures,
while every now and then a snake catcher, who was known as
" Snaky George," would arrive with some venomous Tiger Snake
or Black Snake coiled up in a sack, which he would hold open
with the utmost unconcern.

THE PARADISE FLYCATCHER.
By D. Dewar, I.C.S.
The Editor has asked me to write for the Journal of the
Avicultural Society a short account of the Paradise Flycatcher
(Terpsiphone paradisi&amp;apos;). With his request I gladly comply, for
this Flycatcher is a bird of which I am exceedingly fond. As
regards beauty of form and grace of motion it can hold its own
against all comers. A cock, in the full glory of his white
plumage, as he flits like a sprite through some shady plantation,
is a sight never to be forgotten. The movements of his long
tail-feathers, as he pursues liis course amid the green foliage, are
as graceful as those of the folds of the garments of a skilled
serpentine dancer. Imagine a very-slenderly built Whydah-bird,
provided with a metallic steely blue-black crest and arrayed in
snowy white, having the tail feathers longer and more attenuated
than the Whydali, and you have some idea of the appearance of
the Paradise Flycatcher. Set this in a frame of rich leafy green
and you have him as we see him in India. Substitute for the
white a rich chestnut and you have a cock in an earlier stage of
plumage. Knock off the long median tail feathers and you have
a hen or a young cock.
According to Oates, the cock assumes his white livery
after the autumnal moult of his third year. I have never seen a
live cock in the stage of transition, but there is in the Madras
Museum a specimen in which some of the feathers are white and
the others chestnut. Terpsiphone paradisi occurs in most parts

of India, but undergoes a certain amount of local migration. In
the summer it ascends the hills to a considerable height. I11 the
Punjab it is a hot-weather visitor, coming viirabile dichi to that
parched country to breed ; but it invariably nests in a tree grow-
ing by a river or in some well-irrigated orchard. In the hot
weather of 1906 a pair of Paradise Flycatchers built a nest in a
pear tree in my garden within eighty yards of the bungalow, so
that I had an excellent opportunity of observing their habits.
The pair in question consisted of a hen and a white cock;
but I have seen several pairs of which the cock is chestnut.

On the Paradise Flycatcher.
This, of course is very annoying for those who believe that the
differences in the plumage of the sexes of some species are due
to sexual selection. If it is the preference of the hen for white
birds that has caused the cock Paradise Flycatcher to become
white, how is it that the old-fashioned chestnut gentlemen are
able to secure wives quite early in the breeding season?
But this is not by any means the only way in which
Fapsiphone sets at nought the theories of orthodox biologists.
It seems to do everything which a bird ought not to do. The
liens mock Darwin by sometimes fighting over a cock. I myself
have seen them do this. The snowy white cock derides the
theory of Wallace by sitting on the open nest. When so occupied
Iris two long tail-feathers hang down several inches below the
bottom of the nest. Anglo-Indian schoolboys when out after the
eggs of this species keep a sharp look-out for the sitting cock,
who reveals from afar the presence of the nest. This latter is
usually attached to one of the lowest branches of a tree, no care
whatever being taken to conceal its whereabouts. It is usually
built in a fork near the extremity of a slender branch, for it, even
when it contains the brood of four, is nearly as light as the
proverbial feather. It takes the form of an inverted cone, the
downwardly directed point of which is usually prolonged into a
kind of stem. The chief materials used are fine dried grass
stems and fibres, kept together by cobweb--the most approved
cement of bird masons. Exteriorly the nursery is well plastered
over with spider's web and on to this a number of tiny white
cocoons are sometime stuck.
Both the cock and the lieu work at the nest. Both seek
materials, the cock going off in one direction to secure them and
the hen in another. Sometimes one of the pair returns with
material in the beak while the other is sitting in the nest working
fibre into it or moulding it into shape. O11 such occasions the
last to arrive squats patiently 011 the edge of the nest or beside it
until its mate has finished. The cock gets through more work
than the hen, and when the eggs are laid he does a considerable
part of the incubating in the day time.
I find from my notes that I visited the nest in question in
my compound sixteen times between the laying of the eggs and

the appearance of the first young bird, and found the hen sitting
011 ten occasions and the cock on six. I paid the nest a visit
once about 10 p.111. taking with me a bicycle lamp, and found the
hen on the nest ; she was fast asleep and did not stir, although I
turned the light on to her and stood under the nest and talked.
I could not discover the whereabouts of her lord and master.
When excited the Paradise Flycatcher utters a curious
harsh note--a chit-clutter --difficult to describe but easy to identify.
The cock sings a sweet little lay at the breeding season.
They hawk flies, after the manner of their kind, but usually
among the foliage of an orchard or wood in preference to the
open.
I have sometimes seen them pick an insect off the surface
of the water, just as Martins do in England. I once witnessed
one of these flycatchers chase a butterfly--not a usual quarry for
a professional catcher of insects.

By Frank Finn.
The rather scrappy nature of these notes will, I hope, be
forgiven by aviculturists in consideration of the possible interest
of some of them, at a time of year when copy for the Magazine
is short. I would particularly direct their attention to the notes
on the production--or otherwise--of pellets by birds, as this point
has not received very much attention from ornithologists. I follow
the nomenclature and order of the Bird volumes of the Fau?ia of
British India.
Jungle-Crow. Corvus macrorhynchus.
In adults of this bird the mouth is black inside; in the
fledged young pinky-red, while their eyes are dark-grey instead
of dark-brown.
House-Crow. Corviis splendens.
Although this is usually a bird of the plains, I have seen a
pair at Darjeeling (in April. 1898). It is a curious habit of these
birds to interrupt each other when pairing.
The quids or pellets they used to leave on the verandah I
have found contained large bits of bone and seeds of the peepul
fig, a favourite wild fruit with many Indian birds and beasts.

Mr. Frank Finn,
Striated Babbler. Argya earlii.
Two of these birds I got in December, 1897, fed freely on
cockroaches (the large tropical kind), holding their prey in one
foot. They cast no pellets. In a cage they hopped when on the
ground, but when one escaped in the garden I saw it run. Other
specimens I kept refused small millepedes of a light-brown
colour, and smelling strongly of essence of almond, which are
common in Calcutta during the rains, going in troops in the open.
Jungle Babbler. Crateropus canorus.
Two fledged young ones I procured on June 30th, 1898, had
the eyes brown, instead of white as in the adult. This bird casts
no pellets, even after eating cockroaches and tipaii berries. I
once saw one, in 1902, hop some yards after a white butterfly and
spring up at it. Although always on the watch for such occur-
rences, I rarely saw a bird attack a butterfly, on the average once
a year, I should think.
One of these birds presented by our member, Mr. E. W.
Harper, to the London Zoo was " isabelline" or greyish cream-
colour ; eyes, bill, and feet normal. A white one Rutledge had
(also normal in above-mentioned parts) changed partly to the
normal colour, and when still in a speckled state escaped, and,
he told me, went off with a wild flock.
I once caught by hand a wretched, though adult, specimen
of this bird in a verandah at Dehra D0011 on a wet day. These
birds both bathe and dust.
By the way, the name Jungle Babbler, which Oates gives
this bird is not at all appropriate ; it is the common garden
species wherever it occurs.
Yellow-eyed Babbler. Pyctorhis sinensis.
My friend Mr. B. B. Osmaston once wrote to me about
some he kept: "They are wonderful little acrobats--like the
Tits. It is very comic to see Pyctorhis hanging on with both feet
to the tail of Argyct caudata [Common Babbler or Rat-bird]
which frequently happens in the cage. I had a pair of Temenuchus
in my cage too, but they were so bullied by Pyctorhis that I had
to take them out! " He also told me that they used their feet in
feeding, which I later saw frequently myself, when I was able to
get live specimens of this most amusing little bird.

Black-headed Sibia. Lioptila capistrata.
This bird holds its prey in or under its foot like Liothrix.
Blue-winged Siva. Siva cyanuroptera.
In captivity I found this bird fed on fruit as well as insects,
and held its food in its foot like Liothrix ; I have seen it put its
foot on food when wild--in Darjeeling. It is also sociable like
Liothrix.
Black-Chinned Yuhina. Yichina nigrimentnm.
I once had two of these little birds ; they were very
sociable together; and fond of caressing each other, but bullied
other species. They sipped up sweetened sop readily with their
long tongues, and were very much given to bathing.
Swinhoe's White-Eye. Zosterops simplex.
I have seen one of these birds use its foot in feeding on
about two occasions, but the action is rare. They are very
sociable, even with different species, in captivity.
Red-billed Liothrix [Pekin Robin]. Liothrix Intea.
I found this species also refused the millepedes mentioned
as refused by the Striated Babblers.
Common Iora. Aegithina tiphia.
A tame bird I kept recalled in its actions both Chloropsis
and Liothrix; it had much greater swallowing power than the
former, and grasped food in one foot like the latter or a Shrike.
It was shy at first, but soon got tame, like Liothrix. I was told
adults could not be kept, and mine was a hand-reared one, the
only specimen I had then seen caged (in November, 1897) though
I afterwards saw a few others. It cast no pellets. I have
seen it dart out suddenly when the aviary door was opened, as
Liothrix will do. I did not see it show any sociability, and it
seemed able to take care of itself with other birds.
Silver-eared Mesia. Mesia argeiitauris.
I bought the first specimen of this I ever saw alive. It
feeds in confinement on fruit, insects and seed, and holds food in
one foot like Liothiix. It was sociable.
Bengal Red-vented Bulbul. Molpastes be?igalensis.
This bird casts no pellets, either when old birds are fed on
tipari berries, or young on flies, which they prefer to fruit. I
have seen a pair in the London Zoo., one of this species, and the

Mr. Frank Finn,
other another red-vented form, expand their red under-tail-coverts
when excited, apparently courting.
White-eared Bulbue. Molpastes leucotis.
I have found this species very tame ; one which had only
been recently purchased escaped and came back to its cage ; it
prefers sleeping in a box.
Bengae Red-whiskered Buebul. Otocompsa enmia.
I once saw a wild pair quarrelling with one of the previous
species in the Indian Museum garden, and all expanded their
red under-tail-coverts. I think it was this pair which bred in
the Indian Museum grounds, the only pair I noted as breeding
there ; they fed their young on small dragon-flies.
Southern Red-whiskered Buebue. Otocompsa puscicaudata.
I have known one of these birds live in Bombay for five
years, caged with finches, and having access to nothing but fruit
and seed ; yet it was in good condition when shown me.
Beack-CRESTED Yeeeow Buebul. Otocompsa ftaviventris.
A specimen lived for about six years in the Calcutta Zoo. ;
it was very tame and would feed from the hand ; the species was
rarely on sale in Calcutta.
White-beelied Drongo. Dicrurus coeruiescens.
The late Mr. W. Rutledge, our well-known Calcutta dealer,
told me he had heard a caged specimen whistle a native tune.
Racket-tailed Drongo. Dissemurus paradiseus.
This bird will eat, in captivity at any rate, small vertebrates
as well as insects, and also vegetable food. I found it liked the
leaves of Boitgainvillea. It casts pellets.
Tailor-Bird. Orthotomus sutorms.
The young of this bird are not brighter than the parents,
as in so many Warblers, but duller, and have the chestnut cap
scarcely evident. I kept a young one (which I picked up in the
Indian Museum compound) for about a week, and often gave it
large flies and small dragon-flies, which it took easily ; it got
tame and apparently affectionate. It did not cast pellets; neither
does our Blackcap.
Ashy Swallow-Shrike or Wood-Swallow. Artamus fuscus.
I noticed that a bird of this species I fed on cockroaches
cast no pellets.

Maroon OriolK. Oriolus traillii.
Oates gives the iris of this bird as pale buffy yellow ; this
is right for adults; but one I saw in immature dress in captivity
had dark eyes. The species is much steadier in a cage than the
Yellow Orioles, and sits more erect, with the feathers of the
crown raised, not lying flat as in the others.
Glossy Calornis. Calornis chalybeius.
This species hops when on the ground, like the Hill
Mynahs. I have seen two types; those I saw in India had dark
red eyes like a Collared Dove's ; but some I have since seen
imported here had scarlet irides.
Rosy Pastor. Pastor rosezis.
Captive birds of this species in India become much sullied
with black and very dull in the rosy tinge. One I had turned
nearly all black while on deposit with others at the Calcutta Zoo ;
yet all were fed alike on satoo (coarse pea-meal). The black one
was a particularly fine and healthy specimen ; I noticed 011 ex-
amining it that the abnormal blackness was on the edges of the
feathers on the upper surface, which looked uniform black, and on
their bases on the lower surface, which was less completely black.
Gold-crest Mynah. Ampeliceps coronatus.
This bird is, in my opinion, quite wrongly placed by Oates
among the typical Starlings or Mynahs. It should go among the
Hill-Mynah section, which it resembles ill its hopping gait on
the ground, in its heavy build, and in its style of plumage ; but I
think there is no sufficient reason for making a family distinction
between these two groups. There is a specimen of this bird at
the London Zoo at the time of writing, and the dealers have had
a few of late 3/ears, but I never saw it caged in India but once.
Bank Mynah. Acridotheres ginginianus.
Oates says of this bird "The young have the head and
wings fulvous brown" ; but I have found that many have black
heads, and generally resemble the adults, except for being duller.
The species evidently shows a tendency, which I have observed
in some other Indian birds, to "skip" the young plumage. Oates
also gives the iris as deep maroon red, but I have seen one with
a yellow eye. I have also found the bill orange, not gamboge as
he gives it.

It has been my privilege, as the guest of Mr. M. J. Nicoll,
the Assistant Director, to spend three months of last winter
in the Giza Zoological Gardens, and to a zoologist primarily
devoted to living animals, it formed a treat not easily forgotten.
The Zoological Gardens were formerly the gardens attached
to the Palace and Harem of Ismail Pasha, who laid them out
regardless of expense. Large ponds crossed by rustic bridges,
fantastic grottoes, and an abundance of trees and other vegetation
combine to make an ideal retreat in the midst of a flat and bare
country. By the enterprise of the Egyptian Government and
the energy of Capt. S. S. Flower, the Director, these gardens
now contain a very representative collection of African fauna,
one of their main features being the extremely good collection of
Antelopes, which in the dry and warm climate of Egypt do ex-
tremely well and breed freely. However, we are here concerned
with the birds, so passing over very many interesting and rare
animals and reptiles we come to our subject. The ' rara avis' of
the collection is of course the Whale-headed Stork (Balceniceps
rex), of which this garden contains the only examples in cap-
tivity, except for one in the Palace Gardens at Khartoum. They
share a large paddock with the Cranes, in which they stalk about
solemnly and with very slow and deliberate strides. It can hardly
be said that they are extremely attractive, as their movements are
so slow and ungainly, still, to the Ornithologist, they are very
interesting as showing what this peculiar form of bird is like in
life.
The next in order of rarity is probably a very fine example
of the Secretary Bird from the Sudan. Those usually seen in
Zoological Gardens come from South Africa, where the species is
by no means common and strictly preserved, and in the Sudan,
though well protected, it is decidedly scarcer.
The collection of Vultures is very good ; five species*--
the Sociable, Riippells, Cinereous, Griffon and Egyptian--all living
* O to gyps auricularis. Gyps riippelli, Vultur monachus, Gyps ftilvus, Neophron

amicably together in a very fine flight, and when I left in April
several of them were showing signs of nesting. Ostriches, being
almost in their native habitat, do very well, and there were
examples of two distinct races; a pair from the Sudan were
laying and it was hoped that they might be induced to sit and
hatch.
On the large pond, which is crowded during the winter
with several kinds of wild duck, were some Pelicans (. Pelecamis
o 7 iociotahis and P. rufescens) in splendid feather and condition--
the former especially showing that delicate pink hue so seldom
seen in captive birds. These bred and reared young last year
(1908) but had not yet commenced nesting this year. They have
a peculiar way of driving the fish, in which the pond abounds.
They all swim up together in a line, generally ending up in one
of the narrow bays, when they quickly scoop up what fish they
can and then proceed to drive another part. The collection
contains a fair number of Doves, though the number of species
is not very great and those mostly of the commoner kinds. The
Herons and Ibises are fairly well represented and there is an
especially nice aviary of Buff-backed Herons ( Ardea bubulcus )
which used to breed freely, but have now become rather too
crowded to do so.
There are single examples of the Sacred Ibis, Black-necked
Ibis, Australian Ibis, Purple and Night Herons, Tittle Bittern
and several common Herons.
The Game-Birds are represented by several Pheasants of
the species most commonly kept ( e.g . Golden, Silver and Amherst)
and two very fine hens of the Javanese Peafowl, as well as a very
fine lot of Hey's Rock Partridges (. Ammoperdix heyi). A good des-
cription and plate, of this species was given in the Magazine by
Mr. Trevor Battye a few years back. * Mr. Battye correctly
identified his birds as A. heyi, but the following month, at the
instance of Mr. Ogilvie Grant, he stated that they belonged to
the Southern form ( A. cholmleyi). This latter form may be
recognised from the true A. heyi, which comes from Southern
Palestine, by its much darker colour and by the absence of the
white forehead.
Avic. Mag., Ser. II., Vol. III., pp. 263 &amp; 346. (1905).

Mr. J. Lewis Bonhote,
Examples from Egypt resemble the Southern form in
lacking the white forehead, but in all other respects they are
indistinguishable from typical Palestine birds, and as I have
seen a skin from Palestine, in which the white forehead was
absent, there is little doubt that the Egyptian form should be
known as A. heyi , and that Mr. Battye's article is perfectly
correct.
Other orders of birds are not so well represented ; among
the seedeaters there are some nice Buntings ( e.g . Black-headed
Ortolan, Cretclimar's, etc.), the Persian Desert Bullfinch (Rhodos-
piza obsoleta), the Yellow Sparrow ( Passer luteiis&amp;apos;) in which species
Mr. Nicoll points out that the hens seem to be dimorphic, and
many common birds such as Cutthroats, Zebra-finches, Bengalees,
Java Sparrows, Serins, etc., etc.
The Corvidae are represented by two species only, viz., the
Brown-necked Raven ( Corvus umbrinus ) and the Pied Crow
(C. scapulatus ) and the other families of the Passeres, including
all the insectivorous birds, are entirely unrepresented, an omis-
sion which will probably shortly be remedied. Owls and true
Hawks are also conspicuously absent, being each represented by
a single example (1) of the Little Owl ( A. gla, 7 tx) (2) of a lovely
Peregrine which has been in the gardens for about seven years;
there are however a few nice Eagles and Buzzards, which were in
very fine condition. Owing to foxes and wild cats hardly any
ducks are kept, but as this deficiency is abundantly made up by
Nature during the winter, there is no necessity to keep them. The
large Order of Limicolse is represented by only three species, the
Stone Curlew, Common Plover, and Black-tailed Godwit, and the
Laridse by a single pair of Lesser Black-backed Gulls and one
Black-headed Gull. As time goes on, however, the collection
will doubtless be improved in these respects, as several schemes
for some fine new aviaries are only waiting till sufficient funds
are available, to enable them to be carried out.
As regards the aviaries themselves there is not much that
need be said. In a delightful climate with a practical absence of
rain and no need for artificial warmth, aviaries may be of the
simplest form, and an open wire flight boarded at the back and
along half the sides and partially roofed, proves ample protection

for most species; but if the more delicate insectivorous birds
were kept they would require further protection during the
winter nights.
To the ornithologist, however, the wild birds of the gardens
will far transcend both in interest and numbers those kept in
aviaries--what an ideal and unique boast for any Zoological
Gardens--but such is the case, nor is the reason far to seek ; in a
practically treeless (except for date palms) and waterless country
where every blade of vegetation has to be cultivated by con-
tinuous irrigation, a garden abounding in trees, bushes, and
water, forms a veritable oasis to which birds will flock, and
finding a sanctuary there, will remain.
The two most numerous species are the Egyptian Kite and
Hooded Crow, which are resident throughout the year, and are
so numerous as to prevent the rearing of any young ducks or
other birds unless carefully enclosed ; yet the incomparable flight
of the Kites and the boldness and impudence of the Crows more
than counterbalance, to my mind, any mischief they may do.
During the winter. Thrushes, Robins and Chiffcliaffs are
the commonest of the small birds, and as spring comes on and
the migrant stream slowly flows northwards, Eesser Whitethroats
appear, to be shortly followed by Redstarts and Nightingales, so
that by the beginning of April the whole gardens are resounding
with the songs of numerous Warblers ; and as the migration
reaches its height, Shrikes, Bee-Eaters, Orioles and Flycatchers
stop for a brief visit and then pass on. A list of all the species
that have been known to occur has just been published by the
Director and his assistant, so that it would be waste of time to
recapitulate them.*
Passing on therefore from the Passeres, one of the sights is
the large pond, for here in winter the ducks are so thick as to
almost obscure the water. Teal are by far the commonest, next
to them come Shovellers, and finally Pintail. Mallard are very
rarely seen, and occasionally a Garganey, White-eyed or Tufted
Duck may come, but they rarely stay more than a few days.
These ducks are absolutely tame and afford splendid opportu-

Mr. J. Lewis Bonhote,
nities for studying their various plumages, habits, etc. At dusk
they rise in small parties and all leave the gardens to feed in the
surrounding country.
On one side of this pond is a large thick bush, which,
grows out over the water and forms an island ; this is the winter
retreat of hundreds of Night Herons, which, like the ducks, pass
the day peacefully roosting, unmindful of the continuous stream
of visitors, and then at dusk fly off with much squawking into
the open country.
Among the many pleasant memories of last winter, few
are more cherished than those of the short twilight, which
succeeds the glorious sunsets of that country.
The air is cool and refreshing after the heat of the day, the
visitors have gone, and the gardens are given up to Nature ;
Kites and Crows congregate to roost, the former entering a thick
fir plantation without a sound, while the latter congregate in
large numbers on some leafless tree and chatter for a few
moments before taking refuge among thicker foliage. Kestrels
coming in from the fields fly round a few times uttering their
sharp 'kelc-kek' and then quietly drop to where some big bough
leaves the trunk, and there, silent and invisible, pass the night.
The twilight deepens ; Thrushes and Blackbirds scuttle about the
bushes, calling out in their familiar way, a few small bats appear,
hawking over the water with uncertain flight, the flute-like
'Chi-ou' of the Little Owl is heard, and as he sees us he bobs
up and down in his peculiar manner and then darts off to another
perch.
The loud and shrill whistle of the Norfolk Plover rings
out as they fly swiftly over the Gardens, a few ducks are seen on
the wing, and then comes the squawk of the Night Herons as
they fly out into the open country. A common Heron will
probably be seen flying round, and then, with outstretched wings,
slowly drop down to seek its food by the edge of some water-
course.
It is now nearly dark, two noiseless shadows over our
head shows the track of the Barn Owl, and the well-known ' ring'
of ducks' wings tell us more clearly than our eyes that the
'flight' is in full swing. It is soon dark ; the busy period when

the night birds wake and the day birds settle to sleep is over,
quiet among the wild birds reigns once more, and another
pleasant memory of nature is stored up in one's mind.
One is accustomed to think of the ancient Egyptians in
the light of almost prehistoric creatures, and to marvel at the
greatness of their civilisation, considering its antiquity; but,
great as that may be, it helps us, I think, to realize how com-
paratively modern a product man is ; for here mummified by
them or portrayed in their paintings are the identical species that
we find living or migrating through the country to this day, and
having apparently hardly changed at all during the 6,000 or 7,000
3^ears that divide us from the Pharaohs.
Quail regularly pass through Egypt and are caught in
thousands as in the days of the children of Israel, and the Conies
(. Hyrax ) still inhabit the rocky hillsides. Nature still goes on,
ever conservative yet nevertheless slowly evolving towards per-
fection ; and probably in another 6,000 years, when a future race
will visit the Nile and will point to the great dam at Assouan as
a mark of the great civilisation at that period of the world's
history when the British Empire was at its zenith--that race will
still find the Eagle Owl and Lanner Falcon nesting on the
Pyramids; Bee-eaters and Nightingales will still break their
journey--as now--near Giza, and yet man marvels at the antiquity
of his own works which are as nothing compared with the
antiquity of Nature's evolving species.
However, I have digressed, but the idea is perhaps worth a
passing thought, and I would suggest that a series of living
examples of the species mummified in former ages, would add a
further attraction to these already delightful Gardens, which no
visitor to Egypt should miss.

NOTABLE IMPORTATIONS.
YKr.r.ow Toucan, Andigena bailloni. Specimens of this bird have
lately been received by Mr. Hanilyn ; it is easily known from any other
Toucan by its colour, which is dark yellow on the face, throat and under-
parts generally, and yellowish olive above. In size it about equals a Jay;
its habitat is .South-East Brazil ; two have been acquired by the Zoological
Garde ns.
In the consignment was a hen of the Spotted-billed Toucan ( Selenidera
maciili)ostris), previously only known to aviculture by two cocks in the
London Zoological Gardens, one of which still survives. The Toucans of
this group differ from most of the family in showing a sex-difference; thus, in
the present bird the cock's head and breast are black and the hen's brown.
Verdixer Flycatcher, Stoparola melanops. A pair of this Indian
bird have lately been sold by Messrs. Willson to one of our members; they
are the first I have seen for sale in England myself, though a few were,
in my time, brought regularly to Calcutta every winter, and others have, I
believe, reached this country before. In size this bird about equals our
common Flycatcher; the cock is silvery-blue, with a black patch on the
face; the hen dull greenish-blue, with no noticeable face-markings.
Japanese Waxwing, Ampelis japonicus. In Cage Birds of June
19th, p. 587. Mr. William R. Hardie records having imported a specimen
of this bird; he does not say when he had it, but gives a good description.
I know of no other importation. This species is smaller than our Wax-
wing, and has no red wax-tips on the wing, though there is a red band
there, and the tip of the tail is also red. It inhabits the mainland of Eastern
Asia, as well as Japan; Mr. Hardie's specimen was brought from Nagasaki.

The following leaflet has been sent out with the June issue of British
Birds :--
" A short while ago a Stork was shot in Rhodesia bearing upon its leg
a metal ring, which proved that the bird had been marked in Prussia, when
it was a nestling, by the Rossitteu Bird Observatory, while more recently a
Stork similarly 'ringed' in Hungary was shot in the Kalaliary Desert.
Mr. H. F. Witherby, the Editor of British Birds , is inaugurating in
connection with his Magazine a scheme for marking birds in a similar way
in this country. It is hoped by this means to gain a more exact idea of the
movements of individual birds than has ever been possible by any other
method, and this should not only throw light upon the more general aspects

of migration, but it should tell us a great deal that is at present obscure
with regard to particular points. For example, while we may know the
general distribution of a species in winter and summer, we do not know the
extent of the migration of individual birds ; or, indeed, whether in such
cases as the Song-Thrush and Robin, certain individuals migrate at all.
The movements of sea-birds are very little understood, and much might be
learned from marking a large number. This plan might also tell us what
influence age has upon plumage, etc.; where a young bird, whose birthplace
is known, breeds; whether individuals return to previous nesting haunts,
and whether pairs come together again in successive breeding seasons.
A number of the readers of B/itish Birds are taking the matter up,
and it is expected that a large number of birds of all kinds will be ringed
this summer. The rings are extremely light and do not in any way interfere
with the bird's power of flight; each is stamped ' Witherbv, High Holborn,
London,' and bears a distinctive number, which in the smaller sizes is
stamped inside the ring, and it is hoped that anyone into whose hands
should fall a bird so marked will send the bird and the ring, or, if this is
not possible, then the particulars of the number on the ring, the species of
bird, and the locality and date of capture to the address given.
For further details see the June, 1909, issue of British Birds.&amp;quot;
[In connection with this I need hardly impress upon members the
importance of not killing marked birds; it is far more important to catch
them alive, note their species and ring number for report, and let them go
again for future report. A spring net-trap baited with a mealworm will be
found most effective in catching.--E) d.
THE BLACK-CRESTED YELLOW BULBUL.
Sir, --May I be allowed to correct a slight error in the interesting
notes, by Mr. Reginald Phillipps, under the above heading, in the June
number of our Magazine ?
O11 page 240 Mr. Phillipps writes: "The Black-crested Yellow Bulbul,
Otocompsa flaviventris, .was brought to this country in 1906, two
examples being deposited at the Zoological Gardens in April of that year.
. . . . Although so comparatively common, the two birds mentioned above
seem to be the only two that have so far reached this country alive."
On March 8th, 1901, I had the honour of presenting to the Zoological
Society a specimen of this species ; and in the Report of the Council of the
Zoological Society for that year it is included in the list of birds new to the
collection.
The error is quite excusable, when one remembers that the last
published List of the Animals at the Zoo. is dated 1896.
I may add that I never observed the Black-crested Yellow Bulbul on

Sir,-- Having myself been a breeder of various kinds of Parrakeets
for twenty-five years, and Being anxious to breed the Stanleys, I will leave
members to judge whether I would have taken two similar Stanleys for a
pair, if Mr. Payne had told me (as he says he did) that there was as much
difference in the sexes of the Stanleys as in the Many Colours. This state-
ment Mr. Payne made to me by post card when refusing to exchange one of
them after Mr. Seth-Smith had seen them and identified them as two cocks,
although promising to do so at time of purchase. I admit I did not apply
to them to exchange one of them for twelve months after purchase, but it
was as soon as I found I had two cocks instead of a pair.

THE WELLINGTON ZOO.
Members will be interested to hear that a Zoological Gardens has been
established at Wellington, New Zealand--the first in that Colony--and that
Mr. A. E. L. Bertling, formerly Head Keeper at our Zoological Gardens, is
managing it. Mr. Bertling, whose success with the birds at Regent's Park
attracted a good deal of attention, went out to New Zealand with the
Chamois presented to the Colony by the Emperor of Austria, and landed
them successfully. After this he was for a time Game Ranger to the New
Zealand Government, until appointed to his present office.-- Ed.
CORRECTION.
The young Bartlett's Bleeding-heart Pigeon represented in figure 6 in
the June number should have had its age stated as thirty days old, not
sixteen days.
Its age when drawn for the coloured plate was about six or eight
weeks.

THE VERDITER FLYCATCHER.
Stoparola melanops.
By E. W. Harper.
I11 the spring of 1894, after broiling for three summers on
the plains of India, I ascended the Himalayas to Naini Tal
(. Nainee , a godess ; tal, a lake)--a beautiful settlement 7,000 ft.
above sea level--and there I first saw a Verditer Flycatcher. One
day, soon after my arrival, whilst riding a sturdy hill-pony up a
zig-gag path near the summitof a hill ata considerable heightabove
the lake, I saw a small light-blue bird, about the size of an English
Flycatcher, dart from the moss-grown trunk of a tree growing
near the path. The bird was a Verditer Flycatcher. After dis-
mounting and securing the pony, I climbed the tree and found a
cup-shaped nest, composed of moss and roots, stuck in a hollow
of the trunk, about 9 ft. from the ground. The nest was empty ;
and was promptly deserted by the birds after my visit.
A few weeks later, I frequently saw a pair of Verditers near
the lake, and concluded that they must have a nest close by.
After watching repeatedly, I saw one of the birds come out of
a large drain or water-way about six feet high--constructed of
masonry, and used for draining the race-course in the rainy
season. It was an easy matter to walk inside the then dry drain,
and to discover the mossy nest built on a ledge about five feet
from the ground. The nest contained four pinky-white eggs,
speckled with red. As in the case of the first Verditer's nest I
found, this was also deserted after my interference.
Some weeks afterwards, I was walking round the edge of
the lake ; and, when near a place called " Smuggler's Rock," saw
a Verditer carrying food in its mouth. After concealing myself

On the Verditer Flycatcher.
I watched it enter a small cave formed by immense boulders of
rock. Although a diligent search was made, the situation of the
nest remained a secret. A subsequent visit, however, was
rewarded by the discovery of the nest--again of moss--in a
corner between two large rocks. The nest contained three or
four young birds, almost ready to fly. They were greenish grey,
spotted on the under surface witli fulvous.
I removed the nest from its resting-place and carried it
and its contents to my residence about a quarter of a mile away,
the parents following. Having placed the young birds in a cage
which was hung outside, I was gratified to see their parents
industriously feeding them through the wires. In order to
minimise the danger of molestation by enemies--feathered and
human--I carried the cage inside the house. But this did not in
the slightest affect the feeding of the young by their parents ;
and passers-by were astonished to see two beautiful blue birds
flying fearlessly in and out through the open window.
And now fora sad sequel to the story of my first Verditers.
Some naturalists assert that red and black are "warning"
colours, observed in poisonous and otherwise objectionable
insects. I noticed that the young Verditers were fed cjitirely
upon an insect about three-quarters of an inch long, stiiped with
black and flaming red. Always more food was brought than the
young birds ate ; and each evening I found about a dozen of
these red-aud-black insects on the bottom of the cage. After a
few days all the young Verditers died ! I do not go so far as to
say that they were deliberately poisoned by their parents--who
might, perhaps, have preferred death to imprisonment for their
offspring--but merely state the facts as they occurred. Perhaps
this hint at avian infanticide can be endorsed by some of our
members.
I understand that this paper is to accompany a coloured
plate in our Magazine ; so that a detailed description of the
species would be superfluous. It will suffice to say that the male
is of beautiful verditer blue, with a black eye-streak extending
to the beak. The female is of a duller colour than her mate, and
lacks the black eye-streak. Not having a specimen of the bird
by me, I make the following quotation from Oates' Fauna of

The Verditer breeds during the summer in the Himalayas
up to 8,000 feet or more, and descends to the plains in winter.
Although so strikingly and beautifully clad, it is far from being
conspicuous amongst the green foliage of its native haunts. I
have never observed it wild except in the vicinity of trees.
I11 confinement, the Verditer is a delightful pet. It has a
soft sweet song, something like that of our Hedge Accentor. I
have kept three pairs in the same enclosure along with smaller
birds, but never found it quarrelsome or aggressive. It thrives
on any good insectivorous mixture, supplemented by live food ;
indeed, it might be almost called hardy.
The usual Flycatcher characteristics are well developed in
the Verditer, viz., weak feet, rendering walking more or less an
effort; horizontal hairs extending from the forehead beyond the
nostrils ; non-gregarious habits, the birds being found singly or
in pairs.
As our worthy Editor--at whose request this paper is
written--remarked to me several years ago in India, the Niltava
and the Verditer might appropriately be called the "Oxford"
and "Cambridge" Flycatcher respectively.
THE PIED ROCK-THRUSH.
Monticola saxatilis.
(Cat. Birds Brit. Mus. V., p. 313.)
By Reginald Phillipps.
The presence of two fledgeling Pied Rock-Thrushes in my
aviary this summer, strong on the wing and fully weaned, even
from mealworms, must be my excuse for "rushing" into print
once more. Young of this species have been obtained from time
to time by some of onr members, but I am not aware that pre-
viously any have been reared,--I mean reared according to the
standard of the Avicultural Society (see p. 20), a standard which
it is greatly to be hoped will be fully maintained and upheld, and
not allowed to lapse into a farce and a comedy--but that is by
the way.

Mr. R. Philupps.
This is an interesting species, but is not so well known as
it might and as it deserves to be. It is true that a few of our
members know it well, and refer to the bird as if they supposed
that all are equally intimate with it. It seems to me, however,
that this is far from being the case ; and I have a suspicion that
if three unnamed coloured plates, respectively, of a good male in
nuptial plumage, of the same bird after the July-August moult,
and of his trim little mate, were published in our Magazine,
barely one of our readers in a score would be able to say either
what species was represented, or if any and what relationship
existed between the three figures. Ret me, therefore, say a few
words about the Pied Rock-Thrush, a not uncommon bird, and
one which has been an inmate of my aviary pretty frequently
since I first invested in some specimens now over sixteen years
ago.
A detailed if not too accurate description of this little
Thrush, which with its congeners connects the Ousels with the
Chats, may be found in almost any work on British Birds,
although only nominally a British species ; so I need but say
that the adult male, in breeding plumage, has the entire head
and neck " cobalt blue," or "greyish blue"; a large irregularly
shaped patch of what I will venture to call brilliant white occu-
pies much of the back region, very conspicuous when the bird
flies or displays ; the tail is chestnut with the two centre feathers
brown ; and " the whole of the underparts below the neck chest-
nut." Bill black. Indeed, a fine healthy male in spring and
early summer is a handsome fellow; and his sprightly gait, his
lively movements, his upright watchful carriage, his chestnut
" wag" and cheerful warbling notes cannot fail to attract admir-
ing attention. But he must be supplied with a mate, and plenty
of space in an outdoor aviary, if he is to be seen to the best
advantage.
Rate in June or early in July the adult male falls into
moult, and for a time becomes an ordinary speckled Thrush
more or less like the female. Individuals differ ; at this period, it
may be really difficult to sex one bird while the sex of another
may be determined without hesitation. Some males seem to lose
the white back-patch entirely, while on others it is always more
or less visible ; and they may have as much white on the throat

as a female ; and, on the other hand, a female may display as
much chestnut as a male. The Museum Catalogue at page 315
tells 11s--" After the autumn moult the male has the feathers of
the upper parts with chestnut tips and dark-brown subterminal
bars, which almost conceal the white on the back" ; and--" the
female also has conspicuous pale tips to the feathers of the
back."
In November, 1898, Mr. St. Ouintin wrote to me--''The
breeding colours are assumed by a change of the feathers of the
body, which goes on through the winter--the flight feathers of
the wings and those of the tail being retained." I think it is the
bird of the year only that shows so much colour duringt he
autumn and early winter, and that the fully adult male does not
begin to moult into colour until the beginning of January, or
sometimes later. I make the statement with hesitation, as I have
neglected to watch this point. With me, the adult male has
usually been coming into colour during January and February,
often not finishing the process until March.
Referring to the interesting point as to the mode in which
the breeding colours are obtained, it is stated in the Museum
Catalogue (V., 2), as regards the Turdin^ generally as distin-
guished from the Syrviin^R--" Instead of two moults in the year,
there is only one, in autumn, the spring plumage being obtained
by abrasion, or by casting the points of the feathers." This
statement is not contravened or added to, nor in any way adapted
to the particular species under consideration at pages 314-5, where
the several plumages of the Pied Rock-Thrusli are described.
The more closely I watch these birds, the more I apprehend how
much abrasion has to do with the matter. Probably I do not
exaggerate when I say that from autumn until the succeeding
mid-summer, irrespective of the winter moult, owing to abrasion
or point-casting or both combined, the plumage of the male is
ceaselessly changing. To instance only a few phases:--From
about mid-August to mid-February or March, the white back-
patch is continuously increasing in size and purity of colour,
whereas all the numerous edgings and glints of white in other
parts, which at times add almost a silvery gleam to the plumage,
disappear before the winter moult sets in. And the beautiful

Mr. R. Phillipps,
"rippling" effect on the early nuptial cap and coat, given by
light tips on both the new blue and the new chestnut feathers,
disappear by June, leaving the colours deep, dead, and lustreless.
And a curious indefinable "glamour" or haze of white ("o/down)
which overhangs or clings to the plumage of my eldest fledgeling
when on a high perch in a good light , causing its mother to look
black by comparison, must I think be caused by very light tips
to the feathers (see below) ; probably it is this 1 something ' that
causes them both (the other is more secretive and keeps much in
the shade) to look so dingy, and that it will not last, for the
Catalogue tells us that the " Young in first plumage resemble
birds of the year, wdtli the spots somewhat exaggerated," which at
present does not fit my youngsters, so presumably abrasion here
also steps in and plays its part.
Nevertheless all this does not alter the simple fact that " The
breeding colours are assumed by a change of the feathers of the body,&amp;apos;'
as was first stated by Mr. St. Quintin, and as I have myself
observed on many succeeding winters.
The female is a neat, trim, brownish bird, mottled below,
some chestnut about the flanks and tail-coverts, the tail, with its
characteristic wagging up and down, chestnut, of a slightly lighter
shade than the male's, with the two centre feathers brown, and
the bill brown. As Mr. St. Quintin has also observed, the female
likewise has a winter-spring moult of the small feathers or of
most of them. With me, the moult of the female has commenced
later than that of the male, sometimes not even till March ; the
moult of the breast feathers can always be observed and followed.
Both male and female have a full moult in the autumn.
The fledgeling, on leaving the nest, as it squatted on its
latter end in a shady corner and looked up at one like a gaping,
wide-mouth, anything but a waddling, frog, appeared to be a
very dingy little fellow, and was scarcely distinguishable from
its surroundings. The underparts were and are obscurely
mottled, the flight feathers broadly but dimly edged with sandy
buff, and some rufous appeared round and about the tiny tail,
which was wagged correctly and with discrimination on its first
hopping without any preliminary Council schooling. In a day
or so it sat on dry clods of earth, which it closely resembled,

and very shortly on low thick perches in lieu of rocks. But a few
days afterwards, sitting side by side with its mother on one of
the highest perches in the aviary, all the fore parts above and
below were seen to bear an aspect of light gray, the mother
looking quite dark and, later, black by comparison ; and this gray
cloud which enveloped the fledgeling was only accentuated if
examined through a binocular. When it first left the nest at
seventeen days of age, it carried but a few specks of down, and
these on the crown only. This obscurity of plumage did not
extend to the tail-coverts, which very soon shewed up bright
and clear, chestnut and rufous; and the tail itself quickly shot
out, so that at a distance the nestling might have been taken for
its mother ; but a glance through the binocular shewed that the
tail was more shady ; and the bill, of a yellow-brown colour,
retained its nestling characteristics for what seemed to be an
unusual time. Just at first, the crown and nape of the first nest-
ling were considerably darker than the rest of the body plumage,
whereas in the second no difference was apparent; but the differ-
ence in plumage between the two birds at a later date, although
still there, was scarcely noticeable. The crown region in a dead
nestling was deep bluish ; probably this becomes obscured as the
feathers develop. I observe that I have a note respecting a ten-
day-old nestling which died here years ago that round the inside
of the open mouth, at the front, there was a circle of yellow,
doubtless for the assistance of the parents when feeding in a dark
place. Unfortunately I omitted to examine the mouths of the
two nestlings which died this year. The fledgelings were very
strong on their legs from the moment they left the nest, bounding
along like kangaroos, when alarmed helping their onward flight
with outstretched wings.* They were very quiet, both before and
after they had left the nest ; and. when they opened their mouths
at the approach of a parent, their little cry of ske-e-e-e could not
be heard at any distance, and would not attract the attention of a
non-aviculturist. This cry developed later into a simple skwee.
We are told that--" Birds of the year much resemble the
* The adult bird does not hop. It often flies to the ground after an insect, &amp;c., but
does not stay there, and uses its wings when moving from place to place. If, say, it has to
scurry after an escaping insect, it will make short darts and runs, but I have never seen
it hop.--R. P.

Mr. R. Philupps,
female; but the ground-colour of the upper parts of the young
male is much bluer, and of the underparts much more chestnut."
From its habit of wagging its tail up and down, I notice
in an old book that this species is called the Rock Wagtail. This
is a misleading title, as one associates a " Wagtail " with a bird
that has a long tail which is always on the go. The tail of our
bird is rather short than long ; and the wag is occasional, and so
far dog-like as to seem to be a wag of intelligence rather than a
merely mechanical action.
The Pied Rock-Thrush is a widely distributed species, and
may be found in open rocky country through southern Europe to
northern China during the breeding season, going southward on
migration to Africa, &amp;c. According to Dixon, it has a moderate
migration flight of 3000--5000 miles.
The song of the male, at any rate of the male in captivity,
is a pleasing little warble but hardly deserving the name of
"song." At other times than when actually breeding, it will
give utterance to a soft sweet "recording" sort of song, often
whilst squatting in some sheltered corner, very pleasing to listen
to. I have known it " record " in this way after sunset, when so
dark that only its white back could be distinguished. The
female will also occasionally record.
Both male and female have a plaintive mournful single
note, which is often heard during the breeding season. An
approach to the nest, the sight of a cat, anything which causes
anxiety will lead to its utterance. This note becomes more and
more frequent and urgent as the young become older. As soon
as the young have left the nest, this note is accompanied and
shortly superseded by a Blackbird--Fieldfare cuck-cuck-c 7 ick note.
O11 one occasion recently, this call was being uttered with such
frequency and vehemence that I went out with the set purpose
of interviewing that cat. But no cat was to be seen, the father
was composedly preening his feathers, mother was not doing
anything in particular, and the young were reposing. But the
mck-cuck was being poured forth more strenuously than ever.
On following the sound up to a sheltered corner, I found that it
proceeded from that exquisite mocker and irrepressible joker the
Regent Bird, whose great delight is to get a rise out of his poor
old dad.

The display of some of the males is very fine, while that
of others scarcely attracts attention. The bird, with feathers all
ruffled out, will pursue the female slowly, uttering a chirping
cry ; at one time he will dash after her vigorously ; and then, on
a perch just below her, with head down and greatly extended,
with wings and tail (especially the latter) expanded, shewing off
the full colours of the tail and head contrasted with the pure
white of the back and dorsal scapulars, he will make love for
some minutes. I think it is Mr. Astley who tells of a solitary
male that used to come and display to him.
These birds go to roost at a late hour, especially when
winged insects are about, after which they will hawk until
nothing of them can be seen but the male's white back.
When a shy male in colour desires to escape observation,
he " points" at one in just the same manner as 1 lie Pitta (O.S.,
VIII., p. 25S).
Examples differ, but some of these Rock-Thrushes become
exceedingly tame, and will fly on to one's hand, head, or shoulder
without hesitation. My present female, with outstretched wings,
will scur-r-r and rush at and peck my hands if I do not bring her
what she wants ; and when I enter the aviary with cockroach
traps she is all about me, and I have to exercise care lest I should
injure her. When the time came that the male turned upon her,
and tried to kill her, and hunted her so that she could not feed, I
used to place a dish of food on the ground between my straddled
legs and literally stand over her while she fed, and finally carried
her into the adjoining aviary perched on the edge of a food-
saucer.
I do not know any bird that is so watchful and sharp of
sight as the male of this species when he has young. He is one
of the few birds which can see a person at a distance through the
glass of a window even when one stands well back. The 1899
father (see below) was the most difficult to watch. With a meal-
worm in his bill, he would wait motionless for any time rather
than carry it to the nest while any one could be seen. The male
of this year seemed to think I was hardly worth taking into
account, and watched rather the occupants of my neighbours'
gardens, which interfered no little with the carrying of food to

the young&amp;apos;. It is during the nesting season, irrespective of
courtship and displaying, that these birds bear themselves with
greatest distinction ; they are then never lumpy or inert but are
invariably slim and tight, drawing themselves up to their highest
so as to have the more extensive view, and holding themselves,
the male in particular, so erect and upright that he may not
infrequently be seen within a shade of being absolutely perpen-
dicular.

THE DISPLAY OF THE COCK OSTRICH.
By R. I. Pocock, F.L.S., F.Z.S., M.B.O.U.
Superintendent of the Zoological Society&amp;apos;s Gardens.
The display of cock birds in the breeding season, when
both sexes are normally at the height of their physical vigour,
has always appeared to me to be one of the most fascinating side
issues of aviculture. It is, moreover, a phenomenon in the
natural history of birds, which, apart from its intrinsic attractive-
ness, is worth the closest attention, for as yet no satisfactory
explanation of it has been suggested. Important contributions
to this end can be made by aviculturists who have the opportunity
of making and recording observations upon species in captivity
which naturalists, for the most part, have no chance of studying
in the wild. It may be objected that research into such matters
is, strictly speaking, not the province of aviculture at all. Per-
haps it is not ; but since I am of the opinion that the scope of
aviculture should be extended to embrace all the ornithological
phenomena that fall under the notice of those who keep birds in
captivity: and since I feel convinced that a large number of
the members of our Society are as interested in the subject of the
courtship of birds as I am myself, I offer no apology tor occupy-
ing a few pages of our magazine with some cursory remarks upon
the subject, prefacing them by a description of the very wonder-
ful display of the cock Ostrich as I have seen it in the Zoological
Gardens; and I do this the more readily because the majority of
our members will probably never be given an opportunity of
witnessing this impressive spectacle.

The facts I have to record are in themselves not new to
science. I saw the display myself for the first time in June, 1906,
and sent a brief account of it to the Field , which was published
on July 7th of that year. I have seen it a few times since, and
long ago asked Mr. W. S. Berridge, F.Z.S., to be good enough to
watch for a chance of permanently recording the bird's attitudes
by means of the camera. This he has at length succeeded in
doing. It is indeed to his enterprise and perseverance that I owe
the opportunity of publishing the photographs accompanying this
paper, which show, in a most realistic manner, the extraordinary
poses of the bird while so occupied.
Taking a position facing the lien, the cock bird drops to
his hocks in a squatting attitude, spreads his wings to their
fullest extent and lowers his tail till the long feathers touch the
ground. Then with his neck curved like a capital S and inclined
backwards over his shoulder, the vocal sac at the same time being
distended, he sways slowly and rhythmically from side to side,
touching the ground first on one side then on the other with the
tips of his wings, and not infrequently setting their white plumes
ashake when they reach his highest point, his neck the while
being swung from right to left and swept with a backward move-
ment over the base of each wing in turn as it is lowered towards
the ground. This action is kept up for ten minutes or more.
The bird then suddenly rises to his feet, rushes towards the hen
with wings outspread, and sometimes recommences the perform-
ance at close quarters, sometimes brings it to a close by stamping
on the ground like a soldier rapidly ' marking time.' I have never
myself seen the birds pair at the finish of the display. Perhaps
under natural conditions this is the final episode of the show.
And I have never heard the bird make any sound while display-
ing, despite the distention of his vocal sac, although it is no
uncommon thing to hear him roar at other times in the spring
and summer, as he struts about with inflated neck. One other
fact of interest is this : the hen does not seem to pay the slightest
attention to the cock during his performance. On the contrary
she treats him and his behaviour with the most supreme
indifference.
That the main facts above described are not new has

Mr. R. I. Pocock,
already been stated. Mr. Frank Finn tells me that the display
of the South African Ostrich has already been described and
figured in the Zoologist, by C. Schreiner ; and in the issue of the
Field, for August 31st, 1907, my description published in 1906
was supplemented by an account by Mr. Scherren of two previous
records. One of these was given Mr. A. D. Bartlett (Wild
Animals in Captivity, p. 279) who observed the display of the
South African Ostrich (Stiuthio australis) ; the other was given by
Dr. Paul Kammerer ( Zool. Garten, 1904, p. 203) who described
that of the pink-skinned African Ostrich (,Strut kio came his), the
specimen observed being one of the birds of the Matarieh
Ostrich Farm, near Cairo, which was said to have been trained
by the keeper to show off at command. However that may be,
it is interesting to note that practically the same actions accom-
pany the display in all the different kinds of Ostriches in which
the phenomenon has been recorded. It may be added that the
Somaliland Ostrich that has come under my notice is called
Struthio molybdophanes and is grey- or blue-skinned like the
South African bird to which it is nearly allied.
I have briefly alluded to the fact that the hen Ostrich, so
far as can be judged by her behaviour, exhibits complete indiff-
erence towards the displaying cock. Similar indifference on
the part of hen birds of various species has been repeatedly
noticed by myself. It is indeed a matter of common know-
ledge to many observers of birds ; and this indifference is
one of the most baffling facts to be faced in attempting to
reconcile the phenomena of sexual display with Darwin's theory
of sexual selection, or rather with that part of the theory which
deals with the mode of sexual selection which Lloyd Morgan has
aptly called Preferential Mating.
Darwin's idea was that the beautiful ornaments of many
cock birds have been gradually perfected in the course of ages
by the hens preferring to mate, generation after generation, with
those cocks which possessed the most gorgeous colours 011
luxuriant plumes. Thus the brilliantly tinted cock birds secured
mates and transmitted their beauty, sometimes in an accentuated
form, to their young; while the duller individuals were forced
to remain, for the most part, bachelors, and failed to hand on

tlieir ornamental imperfections. For a variety of reasons this
hypothesis has only met with the partial approbation of naturalists.
For although there is a good deal to be said in its favour, there
are also many difficulties in the way of its acceptance. One
difficulty has been already pointed out, namely the apparent
indifference hens evince towards displaying cocks; I say
"apparent" because they may, unknown to us, be taking stock
all the time of the beauty-points of their suitors. Nevertheless
it must be admitted that they do not watch them with the
attentive air they show towards other things that attract their
notice. Another difficulty in this: birds, as well as mammals,
have their likes and dislikes in the matter of mates. A cock will
take to one individual lieu and not to another, or vice versa.
That, I am sure, is well known ; but, I believe, it is no overstate-
ment to say that the reason for the preference is never apparent
to us. At all events it has never been so to me ; and so far as I
am aware no direct observations have been made which show or
even tend to show that cock birds chosen as mates are more
beautiful than those that are rejected.
Again, cock birds when in full feather will not uncommonly
go through all the display characteristic of their species when
hens are nowhere at hand- Sometimes they display to one
another; sometimes to nothing at all. I have seen a Peacock in
full show for the benefit apparently of half-a-dozen Sparrows
feeding from a trough ; and I have no reason to doubt the
veracity of a friend who told me he had witnessed such a display
before an old felt hat on the ground.
Some birds also, in which the two sexes are alike, behave
at the breeding season in a manner that would be called display-
ing if there was any special ornamentation to show. For
instance Sea Gulls and Cockatoos bow and curtsey, and pose in
other eccentric ways towards one another. Albatrosses do the
same ; and many more examples could be cited.
Now the facts that ornamented cock birds show off in the
absence of hens and that the unadorned individuals also have
the instinct to pose are not inexplicable on Darwin's hypothesis;
but they suggest very forcibly that posing at the breeding season
preceded, in an evolutionary sense, the development of ornamen-

were developed on those areas that the posing cock naturally
presented to the hen. Attitudinising, or the performance of
antics, is perhaps the natural outcome of the disturbance that
overtakes the organism when the breeding fever holds sway, as
Wallace pointed out. It is ecstatic in the true etymological sense
of that term. In other words the cock birds appear to be beside
themselves and to behave as if struck with temporary insanity;
possibly, indeed, at that time their faculties are somewhat de-
ranged, if I may make use of so anthropomorphic an expression,
One would expect different birds to be affected in different ways
by the organic disturbance above alluded to, and to show it by
differences of pose. Perhaps indeed at one time peculiarities of
pose were characteristic of families or, at all events, of genera;
and this consideration brings me to another interesting question
connected with display, namely, to what extent resemblances and
differences in display are to be regarded as indications of affinity
between birds. That some closely allied species, like, for
example, the Gold and Amherst Pheasant, display in exactly the
same way is known ; but perhaps it may not have occurred to
some of my readers that the display of the cock Turkey is almost
identical with that of the Peacock, although the former has no
resplendent train to raise with his tail-feathers. Now, has the
similarity in the pose of these two birds when displaying been in-
dependently acquired or is it a sign of near relationship between
them ?
Questions such as these are of great interest to naturalists
as a whole, and have an important bearing on ornithology; and
my reason for touching briefly upon the subject is the hope that
I may induce aviculturists to furnish additional data relating to
the courtship and display of birds. Especially would facts be
welcomed that helped to confirm or refute Darwin's hypothesis
of sexual selection. I have not mentioned the facts that lend it
support, and have only briefly touched upon one or two which
tend to break it down, because several of these, both pro and con,
have nothing directly to do with Birds. So far as Birds them-
selves are concerned the theory stands, I believe, almost exactly
as it was left by Wallace's criticism in " Darwinism." It remains.

quite unsubstantiated and, at the same time, insusceptible of

can supply, are badly needed.

By Hubert D. Asteey, F.Z.S., M.B.O.U.
On my return from Italy on the 1st of June I found that
my fine pair of Red-capped Parrakeets had nested in a deep box,
and when I looked in there were six fine eggs, of a size which
seemed fairly large in proportion to the parents. The aviary
attendant told me the hen bird had been sitting for some time.
On the 7th of June I heard a faint squeaking when the hen bird
was off, and immediately considered it my duty, although I am
averse to prying into other people's affairs, to run for the aviary
ladder, climb up and peep in.
Four young ones ! apparently about four or five days old,
covered with grey down, which must have hatched a day or two
after I looked in the nest, but no trace of the two eggs which had
not hatched ; not a remnant of a shell as far as I could see.
Having, when counting these chickens before they were hatched,
determined to take one to rear up by hand, on the 2nd of July I
again looked in, and found that the eldest of the brood was just
beginning to show his feathering on the secondary quills, a good
age for beginning his education, so I dived my hand down and
extracted him. Uncommonly like a young vulture, ugly, exceed-
ingly ugly to other people's eyes, but to mine most beautiful.
I proudly thought as I held him in my hand, " Perhaps this is
the first Red-capped Parrakeet that will be reared in England, or
indeed maybe in Europe," until I heard, a few days later, that
the same species was nesting in Mr. FasejCs aviaries. Covered
thickly with grey fluff, and a patch of the same at the nape of the
neck of dull white, the quills breaking through like a porcupine,
he certainly looked a queer object. Those of the under tail-

Mr. Hubert D. Astley,
coverts were as red as red could be, which gave me every hope
that I had selected a male bird.
Then came the question as to his food. The parent birds
were feeding almost entirely on green grass seeds--principally of
the kind known as 'Tinker-tailor,'--as well as dandelion, sow-
thistle and lettuce. Generally, as far as I could see, the female
was assiduously and gallantly fed by the male directly she came
out of the nest-box, and then she passed the meal on to her
progeny. There was very nearly a slip between the cup and the
lip, for one day--that was before I took the young one under my
care--I heard within the nest-box a terrific row--not downstairs
but upstairs. Such a scuffling and a scolding. I looked in the
aviary for the old birds, neither of them were to be seen. Had
the father of the family suddenly turned into a murderer? for
someone was shouting murder within, without much doubt.
Someone was decidedly ruffled, and certainly / felt so ! Seizing
the ladder, and all but tumbling over in my anxious haste, I
unhooked the box, which hangs high up in a dark corner of the
roosting house, and removing the lid at the top, it was a case of
"When the pie was opened"--within were the two parent birds,
their four babies, and a Rosella ! ! After he had been extracted,
the verdict was " Not guilty," for I am convinced he had gone in
to assist in feeding the young, but like people who interfere in
other&amp;apos;s households, however well-meaning, he had not been
welcomed. It was the only time I ever saw the male Red-capped
Parrakeet in the nest, though I cannot positively say he does not
assist in feeding his young.
But I was speaking of the food for the young bird that I
had taken from the nest. I had failed a fortnight previously to
rear a young Bourke Parrakeet on "Marie" biscuit soaked in
boiled milk, although I think this species is a difficult one to bring
up by hand, and so I thought I would try a food recommended
to me by Mr. O. Millsum, of Regent Street, Swindon, which
he manufactures himself, and which he has named "Banana
Crystals " ; composed of banana and fresh eggs, cooked and pre-
pared in an especial manner, and looking in the dry state like
powdered biscuit. This food can be boiled in milk and sweetened,
and this I did. I was afraid it might be too liquid, and cause the

young Parrakeet to scour, but all has gone well. It is a splendid
food for birds with inflammation, with the addition of five drops
of brandy or whisky to a desert-spoonful of the mixture.
Another interesting brood--of two only--is that of hybrids
between a "Splendid" Rosella and a Stanley Parrakeet. The
"Splendid" Rosella is distinguished from the ordinary species by
the feathers on the back, which have a very brilliant yellow
edging to each one ; indeed I fancy the bird is altogether brighter.
Last year the Stanleys reared one young, but this spring a
divorce took place, and the hen Stanley forsook her lawful hus-
band to mate with the Rosella. Perhaps she was taken by his
more gorgeous appearance, but it is hard luck on her former
husband, or perhaps it is'nt! ! One has known such cases ! and
I have been rearing by hand one of these hybrids.
Now the father has white cheeks and the mother yellow
ones ; why then should those of their progeny be pale blue ? The
bird that I have been rearing seems otherwise to favour the
Stanley more than the Rosella, both in size and colour, although
his breast runs from scarlet to yellow and apple-green on the
underparts. He might be dubbed the " Blue-cheeked " Stanley
Parrakeet. Unlike many hybrids, he is quite as beautiful as
either of his parents. It was the father of the hybrids which
trespassed into the house of the Red-caps, perhaps in an absent
fit of mind.
There is one point to be noticed in the young Red-capped
Parrakeet, and that is that the whole head and cheeks are of an
almost uniform green, with a dull baud of red over the nostrils,
instead of the cherry coloured cap and yellow-green cheeks of
the adult. The breast is of a very dull-coloured fawnish mauve :
otherwise the colouring is similar to the parent birds.

she had been in nesting-box some time.
On 7th, heard squeaking of young ones. Found four, of at least

Mr. Frank Finn,
Scarlet quills to under tail-coverts, green feathering on secon-
daries, etc. Size of a large common Quail (circa).
17th of July. Looked in the nesting box, and found two out of
the three that I left, to be larger than the hand-reared one.
The largest was a fine bird, which immediately on being
released, flew as strongly as its parents, and would evidently
have left the nest before had the box not been a very deep one,
and had the parent birds not gnawed away all the perches which
had been placed inside to enable the young to get out.
This bird ate some seed the same day that it was put out.
AVICULTURE at the zoo.
By Frank Finn.
The most important event in breeding to be recorded is the
hatching of four young Willow-Grouse in the end compartment
--that nearest the Reptile house--of the Southern Pheasantry.
Two of them have died, but the survivors are now as large as
quails, and feathered all except the head.
A pair of Indian Bank Mynahs (Acridotheres ginginianus )
have a young one in a box in the Western Aviary; this is not
only a record, so far as I am aware, for the breeding of this
species in this country, but is of especial interest; first, because
this bird naturally breeds in banks and burrows out its owu
nest-liole, like a sand-martin ; and secondly, because the young
one was hatched about a fortnight before the keepers found it
out, and so the old ones had no live food to feed it with at first.
The Pectoral Rails in the paddocks outside the Apes'
House have another brood ; Mr. Seth-Smith, I am glad to say,
promises to give us a full account later on. The young Black
Tanager is fully fledged and independent now ; it is much paler
and duller brown than the lieu.
Among recent additions, a very important one, new to the
collection, is to be noted :--
Shining Flycatcher (Phaenopepia nitens). This species is
referred by American ornithologists to the Waxwings ( Ampelidce );

Erythrura prasina.
By Dr. A. G. Butler.
Whereas the Parrot-Finch (E. psittacea) seems to be tolerably
hardy and quite easy to breed in captivity, the much commoner
but more elegantly formed and, in my opinion, more beautiful
Pintailed Nonpareil is generally admitted to be exceptionally
delicate and, so far as I can ascertain, has only been bred in
Germany in the artificially heated birdrooms of that country.
It is of no use to ask ourselves why this little bird is short-
lived in English aviaries and to adopt all the suggestions which
even the most experienced aviculturists can offer ; for, when we
have done everything, the birds still die, and I believe they
always will do so unless we either keep them at a high tempera-
ture or else buy a large number, turn them out into a sunny
sheltered outdoor aviary at the beginning of the summer, keep
them there until after the early frosts have commenced and then
confine them for the winter in a moderately warmed indoor
aviary : by this means it may be possible to save the stronger
individuals and perhaps breed a vigorous race from them in the
following summer.
Altogether I have had ten of these birds ; of these the first
two--healthy-looking cock birds, both died in three weeks; then
a pair was purchased ; the hen died six months later and the cock
only survived for seventeen months. Of six birds sent to me in
1896 one died three days after its arrival, two within a fortnight,
one in less than nine months. I turned the surviving pair into
a sheltered outdoor aviary in May 1907 and brought them indoors
again in October: they never attempted to breed throughout the
summer, and in April 1908 the cock bird died ; the hen, however,
had been so far invigorated by her summer out-of-doors that she
survived until May 1909.

The late Mr. Wiener was of opinion that delicacy in any
bird was always attributable to the lack of some article of diet;
he expressed this opinion in the case of the Gouldian Finch,
which we now know to be quite hardy and long-lived if kept
during the summer months and through the early frosts in an
outdoor aviary ; moreover young birds born under these con-
ditions are as robust as any other Grassfinch. Nevertheless I
consider it only right to try every means to lengthen the lives
of our birds, and therefore when my first two Pintails, fed upon
paddy-rice, white millet, spray-millet, canary, and with a large
patch of turf to pick over, died in three weeks, I determined to
try different food with the pair bought subsequently ; I therefore,
in their case, substituted oats for paddy-rice, and wrongly
attributed their greater longevity to that cause. With those given
to me later I gave oats mixed with the rice, but found that only
the paddy was eaten: then I saw in Mr. Frank Finn's excellent
little book " Pets and How to keep them " that he recommended
fruit--orange and banana as a necessary food for these little
finches. I gave them orange, banana, and later grapes and red-
currants, but not one of them took the least notice of these
delicacies; they simply confined their attention to the paddy and
millet; and, unlike Gouldian Finches, they evidently much
preferred the white to the spray millet.
The Pintailed Nonpareil is an interesting little bird from
the fact that there are (as in the Gouldian Finch) two types of
male; and, unless the different coloration is due to age in the
latter sex, also two types of female.
The ordinary male, with sap-green upper surface, crimson
rump and tail, smalt-blue forehead, sides of face, throat and fore
chest, golden-brown to cinnamon fore-breast, sides, flanks, thighs,
and (paler) under tail-coverts and bright scarlet hind breast and
abdomen, is well known to us all, but the male which I turned
out moulted from the young plumage into a bird of a much
deeper green above with golden ochreous rump and tail (the
latter becoming blackish long before the extremity), the forehead
very faintly bluish, the breast much more smoky and the
abdominal patch bright golden ochreous instead of scarlet.
The less gaudy female of the ordinary type is also well-

known, with its huffish under surface suffused with pale dusky
ashy on the breast; but my hen which survived for over three
years is altogether darker, has the sides of the head, throat and
breast suffused with dull blue, which passes imperceptibly into
the dull ochraceous brownish or muddy clay-colour of the re-
mainder of the under surface.
I believe the second type of male is well known to scient-
ists, but the female I had not previously heard of, and it occurred
to me that it might represent one of those instance of gradually
acquired melanism which one meets with from time to time in
very vigorous individuals of a species when they attain to an
unusual age : certainly a life which can hardly have exceeded
four years does not strike one as very venerable, but the Pintailed
Nonpareil may be naturally short-lived ; the introduction of blue
on the sides of the head, throat, and breast, might be acquired as
an approach to the male colouring, if the bird suffered from
atrophy of the functional ovary, but then one would have expect-
ed to find the forehead also washed with, blue and the abdomen
with scarlet.
I believe that, in the case of the Zebra-finch, about three
years would represent the natural life, though in captivity I have
kept these birds for seven or eight years ; in the latter case they
always deepen in colour, though I have seen no such strikingly
melauistic forms in that species as the male Gouldian Finch
which I described in the Ibis for 1903, or the female Pintailed
Nonpareil described above.

This species differs rather markedly from Sycalis flaveola.
It is only about two-thirds of the size of the latter, and the
female, instead of closely resembling the male, is grey in colour
with darker striations, the only yellow she shows being the
narrow margins of the flight feathers. I had a little difficulty in
identifying my birds because this species is described in Dr.

one," but I have since heard from Dr. Butler that this was an
oversight. Had not that very accurate writer, W. H. Hudson,
stated that the song resembles that of \0x25BAS. flaveola I should have
noted this also as a point of difference, for certainly my male
sang a rather sweet, low, and distinctly plaintive refrain, but I
can only conclude, in view of W. H. Hudson's statement, that
this was exceptional.
I obtained my pair of Pelzelns from Mr. Cross, of Liver-
pool, and turned them out in May of last year. They commenced
to sit on 13th June and the young (three) flew on 10th July. I
have the following note of their colour--"like the hen but have
a rather warmer shade on back ; beak dark horn colour." Both
the nests built in my aviary were of the small, neat, compact
Serin type but were constructed inside nest boxes. The eggs--
in each case five in number--were very handsome, being richly
and thickly spotted with dark chocolate. They were apparently
entirely reared on live insect food, although this species is quite
content with hard seed when not breeding. I have, however,
long since found it best to discard all general principles and pre-
conceived ideas in dealing with breeding species.
6&amp;apos;. pelzelni seems to be rarely imported and, probably only
for this reason, I have not as yet heard of any instance of young
having been reared, because there is little doubt but that this
hardy little bird could be quite easily bred even in a cage.

Paradise Flycatcher. Terpsiphotie paradisi.
Although so widely distributed in India, this bird must be
very local, as, although it is a species which would hardly escape
anyone's observation, and I was particularly anxious to see it,
I only saw it twice in the free state, two individuals at Dehra
Doon, and one which came on board the ship when I was going
out to India for the first time, on the afternoon of October 7th,
1894. No land was in sight, and the ship's position at noon was
15.19 N., 82.36 K. ; we had been at Madras on the previous day

and entered the Hooghly two days afterwards. All these
specimens were females or short-tailed immature males.
I once bought a brood of three young birds and tried,
unsuccessfully, alas! to rear them; they showed a remarkable
graduation in plumage, one being completely chestnut brown
above, even on the head, one having the orthodox immature
plumage, and one being intermediate. The first-named no
doubt represented the primitive immature plumage which the
species is losing; we had a similar one in the museum. A male
I kept for two days 011 insects cast a pellet after that time. I
either let it go then or gave it to our member, Mr. F. Groser,-- I
forget which. By the way, that gentleman told me he had
observed this bird feeding on butterflies commonly, cutting off
their wings with the snap of the bill by which it caught them.
I11 view of the rarity of the observed attacks 011 butterflies by
birds, this observation is of interest.
Hume's Weaver. Ploceus megarhynchus , Hume.
The Ploceus megarhynchus of Oates should be P. atrigula ,
as I showed in the Ibis, for 1901. The true P. megarhynchus is
the biggest of Asiatic Weavers, as large as the Rufous-necked
Weaver ( Hyphantornis textor) of Africa, and i 11 plumage is nearly
all yellow except the wings and tail. On March 13th, 1902, I
noted a dozen specimens of this large Indian Weaver in the
Tiretta Bazaar, the chief bird market of Calcutta. They were in
undress plumage and had come from Lalkua, near Kathgodam.
Next day I found they had been sold for training; they were said
to be better for this purpose than the common Weavers, so some
natives knew them. The man who brought them evidently did,
as he said they would become very yellow. Some at an}&amp;apos; rate of
this consignment reached England, and were exhibited there,
ultimately, I believe, coming into Mr. W. Rothschild's possession.
Eastern Baya Weaver. Ploceus atrigula.
This species frequently shows some yellow in the breast,
which should be buff even in the breeding plumage ; no doubt
this is due to admixture with the typical or Yellow-breasted Baya
(P. bay ah).

This is supposed to be a Chinese bird, but it appears to
occur in the Himalayas, for our member, Mr. Eh W. Harper,
procured a live male specimen in 1892 from a consignment of
birds from the neighbourhood of Naini Tab He kindly lent it
to me for examination, and I compared it with the figure and
description in David and Oustalet's Oiseaux de la Chive , and so
identified it without doubt. Its measurements were : 6 inches
long; bill from gape \ inch; closed wing 2&amp;apos;S inches ; shank fat
back), 1 inch. The beak is rather Sparrow-like, not so Bullfinch like
as in the common Rose-finch, the general colour uniform dark
crimson or claret, not striated anywhere, the abdomen paler;
there is a broad eyebrow, from eye to nape, &amp;lt;-f pointed pink-
tipped feathers; the wings and tail are very dai k brown, with
pink tips to the tertiaries (which quills were, however, mostly
missing in this specimen).

It has been said by many that to keep up such celebrations
as Primrose Day, Trafalgar Day, and Empire Day shows a de-
generation of the age, and that no ships were ever built by saying
what fine men we had in olden days, nor was any Empire made

could be found than the result of the Darwin celebrations of the
last two years. In commemorating the Jubilee of the 'Origin,'
or the centenary of Darwin's birth, scientists have rendered an
account of their stewardship during the last fifty years, and it
must be acknowledged by those not too obsessed with pet theories
that the advance has been comparatively small, and that the

main theory of evolution stands to-day where Darwin placed it
in 1858.
True many more ' bricks ' have been made in the shape of
new facts brought to light, and new species discovered, but this
has proved such a fascinating pursuit and so easy of accomplish-
ment that no architect has troubled to build up a new and more
solid edifice with these materials, but when they did not fit into
the existing building they have been either hammered into place
or left among the rubbish at the foot of the building to be covered
up with the dust of time.
The first sign of ' renaissance,' if we may so term it, took
place in iqoo, when from this so-called rubbish, De Vries,
Correns, Tschermak and Bateson re-discovered Mendels' Law ;
but although the effects of this discovery will have a wide and
far-reaching effect on the thought and trend of modern zoological
science, practical breeders will realise that it is but one of many
factors which go to make up the very complex but all important
laws of heredity.
Now, however, thanks to the several books commemora-
tive of Darwin's work, we can clearly see how far we have
progressed, and in what direction further advance must be made,
so that there is evety reason to hope that the next 50 years will
see a permanent and substantial increase in our knowledge of
Nature's laws.
Dewar and Finn's book on ' The Making of Species ' is the
latest of the books called forth by the Darwin celebrations, and
although many may not entirely agree with its tenets, it must at
the same time give cause to think to all who read it with an open
mind. It deals with most of the generally accepted facts of
Darwinism and argues in simple, fair-minded and moderate
language the cases both for and against them. There is nothing
much that is new in the book, but, on the other hand, there is
much valuable information, and the facts have been marshalled
in such a manner that not only can the ' man in the street' form
his own conclusions--not necessarily accep:ing those of the
authors--but the fair and open-minded biologist will be obliged
to concede that there is much force in many of the arguments,
even though he may not altogether agree with the deductions
drawn therefrom.

It is impossible in a short review to deal in detail with a

Its main themes are as follows:--

(1) That great as is the power of Natural Selection it cannot

Selection, since, as soon as a variety is sufficiently 'pro-
tectively' coloured to escape its pursuers, Natural Selection
cannot go on perfecting it in the minute particulars in
which such resemblances are often found, as, for instance,
in the case of a Kallima butterfly, which mimics a dead leaf
even to the venations and possibly also the fungus spots !
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.738737363636364" page_id="32659955"  page_num="303" year="" vol="">
(3) That Natural Selection cannot perfect or eliminate varieties
when they are as yet too slight to be of any service or
harm to the individual.
(4) That variations tend to be correlated, that is to say, two or
more variations tend to be inherited together, so that
Natural Selection in perfecting one variety may, at the
same time be permitting other varieties (provided they are
not harmful) to persist. Hence varieties may develop
which are of no special utilitarian or other service to the
animal.

sidered the chief factors through which Natural Selection
acts, are only one of the several causes leading to the
limitation in the numbers of any particular species.
The authors point out that isolation, climate, food supply,
and so forth, have a much more limiting effect than is
generally allowed, and if this be so it seems doubtful if
the colouration of many animals is due to the modifying
action of Natural Selection.
Only two new suggestions or ideas are brought forward,
neither of which, in the writer's opinion, seem to bear much
weight.
The first is that inheritance may be due to what is termed
'Biological Molecules.' For instance, there is supposed to be a
Biological Molecule of colour made up of atoms, each of which

controls the colour of a certain part of the body, and in the same
way there will be a biological molecule for other characters. Now
it is supposed that the atoms in the molecules of each individual
have a definite arrangement, which, as a ncle , is not altered in the
progeny when two individuals of the same species pair together,
but it is suggested that the arrangement may be altered and thus
give rise to a mutation.
The process is considered analogous to well known facts
of chemistry, in which connection alcohol and ether are instanced
as having the same formula C 2 Ho O, but entirely different pro-
perties owing to the different arrangement of the atoms in their
molecules.
The authors allow that this idea is merely a suggestion (not
even a hypothesis), but it seems a pity to have introduced it
without calling up more facts to support it aud elaborating it
further, and we are surprised to find no mention of Weismann's
biophors, ids, or determinants, as the last two seem to us to be
the molecules and atoms of the present work.
On the very debatable topic of sexual dimorphism, the
authors, after entering into the pros, and cons, of sexual selection,
suggest that sexual dimorphism arose as a mutation, and when
not detrimental to the species it was not eliminated by Natural
vSelection. With this view we cannot agree for the fact that it
was merely not detrimental would not be sufficient reason for its
development and perfection by Natural Selection. To persist
and swamp the original form it would have to be beneficial to the
race, and the author's themselves allow that the percentage of
deaths among bright-coloured males is probably greater than
among their more soberly clad brothers, so that for it to have
survived, if it arose by mutation, the whole foundation of evolu-
tion by Natural Selection would have to be abandoned.
Enough, however, has been said to show the main features
of the book, and, in conclusion, the authors are of opinion that
the line of future advance will lie in the study of the living rather
than the dead. With this idea we are entirely in accord ; avi-
culturists, breeders, and fanciers know only too well that most, if
not all, of their results are got by experimental breeding. There
is as yet no definite series of rules by which we can make sure of

breeding any particular type, although that type has already been
produced so that we know it to be a possible form. The Laws of
Inheritance are still in a sealed book, and those that have been
brought forward still 'unproven.' Here then is aline of research
in which anyone can assist by merely recording accurate facts.
We heartily recommend this book to all aviculturists (it is written
in quite simple and popular language) for they will get a com-
prehensive idea of what has been done, and realize where existing
theories&amp;apos;require further elucidation and where further knowledge
is needed.
There is just one point in this otherwise excellent book to
which we must add a word of protest, namely the Preface.
Luckily for the authors, their bark is considerably worse than
their bite; but with the evidence in the book placed so fairly
before readers, surely it was unnecessary to condemn in a bunch
all 'cabinet naturalists ' and to set themselves up on a pinnacle
from which to judge scientific thought?
This Preface cannot fail to set many of their more scien-
tific readers against the book from the beginning and will thus
greatly militate against the acceptance of their arguments.
We lay special stress on this because the body of the book
is so essentially a fair criticism of the facts that we cannot but
consider the Preface very ill advised. Nor do we think that the
book ' will come as a shock to many scientific men,' for it cannot
fail to convince the open mind by the genuineness of its argu-
ments. J, L. B.
CORRESPONDENCE, NOTES, ETC.
SEESEE PARTRIDGES.
Sir, --In the July number of the Avicullural Magazine [ (2) vii. pp.
269-270 (1909)] Mr. J. L. Bonhote has published some notes on the animals
living in the Giza Zoological Gardens. I11 these he has made some very
inaccurate and misleading remarks regarding the Seesee Partridges (Ammo-
perdix heyi, Tenim. and A. cholmleyi. Grant) which require correction, lest
they should lead others astray. Mr. Bonhote writes: "The Game-Birds
are represented by several Pheasants of the species most commonly kept
(e.g. Golden, Silver and Amherst) and two very fine liens of the Javanese
Peafowl, as well as a very fine lot of Hey's Rock Partridges (Ammoperdix
heyi). A good description and plate of this species was given in the Maga-

zine by Mr. Trevor Battye a few years back.* Mr. Battye correctly identified
bis birds as A. heyi, but the following month, at the instance of Mr. Ogilvie-
Grant, he stated that they belonged to the Southern form ( A . cholmleyi). . .
" Examples from Egypt resemble the Southern form in lacking the
white forehead, but in all other respects they are indistinguishable from
typical Palestine birds, and as I have seen a skin from Palestine, in which
the white forehead was absent, there is little doubt that the Egyptian form
should be known as A. heyi , and that Mr. Battve's article is perfectly
correct."
A. heyi, which inhabits the Eastern shores of the Bed Sea, ranges
from the Dead Sea southwards throughout Arabia to Muscat on the Persian
Gulf.
The male birds have the forehead and lores zvhite ; and, as a rule, even
in freshly moulted birds the plumage is paler than A. cholmleyi.
A. cholmleyi inhabits the Western shores of the Red Sea, and ranges
through Egypt and Nabia, as far south as the Erba Mountains and Suakin.
The male birds have no Irace of zvhite on the forehead and lores. The
plumage is, as a rule, darker than in A. heyi, and the head, mantle, and
breast are washed with vinaceous.
It is clear from the above quotation that Mr. Bonhote could not have
understood what he was writing about.
x. The character which distinguishes A. cholmleyi from A. heyi is the
absence of zvhite on the forehead and lores. A glance at Mr. Trevor-Battve&amp;apos;s
plate is sufficient to show that the male bird figured there is certainly an
example of A. cholmleyi and not of A. heyi. I subsequent^ examined Mr.
Battve&amp;apos;s living birds and found that such was undoubtedly the case.
2. In the British Museum there are two male examples from Egypt,
which does not differ in any marked degree from the type-specimens of A.
cholmleyi which were procured near Suakin.
3. It would be interesting to know where Mr. Bonhote has "seen a
skin from Palestine, in which the white forehead was absent," as it is cer-
tainly not to be found among the British Museum series of seven males,
which he has examined. W. R. OGir.viE-GRANT.

Sir, --I regret that several causes have prevented an earlier reply on
my part to Dr. Ticeluirst's request for an account of the breeding of the
Water-Rail (ll a Hits aquaticus ) in Kent, and I trust that he will hold me
guiltless of intentional discourtesy in the matter.
First of all, then, it must be quite eighteen years ago that I saw the
young Water-Rails of which I spoke in my letter that appeared in the
January number of the Avicnltural Magazine. The date can only be fixed
approximately, and not exactly, for the following reason. I was partly

educated--" finished off," I believe is the correct term--in Paris, and I spent
three of my holidays (two summers and one winter) in travelling about
Europe; the summer of 1889 I spent in Eastern Europe, going from Buda-
Pestli to the Black Sea in the company of one of my professors--an ardent
ornithologist--who was studying the avian life of Hungary and the Balkan
Provinces, especially that of the vast marshy tracts which lie on either side
of the River Danube and its tributary streams. Now I cannot remember
whether it was in the following year or the one after that that I was staying
at Sandwich in Kent and saw the young Water-Rails ; and it is for that
reason my observation cannot constitute a scientific record, as I hold that all
records must be exact both as to time and place. Anyhow, while fishing
one day during the early summer of 1890 or 1S91, in what are known as the
Ricliborough Ponds, so-called from their close proximity to the ruins of
Richborough Castle, the ancient Roman fortress of Rutupiae, I saw a
Water-Rail and her young ones pass by within six yards of where I was
sitting motionless on the bank ; they came from a patch of reeds on the
castle side of the pond and disappeared into the main body of reeds on the
opposite side. They were in full view for quite a minute, and I am
absolutely certain of their identity, because I saw so many in Eastern
Europe in that enormous marsh that stretches from Kalarash as far as
Ibraila, in Great Wallachia, a distance of about 150 miles. Although I saw
these birds, it did not strike me as being anything out of the way, and
even now I can hardly realize that it is not only uncommon, but the fact
that the Water-Rail has nested in Kent has not previously been recorded bv
some observers. Had this been known to meat the time my observations
would certainly have been recorded with fuller data than I am able to give
at this late period of time after the event. I trust that this imperfect
account of what may reasonably be considered an instance of the breeding
of the Water-Rail in Kent--for the young were only a few days old when
they were seen by me, and could not possibly have come in from another
county, as Sandwich lies on the extreme east of Kent--may prove of
interest to Dr. Ticehurst. PtCRCY W. Parnborough.

A RARE INDIAN FLYCATCHER.
There lately came into my possession a beautiful Flycatcher, which I
believed to be " Muscipeta brevirostris ." It is either that bird, or M.
flammeus.
Its colour is of a glossy black with deep bluish reflections on the head
and upper parts, whilst the breast, underparts, patch on wings and outer
tail feathers are brilliant nasturtium orange-red.
It has the short legs and small feet of a typical Flycatcher, as well as
the broadened grooved bill.
Habitat, portions of Himalayas and forests of India.

died soon after it came into my possession.

probably several members of the Avicultural Society who are
interested in these charming little waders, I am writing a few
notes as to how I recently brought over some of them from the
North of Iceland.
As travel in Iceland is very difficult and slow, the first
thing was to make provision for the birds whilst I remained in
the island. I accordingly took out with me some three-quarter
inch mesh wire netting, and in the first place covered in a short
length (about 12 ft.) of a little stream running near the farm
where I stayed. I, of course, included a strip of grass on one
bank and at each end of the enclosure, at and below water level,
piled stones so that the waste could run between them but the
birds not escape.
I found some Phalaropes in the places they like best--that
is small low grassy islands in the middle of a large river. The
birds, although absurdly tame, are by no means as easy to cap-
ture as one who has not tried would suppose. The way I tried
was to take a small square of fine string netting attached to the
middle of a piece of fishing line about 60 feet long. I got an
Icelandic boy and we each took one end of the line and, wading
in the river, floated the net in the water to the edge of an island
where Phalaropes were swimming. They are usually near the
bank for the purpose of catching the flies that fall into the water.
When the net had floated sufficiently near the bird, we suddenly

raised and pulled forward the net by pulling the line. As a
matter of fact the birds usually evaded the net by a few inches
only (their movements are exceedingly quick) and settled down
again a few yards off. However, we captured five birds and got
four more caught by a local farmer and put them all in the wire
enclosure. When these last four birds arrived, a gentleman,
skilled in the English language, remarked to me, " I should
think you have now got your fill of these philanthropes &amp;apos;&amp;apos; I
agreed, as my food supply was limited. Two of the birds died
almost at once (probably from injury or shock of capture), but
the others, after the first day, settled down and became quite
happy. One of the hens laid several eggs and all the birds
swam, basked in the sun, chatted incessantly and quarrelled,
just as they do when at liberty, except that, being kept in a
limited space, their disputes were naturally more frequent and
violent, though no harm resulted.
As to food. I took over with me to Iceland some dried
ants' eggs, dried flies and live mealworms. The latter were a
total failure, as they would not keep long enough to be useful.
The birds at once readily took the ants' eggs and dried flies, but
their main food supply was live maggots procured from several
3 lb. trout placed in the sun at a discreet distance from the farm.
I had the maggots well cleaned in sand from time to time in an
old biscuit tin and the birds ate them greedily; indeed there
seemed practically no limit to the numbers they would take.
At the end of a fortnight, after the first bird had been
caught, I had to move down to the coast, and the birds had to
endure an eight hours journey of violent shaking on the back of
an Icelandic pony. The track was very rough, but I gave the
birds a swim twice e?i roide, by having their travelling-box taken
off the pony and sunk a few inches in the edge of a stream. A
delayed steamer made the whole journey last eleven days, but
only one bird died, the others reaching Retford in good condition.
I may mention that I had the bottom of the birds' wooden
travelling-box covered with a layer of the fibrous turf which the
Icelanders use for pack saddles. This, made in sections which
could be turned over, and each piece in duplicate, gave a good
soft clean floor, which the birds seemed to like very much. I

had ordered a large supply of cleaned maggots at the port of
embarkation, and these maggots lasted throughout the voyage.
I have given my six Phalaropes to members of the Society
far more skilled than myself in the management of aquatic birds,
and I sincerely hope the birds will flourish, as more charmingly
active, vivacious little fellows I have never seen.
Personally I am disposed to think that, given fair con-
ditions, with some rough grass and a little pool of water, the
Red-necked Plialaropeshould readily breed in captivity; perhaps
it has already done so. It is, above all things, a water-loving
bird and well merits the name of " swimming-cock."
I may mention that, according to my observation, Phala-
ropes in their native haunts are by no means close sitters on the
nest, and often leave the eggs long before you get near, so the
nests are not easy to find. On the other hand, the old birds are
most devoted to their chicks, and will not leave them far if
danger threatens.
The Grey Plialarope, as far as I can ascertain, is very
scarce indeed in the north of Iceland.
THE PIED ROCK-THRUSH.
Monticola saxatilis.
(Cat. Birds Brit. Mus. V., p. 313.)
By Reginald Phillipps.
(Continued f ront page 2S6).
Although only a summer visitor to Europe, this cannot be
described as a delicate species. When in perfect health, in a
good-sized aviary, it does not appear to mind any ordinary cold,
presupposing of course that there are suitable shelters ; but there
is nothing to be gained by unnecessarily exposing it. On the
other hand, I question its being as hardy as is usually alleged.
Why does the wild bird select such sunny climes for its habita-
tion if it is really hardy ? Why keeps it not to the same latitudes
as the Fieldfare and the Redwing, or even as our own Song
Thrush? Why do my fledgelings rush after every gleam of sun,
of which so little has appeared since they have been in the

Mr. R. Philupps,
world? People are far too fond of asserting that a species is
hardy when it does not die off straight away on the first spell of
cold, or during a winter. But the seeds of death are often sown
only too surely; and months later the bird goes wrong and
dies of consumption, of kidney or liver disease, or some such
ailment. The constant wet and cold are certainly having an
adverse effect upon my two young ones which have survived, and
may have had much to do with the death of the two that did not.
The bird, however tame, is by nature shy, and it loves the open,
and it cannot be trusted to seek such shelter as is needful for the
preservation of its health.
In another sense, it is certainly delicate. There are few
species with which I am acquainted that suffer so seriously from
the effects of a too generous diet. Do not give your Rock-
Thrusli, as a regular article of food, either mealworms or gentles,
nor even wasp-grubs. Let it have cockroaches and other insects,
and spiders as many as you can supply. Vegetable food in some
form is of importance ; it takes fruit occasionally. I think that
winged insects, such creatures as daddy-long-legs, &amp;c., must be
of great value. Like hay and chaff to a horse in the stable, so
do the legs and wings act as "dispersers" in the stomach, and
greatly aid digestion ; the indigestible portions are cast in the
ordinary way. So desirable is something of this kind for the
Pied Rock-Thrush that, if it be not supplied, it will swallow rag,
string, &amp;c., all of which should carefully be kept away from the
aviary: string has quite a fascination for this bird.
For the most part, the Pied Rock-Thrush in the aviary is
amiably disposed towards other birds not nearly related--with
these there may be war to the death ; a male will even kill a
female of his own species, so watchfulness and care must be
exercised. In the spring-time, if there be any prospect of nest-
ing, the male will often hunt any large bird irrespective of
species. This year I had to remove a Waxwing, or it would
certainly have been killed. Years ago a female was sitting, and
whenever she needed a little relaxation or diversion she would
emerge and chase my old father Black Lark (O.S. V., p. 170).
Even with little birds they may be tempted beyond their
strength. One year there was a nestful of young Grey Singing-

Finches, but all were lifted, as I supposed at the time (so my
notes tell me) by some odd. Pied Rock-Thrushes. At page 327
of the number for last October, in a foot-note, I mention the
behaviour of my present female towards some nesting Cuba
Finches. She was not free from suspicion in two previous cases ;
but little by little I have cultivated her natural good manners and
hope that she is now fairly safe. Anyway this summer, while
she was herself nesting and her mate so alert, not six feet away
there was bred and successfully reared a little Waxbill, the first
of its kind ever bred in this country as I believe. So these Rock-
Thrushes are by no means a bad sort 011 the whole. Probably
she picked up her evil habits at the dealers' before she came into
my hands. And so of the mouse-killing male referred to by Mr.
Meade-Waldo at page 189 of last year. When a dealer has a
mouse or a dead bird, it is usually chucked to some bird near by,
who thus learns bad ways. When one comes to think of it, this
craving is not unnatural. The bird, cut off from suitable food
and correctives, swallows these little extras as aids to digestion ;
like the captive Cuckoo, of which we read from time to time such
remarkable statements, advanced for the purpose of proving its
affinity with the hawk. A person who cannot tell a cuckoo from
a hawk, on the wing or otherwise, must be a gowk. But to the
Cuckoo in captivity as to the Pied Rock-Thrush, a baby canary
might often be of real benefit.
How some people do wander from the subject in hand ! I
can't understand it.
This species is a very free wester in captivity ; and there
should not be any difficulty in successfully breeding it where the
aviary is sufficiently private and otherwise suitable, and when a
plentiful supply of insects can be obtained. If the nesting-box
be too exposed the female, at any rate with me, will either not
sit or will drop her eggs about anywhere, though even to this rule
there comes the exception, as will be seen by and by. With me,
the nest has invariably been built in some box fixed up as high
as possible, and has been constructed of hay (without mud), only
on one occasion rootlets having been added. If the receptacle
be large, or not correctly shaped, leaves or rubbish of any kind
may be carried to form a foundation for the nest proper. The

Mr. R. Philupps,
male will fly about with hay in his bill, but it is the female who
does the work, which with me has always occupied her parts of
three days ; and she alone sits on the eggs and young--period of
incubation 13, 13^, and 14 days in three cases of which I have
notes. The eggs are greenish blue ; I have never seen a spotted
egg, but it is said that they sometimes occur ; the number is
usually given as 4 or 5, but I fancy that the former is the more
common, though I am by no means sure. Nest-building here
has generally commenced 011 April 26 or 27, when there has been
no disturbance nor undue access of cold weather.
I have had three nests of young, and I find that the treat-
ment by different parents is not uniform on two important points,
although the circumstances in 1S99 a, &amp;apos;d 1909 to all outward
appearances were identical. I11 1899, the female alone fed the
young for the first few days ; this year both fed from the very
first day. Again, in 1S99, although I watched the female closely
when she flew up to the nest and momentarily paused on a perch
outside, I could never detect the presence of food either in bill
or pouch, and I formed the conclusion that she fed from the crop.
This year, from the very first, both male and female carried the
food conspicuously in the bill. I expect that some of these
details depend upon the health, strength, and disposition of
individual birds, and that they are not stereotyped.
As I have already inferred, this species, for a soft-bill, is
an easy one to breed. Some one will doubtless say, " Then why
didn't you breed it sooner?" To this I make answer, " Cats! "
Although generally almost exceptionally sharp and intelligent,
in the matter of cats the Pied Rock-Thrush is an a--s--s ! The
aviary here takes in the entire garden so that I, in the garden,
am confined with the birds to the inside, and am unable to get at
the outside to put up defences. The cats climb on to the wire-
netting roof from my neighbours' trees, and all I can do is to
bombard them with stones, as stealthily as may be, from upper
windows of the house. Instinct teaches this bird the erroneous
doctrine that the cat will attack from the ground, so it nests and
roosts at the highest available spot; all of the nesting-boxes and
many high roosting-places are carefully protected and absolutely
safe. But the Rock-Thrush roosts in the open, barely a foot

below the netting, so that he may watch for the enemy, who of
course goes straight for him, and off he dashes in the dark full tilt
against the wire sides of the aviary, cutting his face, creating a
panic, which is only too apt to spread to the sitting female and
cause her to leave the nest and disfigure herself in like manner.
In 1899, when the nestlings were some ten days old, the
female was frightened off her nest in the dark and couldn't or
was too scared to return to it--on the following night I found
some five cats rampaging on the top of the aviary. A bitterly
cold east wind was blowing, and the nestlings perished in the
cold.
I11 1900, the female was frightened from the nest when the
eggs were on the point of hatching and was afraid to return. I
then transferred the pair to the miscellaneous aviary, where
there was a very mixed company of doubtful character. To my
surprise they went to nest again, and, notwithstanding incessant
fighting with other birds, hatched out at least two youngsters.
When these were beginning to get their feathers, I found them
one morning in the birdroom, over eleven yards from the nest,
lying one on the top of the other, dead. Whether it was the parent
or some other bird that had carried them thither I know not.
In olden days, a German dealer in London used to let us
have birds of this species, often birds of the year, in perfect
Dlumage, before a feather had been marred. The British dealer
of to-day offers the bird for sale after the new flight and tail
feathers have been ruined ; so that we have to keep the imperfect
creature some ten months before it is in full plumage and fit to
be seen, and another eight months or so before the season comes
round and we can breed from it. This is what the British trades-
man calls "business" I suppose.
My present male, a tailless flightless creature, reached my
hands on September 24, 1906, and the female, a still more miser-
able specimen, on October 3, 1907, so that the latter, that is, the
pair, were not in breeding condition until this spring: comment
is superfluous.
They were transferred to the reserved aviary on April ir,
built a little, were stopped by the inclement weather, but settled
down to work in May. But on the night of May 12--13 this was

stopped by a raid of cats ; the cut faces of both birds were an
eyesore all through the subsequent breeding period.
On May 19, the female recommenced building, this time in
a box that was partially hidden by the top of a lime tree, the
shelter of which, continuously on the increase, must have given
a sense of security to the sitting bird. For myself, I was a little
vicious, and hurled heavy missiles at the invaders during the
quiet of the nights and early mornings, one of which, as good
fortune would have it, lighting on the head of a large nail in a
long sheltering board, not only produced a loud reverberating
report but so respectable a flash of fire that the place, at a feline
council especially convened to consider the matter, was declared
by common consent to be an unhealthy one for cats, and was
abandoned for two or three weeks.
As usual, the female took parts of three days, 19--21, to
construct the nest ; and she commenced to sit on the morning of
the 26th.
On the evening of June 7, I took out mealworms to test
the birds, but there was no response. O11 the following morning,
about 9.45, I again appeared with mealworms, and was immediate-
ly assailed by the excited parents. The female frantically seized
a mealworm, crunched it up, then a second, a third, a fourth,
crunching up each in succession, and then flew off with the
four to the nest; again and again she returned to the meal-
worms, crunching them up and carrying them as before, but not
swallowing one. After the hurry and scurry caused by my
tardy arrival had subsided, and the birds had settled down to
their work, only one mealworm was carried at a time; and it
was always held conspicuously in the bill, both by the male and
by the female--there was nothing whatever to indicate feeding
from the crop : the crunched mealworms were carried up as they
were from the very first. Cockroaches, duly prepared, were
likewise held openly in the bill.
As is customary, the parents were unwilling to carry small
insects to their young; but after a little the female relaxed and
took small things, and these she conveyed in the pouch of the
throat ; artificial food she carried in the same wajr.
At the first, the male betrayed hesitancy and uncertainty

about visiting tlie uest, but be soon joined in ; for a day or so,
the female resented the intrusion ; and if she had shewn firmness
and decision like her predecessor of 1899 I think she would have
carried the day ; but a second class bird she was when received,
and a second class bird she remains, and she had to give in--to
her own undoing as will be seen later; he was altogether too
masterful for her.
The devotion of the male to the young, both as feeder and
nurse, was pretty to behold but ill-timed and ill-directed. We
want our mothers to look after their bairns themselves and not to
betray the trust reposed in them ; and little by little this mother
gave up work and the father took sole charge. This was unfor-
tunate, for the mother quickly realised the danger of a mealworm
diet and would carry other things, but the male would feed the
young on nothing but mealworms.
As I have already said, they usually carried but one meal-
worm at a time. On June 27, the female brought four mealworms
to a fledgeling who was on the path in the front. She " pecked "
at its gaping mouth with caution, so that it might not grab them
all at once. At the first peck, the youngster obtained one ; the
second was a miss ; at the third, one of the worms fell to the
ground; then came another miss, and at the next two were
grabbed and bolted; and lastly the dropped mealworm was
picked up and duly delivered. A little later, I saw the male
acting in a similar way.
Previous to the hatching of the young birds, the parents
had been mute, but on and from their introduction into the world
the male recommenced to warble. I also noticed that, as the
1899 male had done, he began carrying hay to another box, and
before long there was some flirting and pursuing--but of that
anon.
On the evening of the 20th I felt in the nest-box, and
found four nestlings settled down for the night. There was no
semblance of a nest--it had been trampled into a platform of hay.
The four nestlings were arranged in pairs, with a little space
between each, two facing to the front and two the back of the
box ; they were then all alive.
On the 24th, one was out; on the 25th, a second appeared ;

the dead bodies of the other two were picked up later. Of the
latter, one must have died in the nest, unless it had been carried
out prematurely. The other was much better feathered, and may
have perished after it had left the nest from the cold and wet; and
this is the more probable as it seems to have come down into
some wheat-grass a foot high just before a prolonged downpour
of thunder rain ; could it but have reached the path it might have
been all right, if we may judge by the survivors who were so
strong on their legs.
At first it was the custom of the young to squat, face up, on
bare ground, from which they were not readily distinguishable;
a thousand persons might have passed close by without observing
them.
The elder bird, a supposed male, was on the wing on the
26th, went to roost on a perch 011 the 28th, and took to the trees
on the 30th. The other, a very secretive creature, perhaps a
female, was first seen to fly on the 30th. Both love to lie on the
corrugated iron roof of a low shed, as it were on a warm rock,
basking in the sun. Both have taken to the trees ; an adult bird
of this species has never been seen in a tree here; do these
youngsters, reared amidst trees, intend to develop into tree-
lovers?
Books tell us that the Pied Rock-Thrush often rears two
broods in the year. As on former occasions, as soon as the young
were hatched the male commenced to prepare another box for
breeding, which the female often visited and seemed to accept.
At one time I thought she must be laying a second clutch, and
was not surprised that she should be leaving so much of the
feeding of the young to the male. But the pursuit of the female
by the male became more and more savage, and at length I could
not hide from myself that he was hunting her viciously with
intent to murder, and at last, on July 3, with much reluctance, I
transferred her to the adjoining aviary.
We need not go far to seek for the cause of this change of
face. That the birds had arranged for a second brood is clear ;
but time had not been standing still, and the season of moult was
at hand. Moreover, my notes tell me that the pairs break up
pretty soon after this. The female fell into moult rather earlier

than the male and cried "off," which irritated the latter; and
was he not the self-constitnted guardian of the young? She was
now a stranger, and must not be allowed to remain in their
vicinity and must go, and if she won't go she must die. It was
but a modification of a principle not rare amongst birds.
Although he no longer feeds them, the male still plays the
part of Defender of the Fledgelings, and is constantly bristling
up to the front of the aviary and breathing out threatenings and
slaughter through the wire against the female who, sitting but a
few inches distant, casts longing eyes towards her offspring, for
her maternal instincts would seem to be far from dormant--and
thus we must leave them.

Not much can be said as yet of this decidedly interesting
bird, of which I possessed a specimen, now to be seen in the
New Bird House at the London Zoological Gardens, where it
is, I fancy, new to the collection.
His native home, or at any rate, one of them, is California,
and he is credited with sweet elarionette-like notes. I believe
he is called the clarionette bird by the German ornithologists.
In size about that of a lark, perhaps somewhat smaller
(comparisons are difficult), with the broad head, short bill and
tarsi of the typical Flycatchers. The tail is longisli. His
general colour is a rich soft grey, with a gleam of white in the
wings, and a ring of the same encircling the eyes.
In a cage he is inclined, poor fellow, to sit still for many
half hours at a time, because I suppose that if he were at liberty
he would fly forth from his perch, catch an insect, and return
again. Flycatchers are not hoppers--they dart forth and they
glide, so that really our friend from California should not be
caged, but placed in a large aviary where his darting and gliding
powers may be enjoyed.
This Flycatcher--"Solitaire" they call him in his native
land--is not difficult to keep, being a great fruit-eater, and fruit

nowadays is as easy to obtain as canary seed, besides which, he
can do on good, insectivorous food. With me he became very
tame, and would eagerly seize a morsel of grape from my fingers.
When let out in the bird-room, he would pounce down--
hawk-like--upon a mealworm or cockroach, carry it up to his
watching-post, knock it well on the head against his perch, and
swallow it.
When he first came into my possession, his plumage was
decidedly " shantantery " (I think that describes it) but he
moulted splendidly, and being one who loves his matutinal dip,
was sleek and shiny, but the feathers are very soft and with
handling would easily be dislodged.
Sometimes--only sometimes--he sang, but I do not. suppose
that he ever sang his loudest and fullest. The notes were sweet,
very sweet, what few there were, but probably even when he
sings his best in his native land, they do not equal in brillaucy

(Spermestes nigriceps).
By W. E. Teschemaker, B.A.
The first young bird successfully reared in my aviaries this
season was a Cape Dove and, after taking two seasons to breed
this species and having at last succeeded, I was unlucky to come
across by pure chance an instance of its having been bred once
before. This was in April. In the first week of May two S.
nigriceps left the nest. I quite think that I bred this species in
May, 1907, at which date I saw a fine young bird flying, but it
was not independent. I was then laid up by an illness and, two
months later, when I looked for it, it could not be found.

322 On the Nesting of the Rufous-backed Mannikin.
Early in 1907 a small consignment of this species reached
this country and were sold for rather a high figure. I have
since, however, seen it stated that years ago it used to be
regularly imported and sold for a few shillings a pair. There
seems to have been a sort of " Golden Age" of aviculture when
rare and interesting species could be picked up quite cheaply in
the Loudon bird-shops. It must certainly have been long before
my time for, goodness knows, it is difficult enough now to come
across anything of any interest at a moderate price or indeed at
any price. The Rufous-backed Mannikin appears to be quite
well known to the Kaffir " boys," by whom it is called the
" Zanzibar fret," to distinguish it from the Bronze Mannikin or
"fret," and there is no reason why it should not be imported in
numbers.
In 190S I had one male and two females, but for some
obscure reason I had 110 eggs from them. Early this year Mr.
Hamlyn imported over a score, from which I selected another
male, and this summer I have had several nests and altogether
seven young, all of which are now doing well.
The eggs are pure white and as small as those of some
species of Humming-birds. One now in my cabinet measures
*50 by *31. The young when they leave the nest are dull brown
on the back and greyish on the breast, merging into dirty white
on the abdomen, beak almost black. I have before now called
attention in our Magazine to the startling changes of colour that
some of the Mannikins undergo during the three or four weeks
subsequent to leaving the nest, and one could hardly find a
better instance than S. nigriceps. The adult is bright rufous 011
the back, black 011 head and throat, pure white on chest and
abdomen, flank feathers black tipped with white, primaries
speckled with white. It will thus be seen that the young bird
has to accomplish a complete moult or change of colour of every
feather--and this is done in the short space of one month !
I made the following notes of one particular bird:--
July 8. " Left nest.
,, 19. "Almost white on abdomen and under tail coverts.
,, 24. " Has all throat black, with clearly marked margin,
and some black feathers 011 crown.

It is curious that Mr. Hatnlyn had several individuals in
immature plumage which seemed to change quite slowly, but I
take it that in their case the moult had been arrested by the
change of climate.
Unfortunately I have not at the moment completed my
notes on the change of colour. The fact is I have had several
species nesting this season which have occupied every moment
of my spare time and I have not been able to give the less
interesting species the attention they deserve. All that I can
definitely say is that the feathers of the head and throat are com-
pletely shed and replaced, and that the flank feathers can be seen
coming down. I have now brought a later brood into the house
to see how the change of colour of the back, abdomen, aud es-
pecially of the primaries is accomplished. When the adults go
out of colour I have noticed that the white tips of the flank
feathers are broken or worn off, so that the sides of the breast
are at this period completely black.
Altogether this little species is quite an interesting one,
and its changes of plumage are well worthy of careful study.

By Hubert D. Astlry, F.Z.S., M.B.O.U.
Certainly there are grievous disappointments in aviculture,
and they have to be borne philosophically, otherwise one would
be a burden to oneself and to others!
In the early days of July, in spite of the wretchedly cold
and wet weather, my pair 6f Magpie Tanagers commenced to
build a nest in the small aviary where they are. On the exposed
summit of a box bush it was placed, and was composed of heather-
twigs as a foundation, with an addition of dead leaves and fresh
bamboo leaves, and finally lined with hay. On the 14th and the
16th of July respectively, two eggs were laid. These eggs were

324 On the Nesting of the Magpie Tanager ,
very handsome, of the size of a Hawfinch's, in colour a deep
cream, thickly spotted with rufous brown, a broad zone of the
same around the larger end. They were long in shape.
O11 the 30th of July one young one was hatched, the other
egg, which disappeared two days afterwards, having failed to
hatch. The young bird was fed upon banana and grapes, and
throve for four days. Then it completely disappeared! and a
medal with it!! for I do not think that these Tanagers have
ever been known to breed in captivity in Europe. Their nesting
was extremely unexpected, for I had only possessed them about
three weeks, and they were very shy at first, and even now are
anything but tame.
I11 the same aviary were two of my beautiful little North
American Hermit Thrushes, a hen Blue Bird, and a Gardener
Bower Bird, as well as a pair of Malayan Fairy Blue Birds--a
collection of rarities.
When the poor little Blue Bird (American) was found dead
with her head knocked in, I suspected the Tanagers, which were
then commencing to nest. For one thing they look savage, with
their clear and brilliantly yellow eyes. When a few days after-
wards I found both the Hermit Thrushes dead and mangled, I
was in despair. All had been peace hitherto.
The Fairy Blue Birds (Ire?ia cyanea ) kept in the roosting-
house, and no one seemed to pay them any attention. Then one
morning the female was found with her neck all but dislocated,
and unable to hold her head up, so that she had to be fed by
hand for at least three weeks : and her mate was removed.
There remained only the pair of the Magpie Tanagers and
the Gardener Bower Bird ( Amblyornis stibalaris ). This individual
generally made its appearance only in the early morning and
evening, sitting during most of the day in the roosting-house,
concealed amongst the branches of Scotch fir. On the fifth day
of the young Magpie Tanager's existence I looked into the nest
to see how its inmate was progressing, and behold the house was
empty ! ! If the culprit was not a mouse, it was the Gardener
Bower Bird. That individual has been removed, and it is to be
hoped the Magpie Tanagers will again nest before the cold
autumn days are with us.

These Tanagers are very fine showy birds of the size of a
lark, with long tails. Their general colouring may be roughly
compared with that of a Magpie, and the gloss on their heads and
neck is most beautiful, with the gleaming yellow eyes showing
conspicuously against the blue-black of the surrounding feathers.
It is a rare thing to obtain a true pair, so that it is much to be
hoped their next efforts at reproducing their kind will be suc-
cessful. It would in part atone for the anxiety one has gone
through, and the losses one has suffered.

By Dr. A. G. Butler.
As we understand it, I believe birds are wholly deficient
in moral sense: they murder one another for the pure joy of
showing their power; and the screams of their victims, I verily
believe, give them pleasure ; they are utterly reckless as regards
the choice of mates, with one exception ; and that, so far as my
experience has shown me, is a peculiarity confined to the female
sex. At the same time, as is well known, many birds mate for
life and are faithful to their partners.
Touching the choice of mates, a male bird will often
voluntarily ignore the presence of females of his own species,
and select a partner belonging to another species: it is owing
to this fact that one sometimes meets with wild hybrids such as
those between the Linnet and Greenfinch, which are not rare ;
and it is well-known that most of the hybrids produced in
aviaries between foreign finches are the result of voluntary
selection on the part of the parents. When two species are
put together, with a view to breeding hybrids, in a large flight-
cage, the result is usually a disappointment. I know, because I
have tried it repeatedly and have hardly ever been successful
excepting when the depraved domesticated Canary has been the
mother.
When no examples of the same species are present, male
birds will sometimes attempt to mate with hens of different
families and even orders, as I pointed out many years ago in the
case of a Rosella Parrakeet which tried most earnestly to win

Dr. A. G. Butler,
the affections of a hen Red-crested Cardinal; and of a Passerine
Dove, which so tormented a hen Zebra-finch with his attentions
that I had to remove it to an aviary, where it immediately trans-
ferred its affections to a hen Bronze-winged Pigeon, to which it
has remained constant to the present day ; lastly a cock Grenadier
Weaver has, for two years, paid constant court to a cock Senegal
Dove, evidently not discerning its sex.
But, whereas male birds are totally deficient in selective
sense and seem to care very little what mate they secure, so long
as they are not doomed to a celibate life, female birds undoubtedly
exercise choice and refuse to accept husbands which are un-
pleasing to them. Nor is it only in birds that one may observe
the process of selection in relation to sex, for with the common
white Cabbage Butterfly (Ganoris rupee) I have seen a female
refuse four males in succession and at once accept the fifth ;
proving that the assumption that insects (let alone birds) are
not intelligent enough to have any choice in the selection of
mates is a fallacy. The disputes over hen Sparrows and the
choice by the hen of a favoured mate may be witnessed by any-
one possessing a garden, every spring; nor is the chosen one
always the most brightly coloured, so that it may be that, in this
species, the most courageous suitor is selected.
In domesticated birds like the Canary, I believe it is
possible to pair up males and females as one pleases, and (with a
few exceptions), what man selects the birds accept; but with
species as occurring in nature this appears not to be the case.
Doubtless it is the rule, where no adverse influence intervenes
to check the tendenc}&amp;apos;, for brothers and sisters to mate ; and I
have noticed, as probably others have done, that since the
enforcement of the Wild Birds Protection Acts there has been
a considerable increase in the number of wild pied and albino
birds, as a natural result of the uninterrupted inbreeding which
must have followed, where whole families have been preserved to
carry on the species. Such wholesale protection must eventually
interfere materially with the productiveness of our native birds ;
for it must be borne in mind that predatory birds have been
thinned out by game-preservers and poultry-farmers to such an
extent that their influence in breaking up families of youngsters

has become insignificant; nor does the domestic cat have much
effect in checking the inbreeding of birds from the same nest,
for when she discovers a nest of young birds she kills the whole
of them, but rarely eats any.
Now although, as I have said already, male birds are per-
fectly willing to accept any female as a wife, no matter what
relationship she may bear to them, I have had strong evidence in
the past few years that the hens are by no means so complacent,
and that a mother resents all amatory advances by her son, as also
a daughter does from her father. In February 1906 I purchased
what looked like a very fine pair of Red-headed Gouldian
Finches, both sexes with the scarlet extending over the crown,
lores, cheeks, and ear-coverts, and I hoped to have bred from
this pair a fine family of Poephila mirabilis. I was not then
aware that the hen only attains to the colouring of the cock, as
regards the amount of red on the face, in old age. Both were
old birds and, though in excellent health up to the daj^ before
their death, the hen died on May 2nd and the cock two days
later. I therefore had to breed with a hen P. mirabilis which in
1905 had shown just a trace of red on the head, but which had
produced a male youngster with the full colouring of the Red-
headed variety ; she had a little more red on her face in 1906,
and still more in 1907, when the Black-headed husband was
foolish enough to break his wing and die. I11 1908, when the
amount of red on the head of the female was quite respectable,
it occurred to me to see whether she would breed with the son
born in 1905 ; I therefore turned them out together. However
whenever the male bird attempted any flirtation with his mother,
she flew at him, pecked him viciously and chased him to the
other end of the aviary : I kept them outside until after the
commencement of the early frosts, but without result, and the
hen died in January 1909.
In 1905 I bred one female hybrid between the Grey-winged *
Ouzel and hen English Blackbird, and this bird (together with
one of the cocks bred in 1906) I retained. In 1909 I thought I
would see whether, by pairing up this female with her father, I
could get young reverting to Morula boulboul. I gave them a
small aviary to themselves, hung up a large nest-box in one

corner, and, when I saw the cock bird carrying hay into the box
and the hen sufficiently interested to go up and inspect his work,
I thought I was in a fair way to attain success. I soon discovered,
as Morula boulboul did, that the hen was only laughing at us;
for no sooner did her father attempt to chase her, than she stood
her ground and brought him to a sense of his wrong-doing : she
would not even let him feed until she was satisfied, and it was
only at the middle of July that he recovered sufficient courage
to defend himself. I came down one morning and found th._
aviary a perfect litter of feathers, and it was easy to see that the
hen was the sufferer : he has vindicated his position as parent
and with that he now seems content.
In 1908 I bred two Diamond Doves, of which only one
lived and that a male. When in 1909 I caught up my examples
of this species in order to turn out a pair for breeding, I selected
the larger male, under the impression that it was sure to be the
father, and I turned it out with the hen. From the first she
attacked this male whenever he began to coo to her, pulling out
his feathers wholesale. However, as is usually the case when
two Doves are kept together (even when both are hens) she laid,
and he sat so steadily that for some time I thought he was dead ;
the eggs, however, were of course not fertile, and eventually
he came off and recommenced his pursuit of the hen. She was
more furious than ever and persecuted him so persistently that I
was not surprised when, one morning,. I found him dead on the
floor of the aviary. His coo was very weak compared with that
of the other male bird, and I do not doubt that I inadvertently
paired up mother and son with disastrous results.
Touching the question of vieum and tuum we all know
that birds have no conscience ; they rob one another whenever
the chance offers, and believe to the full in the doctrine of the
survival of the fittest. They do, however, sometimes seem to be
^ compassionate towards young birds left orphans, for I have
known a Robin to help to rear young Thrushes when a cat had
killed her own young and one of the parent Thrushes had been
shot; yet it is probable that this was only a way in which the
arrested feeding-fever was working itself out, and no more credit-
able than is the love of female children for dolls.

If, therefore, there is any moral sense in birds, it would
seem to be limited to the female sex, and as a guard against
pairing between parent and child : however, as I have only three
instances to bring forward as evidence, it cannot be assumed that
this is a general law among cage-birds until many more proofs
have been brought to light. In the case of fanciers' birds--
Canaries, poultry, pigeons, and even Barbary Doves, I have little
doubt that all moral sense is lacking, owing to man's constant
supervision, high feeding, and other things which encourage an
unnatural condition ; all experiments, therefore should be con-
ducted with birds which retain their wild character and have
not been long under man's care.

The most notable additions to the collection during the
past month, as far as size and imposing appearance go, are a fine
pair of Goliath Herons ( Ardea goliath )--a species which has only
once before been in the collection, though this identical pair are
actually captive-bred, from parents kept in the Amsterdam Zoo-
logical Gardens. This species, which is African, is the largest
of the herons, and the Zoo specimens look about twice as large
as the common herons which are also in the Gulls' aviary, where
the new comers have been placed. In colour this species more
resembles the Purple Heron ( A. purpurea&amp;apos;) than the common
heron, having much of a vinous maroon hue on the neck and
underparts.
Mr. A. Pam has presented a fine consignment of birds
from Venezuela, including a specimen of the curious Helmeted
Curassow ( Pauxis galeata) which is remarkable for having a blue
excrescence, much like an oval blue pebble, on its red bill. It
has been in the collection before, but not often.
A novelty in this Venezuelan collection is the Rustic
Tyrant ( Elainea pagajia ), a very humble-looking little olive-
brown bird with two light markings on the wings, much like the
colouring of our hen Chaffinch, but of interest as representing a
very widely-spread and numerous American group, the members

of which are but very rarely imported, though the large Sulphury
Tyrant used to be fairly common, and some of this species have
come into the trade again of late.
Another is the Grey-backed Ouzel (Merula carbonaria),
which resembles a small blackbird with a grey back and the legs
yellow as well as the bill.
Mr. W. Frost has returned from the Aru Islands, with 50
Greater Birds of Paradise (.Paradisea apoda) collected, with other
specimens, for Sir William Ingram. These have remained at
Southampton, as it is intended to send them to Sir William's
estates in Trinidad for liberation, but two fine males, an adult
and a young bird, are on deposit at Regent's Park, together with
the rest of the collection, which includes some very good things.
Especially notable is a Flame - breasted Flower - pecker
(.Dicaeum ignicolle ) from Aru, a minute creature, blue black above
and cream-coloured below, with a wash of orange-red on the
breast. This species is new to the collection, as also appear to
be two Honey-eaters as yet undetermined. Another charming
novelty is a tiny Fruit Pigeon, the Eilac-crowned (Ptilopus
coronulatus), not larger than a Thrush, and having green for its
prevailing colour.

it also loses the red in captivity in India, as our bird does here.

Yellow-throated Sparrow. Gymnorhis flavicollis.
Oates says about the bird that " its affinities for the
Sparrows are not very great." I have only studied it in captivity,
but from what I saw of it I should call it a most obvious
Sparrow.
Tree-Sparrow. Passer montanus.
This bird takes the place of the House-Sparrow in
Darjeeling ; in Mussoorie I found no Sparrows at all, though the
House-Mynah ( Acridotheres tristis ) was there.
Large Pied Wagtail. Motacilla maderaspatensis.
This is given in the " Fauna " as a permanent resident
throughout India, I only once saw one at Calcutta, in winter.
Grey Wagtail. Motacilla melanope.
A specimen with the two inner tertiaries white, forming a
V when the wings were closed, appeared in the Indian Museum
grounds for at least three winters consecutively. On February
16th, 1902, I saw a similar one by the Rhinoceros tank in the
Calcutta Zoo ; I had previously seen what I took to be the
original bird by the Museum poud.
Crested Lark. Galerita cristata.
Oates gives the bill of this bird as yellowish ; I have
found it horny blue. Specimens I bought were much infested
with ticks, though I never found these vermin on any other
birds.
Fulvous-breasted Pied Woodpecker. Dendrocopus macii.
Some nestlings I kept were plantigrade, and readily ran
backwards ; they had a warty pad on the hocks. They were very
tame.
Golden-backed Woodpecker. Brachyptemus aurantius.
The young of this bird, like the last, are plantigrade, with
a warty heel-pad. The barbs on the horny tip of the tongue are
not developed by the time the feathers are showing. These
young have the white underparts tinged with yellow, and the
feet leaden blue, not dark green as Blanford gives them, pre-
sumably for the adult. Young females, as Blanford says,
usually want the white spots on the forehead, this being plain
black ; but in July, 1906, I got one which had the spots--another

to rear and very tameable, but very pugnacious at times with
each other. The fourth toe is reversible, and will come sideways
or even forwards when the bird is climbing ; I have noted this
also in other Woodpeckers.
Beue-THROATED Barbet. Cyanops asiatica.
The young of this species begin to call while yet nest-
lings ; the throat swells when they are calling, and the call,
as I have observed in these young birds, is kept up for hours.
The young fight much with each other, but adults are the least
quarrelsome of all Indian Barbets I have seen.
Crimson-breasted Barbet. Xantholaema haematocephala.
The young want the black on the head as well as the
crimson. They have the bill pale at base, orbital skin livid
fleshy instead of red, and legs also dull fleshy. One I kept began
calling before the tail was full grown. I have reared both this
species and the last on banana only.
Correction. --I see in my last month's notes that I gave
the date of my meeting with a specimen of the Claret Finch as
1892 ; it should be 1902.

THE ORANGE-HEADED GROUND THRUSH (GEOCICHLA

Sir,--I n answer to Miss Hawke's enquiry, it seems to me that these
Thrushes are very fairly hardy when once acclimatized. A pair lived
in one of my aviaries all through last winter, and remained a great deal
out of doors, although by flying through the open window into the
roosting-house, where there are hot pipes, they could find a warmer
temperature. Of course they require plenty of shelter in the shape of
fir-branches, or living shrubs, etc. They are most beautiful songsters.
They require a good insectivorous food, and are all the better for
tit-bits in the way of fruit, cockroaches, etc. They are very fond of
cut-up grapes.
Timid at first, they gradually quiet down and finall}&amp;apos; become quite
bold, as can be seen in the specimens in the Western Avaries at the London
Zoological Gardens.
I have two true pairs and an odd male. The hens are not so easy
to obtain. HUBERT D. ASTLEY.
SEESEE PARTRIDGES.
Sir, --In your last issue Mr. Ogilvie-Grant calls in question some
remarks of mine re the Egyptian form of Hey's Partridge.
For the benefit of other systematists, who may be working on the
group, the facts are these:
A. cholmleyi, which was described from near Suakim, differs from
A. heyi in lacking the white forehead and lores and in being much darker
on the head, mantle and breast.
Specimens from the Mokattam Hills, near Cairo, resemble A.
ehohnleyi in the absence of the white on the forehead and lores, but in other
respects they are indistinguishable from A. heyi. A careful examination of
\ series of the latter from Palestine and Arabia shows the amount of
\0x25A0Hie white to be variable, and in one specimen from Palestine the white
yas entirely absent and this specimen was indistinguishable from Cairo
xamples.
Under these circumstances there is no alternative but to consider
specimens from the Mokattam Hills as A. heyi, with which they agree in
general colour and more nearly approach geographically.

Sir, --At the third attempt I have succeeded in rearing two young
Grey-wings to maturity. The Zoo. have also succeeded in rearing two
young of this species at the second attempt, which however flew two days
later than my brood. It may be of interest if I note one or two details:
ist Attempt: A typical nest of mud and bents was constructed on a
shelf in the inner compartment of their aviary. This nest was fully
completed but not used ; a second nest was constructed, not anything
like so substantial as the first, in a parrakeet nest-box--three young
were hatched out, one was thrown out when three days old, the
second lived to age of ten days, the third died two days later.
Though they had access to soft food, milk sop, ripe fruit in variety
and adlib., and meat and preserved egg were also supplied, they would
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.843391" page_id="32659992"  page_num="334" year="" vol="">
take none. They only fed with live food--though eating heartily
of fruit and soft food, they refused to feed with same.
2nd Attempt : Similar to above, nest was constructed in a box hung up
for Cardinals, two young were hatched out, but were deserted at the
age of ten days. . . .
My business engagements were such at the time, that I could not be
at hand every hour to supply live food--had they got some live food every
hour they may very probably have supplemented this with artificial food
and success have been obtained. In an aviary containing a mixed series,
an unlimited supply of live food is a practical impossibility.
3rd Attempt : The nest used for the second attempt was repaired, a

<bodyText confidence="0.968245444444444" page_id="32659992"  page_num="334" year="" vol="">
clutch of three eggs laid, of which they hatched out two ; I made
provision for them to have a supply of live food every hour and there
was no check ; the young left the nest when seventeen days old and
are now independent. They were reared on earthworms, mealworms,
shelled snails, and any beetles, spiders, caterpillars, etc., that the
garden produced.
I have noted the following :
The young do not resemble the adult female.
The sexes can be distinguished in the nestling plumage.
This is the first time this species has been bred in this country.

SEXUAL SELECTION IN BIRDS.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998177380952381" page_id="32659995"  page_num="335" year="" vol="">
Sir,--M r. Pocock's interesting article in our August number prompts
me to offer a few remarks in answer, or in supplement. There should be
no difficulty in reconciling Darwin's theory--that ornaments in male birds
have become developed through selection by the females--with the generally
observed indifference the female shows to the courtship display of the male.
Darwin's theory need not and cannot be taken as the only and final ex-
planation of ornamental development. Otherwise, one might ask, has no
selection been allowed the males, and is the uniformly sober garb of the
hens the expression of the male taste in mating? The necessity of being
beautiful and the striving towards beauty which all facts in Nature underlie
is nowhere more marked than in the form and colour of birds.
" If eyes were made for seeing,
Then beauty is its own excuse for being."
Female preference would seem only an assistant factor, not the
primary cause, of the end in view; other causes act and react. The most
beautiful males are probably also the most vigorous; hence the most likely
to drive off rivals and to emphasize their points on their progeny in the
long run.
The objection that sometimes a more beautiful male is observed to be
rejected in favour of a less beautiful one, might be met by the reminder
that the brightest coloured individuals of a species are invariably old males,
which conceivably might not always be the most tireless in the strenuous
competition for the hens, and so may, on occasion, get left behind. This
would be the rule-proving exception.
It seems more than probable that the indifference of the hens to the
display of the cocks is only a seeming one--Mr. Pocock admits the possi-
bility of this. Beyond the fact that throughout the animal kingdom, in the
drama of pairing, an active role is assigned the male, a passive role the
female, there is another premiss, namely, that the former's part is essentially
objective, the latter's subjective. Allow for female coyness, another natural
phenomenon, and the indifference becomes transparent.
Will not Mr. Pocock's difficulty, that birds as well as mammals have
their likes and dislikes in the matter of mating, vanish before a statement
of the great natural law, that like will draw to like?
With reference to the occasional display of a male when no hens are
about, is this more remarkable than that song birds should habitually sing
when alone ? It may be a rehearsal; it may be a challenge to a rival; it
may be a spontaneous expression of the bird's pent-up feelings.
All birds pose, during courtship, whether the sexes are alike or not.
Who has not smiled at the amorous cock sparrow (and been reminded of
gestures sometimes witnessed in human society) with his grotesque hopping
and chirping and wing-trailing and tail-cocking around his fair one ? A

starling never sings without displaying or posing, and he sings at any time
of year. The soaring of the skylark or tree pipit is a display, and not one
made exclusively in wooing; but instead of being a grotesque, it is a
graceful display, like the aerial gyrations of the diurnal raptores, and of
storks and others. G. A. Momber.

Trachyphonus cafer.
By Major B. R. Horsbrugh.
This fine Barbet is common in the Rustenburg district of
the Transvaal. I have only been in Rustenburg a few times,
and then had no time for ornithology, and consequently saw this
species but once. Residents, however, told me it was abundant
at certain seasons, especially when the grapes were ripe and that
it was most destructive to fruit crops, and this I can well believe,
as it is both large and greedy.
It has been recorded from Natal, Rydenburg, Bechuanaland,
Rhodesia and Portuguese East Africa.
According to Shelley, this genus contains four species,
but the present is the sole S. African representative, and a very
beautiful one it is.
There are two of these birds in the huge flying aviary in
Pretoria and I had often admired and coveted them, but in spite
of all enquiries I could never hear of any being offered for sale.
My joy was great, therefore, when, looking in at the window
of a small bird-dealer's in Johannesburg, I saw two young ones.
I went in and was promptly told that the two young Woodpeckers
--all Barbets are called Woodpeckers in S. Africa--were going
to be sent on approval to somebody living in the country ; but I
left the shop with them in a small cage. They had been hand-
reared by a Boer woman, and were dirty and thin and in wretched
plumage, which was not to be wondered at, as they had been fed

on rotten peaches only. A bath and a good feed of live locusts,
white ants and grapes made them look different birds. They
were fairly tame and would take an insect from the hand with a
stealthy, Jay-like action ; and as a rule, after insects, they burst into
their very loud and peculiar note, which sounded something like
a hollow rattle and something like an alarum clock. This was
the song of thanks or joy. They had another squeaking rattle
when they saw strange dogs, and especially when they saw their
hated enemy, Timothy the Suricate. Timothy, poor fellow,
never bothered his head about them except to steal their locusts
or mealworms if he got the chance, but as long as he was in sight
they kept up their squealing rattle.
They were perfectly easy to feed and keep, but I found
them dangerous in a mixed aviary, and when I put a Meyer's
Parrot in their large cage they would have killed him very
quickly had I not been watching. I fed them on white ants and
any living insects, fruit of all descriptions (they liked banana
best) and occasionally a little chopped cooked meat.
They are most susceptible to cold, and in winter I brought
them in at night, but all day they had the benefit of a sheltered
verandah and the warm South African sun. They always let one
know when they thought it time for bed b}&amp;apos; calling vigorously.
I had great difficulty in bringing them home, as they felt the
cold so much that I thought I should lose them. However, I
got them stowed in a room near the boilers as soon as we reached
Pas Palmas, and after that they did well; and as an electric bulb
was glowing permanently within a foot of their cage they fed
night and day. I have no aviaries and parted with one specimen
to Mr. Astley, and with the other to the Zoo, where it can be
seen in the Small Bird House next to an Indian Blue-throated
Barbet.
[This is, so far as I am aware, the first appearance of this species in
British aviculture.-- Rd.]

In 1902, when I took up my pen to write about this
\0x25A0species, it was accounted rare. In 1909, when I take up my pen
once more with a like purpose, it is accounted common ; thus
turns the avicultural wheel. But though it may now be moder-
ately common, and although it may be well known to many of
our readers, I have not yet seen an announcement of the success-
ful breeding in this country of the Blue-breasted Waxbill.
There are hindrances over here to the breeding of this
*charming little bird, to some of which I may refer.
At certain times or seasons, it may be easy to sex correctly
a couple of these Waxbills; at other times or seasons, it may be
quite as easy to sex them incorrectly. One cannot sex them by
their head, one cannot sex them by their tail ; one cannot sex
them by the shape of the beak, nor yet can one invariably sex
them by the depth of the blue in the plumage. One can some-
times sex them by the width of the light drab stripe down the
centre of the abdomen, but by no means always. One cannot be
sure that a male will play or sing even to his own particular
female, though one can generally be sure that if you give him
the wrong one when his favourite is within hail he will make
things unpleasant for the former, and thus lead you to suppose
that she too is a male. The size may often be a guide ; but a
first-class female may be a better bird than an ordinary male.
And it is not an uncommon circumstance for a solitary female
to sing. Altogether, this little Waxbill can be exceedingly
provoking in the matter of sex.
Having caught your hare, I mean your pair, you will find
that, do what you will, some of these birds will want to go to
nest in the winter or early spring, and, unless you take care, will
spoil themselves for successful breeding before the warm weather
sets in.

Mr. R. Phillipps,
And when you have your nest, and you have your eggs in
the nest, and you look for fertile eggs, and, behold, clear eggs.
Or it may be that you have your nest and your fertile eggs, and
your birds are sitting as tight as wax, and you look for chicks,
and you have your chicks--dead chicks in the shell. I think
that our cold climate and dry east winds have much to do with
the failure in these cases.
And when your birds are placed in the natural garden
aviary, they will nest in the open, in some bushy tree top from
preference; and the rains descend and the winds blow--and you
are more likely to decrease than to multiply the number of your
Blue-breasted Waxbills.
And when all is progressing favourably, and you have as
nice a brood of nestlings as ever were hatched--then comes the
most unkindest cut of all. But here I had better quote Stark,,
lest I speak unadvisedly with my lips:--"Although the adults
appear to subsist entirely on grass-seeds, the young, before they
leave the nest, are fed on small grubs and insects ." The italics are
mine; if Stark had ever had to rear a brood, he would have
used capitals! ! !
I began life last winter season with five Blue-breasted
Waxbills. Of these, two paired up in mid-November ; and all
through the winter they were a nuisance. If separated, they
moped and pined away as if they would die; if placed together,,
even in a flight cage with several other birds, they plucked one
another's heads and necks bare. These were Jacob and his be-
loved Rachel. Of the others, two appeared to be males, and
looked as clear-cut rakish-looking knaves as ever entered a bird-
cage ;. while No. 5, a Reah-like female, despised by the others,,
was left to herself.
Picking out one of the Rakes, I placed him in a small cage
with L,eah ; but he treated her with contumely, to which he added
personal insult and affliction ; so I removed Real], and placed the
two Rakes together.
Over and over again I closely examined these two birds,
and there was not a pin to choose between them. They seemed
to be exactly alike in every line, in eveiy contour, in every hue,
in every feather ; I doubt if any human eye could have detected

on Breeding of the Blue-breasted Waxbill.
a difference at that time. They never kissed, nor cuddled, nor
danced, nor quarrelled--but one did occasionally sing, and that
was important. They were perfectly quiet and self-contained,
and never let themselves go nor gave themselves away. They
were like two experienced runners who were waiting on, and
biding their time, knowing that their turn would come in due
course. But I had too many small cages to attend to, and was
pressed for room, so set them free in the birdroom : whatever the
sex, they were splendid birds.
Judging that the half-naked pair could not possibly nest
before the summer, and that they would come into condition with
better results if allowed liberty, during March the others were
turned loose ; and so it came about that April found the five
Blue-breasted Waxbills flying in the birdroom and in the adjoining
garden aviary.
It had always been my custom, as soon as the season came
round, to chuck these Waxbills into the reserved aviary, and
to leave them to sort themselves out as they might prefer ; it
seemed to be folly to expect such timid delicate creatures to
breed in such a treeless arid desert as the general aviary, with
its doubtful company; for "They prefer localities which are
partly open, partly overgrown with scrub or low trees, and are
specially fond of scattered mimosa bushes " ; and " The nest is
invariably built in a bush." But success does not wait upon
carelessness ; and the results were incomplete. This year a pair
stole a march upon me and forced my hand, with results which
were eminently satisfactory to both parties.
It is one of the distinguishing marks of old age not only
to be garrulous with tongue or pen but to count heads when one
goes into the aviary ; and so I might have been seen, day after
day and many times a day, counting one , two, three , four -- one,
two, three, four, reminding one that there had been a time when
little sisters practised upon the schoolroom piano, one, two, three,
four -- one, two, three, four ; if I turned to the right, it was one, two,
three, four; and if I turned to the left it was still one, two, three,
four; whether in birdroom or aviary, in garden or house, it was
one, two, three, four -- o?ie, tzvo, three, four --I never could get
beyond the "four" when counting the Blue-breasted Waxbills ;

Mr. R. Philupps.
and it was with a sore heart that, on May n, I turned the four
survivors into the reserved aviary, for I cannot bear that a bird
should die. And this case was the more annoying&amp;apos; and uncom-
fortable as the missing Rake had appeared to be in perfect health,
and there did not seem to be any adequate cause for its departure.
While driving the Waxbills into the reserved aviary, I had
noticed in a sort of way that the lonely Rake was unwilling to go
and all the rest of the day it sat at the door pleading to be allowed
to return ; but that seemed to be not unnatural in the circum-
stances, and I thought little of it--some people are so dense !
Early on the following morning I heard the call of a Blue-
breasted Waxbill, and, on peeping out of my bedroom window,
was just in time to see the much lamented deceased give an
uneasy turn or two and disappear amongst some birch brooms:--
the missing bird was sitting, and I had separated the two birds !
After restoring the Rake to its mate, there remained three
in the reserved aviary; of these I have little to say, for the
foliage became very thick, and I could see but little of what was
going on.
Jacob was a deceiver as of old, and he threw over the dis-
figured Rachel and took up with Reah--and small blame to him,
for if damsels will make such Guys of themselves little wonder
if sensible people treat them as toys and turn elsewhere.
I have the simple note, under the date of the 28th May,,
that Jacob and Leah had a nest in such and such a place. This
spot had been specially prepared and arranged with the view of
enticing tree-loving birds to seek its shelter for nesting purposes,
so it was not by chance that the Blue-breasted Waxbills set up
housekeeping in this protected and well-favoured situation in
preference to their usual bush or tree-top. They commenced to
sit on May 31.
I have not another note respecting them until July 8;
nor, indeed, had I many thoughts for them, as the Pied Rock-
Thrushes and one or two other species were occupying my
attention at that time.
On July 8, desiring to look into some matter, I intruded
farther than usual into the inner recesses of the reserved aviary.
At the end, there is a large thickly branched lime bush-tree.

planted this spring, which had died before the leaf-buds had
unfolded; and hopping about the bare limbs of this tree was a
little fair-complexioned drab-coloured bird, whose short square
tail and awkward movements under my gaze proclaimed its
juvenility :--it was the first aviary-bred Bhie-breasted Waxbill!
As far as I was able to examine it, when viewed sideways,
not a speck of blue was to be seen except a little on the cheeks ;
when seen from the front, the throat and centre of the chest
were blue, but this colour did not extend far downwards to-
wards the abdomen. The tail seemed to be darkish washed with
blue. Beak black or blackish. It was about July 23 that this
fledgeling seemed to be rapidly assuming the plumage of the
"adult." It soon became much more blue; but the beak was
still black and the abdomen pale pinkish drab. As I write, this
fledgling, or bird of the year, a perfect bird, may still be dis-
tinguished from the adults by its smaller size, by the shade of
blue being less deep, by its darker tail, and by its exhibiting
generally considerably more of the drab-brown, which too is of a
lighter shade. I do not find that, at any age, the legs and feet
are black as stated in Stark's work ; they are of a slightly less
pale brown than in the adults--that is all.
And so here, as in the days of old, it was not the beautiful
Rachel who bore off the first prize but the despised Leah.
And now we must take up the story of the two Rakes.
In the aviary of mixed birds where we left them, no trees
can exist because of the rather large flock of Black-cheeked
Lovebirds. These irrepressible creatures do not, with me at any
rate, injure the other inmates of the aviary, but they are all over
the place, nothing restrains them, and they are a great hindrance
to the breeding of other species ; and for the latter I could do
little more in the spring than put up nesting-boxes, nail pieces
of wood across the entrance in the hopes of keeping the large
birds out, and hide them away as best I could.
The first nest of the Rakes, although not in a box, was in
a fairly safe place; but there were no signs of young, so I turned
the sitting-bird off and took the two eggs, each of which con-
tained a dead chick.
During a temporary change in the direction of the wind.

these birds built a second nest in a protected box facing due
east. The Lovebirds could not get in, but the east wind could,
and nothing came of it. I have so far not been able to examine
the nest. This is the first occasion with me that a Blue-breasted
Waxbill has built a nest in an artificial receptacle.
Some little time elapsed before they could agree upon
another site, but eventually they took possession of a well con-
cealed box which is perfectly sheltered from wind and rain. On
June 24 they were building, and they commenced to sit on the
27th or 28th, doubtless on or about the time of the laying of the
first egg. The young presumably commenced to hatch out on
July 13, as it was on that day that the male for the first time
became importunate, and demanded live insects with nearly as
much insistence as the Pied Rock-Thrushes had done five
weeks earlier.
Just about the same time, a pair of Cuba Finches (. Phoni-
para canora ) were nesting not far away. The positions of the
two nests were practically identical ; the birds were in the same
aviary, with the same enemies, and with access to the same food ;
both species are seed-eaters, if anything, the Blue-breasted Wax-
bill might be supposed to confine itself more strictly to a diet of
seed than the Cuba Finch. Some of the differences between the
two species while breeding were so marked as to be deserving of
being placed on record in the Avicultural Magazine.
All through the period of incubation, and during the first
few days of the lives of the nestlings, at almost any time that one
might chance to look into the aviary there would be seen usually
both of the old Cubas and assuredly only one of the Waxbills.
In past years, I had noticed the remarkable way in which strange
Cuba Finches would appear in the aviary quite unexpectedly,
springing from somewhere or nowhere without warning, and
Minerva-like bursting upon one fully feathered, and fluttering
about like moths, a trifle larger it may be but infinitely more
perky and self-assured ; so this year I especially watched the old
birds. The male was fond of collecting material--but only to
drop it; he was never seen to take it anywhere. Then I would
count heads--for the moment I might see only one, but, on look-
ing again, there they would be, both of them, quietly pecking

about the most innocent of all the innocents. They were so
very innocent that I strongly suspected them, especially when
the mother, flying repeatedly backwards and forwards to and fro
between the aperture and the nearest perch, would persist in
trying to persuade me that she had young in a particular box
which was yards away from the actual spot. And in the end they
diddled me so successfully, these tiny imps, that when the noise
proceeding from a certain place became more and more pro-
nounced I placed the brood to the credit of a pair of Yellow
Sparrows, and was not undeceived until the actual moment that
I beheld the.baby Cubas flitting about. As for the Blue-breasted
Waxbills, one bird absolutely disappears--two are never seen.
Both sit in turns until the young are hatched : you can never
detect them changing guard ; and then the female keeps mostly
to the nest, and the quiet unassuming male becomes a veritable
Nimrod--a mighty hunter after insects.
The Cuba Finches, in and out of the nest, are noisy little
mites, while the Blue-breasted Waxbills are usually mute; it is
not until they have been flying about for some days that they
begin to find their voices to any effect.
The Cubas seem to feed their young on seed alone ; at
least they have never come to me for insects, nor did they this
year take any interest in those which were supplied for the Wax-
bills. On the other hand, the Waxbills did all that birds could do
to obtain live insects, searching garden and birdroom, following
me about even into the house, and fighting birds treble their
size over the cockroach traps, tackling not only baby cockroaches
but insects as large as earwigs; the so-called live ants' eggs they
would take, but egg-flake and other insectivorous foods were
ignored. The parents continued to feed their young on insects,
when they could get them, for some time after they had left the
nest--for as long as they fed them at all in fact.
As evening approached, the Cubas hid away their young
in good time in a dark corner some 4 ft. from the ground and
retired to rest elsewhere. All of the Waxbills, young and old,
would swarm together in a heap at a late hour, in a lofty open
place which was fully exposed to the cold and wet. They were
wonderfully tame and confiding ; and one bitter evening I fetched

Mr. R. Phiixipps,
tlie "steps" and, gathering the chicks np in my hands, placed
them for the night in a snug retreat. Keeping as a rule to higher
perches and more in the open than the Cuba Finches, they felt
the cold much more; and I doubted if they could survive;
happily on August 4 there was a change in the weather, which
gave them a new lease of life.
But to take up the thread of my story.
On the morning of July 28th, with the help of a caudle,
I managed to look into the Waxbills' box. For a moment there
was a gleam of blue, but this vanished, and the box appeared to
be empty, the nest having been trampled down flat. A closer
scrutiny revealed certain light-brown grave-like mounds, scattered
about without any order; for the moment I hardly realised that
these were young birds, squatting about fully extended like
Thicknees on the bottom of the box: each was so tight that they
were evidently alive, so, having ascertained that there were five
of them, I quietly withdrew.
Having put down my caudle, etc., I re-entered the aviary,
and, looking up towards the nest, found that the eldest had come
out ; this was at 9.50. It was a fine little fellow, and shewed more
blue on leaving the nest than Leah's young one had done when
some weeks older. The blue patch on the side of the face was
well defined and extended boldly around and over the eye; that
on the chest did not go downwards but swept round along the
sides and flanks ; lower back and upper tail-coverts blue ; above
drab brown ; below lighter and almost pinkish ; beak and eyes
black; legs and feet brown, with the claws a trifle darker but not
in any sense black. Doubtless it was the blue chest of this bird
of which I had obtained a glimpse when I peeped into the box
ere it sank down prostrate on the floor. The second, also shewing
a fair amount of blue, appeared at 11.30, the third at 7 p. 111., and
the fourth at 7.15. All of these could fly ; and they collected on
a perch above the nest, although the plumage of the latter two
was none too forward. The fifth I picked up off the ground on
the following forenoon ; but it also was on a perch before the
evening. The last three were little balls of light pink-drab, very
light below, washed feebly here and there with blue--but not
a suspicion of blue was visible on the sides of the body for a few

days. All had light blue on the lower back and upper tail-coverts..
The tails varied according to the light; the}&amp;apos;' were dark with
concealed blue, which gradually developed. The legs of some
were lighter, of a pale flesh colour. The shades of both brown
and blue were lighter than in the parents.
The old birds had a very poor time ; that they should have
succeeded in rearing these little delicate creatures under the
trying circumstances in which they found themselves is very
wonderful, for all of the five are alive and well, flying and
pecking about freely, and practically independent. As if there
were not enough troublesome and worrying birds to plague them,.
I must needs add to the number by transferring to their aviary
the four Pied Rock-Thrushes about which I have been writing
lately ; for the unexpected appearance of an unusual nest in the
reserved aviary constrained me to clear them out. The young
Rock-Thrushes, accustomed to shelter and privacy, were very
wild in this open aviary, especially the youngest, who would
become ridiculously frantic should I venture to look at him
through the binocular ; and these and other comparatively large
birds flying and occasionally dashing about terrify the Waxbills,
over and over again scattering the whole brood to the winds, not
infrequently after they have settled down for the night. The
old Rock-Thrushes were still more aggravating, though in another
way, for, being too tame to be frightened off, they pounced down
upon and gobbled up insects and special food enough to have
reared many dozen of baby Blue-breasted Waxbills.
The old Waxbills tended and shepherded their little brood,
and, indeed, still do so, with unremitting devotion, attention, and
patience; nothing discouraged them nor caused them to lose
heart. The young keep a good deal together, sometimes in a
lump, sometimes with the baby Cuba Finches, sometimes paired
off in couples as far as may be ; they are charmingly confiding
and tame, and rarely move as one approaches :--and thus let them,
make their little bow and retire behind the curtain.
But the birds in the reserved aviary had not been idle all
this time. I reckoned that their new nest was three days behind
the one I have just been writing about. I have an earlier note
referring to Leah's first fledgeling--"A good deal of squeaking.

Mr. R. Philupps,
as if several about, but can see only one." On August 9th, there
was a very great deal of squeaking, and I was tempted to explore.
The Blue-breasted Waxbills were flitting and pecking about in a
rather open space, and, after several counts, I satisfied myself
that there were not less than seven--a further addition of three--
all looking perfect.* This brings the total of young ones up to
nine, the result of careful preparation in the spring, and an
exemplification of the old law, too often forgotten in these days of
idleness and pleasure-seeking, that as a man sows so shall he
also reap. In this case, the male had regularly applied for food
at the aviary door.
I have referred to the young of the Rakes being so silent,
and to those in the reserved aviary being noisy:--why this
difference? I may suggest two theories :--(1) The young in the
reserved aviary are mostly in a thick leafy clump of bushes and
bushy trees, and need to be incessantly calling out in order that
the parents may know of their whereabouts and that the flock
may not become scattered. In the open aviary, where the birds
can see one another, to call out would be superfluous and would
serve no useful end. (2) In the reserved aviary, the young have
neither fears nor cares, and can open their little joyous hearts
without restraint. In the mixed aviary, there must always be a
little weight on their minds ; at any moment, some heavier bird
working off his exuberant spirits, or it may be only a blundering
Waxwing, may fall like a bomb into their midst and scatter them
as by an explosion ; they cannot be quite such thoughtless child-
like children as their fellows amidst the leaves.
The nest of this species is a large domed structure of hay,
usually lined with feathers. While building, the birds become
very tame, especially the male, who will boldly come to one for
feathers or anything he may require. They can be watched
while building, but later become secretive--though, as the male
may generally be found sitting on a perch close to the nest, he
unwittingly betrays its situation.
"Three or four eggs are laid," according to Stark--but he
refers to a nest that had been found by Andersson which con-
tained five.
* There were four iu this batch, bringing- the total of young at that time up to ten.

And now I may bring my story to a close by relating a
little incident that occurred last night, August n,--a very little
incident, but one which may be interesting to those who love
birds.
The Rakes have been rebuilding their last nest, and yester-
day both were on guard on a perch just outside, so presumably an
egg had been deposited.
A little before dark, I peeped into the aviary to see if all
were right. Round a projecting corner of the house, and quite
away from and out of sight of the nest, at the very top of a corner
of the aviary, with sheltering boards, there are some perches
which are arranged one below another in the form of steps.
On the little top step, the two elder fledgelings were asleep,
side by side.
On the next step below was one of the young Pied Rock-
Thrushes, " pointing." The baby Blue-breasted Waxbills had
ousted it from its usual perch, and with great amiability it had
taken a lower seat.
On the next step were the three younger fledglings, all
rolled up together in a lump.
And below were the parents--the whole forming, on this
lovely summer evening, a beautiful picture of sweet repose.
But there was one uneasy spirit in that little flock, for the
loving mother had a divided heart.
The father understood that he was in charge of the children,
and he planted himself down in a most determined manner: he
was not going to be tempted from the post of duty.
The mother nestled down at his side; then, starting up,,
she darted off round the corner to inspect the nest; having
satisfied herself that all was right, back she came, only again
and again to start up and dash off on a visit of inspection. But
darkness was coming on apace, and she must needs decide
between her two loves without further delay--and this is what
she did.
Just opposite to the corner of the house, far removed from
both of the sacred spots but commanding a view of each, is a dead
tree; and, finally, in a fork of this tree she settled down for the

night all by herself, separated indeed from those she holds most
dear, but with a loving eye which embraced all her treasures.
Later.--Towards the end of August, the bills of the fledge-
lings became like those of the adult but not so bright; and early
in September the plumage of even the youngest had become
fairly blue. Two grew some young feathers in their tails, but it
was difficult to detect any signs of actual moult. The elder two,
who had been very blue from the time they left the nest, com-
menced to build a natural nest (a specimen of which they had
never seen) about mid-August, a circumstance which would seem
to point to a direct connection in this species between the vigour
of the bird and the amount and depth of the blue in the plumage.
The younger fledgelings are ridiculously tame, perching
on me anywhere when I am in the aviary. On Sept. 5, No. 4
sang for the first time--whilst he was sitting on my shoulder;
and 011 the following morning, as soon as I appeared, he came 011
to my shoulder with chirps of welcome, and then burst forth into
song; and for quite a time he was on my head singing whilst I
was going about attending to food and water.

By Hubert D. Asteey.
Twice this summer has my female Touraco nested, and
twice her brute of a husband has wrecked her hopes, and all but
wrecked her too ! On the first occasion she was diligently sitting
on one or two eggs, when without a word of warning he went for
her, damaged her head, plucked out feathers and smashed the
eggs. But she forgivingly allowed him to make it up, and not
long afterwards she again nested on a large basket-lid which was
placed high up in a dark corner of the roosting-house, where
she again sat for three or four weeks, indeed, for so long that I
climbed up one day to see what was happening, but as she
refused to stir off the nest, pecking and hissing at me, I left her
alone.

on the Breeding of White-crested Touracos. 351
A few days afterwards, the wretched male bird (whom I
now realise I ought to have shut up by himself) again went for
her, drove her off the nest and damaged her.
I happened to be just leaving home for the day, and only
heard the news at midday, when it was too late for me to go and
see into things, nor was I aware that the hen Touraco was so
ruffled that she could not get up to the nest again. I merely had
time to order the incarceration of the male bird.
As I was leaving home, the thought occurred to me that
there might possibly be young ones in the nest, but I was not
home until too late to look.
The next morning I mounted a ladder, when to my horror
I found two young birds of the size of newly hatched Bantams,
and marvellous to relate, still alive, although they had been
without food or warmth for about twenty hours ! ! I held them
in my hands to warm them, although the life within them was all
but gone, and to my delight both birds after about twenty
minutes began to show signs of reviving, but one (the smaller of
the two) collapsed in about an hour.
The other quite regained its strength, and I put some
small pieces of grape down its throat, which it swallowed well,
only to bring all up again in five minutes. Then I tried some
bread scalded in milk with " Banana Crystals," and it kept some
down, seeming to do fairly well; but it was not the right thing,
and the poor nestling died the following morning.
Had I only incarcerated the male bird sooner, I feel sure
the mother would have successfully reared them, for she never
left them, and they must have been full of vitality to endure so
long under such adverse circumstances.
As I wrote last year, the young are covered thickly with
deep brown fluff, and the gape of the mouth is very large.

{Continued from page 332).
Indian Roller. Coracias indica.
This bird usually hops when on the ground, but sometimes
walks a few steps; it stretches out the legs behind in flight. It
often moves its tail down, but not up. Nestlings are plantigrade,
though without well-marked heel-pad ; they move by alternate
steps, and can go backwards as readily as forwards. This Roller
has two calls, a single note like " tchok" and a cackle, rather like
a laugh, uttered with head erect; even nestlings give this note.
This is one of the birds which cast pellets.
Indian Pied Kingfisher. Ceryle varia.
A specimen I kept had some white spots on the black tail-
band and some black on the white base of the tail, such markings,
according to Blauford, being characteristic of the African race.
I had it for a little time flying at large, having hand-reared it.
There were three in the batch I bought, all of which had two
gorgets--the sign of masculinity--but the second was a mere
line. This species runs when on the ground like our Kingfisher,*
and does not hop like the Laughing Jackasses (. Dacelo ). I noticed
the young birds moved their short tongues, which were fleshv-
red, freely, often licking their tips, as it were.
Common Kingfisher. Alcedo ispida.
I do not know where Howard Saunders got hold of the
information that this bird's feet are " reddish brown " (Manual
of British Birds, second edition, p. 2S0); I should have thought
everybody knew they were bright vermilion-red, in the adult;
in the young they are dull black, as I have observed here as well
as in India, where this bird is very common and tame; one can
watch it as easily as one can a robin here.
Indian Stork-billed Kingfisher. Pelargopsis gurial.
Young birds have the beak, which is red in the adult,
* Of course Kingfishers seldom move about on their feet at all, but as I have noticed
the hopping- gait of the large species of Dacelo, I thought it as well to put on record the
difference in the movement of the others, as it seems strange that birds so much alike in
structure and general habit should show a difference in their gait, especially as they use
their feet so little.

largely clouded with black except at the tip. This species walks,
and does not hop.
White-breasted Kingfisher. Halcyon smyrnensis.
The young have the bill blackish, instead of red, with the
tip and the middle of the ridge orange; the feet blackish instead
of red, orange behind and on soles. They also show narrow
dark edgings to the white breast feathers.
This species has an undulating flight, and runs when on
the ground, not hopping. Although chiefly a land-feeder--I have
seen it alight on a road, at Debra Dun, and pick up a worm--it
bathes by plunging, as all Kingfishers seem to do, whether
fishers or otherwise. It expands its drooped wings when court-
ing so as to show the white patch on the primaries.
Great Hornbice. Dichoceros bicornis.
I once saw at Rutledge's establishment in Calcutta a quite
unfledged bird, only about as large as a common duck, and with
feathers only on the head, wings and tail. There was no down,
and the bare skin was dark purplish blue. There was no heel-
pad. The casque, of course, was not visible, as is the case with
all young Eastern Hornbills I have seen, though fledged.
Indo-BurmesE Pied HornbilL. Anthracoceios albirost?&amp;apos;is.
A young bird I had was keen on insects, and was as fond
of raw meat as of fruit, if not more so. These birds are known
to be particularly fond of animal food.
European Hoopoe. Upupa epops.
The Common Hoopoe is only a winter visitant to Calcutta,
and not abundant; 1 never saw the richer-coloured Indian race
( Uindica&amp;apos;) there at all; nor were specimens of this ever brought
to the Bazaar. This bird utters a "swearing '' or jarring call
when alarmed. I noticed that, at about sixty yards distance,
this bird, so conspicuous close at hand, is quite invisible on the
soil, not that it can need concealment much, as it easily escapes
from hawks. A friend of mine once slipped two Shikras ( Astur
badius) at one and the same Hoopoe, and it dodged them both.
Indian Swift. Cypselus affinis.
It is usually stated that in the typical Swifts, like this, the
toes are all directed forwards, but in this species, as I have often

Mr. Frank Finn,
seen when holding a bird by the wings, when it will open and
close its toes, these act in pairs, the two inner being opposed to
the two outer, only the action is lateral, not fore-and-aft as
in most pair-toed birds. The bird is easily captured, as it often
comes into rooms; I have tried to see the position of the legs in
flight, and by watching a rather tired bird as it flew round show-
ing its feet, noticed that these were carried rather behind than
before, whereas Swallows carry their feet forward, like the rest
of the passerine group to which they belong.
Horsfirld's Nightjar. Caprimulgns macrurus.
This bird hops when on the ground, whereas most Night-
jars runs.
Common Coucal. Centropus sinensis.
A bird of this species in the Calcutta Zoo, which had been
reared by me, and had never to my knowledge seen a snake,
attacked one when given, making for the head and neck, and
mortally injured it. Immediately after this, although usually
fond of being caressed and fondled, it was averse to being
handled. In feeding this bird puts its foot on a large morsel
like a crow. It casts no pellets.
Barn Owl. Slrixflammea.
Two skins of the Andamanese race of this bird were in
the Indian Museum. These had the wings short and rounded ;
those of one (No. 1866, Anikhet) did not nearly reach the end of
tail ; the first quill was half an inch shorter than the second ;
the second, third and fourth were sub-equal. This was, however,
I think, barely full-fledged. I11 the second, received by myself
alive on Ross Island (No. 21732) the wings just reached the end
of the tail ; the skin however was not so well made ; the first quill
was a very little longer than in the other, the second and third
sub-equal and longest; the fourth sub-equal to the first. The
wings are thus on the whole shorter and broader than in the
typical Barn-Owl, but I may add the bird is 011 the whole quite
as big, being more stoutly and powerfully built, with stronger
bill and claws. This was also easily seen in a living bird which
was kept in the Calcutta Zoo along with a ordinary mainland
specimen. This, like the two Museum birds, was dark in
plumage, as described by Blauford for this race, but the

Andamanese bird looks very different from the dark Galapagos
Barn-Owl (Strixpnnctatissoma) of which there was a specimen in
the London Zoo some time ago, for this individual was a sort of
bantam Barn-Owl, much smaller, but preserving the true slender
proportions. I should almost feel inclined to call the Andam-
anese form ( S.flammea deroepstorfii ) a true species ; it is certainly
tlie most distinct race of Barn-Owl I have seen. Neither of the
Indian Museum specimens, by the way, had the pectination of
the claw of the third toe characteristic of Barn-Owls in general.
Grass-Owl. Strix Candida .
Two young received and reared in the Calcutta Zoo had
the facial disk vinous or brownish pink ; their down was buff, not
white as in the young Barn-Owl.
Short-eared Owl. Asio accipitrimis.
I saw a specimen flying round the ship I was on in the Bed
Sea, in the autumn of 1897 1 it was in the day-time, and I noticed
it carried its feet extended behind.
Spotted Owlet. Athene brama.
I observed a couple pairing in the Museum grounds in
January, 1897. The male fluttered his wings, but appeared also
to take hold with the bill. They kept up a low chattering note.
Collared Pigmy Owlet. Glaucidium brodiei.
Mr. B. B. Osmaston had a pair of these in captivity ; the
larger bird, presumably the hen, killed the male one day by
gripping him by the throat with her foot and choking him, and
then showed a desire to eat him, although they had been fed.
She was afterwards brought to England.
Osprey. Pandion haliaetus.
I think systematists make too much of the supposed
reversible outer toe of this bird as an Owl-like characteristic.
I11 a specimen they had at the London Zoo, in 1901, I noticed
that as the bird sat on a thick perch this toe was merely at right
angles with the middle one, not reversed, and the claw was
turned forward, resting flat on the perch ; whereas in an Owl the
set of this fourth toe is decidedly backwards.
Small White Scavenger Vulture. Neophron ginginianus.
I saw plenty of these birds about Mussoorie in the summer

of 1895 ; and observed that as they soared they carried their legs
behind and rather drooping. Although this yellow-billed species,
or rather race, is supposed to be replaced by the black-billed N.
peicnopterus in Afghanistan and Baluchistan, the Afghan-Baluclr
Commission of 1896 got a specimen of the Indian form gingin-
ianus, among the birds they collected there.
Bearded Vulture. Gypaetus barbahts.
A pair haunted Mussoorie when I was there ; they flew
low, and near enough, on one occasion at least, for me to see the
beard of bristles under the bill. The bird has a magnificent
appearance on the wing, and it and the Scavenger ( Neophron)
resemble each other far more than either does a typical Vulture.
Blauford has also observed the resemblance between these two
forms.
Common Pariah Kite. Milvus govinda.
This bird abounded in Calcutta in my time, and was as
bold as a London pigeon ; I often saw it robbed of its food by a
couple of Crows, one keeping in front, and the other behind to
jerk the Kite's tail at a critical moment. I once saw a Crow
snatch food, without artifice, from a Kite, which in this case
was a young bird in immature plumage. I even saw a Kite,
however, behave in a very intelligent way. The bird, an adult,
was feeding on some chicken entrails on the corner of a flat roof,
these trailing a foot from it over the surface of the roof. On the
close approach of two Crows, the Kite stopped eating, and pulled
in the entrails, and packed them under its feet; it then resumed
its meal without concern, while the disappointed Crows flew
away, the Kite's strategic position 011 the corner of the roof
making a rear attack out of the question.
Marsh Harrier. Circus aerugitiosus.
I once saw a full-plumaged male walking about 011 the
ground looking for food near the water in the Calcutta Botanical
Gardens ; I noticed it particularly, as one seldom sees a hawk
walk much in the wild state, and several naturalists seem to think
that they hop, a gait to which I think they only resort when
wanting to move fast, like the typical Crows and Starlings.

Neoph cm a veil us la.
By VV. A. Fasey.
In the spring of 1904 I purchased seven Grass Parrakeets
from Mr. Jamrach (the whole of the importation). He described
them as Blue-banded Grass Parrakeets ( Neophema venusta). I
still have two pairs of these who annually nest and only on one
occasion have they hatched young, but not reared to leave the
nest.
A year or two ago Messrs. Payne and Wallace brought
over a number of so-called Rock Grass Parrakeets ( Neophema
petrophila ) of which I obtained two pairs, and it is one of these
pairs that has succeeded in rearing one young one to leave the
nest.
Now these " so called " Rock Grass Parrakeets are
absolutely the same as the Blue-winged Grass, at least as far as
I can see, and I have most carefully examined them together,
so I have not the least doubt that they are wrongly called Rock
Grass Parrakeets. Moreover, on reference to Mr. Seth-Smith's
book, ''Parrakeets," both Mr. Jamrach's and Messrs. Payne and
Wallace's importations answer more to description given for the
Blue-winged Grass Parrakeet.
Perhaps some of our members interested in Parrakeets
would care to examine my pairs, in that case I shall be pleased
to give them the proper facility to do so. However, whichever
species they belong to, I am equally entitled to the Society's
Medal as neither has been previously reared in England.
The pair of birds has occupied alone an aviary fifteen
feet by seven feet, one half of which is an open flight turfed
with grass.
Early in the spring of this year they nested without
success, and on the second occasion succeeded in hatching and
rearing one young one.
The young one is marked exactly like the parents, but
with nothing like so brilliant tints.
The Blue-winged Parrakeets are very quiet and showy
birds, although not so interesting or lively as the Platycercus or

Psephotus (Blue Bonnets being especially interesting; my two
pairs play and run about like young kittens) I would, however,
like to see some of their near relatives imported, such as the
Turquoisine and Splendid. I am the proud owner of one
Turquoisine (perhaps the only one in Europe) which is mated to
a Bourke, and nesting, but Ido not anticipate successful results
as they have had many previous clutches of eggs.

Two arrivals during the last month are so remarkable that
everything else seems insignificant by comparison. One is the
Great Monkey-eating Eagle of the Philippines ( Pithecophaga
jejferyi ) a bird only recently discovered, and so rare that even the
known skins in collections can be easily counted on the fingers
of one hand. The Zoo specimen, the first to be imported, is
dark brown above and white below, with the thigli-coverts and
the long liackle-like head-feathering streaked with brown and
white. The eyes are pale grey, like those of the South American
Harpy-eagle, to which this species is supposed to be allied. In
size, the Zoo specimen about equals the Golden Eagle, and its
feet are about equally powerful, but the large bill must be quite
twice the size of the Golden Eagle's; the unfeathered shanks and
short wings give the bird much the appearance of a gigantic
Goshawk.
The other bird, though not new to the collection, has not
been represented there for many years, and is of more interest
from an avicultural point of view, being the splendid Ocellated
Wild Turkey of Honduras, ( Meleagris ocellata). In this bird the
prevailing tint is green, not bronze as in the ordinary Wild
Turkey, the tail feathers and their coverts being grey, with blue
and copper tips. The head is bare and blue, with red and yellow
warts, and the legs red. Although not so splendid as the fine
stuffed specimen at South Kensington, the Zoo bird is yet a
magnificent creature, and will no doubt be finer as it improves in
condition. Although it is considerably smaller than the common
Turkey, this bird is so beautiful that if it could be domesticated
it would certainly become very popular.

COLOUR OF REDPOLLS IN CONFINEMENT.

It is, I believe, a generally recognised fact, that Redpolls,
Linnets, etc., almost always lose the rose tints on breast and
flanks during their first moult in confinement, so that I hope
the following may be of some interest. I bought two immature
Redpolls in the early autumn of 1907. That autumn and last
they moulted, and as I expected showed no colour. But this
autumn they have both moulted and attained the red on the
head and pink on the breast. I have never before known a case
of their assuming colour in confinement, and only one case of
their retaining it ; this was a wild-caught bird in colour belong-
ing to a cousin of mine, who kept him in a cage in rather a dingy
bedroom for three years, during which period he retained a most
beautiful colour; he died this spring, and the skin is in my
collection. I attributed the reason of my birds coming into
colour this moult to the fact that I keep them in my Waders'
Aviary, where this spring I planted a lot of reeds and rushes, on
whose seeds they have fed for the last month or two, and I believe
the seeds of rushes to be the natural food of Redpolls at this
season.
Mr. St. Ouintin tells me that his male Pine Grosbeaks never
lose their colour, but then his birds are an exception !

Tharrhaleus jerdoni.
By W. E- Teschemaker, B.A.
Two pairs of this charming little species came into my
possession on the 4th May, 1908. having been brought home by
our member Capt. G. A. Perreau. They proved to be quite
hardy little birds, as may be inferred from the fact that they
breed up to a considerable altitude in the Himalayas. They are
rather smaller than our European Accentor, with darker striations
on the back, a white stripe over the eye and a bright rufous
chest. The female is much lighter on the chest, so much so that,
after one has become acquainted with the species, one can pick

Mr. W. E. Teschemakek
out the sexes at a glance. Nevertheless, neither Capt. Perreau
nor I could be sure of the sexes at first, and I have noticed the
same thing in many other cases. They nested in July, laying a
single egg in a large untidy nest in an Aucuba. The egg is
rather smaller than that of A. modularis and distinctly lighter in
shade: dimensions .81 x .55. An average egg of A. modularis
measures .84 x .61. This egg hatched on 23rd July, after an
incubation-period of eleven days. Nothing but live insect food
was carried to the nest, and much of this was not provided by me
but brought to bag by the parents themselves, who were most
industrious in turning over leaves and investigating odd corners.
The young bird, who resembled his parents except that he had
no rufous on the chest, which was grey lightly spotted with
brown, left the nest 011 5th August, and in a day or two could
fly strongly.
Unfortunately his career was destined to be a short one, for,
just before he became quite independent, he was seen one day with
the lower mandible broken and hanging loose. His sorrowing
parents tried hard to feed him but the poor little fellow gradually
died of starvation. It is worthy of note that, when I caught the
young bird, to see if I could do anything for him, the adults
instead of manifesting any anxiety perched on an apple tree only
a few inches from my hand and appeared to be solicitously
awaiting the result of my diagnosis, so true is it that, in their
last extremity, the animals associated with man seem to realize
that his superior reasoning powers may be of use to them. Capt.
Perreau, Mr. W. T. Page and myself held a sort of inquest 011
the poor little corpse, but, though many explanations were sug-
gested as to the cause of the accident, we none of 11s guessed the
true explanation which only came to light some twelve months
later. The mandible appeared to have been not only broken but
twisted with some force, and there was a good deal of blood on
the throat. This concludes the first chapter of the history of my
Accentors, which Chapter may be entitled "The Tragedy."
The next Chapter opens more brightly, for on the 12th
July this year (1909) the same pair of birds hatched another
youngster, this time building an exceedingly neat and artistic
nest, lined with the feathers of Sonini's Colin, in a Cupressus and

laying two eggs. This youngster was fully reared. It was a
female, and with the other adult male (from which and a female
A. modularis I had been unsuccessfully trying to obtain some
hybrids) was purchased by our member, Mr. H. Willford.
We now come to Chapter No. 3, which we may call " The
Aftermath," which explains, after the fashion of the good old
Railway Novel of our youth, how the tragedy really happened in
Chapter No. r. Elated by their success the same pair of birds
again built, laid three eggs and brought off two young. One
morning I heard a tremendous hubbub in the aviary. The
Blue-bearded and Green Jays in the division next to the large
aviary were yelping with excitement, the Magpie Tanagers and
Bulbuls were screaming, and the White-crested Jay Thrushes
shouting themselves hoarse. Above all the din I heard the notes
of distress of the Accentors. I quite thought a Weasel had found
its way in, but, on reaching the scene of action, the only thing I
could see was the Accentors excitedly dashing themselves against
the netting which separated them from the Jays' aviary. This
however limited the issue, as Sherlock Holmes used to say;
clearly it had to do with the Jays and the Accentors. Adopting
the methods of that celebrated investigator I began to examine
the ground and there at my very feet lay the ' causa causans '--one
of the young Accentors dying and with both&amp;apos;mandibles torn off!
Evidently the unfortunate victim had flown against the netting
and the Jays had done the rest.
I must not conclude without pointing out the apparently
close affinity between A. modularis and T. jerdoni. The habits
of the two species are almost identical, the same nervous, jerky
action, the same shuffling of the wings, the same low, rippling
song, the same diet; for, whereas our Accentor is the only one of
our softbills which will live for any length of time without some
soft-food, Jerdon's Accentor will flourish for an indefinite
period on small seeds and an occasional mealworm. There are
certain mannerisms also which precede the act of pairing in the
case of A. modularis , which will be familiar to those of our
members (if any) who are students of British birds, and we find
these identical mannerisms in T. jerdojii. Now, seeing that the
two species do not quite over-lap as breeding species, one can

only conclude that, just as ethnologists tell us that there was a
common ancestor of all the Indo-European peoples--some race
which was located on the great Tableland northward of the
Himalayas, so there must have been a common ancestor of the
Accentors, from whom they have inherited some of the marked
characteristics which we note in widely separated species
to-day.

OUR ILLUSTRATIONS.
Sir, --If I am not mistaken the illustration of the Red-necked
Phalaropes which stands as the frontispiece of the September Magazine,
represents three stuffed birds, and if this is so, I cannot help thinking that a
great many of our members will agree with me that such " faked " photo-
graphs are undesirable and also unworthy of reproduction in a periodical
which is devoted to recording the culture of living birds.
To begin with, I think that our frontispiece, at any rate, should be a
representation of an original drawing, painting, or photograph, and not
something borrowed from some other work, but if the latter has to be
resorted to, let us at least have a representation of living birds.
I11 " Our Rarer British Breeding Birds," by R. Kearton, there is a very
pretty photo, of a Red-necked Phalarope (p. 84) and on p. 81 an equally
good one of its nest and eggs : both done from life.
I have at all times a very strong dislike to photographs of stuffed
birds, unless it is impossible to obtain any from living ones, and then the
stuffed ones must be mounted to perfection. If the representation in the
September Magazine is done from life, the birds certainly grouped them-
selves very unnaturally, standing one behind the other and all staring in
the same direction : personally I cannot believe they did pose like that, for
to begin with there would probably be more than one young bird, and
secondly such babies would be hiding amongst the rushes or the grass.
Then again, at the risk of being considered cranky and tiresome, I
am afraid I think it is a pity to take up valuable space with an illustration
(again borrowed) of two common Rooks, whose courtship most people in
England can see without much trouble in the last weeks of winter, or early
ones of spring. Hubert D. Asti.ey.
A REMARKABLE FAMILY OF BLACKBIRDS.

protection of birds now enforced was responsible for the great increase of
albinism noticeable in some of our more familiar species during the past

decade. In some cases this albinism is only partial, and is represented by
pied, cinnamon, or partly cinnamon sports.
On the 3rd and 4th of the present month I saw a very remarkable
instance of this partial albinism in my garden, in which an entire family of
Blackbirds, of four (if not five) individuals, had the head and neck of a
brownish clay-colour; all the birds had acquired their adult plumage and
the abrupt transition from clay-brown to jet black in the male birds gave
them a most extraordinary appearance : in the females it was of course not
quite so striking. A. G. BuTEER,

Sir, --With reference to your note in the Magazine as to Mr. Astley's
bird being first hatched--I am unable to say the date mine were hatched, as
I did not discover them until they were several weeks old, of which I wrote
you on July 2nd.
I again wrote yon July 18th the young had fled; they had, however,
at this date left the nest several days previously. O11 July 16th Mr. Astley's
birds were still in the nest, so that mine undoubtedly were the first young
birds reared.
You did not reply to either of my letters, so I did not send an account
of the breeding; I am however quite clear as to the procedure, having had
several previous medals.
When you decide which birds are first, I shall be pleased to send a
full account. Wm. .R. Fasey.

Major B. R. Horsbrugh has sent me an interesting skin of the Melba
Waxbill, obtained in Pretoria, which has secondaries in both wings pale
yellow, as are also the bases of the primaries, &amp;apos;while a broken yellowish-
white collar encircles the nape. " I was reminded of it," he writes, " by
seeing a young robin with one white wing hopping about on my lawn."
Some time ago, Mr. C. W. Ginn showed me a stuffed cock Zebra Finch,
which was all white, except for the orange and bay colouring on the cheeks
and flanks, and for the fact that the black markings 011 the breast and tail-
coverts were represented by pale drab. The beak seems to be red as usual.
The bird was bred from a normally-coloured pair. Frank Finn.
