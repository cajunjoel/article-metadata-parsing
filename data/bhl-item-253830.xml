The Pied Imperial Fruit Pigeon is a very striking bird with its white and
black plumage providing sharp contrast. It is predominantly white with the
primaries, primary coverts, outer secondaries and part of the tail, black.
Derek Goodwin (Pigeons and Doves of the World, 1967) describes its dis-
tribution as from the Andamans and Nicobars, eastwards to the Philippines,
Moluccas and islands west of New Guinea. Although first seen at the Lon-
don Zoo in 1867, it would appear that this species has not been regularly
imported.
The pair we have at Waddesdon Manor has been in the collection for
eight years and no display or breeding activity had been seen until this
year. We think it is possible that the use of a nutritional supplement
(Intervets SA37) on the food since January 1982 may have been the factor
that brought the birds into breeding condition. These birds have always
been very set in their ways regarding diet. Approximately half inch cubed
fruit is taken but other foods such as mixed corn, mincemeat, hard-boiled
egg and coarse softbill food are ignored. Despite the availability of live
food we have never seen them eat mealworms or locusts. Food dishes in
the form of hang-ons are fixed to the wire at perch ends as these birds
seem loathe to land on the ground, and they are only rarely seen at the
pool drinking.
They are housed in a large aviary measuring 24 ft. long by 20 ft. wide
by 25 ft high with an inside shelter 8 ft. long by 6 ft wide by 11 ft high.
The flight has a central fountain in the middle of a lawn, with a gravel
path running round the perimeter. At each corner is a planted bed con-
taining Cotoneaster. All our aviaries hold mixed collections, and this

lings, Yellow-vented Bulbuls and Carolina Wood Ducks. Careful siting of
feeding points has produced relative harmony in this flight, with only the
hen Chinese Crested Mynah showing more than average aggression.
The first examples of display by the pigeons were seen during the
second week of May, and over the following five weeks three very sepa-
rate types of display were witnessed. The first involved the cock and hen
sitting close together on the perch, both facing in the same direction. The
cock puffed out his breast feathers and lowered his head in a bowing
posture. He then made a series of short jumps on the spot, approximately
every second, and about 2 inches off the perch. Cooing loudly throughout
with the body remaining in the crouched position, he attempted mating
after about 10 seconds of display but the hen did not seem interested and
moved away. This display did not seem to be prompted by anything
other than the fact that the birds were perched close together on the same
branch. The second example of display was seen only once and took place
during the first week in June. The cock was on the nesting platform and
the hen on a branch just below it. The cock flew to join her and what we
called "necking" followed.
Each bird was rubbing its head and neck against the other and alter-
nating sides, a display which lasted about 20 seconds. It was accompanied
by quite a loud clicking noise but it was not knownwhether this was pro-
duced by the beaks or if it originated in the voice box. The birds were
positioned facing each other during this display, one of the most unusual
forms we have ever witnessed at Waddesdon Manor from any species. The
third and final example of display appeared to be one of attraction, the
cock crouching very low on the perch with his head below perch level,
his tail cocked in the air, and wings slightly drooped and rustling. (There
was no sign of the puffed chest that we saw in the first display.) He then
threw back his head making a metallic noise, not unlike a stick hitting a
metal drum full of water. This was continued until the hen flew to join
him and at that point the cock immediately reverted to the first example
of display.
On 15th June the cock was seen carrying twigs and this continued for a
few days. They had chosen a platform near the roof in the inside shelter
which consisted of 16 gauge 1 inch x Vi inch mesh Twilweld, 12 inches
square with a 3 inch lip. This choice surprised us as there were three plat-
forms of similar design in the outside flight and the pigeons did not usually
spend much time in the inside shelter. Despite supplying a wide range of

twigs of varying size and from different types of tree, the nest building was
a disaster. The bulk of the twigs they placed on the platform were dislodged
until after six days there were only three twigs left. At this point we deci-
ded to intervene and a rough nest of dead Yew twigs was constructed for
the birds on 21st June. This proved to be only just in time as the single
egg was laid the following day on their newly constructed nest. Incubation
was by the hen alone, the cock never being seen to venture into the inside
shelter. After 11 days of incubation we saw the hen off the nest and, to
our disappointment, inspection of the egg revealed that the embryo had
failed to form properly. However, the fact that the egg was fertile en-
couraged us for at no stage had we witnessed mating.
Immediately the hen rejoined the cock in the flight he started to dis-
play again. This continued for a further nine days and on 12th July the
hen laid again. Inspection of the egg on 17th July revealed that it was
fertile. All we could do was hope for better luck this time. The cock bird
was never seen to enter the inside shelter to join the hen from the day she
laid the egg. However, suddenly on 1st August he appeared on the nest
platform with her and spent most of the day there. He continued to do
this but was clearly taking no part in incubation but just sitting alongside
the hen.
On 4th August, to our delight, a chick hatched and seemed strong and
vigorous. The incubation period of 24 days quite surprised us as the infor-
mation available on other species of Fruit Pigeon rather suggests 17-18 days.
Hopefully we will get the opportunity to check this with a second round.
Close inspection was not carried out until 7th August and this revealed a
healthy chick with fawn coloured down and rather large bluish feet. The
parent birds had become extremely agitated by the disturbance and we
decided to leave well alone. The young pigeon grew quickly and on 28th
August was seen perching on the edge of the nest platform. The following
day it had fledged and was flying quite strongly around the outside flight.
This was 25 days after hatching, and seven days after fledging it was first
seen feeding by itself. The young bird was not caught up for close inspec-
tion, but appeared to be only different from the parents in size, being
slightly smaller. By the end of September it was well established and in
good plumage.
The hen laid again on 8th September and hatched a second chick on
1st October confirming the incubation period as 24 days. At the time of
writing, the chick is five days old and progressing well.
As described, the Pied Imperial Fruit Pigeon Ducula bicolor has been bred at
Waddesdon Manor. This is believed to be the first success in this country but anyone
knowing of a previous breeding in Great Britain or Northern Ireland, or any other
reason that would disqualify this claim, is asked to inform the Hon. Secretary.

Gyps bengalensis
In the wild this handsome bird has a distribution over the Indian sub-
continent from as far north as the Himalayan mountain range down to the
southernmost tip. The species breeds in small colonies, typically building
nests in trees growing on riverbanks. It is considered a holy bird by the
Parsees, freeing their souls from their mortal remains - hence the famous
Towers of Silence in Bombay.
Over a number of years I had managed to acquire eight birds from a
variety of sources within the United Kingdom. All birds had their full
mature plumage on acquisition and the zoos that they came from were
unable to give any details of estimated ages of the birds - in one instance
the birds were even misidentified as Griffon Vultures Gyps fulvus, a much
larger species with no black colouring! The mature plumage shown when
the bird is standing is of varying shades of grey tending to black. The neck
and head are covered with down and often not as sparsely as frequently
described. When in flight the pure white back is exposed as are the white
feathers under the wings. A stark contrast indeed.
As the colony grew in number it became obvious that the existing cage
was inadequate, both in size and form. The relatively small size meant that
the birds were flustered at each feeding and a number of internal supports
led to wing damage. A new cage was constructed approximately 150 feet
square and some 25 to 35 feet high with only two internal supports. It is
covered only with wire netting so that the birds are exposed to the full
forces of the British climate. There are high level roosts under which there
is a series of nesting platforms, each with a large tyre, to form the basis of
the nest. The food troughs and water baths are situated in one corner. A
number of mature fruit trees within the enclosure, together with some
poplars and evergreens, give the only protection from the wind.
The release of the birds into the new aviary was a revelation. Within
three weeks they were all fit enough to fly to the topmost perches although
it took some months for them to re-acquire absolute assurance in man-
oeuvring.
Feeding time became less of a trauma to all concerned. Even to this day
I am closely watched by the birds and none will remain within 50 feet of
the feeding area whilst I am there. The feeding of the birds has become
simpler as the number of birds has increased. Nowadays it is only necessary
to enter the aviary at most twice a week as a ewe carcass, supplemented
by a few chickens, are sufficient for their needs for a week. When the

weather is mild or cold the meat remains sufficiently fresh. During summer
the presence of flies makes it obligatory to feed smaller amounts more
regularly as, contrary to popular belief, these birds are particular on this
aspect of feeding and once meat is flyblown, it will be rejected.
At the end of a week only the bones and fleece remain to be removed.
Many of the bones are broken up into smaller pieces by me to ensure
availability of calcium and the efficient operation of the gizzard. Oyster
grit and a multi-vitamin are sprinkled over fresh carcasses occasionally,
most often when I have opened a particularly tough-skinned carcass such
as a pig. I have found that with sheep and smaller carcasses, the birds are
able to open them without human assistance and it is my opinion that the
extra time spent together as a colony, feeding together and jockeying for
position, etc., is of great importance in the formation of a pair bond.
The improved fitness and reduction in disturbance produced an immed-
iate interest by the birds in pairing and by the commencement of the
breeding season three pairs were "bonded". The bonding is first apparent
to me when a female takes and defends a nesting site from all but the
favoured male who is allowed to approach near to, but not on the nest.
Both will stand close to each other and often there will be reciprocal
preening of the head and neck. The male may attempt mating even when
the female is not in condition, though his advances will be rejected. Such
attempts are never on the nest proper, only in the vicinity.
This remained the position for a number of years until it was noted
that one pair was showing a more constant attention towards each other
than the spasmodic attentions of just a pair bond. More and more time
was spent together, the male approached increasingly closer to the nest
and the frequent attempts at mating were rejected less vigorously. Ulti-
mately as the female came into condition, the male successfully mated
with her though he had always to beware of receiving a nip when dis-
mounting. At this time, nest-building began, both birds bringing quite
large sticks to the site. Frequency in mating increased as it did .in vigour.
The male emits a hoarse sound whilst mating but the female appears to
remain silent. Ultimately the egg was laid but it was not incubated for
long as the male died from natural causes while on the nest. This was a
great disappointment as, so far as I am aware, none had previously bred
in captivity in Britain. In August 1981 a significant increase in mating
over usual "pair bonding" activity was noted in one pair together with a
corresponding increase in building at the nest site. An egg was laid in
September and incubated alternately by both male and female for a
total period of 56 days when it was found, upon inspection, to be addled.

Immediately after removal of the egg, regular mating was again observed
and in December 1981 a second egg was laid. This event was unexpected
as most authorities state that the female is incapable of relaying save for
a short period immediately following the laying of the first egg. The
incubation was not without difficulty as not only was the weather particu-
larly severe but the male was accidentally injured and for 17 days the fe-
male incubated alone, leaving the nest only once every two or three days,
for approximately ten minutes each time, to feed. Subsequently the male
recommenced his duties at the nest and on 28th February 1982, the 62nd
day, a chick was successfully hatched.
The parents continued to share the responsibilities of brooding and
feeding. For the first few weeks the nest was never left alone and the
feeding by regurgitation was frequent. Initially the chick would place its
whole head inside its parent's throat to receive the food. By the third day
the chick's coat was a whitish down which subsequently gave way to
grey down and was ultimately replaced by juvenile plumage many weeks
later.
Growth continued apace and in the seventh week the chick could be
observed making efforts to stand, ultimately achieving success for very
short periods in the eighth week, simultaneously with the spreading and
slow flapping of the wings. By now the young bird was only being brooded
at night although its parents were never far away during daylight hours and
would return immediately should their progeny call, either through hunger
or fear. Upon cessation of constant brooding, mating between the parents,
which had ceased immediately upon egg laying, was seen to occur again,
probably to strengthen their pair bond.
By the ninth week the young vulture was about the size of a duck and
feeding had reduced in frequency to only twice a day, usually at dawn
and dusk. The parents continued to defend vigorously from intruders the
nest and platform upon which it sat, a close watch on the nesting area
being maintained although by now they were spending considerable per-
iods some distance from the nest. The growth of the body feathers was
now obvious and rapid (the tail feathers were also becoming visible) as too
was its increasing physical strength. At this time it had, on occasion, to
withstand several inadvertent but vigorous blows during battles on the nest
between its parents and intruders.
The tenth week brought further progress; the young vulture began to
hop onto the raised sides of the nest where it would stand and sun itself
or catch the breeze with outstretched wings. A definite awareness of other
activity within the aviary was noted during the week.

Young Indian White-backed Vulture, approximately nine weeks old
There followed a period of consolidation of the skills developed thus
far. The young vulture became able to stand for longer, hopping around
the nest, its agility increased and the wing-beating exercises became more
exuberant. The primary and secondary wing feathers, although apparent,
had much growth still to make and the tail feathers, now some three
inches long, were still in the quill. It preened itself, keeping the plumage
in perfect condition and even exposed its wings to gentle rain. Another
activity which occupied much time during this period was the rearranging
of fresh nesting material brought to it by the parents.
The middle of the thirteenth week brought the next significant step
when the young vulture spent the night standing on the nest, rather than
lying in it as it had hitherto. In the fourteenth week it had yet to leave the
safety of the nest. A parent tried to entice it onto the platform by regur-
gitating food onto the platform a few feet from the nest. This was not
successful and subsequently the adult reconsumed the food and fed it at the
nest. A few days later, small black quills were seen on the head and had

covered it to form a black cap within the week. This cap would seem pecu-
liar to juvenile birds aged under one year.
The young vulture left the nest for the platform early in the fifteenth
week. The first occasion was of short duration and then it hopped back on
to the nest and immediately called to the parents for reassurance. Gaining
rapidly in confidence, soon all active periods were spent on the platform
where it could preen and exercise without the constraint of the nest which
it was beginning to outgrow. The parents were still feeding their child but
the time spent at the nest was very short.
The young vulture first flew in the seventeenth week when it glided
approximately 100 feet down to the carcass of a calf and this was accom-
plished at the urging of, and in the presence of,the parents. It was not for
a further two weeks that the young vulture had sufficient ability to gain
enough height to return to the nest. During that time it was either on the
ground or on perches low to the ground. It was still kept under constant
surveillance by the parents and was led to food twice a day by them, but
from that first flight the parents were never seen to feed the young vul-
ture, despite much soliciting.
By its return to the nest, the young bird had its full juvenile plumage
of dark brown body, tail and wings with a black cap and was very dis-
tinctive when seen among the mature birds in the aviary. Although ini-
tially allowed to return to the nest, within two months the parents would
evict it as quickly and aggressively as if it were any other intruder.
Throughout the entire breeding period there was no differentiation in
diet for the breeding birds and for those not breeding. They were all fed
on a random variety of whole carcasses - sheep, calves, lambs, piglets and
chickens as available. The breeding pair ranked high in the pecking order
within the colony and it was seen that the young vulture retained their
rank even after the parents had ceased to oversee it, successfully defending
itself when challenged by older birds of lesser rank.
As described, the Indian White-backed Vulture Gyps bengalensis has been bred
and this is beheved to be the first success in this country. The breeder, who is a
member of this society, wishes to remain anonymous, but another member of the
society, who has visited the aviary and seen the birds concerned, has written confirm-
ing the breeding. Anyone knowing of a previous breeding in Great Britain or Nor-
thern Ireland, or any other reason that would disqualify this claim is asked to
inform the Hon. Secretary.

By ROSEMARY LOW (Barnet, Hertfordshire)
The Yellow-shouldered must surely be one of the least known of the
Amazon parrots from the Caribbean region. Less striking and distinctive
than the large, highly endangered Amazona of the Lesser Antilles (such as
the Imperial A. imperialis and St. Lucia A. versicolor , to the uninitiated
it could be confused with races of ochrocephala, the Yellow-fronted
Amazon. It is, indeed, closely related to it and perhaps ochrocephala
and barbadensis should be considered as superspecies. If any other species
played a part in its evolution, it was surely the Orange-winged A. amazonica ,
for reasons which I will explain later.
A medium-sized Amazon measuring about 12 inches (31 cms), the
Yellow-shouldered is generally of rather slim build. It shares with ventralis
the distinction of being the only member of the genus with the forehead
white, the beak light-coloured and no red on the face. It should not be
confused with the Yellow-winged Amazon A. aestiva xanthopteryx , a
subspecies of the Blue-front, some specimens of which have a larger area
of yellow on the shoulder but otherwise bear no resemblance to barbaden-
sis. No confusion should arise as the Yellow-winged has the bill black.
The extent of yellow on the head varies in individuals of barbadensis ,
as does the area of blue on the cheeks; some individuals possess no blue
at all.
The supposed subspecies rothschildi , from Bonaire, Blanquilla and
Margarita, is not a valid one. It is described as having less yellow on the
head and shoulder than the nominate race. Observation of birds on Bonaire,
and examination of skins from all parts of the range, shows that the degree
of yellow varies considerably in individuals, regardless of the locality from
which they originate.
Distribution.
The Yellow-shouldered Amazon is found in Venezuela (being probably
confined to two small coastal areas) and on the Venezuelan islands of
Margarita and Blanquilla, also on Bonaire, an island of the Netherland
Antilles. It was formerly found on Aruba, in the same group, but has not
been seen there since 1955. The island has a large oil refining industry,
which has resulted in little or no undisturbed land remaining.

Little was known about the status of this species in Venezuela until
April 1981. In that month Robert Ridgely, the American ornithologist,
reported (pers. comm.) finding "large numbers in both areas of Venezuela
from which they were recorded, namely western Falcon (from about
Dabujuro west to about the Zulia border) and in northern Anzoategui
(from west of Barcelona to around Puerto Piritu)." He commented:"Why
this species is so limited in range remains enigmatic. But within these
restricted areas it is locally abundant and there is no evidence of any
decline in numbers. For reasons which are not known, it is absent from
similar habitat in geographically intermediate areas in Falcon (e.g. around
Loro, and on the Paraguana Peninsula) between extreme western Falcon
and Bonaire."
Its surviving numbers on Blanquilla and Margarita are unknown. Mar-
garita is a comparatively large island, 444 square miles in extent and 37
miles long. Yepez (1964) obtained specimens of barbadensis in the local-
ity of Macanao, on Margarita. They were relatively abundant there, es-
pecially near Robledar and Boca de Rio. Near San Francisco de Macanao
they fed on maize, causing great damage; flocks of 30 birds were observed.
Yepez did not see them on the eastern part of the island but was told that
they existed there.
Finally, this species is found on Blanquilla, an island 46 miles north-
west of Margarita, measuring 10 km (6 l A miles) long and 5 km (3 miles)
wide. A flat, barren island, with low cliffs of coral limestone, the central
plateau, 60 m (200 ft) above sea level, is dotted with thin patches of
acacia, and cactus Opuntia and Cereus. Lowe (1907) had found the
parrots to be "pretty common" there in 1906.
In recent years, the only part of its range in which the Yellow-shoul-
dered Amazon has been studied by more than brief observation, is Bonaire.
Various population estimates have been made, varying from 50 pairs (an
under estimate) to between 375 and 400 by Reijns and Van der Salm.
Natural History
Bonaire is a little-known and virtually unspoiled island only 80 km
(50 miles) from the coast of Venezuela. It has an area of 112 square
miles and a population of about 8,000 people. Extremely arid, with an
annual rainfall of 50 cm (20 inches), cacti, especially two species of tall
candelabra Cereus repandus and Lamaireocereus griseus, dominate the
vegetation in most areas.
My husband and I visited Bonaire in April 1979. The only location at

Cadushi cactuses and limestone rocks; typical of Bonaire's bizarre yet haunting
landscape, inhabited by the Yellow-shouldered Amazon Parrot
which we consistently found barbadensis was Fontein, in the northern
part of the island. On the third day we were exploring a disused planta-
tion at the foot of limestone cliffs (near the coast but not on it) when we
were treated to the enthralling sight of a flock numbering at least 14
birds, flying low above us and swerving away when they discovered our
presence. They were noisy in flight, calling and chortling in typical
Amazon fashion.
Here we watched them twice daily for the following eight days. Soon
after first light, at about 6.30 - 7.00 a.m., and at about 4.00 p.m. were the
best times, although a few birds might be in evidence at almost any day-
light hour. Sometimes we saw them only as specks in the distance, flying
between the cliffs, in which there were numerous Holes, some of which
undoubtedly formed nesting sites. On the last day, 17th April, I
watched a pair of parrots which had dirty grey foreheads, probably be-
cause they had started to prepare their nest site. During the first two or
three days at Fontein, the parrots kept together in a flock of up to 19
birds. Thereafter they flew off in pairs and it seemed that the flock was
splitting up prior to breeding.

It was possible to approach the parrots to within about 9 m (30 ft).
They fed in the disused plantation which included trees of sapadillo,
almond and mango. The literature records that they feed on the fruits
and tops of cacti; at Fontein I saw a parrot on cactus on only one occa-
sion.
In times of drought, a large proportion of the parrot population on
Bonaire may starve to death. This happened in early 1978. Starving birds
flew into Kralendijk, the main settlement, looking for food. A board
member of the national park contacted a park in Venezuela to request
assistance and 2,000 kilos of mangoes were flown into Bonaire. However,
for many of the parrots help came too late; the number to die of starva-
tion or by the gun was estimated by Frater Candidus, a local ornithologist,
as 200, or slightly under half of the population. Although this species may
have adapted to periodic droughts, the use of the best watered locations
on the island for agricultural purposes, might now prevent them from find-
ing adequate food during periods of drought. If this is the case, droughts
would have a more devastating effect on the population than in former
years, and the species needs assistance in the form of funding from a con-
servation organisation, to provide food during severe droughts.
The Yellow-shouldered Amazon usually nests in May, laying two
or three eggs in a hole in a tree or cliff. Cliff nests are illegally robbed,
as this bird is prized locally as a pet. Young sell for a sum which is
small by more affluent standards, yet substantial on an island where
pigeons and iguanas are common foods of the poorer people.
In an attempt to discover more about the parrots' nesting habits, Frater
Candidus sent questionnaires to the schools. While the results cannot be
relied upon implicitly, replies indicated that some children had a knowledge
of the habits of the Yellow-shouldered Amazon which was more than
superficial. In one batch of replies examined, the answers to the question
"In which month do the parrots start to breed?" were: March (one),
April (seven), May (15), June (two), July (three) and October (three).
There were other references to nests being found in October, so this may
occasionally occur.
Information relating to nests suggested that they were divided approxi-
mately equally between cliffs and trees. Material found in the nest cavity
included leaves and feathers and, in the case of tree nests, wood gnawed
from inside the tree.
This species has been protected by law on Bonaire since August 1952,
when its capture and export were forbidden. However, the law is difficult
to enforce, and many parrots (perhaps one hundred or more) are kept as

pets on the island.
The future for this species is difficult to assess, in view of the lack of
information on its current status on Blanquilla and Margarita. Assuming
that it is only a little more numerous there than on Bonaire and in the
coastal area of Venezuela, its total population would be in the order of a
few hundreds - possibly exceeding one thousand but there is no evidence
to substantiate this figure. The parrot must be protected in all parts of its
range.
In Aviculture
This species has never, to my knowledge, been available commercially;
that is, most of the few specimens in Europe and the United States have
been imported privately. The majority of those in the USA were probably
imported by citizens formerly resident in Venezuela or on Aruba, bringing
in one bird at a time years ago, as they had every right to do.
My interest in this species was aroused in 1973. In a consignment of
Amazons imported by a London dealer was a single barbadensis. I bought
it because I knew of another; the second bird was purchased soon after.
At the time there was a single barbadensis in London Zoo; Mr. Peter Olney,
Curator of Birds, kindly allowed me to have it on breeding loan. During
the next three years these three birds were kept together in every possible
combination of two. No breeding attempt occurred. The reason for this
was not obvious until later when they all proved to be males! Subsequently
I acquired two former pet birds on breeding loan, one ("Icky") from Mr.
and Mrs. C. Wright and the other ("Susie") from Mr. Philip Levingston.
Both proved to be females. A sixth bird was obtained due to the kindness
of another member of this society, Mr. Idris Hale of Penscynor Bird Gar-
dens. This bird was later to sire our first youngster.
Having finally made up two true pairs, both females produced eggs
annually, normally in May. The usual clutch size was three; most of the
eggs were infertile. The probable reason was that one or both birds of the
pair had not achieved full breeding condition by May, especially "Susie"
and her male who would be retained indoors until April (usually the
latter part). "Susie" proved to have a low tolerance to cold weather and is
always wintered indoors with her mate, the London Zoo bird. Females
of this species are rare and no risk can be taken with her. Of 21 captive
birds known to me, only five are females.
In 1982 "Icky" and her mate had shown no interest in nesting by May.
I therefore decided to provide her with a new mate - the bird from Pen-
scynor. This change was much to the female's liking; his extrovert, cheer-

ful personality matched her own and was totally unlike the almost morose
character (atypical of barbadensis) of her previous partner. Within four
weeks she was sitting on three fertile eggs.
When checking the nest on 15th July, my husband felt only two eggs.
Further investigation revealed a newly-hatched chick which did not seem
very strong. It had bruises on the head, and the wing tips and toenails
had been bitten. He therefore removed it immediately. It was placed in an

incubator until a brooder reached the required temperature of about
95*F (35*C).
Most Amazon chicks are only sparsely covered with down, and so it
was with this barbadensis. It had some longish white down on the upper
parts only, from the nape to the lower back. The beak (showing the
smallest egg tooth I have seen in a parrot) had the raised pads on each side
of the upper mandible which is a characteristic of neotropical parrots.
The day after hatching it weighed 10 g and for the first five days of its
life put on only 1 g daily. Chicks which have never been fed by their
parents seldom grow as quickly initially as those which have. A newly-
hatched chick must be offered food of a very liquid consistency, which
means feeding at intervals of one to two hourse during the day. The rate at
which this chick's crop emptied meant that it could be left two hours
between feeds. For the first two nights it received two feeds between
11.30 p.m. and 6.00 a.m., then an additional 3.00 a.m. feed until it was 17
days old. This could have been discontinued a few days earlier but some
younger chicks required night feeds so the barbadensis benefitted.

This could have been discontinued a few days earlier but some younger
chicks required night feeds so the barbadensis benefited.
For the first five days the food consisted of a thin mixture of Heinz
first weaning food, bone and beef broth, with vegetables, plus Heinz tinned
strained fruit dessert and bone flour. This was cooked well and a small
amount of yoghurt given directly on to the spoon at each feed.
After five days, ground wheat germ cereal was added and the yoghurt
discontinued; three days later, ground up CeDe eggfood was added. A
couple of days after the eggfood was added, the most significant weight
gains occurred - a gain of 5 g in one day where previously the largest gain
had been 2 g.
For the first few days the protein content had deliberately been kept
at a reduced level. Chicks are more liable to succumb to an over-rich diet
during that period than they are to an inadequate diet. They can, in
fact, be kept alive on foods which are nutritionally poor; I am not recom-
mending this - but felt it might be wise to err on that side as we had no
previous experience of hand-feeding Amazon chicks. This one soon gained
in strength and became easier to feed. At first its voice was a mere squeak
and seldom used. This is fairly typical of Amazons reared by their parents,
some of which may not be heard throughout the entire rearing period.
After a few days it became stronger vocally, uttering a single staccato
note which was repeated six or eight times in rapid succession. Unlike
some chicks which will cry for food even when their crops are bulging, it
slept soundly between feeds. It was exceptionally clean and easy to feed
until the age of three weeks when its head-bobbing became much more
vigorous.
At 19 days came the first indication that the eyes were starting to
slit. They were not fully open until 28 days.
It was during the fourth week that the most marked changes occurred
in the Amazon chick's appearance. The tongue, which was pink on hatch-
ing, later tipped with black, had become entirely black.
The first feather tracts appeared on the wings and when the first pin
feathers were apparent, by the 26th day, feather tracts were just visible
over most of the body.
By four weeks old, it was no longer possible to use the grams scale as
the chick's weight had exceeded 100 g. Because it was so active, it was
difficult to register an accurate reading on the kitchen scales, thus weights
given after that age are less precise.
By the age of five weeks, the raised sides to the upper mandible were
completely dark. The first feathers were erupting - on the wings and just

above the flanks. The chick was then moved to another brooder where the
temperature was lower, approximately 83*F (27*C). It was removed from
a box containing paper towl, being placed on a deep bed of wood shavings.
He or she ("it" is hardly appropriate for a young parrot with a high
degree of awareness and personality) continued to be the model chick; it
then slept less, seemed contented and seldom called for food. This is in
marked contrast to many parrot chicks whose constant vocal demands
for food are made, more often then not, with the crop bulging!
Thenceforth feathering was rapid and the chick was fully feathered by
the end of August, except for the short tail. The heat in the brooder,
which had been reduced to about 70*F (21*C) was discontinued on
8th September (54 days), when he was moved to a wooden weaning cage
with a wire front. Four days later he started to perch. At 69 days he was
moved to a small parrot cage and immediately climbed to the top perch.
He flew for the first time at 77 days, circling the room strongly. He
mastered the technique of flying more quickly and with greater accuracy
than any young parrot that we have previously reared. Within a few days
he had acquired the unusual skills of hovering and low diving.
Before he could fly, he had received much attention, sitting with my
husband each evening, but as soon as he could fly he was neither demand-
ing nor dependent. He liked to fly around the room each evening and to
land on our heads occasionally, but made no other demands, unlike many
hand-reared parrots which crave attention. Neither was he in the least
affectionate. Unable to resist "spoiling" him before he was weaned, I had
feared that he would become very imprinted. But this did not occur. At a
year old "he" will be surgically sexed and, if possible, provided with a
mate.
The rearing of this Amazon never provided a moment's worry (unlike
that of a Queen of Bavaria's Conure being reared at the same time, the
cause of many interrupted nights' sleep) except at about five weeks of age.
I discovered in his mouth a small yellow area with raised spots on it. My
veterinary surgeon took a swab from inside the mouth but laboratory
tests revealed nothing but the presence of E. coli (which presumably is
quite normal). He prescribed Clamoxyl, sweet-tasting drops, one of which
I applied locally and another to the food daily. After a few days of this
treatment, the infected area diminished. I discontinued the drops and a
reoccurrence was apparent. In all the Clamoxyl drops were given for four
weeks - far longer than intended, but this antibiotic appears to be harmless.
In my experience, mouth infections in chicks being hand-reared are
rare; nevertheless, one should make frequent inspections inside the mouth

so that any abnormality can be dealt with before it becomes serious.
The very early age at which our barbadensis acquired near-adult eye
colour was of interest. By the time it was 11 weeks old the iris was orange-
not quite as bright or as clearly defined as that of an adult but quite differ-
ent to the indistinct brownish iris of an unweaned bird.
On the subject of weaning, this was achieved by HVi weeks. The transi-
tion to soaked seed and fruit (pomegranates being preferred) was made
without any difficulty.
In 1982 the Yellow-shouldered Amazon was also bred by the Rev.
Ramon Noegel in Florida, whose successes in breeding Amazons are with-
out parallel. Four young, hatched in June from two pairs, were hand-reared.
Nine eggs were laid (two clutches by one female) and all were fertile. In
September I received coloured photographs of two of these young. One
was very typical of barbadensis (and lacked the blue feathers on the fore-
head found in my young bird, the appearance of the other was most sur-
prising. Facially it resembled an Orange-winged Amazon A. amazonica.

tail made it quite clear that it was a barbadensis - but at a quick glance the
resemblance to amazonica was greater. By chance, some weeks later a
caged Orange-winged Amazon was placed next to my young barbadensis
and once again I was impressed by the similarity of the two birds. This is
not evident in adults - but immature plumage often provides a clue to
ancestry and I believe it possible that amazonica may have played its part
in that of barbadensis.

Amazona collaria
By Mr. and Mrs. J. ARMAN (Cambridgeshire)
We obtained two Yellow-billed Amazon Parrots on 4th August 1979
from an importer in Leicester. The birds were newly out of quarantine,
and had only been released by the Ministry on the previous day.
Description
Believed cock: yellow beak, yellow legs with black toe nails, emerald
green plumage, darker on top and lighter on the underparts. Eye dark
brown with yellow iris. Skin around the eye more prominent than in the
hen. Head narrow and "elongated", flat on top.
Believed hen: horn coloured beak, horn coloured legs with a tinge of
grey with black toe nails. Eye resembles a very young Amazon chick's eye,
i.e. no prominent iris. Plumage a little lighter than in the "cock". Head

rounded, with slightly higher dome.
The birds were placed in a cage in a back bedroom to settle whilst their
aviary was prepared.
On 17th August, having noticed one of the birds producing very loose
droppings, we took it a veterinary surgeon and were advised that the bird
was probably suffering from stress.
The aviary and nest-box being completed, we put the birds in their
indoor quarters on 18th August and they settled in nicely. The following
day they were eating normally but one, which we believed to be the hen,
still had very loose droppings.
On 24th August, the bob-hole to the outside flight was opened, but the
birds did not venture outside.
The following day, the "hen" was fluffed up, and giving cause for con-
cern. We brought it inside and placed the bird in a warm room where we
could keep a close eye on it. Next day saw no improvement and so another
visit was made to our vet. He injected the bird with Vitamin B12 and anti-
biotics to attempt a cure. It was not evident at that time that the bird was
suffering from psittacosis, from which it died on 28th August. A post
mortem carried out on the following day confirmed the disease.
Needless to say, we were very upset to lose the bird so quickly after
acquisition, feeling that we had failed it, but this is a chance one takes
with newly imported birds.
On 8th October the remaining bird, which we believed to be the cock,
was taken ill. No food was eaten, the feathers were fluffed up and the
droppings very watery. Fearing the same fate, we installed the bird in a
hospital cage with a temperature of 90*F and force fed it by syringe for
the next two days in a desperate attempt to prevent another fatality. We
fed a mix of Farex with a pinch of Chloramphenicol antibiotic, warmed to
almost boiling, after mixing with water. By the end of the second day we
were very concerned as the bird showed no sign of improvement so another
visit was made to the vet. An injection of multi-vitamins was
administered.
The next day the bird had improved and was later removed from the
hospital cage and began to crack seed. The droppings were still watery,
but the bird seemed brighter. By the following week, it had recovered
completely. As it was now so late in the year, we decided to winter the
bird indoors.
We were left with this single bird for almost a year, all attempts to
find another having failed, but in October 1980 we were fortunate
enough to be able to exchange a Yellow-crowned Amazon that we had

bred for a Yellow-billed Amazon owned by a private person in Cornwall.
This new bird, which we guessed to be a hen, was very steady and al-
though it would not talk, it did take food from our hands. As it had
previously been kept in a warm kitchen, we had to keep it indoors for
the winter.
On 12th April we installed a nest-box in the flight in which our first
Yellow-bill had spent the winter alone and later that day put the
believed hen in with the believed cock. Our fears that the established
bird might attack the newcomer were unfounded and in fact, the "cock"
made attempts to be friendly by putting his head down for the new bird
to preen.
A week later we noticed the "cock" bird chortling and bouncing back
and forth from one perch to another in a type of display, whilst the "hen"
inspected the nest- box (see drawing). The "cock" bird then regurgitated

to the "hen" and attempted treading but the "hen" was not interested. We
felt that the bird was probably too young. Later in the day one of the birds
was seen coming out of the nest-box.
Two weeks later, the "cock" was again observed displaying, i.e. bounc-
ing from one perch to the nest-box entrance perch, fanning his tail slightly,
and making an enchanting chortling sound, whilst tapping his beak on the
entrance hole. The hen responded by bouncing up alongside him. He then
regurgitated seed, which she accepted, three or four times.
On 3rd May, whilst cleaning out their indoor quarters less than a month
after the birds had been introduced, we heard the familiar sound of
Amazon parrots mating and saw the Yellow-bills treading on a round perch.
Throughout the long wet summer, mating continued, but no eggs were
laid. Again we suspected that the "hen" was too young.
An extremely long cold autumn followed, during which the "hen" be-
gan to pluck out her breast feathers right down to the vent, leaving only a
white underdown, and during the severe winter we were very worried
about her, as she spent long periods in the shelter of the indoor quarters.
In fact, we worried about all our birds that winter as the extreme weather
continued week after week. Happily though, all survived.
During the early spring of 1982 the "cock" began to lose his breast
feathers, leaving a grey underdown, whereas the "hen's" was white.
The pair looked very untidy but spring brought fine weather and they
were observed at regular intervals carrying on their mating rituals. Again
and again the "cock" would hop onto the threshold of the nest hole, then
hop back on to the perch. The "hen" would peer into the nest-box without
entering until eventually the cock ventured inside and chortled, apparently
calling the hen. Some weeks of this behaviour passed before both birds
eventually began to go in and out of the nest-box with ease. Mating took
place regularly at this time.
At the same time, our Yellow-winged and Yellow-crowned Amazons
were also mating, and all three pairs could be heard emitting their low
rhythmic moan as mating progressed.
As with the larger species of Amazon parrots, the Yellow-billed also
flick their wings prior to mating, but a lot of bickering and beak spar-
ring also takes place, which has not been observed in the larger birds.
On 1st June, because the hen was plucked underneath, it could be
seen that a large bulge was prominent in the area of the vent and she
began spending longer periods in the nest box. The next day we found
one egg in the nest-box; it was about the size of a dove's, white in colour
and perfectly elliptical in shape. The hen spent the night in the nest-box.

By 4th June there was still only one egg although the hen had a pro-
nounced bulge. On 6th June there were two eggs in the nest; the hen
was restless and stayed indoors all night. The following day there were
three eggs; the cock stayed in the indoor quarters, the hen in the nest-
box though she kept popping out at regular intervals, and they did the
same the following night. By 10th June the hen was sitting tight on the
nest.
On 19th June two eggs were missing with no trace of the shells. The
remaining egg was apparently fertile.
On the night of 2nd July the hen was startled off the nest by a noise.
She went into the indoor quarters where she remained for 1 l A hours. The
night was quite cold and in desperation we rigged up a spotlight in the
garden to aid her back to the nest. Eventually she returned, but we
feared the egg would not hatch due to the chill. However, on 4th July
a chick was found in the nest, 27 days after the hen began incubation.
The following day the chick looked satisfactory on inspection at
5.15 p.m., though the hen left the nest at regular intervals agitating
the cock which bounced to and from the nest perch, urging the hen to
return. At 9.00 p.m. the chick was found to have three toes bitten off
the right foot and two nails from the left foot - we do not know which
parent had done this. The wing tips were also bitten and badly bruised
and so was the back of the neck. There was hardly any food in the crop.
The chick measured 60 mm.
The chick was immediately removed and placed in a margarine tub
filled with whitewood and cedar shavings covered by tissue paper. The
tub was put in a box, heated by an ordinary 40 watt light bulb under a
false platform. The temperature varied between 90-100*F, so a 25 watt
bulb was inserted instead. This kept the temperature around 90*F. The
chick wriggled almost continuously.
Having no strained baby food in store, we made a mix of Farex and
ground down sunflower seed which proved unsuitable as it stuck in the
crop and the chick was unable to digest it. It ate greedily from a syringe
every three hours but the food was not passing very quickly. The next
day it was fed on strained baby food only, heated to almost boiling, and
fed from a bent spoon. The chick pumped hungrily and cheeped for hours.
For the next few days we continued to feed the chick every three hours
and it learned to make a loud noise at feeding time, also squeaking for
about 20 minutes after being fed. On 8th July it weighed PA oz.
By 12th July it was sitting up and, when asleep, lying on its side.
On 14th July it weighed 3 oz; it was still being fed every three hours,

and we were adding 50% Milupa to the feed, mixed to a soft dropping
consistency. At 16 days old we added 50% ground sunflower seed. The
eyes and ears were fully open on 30th July and the pin feathers breaking
through; the feed was given every four hours. At 34 days it was trying
to preen its feathers and was almost able to stand up unaided. The next
day it weighed 6 ozs and we began adding ground peanuts to the feed in
the ratio of 2:1 Milupa-sunflower/peanuts. At 42 days it weighed 9 Vi ozs,
the feather heads were pushing through the quills and we cut the feeds
back to every five hours.
During the next two weeks we cut the feeds back to every six hours
with the last feed at 11.30 p.m. and the first at 7.0 a.m. The chick was
transferred from the heated box into a cardboard box half filled with
shavings to encourage it to exercise its toes. By 1st September the feeds
had been further reduced to two a day, morning and night and hard
seeds and peanuts were given. The chick was wormed. By 9th September
the flight feathers were completely formed and the bill beginning to
turn blackish across the top, and the sides and lower mandible were a
mustardy shade of yellow. At 74 days old the chick was fully feathered
and able to fly unaided. It was regurgitating almost all its food now and
eating more and more from the hard seed. We cut back to one feed a
day, late at night, but more was still regurgitated than left in the crop.
The chick said "Hallo" for the first time.
On 22nd September (80 days) the chick was fully independent and
flying well. It would no longer take rearing food and its crop was quite
full with hard seed; it was also having apple and cake.
It may be of interest that, since hatching the chick, the parents have
regrown all their plumage and are once more in beautiful feather.
As described, the Jamaican Yellow-billed Amazon Parrot Amazona collaria
has been reared by Mr. and Mrs. J. Arman and this is believed to be the first success
in this country. Anyone knowing of a previous breeding in Great Britain or Nor-
thern Ireland, or any other reason that would disqualify this claim, is asked to inform
the Hon. Secretary.

Two pairs of Siy Parrots were privately imported into Sweden in May
1978. Initially both pairs were housed in the aviaries of an experienced
parrot breeder, Mr. Alf Sundstrom, as the actual owner of the birds, Mr.
J--A Alvarsson, was to be stationed abroad for at least another year or so.
On a short visit to inspect Mr. Sundstrom's collection in November of that
year, I had the good fortune to see these very nice and uncommon parrots
for the first time. However, due to shortage of aviary accommodation, Mr.
Sundstrom reluctantly had to house one of the pairs elsewhere. Thus in
October 1979 (and with Mr. Alvarsson's kind permission), the birds were
transferred to my aviaries.
The Siy Parrots have been housed in a 7 ft. aviary in my birdroom,
connected with a 12 ft. outdoor flight, facing south. A quarter is roofed
over with fibreglass and the floor is gravelled. This is the first in a block of
eight identical parrot aviaries. All of them are double-wired and furnished
with some dead oak and ash tree branches. The latter unfortunately
quickly lose their bark, becoming very slippery, but are easily replaced. On
the other hand, oak perches may last for ten years or more. A 2 ft. hollow
log was hung vertically in a corner of the Siy Parrots' flight in March 1980.
This log has a short, natural spout entrance. On the bottom concave I put
a large handful of coarse wood splinters - actually those dug out by the
Black Woodpecker Dryocopos martins. These splinters are collected
around ant-infested tree stumps in the forest. For the 1980 breeding
season the Siy Parrots shared their aviary with a pair of Azara's Conures,
but these were later removed, being replaced by a pair of Virginian Cardi-
nals.
Towards the end of April 1980 the hen Siy laid a clutch of four eggs,
three of which were fertile. A chick was heard squeaking on 22nd May and
a week later there were three. They grew rapidly and on 6th July the first
was looking out of the log. It left the nest on 14th July, followed by two
more five days later. The young Siy Parrots were a little clumsy at first but
were perfect specimens, almost as large as their parents. All three had
brick-red frontal bands, thus indicating their sex - females. The young
parrots did not moult in 1980 but somehow the red frontal feathers
gradually disappeared, being replaced by blackish ones. By the end of the
year, the last red feathers were gone.

In 1981 the hen laid a good clutch of five eggs, one of which was
addled. The first chick hatched on 17th May, was looking out on 8th July
and fledged three days later. The remaining three fledged on 16th, 18th
and 24th July. These young birds had blackish frontal bands and I suspect
them to be all males.
Meanwhile, Mr. Sundstrom's pair had made two unsuccessful breeding
attempts; in 1979 their three fertile eggs did not hatch and in 1980 they
hatched but deserted three chicks out of four eggs. In 1981 the pair had a
late clutch of five eggs in June and this time the three chicks that hatched
were reared to perfection, being a cock and two hens. The fourth egg was
addled and the fifth infertile.
In 1981 my three young females, bred in the year before, were moved
to another aviary together with a cock Sun Conure of similar age. In June
they suddenly showed signs of coming into breeding condition, despite the
fact that there was no log present; young Amazon Parrots, I am told,
behave exactly the same way. At first the conure was a little confused but
it was not long before he started to feed the Siy Parrots and I have actually
seen him mate with all of them! However, at the onset of their first
(complete) moult in July, the Siy Parrots became increasingly indifferent
to the conure. I then tried to introduce some young Azara's Conures with
no success. These agile and highly intelligent parrots soon became the
"masters" of the aviary and had to be removed. Indeed, I have seen the
parents of these conures attacking my Yellow-winged Amazon Parrots
Amazona aestiva xanthopteryx !
In October 1981 the young Siy Parrots were all put together in a
separate aviary and a month later, Mr. Alvarsson, whose aviaries were by
now completed, collected the parent birds as well as a young pair. Mr.
Sundstrom's remaining two young birds - a pair - were put together with
my own flock in November, and hopefully two new pairs will form.
Although there are a few pairs and some odd birds of P.m. maximiliani in
Sweden, these will not be used.
The young Siy Parrots are a joy to watch. Although not tame, they
show no fear of people they know, coming right up to the wire for tit-bits.
They are marvellous fliers. Surprisingly, they spend a lot of time on the
ground.
I feed my Siy Parrots on a simple diet of home-made softfood, soaked
seed (Hungarian sunflower seed, safflower, hemp and wheat), fruit and
greenfood. They are not very fond of corn-on-the-cob and do not take dry
seed (with the exception of small amounts of Sunflower). Black currants,
hawthorn berries and the small, hard "nuts" of Hornbeam are fed when

available. The parent birds reared their young on softfood, soaked seed,
green oats, seeding grasses and chickweed. These parrots drink very little,
presumably because they are fed apples twice daily. For some weeks
before laying, the female ate large amounts of cuttlefish "bone".

SURGICAL SEXING OF BIRDS: SOME OBSERVATIONS

By GEORGE A. SMITH (Peterborough)
In aviculture nothing appears to be cheap anymore: birds, food, build-
ing materials for aviaries, or labour. Self-interest continually induces bird-
keepers to become bird-breeders. Frequently an owner is unable to main-
tain a collection unless the birds (through the sale of their offspring) pay
some of the expenses. In which economic circumstances pairs of birds are
assets; whereas two of like sex, together, are liabilities. Sexing has become
a necessity for such folk and for those who have rare species. The sexes of
waterfowl, ratites, and newly-hatched game birds can be determined by
examining the cloaca. Sexually-dimorphic birds are self-evident. Some
people will have trouble with passerines (perching birds); but in the breed-
ing season (three months at least of the year) the cloacae of male passer-
ines stick out whilst those of hens are far less protruberant. This sex-indi-
cator, that is so well known to canary breeders, surprisingly is unknown to
the majority of breeders of other finches, starlings, tanagers and the like.
The birds must be caught and hand-held to determine this.
The two absolutely reliable ways of settling the gender of sexually
monomorphic birds are by karyotopy (examination of the chromosomal
compliment of stained cells under the microscope) and endoscopy (exa-
mination of the gonads by looking at them within the abdominal cavity).
The first method may be too esoteric for the layman and endoscopy does
require a knowledge of anatomy and, in this country, the administration
of an anaesthetic. (In America I have seen endoscopy "kits" demonstra-
ted and sold at an avicultural convention). Karyotypy, while perfectly safe
- the bird still has to be caught for a skin scraping to be taken - is some-
what protracted and (this is certainly so within my veterinary practice)

G.A. SMITH - SURGICAL SEXING OF BIRDS
tends to be used only with fat, or otherwise unhealthy birds or those that
are inordinately rare or where the owner is anxious about anaesthetic and
surgical risks. Endoscopy is rapid and safe. Using gaseous anaesthesia (we
have abandoned injectable anaesthetics as being unreliable and too trau-
matic) a throughput of between 20 and 30 birds an hour is easily achieved.
With birds larger than lovebirds (i.e. more than 60 grams - 2 oz) mortality
is consistently below 1%.
Some observations I have made during the course of this work might
prove interesting to others. In all birds the pigmentation of the feathers,
skin and eyes is affected by sex-hormones. Male owls tend to be paler than
their mates. Well-known examples of this are the Snowy Owl Nyctea
scandica and the Barn Owl Tyto alba where the cocks can be very white
indeed. In performing endoscopy I have consistently found that male
Long-eared and Short-eared Owls Asio otus and A, flammeus carry less
pigmentation than hens. This is especially so on the parts covered by the
folded wings, though it also is found, to a lesser degree, on the face and
breast. When individuals of these two owls are held in the hand and care-
fully examined, those that have near white, paler axillary and underwing
feathers have proved to be cocks and those with a browner, darker colour
are hens. In verification of this a visit to the Natural History Museum at
Tring was made. It was substantiated and further examination showed
that it also apples to most, if not all, of the other species in this same
genus (Asio). I did not have the time to check this for other owl genera.
Yet whatever the biological advantage there must be for male owls to
have whiter feathers than females, it may not apply for Scops Owls, for
of the ten or so that I have "endoscoped", I could not correlate their
appearance before or after with their sex.
Dr. Susan Clubb, who has an exceptional experience of sexing
parrots by surgical means, has told me that male Grey Parrots Psittacus
erithacus erithacus (from the same wild-caught consignment of imports
and, therefore, presumably from the same geographical area) are noti-
ceably darker on the wings and body than are the hens. This has also been
my experience: they can be sexed on sight. Whether this observation
applies for immature birds is not known (likewise for the owls mentioned
above) as so few fledged young have been definitely sexed before they
undergo their first moult. In the much smaller Timneh Grey Parrot P.e.
timneh the sexes are indistinguishable: both being the same very dark
charcoal grey.

It is generally accepted that for most white cockatoos, i.e. species
of Cacatua, adult females have brown, and males black irides. This is not
an invariable rule. Two of my breeding male Roseates C roseicapilla
have brown eyes: admittedly they are not quite as pale nor as pinky
looking as those of the hens. The other two have the "orthodox" black
eye. Coincidentally, all the males have much whiter caps to the head than
the hens - this feature, again, is not universal to all cock Roseates. However,
they can usually be sexed with reasonable reliability by the width of the
bill. Recently I acquired a "cock" Roseate that had been the caged pet of
an immigrant Australian who, after six years, had decided to go back home
and was prohibited by law from taking his bird back with him. This
Roseate's beak was female-narrow, the crown of the head fairly pink with
coal-black eyes. On endoscopy it was proved to be a female. Likewise
three black-eyed Lesser Sulphur-crested Cockatoos C. sulphurea that I
have sexed were demonstrated to be hens. In each case, their sex had been
inferred by the owner from the behaviour of their mates. Moluccan
Cockatoos C. moluccensis which are almost invariably said (e.g. Miss
Rosemary Low's "Parrots: Their Care and Breeding") to have sexually
dichromatic eyes may actually have many hens with "male" eyes. (I
cannot give a percentage for black eyes: it is unlikely that brown-eyed
hens would be subject to sexing procedures; but I would not be sur-
prised if there were as many black-eyed as brown-eyed ones). An owner,
having just heard that three of his supposed four males actually were hens
and his confidence shaken concerning eye colour, asked me to "endo-
scope' his one brown-eyed bird. As expected this was a hen but, from the
size of its ovary, it was the least mature of the four. As the majority of the
other black-eyed Moluccan hens that I have surgically sexed, from their
history, were some years old, I cannot believe that brown eyes indicate a
greater sexual maturity. Indeed with the Leadbeater's Cockatoo C. lead-
beat eri that we breed, the hen's irides gets its brownish distinction be-
tween three months and six months after fledging, usually the former.
Lastly I have heard it said that surgically-sexed birds will not breed so
readily as "unmutilated" birds. Most birds are forbidden to breed, their
owners preventing them, by some serious defect of management, so this
would be difficult to prove. I doubt that slight surgical injury to the flank
is of any consequence. This year I have had two hen Caiques Pionites ,
which had never bred before, lay fertile eggs (and rear the chicks) within a
month of sexing.

Dromaius novaehollandiae
By ING. STRUZKA MILOS (Zoo Lesna, Czechoslovakia)
The Emu was first imported into Europe in the last century and rela-
tively large numbers of these birds are now established in zoos. Although
many zoos still experience some problems with their breeding, Zoo Lesna
has successfully bred the Emu in substantial numbers for over half a
century.
The aim of this paper is to report the breeding of the Emu under the
conditions of Zoo Lesna, and is limited to our own observations. This
paper is only a brief summary of a much larger study.
I have observed 22 egg-laying sessions of the Emu during the years
1967-1975 and have partial notes on six more from the years 1954-1967.
Data on measurements of an additional five eggs was obtained from a
collection of the Regional Museum of South-eastern Moravia and date on
21 more eggs was compiled by Dr. J. Krumbiegl from Lesna in the 1940s.
Over a period of eight years I have completed observations on 399 eggs
from five pairs referred to below as "A, B, C, D and E". Pairs D and E
were under observation by me only during one egg-laying season.
A: Male hatched at Lesna in about 1949
Female hatched in Holland in about 1965-66
B: Male hatched at Lesna in 1968 from pair A
Female hatched in West Germany in about 1963-64
C: Siblings bred at Lesna from pair A in 1968
D: Male bred at Lesna in 1973
Female bred at Lesna in 1968 and a previous member of pair C
E: Male bred at Lesna in 1968 and a previous member of pair C
Female imported in the spring of 1974 from Holland as an
adult
Incomplete records exist about an additional 58 eggs, where I recorded
only the weight. There are also records of 10 more eggs from Bratislava
Zoo which were incubated at Lesna in 1975.

Warm eggs were collected for incubation at the shortest possible time
after laying, stored in a room at a temperature of 8-12*C, regularly turned
and then placed under a male bird or in an incubator. All the eggs were
measured, weighed and the exact time of laying was recorded. Weight
change of only a few eggs was recorded during the storage period. Detailed
records were made of the length of incubation and weight of newly hatched
chicks. In 1974 temperature measurements were taken at the nest under
two male birds. In 1969 my associate and I observed post embryonic
development up to 11 months of age, which will be reported elsewhere.
The most interesting pair was B of which the female had unusually
large clutches and occasional double eggs. In 1970-71 female B laid a
double egg as her 34th. The weight was 929 g, length 182.5 mm and width
was taken at three points - at the largest perimeter of each of the two
connected eggs and at a point of their connection. The dimensions were
94-91.5 and 93.4 mm and volume was 840 ml. The average egg volume
from the same female was about 500 ml. In the 1971-72 season, the 32nd
egg was double and it weighed 850 g. It did not have an obvious light
dividing line as in the preceeding year. Its length was 175 mm and width
89 mm. In the year 1972-73 no double eggs were laid and two large eggs
were laid without any markings suggesting that they consisted of two eggs.

They were egg No. 35 which weighed 718 g, was 146.7 mm long and
92.4 mm wide, and egg No. 36 which weighed 690 g, was 153 mm long
and 89.4 mm wide. One egg was put under the male bird and the other
into an incubator. Neither hatched. Taking into consideration that the
female's total egg production during a season of three and a half months
was about a half of her weight, her physical and nutritional condition
remained surprisingly good.
Feed was provided as a moist granular mix in the morning and after-
noon. The feed was composed of an albumin mix for poultry, wheat husk,
wheat and rye mash, shredded apples and beets, shredded carrots, cottage
cheese, ground boiled meat, chopped hard-boiled eggs, dried potatoes, rye
sprouts, dry powdered nettles, mineral supplement and fish liver oil. The
mix was moistened with normal or sour milk and all its components were
well blended together. In the second half of the laying season more mineral
supplements and dried chicken egg shells were added. Also once a week a
boiled feed and bread cubes were provided. Fresh water was consumed in
great quantities even during the winter.
It is interesting to compare clutches from female A during her first few
years of laying. At the time of her first egg she was about three years old.
The low weight of the eggs (average 369 g) and the very thin, smooth,
whitish shell of two eggs in the first clutch and then of one egg in the
second clutch indicate that it was her first lay. In the first clutch ? egg
weights were not the same; the maximum difference between them was
about 40% of the average egg weight. The second clutch contained sub-
stantially heavier eggs (average 477 g) and the weight increased slightly in
subsequent clutches but at a slower rate. Also the weight differences were
becoming smaller. The size and weight of eggs from this female stabilised
between the sixth and seventh clutches (average 532 g).
From records taken of the laying seasons since 1954, it can be seen
that the starting date of the laying season has slowly moved towards
autumn, but the length of each season remains unchanged. The average
length of the laying season from 1954-1967 was 71.83 days. During the
years 1968-75 it was 80.22 days. This was affected by three unusually
large clutches laid over a longer period by female B. If these are excluded
the average length for both periods would be about the same. The average
length of all 28 laying seasons was 78.42 days. The late start of the egg-
laying season is unfavourable for successful rearing because the chicks
hatch in the winter, when the conditions for rearing and feeding are more
difficult and complicated.

recorded from 1954 to 1967, varied between one to 47 days with an
average of eight days. During 1968-75 the interval for 22 clutches was
one to 27 days with an average of 4.5 days. The average interval for all
28 observed laying seasons is slightly more than five days. We can con-
clude, therefore, that during later years the intervals were shorter and
more even. The unpredictably long time lapses between individual eggs
are interesting. There are not so many of them, but the deviations are
so great that they affect the average intervals of lay and prolong the
laying season. Some of the females have only one long interval; some
have two to three. So far no pattern has been found.
The number of eggs laid varies not only between years but between
each female. In 1954-67 the average clutch was 9.66 eggs and in the
years 1968-75 it was 18.36 eggs. For all the 28 observed clutches, the
average is 16.5 eggs. The number of eggs increased, therefore, during
the last few years.
In the past the eggs at Lesna were weighed only occasionally and so
from 1964-65 we have records only for 16 eggs from two females. The
average was 427.5 g ranging from 320 to 470 g. Later on, all eggs were
recorded. The optimum weight of an Emu egg is hard to determine but
should presumably be close to those laid in Australia. However, even
from the very small eggs hatched in 1968 there grew very healthy and
fertile birds, as we observed them later on during their own egg-laying
hatching and breeding. From heavy eggs heavier chicks are hatched and
they also grow faster, but at maturity there is no obvious size difference.
Eggs for incubation were set for one to 58 days; 58 days was the
oldest egg which was successfully hatched in 1969. It was intended to
hatch the eggs as soon as possible if conditions permitted - willingness of
the males to sit, availability of incubators or sufficient number of eggs.
No connection between the length of incubation and the age of eggs was
found; only the fact that the eggs which were put under males that were
already sitting were the first to hatch. The average incubation period is
53.71 days, with a range of 47 to 63 days. Some of the longer incubation
times were due to the fact that chicks were too weak to crack the shell
and had to be helped by various means. Results from electric incubation
were worse than from sitting males but then the eggs in the incubator
were usually worse quality and older than those placed under males.
Around the 40th day of incubation, eggs were placed into warm water
and it was observed that healthy eggs "moved". Later, to avoid wetting
the eggs, we placed them on a piece of glass and observed them move.
Several times during these observations the eggs were weighed, and it

was found that the eggs without movement were either infertile or the
embryo was dead and the average drop in weight was 9.58%. Moving eggs
recorded a drop in weight of 13.2% which may be due to gas and water
exchange during their growth. This could be a valuable method for rapid
accurate sorting of eggs being hatched.
Egg fertility varied during different years for different pairs. Some
pairs reached higher percentages of fertility, 85-100% for pair A, but pairs
B and C reached only 60-80%. The lower rate was usually the rule for
first clutches from young pairs and for young birds.
There is a correlation between the weight of eggs and successfully
hatched chicks. At Lesna it ranged from 223 to 510 g with a mean of
381.01 g. Water loss during storage was measured on 50 eggs. The average
loss was 0.246 g for 24 hours. Average storage time was 22 days with a
minimum of three and maximum of 42 days, which is a relatively long
period and causes a large water loss.
In 1975, one male incubated ten eggs starting on 2nd March. Because
after three weeks two eggs had to be removed from the nest, we decided
to substitute them with new ones. This happened on 27th March. The
male sat peacefully and on 22nd and 23rd April the chicks from the eight
original eggs began to hatch. The male sat one more day but became restless
and the other eggs had to be removed and placed into the incubator where
they were hatched on 15th and 16th May. This experiment verified the ob-
servation made in 1964 when the male sat on ten eggs, later found to be
infertile, for a full 78 days. In our case, the chirping of chicks ended the
incubation time for the male and he did not show any interest in the two
remaining eggs.
In the laying season 1973-74, the temperature of eggs was recorded at
two nests and occasionally at a third one. An instant measuring electric
thermometer and later a special medical thermometer were used for taking
the temperature between the eggs. The temperature was taken between
7-10 a.m. and 1-2 p.m., sometimes even at 4-5 p.m. Due to technical
reasons it was not possible to record the temperature at the same time
during everv laving, season. The lowest temperature recorded was 30.0*C
the highest 38.0*C, with a mean average of 34.46*C.
The temperature of the nest was also taken, but only when the male
was preparingf for sitting on a special floor consisting of blown-out egg
shells filled with a mixture of gypsum and wood dust so that their weight
coincided with the weight of the average egg. Here the temperature did not
exceed 28.0*C during this preparation period, which varied from five to
ten days for individual birds. Starting with the 53rd day the freshly

hatched chicks were taken out from the nests but the males stayed sitting
until the 55th day when the rest of the unhatched eggs were removed and
the hatching period ended.
Conclusions
1) It is not desirable to breed Emus in adjoining pens. They disturb each
other when mating, laying and incubating. A similar problem can arise if
young birds are kept in adjoining pens during the laying season. A separa-
tion distance of 40 m was found adequate. Even when the birds could see
and hear each other at this distance it did not disturb their activities.

tions were made, the clutches and egg weights increased with time. This is
probably connected to the fact that the beginning of the laying season
moved by four to eight weeks towards autumn, so that females were in
better physical and nutritional condition.
3) Large clutches did not have any adverse effects on the females. On the
diet provided they continued to produce large quantities of apparently
normal eggs. But the fertility of larger clutches was obviously lower than
of average or smaller clutches.
4) It is not possible to determine an optimum number of eggs in a clutch
to achieve maximum fertility, hatching and survival rates.
5) To achieve comparable results with artificial incubation, a detailed
study of temperatures under sitting males is required.
6) The structure, shape and colour of eggs is constant during the lifetime
of each female. These characteristics can identify which female laid the eggs.

THE JACK ROUGH COLLECTION
</sectionHeader>

By. F.C. BARNICOAT (Johannesburg, South Africa)
In bird-keeping circles the name of J.B. Rough is known all over
southern Africa. After almost a lifetime of bird-keeping he and his wife
opened "Parrots' Paradise" to the public some 13 years ago on their farm
just outside Rustenburg. Situated about 75 miles north-west of Johannes-
burg, Rustenburg is nearly 2,000 feet lower in altitude and has a sub-tropi-
cal, frost-free climate and lies in the heart of an important citrus-growing
area. Sadly "Parrots' Paradise" has had to be closed to the general public
for several years. Rocketing petrol prices and the closing of fuel stations
over weekends led to fewer visitors to the park and the stage was reached
where it was no longer worthwhile to keep the park open to the public.
Jack Rough will never be without birds, however, and I was privileged
recently to pay him a private visit and be shown the many species of
parrots and doves which he continues to keep and breed in his vast ranges
of aviaries and the huge walk-through wilderness aviary, 30 x 28 x 3 metres
high, rising to 6 metres in the centre, which was formerly the most
attractive show-piece of the park and in which nearly every South African

estrildid and fringillid bred successfully.
Jack Rough was always interested in birds and mammals generally and
his bird collection formerly embraced all groups. He bred the Yellow-billed
Hornbill three times in one unit of a range of parrakeet aviaries. The pair
made use of a "grandfather-clock" type nest-box and the male sealed the
hen inside by plastering mud around the rather large entrance hole. Various
toucans were kept for years, though without breeding results. Other soft-
bills, like the Glossy and Plum-coloured Starling throve in the larger
wilderness aviary and the Superb Starling Spreo superbus bred in a nest-
box fastened near the top of one of the more central supporting poles of
the aviary. Even in such extensive accommodation the aggressive attitude
of all species of starling proved a problem and placed very disappointing
limits to what could be kept in the large aviary. Surprisingly aggression was
still more of a problem with the sunbirds and the ambition to house and
possibly breed a representative collection of this gorgeous group of African
birds in near natural surroundings was doomed to failure from the start.
Although most of the species thrive on nectar mixture made of honey,
Bovril and Complan (a proprietary comprehensive food based on dried
skimmed milk) and become delightfully tame, only one male can be
housed per aviary. Even towards other species certain male sunbirds may
prove aggressive. In the wilderness aviary numerous Madagascar Lovebirds
began to be found dead for no apparent reason until the Malachite Sunbird
was seen to cling on to the tail of a Lovebird as it flew round and round
the aviary in desperation until it crashed into the wire, breaking its neck.
Certain factors, apart from the closing of the park to the public, have
led to the reduction of the collection:
1. Bees pose a constant threat in this area. Swarms are almost constantly
seeking shelter from the hot sun and a nest-box in an aviary shelter is an
irresistible attraction. Young and adult birds of any species in the aviary of
the bees' fancy are stung to death. In particular the bees go for the birds'
eyes. The spring months of September and October are usually the worst
for such attacks. The feeding of nectar mixtures and fruit is so attractive
to bees and has led to fatalities to such an extent that the lorikeet group
in particular as well as softbill species in general have had to be dispensed
with.
2. Rats are practically impossible to keep at bay. In particular, the
wilderness aviary provided a happy hunting ground for them. The vegeta-
tion has had to be drastically thinned out. The small birds in particular
fall prey to the rats. The larger parrots in nearly bare aviaries are more res-

istant to the depredations of these pests. An interesting project in which
Patagonian Conures were provided with natural nests in which they could
burrow into an earth mound supported by a concrete wall with nesting
holes had very soon to be abandoned because of infestation by rats.
3. The unprocurability of new blood for several rare species has led to
their becoming infertile and doomed to die out, notable examples being
the Galapagos Dove, the breeding results of which highly worthwhile
species were encouragingly successful for many years but only to gradually
lose fertility to the point where at present a last unproductive pair survives,
and the Madagascar Lovebird, the formerly prolific stock of which seems
likely to go the same way.
4) The reliance on a single successful breeding pair has in certain in-
stances led to the disappearance of the species from the collection. Com-
patability is a vital factor in bird breeding. Occasionally one is lucky enough
to strike the outstanding breeding pair, such as Jack Rough's famous pair
of Eclectus Parrots, which he kept for over 30 years and from which he
raised over a hundred offspring to be sold all over southern Africa. Recently
this pair died, the cock within a short time of the hen, and thus has
disappeared a species for which this collection was well known. Likewise
an old breeding pair of Alexandrine Parakeets, whose offspring were legion,
has died. It is not always easy to strike another ideally compatible pair,
and the temptation not to hold back sufficient of the young ones until it
is too late is great.
5) The restrictions imposed by the Department of Nature Conservation
on all native species make it difficult or impossible to assemble a worth-
while collection of local birds or to embark upon any interesting experi-
ment even under the most favourable and near natural conditions with any
but the simplest and commonest species.
Accordingly at present the collection embodies mainly the two groups
to which Jack Rough was always particularly attracted, and which seem
the most suitable for the existing conditions - parrots and doves. However,
two species outside this range still have a place: a thriving flock of Vultur-
ine Guineafowl, which has been breeding for 19 years and from which 22
chicks were reared in 1979 and four in 1980, many successfully foster-
re are d under bantams, and several pairs of Malay Crested Fireback Pheas-
ants (Vieillot's), which have bred and should have the potential to do es-
pecially well in this warm to hot climate. In general, pheasants and water-
fowl are poorly represented in South African collections and I had not
previously encountered any species of Fireback in this country, where
they would probably prove easier subjects to breed than in the colder

European countries.
Five species of macaw have bred recently: Blue and Yellow, Scarlet,
Military, Illiger's and Yellow-collared. A 44-gallon metal drum placed on
the ground is the usual nesting site provided for the larger macaws, which
will reduce any wooden box or barrel to matchwood in no time. The
smaller species like the Illiger's seem easier to breed and the Yellow-
collared have proved particularly prolific. Two pairs were incubating at
the time of my visit (November 1981), the hen of the one pair being the
daughter of the other, making a second generation breeding of this
macaw a possibility within a comparatively short period.
A character I missed from the collection was "Bonny", the free-
flying, tame Blue and Yellow Macaw, hand-reared like so many other
macaws, cockatoos and other large parrots by Mrs. Rough, whose meticu-
lous devotion to the task was almost invariably rewarded by an end result
of top quality. Visitors were always entranced by the wonderful sight of
this great, colourful bird wheeling in flight over the park and showing up
so well against the green background of the trees. He would often fly'to
a shop a mile or so away, where he would receive some tidbit. It is thought
that his totally unexpected death must have been brought about by his
being fed something harmful by the public.
Still in the collection are the following cockatoo species: Moluccan,
Umbrella, Lesser Sulphur-crested, Citron-crested and Bare-eyed or Little
Corella. All have been bred at one time or another. Leadbeater's was
never bred and is no longer in the collection.
Four very fine Many-coloured Parakeets had just left the nest. They
seem to be early nesters. Red-rumped and Crimson-winged Parakeets
breed well, as do Golden-mantled, Mealy and Crimson Rosellas.
The Poicephalus Parrots have always been a speciality with Jack Rough.
He first bred the Meyer's nearly 50 years ago and still has several breeding
pairs. The rare Rueppell's has also bred very well over many years and is
still represented in the collection. Senegal Parrots continue to breed year
after year and Jardine's have also been rewarding nesters. However, Jack
Rough gives pride of place to the stock of genuine, pure Cape or Knysna
Parrots which is steadily being built up. They are P.r. robustus, the sub-
species with the southernmost distribution, and show no trace of the
pinkish red on the forehead which characterises the Cape Parrot from
further north, i.e. P.r. suahelicus from Mozambique, and eastern Zim-
babwe northwards. Two hens were kept for over ten years and thousands
of miles were travelled in search of a genuine male. The prospective

sellers merely had a Cape Parrot of the northern race suahelicus or a
Jardine's to offer. At last a man from Louis Trichardt in the northern
Transvaal visited "Parrots' Paradise" and claimed that he had a Knysna
Parrot male which he had had to mate to a Jardine's female and from
which union there had been no breeding results. This time the long jour-
ney was worthwhile and within a month the Knysna hen was on eggs.
This first,clutch proved infertile, but soon the pair was breeding again.
Two chicks hatched, but had to be hand-reared after starting to feather.
Subsequently they have been excellent parents and have themselves
reared broods of one, two and recently of three fine young.
Of the Asiatic parakeets the little Malabar is the favourite. They are
excellent breeders and the female with her black beak forms a lovely
contrast to the male with his red beak. The Indian and African sub-
species of the Ring-neck are bred and Plum-headed, Alexandrine, Mous-
tached and Derbyan Parakeets.
Rough was the first South African to breed the Golden or Queen of
Bavaria's Conure. After rearing a brood of two, the hen was tragically
poisoned when accidentally fed grass that had been sprayed while she
was rearing three chicks, only one of which was successfully hand-reared.
Probably there was no female among the offspring and the last of these
rarities were sold. Other conures that have done well include the Sun,
Jandaya, Golden-capped, Black-headed, Maroon-bellied, Red-fronted,
Brown-eared and Green.
It is to be hoped that an outstanding pair of Mealy Amazons will in
due course produce offspring. Blue-fronted, Spectacled and Double
Yellow-headed Amazons have all been bred. Much disappointment atten-
ded all efforts to secure a mate for the fine Dufresne's or Blue-cheeked
Amazon which was in the collection for several years. In the end this
interesting bird was parted with.
Finally, to touch briefly on the doves, which were always such a
strong point of the Rough collection, it was disappointing to note the
disappearance of so many species, among them both Bartlett's and Luzon
Bleeding-heart Pigeons and the delightful little Plumed Dove, which
nearly bred some years back. However, thriving stocks of the Emerald-
spotted Wood-Dove, Blue-spotted Wood-Dove and, in particular, the
Black-billed Blue-spotted Wood--Dove, the close relative hailing from
north of the Equator, are still maintained. It was good to note breeding
pairs of Scaly and Inca Doves, Tambourines and Namaquas, Amboina
Cuckoo-Doves and Picazuro Pigeons among others. The Galapagos Doves
were an attractive sight, possibly not to be repeated much longer, as

explained above.
While speaking of the Columbidae, it may be interesting to readers
overseas that I had earlier in the morning obtained several excellent
views of the Rock or Speckled Pigeon Columba guinea and the Rameron
or Olive Pigeon Columba arquatrix in the wild at the nearby holiday
resort of Rustenburg Kloof. Several pairs of the former were nesting on
the inaccessible rock ledges in the kloof and the Rameron Pigeons were
easily identified in the tops of tall trees by their conspicuous yellow beaks.

I encountered this parrot many times in a small section of sand-belt
forest in south-eastern Guyana, visited monthly between 1970 and 1973.
Apart from odd sightings of apparently solitary individuals, it was
generally seen either in pairs or, quite often, in larger groups of up to five
individuals. Observed in each month of the year, no seasonal fluctuation in
numbers was detected. Its population density in this area was about the
same as that of Deroptyus accipitrinus .

E. McLOUGHLIN - BLACK-HEADED CAIQUE
Field characters
Visually this is a small parrot with fairly narrow shoulders, a rather
large head and frequently, when excited, a bold upright stance.
The only white-bellied parrot in the region, this characteristic helps to
separate it, particularly from the rather similarly coloured, but green-
bellied Pionopsitta caica (Caica Parrot) as well as other species.
Its short-tailed silhouette is very different from that of the long-
tailed Deroptyus accipitrinus (Fan Parrot or Hawk-headed Parrot) whose
voice and habits are, in general, quite similar.
Commonly heard rather than seen, its most specific call seemed to be
uttered when slightly disturbed. This call, an arresting, often repeated
"keeya-keeya", resembled closely the corresponding call of D. accipitrinus.
The call of P. melanocephala is frequently prefixed by a characteristic,
fairly long "ee-keeya-keeya", while D. accipitrinus regularly intersperses its
call with a short "tak", e.g. "heeya-heeya, tak-heeya".
It was seen and heard on a number of occasions, typically in a group of
two or more birds. Sometimes perched 20 or more feet apart, they enga-
ged in a sort of conversation in a variety of whistles and sounds, some re-
sembling the squeaks of a rusty gate.
In the manner in which these calls were made - separated by a couple of
seconds - alternating between the participants, with the total duration of
the performance anything from a few minutes to, on a couple of occas-
ions, one lasting well over half an hour (which the observer left while still
in progress), the similarity with corresponding behaviour in D. accipitrinus
was striking.
Many of the actual notes uttered in these performances were very simi-
lar in both species, call notes and/or visual checks being commonly needed
to separate them.
Appearing briefly at times in the open when crossing clearings,/*, mel-
anocephala remained generally within the forest.
Breeding
On 23rd March 1972, three individuals were seen to alight on the
crown of a tall tree. Two of them flew down to inspect its twin trunks at a
height of about 40 feet. A short time later all three flew away. It seemed
likely that a site for a nest was being sought.
I was told on 10th May 1973 of a nest discovered about two weeks
previously from which three small parrots were seen to emerge, to be joined
later by two others, presumably their parents. Later on the same day I was
taken to this nest about one hour before sunset. The nest was in a living

tree about 70 feet high. The entrance appeared to be a natural, vertical
cleft in the main trunk about 55 feet from the ground. The tree was about
20 feet from a trail and about 100 yards from a creek. This was an area of
mixed bush and savannah.
While I waited in the vicinity of the nest, five birds arrived in a nearby
tree and, with the aid of binoculars, these could be identified without
difficulty as P. melanocephala. Three were noticeably smaller than the
other two with shorter tails and a noticeably yellowish tinge to the some-
what dingy white of their belly feathers.
Many minutes were subsequently spent in a gradual, surreptitious
approach to the nest during which time these normally noisy birds were
almost completely silent except for a few very soft, subdued sounds, in-
cluding a clucking "culuck".
I was told later of another nest not very far from this one and of several
adult melanocephala pursued by a hawk, fleeing in different directions. It
seemed as if several pairs may have nested within a rather small area.
Another nest was described to me by an Amerindian (Harry Peneaux)
living at Orealla, as being situated in the limb of a large ''cedar" tree
(Cedrela sp.) which had been felled. The loggers' attention was drawn to
the fact that a parrot was observed flying into a hole in the branch - after
the tree had been felled. Only one juvenile was present in this nest.
Two females in the writer's possession, nesting in captivity, uttered
continuous subdued double notes for many minutes and sometimes hours
on end.
Feeding habits
I was told by Harry Peneaux, that it fed on Hitia Byrsonima coriacea,
var. spicata, Waramia Tapirira guianensis and Poixdoux Inga sp. Another
Amerindian, Alvaro Sarmento, residing on the Berbice River, described its
diet as similar to that of D. accipitrinus and included Awarra Astrocaryum
tucumoides (Drude), Cocorite Maximilianea regia (Mart), Poixdoux Inga sp.
and especially Guava Psidium guajava. For the last two items they visit
farms, feeding on cultivated forms of the indigenous fruits.
In early October 1971, the writer saw a group of five pecking at, and
apparently eating, the newly opened yellow green leaves of a very large
deciduous forest tree. Many partly eaten leaves were found beneath the
tree after the birds had flown. In January 1972 four were noted feeding on
the yellow/orange pulp and/or the seeds of a tangerine-sized wild Ficus
fruit. In March 1972 a group arrived in a nearby tree and apparently com-
menced feeding. After they had left, red tubular blossoms were found scat-

tered beneath the tree. The stalk at the base of the flower was missing in
most cases, while the blossom itself was intact.
Due to the density of the foliage it was possible, while the feeding took
place, only to hear the birds so the observation was not fully confirmed.
In captivity many kinds of flowers are partly eaten by this parrot. (From
my genera 1 observation, several South American species of parrot com-
monly feed on blossoms.)
Upon hearing that Aratinga pertinax not merely nested in arboreal
termitaria , but actually fed on the termites in the wild, a piece of ter-
mite nest was given to a captive Black-headed Caique. Eating continually,
an estimated 200-300 termites were eaten by the bird in about an hour
and a half. This bird, which had probably been hand-reared, also showed
a great liking for grasshoppers and small caterpillars.
Summary
Quite different in outward appearance, this species resembles closely
Deroptyus accipitrinus in habits and behaviour. . Breeding, as with other
larger parrot species in the area, occurred in the early months of the year*.
Seen quite frequently in groups of five, this, along with the number seen
at the nest, suggests a clutch size limit of three. At least in the area studied
it seemed to be highly sedentary. Even during one period of drought, when
humidity fell to the lowest level in the area for about seven years, no fall
in its numbers was noted.
Addendum
The captive bird mentioned above remains in the writer's possession.
A mate was found for it and three eggs were laid in 1980. At least one was
fertile but none hatched. Two young were successfully reared in 1982.
There was no sign of any unhatched egg when these chicks vacated the nest.
Approximately nine months old now, these retain the juvenile plumage
and the dark irides of the immature bird.
*As noted by Haverschmidt, the larger parrots appear to breed in the early months of
the year. The province of Berbice adjoins Suriname where his observations were made

A BIRD SHOW IN MOSCOW
By JEFFERY BOSWALL (Bristol)
During the 18th International Ornithological Congress in Moscow in
August 1982, a show of caged birds was arranged in three rooms at the
Zoological Museum. I visited it on the last (of about four) days, Sunday,
22nd August.
It was arranged by the "Captive Singing and Decorative Birds Depart-
ment of the Moscow Society for the Protection of Nature", to quote ver-
batim my interpreter, Irene Yershova, a new member of the club.
First I asked her which birds ordinary Muscovites with no special inter-
est in aviculture might keep and was told that the most popular native
birds were Siskin Carduelis spinus , Goldfinch C carduelis, Bullfinch Pyrr-
hula pyrrhula and Chaffinch Fringilla coelebs ; first equal among exotics
are the Budgerigar Melopsittacus undulatus and Canary Serinus canaria ,
with the "Japanese Finch" (?Japanese Grosbeak Coccothraustes per-
sonatus) third in line.
Of the four hundred members of the club, about 250 were canary fan-
ciers (about 70% of whom favoured the species for its song, the others for
its plumage). Hybrids included a cross with a Two-barred Crossbill Loxia
leucoptera.
About 50 members kept other exotics, particularly the Gouldian Finch
Chloebia gouldiae, the Zebra Finch Poephila guttata and the Common
Mynah Acridotheres tristis.
The remaining 100 members kept Soviet indigenous birds, I was told,
and the show itself strikingly confirmed this view. I toured the exhibition
systematically and noted every species. Those familiar to European orni-

Harewood Bird Gardens have, for a number of years, successfully
reared the Ypecaha Wood Rail Aramides ypecaha and it is pleasing to hear
that some of their offspring are now themselves beginning to breed. A
pair obtained by G.K. Booth of Doncaster in 1979 bred in 1981. He
writes: "Early in May I noticed leaves were being stripped and deposited
in the stream. A nest was finally constructed in a hollow in the bank top
by the stream and under a railway sleeper which spanned the stream. It
was hidden behind a clump of flags and was lined with the broad leaves
of the flags.
"The first egg was laid on 22nd May, the second on 23rd, then two
more, each at two-day intervals. They were large for the size of the bird,
being about the size of a domestic duck egg and they had largish red-
brown blotches on a creamy background. The eggs were always laid in
the late afternoon.
"Incubation commenced on 29th May and once started, the birds sat
very tight with one bird always patrolling in the area of the nest and being
very aggressive to any bird that came within 7-8 feet of the nest. The first
chick hatched at midday on 21st June, making the incubation period 24
days. A second hatched the next day, after which the parents were never
seen to go back to the two remaining eggs.
"As soon as the chicks left the nest, only a few hours after hatching,
the male took charge of them and after taking them to the stream, brooded
them on the bank just above the waterline. The chicks were seen to swim
in the stream a few days after hatching.
"The diet given consisted of dead day-old chopped chicks, maggots,
chopped fruit mixed with softbill food and mixed budgie seed, taken in
limited quantities and stale bread or cake soaked in water. Vionate pow-
der was given twice a week on the chopped chicks.
"Both parents fed the young by passing food between each other and
then placing it at the feet of the young. If the chicks did not take the
food, the process was repeated until the young fed. Bread, soaked in the
stream, was eagerly taken by the parents for the chicks.
"The chicks were dusky brown, with darker brown markings; bill, feet
and legs were black and, for the first week, they stayed in one area by
the edge of the stream, always watched over by one parent. At the age of
10 days the chicks were beginning to explore their aviary and were becom-
ing less secretive. At two weeks, the tail and wing feathers were starting to
show, and it was noticed that they started the habit of flicking their tail
feathers as they walked.

high and the mauve colouring on the breast was beginning to show. At 40
days old they had almost attained full colour and while occasionally they
were still fed by the parents, they were mostly fending for themselves."

Mats Tell has sent the following news from Sweden: "No doubt the
extraordinary hot and dry summer of 1982 had a negative influence on
the breeding activities of many of my birds. The final result was, however,
better than the year before. The following birds were reared to indepen-
dence: Sun Conure - 6, Azara's Conure - 4, Bourke's Parrot - 21, and
Bluish Seedeaters - 4. Eclectus Parrots, Virginian Cardinals, White-
collared Seedeaters and Crested Black Buntings had infertile clutches and
again a pair of Silver-eared Mesias failed to hatch any chicks. Blue-
crowned Hanging Parrots, Fire-crowned Bishops and Nonpareil Buntings
did not nest, although an old female Nonpareil built a beautiful nest
without laying.

Further evidence that Desmaresf s Fig Parrot Psittaculirostris desma-
restii is a colonial nester comes to light from observations by Bruce
Beehler, published in a recent newsletter of the Papua New Guinea Bird
Society. Mr. Beehler reports observing pairs of these birds attending
cavities in a tall rain forest tree, calling noisily during all hours of the
day. The birds moved in and out of these cavities, and sat for long periods
at the entrances of them, chattering and looking about. The nests were all
very high in the tree (more than 25 metres) and were in branches less than
30 cm diameter.

An unusual pest control experiment enlisting the help of birds is under
way in the extensive pine woods of Chuxian Prefective, Anhui Province,
China, in an effort to control pine moths. Azure-winged Magpies Cyanopica
cyanus are trained for up to three years to take the moths.
Nestlings were put into small cages and signalled with a whistle when-
ever they were fed. As soon as the young birds were able to fly, they were
transferred to a huge enclosure in the forest containing trees, water and
insects. The researchers taught the magpies to feed mainly on harmful
insects by throwing them pine moths and other insects to eat, putting
some on branches for them to find, or simply blowing the whistle to call
them to eat the moths. After three years, the birds were released in the
Sishon Forest. When a whistle was blown the magpies would begin search-
ing for insects in the trees. Over a period of 20 days, 18 birds had success-

Since the International Symposium on Bustards held in Jaipur in 1980,
conservation bodies are concentrating efforts to ensure the survival of
these majestic birds. The Great India Bustard Ardeotis nigriceps is the only
species listed in the Red Data Book at present but it is likely to be followed
by two other species endemic to the Indian subcontinent - the Lesser
Florican Sypheotides indica and the Bengal Florican Houbaropsis bengal-
ensis . The outlook seems bleak indeed, so much so that the I.C.B.P. is
budgeting for extensive population research and conservation procedures
for these and three other species - the Houbara Chlamydotis undulata,
Great Bustard Otis tarda and Little Bustard Tetrax tetrax.

A German aviculturist, Helmut Wagner of Mossingen, has reared one
offspring from a pair of Stella's Lorikeet Charmosyna papou stellae.
The pair are kept in a cage, 125 x 70 x 70 cm, and an egg was deposited
on the floor on 7th July, 1981. As it was not damaged, it was placed
with an incubating pair of Swainson's Lorikeets for 20 days. At that
time it was obvious that the Stella's Lorikeets were firmly incubating an
artificial egg which had been supplied and subsequently their own egg
was returned. After a further nine days, the egg hatched and a beautiful
normal red hen was reared. Both parents were of the melanistic phase.

A.J. Mobbs writes: "A new mutation of the Gouldian Finch is being
bred in the U.K., namely the Lilac-breasted. Adult males have the overall
colour of the normal with the breast lilac instead of purple. Females
have extremely pale lilac on the breast.
"The mutation has been about for at least three years and from breed-
ing data received by me (as collator of mutation reports for the Australian
Finch Society), appears to be fairly well established.
"I personally bred four Lilac-breasted (in 1981) from a Lilac-breast to
White-breast mating.
"This new mutation can already be found in all head colours, e.g. Red-,
Black- and Orange-headed. As yet little is known genetically regarding the
Lilac-breasted; however, it has proved dominant to the White-breasted
mutation and will immediately, if mated to such, produce Lilac-breasted
(as well as White-breasted and normals split for White-breast and Lilac-
breast).
"Blue-breasted Gouldian Finches, in which the breast is an attractive
powder blue, are being produced in the States. It appears the mutation is
dominant to the normal, Blue-breasted being produced immediately from

The latest issue of Ibis (April 1982, p, 203-210) contains a brief paper
by former Avicultural Society Council member, Colin Harrison, on "The
Earliest Parrot: A new species from the British Eocene". Fossil remains
from the lower strata of the London clay at Walton-on-the-Naze, Essex,
have been dated from the Lower Eocene period (50-60 million years ago).
Palaeopsittacus georgei , as the species has been called, is believed to have
been about the same size as the Senegal Parrot Poicephalus senegalus ,
could grasp objects in the foot but was poorly adapted for climbing
among branches. Flight was probably less vigorous than in most recent
psittacines.

The population of the Mauritius Echo Parrakeet Psittacula echo is at a
critical level and, with the nucleus of three males and two females reputed
not to have bred for several years, it seems the species is doomed to extinc-
tion. Carl Jones, who is considering several possibilities for a last ditch
attempt at saving the species, seems to think that some Echo Parrakeets
left Mauritius in the mid- to late -1960s, possibly for America. If any mem-
ber has information on this, even though it may now be only for historical
reference, could they please contact Carl Jones at Forest Quarters, Black
River, Mauritius, Indian Ocean.

From Henning Jacobsen comes news of the death of two doyens of
Danish aviculture, Walther Langberg and J.L. Albrecht-Moller, who died
on 3rd September and 29th August 1982 respectively. Both were known
throughout Europe, Mr. Albrecht-Moller for his comprehensive book on
parrots and Walther Langberg for his work with parrakeets, parrot finches
and Australian finches. Mr. Langberg was also well known to Budgerigar
fanciers, having produced the Budgerigar Standard for Scandinavia and
much of Europe. Many will remember him for the Foreign Birds he so
successfully staged at the National Exhibition of Cage Birds during the
1960's, and for his breeding of lutino Nyasa Lovebirds. These two highly
respected aviculturists will be sadly missed by their many friends. Mr. Al-
brecht-Moller, who was 82, had been a member of the Avicultural Society
since 1953, Mr. Langberg joined the Society in 1950.

The interesting article by Geoffrey Kenyon on Controlled Environment
Aviaries {Avicultural Magazine , 1982, p.36) touched on the subject of
planting such accommodation. Here at Padstow Bird Gardens in Cornwall,
we have two such controlled areas, one devoted to birds while the other
houses a live exhibit of butterflies and moths. That devoted to birds
proved little problem as the more usual type of plants were used but
planting for the butterflies is a different proposition. Greenery for the sake
of it is not practical and planting has to be given some thought and must
take into account two different aspects. Firstly, shrubs giving a high flower
production to provide a food supply are important, although this food
source can be augmented with dissolved sugar, frutrose or honey in water.

Secondly, and perhaps the most difficult aspect of keeping and breed-
ing butterflies in captivity, is obtaining the larval food plants on which the
butterflies can lay their eggs. Most species and genera have specialised
preferences, many of which are very difficult to obtain as established
plants. To solve this we obtain the seeds required from Thompson and
Morgan, London Road, Ipswich, Suffolk. This firm publish an illustrated
catalogue of what must be the most comprehensive seed list available in
Britain, and it is well worth obtaining a copy for, besides a wide variety
of unusual plants for indoor areas, a selection of sprouting seeds (mung
beans, alphatoco, fenugreek and alfalfa) are also offered.

BIRDS OF THE NORTH SOLOMONS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.969813590909091" page_id="56319674"  page_num="58" year="" vol="">
By Don Hadden, Wan Ecology Institute Handbook No. 8, 1981. 107 pp.
Numerous colour plates. Price: Kina 6 or US dollars 9.50.
There has long been a dearth of popular ornithological literature for
many of the islands dotted around the Pacific Ocean. Don Hadden's book
fills a gap on two of these - Buka and Bougainville, the two main islands
forming the outlying North Solomons Province of Papua New Guinea.
Bougainville's land birds are listed in "Birds of the Southwest Pacific" by
E. Mayr, published in 1945 but those of Buka have not previously been
documented. This volume describes and updates all species recorded from
the islands and coastal waters, covering 150 species, many of them en-
demic to the Solomons group.
The text is set out with introductory sections on physical features,
climate and vegetation, and a brief outline of the history of ornithological
studies of the region. These are followed by chapters on the most fre-
quently seen non-forest birds and where to watch birds on Bougainville.
Species accounts follow the normal pattern of classification and relate to
their biology within the region. Some specific details from outside the
region are given but by and large are omitted. While this may be a criticism
by some, it is because of the lack of breeding and other data which is
known from outside the region and the book admirably achieves its main
aim, which is to outline all that has been recorded on the birds within the
region only.

For the first time the Fiji region as a whole is covered in one volume
and as such is a most welcome addition to the popular geographical litera-
ture. The author has done an admirable job on a region which is difficult
to categorise. Apart from the three main island archipelagos, nearly 500
islands are dispersed in over one million square kilometres of the South-

west Pacific covered by this volume.
Like most oceanic regions, bird populations in terms of knowledge can
be separated into two groups - land birds and those inhabiting the seas.
Coverage of land birds is as comprehensive as the intended appeal of the
book allows. Each species account is categorised into identification, flight,
food, breeding, habitat and range, remarks, allied species and subspecies
within the region. Various local names are also given as is a distribution
map. Sketches dispersed throughout depict aspects of a species biology, be
it a food plant, nest site or anatomical peculiarity and are aesthetically
pleasing as well as being informative.
Sea birds are not as comprehensively covered but are adequate. The
author relies heavily on two publications for this section and admits to
having only a passing interest in sea and shore birds and, not surprisingly,
then admits to being a poor sailor. Because of the makeup of the region,
it is probable that much still remains to be discovered about this side
of the region's avifauna.
The book is divided into five parts. The first is introductory and covers
ornithological history, maps of the region, composition of the avifauna,
ecological isolation of related land birds, breeding and moult, conserva-
tion and habitats - the latter illustrated with fine colour photographs by
Jim Sears.
Part Two is devoted to the 15 colour plates depicting most of the
species recorded while Parts Three and Four are accounts of the land
and sea bird species. The final part is the various appendices and takes in
a glossary, bibliography, checklist of birds of the region and indices of
English, scientific and local names.
The area is rich in endemics, some of which are familiar to avicul-
turists, even if not available, and as such the book is of interest. Con-
servationists will also find items of interest throughout, none more so
than recurrent sentiments on the devastation caused by the introduced
mongoose. It always amazes me that more emphasis is not placed on the
eradication of non-natives to protect island populations.
The book in its own right is worthy of inclusion in the library; the
approach and aspects covered by Dick Wailing, although different from
other geographical literature, only go to enhance the book.

RECENT ADVANCES IN THE STUDY OF RAPTOR DISEASES

<bodyText confidence="0.976077806451613" page_id="56319676"  page_num="60" year="" vol="">
Proceedings of the first International Symposium on Diseases of Birds
of Prey. London, July 1980. Edited by J. Cooper &amp; A. Greenwood
Chiron Publications, P.O. Box 25, Keighley, WestYorkshire BD22 VBA
Price (including postage): Britain &amp; Europe - #11.50, elsewhere - #12.00
During the past few years, the enormous strides which have been made
in breeding raptors have highlighted the lack of authoritative and up-to-
date books on the management, breeding and diseases of these birds. Al-
though entitled "Recent Advances in the Study of Raptor Diseases", this
volume does an enormous amount to redress this lack, for its scope is
wider than the title suggests.
It comprises the Proceedings of the first International Symposium on
Diseases of Birds of Prey which was held in London in July 1980. The first
international meeting ever devoted to this theme, it brought together most
of the world's authorities and specialists in the field of raptor diseases.
These included the British veterinarians John Cooper and Andrew Green-
wood, who edited the 34 papers in this volume.
The papers are presented in three parts: Pathology and Microbiology,
Surgery and Anaesthesia, and Medicine and Therapeutics. Among the
subjects covered in the first part are the effects of chronic lead ingestion,
causes of death in trained raptors, hand-rearing of vultures and abnormal
and maladaptive behaviour (the result of imprinting).
Surgical treatment of bumblefoot is one of the papers in the second
part, which has a wider application than birds of prey, although it refers
specifically to raptors. This is also true of the paper on diagnostic avian
laparoscopy. Not only can the laparoscope be used to determine sex, but
to diagnose disease. It has been found to be a safe, rapid and effective
method of direct observation of the abdominal contents and can be used
to examine many organs.
Most serious aviculturists will find something of interest in this volume
and to raptor breeders and falconers it will prove indispensable.

A reply to Alastair Morrison's Dissenting View on Aviculture
(Avicultural Magazine, Vol 88, No. 2)
and on keeping Eunymphicus in particular
I would guess that there are more Horned Parrakeets outside Germany
than currently kept there, and I do not entirely agree with the list of en-
dangered specie drawn up by the I.U.C.N. I
dangered species
dangered species drawn up by the I.U.C.N. I do not believe that the plight
of many parrot species that are now in grave danger can be blamed on
aviculturists. Within recent years it has been published that the original
vast areas of primeval forest on the New Caledonian Islands, and especially
on Ouvea, have been felled with an incredible speed - not for timber but
for strip-mining for important minerals. I would love to see more of Mr.
Morrison's energy being joined with that of other readers of our Magazine
and directed against the destruction of wild habitat, even if not wishing to
speak against the recent CITES amendments. Of the two forms o {&amp;apos;Eunym-
phicus cornutus I am convinced that another 20-30 pairs in the hands of
skilled European and other aviculturists will make the difference between
survival and extinction, and although the specimens thus bred may not,
after some generations of captivity, be suitable for reintroduction in the
wild, they would at least still exist as living representatives of their species.
From my own correspondence and from notes in the literature, it
appears that Eunymphicus reproduces as easily as Cyanoramphus. It
may possibly be less hardy in captivity but could it not be that the losses
experienced are due to stress caused in smuggling? Smuggling has appar-
ently been the source of several specimens kept in European collec-
tions and I have not a doubt that officially licensed exportation will save
the lives of more birds than anything else I can think of.
I am therefore in full agreement with Professor Hodges and Miss Low
in their views. The idea, which I cannot remember seeing in print before,
that all who keep rare and endangered species should nominate a respon-
sible organisation, or better still, a responsible aviculturist to receive all
the birds in the event of the owner's death, should be given full support
and publicity by the Society. I have not much faith in the capacity of
zoos in general to breed most species, though I know there are many

BREEDING THE WHITE-BROWED LAUGHINGTHRUSH
Garrulax sannio
By N. HEWSTON (Worcester)
The White-browed is a small Laughingthrush, similar in size to the
Black-headed Sibia Heterophasia capistrata, but with the stronger legs and

feet typical of Garrulax . It is a brown bird, paler below, with cinnamon
under tail-coverts. The crown and short crest, and the throat, are darker
brown. Two buff stripes extend from the lores, one above the eye and a
broader one below. The sexes are similar but in this breeding pair the
cock has a longer bill and larger head and is slightly darker on the crown
and throat. The species ranges from Assam, east to South China and
Hainan, and is a common resident above 2,000 ft. in scrub and secondary
growth (King and Dickinson, 1975).
I obtained four birds in December 1980. I had not seen this species
offered for sale prior to this and can find no reference to it in avicultural
books and periodicals including the Avicultural Magazine , so I assume that
it has not been bred before. It has, however, been regularly available since
1980.
The birds were housed in a planted flight 18 ft. x 6 ft. x 6 ft. high, with
a shelter 6 ft. x 3 ft. x 6 ft. high, with a pair of White-cheeked Touracos
Tauraco leucotis. They spent a lot of time searching for insects in leaf
litter on the aviary floor. They were very sociable, all four often sitting
together. Although they would often sit in twos for mutual preening, it
was difficult to distinguish pairs as they frequently changed partners. The
only sign of friction was during periods of harsh, self-assertive calling,
when one bird calling from a high perch would be displaced by another
which would call in turn.
The birds were fed on softbill food (usually Haith's "Prosecto"),
maggots, mealworms, minced beef and the mixed fresh fruit and soaked

sultanas provided for the Touracos.
In April 1981, nest-boxes were provided when one bird was seen
carrying roots, and a nest was built in the highest box, an open-topped
4 in. cube near the roof. All four birds were seen carrying nesting material
but I think the nest was built by just two. Display was observed, with one
bird circling the other on the floor, head held low and tail horizontal,
singing quietly. One unmarked blue egg was laid three weeks after the
box was put in but this disappeared after three days. Mating was observed
twice during May, in both cases on the aviary floor. Once the hen raised
her tail vertically to invite mating; on the other occasion, the cock enticed
the hen to the floor with an item of food and mating followed.
Another high nest site was provided in May but there was no more
breeding activity. The Touracos did breed successfully, with very little
friction between these and the Laughingthrushes. There was a night-
fright problem with cats during the summer, and in October one bird died
from an infection. Another was sick but was successfully treated.
In 1982 the birds were already building haphazardly in late February
but were still being shut in at night. Late in April nest-building began
seriously in the other high nest-box, shallower than the first, and I finally
ascertained which two birds were paired. The third bird, believed to be a
hen, followed the pair around but was kept at a distance by the hen, so it
was removed. Mating was again observed on the aviary floor, the birds
standing side by side with tails vertical and heads low just before mating.
Three eggs were laid on consecutive days and incubation, beginning with
the laying of the third egg, was shared. Two young hatched after 14 days.
The third egg, containing a full-grown embryo, was found broken at
the other end of the flight.
The young were fed mainly on maggots and mealworms for the first
few days, with spiders and ant larvae and pupae as available, but I was then
able to borrow a light-trap and good numbers of moths were also taken.
The young were brooded constantly for the first eight days, thereafter
only slightly less. At nine days I could see from outside the aviary that
the young birds' eyes were open and the facial stripes were visible. At 10
days the cock stopped brooding but continued to feed the young in the
nest, where the hen still spent most of the day. At 12 days the young were
not brooded for most of the day, but the hen still spent the night on the
nest. Both young left the nest at 14 days. They were much smaller than
the adults, with pinker feet and legs and very short tails.
As soon as the young left the nest the cock started to repair it. After
five days another egg was laid and incubation started the next day. Three

Young White-browed Laughing Thrush, 15 days old
days later we suffered more night-fright problems with cats. The cock
injured its head and stopped incubating and one of the young hurt its foot.
The next day the hen deserted and one egg was found broken on the
floor. A second egg was removed cold from the nest. The following morn-
ing the other young bird had lost most of its tail. Problems with cats con-
tinued, but only the cock bird regularly took fright.
Within a few days of the young leaving the nest, each parent was feed-
ing only one and would chase off the other if it begged for food. The
young bird fed by the cock was feeding itself in three weeks, while the hen
fed her charge for several weeks more. At one stage this bird seemed to be
falling behind the other because of its reluctance to feed itself, but both
have now developed into full-sized healthy birds and have been wintered
with their parents.

For a few weeks while they were nesting, the cock was very aggressive
to the Touracos, confining them to the shelter, and I had to provide an
indoor nest site so that the Touracos could breed. He would also challenge
me if the nest was inspected.
Peace resumed shortly after the young left the nest and the Touracos
were also able to nest successfully.

In the Tropical House at the Wildfowl Trust there is a pair of African
Jacanas which, early in 1982, showed signs of nesting and breeding. The
female dropped several eggs at random which were taken and incubated
successfully. The chicks only survived for a few days but it did prove that
we had a breeding pair.
Eventually, a clutch of four eggs was laid in a primitive nest, little more
than a few scraps of greenery arranged to stop the eggs rolling into the
water. These eggs were also incubated in the Propagation Centre. They
were set on 4th May; three proved infertile but the fourth hatched on
30th May, an incubation period of 26 days.
Feeding was by trial and error and consisted mainly of insects, egg yolk
and vitamin concentrate, but proved satisfactory and the chick grew well.
It gradually developed a most attractive plumage and at three months was
fully grown and beautifully coloured with upper parts and wings bright
chestnut. The crown and back of neck were dark brown, with forehead,
cheeks, throat and upper breast white. The bill was slender and coloured
pale brown. At 14 weeks there was no suggestion of the grey-blue frontal
shield of the parents.
It was decided to introduce it to its parents in the Tropical House and
all seemed to be going well until 6th September (between 14 and 15 weeks)
when it was found dead. It had probably been attacked in the night by
another bird, possibly one of its parents. A post mortem showed it to be a
female and in good condition. As far as we know, this is the first time that
this species has been bred and reared artificially in the U.K. and probably
in Europe.
On 30th June another clutch of three eggs was left with the parents and
these hatched on 23rd July, after 24 days' natural incubation. One chick
died after three days and the other two chicks were found drowned after
two and four weeks respectively. We can only presume that they were
frightened into water too deep for them, as they had no previous enthus-
iasm for water.
In spite of this misfortune, we learned of several unusual habits of this
species. The first is that the female, rather larger than the male, takes no
interest after laying but leaves the entire incubation, and later the broo-

ding and care of the chicks, to the male. Secondly, after the chicks have
hatched they can in some way attach themselves to the father's breast; we
could not see how this took place but he could stand up and move about
with three pairs of legs hanging down like six matchsticks. In their natural
habitat we imagine that this will allow the male to keep the chicks safe
whilst he feeds or moves to another location. Finally, neither parent gave
the chicks any help or encouragement in feeding. We noticed that they
started to stalk from the first day and were given insects, fruit flies, etc.,
which they were seen to wash before eating, after they were about two
weeks old.
It is hoped that the lessons learned this year will allow greater success
in future.

By Dr. WOLFGANG MERCK (Hamburg, W. Germany)
I received my pair of Goldie's Lorikeets in December 1980. Accord-
ing to the person from whom they were obtained, they came from two
different breeders in Germany and had been reared that same year.
The pair are alike in colour but the male is slightly bolder, particularly
about the head, and his bearing is more upright than the female's.
Goldie's Lorikeets are charming little birds, not as colourful as many
other lories, but they are lively being good at both flying and climbing.
Their accommodation, therefore, should not be too small. My outdoor
aviary measures 4 x 1.5 x 2 m high with an adjoining shelter of 1.5 x
1.5 x 2 m. They are not sensitive to cold and the shelter is only moderately
heated. They go freely into the flight even in frosty weather, though I do
not let them out when the temperature falls below -2 or -3*C. They bathe
thoroughly every five days or so and when rain falls after a period of dry,
hot weather, they also enjoy rain-bathing. It is amusing that their flight is
very often synchronised with that of their aviary neighbours, a pair of
Swainson's Lorikeets.
The aviary is not planted except for two branches of Cotoneaster which
penetrate the wire from outside. The birds do no damage to the leaves,
though the berries are probably gnawed off at an early stage. Creeping wild
vine is also nibbled. They also go down on the floor, which is partly turfed,
to eat the seeding grass.
The diet consists of honey, glucose (containing an addition of multi-
vitamins), baby cereal and baby fruit powder, diluted in water to a soupy
mixture, sprouted sunflower seed, fresh corn, figs, apples, pears, grapes,
grated carrots and a little biscuit. Of these items, apart from the nectar,
figs and sunflower seeds are by far the most relished, as are seasonal berries
such as Cotoneaster and Pyracantha. Chickweed and dandelion heads are
eaten but spinach is hardly touched. In springtime the buds of fruit trees
and lilac are sucked (though I was later told that the latter is poisonous!).
I also give them fresh willow twigs - though they only nibble the bark, the
birds hang, swing and climb on the twigs.
In 1981 no breeding attempts were made as the birds were certainly
still too young. I had given them a small rectangular horizontal nest-box in
which they roosted but this box seemed unsuitable for breeding and in
1982 I gave them a natural log, similar in size as for budgerigars, but I

Dr. W. MERCK - GOLDIE'S LORIKEET
made the mistake of not removing the first box. The female took to the
new log, but at first I did not realise that the male stayed in the old box.
In April I was often able to observe the cock displaying. I never saw the
birds pairing, so supposed that the two eggs, which were laid between 20th
and 22nd April, would be clear. I was pleased, therefore, to see, a week
later, that they were fertile. Two tiny chicks, covered in white-grey down;
were seen on 16th May.
As the parents were quite trusting, they did not resent my checking and
cleaning the nest. This needed to be done only occasionally in the first few
weeks, but as the chicks began to grow, it was necessary to do this every
4-5 days. Rotten wood and wood shavings were used. The male fed the
female, but not the young. Even after fledging on 17th July (the first
chick left in the morning, the second in the afternoon), the male did not
feed them but showed a hostile attitude towards them, so much so that I
considered separating him. It was apparent that he did not acknowledge
the young to be his own because they did not come from his "house" - the
old nest-box. Fortunately, the female fed the young very well and did so
for some weeks after fledging. Later on, the male stopped being aggressive
towards the young and the whole family - apart from some bickering -
lived in harmony.
When leaving the nest, the young were quite similar to their parents in
size and plumage, only lacking the red cap which was replaced by some red
feathers at the front. All green areas were somewhat paler than in the
adults. I am sure the young are a pair as they now differ in size, like the
adults.
The first nights after fledging the young did not return to their nest-
box and had to be put in. As they were even more trusting than the
adults, there was no difficulty in doing this. However, as on subsequent
nights, they did not roost in a log but clung to the wire and seemed quite
uneasy. I fastened a small horizontal board near the top wire, on which
they roosted for the next few nights. Afterwards, they took to the male's
nest-box; he, meanwhile, had joined his mate in her log!

By Dr. JOHANNA SIEBER (Research Assistant - Institute for Compara-
tive Ethology of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna)
In 1968 our Institute imported two Keas from New Zealand; a third
one followed in 1969 but unfortunately died soon after arrival. These
imported birds were all fully adult, wild-caught.
Housing
The surviving pair was caged in a large aviary measuring 10x10x5 m,
with an adjoining indoor compartment, 3 x 2 x 2 m, containing breeding
facilities, i.e. a large hollow tree trunk with an entrance hole 20 cm round.
Some straw and hay are provided throughout the year and are accepted
as nesting material. The ground of the aviary consists of natural soil and
one side slopes gently and is covered with rocks of various sizes. In New
Zealand Keas live mainly in mountainous regions near the timber line so
they can easily withstand our cold winters in central Europe without
additional heating. Some thick stems are provided for climbing.
Diet
Since the Kea is almost omnivorous, we provide a mixed diet consisting
of different seeds (sunflower, peanuts, wheat, barley, hemp, millet), fruits
and vegetables of the season, cut up meat (beef or horse), hard-boiled eggs,
lettuce, and occasionally cottage cheese and margarine or other fats. Every
day some freshly cut branches of native trees (oak, birch, willow, fir) are
given, for Keas eat the leaves or needles and like to tear off or chew the
bark. We have not found it necessary to give additional vitamins or miner-
als. Keas are extremely fond of bathing, even in very cold weather, and
sometimes soak their food in water before eating it, so a large container
of water is supplied. When they are rearing young, additional minced meat,
mealworms and pink mice are offered.
Reproduction
Breeding behaviour of the Kea has been described elsewhere, therefore
I shall discuss our breeding record only briefly. Just one year after arrival,
the first pair began to build a nest and the male was observed feeding
the female and copulating several times. In April 1970 a clutch consisting

of two eggs was laid and after 19 days, one chick hatched; the second egg
was infertile.
In 1971 two infertile eggs were laid, but from March 1972 onwards the
pair has been breeding successfully every year (see Table below).

Altogether we obtained 32 young out of 41 eggs during nine years, all
of them being successfully reared by their parents. Most of the young
were given to other institutions when at least six months old, but we kept
some in the Institute to establish a second breeding pair.
In 1975 we tried to pair the female "Cinda" with the male "Rufus",
both brother and sister from the clutch of 1972. Their aviary was similar
to that of their parents only without the rocky slope. Unfortunately
"Cinda" died in 1976 when eggbound.
Subsequently we paired "Rufus" with "Twiggy" from the 1974 clutch.
In 1978 "Twiggy" laid two eggs, both infertile. In October of the same
year, "Rufus" died of an intestinal infection. Only one month later
"Nugget" (hatched in 1972) was placed in the enclosure with " Twiggy"
and in December 1980 we saw them copulating intensively for the first
time. At the beginning of May, "Twiggy" laid three eggs, from which two
chicks hatched and were reared without any problems; the other egg dis-
appeared.
Conclusions
As far as we know, this is the first full second generation captive
breeding of Keas, at least in Europe. Zurich Zoo was successful once with
a captive-bred male and a wild-caught female.Through our experiments we
learned that the female reaches maturity at four years when the first
clutch is laid.

BREEDING THE WHITE-CAPPED PARROT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.974869" page_id="56319700"  page_num="74" year="" vol="">
Pionus senilis
By RICHARD ZIMMERMAN (Jackson, Michigan, USA)
In 1975 I acquired seven immature White-capped Parrots directly from
U.S. quarantine. One died, one arrived so injured that it has remained in
the house as a pet, a third was attacked by the others and was given to a
friend. Of the four remaining, two proved to be males and two females. I
cannot sex Pionus visually and the colour varies from bird to bird, as does
size. The male White-cap is noticeably larger than the hen. However, my
Duskies and Plum-crowned hens are larger, while in the Bronze-wings, the
sexes seem to be the same size. I do not know if this is a rule or applies
only to my birds. As time passed, one pair proved to be incompatible,
neither bird having the slightest interest in the other, and this pair was
eventually sold.
The remaining pair was housed alone in their aviary. On one side was a
pair of Duskies, on the other there were Bronze-wings. During the late
winter of 1981 they began to show an interest in the nest-box (6 inches
square by 17 inches high) by enlarging the hole, throwing out the cedar
shavings and tearing the roof off the box.
During the spring the hen would crouch on the perch, drop her wings
and shiver, uttering a loud cry; mating then took place.
The weather at this time was typical of the mid-western United States -
warm bright days followed by cold dark ones with much rain.
The very large eggs were laid during the last week of April. When
laying, the hen's abdomen was so swollen that it touched the perch she
was sitting on and she seemed very uncomfortable. I only saw her out of
the box once in that condition. I tried to examine the nest-box regularly
but when she began to lay she sat so tightly that I could not see what was
going on. I caught her off the nest twice, once after the first egg had been
laid and again after the clutch of four eggs was completed. After that she
would not leave the box even when I opened the small viewing door and
she puffed up and hissed until the door was closed.
The first egg hatched on or about 24th May. I was able to tell when the
young hatched by the harsh, rasping noise that they made while being fed.
The rare glimpse I got of the young showed them to be covered with a thin
white down.
The male was not seen to enter the box until the young were feathered
out. The job of feeding the young, as far as I could determine, was the sole

responsibility of the female though she, of course, was fed by the male.
When the young were feathered and the female no longer stayed in the
box during the day, the male would enter the box and from that time on
he fed the young directly.
The chicks left the nest on 17th, 22nd 24th and 31st July. When the
young first left the nest-box they spent the daylight hours in the aviary
and returned to the nest-box at night. The first two out returned to sleep
in the box until the third baby left the nest. After that, they would peri-
odically return to the box. As they feathered out, they acquired bronze-
coloured wings, blue flight and tail feathers, a little red around the vent
while the feathers of the white cap were tipped with dark green. The rest of
the plumage was bright green except for blue ear patches. The eye ring,
bright pink in the adults, was grey in the young. The parents reared the
four young to independence.
In 1982 the birds again went to nest in April. A larger box was provi-
ded (8 inches by 9 inches by 20 inches high) as I felt the first box to be
too small. Only two young hatched; the other eggs were infertile. The
following dates may be of interest: first egg laid on 20th April; first chick
hatched on 20th May; pin feathers and eyes starting to open by 4th June;
eyes open and chicks standing upright by 7th June; out of the box on 12th
July.
The adults proved to be very tolerant of interference. The youngest of
the two chicks broke its wing while in the box - I presume one of the
adults may have jumped on it in the dark of the box. It had surgery per-
formed on its wing and was separated from its parents, although in their
sight, while it was recuperating. The chick was hand-fed with a mixture of
wheat germ, oatmeal, high-protein baby cereal and various baby fruits and
vegetables. After three weeks it was returned to the aviary containing the
parents and its sibling. Again it was taken from the parents to have the
metal pin removed from the bone and returned to the parents one week
later. On both occasions the parents accepted it back and were even
anxious to feed it.
All my Pionus are housed in indoor aviaries measuring 3 feet square
by 6Vi feet high. Attached to each indoor aviary is an outside flight 16 feet
long, to which the birds have access through a small sliding window.
During cold weather their quarters are heated by electricity and the birds
are not allowed to use the outside flights. They are confined from late
November until April, as they seem very uncomfortable when the tempera-
ture drops below 50*F (10*C) and I do not believe in subjecting tropical
birds to uncomfortably cold weather. In the winter months they receive a

good deal of light as the top two feet of each aviary is clear Plexiglass.
None of my Pionus eats a great deal of seed, although sunflower,
safflower and a mixture of canary and parakeet seed, cracked corn and
turkey pellets is before them at ah times. My birds also receive daily -
fresh corn-on-the-cob (whole maize), apples, Cheddar cheese, carrots,
spinach, peas, raw peanuts and grapes. I use a mixture of Torulayeast and
Gevral Protein as a dietary supplement. This same diet is fed all year long.
Their favourite rearing food is corn-on-the-cob and my breeding pair have
consumed up to two ears a day when young are in the nest.
Members of the Pionus genus have all the best qualities for either
aviary or pet birds. They are beautiful, especially in the sunlight, active,
curious, not too noisy and can make gentle, entertaining pets.

For a year I kept the two female White-caps together thinking they
were a pair. In the spring both hens laid eggs in the small nest-box men-

Both birds incubated; one bird, because of the small size of the box,
sitting on the eggs, nine in all. The other hen sat on top of her. Never did
they fight or show any aggression to each other.

By BRIAN HILL (Yeovil, Somerset)
Articles on the Lapwing in the Avicultural Magazine appear to have
been scanty. Workman (1931) kept adult birds which had been casualties
from shooting. He found them easy to care for on a diet of earthworms,
scalded crushed biscuit meal and bread and milk. When the earthwork
supply dried up, they were given a diet of beef heart, boiled rice and
boiled potatoes. He does not make any mention of the "leg tremble" that
is so characteristic of this species.
Goss-Custard, Wilkins and Kear (1971) hatched chicks that had been incu-
bated at 101-102*F. Their starter food was minced eel, boiled maggots,
boiled egg and mealworms. Later they were reared on live daphnia, green
flies, moths, caterpillars, flies, locusts, woodlice, small earthworms, and
duckweed. They found heat lamps necessary up to four weeks, but not
thereafter. This is a week longer than I found was necessary. They give
graphical growth rate data, and comparative data for the Curlew Numenius
arquata, Redshank Tringa totanus and Ruff Philomachus pugnax. They
too make no mention of the "leg tremble". However, the "leg-tremble"
or "pattering"habit is discussed at some length in Spencer (1953).
Acquisition of the chicks
I came across four recently-hatched chicks which had fallen into a
trench several feet deep on 12th May 1982. The trench had been recently
excavated around the perimeter of a field of broad beans near Long
Sutton, Somerset. It had been dug presumably to improve the drainage of
the field, as it was situated on the periphery of the flood plain of the
River Yeo, just a few feet above the water meadows.
The nest had presumably been situated amongst the sparse bean plants
at the edge of the crop, on relatively dry ground. The chicks were being
persuaded and coaxed by their parents, alighting on the ground a few
yards in advance of the chicks, to walk toward the moist meadows with
their rhynes (local name for ditches) and generally high water table.
Apparently the parents, and in particular the female, are only capable of
indicating and drawing the chicks in the general direction toward feeding
grounds, and not to give close guidance to avoid hazardous ground. So the
chicks had stumbled into the ditch, which had smooth steep sides of clay

and a little water in the bottom. A drove, with another ditch, lay between
the fields and the water meadows. At first I gathered up the chicks and
conveyed them across drove and ditch on to the nearest meadow. They
were set down, and I withdrew to watch. The parents continued to circle
above the spot where the chicks had stumbled, or perhaps could not hear
their cheeps from the meadow. Anyway, it seemed that future care of the
chicks by the parents would be hazardous (with an additional threat from
watchful crows) so I decided to take them home for hand-rearing.
The chicks were not reckoned to be more than 24 hours old when
found. The first Lapwing chicks to be seen for the 1982 season were
recorded on 30th April.
Hazards to Lapwing chicks
I have other records of recently hatched Lapwing chicks getting into
hazardous situations because of nesting in a habitat altered by man.
On 4th May 1980, whilst cycling along the Castle Cary to Somerton
road near Christian's Cross, a road which was fairly busy with traffic, a
pair of Lapwings was frantically trying&amp;apos;to lead a brood of chicks across the
road, which had ditches on both sides. On this occasion, gathering up the
chicks, conveying them a few yards across the road in the appropriate
direction, and setting them down in the pasture, did the trick. Although
the adults had flown low over our heads, calling and trying to distract us,
when we withdrew they almost immediately settled on the pasture a few
yards from the chicks.
Then again on 9th June 1982, near Glanvilles Wootton (Dorset), a
brood of four recently-hatched chicks had a miraculous escape from being
trampled on by a herd of dairy cows. Whilst passing, my attention had been
drawn to the field on hearing adult Lapwing calls. The gate I stopped by
showed the field to be sloping, dry, with scanty herbage, and patches of
dusty earth. Small in size, it was not the sort of situation in which I would
have expected Lapwings to nest. However, its lower boundary to my right
was formed by a small stream and adjacent strip of marshy ground.
Most of the herd were on the far side, and scanning with binoculars
revealed the Lapwing chicks coming from the left, and evidently being
coaxed down the slope to the marshy bottom. By coincidence I had
arrived on the scene just before afternoon milking, for a couple of farm
women appeared at the far side and started the herd moving toward the
gate. Through the binoculars I could see the chicks spreading out several
yards apart, with the herd coming toward me. My field of vision filled with legs,
hooves and thrown-up dust - rather, like one of those long focus shots

much favoured by makers of films showing herds of ungulates on the move
on the dry plains of Africa. The female Lapwing remained on the ground
trying to muster the young by calls and visual signals, and at times putting
herself between an oncoming cow and a chick. The male bird meanwhile
remained some yards away, either watching from the ground, or aloft in
pursuit of marauding crows which were obviously watching for an oppor-
tunity to snatch a chick. When the dust literally settled, and I scanned the
field, I was amazed and relieved to spot all four chicks unscathed, and
closing on the marshy ground.
Accommodation
The chicks that were taken home for hand-rearing were accommodated
in a small conservatory, the floor of which was part covered by a layer of
peat kept constantly moist, part exposed tile, and part covered with
slightly damp earth and compost. There was a shallow pan of water
surrounded by the peat.
Warmth was provided by a heat lamp with reflector, beneath which the
chicks could find the degree of warmth they required for comfort. In
order that they could rapidly regain the warmth if they wandered away
from the heat lamp at night, a red light bulb was kept illuminated all
night adjacent to the heat lamp. Its light output was such that it only just
discernibly illuminated the far corners of the floor space. During the pro-
longed spell of hot weather this set-up resulted in a consistent temperature
that did not fall below 60*F (15*C), even at night.
Ektachrome transparencies were taken to show the development of the
chicks, at approximately weekly intervals.

Right from the start there was no problem in getting the chicks to eat;
they voraciously devoured earthworms and woodlice. In fact, as their
appetites grew my family were pressed into collecting sufficient quantity
of earthworms, woodlice and other invertebrates, which became increas-
ingly difficult as the drought of May became prolonged.
Earthworms (Lumbricidae) were the favourite food, but they also
readily took woodlice (Isopoda), centipedes (Chilopoda), cleansed blowfly
(Calliphoridae), maggots, black ants (Formicidae).
The depth of the peat varied from two to six bill lengths, so that any
earthworms which were not eaten at once went into the moist peat and
were available during the night. As the chicks got older, more earthworms
were taken at night than by day.

Early competition for food
Whilst earthworms were plentifully available from a compost heap,
they were provided in such quantities that most escaped being devoured
directly and went into the moist peat. Nevertheless, competition for par-
ticular worms was observed from Day 1 (13th May) in a most curious and
often amusing way. A couple of flst-fulls of worms would be tipped onto
the floor, there would be a rush to get the biggest ones, and a chick would
run off with one chased by the others, even though a writhing mass of
worms remained. Often the competition for worms would result in two or
even three of the chicks in a tug-of-war: heaving back until the worm
either snapped or one contestant lost its grip!
In these competitions, one chick was noticeable from the beginning as
being less robust than its siblings. In all the competitions for a worm it
was always unsuccessful and even when we tried to give it a worm for
itself, it would subsequently lose it. It soon grew weak and died on Day 6.
Early preference for wet ground
Providing a range of substrate (moist peat, damp compost/soil, dry
stone) plus the shallow pan of water, enabled one to study their require-
ments for moisture. Initially they confmed their movements almost ex-
clusively to the patch of moist peat around the water pan. They kept their
feet moist by frequently wading in the water. Also worms were often
taken into the pan and washed by dunking and shaking, and after the
worm had been swallowed the bill was washed by dipping it into the water
and giving a little shake. Shaking the bill whilst immersed was also the
only method observed by which the chicks drank.
Lapwings almost invariably site their nests either on slight eminences
above saturated ground, or on dry ground not many yards from bottom-
lands, water meadows or areas subject to seasonal flooding. Earthworms
remain nearer the surface in saturated ground, and so more available to
Lapwings. In addition such ground in the spring may have a greater pro-
fusion of other prey than drier ground.
"Leg tremble" or "Pattering" (Spencer, 1953)
Early in their development, certainly by Day 8, the "leg tremble" was
noticed. A chick would pause, tilt its body slightly forward, evidently
looking at the ground in front, and rapidly tremble one leg for a few
seconds, vibrating it with the toes just in contact with the ground. The
other leg, meanwhile was kept rigid. Often, but not always, this would
be followed by the chick taking a pace or two forward and pulling a

<bodyText confidence="0.994804289473684" page_id="56319707"  page_num="81" year="" vol="">
worm from the peat. Evidently this vibration caused worms near the
surface either to move or expose some small part, so giving away their
position. It is well known that earthworms respond to vibration, but
differently according to the degree of the disturbance. Walk across
soggy pastureland and you will hear worms all around withdrawing into
their burrows with your every footfall. When the disturbance is more
severe, as with digging, worms will often come right out on to the
surface of the soil, perhaps mistaking the disturbance for a burrowing
mole. It was probably more than coincidental that I observed in
February 1981, after overnight frost, a Lapwing pacing amongst several
mole heaps on the unfrozen marginal land of Sutton Bingham Reservoir,
Yeovil. It picked and probed at the heaps, and may well have been taking
advantage of prey disturbed by moles working below.
Diminishing preference for wet ground
As the chicks grew, they demonstrated a declining requirement for
a wet substrate day and night. By Day 21 they were spending most of the
day resting on dry or only slightly damp compost during the hot weather.
Juvenile Lapwings in the wild have to adapt to a habitat which becomes
drier as spring gives way to summer.
Continuing development
The characteristic two-syllable call was first heard in rudimentary form
on Day 15. At this date wing coverts were just starting to emerge from
sheath. Also by this date there was a discernible gradation in size of the
three remaining chicks.
From Day 16, stewed apple was offered and small amounts were
readily taken. The heat lamp was not required during the day, but con-
tinued at night, having been on continuously from Day 1. By this stage
most earthworms were being taken at night. During the day there was a
preference for large ones. Bathing now involved deliberate wetting of the
plumage as opposed to mere wading. It involved a rather tentative tail
bobbing to wet the ventral area, and a dipping action to wet the head,
neck and breast.
From Day 17 onward, as the drought conditions were making it in-
creasingly difficult to obtain sufficient earthworms and woodlice, sub-
stitute foods were offered and taken. Chopped boiled egg, supplemented
with lean beef mince and tinned baby food mixed with milk became the
basic diet.
By Day 21, with the weather continuing very warm, observation

showed that the heat lamp was not required even at night. Remiges were
out of sheaths to the extent of showing about 1 cm of vane.
On Day 25, and occasionally thereafter, to supplement the unnatural
diet, a quantity of freshly dead fish fry and live daphnia was offered in
a shallow pan of water. Both these prey were readily taken. Additionally
some larvae of the Small Eggar moth were offered, but not surprisingly
on account of their hairy skins, were ignored.
As the hot spell continued, and even though ample ventilation was
provided, the conservatory on the south side of the house became hotter
and more humid than outdoors, so I thought it would be beneficial to
transfer the chicks to the outdoor aviary where they would also have more
room and become acclimatised. Therefore on 8th June (Day 28) they were
put outside, and for the first two days all was well.
A deeper pan of water was provided for their by now more complete
and energetic bathing. It was on about this date that the characteristic
head bobbing was noticed. There was much calling "pee-witt".
However, on 10th June there was a sudden drop in the temperature
accompanying heavy overnight rain. There was a danger of the chicks
becoming chilled. As soon as I could I transferred the chicks back into
the conservatory and put them under the heat lamp. But my action was
not prompt enough to save one chick the next day. A description of its
plumage (at about 30 days old) from its skin is as follows:
Bill dark grey; culmen about 2.5 cm, forehead to crown, to back of
head - dark brown - black tipped with buff. Crest projecting about 1 cm.
Nape downy, off-white. Mantle medium brown, tipped with light brown
and the back the same. Rump downy, showing vestigial light brown-dark
brown coloration of chick (the "pepper and salt" natal camouflage pattern)
with some rufous feathers at base. Upper tail coverts rufous-buff. Rec-
trices (10) about half the vane out of sheath, the outer two almost pure
white; the next inner pair white proximally, black distally and with
rufous-buff tip; the emerged part of the remaining retrices all black with
rufous-buff tip. Undertail coverts rufous-buff, but not with the intensity
of coloration that adult birds have. Feathering round the vent white.
Lower breast, belly, flanks, tibia feathering - all pure white. Legs flesh
coloured. Pectoral band dark brown-black, with some feathers tipped
with dingy white. Throat dingy white. Face mottled "pepper and salt"
pattern. Remiges (about half emerged): outer three primaries Nos. 1-3
dark brown, with central dingy white blotch. Remainder (Nos. 4-10)
black with slight green sheen; secondaries (about half emerged) dark
brown-black. Scapulars long, i.e. projecting well beyond emerged secon-

daries, and brown tipped buff. Primary greater wing coverts - coloration
as for secondaries. Median wing coverts less dark, tipped with buff and
with more greenish sheen. Lesser wing coverts dark brown-black. Under-
wing coverts white.
When the danger of heavy rain passed the chicks were transferred
back into the outside aviary. Feather development continued so that by
Day 38 flight was first observed. But the previous day one of the two
remaining chicks found a small gap in the aviary netting, released itself
a little prematurely into the garden, and promptly disappeared.
Release
As I could not provide a spacious enough aviary or even grounds for
a full-winged Lapwing, I decided to release the remaining bird back into
the wild. A farm a few miles away was chosen, because it had the kind of
land favoured by Lapwings out of the breeding season. In addition there
was a paddock of rather more than an acre around a stream and pools,
surrounded by high netting (which keeps out most ground predators) and
where is kept a collection of mostly pinioned exotic waterfowl. It was
thought that release into the paddock would enable my bird to try out
its flying skills whilst having short cropped turf and wet margins to forage
on, and eventually to join with post breeding flocks when they appeared
on the farm a few weeks later.
So on 19th June (Day 39), a day after having first been observed to
fly, it was released in the paddock. It remained in the vicinity of the
paddock for at least the next two days. Thereafter my visits were infre-
quent and contact was lost. Hopefully it joined with a flock passing over.

NOTES ON FERAL ROSE-RINGED PARAKEETS
By DEREK GOODWIN (Petts Wood, Kent)
Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998405342857143" page_id="56319710"  page_num="84" year="" vol="">
The Rose-ringed or Ring-necked Parakeet Psittacula krameri is probably
well known to most of my readers. It is a slender, elegant bird, its body
not very much larger than that of a Starling Sturnus vulgaris but with a
long pointed tail and rather long wings. Its plumage is a bright but delicate
green with much yellow on the outer tail feathers. The bill is mainly red.
The male has black at the sides of the throat and a pink ring round the
back of his neck. Actually this ring, although usually appearing a delicate
silvery pink, is composed of bright, orange-tipped feathers which are (at
least the orange parts of them) overlaid by the bluish silvery extreme tips
of the feathers immediately above them on the bird's neck. This I dis-
covered, to my surprise, when examining specimens in the British Museum.
The name Rose-ringed Parakeet is less often used in avicultural circles
than Ringneck or Ring-necked Parakeet but I prefer it, as it is more des-
criptive, is used in Forshaw's monograph on parrots and avoids confusion
with Barnardius bamardi , the Australian species also known as Ringneck
Parakeet or Mallee Ringneck Parrot.
A comprehensive paper by our member, Mr. G.A. Smith, on the beha-
viour of the Rose-ringed Parakeet in captivity, together with good sketches
of its various displays and postures, and much other information was
published in our Magazine in 1972; much of this information but not, alas,
the sketches, is also to be found in his excellent book (Smith 1979).
Readers seriously interested in this species are recommended to read
Smith's writings on it. This article merely records some rather casual obser-
vations I have made on Rose-ringed Parakeets off and on, mainly "some-
where in Kent", between the autumn of 1974 and the present time of
writing (mid-October 1982). Their only merit is that they are observations
made on birds that were completely free. My first Rose-ringed Parakeets at
liberty, indeed the first time that I saw any parrot at liberty, was in the
grounds of Cairo Zoo during the war years. This was during brief periods
of leave from the desert; I only saw the parakeets a few times and recall
little of them save the vivid impression made on me by their beauty and
their wild, impetuous-seeming flight, during which the bird rolls from side
to side in the air.
Attracted by their loud calls, I and my friend Eric Knowles saw our
first English feral Rose-ringed Parakeets in the autumn of 1974. There

were eight of them, six adult males and two that were either hens or
immature males. They were clinging, clambering and fluttering on the
bark of a great Cedar of Lebanon, in a garden adjacent to a public foot-
path. We watched from a discreet distance. Several individuals and parties
of people passed within a few yards of the noisy and conspicuous birds
without noticing them! We thought something in or on the bark must be
attracting the parakeets but had no proof of this. After they had flown,
first into the higher branches of the Cedar and then away, we never once,
from that day to this, saw them on that tree.
Population and numbers
As I said, on the first occasion we saw the parakeets there were eight.
Subsequently over the years we most often saw from two to six birds but
once in the summer of 1979 I saw 18, about a third of them hens or
imrnatures, perched in one tree. A party of nine was seen on 3rd March
1982. These last were very active and vocal so had clearly survived the
rather hard winter of 1981/2 without harm.
Examination of specimens in the museum did not suggest the possi-
bility of distinguishing independent juveniles from hens "in the field" and
some of the courtship postures (see Smith 1972) are suggestive of food
soliciting. I have not seen any definite feeding of juveniles by adults (only
of hens by their mates) nqr any young looking out of nest holes. I have,
therefore, no evidence at all that there has been any successful breeding in
the area between 1974 and 1982. This in spite of the fact that a pair have
nested every year in the same tree, two pairs nested this year (1982) in
trees about 500 yards apart, and I think on much circumstantial evidence
that three or four pairs have nested every year. Some of the places where
I believe nest sites to be are on private land where it is not possible to
search for the nesting holes.
Quite a few people are aware of the presence of the Rose-ringed
Parakeets in this area. It is, therefore, possible that the nests are being
regularly robbed of the young when the latter are old enough to handrear.
Since unsexed immature birds of this species cost #30 each in a Kent pet
shop, such human predation on the species seems all too likely!
Feeding
I once saw two Rose-ringed Parakeets in Surrey feeding on the catkins
of some sort of poplar. Parsons (1982) has recorded them flocking to feed
on Hornbeam seeds elsewhere in Surrey. I have never seen any "serious"
feeding by "my" Kent birds. They could, of course, easily be overlooked

when feeding in trees in leaf in summer. Both in Brazil and Australia I
have observed that some parrots are very quiet when feeding in trees, in
great contrast to their noisiness when in flight. However, I think that
serious feeding is done well away from their nesting areas and probably
largely from bird tables in nearby suburbs or towns. Certainly cock birds
in the breeding season periodically fly right off in the direction of one or
other of three built-up areas, returning after about half an hour and then
usually calling the sitting hen out of the nest-hole and feeding her.
I have never seen them showing any signs of hunger. Often, in hard
winter weather, they appear well-fed, and are certainly active and vocal,
when most of the native wild birds around them appear to some extent
subdued by hunger.
Social and reproductive behaviour
I think the main attraction for them of the areas where I see these birds
is the presence of nest sites. One or several adjacent trees seem to be used as
meeting or loafing places by up to 18 in one instance, as I described in the
introductory section. These always seem to be based on or in the immediate
vicinity of a tree containing a regular nest site. From 1975 until 1980, a
tall ash standing in a field (very near to woodland) was "the meeting
place". Since then this tree (at least when I have observed it) appears sel-
dom to have been used except by the pair nesting in it and, usually only
for a few minutes on the way back from a feeding flight to his sitting mate,
by the cock of a pair nesting in a small wood about 500 yards away from
it. In 1981 and 1982, the corner of a small, rather well sheltered and
"sunny" wood about a third of a mile from the ash tree, has been used. I
think probably two and just possibly three pairs nest in this area.
Although single birds, sometimes certainly cocks whose mates are
sitting are seen in flight (and heard, for flying birds usually call frequently),
they appear to prefer to fly in company. A lone bird, calling loudly in
flight, is sometimes joined by one or more others, or may be diverted by
others answering it and alight near them, only to take wing again after a
few minutes. Sometimes I have had the impression of a bird deliberately
"calling for" another to join it on a feeding flight, flying to and alighting
briefly in the "meeting tree(s)", whence it then departed with a companion.
The cock of the pair (I do not, of course, know whether it has been the
same pair each year) that nests in the field ash and the cock of the pair
that nests about 500 yards from it, often behave in this way.
All courtship and allied behaviour that I have seen has been as described
by Smith (1972). I have not, however, had the impression of the male hav-

ing "very real terror" of his mate. I suspect that if Mr. Smith's birds really
were terrified (as distinct from a little fearful, shy or diffident), this was
probably caused by their close captivity and inability to escape at will
from the hen. The killing of males by females, of which Smith (1972) gives
instances, is, I imagine, almost certainly an artifact of captivity just as,
in some circumstances, driving cock pigeons may kill their mates when
both are confined, though this does not, and almost certainly could not,
happen under natural conditions.
At times, apparently immature birds (mostly males, judging by their
behaviour as they were seen indulging in courtship movements or what
were probably such) have been seen. Whether these are birds that have
actually been bred in a feral state or merely "new"escapees joining the
established birds, I do not know. Usually when I have seen more than a
couple of pairs, adult males have been in the majority. For two years
running, I think in 1977 and 1978 (unfortunately I have lost my file with
the parakeet notes in and am having to do this article from memory and
this year's notes), two cocks were a constant trouble to the pair nesting
in the field Ash. As soon as the cock of the nesting pair had departed on
a (presumed) feeding flight, they would be at the nest-hole within min-
utes. This at once brought the hen to the entrance, where she repulsed
them as often as they advanced. They appeared to wish to court her and/
or to look into the hole. On the occasions that I watched, the hen spent
most of the time that her mate was absent defensively in the nest entrance.
When her mate came back, he appeared to know what to expect and
would fly, with angry-sounding calls, extremely fast for the last few hun-
dred yards. Usually the two cock birds would flee as soon as they heard
him coming but sometimes they delayed, and then they would be furiously
chased for a short distance. However, though they then often seemed to
vanish completely, back they were round the hole again as soon as the
cock flew off to get more food.
I think these two cocks were homosexually paired. I sometimes saw
one ( I think at different times both) preen the other's head; they never
showed the slightest aggression towards each other and they habitually
flew together. This last is, of course, no evidence, as cocks whose mates
are sitting may also fly together.
Pairs start to re-visit old nest sites in late August or early September.
Smith (1972) considered that male Rose-ringed Parakeets had little interest
in the nest-hole as such; later (Smith, 1979)although stating that males
"seem to have no interest whatsoever in nesting arrangements", stated
that they may chew at the nest entrance and "sometimes may 'crane-

peer' at the entrance hole".
From what I have seen of feral birds, I think the cock is interested in
the nest-hole as well as in his mate, as on autumnal visits to the nest site
the cock is often the first to fly down from the top of the tree and perch
near to the hole. From this position, he frequently calls and (not at the
moment of calling) lowers his head and body in a bowing movement
rather like that of his sexual display except that he does not First draw
himself "up and back".As he bows forward, the nape feathers are so
arranged that the pink neck ring looks much thicker than usual, and is very
conspicuous if one looks down at the bird from above as, of course, the
hen in the tree top does.
Perhaps it will be of interest to describe one such nest site visit:
"4th November 1982. Pair came flying, calling in flight, and alighted
about 12 feet apart in the top of the field ash . Cleaned their bills
repeatedly and vigorously on their perches. Then they rested for about
five minutes. The male suddenly took wing, with a single call, flew down
in a steep, part circle and alighted on the branch in front of and about
12 feet from the hole. He kept calling at intervals in various modulated
tones, especially with an odd vibrant sound, not heard in the "kee-ack"
flight call and suggestive of the "kwerp" calls of the Black-headed Gull.
Also frequently bowed forward to perch, his pink neck ring very promi-
nent as he did so.
"After some six or seven minutes the hen gave two calls at short
intervals, then flew down and alighted about six feet from her mate. The
cock then began to clamber up along the thin branch that grows towards
the hole. He looked nervously towards the hole, with elongated neck,
then stepped from the branch to the trunk and clung there about four
feet above the hole. The female flew to the hole, alighted just below it
and moved up until she was hanging from its lower edge. Her tail was
widely spread, every feather clearly separate, and pressed against the
trunk. She began "crane-peering" (as described by Smith) alternately
looking into the hole and drawing as far back as she could without losing
her position. The male then flew up, alighted on the trunk about four
feet to one side and above the hole, then moved towards it so that he
could, by stretching his neck, lean down and peer into the upper part
of the hole each time the hen drew her head back from peering in."
I have seen pairs apparently searching for new or alternative sites
in late winter. I had my best view of this on 1st January 1981. The birds,
just as is the case with Stock Doves, feral pigeons and swifts, were attrac-
ted to shadowed and dark spots that merely looked like cavities, as well

as actual holes and broken-off stumps of branches.
Except in the case of the two persistently interfering cock! already
mentioned, usually only a pair of birds are seen in the immediate vicinity
of a nest-hole. On two occasions, however, I saw an excited mob (this
seems the best descriptive noun!) of at least seven or eight flying round a
nest-hole, individuals continually fluttering up to it, either to fall away
at once or to do so after clinging to the trunk for a moment. The behaviour
was, at least superficially, very like that which one sometimes sees from
House Martins at a nest with well-grown young. On the last of these
occasions I went to where I could get a better view of the nest-hole. Doing
this, however, caused the parakeets to take alarm and flee so the fact that
I saw no young, or anything else to account for their interest, does not
prove that there was not some creature or creatures within the hole that
had caused the commotion.
Nest-sites
Of the four sites in which I know the birds have nested (from their be-
haviour, as, short of cutting open the nests, there would have been no way
of proving the presence of eggs), three are in old nest-holes of the Green
Woodpecker Picus viridis. The other was in the partly rotted underside of
a sloping branch. This appeared to have only a very small cavity and al-
ways to be in imminent danger of the cavity walls rotting completely
away, as indeed they did after about five years. It was, however, clearly
the site that most appealed to the birds as, so long as it was in existence
they ignored the old Green Woodpecker hole at about the same height in
the trunk of the same tree (the field Ash) to which they subsequently
moved.
These two sites were about 20 feet above ground level, the other two
were much higher up in an ash and an oak tree respectively. Holes that
are large enough for a Stock Dove Columba oenas, and at least one that is
not quite large enough for this, as I have seen Stock Doves trying in vain
to enter it, appear to be of no interest to the Rose-ringed Parakeets .
Possibly holes made by the Greater Spotted Woodpecker Dendrocopus
major are too small (though one would think that the parakeets could en-
large them) as I have not seen them used. Old holes of this species are, of
course, like their makers, more abundant than those of the Green Wood-
pecker. Another possibility is that Greater Spotted Woodpecker holes may
be even more liked by the Starling and that it can and does prevent their
use by the Parakeet.

D. GOODWIN - ROSE-RINGED PARAKEETS
Inter-actions with other species
Species that are neither potential predators nor competitors for nest
sites are never, so far as I have seen, interfered with in any way by the
Rose-ringed Parakeets. Nor have I seen any such bird show fear of them.
Some of those people who are implacably opposed to any intro-
ductions except those made in the interests of blood sports, commerce or
food production, have claimed that if the Rose-ringed Parakeet becomes
established it will compete with native species for nest sites. They are care-
ful to make this accusation vague and generalised but I will be specific in
countering it.
So far as I have seen, holes of a size suitable for the Stock Dove, Man-
darin Duck Aix galericulata or any of the owls, do not interest the Rose-
ringed Parakeet. If they did, it is highly unlikely that this bird would be
able to hold them against any of the species listed above. Stock Doves nest
every year in holes in two trees in which the parakeets that I have watched
regularly nest and .others do so in all areas in which I suspect the parakeets
nest. Neither species shows any hostility to, or indeed interest in, the other.
The parakeets show neither alarm nor anger when a Stock Dove is perched
close to their nest-hole.
This is in contrast to the attitude towards the Starling Stumus vulgaris.
When hanging on the trunk, looking into their nest-hole, parakeets are
sometimes "dive-bombed" by Starlings. Conversely, I have often seen a
Parakeet, always the hen of the pair, drive away a Starling that has come
near her nest-hole. If a pair of Parakeets are at a little distance from their
hole, the approach of a Starling to the hole will always induce the hen
either to chase it away, or to quickly get between it and her nest-hole.
In one instance, a hole which a pair of Rose-ringed Parakeets were
visiting in the late winter had in it later in the spring, a Starling's nest from
which young fledged. So it is possible that the Starling may sometimes
succeed in driving off the Parakeets. On the other hand, at least two of the
nest sites have been retained by Parakeets although, as stated, I have no
proof that any young have ever fledged from them in spite of constant
interest in them by Starlings. If, occasionally, a pair of the latter are
displaced by parakeets, this is hardly going to be a mortal blow to the
status of the Starling, either in Britain or throughout its now enormous
world range.
"But", the anti-Rose-ringed Parakeet faction will say, "If the Rose-
ringed Parakeet and the Starling are in competition for woodpecker holes,
what about the woodpeckers?" What about them indeed? Well, in such
areas as this, where the sort of trees in which woodpeckers can drill holes

exist only in small woods, clumps or single trees in fields, all within half
a mile or less of towns or suburbs, most new woodpecker holes (except
those of the Lesser Spotted Woodpecker D. minor) are taken over by
Starlings as soon as or a little before they are finished. This is especially
the case with the Greater Spotted Woodpecker. If I remember rightly,
Dr. Hans Lohrl published a paper some years ago in which he reported
that in an area of Germany where he had studied it, the Greater Spotted
Woodpecker lost all its newly-made holes and only succeeded in rearing a
brood if it finally laid in a derelict old hole, unwanted by Starlings. I
think the situation is much the same in many parts of Kent and Surrey.
As the Rose-ringed Parakeets select their nest sites well before the time
of year (late March and April) when woodpeckers make new nesting holes,
it seems unlikely that they would even if equally abundant, which they are
never likely to be, ever rival the Starling as a competitor of breeding wood-
peckers. The most serious long term enemies of our woodpeckers are, of
course, council, forestry and other officials who remove dead, dying and
diseased timber.
The birds of prey and corvids that regularly inhabit the area are the
Sparrowhawk Accipiter nisus , Kestrel Falco tinnunculus, Tawny Owl Strix
aluco , Carrion Crow Corvus cor one, Magpie Pica pica and Jay Garrulus
glandarius. Sparrowhawks are few in number (I have only seen three
different individuals there in the past six months or more) and the Tawny
Owl is normally roosting by day. I have never seen either of these in sight
of a Rose-ringed Parakeet so I do not know what the latter's reaction to
them would be.
I have often seen Jays and Magpies quite near to parakeets and have
never seen the latter pay them the slightest attention. One of the nesting
trees (the field ash) is a very favourite resting place for Magpies but the
Rose-ringed Parakeets never seem to mob them.
This is very different from their reaction to the Carrion Crow. Nesting
Rose-ringed Parakeets violently mob Carrion Crows if they come within
yards of the nest-hole, giving their alarm calls vehemently and "dive-
bombing" the crow repeatedly. Even crows perching in the top of the
nesting tree or in neighbouring trees are often attacked in this way. Occa-
sionally I have seen parakeets, sometimes a lone bird, sometimes a pre-
sumed pair, mobbing a crow in flight at a distance from any nest site. One
of my most vivid memories is of a single parakeet seen dive-bombing a
crow in the air below my eye level. It appeared as if it actually landed on
the crow (though this may well have been an optical illusion) and for a
moment I had in my binoculars the unforgettable picture of the slender,

vivid green bird superimposed, wings spread, upon the larger, shining
black one!
Although not so numerous as Carrion Crows and Magpies, Kestrels are
always present in the area. Usually the Rose-ringed Parakeets pay them
little attention. Once I was watching a cock Rose-ringed Parakeet that was
perched in the top of a tree, I think in the immediate vicinity of its nest-
hole (I was looking down from a footpath at the small private wood in-
volved). As usual there were Stock Doves and Wood Pigeons resting nearby.
A cock Kestrel came gliding over the tree tops and those Stock Doves and
Wood Pigeons more or less in (or rather under) its line of flight took wing
to either side but the parakeet showed no obvious reaction. This greatly
surprised me even though I had often seen parakeets and one or more
Kestrels perched in the same tree without heeding each other as it seemed
unusual, and I should have thought unwise, for any bird to allow a Kestrel
to fly closely over it. The Kestrel often gives the impression of being an
inefficient and half-hearted predator where birds are concerned but this
impression may be far from correct. Some Kestrels, probably most ex-
perienced adults, are very quick indeed when they see a good chance to
catch a bird.
However, I have never seen a Kestrel show interest in a parakeet, nor
until about two weeks ago, had I seen parakeets show alarm at one. Then,
however, two parakeets were perched in the field Ash when a Kestrel
swooped down and alighted in the top of it. As he did so, both parakeets
flew up with loud alarm cries. They did not mob the Kestrel but flew
around with hesitant flight and then went off to the vicinity of the other
nest site some 500 yards away. I think they had noticed the Kestrel only
when it was already near and moving fast towards them and this caused
their fear.
It would be interesting to know whether the very different behaviour
shown by nesting Rose-ringed Parakeets towards Carrion Crows and Mag-
pies is due to experience in this country or to the fact that throughout
most of their natural range the Magpie does not occur whereas black crows
do and, like some other birds, Rose-ringed Parakeets have an innate recog-
nition of them as potential predators on fledgelings. I think the latter is
more likely, but I may be wrong. However, some of our members who
breed this species, or have observed it in India, will, I hope, be able to
inform us on this point.

ment. No doubt that bird gave much pleasure to its royal mistress but I
doubt if as much as I, a mere commoner, am now vouchsafed when I watch
the beauty and exuberance of flight of this lovely exotic at full liberty.

TOOL-USING AND RELATED BEHAVIOUR IN BIRDS:
MORE NOTES
By JEFFERY BOSWALL (Bristol)
</sectionHeader>

Since the publication of my 1978 paper (Avicultural Magazine , Vol. 84,
No. 3, p. 162) some further observations on tool-using by birds have come
to light; and some corrections and re-appraisals also need to be made.
Borderline cases in wild and captive birds
That the Common Crow Corvus brachyrhynchos might use motor cars
to crack open nuts for them was first suggested by Maple (1974) and has
now been shown by Grobecker and Pietsch (1978) to be the case. At Long
Beach, California, they twice saw a bird drop a palm fruit on a road and
wait for a passing vehicle to break it open. It would appear that the Carrion
Crow Corvus corone in Shetland will "often drop large seashells on the
roads and await passing lorries", though no more details are given (Conder
and Everett, 1979).
Further examples of using a bait to attract fish are described. Harry
Shrives - in a letter, dated 24th October 1967, to Leslie H. Brown - des-
cribed how a Green-backed Heron Butorides striatus on a partly submerged
rock in the Kiboko River, would fly to the bank on which lay some boiled
maize, left by some anglers, pick up a grain and then fly back to the rock.
The grain of maize was then carefully put in the water, upstream of the
rock, and watched intently as it floated by. As it went almost out of reach
the bird would retrieve it and repeat the performance. If the grain was
taken or lost the bird would fetch more. Although the bird was watched
for half an hour, it appeared to have been unsuccessful in &amp;quot;attracting a fish.
However, a party of American bird-watchers said that just before Shrives
began his observations, the heron was seen to make a catch. The Kiboko
flows past Hunter's Lodge on the main Nairobi-Mombasa road in Kenya
and this same bird, or another doing the same thing, was photographed at
the same spot in either 1967 or, more probably, 1968, by Juanita Carberry
(in litt.) who observed an identical incident except that the heron was
using bread (see Plate i).
In January 1968, W.J. Eggeling watched a Green-backed Heron at the
same location. The following extracts are taken from his unpublished
account (Eggeling, 1974) deposited at the Alexander Library in Oxford.
"This pond contained a multitude of fish ranging in size from several
pounds in weight to mere minnows. The water was very clear, several

feet deep at the bank near at hand but shelving very gradually on the far
side. Feeding the fish was an attraction to visitors and at one place where
a drain debouched a shoal was always in evidence and the red earth of the
bank was bared and flattened by human feet. As we sat, a Green-backed
Heron flew down from a spreading Acacia tree and searched diligently
around the bared space. Suddenly it saw a small white object (later iden-
tified as a short length of a synthetic straw), picked this up and flew with
it to a tiny island near at hand .... On alighting, the heron adopted a
crouching attitude and, with neck outstretched low over the water, dropped
the object which it carried. Slowly this drifted away from the islet, the
bird's bill following almost imperceptibly, ready to strike. Nothing hap-
pened. Just as the object was almost out of reach, the heron lifted it and
tried again. Once more nothing. This time the heron took out the object
and bore it to another island, to try from there. Again nothing happened,
the bait drifted out of reach and the bird flew off. A few days later.......
I rose at dawn and went over to the pond but it was some time before a
movement high up in one of the thorn trees drew my attention. The heron
had roosted there and was just waking up. It stretched and preened, and
later flew down directly to the same bare patch as before. It searched
around but found no suitable bait. Then, out in the water, something
brown and white caught its eye. This was a crust of bread, the outside end
of a loaf, lying partly submerged on top of a tangle of water-weed, inac-
cessible from below because of the density of the weed growth. Without
hesitation the heron picked up a piece of this bread and flew across to the
first islet from which it had previously fished. There was a boil as soon as
the bread touched the water and the bait vanished. There was no strike;
the fish which had taken the bait was presumably too big. The heron tried
again, using another piece of bread. The same thing happened. Next the
heron went to another Island; again the boil was that of a big fish, again
there was no attempt at a strike. Several times more the heron tried from
this stance, always the result was the same. Finally, it took another piece
of the now much smaller crust and flew over to the other side of the pond
alighting on a stone close to the shore in water only two or three inches
deep. As before the bird was crouched, the neck and bill outstretched
above the bait, the eyes intent. There was no boil this time, instead the
water dimpled and the floating bread jigged up and down. The heron
struck; it had caught a fish about IVz inches long!"
It has come to light in Florida that Green Herons Butorides virescens
have been seen baiting fish at two sites additional to those already known.

27th Avenue, Miami) there is an artificially constructed lake about 100 x
300 metres in size. Here Gloria Cashin (discussion, June 1979) saw, photo-
graphed and filmed a Green Heron that regularly baited fish with bread
provided by Miss Cashin. This behaviour was first observed about 1974
and was most recently seen in June 1979. The bird would take a small
piece from a large lump of bread and place it on the water surface, catch-
ing the fish thus lured. The bird would also re-position the bait if it drifted
to an inconvenient position.
Further north in Florida, Mrs. Vincent Newell (discussion, June 1979),
who lives on St. Lucie Boulevard, Fort Pierce, had a Green Heron (photo-
graphs of which I have seen) which visited her large natural-looking garden
pond for a period each year for several years, from about 1972 to 1977.
The bird often caught fish which had been attracted to bread thrown for
them by Mrs. Newell, and "quite often" over the years the heron was seen
to move the bread, particularly when it floated too close to the rock from
which the fishing was done. Mrs. Newell formed the impression that if the
bread was too directly below the bird, the fish would be less likely to
come: and this is consistent with the crouching posture and near horizon-
tal strike angle shown by the Miami Seaquarium bird, for example (see
Plate ii).
In Cuba, at the Havana Zoo in 1967, James Hancock (discussion, July
1979) saw a wild Green Heron placing and replacing a food item on the
water surface of a lake for the purpose of attracting and catching a fish. It
was successful.
According to the latest revision of the taxonomy of the heron family,
the birds from East Africa and North America referred to above are treated
as races of the species B. striatus (Hancock and Elliott, 1978).
By a coincidence (unless it was a case of observational learning), at
Hunter's Lodge in Kenya in one of the same two years of 1967 or 1968 as
the Green-backed Heron was seen baiting fish, Alan Root (taped interview,
1978) saw a Pied Kingfisher Ceryle rudis behaving similarly. The bird
would retrieve from the water surface a piece of dry bread thrown out as
fish food and carry it to a branch above the water. Root then saw the bird
drop the crust on to the water and, subsequently, dive down and capture a
fish that had come to feed on the bread. Root had been told of this
individual bird's behaviour by Malcolm Coe who (in litt. 1978) recalls that
he "was having tea by the water of a dam which was stocked mthTilapia
and Black Bass". It was the practice for the staff of the lodge to throw
waste bread on to the water which attracted large numbers of feeding fish.
"As I sat there, a Pied Kingfisher flew over the water and "stooped" and

picked up bread and then carried it back to a yellow fever tree on the
other side. The bread then fell on the surface and the bird sat there direct-
ing its gaze at the water. When the fish broke the surface to feed on the
bread it "swooped" on the fish and caught one."
Judd (1975), writing about a Blue Jay Cyanocitta cristata, that had
been in captivity for 18 years, tells how, when the level of water in the
Jay's drinker got too low to drink from, it put "solid objects, such as bits
of food and trash, into the water to raise the level within its reach."
(Aesop, in his fable illustrating that "little by little does the trick" has a
crow do the same thing 2,000 years before the Jay). This use of objects to
raise a water-level does not meet the stricter criteria for true tool use. In
any case, the observation on the Jay was recorded briefly and without dis-
cussion and it is difficult, therefore, to be certain that the objects were
dropped purposely into the water to raise its level.
To the list of birds that regularly use anvils upon which they shatter
hard-shelled prey can be added the Tooth-billed Bowerbird Scenopoestes
dentirostris. It is said, by Marshall (1954), to live "essentially on fruit, but
it eats insects and large ground molluscs which it sometimes cracks on a
special stone that is often near the display-ground".
Rand (1954) attributes heaps of broken shells found by stones in the
forests of Siguijor Island in the Phillipines to the work of the Ruddy King-
fisher Halcyon coromanda. His evidence was only circumstantial however.
I know of no other case of a species of kingfisher that uses an anvil for
snails whereas several kinds of pitta are known to do this.
Two species that are not usually thought to smash snails - the Pied
Flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca (Page, 1978) and the Stonechat Saxicola
torquata (Fisher, 1979) - have recently been reported as attempting to do
so.
Under the title "Tool-using by a Black Eagle?", Dick and Fenton (1979)
describe the behaviour of an adult Aquila verreauxi, apparently acting in
defence of its nest. During 90 minutes the bird, approaching its (empty)
nest in an Acacia tree, dropped 11 sticks from a height of about 20 m. that
fell within 3 m. of the observer who was standing about 10 m. from the
base of the nest tree. The repeated dropping of the sticks may represent
an effort to drive away a potential predator as the authors suggest, but
there may be an alternative and more parsimonious interpretation.
True tool-users in captivity
Two additional instances of parrots scratching themselves with imple-
ments have been reported.

In the summer of 1975 Mrs. Katharine L.Regan (in litt. 1976) and her
sister saw a Sulphur-crested Cockatoo Cacatua galerita or sulphured, at the
London Zoo, holding a lolly stick about four inches long in one claw and
scratching itself all round the crest and face, eyes shut and "obviously
ecstatic".
An African Grey Parrot Psittacus erithacus owned by Dr. Irene Maxine
Pepperberg (in litt. 1978) of Indiana, "routinely employs pieces of wood
(and) keys to scratch the underside of his beak and head.In addition
to the scratching performance, I have noticed an additional behaviour
which might be considered tool-use. If a piece of paper or a flat leather
toy I call a "hide", which is about two inches by three, is on top of his
cage(where he spends a good deal of his time), my Grey will occasionally
use (one of these) as a tray for pieces of food or other toys (e.g. he will
use the hide to catch "crumbs" of nuts: he will then carefully pick up and
consume these bits). " In a subsequent discussion Dr. Pepperberg agreed
that although an example of sophisticated object-use, the deliberate
positioning of an object to catch -food particles cannot be regarded as a
true tool-use. Plate iii shows this bird scratching its head with a stick.
The behaviour of a Yellow-fronted Amazon Parrot Amazona ochro-
cephala panamensis is of particular interest. The bird is reported by its
owner, James J. Murphy in Washington State, USA, (in littl. 1978) to
"regularly use an inverted metal toy bell as a 'cup' to eat from". The
18 month old parrot "scoops up a quantity of mixed seed with the in-
verted bell held in his beak. The bell is then transferred to either foot
and eating commences. This action is usually repeated several times,
then the bell is gently placed back in the seed tray till next time .I
have often found the bell submerged in the water tray, I strongly suspect
that the parrot often drinks in this manner as well .....a few days ago a
comical situation arose when the bird tried - without much success - to
eat a large portion of carrot by holding it in his bell "cup". The cup was
so small and the carrot so large by comparison, that the bird had con-
siderable difficulty in keeping the large carrot in the cup and still chew on
the other end. This bird has eaten every food item given him out of the
cup, i.e. dog kibble, apple slices, turkey pellets, etc. Food items are never
placed in his cup. He always manages this for himself." (see plate iv).
Parrots normally pick up objects with the beak and then transfer
them to the foot, as this Yellow-front did. In the light of this, it seems
likely that the "Staffordshire" Lesser Sulphur-crested Cockatoo C. sul-
phured, that drank from nut shells and a spoon, also first baled with its
beak and then transferred the vessel to its foot; also with the unidentified

species of cockatoo that used empty monkey-nut shells to scoop up water
(Boswall, 1977, p. 97).
We must be cautious, however, because Mr. Murphy says that the
Yellow-fronted Amazon "often approached his seed tray and reached in,
not with his beak, but with his foot. After some shuffling about he ex-
tracts a clenched hist&amp;apos; full of seeds which are brought directly to the
beak where normal shelling and eating takes place. The clenched "fist"
of seeds remains high near the mandible as the seeds are eaten. This
action is usually repeated two to three times each session. I don't believe
this action is a daily occurrence. The motivation behind this kind of
activity is likely a form of environmental enrichment by mimicking the
actions of the people he sees around him; for his large cage is set high on a
stand within easy viewing distance of the dining table." Another example
of a parrot picking up scraps with its foot refers to a Lesser Sulphur-cres-
ted Cockatoo (Bertagnolio, 1979).
Mr. Murphy's male Coffin's Cockatoo C gofflni displayed an unusual
form of tool-using. The bird was kept, temporarily, indoors, housed in a
large cage, and demonstrated considerable dexterity with an empty, cir-
cular metal container. The container was about three inches across and
three or four inches deep. The cockatoo grasped the container by the holes
on its top with his foot and struck at a bell suspended from the cage top.
"The resulting noise was quite impressive" and usually occurred early
morning or late evening. A variation of routine was to "grasp the container
with his foot, and the bell with his beak, and clash them together at about
one beat a second for between five and fifteen repetitions. The resulting
acoustics were less impressive, but what (they) lacked in volume was made
up for in frequency". Mr. Murphy comments "beyond the obvious learned
component of this behaviour, there may be an innate component as well.
The temporal arrangement of the observed commotion coincided with the
often noted periods of noisy activity generated by this species, and others,
in the captive and wild state. However, since this bird was not raised in
isolation, this is pure speculation".
A Lesser Sulphur-crested Cockatoo owned by Mr. and Mrs. Colin Long-
thorp of Hull uses screw-on type soft-drink bottle tops to bale water and
drink from. The bird takes the bottle top in its bill and brings it through
the cage bars by first turning it on its side (as it is shallower than it is wide).
He then transfers the bottle top to his left foot before taking it back be-
tween his mandibles, often rotating it for some time before then scooping
water from the pot in his cage. The bird then assumes an upright posture,
the container of water still in its bill At this point the bird may or may

not use one foot to help re-position the bottle top more horizontally in
the bill before tilting his head backwards and simultaneously tilting the
bottle top backwards by tightening its grip with the bill. The movement of
the cockatoo's neck muscles shows that some water at least is drunk. Some
also "misses" and wets the outside of his bill. Occasionally, either as a
result of the adjustment of the position of the bottle top in the bill or as a
result of a jerky head movement much of the water spills down the bill on
to the cage floor. Either way, the bird then brings its head forward and
takes the bottle top from the beak with a foot. It is discarded within about
three minutes by placing it in the water pot or the seed pot or by dropping
it onto the cage floor or outside the cage. No bottle top is used more than
once as a scoop. Plates v and vi illustrate the stages in this procedure.
An apparent case of implement-wielding by a captive Greater Sulphur-
crested Cockatoo C.galerita was reported by Kawata (1974) from Indiana-
polis Zoo. The keeper, Bob Newell, wrote: "While I was cleaning the cage,
I saw two cockatoos busily engaged in some kind of activity in the corner.
One was using what appeared to be a flat stone. Holding the stone by the
flat surfaces it scraped away the earth from a spot where the wall meets
the floor". On a later day, both Newell and Kawata saw the bird holding a
small stone and, apparently, using it for scraping earth. "I am not sure
whether the digging was actually aimed at escape or just the moving aside
of already loosened dirt and an occupational activity", Newell added.
I asked George A. Smith to comment on this account and he wrote: "A
common pattern of behaviour of captive parrots is for them to take a
stone in the bill, steady it with a foot, and then spend what can be consid-
erable amounts of time appearing to break off small portions to swallow as
gizzard-grit. Frequently such "play" stones are dropped into drinking
vessels - drinking with a stone in the bill might be a difficult thing to do -
or in nest-boxes - presumably because they need the bill empty to chew
away at the interior. Certain it is that captive parrots can be extremely
covetous of their play-stones and will try to prevent other parrots from
filching them by flying up, and working away at them, in a 'secret' cor-
ner; for one parrot observing another whittling away at a stone will often
approach and try to take it away for itself. The assumption is made that
being largely arboreal birds, of tropical rain forest, grit could be difficult
to come by in the humus of the forest floor. Parrots - unlike all other
birds known to myself - therefore, by this behaviour could acquire small-
sized grit from large stones. Parrots digging holes as, for example, excava-
ting a nest-chamber, loosen "detritus" with the bill and then scratch this
back with alternate movements of the feet. The cockatoo, in the account,

Captive Common Crow using a coffee stirer as a tool to operate a response key
behind the metal screen. The screen prevents the bird from pecking directly at
the response key. When the response key is operated, the bird is rewarded with food
raises the problem of whether it was coincidental that it had a stone in its
bill whilst digging (a coveted toy it held dearly to itself whilst otherwise
engaged: like a child that takes his Teddy bear everywhere with him) or
was it utilising the stone as a shovel, as an implement, a tool? That it
several times repeated the shovelling with the stone makes me suppose
that this was an example of "true" tool-using; but before giving an opinion
I would like to see it for myself." In the absence of a more detailed obser-
vation, and experiment, this case must remain not proven.
Jewett (1924) quotes observations made by a Miss Adelaide King, of
the U.S. Biological Survey, on a captive Northwestern Crow Corvus cau-
rinus. "While passing through the City Park in Portland, Oregon, one
afternoon recently, I saw a crow in one of the bird enclosures trying to
pry a peanut out of a crack in a bamboo perch on which he was sitting.

perch. This drawing was inspired by an observation on a captive bird in the city
park in Portland, Oregon, made by Jewett (1924).
(Reproduced from "Ravens, Crows, Magpies and Jays")
This bamboo perch had a* rather large crack in it, and a peanut that had
been thrown into the cage had lodged there. The crow worked with his
bill for quite a time, unsuccessfully. He then stopped and looked on the
floor of his cage. Observing a small stick he picked this up and flew back
on the perch and worked on the peanut with the stick. With this he was
able to push the peanut along the crack, but not to get it out. When he
had pushed the peanut quite near the edge of the cage, he hopped around
to the other side and pushed in the other direction. He finally succeeded,
with the little stick in his bill, in prying the nut on to the floor of his cage,
where he jumped down and got it." Angell (1978) published a drawing
inspired by this account which is reproduced in Plate viii.

J. BOSWALL - TOOL-USING
True tool-users in the wild
No fresh examples of tool-using in wild birds have since come to light.
Two, however, ought to be deleted from my previous list (Boswall, 1977).
On pp. 152-155 (loc. cit.) doubt was cast on the claim that the Black-
breasted Buzzard Hamirostra melanostema (now called the Black-breasted
Kite) used objects to smash the eggs of ground-nesting birds: particularly
the Emu Dromaius novaehollandiae. Stephen J.J.F. Davies kindly permits
me to quote his letter of 6th December 1978 in which he stated that this
bird of prey "is a species that has interested me greatly because it actually
breeds at the same time as Emus in Australia's north-west and can be seen
quartering the ground, at the time the Emus are incubating, probably par-
ticularly searching for eggs that have been laid away from the nest. Tom
Spence, the Director of the South Perth Zoo, has captive birds and follow-
ing up some of the early literature he presented one of them, confined in a
cage by itself, with an Emu egg which it opened by striking it with its bill.
The egg opened on the first blow and neither Tom nor I is in any doubt
that this is how the birds deal with Emu eggs. They probably take the eggs
of other species as well. Their feet are small and weak (and) ill-adapted to
carry large stones. A much more probable explanation of the stones found
in Emu nests is that the Emus themselves rolled them into the nests. There
is an interesting note in Emu (Schrader, 1975) describing an Emu sitting
on a "nest" of Paddy-melons in Queensland. These small melons resemble
Emu eggs in colour and size - although the shape is slightly different. This
is an extreme case of Emus collecting egg-like objects but we fairly fre-
quently find stones, insulators, etc. in Emu nests". Unless, and until, any
scientific evidence of implement-wielding on the part of this raptor comes
to light it can no longer be considered a tool-user.
Alfred Russel Wallace believed that the Palm Cockatoo Probisciger ater-
rimus opened the hard Arecanutby biting off apiece of leaf to lay between
the nut and the upper mandible and so prevent the nut from slipping from
the mouth. After quoting his account in full (Boswall, 1977) I suggested
that aviculturists owning Palm Cockatoos might be able to observe and
comment on Wallace's finding. George A. Smith (in litt., 1978), who has a
pair of these birds, had offered them leaves when feeding such hard-
shelled nuts as Brazils and almonds. "They ignored the leaves completely
and easily cracked the nuts open without their help". He says, "I have
been quite unable to see just how the fresh leaf, in Wallace's account,
could wedge the nut. Apart from not understanding how the bird could
manage to cope with holding a leaf in the bill and then taking up the nut,
it seems to me that the juices expressed from the leaf, by the pressure of

the bite, might well have the effect of a lubricant and actually cause the
nut to spin. Like other parrots when the Palm Cockatoo breaks open hard
or shiny objects, it uses its toes (or, sometimes, presses the object against a
hard, firm surface, such as the horizontal bars of netting) to assist the
tongue in preventing the rotational forces set up by the huge biting force
of the lower mandible. With the roughened inner surface of the upper bill
to fasten its top, the thumb-like tongue pressed hard behind it, a toe, or a
fixed solid object, at its front the poor nut doesn't stand a chance".
It is worth mentioning that Skead (1975) gave the actual reference
(Alexander, 1838) to the November 1836 Namaqualand note on the

early record of tool-using by a (presumed) Egyptian Vulture appeared in
the Port Elizabeth Telegraph for 27th August 1867 (Brooke, 1979).
It is worth noting that the observations on tool-using by Bald Eagles
Haliaeetus leucocephalus, quoted by Van Lawick-Goodall (1970) without
a reference, had been published by Bindner (1968).
The use of tools by captive Common Crows, reported in my last paper
(Boswall, 1978) is illustrated, with a photograph, by the same two authors,
in an earlier paper of theirs (Powell and Kelly, 1975) - see plate ix.

To those not familiar with its work, the Hawk Trust may appear to
be devoted only to diurnal birds of prey, but it has always been con-
cerned also with owls. Since the Trust was established there has been a
welcome increase in the numbers of most birds of prey in Britain. The
outstanding exception, however, is the Barn Owl Tyto alba.
This once widespread and common species has been declining in
numbers for many years. In 1934 Blaker estimated the total population in
England and Wales as 12,000 pairs, but in 1973 Parslow put it in the
range of 1,000 to 10,000 pairs, while in 1976 Sharrock estimated 4,500 to
9,000 pairs. These estimates suggest that the population may have halved
in 40 years, but the ranges in which they are set certainly suggest that the
status of the species is in great need of investigation.
There are indications that the decline is accelerating. Osborne quoted
figures showing a reduction in an area of Oxfordshire from 34 pairs in
1971 to 14 in 1979, in the Isle of Wight from 30 to 20 and in West Dorset
from nine to one. Two surveys of farmland birds published in Bird Study
in the 1970's both recorded a breeding pair of Barn Owls in 1968 but none
thereafter.
The Bam Owl has long been associated with farms and changing con-
ditions on them are among the many causes suggested for its decline.
Modernisation of farm buildings, the use of silos in place of corn ricks and
the felling of hollow trees have reduced the number of roosts and nesting
sites as well as the numbers and accessibility of prey. According to Prestt
the Barn Owl came second only to the Sparrow Hawk Accipiter nisus in
damage from toxic chemicals in the 1950's and early 1960's. Unlike the
Sparrow Hawk, it has not recovered. Recent research in America by
Mendenhall and Pank has shown that some rodenticides are fatal to owls.
Many are killed by road and rail traffic and by hard winters. Finally, the
Barn Owl is even now persecuted by some gamekeepers although Glue
found remains of only one gamebird in 42,000 prey items in the analysis
of Barn Owl pellets.
As David Glue has said: "It would be difficult to name a bird that is
more beneficial to man than the Barn Owl". For this reason also, the
Hawk Tmst has decided to investigate the causes of its decline and to deter-
mine whether it can be aided to recover. A large number of county surveys
are already being undertaken on the Trust's behalf by bird clubs and

natural history societies, and our own members are conducting local
surveys in many areas. It is hoped that we can also acquire the co-opera-
tion of such bodies as the B.T.O., the R.S.P.B., the N.C.C. and the Avicul-
tural Society. A most welcome financial support has already been received
from the Game Fair Committee of the Country Landowners' Association.
It is clear from the wide range of recent population estimates that the
first need is an accurate census of the Barn Owl, and a questionnaire is
now being circulated to any person who is interested.If members of the
Avicultural Society would like to participate, they should apply for a
questionnaire to: Barn Owl Survey, The Hawk Trust, Freepost, Becken-
ham, Kent. If you do not have the time for a proper survey, any observa-
tions you can make now may well be a guide to those who have. A second
questionnaire has also been devised which asks for information from bird
rescue centres about any disabled Barn Owls which have been presented to
these centres in the last four years and this can also be requested from the
Trust.
Finally, any dead Barn Owls found should be sent for examination to:

John's many friends, all over the world, will have been very grieved to
learn of his death on 24th January after a long illness, bravely and cheer-
fully fought.The gap he leaves cannot be filled but anyone who was lucky
enough to know him will always retain a fond memory of his kindness and
courtesy, his wry humour and his great wisdom - about people as well as
birds.
John grew up with birds, his father having charge of the collection of
the Marquess of Tavistock (later 12th Duke of Bedford) which was housed
in aviaries in the gardens of the Yealland family home at Binstead in the Isle
of Wight. John went to work at London Zoo when he was 17, as a keeper
on the staff of the Western Aviary and a photograph exists of him in the
Zoo's football team of that day. When his father died in 1922, John left
the Zoo and took charge himself of the Duke of Bedford's collection
which was moved from Binstead to Warblington, Hampshire, later to Rye
in Sussex and then to Haywards Heath. When World War II broke out he
was in Belgium, just outside Brussels, looking after the private collection
of Dr. J.M. Derscheid, who was later to die tragically in a Nazi camp. In
1940 John managed to get on one of the last boats leaving before the
German invasion. Whilst the other refugees on the crowded boat were
clutching their most precious belongings, John doggedly nursed a pair of
rare ducks in a cardboard box all the way back to safety in England. The
rest of the war years were spent in the Civil Defence and later in the
army, in the Royal Signals, on water transport, stationed in Cornwall.
He spent 1946 at Slimbridge where he helped to start the Wildfowl
Trust. The following year he joined forces with Gerald Durrell on an ex-
pedition to the then British Cameroons, collecting for the zoos that were
restocking after the war. A highly amusing and interesting account of
their adventures with people and animals was written by Durrell (now
Hon. Director of the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust) in his book "The
Overloaded Ark" (Faber &amp; Faber). He writes now: "I shall always rem-
ember what a joy and an education it was to watch John looking after his
collection of birds. He was so meticulous and so devoted to his charges
that it was a pleasure to see him work. For example, with his insect-eating
birds (of which, towards the end of the trip, there were about 150) he
would go out and collect wild wasps' nests and then, with tweezers, feed
each and every bird the wasp grubs individually. He was a very astute

observer and a most delightful companion with a gay and witty tongue. I
think the whole avicultural world has lost one of its great men."
In 1950 John Yealland travelled to the Hawaian Islands and most
important amongst the birds that he brought back were the first Hawaian
Geese (Nene) to found the Wildfowl Trust's breeding programme to save
this species, and later that year he also cohected Iceland ducks for the
Trust.
In 1951 he rejoined the staff of the Zoological Society of London, this
time as Curator of Birds, a post which he held, with great distinction, until
his retirement in 1969. Under his curatorship the bird collection at Lon-
don Zoo flourished and his determination sought out many birds and
collections of birds from all over the world to restock the aviaries depleted
by the war years.He set a very high standard of husbandry, as well as using
his other great interest, in horticulture, to ensure that the aviaries, both
outdoor and tropical, were suitably and attractively landscaped and plant-
ed. Malcolm Ellis was one of the young keepers who trained under John
Yealland and he writes now: "We addressed him always as'Mr. Yealland',
but unbeknown to him (I think) many of us knew him affectionately as
'the little man'. We would mimic the way he would gently incline his
head to one side and slowly say, 'Yes'. We will remember how he would
listen patiently and after careful consideration, say 'Yes' each time. And
the times when, convinced by this that we had his agreement and were
about to turn away, he would conclude by saying, slowly and with
firmness, 'No. I don't think that is a good idea' and, having so replied, we
knew he would not change his mind. During the period that John Yeal-
land was Curator of Birds, the collection was of a high standard. He was
respected because he had been a keeper, because of the extremely con-
scientious way he went about his duties, because of his knowledge of birds
and his meticulous attention to detail. No statement was made before he
had carefully checked the facts. I shall always be grateful for the help and
encouragement which he gave me."
During his curatorship he must have answered many thousands of
enquiries from the general public as well as other aviculturists, and always
with unfailing helpfulness, sound advice, and often humour - I can hear
him now patiently advising yet another, rather demanding caller on how to
feed a young abandoned street pigeon, by suggesting that she should chew
some raw cabbage and then regurgitate it - and the responding horrified
squawk from the other end of the telephone. He took a keen interest in
other collections and there must be many successful aviculturists today
who can be thankful to John for his help and advice when they were

starting out in birds.
In 1974 he succeeded Miss Phyllis Barclay-Smith as Honorary Editor of
the Avicultural Magazine , and brought to this work a lifetime's knowledge
and experience, as well his renowned meticulous attention to detail.
During his Editorship the Magazine reached a new high standard and after
he retired from this post at the end of 1978, he continued to give me
unfailingly good advice as well as checking all the proofs of the Magazine
with the greatest care. Some of his margin comments were gems to be
cherished, such as, 'One would have more faith in what Mr. -- is describing
if he knew how to spell it'. I know of no one now whose knowledge of
birds, plants, nomenclature, geography and grammar equals John's and
his contribution to the Avicultural Magazine was inestimable.
Our President, Dr. Jean Delacour, writes of him: "I remember John
Yealland as a boy when his father was in charge of the Marquess of Tavi-
stock's birds, mostly parrots, and it so happened that he was connected
all his life with collections that were very familiar to me as I was either a
close friend of their owners, or a member of council of the institutions for
which he worked.
"Through this I came to know him well and to appreciate his considerable
qualities. John was small, quiet, unassuming; he had a great sense of
humour. To the exaggerations of over-enthusiasts he had a mild way of
answering that stopped wild stories without offending their authors. He
had a great knowledge of all sorts of birds which he had collected and kept
during his busy life. He proved to be very successful in all his assignments
and took a very important part in the progress of aviculture during the last
fifty years. He thought clearly and wrote well.
"John Yealland will be greatly missed by his friends and by all those
aviculturists throughout the world who have gained, through his efforts,
a better understanding of birds, and have learned of a more intelligent way
of taking care of them".

Among the increasing number of species being reared in Britain, it is
pleasing to note that two species of rare parrots, the Red-fronted Macaw
Ara rubrogenys and St. Lucia Amazon Amazona versicolor reared for
the first time in 1982. Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust's success with
the latter is a significant event as it represents the first captive breeding
of this critically endangered species.

One of the rarest birds in the world, and the rarest in Africa, has been
found in Natal by two Durban ornithologists. The White-winged Flufftail
is said to be so rare that it was once thought to be extinct until a dead bird
was found eight years ago, below a powerline in Heidelberg in the Trans-
vaal. Dr. John Mendelsohn, the acting curator of the Durban Museum, and
Mr. Ivan Sinclair, the Museum's taxidermist, recently found 12 of these
birds at the Franklin Marsh in East Griqualand. {Natal Mercury)

was awarded to J.J. Mare for breeding the Shaft-tailed Whydah Vidua

Professor J.R. Hodges writes: "Aviculturists all over the world will be
sorry to learn of the death of Dr. L.A. Swaenepoel, a member of this
Society since 1966. His success in establishing the Belgian Ornitho-
logical Association is well known. Almost 20 years ago his work, with
drugs like tetramisole, on the eradication of round worms and hair worms
came to the attention of breeders of parrots, particularly Australian para-
keets, and he soon developed an international reputation as an authority
on Nematology. He had great enthusiasm and flair for keeping and breed-
ing, often to several generations, rare species of parakeets. He was particu-
larly interested in mutations and was the second breeder, after the Keston
Foreign Bird Farm, of the albino form of the Indian Ring-necked Parakeet.
He also had considerable success with other mutations of the same species,
particularly the blue form. In the last few years he has been one of the
most successful breeders in Europe of the yellow mutation of the Tur-
quoisine Parakeet and the deep pink ('Rosa') form of the Bourke Para-
keet. He travelled widely in this country, in South Africa and in Australia
where he was received warmly by eminent aviculturists whom he impressed
with his charm and courtesy. He was a respected, highly educated and
cultured man who will be sadly missed by all who were fortunate enough
to know him."

ESTRILDID FINCHES OF THE WORLD by Derek Goodwin
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.980529961538462" page_id="56319742"  page_num="116" year="" vol="">
Published by Oxford University Press, price #25.00
Derek Goodwin, until his recent retirement, was a Principal Scientific
Officer in the Department of Zoology of the British Museum (Natural
History) and is well-known to readers of our Magazine for his regular con-
tributions. His articles are always informative, amusing and sometimes
controversial but never dull or boringly written.
"The Estrildid Finches of the World" is truly the triumphant outcome
of that rare bird, the scientist who is also an aviculturist, and who can
write well. Between its covers is the most comprehensive treatise ever
written on this highly successful and attractive family - a group that in-
cludes the firetails and grassfinches of Australia, the waxbills and fire-
finches of Africa, and the munias, avadavats and parrot finches.
The opening chapters describe the nomenclature, the distribution and
adaptive radiation, the plumage and coloration, the behaviour and biology
and notes on the care of estrildids in captivity. The author then goes on to
describe every member of the Estrildidae, each with a distribution map
and notes on its physical appearance, field characters, habitat, feeding and
general habits, nesting, voice, display and social behaviour, avicultural
notes and finally a most useful list of references.
This is a very beautifully produced book, enhanced by the colour
plates painted by Martin Woodcock that illustrate over 60 species, as well
as numerous line drawings. It is bound to become the standard reference
on the Estrildidae and is highly recommended. We would like to wish
Derek Goodwin a very long and happy retirement and hope that he is
using his newly-acquired leisure to produce more work of this calibre.

During the past decade the number of books covering one particular
group of birds has increased greatly, to the advantage of the aviculturist
and the ornithologist who require detailed information, and this book is
an excellent addition to this category.
It is one of those rare and valuable finds: a book whose author is
familiar with his subjects in aviculture and in the field. In the preface he
describes how the front wall of his office was removed and replaced by

glass. It formed a large planted aviary in which all the Australian species
of doves were kept. Most of them bred there. In addition, the aviary was
dotted with microphones which fed into a tape recorder on his desk,
which also held a permanently focussed camera.
On reading that, I was confident that the text would be highly detailed
and authoritative. Indeed, it is. Furthermore, its value to aviculture is
great. Most aviculturists outside Australia are not familiar with the Austra-
lian doves, except the Diamond; nevertheless, any dove keeper can apply
the information this book contains to species that originate from other
countries.
This is a highly readable account of the Pigeons of Australia, and the
main part of the book - 25 of the 27 chapters - is given over to the
accounts of the species.
These are preceded by a chapter on Biology of Pigeons and another on
Aviculture. The latter gives valuable advice on various aspects of manage-
ment, as well as detailing the requirements and habits of all the Australian
species. Each species is covered under the headings of Historical, Descrip-
tions, Relationships, Subspecies, Size, Field Identification, Voice, Habitat,
Routine, Distribution and Movements, Food, Display, Postures, Breeding
Season, Nest, Eggs, Incubation, Development of Young, and Status.
Unfortunately, the colour plates do not match the high standard of the
text. Six of the seven colour plates were drawn from birds in the aviaries
of the CSIRO Division of Wildlife Research. While they may accurately
convey the plumage and appearance, they are totally lacking in imagination.
Where various forms of the same species are illustrated, e.g. female and/or
immature, each bird is shown in identical pose. Also, the artist has failed
to capture iridescence in plumage. The single plate by F. Knight, which
shows juvenile plumages not known when the earlier plates were drawn is
far superior.
The section of photographs showing habitat is of outstanding interest
and conveys more effectively than thousands of words the types inhabita-
ted by the various species. Photographs depicting several species in the
wild, their nests, young and feeding habits, are equally valuable. Aspects
of behaviour are illustrated in line drawings, also in the 32 pages of photo-
graphs, some from captive birds, others in the wild.
This book is quite remarkable value at #14.95; these days one would
expect to pay no less than #20 for such a volume. It is a rare item: a
readable, scholarly work which does contain, as the jacket notes suggest:
"a magnitude of scope and a wealth of detail expressed with clarity, con-
cern and wisdom". How sad that the author did not live to see it in print.

BIRD DETECTIVE by Peter Robinson
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997682421052632" page_id="56319744"  page_num="118" year="" vol="">
Elm Tree Books/Hamish Hamilton, in association with the Royal Society
for the Protection of Birds. #7.95 (U.K. only)
The RSPB is Europe's largest wildlife conservation organisation which
employs over 300 full-time staff only four of whom are permanently
engaged in law enforcement. Peter Robinson is the Senior Investigation
Officer of this organisation and in this book he relates a collection of true
stories involving these four investigators.
The author investigates theft, the sale of stolen goods, assault and mur-
der on behalf of the wild birds of Britain. Although he is based at the
Society's headquarters at Sandy in Bedfordshire, Peter Robinson estimates
travelling about 30,000 miles each year in connection with this work.
Chapters include accounts of successful prosecutions for the unlawful
taking of Peregrine Falcon chicks and eggs, Golden Eagle eggs, the use of
a gin trap, shooting a Kestrel, selling newly-taken species including those
incorrectly ringed, and a taxidermist for selling illegally killed wild birds.
Further chapters deal with Osprey eggs, the illegal use of poisons, shooting
protected species, Fenn traps and the abuse of the licensing provisions for
the importation of endangered species. A short chapter deals with the Pro-
tection of Birds Acts, notwithstanding the 1954 Act which Mr. Robinson
says has "several shortcomings".
This book makes interesting albeit disturbing reading, particularly the
chapters concerning those persons illegally importing endangered species
and those prosecuted for trapping and selling wild species and who call
themselves aviculturists. The manuscript for this book was written before
the Wildlife and Countryside Act came into force and hopefully with the
introduction of this new legislation, fewer prosecutions will be brought
before the courts.
In his summing up on "The Future", the author makes it clear that he
has little faith in the bird-keeping fraternity. He states: "I would like to
be able to say with confidence that all, or even most, of the existing
abuses will come to an end with the introduction of the new Act, but
truthfully I cannot see it happening. Parliament is just not making the sort
of changes necessary to remedy shortcomings made obvious by past ex-
perience - what is about to become law will probably also include a num-
ber of new concepts. The passage of time is bound to reveal as yet unfore-

It is, however, encouraging to report that the Department of the En-

LOOKING AFTER CAGE BIRDS by David Alderton
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.945725875" page_id="56319745"  page_num="119" year="" vol="">
Ward Lock Ltd. 128 pp, 69 coloured photographs, several drawings
Price #6.95
An attractive and well-produced book, it is printed on glossy paper
throughout. The coloured photographs are of a high standard. The draw-
ings, especially those of the birds, are not nearly so good.
David Alderton writes mainly about keeping in cages but also other
ways of keeping indoors, Canaries, Budgerigars, Bengalese and an assort-
ment of more exotic birds (seedeaters, parrots and softbills).
In the Introduction, there are very brief descriptions of the early
history of keeping birds, current trends, the supply of birds and, choos-
ing a pet bird. Then there are chapters that describe housing, feeding,
daily care, breeding and colour inheritance, and health disorders. These
contain a lot of sound advice.
In the remaining three chapters, the author writes about the varieties
and species. Some have a fairly detailed write-up, several have little more
than a mention. All of the commonly kept groups of parrots seem to
have been included, many, among them macaws, cockatoos, Amazon
parrots and species such as the Quaker Parakeet and Patagonian Conure
on the grounds that individuals can make good pets and may talk. The
Forpus parrotlets (two Guiana parrotlets are the subject of a colour
photograph) and Australian parakeets are mentioned, though the advice
is that they are not suitable to keep in cages.
By contrast, the coverage of the seedeaters is patchy. There is no
mention of such popular "cage birds" as the Avadavat, the Red-billed

Fire finch and the Bronze and Tri-coloured Mannikins, yet included are
the Violet-eared Waxbill and the seldom available Cape or Grey-necked
Canary, which is also afforded a colour photograph. The photograph on
the top left of page 70 definitely is not as the caption states, the wild
Canary Serinus canaria but is, I feel fairly certain, a Brimstone Canary S.
sulphuratus. The Zebra Finch apart, the grassfinches are not mentioned,
which is curious, considering that some breed regularly in cages and are
virtually domesticated. Only two British/European finches are mentioned
and only fleetingly with regard to their hybridisation with canaries.
The coverage of softbills is very limited and the least satisfactory. The
races of the Hill Mynah have incorrect subspecific names and, if "the"
Yuhina is indeed also known as the Flowerpecker, it is not a common
alternative name and could lead to confusion with the flowerpeckers of
the family Dicaeidae.
A lot of space in this book is wasted on account of the over generous
page margins. These mean that on many pages over one-third of the width
of the page is blank paper.

The Red Siskin
We would like to draw your readers' attention to the current status of
the Red Siskin Carduelis cucullata.
Perhaps some background material would be helpful. The Red Siskin is
endemic to Venezuela but due to excess hunting by the bird trade, it is
now at the brink of extinction. In the past the male Siskin was crossed
with the common Canary to obtain the more profitable red Canary. Al-
though it is now illegal to hunt the Siskin in Venezuela, due to the ex-
treme rarity of the bird, the price has gone sky high and this, in turn, has
resulted in increased pressure on the very few remaining wild populations.
Audubon de Venezuela, as a conservation group, has taken on the project
of encouraging experienced and creditable aviaries in Europe and the
United States to breed this species for subsequent sale as we believe this to
be the only way the bird will be saved from extinction and, also, the most
logical way to augment the gene pool.
We realise that the Red Siskin is very difficult to breed as the female

especially is an extremely sensitive and delicate bird, but among your
readers must be many who have bred it in the past, and with the increased
price of the Siskin, it would probably be more profitable to breed the Sis-
kin itself, keeping track of blood lines, etc., than to breed the red Canary.
We would like to express our appreciation for any interest you might
take in this project and we would be grateful for any encouragement along
this line that you might give to reputable aviculturists in Europe. Perhaps
just spreading information about the Red Siskin will help in the effort to
save it from extinction.

Red and yellow Diamond Doves
Ever since a writer in our Magazine said that red and yellow Diamond
Doves had been bred in South Africa, I have been intrigued as to what
these birds looked like but had seen no description of them anywhere.
Recently, in correspondence with a South African ornithologist, Neville
Brickell, I mentioned this and he kindly promised to try to look into this
for me.
He soon kept his promise and I received recently a letter from him in
which he says: "I have visited Mitchell Park and a few other aviaries and
found that the Diamond Doves stated to be yellow are, in fact, the silver
strain with a buff tint over the mantle, wings and rump. The area around
the head and underparts is silver." After some information about the
different colours found in the silvers, from silver grey to dark grey, etc.,
he continues: "The so-called red Diamond Doves are, in fact, chocolate
in colour over the mantle, wings and rump. The head area and the under-
parts are the colour of wild grey Diamond Dvoes".
From this it sounds as if the "red" is just the reddish brown tinge often
seen in wild Diamond Doves (though I myself have never seen it in domes-
tic Diamond Doves in England) and the "yellow" the dilute form of it.
However, by an odd coincidence, another correspondent sent me an
advertisement that recently appeared in "Cage and Aviary Birds". This
offers red, yellow and orange Diamond Doves, all at #90 per pair!
The price asked is reminiscent of the high prices fetched by the first

blue Budgerigars, though the purchasers of new-coloured Diamond Doves
could hardly hope to recoup their expenditure through successful breeding
owing to the heavy taxation that self-employment or "extra" income of
any form now attracts.
I hope that some of our richer readers will purchase these new coloured
Diamond Doves and, especially if they prove to be brighter than those that
Mr. Brickell saw in Durban, let us have a full description of them in the
Magazine.

Unusual Feeding Habits in Parrots
Further to Professor Bertagnolio's letter on Unusual Feeding Habits in
a Lesser Sulphur-crested Cockatoo (Avicultural Magazine 1979, 85(1 ):31,
I have possessed a cock African Grey Parrot for the past eight years which
regularly picks up objects in his foot. When housed in a conventional
parrot cage, this bird used to feed regularly by picking up a "fistful" of
seeds from the clip-on feeding dish. This was done with the bird facing
away from the dish, feeling backwards with the foot until the dish was en-
countered, whereupon three or four seeds would be picked up together.
One or two of these would subsequently be dropped while eating from the
foot. The bird always started by feeding in this manner, that is when most
hungry, only later changing over to the more normal method of feeding.
The bird never seemed to look at the dish, always giving the impression of
locating it solely by touch. This same bird will also obtain objects outside
the cage by holding on with the bill and one leg while reaching out with
the other leg to grasp the desired object.
For the last three years a hen Blue-fronted Amazon has been caged
next to this bird. In January this year (1983) I noticed the Amazon
attempting to obtain a piece of orange which the Grey had discarded and
which lay just inside his cage. At first the Amazon attempted to reach it
with the bill but when this failed she rather hesitantly extended one foot
out through the bars and just managed to grasp the orange this way. The
distance between the cages is four inches and I got the impression that this
was the extreme limit of her reach. On several occasions since I have tested

this bird and she has always succeeded in obtaining an object in this
fashion but it is only very recently (April 1983) that she has started to
steady herself by grasping the cage with her bill while reaching out.

THE AVICULTURAL MAGAZINE welcomes original articles that have not been
published elsewhere and that essentially concern the aviculture of a particular bird or
group of birds, or that describe their natural history. Articles should be preferably
typewritten, with double spacing, and the scientific names as well as the vernacular
names of birds should be given. References cited in the text should be listed at the
end of the article. Line drawings should be in Indian ink on thick paper or card;
photographs which illustrate a particular point in the article will be used where
possible and should be clearly captioned.

By R. GOUDSWAARD (Senior Bird Keeper)
A pair of Tawny Frogmouths was received from Melbourne Zoo on 7th
June 1978. The birds started breeding in their second season with us but
there is very little detailed literature available on the breeding of frog-
mouths and it was not until December 1981 that we were successful in
rearing chicks. This article describes the husbandry of frogmouths at the
Wellington Zoo and subsequent breeding.
Housing
On arrival the birds were quarantined for one month in the Zoo's hos-
pital and then moved to their present aviary. The aviary is small - 5m x
1.75m x 2.5m high - and was traditionally used to house owls. The small
size of the aviary allows the public to see the birds roosting in the shelter
at the back during the day. The back of the aviary is enclosed on three
sides and roofed to provide shelter. The rest of the aviary is open to the
weather and boasts a grass floor, two small shrubs, two tree stumps and a
single horizontal perch. The shelter has two horizontal perches fitted in
such a way that the birds are still visible from the front of the enclosure.
Feeding
The Frogmouths have proved very easy to keep. They are hand-fed two
or three freshly killed mice each per day. As the mouse, held by the tail,
is raised above the Frogmouth's head, the Frogmouth opens its beak and
the mouse is simply dropped in. When on occasions mice are in short

supply, the birds are fed small cubes of meat dusted with bone meal
powder. At different times a variety of invertebrates, namely mealworms,
Wetas Hemideina thoracica and earthworms have been provided but never
taken.
The female stops eating during the winter. After a particularly cold
night with temperatures below 2*C she becomes sluggish and loses her
appetite. At these times feeding is delayed until the female has a chance
to warm up in the afternoon sun. Occasionally she may go two or three
days without feeding. If freshly killed mice are not available, then thawed
frozen mice are heated before being fed to the birds in mid-winter.
A dish of water is provided at all times but I have never seen the birds
drink.
Medication
On arrival the female was suffering from a mouth ulcer. The ulcer was
treated daily with a paste consisting of Vice Penbritin and 3g Spercin.
Although effective, the problem proved to be a recurring one and it was
not cleared until eight months later after a prolonged treatment of 'Frador'
applied topically and ^cc Mycostatin smeared over her food twice daily.
Once the ulcer had cleared, the treatment was gradually reduced over a
further two month period.
The only other medication they have received was an attempt to in-
clude the Frogmouths in the regular worming programme. Aviverm was
injected into their mice prior to feeding but once the mouse commenced
digestion, the birds must have been able to detect the Aviverm because the
partly digested mice were later found on the floor of the aviary.
Breeding
The birds are slightly different in appearance. The male is larger,
slightly darker, particularly on the crown, and appears to have a larger
head and beak.
Imminent breeding is signified by the birds remaining strangely alert
during the day. When they are in this state, they refuse to be hand-fed, the
male more so than the female. But if the food is left in the aviary over-
night, it has usually gone by morning. At any other time, as in most insti-
tutions, food left in the aviary is never touched.
The first time this strange behaviour was noted in the male coincided
with spring and on 16th September 1979 a nest consisting of alow sided
wire basket lined with twigs and feathers was provided in the shelter. On

23rd September, the female began to reject hand-feeding and four days
later she spent most of the day on the nest. During the afternoon she was
relieved by the male and he continued to incubate during the day while
she incubated at night. Care was taken not to disturb them and the two
eggs were not seen until 24th October. At 8.00 a.m. on 28th October, one
egg was found to have pipped but the following morning the egg had
vanished except for a few shell fragments on the ground. The second egg
was proved to be infertile.
On 10th November 1979 the male was again incubating and two eggs
were seen on the 16th. Incubation is usually taken to have commenced
when the male spends all day on the nest although he may spend several
hours on the nest each day for several days prior to the eggs being laid. On
13th December small fragments of shell were found on the ground and
only one egg remained in the nest. The egg was transferred to an incubator
but failed to hatch. In the following season, two eggs again disappeared on
hatching, on 6th November (1980).
Our intention had been to feed the chicks in the nest as we had been
advised to do by the Melbourne Zoo. In the light of the recent failures,
it was becoming apparent that we would have to remove the eggs to an
incubator prior to hatching.
On 23rd November the male was again incubating but this time the
eggs proved to be infertile.
In 1981 the first two eggs of the season came to grief on 1st October
when the branch supporting the nest collapsed. The male starting incuba-
ting again on 7th October and the egg was first seen on 19th October but
it had vanished by 8th November. Fortunately the female proceeded to lay
for a third time and the male commenced incubation on 19th November.
On 15th December the two eggs were placed in the hatcher of a force
draft incubator, set at 37.5*C and 75% humidity. The eggs hatched on
17th and 18th December respectively.
When newly hatched, the chicks are too weak to raise their heads al-
though they can shuffle about. The chicks were placed in a cut-down
yoghurt pot, lined with paper, which became their nest. In two to three
hours the down started to fluff out and the chicks could raise their heads.
At this point they were fed two or three small morsels of minced mouse,
particularly pieces of lung and liver. The feeds were repeated every two
hours and the number of morsels gradually increased. Later in the day, raw
egg and bone meal flour were added to the minced mouse. This diet has
proved successful for hand-rearing Morepork Owls, Barn Owls and Pukekos.
Unfortunately, the chicks were found dead at 6.00 a.m. on 20th December

after a particularly large meal at 9.00 p.m. the night before. They have
such large beaks that it is always a great temptation to put too much into
them.
On 6th October 1982 another chick was hatched in the incubator and
this one was reared to maturity using the minced mouse diet. Although the
growth rate was comparable to that described by Kenton C. Lint, of San
Diego Zoo, the diet was messy and the bird had to be cleaned at regular
intervals. When two further chicks were hatched in the incubator on 13th
and 14th November, I took the opportunity to experiment with the diet.
These two chicks were reared entirely on moths and whole mice. Not
only was this diet clean and easy to feed but the growth rate was pheno-
menal - see Table 3. Nocturnal moths were chosen because they would be
the most obvious food source for birds in the wild state. The chicks were
fed small grass moths and plume moths for the first few days and then pro-
gressed to the larger Porina species. However, these moths are only 2cm
long and when the chicks were two weeks old, they were each consuming
up to 16 of these moths at one feed. In the birds' native country of
northern Australia and New Guinea moths of 12 cm wingspread would be
common and one of these giants would constitute a meal on its own.
To supply the moths, up to four ultra-violet light insect traps were kept
operating in the Zoo each night. The traps were placed in sheltered posi-
tions, preferably so that the light was visible from downwind. The moths
tend to fly up against the wind towards the light. Most of the moths are
caught in the first two hours after sunset. Wet windy nights resulted in
poor catches although light rain by itself was not detrimental to the catch.
The moth diet was interspersed with baby mice. The size of the mice
was gradually increased as the chicks grew older, but the moths appeared
easier for the chicks to digest. If the chicks were fed a lot of mice, the
faecal sacs became very dark, loose and smelly. If the chicks were fed a lot
of moths, the faecal sacs were well formed and the dark waste matter was
contained in a bag of jelly which was clean and easily removed.
As before, the newly-hatched chicks were placed in a yoghurt pot and
they had to be removed from this nest twice a day to allow them to
defaecate. The chicks seem to have a natural aversion to soiling their own
nest and not providing this liberty to the first two chicks hatched 17th and
18th December 1981, may have contributed to their death. As the chicks
grew larger, they were able to raise their posteriors over the side of the
nest to defaecate.
The chicks were kept in the hatcher for the first day. They were then
transferred to a still-air curfew incubator and the temperature was gradu-

ally reduced over a two-week period. At night the chicks were taken home
and placed in a small portable incubator. For the short distance to and
from home, the chicks were carried in a bucket containing a warm hot
water bottle and covered with a towel.
One the body feathers began appearing, the chicks were transferred to a
metal drum of approximately lm diameter with 30cm high sides. The
drum was lined with paper and branches were provided for perching. The
first chick had been confined to the drum and its tail feathers had been
damaged. These two chicks were allowed to perch on the rim of the drum
from an early age and their tail feathers remained intact. A heater element
and reflector suspended above maintained a temperature of 25*C. By the
time the chicks were four weeks old, the weather was sufficiently warm

for the extra heat to be no longer required.
At one month the chicks started to fly and three days later they were
given the freedom of an aviary during the day. For another week they
were returned to the incubator room each night until they were left
permanently outside. All three Frogmouths now share a large aviary with
10 Bar-shouldered Doves. The doves were nervous for the first few days
but soon learned to accept the young Frogmouths , fearsome appearance.
Unlike the adults, the young Frogmouths are quite happy to sit near the
front of the enclosure during the day and stare at the passing public with
big yellow eyes. Consequently the young Frogmouths make a much better
display than their parents.
To conclude, I would like to thank my partner Don Goodale for
helping to care for the birds, which allowed me some much appreciated
time off. I would also like to thank Keith Wood and Paul Barrett who gave
up their own time to help supply moths for the ever increasing appetites.

A small consignment of these attractive, but admittedly rather
peculiar-looking Buntings was imported unexpectedly into Sweden in the
spring of 1978. I was lucky enough to obtain three cocks and two hens.
Although the birds were immediately released into outdoor aviaries, they
remained in a very poor condition throughout the first year, actually not
moulting until November 1979. One of the younger cock birds suddenly
became ill soon afterwards. Despite treatment he never recovered com-
pletely and died in February 1980. The skin of this particularly fine speci-
men is preserved in Mr. Allan Norell's collection.
In April it became evident that at least one potential breeding pair had
formed. I separated the birds, retaining two fully adult birds in the original
aviary and putting a young pair with a pair of Western Rosellas in another.
The young pair had attained adult plumage only some six months pre-
viously but had not become overweight and looked very fit. The adult
birds, however, remained inactive.
The aviaries in which the Buntings were housed were parrot aviaries
with no vegetation, save for a few tussocks of the Rough Meadow Grass
Poa trivialis. I had arranged some nesting sites on the ground by means of
rocks, hollow logs and turves, but these were ignored completely by the
Buntings.
Despite the small size of the aviary (12 ft.) I could frequently enjoy the
display flight of the young cock bird. It is somewhat reminiscent of that of
the Tree Pipit Anthus trivialis. A different display was performed on the
ground: the cock would pick up a small twig in his beak and with drooping
wings and fanned tail he would run about in irregular circles, now and then
pausing briefly. A cock Black Bunting may also chase his hen at a terrific
speed, exactly as do cock Reed Buntings and Yellowhammers.
Rather unexpectedly, on 17th June, I noticed that the hen Bunting had
started to build a nest in a wicker canary basket, hung on the front wire of
the indoor aviary. Whilst under normal circumstances the hen was indif-
ferent to my presence in the birdroom, now she absolutely refused to visit
the nest until I had left. The cock took no part whatsoever but on a few
occasions he escorted the hen to the nest.
The nest was completed in two days and three eggs were laid on 21st,

22nd and 23rd June. I expected the hen to start incubating any day but it
was not until 27th June that I found her sitting in the nest. On 30th June
two eggs disappeared, presumably taken by a very small weaver-like bird
whose identity has to this day remained a mystery. Despite these failures,
the hen Bunting did not desert and on the morning of 8th July a chick
hatched. It was reared by both its parents and left the nest in the evening
on 19th July.
On 28th July I noticed that the hen had added a few dry rootlets and
some black pony hair to the nest. She laid another three eggs on 30th and
31st July and 1st August respectively. This time she started to sit right
away. On 11th August two chicks hatched, the third egg having again dis-
appeared. On 15th August one of the chicks was found dead, but the
remaining one flourished, leaving the nest in the afternoon of 21st August.
Both of these young Buntings were rather dark in colour and were correctly
sexed as cocks soon after fledging.
After moulting, the two adult pairs were reunited and, apart from some
initial bickering, they settled down well.
In 1981 the pairs were split up and the partners exchanged. I was
pleased to see the old hen coming into breeding condition for the first
time, no doubt being stimulated by her new mate. Both pairs nested in-
doors and at about the same time, the young hen laying on 2nd, 3rd and
4th July, and the old one on 5th, 6th and 7th July.
When checking the young hen's nest on 7th July, one of the eggs was
missing but she successfully hatched the remaining ones on 14th and 15th
July. The old hen incubated equally well and in the morning of 18th July
there were two chicks in her nest - the third egg contained a fully devel-
oped, dead chick.
All of these four young Buntings were reared, fledging on 25th and
30th July respectively. They were fine, strong birds, identical to their
mothers and easily sexed as females.
On 18th August all four were released into my 50 ft. planted flight,
where they obviously felt very much at home. They were rather playful,
sometimes chasing a young hen White-throat Sylvia curruca about the
aviary. The latter somehow had found her way inside and, being impos-
sible to capture, she had to stay for several weeks. I must say I was at
times tempted to keep her, as a more lovely aviary bird would be hard to
find. The young Black Buntings did, however, agree perfectly well with
an adult cock Meadow Pipit Anthus pratensis who had been found with a
damaged wing.
By the way, after a fortnight the Pipit was released, having made a

complete recovery.
I was so pleased with my Black Buntings that I decided to put them all
together despite the fact that the cock birds were still in full breeding
condition. As it turned out, this was a mistake for after two days I found
the younger cock dead, killed by his stronger rival who had made the large
aviary his own territory.
In 1982 the young hen laid in aU four clutches of eggs. However, the
cock, who had suffered a late moult, did not come into condition at
the proper time and consequently the eggs were infertile. The young
Buntings were kept with various conures and were not even provided with
nesting facilities. A young pair had been given to my friend, Mr. Bengt
Nilsson, one of Sweden's most skilful aviculturists.
All of my Black Buntings have moulted well in the autumn of 1982 and
at the time of writing (March 1983) they are in excellent condition.
1 feed my Buntings on a German u de luxe" finch mixture with an
extra dish of Moroccan canary seed. This type of canary seed is quite as
good, if not better, than the more expensive Spanish ones. The Black
Buntings are very fond of millet sprays, preferring the large, soft Chinese
sprays. I feed egg food and a few mealworms every day.
As a rearing food I have used fresh ants' eggs, live locusts (several
species), large moths, mealworms and spiders. A regular supply of calcium
is of great .importance. Small garden snails with soft shells that have not
yet become too sticky are eagerly taken. If suitable snails are unobtain-
able, fresh egg shells can be used. Buntings show a preference for snails,
while Seedeaters Sporophila sp., Redpolls, Linnets and Virginian Cardinals
will feed their chicks soft eggshell if given the choice.

The Black-headed Grosbeak is a bird of the western United States. It is
migratory, wintering in Mexico and the northern parts of South America.
It is regarded as conspecific with the Rose-breasted Grosbeak P. ludo-
vicianus which inhabits the eastern United States and where the ranges of
the two overlap hybrids may be found (Restall, 1975).
In breeding plumage the cock Black-headed Grosbeak has the head
black, the back is brown with darker streaks, the wing and tail feathers
are black with two white wing bars and large white tips to the two outer
pairs of tail feathers. The breast and upper abdomen are a warm biscuit
brown and there is a central stripe of yellow on the breast which fades into
a paler yellow on the lower abdomen. The underwing coverts are yellow.
The bill is horn-coloured and the legs are blue-grey. Out of the breeding
season the black of the head is partially obscured by brown tips to the
feathers. The bird measures 7-8 ins. (177-203 mm).
The hen Black-headed Grosbeak is generally brown, lighter on the
breast and abdomen. There is a white stripe above and below the eye
and the wing bars are duller than in the cock.
A pair of Black-headed Grosbeaks was obtained in the summer of 1980.
They were housed in an aviary measuring 25 x 10 x 8 ft. high which con-
tained a mixed collection of seed-eating birds. This flight has no shelter
attached but the back and sides are solid and half of the roof is covered.
The food available in the aviary consisted of sunflower, white millet and
canary seeds, canary-rearing food, bread and milk, chopped apple and
regular supplies of chickweed.
In the early autumn of 1980 two more Grosbeaks were obtained, both
of which were hens. During the autumn a certain amount of nocturnal
restlessness was recorded, as one would expect with a migratory species.
As there was uncertainty regarding the hardiness of the species it was
decided to winter the birds indoors for the first winter. Soon after caging
the cock became very thin and died. The original hen also died during the
winter. While caged the birds showed a preference for sunflower seed,
hemp and some plain canary seed. Mealworms were readily taken.

The 1981 Season
The two remaining hens were replaced in the flight in April. On 1st
June a cock was obtained. This bird had been successfully wintered out-
side the previous year. After a short quarantine period the bird was placed
with the hens. Within a week of the introduction of the cock, both hens
started to pull at twigs and to carry pieces about the aviary. About nine
days after his release the cock started to sing. The song consisted of a
simple series of rather loud notes and was rather reminiscent of the song
of the Reed Bunting Emberiza schoeniclus . As the season advanced, this
song could be heard frequently at night as well as during the day.
On 14th June one hen started to carry heather twigs in earnest. She
gave the impression of wanting to build at a level above the aviary roof,
especially attempting to fly up into the branches of an elm tree which
overhangs the aviary at one spot. Eventually she began to place a few twigs
together in a clump of heather about three-quarters of the way up the
back of the aviary.
Throughout the following day little progress was made at this site and
later that day the cock began nest-calling at a second site, just below the
aviary roof, on top of a clump of heather and in full view. The nest-call
was a drawn out nasal note, resembling a muted version of the nasal note
in the song of the Greenfinch Carduelis chloris. The hen joined the cock
at this site and uttered a lower pitched version of this same call. The next
day (16th June) some dead twigs of Snowberry Symphoricarpus albus
were provided. These were immediately accepted by the hen and the main
structure of the nest was completed by that afternoon. At this stage the
hen started to collect fine heather twigs and a little hay to line the nest.
The birds were not at all shy and the hen built quite openly, not being in
any way disturbed by my presence only a couple of feet away. By this
time the second hen had ceased any attempt at nest-building although not
persecuted in any way by either of the other birds.
At 6.00 p.m. on 16th June the hen was on the nest, shaping the cup.
She then left the nest and immediately invited mating about 3 ft. from the
nest. The posturing was in the usual passerine way, with the head and tail
slightly elevated and the partly spread wings quivering. The cock responded
by drawing himself up very thin and upright and slowly circled the hen
twice before mating. From the front the bright yellow breast stripe and
shoulder tufts formed by the underwing coverts were very conspicuous at
this time.
The following day the lining of the nest was nearly complete. The nest
reminded me of a larger version of the nest of the Bullfinch Pyrrhula pyr-

rhula although the lining was much sparser. On the morning of 19th June
the hen was sitting on the nest as if laying, but on examining the nest later
no egg was present. The next morning the broken remains of an egg were
found on the aviary floor, having apparently been laid from a perch. This
marked the end of the breeding effort for 1981, with no further interest
being shown by any bird, although the cock continued to sing until the
moult in September. As the cock had wintered out successfully the pre-
vious year in another collection it was decided to leave the birds outside
for the winter.
The 1982 Season
The first sign of breeding activity was on 29th March when the cock
was seen to chase both hens about the aviary. The following day both
hens started to pull at twigs. The cock started to sing in mid-April and
for the first time a sub-song was heard. This was far more tuneful than the
full song and consisted of many warbled notes. On 30th April both hens
began to reply to each song phrase of the cock with a sharp single note.
It was decided to leave the trio together until one hen showed an interest
in nesting and then to remove the second hen, but events turned out
rather differently.
On 10th May the hen that had not nested in 1981 began to carry
twigs about, again initially attempting to carry material into the branches
of the tree overhanging the aviary. Eventually the hen appeared to settle
on a site, again on top of a clump of heather, about 18 ins. below the
aviary roof and completely exposed to view. For the next few days the
hen was occupied in carrying twigs up to this site and then carrying them
away again, thus making no progress whatsoever.
On the morning of 13th May the cock was squatting at the nest site,
singing. Throughout the day the hen continued to carry twigs up to the
nest site and then away again. Occasionally she actually placed a twig on
the heather and attempted to fix it into place but would then pick it up
again and carry it away. Usually one twig would be carried up to the site
three or four times in succession before being discarded for another. At
7.00 p.m. the birds were seen to mate on the aviary floor and later that
evening the cock began to carry twigs up to the site - the only time he
was seen to attempt to build - but these were immediately removed by
the hen.
The following day the hen began to collect nest-lining material in the
form of cocoa-nut fibre. This would be gathered by the beakful and
brought to the nest-site and then away again, as had happened with the

twigs. Two days later, on 16th May, the hen was seen squatting on the
bare heather where the nest should have been, and later that day a
Grosbeak egg was found in a Diamond Dove nest that had been built
about 1 ft. below the Grosbeak nest-site. Apparently the egg had fallen
directly on to the incubating dove, which had tucked it in with its own
two, considerably smaller eggs. The egg was pale blue in colour, with a
sprinkling of brown spots which were especially concentrated at the
blunt end. On examination this egg proved to have been cracked as a
result of the fall.
As a result of this, I decided to place an incomplete Blackbird's nest
at the nest-site. This nest had been abandoned before the mud lining
had been added and so was made up of straw and finer grasses only. The
following morning the hen was wary of this nest and reluctant to approach
so I placed a number of twigs around the rim of the cup, whereupon the
nest was accepted and the hen immediately began to line it with cocoa-
nut fibre. The twigs gradually fell away over the next few days for they
were not securely anchored in place, but by then the nest had been com-
pletely accepted.
On 22nd May the second hen - the one that had built a nest the pre-
vious year - suddenly began to line this nest also. Up to this point, she
had never been seen to carry nesting material and certainly was not res-
ponsible for the destruction of the earlier nest-building attempts. No ag-
gression was shown between any of the birds although the first hen
appeared to be dominant over the second. On 24th May an egg was laid
in the nest by the first hen. The bird appeared to remain on the nest for
most of the day, although when checked in the late afternoon it was the
cock that was sitting. While I was present the first hen flew up and stood
beside the nest, whereupon the cock immediately left and she took his
place. The hen remained on the nest that night. By now, both hens were
consuming considerable amounts of chopped cuttle-fish 'bone'.
The following morning the first hen was sitting on the nest while the
second was squatting beside her on the rim of the nest. Shortly afterwards
there were two eggs in the nest and an egg was balanced on the rim of the
nest; this I placed in the nest. Again the first hen appeared to sit for most
of the day. By this time the cock was tame enough to take mealworms
from the hand, although the hens never became so confiding. That
evening, on receiving a mealworm from me, the cock took it up to the
nest, carrying it lengthways rather than crossways in its beak. The hen
took the mealworm and left the nest with it. The cock was just about to
settle on the eggs when the second hen arrived and immediately jumped on

to the nest, giving the impression that she had been waiting a long time for
an opportunity to incubate. The cock then left the nest area. This was the
only time that the cock was seen to bring food to the incubating hen and
somehow one got the impression that it was not fully intentional. No
vocalisations appeared to be involved.
Early the next morning a great deal of noise was heard from the aviary.
On investigation I found that the second hen had again laid an egg on the
rim of the nest and this had attracted the attention of a Magpie, which was
attempting to take the eggs. Both hens were jumping about near the nest
calling loudly while the cock was suspended from the aviary roof, trying to
attack the Magpie. Had the wire not been there, I am quite sure that he
would have physically attacked the predator. When I arrived the Magpie
flew off, whereupon the birds immediately calmed down. I placed the egg
in the nest and the first hen immediately began to incubate. The nest now
contained five eggs, the first hen also having laid that morning.
Incubation was shared by all three birds although the cock only took a
small part, for while the first hen would not yield to the second, the cock
would leave the nest whenever either hen approached. The eggs were never
left unattended. Usually the relieving bird flew directly to the rim of the
nest and the relieved bird flew straight away.
The first egg hatched on 6th June, indicating that true incubation had
begun with the first egg and giving an incubation period of 13 days. The
chick was light skinned and covered with pale grey down. The gape was
bright red. Mealworms were immediately offered to the birds and were
readily fed to the chick. Apparently the food was taken to the nest in the
crop and not carried in the beak. At first only the contents of the meal-
worm were fed to the young, being squeezed into the mouth as if from a
tube. Throughout that day mealworms were offered to the birds at inter-
vals of approximately one hour. At one feed during the afternoon the two
hens fought seriously for the first time.
The following morning the first chick was very weak and a second egg
had just hatched. As the problem was almost certainly the lack of live-
food early in the morning, I decided to attempt to provide a constant
supply of mealworms by providing them in a glass dish about 1 ft square.
A shallow layer of about Vi in of bran was placed on the bottom of the
dish and the mealworms placed on top of this. The birds showed no hesi-
tation in entering the dish. The following morning, though both chicks
were still alive, the first was very weak and slow to beg, never having
recovered from the first night. A third egg hatched during the morning
while another was found to have dried up, the shell being dented. At

8.30 p.m. both hens were seen to be brooding the young simultaneously.
The next morning the first chick was dead and the last egg had hatched,
leaving three young in the nest. As the birds were feeding the young solely
on mealworms, although feeding normally themselves, I decided to sup-
plement the diet of the chicks by hand-feeding. The young were fed three
or four times daily with pieces of Purina dog food which had been soaked
in water containing Abidec and rolled in SA-37 powder and scraped
cuttlefish "bone". The adults did not appear to object to my interference,
the brooding bird slipping away as I reached the nest and one or the other
returning as soon as I left.
Although all appeared to be going well, on the morning of 12th June
the two smaller chicks were found dead in the nest. It was as a result of
this that I discovered that the adults would not search among the bran for
mealworms, and would only take them if they were readily visible. As I
had been adding one or two handfuls of mealworm culture a day, the
amount of bran in the dish had become too great, allowing the mealworms
to disappear from sight and so the young had starved.
On the evening of 15th June, the eyes of the remaining chick were just
starting to open; it was now eight days old. By 18th June the chick was
well covered in feathers and the adults had ceased to brood during the day.
At this stage the young bird refused hand-feeding, crouching in the nest at
my approach. On this day the cock resumed full song. On 21st June, at
14 days old, the chick was on the rim of the nest at 9.00 a.m.; however, it
returned to the nest after being fed. At 2.00 p.m. it was still in the nest,
but when next checked at 5.30 p.m. it had fledged - a very much paler
edition of the hen with hardly any tail feathers visible.
By 23rd June the cock alone appeared to be feeding the fledgeling. At
6.40 p.m. on that date, the subordinate hen was heard to sing in a way
that was almost indistinguishable from the cock. At 7.30 p.m. loud dis-
tress calls were heard from the aviary and upon investigation I found the
subordinate hen attacking the fledgeling. There was no sign of the first
hen (she was later found hiding in a clump of heather) and although the
cock was very excited he did not attempt to defend the young bird. When
the first hen left the heather, she was immediately attacked by the other
hen. At this stage both hens were removed from the aviary and the birds
given time to calm down. The head of the fledgeling was covered with
blood, especially around the beak, and for the rest of the evening it
would not respond to the attempts of the cock to feed it. When the
'dominant' hen was returned to the aviary after an hour, she was attacked
immediately by the cock, although not as seriously as she had been by the

other hen. This bird was then permanently removed from the aviary. The
following morning the chick was still alive but its head was very swollen.
With a little prompting it accepted food from me and was also fed by the
cock. By 1.30 p.m. however it was lying dead below the perch.
Second Nesting
The same afternoon the 'subordinate' hen was returned to the aviary.
As soon as she was placed in the aviary the cock assumed what was prob-
ably a courtship display - the only time that this was ever witnessed.
Perching about 4 ft. away from the hen the cock slightly raised his tail
and spread it fully, so displaying the white tips to the feathers; after a
couple of seconds the wing tips were dropped and the head was tilted
towards the tail. The whole display was accompanied by a totally differ-
ent type of song than usual which can best be described as being rather
canary-like. The hen appeared to ignore the whole performance.
Two days later, on 26th June, the pair were seen mating and the first
egg of a clutch of three was laid in the old nest on the 29th. No attempt
had been made to repair the nest in any way. Again the incubation was
shared although initially the hen sat for longer periods than the cock.
When the nest was inspected at 8.00 p.m. on 11th July, the first egg had
just hatched and the second was chipping. The following morning there
were two chicks in the nest, the third egg proving infertile. As before the
adults would feed mealworms only and so additional hand-feeding was
carried out. On 15th July the cock, always the tamer of the pair, remained
on the edge of the nest as I fed the young. The following morning both
chicks had the tips of the primary feathers broken through the quills.
On 17th July the hen was heard to sing while collecting food and was
answered with a burst of song from the cock. This became quite a com-
mon occurrence over the next few days. Both parents would now stand
on the edge of the nest as I fed the young. If they were not already present
when I arrived at the nest both would immediately fly up to the nest. The
cock appeared unconcerned while the hen always gave a sharp 'tchick' of
alarm as she arrived, but this did not appear to affect the response of the
young. Hand-feeding now became more difficult as both parents attemp-
ted to prevent the young from receiving food from me, snatching it from
the tweezers and either swallowing it themselves or removing it from the
vicinity of the nest, treating it, in fact, rather as if it were faecal material.
By 18th July the young had their eyes open, at only six days old. At
this stage they were no longer brooded continuously during the day.
Unlike the first chick which had refused further hand-feeding once its eyes

Fledgling Black-headed Grosbeak, the day after leaving the nest, i.e. 10 days old
opened, these continued to feed readily from the hand until they fledged,
possibly due to the presence of the adults on the edge of the nest.
The first chick left the nest on the afternoon of 21st July, at only nine
days old whereas the earlier chick had remained in the nest until 14 days
old. It was returned to the nest that evening as the chick remaining in the
nest was being favoured by the parents. The following day both the young
fledged during the afternoon. It was now noticeable that there was a con-
siderable difference in the colouring of the two young. The first was very
pale on the breast with fine striations on the flanks, the wings were light
coloured and the light central stripe on the head was quite narrow. The
second chick was a much warmer brown on the breast with clear flanks,
the wings were much darker and the central head stripe was much broader.
It was thought that this might represent asexual difference but it does not.
After the young fledged the adults, for the first time, started to feed
them small amounts of canary-rearing food, bread and milk and half-ripe
grass seed. However mealworms continued to form the bulk of the food
supplied. At this stage the young would no longer accept hand-feeding.

On fledging the young were very small, less than half the size of the adults.
They appeared to develop very slowly, in contrast to their rapid growth
to fledging, and were especially slow to feed themselves.
From 3oth July onwards the bulk of the feeding of the fledgelings
was carried out by the hen. On 2nd August one fledgeling was first seen to
pick up food for itself - a mealworm dropped by the hen as she was feed-
ing it. By 15th August the young were spending much time calling to be
fed but were actually fed much less by the hen. On this date the older
fledgeling was first seen to feed itself on canary-rearing food. On 19th
August both young were seen to feed themselves and could be considered
to be self-supporting, although still fed occasionally by the adults.
The adults started to moult in early September and the second hen was
returned to the aviary at this stage. The immature* showed no sign of
moult at this time. On 19th November the duller coloured young was
found dead. No cause of death could be determined but rather to my
surprise the bird turned out to be a cock.
It was not until the end of January 1983 that the remaining young
bird started to moult into the plumage of an adult cock. At the same time
the older cock had begun to lose the brown tips to the head feathers.
Upon completion of the moult the young cock was less brightly coloured
than his father, suggesting that the colour of the plumage may intensify
with age.

By BRYAN PECK (St. Marks, Cheltenham, Glos.)
The year so far has been very mixed for me - two near misses and two
successes. It started with the Coleto or Bald Starling Sarcops culvus from
the Philippine Islands. The Coleto is a black bird with a grey back and
white shoulders which are only seen when the wings open, the head is
bald, the skin bright pink which changes colour going very reddish when
the bird becomes excited. There is a line of feathers running from the beak
to the nape, about 1/8 in wide, giving the impression of two large cheek
patches. The beak and feet are black, the eyes brown, and the sexes alike.
I have two pairs plus a spare hen (all have been surgically sexed). The
older pair is from Luzon. They laid on quite a few occasions during 1981
and 1982 but although some chicks hatched, none lived for more than
four days.
In February 1983 the parents, housed in a 4 ft x 18 in x 18 in cage
supplied with a nestbox 7 in x 7 in x 16 in, with a large entrance hole,
through which they could pass very easily, fed one chick for 26 days when
it was found dead in the nest-box. The box was filled with newspaper,
although other material was offered. The eggs were blue with brown and
mauve blotches, heavy around the large end, size 28 mm x 16 mm (other
eggs, similarly coloured, had measured 22 mm x 18 mm and 24 mm x 14
mm). I cannot be sure of the incubation period, but based on observations
of feeding, it must be within 16 to 24 days.
The chicks hatch completely naked but by two days old they are
covered in grey down. The oldest I have had is 26 days. At this age it was
nearly as large (body size) as the parents, but only partly feathered and
appeared to need about another six days in the nest, but this is only an
assumption. From hatching to about eight days old it looked like a typical
starling, but at about eight days old it could be identified as a Sarcops
chick, the line of feathers over the centre of the head being quite visible.
The chick was fed wholly on live food for the first two weeks, then
other food was fed, i.e. fruit pulp, bread and milk, etc.
The diet offered to the parent birds is mixed diced fruit, bread and
milk, insectivorous soft food and live food, including stick insects.
The cage in which they nested is too small, but Sarcops are not strong
fliers in captivity. This pair is now housed in a 9 ft x 8 ft x 6 ft high flight,
and are now nesting, still using newspaper, but also grass and other plant

fibre.
There are two subspecies, both of which have been imported in recent
years, but most of the birds come from Luzon.
My first success of the year was with the Chinese Bulbul Pycnonotus
sinensis , of which I also have two pairs. The Chinese Bulbul is a grey bird
with a black cap and white nape band: The ear patches are brown, the
throat is white, the flight feathers are edged with yellow; the legs and beak
are black and the eyes brown. As far as sexing is concerned, I have come to
know my birds over a long time and have always found that the cocks have
a darker grey breast band - so far this method of sexing has proved correct.
One partner in each of my pairs was bred by me, one cock in 1975 and
a hen bred in 1978. Both are paired to wild-caught birds, the cock import-
ed in 1973, the hen imported in 1976. Both pairs have reared a number of
young in the past.
1 decided to release the pair whose cock was aviary-bred in 1975 into a
flight containing three pairs of Philippine White-breasted Mannikins Lon-
chura leucogastra. The flight is triangular in shape, being 12 ft x 10 ft x
8 ft and 6Vi ft high. The flight was not planted but had a natural earth
floor. The decision to use this pair was based on past knowledge that they
would use a nest-box, whereas the other pair would not.
I had hung six nest-boxes in various places in this flight. The nest-boxes
were of the type used for British tree creepers by the Royal Society
for the Protection of Birds. I have found this type of box is very successful
for small birds, but instead of using a hole entrance I leave half of one side
open.
The bulbuls built a cup nest within a nest-box using grass, coconut
fibre and moss. The coconut fibre was used for the nest lining. Two eggs
were laid,though only one hatched which I have found is normal for this
pair. The eggs are white, spotted and speckled mauve and brown but the
egg markings are never consistent; some eggs are marked all over, some
only round the larger end. I have found this to be the same with most
other Pycnonotus.
For the first few days the chicks are fed solely on live food, then until
they leave the nest they are fed on the same food as the parents.
The one chick left the nest at 14 days old on 10th July 1983, and was
fed for eight days by the parents. On leaving the nest the chick was grey all
over, except for the throat and breast which were white; the crown was a
darker grey. One month later, the chick had started to moult into adult
plumage.
For the first few weeks the parents were very protective to the chick,

driving the mannikins away. On 15th August the chick and parents were
transferred to a 4 ft x 18 in x 18 in cage and the older pair released into
the flight.
The second success of the year was with Pied Barbets Lybius leucome-
las. The Pied Barbet is a black and white bird dusted with yellow. There is
a red patch on the forehead, which spreads into a yellow eyebrow stripe,
the beak and legs are black, there are two teeth each side of the upper
beak, the eyes are red-brown, there are two toes forward and two back.
I purchased five birds in 1982 which were, I believe, a family group.
One bird died in the winter of 1982/3. They were housed in the middle
of a block of three flights, the individual sections of which were 5 ft from
front to back, 3 ft wide and 6 ft high. Subsequently, as mentioned later, I
removed two of the birds, leaving a pair. In the aviary on the left is housed
a pair of Grosbeak Starlings Sissirostrum duhium and on the right a pair of
Black-collared Barbets Lybius torquatus. No fighting through the wire has
ever occurred, all three pairs seem quite settled but when making this
block of flights, I took the precaution of double wiring the dividing
sections. On the floor of the flight two large logs were leant against each

other. Four nest boxes were hung in the flight, three near the roof and one
nailed to one of the logs on the floor.
The Barbets were wintered out and stood the cold very well. The nest-
boxes were used for roosting all through the winter.
Around 10th June one of the Barbets started to chip a hole in the
side of one of the logs, near the top. These logs are about 3 l A ft high with
a diameter of 10 in; the hole was about 6 in from the top, IV 2 in diameter
and pushed inward to about 4 in then downwards. From the way the
Barbets enter and leave, I would think that the nest cavity is about 12 in
down from the hole.
An egg appeared in the water dish; it was pinkish white with no mark-
ings and was broken.
From this date one of the Barbets was missing most of the day. The
remaining bird of the pair started to attack the other two birds so I
removed them, leaving what I thought was the pair and this proved right.
I must have spent three hours a day just watching and listening and had
come to the conclusion that one bird was hiding in the nest. On 10th July
I noticed the hen Barbet taking food into the log and as she entered, I
moved closer to listen but could hear nothing even though the nest hole
was about 18 in from the wire. She continued to take in food until
28th July but by this time I had given up hope.
I have to walk past this block of flights to get to my humming bird
shed and I had got quite used to one of the Barbets sticking its head out
of the hole, but as I walked past at 12.45 p.m. on 28th July I stopped in
midstride as the bird looking out of the log had no red forecrown. It
quickly put its head back in but that same evening, as I walked past, an-
other head was sticking out of the hole. This one did not pop back but
looked directly at me, not shy at all. This time I noticed that as well as
lacking the red forecrown, it also had no teeth on the side of the beak.
The next morning (29th July) two chicks were hopping round the
flight. They were completely feathered and the same as the parents, except
where mentioned. They did not return to the log that evening but roosted
in one of the nest-boxes with the bird I had assumed to be the cock. The
next day both parents were seen to feed the chicks. Strangely the chicks
do not call for food and when being fed make no sound at all. The chicks
were removed to a cage 15 days after leaving the nest, and by this time
they were feeding themselves; in fact, they were self-feeding by six days
after leaving the nest. They were removed because the hen had gone back
to staying in the nest and the cock was becoming very aggressive. One
month after leaving the nest the red forecrown is just starting to appear

and the teeth have started to take shape. I am now (beginning of Sept-
ember) waiting hopefully for the next chicks to appear.
The second failure was with Grosbeak Starlings Scissirostrum dubium ,
from the Celebes (Sulawesi). This is a dark grey bird, the grey having a
wine tinge to it. The tail and wings are black; the rump is streaked with
red and orange; the feet and beak are yellow; the beak is large, more like
an Oxpecker; the eyes are brown; where the chin feathers meet the lower
bill, it has a heart shape that is quite distinctive.
I have three pairs of Grosbeak Starlings: two pairs are housed together
in an inside flight measuring 8 ft x 2 ft and are nesting, but these notes
concern the pair housed in the outside flight next to the Pied Barbets.
I released them into the flight in May. I must admit I did not have the
nerve to winter them out. The flight had three nest-boxes hung near the
roof: the first box measured 5 in x 5 in x 10 in, with a 2 in diameter hole,
and hung at a 20* angle; the second box measured 9 in x 9 in x 3 in, with
a 2 in diameter hole and hung level; the third box measured 4 Vi in x 4 Vi in
x 8 in with a 1 3 A in diameter hole on the side.
All three boxes were used for roosting, but for nesting they settled for
the first box and soon started taking nesting material in such as coconut
fibre, dried grass and moss, and after taking quite a bit of material into this
box, both birds took up residence. On 24th July I found half an eggshell
on the floor of the flight. On 25th I found three more pieces which I
retrieved for a friend who collects eggshells. The four pieces made up two
complete eggshells; their colour was very light blue, speckled round the
large end with fawn and brown.
Both parents took mealworms and other food to the nest but on 9th
and 10th August the chicks were found dead on the floor. They were
about 4 in long, well-formed, completely naked, and looked more like
young thrushes than young starlings. I was very disappointed, more so
than with the Coleto Starlings, but the pair have now taken to the third
box so I am still hoping.
The food supplied to all four species, with slight variations, consists
of apple, tomato, boiled carrot, grapes and cabbage - all diced and dusted
with SA37 - brown bread and boiled milk with a little sugar. In hot
weather this is replaced with bread and nectar. Orlux Soft Food is also
given, as well as mealworms and the Coletos and Grosbeak Starlings are
also given stick insects. Fresh drinking and bathing water is given daily.
All the flights have feeding doors and covered food trays so that I
do not have to enter to feed the birds and all nest-boxes are sealed for
privacy.

Breeding of the Dalmatian Pelican at the Park of Villars-les-Dombes
in 1981 has been reported earlier (Cordonnier 1981).
The six adults, bought in 1969 and 1971, are pinioned and kept on a
pond measuring half a hectare and they nest on a small central island,
about 25 m. square, which is covered with shrubs providing abundant nest-
ing material (rushes, small twigs).
In 1982 three nests (Nos. 1, 2 and 3) were built. Here follows a short
report of the breeding chronology (the observational visits had to be
scattered):

normally and was reared
successfully, like the two
previous ones.
Makatsch (1974) reports only one yearly brood in the Dalmatian Peli-
can, as do Crivelli and Vizi (1981) who only mention replacement clutches
following egg destruction. Harrison (1975) also reports that no second
brood has been observed.
There are no data about successful breeding in captivity (Kramer,
1980).

In this case, it is noticeable that the first clutch was early (10th January),
and this was perhaps due to the very mild winter weather that prevailed in
southern France (in the previous years the first eggs were laid on 6th June,
1979, 15th February, 1980, and 17th March, 1981).

GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT IN A HAND-REARED
STRIPED OWL Rhinoptynx climator
By JEFFREY SPICKNALL and CHARLES PICKETT
(National Zoological Park, Washington, DC, USA)
The National Zoological Park began efforts in 1976 to establish the
Striped Owl Rhinoptynx climator in captivity, at which time a single male
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.9878899" page_id="56319785"  page_num="153" year="" vol="">
was acquired. Two females were added in 1977 and an additional male in
1980. This latest male paired with a female and they produced four fertile
eggs in 1981, of which two hatched. The nesting behaviour of this species
was described by Goodman and Fisk {AviculturalMagazine , 79: 158-162)
and an account of its breeding was given by R. Krahe {Avicultural Maga-
zine , 87: 242-248). The following information is presented to further
document growth and development.
Housing and diet
The birds are housed in an indoor exhibit measuring 5 ft. x 8 ft. x
10 ft. with sand-covered floor. Grass clumps are added as decoration and

perching is available. The birds do not seem to consume water, but do
take frequent baths when water is available.
Nesting
The nest scrape is located on the ground behind a stump placed in the
rear corner of the exhibit for security. The female performed all of the
incubation duties when the eggs were left in the nest. Of six eggs produced
during 1981, four were fertile and two hatched. The. first chick hatched
after natural incubation and was left with the parents for rearing. It was
found decapitated at six days old, so the second chick was hatched by
artificial as well as natural incubation, and was subsequently hand-reared.
Incubation
The egg hatched artificially was taken from the nest after it had been
incubated for thirty days by the female. It was placed in a "Roll-X" incu-
bator at a dry bulb temperature of 99.5*F and wet bulb temperature of
87*F, and hatched on 28th November 1981 after 33 days' incubation. The
dry temperature reading was decreased to 88*F gradually over the next
two weeks, at which time the bird was moved to a rearing unit equipped

with a heat lamp. By moving closer to, or further from, the heat source,
the chick regulated its* own temperature from this time until grown.
Feeding
The chick hatched on the afternoon of 28th November and feeding
began the following morning. Zu/Preem Bird-of-Prey Diet was fed on the
first day; chicken breast supplemented with Vionate and calcium powder
was fed from the second to the ninth day, at which time pieces of newborn
mice were added.
The chicken was dropped from the diet and newborn mice used exclu-
sively from the twenty-fourth day. Whole mice, with the stomach slit
open to expose the internal organs, were introduced at 38 days and be-
came the sole diet*at 46 days.
At no time was there a problem in getting the bird to eat. A pair of
forceps was used initially to feed small bits of chicken and young mice.
When the food was brushed or nudged against the side of the beak, the
chick would gape for food. For the first few days, it needed occasional
help in opening its mouth wide enough to allow food passage, but had no
difficulty in swallowing it once it was inside. The chick was fed every two
hours for the first month, from 7.00 a.m. until 4.30 p.m. Food was given
every three hours from this time until the chick was 38 days old, when it
began to eat on its own.
Growth
The chick was weighed prior to the first feeding each morning for the
first month and a half, and again at four and twelve months of age. As it
was flying freely at the end of a month and a half, daily weighing was dis-
continued to prevent stress. Weight gains are presented in the following
table.

Serinus citrinipectus
By NEVILLE BRICKELL (Natal Avicultural Society, S. Africa)
The Lemon-breasted Canary is probably the last full species new to
science that will be recorded for south-eastern Africa. The initial discovery
of the species must be credited to Mr. Jack Scheepers, a member of the
Natal Avicultural Society, who in 1959 trapped about 40 examples of this
unknown canary. The new species was made known to science in Septem-
ber 1960 when specimens were collected near Panda in Mozambique by
Dr. P.A. Clancey and Mr. Walter J. Lawson of the Durban Museum, South
Africa. In 1970 Mr. Lawson described the unsuccessful nesting of a pair
of Lemon-breasted Canaries in one of his aviaries in 1969.
The Lemon-breasted Canary is allied to the Yellow-eye Canary Serinus
mozambicus and the Black-throated Canary S. atrogularis. The male
resembles the former, but has the face more boldly patterned; cheek patch
yellowish; chin white; throat and breast bright lemon yellow; lower breast
and abdomen pale yellow; flanks buff, streaked with grey; eye dark brown;
bill dark horn, the lower mandible paler; legs and feet light brown. The
female differs from S. atrogularis in having the cheek patch grey; chin,
throat and flanks buff. Since its original discovery in Mozambique, it has
now been found to occur in eastern Zimbabwe and southern Malawi. Its
northernmost limits are unknown. In South Africa it extends as far south
as Stanger in the province of Natal, and possibly occurs in the lowlands of
the eastern Transvaal. Its habitat is savanna woodland and semi-rural cul-
tivation where it occurs in small compact flocks often in the company of
Yellow-eye Canaries. I have not heard the song of the male, which is repor-
ted to be a "pretty little song", but a female had a sweet twittering call
when a male alighted on the same branch. Little is known of its feeding
habits in the wild except that it has been observed eating seeds and weeds
of low-growing herbs.
In the aviary it takes readily to a finch mixture and insects in the form
of mound termites Trinervitermes sp. Breeding in its natural state is un-
known. In captivity, it constructs a cup-shaped nest of grass and then lines
it with feathers. Eggs number three to four and they are white with a few
irregular brown spots and fine streaks. The female only incubates for a
period of 12-14 days; the nestling period is 14-16 days.

By D. PHILIP KING (Assiniboine Park Zoo, Winnipeg, Canada)
The Assiniboine Park Zoo in Winnipeg is one of Canada's major zoos,
and must surely rank amongst those with not only the coldest winter tem-
perature but with the greatest range between summer and winter weather.
Consequently efforts have been made since development of the Zoo began
to concentrate on exhibiting animals that can survive our winters with a
minimum amount of protection. While many (though not all) North
American species are obviously well-suited, a surprising number of non-
native or exotic animals fall into this category.
When thinking of the tougher or more resilient animals thus deemed
suitable, it seems that mammals come more obviously to mind. To main-
tain some semblance of balance at least for winter exhibition though, a
reasonable number of bird species similarly resilient is very desirable. To
survive outside in temperatures which, during a normal winter, average
-16*C and can on occasion dip down to -40*C, requires a special sort of
resilience on the part of the birds (not to mention those who care for
them). When those birds are non-native the problems and their imagined
or anticipated after-effects often seem enormous.
In Winnipeg we have been quite fortunate in our choice of birds for
such outside displays. In addition to various pheasants, grouse, native

raptors, owls and corvids, we have, for the past few years, displayed Barn
Owls Tyto alba pratincola , Eagle Owls Bubo bubo , Tawny Owls Strix
aluco sylvatica, Ural Owls Strix uralensis , Hooded Crows Corvus corone
cornix and Jackdaws Corvus monedula spermologus. These species, whilst
attractive to those who appreciate them present a rather uninspiring and
somewhat bland appearance to the general public. Consequently it was
felt that something a little more colourful and visible was needed, but
that could be accommodated in our limited facilities. As a result six
Derbyan Parakeets Psittacula derbyana , whose natural range includes the
Himalayan Mountains in western China and north-eastern India, were
acquired. After a brief settling-in period (which also allowed us to parrot-
proof their intended premises), they were moved to a range of exhibits
known for obvious reasons as "The Pheasantry". A description follows
of their aviary, one of a number of similar-sized structures in this complex.
The outside aviary is rectangular in shape 24 ft. long, 12 ft. wide and
10 ft. high, with a slightly arched roof. Attached to the rear of this aviary
which, like all the others in this complex, is visible by the public from the
front only, is an insulated wooden shelter building measuring 8 ft. long,
5 ft. wide and between 6 and 7 ft. high, this latter variation because of a
rear-sloping roof. Inside, and not visible to the public, is a cage 4 ft. long,
3 ft high and 3 ft. wide, constructed of 1 in. square weldmesh wire and so
arranged that the birds, when entering the building, have access only to
this cage. This measure was considered more efficient than protecting the
inside of the whole shelter. Access to this cage from the aviary is through
an 8 in. by 10 in. hole.
The parakeets were fed a standard diet of sunflower seeds, raw peanuts
in the shell, whole wheat bread, Purina monkey chow, rolled oats, wheat
and turkey pellets by way of dry food, and small amounts of fruit and
vegetables. In addition, fresh branches were provided regularly for them
to chew up, and doubtless some amount of the bark was ingested. The
sunflower seeds and peanuts were the most preferred items and the fruits
and vegetables the least. While part of this lack of preference may be due
to the sometime freezing of these items, preferences were not seen to
change when temperatures rose above the level at which this would take
place. The food and water dishes were placed inside as a protection against
the elements and as a routine method of reinforcing familiarisation with
the inner cage as a place of shelter.
The winter of 1981-1982 proved to be very long and very severe in
terms of cold. According to our weather office it provided the second
longest continuous stretch of below -30*C temperatures on record, a

period of 30 days (the longest was 43 days). To give a few details, the
coldest temperature recorded was -38.9*C, the average temperatures for
the months of December 1981, January and February 1982 were
-12.9*C, -25.2*C and -14.5*C respectively. The winter as a whole was the
third coldest since 1900, the eighth coldest since records were begun in
1872 and the third windiest since 1921. In addition, on one day the com-
bination of wind and temperature produced a wind-chill equivalent of
-89*C, probably a record.
This then was the environment which our parakeets had to withstand,
although the impending severity was not predicted on their release in
October 1981. A night light was installed to encourage the birds to roost
inside, but other than to eat, they were seen to spend little time in the
building. As winter progressed a 250-watt infra-red heat lamp was in-
stalled, out of reach of the birds, to supplement the existing heat supply
and this provided a comparatively warm retreat enabling the building
temperature to rise to -1*C with an outside temperature of -24*C, to +3*C
when it was -20*C outside, and -6*C with the outside being -30*C, to
give a few examples. Still the birds were not seen to frequent the building
unduly and, according to our night watchman, they were outside whenever
he walked past. This observation was borne out by the fact that no drop-
pings were found inside the shelter, other than a few random ones distribu-
ted while feeding and so on.
A flaw in the original aviary design became much more apparent
during the severe weather as a wire cable support for the slightly arched
roof provided the highest available perching opportunity. This cable, while
previously covered in wood to protect the feet of birds perching on it from
frostbite due to the conduction of the metal, was quickly exposed by the
parakeets. After this initial exposure, the cable was covered with split
rubberised hosepipe for ease of installation, and constant replacement of
this proved necessary throughout the winter. As the birds did not perch on
the aviary wire, such protection was not needed on the rest of the frame-
work.
During that winter we had one loss, and ironically the bird was found
inside the building, the temperature of which was above freezing. Ex-
ternally it appeared in excellent condition and was well-fleshed; a post
mortem examination revealed that the bird had a cardiac embolism.
As a result of our experience in keeping these birds outside in such
inclement conditions, especially bearing in mind the record-setting nature
of their first winter, I feel that we can claim success in this experiment. I
should perhaps add that although I have used the word "survive" in this

article, I do not mean to imply that the birds barely existed. From our
observations we have no reason to suppose that they were any the less
comfortable than if we had moved them to a warm building for the
winter, although, it is true to say that they were exposed to more risk in a
climatic sense. Nor should it be thought that our birds were subject to
such extreme temperatures all the time - our summer temperatures fre-
quently reach 30*C and more.
Of course, complete success cannot be said to have been achieved
until the complete cycle of breeding has been undergone, but it would,
I am sure, be of interest if readers could offer further examples of birds
being kept successfully in captivity in climates which differ greatly from
those which they would experience in the wild state, and the methods or
adaptations involved in such management.

Cyanopica cyana
By COLIN J.O. HARRISON (Harrow, Middx.)
For several years in the nineteen-seventies I kept a solitary male Azure-
winged Magpie Cyanopica cyana that had been hand-reared alone and be-
come fixated on humans. It enabled me to learn about many aspects of its
habits; always allowing for the fact that some birds, and corvids in particu-
lar, may learn to vary some aspects of their behaviour in captivity. How-
ever, I could set against this the fact that if a bird treats you as a compan-
ion you may learn more of its behaviour than by observing it where it may
be conscious of you as a potential predator. It was only recently that I
realised how little had been recorded concerning the behaviour of this
species, apart from Derek Goodwin's (1976) observations on other captive
individuals. The following notes may help to give a fuller picture of a bird
that can be rather elusive in the wild.
It is a small magpie, about 34 cm (13 Vi ins.) long. The body colour is
light buffish-brown, with a greyish wash above and pinkish tint on the
breast. The throat is white and a glossy black cap tapers back on to the
nape and extends down on to the ear-coverts. Wings and tail are light blue.

General behaviour
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990469526315789" page_id="56319796"  page_num="164" year="" vol="">
The bird was found by Robin Restall as a nestling offered for sale in a
Madrid market. He sent it to Frank Meaden who continued to rear it, and
who gave it to me when its feathers were only partly grown and its black
cap obscured by pale buff feather tips. At this stage it had begun to feed
itself, but would still beg for food with high-pitched,long-drawn squeaky
notes and slight wing-fluttering. I kept it in a garden aviary about 15 ft.
long, with a shelter shed attached.
As it grew it began to use what were presumably innate calls, or calls it
would not have heard since it was a tiny nestling. The typical zhreeeh call,
long and hoarse with a rising inflection, was used when the bird was flying
backwards and forwards, and more particularly when a person was in sight.
It was sometimes shortened to a brief rising zhreeah when a person was
nearby. When the bird was carrying out less vigorous activities, alone or in
the presence of someone that it knew, it used a frequent subdued, low-
pitched kaah note. A stronger Krraah version of the latter was used on
occasions of annoyance or frustration, sometimes approaching a rattling
churr.
Movement on the ground and in branches was by rapid hopping. Some-
times when on the ground and in a sudden hurry it might do a half-gallop,
a series of large hops with the feet striking the ground successively instead
of simultaneously. It could rapidly ascend a rough vertical surface in a
series of hops aided by quick fluttering wing movements; using this tech-
nique to reach my shoulder when starting on the ground in front of me.
It could cling sideways-on to a vertical rough surface while examining
crevices or concealing something. It could also fly up and by a quick twist
hang back-downwards from the underside of the aviary roof or other
horizontal structure to examine it.
Flight was level, with rapid wingbeats. Descending it tended to use long
swoops. It showed great agility in confined spaces, able to dodge and turn
with the help of the long tail, and would pursue flying insects such as
moths in the air or through branches.
Feeding
I fed it on a variety of food, using maggots and some mealworms, grat-
ed cheese, and fruit cake as staple diet. When maggots or mealworms were
put out, it would take one after another until it had filled its mouth, pouch-
ing them in the throat. It would then regurgitate them, sticky and slimy
with saliva, and push them into crannies and crevices, usually at some
height above the ground. Sometimes it would regurgitate them and lay

in a row before doing this. If I were present it would offer one to me
with small squeaky calls, and at other times, when it had none, it might
go and recover a hidden one to give to me.
Pieces of cheese might also be hidden, but cake or similar material was
not concealed in this way. Items were not kept for long periods, and might
be moved around several times after being hidden. It showed little response
to nuts or acorns, although it is said to store the latter in the wild. Given
acorns it sometimes showed momentary interest, carrying single ones
around and tucking them into some long grass in. a corner of the aviary,
but appeared to show no further interest and left others lying around. Nor
did it show interest in hiding sunflower seeds; unlike a young Jay that 1
kept at an earlier period, that almost relined an old chair in the greenhouse
by stuffing innumerable seeds into a crevice provided by a tear at one
corner, of the seat cover.
On one occasion I saw it make a hole with the bill in a patch of muddy
moss on the ground, put a food item into it, and cover it with a leaf; but
this was atypical. It would hold larger pieces of food down on the perch
with one or both feet while pecking them apart.
As an adult it experienced what were presumably impulses to feed
young for a period during the early summer. When I first noticed this the
Magpie had been feeding on fruit cake placed in a dish on the floor of the
open aviary. The sight of the feeding bird attracted about a dozen hopeful
House Sparrows. The Magpie picked up a piece of cake and suddenly
pushed it towards a sparrow that had been clinging to the wire netting and
that promptly fell off in surprise.
Subsequently I watched the Magpie busily pushing cake through the
wire to a resident party of sparrows that had learned to join the feeding
session; and for about two months the cake consumption was incredible.
On one occasion a single sparrow appeared and flew up on to the wire
when the Magpie had no food to hand. After a moment's searching the
latter approached the sparrow and offered it something that it took
eagerly, but hurriedly dropped, and flew away. When I investigated I
found a small sticky black slug.
Alarm behaviour
I do not think the Magpie would have had any opportunity to learn
appropriate alarms, but some seemed innate.
It has a loud rapid repetitive kree-kree-kree-kree... call, high-pitched
and something between the shrieking alarm of a Blackbird Turdus merula
and the laughing call of a Green Woodpecker Picus viridis. It was usually

accompanied by an alert posture and some rapid flying to and fro. It was
elicited by the sight of a hawk-sized bird approaching rapidly at fairly low
level and was obviously a hawk alarm. However, it might also be given in
response to an approaching Woodpigeon or Black-headed Gull. It was also
used in moments of excitement and, in its warning context, appeared to be
a signal to be on guard rather than an indication of real fear. It would also
be used at times when the bird was suddenly startled. It occurred at its
most hysterical pitch when a Kestrel swooped into the garden and carried
off a sparrow, and for some time after,the daily passage of the Kestrel was
announced by very emphatic alarm calls.
The call bore some similarity in tone to the shrieks of small children
running and playing in nearby gardens, and the Magpie would reply to
these by flying up and down its flight and giving its own shrieking call,
but again in excitement rather than alarm. I noticed that, over a two-year
period, the bird's calls on these occasions increasingly began to resemble
more closely those of the children, and varied from its typical call.
It had a second call for a different type of avian predator. It might
squat on a perch with head low on its shoulder, hardly moving but gazing
upwards and uttering a soft low-pitched kah. By going close to the aviary
and peering up I could usually see the cause. It might be a soaring Buzzard;
more often a Lanner Falcon used by a local falconer, usually waiting-on so
high overhead that I could scarcely separate it from flocks of high-flying
Swifts. This soaring-raptor alarm was used on several occasions for what
turned out to be large dead leaves or scraps of burnt paper from bonfires,
carried high into the air and descending slowly in a wide spiral, giving no
clear indication of their size. A Hobby that spent an hour or so gliding
and circling over the garden on one occasion produced a mixture of the
two calls and reactions.
The Magpie appeared to have no immediate inbuilt alarm reaction for
mammalian predators. It made no immediate response to early encounters
with my cat, an elderly neutered female tabby, with white on chest and
paws. The bird appeared to take its cue from me as parent/mate. Since I
did not react with alarm to the cat neither did the bird, although the avian
predator calls occurred irrespective of my reactions.
The cat would run up the side of the aviary and across the top, while
the Magpie sat on a perch and watched it casually. However, if other cats in
the neighbourhood tried to reach the bird, or alarmed it at night when it
tended to roost on an outside perch, they elicited a harsh krraaah of
annoyance, together with some effort at avoidance. In reacting to a dis-
tant cat the bird discriminated between mine and others that were tabby,

with or without similar white markings. One was so similar that it occa-
sionally fooled me, but the bird appeared to recognise the difference
immediately. After a while my cat, a rather aggressive and territorially-
minded beast, would recognise the call used by the Magpie that probably
indicated that another cat was in view, and if in the house would run out
and look around for an interloper to drive away.
The Magpie appeared genuinely frightened when I carried long sticks
or large unfamiliar objects, even if I picked them up while in its presence.
It would tend to retreat and hide. When I repaired the flight with some
long pieces of wood it hurriedly retreated in silence to the shelter shed,
and appeared to look around for somewhere to hide. It finally perched
in full view at a spot where it could put its head behind a small wooden
projection and could not, therefore, see what was happening. It stayed
motionless on that perch until I had finished the work; a perfect example
of the behaviour attributed to the legendary Ostrich.

Social behaviour

<bodyText confidence="0.999865130434782" page_id="56319799"  page_num="167" year="" vol="">
When it first arrived the bird would solicit feeding, and appeared to
respond sociably to anyone with slight wing-quivering and drooping, and
high-pitched wee or quee 'calls. If a finger was pointed towards its head
it would erect the head feathers in a bristling mass and lower or tilt its
head to be preened and scratched. At this age the neck was almost bare
and this bare, scrawny, pink neck and bristling buff-tipped head feathers
gave it an odd look. These buff-tipped head feathers were prominent in
such a posture, perhaps partly a signal indicating age; and I was interested
to see, in this individual at least, that the ear-coverts were the last to lose
the colour, so that adolescence was indicated by a black crown and buffish
ear-coverts.
The set of the head feathers indicated social mood. Black head feathers
relaxed or slightly fluffed indicated a friendly reaction; and bristled for
preening indicated friendly submission. Sleeked down, they warned of an
aggressive response. There was sometimes an interesting intermediate
reaction, possibly in conflict, when the black feathers of the ear-coverts
were raised and ruffled, but those of the crown were flattened down.
Throughout the whole period that I kept it, possibly because I was the
food provider and possessor, I was always treated as a dominant individual.
An extended finger always produced the allopreening response. As I
preened and ruffled its feathers it would go into a rigid posture with
plumage rather sleeked, making it appear thin. It squatted upright, the
lower leg-joint level with the perch. All the black head feathers were

raised in a bristly ma&amp;apos;Ss, the neck extended and slightly arched, the head
drooped forwards a little and the bill pointing downwards.
The eyes were wide open but the bird appeared to go into a kind of
trance. I tested this by scratching and at the same time holding a meal-
worm in my other hand, and offering it just in front of the bird's head and
moving it around. Normally the response to a mealworm would be an
immediate snatch; but while being preened the bird appeared not to notice
the offering until the session stopped; then as it relaxed it would
suddenly notice and seize the mealworm. Allopreening on the head was
preferred; it was tolerated on neck and mantle, but if wings, breast or
other parts of the plumage were similarly treated the bird appeared to
lose interest.
The fact that when preening the bird I could place an open hand over
the back and slip a finger on either side of the neck made it a useful way
to catch it up. I found that catching it, and occasionally boxing it up,
aroused annoyance at the time but no evidence of long-term resentment
or recollection.
As an adult its interactions were accompanied by soft, slightly plain-
tive whistling notes with a rising inflection, small piping quee or quee-u
notes and occasionally mewing calls, rising to a wee-ow in excitement.
With my wife the bird's reactions were more ambivalent. When young
it solicited feeding and preening, but as an adult it would respond to
preening invitations with occasional reluctance, or switch to a slight peck
halfway through. Increasingly it began to respond with a hunched aggres-
sion posture, more obviously when the wire of the aviary was between
them.
The bird crouched with head lowered and the feathers sleeked, making
it appear broad-headed. The body feathers were fluffed, those of the
mantle being fluffed up in a hump behind the lowered head. The wings
were drooped and partly spread, and the tail spread. In this posture it
made short, jabbing pecks, sometimes accompanied by a short harsh note.
To other visitors the bird responded only in this aggressive fashion. Since
the species appears to live in social groups of pairs in the wild, I suspect
that there may be some social hierarchy of dominance within the group.
Mercifully I only saw direct aggression once. A friend who had kept a
less tame pair of these birds visited me and entered the aviary with me.
My Magpie came to join us, flew on to my friend's shoulder, drew itself
up with very sleeked plumage and then jabbed at an eye, succeeding in
striking it but luckily missing the pupil. There appeared to be no inhibi-
tions involved.

Displays
Derek Goodwin (1976) has described a lateral display from a bird in a
zoo, similar to that which he recorded for the common Magpie. The Azure-
winged Magpie partly spread the tail and tilted the body sideways towards
him, displaying itself broadside but showing both wings and slightly lifting
and fluttering the folded wings, using a soft high-pitched wee-we-wee-u
call. He saw a similar display by the same individual to a female. I have not
seen this posture, but this may be merely a lapse of observation or may
reflect differences of interaction with the birds concerned.
My Magpie once or twice displayed to me on a perch in a lateral pos-
ture, in which it stood up tall with head raised and tail a little lifted, and
the body feathers slightly puffed up so that the bird looked larger than
usual. It hopped with slow deliberation to another perch, slightly ducking
the head and then, sideways-on, it raised the head and turned it away from
me, at the same time swinging the tail away laterally. The movement gave
an impression of the body being slightly thrust towards me laterally. It was
accompanied by whistling and mewing in an excited fashion.The movement
was repeated, turning first to one side then the other, several times.
In moments of excitement during interaction with individual people
whom it knew and who responded to the high-pitched squeaky calls that it
used during feeding, it would occasionally show rising excitement. It in-
creased the rate of calls, then, with wings slightly drooped and spread, tail
half-spread, and neck arched, it lowered its head until the bill pointed
down, the calls at the same time accelerating into a long shivering trill
during which head and bill were lowered with a pronounced shuddering
movement. A similar type of trill was uttered during copulation, which it
performed at times in early summer when perched on a hand, and on one
occasion in response to the sleeve of a dress that was glossy and of a simi-
lar blue to its wings and tail, and which seemed to provide a special stimu-
lus.
On no occasion did I see it carry nest material or attempt any obvious
building movements.

TOOI^USING AND RELATED BEHAVIOUR IN BIRDS:
YET MORE NOTES

Since the publication of my last paper (Boswall, 1983) further observa-
tions have come to light. This is the fourth paper in the series (Boswall,
1977, 1978, 1983).
Borderline cases in wild and captive birds
As regards species of birds dropping hard-shelled objects to break them
open, a further record of Golden Eagles Aquila chrysaetos dropping tor-
toises, this time in Israel, is given by Leshem (1979). As long ago as 1905
Reiser (p. 367) reported that tortoises were dropped in Greece by Golden
Eagles and were an important part of their diet (p. 369). Varshavsky (1968)
confirms both these points for eagles in the Ust Urt desert of Turkmeniya
in the USSR. Leshem (pers. comm., September 1982) has also observed an
Egyptian Vulture Neophron percnopterus dropping a tortoise; this is a first
record. So too is the same author&amp;apos;s note (Leshem, in preparation) of an
Osprey Pandion haliaetus dropping conch shells in Israel.
Two detailed studies of food-dropping behaviour are those of Beck (in
press) on the Herring Gull Lams argentatus and of Zach (1979) on the
Northwestern Crow Corvus caurinus.
Yet another case of baiting by a Green Heron Butorides virescens has
been reported from the southern USA. This time the bird fished with May-
flies. Keenan (1981) writes: "At 1815 EDT on 16 August 1975 at Lake
Murray near Chapin, South,Carolina, I saw a Green Heron standing on a
rock at the edge of the water about 120 feet from where I stood. Behind
the heron and 2 yards back from the water, a swarm of mayflies was
circling. While I watched through binoculars, the bird walked to the
insects, caught one, and, holding it crosswise in its beak, returned to the
water where it dropped the mayfly in the shallows. A small fish rose to the
fly and was caught by the heron. Four of us watched as the bird repeated
the process. After catching a third mayfly, the bird went to a different
perch by the water and was hidden from our view by a large boulder. The
heron flew away a few moments later." Mr. Keenan tells me in a letter
that the bird was a young Green Heron.

Another individual of this species, watched in Africa, in Upper Volta
on 10th May 1981, dropped a flower on the water surface in a way and in
circumstances that left the observers unanimous in the view that the bird
was attempting to lure fish with dummy bait (Walsh and others, in prepa-
ration). On 26th and 27th January 1983 in the Niger Republic a Green
Heron was seen to lure and successfully capture a fish with an object
(possibly a beetle) placed on the water {op. cit .).
In Western Australia a Black Kite Milvus migrans (Roberts, 1982) was
seen to pick up a piece of bread from the bank of a river, drop it into the
water and then fly to a perch from which it then dived - unsuccessfully -
upon fish that had been attracted. The whole performance was twice
repeated but still without success. The bird did catch a crayfish (a chera-
bin) but one which rose to the surface well away from the floating bread.
Although the use of the bait was not demonstrated, in that the bird was
not seen to catch a baited fish, there can be little doubt about the purpose
of the behaviour.
Douthwaite (pers. comm., August 1979), who has studied Pied King-
fishers Ceryle rudis in Africa, reacted to the record of the bird reported
earlier that baited fish with bread (Boswall, 1983) as follows: "The behav-
iour of the Hunter's Lodge Pied Kingfisher is the functional development
of behaviour which, until now, I had assumed was play. I have frequently
seen kingfishers - usually juveniles - pick up twigs, leaves or dead fish from
the surface of the water, toy with them in the air or at a perch and then
drop them again. Sometimes they have immediately dived after the object
and repeated the process, but on other occasions they gazed down intently
for some time before losing interest. I sometimes felt the length and inten-
sity of that gaze, at an object deliberately dropped, was somewhat over-
done, but if fish were attracted to the object then it is understandable.
However, I never saw a kingfisher dive in after dropping an inanimate
object and come up with a live fish."
To the list of birds that use anvils upon which to break hard-shelled
prey must be added pittas of the species Pitta versicolor the Buff-breasted
Pitta (Hindewood, 1966), P. erythrogaster the Red-bellied (Blue-breasted)
Pitta (McDonald, 1974), P. guajana the Banded Pitta (Chasen, 1939), and
P. moluccensis the Lesser Blue-winged Pitta, and P. sordida the Green-
breasted Pitta (Robinson, 1927). In Madagascar the now extinct Delande's
Coua Coua delandei was known to smash snails on anvils. Its name in the
local language, Malagasy, is "Famakiakova" which means "snail axer"!
(Milne-Edwards, 1879). Richards (1977) implies that he saw snail bashing
by the Redwing Turdus iliacus and confirmed to Walsh and Walsh (1983)

that he twice witnessed a Redwing, perhaps the same individual, using an
anvil. Walsh and Walsh (as cited) produce circumstantial evidence for the
use of anvils to break open snails by the Kurrichane Thrush T peiios in
Upper Volta.
True tool-users in captivity
Reid's paper on the tool-using Rook Corvus frugilegus has now been
published (Reid, 1982).
When I visited the Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago in 1982 I was told by
Kevin J. Bell that their Moluccan Cockatoo Cacatua moluccensis often
used little twigs and other pieces of material to scratch itself. The bird also
grabs one of its primary feathers with a foot, bends it (tool-making?) and
uses the end to scratch under its bill and around the lower part of the head.
The barbs were missing from the end of the feather.
Bruce Hoad (pers. comm., 1983) owns a Lesser Sulphur-crested Cocka-
too Cacatua sulphurea of the race known as the Citron-crested, which
scratches itself with a spoon. Ten years earlier he owned a Blue and Gold
Macaw Ara ararauna that scratched itself with a chop bone.

A parrot of the genus Amazona, owned by Gloria Cashin (pers. comm.,
1980) regularly and often scratched itself with a spoon over a number of
years. It was an individually caged bird.
An African Grey Parrot known to Pamela Halford (pers. comm., 1981)
was naked due to an infection of the feathers and wore a specially knitted
bodice. The bird would use an object, for example part of a comb, to
scratch itself, apparently alleviating an irritation of the skin under the
"jersey".
Janzen and others (1976) report an African Grey Parrot Psittacus
erithacus that used splinters prised by the bird from the pine posts of its
cage to scratch the skin on the posterior part of its head.
An African Grey Parrot Psittacus erithacus owned by Mrs. Rosemary
Low (pers. comm. 1983) regularly scratches itself with almost any object
put in its cage.
Another case of the transportation of water in a hollow object is re-
ported by Beck (1980). "A Common Crow Corvus brachyrhynchos which
was kept at the Allee Laboratory of Animal Behaviour at the University of
Chicago was regularly supplied with various toys and trinkets for novelty.
Among these was a small plastic cup. Part of the crow's diet consisted of
dried mash. The laboratory assistants sometimes forgot to wet the mash
slightly to make it more palatable. The crow compensated for this over-
sight by dipping the plastic cup in a watering trough, carrying the filled
cup up to 5 metres to the food pan, and emptying the water on to the
mash. This behaviour was repeated until the mash was saturated and the
crow began to eat. If the water was spilled accidentally, the crow would
return to the trough for a refill rather than proceed to the food pan with
an empty cup".
A captive female Eclectus Parrot Eclectus roratus at the Brookfield Zoo,
near Chicago, was seen to use a segment of palm frond to excavate a bur-
row in the sand and gravel substratum of her cage. No nest-box was avail-
able and the parrot subsequently laid eggs in the burrow (Dennis DeCour-
cey, quoted by Beck, 1980).
Derek Wood (pers. comm., 1979), a keeper of birds at the London Zoo,
had in his charge a Wedge-tailed Eagle Aquila audax that regularly dropped
bones and other objects apparently "on" him and other keepers in her
cage. In her detailed discussion of avian play, Ficken (1977) makes it clear
that birds of prey very commonly play with sticks. The attribution of tool-
use to such behaviour therefore requires care, though, of course, if tool-
use it be, it could have evolved from play.

True tool-users in the wild
A case of apparent tool-use by a Mountain Chickadee Parus gambeli is
reported by Gaddis (1981). The bird was seen in Arizona and the incident
described as follows: "The chickadee was foraging about seven metres up
on a dead, barkless tree. It began very excitedly probing with its bill a ver-
tical crack about one cm wide and about one half metre long. It pecked at
the side of the crack and pulled off a splinter about five cm long, having a
grip on the splinter about two cm from one end. It then pushed the long
end of the splinter back into the crack and probed several times. It moved
down the crack again and probed with the splinter once more before flying
to an adjacent tree, still carrying the splinter in its bill. It held the short
end of the splinter with its foot and pulled it through its bill until it had
the other end in its bill. It then made several chewing movements on the
splinter before discarding it and flying off. I had seen nothing impaled on
the end of the splinter before the chickadee pulled it into its bill.
"Mountain Chickadees frequently excavate in decayed wood, usually
flipping removed chips over their shoulder. In over 100 hours' observation
of this species, this was the first time it was seen to use one of the removed
pieces as a tool." It would be difficult to interpret this observation as any-
thing other than tool-use, though the bird was not seen to succeed in any
sense with the implement (Boswall, 1981).
A remarkable case of tool-use by a Grey Flycatcher Bradornis micro-
rhynchus was described to me over the telephone in 1982 by Sam Mc-
Naughton. The following summarises his observations: "In 1975 during
my residence in the Serengeti National Park I twice observed a piece of
bird behaviour that despite the lapse of time and the fact that I took no
notes I have been strongly advised to place on record. The event was so
memorable that I believe I remember the details well.
"There had been an emergence of winged termites, and the front
porch of my house was littered with these animals which had by now
lost their wings. A bird that I am quite certain was a Grey Flycatcher
cleaned up all those that were available for the picking up. But there
were others in little holes in the concrete that were apparently not ac-
cessible to the bird's bill. On each of the two days concerned one bird
(possibly the same individual) flew to the adjacent lawn, picked up about
five different grass stems in its bill in turn, and then having rejected all but
one flew back to the porch with that one. The bird then poked the end
of the stem Into a "pit" - a spike hole - (maybe 2-3 cm deep and a few
mm across) containing a termite; the termite grabbed the stem and was
pulled out. The stem was then put down and the termite eaten. This
process was gone through eight or ten times on each day."

J. BOSWALL - TOOL-USING
Tool-use by Green Jays Cyanocorax yncas has been observed by
Gayou (1982) in Texas. He writes: "While studying this species at the
Santa Ana National Wildlife Refuge near Alamo, Texas, I saw use of
"tools" by a family of adult and juvenile Green Jays on 6th June 1981.
I first observed an adult Green Jay (sex unknown) on the ground pick up
a small twig in its beak and fly to a branch of a dead tree approximately
4m above the ground. The bird inserted the twig under a piece of bark
and moved it back and forth for approximately 5 secs. The jay then with-
drew the twig, placed it under its feet, and proceeded to consume an
insect that was attached to the twig. The bird then reinserted the twig
under the bark and repeated the sequence of events four consecutive
times, lasting about 2 mins. The jay dropped the twig and flew a short
distance to another tree. A few minutes later, the same adult flew back
to the branch with another short twig in its beak and again inserted it
under the bark. This time, however, the bird prised off a piece of bark,
dropped the twig, and consumed the exposed insects. Whether the jay
intentionally used the twig as a lever in this instance is unknown, since
this behaviour was not observed again.
"A juvenile Green Jay attempted to use twigs to capture insects in a
similar manner. One of the apparent offspring (which had been seen
begging for food earlier) of the previously mentioned adult jay picked
up a twig and flew to the same branch on which the adult had been
feeding. The juvenile inserted the twig several times under pieces of
bark and removed it each time but did not capture any prey item. The
total time spent attempting to feed in this manner was about 45 secs.
The bird then dropped the twig, flew to the ground, picked up another
twig, flew back to the same branch and tried again. After three unsuc-
cessful attempts lasting about 2 mins, the bird dropped the twig and
flew to another tree. Due to the inaccessibility of the branch on which
the jays were feeding, thp types of insects being consumed were unknown."
Brook (1979) quotes two 19th century cases of crows dropping stones
from a height on to eggs of the Ostrich Struthio camelus. The first is taken
from De Mosenthal and Harting (1877) who in turn quote a paper by
Atherstone (1874) in Proc. Acclim. Soc. Victoria. "Of sixty eggs, nineteen
were destroyed by black crows, which were seen from the house to hover
over the nest and let stones fall on the eggs (on running up on one occa-
sion to the nest, about 600 yards off, he (my brother, John) found three
stones in the nest, the eggs cracked and the yolk strewed about". Brooke
presumes that the "black crow" concerned is the Cape Raven (or Black
Crow) Corvus capensis. Atherstone did not say whether the stones were

carried in the bill or the feet. It is noteworthy that corvids are among the
comparatively few kinds of birds known to drop hard-shelled objects to
break them open, and that the Cape Raven in particular is known to drop
small tortoises in South Africa.
The second 19th century account is by Martin (1890) who wrote of the
Ostrich: "Having thus set her nest in order, she walks off, to fortify herself
with a good meal for the duties of the day. And now comes the white-
necked crow's chance;.An ostrich-egg is to him the daintiest of all deli-
cacies; but nature not having bestowed on him a bill strong enough to
break its hard shell, he is only able, by means of an ingenious device, to
regale on the interior. He carefully watches till the parent's back is turned,
and she is a good distance from the nest; then, flying up into the air, he
drops a stone from a great height with a most accurate aim, and breaks an
egg. He makes good use of his quarter of an hour; and he, no less than the
hen ostrich, has had an ample meal by the time the latter returns to the
nest". The "white-necked crow" is probably the Pied Crow Corvus alba
suggests Brooke.
Beck (1980) quotes Sclater in Schaller (1974) as giving an additional
instance of stone-dropping from the air by an Egyptian Vulture; in fact,
it is clear that Sclater was referring to the Andersson account that he,
Beck, quotes earlier in the same paragraph and to which I have referred
(Boswall, 1977). Schaller (1974) says that "James Stevenson-Hamilton
related in 1912 a similar incident from the Athi Plains in Kenya". Despite
quite a hard search I cannot trace this reference. Can anyone help?
Further records of Egyptian Vultures throwing stones at Ostrich eggs
are reported from the Khaibar north of Eilat in Israel. Further, on 26th
May (no year given) at 6.30 a.m. a vulture of this species was seen to
bring a stone to a garbage dump at Sede-Boger in the Negev and drop it
on to a tennis ball, presumably mistaking the tennis ball for an egg. Later
other vultures standing by picked up the ball itself and dropped it on the
ground - no doubt again mistaking the ball for an egg (Anon , 1980a) The
throwing of rocks at eggs by Egyptian Vultures is believed to have evolved
from the throwing of eggs, to smash them (Alcock, 1970).
Stone-throwing by a captive immature Egyptian Vulture is part of a
public entertainment at Kintzheim in Alsace. The bird appears in an arena
surrounded by scores of spectators, picks up stones, throws them at an

alabaster "Ostrich" egg until it breaks and then claims the reward from
inside - a lump of steak! (Martin Saunders, 16mm film for BBC Natural
History Unit).
Dow (1980) gives a remarkable account of the use of primitive weapon-
ry by wild Brush Turkeys Alectura lathami in Queensland, and quotes an
earlier comparable case concerning a captive individual of the same species.
He wrote: "Brush-turkeys visit the house regularly to feed on kitchen
scraps. I have seen as many as eleven birds there at one time. Six Brush-
turkeys individually marked with coloured plastic leg bands are regular
visitors. The first was banded on 6th February 1974. The open vegetation
and tameness of the birds makes observation easy.
"Another common resident is the Lace Monitor Varanus varius, which
also partakes of the food supplied. I first saw a feeding Brush-turkey
approached by one of these Goannas on 12 December 1976. The Brush-
turkey was a large banded male; the Goanna about 1.5 metres long. As the
Goanna rapidly approached the feeding site, the Brush-turkey turned his
back on the Goanna and suddenly set up a barrage of sand, stones and
litter with alternate powerful strokes of the legs. This halted the Goanna's
advance. The Brush-turkey then turned its right flank to the Goanna and,
while watching it with more direct gaze, proceeded with a series of
sideways kicks, like a logrunner, to fire quite accurately another jet of
debris into the face of the Goanna. The incident lasted six minutes, during
which time the Brush-turkey held the Goanna at bay. Most of the kicking
was done from the left or right flank, with about seven rapid kicks be-
tween changing sides. Then the Goanna retreated, the Brush-turkey fol-
lowed, resuming to kick sand in the face of the Goanna when it turned
towards the food.
"I thought this an interesting but isolated event until 17 March 1977,
when I saw the performance repeated by an unbanded male to a different
Goanna. To date, I have noted this defensive behaviour directed against
Goannas by five Brush-turkeys, both males and females, on fourteen
occasions. Thus it may well be a significant form of defence used by the
species.
"The barrage of litter and debris and its effectiveness are not to be
underestimated. Goannas recoiled under such attack and quickly retreated.
The Goanna's behaviour was of interest too in these circumstances. Nor-
mally the tail is held straight, close to or dragged on the ground, as it is
when chased by a human. As soon as a Goanna turned away from a Brush-
turkey, the tail was held in a tight curl as the beast made an ungraceful
exit. Once I saw a Brush-turkey peck the tip of the tail of a less careful

Goanna."
"It is interesting not only that Brush-turkeys have learned to use this
defensive behaviour against Goannas but that Goannas have learned to
withdraw their vulnerable appendage, which suggests that such inter-
actions are far from rare. The Brush-turkey's use of simple but effective
weaponry is startling when first encountered but on reflection not unpre-
dictable because precisely the same motor patterns are used by these birds
in building their nest mounds. Certainly over much of the Brush-turkey's
range outside rainforest, goannas of this or other species would be en-
countered and could well be major predators of eggs or chicks dug from
the mound. Thus the use of such a simple weapon could be a significant
adaptation against a specialised ground predator.
"I have been unable to find any published account of this anti-predator
behaviour in wild Brush-turkeys. Fleay (1937) described a captive male
that '.deliberately showered me with dirt and leaves and persisted in
doing so, no matter which side of the mound I endeavoured to approach.' "
What must surely be regarded as an even more remarkable use of a
weapon by a bird was recently reported (Anon, 1980b). In May 1980 in
the Mivtahim region of the western Negev an adult Egyptian Vulture was
seen to swoop down upon and grab in its beak a young Monitor Lizard
Varanus griscus. The bird flew up to a height of about 100 metres and
dropped the lizard which " .... was hurt but still alive. The vulture came
down, looked at its prey for a moment, flew off a few metres, and re-
turned with a stone in its beak with which it proceeded to beat the Moni-
tor on the head till it was dead". That a bird should drop a vertebrate
animal with the apparent intention of subduing if not killing it may be
without precedent in itself (though there is hearsay evidence of the Kooka-
burra Dacelo novaeguineae doing the same thing with snakes). The use of
an external object as a cudgel is a rare form of tool-use in wild birds.
Montevecchi (1978), writing under the heading "Corvids using objects to
displace gulls from nests", cites two happenings as examples of tool-use.
In the first case a Fish Crow Corvus ossifragus dropped a stalk of dried
marsh grass Spartina toward a nesting gull. The object fell about 1 metre
from the gull which remained on the nest. On the basis of the account
given no "use" occurred, and the "intention" of the crow is hardly beyond
doubt. In the second case a Raven Corvus corax perched about 1 metre
above a Kittiwake's Rissa tridactyla nest, pulled a tuft of grass from the
cliff face and dropped it. It fell on the gull which took flight and the
Raven rummaged through the nest which was empty. Ravens at this loca-
tion frequently supplant nesting Kittiwakes by suddenly approaching

them closely while calling loudly, or sometimes by physical attack. In
this case an object released by one bird hit another which then departed.
On the basis of the one instance it is again difficult to be sure that the
behaviour was not displacement activity and the effect gratuitous.

A LORY COLLECTION
By F.C. BARNICOAT (Johannesburg, South Africa)
It is unusual in this country to find a bird keeper keen to specialise
in a single group of birds, but such is Luch Luzzato. He has chosen the
Loriidae, and the resolution not to yield to the temptation of bringing
any other type of bird into his collection is paying a rich dividend in
terms of success and depth of experience with his speciality. He started
keeping lorikeets 11 years ago with a pair of the Ornate, which he con-
sidered the most beautiful bird he had seen. With this pair he mastered
the art of keeping and breeding this type of bird with such success that
this pair eventually reared 21 young through the years and, when these
birds died within a few days of each other, it was estimated that they

F.C. BARNICOAT - A LORY COLLECTION
were 18 years old by including the time they had been in the posses-
sion of their former owner. Both these birds were submitted to a taxi-
dermist who arranged them on a branch in a pretty set piece, which
has a place of honour in the dining room and forms an appropriate intro-
duction to the fine collection of lories maintained in three extensive
ranges of aviaries outside in the lovely terraced garden in the hilly eastern
suburb of Johannesburg, called Observatory.
Luch Luzzato has found that lories do not require very large aviaries
to breed successfully. His aviaries are a standard width of 1 m. and height
of 2 m. and vary in length from 2.5 to 6 m., the average length being
3 m. The best breeding results are sometimes obtained in the shortest
aviaries, and his first breeding success with the Ornates was in a cage .5m
wide, 1.4 m. long and 1.3 m. high on a flat balcony.
Secondly, as most lories are associated with tropical climates, they are
surprisingly insensitive to cold. All shelters are fully open in the front and
this hilly part of Johannesburg gets very cold on winter nights, being ex-
posed to the icy south winds, and water bowls are frequently frozen solid
by morning. The fact that ninety percent of lories roost in a nest-box may
help to keep them free from trouble in spells of cold weather.
The feeding programme is methodical. On four days of the week the
proprietary breakfast cereal "Pro Nutro" and honey are blended together
in the approximate proportion of 12:1 and boiling water is added to bring
the mixture to the consistency of fairly thick porridge. On the other three
days of the week, LuclTs wife prepares a mielie-meal (ground maize)
porridge, taking care not to get it lumpy as lories like it very smooth and
sweetened with honey or sugar. Each aviary is also supplied daily with a
small dish of honey-water (1 teaspoon honey to 4 tablespoons water, i.e.
approximately 1:16) and a bowl of pure water in case the lories feel like
drinking or bathing, which some species do. The lories are also given fruit
in season, the sweet varieties of apple being the staple and most other fruits
except banana being accepted. Fruit is not necessarily fed every day, but
in general each pair consumes one large apple per week or the equivalent in
other fruit. Each pair also has a dish of sunflower seeds available at all
times, and some of them seem to enjoy this.
Luch stresses that the commonest mistake made in the feeding of
lories is to use too strong a concentration of honey, which he did original-
ly with his Ornate Lorikeets. These were kept on a food mixed at the rate
of 1 tablespoon honey to 3 tablespoons "Pro Nutro", i.e. 1:3 and although
the birds lived on this diet, their first two broods failed, the chicks dying a
few days after hatching. Then the amount of honey was reduced to 1 tea-

spoon to 3 tablespoons of "Pro Nutro", i.e. 1:12, and from then on the
young were reared without trouble. The feeding is kept as simple as pos-
sible and vitamin additives are used at infrequent intervals. Cytacon (vita-
min B) and Abidec (multivitamin) are the ones used, and wheat germ oil
is occasionally added to the "Pro Nutro" mixture. The addition of Brew-
er's yeast powder, especially in the cold season, is considered beneficial,
and has been notably successful in restoring birds showing arthritic symp-
toms to full health. Tapeworm and roundworm infestation has been ex-
perienced in odd specimens of various species and the problem has always
been discovered through the observation that the affected bird was eating
far more than usual. The normal deworming procedures have been applied
to the lories with complete success.
The inspection of nest boxes is not shunned; on the contrary, it is
considered desirable on an almost daily basis when there are youngsters.
Not only can a dead chick be removed in time to save the life of a nest-
mate, but the progress of all chicks can be monitored, and if the growth
rate of any one starts to deteriorate, it is removed for hand-rearing. They
are easily fed on much the same food as is used for the adults, but this
must be done almost two-hourly throughout the day and early part of the
night. Many a chick has been saved in this manner.
Another type of inspection that has paid dividends is the nightly one
of each of the aviaries, carried out with a torch at 9.00 p.m. Each com-
partment is checked to see if both birds are roosting safely in their nest-
box or at least on a perch under cover. If there has been some disturbance
such as that caused by mice, the birds may be found clinging to the wire
and be resettled on a perch in an adequately sheltered position or even
taken into the house for the night, and the source of the disturbance can
be looked into. The lories have become quite used to this inspection, much
is learned about their habits and individual personalities, and their welfare
is safeguarded.
Here follow brief notes on the species in the collection:
Black Lory. One pair from which it is hoped to breed in time.
Yellow-streaked Lory. One pair has got as far as laying eggs, but young
have not yet been hatched. Another pair has recently been acquired as a
determined effort is being made to breed this species. A sexual difference
that has been noted is that the yellow ring in the eye appears to be much
brighter in a male than in a female.
Red (or Moluccan) Lory. Two pairs which breed almost all the year
round. In 1981 four young were reared per pair and the success was
repeated in 1982.

F.C. BARNICOAT - A LORY COLLECTION
Black-winged Lory. There is one pair of this most beautiful species. In
1981 their eggs were infertile. In 1982 they looked to be an extremely
promising breeding proposition, the cock frequently displaying to the hen
and feeding her, but no eggs were laid.
Blue-streaked Lory. Two pairs, both of which have bred. An incubation
period of 26 days was recorded and the chicks spent 75 days in the nest.
When nesting, this species throws most of the sawdust and earth out of the
nest-box it chooses. Both pairs were successful parents again in 1982.
Dusky Lory. A pair of the yellow-bellied form breeds every year. Some
of their offspring are orange-bellied. Another pair are of the orange-bellied
form and produced four chicks in 1980 and two chicks in 1981 and again
in 1982. The third pair is also orange-bellied and consists of an old wid-
owed hen, a good breeder, now mated to a young cock bred the previous
year. Their eggs this year were infertile, indicating that the male was too
immature for breeding. So far, orange-bellied pairs have thrown only
orange-bellied youngsters. They are easily sexed, the mature male having a
small strip of orange skin above the eye.
Ornate Lorikeet. One breeding pair and a young hen are currently in
the collection. This very beautiful species is a particularly successful breed-
er, giving two or three rounds per year. They take three years to mature
for breeding.
Edward's Lory. Two pairs. These have been bred without trouble
since 1975 and a pair had two newly-hatched chicks at the time of my
visit. Plucking is quite a problem with this species.
Swainson's (or Rainbow) Lory. Two breeding pairs and three fine hens
for which mates cannot be obtained. One pair, which was again down on
eggs, had six young to its credit for the previous year. In two and a half
years ten chicks had been produced and surgical sexing had shown them to
be nine hens and one cock.
Scaly-breasted Lorikeet. One pair, which breeds more or less continu-
ously, producing two or three rounds per year with one or two chicks at a
time.
Perfect Lorikeet. An excellent breeding pair has bred from 1976 to
date. They lay up to four eggs in a clutch.
Goldie's Lorikeet. A South African-bred pair had been bought but both
birds had died within a fortnight. The intention is to replace these later
in 1983.
Chattering Lory. Three breeding pairs. This species usually breeds only
once per year about October, rearing two young. Sometimes, if the weath-
er is particularly favourable in the early spring, they start breeding earlier

than usual and then they may produce a second round. As usual they bred
well in 1982.
Black-capped Lory. Two pairs. These are also good breeders. The
amount of purple on the belly and neck tends to vary slightly with the
individual, perhaps indicating that more than one subspecies has been in-
corporated in this stock. When the young leave the nest, they are almost
entirely purple in the front and the red area increases in size gradually
until they reach maturity after three years.
Purple-naped Lory. One pair was purchased late in 1982. They have
not yet bred.
Stella's Lorikeet. At the time of going to press a pair of this beautiful
and easily sexed species had just been imported from Germany.

A survey carried out by Simon Stuart of Cambridge University on
behalf of the World Wildlife Fund in the forests of Usumbara, Uluguru and
Uzungwa in Tanzania, has uncovered a new bird species and the rediscovery
of another after a 20-year lapse since the last sighting in East Africa. The
discovery of the new Sunbird, popularly known as the Rufous-winged, is
of considerable interest and it is said to be quite distinct from any species
previously described. Uzungwa Forest is the home of the rediscovered
White-winged Apalis.

Four California Condor chicks have been hatched at San Diego Wild
Animal Park this year, all from eggs taken from the wild. Two were from
a pair that has previously failed to incubate their eggs; one was the
result of a successful case of "double clutching", and one from a pair that
was still feeding a chick. ( Audubon , Vol. 24, No. 12). Numbers of this
critically endangered species are believed to be below 20 in the wild.

We are investigating the current status of this very rare species, former-
ly recorded in West Africa, from Sierra Leone to Ghana, and would like to
ask for any information that your members may have concerning it. In
particular, we would be most interested to know of any specimens that
may exist, or may recently have existed, in captivity, either in private or
public collections. In view of this bird's probable impending extinction in
the wild, any information about captive populations, particularly if they
are breeding, is of great importance and I would be most grateful to hear
from anyone with such knowledge, at the address given below.
If we cannot trace any viable populations in captivity, then we are con-
sidering proposing an expedition to capture some birds in order to start
such a population since we believe that the future of the species would be
more secure with a well managed captive stock.

Price: #23.75 hardback; #18.50 paperback
This annual publication produced by the Zoological Society of London
is the most important outlet for the dissemination of knowledge and ideas
within the zoological world, as well as being readily accessible to "out-
siders". The present volume lives up to the standards set previously and
contains a wealth of interesting papers covering many aspects of zoo
management, although sadly the interest is limited from an avicultural
viewpoint.
The layout follows previous volumes in being divided into three sec-
tions. Section I contains a series of twenty specialised papers on New
World primates, mainly of captive origin but also touches on status and
conservation in the wild (Birds of Prey will feature in the specialised
section for Volume 23).
Section II covers developments in the zoo world and is subdivided
further to encompass breeding, husbandry, hand-rearing and new build-
ings. It is here that the only three papers on birds appear. These cover
breeding the Scarlet Cock-of-the-Rock and Renauld's Ground Cuckoo
at Houston Zoo and Metro Toronto Zoo respectively, and data on arti-
ficial incubation of Cassowary eggs. Articles on birds, except when a group
is covered by the specialist first section, always come a poor third behind
mammals and reptiles; it seems that zoo curators are just as reluctant as
are private aviculturists to write up their notes - what a terrible waste of
information.
The third part is devoted to the reference section and contains a
wealth of items. A list of zoos and aquaria of the world is given with all
relevant information on personnel, plus a numerical summary of animals
in the collections during 1980. Details are also given of studbooks and world
registers of wild animals in captivity and a census of all rare animals held
in public collections in 1981 is included. Lists of birds, mammals, fish,
amphibians and reptiles bred during 1980 brings up the tail of this
excellent publication.
Despite the limited appeal it has for the majority of aviculturists, it
is well worth borrowing from a library, if obtainable, especially for the
reference section.

Penguins (family Spheniscidae) are a group of flightless seabirds which
occur only in the southern hemisphere. They have a wide distribution,
breeding on many of the sub-Antarctic islands ranging from the Galapagos
to the Antarctic mainland. They spend most of their lives at sea, coming to
land mainly to breed and moult. Six genera are recognised, which can be
divided into 18 species (Stonehouse, 1975).
Penguins have always been popular exhibits in zoos, and although most
collections include a small group, relatively few establishments breed them
successfully. According to the records published each year in the Inter-
national Zoo Yearbook, only nine species have been bred between 1975
and 1980 - these are listed in Table 1. Sea World, San Diego, hatched and
reared the first Emperor Penguin chick in 1980. The number of institu-
tions breeding each species is also listed in the Table but these must repres-
ent a small proportion of the total that are keeping captive penguins.
Table 1 shows that the only species that are really successfully bred are the
Blackfoot and Humboldt's; these are undoubtedly the most commonly
kept.
Edinburgh Zoo has been connected with penguins since the inception
of the Zoo and was one of the first institutions to take the captive breed-
ing of penguins seriously. The first penguins, four Kings, arrived in 1914,
and the first King chick to be hatched in captivity was reared in 1919
(Gillispie, 1932). Apart from one year after World War II, there have been
King Penguins at the Zoo ever since, and a total of 126 chicks have been
successfully reared.
Edinburgh Zoo's association with penguins came about through the
generosity of the Salvesen Whaling Company, who brought back birds
from the regions of the Falkland Islands and South Georgia to the Zoo.
Birds were obtained from this source from 1914 until the last import in
1963. Over this period a total of 856 birds from six species were imported

(Table 2). The table shows that although four of the six species bred, only
two, the King and Gentoo, were really successful: these two species were
also imported in the largest numbers, and were collected on South Georgia.
Over the years, three other species that were obtained from other sources
have been kept at the Zoo (Table 2). However, the only species that
have had viable breeding results, in that the captive populations have
increased through breeding alone, are the King and the Gentoo Penguins.
Since 1971 the Zoo has kept three species of penguin: King, Gentoo
and Rockhopper. All birds in the King and Gentoo colonies were either
imported from the wild up until 1963 or captive-bred in the Zoo: the
majority of the birds are now captive-bred stock. The Rockhopper Penguins
were acquired between 1971-73. These three species present different
maintenance and breeding problems, and will be dealt with separately.

This species is difficult to breed in captivity and a recent survey, based
on the information published annually in the International Zoo Yearbook
and the results of questionnaires sent to zoos, showed that of the 23 insti-
tutions that keep King Penguins, only nine had reared chicks, and a further
three had hatched chicks but not reared them. A more detailed analysis of
16 colonies showed that although the chick survival rate was good (average
71%), hatchability was poor (average 25%), indicating either a high level of
infertility or early embryo death (Stevenson, 1983).
The birds in the King Penguin colony at Edinburgh Zoo were flipper-
banded in 1979, thus four years' data on pair behaviour at breeding is
available. The birds were sexed by cloacal examination in 1982 (Samour,
et al, 1983), and during the four-year period the number of adult birds
averaged 30.
Kings are the only species of penguin to moult prior to breeding, and
at Edinburgh Zoo moulting takes place from mid-March to April. The birds
then move to the area in the large penguin enclosure which they use for
breeding: the King Penguins are kept in the same enclosure as the Gentoos
but move to the same spot for breeding each year. Most of the eggs are laid
from mid-May to late July. King Penguin females only lay one egg, which
is incubated on the feet, with the brood patch forming a pouch that covers
the egg (Fig. 1). Chicks hatch after an incubation period of 51-56 days, in
July and August, and are fed on regurgitated fish by the parent birds.
Chicks have few feathers on hatching and are brooded under the pouch, on
the adult bird's feet.
In the wild, King Penguins rear their chicks for almost 12 months and,
therefore, can rear only two chicks every three years (Stonehouse, 1960).
In captivity this pattern can be changed. Some zoos remove chicks at a few

months old, others leave them with the parent birds (Stevenson, 1983).
The current policy at Edinburgh Zoo is to remove chicks at about two
months old and hand-feed until about eight months (Fig. 2) when they are
re-introduced to the adults. This policy results in the maximum survival
rate of chicks and puts less strain on the adult birds. It should also mean,
in theory, that the adult birds can breed once a year. Table 3 gives details
of the breeding performances of 13 females that were of breeding age and
in the colony for each of the four years from 1980-83. Only one female
laid and hatched every year, and only four females (31%) laid each year,
54% laid for three of the years. There was no indication that birds that
hatched a chick one year did not lay the next. Five females had the same
partner for two of the four years, but none had the same partner for more
than that. Of the four females that laid each year, two had the same mate
for two years and the other two, including the most successful breeder,
had a different mate each year. These data suggest, therefore, that captive
King Penguins do not show a strong degree of monogamous bonding,

which may also be the case in the wild (Stonehouse, 1960).
Not only do the birds not show strong monogamous bonding, but
many birds form triangular relationships, which may result in an egg being
passed between as many as six different birds. In 1983 the pair that pro-
duced one egg kept it for 46 days, then it passed to another pair, which
had the egg when the chick hatched. The chick has been cared for by these
two birds and another four since hatching. There was a similar occurrence
in 1982 when a chick that hatched with its parents, was subsequently
cared for by at least two other birds: all caretakers feed the chick. Gillispie
(1932) reports similar happenings with the first chicks to be hatched at the
Zoo. These phenomena may be partly due to the fact that although be-
tween 10 and 12 eggs are laid each year, only 2-4 chicks actually hatch;
thus many birds showing brooding behaviour do not have chicks of their
own.
King Penguin chicks at Edinburgh Zoo moult into the juvenile plumage
at about eight months old, which is slightly earlier than in the wild (Stone-
house, 1960). They do not obtain their adult plumage until the second
moult, at almost two years old. Although it is unusual, two-year old birds
have produced fertile eggs at the Zoo: in the wild King Penguins do not
breed until five years old (Stonehouse, 1960).

Gentoo Penguin
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9995928" page_id="56319832"  page_num="192" year="" vol="">
The colony of Gentoo Penguins started in 1947, with the importation
of 11 birds: all the previous birds had died off during the war. The first
chick had hatched in 1937. The management of Gentoo Penguins at the
Zoo has been described by Wheater (1976).
The Gentoo Penguins are fed whole, ungutted Whiting, as are the Kings.
Although no supplements had been given to either species until 1983, the
Zoo is now experimenting with some supplementation, and reconsidering
its policy. The birds are fed twice a day, with an extra morning feed being
given to birds rearing chicks.
The colony size of adult birds varies between 80 and 90 birds, although
between 1979 and 1983 the actual number of successful breeding pairs
varied from 19-21 (Table 4). Some birds do not breed and some form
female-female pairs as there is an excess of female birds; at the beginning
of 1983 there were 33 males, 48 females and eight unsexed birds.
Nest rings are put out in mid-March each year and the first eggs are
laid at the end of March/beginning of April. Both members of pairs sit on
eggs; the incubation period from 133 eggs had a mean average of 35.28
days with a range of 32-39 days. Females lay two eggs, and data over a
five-year period (n= 152) give a laying interval of 3.3 +/- 0.8 days: both
this and the incubation period agree well with the figures given by Gwynn

(1953). When two chicks hatch, they hatch within 24 hours of each other,
thus the first egg must not be incubated for the first two or three days
after laying.
Like the Kings, the Gentoos are also flipper-banded and there are now
data on pairing and breeding success for five years, from 19791983. In
that period, 36 heterosexually paired birds had the same partner each year.
Of these 18 pairs, only seven had the same nest site each year, although
the nest layout was the same each year. Most changes in partners could be
attributed to the death of a bird, but six birds habitually changed mates
over the five-year period. The most successful breeders had the same
partner each year but there was no indication that the more successful
breeders stayed in the same nest sites each year. Birds do pair again after a
mate dies, and some female birds that had paired with another female
for several years, paired with a male and bred after the death of a female
mate.
Both parents incubate eggs, brood and feed chicks. Pairs defend the
territory of their nest area from adjacent pairs and birds walking past. The
chicks are fed regurgitated fish: chicks beg for food by vocalising and tap-
ping the bill of the parent. The parent responds by feeding the chick
(Fig. 4). About 50% of successful pairs hatch two chicks (Fig. 3). The
chicks are brooded by the adult birds until they are over one week old,
when a secondary darker grey down forms. Newly hatched chicks weigh
about 80 grams, increasing to 300 g. by the end of the first week and
800 g. by the end of the second. By six weeks old, when they are moulting
into adult plumage, the chicks weigh about 6 kg. From four weeks old,
chicks chase parents around the enclosure, demanding feeding (Fig. 5).
In the captive environment the parent bird cannot escape the chick, and
this puts a certain amount of stress on the adults, especially as the weather
is getting hotter at this time of year. Gentoo chicks would, in the wild,
form a creche at this stage (van Zinderen Bakker, 1970): it has thus been
found to be to the advantage of both chicks and parents to remove the
chicks to a separate enclosure at between five and seven weeks old. There
the chicks are accustomed to being hand-fed small Whiting from their
keepers, and after about two weeks, when they are feeding well three
times per day, they are given access to a pool. Between 18-25 chicks are
reared each year, most post-fledging deaths are due to aspergillosis. Some
chicks are sent to other collections and others are re-introduced to the
adult colony at about 10 months old.
The adult birds moult in August, at an equivalent time in relation to
chick rearing, as in the wild.
Edinburgh Zoo's Gentoo Penguins have founded most of the captive
Gentoo colonies in world zoos.

Although many collections keep Rockhopper Penguins, few breed them
and when chicks are hatched, the rearing success is poor. Table 1 shows
that only 27% of chicks were reared from the period of 1976-30: the
cause of this is unclear (Stevenson, 1983).
The present colony at Edinburgh Zoo was founded in 1971, with more
birds arriving in 1972 and 1973. In 1982 four female Long-crested birds
were received on breeding loan from Bristol Zoo. At present there are 16
birds: four males of the Short-crested race, and seven females and five
males of the Long-crested race. It is possible that these two forms, which
originate from different geographical areas, constitute two distinct species
(Jouventin, 1982) and mixing the two may accentuate breeding problems.
Unfortunately, many institutions are unaware of the existence of the two
races.
The enclosure consists of a natural rock face with nesting crevices, and
a pool in the foreground. The birds are fed once per day on sprats with the
addition of 100 mg Thiamine per bird per day. When sprats are not avail-

able, they are fed small Whiting without the Thiamine supplement. In
1983 a supplement of Mazuri Fish Eater Powder was given to each bird
each day, and it is intended to continue this practice.
The birds are given stones in March, from which they construct their
own nests. There were three breeding pairs up until 1983, when the loss of
one female resulted in two. Two of the Bristol females paired with two
Long-crested males in 1983 but did not lay; it is hoped that they may do
so in 1984. Eggs are laid at the end of March, beginning of April. Rock-
hopper females lay two eggs, the first being smaller than the second. The
number of days between egg-laying was 5.1 +/- LI (n=13), which falls
within the range given by Williams (1981). The incubation period (n=14)
ranged from 31-37 days with a mean of 34.1 +/- 1.5, which agrees with
than of Warham (1975) and Williams (1981) from studies of wild birds.
Both male and female birds incubate eggs to the same degree, but the
bird not incubating usually stands in attendance (Fig. 6). Male Rock-
hoppers are very aggressive, attacking everything that comes within range
of the nest. In the Zoo there have been only three cases of both eggs
hatching, and in the wild Rockhopper Penguins are reputed to rear only
one chick. On hatching Rockhopper chicks have a brown natal down on
the back and head with white on the ventral surface. The beak is dark with
a conspicuous light-coloured egg tooth (Fig. 7). The feet are dark and the
eyes open within three days of hatching.
The two chicks that were successfully hand-reared were removed from
the parent birds at hatching and kept in separate plastic cake containers
with paper towelling as a substrate, which was changed after each feed.
Full details of the method can be found in Stevenson (1981) but an out-
line will be given here. The diet was a gruel, based on that used by Sea World
(Todd, 1980). This was as follows:

The frequency of feeds was decreased as the chicks grew and fish was intro-
duced in the third week. For the first week the temperature was kept
within a range of 21*C to 28*C, being reduced as the chicks grew. Although
the hand-rearing programme was very successful in 1981, problems have
been encountered in subsequent years, and no chicks were reared in 1982
or 1983. It is thought that these failures were due to either overheating the
chicks or contamination of feed. However, hand-rearing penguin chicks
can be very successful once the problems have been resolved (Todd, 1980).
The hand-reared chicks started moulting in the seventh week, and were
not fully moulted until 90 days old. Nelson (1980) cites 67-72 days as the
age of complete moult, thus the development of the hand-reared chicks
might have been somewhat slower than that of parent-reared chicks. Fully
moulted chicks have a juvenile plumage with a black superciliary stripe,
unlike the yellow tassels of the adults. These and the yellow stripe are not
produced until the second moult when the birds are one year old; adult
Rockhoppers in the Zoo moult in September.
With increased drilling for undersea oil and proposed developments in
the Antarctic regions, no species of penguin can be considered safe, and
two are already considered endangered - the Black-footed or Jackass Pen-
guin and Humboldt's Penguin. Man has in the past been responsible for the
carnage of thousands of penguins (Paterson, 1978) and we must try to
rectify this by not only conserving wild stocks but by a sensible and scien-
tific approach to captive management. It is vital that captive colonies are
self-supporting and breeding well. Although there have been considerable
advances in the management and husbandry of captive Spheniscidae in
recent years, many problems remain, one of the most important being
captive diet and correct supplementation of the fish (Gaily-Phipps and
Sladen, 1982). It is important that zoos like Edinburgh pool their know-
ledge and continue to research methods of husbandry and management in
order to improve breeding performance.

NOTES ON BREEDING THE WATER RAILRa/Zhs aquaticus
IN CAPTIVITY AT THE PARK OF VILLARS-LES-DOMBES,
FRANCE
By P. CORDONNIER
No record has been found of a captive breeding of this common species
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.969917727272727" page_id="56319843"  page_num="203" year="" vol="">
in the ornithological literature such as the International Zoo Yearbook and
Records of First Breeding under Controlled Conditions in Europe
(Kramer, 1980). This last author reports that only two out of nine species
of European Rallidae have not been bred in captivity - the Water Rail and
the Little Crake Porzana parva. Nevertheless, other parks or private
persons may have achieved this breeding as recent results have not been
published yet.
Our breeding pair of Water Rail consisted of two birds found injured
(probably knocked by a vehicle) in the autumn of 1981. They were
placed in an aviary measuring 16 x 8 m. which had thick grassy and bushy
vegetation and sheltered various waders and song birds.

P. CORDONNIER - BREEDING THE WATER RAIL
The nest was built in a tuft of rushes and the five eggs were incubated
by the parents. Four chicks hatched on 18th July, 1982. Some 12 hours
elapsed between the First and the fourth hatching. The fifth egg was
infertile.
Immediately after hatching, the chicks were placed into an incubator
with three Purple Gallinules hatched on 21st July. Rearing techniques
were the same as those used for waders: the chicks were placed into an
aquarium measuring 50 x 30 cm, heated to 36*C at one end, and the
bottom covered with soft paper. When ten days old, they were transferred
into a larger breeding box lined with turf layers. When six weeks old, they
were able to live in an unheated aviary.
Their food was composed of minced meat, dog pellets and small pieces
of Fish. Unlike other young waders, they had to be hand-fed for the First
week, even though live food (maggots and very young crickets) seemed to
cause a lot of excitement and swift movements in the chicks. One of the
four chicks died at a week old.
Details concerning growth and feather development have been des-
cribed elsewhere (Cordonnier, 1983).
The young have been kept in an aviary smaller than that of their
parents in order to watch their possible breeding behaviour which com-
pletely escaped notice in 1982 (no song reported, birds very secret, date
of laying unknown).
We would appreciate any remarks and observations from other people
keeping this species.

HAND-REARING AND GROWTH OF THE PURPLE
GALLINULE Porphyrio p. porphyria
AT THE PARK OF VILLARS-LES-DOMBES, FRANCE
By P. CORDONNIER
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.986384588235294" page_id="56319845"  page_num="205" year="" vol="">
Our breeding pair of Purple Gallinules was purchased in 1978 and
placed in an aviary 7 m. square, together with some 15 exotic birds such
as toucans and parrots. Both Gallinules belonged to the nominal form
Porphyrio p. porphyrio (L.) and did not show any grey or green hue in
their feathers (Cramp et al , 1980). The sexes look alike.
The aviary floor was covered with sand and earth. Purple Gallinules
destroy low vegetation, and even the strong leaves of Hevea (Holyoak,
1970). Indeed, this species plays a useful part in the wild by mowing and
destroying vegetation (Geroudet, 1978).
The food given in the aviary was quite varied: seeds, a mash made up of
insects, fruits, and, specifically for the Purple Gallinules, small fish and
minced meat. Live insects (mealworms, crickets) were also given regularly.
The Gallinules' diet seems to be very catholic.
All aspects of behaviour that could be observed (bathing, feeding habits,
displays, matings, etc.) tally with those described by Holyoak (op. cit.).
We also noticed that the birds roosted on branches 4-5m high to sleep.
Building the nest, or more precisely carrying materials to build it, kept
the birds busy nearly all the year round. Bunches of rushes were given
every week and displays and matings occurred very frequently.
As reported by Harrison (1975), the nest was small (inside diameter
about 17 cm) and was built in one of the aviary corners, behind a clump
of rushes, the tops of which formed a roof.
Laying
The hen laid for the first time in 1981: the first egg was noted on 21st
June and was followed by two more, all infertile.
In 1982, as early as 16th June, one of the adults kept staying on the
nest. The first egg was laid on 20th June and the clutch of four eggs was
completed on 25th June. Both adults took turns to sit on the eggs.
The first chick hatched during the morning of 21st July, the second at
noon and the third in the night. The fourth egg was infertile. Thus incuba-
tion lasts from 26 to 31 days (26 days is a minimum if the first egg is
incubated immediately after it was laid). According to Cramp et al. (op.
cit.) and to Harrison (op. cit.) incubation lasts 22 to 25 days, and to Ger-
oudet (op. cit) 24 to 25 days.

The young left the nest soon after hatching, and the parents seems to
take no further interest in them. An adult sometimes seized a chick by its
leg and shook it. This behaviour, together with the presence of toucans
in the aviary, persuaded us to rear the chicks artificially.

The chicks were reared together with three Water Rails, hatched on
18th July. Rearing techniques were the standard ones used for waders
(e.g. Goss-Custard et al, 1971): the chicks were placed in an aquarium
measuring 50 x 30 cm, heated to 36*C at one end, and the bottom of
which was covered with soft paper.
Food (minced meat, dog pellets, bits of fish, maggots and young
crickets) was put into a dish 1 cm high, filled with water. When ten days
old, the chicks were transferred to a larger breeding box lined with turf
layers. When six weeks old, they were able to live in an unheated aviary.
Unlike most young waders, they had to be hand-fed during the first ten
days. One of the three chicks, which had remained very small, died when
30 days old.

Growth of the chicks
The growth of the young Purple Gallinules was comparable to that of
Water Rails and a Coot reared at the same time - for weights see Fig. 1.
Since weight fluctuates during the day (Blake, 1956), the measure-
ments were made in the morning. The weight at hatching (29 g) was
similar to the one reported by Fjeldsa (1977), i.e. 30 g. Growth was
slower for the Purple Gallinules than for the two other species. The defini-
tive weight was reached only when the birds were about four months old.
Bill length and frontal shield length were both measured (Fig. 2). The
frontal shield appeared from the 28th day and was well formed by the
35th. It started reddening from the 76th day. Although bill growth was
complete when the birds were three months old, the plain red colour
only appeared when they were over four months old.
The tarsus is very long and grows quickly to maximum length at two
months (tarsus length - Fig. 3). The legs were pink at hatching and became
greyish afterwards. At four months, they still retain a grey-blackish hue.
Folded wing (maximum extension) was measured as soon as flight
feathers started appearing from the sheaths up to one-third of their length
(46th day) (Fig. 4). Flight feathers appeared simultaneously at 13 days.
Their development was almost over at 76 days. The rest of the wing
feathers were completed by then, but the birds were not able to fly before
they were 90 days old. It seems doubtful whether the birds can fly when
60 days old, as Cramp et al (op. cit.) have suggested.
The long white filament visible among the first down had almost com-
pletely disappeared at 13 days. Thigh feathers and wing coverts appeared
at 28 days, belly feathers at 35 days.
At 39 days, cheeks, chest and scapulars took on a bluish colour, while
the undertail coverts were white.
At 43 days, a few white feathers had dotted the blue colour of the
belly, and the chest was entirely blue. This colour had spread over the
whole head at 52 days. The iris, which was brown at hatching, got lighter
around the 100th day.

REFLECTIONS ON POOR HATCHABILITY OF
WATERFOWL EGGS AT THE WILDFOWL TRUST
(Slimbridge, Gloustershire)

The hatchability of waterfowl eggs when laid by captive birds presents
different challenges from those that arise when considering hatching eggs
of poultry or game birds.
The Wildfowl Trust is concerned with the order of birds known as An-
seriforms, and particularly the family Anatidae - the swans, geese and ducks.
Also included in our collection of birds are the Phoenicopteridae, the fla-
mingos, which have slightly different egg hatching requirements from those
outlined in this paper. There are 247 described forms of swans, geese and
ducks, comprised within 151 full species. These full species can be divided
into 12 different tribes. Of the 247 described kinds, 180 are represented in
the Trust's collection, some 6,000 in all. The collection is maintained at
the Trust's five centres in England. One hundred and forty of the 180
kinds maintained will breed and about 1,800 birds will be reared each year
for restocking purposes and for the enjoyment and education of our public
visitors.

Many birds breeding with us are only one or two generations removed
from their wild ancestors, whose natural way of life is far removed from
that at the New Grounds in Gloucestershire. Re-stocking from the wild is
important if we are consistently to breed true to type. Eggs taken from the
wild under licence are transported to the Trust in portable incubators
during their middle incubation period and hatch under quarantine condi-
tions.We have recently hatched eggs successfully that have been thus
transported from South America, the Falklands, Alaska, Australia, Africa,
Finland and Iceland. The hatching success with correctly handled wild-
taken eggs is normally high, though low if eggs are transported fresh or
newly set. In this case, embryos may become weakened or broken. Al-
ternatively, if near hatching, they may become overheated through self-
generated heat. Suffocation through lack of oxygen may also occur.
For the most part, however, we are concerned with the hatching of
eggs laid in captivity. Here the problems surrounding fertile egg produc-
tion are numerous, for in the management of non-domestic birds, attempts
have to be made to simulate natural conditions.
Diet, pair compatibility, flock size, day length, disease, stress, disturb-
ance and so on are our continual considerations. If inbreeding is avoided,
a high rate of egg hatchabdity can be achieved after successive generations
of captive breeding. This necessarily involves some measure of artifi-
cial selection and the "evolved" characteristics in the individual may
mean that the species no longer reproduces true to type. This aspect needs
to be carefully monitored.
Even following fertile egg production, the variation of incubation
requirements within the waterfowl group is enormous. This particularly
concerns nest microclimate and there may be other variations In species&amp;apos;
body temperatures and humidity requirements. Brent Geese nest above
arctic permafrost where the ground temperature Is near zero degrees:
Egyptian Geese obviously incubate under quite contrary conditions.
Hawaiian Geese in nature have no access to water; Barnacle Geese nest
on tundra islands and will swim to gain access to their nests. External
climatic conditions are also significant. Tropical waterfowl may not truly
incubate or may even deliberately cool their eggs as part of Incubation.
Arctic Eider ducks may stay on their nests for several consecutive days.
Egg size too varies considerably within the waterfowl group. A teal's egg
weighs 25 grams and that of a Black Swan some 300 grams. Shell com-
position, and thus water vapour conductivity, is similarly very variable
and Incubation periods span from 20 days for the parasitic Black-headed
Duck to 36 days for a Trumpeter Swan. The equation drawn up round the
egg weight/shell conductivity/incubation period constants are of great
importance to us, but the practical problems of using this knowledge

during the relatively short egg production period in England are great
when catering for the variables described.
Most artificial waterfowl hatching is based on inherited keepering
tradition and on art rather than science. However, there is usually logic in
traditional practices but it often occurs that incorrect artificial incubation
is not detected until the point of hatch. For this reason, eggs at the Wild-
fowl Trust are hatched in a high humidity incubator so that the atmos-
phere inside and surrounding the eggs is similar. Such humid conditions
do not occur in nature but by the reduction of the natural drying process,
some corrective surgery is possible to overcome incubation errors. Forty
per cent of eggs hatched artificially at the Trust are "manipulated" at
hatching.
A summary of our basic hatching routine follows:-
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9936455" page_id="56319852"  page_num="212" year="" vol="">
1. Eggs are generally gathered daily. The first four eggs in a clutch are
replaced by artificial eggs (the clutch size of waterfowl species varies
from 3-18 eggs). Second broods are encouraged from established birds.
2. After basic cleaning with water, where appropriate, eggs are stored on

sterile sand at room temperature. No other form of cleaning is now
undertaken, for in the past this proved to have no advantage. Indeed,
throughout the incubation process and during subsequent chick devel-
opment we are concerned to produce birds that have some immunity
to the "natural" conditions they will later encounter. Stored eggs are

turned daily.
3. On completion of the clutch, eggs are set in one of the following ways:-
a) returned to the natural parent
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.953292333333333" page_id="56319852"  page_num="212" year="" vol="">
b) set under a similar type foster parent
c) set under broody bantams or hens
d) set in a forced-air Anderson-Brown incubator
The complete incubation process follows a variation of these systems
but all birds that are to be &amp;apos;hand-reared are hatched in our own forced-air
incubators in 90%+ humidity. A typical incubation example would be: fresh
eggs set under broody bantam and removed after ten days to an Anderson-
Brown incubator (low humidity 40%). At this point, the eggs are candled.
They are removed after a further 15 days to a small 40-egg forced-air in-
cubator, where humidity is increased to 60%. On pipping, they are moved
to a high humidity hatcher (90%), and the chicks removed to a drier an
hour after hatching.

Incubator temperatures are a constant 36.5 degrees which is considered
low by some aviculturists but improves the opportunity for humidity
reduction in the middle hatch period. A particular problem is to reduce
humidity In the Incubator sufficiently for the correct water conductivity
to occur when the external humidity is high.
Experiments have shown that most incubating waterfowl move their
eggs every half-hour. Our automatic incubators are similarly programmed
but controlled conditions have shown that bantam hens rarely turn their
eggs, if at all In pre-hatch incubators, eggs are hand-turned each time they
are monitored. When the chick turns in the egg, the egg is positioned with
the beak uppermost where it remains until hatching.
On setting, all eggs are marked on their air space end by species and
setting date. Incubation periods of the waterfowl species are constant and
known and provide a useful guide to pipping dates. Eggs may be airholed
after turning or carefully fractured during incubation to ensure eggshell
conductivity allows correct water loss. Abrasing the shell of over moist
eggs has also been undertaken with apparent success. An experienced eye
can judge, to some degree, embryo condition at candling and all eggs in
Incubators are candled every day.
The bantams that we use are selected for their broody qualities and are
mainly a Silkie crossbreed. Poultry body temperature is a degree above
that of most waterfowl. Since it became known that avian tuberculosis
bacillii could be transmitted through eggshell pores by infected birds,
bantams are maintained only to two years old and regular T.B. tests are
carried out on all stock. The fungal disease aspergillosis can similarly be
transmitted through the shell pores and nest hygiene is important. Many
waterfowl, especially sea duck, are susceptible to this disease.
At pipping, or if an egg is artificially chipped, the time of chip is
recorded on the egg which is then transferred to the humid hatcher. Time
of chip is invaluable if the chick later needs artificial manipulation. Two
hatching incubators are used in a two- or three-day rotation in the high
season and are in turn cleaned, disinfected and fumigated with potassium
permanganate/formaldehyde. During the hatching process, various surgical
practices may be employed to ensure a successful hatch but these require
great operator experience and generally only become necessary through a
genetic failure or errors at some other stage of infection.
Generalisations could mislead, but an example of the Mandarin Duck
Abe galericulata serves to illustrate several points common to many water-
fowl species. The Mandarin is commonly bred in captivity and breeds
freely in the wild or a 'feral' state in England. An endangered species in
China, it now may be more abundant in Western Europe than in its native
land.

<bodyText confidence="0.991614095238095" page_id="56319854"  page_num="214" year="" vol="">
In the wild the fertility of Mandarin eggs will be high because of the
natural selection of healthy adult pairs. Losses during incubation from
predators or disturbance are small (10%) and it is almost certain that the
remaining eggs will hatch. The actual hatch rate is 89%.
When captive-laid Mandarin eggs are left unmanaged, the disturbance
risk is higher. Fertility may be as low as 50% and losses during incubation
increase. The hatch rate is only 29%. When wild-laid eggs and captive-laid
Mandarin eggs are managed in different ways, the factors affecting hatch-
ability vary. Managed wild-laid eggs are less likely to be lost by disturbance
under a bantam or in an incubator than under a foster duck. But losses
through poor incubation are heavier in an incubator than under the
foster duck. A combination of techniques seems to produce the highest
hatch rate.
Similarly, managed captive laid eggs have varying hatch rates dependent
on the incubation method employed. Here, however, losses during incuba-
tion are heavier as poor incubation increases losses of already weak em-
bryos and yolk infections become a significant loss factor. It is apparent,
however, that once the embryo is well developed, frequent monitoring in
an incubator increases hatchability by reducing the possibility of infec-
tions spreading and by increasing actual hatching by manipulation. A com-
bination of techniques again produces an improved hatch rate.

Thus a combination of incubation techniques produces the best
hatching of captive-laid waterfowl eggs. The comparatively low hatch-
ability of these eggs occurs mainly through poor egg production which
augments a subsequent deterioration in embryo development or embryo
deaths.
Further study could quickly improve incubation techniques and equip-
ment. More information is required on the natural onset of incubation, the
possibility that certain antibiotic secretions are transferred from an

Further a "safe" sterilisation process for eggs at varying stages of embryo

fowl eggs is at present based on traditional techniques and needs to be
more scientifically based and documented.

HAND-REARING A SCARLET IBIS
Eudocimus ruber
AT PADSTOW BIRD GARDENS, CORNWALL
By KEVIN EVANS
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.968331095238095" page_id="56319855"  page_num="215" year="" vol="">
Our colony of Scarlet Ibis comprised five individuals at the start of the
1983 breeding season. Several attempts ensued in which most of the eggs
were found smashed on the aviary floor. After one such attempt, when the
male was observed to knock two eggs out of a nest, immediate action
saved the third egg of the clutch. This was placed in an incubator set at
101 *F. The egg measured 63 mm x 37 mm and was greyish-green, covered
in chocolate-coloured spots and smears. Incubation lasted for 23 days and
for the last 24 hours the chick became very vocal. Indeed, he was clearly
audible in the next room.
The Ibis chick was covered in a thick black down which, when a drop
of food was accidentally spilled on his back, was seen to have certain
water repellent qualities, as some ran off. His bill was approximately 2 Vi cm
long and was pink in colour with a black tip; by the age of three weeks he
had three pink and three black stripes down his bill.
The Ibis started to call and gape for food at about 10 hours after
hatching. Slight pressure from two fingers on either side of its bill resulted
in it pushing up between them, gaping vigourously without which he
would not respond. The rearing food for the Ibis was made up in bulk,
enough to last two days, and was kept refrigerated. Small amounts, i.e.
6 ml, were taken out each feed time and warmed slightly to take away the
chill. The Scarlet Ibis rearing diet consisted of the following:-

K. EVANS - SCARLET IBIS
30 large snails
1 handful of mealworms
1 handful of ant eggs, crickets, moths and any other available insects
2 calcium lactate tablets, crushed finely
1 teaspoon of Vionate - multi-vitamin powder
2 tablespoons of cold water
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.998816457142857" page_id="56319856"  page_num="216" year="" vol="">
The snails were shelled, and the flesh washed in cold water. All the
ingredients were liquidised in a blender for about 30 seconds. The result-
ing soup was then forced through a fine wire mesh sieve to remove any
fragments of shell that would otherwise block the feeding syringe. A
6 ml syringe was used, to which was attached a small piece of soft rubber
tubing, about 5 cm long, to lessen the risk of damaging the chick's bill or
getting some of the mixture into its wind pipe.
At first, 3-4 ml of this mixture every hour was enough to silence his
incessant calling.
The temperature in the incubator was gradually reduced by a degree
or so daily until there were no signs of the chick overheating, i.e. panting
or restlessness. The ideal temperature seemed to be 85*F, indeed at 83*F
he began to shake and seemed lethargic and the temperature was imme-
diately restored to 85*F. The chick was placed in a cardboard box meas-
uring 5 cmx 15 cmx 10 cm, inside the incubator. The box was lined with
limpet shells which gave the chick's feet a good grip and helped to stop
them from splaying.
At four days old he could support his body off the ground for a
couple of seconds at a time. This he would do dozens of times a day,
strengthening his legs and sometimes pecking his feet and preening his
underside.
By six days old he had begun to shuffle about on his legs so his box was
changed for one which was twice as long, to give him more room. It was at
this stage of his development that we noticed his legs and feet were begin-
ning to change colour from a pale pink to a greyish black. This process took
about two weeks to complete.
After the first week he began to get more and more adventurous, often
being found out of his box when checked.
Black and white feathers started emerging to replace the black down.
His wings and rump began ta swell with the developing feathers under the
skin. Once they emerged, they began to grow tremendously fast - nearly
6 mm a day. By three weeks old he was completely feathered.
At two weeks old, the chick was getting too tall for the brooder and so
the brooder temperature was gradually reduced to room temperature,
when the chick was removed to a large cardboard box, lined with news-

paper and provided with perches of varying sizes which were firmly
attached to the inside. He soon settled down and began to exercise his
wings.
As the Ibis grew, his diet was altered slightly to make it lumpy and con-
tain more roughage. Ox heart, day-old chicks and mackerel were added
to the mixture described earlier, but this was now liquidised for only ten
seconds. The syringe was replaced with a plastic meat baster which en-
abled us to feed the thicker mixture.
Considering that the young Ibis had only had contact with humans, he
was very shy and retiring, and usually preferred hiding in a quiet corner
with his head tucked between his legs. When the Ibis was placed in an
outdoor aviary with a hand-reared touraco, his temperament changed
immediately. He would clamber about the aviary, jumping from perches
and It was not long before he was flying perfectly.
Occasionally the two young birds would squabble, the touraco usually
coming off the better, but these confrontations never became serious
enough to warrant the removal of one or the other and so they were left
together for two months. Then the Ibis was introduced to our group of
five Scarlet Ibis; on no occasion did the adults show any hostility towards
him and he soon became totally independent of us.
At five months old the young Ibis was fully grown, but his plumage will
remain black and white for nearly two years before moulting out into the
vivid scarlet hues of this species.
In Volume 88, No. 2, of the Avicultural Magazine , Dr. G. Wennrich
describes the sunbathing behaviour of five species of ibis (not including
Scarlet Ibis) kept at the Walsrode Bird Park, West Germany. Our group
has not been seen sunbathing but our hand-reared bird does so frequently,
his neck stretched out, feathers erect, his head turned to one side with
his bill open, and both wings stretched out horizontally. This posture is
maintained for anything up to three minutes. His favoured location for
sunbathing is in his pool but occasionally he has been seen sunbathing on
grass.

RECORDS OF WATERFOWL BRED IN CAPTIVITY
IN THE BRITISH ISLES
By DAVID COLES (Ascot, Berkshire)

Waterfowl have a long tradition as avicultural subjects and probably
constitute one of the first groups to attract the attentions of the specialist.
As waterfowl have been bred in British collections for many years and
early documentation seems sparse, no claim is made in compiling these
records that they constitute first breedings for the species concerned, al-
though in many instances they are likely to be just that.
Each entry is the earliest reference that I could trace relating to that
species but because of the time factor involved and lack of access to much
of the early specialist literature, it is only a tentative list and undoubtedly
in need of much revision by someone more waterfowl-orientated than
myself. Therefore, if members can update any of the references or suggest
relevant early literature worthy of study, I would be grateful if they could
contact me at Windsor Forest Stud, Mill Ride, Ascot, Berkshire.
References relate to either parent-reared or artificially incubated,
captive-laid eggs, not those taken from the wild.

HAND-REARING OSTRICHES Struthio cam elm
AT THE PHOENIX ZOO (Arizona, USA)

Included in the Phoenix Zoo collection is a compatible pair of Ostriches.
Their present enclosure is small (55 ft x 100 ft) but within three years,
their new exhibit, a spacious multi-species African Veldt, should be
completed. Because of the size of their present exhibit and their inability
to find safe refuge from the public, they have never successfully incubated
their eggs, many of which, if left in the enclosure, are broken. Therefore,
in the past three years that I have worked with the Ostriches, we have
incubated the eggs artificially and hand-reared the young.
The eggs are collected as soon as they are laid, usually every other day,
and stored at 55*F for seven days. All eggs collected within that time,
usually two or three, are incubated together. This allows the chicks to
communicate and encourage one another at hatching time. It also results
in hatchlings of the same age which makes it easier for them to learn to
eat and provides valuable socialising companionship.
We incubate the eggs in our ratite incubator at 97.5*F and a relative
humidity of 50%. The incubation period is 40-42 days. In past years we
found that very few fertile eggs actually hatched. There are several possi-
bilities as to why an Ostrich chick fails to hatch:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.770678714285714" page_id="56319869"  page_num="229" year="" vol="">
1 . Phoenix's hard water produces extra hard shells.
2. The adults lack a mineral found either in their food or in the local
soil, and this produces weak chicks.
3. Vocalisation by adults, which may encourage the chicks to hatch, is
absent.
4. The adults may actually assist hatching by cracking the shell.
5. Just before pipping, the adults may raise their incubating temperature,
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.7863385" page_id="56319869"  page_num="229" year="" vol="">
thus stimulating hatching.
6 . Chicks are too weak to survive and are not meant to hatch.
In 1982 I decided to open the eggs manually in an attempt to increase
our hatchings. The following is an account of the 16 eggs worked with.

point to start opening eggs and to give the egg an opportunity to hatch
on its own. The chick was alive until the late afternoon of the pre-

vious day. One can tell if the chick is alive by listening with a stetho-
scope or by holding the egg in the hand for a time, because it will
move. Always handle the egg with a cloth to prevent hand-oils from
getting into the shell. When I opened this egg, I found the head
at the end of the egg opposite the air sac. The neck was swollen to
three times its normal size, possibly from the struggle to break out.
The yolk was not totally absorbed.

an incubator by placing a heating pad above and below the egg in a
styrofoam box and carried the egg home with me. I also placed a
lightly dampened towel over the air sac end but not covering the
hole I had made. It was interesting to discover that the chick was very
vocal at this stage. Vocalising by return seemed to excite the chick
and cause it to kick and try harder to break out. The chick gradually
positioned its beak at the hole I had made. I continued to vocalise to
the chick about once an hour until I retired for the night at which
time I moved the box into the bedroom. At 3.00 a.m. I was awakened
by loud vocalisations coming from the chick. The chick had broken
away the top third of the shell, and I picked away the remaining shell
which was completely dry. This chick lived until IVi weeks old when
it died of a congenital heart problem.

breaking the dry parts of its shell away myself. I continued this all
day until by 6.00 p.m. the chick was out. There was unabsorbed yolk
at the bottom of the egg, but its body appeared to be normal. (The

air sac end. The egg was placed in the heating pad incubator and taken
home. The chick made no vocalisations, though it was breathing.
Nothing ever happened, and I was at a loss as to what to do as the
shell never dried out, so I could not peel it away. On Day 43 the chick
was dead. I opened the egg and the chick had a cord seemingly made
of the egg yolk wrapped around its neck, so I assume it strangled. It
also had unabsorbed yolk inside its body.
It must be kept in mind that I have no way of knowing if the chicks
that hatched would have hatched anyway without my help. Nonetheless,
my experience this year led me to some theories which I would like to
continue to investigate in following years. It seems that the head is at the
end of the egg opposite the air sac until approximately the last day before
pipping. Perhaps the act of turning the head to the air sac end and the
struggling and kicking involved uses up most of the remaining egg yolk.
This struggle is probably essential. Then, as the chick continues to work
his way out (head in position), the remaining yolk is absorbed. This last
struggle is still critical, though not as much so as the struggle to turn the
head around. Each chick seems to use a different method to break out. I

think that each chick must be given time and patience to help it in its own
way. Vocalising to the chicks is essential, as it very definitely excites them.
It might be beneficial to be able to leave the hatching chick in the incuba-
tor with the other eggs as quite possibly they would be stimulated by
experiencing the entire process. This might lessen the incubation period of
some eggs, however, so when to open the eggs should remain flexible. I am
looking forward to next year with hopes that every fully developed chick
will be saved.

I have often admired waders in the various public and private collec-
tions that cater for these delightful birds, but have never had really suit-
able accommodation for the group in my own aviaries. Consequently, my
practical experience of the Charadriiformes is largely confined to a few
months' caring for an injured Curlew some ten years ago.
One mid-June afternoon in 1973, I was birdwatching on an estuary in
Suffolk where few birds were in evidence apart from odd family parties of

Shelduck. Suddenly a Curlew leapt up at my feet with the peculiar rasping
squawk that this species reserves for moments of extreme terror, and made
off at speed across the salt marsh. Its terrestrial, rather than aerial mode of
progression, combined with a dragging wing tip, proclaimed that here was
an injured bird in need of care and attention. I caught it with some diffi-
culty, losing my binoculars in the chase; placed on the ground for safety,
they proved impossible to relocate after I had secured the bird, and were
presumably claimed by the next high tide.
On arriving home, the Curlew was placed in a small outside aviary some
10 ft long x 6 ft wide, already housing an assortment of native and foreign
Passerine species and a few doves. The wader was left there overnight with
a large shallow pan of water containing several earthworms of varying sizes.
The following morning these had disappeared, so I continued to feed the
bird in this fashion for several days. However, this aviary was some dis-
tance from the house, and consequently the Curlew became agitated on
the rare occasions that it saw anyone - usually myself with the daily pan of
worms. At such times it would walk up and down the far side of the
aviary, sticking its beak through the Vzin wire netting - this caused an un-
pleasant raw patch to develop halfway along that organ.
In view of the Curlew's nervousness, and the damage done to its beak,
I removed the bird to a larger aviary nearer the house, which had solid
sides for the first 18 in from the ground. Here it was unable to injure
its beak further, and soon became completely steady, as people&amp;apos;were con-
stantly passing the aviary. This enclosure already housed a pair of Lady
Amherst's Pheasants, who appeared not to object to their new companion.
Within a fortnight of moving the Curlew, the damaged beak had healed
completely, and it was feeding readily on chunks of canned dog food and
wholemeal bread, with only an occasional earthworm. The changeover
from live food had been made very gradually until all food items were
taken dry from a dish. It moulted successfully on this regime in the course
of the summer, and kept in excellent feather, bathing freely in a plastic
washing up bowl placed in the aviary for the purpose. The characteristic
call was often to be heard, especially on clear moonlit nights. The bird
now bore little resemblance to the emaciated creature I had found in June.
However, its wing injury was sufficiently severe to preclude a return to the
wild, and at the time I was unable to provide suitable permanent wader
accommodation. Late in the autumn, therefore, I passed the now com-
pletely tame Curlew on to a fellow aviculturist who had extensive facili-
ties for this type of bird.

By PETER J. BLOOMFIELD (Assistant Curator of Birds)
The last year has seen the arrival of several new and interesting species
at Chester Zoo. The most notable newcomers are two pairs of Lesser Vasa
Parrots Coracopsis nigra which were obtained from the private collection
of Mr. Werner Eichelberger in Switzerland. We are grateful to Mrs. Marie
Louise Wenner, Curator of Birds at Naples Zoo, and to Mr. Mario Albek
who kindly acted as translator, for their help in obtaining these parrots.
The birds arrived in England on 30th July 1982 and after completing
quarantine were housed in an aviary measuring 50 ft x 20 ft x 10 ft which
had been specially built for them. This aviary was carefully sited so as to
give the birds as much privacy as possible, with public viewing only from
one end which was itself protected by a 6 ft wide shrubbery. Indoor
quarters were provided by a large shed adjoining the aviary.
Unfortunately three weeks after introducing the birds into the aviary
we lost one of the males to a Stoat. The remaining three birds were left
in the aviary throughout the winter and proved to be very hardy, not
using the inside quarters provided for them.
Early in 1983, nesting boxes, consisting of one grandfather clock-type
and a small barrel on a supporting pole with a top entrance, were provided
for the Vasas. Both boxes were instantly inspected by the two females
together but no eggs were laid. Although it was perhaps too much to
expect them to breed in their first season here, we are hopeful for the
future, especially as we are now in the process of importing three more
Lesser Vasa Parrots from Mr. Eichelberger, which will give us three pairs
of these extremely interesting birds. In 1984 we plan to split the six birds
into individual pairs. For the information of those readers who know
Chester Zoo, the birds will be housed in the Oakfield Aviaries which, if
necessary, can be fenced off to avoid disturbance should they go to nest.
Other new arrivals at Chester include nine Red-fronted Macaws Ara
rubrogenys] seven females were kindly placed at Chester Zoo by H.M.
Customs and Excise, and we are grateful to Jersey Zoo for the donation
of their two males. Further interzoo co-operation enabled us to acquire
a pair of Palm Cockatoos Proboscigaraterrimus and we hope to obtain a
second pair of these magnificent birds in the near future. A pair of Hawk-
headed Parrots Deroptyusaccipitrinus arrived from Birdland, Bourton-on-
the-Water. We were presented with a pair of Keas Nestor notabilis from
the Auckland Zoo, New Zealand. Other new arrivals include two pairs

The Oilbird Steatornis caripensis , a relative of the Nightjars, which uses
a type of echo-location to navigate to and from its feeding groups at
night time, is in danger of extinction in Bolivia because of exploitation of
its staple diet, dates. A concession was granted six years ago to harvest
date palm shoots for canning purposes. The harvesting causes a rapid
decline in palms and there has been no replanting. The Bolivian Wildlife
Society estimates that at least 10,000 US dollars is needed just to protect
one colony (Birds).

Amongst the many exotic softbills kept and bred at Winged World
during its existence was the Little Bee-eater Merops pusillus. The pair,
which ultimately bred, provided me with a fascinating introduction to
the behaviour of this elegant family of birds. One aspect noted was the
habit of both birds, periodically, while flying over their pool to drop to
the water and momentarily submerge themselves beneath the surface,
immediately rising again to continue their flight. A short note outlining
this water-diving behaviour is contributed by C.H. Fry in Ostrich, Vol. 54
No. 4, p. 244. Six species, namely the European M. apiaster, Blue-cheeked
M. superciliosus (persicus), Little M. pusillus , Little Green M. orientalis ,
Blue-throated M. viridis and Bay-headed M. leschenaulti Bee-eaters have
now been observed water-diving, the exact reason for which is unknown
but it is most likely to be in the main a cleansing process. However, evi-
dence of occasional fishing has been found by Fry who discovered fish
bones in regurgitated pellets from Blue-cheeked and Blue-breasted M. var-
iegatus Bee-eaters.

sadly the colony is believed only to number between 30-50.

After study of the Cape Verde and Madeiran populations of the Petrel
Pterodroma mollis Dr. W.R.P. Broome, in a recent issue of the bulletin of
the British Ornithologists' Club, advocates that the two races be regarded
as two separate species, the Gon-gonP. feae and the FreiraP. madeira with
the specific name mollis covering the distinct race from the southern
oceans. Both new species are vulnerable, with decreasing populations, and
P. madeira is considered to be down to a "few dozen pairs" ( British Birds).

Besides documenting the excellent work done with the Peregrine Fal-
con, The Peregrine Fund Newsletter also outlines the involvement of
Cornell University Faboratory of Ornithology staff with other projects.
Studies of species cover many countries, amongst which are the Philip-
pines, Mauritius, Iceland, Greece, Spain and several of the Middle East
countries. For their captive breeding programme a pair of nestling Orange-
breasted Falcon Falco deiroleucus , an illusive South American species, was
obtained in 1980 from Ecuador. When mature, it is hoped that these birds
will form a base for the formation of a viable captive population. It is
hoped that a detailed account of Cornell's involvement and success with
the Peregrine Falcon will be included in the A vicultural Magazine's special
issue on the role of aviculture in conservation, projected for the October/
December 1984 issue.

For those readers following Jeffrey Boswall's series of articles covering
tool-using in birds, the following extracts which appeared in the newsletter
of the Papua New Guinea Bird Society, July-August 1982, p. 29, should
prove of interest. The observations on 14th June 1982 by Brian Finch
centred on Sulphur-crested Cockatoos Cacatuagalerita using small branches
for intimidation
'Two Sulphur-crested Cockatoos were screeching away at two passive
Bat Hawks Machaerirhynchus alcinus sitting some three feet apart on a
lower branch .......whilst the Hawks refused to budge, and the cockatoos
kept their distance but continued their vocal harrassment, one of the
cockatoos flew to a branch some 12 ft directly above the limb on which
the Hawks perched. The bird then snapped off small twigs containing
several leaves and dropped them on to the Hawks with a sideways flick
of its head..1 thought it was an isolated incidence .......To my astonish-
ment it proceeded to rain leafy twiglets up to six inches in length .....After
a time the Hawks flew off pursued by the Cockatoo".

The Hawk Trust Newsheet for September 1983 gives details of the pro-
gress achieved by the Trust's project to try to establish the status of the
Bam Owl in Britain. Numbers of this beautiful bird have been in decline
during recent years and it is hoped that observations made by the Trust's
members will throw some light on the situation. About 2,000 reports of
sightings and breeding pairs were received during the year and these are
now being collated.

A natural phenomenon seems to have accounted for the disappearance
of 17 million birds of 18 species from the world's largest coral atoll,
Christmas Island. The birds are either thought to have left the area or per-
ished following the effects of El Nino, the warm Pacific current which
once every seven to fourteen years displaces the cold, nutrient-rich Hum-
boldt current from the Antarctic, thus affecting the food on which the
birds live, the Anchovy. The El Nino of 1965 accounted for the lives of
some 27 million seabirds (BBC Wildlife).

Mats Tell writes about the 1983 breeding season in Sweden: "We again
enjoyed a dry, hot summer and consequently most aviculturists were
successful. For instance, no less than five species of cockatoo were bred
(Galah, Goffin's, Major Mitchell, Umbrella and Triton), as were two
species of Mousebirds (Blue-naped and Speckled) and some rarely-bred
gamebirds - Satyr Tragopan, Elliott's Pheasant, Capercaillie and Blackcock.
"My own birds produced the following: Californian Quail - 3, Sun
Conure - 3, Bourke's Parrakeet - 14 and Bluish Seed-eater - 1.
" A pair of Crimson-crowned Bishops Euplectes hordeacea nested for
the first time, but the single chick that hatched was thrown out of the
nest when only five days old. A pair of Zosterops nested three times but
their eggs were infertile, as were those of Mesia, Black and Golden-breasted
Buntings."

Finches and Allied Species - Doves, Quail and Hemipodes
By Jeffrey Trollope. Published by Blandford Press. 336 pages, 50 colour
photographs, some line drawings.
Price: UK#9.95;USA 17.95 dollars; Canada 22.95 dollars
I write this review with the advantage of being closely acquainted with
the author's ideas regarding the keeping of small seed-eaters and having
observed his methods and witnessed several of his breeding successes. The
latter includes five first breedings in Britain, for which he was awarded
Avicultural Society medals. His most recent success, an account of which
has still to be published in the Magazine, is likely to prove yet another
first breeding. He brings to this book over 30 years' experience of bird-
keeping.
After the Introduction, Part One, titled General Care, has chapters
headed: Accommodation; Nutrition and Food; Obtaining Stock and
Management; Breeding. Within these four headings, the coverage is very
comprehensive. An idea of this can be gained from some of the sub-
headings, eg., Planning an Aviary; Cage and Aviary Furniture; Plant Foods;
Live Food; Collected Live Food; Buying Birds; Rodent Control; Record
Keeping and Ringing; Catching and Handling; Sickness and Health; Pair
Formation; Breeding Stimulus.
Part Two, Descriptions of Species and their Maintenance, accounts for
approximately three-quarters of the book. All of the main groups of
foreign seed-eaters (British species have been omitted) are included and a
large number of species. With some exceptions, Jeff Trollope concentrates
on species which he has kept, many of which have nested in his aviaries,
and a good deal of the information and data relates to his own experience.
He writes informatively about each group and species. First are given the
English name, scientific name, other English names if any are applicable,
and then for many of the species he provides some general information
before writing about the species under the headings: Description; Dis-
tribution and Habitat; Breeding; Voice; Behaviour.
The style is similar to that which he uses when writing for this Maga-
zine. The advice is sound and practical, and there is a large amount of
highly useful and reliable information.
The colour photographs show 49 species and are of a good standard.
Approximately half of them are included in a popular handbook from
the same publisher and will be familiar to many members. Twenty-three
of the photographs were taken by the author and show his own birds.

BEIJA-FLORES DO ESTADO DO ESPIRITO SANTO
HUMMINGBIRDS OF THE STATE OF ESPIRITO SANTO
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993624897435897" page_id="56319882"  page_num="242" year="" vol="">
By Augusto Ruschi, illustrations by Etienne Demonte.
Approx. #72. Available from Wheldon &amp; Wesley Ltd., Hitchin, Herts.
So few books are devoted solely to hummingbirds that any new publi-
cation is eagerly awaited by enthusiasts such as I. Although the book re-
viewed was published in 1982, it has only recently (October 1983) become
available in the U.K.
The book is large format (1414 in x 11 in) and comes in a somewhat
flimsy cardboard slipcase, which is no doubt meant to be discarded.
There are 263 pages including 29 full-page colour plates.
The text is in Portuguese and English: from pages 1-96 the text in
Portuguese occupies the top half of the page, with the English text on the
lower half. The remaining pages have the Portuguese and English text
running parallel down the page.
The first section of the book (which proves excellent and informative
reading) is taken up with an introduction, followed by a description of the
physiographic characteristics of the State of Espirito Santo, the bird life
of the area, also a detailed anatomy of a hummingbird.
The main section of the book describes the species and subspecies of
hummingbirds found in the State of Espirito Santo, Brazil. Although this
section is fairly detailed, giving scientific names, plus vernacular names,
in both Portuguese and English; also characteristics, habitat, migration and
behaviour such as nesting, bathing, song, courtship, etc., I feel that with
some species certain aspects have been somewhat generalised and many
details known and described by ornithologists and aviculturists have been
omitted.
For example no mention is made of singing leks in Phaethornis ; also,
too often the author describes the sexes of certain species as "almost iden-
tical", when, from experience with captive birds, it is known that the
sexes can be determined if not by plumage differences, then by length of
beak and/or tail.
As only the males of four hummingbird species are known to have an
eclipse plumage (two of which are found in the area covered by the book),
it would have proved worthwhile to have given precise details of this
phenomenon. However, the author gives only a brief and inaccurate des-
cription of this plumage phase in Heliomaster squamosus. The male does
not "become like the female in appearance"(p. 255), but retains the dark
green of the underparts. Also, the crown becomes dull grey; in the female
it is bronzy green. No mention is made of the eclipse plumage phase in the
male Calliphlox amethystina.

It is well known that female hummingbirds, completely independent of
the male, build the nest, incubate and rear the young. Ruschi mentions
this for each species/subspecies. Surely to exclude such repetition, men-
tion could have been made under the subheading Laying, incubation and
sequences(p. 71)?
It is obvious that the original text was in Portuguese and it is unfortun-
ate that the English translation is not entirely correct. Certain mistakes can
lead to confusion; indeed, certain words proved meaningless to me until I
studied the Portuguese text from which I was able to decipher the true
meaning.
There are a number of printing errors (a particularly confusing one
appearing on p. 141). However, these seem to appear only in the English
text and if one studies the Portuguese, it is possible to make out what is
really meant.
All the species/subspecies described are illustrated in full colour. The
birds are depicted life size and in most cases, both male and female, also
the nest and chicks are shown. The plates are superb, although, no doubt
due to the printing, some species/subspecies appear a little darker in
colour than in real life.
Due to the high price, the book will no doubt appeal only to those
seriously interested in the Trochilidae (and maybe to book collectors?).
Because of this, I feel that certain aspects could have been dealt with in
a more thorough manner. However, the book is most attractive and well
produced and will no doubt find its way into the libraries of all who are
interested in these birds.

PARROT PRODUCTION: Incorporating Incubation
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.987983961538462" page_id="56319884"  page_num="244" year="" vol="">
By John and Pat Stoodley. Bezels Publications Ltd. 108 pages
42 coloured plates and numerous black and white sketches. Price:#15.95
Both authors are well-known for their achievements in Psittacine avi-
culture and pioneering ideas on parrot diets, and they have combined to
produce a volume which is a must for all serious aviculturists specialising
in parrots. It is based, for the most part, on the personal experiences of the
authors, and the soundness of its contents is a reflection on their pheno-
menal success with members of the genera Amazona and Pionus.
This very readable book is divided into a number of short chapters
covering: importation and quarantine, caged birds; aviary design; security;
predators; nest-boxes; diet; pairing and breeding;hand-rearing, incubation;
hatching; disinfecting, and it finishes with a section covering useful infor-
mation - addresses of societies and material suppliers, also egg problems
and possible causes are listed. Andrew Greenwood, MRCVS, contributes a
section on medicine and diseases.
All the chapters contain a wealth of practical information for the
breeder, especially the section covering diet, which is perhaps the most
stimulating part of the book. The Stoodleys have abandoned the conven-
tional sunflower diet, turning instead to fruit, vegetables and pulses. I
found the information on pulses a little sparse; more details on sprouting
and types of plants used would have been worthy of inclusion as these
obviously constitute an important part of psittacine diets.
The forty or so coloured photographs are of a high standard as are the
line drawings depicting selected subjects. All in all, a very worthy and
useful addition to parrot literature and thoroughly recommended.

Sexing the Siy Parrot
In your recent publication, Volume 89, No. 1, 1983, on page 27 there
appeared an article on a nesting of the Siy Parrot Pionus maximiliani siy.
In describing the three youngsters, the author, Mr. Mats Tell of Swe-
den, wrote: "All three had brick red frontal bands, thus indicating their
sex - females".
Only in the interest of saving other breeders the mistake of retaining
one such as a definite female, I would like to point out that this statement
is not infallible.
Just this spring, Mrs. Betty Byers of Lower California hatched three
also. She has reared a number of clutches of this species. To quote Mrs
Byers: "All three had red or red/orange frontal areas. I kept the dullest
and the brightest, hoping for male and female. Both chicks were sexed at
12 weeks old and both proved to be males."
This clutch was obtained with a loaned bird from the San Diego Zoo,
California, so rest assured that the sexing was competently done.
Your readers might also be interested to know that Sven Lennartsson
of Rimforsa, Sweden, is producing the Siy with much success.

By BRYAN and ANNE PECK (Cheltenham)
Very little has appeared to date in avicultural literature on the ten
species of Spiderhunters which make up the genus Arachnothera. Gener-
ally grouped with the Sunbirds in the family Nectariniidae, they do,
however, differ in several respects from the true Sunbirds by lacking
metallic coloured areas of plumage in the male, having no noticeable
dimorphism between the sexes (in most cases) and the different, often
unique nest structure, characteristics which would make them strong
candidates for family status in their own right. Their distribution is
throughout South-east Asia and some of the Indonesian and Philippine
islands.
Classification of species within the genus depends on the author.
Gruson (1976) lists them in alphabetical order but for the purpose of
this article, which concerns avicultural experiences, the order of sequence
is based on diet, display and behaviour. It must be noted, however, that
some species have yet to become available to the aviculturist. An asterisk

B. and A. PECK - SPIDERHUNTERS
A. chrysogenys and A. flavigaster are commonly called the Lesser
Yellow-eared and Greater Yellow-eared Spiderhunters respectively by
aviculturists but as this tends to indicate a close relationship, we have
used Yellow-eared and Spectacled as, apart from the visual, there are no
close ties.

Importation
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.966792875" page_id="56319910"  page_num="2" year="" vol="">
Before quarantine, Spiderhunters were imported into Britain in large
numbers, most of which arrived in very bad condition. The main problems
were two-fold - bad feet and Candida fungus in the mouth regions. These
days, only one importer brings them into Britain with any regularity and
those that have been released from quarantine have mostly been in superb
condition, although a few have had poor feet, due mainly to the way in
which they were trapped. Fungus is now a problem of the past as it can
easily be treated with Nystan lightly dabbed on the infected areas twice a
day. Diet, which is dicusssed next, and seclusion are the main priorities
with newly imported birds. All but two species have been imported since
quarantine restrictions were imposed, and of these the Grey-breasted and
Spectacled are the most numerous.
Diet
In captivity the bulk of the diet must be made up of a good quality
nectar mix. There are many such mixtures that can be used and the follow-
ing has proved very successful with us over the last few years :-
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.834297625">
50 gr. white sugar
5 mgr. activated dried yeast
5 mgr. plant pollen
These ingredients are made into a paste and diluted with 500 ml of
boiling water and allowed to cool. The following are then added:
20 mgr. spoon of Min amino
2Vi mgr. Becosym "B" group structure
2Vi mgr. fresh minced beef
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.998816833333333" page_id="56319910"  page_num="2" year="" vol="">
It has been found that Spiderhunters make better use of their nectar
if fed from an open dish on the floor of the cage rather than fed from
the more conventional type of water hopper. We use a 3 inch diameter
earthenware dish as it is a good size for one bird's food and the fruit and
cake, fed with the nectar, can easily be picked out. Fruit, which is added
to the nectar, must be finely dried. A variety is accepted including

apple, grape, banana, tomato, and elderberries and red and black currants
when in season. Carrot is also taken. It must be diced very small for the
smaller members, but can be 14 inch cubes for the larger species. We have
experimented with an electric blender to combine fruit and nectar but
this makes it into a paste which our Spiderhunters will not take. We also
feed separately brown bread and milk sweetened with a little sugar.
A fine grade softfood can also be offered but with what is already
provided, it should not be needed but does provide variety if taken. The
addition of a mineral supplement such as SA37 or Stress will provide
most of the extra minerals and Adexolin will do the same with the vita-
mins. Both are best added to the nectar rather than the bread and milk.
Extra calcium can be provided in the form of cuttlefish "bone", scraped
to a powder and sprinkled over the nectar. We also add Orlusc insectile
mix and dried insects on alternate days with the fruit.
Insects are essential for longevity and must be as varied as possible
and take the form of blowflies, fruit flies, spiders, crickets, first and
second instar locusts, small moths and butterflies; in fact, any soft bodied
insect that is available. Some types must be persevered with even though
the birds may take some time before they become accustomed to them.
The first Spiderhunter I kept in the 1960's was A chrysogenys and he
was fed about 20 Wolf Spiders daily. He lived for five years, eventually
dying from a form of stroke. Now, 15 years later, I rarely feed spiders,
preferring crickets and first and second instar locusts. One or two a month
are given per bird and then only as a tid-bit. We find this is ample and
there is little doubt that they could do without spiders altogether - but
we find that it has become a habit of ours while in the garden to catch
any spiders seen.
Housing
With a group of birds that have not been bred in captivity, how to
house them for optimum success is purely speculative. It is known that
they can be kept for periods of five years or so in both cage and aviary.
Cages are most important during the first year of captive life as they
enable birds to be acclimatised and fully established. They should be of
the box type, at least a metre long by half a metre high, with depth the
same. Perching is most important as Spiderhunters are hygiene conscious
wiping their beaks on the perch to remove food that has adhered to the
beak after each feed. Therefore, two sets are kept and changed daily.
Perches should be of soft wood or natural twigs. We prefer soft wood
dowl, redwood, spruce, deal or birch. Soft wood holds its moisture for
longer periods; natural twigs dry out very quickly. Apple, pear and
elder can become hard in a matter of weeks, whereas soft wood can be

soaked when dry. It has been found that soft wood leads to fewer foot
troubles.
A box type cage will decrease the initial stress period because the
bird can find seclusion and should settle quickly if not disturbed more
than necessary. Needless to say, only one bird per cage cuts out com-
petition for food and roosting positions. This type of accommodation
is also important if specimens need medication.
After the first moult, an aviary is more in line with today's thoughts
and a small tropical house to one pair of Spiderhunters would be ideal.
An outside flight could be utilised during summer months and readers
are requested to refer to Mr. R. Elgar's notes on Humming Bird manage-
ment in a previous issue of this Magazine (Volume 88, No. 4) as the sugges-
tions put forward by him can be applied equally to Spiderhunters.
Spiderhunters, as stated previously, have not bred in captivity and
for them to have a chance, the provision of large-leaved plants is essen-
tial. The nest structure of various species is divided into three types:
open cup suspended from a leaf; two leaves stitched together; and a
tunnel type nest stitched to the underside of a leaf. Material for con-
struction must be as varied as possible but the availability of masses of
cobwebs is important as without this a nest will doubtfully progress
very far.
The species of plants able to support this type of nest that are
available to the aviculturist are limited but three which are available
and can be tried are the Cheese Plant, Rubber Plant and Banana. The
latter plays host to nests of some species in the wild and the provision
of several of the dwarf varieties would perhaps give the best chance of
success. The related Sunbirds have been known to accept an artificial
structure, usually a box, so the provision of an artificial nest, a long
wicker tunnel supported beneath a large leaf, may coax them into nest-
ing. Such a tunnel would probably have to be home made.
All the large Spiderhunters have parts of the day which are filled
with high activity. This does not seem to be so with A. longirostris and
A. crassirostris.
Little Spiderhunter Arachnothera longirostris
Range: India to South West China, south to the Philippines, west to
Malaya and most of the islands within this rectangle. Twelve subspecies
are recognised.
Habitat: Reputed to be a common species inhabiting secondary forest
growth, cultivated gardens and areas where wild bananas grow, and is said
to play an important part in their pollination.
Description: Size 6Vi inches. Upper parts, from head to base of tail,

slate grey tinged with green; tail lighter tipped with off-white. Upper
breast and throat grey-white, belly and undertail coverts yellow. Eyebrow
stripe grey, white below. Bill dark blue grey (blackish), the lower mandible
lighter. Eye dark brown. Feet blue grey. Both sexes have pectoral tufts
which are only visible when roosting or in the male when displaying. Those
of the male are orange-yellow and females are yellow. Adults lose all
yellow and green in captivity, except for pectoral tufts which become
lighter. Differs from A. crassirostris by feet, facial markings and thinner
bill. Immatures have a paler eye stripe and throat tinged yellowish olive.
Comments: Having owned the nominate race and several of the sub-
species, there is very little between them. Like the Thick-billed Spider-
hunter, it is difficult to establish, mainly because both are very insecti-
vorous, and not nearly so inquisitive as larger members of the genus. There
is some difference in the size of birds imported from different areas, but
most are heavier than crassirostris.
They travel badly, with very few living long in captivity and generally
are not nearly as robust as the larger Arachnothera. Insects, especially fruit
flies, are vital and in this respect they are like the Asiatic Sunbirds. With
a great deal of patience they can be induced to take large spiders, crickets
and first and second instar locusts.
The moult seems to take a greater toll on A longirostris due mainly to
the fact that they are reluctant to sample more diverse food. It is also a
species of a nervous disposition- we have had a female for three years that
is still quite flighty, which would indicate strong flight reflexes.
A. longirostris in general is an early rooster and also very selective about
the roosting perch. They have the ability to hover in the manner of some
sunbirds. They can be kept in small groups, the pair bond apparently being
very strong in this species.
The Little Spiderhunter has a peculiar bathing routine: it enters the
water backwards, washing its tail and vent first. I have heard of other birds
bathing in this way but never witnessed it before. All individuals of this
species that we have owned have bathed in an identical way.
Thick-billed Spiderhunter Arachnothera crassirostris
Range: Southern Thailand, Malaysia, Sumatra and Borneo. No sub-
species.
Habitat: A rare species of lowland forests and secondary growth up to
4,000 feet.
Description: Size 6 V 2 inches. One of the smallest species in overall length
and certainly the lightest in body weight. Crown, nape, back, wings and
tail dark grey; tail tipped as in longirostris. Upper tail and belly light yellow,
upper breast and throat grey. Eyebrow light grey with the dark grey eye

stripe stretching to nape. Most field guides indicate that pectoral tufts are
present only in the male, but we believe this to be incorrect as birds that
we have owned have displayed to each other and on roosting both exhibi-
ted pectoral tufts which, when held in the hand, are difficult to find. Bill
brown with dark flesh coloured feet.
Comments: One of the most delicate of the genus to establish and even
then they require special foods and much attention. Establishing is made
all the more difficult because of their shyness and very few learn to take
food from the hand. Time is a strong factor as most die within 18 months
of importation, usually from heart, liver or blood disorders. Post mortem
examinations of dead birds reveal liver and heart discoloration, due we
think to a greatly over-rich diet. Once tame they should be induced to a
diet of more fruit and less of a sugar diet. We have had several but they
seldom live more than two years.
This species is seldom imported because of its rare status in the whole
of its range. It does not stand the inclement weather of Britain very well
and if housed outside, quarters should be heated to around 55*F at night.
One egg laid on floor of cage was small in size - 10 mm - and was white,
lightly speckled with mauve at the blunt end.
Naked-faced Spiderhunter Arachnothera clarae
Range: Philippines and its many islands.
Habitat: A bird of lowland jungle and ravines near water.
Description: Crown, nape and upperparts, including tail and secon-
daries, olive-brown; primaries old gold; feet flesh coloured with scales
edged brown; toe nails dark; eye brown; bill black; naked skin on both
sides of face below eye. Breast grey, but feathers give a two-tone effect as
one side of breast feathers is a darker grey. No pectoral tufts, but distinct
gold shoulder patches which could be a sex difference. These are a distinc-
tive field character. Dupont describes the body colour as green, but the
subspecies we own, Ac. luzonensis, is as above.
Comments: Hardy in cool temperatures but would not stand our win-
ter conditions. Very tame even when first imported and mixes well with
other birds although it will not tolerate other spiderhunters. Has a great
liking for newly-hatched stick insects and spiders.

Head study of Arachnothera chrysogenys, showing eye ring and ear patch
patch (not connected). Yellowish on the throat; forehead streaked; bill
brown, lighter below; eye light brown; feet flesh coloured. Immature are
duller and lacking streaked forehead; some have reduced ear patch and eye
ring or it is lacking completely.
Comments: This species is not over-aggressive when two or more are
kept together, but must be watched as they can at times turn spiteful.
When they do fight, they tend to strike for the eyes and head region.
Insectivorous, especially spiders of all sizes, even very large garden spi-
ders. Will tame very quickly if tempted with spiders; all those we have
kept have done so.
Grey-breasted Spiderhunter Arachnothera affinis
Range: Thailand, Malaya through to the Greater Sunda Islands.
Habitat: Forest secondary growth near flowering banana. Locally
common over most of its range up to 3,500 ft.
Description: Upperparts olive-green with darker streaks on throat and
forehead. Olive-grey beneath becoming much paler at vent and underside
of tail. Primaries and tail dark grey with tail bands occasionally present.
Pectoral tufts are light in colour although some carry more yellow than
others. Bill brown but tip and underside a lighter shade; feet pink tinged
and eye colour varies from light to dark brown. Length 7 in (18 cm) but
the Malay race A a. modesta is smaller.
Comments: Not aggressive and can be kept in small groups. Although
two males will occasionally "sham up" to each other, it rarely develops

beyond this. General habits are more like the larger sunbirds. Not as in-
quisitive as other members of this group, it is more insectivorous than
the larger species, taking flies, spiders, crickets and first instar locusts but
it has trouble with larger insects. Nest not described, but in captivity has
built in a finch nest-box. Often misnamed by dealers as it can be mis-
taken for A robusta and A. everetti.
Long-billed Spiderhunter Arachnothera robusta
Range: Sumatra, Borneo, Malaya and Thailand.
Habitat: Forest secondary growth up to 4,500 ft.
Description:Olive green on back, wings and tail; breast and belly
lighter, lightly streaked and tinged yellow on centre of breast and belly.
Very small area of naked skin around eye; beak dark brown, horn-
coloured underneath, about 10 mm thick at base and 50 mm in length.
Wing shoulders bright yellow. Each tail feather is tipped with a white spot
giving the impression of a band. Pectoral tufts are yellow in the hen and
orange in the male. Length approximately SVz in (21.5 cm).
Comments: Very aggressive and difficult to keep two together. Both
sexes show pectoral tufts when displaying and when roosting. Once estab-
lished, quite easy to keep, accepting the diet offered to the larger species
but probably the least insectivorous of the genus imported. Very vocal, a
short note often repeated for long periods. Bathes regularly and tames
quickly.
Streaked Spiderhunter Arachnothera magna
Range: Himalayas, China, India, Burma, Malaya, Thailand and Laos.
Breeds between 1800 and 4500 ft in India.
Habitat: Forest, secondary growth and clearings, especially near wild
banana.
Description: Length 6 V 2 -IV 2 in (16.5-19 cm). Yellow olive, streaked
black, finely on throat but getting larger on breast, back and head. Tail
and wings brownish green. Bill black; feet vary from orange to yellow and
eyes from black to brown.
Comments: When birds were imported from India they were quite
numerous but few have been imported recently. Suffers badly with its
feet when first imported. The birds we have owned of this species that
were of Indian origin seemed to mix quite well together but those from
Malaya were quite aggressive.
Very easy to feed, even when first imported and will take most insects
plus most forms of conventional food, i.e. sponge cake and nectar, bread
and milk, fruit and soft food. Very tame. It is reputed to be the largest of
the spiderhunters but from personal experience this is not so; the largest

birds we have owned are A. clarae and A. flavigaster.
Spectacled Spiderhunter Arachnothera flavigaster
Range: Sumatra, Borneo, Malaya and Thailand.
Habitat: Locally common in secondary growth.
Description: Body, head, wings and tail olive green; breast and under-
tail greyish yellow. Covered edge of flight and tail feathers brownish green.
Bold eye ring and ear patch yellow. Beak dark brown; eye brown and feet
horn-coloured.
Comments: One of the easiest to feed. A large bird, probably the
largest if measured by body weight. Very tame and can be kept in pairs or
groups, but again must be watched. Able to take large insects such as adult
crickets and third instar locusts.
Whitehead's Spiderhunter Arachnothera juliae
Everett's Spiderhunter Arachnothera everetti
Both of the two remaining species of spiderhunter occur only on
Borneo and it is unlikely that either has been imported. Information about
their natural history can be found in The Birds ofBomeoby B.E. Smythies.
We have seen a skin of everetti and have grouped it, along with juliae
in Group 2 where we think they belong.
The groupings below are based on observations and experience of the
various species in captivity and what we have been able to find out about
their natural history.
Group 1: A. crassirostris , A. longirostris
This group consists of the two smallest species which are similar in
plumage although this is not the major similarity, the important common
characteristics being diet and display.
The display of both is a series of stretch-posing by the male and wing
fluttering by the female. ,1 longirostris will show its pectoral tufts most
times it displays, but crassirostris only shows them when posing with its
wings open. Both have tail feathers tipped or barred and the feet of both
are very similar to those of the large sunbirds, in that the toes are formed
with the nails being short but curved.
We experienced great difficulty in getting these two species to take
any substitute for live food which was difficult to supply as they would
only take small spiders and fruit flies. It was some time before house flies
and bluebottles were taken, and even then the birds showed little interest.
They would probably have taken small stick insects but at the time we
had not started to use these.
A friend had a longirostris that laid an egg on the floor of a cage. Ours

have never shown any nest-building behaviour, although they did mate.
Group 2: A. clarae, A. chrysogenys, (A. everetti), A. affinis, A. rob-
usta, (A. juliae)
This group contains the true spiderhunters. In appearance they are very
similar. A. clarae has the shortest beak but this is not an indication of how
insectivorous it is as the most insectivorous species in the group is chryso-
genys but none is very dependent on live food in its diet.
The songs of A. clarae, affinis and robusta are so similar that we are
unable to tell them apart; chrysogenys has a higher pitched song.
The dietary requirements are basically half insectivorous and half
nectar and fruit. Notes from wild observations indicate that fruit juice,
rather than the actual fruit, is eaten.
Group 3: A. magna and A. flavigaster
This group contains the largest species of the genus. Both are robust
birds and able to take quite large insects. The display of A. magna is
mainly wing flutterings and neck stretching; its whistle is a sharp note.

BREEDING THE HYACINTHINE MACAW
Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus
By DAPHNE and WALTER GRUNEBAUM
(Gloucestershire)
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.947908428571429" page_id="56319919"  page_num="11" year="" vol="">
Six years ago we acquired a pair of Hyacinthine Macaws and as we
were unfamiliar with these beautiful birds, we sought information when-
ever possible. We discovered from reference books that they inhabit the
forests, swamps and palm groves of the interior of southern Brazil and
the westernmost parts of Bolivia; also that a great deal of their habitat is
now being lost, owing to the opening up of Brazil, and that numbers of
the birds are used by the natives for food.
Their diet consists of fruit, seeds and nuts of various kinds. They are
mostly seen in pairs and, if disturbed, will circle round, screeching, and
then settle in the tops of tall trees. The staff at Kew Gardens told us that
the trees have a very quick leaf fall, and are almost immediately re-estab-
lished.
These macaws are the largest of all parrots, their length overall being
35 inches (89 cm); the tail of the immature bird is a little shorter.
All this was interesting but did not make us much the wiser at keeping
Hyacinthine Macaws in captivity in the English climate and with the
limited variety of food available here.
When our birds arrived, they were seen feeding each other and gave
every indication of being a true pair. The cock bird had a long white tail
feather and several white flecks on his shoulders so it was easy to dis-
tinguish him from the hen. We put them in our largest aviary, which was
not at all suitable as it was made of wood but it did have a flight 10 ft
(3 m) high and nearly 40 ft (12 m) long. Their "house" measured about
8 ft (2.5 m) x 12 ft (3.65 m) at the apex, with a large, sturdy box 2 ft
(61 cm) square, with a tin base, placed as high as possible on one wall. The
birds obviously liked the height but it proved disastrous from our point of
view, when trying either to inspect or photograph. A barrel was provided
on the ground, together with two others in the flight outside, placed at
various heights. All these barrels were ignored. Several natural branches of
various thickness were fixed inside for them to roost on and, again, were
placed as high as possible. Their house was well lit and heating was also
available, used mainly at night. Their house opened on to a covered
"verandah" where they had their food and drink, and where they could
see all that was going on. From there they had their long flight to a small
perspex-covered shelter at the far end, where they could get out of the

wind, which they cannot tolerate. Several branches of fresh willow, ash or
fruitwood were placed in the aviary, along one side only to allow the birds'
flight to be uninterrupted.
When they first came to us, their diet consisted solely of coconut,
Brazil nuts and an occasional apple. Nothing else was taken, and sunflower
seed was totally rejected so their diet was the first problem we had to over-
come. We put another pair of macaws in an adjacent aviary, and the sight
of these birds obviously enjoying banana and various foods eventually
persuaded the Hyacinthines to add other fruits and vegetables to their diet.
After two years, in late March, the hen became interested in her box
and laid two eggs. The incubation period is 28 days but at the end of this
time the eggs vanished, presumably infertile. After another two months
she laid two more eggs, but regrettably the chicks were dead in shell. The
following year the hen died in May, quite suddenly and without any signs
of previous illness. The post mortem examination disclosed that she had
no eggs inside her, that she had emphysema and a fatty heart. Perhaps her
previous unsatisfactory diet had some bearing on this.
The cock bird appeared distraught at her death, so we put a young Blue
and Yellow Macaw into the aviary to keep him company. She taught him
to eat sunflower seed, albeit reluctantly. During this time we searched for
another bird, without any success. The cock bird went into moult and lost
his white feathers.
After three months of indefatigable search, we eventually found
another bird. It was not surgically sexed so we had to take a chance. Its
feathers were dull and the yellow skin around the lower mandible was a
pale cream colour, which, compared to the colour of our cock, which was
dark orange, looked almost anaemic and on arrival she ate only Brazil nuts
and white sunflower seed.
We put the two together in September 1982 and after three months we
noticed that her diet had changed and they were both eating a good variety
of food, which consisted mainly of coconuts, Brazil nuts and sweetcorn
(fresh or defrosted frozen), augmented by bananas, grapes, apples, peas,
broad beans and carrots, in season, and a few peanuts and walnuts. These
last were not much favoured. Gradually the sunflower seed was abandoned.
We no longer worried about their diet as their feathers were shining and
the yellow skin on the new bird was becoming darker by the week.
The first indication that they might be courting came when we opened
the trap for the cock to fly at liberty to which he had been accustomed
before his first hen died though since then we had kept him shut in. To
our astonishment he would not go out! He became very excited and flew
backwards and forwards into his house, refusing to go near the trap.

Shortly after this we saw, and heard them mating and on 26th March 1983
to our great relief, she laid two eggs. Three days before the 28-day incuba-
tion period ended the cock opened up the roof of his flight and both birds
were found playing about the garden. As it was her first time at liberty,
with eggs in the box, it was a nasty moment. However, by leaving them
quietly to their own devices, they put themselves back in with no trouble
at all but they lost interest in the eggs which disappeared, presumably in-
fertile. It was then the 25th April.
However, in May 1983 the hen was back in the box again, sitting tight.
The first egg must have been laid between 14th and 16th May. We increased
the heat at this point, and with the aid of an old boiler and a piece of pipe,
we were able to get a thin plume of steam into the house, thereby increas-
ing the level of humidity. We would do this once or twice a day for an
hour or two. It was interesting to see that from this moment, whenever we
approached the aviary, the parents would assume a defensive position with
backs together and tails crossed, accompanied by loud cries. They would
stay like this until we moved away.
It was on 15th June that we heard the unmistakeable sound of macaw-
chick noises coming from the box. It was an unforgettable moment, for
although we have bred so many Blue and Yellow Macaws, somehow this
was very different. The next day we were able to see the chick, which was
tiny and appeared to be black skinned. There was also a second egg which
had been abandoned. On 19th June we looked in again and saw that the
chick was now definitely pink and already much larger. The parents now
started to search for grit early in the morning and we put a pile of lime-
stones in their flight, which they would pick up and grind in their beaks.
We have never seen them eat commercial grit. On 17th June yet another
egg appeared but by the following night it had vanished. The chick then
made steady progress, dark quills being visible by 7th July.
The parents' diet at this time consisted of the usual coconuts and
sweetcorn but they now enjoyed broad beans which were in season, and
the first early peas. However, they could not be persuaded to eat any kind
of soft rearing foot, which was eaten in quantity by the Blue and Yellow
Macaws. A lot of cuttlefish "bone" was taken and daily vitamins were
given in the drinking water.
At six weeks the yellow skin around the black beak and eyes could be
seen and the chick started to look like a real Hyacinthine. The tail was
about 5 in (12.5 cm) long and, apart from a few bare patches on its back,
the chick appeared to be fully feathered and had become very aware of
its surroundings. The parents now started to consume large quantities of
cob and hazel nuts, even when they were still green and unripe.

After another five weeks of steady progress, on 7th September the
chick came out of the box and was found on the floor of the house. The
parents would not go to it but sat on the side of the box calling to it. We
waited, agonising over what best to do, but as it made no attempt to
move, we eventually picked it up and put it back inside the box. After
another day or two, it came out on to the verandah without further
mishap.
However, our satisfaction over its progress was short lived. It appeared
listless and rather nervous of climbing about; we thought this might be due
to its fall at the start. It did not make any serious attempt to eat and
would pick up a piece of sweetcorn and let it drop again, without taking
anything from it. We began to worry when it failed to go back in to roost
with its parents at night, in spite of their desperate efforts to get it to do
so. The cock was obviously aware that something was amiss, and tried to
make the chick eat. He stayed pathetically over the food tin, bobbing his
head and making encouraging little noises but the chick did not respond
and on the day we had decided that it would have to be taken away, it
was found once more on the floor. Although we had not been too happy

about its general behaviour, it had nevertheless appeared to be in good
physical shape up to the moment that it failed to go in to roost at night.
It had undoubtedly caught a chill and quick action was called for. We took
it into our house, boosted the room temperature to 80-85*F and laid the
chick on a hot water bottle. Our veterinary surgeon visited and gave it a
tube feed of Complan and Farex, and a B12 injection. The next day it was
still obviously very ill but it was fed every two hours and we felt that it
was holding its own. Someone then suggested that we should wrap it in
foil under the infra-red lamp. This we did and the result was extraordinary
in that, that very same evening, it was up and sitting on the edge of its
box! Feeding was still very difficult as the syringes which we had seemed
inadequate for a bird with such a large beak. Flowever, when some friends
who were experienced in these matters brought us a much larger plastic
syringe, which was, in fact, for basting roast meat, feeding became very
much easier and the chick started to make a rapid recovery. However, if
the temperature in the room dropped below 75*F, the chick deteriorated
again, so a close watch had to be kept. The weight of the chick had dropped
to around 2 lbs at this time, but after five days of regular feeding, it was
once more on its feet and taking an interest in life. We removed it from the
small room, gradually lowering the heat, and installed it in a sunroom,
where it could see other birds. After a short time it was able to hold food
for itself, and was able to cope with peanuts and half-shelled Brazil nuts,
banana, apple and it would try to scrape coconut. For about 10 days we
continued to give it three daily feeds of soft food, but all milk-based food
such as Milupa had to be stopped as the chick started to scour. By adding a
teaspoon of live yoghurt to some apple puree and Farex, this condition
was cured in five days. At the end of three weeks, the chick started to
refuse soft food altogether and now (October 1983) it spends most of the
day wrestling with half-shelled nuts, small pieces of sweetcorn, apple and
soaked raisins. It has become very affectionate. The cock parent has spot-
ted him through the glass and has been down to investigate, regurgitating
as hard as he can. The hen is still not at all interested. We think that they
would still accept the chick, as long as it can feed itself, but now unfortu-
nately the weather is too cold to put it outside, even though it now weighs
over 4 lbs.
Conclusions
In spite of their size, Hyacinthine Macaws do not seem to be very
robust, and for this reason we have never contemplated surgical sexing,
nor have we ever wanted, or indeed needed (until now!) to hand-rear as we
felt that if it could be a natural process, then so much the better for both
mother and chick. Our Blue and Yellow Macaws have reared a brood of

three this season perfectly adequately.
Hyacinthines seem to be very loveable and extremely intelligent birds
but, with their enormously strong beaks, special attention should be paid
to their housing, as we have learned to our cost, a stone and metal con-
struction being the most satisfactory. They also need a never-ending sup-
ply of branches to strip and chew, and they consume a prodigious amount
of food, especially during the breeding season. They are also capable of
making an appalling noise if they are disturbed by strangers, or suffering
from boredom or frustration. Some form of heating to maintain the over-
night temperature at around 70*F, together with some means of increasing
the level of humidity, proved successful in this instance, and the nest-box
was one-third filled with dampened bark and peat to make an atmos-
phere of humid warmth for the eggs.
Breeding the little Hyacinthine has been a wonderful and worthwhile
experience, but we have one regret - the cock bird seems to have lost his
white feathers. It is now well over a year and there is still no sign of them!

Shortly before going to press, an article was received from Mr. Gerd Volkemer,
also on breeding the Hyacinthine Macaw. As so little has been published on this
subject, and as Mr. Volkemer's account included some additional details, a precis of
his article is given below. We would like to extend our congratulations to Mr. and
Mrs. Grunebaum and to Mr. Volkemer for breeding such a difficult species which we
hope will now become a regular event, and that their experience will enable captive
breeding stocks to be established eventually.

A pair of these beautiful macaws was obtained in 1977 but unfortu-
nately one died shortly afterwards. It was not until four years later that I
obtained a further bird to make up the pair.
This pair was placed in an aviary measuring 4 m x 2 m x 1.5 m wide
with inside quarters of 1.75 m x 2 m x 1.5 m wide. The temperature was
kept slightly above freezing point during winter although these birds seem
not to be sensitive to cold weather. A matchwood nest-box 1 m high x
50 cm x 50 cm was installed; the entrance hole was 20 cm square. Metal
plating was placed around all corners of the box to prevent it from being
destroyed and oak branches were placed around the entrance for the birds
to chew if they wished.
Their diet consisted of various fruits, dried beef bones, a mixture of
corn, oats, wheat, hemp and some smaller seeds, sunflower and peanuts.
Calcium and minerals were mixed with the food and small pieces of mussel
shell were also given. Every four weeks, the birds received a five-day course
of multi-vitamins in their water. They also showed a fondness for small
stones (1-4 mm).
At the end of May both birds adopted a defensive attitude towards
their nest-box whenever the aviary was approached. The female would
disappear inside before peering out and biting the oak branches surround-
ing the entrance, while the male stood nearby adopting an aggressive pos-
ture. Occasionally both birds would sit close, nodding their heads while
holding beaks and uttering a loud "rolling" noise.
Copulation took place with both birds sitting next to each other, tails
crossed with the male placing a foot on the female's back.
The first two eggs laid disappeared after a fortnight but on 2nd June a
further two were found. These measured 50 mm x 35 mm, were pure
white and the weight of one was 20 grams. The female incubated for
approximately 30 days (exact duration was difficult to determine because
of their aggressiveness). Only one hatched. This chick produced soft noises
Tor several weeks before going through a period of silence until it started
to become very vocal.
Its eyes opened at about two weeks of age and it left the nest at three
months. At this point the plumage was duller than in adults and a paler
yellow around the eye.
In addition to their normal diet, sprouted oats, wheat, sunflower and
corn and unripe corn- on-the-cob (maize) were also given.
In 1983 this pair reared another two young and an additional pair
produced one.

(New Barnet, Hertfordshire)
One hundred years ago, in 1884, Maarten Dirk van Renesse van Duiven-
bode presented a magnificent collection of birds and animals from New
Guinea to the Royal Natural History Museum in Belgium. Among them
was a new lory which was dedicated to the donor (Prestwich, 1963).
In the following century, little has been learned about this very
beautiful bird. It was first seen alive in Britain in 1929 when at least four
birds were imported. At the time not much more was known about it
other than that it was found in northern New Guinea. This is a lowland
species, found up to about 200 m (660 ft). Rand and Gilliard (1967)
found it to be "only fairly common" and recorded that it was usually seen
in small parties of up to six or eight birds in the tops of forest trees. For-
shaw (1978) records that it is irregularly distributed, being common in
some areas but uncommon to rare in others. Near Maprik, in north-western
Papua New Guinea, Pearson (1975) carried out a six weeks' survey from
September to November on a 15 hectare plot of lowland primary forest.
He found the species to be an uncommon resident of the mid-storey. In
the same year Greensmith observed five Duivenbode's Lories in a mixed
flock with Rainbow Lorikeets feeding at the top of a high tree in second-
growth forest.
During the period 1973 to 1978 several New Guinea parrots, primarily
lories and Fig Parrots, made their reappearance in aviculture, having pre-
viously been known only from the era of small private importations in
the first 30 years of this century. They included Duivenbode's Lories,
which appeared in small numbers; despite every care, many proved diffi-
cult to establish. By the early 1980s no one in Britain had bred the species
(which had been reared in the USA and Germany) and I doubt whether
there were 20 birds in the UK.
This is a lory which could be confused with no other: indeed, few
parrots have such distinctive and unusual plumage and no other parrot
has a colour scheme of rich brown, yellow and violet. The predominant
colour is dark brown. The head is strikingly marked in adult birds with a
band of yellow from the lores, encircling the beak and throat; the fore-
head is also bright yellow. The entire under wing coverts are bright yellow,
also the thighs and a patch on the sides. The underside of the tail is
bronze-yellow. The narrow, elongated feathers of the nape and the sides of
the neck are yellow (dull, not bright) in adults. Lower back, rump and

under tail coverts are violet or deep blue. Breast feathers have the con-
cealed part yellow; primaries are black with a large yellow patch on the
inner web. Beak, cere and legs, also the skin surrounding the eye, are
black. The iris is dark brown, with an inner circle of pale yellow.
Length: 31 cm (12 in).
In the first and second editions of Parrots of the World the word "un-
described" appears after immature plumage. After comparing moulted and
unmoulted birds of the year, I can provide the following description of
immature Duivenbode's Lories:
The yellow area on the face (but not under the wings) is duller and less
extensive than in adults. The elongated nape feathers are brown, not
yellow. The naked skin surrounding the eye and lower mandible is white,
not black as in adults; the bill and cere are black. The size is noticeably
smaller.
Adult males are generally larger and of bolder appearance than females,
although not to the pronounced degree of the Black Lory C atra.
The genus Chalcopsitta contains four long-tailed lories, of perhaps more
contrasting coloration than is found in any other parrot genera. The
Cardinal C. cardinalis is red, the Black C. atra is black and the Yellow-
streaked C sintillata has possibly the gaudiest array of colours seen on a
parrot, but is green above. C duvenbodei has already been described. The
Cardinal is extremely rare in captivity; the other three I have kept and
have bred the Black (Low, 1978). The Chalcopsitta lories are fascinating
birds, beautiful, extremely responsive to man and highly intelligent. They
nearly all become tame in time, even imported adults. Young birds quickly
start to mimic, without any conscious effort to teach them on the part of
their owner: some adults kept in an aviary will mimic the sounds of human
conversation without actually producing words.
Unfortunately, however, they are extremely noisy and frequently emit
harsh, ear-splitting shrieks of a power which is perhaps equalled only by
the largest cockatoos. When in breeding condition their calls are persistent
and even more excrutiatingly unpleasant.
Our Chalcopsitta lories have, as their basic diet, nectar which consists
of malt extract (1 heaped tablespoonful), Milupa baby cereal (a variety of
fruit flavours) (two or three heaped tablespoonsful), glucose (two heaped
tablespoonsful) and a little condensed milk, dissolved in hot water and
then made up to 1 litre (35 fluid oz) with cold water. This is changed
twice daily or more frequently in very hot or very cold weather. I am not
entirely convinced that this is a good rearing diet for Duivenbode's Lories,
although it has proved satisfactory for other species (plus various fruits
and vegetables and, in some cases, seed) and in future will attempt to

supplement this. The problem with the Duivenbode's is that they are most
conservative feeders and usually decline to accept foods other than sweet
com and a little apple and pear. This is in complete contrast to the Yellow-
streaked Lories which will consume almost any food offered.
Prior to being introduced to the male in November 1978 the female of
our pair of Duivenbode's had been kept with another female for about
three years. Her initial reaction to the male was one of fear; she crouched
in the corner of the aviary on the floor, although at no time has the male
behaved aggressively towards her. After several months they were totally
compatible. I neglected to note when copulation first occurred but believe
that this was in 1981. The first breeding attempt was in 1982. Two eggs
were laid; one chick hatched and died the same day.
Because of the extreme aggressiveness of the male in breeding condition
(he would attack anyone who entered the aviary - a total transformation
from the timid adult when first acquired) the pair was moved to a new
aviary in February 1983. A few feet from their former enclosure, it was
designed to allow nest-box inspection from outside the aviary. The meas-
urements were 7 ft x 3 ft x 6 ft (2.1 m x 91 cm x 1.8 m high).In a seclu-
ded position, protected by a wall, shrubs and conifers (and covered in
polythene in the winter), it has no shelter. The nest-box is permanently
in position for roosting purposes. It measures 9 in (23 cm) square and
21 in (54 cm) high. Several inches of pet litter (obtained in compressed
packs from pet shops) line the base.
Mating and courtship feeding had been observed for several weeks prior
to their removal. Removal did not interrupt the breeding cycle. They soon
entered the new nest-box and by 12th April the female was incubating one
egg. The completed clutch, as in most lories, was two eggs.
I inspected the nest on the evening of 5th May, when the female made
a brief sojourn into the flight and, to my surprise, saw a wriggling chick.
I had a split second before the female's return to decide what to do -
and removed it just as she came in through the nest entrance. The chick
was fluffy, indicating that it was not newly-hatched; it had either hatched
on the previous day or early that morning. There was no food in its crop
but it seemed strong and healthy. After it had been in the brooder a little
while, it fed eagerly on our usual lory chick food. This consists of approxi-
mately equal parts of Boots bone and beef broth with vegetables (baby
weaning food) and Heinz tinned fruit dessert. This is simply mixed with
water and heated until it starts to boil. It is quick and easy to make and
will rear any lory species. At first the chick could take only small amounts
and needed to be fed every hour or hour and a half.
Next evening I inspected the nest again and was surprised and delighted
to find a second chick. Again, I just managed to remove it before the

female returned. I greatly dislike removing chicks in these circumstances -
before the parents have been given an opportunity to rear - and silently
vowed that next time they should have a chance to rear their own. On
removal the second chick was more obviously newly-hatched than the
first. It weighed 8 g, as against 9 g of the first chick. The chicks had the
bill very dark brown, with a contrasting white egg tooth. The long white
down was not densely distributed over the body.
By the time they were seven days old, the chicks' feet had assumed a
brown tinge. Between 10 and 19 days their bodies took on a darker
appearance as the feather tracts of the second down became apparent.
Being dark In colour, they were most conspicuous. By about 20 days the
second down was erupting. This was dark grey in colour. The eyes started
to slit at about 12 days but were not fully open until about three weeks.
The toes of one chick were in the correct position, while all those of the
other were still pointing forward; this is quite common at this age.
On 29th May, at about 24 days, the first contour feathers were erupt-
ing, shortly to be followed by the head feathers. At this stage they had a
somewhat untidy appearance, retaining wisps of the first down on the
head and back. By the time they were five weeks old the body feathers
had just broken through the sheaths. These were dull brown above and
yellow-tipped brown below. There was a tinge of yellow on the opening
feathers of the forehead, cheeks and ear coverts. The white area of skin
surrounding the eye was very prominent. The large, sturdy feet were
black. The chicks weighed 130 and 140 g.
By then the temperature in the brooder had been reduced from about
92*F to 82*F (27.7 *C). Their feathering was well developed by six
weeks - nearly covering the mantle, underparts and crown. The younger
chick had deeper coloured and more extensive yellow feathering on the
forehead and ear coverts and at the sides of the beak. However, by the
time they were weaned and after the first moult, they were indistinguishable.
Their tails were, at six weeks, Vi in (12 mm) long.
By this stage they were very vocal, their food soliciting call sounding
like that of a Trichoglossus lorikeet chick amplified. They were quite
active and their nails were painfully sharp. At seven weeks they were
transferred from the brooder, in which the heat had been gradually lowered
to about 79*F (21*C), to an unheated weaning cage. This is simply a box
12 in x 16 in x 12 in high (31 x 41 x 31 cm), with a hinged lid and a wire
front. The young birds stand on a false floor of welded mesh under which
there is a thick layer of wood chippings. These weaning cages are utilised
in preference to larger, open parrot cages, as a convenient transition from
the brooder.
By now the young Duivenbode's were almost fully feathered, except

The young Duivenbode's Lories on the point of taking off to land on the
photographer's head. They were very difficult to photograph!
under the wings (the final area to feather in lory chicks); the tails were
very short, less than 2 in (about 4 cm). They were becoming vocal and
adventurous, and their personalities were emerging. The older chick was
perching and could climb to the top of the weaning cage. A week later
they had outgrown this and were transferred to a metal cage 24 in (61 cm)
long with a wire front.
When offered nectar on 30th June the older chick soon started to
feed. Within two days both were drinking substantial amounts, filling
their crops between spoon-feeds. The older chick quickly learned to
drink in the same manner as an adult, while the younger at first lapped,
keeping its lower mandible outside the nectar container. A week pre-
viously their food had been augmented with CeDe Canary rearing food,
as provided to larger parrot chicks, as they had seemed a little on the
thin side.
Within a few days it became impracticable to keep them in the metal
cage and they were transferred to a 6 ft (1.8 m)indoor flight. On 30th and
31st July they were placed outdoors for most of the day but brought
indoors at night because thunderstorms were imminent. They settled
down quickly in their outdoor aviary, finding the nectar within minutes.

At this stage they were still receiving a late night spoon-feed, partly
because they enjoyed the attention and because I believe that weaning
should be as protracted as possible.
Meanwhile, the parents had nested again; the female laid on 28th and
30th June. I was able to ascertain the incubation period as 24 days, as the
eggs hatched on 21st and 23rd July. Fortunately it was easy to inspect
the nest as the female would leave whenever fresh nectar was provided.
For the first two days of the first chick's life I inspected the nest two or
three times daily and never found it with any food in its crop. On the
third morning I fed the chick and returned it to the nest. That evening
there were two chicks and I removed both for a quick feed. I fed the
younger and found to my relief that the other had a full crop.
Thenceforth the female became much more protective of the nest;
while she allowed me a quick look when she left, she would return before
I could ascertain how much food was in the chicks' crops. I continued to
check the nest two or three times daily - as it is up to the eight-day stage
that losses of lory chicks are most likely to occur - and all seemed to be
progressing well.
The only food taken during this period was nectar and a little corn and
apple; other fruits and greenfoods were ignored. The female was very at-
tentive to the chicks which usually had bulging crops. However, as often
happens with lory chicks, the older was appreciably heavier and probably
receiving a greater share of the food. On 21st July I was quite concerned
about the younger and removed it quickly to find it weighed only 41 g.
At the same age the hand-reared chicks had weighed 83 g and 74 g. Some
extra litter (wood shavings) was added to the nest, which remained dry.
While this was being carried out, the parents showed extreme anxiety,
screaming and biting at the nest-box from which they had been prevented
access. Because of their concern I decided to leave the chicks with them,
although neither was as well developed as their hand-reared counterparts.
By 23rd July they had some wispy down remaining, but no signs of
feather tracts. A week later both were totally devoid of down - and I
suspected that they were being plucked by the female. Feather tracts
were evident, especially on the wings.
By 21st August the younger chick was totally devoid of down and no
feathers were emerging. As it was a source of worry, it was removed for
hand-feeding. Its weight was 89 g. It then progressed well and had greatly
increased its weight to 140 g by 30th August. By the middle of September
it was fully feathered but remained in a heated brooder because it had a
much younger Dusky Lory Pseudeos fuscata as a companion. Doubtless it
would have consumed nectar at an earlier age but this was not offered
until 25th September when both young lories were moved to a weaning

cage. The five and a half week old Dusky consumed nectar equally as
enthusiastically as the Duivenbode's.
Also on 25th September the Duivenbode's reared by its parents
emerged from the nest-box - after 11 weeks. It sat quite calmly in the
aviary. The night promised to be fine and mild; nevertheless, I took the
precaution of returning it to the nest-box. It was roosting out after its
parents had retired to the nest. On the following night the procedure
was repeated but the young lory emerged immediately from the nest to
roost alone on top of it. After several weeks it roosted inside with its
parents.
Unfortunately, I cannot record this as a total success story. On the
morning of 2nd December, following a very cold night with several degrees
of frost, one of the May-hatched youngsters was found dead in the nest-
box. My veterinarian provided the following post mortem report: "The
main finding - and the cause of death in my opinion - was a large cyst of
ureate-like material ventral to the cloaca but not affecting the cloacal
bursa. This contained about 15 ml of fluid and bulged out as soon as the
abdomen was opened. The material had no smell and there was no sign of
infection or inflammation. The bird was a female and the areas affected
seem to be the distal oviduct/uterus (shell gland). I feel that this is prob-
ably a congenital abnormality in this bird and that the cyst had gradually
been filling throughout its life."
On a brighter note, I am pleased to report that several months after our
initial success, Duivenbode's Lory was bred in two other collections in the
UK - by Mrs. Patricia King and at Birdland, Bourton-on-the-Water, one
youngster being reared in each case.

Poospiza hispaniolensis
By JEFFREY TROLLOPE
(Hounslow, Middlesex)
Introduction
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.973608033333333" page_id="56319935"  page_num="27" year="" vol="">
The genus Poospiza consists of some 16 species of Neotropical buntings;
they are small, active and acrobatic birds which are not well known in avi-
culture. Importations into the UK have always been small in number and
erratic and because of their quietly coloured plumage, they have lacked
the popularity of more colourful and available genera, such as Paroaria,
Sicalis and Corysphospingus. There have been very few successful breedings,
the most recent is probably forP. ornata in Sweden (Zackrisson, 1972).
The limited information available indicates that they are, like other
Neotropical Emberizidae, opportunistic breeders, with a rapid reproduc-
tion rate when triggered by "optimum" environmental conditions. They
are very insectivorous when breeding and if a good quality insectivorous
diet is provided, reproduction in outside aviaries is not inhibited by
declining photo period and temperature.
P. hispaniolensis has also been known as Bonaparte's Warbling Finch;
the species is sexually dimorphic.
Description
Cock: Bill blackish and glossy, rather long and slender, irides brownish,
lower eyelid white, long white eyebrow stripe surmounted by narrow dark
line, side of head black, upperparts grey, wing coverts with a greenish buff
wash, tail black with the inner webs of outer feathers whitish. Underparts
white, side of breast and body grey, centre of breast black, sides of vent
chestnut, legs and feet light brown.
Hen: Bill greyish brown, eyebrow stripe greyish white, upperparts
brown streaked with dusky, tail greyish brown, underparts greyish; the
hen lacks the black on the sides of head and centre of breast.
Distribution and habitat
South-west Ecuador and coastal Peru; cactus, scrub and cultivation.
Birds and housing
A pair of P. hispaniolensis was purchased in October 1980 and housed
in an outside heated bird room during the winter. During 1981 and 1982

they were housed outside in my No. 3 aviary (3.25 x 1.5 x 2.25 m) from
April to November.
Food and feeding
The birds are fed on a millet mixture with the addition of canary seed,
niger, hemp and maw; a commercial insectivorous softfood is also given,
but seldom eaten. Seeding grasses are given throughout the year. Livefood
consisting of mealworms, maggots and small house crickets are also given
throughout the year and when the birds are breeding, collected livefood
from nettle beds and bushes is provided.
Breeding
Although both birds were fit and active, the cock also singing frequent-
ly throughout the seasons, no breeding activity occurred during 1981 and
1982. They were released into No. 3 aviary on 25th May 1983 and both
birds were very active, the cock singing continuously. On 5th August, the
hen began to build a nest in a clump of coniferous branches fixed to the
aviary side. The nest was completed by 8th August and copulation was
observed. Both birds chased away other species from the site ( Uraeginthus ,
Amandava Waxbills and a pair of Tambourine Doves Turtur tympanistria).
The first clutch was infertile. One chick was hatched and reared from each
of the second and third clutches (Table 1).

The same nest was used for the three clutches, a deep cup of dried
grasses and straw, lined with finer grass stems (Plate 1) built in a fork of
cut conifer branches. The hen alone built the nest and during this period
the cock was continually chasing other birds from the site.

Very pale blue ovates, marked at the larger end with small blackish
and dark ash spots, three to a clutch.
Incubation
Like other Neotropical buntings, the hen was a close sitter and toler-
ant of nest inspection. The incubation period was 13 days, carried out
entirely by the hen. The cock occasionally fed her while she was incuba-
ting, although she came off the nest to feed herself and exercise.
Chicks
The nestling has dark greyish skin, with greyish brown down; the gape
is pinkish with whitish gape flanges, darker near bill tip. Both parents
fed the chick, the cock brooding when the hen came off to feed. This
pattern was repeated for the chick of the third clutch. In common with
other Neotropical bunting species, the chicks left the nest at an early
age (10 and 9 days respectively); neither the primaries nor tail feathers
were fully developed and they could not fly effectively for another four
to five days.
At 26 days (plate 2) the young have the bill dark horn, the irides are
light brown, the forehead, crown and nape are greyish brown with a pro-
nounced greyish white eyebrow stripe. The area from the bill across the
upper face to the nape is brownish grey, the throat and lower cheeks are
greyish white. Breast and abdomen are light grey, heavily streaked with
dark brown, the upper surface is greyish brown, streaked with darker
brown, wings and tail brown, with a few feathers tipped with light grey,
legs and feet light flesh colour.
The parents fed the chicks almost entirely on live food, collected from
nettle beds and bushes, supplemented with mealworms and small maggots.
House crickets and insectivorous softbill mixture was provided but was not
fed to the chick. However, the young birds, when independent of their
parents, took both crickets and soft food. When the hen was incubating
the third clutch, the cock fed and guarded the first chick that had hatched.
The young became independent of the parents at 24 and 25 days respec-
tively, eating hard seed and all other foods provided. At the time of writ-
ing (30th November 1983) the first hatched chick is darker on the side
of the head, wings and breast, and appears to be a young cock.
Behaviour
P. hispaniolensis is an active, fast flying species, constantly flirting the
wings and tail and perching on the sides of the aviary and plant growth,
and acrobatic and effective at catching flying insects. Pair bonding and pre-

copulatory display consists of bill touching, the birds flying towards each
other then briefly touching bills while hovering. When perched, they move
rapidly towards each other along the perch and touch bills. Bill touching
is often followed by copulatory chasing, the cock chasing the hen until
she perches. The soliciting posture consists of the hen raising her head,
flirting the wings and tail, and then the tail is moved to one side and
raised. The cock then mounts with rapid wing beats. There is often an
element of aggression in this display, usually from the hen who will jab
at the cock after bill touching. During copulatory chasing, the cock will
make a circling movement of the head in line with the body; the head is
raised, moved back and then lowered and thrust forward in one rapid
movement. Zackrisson (1972) reported that breeding Pretty Warbling
Finches P. omata were very aggressive to other species, killing a waxbill.
In view of this, I was apprehensive. However, although the cock, and
occasionally the hen, chased other birds from the nest site, no serious
aggression occurred. Both parents were bold when I entered the aviary,
flying at my head and sometimes lightly brushing me with their wings.
Voice
The call notes are a che it cheoo. The cock's song is loud and cheerful,
rather complex for an Emberizinae species. I have noted it as choo whit
cheoo, choo chit wit cheoo cheoo, cheoo whit chee cheoo, choo chit wit,
chit chee cheoo cheoo chit, chi cheoo wit. When I entered the aviary or a
cat was sighted they gave a low chut chut.
Summary
The breeding of captive P. hispaniolensis is described with notes on
behaviour and voice. In common with other Neotropical buntings, they
lay small clutches and are multi-brooded. The young have a rapid rate of
growth and development.
In a temperate climate, reproduction is not inhibited by declining
photo-period and temperature.

A White-cheeked Touraco has been successfully hand-reared at Padstow
Bird Gardens from an egg deserted by the parents, for no apparent reason,
after ten days' incubation.
A clutch of two eggs was placed in the incubator at a temperature of
99*F. The incubation period for the White-cheeked Touraco is 21-22 days,
the eggs being laid at two-day intervals, with two being the normal clutch
size. We were surprised when chipping was heard from the eggs on the
23rd day as we had just begun to think that the chicks were dead in shell.
The first chick to hatch was very small and had obvious difficulty in
breathing which got steadily worse and it died later that same day. The
second chick hatched within minutes of the first, on the 24th day of in-
cubation. This chick was much stronger than the first and it struggled
for a few seconds to free itself from the shell, then, exhausted by its
efforts, it slept for several minutes; upon waking it started to preen itself
by throwing its head over its back and pulling at its thick, black down.
At this stage, it was still quite weak and could only support its head for
a second or two.

White-cheeked Touraco being fed at 14 days old
Once dry, it showed signs of being hungry and a Chinese Painted
Quail egg, which was also about to hatch in the incubator, almost became
its first meal!
The Touraco was reared on a low fat, natural yogurt and first stage
baby food "Fruit Delight" mixture, to which was added small quantities
of calcium lactate, Vionate and Farlene baby cereal. The ingredients
were mixed well and slightly warmed by adding a little hot water.
The Touraco, whose eyes opened on the second day, would gape at
the slightest vibration but it was a further five days before it responded
by sight alone. It was fed by a 5 ml syringe to which a small length of
soft rubber tubing had been attached. At first, it was fed about 3&amp;gt;Vi ml
of food every hour through the day, then once last thing at night and
again in the small hours of the morning.
To cool it down, as when a brooding adult gets off the chick to feed
it, the young Touraco was removed from the incubator at each feed.
To make the chick feel more secure, I placed it in a small cardboard
box measuring 6 x 6 x 4 in. It was lined with limpet shells to give its
feet a good grip and to stop its legs from splaying. The shells were covered
with absorbant kitchen paper, which had to be changed every time it
defecated, which was usually three times an hour.

The temperature in the incubator was gradually reduced by a couple of
degrees each day until the chick seemed most comfortable at 85*F.
At eight days old, small black pin feathers had begun to show through
on its tail, wings and down its spine. It would preen these feathers con-
stantly, removing the protective sheaths as the feathers began to emerge.
At feeding times it would now become very agitated if its food was not
delivered quickly enough and its ration steadily increased to 5 ml an hour.
By 20 days, the young Touraco had nearly replaced its baby down with
black feathers, which, although preened regularly, always looked scruffy.
The chick was now moved into a large, unheated cage so that it could get
plenty of exercise. When let out to be fed, it would immediately try to
sample the numerous plants around the room.
Its mischievous antics were a delight to watch as it would always try to
scale the highest furniture in the room, and as it could only fly very poorly
this always resulted in it falling back and damaging its newly-developed
tail feathers.
At three weeks, it had begun to pick up small pieces of fruit and so it
was gradually weaned from the syringed food on to solid fruit. By five
weeks, it was fully independent and was, therefore, moved into an outdoor
aviary during the day and brought back in at night.
Now at five months old, it has moulted into a handsome bird with
perfectly formed legs, toes and feet.

most striking, if not the most beautiful of the African starlings. The
metallic blue, green and violet upperparts contrasting with the bright gold-
en-yellow underparts and long tapering tail, make this bird a treasured
avicultural species. Native to the arid acacia regions of Somalia and Kenya,
this magnificent bird can be seen in many U.S. zoos, but unfortunately it
is still breeding in only a few.

Lincoln Park Zoo received its Golden-breasted Starlings from Kenya
during July 1977. The birds are kept in a heavily planted free flight
exhibit approximately 31 metres long, 9 metres wide and 9 metres high,
with approximately 30 other species including Violet-backed Starlings
Cinnyricinculus leucogaster , Superb Starlings Spreo superbus , and White-
headed Buffalo Weavers Dinemellia dinemelli. In general, the birds coexist
quite well, the only skirmishes occurring when the Spreos had young at
which time they would aggressively chase other Starlings away from any
mealworms or crickets put into the exhibit. In addition to live food, all
of our starlings are fed an insectivorous mix, consisting of ground fruit,
egg, and meat with a multivitamin additive.
Our first encouraging sign with this species began in the spring of 1979
when they began displacing the Spreos at the food plates and at areas
where live food is provided. Soon nesting material, leaves, grass and
feathers, were being carried to a wooden nest-box about 5 metres off the
ground. The box measured 25 cm x 25 cm x 37 cm high with a circular
opening 9.1 cm in diameter.
When the eggs were laid, approximately 21 cm of nesting material was
in the nest-box. The eggs, usually three or four, are greenish blue with
reddish brown speckling. Since we could not determine precisely when the
eggs were laid without disturbing the birds, an exact incubation period
cannot be determined. Although eggshell is rarely found, a successful
hatch is usually determined by both adults carrying mealworms in their
bill to the nest-box. To counteract nestling mortality, the young starlings
(including Superbs) are generally removed from the nest at 10 days to
two weeks old for hand-rearing. This may also induce the adults to lay a
replacement clutch. The average weight of five chicks at 12 days old was
45.8 gm. Hand-rearing is difficult at first as the young are reluctant to
beg for food, however keeping them in a dark box and tapping lightly on
the side of the nest-cup prior to feeding will work, with patience. Nestlings
are hand-fed soft, white mealworms and a commercially prepared bird of
prey mix. Young Golden-breasted Starlings begin to eat on their own at
between three to four weeks old.
From 1979 to 1981 inclusive, twelve young were produced from our
breeding pair and send on loan to other zoos. Unfortunately, our breeding
female died in 1981. At the time of writing, a second female, received on
loan from the Denver Zoo, has hatched her first clutch of three eggs.

Tockus flavirostris
By B. MARSHALL (Kineton, Warwickshire)
I obtained a pair of Yellow-billed Hornbills in October 1982 and, as
they had come from an outside aviary, I had no hesitation in putting them
outside. Initially they were housed in a cage 4 ft x 2 ft (1 m 22cm
x 61 cm) to enable me to settle them down and get their aviary ready.
Their permanent aviary had to be modified before the Hornbills could
be put into it. It was originally an L-shaped construction in the top
corner of the garden and consisted of two 10 ft x 4 ft (3.05 x 1.22 m)
aviaries to which was attached a shed 6 ft x 4 ft (1.83 x 1.22 m) providing
inside quarters of 4 ft x 2 ft (1.22 m x 0.61 m) for each aviary. The
conversion was simple enough as all it entailed was moving the dividing
partition to give one aviary 14 ft x 4 ft (4.27 m x 1.22 m) for the Horn-
bills and one aviary 6 ft x 4 ft (1.83 x 1.22 m) for the original occupants -
three pairs of White-bellied Manikins. The foliage and perches were strip-
ped from the intended Hornbill aviary, except for small evergreens, and
the whole floor dug over. Large perches were then placed at either end of
the aviary. Two nest-boxes were fitted; one approximately 18 in x 18 in x
18 in (46 x 46 x 46 cm), filled to a depth of 6 in (15 cm) with a mixture
of peat and rotten wood and with a 4 Vl in (11.5 cm) diameter hole, was
placed at the end of the aviary nearest the shelter with the hole facing
down the length of the aviary. The other box, measuring 12 in x 12 in
x 24 in (30.5 x 30.5 x 60.1 cm), filled in the same way, and with the same
4 Vi in diameter hole, was fitted to the back panel of the aviary with the
hole facing the front of the aviary and the house.
Although not surgically sexed, I thought the birds were a pair. Whilst
the plumage was identical, one bird was noticeably smaller than the other,
having a smaller head and beak, and this I took to be the hen. From
subsequent behaviour, I was proved correct.
The birds were placed in the shelter part of their aviary and shut in for
about two weeks. On allowing them access to the aviary itself, the cock
bird was first to emerge, uttering what was later discovered to be an alarm
call. This alarm call was used frequently at times when he was unsure of
strangers or unusual happenings around the aviary. Having satisfied himself
that all was well, he then fetched the hen out and together they continued
to inspect every part of the aviary, including a cursory check of the nest-
boxes.
The pair over-wintered outside with no problems at all. Although we

did not have too bad a winter, they still had access to the shed which was
kept above freezing by two 12 in tubular heaters which were thermostati-
cally controlled.
In the early part of the spring, the birds showed a lot of interest in the
nest-boxes, though most of this interest seemed to be in the larger one and
consisted mainly of removing, and subsequently replacing, bits of the
filling material.
On 3rd June 1983, the birds were seen mating and for the next month
the aviary was a hive of activity during which time many alterations had to
be made. The birds were very tolerant of my continual interference,
albeit, in my opinion, for their benefit.
Despite all their attempts at shoring up the 4Vi in diameter hole in the
nest-box, they were having no luck at all. Obviously the average garden
mud was not suitable, and so a trip was made to the local hills with two
buckets. This resulted in some beautifully soft, very adhesive mud which
seemed ideal for the job but, unfortunately, this was not the case and they
were still having trouble getting it to adhere. At this point we decided to
remove the perch from the nest-box and nail bark to it, thus giving the
front at least the appearance of a tree and at the same time giving the birds
a much thicker area around the hole. The results of this modification were
immediately apparent as, within 24 hours, the entrance hole was getting
smaller. My own conclusions from this were that they were quite willing
to accept this artificial tree but the wood needed to be at least 1 in (2.5
cm) thick to allow mud, etc. to be plastered on. The Hornbills preferred
to cling below the entrance hole, as opposed to perching.
On 15th July 1983, the hen entered the nest-box and, with the aid of
the cock, sealed herself in, leaving only a slit about 3 in (7.5 cm) high
by Vi in (1.5 cm) wide through which the cock bird fed the hen religiously.
He seemed a lot more agitated at this time and whenever strangers ap-
proached the aviary, he would fly continuously backwards and forwards,
utttering his alarm cry.
On 19th August, five weeks after the hen had entered the nest-box for
the final time, chicks were heard in the nest-box. They seemed to under-
stand the sounds of their parents immediately, calling when the hen
had accepted food from the cock and going silent, no matter what, on
hearing the alarm call of the cock.
All went very well until about 24th or 25th September, when the
food intake began to drop. The cock bird was still as attentive as ever and,
as it was approximately 70 days since the start, I concluded that they
would probably be coming out very soon.
On the morning of 4th October, some 82 days after the hen had
been walled into the box, a hole no more than 2 in (5 cm) diameter was

knocked in the seal and she
emerged, very well feathered,
having moulted during her
enforced confinement, but
she was very thin.
The pair promptly set
about re-sealing the hole, but
not before it had been noted
that at least one well-grown
chick was in residence. It
took them about two hours
to restore the seal to its
former state, then the waiting
game continued.
On my arrival home from
work at about 5.30 p.m. on
4th October, 1983,1 checked
the Hornbills. The adults
were sitting on a perch
looking decidedly bored, and
close examination of the
nest-box showed the hole
to be completely sealed.
Something was seriously
B. Marshall wrong! Having read all that I
Yellow-billed Hornbill at 51 days could on the breedings of
T ockus, I knew there were no
records of this before. I decided to feed the birds and see if some fresh
food would stimulate them into opening up the hole and feeding the
chicks. Unfortunately this did not work. Although they did feed and
perched near the box, no attempt was made to open up the box. At
6.30 p.m. it was decided to bring any chicks that were still alive into
the house and hand-rear them.
The entrance hole was carefully broken open and a solitary chick was
found alive and well inside. It was also evident that other chicks had died
at some time during the rearing.
The chick weighed in at 150 grams and was almost fully feathered. The
beak was very much smaller than those of the parents, being only about
2 in (5 cm) long. It had a grey beak and its legs were grey black as in
the parents. The plumage was the same as the parents in colour although
the tail was a lot shorter. The actual boxy size was about that of a hen
bird. However, the pink wattles and bald facial skin were grey coloured

in the chick.
The chick, though very strong and extremely well fed, did not look
at all well and its eyes were glazed. It was placed in a hospital cage and
left for two hourse during which time it huddled in the corner of the
cage. When the time came to feed the chick, it seemed to have perked
up quite a lot and most certainly had a will of its own. The biggest prob-
lem with hand-feeding was probably the size of the chick's tongue as it
was only about one-third the length of the beak which meant that all the
food had to be placed well back.
Within 24 hours of being brought indoors, the chick was a changed
bird, refusing to stay still whilst being fed, preferring to perch on the
spar of a chair or on someone's shoe or arm. It showed all the signs of
its parents' curiosity and intelligence, it had the ability to pick food up
almost immediately but had some difficulty in tossing it from the end
of its beak and catching it at the back to allow it to be swallowed; its
success rate will obviously improve with age.
After three days, the chick was transferred from its hospital cage to
a 4 ft (1.22 m) show cage where it spends most of its time preening and
cursing anyone who gets too close. It seems to be settling down well.
On 8th October 1983 I removed the nest-box for inspection and found
inside a dead but well-formed chick of about five weeks, which could
possibly explain the lower intake of food in late September. Throughout
the rearing the cock had been passing large amounts of newspaper to the
hen and this was neatly layered inside the box, possibly being used to
absorb the very liquid droppings. The hen, as was mentioned earlier, had
moulted in the box. By the layering of newspaper in the box, it is pos-
sible to see that the hen did, in fact, moult prior to the hatching of the
chicks.
At all times, diced fruit was available to the birds, together with meat,
mealworms and crickets, and soaked sponge cage. Although the parents
fed on all of these foods, the chick was reared entirely on meat and live
food. Whilst the hen was sitting, I changed the meat content of their diet
from mince to what our butcher sells as dog mince. It consists of a variety
of meat bits and pieces which are apparently passed through a mincer with
larger holes. The Hornbills prefer this mince to the ordinary mince. It was
interesting to note that whenever the meat from a chicken wing was
offered, this was taken in preference to all other foods.
Why the chick was sealed in completely, I do not know and probably
never will. Next year, however, there are going to be some alterations to
the nest-box in that it will be positioned so that the hole faces north and
it will have a removable back partition with an inner glass cover to allow
me to check on the progress of things. I will also be able to remove any

dead chicks as the smell of the decaying chick may have been what trig-
gered the sealing of the box.
The filling in the box will be deeper for two reasons: firstly, because
the inmates are apparently supposed to eject droppings from the box
through the slit - with only 6 in (15 cm) of filling, they could not possibly
reach the slit which was some 14 in (35.5 cm) higher. This distance be-
tween the chick and the hole, despite the wooden struts inside the box,
may have made it impossible for the chick to climb out of the box with
the hen, had it wished to.
The chick, now some 10 days out of the nest, is feeding well, mostly on
dog meat with the occasional mealworm, but it is showing no signs of
eating any fruit or sponge cake. Despite being very tame and friendly when
out of its cage, the chick still insists on hissing and uttering alarm calls
when its food is placed in the cage, if it is in there.
It is not known at what age these birds achieve maturity but we hope
that a mate will be acquired in the not too distant future and another
generation can then be reared.

As described above, the Yellow-billed Hornbill Tockus flavirostris has been bred by
Mr. B. Marshall and this is believed to be the first success in this country. Anyone
knowing of a previous breeding in Great Britain or Northern Ireland, or any other
reason that would disqualify the claim, is asked to inform the Hon. Secretary.

By PATRICIA STOODLEY (Portsmouth, Hampshire)
At Broadhalfpenny Down Conservation Sanctuary we try not to carry
too many lame ducks'. It has been our policy for a number of years to
weed out parrots that are non-producers, or at least rear too few chicks.
The cost of labour, housing and food make it essential to utilise the aviary
space available to the best advantage.
Birds kept at the Sanctuary are mainly Amazon parrots, macaws and
Pionus parrots, and by retaining only the most prolific breeding birds in
the collection there is every possibility that the progeny will be equally
prolific as the parent stock.
Our strict programme to improve breeding in our stock would not be
looked on favourably by those who become attached to their birds and
cannot find it in their hearts to part with those that do not produce young.
Regrettably, no matter how engaging these parrots are, we cannot afford
the luxury of keeping them, and usually an understanding home is found
where they will be appreciated as pets.
Even with the best of care, breeding failures cannot be totally elimina-
ted. Occasionally a pair that has reared chicks successfully many times
before will fail to nest. Perhaps one or both birds will not be in good
enough condition to breed, or they may have infertile eggs or chicks
dead in shell.
We give particular attention to these pairs, first eliminating the possi-
bility of outside disturbance being the cause of the breeding problem -
cat, fox, hawk, rats, etc., can all prove devastating. The nest-box is also
inspected for dampness, mice, ants, etc., and also for structural damage
such as the bottom being chewed away.
If there are no obvious external reasons why a particular pair have
failed to breed, then attention is turned to the birds themselves.
We start,if necessary, with a worming programme. Then, although our
diet is not considered to be a contributory factor to poor fertility, since
it is used in general throughout the Sanctuary and the breeding results
here are way above average, any breeding pair failing to go to nest is
given higher concentrations of the vitamins and minerals essential to
high fertility. We find that the most effective method of providing these
additions in a palatable form is to increase the amount of kelp powder
and vitamin B12, also known as cobalamin, or cyanocobalamin, in the
diet.

The rations we feed generally contain a wide variety of beans and
peas: butter beans, black-eyed beans, chick peas, flageolet beans, green
garden peas, green whole lentils, haricot beans, kidney beans, lima beans,
soya beans, etc. They are soaked in water overnight and then heated to
boiling point. When cool, they are added to wheat, maize, pearl barley
and buck wheat. The latter is a grass seed and is not usually considered
to be a wheat. These cereals are also soaked in water overnight but are
not heated.
Fruit and vegetables are added. We use apple, carrot, celery, orange,
beetroot, garden greens, winter radish, boiled sweet potatoes, lucerne
and live twigs. Most of our parrots prefer bitter-tasting foods, and they
also relish dandelion plants including the roots. The mixture can be put
through a food processor and fed as a mash with a little meat, milk, fish
or broth, or it can be fed in its whole state.
We add a liberal sprinkling of kelp powder daily to each pair's dish
of food. The vitamin B12 is given in a little milk. We could feed it
poured over cake, rusk or bread, but our parrots willingly drink this
pleasant tasting liquid as a treat. Although soluble in water, B12 needs
to be combined with calcium for best results, and milk therefore makes
an excellent mixer.
Birds that are housed inside are given vitamin D3 in their food since
they are deprived of natural sunlight and therefore their bodies are
unable to effect the conversion of the precursor, 7 dehydro-cholesterol,
into D3.
Before the breeding season gets under way, the incubation room and
the brooder, or rearing room, are thoroughly cleaned. All accessible
surfaces are washed down with Aquasan. This is a liquid sanitising agent
for livestock drinking water, and is effective as a disinfectant, fungicide,
algicide and deodorant. It is odourless, non-irritating and non-toxic. More
commonly used in poultry and pig units to keep the drinking water clear
of slime and bacteria, it helps to prevent transmission of disease through
water.
To make doubly sure, the rooms are also fumigated with Microgen,
which is a pill source of formaldehyde gas and contains 90% formalde-
hyde.
During the breeding season, we anticipate having some 100 Amazon,
macaw and Pionus parrot chicks hatch in the incubators, this being only
a part of the total number reared. To achieve this success it is necessary
to acquire technique in the use of an incubator. Eggs of the larger parrots
are too valuable to adopt the 'happy Jack' approach of 'having a go and
hoping for the best'!
There are several commercial incubators on the market, but our units

have been purpose-built to suit our particular requirements. Eggs are
moved from incubator to incubator as they progress, and once hatched
the chicks are taken to the brooder room.
The 1983 breeding season started early for us at the Sanctuary with the
Scarlet Macaws A. macao , Blue and Yellow Macaws A. ararauna ararauna
and Green-winged Macaws A chloroptera all laying eggs in January. It was
a good year for our macaws: the Green-winged and the Scarlet produced
three clutches each pair, the first two clutches from each pair being
hatched in the incubators. We have only one mature pair of Blue and
Yellow Macaws and they produced Five clutches, a total of 17 eggs. These
were hatched in the incubators, and because the birds looked like nesting
again, the nest-box was closed up. So many chicks from a single pair of
macaws in one season is exceptionally high. The other macaws averaged
eight chicks per pair.
In early March, the first of the Amazon parrots produced eggs. These
were from the White-fronted Amazons Amazona albifrons albifrons. They
have been nesting here since 1979 and are always the first Amazons to
lay. Their eggs, if taken newly laid for artificial incubation, hatch within
24 days. Both the nominate race and the smaller subspecies A a. nana
produce double clutches.
Within a few days of the albifrons making a start, the Pionus come
into lay. Eggs from the Plum-crowned Parrot P. tumultuosus, the Bronze-
winged Parrot P. chalcopterus and the Coral-billed Parrot P. sordidus
corallinus are collected for artificial incubation. Their second clutches are
also taken, but the third clutches are left in the natural nest for the parents
to rear. The more common Pionus eggs are not collected for artificial in-
cubation because we cannot give time or space to these in the rearing
room.
The poorest nest was from a young pair of Buffon Macaws Ara mili-
taris ambigua. They hatched only two chicks, and since it was their first
year of parenthood, they were not permitted to have a second clutch.
During the season some 19 species of Amazon parrots were bred here.

The male Yellow-shouldered Amazon A. barbadensis barbadensis again
reared chicks, his hen being a Yellow-fronted A. ochrocephala ochro-
cephala. It is such a pity that we are unable to find a mate for him from
his own species.
The Finsch's and Parvipe are early nesting Amazons, dropping eggs
soon after the White-fronted. The Finsch's chicks at hatching have a small
beak unlike most other parrot chicks. The Parvipe chicks, although closely
related to the Double Yellow-headed, have a totally different call. It is a
delightful deep rich cluck-cluck which suits these rather large, heavy
Amazons.
The Salle's are fairly early nesting birds also, and their chicks each year
are just as spiteful as the adults. I do not know why we continue to work
with this species. In my opinion, they have little to commend them as
aviary birds. Once in good condition they become quite dangerous both
to their keeper and to each other.
It is interesting to watch a large mixed group of Amazon fledglings
feeding. Several food dishes are placed about the pen, and a truly mixed
bunch descend on the food, but all keeping well out of the way of the
Salle's Amazons who feed together. Any bird coming near their food dish
is soon sent away with a sharp peck.
Where large numbers of chicks are reared there is always a higher risk of
infection, and some zoos find it necessary to inject chicks at hatching
against pseudomonas.
The sanitant Aquasan that we use at the Sanctuary will kill pseudo-
monas, and not only is it used to wash down in the brooder room and
incubation rooms, but it is also used to wash hands and clothing before
handling chicks. Many of the household disinfectants do not kill pseudo-
monas, including the well-known brand of disinfectant used in the nursery
for washing and sterilising.
Outbreaks are usually airborne, and thrive in the warm humid condi-

tions of the brooder room. Unfeathered chicks appear to succumb more
easily than older ones. It is an airborne gram negative baccilus, and if not
treated the chicks die of septicaemia in a surprisingly short time.
There are many forms of pseudomonas, and our veterinary surgeon,
Mr. Andrew Greenwood, a member of this Society, has found the drug
Gentamicin highly successful in treating infected birds. Gentamicin is
nephrotoxic, and the patient must be kept fully hydrated using water
and electrolytes replacement therapy. Chicks at only a few days old make
a rapid recovery almost immediately after receiving the drug by injec-
tion.
Some breeders who contacted us during 1983 were also troubled by
outbreaks of Candida. This yeast fungal condition is usually first noticed
inside the mouth parts of affected hand-reared chicks and caged birds.
Candida in aviary birds is not as quickly detected, and all too often the
bird dies.
In the sanctuary the feeding of hand-reared chicks is as hygienic as we
can make it, and each chick is examined every day for Candida. The
mouth parts of the macaw chicks in particular, with their deep side
pouches, are wiped clean after every feed with a cotton wool bud dipped
in Miconazole which is supplied by our veterinary surgeon. It clears up the
most persistent 'deep in the crop' cases within a day or two.
This year we had some 60 young Amazon parrots and some Pionus
parrots surgically sexed, many before they were weaned. It is customary
to have this small operation carried out after the birds are a year old,
which necessitates carrying them over the year taking up aviary space
that could be put to other use.
Having our chicks sexed so young this season enabled us to keep
back unrelated birds required for breeding, and to place others where
wanted as tame young birds as soon as they were independent and before
they grew away from close human contact.
Isolated cases of misfortune and the resultant bad publicity have made
some people unsure about having their birds surgically sexed. When
approached on this subject I always give the same reply. It is said that
veterinary surgeons, like doctors, practice. Find one who has his first
1000 successful cases under his belt, and he will not be gaining his prac-
tice on your birds!
During the year we had several visitors from overseas. I would like to
mention just one - Professor S.W.J. Seagar, Associate Professor of Texas
A. and M. University, USA. Tie is engaged in major work with parrots,
and visited the Sanctuary to learn from our project. We learnt so much
from him during his visit, and were particularly interested in his work on
artificial insemination of parrots.

SOME ASPECTS AND PROBLEMS OF
SEXUAL DIMORPHISM IN BIRDS
By DEREK GOODWIN (Petts Wood, Kent)
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990617181818181" page_id="56319956"  page_num="48" year="" vol="">
As most readers will know, birds (and other creatures) are said to be
sexually dimorphic when the male and female differ markedly from each
other in size, shape or coloration. Strictly speaking, if the only marked
difference is one of colour, as, for example, in the Bullfinch Pyrrhula
pyrrhula or the Indigo Bunting Passerina cyanea it is more correct to say
that they are sexually dichromatic. In this article, however, I shall use the
terms "sexual dimorphism" and "sexually dimorphic" to cover marked
and immediately obvious differences between the sexes, whether these in-
volve only colour; colour, size and shape as in the Pheasant Phasianus col-
chicus and Peacock Pavo cristatus; or size alone (apart from small colour
differences) as in the Watercock Gallicrex cinerea and Great Bustard Otis
tarda.
I propose to discuss some generalities and examples and indicate some
problems. Hopefully, some readers might be able to give information lead-
ing towards answers.
In some birds the sexes are identical in coloration, if allowances for
plumage state and minor individual or geographical variations are made.
Usually cocks average a little larger than hens, have proportionately
slightly larger bills and their heads will tend to have a "bolder" or "coarser"
profile but not usually sufficiently so for a single cock or hen to be sexed
on its appearance alone. The Herring Gull Larus argentatus, Speckled
Pigeon Columba guinea and Java Sparrow Lonchura oryzivora are examples.

In many species, in which the sexes are often said to be alike, cocks are
in fact usually or always a little brighter than hens and/or have more
brightly coloured or differently coloured irides, orbital skin or bills, or
else have some of their feathers quite differently marked but not so as to
markedly alter their general appearance. The Common Partridge Perdix
perdix, Rock Pigeon Columba livia , Pink Cockatoo Cacatua leadbeateri,
Great and Blue Tits Pams major and P. caemleus each come into one of
these categories.
Naturally, for Nature has no consideration for Man or Man's concepts,
there are species showing sexual differences in brightness of plumage
really too great to be classed as "a little brighter" and yet hardly warrant-
ing inclusion among those with "marked and immediately obvious differ-
ences", the Mourning Dove Zenaida macroura and the Greenfinch Carduelis
chloris for example. As, however, such of these species whose behaviour
and ecology are known do not show any differences from relatives in which
the cocks are only "a little brighter" than the hens and which can be
attributable to their greater degree of sexual dimorphism, they will, for
present purposes, be "lumped" with the latter.
That justly renowned and perhaps most readable of all Victorian
naturalists, Alfred Russel Wallace, discussed at length the correlations
between sexual dimorphism (or its absence) and breeding behaviour in
birds in one of his many most interesting books ( Natural Selection and
Tropical Nature). Inevitably I, or anyone else who now writes on the sub-
ject must repeat, probably in less felicitous words, some information
already given by him. I apologise to both his shade and my readers for this
and to make amends urge the latter to read this and all Wallace's other
books at their earliest opportunity.
In general we find the following correlations between differences or
similarities between the sexes and the role of cock and hen in reproductive
behaviour:
(1) Where the sexes are alike or very similar in appearance, whether
they are cryptic or conspicuous, both sexes usually help to care for the
young and in many cases both sexes incubate the eggs and brood the
young.
There are, however, a number of species that are exceptions to this
general rule.
(2) Where both sexes are conspicuously coloured, even on the upper
parts , the nest is either roofed over or in some hole or other place where
the incubating bird cannot be seen from above except in the case of spe-
cies, usually large, which have few nest predators which the adults cannot

drive off and/or which nest in places where nest predators are not normally
a significant danger to the brood or the brooding or incubating parent.
The White Stork Ciconia ciconia, swans Cygnus spp., and the pied imperial
pigeons Ducula bicolor and A spilorrhoa are examples.
Of course, these evolutionary correlations of appearance and breeding
behaviour came about long before Man reached his present numbers,
world-wide range and destructiveness. He is often a very serious predator
on birds that come into this category.
I should perhaps add that building roofed nests and nesting in cavities
may have other functions beside concealment of the incubating parent(s)
and that it is not only brightly coloured speices, like bee-eaters Merops
spp. and kingfishers Alcedo, Halycyon , etc. that do so but also many
sombrely coloured species.
(3) Where the male is very much more conspicuous than the female and
the nest is open-topped (whether cup-shaped, saucer-shaped or nearly
flat) and not concealed in a hole or cave, only the female incubates and
broods the young. The male may or may not help to feed and protect the
young. On the whole the greater the difference between the sexes, the
greater the likelihood that the male will pay little or no attention to the
young. The Golden Pheasant Chrysolophus pictus is an example of the
latter and the Bullfinch Pyrrhula pyrrhula of those in which the cock helps
to feed the young.

There are some true exceptions to this general rule but a still greater
number of apparent exceptions. In these latter the male's conspicuous
markings may be on his face, breast or underparts, where they are hidden
from view when he crouches low in alarm on the nest when he has seen,
or the alarm calls of other birds have warned him, that a bird of prey is
about. The Masked or Namaqua Dove Oena capensis is an example. Or the
male's plumage, though much brighter and more conspicuous on an open
perch may be just as cryptic as (or no more obvious than) that of the hen,
when he is sitting on a nest among vegetation. This is almost certainly the
case with many (though not all as we shall presently see) of the fruit
doves of the genus Ptilinopus. Probably also with those brightly coloured
tanagers of the genus Tangara in which the sexes are alike or nearly so,
and which, so far as is known, all build open nests.
(4) "Lek" birds, that is those species in which, during the breeding
season, the males spend much of their time displaying, in association with
others of their sex, at particular (and usually traditional) display grounds,
which are visited by the hens for mating purposes only, commonly show
extreme sexual dimorphism in size, shape or colour, often all three. The
Capercaillie Tetrao urogallus. Sage Grouse Centrocercus urophasianus,
Ruff Philomacus pugnax and Blue Manakin Chiroxiphia caudata are
examples.
There are, however, some interesting exceptions to this rule - the Calf-
bird Perissocephalus tricolor , the Screaming Piha Lipaugus vociferans
(Snow, 1982), probably also the Great Snipe Gallinago (formerly Capella
media ) and some of the small, dull-coloured hummingbirds of the genus
Phaethomis. In all these species the cock advertise themselves by loud
calling and are much more vociferous than the hens but, of course, the
same is true of many "everyday" birds that form "typical" pair bonds.
(5) In all species in which the hens are markedly brighter (and usually
also larger) than the cocks, the hens take a very active role in courtship
and the cocks alone incubate the eggs and care for the young. The bustard-
quails Tumix, phalaropes Phalaropus and Pheasant-tailed Jacana Hydro-
phasianus chirurgus are examples.
It might be mentioned that although in most cases the more conspicu-
ously coloured sex is as big as or larger than the other, this is not invariably
so. In many birds of prey, especially some falcons Falco and sparrowhawks
and goshawks Accipiter the male is much smaller but also more brightly
coloured than the female, and in some birds of paradise the brighter male
is marginally smaller.

The above generalisations apply equally to birds in which the sexual
differences are constant throughout adult life and those in which they
depend in part or whole on a breeding plumage that is worn for only part
of the year. Included among those latter species are the Snow Bunting
Plectrophenax nivalis and Chaffinch Fringilla coelebs in which the colour
changes are brought about by a presumably genetically programmed shed-
ding of the ends of many of the head and body feathers.
Cock Snow Bunting Plectrophenax nivalis
Left, in autumn. Right, in the breeding season. The shedding of the feather ends, the
so-called "abrasive moult" changes the bird's appearance (when not in flight) from
predominantly huffish to vivid black and white. The bill also turns from yellowish
to black.
In many cases it is very easy to deduce probable reasons for the
generalisations listed above. A more conspicuous cock incubating or
brooding would be in greater danger of both his own life and that of his
offspring; tendencies to greater conspicuousness will soon be checked in
the hens of species in which the female incubates on an open nest and is
vulnerable to many feathered enemies. The lek system, in which the
dominant cocks who have the most central display positions copulate with
most or all of the hens, will clearly encourage or permit a degree of con-
spicuousness and increase of size that is useful in competition with other
cocks but would have too many drawbacks in a species that practiced one-
to-one pair bonds.

Peafowl Pavo cristatus (left) and Quetzal Pharomachrus mocinno (right)
In these two very different birds, the striking sexual dimorphism is primarily due
to the male's enormously elongated and ornamental upper tail-coverts which nor-
mally conceal the true tail.
In the Blue or Common Peafowl (shown here) the hen is much less colourful than
the cock but the same is not true of the related Green Peafowl Pavo muticus.
Only peahens incubate and care for the chicks but the brilliant cock Quetzal
shares incubation "duties", but in the concealment of a tree hole nest. The ends of
his long tail coverts may protrude from the hole and give away his presence to the
human hunter but it is likely that to any non-human predator it would be mistaken
for just one more bit of greenery in the mountain forest.

Often we find within the same family of birds some species in which
there is marked sexual dimorphism and others in which it is, respectively,
less marked, slight and virtually absent. In some of these, for example the
pheasants, partridges, etc., Phasianidae, such differences are often or
usually correlated with significant differences in breeding behaviour. But
this is not always so, or at least in our present state of knowledge appears
not to be. In describing some of these cases, I hope that readers will be
alerted to note any behavioural or ecological differences that they observe
and which might throw light on why some species have evolved a strong
degree of sexual dimorphism and others not.
Among the family Estrildidae, the waxbills, grassfinches, avadavats,
munias and their allies, we find almost every degree of sexual dimorphism,
at least as regards to coloration or lack of it. Yet, so far as we know, the
roles of the sexes in parental care are simialr in all species and all build
covered nests or else nest in holes so that the incubating parent is invisible
to a passing hawk or other predator.
Presumably in this family the advantages or disadvantages of sexual
dimorphism are not linked with the sexual roles in parental care. Sexual
differences in which the cock is largely red or brightly coloured tend to
be commonest in relatively unsocial species which live in pairs and many
in which the sexes are alike are highly gregarious. There are, however,
several exceptions. The Zebra Finch Peophila guttata, for example, is
highly social and strongly sexually dimorphic. I have elsewhere (Goodwin,
1982) suggested that there might be a premium on sexual dimorphism in
some social species if it permits quicker and more efficient pair formation
than might otherwise be the case but this is mere speculation and I hope
some of my readers will be able to offer at best definite information and
at worst fresh ideas on the subject.
It might be mentioned that the cordon-bleus show three different types
of sexual dimorphism or lack of it. In the Cordon-bleu or Blue-breasted
Waxbill Uraeginthus angolensis the sexes are almost or nearly quite alike
in colour in some populations; in others the female has less blue on her
underparts than the male. In the very closely related Red-cheeked Cordon-
bleu U. bengalus, the cock differs strikingly from the hen in having two
crimson cheek patches of which she shows not a vestige. He also has more
and usually brighter blue on his plumage, although there is a great amount
of geographic (racial) variation in the amount, brilliance and distribution
of the blue on face, breast and flanks in hens of this species. In the Blue-
headed Cordon-bleu U. cyanocephala the cock is much brighter and more
extensively blue than the hen but does not, unlike his red-cheeked rela-
tive, possess any colour or markings, no hint of which is present in the
hen.

Observations on a few individuals (anecdotal evidence of no statistical
significance, my critics tell me) suggest that the hen Red-cheeked Cordon-
blue may have an innate sexual recognition of the cocks of her species not
possessed by hens of the other two species (Goodwin, 1971). There is,
however, nothing in what little Is so far known of the ecology of the three
species to indicate why they should have evolved such differences as above
described.
The parrot family, Psittacidae, also show a wide range of sexual dimor-
phism or lack of it. In many the sexes are alike or differ only in the
colour of the iris, as in the Pink Cockatoo Cacatua leadbeateri, cere and
feet, as in the Budgerigar Melopsittacus undulatus , or relatively small
areas of plumage as in the Rose-ringed Parrakeet Psittacula krameri. In
others there is marked sexual dimorphism and in a few of these, notably
the Mulga Parrot or Many-coloured Parrakeet Psephotus varius, the cock
not only looks much more conspicuous than the hen when in an aviary,
but is very much more easily seen in his natural habitat. Yet all parrots
nest in holes (No, I have not forgotten the Quaker Parrakeet, it nests in
holes within the great communal nest of bitten sticks) so it is difficult to
see why the hens should need to be more cryptically coloured than the
cocks, as the hens of the Mulga Parrot and several other species most
certainly are.
Mention must be made here of the remarkable sexual dimorphism of
the Eclectus Parrot Eclectus roratus in which the cock is brilliant green
with scarlet flank patches and (predominantly) orange bill and the hen is
mainly darkish red and purplish blue. This is often instanced as a species
in which the hen is brighter than the cock, but I fully agree with the late
Duke of Bedford (the avicultural one) who once wrote in our magazine
that he did not consider a brilliant green, scarlet and orange bird less
bright than a dull red and blue one. Observations on captive birds indicate
that in this species, as in other parrots in which the point is known, the
cockatoos and the Cockatiel excepted, only the hen sits and is fed by the
cock. In the wild observations have suggested (Forshaw, 1978) that
several birds of both sexes are sometimes or usually involved with one
nest but, even if so, such sexual dimorphism is certainly not a usual
feature of species in which more than one pair attend a single nest or
its resultant young.
As with the estrildids, there is an open field for any observations that
might help us to understand why certain parrots are sexually dimorphic
and others not. I will add that although most predominantly green parrots
are very well camouflaged when among foliage, this is not always the case.
When in Australia I was surprised to find that the Budgerigar's predom-
inantly bright green and yellow plumage was highly conspicuous among

the dull greyish foliage of some of the trees of the Australian outback. The
same was true for the largely bright green Port Lincoln Parrot Barnadius
zonarius.
Within the pigeon family, Columbidae, we also find a complete range of
sexual differences and similarities of plumage. These birds differ from es-
trildids and parrots in that most of them build shallow, open nests in trees,
bushes or other vegetation. Of the relatively few species that usually nest
in holes or on ledges in caves, none are (markedly) sexually dimorphic.
The males of some of the sexually dimorphic pigeons are probably little
if any more conspicuous than the females to a passing raptor when they
are crouched "freezing" on the nest. This is hardly likely, however, to be
(or have been) the case with the Blue Ground Dove Claravis pretiosa and
the extinct Passenger Pigeon Ectopistes migratorius in which the cock has
bluish grey and the hen brown or greyish brown upper parts. Both share,
or shared, incubation in the most usual pigeon manner, the hen sitting at
night, early morning and evening and the cock during the middle hours of
the day. But the most marked sexual dimorphism seen in the pigeons is
that of the Orange Dove Ptilinopus (Chrysoena) victor in which the male
is bright orange with a greenish yellow head and the female dark green but,
strangely, with the head almost the same colour as her mate's. Recent
observations on a wild nest (W.N. Beckon, pers. comm.), on which the
cock was never seen incubating, suggest the possibility that this pigeon
may prove an exception to the general rule in that only the less conspic-
uous hen may incubate and brood. If so, it will be intriguing to discover
the parental behaviour of its close relative, the Yellow-headed Dove or
Green Dove P.(C) layardi in which both sexes are green.
A lot yet remains to be discovered about some pigeons and any avicul-
turists who breed a species whose nesting behaviour is not well known
should try to make observations on the roles of the sexes and times of
change-overs on the nest.
Unlike estrildids, parrots and pigeons, the woodpeckers, Picidae, are
seldom kept in captivity and certainly cannot be recommended as aviary
birds under any usual avicultural circumstances. They are, nevertheless, of
great interest in connection with questions of sexual dimorphism as I have
pointed out at more length elsewhere (Goodwin, 1968). For our purposes
they can be divided into wrynecks, which stand far apart from other
woodpeckers and consist of only two closely related species in both of
which the sexes are similarly coloured; the piculets, which are tiny tropical
woodpeckers with soft tails; and the typical woodpeckers which comprise
a great number of species, ranging from about the size of a Carrion Crow
Corvus corone to about that of a Tree Sparrow Passer montanus, spread
over the temperate and tropical parts of all continents except Australia,

and many islands adjacent to these continents. Most of them feed entirely
or partly by "woodpecking" in trees but some feed on the ground, like our
Green Woodpecker Picus viridis and a few even nest there, in earth or clay
banks. It is this largest group that I shall refer to as "woodpeckers" here.
The vast majority of woodpeckers show sexual dimorphism that
involves the cock having more red, or (less often) yellow, on his head than
does the hen. In some species the cock may only have a few red feathers
and the hen none at all, in others both sexes may have their heads largely
red but the hen with some small area brown, black-and-white, or black
that is red in the cock. In only a very few species are the sexes alike but
these few include species in which both cock and hen have an aproximately
equal amount of red on the head, as in the Red-headed Woodpecker
Melanerpes eryfhrocephalus and the Middle Spotted Woodpecker Picoides,
(formerly Dendrocopos) medius and Lewis' WoodpeckerAsyndesmus lewis
in which neither sex has any red (or yellow) on the head. In only three
species of woodpeckers are the sexes different without this dimorphism
involving red or yellow plumage. Only one of these, the Golden-shafted
Flicker Colaptes auratus, has any red on the head.
So far as I know, there are no observations to suggest that those wood-
peckers in which the sexes are alike, or nearly so for in some of them the
males are very slightly brighter than the females, differ significantly in
behaviour or ecology from their strongly sexually dimorphic relatives.
Juvenile woodpeckers usually show red or yellow on their heads in
their first plumage and very commonly are also sexually dimorphic. Often,

however, the red is differently placed to that of the adult. British readers
who have watched our commonest woodpecker, the Greater Spotted
Woodpecker Picoides (formerly Dendrocopos) major will, no doubt, be
aware of a common error in books on British birds. These often state
that juveniles of both sexes have the entire top of the head red, and
accompanying pictures often show the juvenile thus, with the red extend-
ing down over the area on the nape where the adult cock has a red patch,
which is absent (black) in the hen. In fact the juvenile cock Greater
Spotted Woodpecker has no red at all on his nape where the adult male is
red. Only his forehead and forecrown (entirely black in the adults of both
sexes) are red. His sister although generally similar to him usually has the
red confined to her forehead, hardly extending on to the crown at all.
The question of juvenile plumages in the woodpeckers presents many
points of interest but I must not dilate on them here. Suffice to say that
in a few species the juveniles are without bright colours at all and that, in
general, as regards the amount of red or yellow on the head, juvenile
woodpeckers tend to come nearer to the family average than do adults.
That is in many species in which the adults have a lot of red on the head
(whether in one or both sexes) the juveniles have less and vice versa.
The typical sparrows of the genus Passer present a somewhat anala-
gous case to the woodpeckers, at least as far as the adults are concerned.
In the Yellow Sparrow Passer luteus and the Arabian Yellow Sparrow
P. euchlorus, the cocks are largely yellow in colour and the hens mainly
brown and grey. They are sometimes placed in a separate genus Auri-
passer. Most other species have a different form of dimorphism, the cocks
having a black bib, more or less (according to species) like that of our
House Sparrow P. domesticus which is lacking, or only slightly indicated,
in the hen. Usually they have other less obvious plumage differences in-
volving chestnut, rufous or golden-brown on the head and/or mantle of
the cock which is replaced by paler and/or duller shades in the hen.
The main exceptions involve both "hen-feathered cocks" and "cock-
feathered hens". The former are represented by the Grey-headed Sparrow
Pgriseus of Africa and some of its close relatives, the latter by our fami-
liar Tree Sparrow (and it alone) in which the sexes are alike, both having a
black bib, black cheek patches and the top of the head a purplish choco-
late colour, which fades to pale chestnut in worn plumage. The behaviour
of both House and Tree Sparrows has been well studied but nothing that I
have read of their behaviour or ecology makes it clear why the sexes
should be alike, and similar to the males of related species, in one but not
in the other. Perhaps some reader will be able to throw light on the matter?
Waterfowl, ducks, geese and swans, show within the family most pos-
sible kinds of sexual dimorphism or, respectively, lack of it. They must be

among the most intensively studied birds in the world so I will confine my-
self here to just one, possibly a little neglected aspect of sexual dimorphism
among them. This is the difference in size between the sexes, which is
slight or absent in most, rather marked in some, and striking in others,
notably in the well-known Muscovy Duck Cairina moschata and some
(though not all) of its relatives.
In Muscovies (both wild and domestic) and in the Comb Duck Sarki-
diornis melanotos the male is about twice the size of the female. Recent
studies on the Comb Duck (to which I regret I cannot find the reference)
suggested that large size in drakes had been selected for because successful
males were able to mate with more than one female.
Most (though not all) of the waterfowl that show such extreme sexual
dimorphism are hole nesters and I have always thought that difficulties
in finding tree holes that were large enough and safe enough may have
been a factor that, in an evolutionary sense, had prevented the ducks from
keeping up with their husbands in the matter of size.
Perhaps some of our waterfowl-keeping readers will give us their views
on this?
Note: the diagrammatic sketches, illustrating some of the points des-
cribed in the text, have no pretention to art or a completely detailed

By PETER J. OLNEY (Curator of Birds)
How far the weather affects breeding results is not really known and
any correlation would be difficult to quantify accurately. Most aviculturists,
however, are usually more than willing to blame bad weather, be it too wet,
too cold, or too hot, for poor results.
Climatically 1983 was unusually interesting. A rather mild winter, with
an exceptionally mild January was followed in London by record rainfall
in April. England and Wales had the fourth wettest spring this century and
then a very hot summer, with London having its hottest weather since reli-
able records were first kept in 1840. How far all this influenced the breed-
ing of the birds in London Zoo is impossible to judge with any certainty.
There were, as always, many other factors which must have had an influ-
ence. My general impressions were that the mild winter encouraged early
display and nest building, but the wet spring caused low hatchability and a
number of prefledging deaths. Later layers and second clutches fared better
with higher fertility, relatively more successful hatchings and more success-
ful rearings. A number of birds laid early, but lost or abandoned their eggs
(e.g. Stone Curlew) or subsequently their young (e.g. African Thrush,
Lemon-rumped Tanager). Of the eggs laid by the Chilean Flamingos in the
spring, only one hatched, but of the six eggs laid in the summer, four
hatched and four were successfully reared. A similar pattern of events
occurred in the Abdim Stork colony, where, of the four first nests in the
spring, only one egg hatched, but in a later second clutch, both eggs
hatched and two young were reared.
Other parent-reared birds of note included: a Blue-crowned Motmot
from the same parents who, in 1982, reared two young; three Tarictic
Hornbills from a new breeding pair of which the male was reared here in
1979; Rock Peplar and Barraband Parrakeets in an outdoor colony of
these two species; an Oystercatcher from a pair in which the male was
reared here in 1978; Snowy Owls from a pair in which the male is at least
33 years old, having come to this collection in 1950, and fathered
48 chicks (this must be a record?) - he was rescued from the HMS Eros (!)
off the Azores, having flown on board. Other owls reared included Boo-
books, African Spotted, Abyssinian Spotted and Little Owls.
Artificial incubation and hand-rearing increases each year, even though
we have now got to the stage where we deliberately do not breed some
species because they are common enough not to be in demand. One of
the most satisfying successes in 1983 was the hand-rearing of seven South

African Crowned Cranes Balearica regulorum from three clutches incuba-
ted artificially. This success is an important development for although
cranes have been reared before in the collection, either at Regent's Park
or at Whipsnade, they have been the result of different management
techniques. Either the eggs and young have been left with the parents, or
they have been placed with domestic chickens who act as foster parents.
It has been part of our policy to concentrate efforts on crane breeding,
and this has included the building of aviaries off-public viewing at Whips-
nade. This policy, which has been immensely helped by laparoscope
sexing, appears to be succeeding. Four species - Red-crowned, Wattled,
White-naped and South African Crowned Cranes were bred at Whipsnade
in 1983.
A male Andean Condor was hatched and reared using the same proce-
dures as in 1982 when, for the first time in this country, a Condor was
reared. In 1983 the single egg was laid on 5th April, and after a few days
was removed to an incubator, where all went well until just before hatch-
ing. The egg had pipped, but because of the positioning of the beak, the
chick could not break out of the shell. On 2nd June, by carefully and
slowly removing parts of the shell with forceps, the chick was released
and emerged, healthy but rather tired-looking. He proved to be strong
and fast-growing, and somewhat larger than his sister of the previous
year.
Other artificial rearings of particular note included: two Ruffs, from
parents of which the female had been hand-reared here in 1980; five
Black-footed Penguins, which have now joined the colony of 19 birds of
which at least 12 have been bred here; an Oystercatcher; Chilean Tina-
mous, ducks, geese and many pheasants including Koklass, Swinhoe's,
Nepal Kalij, Siamese Fireback, Hume's Bar-tailed, Mikado, Scintillating
Copper, Cheer and Grey Peacock.
More and more cooperative schemes for the management and breeding
of various species are being put into effect, and as part of these schemes
a number of birds were sent to other collections, or were taken in on loan.
Examples of such movements included the despatch of 13 Lesser Flamin-
gos to the Wildfowl Trust, our male African Fish Eagle to Cricket St.
Thomas, and the receipt of two pairs of Rothschild's Grackles and a Red-
crested Turaco from Jersey.

THE BIRDS OF AFRICA. Volume 1. By Leslie H. Brown, Emil K. Urban

and Kenneth Newman. Academic Press, London, 1982. 521 pages; 28
colour plates; 4 black-and-white plates; many line-drawings and maps.
#53.40. ISBN 0.12.137301.0.
There are six volumes planned for this series (there may be a seventh on
the Malagasy region) and the aim of the authors has been to compile all
the available information about African birds, which they have found
scattered through a large, expensive, often unobtainable and now largely
out-of-date quantity of books; through the ornithological journals of
societies of many different countries, and in unpublished material such
as record card systems, collections of migration date and postgraduate
theses, as well as personal notes by the authors and many others The result
must certainly be the definitive handbook of African birds which will in-
clude every species occurring in this continent, migrants and vagrants as
well as residents. This first volume covers the orders from ostriches to
falcons.
This series was Leslie Brown's special goal and it is very sad indeed that
he did not live to see the first volume in its final form for it is a magnifi-
cent book, attractively designed and indispensable to anyone interested in
African birds.
Each resident bird has a distribution map and is described in full detail
with sections on its range and status, description, field characters, voice,
general behaviour, food and breeding biology. Visitors are also given ex-
tensive coverage.
The task of illustrating every bird has been achieved by Martin Wood-
cock and Peter Hayman in 28 colour plates. Whilst this method has its
artistic limitations (up to 40 species have been painted on some pages), the
paintings are useful and workmanlike. There are also four monochrome
plates and numerous line drawings. As one would expect, there is a superb
bibliography listing general and regional references as well as those for
each family of birds. In all, well worth saving up for.

Red and Yellow Diamond Doves
I would like to reply to Derek Goodwin's letter (Vol. 89, 1983, No. 2,
p. 121), since it was I who mentioned that red and yellow Diamond Doves
are common over here.
I just presumed that, since these two very attractive colour mutations
fetch only R20-30 a pair over here, they were common everywhere in
Europe. However, I cannot agree with Neville Brickell's description of
those he saw at Mitchell Park (a mixture of both colours and all ages).
The colours red and yellow can be likened to those same colours in the
domestic pigeon. The body colour is a little lighter grey than found in the
normal Diamond Dove, with the mantle and wings a pale yellow. Yellow
males seem to have a darker grey body colour than the females. Whereas
the red, to my mind the prettier of the two, has a light silver grey body
colour with the darker red mantle and wings. The red is a clear red, not a
brown red.
So the lighter bodied bird has the darker wings and the darker bodied
bird has the lighter wings - an attractive contrast. I can recommend them
to anyone who likes mutations.
We have other mutations here at Mitchell Park, including four colour
varieties of the Laughing Dove Streptopelia senegalensis including Pieds,
Black-eyed Whites, Cinnamons and Albinos - and there are quite a few of
these in aviaries in South Africa, also a few Pied, red and grizzle Rock

I would also be very interested to hear from any member who wishes to
dispose of bound volumes of the Magazine as very few of the volumes of

BREEDING PYGMY GEESE OF THE GENUS NETTAPUS
AT THE NEW YORK ZOOLOGICAL PARK

The genus Nettapus has been kept only rarely in captive collections.
Smallest of the waterfowl, they are generally weak competitors in a
mixed species flock. Highly aquatic, they do poorly on land and are very
vulnerable to predators. They prefer high tree hole nest sites and perches
and cannot function well if pinioned. They do not tolerate extreme cold
temperatures. This combination of factors makes pygmy geese difficult
to import and greatly limits the facilities where they can be successfully
housed and bred.
The New York Zoological Park has kept and bred two species of
pygmy geese: N. coromandelius , the Cotton Teal, and N. auritus, the

Nettapus coromandelianus coromandelianus
This is one of the smallest members of the Anseriformes. These birds
are found throughout Southeast Asia ranging from Ceylon, India and Chi-
na across Malaysia and Indonesia to New Guinea. Some populations are
quite sedentary but others, especially those in China, migrate several
hundred miles. Their flight seems awkward at times but they can manoeuvre
around trees as easily as Mandarin Ducks and their flight is quite fast. They
normally nest in tree hollows.
Cotton Teal feed preferably among floating vegetation, with small
leaves and seeds being the major part of their diet. They roost in trees at
night but spend most of the day on the water feeding much like coots.
Although large numbers are caught each year in India these birds sel-
dom survive transportation and the dietary changes of captivity. Once

acclimatised they do live quite well in captivity if they can be kept away
from predators. One full-winged female at Cleres lived six years and even
laid two eggs in 1932 in an aviary. Another bird lived nine years in an
outdoor aviary in England. Pinioned birds generally succumb sooner or
later to rats or other vermin. The New York Zoological Park felt quite
fortunate when a group of six were purchased from George Searles, a
private collector from Patchogue, New York, on 18th March 1971, These
birds were placed in a large heavily planted exhibit in our new World of
Birds building which was still under construction during 1971.
The birds were being fed a diet of soaked rice and millet as is generally
true of any waterfowl coming into the United States from Asia. Prior ex-
perience had shown that this diet is inadequate for any hope of keeping
these birds for a long period of time. We weighed all six birds immediately.
The average weight was 189 grams, but the birds varied from 168 to 238
grams.
We then set about altering the diet. Since the birds were eating only
soaked rice and millet we mixed a small amount of turkey pellets and
Gaines dog meal into the mixture, with a few mealworms and bits of
chopped kale added on top of each food pan. Since everything was soaked
the birds could not avoid eating some of the other items as they ate the
rice and millet. Gradually over a period of two months we increased the
amount of turkey pellets and Gaines dog meal while decreasing the
amounts of rice and millet. One of the smallest birds died after a short
period at the Zoo, but the other birds thrived on their new diet and in
their new home.
The exhibit itself is over 10 m in diameter and height. It is heavily
planted with Ficus trees and lower ground plants such as Diffenbachia,
ginger and Spathaphylum. A pool covers nearly 30 percent of the floor
area and is where the pygmy geese spend much of their time.
The young birds thrived and moulted into adult plumage early in 1972.
At this point it became apparent that we had four females and only one
male. The male was not in good condition and had a displaced wing. This
male lived for four years but was never able to mate with any of the
females. When the male died in February 1976, we began the search for a
new mate and in April 1977 we acquired two males from the Wildfowl
Trust in England. The new males immediately started courting the females.
Within a couple of months the first egg was found in the pool. A female
was regularly seen perched in the trees during the following two months.
On 28th August 1977, a clutch of two eggs was found in a beautiful
down-filled nest in a hollow tree cavity, approximately six feet (two
meters) above ground level. The female incubated until 10th September
when she was observed off the nest. When the female did not return to the

eggs within two hours, the eggs were removed and candled. Both eggs had
been fertile but apparently the female had abandoned the nest the previous
day as both embryos were dead. No further nesting activity occurred in
1977.
The female began to spend a lot of time perching in the trees during
late spring and summer of 1978 and she was observed carefully as she
nested during July. On 1st August she emerged with three ducklings. One
duckling caught its leg on the edge of the pool and was removed for over-
night observation. When the chick seemed well the following day, it was
returned to the exhibit with the female and the other two ducklings. The
third chick was unable to keep up and feed with the other chicks and it
died two days later. Quantities of live crickets and mealworms were
supplied during the month of August to supplement the adult diet. The
chicks appeared to start eating duckweed ( Lemna ) in a shallow pool and
it seemed to be the major item of their diet for the first few weeks. Duck-
weed was mixed with the adult diet and the chicks quickly acquired a
taste for turkey pellets and Gaines dog meal.
The two chicks grew rapidly and within six weeks were indistingui-
shable from the adult female. On 7th September, the chicks were banded
and weighed. They weighed 236 and 220 grams and seemed in good
condition.
As far as we can determine, this is the first successful breeding of this
species in captivity.
In 1979 a clutch of six eggs was laid. Six hatched and six were reared in
the original exhibit.
In 1980 a female was noted missing during the breeding season. On a
Friday, the day the female was not observed, we felt she might be nesting
but we did not want to cause a major disruption. After the female had not
been seen over the weekend we carefully searched the exhibit but found
no sign of her. We still hoped that she was carefully hidden on a nest.
Two days later the male bird was also gone. We have never found out
what happened to the pair but have assumed that they were stolen. We
immediately instituted additional security measures, and moved the remain-
ing birds to a glass-fronted exhibit.
In 1981 a young pair produced two clutches of infertile eggs.
In 1982 the young pair produced two clutches of eggs from which six
chicks hatched. None were successfully reared in their new exhibit with a
deep pool and plenty of duckweed.
In 1983 we traded birds with Doug Goode and Mike Lubbock to pair
up our young birds. The young birds have produced a clutch of infertile
eggs.
Now we shall prepare for 1984.

The first captive propagation of African Pygmy Geese was at the pri-
vate collection of Winston Guest, on Long Island, New York. Mr. Guest
imported his birds in 1973 and two of the imported birds were donated to
the Zoo. The birds were kept in a heavily planted indoor exhibit, about
35 x 25 x 20 ft (10.68 x 7.63 x 6.10 m) . The cage floor is about 8 ft
(2.44 m) below the visitors' viewing area. The viewing area is an open
front, with plantings between it and a pool, approximately 10 ft (3 m) in
diameter and 18 in deep. There is a 10 ft planted area behind the pool.
Other exhibit inhabitants include a pair of Malayan peacock pheasants and
about 20 small passerines. The exhibit gets natural light through a skylight.
This is supplemented in winter with flood lights to provide a minimum of
12 hours of daylight.
The African Pygmy Geese laid their first clutch in September 1979.
The parents incubated and hatched one duckling from a clutch of eight.
This bird lived only one day. No eggs were laid in 1980. In 1981, 7 eggs
were laid in mid-August. Six hatched, but the parents failed to rear them.
The exhibit had been heavily supplied with duckweed. In July 1982, six
eggs were laid and all hatched on 12th August. The female was removed
and placed in a water brooder with three ducklings; the other three were
placed in a separate brooder. Because the female was too nervous, she was
placed back in the exhibit the next day, with the ducklings that had been
with her. Large amounts of duckweed were provided. Both members of
the pair then attended the young which swam and appeared to feed. All
died within the next day, however, and were found to have no food in the
gastro-intestinal tract. We had had similar problems with a clutch of Cot-
ton Teal which had appeared to be feeding well on duckweed, yet appar-
ently died of starvation. All but one remaining duckling failed to respond
to intensive efforts to induce feeding and died. The last bird fed readily
and was reared to adulthood. The pair re-nested in late September 1982
and laid six eggs. It was decided to pull these before hatching for hand-
rearing. The ducklings began to hatch at 6.00 p.m. on 18th October, and
immediately were exposed to a human hand and vocalisation to induce a
following response. A total of four ducklings hatched. They were placed
in a duck brooder measuring 8 x 4 x 2 ft (2.44 x 1.22 x 0.61 m) with a
removeable pool and adjustable heat lamp, and maintained at 85-88*F. A
heating pad was placed under the chicks after the first two days. Duck-
lings were marked with food colouring for identification and could also
be distinguished by size differences. The birds were weighed at the start
of every morning.

Early observations seemed to show that ducklings dabbling in water with
floating duckweed ingested water but that duckweed itself was of too large
a size to be ingested. Eventually, using a very shallow pan filled with a
tepid slurry of two parts powdered turkey pellets, one part powdered
Gaines dog meal and eight parts water, it was possible to induce feeding
by churning the mixture up near the chicks, simulating the action of the
parent's feet. The ducklings themselves would churn with their feet while
feeding. Initially the birds would feed only in water. Particles sifted on the
water surface in front of the ducklings could be seen to flow into the
mouth. It was necessary to add water occasionally as the food particles
absorbed moisture. New food was prepared three times a day. Approxi-
mately every two hours, nine times a day, food was presented. By vibrating
fingers through the water (about seven oscillations per second) the duck-
lings could be attracted to feed. This noise perhaps imitates the sound of
an adult dabbling. After seven to ten days it was possible to induce feeding
from the edge of the pan by generating currents of particles. The birds
still required a splashing noise or feeding would terminate prematurely.
During the first four days, while techniques were being developed, the
chicks did not eat enough to produce good weight gains. They were sup-
ported during days 5-10 by supplemental tube feeding. A mixture of one
tablespoonful of dry Gerber Hi Pro baby cereal, 1.5 gm Nutrical (a high
calorie veterinary supplement) and 17 cc water, heated to 100*F was
administered, 0.4 ml per bird, up to five times a day. Each bird was
treated differently, depending on its speed in developing self-feeding.
By the time the chicks were three weeks old, the large feeding pan had
been replaced by petrie dishes of wet feed and water and the ducklings
were swimming. None of the birds would feed itself until at least 21 days
and the last bird was about 30 days before it was feeding independently.
The feed at this time was still powdered pellets but with only so much
water as would be absorbed in half an hour.
The techniques described here represent a learning experience. Pygmy
Goose ducklings evidently are small particle strainers and most individuals
do not adapt readily to our standard rearing techniques which use dry,
crumbled pellets. It is worth noting that parent rearing (of Cotton Teal)
has been successful only in an exhibit with a shallow back pool. Failures
have taken place in exhibits with deep, well-scrubbed pools, where no
particulate matter would be available for parents to churn up for their
brood. Supplemental tube feeding was very useful in a case where diffi-
cult chicks were feeding, but not sufficiently. We hope to improve and
standardise these techniques in 1984.

In our winter programme of 1982 it was decided to rebuild a large run
of aviaries. The first to be completed was the toucan flight which was
some 20 ft by 10 ft wide with a height of 7 ft 6 in (6.10 x 3.05 x 2.29 m).
A feeding area measuring 5 ft x 4 ft x 7 ft 6 in ((1.53 x 1.22 x 2.29 m)was
built at one end, next to the service door. Perches were placed so that the
occupants had to fly the whole distance of the flight to be able to feed
from the feeding perch.
Several plants were bedded and the ground area grassed over, excluding
two small areas in which shallow water baths were placed.
A grandfather-type nest-box, the height of the aviary by 1 ft 4 in
(0.40 m), was built of % in marine ply and placed in the right hand corner
as far away as possible from the public. The entrance hole of 4 in
diameter faced the length of the aviary. An inspection door 2 ft from the
base was included and, to help conceal the box from the public, bamboo
was planted around it.
While the aviaries were being completed, a hen Toco Toucan which had
laid in previous years was being housed in an aviary alongside our tropical
house, where she could easily be shut in at night if the weather turned bad.
This bird had always been in excellent condition throughout our time
working at the park.

As the new aviaries were nearing completion, we took the opportunity
of buying a newly-imported male that had been surgically sexed. The bird,
a fine specimen, was heavily clipped on its left wing by trappers after being
caught, which slowed him down considerably.
He arrived at the park on 28th February 1983 and was kept on his own
for two weeks so that we could observe his behaviour and feeding habits.
All proved satisfactory so, on 15th March, he was moved to an aviary
adjacent to the hen's. This went well but a period of very wet weather
forced us to lock them inside for a couple of days. When the weather did
break, the birds were let out in the early morning and at once the male
displayed to the hen. After several mornings this became a routine with
the hen responding at times by clapping her beak and calling to the male.
The nest-box in the new aviary was being made ready by the placing of
nesting material which consisted of 9 in of wood shavings and then 1 ft of
peat, followed by another 9 in of rotten wood shavings. This was repeated,
layer upon layer, until within 4 in of the hole.
On 13th April both birds were released into their new aviary, where-
upon the visual differences between the sexes became apparent. Princi-
pally it is the larger bill size of the male but he also has a larger black spot
at the tip of the bill and a bolder black marking at the base; it was also a
darker shade of orange towards the tip. There was also a slight difference
noted in the call of the male.
By midday all was going well and there was no signs of stress or fighting
between the birds and both had found the feeding area with little trouble.
The diet offered consisted of a softfood which is made fresh every day
in the park for all our softbilled birds. This consists of a basic mixture of
brown bread, grated carrot, apple and turnip or swede when in season; a
small amount of dried insect mix is added plus crushed Diet A pellets and
SA 37 multi-vitamin powder.
The toucans receive one 9 in round dish and two 4 in hang-on type
dishes, placed either side of the feeding perch. In the morning these are
filled with our softfood mix plus chopped fruits such as apple, banana,
pear, grapes and a small amount of orange, and other fruits when in season .
Mealworms are given as is a small amount of minced meat or sausage meat,
rolled into small balls. Chopped day-old chicks are fed twice weekly.
Mice are also given. Dishes are topped up mid-afternoon with dried insect
mixture.
By 15th April both birds were observed in and out of the nest-box and
the hen was seen to drop nesting material some 16 ft from the nesting
area. The box was checked on 20th May and it was found that about
2 ft 9 in of the nesting material had been removed. Both birds were seen
to visit the nest over the next 10 days and mid-afternoon on the 30th

attempted mating took place. A display routine was performed which
consisted of bill clapping and the moving of the head and bill simul-
taneously by both birds in the same direction. Calls were very aggressive.
The box was checked again on 5th May and found to have a small
scrape about 3 in wide but there seemed to have been no more nesting
material removed. By the 19th the hen looked very swollen around the
vent and a close watch was kept on both her and the box. Both birds were
seen to leave the nest very early on the morning of the 22nd and inspec-
tion revealed one egg. The hen was observed to enter the nest for short
spells only for the remainder of the day.
Next day, the hen stayed in the box for most of the morning, only
vacating to feed. Another inspection revealed a second egg and at this
stage the cock became very aggressive. Each time the hen left to feed,
the male would take up a position in front of the entrance hole as if
he was on guard until she returned.
She stayed in the box all day on the 24th, apart from feeding in the
early evening. An inspection next day revealed a third egg and this was
taken to be a full clutch. The eggs are white in colour. From 25th May
to 8th June very little was seen of the hen other than the 20 minutes or
so when she left to feed. Food intake increased on 8th June and over the
next four days the male spent short spells in the nest-box and, as the hen
was seen very little over this period, it was thought that he was feeding her.
The hen was away from the nest for long periods on 12th June and the
male was taking little interest so it was decided to investigate. To our dis-
appointment no eggs were found but shells picked up at the base of the
box showed signs of having formed chicks in them. Incubation period was
in the region of 21-22 days for the first egg laid.
It was a disappointment to all concerned with the breeding but the box
has been reset and we are hopeful of success in the future.

an eight- or nine-year old hen breeding successfully being not uncommon.
The cock is vermilion red on the breast and rump. The back is similarly
coloured and marked with black pencilling. The head, upper parts of the
neck, tail and wing feathers are all black and the flights bear the charac-
teristic red colour flash.
The hen, although less briliantly coloured, is, nonetheless, very
attractive, being mainly grey throughout with flashes of red on the rump,
the upper breast and the face. The wings display the characteristic red
wing flash as in the cock.
Three years ago, I managed to acquire a pair of these delightful birds
and after having had them for about five months, I put them together in
early April as they were showing signs of wanting to go to nest. The cage
used was the box-type version and its dimensions were approximately
4 x 2 x 2 ft (1.22 x 0.70 x 0.70 m). I fixed a canary nest-pan high up in
one of the corners of the cage and provided the usual nesting materials
given to canaries. The hen subsequently went on to lay two clutches; one
of four and the other of six eggs. The eggs were laid on consecutive days
and were smaller in size than a canary egg, being chalk white in colour and
very similar to those of the Bengalese. Unfortunately, all ten eggs were
clear and later on that year the cock died, followed by the hen two
months later. Although I was extremely disappointed, this fleeting exper-
ience made me more determined than ever to be successful with the Black-
Hooded Red Siskin. The opportunity would come my way much sooner
than I thought.
In January 1983 I was extremely fortunate to acquire, through a local
dealer, a cock and two hens. The two hens were kept together in the
previously mentioned box-cage and the cock was housed in a smaller cage
by himself. I installed a tubular heater in order that the temperature did
not fall below 70*F. With the aid of artificial lighting, "daylight" was
gradually extended to 15 hours.
On 13th February a nest was placed in each of the four corners of the
box cage. Following the very welcomed advice of a local British bird
breeder , the nests were "natural" and provided plenty of privacy for the

birds. The nest-pans were suspended from the cage roof by wire frames
which were surrounded by plenty of foliage. Nesting material was also
provided.
By this time the two hens were becoming increasingly aggressive to-
wards each other and on 15th February I removed one of the hens and
introduced the cock bird into the breeding cage. The pair soon settled
down and the cock was seen feeding the hen. The following day the cock
was seen entering one of the nests on repeated occasions and distinctly
"calling" the hen from within, the nest. When, he emerged from the nest,
the cock would have nesting material held firmly in his beak with his
plumage all puffed out in display. He would then break into an. arduous
song and chase the hen who would invariably ask to be mated. Within
two days the nest was ready and on 23rd February, exactly a week after
they had been paired up, the first egg was laid. The following day, how-
ever, disaster struck. The hen was found lying on the cage floor and it was
only too apparent that she was eggbound. Gil was applied liberally round
her vent and then she was placed in a show cage situated near the heater.
Thankfully, a few hours later the egg was passed. The hen, however, was
in very poor condition after this ordeal and was placed on her own in a
</bodyText>

flight cage to recover. The eggs were placed under a canary hen and turned
out to be addled.
* Two days later, on 26th February, the second Siskin hen was introduced
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99108555" page_id="56319995"  page_num="77" year="" vol="">
to the cock and they mated immediately. The same general behaviour was
observed as with the first hen. In this instance, however, the cock was
much more dominant and I believe this can be attributed to the fact that
the second hen had been introduced into "his" territory whilst in the first
pairing, it had been the reverse.
On 3rd March the first egg was laid and this was followed by four more
on consecutive days. The eggs were removed as they were laid and replaced
with plastic dummy eggs. The hen did not seem to mind this daily intrusion
and would return to her nest a few moments after the exchange of eggs
was effected. On 8th March the clutch was set and throughout the incuba-
tion period the hen was rarely seen out of her nest. The cock was always
in attendance and on numerous occasions was seen feeding the hen in the
nest.
On 20th March, one chick hatched and I decided to foster it out to a
pair of canaries which were proven feeders. The following day a second
Siskin chick hatched and was left with its parents. By 23rd March it was
apparent that the fostered chick was not doing too well and, in fact, it
required to be hand-fed at approximately hourly intervals. Two days later
this chick&amp;apos;s condition had deteriorated considerably and, more in hope
than anything else, I returned it to the Siskin hen. The following day a

quick look at the nest revealed that the two chicks were alive and making
progress. The change in condition of the chick which had been fostered
was unbelievable! Everything continued to go well and on 29th March,
when the chicks were eight and nine days old, I inspected the nest
again. Both chicks were already nearly fully-feathered. Their plumage
was rich yellowish brown on the chest with black flights and tails. The
characteristic red wing flash was brown.
On 5th April both chicks left the nest and a week later were seen
eating millet spray on their own. By this time the hen had started to
build another nest and the cock was becoming increasingly aggressive
towards the chicks. On 16th April, at the age of 25 and 26 days, the
Siskin chicks were removed and placed in a stock cage, together with
two canary chicks which had also been separated from their parents on
the same day. The chicks were soon picking up food and were weaned
without any problems.
On 20th April, the first egg of the second round was laid and this
was again followed by a further four eggs. The same routine followed as
in the first round and on 6th May three chicks hatched. All went very
smoothly and on 12th May the three chicks were close-rung. As a matter
of interest, one of the chicks (which subsequently turned out to be a hen)
was smaller than its siblings and needed to be rung again two days later
as the original ring had slipped off. On 22nd May, when they were 16 days
old, the three chicks left the nest and on 1st June they were separated
from their parents. The following day I noticed that the three chicks were
not feeding themselves properly. I was tempted to return them to their
parents but decided against this form of action as the cock bird had al-
ready become very aggressive towards the chicks. Instead, I removed the
hen from the breeding cage and put her in the same stock cage with her
chicks. Much to my relief, she started feeding them immediately.
The first Siskin hen, which had become eggbound, was now fully
recovered and on 4th June I introduced her again into the breeding cage.
The cock mated immediately and five days later the hen laid the first of
three eggs. I had noticed that the hen was not sitting on the dummy eggs
and consequently decided to place the three Siskin eggs under a canary
hen which had previously reared four chicks when paired to an F2 Siskin
hybrid cock. Unfortunately no chicks hatched from the three eggs, one
being addled and the other two dead in shell.
By early August it was obvious that I had bred four Siskin cocks and
one hen. When they started to lose their juvenile plumage, black specks
appeared around the head and neck of the young cock birds. When in
juvenile plumage there is no difference between the sexes although the
hen I bred was definitely smaller than her brothers.

As a general observation, I should say that not once did I see the Siskin
cock feed the chicks, either at the nest or when they had fledged. He
would, however, feed the hen tirelessly. The Siskin hen was an excellent
feeder and on the few occasions she left the nest for more than a few
minutes, the cock would make sure that she soon returned to her duties!
The basic diet of my Siskins consists of a combination of canary mix-
ture and a British finch mixture. To this I add a teaspoonful per bird of
niger and condition seed. Maw seed and small millet are sprinkled over the
mixture. I also pass dog "Meat Munchies 5 through a coffee grinder and
sprinkle some of the resulting "meat powder 5 &amp;apos; over the seed mixture.
A sprinkling of insectile food is also added. A millet spray is provided
for each bird and this is really enjoyed. Lettuce leaves and apples are
favourites and a bath is provided two or three times a week. When
the chicks were being reared I offered the adult birds some soaked seed,
grated cheese, hard-boiled egg and various proprietary canary-rearing
foods. The birds did not show any interest in these foods and the
practice was discontinued. When the young were in the nest four or five
millet sprays were consumed every day, together with half an apple and
a considerable amount of thoroughly washed lettuce leaves which the
birds really relish. When the chicks hatched, livefood was offered in the
form of ants 5 eggs, small mealworms and termites. The first two were not
taken but, for the first five days after her chicks hatched, the Siskin
hen consumed large numbers of termites. After the fifth day the rate of
consumption dropped considerably and by the seventh or eighth day the
hen would no longer be interested in this valuable source of protein.
In order to increase fertility, a Vitamin E solution is added to the drink-
ing water twice a week.
As a result of last year's success I now possess five cocks and three
hens. At the time of writing, the three hens have already been paired up
(a young cock with his mother, the young hen with her father and a young
cock with the unrelated flighted hen). All three hens have now built their
nests and should begin laying their first eggs within the next few days. As
you can imagine, I am really looking forward to breeding more of these
birds and the knowledge of the very real danger of their extinction has
given an added impetus to my determination to achieve my ambition of
building a free-breeding stud of Black-hooded Red Siskins.

There appears to be very little of detail written on the breeding in
captivity of the Chestnut-breasted Finch. The few books which mention
the species give only vague details and all emphasise that these finches
will not breed under cage conditions.
It is obvious that the authors of certain titles which have been pub-
lished over the past few years not only have not bred Chestnut-breasted
Finches, but have not kept up to date with the avicultural literature.
Otherwise they would surely have been aware that the species is fre-
quently being bred under cage conditions.
Not all aviculturists have facilities for aviaries and one wonders how
often such people have been deterred from keeping a species through
reading misleading statements made in what they presume to be up-to-
date books.
Nowadays I specialise in breeding Gouldian Finches Chloebia
gouldiae , but to add a little more interest each season, I do keep and
attempt to breed from one or two pairs of a different species. Last season
I decided on Chestnut-breasted Finches.
First nest
A guaranteed pair was purchased in June (1983) and immediately
housed in a box cage 91x41x41 cm. The birds proved rather shy, due
no doubt to having previously been housed in an aviary. They never com-
pletely lost their shyness, although the young they produced, once in adult
plumage, proved most confiding.
Before the birds were released into their cage, a nest-box was hung in
the right hand rear corner of the cage. The birds roosted in this from the
beginning. Soft hay had been placed in the nest-box, but within a matter
of days the birds had removed most of it and appeared to be searching
around the cage for nesting material.
As both birds took a keen interest in the nest-box, I collected some
newly-mown grass from the verge of a country lane. This appeared more to
the birds' liking and within a matter of days, the pair had built a globe-
like structure inside the nest-box. Within five weeks of purchase, the
Chestnut-breasted Finches had five eggs. They appeared to take little
interest in them, however, and because of this I removed the eggs and

placed them under Bengalese, giving the latter's clutch to the Chestnut-
breasted. It was most fortunate that I did this as, within three days, the
Chestnut-breasted had begun to incubate the Bengalese eggs in earnest
and I was able to return their own clutch to them, giving the Bengalese
eggs back to their rightful owners.
As already mentioned, the Chestnut-breasted Finches were rather shy
and because of this, whenever I entered the birdroom, whichever bird
was incubating at the time would immediately leave the nest. Be this as
it may, all five eggs duly started to hatch 12 days after incubation and
within two days all five had hatched successfully.
As this was the first time that I had attempted to breed Chestnut-
breasted Finches, I decided to make a photographic record of the growth
of the chicks and when they were four days old, I removed the nest-
box, opened the hinged lid and photographed the chicks for the first
time.
When the chicks were seven days old, the parent birds ceased to brood.
From experience with a further nest, I feel that this was a little early.
However, we were experiencing extremely warm weather at the time and
this no doubt had some influence on the parent birds.
As I always close-ring Gouldian Finches at 10 days old, I fully expec-
ted the Chestnut-breasted Finch chicks to be ready at the same age.
However, upon inspecting them at nine days, I found they were a little
large for close-ringing and experienced great difficulty in doing so.
Indeed one of the chick's toes bled during the operation.
By the time the chicks were 19 days old, the cock was seen to court
the hen continually and mating was seen to take place on numerous
occasions.
The chicks left the nest-box at 22 days. This I felt was a little prema-
ture and believe it was due to my accidentally knocking the nest-box while
feeding the birds, as the moment I touched the nest-box, the youngsters
exploded from it. However, it appears that the Chestnut-breasted chicks
do leave the nest at this age (see second nest). Due no doubt to the
chicks leaving the nest-box through disturbance, they did not return to
it for a couple of days, but spent most of the time sitting on top of it.
Newly fledged chicks are quite small, being nowhere near the size of
an adult. Indeed they do not appear to attain full adult size until they
have completed their first moult (from immature to adult plumage).
Not only are newly fledged chicks quite small, their plumage is far
from complete, the tail feathers being very short and pin feathers abound,
especially around the head and neck.
At five weeks of age, the chicks were removed from their parents and

placed in a large box cage 1.8 m x 41 cm x 41 cm. They settled well and,
due no doubt to being away from the rather shy parent birds, became
quite steady. At eight weeks a youngster was seen to sing for the first
time. It was immediately caught up and fitted with a split ring. Four weeks
later, two more were observed singing and these too were fitted with split
rings. All the first round chicks were in full adult plumage by the time
they were 16 weeks old.
Second nest
After removing the first round chicks from their parents, the breeding
cage was thoroughly cleaned. The nest-box was also cleaned, refilled with
fresh hay and placed in position.
The pair were so eager to go to nest again that they accepted the hay
placed in the nest-box, adding only a little extra from the small amount
placed on the floor of the cage. Within a day of removing the first round
chicks, the breeding pair had one egg. Three days later they began to incu-
bate. Both birds sat more "tightly" than they had with their first round
(due no doubt to becoming more used to me and to their surroundings).
Upon checking the nest-box two days after incubation commenced, they
were found to have a clutch of five.
Thirteen days after incubation commenced, a chick was found on the
floor of the far corner of the cage. It had not been fed and appeared to be
about 24 hours old. I placed it in the nest-box and the parent birds
appeared to accept it. However, two days later, the cock was seen to
push the now dead chick through the bars of the cage where it fell to the
birdroom floor.
As it was obvious that the chick had never been fed, I decided to check
the nest-box. Three chicks were in evidence; two with food in their crops
and one obviously newly-hatched. The fifth egg proved infertile and was
removed.
Two of the chicks were close-ringed eight days after hatching and the
remaining chick two days later. The parent birds ceased to brood on the
same day as the last chick was close-rung. At 22 days the chicks left the
nest-box for the first time, but returned to roost during the night period.
Two days later the hen had begun her third clutch. As the chicks roosted
in the nest-box, I decided to leave it in position even though I did not
want the parent birds to rear a third round. When the hen had completed
her clutch (again of five), I removed the eggs, placed them under Bengalese
and gave the Chestnut-breasted infertile Bengalese eggs to incubate.
When the chicks were 33 days old, the cock was seen to attack them
rather severely and the following day I removed them, at the same time
removing the nest-box to allow the adult pair to rest and moult.

Three of the five eggs hatched under Bengalese and the chicks were
reared successfully.
Diet
The staple diet supplied to my Chestnut-breasted Finches consists of
Pearl White Millet, Panicum Millet and Plain Canary, all supplied in sepa-
rate dishes. Spray millet is available permanently as is oyster shell, lime-
stone and mineral grit. A piece of cuttlefish "bone" is attached to the cage
front permanently and flaked cuttlefish "bone" is supplied at least twice a
week to non-breeding birds. For breeding birds, especially when chicks are
in the nest, flaked cuttlefish bone is offered two or three times daily as at
such times the birds appear to relish it. A dish of soaked seeds (consisting
of one part Budgerigar mixture to one part Plain Canary seed) is given
daily. Non-breeding birds take only small amounts, but pairs with chicks
take the seeds avidly and are, therefore, offered as much as they will con-
sume.
Non-breeding birds appear to take no interest whatsoever in live food,
yet will take up to 40 mealworms each day when breeding. I find it prefer-
able to kill the mealworms (by nipping off their heads) before offering
them to the birds, otherwise the birds often drop them on the floor of the
cage and the mealworms then crawl away before they can be eaten. Meal-
worm pupae are taken avidly and when I have plenty of these, I feed them
exclusively.
Thoroughly washed lettuce is given to a breeding pair at least twice a
day; non-breeding birds are supplied only every other day. The only ad-
dition to the above diet is Vitaflight C, which is added to the drinking
water at all times and once or twice a week a teaspoonful of Kilpatrick's
Iodised Minerals (for pigeons) is placed on the floor of the cage.
Song and display
Chestnut-breasted Finch cocks are extremely vocal and can be heard
(and seen!) singing for hours at a time. Some cocks will even sing while in-
cubating. Peering was observed in immature birds, but this activity is not
nearly so pronounced as in the Gouldian Finch and once the Chestnut-
breasted reach maturity, the activity ceases.
The display of the cock Chestnut-breasted Finch consists of the back
and rump feathers being raised; the feathers of the lower breast and belly
are also puffed out. The cock stands sideways on the perch, facing the
hen, and bobs up and down, singing all the time. At no time do the feet
leave the perch. After a few moments, the hen will crouch and solicit by
quivering the tail. The cock then mounts immediately and copulation
takes place.

When wild-caught Australian finches were exported from their country
of origin, no doubt many could not be induced to breed successfully in a
cage. However, as there has been a total ban on the exportation of birds
from Australia since 1960, the birds in our collections have obviously been
bred under captive conditions for many generations. Many of the Austra-
lian finches are now almost fully domesticated (the Gouldian Finch espe-
cially) and it is obvious that many that were considered in the past to be
unsuitable for cage-breeding, could no doubt be induced to nest and rear
young if housed in a fairly roomy box cage.
From the experiences of other aviculturists as well as my own, it is
obvious that the Chestnut-breasted Finch can be cage-bred. A good basic
diet of clean seeds is essential, plus the additions already mentioned
above. It is debatable whether or not live food is essential as the three
chicks from the third round of my pair were successfully reared by Benga-
lese without live food being offered. However, the Chestnut-breasted pair
was seen to hunt around their cage immediately the chicks hatched. This
activity ceased the moment live food, in the form of mealworms (or meal-
worm pupae) was offered.
It is often stated that Chestnut-breasted Finches are almost impossible
to sex visually. I do not agree with this, but will refrain from describing
what I consider are plumage differences between the sexes as I feel it may
not prove entirely infallible. The obvious way to sex the species is by the
song of the cock. If this is done when young birds start to moult into
adult plumage, the birds can easily be distinguished from each other as no
two moult out in exactly the same way and if a split ring is fitted to all
birds observed singing, these can be used for future reference.
Many breeders have mentioned that they find it difficult to dispose of
surplus stock. I am certain that if they took the trouble to sex their young
birds, then they would sell them much more readily.

Nectarinia (Chalcomitra) amethystina amethystina
By F.C. BARNICOAT
(Johannesburg, Republic of South Africa)
The South African National Cage Bird Association's medal for the
breeding of the year has just been awarded to Mr. Jack Scheepers of the
Natal coastal town of Amanzimtoti for his breeding of the Black Sunbird
in January 1983. This is a well deserved achievement in a lifetime devoted
to avicultural pursuits which has taken Jack Scheepers far afield in a num-
ber of different countries in Africa. The breeding took place in a large
aviary, 17 x 10 x 3 m high, constructed of nylon shade cloth of 60% shade
strength. One end consists of an artificially constructed rock cliff with
waterfall and a stream winds through the aviary, which is attractively
planted with a wide variety of plants including leonotis, tree-ferns, brome-
liads, anthuriums and orchids which thrive in the subtropical climate of
the coastal region of Natal.
One male and three female Black Sunbirds were housed in this aviary
with a mixed collection of small seedeaters and softbills for about 18
months. The male suddenly turned aggressive and slaughtered all other
birds in the aviary except the three females of his own species and the few
quail. It was while this tragic occurrence was being investigated that the
pear-shaped pendulous nest was first discovered attached to a length of a
type of Brazilian air-plant known colloquially as "old man's beard", sus-
pended from the roof of the aviary. No further nest inspection was carried
out for fear of causing the birds to desert.
The nectar mixture is prepared approximately to the following recipe:

The mixture is kept under refrigeration for up to two days and is success-
fully used for a collection of some 17 sunbirds in another very large aviary,
including the Greater Double-collared, Lesser Double-collared, Grey, White-
bellied and Marico. The Olive Sunbird is the best one of all as a character,
but has proved too aggressive to keep with any other sunbird, even in a
very large aviary.

The breeding of the Black Sunbird, however, was totally dependent for
its success upon a large supply of live-food. Approximately 200 spiders a
day, for which several persons searched diligently on Mr Scheepers' large
property, were provided and these were supplemented by a supply of
flying ants, which had been deep frozen and several fruit fly cultures in the
aviary. The single nestling grew rapdily and was a grey-brown colour, very
like its mother, when it left the nest. I viewed it in May, by which time a
small patch of the irridescent black colour had appeared at its throat, prov-
ing it to be a male. It was doing well in the large aviary with the other sun-
birds.
The parents were encouraged to repeat their success, and went down to
nest twice more. On both these occasions there were two youngsters and
the view is that possibly this was their undoing because it was not possible
to keep pace with the enormous amount of livefood required to feed two
babies simultaneously. Another disadvantage was that the supply of frozen
flying ants had been exhausted by the first baby. Unfortunately the babies
died when they were just beginning to feather. No doubt there will be
renewed efforts to succeed again when the summer comes.

A. LIEBERMAN - RED-WINGED LAUGHING THRUSH
described and, to this author's knowledge, has never before been bred in
captivity.
The Red-winged Laughing Thrush (also known as the Crimson-winged
Laughing Thrush) is found in pairs or small flocks in the mountainous
areas of Szechwan and Yunnan Provinces in western China. It is a mono-
morphic, thrush-like bird measuring 10.5 in (26.5 cm) in length. Its dis-
tinguishing characters are blood-red primaries and upper tail, with a grey
crown streaked with black. The body colour is a rufescent olive-brown.
Favoured habitat is forest undergrowth up to timberline, above which it
can be found in the low bushes which surround alpine meadows.
The San Diego Zoo acquired two flocks of wild-caught Red-winged
Laughing Thrushes, numbering seven and ten birds, from the Chengdu
Zoo, Szechwan Province, People's Republic of China, in August 1981 and
January 1983. During the 30-day quarantine period in the San Diego Zoo
hospital, the intial group of seven birds was treated with Pyrantel Pamoate
for nematodes, and the subsequent shipment of ten birds was treated with
Bithionol and Albendazole for flukes and sulphadimethoxine for coccidia.
All birds survived quarantine and were released for exhibit without mishap.
The flock was divided into four groups which were introduced to four
aviaries of various dimensions: two birds in an exhibit measuring 18 ft
x 15 ft x 7 ft (5.4 m x 4.5 m x 2.1 m); six birds in an exhibit measuring
40 ft x 15 ft x 15 ft (12 m x 4.5 m x 4.5 m); five birds in a walk-through
aviary of 12.000 square feet (1,080 square metres); and four birds in a
walk-through aviary of 8,000 square feet (712 square metres). All four
exhibits also house other bird species indigenous to Southeast Asia and
are variously planted with shrubs and trees found from that geographic
region.
This species captive diet consists of a "standard soft-bill pan" which
contains chopped fruits (apples, oranges, tomatoes, grapes, raisins, papa-
yas), chopped greens (romaine lettuce or spinach), moistened protein-meal
(trout chow, milled dog food, mockingbird meal, shrimp meal), blueberries,
and Zu-preem Bird of Prey Diet. Vionate multi-vitamin is sprinkled on the
chopped fruit. Also available, in a pan primarily for the gallinaceous birds
sharing the aviary, are mixed grains and pheasant pellets, from which the
Red-winged Laughing Thrushes are often seen feeding. There are daily
offerings of live crickets or mealworms. In all four aviaries, but especially
in the walk-throughs, naturally occurring live food is available in the form
of earthworms, moths, crickets, caterpillars and subterranean larvae, all
of which have been observed as prey items for the constantly foraging
Laughing Thrushes. A common sight is three or four Red-winged Laughing
Thrushes energetically turning over leaves in the litter in search of inver-
tebrate prey.

During the latter part of 1981 and for the entire year of 1982, no nest-
ing activity was observed, although in all four flocks it appeared that all
the Red-winged Laughing Thrushes were compatible, often seen allo-
preening, and singing in duet. Their vocalisations are varied and musical,
with the most common song being best described as sounding like a two-
note police whistle.
In March 1983, a flurry of Red-winged Laughing Thrush nesting acti-
vity began in all four aviaries, involving what is thought to be, at most, six
pairs of birds. In all, 11 nests were built, being begun or observed on the
following dates: 3rd March, 15th March, 17th March, 18th April, 1st
May, 3rd May, 26th June, 27th June, 29th June, 1st July, 21st July. Nests
were built of dried grasses, bark fibres, pine needles, and bamboo leaves in
varying quantities, according to availability, in each exhibit. Nest form was
a bulky cup affair, measuring approximately IV 2 in (18 cm), in diameter,
5 in (12 cm) in height and 3 in (IV 2 cm) from nest lip to nest floor. The
highest nest from the substrate was about 6 ft (1.8 m), while the lowest
was about 3 ft (0.9m), with an average height of about 5 ft (1.5 m) for all
11 nests. Eight of the nests were built in Golden Bamboo Phylostachys
aurea, two were built in young Pomelo Citrus grandis, and one nest was
built in a freely attached nest basket. It appears that when and where avail-
able, Golden Bamboo is the nest site of choice. Nest materials are woven
around and between the % in to 1 in (1.3 cm to 2.5 cm) stems of the
bamboo, incorporating the bulk of the bamboo clump into the matrix of
the nest itself. Wherever available, bamboo leaves were used as the finish-
ing material to form the interior lining of the nest chamber.
Eggs were laid in eight of the eleven nests; two with one egg, five with
two eggs, and one with three eggs. Fertility was confirmed in only three
nests, three clutches disappeared without apparent cause (predation, auto-
predation?) and two clutches were incubated for 21+ days, abandoned and
determined to be infertile. In one of the fertile clutches (of one egg), the
embryo died in the egg prior to pipping. The eggs are typically oval-
shaped, with a smooth semi-glossed blue surface. They are richly spotted
with tear-shaped streaks the colour of dried blood, becoming more densely
marked toward the broad end of the egg. The four eggs measured had
average dimensions of 1.16 in x 0.86 in (2.97 x 2.20 mm).
In the two nests which produced young, the incubation period was
estimated to be 16 to 17 days. In all cases in which eggs were involved,
both parents shared in incubation duties. In the two cases in which young
were hatched (one hatchling and two hatchlings), both parents proved to
be diligent parents, sharing brooding time and foraging time, making
innumerable forays in search of live food for the chicks. Mealworms and
crickets were offered to the parents three to five times daily, along with

the daily "soft-bill" pan. Supplementary, naturally occurring live food was
always available. Characteristically, the parent birds would line up the in-
vertebrate prey in their beaks until full, before returning to the nest. Up to
a dozen mealworms were counted on one occasion in the parent's beak,
which were ultimately shoved into the nestling's waiting gape. The chicks
feather rapidly and fledge from the nest after 15 to 16 days. They remain
near the nest, clinging to surrounding twigs while being fed by the parents.
Eight days after leaving the nest, the chicks begin turning leaves, actively
searching for invertebrate prey, but remain dependent on the parent birds
for the majority of their diet for two to three weeks after leaving the nest.
One chick was attacked ten days after fledging by a second pair of Red-
winged Laughing Thrushes which was beginning to exhibit nest-building
behaviour. This chick was removed from the exhibit, and was hand-fed for
14 days, but ultimately died from its injuries. It is recommended that in
aviaries with limited resources (space, vegetative cover, nest sites and
material) nesting pairs of Red-winged Laughing Thrushes should be kept to
a minimum to prevent intra-specific aggression between nesting birds and
fledglings. Both pairs that successfully fledged young returned to nest
within one to two weeks after the chicks were self-sufficient. However, in
one nest the eggs disappeared, and in the other nest the eggs were infertile
and abandoned.
In view of the restrictions imposed on the exportation of nearly all of
mainland China's avifauna, it is hoped by the staff of the San Diego Zoo
that this recently established group of Red-winged Laughing Thrushes will
serve as the nucleus of a breeding flock. Successful breeding in the forth-
coming seasons will provide future generations of this handsome Laughing
Thrush to other aviculturists and zoos that are interested in keeping such a
charming songster.

Pyrrhura mo lime
By Dr. W. MERCK
(Hamburg, Germany)
I received a pair of these conures in October 1931. The dealer had
offered to find a true pair from his stock by endoscopy, but the birds
seemed to me to be too small and slight for such an operation. Then
the dealer undertook to try to select a pair by his judgement, and he
was later proved right
As far as I know, up to that time this species was hardly ever impor-
ted into Germany but since then, they have been available occasionally.
The male and female are identical in colour but the behaviour of
my male is rather livelier and less shy, though the hen is not all that
timid. The cock feeds the hen from time to time out of the breeding
season.
The colouring is as follows: crown and nape dark grey, the latter
tinged with light blue, ear coverts greyish white, cheeks green, throat
and sides of neck whitish grey with feathers edged grey, upper breast
feathers edged with light brown, upper tail coverts tinged with light
blue, under tail coverts blue-green, primaries blue, tail on both sides
copper red, the remaining plumage green, bill and feet greyish-black.
I presume that my birds are of the race sordida as they do not have
any red on the abdomen, apart from a few hardly visible reddish feathers
(Arndt, 1983).
As with most of the other Pyrrhura species, the plumage is
not as strikingly brilliant as with so many other parrots, but in
their discreet colour composition and elegant shape, the
molinae make a charming picture, especially when the sun is
shining on them - which, by the way, they like if it is not too
intense. As their aviary is not shaded by trees, I put some
foliage on the wire over their favourite perching places. When a
group of these conures is flying, displaying their deep blue
wings, it is an especially pretty sight.
Green-cheeked Conures are lively birds, on the wing much of
the time and they are skilful climbers. In their ability to run fast
up and down the wire they resemble the Cyanorhampus para-
keets. Branches for chewing are essential and very much appre-
ciated, whereas old wood, such as the aviary frames are made
of, is hardly touched.

Dr. W. MERCK - GREEN-CHEEKED CONURE
The aviary measures 4 x 1.5 x 2 m (13 ft 2in x 5 ft x 6ft 6 in).The
attached shelter, measuring 1.5 x 1.5 x 2 m (5ft x 5ft x 6ft 6 in), can
be only moderately heated and in times of severe frost, the temperature
may drop to +3*C. Sometimes the parrakeets go down on the ground,
which is partly turfed.
These birds do not have a loud screech and only become a little
noisier when they are upset by something unknown, such as a strange
person or animal, so even sensitive neighbours cannot be irritated by
them. Nor are my birds very shy, and the presence of people in the
garden does not cause them to fly into the shelter. As they are out in
the aviary nearly all day, one can observe them well unlike shyer birds
that rush into their shelter the moment anyone appears.
Strangely, the Green-cheeked Conures did not go into a nest-box at
night, though two were provided, one in the flight and one in the shelter.
As far as I know, this is quite unusual amongst birds of the Pyrrhura
genus and they only changed at the beginning of the breeding season.
Though only recently imported in the winter of 1981/2, they proved to
be resistent to cold weather. I let them out into the flight when the
temperature was not below -2*C but I am sure that they would have gone
out in even colder temperatures. They also bathed in very cold water.
Their diet consists of the usual seeds (sunflower and oats are also
sprouted), of which sunflower and millet spray are preferred, corn-on-
the-cob (maize), a little biscuit, shredded carrots and much fruit - apples,
pears, grapes, figs and red currants. Wild berries such as hips, mountain
ash, hawthorn or white thorn, and cotoneaster berries of various sorts
are much relished as are chickweed and dandelion heads. Grit, cuttle-
fish "bone" and limestone are always provided. To date, they will not
touch spinach.
The birds became interested in the nest-boxes for the first time in
March 1983. Eventually they adopted a log in the shelter with a layer
of wood shavings. Soon mating took place and between the 28th March
and 5th April, five eggs were laid. Checking the log on 1st May, I found
four young in the nest. The fifth egg did not hatch and later disappeared.
As the parents were apparently worried when I entered the shelter, I
had few opportunities to observe the birds when feeding the young. As
far as I could see, the cock was often in the nest (always at night). At
first the young were naked, thereafter covered with thin down. They were
apparently always well fed. The first chick left the nest on 11th June, the
others followed during the next days, but they went back into the box
quite frequently for some further days and during this time, were more
inside than outside. The first time out their movements were quite awk-
ward and hesitant, but soon they became used to the new surroundings

and learned to fly and to climb skilfully. They are now very lively, moving
about together and there is much mutual preening and playful struggling.
The plumage of the young differs only slightly from that of their par-
ents: the grey is paler, especially the ear coverts, the ceres are lighter
and the bill more brownish-grey. The size is the same.

This bird is also known as the Bronze-naped Pigeon and the Crimson-
winged Pigeon. It was named after the French naturalist Adulphe Dele-
gorgue during his African travels in 1847. Little is known about this rare
secretive species which may be seen singly or in pairs with flocks, some-
times gathering to feed in the early morning and late afternoon.
The male has the head slate grey suffused with slight green iridescence;
nape vivid iridescent mauve; band across hind neck white; mantle and
wings dark reddish brown shading to slate-black on lower wing-coverts;
rump blue-grey; tail blackish; underparts dark greyish pink shading to
reddish brown on the belly; eye dark brown or reddish; orbital skin around
eye dark pink to flesh pink; bill blackish with pale horn-coloured tip; legs
and feet reddish pink. The female has the crown and nape brown and lacks
the white collar. Young birds of the nominate race have not been described
but a juvenile of C.d. sharpei lacked the white collar; underparts dark
rufous; upperparts greyish brown, feathers edged with light rufous.
Delegorgue's Pigeon occurs in Pondoland (coastal), Transkei (high-
lands), eastern Griqualand to Natal (interior), western Zululand, eastern
Zimbabwe and southern Mozambique.
It is locally migratory according to food supply. It inhabits evergreen
forests and thick * woodland and is also found on the coast and on
occasions in mature pine plantations. It is rarely seen as it keeps mostly
within the protective 'cover' of the forest canopy, but is recorded mainly
on its call which is a distinctive, fairly loud coo-co-coo , followed by five or
six quiet coos . If approached, it remains motionless at first but once
flushed, flight is swift and direct.
This species appears to be mainly frugivorous, feeding in the upper
branches of forest trees on wild figs, various kinds of berries and fruit.
Recorded feeding on the large pinkish or red fleshy cones of Real Yellow-
wood Podocarpus latifolius, the small, single-lobed, yellow-green capsule
of the wild Poplar Macaranga capensis , and the black (when ripe) berries
of the Pigeonwood Trema orientalis. The stomach of one specimen con-
tained the larvae of cicadas, while that of another contained some small
quartz pebbles.
Delegorgue's Pigeon breeds from November to April. It constructs a
flimsy platform of twigs in a tree or shrub, usually about 5-7 m above the

ground. It lays two glossy white eggs; both sexes incubate and feed the
young (Kenya).
The species is in no danger of extinction as long as the relatively small
areas where it occurs remain protected. There are populations elsewhere
in Africa. I can find no record of its having been kept or bred in aviaries in
South Africa but the northern race C.d. sharpei is reported to have been
kept on rare occasions in British and American zoological gardens.

I have had a long association with the Tambourine Dove, or, to give it
its alternative names, Wood Dove or White-breasted Dove. The association
has been caused because their low, rapid flight has led them to fly into
moving cars using a road which runs through the middle of an evergreen
forest near my home on the coast. Many have come to grief, but those
stunned spend about a month recuperating in my hospital aviary before
being released back into the forest. The male has a snow white forehead,
throat, breast and belly; nape, ear-coverts and back ashy brown; tail dark
brown, the outer feathers with subterminal markings in black; iridescent
wing spots blackish purple; eye brown; bill purplish, with black tip; legs
and feet reddish purple. The female differs from the male in having the
white parts suffused with grey. Juveniles have the sides of the chest and
flanks barred, the feathers edged with greyish white.
This dove occurs from Sierra Leone and Fernando Poo in the west to
Ethiopia in the east, then southwards to north-eastern Angola, Zimbabwe
(except in the dry east), Mozambique, eastern Transvaal, Swaziland,
Zululand, Natal to southern and eastern Cape Province, South Africa.
They also occur on the islands of Comoro and Madagascar.
The diet includes weed seeds, grain, fruit and insects. They are particu-
larly fond of the seeds of the Castor oil plant Ricinus communis. They
have been recorded feeding on the seeds of Sorghum Sorghum bicolor ,
Land Grass Eleusine africana, Flat-crown Albizia sp., Stink-hout Celtis
sp. and Fever Tree Croton sp., as well as the fruits of Waterbessie Syzigium
cordatum , Mulberry Morns mesozygia and Pigeonwood Trema orientalis
(Rowan, 1938). In captivity they accept a grain mixture consisting of
crushed red maize, lentils, tares, millet and sunflower. To supplement
the lack of castor oil in their diet, sponge cage was used. Lettuce, water-
cress, chickweek and spinach was their only supply of green food. The
chickweed was eaten on every occasion, and only small portions of the
lettuce and watercress, with no interest shown in the spinach. Various
types of fruit were tried but only orange and dried currants were accep-
ted. Insect life must play a large part in their natural food supply, as they
never refused such items as small mealworms, flying termites, small
brown ants, spiders, small slugs and dead flies.
During nesting two (occasionally one) creamy white eggs are laid on a

platform of twigs and roots, placed at 1-10 m (3 ft 3 in to 33 ft) in a tree
or in the tangled branches of a creeper. A pair was recorded utilising a
nest originally built by Laughing Doves Streptopelia senegalensis (Mor-
phew, 1972). The nest construction is carried out by the female as the
male carries twigs to the nest site. Both birds share in the incubation with
the male sitting for long periods during the day and the female relieving
for short intervals. The female would take the night sitting. The incuba-
tion period is between 17-20 days. The egg shells are usually removed by
the male soon after hatching. The female closely broods the young for the
first few days whereupon both brood constantly. On hatching the young
have a brownish skin covered with pale creamy white down on the head,
scapulars and rump. At seven days the quill feathers cover a large portion
of the body. At nine to ten days the feathers start to appear from the
quills. The young birds leave the nest at 19-22 days. Hybrids between this
species and Green-spotted Wood Dove Turtur chalcospilos, Blue-spotted
Wood Dove Turtur afer and Namaqua Dove Oena capensis have been
recorded.

THE BLUE-NAPED PARROT
Tanygnathus lucionensis
By GEORGE A. SMITH
(Peterborough, Northants.)

The Blue-naped Parrot weighs somewhere between 170 and 200 g.
It has a resemblance to an immature Alexandrine Parrakeet Psittacula
eupatria with a broader, shorter tail. Its glory is the wing-coverts which,
to the bend of the wing, are black and towards the flights are gold bor-
dered. Some coverts are blue. The nape is blue and more blue is on the
rump. Contrary to published opinion (e.g. Delacour and Mayr, 1946,
Dupont, 1971, and Forshaw, 1978) the sexes are of different appear-
ance. Hens have the gold on the coverts muted to dull brass; they have
less blue both to the wing and nape, and the black is reduced and duller.
The bill is not so perfect and a brighter red.
The Blue-naped, as with the other Philippine parrots, was seldom
imported. I obtained four adult hens from the late (and so much missed)
Mrs. Stephanie Belford in the spring of 1977. The only one that had
good plumage was picked up dead the next day, presumably it succumbed
to the stress of capture and transport. The next best-feathered bird died,
of visceral gout, in January 1981. She and another had laid annual clutches
of two or three eggs every late May or early June. In February of 1983 I
managed, through an advertisement, to obtain the loan of a male from
Ken McKenzie. Neither of the remaining hens was ever able to fly. They
had a tousled look, for some feathers never grew and the vanes to the
biggest feathers had defective barbs, while the flight and tail feathers
always grew in a curve. As diet made no difference to their feathering I
assumed that this was the result of once having had "French-moult". The
two hens had always been amicable. They roosted in separate boxes and
the likelihood was that the borrowed male, like the Ring-necked Parrakeet
P. krameri (Smith, 1972) and the Derbyan Parrakeet P. derbiana (Hay-
ward, 1983) might have become a bigamist. I doubt that the hens would
have fought. The separated hen was held two flights away, in an identical
outside aviary, 2 x 1 x 2 m high. Regrettably, she was picked up dead two
weeks later, with a ruptured liver from a hard fall as she could only flutter.
As with the Alexandrine Parrakeet, the pair are more at ease in close
company than are the smaller-sized Ring-neckeds and will perch, often for
long intervals, quite relaxed with their bodies almost touching. The court-
ship noticeably lacked the neurotic (because it is superfluous) wiping of

the bill of many Psittacula parrakeets. In the early courtship days when
the cock preened his partner's head he had less of the spite and fear so
obvious in Ring-neckeds. He groomed her head. When approaching the hen
the courting male (this is also noticeable in Psittacula) held himself, pen-
guin-like, bolt upright with eyes blazing and a very slight drooping of the
wings and flaring of the tail. He marched grandly forward (his legs stretched
clear of the body) with long, gliding, deliberate steps. It was possible to
compare this stately gait with that of a normal bird for, as he approached,
the hen would sometimes walk off. As the upright, proudly advancing
male moved towards the hen, he had his bill always directly facing her
with the head held arrogantly high. No side-to-side swaying of the head
was seen. Usually the female squatted low while he, intending to copulate,
first looped his head over her back with his bill-tip against her opposite
neck side, as if he were trying to stop her moving, then climbed on her
back facing the wrong way round. Positioning himself in the correct direc-
tion, he began copulation by pressing his cheek next to hers for a second
or two then, lifting his head over her nape, pressed the other cheek and,
after a similar pause, back again. This pressing of alternate cheeks took
place with a perfect rhythmical pattern. Although quite vociferous birds,
no noise was heard during treading. A regular alternate pounding of the
neck of the female by the copulating male's head, called "hammering" is
seen in the Ring-necked and the Long-tailed Parrakeet (Smith, 1979) and,
incidentally, in fig parrots Psittaculirostris. If the hen was not willing to
mate she would hold herself in an imperiously high-stretched body and
head position, which usually set him doing stiff-legged jumps with eye-
blazing to punctuate his marching. Then he would take short flights
dropping vertically on to a perch, immediately followed by a short
bounce, an action very reminiscent of lories and fig parrots and surprisingly
elegant for so stocky a bird. On walking away from the hen, or less
commonly, when approaching, he would slide his lowered bill ahead of
himself. The frequency of copulation fell throughout incubation and was
never seen once the eggs hatched.
Nest excavation was done by the hen. This nest was used as a dormitory,
by both, for many months before laying, and after. The nesting container
was our usual dry (because of overhead protection) sloping, thick wooden
rectangular box. As has been our invariable practice, for many years now,
no nesting material was provided, except for generous lengths of softwood
quartering screwed along the length of the inside corners of the box for
the hen to chew at. From Mrs. Bone stall's account (1937) it appeared that
her hen Blue-naped Parrot might have picked up odds and ends from the
aviary floor to form a nest. However, the soft, warm material she describes
as forming the nest does seem more likely to have been gathered by mice.

Certainly the several dutches my three birds laid were invariably deposi-
ted on a thick accumulation of woodparings torn by the hens from the in-
terior of the boxes. Six clutches were of two and four of three eggs. All
were laid in the period of late April, through May to the first week in June,
This hen laid her first egg on 3rd May, 1983. The second followed three
days later. As expected, the male played no part in incubation. The first
egg was infertile. After asking Mr. McKenzie's permission (the first chick
had been promised to him) the eggs were put into a mechanical incubator.
On 2nd June the first egg (of her second clutch) was laid sixteen days after
removal of these. Another (three days later) completed this second, fertile
clutch. The eggs were left with the parents. The first hatched on 29th June
and the second two days later. This twenty-six day incubation matched
the incubator-hatched egg and Mrs. BonestalFs pair. Pipping commenced
three &amp;apos;days before the chicks released themselves from the shell.
The incubator-hatched chick was immediately given to a pair of Ring-
necked Parrakeets that had a single three-day-old chick. (The foster parents
had, by removing their two previous clutches, been held back for this
purpose). The only difference, other than size, between the Ringnecked
Parrakeets and the Blne-naped Parrot chick was that the former was
completely naked. Blue-naped chicks have a thin, extremely sparse scatter-
ing of quite short (3-4 mm) down. This vestigial down never rubbed
off and was still there after three weeks. All the chicks were regularly
weighed. The Ring-necked Parrakeet-reared chick was weighed at approxi-
mately eight in the morning, when it had an empty crop, and the two
parent-reared chicks some time in the early afternoon when they usually
had full crops. (This might explain much of the difference in weight).
When four days old, two of the three were clearly yellow. Such a jaundiced
look, which is often noticed in fresh-hatched parrot chicks is, I believe, not
pathological It may prove to be an accumulation of carotenes: the vege-
table pigments that colour, amongst other things, egg-yolk. Perhaps it is
the absorption of the yolk-sac that gives this effect.
As will be seen from the graph, growth was very rapid, the eyes opening
when 12 days old and by three weeks the chicks were covered by a dark
grey, secondary down, the follicles of which had appeared, and darkened
the skin, at 11 days old. By 24 days the quills of the feathers were sprout-
ing in the skin and at the 29th day the first green could be seen on the
secondaries and larger wing-coverts. When 40 days old, the eldest, solitary
chick was taken for (successful) hand-rearing by Mr. McKenzie. Because of
the deeper red to the bill and the larger amount of blue to the wing, it is
assumed to be male. The other two seem to be female. The second chick
fledged after 56 days and the final one two days after that. Both are
beautifully perfect in feather and extremely tame. In appearance they are

smaller than the parents. The bill is a muddier and duller red; there is no
blue to the nape and only a little to the back; the wing markings are very
dull and indistinct. The tail feathers are pointed, not rounded as in the
adults, and the eyes are dark.
The surviving British population of the Blue-naped Parrot is between
14 and 20 birds. Included is the pair, and their two offspring (also bred
in 1983) owned by David Alderton. This number would be well adequate
provided that the necessary exchange of breeding birds takes place, to
establish them as aviary birds without having to obtain more from the
wild.

BEHAVIOUR AND MOULT OF A YOUNG CAPTIVE
TROPICAL SCREECH OWL
Otus choliba

Owls in general are thought by Brazilians to be animals that bring bad
luck to people; they believe that where an owl sings at night, someone may
die soon. However, Brazilians are also attracted by nests, eggs and young
birds, if only to put them in captivity or destroy them.
A barred young Tropical Screech Owl was one such unfortunate bird
(Plate 1), hatched in a large warehouse at the Agronomic Institute at
Belem, Para, Brazil, and brought to me on 26th August 1966. 1 kept it in a
large bathroom, perched on a branch. It tried to peck and clapped its
beak when touched but soon became tame. On 4th October it closed its
eyes when I touched its head. It was in better health, clapped the bill less
and often flew around the room.
Feeding
While a head wound healed, the bird was fed raw beef and boiled eggs.
Water was provided by opening its bill and dropping in water with an eye-
dropper. On 16th October, when I discovered the first expelled pellet
containing dark material, I started feeding it one to two mice, three to
four geckoes, and several beetles every night. Feeding was not a problem,
except that when it arrived I had to open its beak and force the food in;
soon it was feeding by itself. These owls are often insectivorous; a bird
from Icapara (Sao Paulo) in the Museu de Zoologia of the University of
Sao Paulo had remains of insects in its stomach.
On 14th October I had provided a container full of water for it to
drink and bathe in. The bird got in the container and drank and then
stamped its feet in the water, sitting and lowering the head several times
so that belly and head would get wet. It stopped bathing when I watched
but resumed as soon as I left. The next day, when the container was
presented, the owl entered the water and drank but did not bathe.
Spicknall and Pickett(1983) did not see drinking in captive Rhinoptynx
clamator.
Plumage
When I received the young bird, it was covered with soft downy grey

feathers barred with a darker grey, almost black; its feet were ivory, the
bill light olivaceous grey, and the iris tan or orangeish brown. Forty days
later, on 4th October, the first body feather dropped. Every day thereafter
two to five more feathers dropped. Its legs had gained feathers with grey
bases and light brown tips, each with a dark brown subterminal bar. Its
bristles were longer.
On 20th October I noticed different new feathers on its neck. The new
feathers were streaked instead of barred, and there was a dark feather on
the superciliary line. Whenever it preened, a few body feathers dropped
and some remained next to its bill. On 26th October the young owl had a
series of white feathers along its superciliary line. Breast feathers with
dark stripes were increasing in number, forming a necklace and two rows
down the sides of the breast. On 7th November there was a line of short,
white ear feathers which were erected at the presence of strangers. On top
of the head, black feathers had increased in number, forming stripes. By
24th November the owl had a different plumage (Plates 2 and 3) than
when it arrived in August, and emitted at least three different types of
calls.
From observation of two young in a nest found on 17th October,
1972, on top of an old nest of the Great Kiskadee Pitangus sulphuratus in
a rubber tree at the Agronomic Institute (Oniki and Willis, 1983), we can
conclude that at hatching,young Tropical Screech Owls are covered with
fluffy white down and eleven days later their chests are covered with dark-
barred feathers. More than 40 days later the barred feathers drop gradually
and are replaced by the streaked plumage described above. Wetmore
(1968) describes a similar sequence of plumages from Panama.

On 13th October at 18:00 the young owl had given, for the first time, a
couple of sounds similar to the call of an adult owl. It had heard these
calls from a bird outside - ever since it was in the room a pair of Otus
choliba had been singing outside every night. On 25th October, the pet
owl also sang at 02:00. Its song was rather weak and short but it was exci-
ted and flapped its wings. The outsider approached the window where the
pet owl was. From this night on, it emitted a few faint and short songs
every night, often flying around the larger adjoining room.
In early December I took the pet owl to Sao Paulo City, where it es-
caped while I was feeding it. It perched on top of a high building and later
flew away.
Other nestings
At Belem, on 17th and 21st November, 1972, I found two nests of

containing two white, rounded eggs. The average weight of four eggs was
15.lg (range 14.5-15.5g).
On 19th October 1967, in the same warehouse where the young had
hatched in 1966, two fledglings were discovered. (One white downy young
about five days old weighed 24.lg.) This suggests that a pair was nesting in
the same site year after year.

SOME BIRDS SEEN ON A VISIT TO AUSTRALIA, NEW

To a parrot enthusiast Australia is a paradise, for it contains 52 species
of this family, including some unique forms such as the Long-billed Corella
Cacatua tenuirostris . Therefore it was with great expectations of seeing
some of the native species that I visited this continent. That Australia is
the "land of parrots" was evident the minute our plane touched down at
Tullamarine Airport in Melbourne; as the plane made its way down the
runway, a pair of Galahs Eolophus roseicapillus was seen feeding in a strip
of grass - just a token of what was to be seen in the weeks ahead.
One of the delights of my trip was observing the Long-billed or Slender-
billed Corella in jits habitat. I had thought that it would be rare, as sugges-

ted by some reports which have documented a contraction of range and
decline in numbers, yet this was clearly not the case: in a day and a half
of travelling^ordon Aitken and I observed some 20,000 specimens. They
were wary of man, a trait that could probably be attributed to persecu-
tion as an agricultural pest. Within parts of the range visited it could be
described with only one word - numerous.
The Sulphur-crested Cockatoo Cacatua g. galerita was sighted on num-
erous occasions, with one of the largest concentrations being observed
feeding on the ground at Rutherglen in Victoria. They make a magnificent
spectacle while in flight. Similarly, Galahs provide a treat for the bird
watcher and their antics while flying, as they dart between trees, calling
all the time, make them stand out in my memory.
Numerous other species were observed in the wild. Some seen in aviaries
are worthy of noting. An Eclectus Parrot Eclectus roratus in the collec-
tion of Paul and Joan Sperba of Ballarat, Victoria, is unique in its colour
scheme. Briefly, it could be described as having the colours of both male
and female. Probably a cock, it has shown no interest in nesting. The
Sperbas also breed Golden-shouldered Parrots Psephotus c. chrysoptery-
gius , a species which I found in numerous collections and which could
be said to be established. Probably the most consistent and successful
breeder of this species is Joe Mattinson of Wollongong, New South Wales.
He told me that in a 20-year period he has bred some 600, a remarkable
achievement! Mattinson also has Naretha Blue-Bonnets Psephotus haema-
togaster naretha, which I also saw in the aviaries of John Fell of Victoria,
and of several others.
The Hooded Parrot Psephotus c. dissimilis , which, in my mind, is far
more attractive than the Golden-shouldered, was also encountered in a
number of aviaries, in which it is established. This species' display is most
attractive: males ruffle their black crowns, bring their wings slightly
forwards to reveal the rump and sway their tails from side to side.
A unique hybrid was seen in the collection of Victoria aviculturist
Stuart Anderson. When first told about it - a cross between a hen Aus-
tralian King Parrot Alisterus scapularis and a male Rainbow Lorikeet
Trichoglossus haematodus moluccanus - I was sceptical, yet after viewing
and talking to the breeder, there is no question as to its authenticity.
Produced in an aviary a couple of years ago, it could be described as
having lorikeet markings with the length of a King. Its actions con-
tained features of both parents and its voice was like that of the
moluccanus parent.
Non-parrot birds were many. Red-browed Finches Aegintha temporalis
were seen in small numbers in the vicinity of the Sir Colin MacKenzie
Fauna Park and in the southern part of Mornington Peninsula, both in

the state of Victoria. The Common Myna Acridotheres tristis was also
seen in numerous places, with a cinnamon-coloured bird being sighted
in the vicinity of Sid Smith's house in Harkaway.
New Zealand is not nearly so rich in avifauna as its neighbour Austra-
lia, but the birds that it does have are impressive. In parrots, all of which
have Maori vernacular names that start with the letter "K", it has a most
distinct group. One that I saw was the Kaka Nestor meridionalis ; this was
on Little Barrier Island, which was visited through the assistance of John
Craig of Auckland University. Their presence here is quickly seen, as these
magnificent parrots fly about the ranger's home at West Landing. They
are tame, allowing a close approach.
Birds seen on Little Barrier could be classed in both subspecies accord-
ing to their dull or bright colours, suggesting that septentrionalis is invalid.
This island contains some equally interesting birds, such as the Tui
Prosthemadera novaeseelandiae which is quite common, the less abundant
Bellbird Anthomis melanura and the very large New Zealand Pigeon Hemi-
phaga novaeseelandiae, a largely fruit-eating bird that can be seen without
difficulty. The former are rather aggressive, chasing the second species
away from a feeding station baited with sugar-water. Kakas visited here
sporadically for sips.
Red-fronted Kakarikis Cyanoramphus novaezelandiae were seen occa-
sionally, in forests but more frequently in trees that grow along the rocky
shore. Unlike Kakas they did not allow a close approach.
In the aviaries of Fred Rix, a noted New Zealand aviculturist, I had the
priviledge of seeing a pied mutation of the Yellow Rosella Platycercus
flaveolus of which he has a number of breeding pairs; several of these
were nesting at the time of my visit. They are striking, in my eyes, much
more so than birds of normal appearance. Fred also had a red Blue-
cheeked Rosella P.a. adscitus, whose colour is probably due to liver mal-
function, and a hybrid Blue-cheeked x Northern Rosella. The last could be
spotted as "impure" by the pale head coloration.
My short stay on Viti Levu, the largest island in the Fijian chain, was
most rewarding for I was able to see three captive specimens of the
Collared Lory Phigys solitarius. They reminded me of Vini in their actions,
though they were not nearly as active. In the Nausori Highlands a single
individual of the rare Red-throated Lorikeet Charmosyna amabilis was
spotted as it flew across a road; it then settled on a wild-growing orange
tree, where it soon became inconspicuous. The antithesis of the status
of amabilis is that of the Common Myna, which has to be considered the
most common bird on Viti Levu. An hour did not pass that this bird was
not seen. They were especially abundant in open areas, clearly shying

away from thick forest. One cannot help but wonder what effect this
bird and the introduced mongoose have had on avifauna.
Reporting on every bird observed in the field would take many pages,
because the countries visited are so rich in avifauna. Similarly, aviaries
house a melange that would excite even the least interested individual.
For this reason, those described here are some of the most noteworthy.

DO CHICK AND DUCKLING DOWN PATTERNS FUNCTION
AS RECOGNITION MARKS?
By DEREK GOODWIN

<footnote confidence="0.600813666666667">
Among my more valued books is a Victorian masterpiece (Bingley,
1852). It is written in the form of stories told by a loving and learned
uncle to his small niece and nephew. In the first chapter, Uncle Thomas
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.984712052631579" page_id="56320030"  page_num="112" year="" vol="">
narrates what the Norwegians allegedly believed were the remarkable (and
remarkably unpleasant) methods by which the Golden Eagle managed to
bring about the deaths of Oxen that it fed on. The little girl comments: "It
is a very sagacious stratagem indeed, I really do not see how it could
proceed more efficiently if it was endowed with reason. 5 ' The little boy
asks: "But is it true?".
Sometimes I feel like that little boy when confronted, in yet another
book, by some oft-repeated "ornithological fact". Here is one such, on
which I propose to give reasons for my doubts about its correctness. It is a
matter on which it would seem likely that many of our readers can give
first hand information and I hope these notes will stimulate many to do so.
The young of all nidifugous birds, that is birds that have active chicks
that leave the nest (whether for good, as with ducklings, or at first only
for short excursions as with some rail chicks) within from a few hours to
about three days (according to species) after hatching, and run or swim
actively thereafter, are clad in down. In the rails (Rallidae) the down is
usually black, except (sometimes) on parts of the head and in some water-
fowl (Anatidae) the ducklings or goslings may be uniformly blackish, as
those of our common Tufted Duck Aythya fuligula, or only obscurely

patterned as in most true geese (Anser and Branta). In most, however, and
this includes all (at least, I think all) gamebirds and most ducks, the young
are strikingly patterned in light and dark colours, these patterns being
usually most striking when viewed from close to and from above.
In most young chicks or ducklings the down pattern is highly cryptic
and serves to camouflage them in their natural environment, especially
when the young, after first fleeing from the parent in response to its
warning calls, crouch motionless, either in the open or (according to
species or circumstances) in whatever cover they can find to hand. In some
waterfowl, notably the shelducks and their allies, the black and white
down pattern of the young is, however, far from inconspicuous under nor-
mal circumstances. At least this is the case with our common Shelduck
Tadoma tadoma and, I imagine, with its exotic relatives also.
Thus in most gamebirds and in many waterfowl the down pattern of
the young helps to conceal them from enemies that hunt by sight, such
as predatory birds and humans. The same is even more obviously true
for the chicks of many waders, the colour patterns of whose down blends
in an almost miraculous manner with the usual backgrounds of their
natural breeding habitats. Anyone who, like myself, has at times failed
to find the immobile crouching chicks of such birds as the Golden Plover
Pluvialis apricaria, Woodcock Scolopax rusticola or Oystercatcher Haema-
topus ostralegus will have no doubt about this and will, perhaps, have
been saddened at the realisation of the scale of the "massacre of the
innocents" throughout countless generations which alone could have
brought about the present near-perfection.
It should, however, be noted that in our present man-dominated and
man-manipulated world, birds often breed in man-made habitats against
whose background their natural camouflage may be far from perfect. In a
predominantly green water meadow, the predominantly rich russet chicks
of the Snipe Gallinago gallinago are not hard to see, and the same is true
of some other species under comparable conditions.
As a general rule the more closely two species of birds are related, the
more alike the colour patterns of their downy young will be. Where there
are marked exceptions to this, as with the ducklings of the Vochdx&amp;Aythya
ferina and the Tufted Duck, this is usually because in one of the two con-
cerned the general darkening of the colour has obliterated the pattern.
Again, as a. general rule (to which there are exceptions) the pattern seems
to be more conservative than the colour of the down. However, although
chicks of closely related species may be very similar indeed, usually there
are specific as well as generic differences in the colour pattern, especially
on the head.
In connection with this, another function has been widely claimed for

D. GOODWIN - FUNCTION OF DOWN PATTERNS
the down patterns of gamebird chicks and ducklings (and sometimes, at
least by implication, for other nidifugous birds as well). This is that the
down pattern as a whole, or that on the head, serves as a species recog-
nition mark, and that the mother (or, presumably, the father in such birds
as phalaropes and bustard-quails) will kill or desert any chick which has
"wrong"markings.
The Heinroths, who placed the eggs of many different birds under
broody domestic hens, found that (I quote from Dr. M. Cullen's 1959
translation) - "By no means every hen will raise ducklings she has hatched
out. Some will not accept Pheasant chicks.......and there are even
those who will only accept (Domestic Fowl) chicks whose down is coloured
like that of the South Asiatic Red Jungle Fowl, the wild ancestor of our
domestic Chickens". Irnmelman (1983) says that wild Red Junglefowl
Gallus gallus (formerly G. bankiva) will only care for young of their
own species "which they recognise by the head markings" and adds that
this selectivity has been lost to differing degrees in different breeds of
domestic fowl.
Lorenz (1971, p. 293) says that a mother Muscovy Duck will show
parental defence in response to the distress calls of a Mallard Duckling
seized by a predator but will then "treat it with utter enmity" because
"the species-typical head markings, upon which parental responses depend,
are markedly different" (from those of a Muscovy Duckling).
The only detailed account I have read of a parent gamebird (or other
species) responding to the head pattern of a chick was that of a hen
Golden Pheasant (Lorenz, 1971, p. 169). She had hatched a young Com-
mon Pheasant Phasianus colchicus along with her own brood. She did not
harm the Common Pheasant chick but showed apparent conflict between
attacking and parental behaviour, pecking it gently but only when it was
close under her bill. "She would always fix her gaze on the head of the
changeling.".
That mother ducks of some species will attack ducklings that are not
their own is common knowledge. Anyone who has watched tame Mallards
on park lakes and village ponds will have seen all too many examples of
this and will also have seen that it occurs whether or not the strangers
have the "right" species-specific down pattern. That, as the Heinroths
have recorded, brooding domestic hens will often, perhaps usually, kill at
hatching time any fostered young (such as the Raven and the Little
Bustard instanced by the Heinroths) that differ from domestic fowl
chicks both in appearance and voice is not to be doubted.
What I do doubt, however, is whether gamebirds, waterfowl or other
birds that have active chicks recognise them innately by their down
pattern (either as a whole, or the head pattern alone) and normally (if

ever) kill or reject a chick or duckling that is otherwise normal because it
does not show the normal down colour pattern.
Lorenz (1966, p. 100) describes experiments with deafened Turkeys
Meleagris gallopavo , that seemed to show that previously inexperienced
hen Turkeys recognise their chicks as such by their voices. I think it is
likely that in other birds that have active chicks, the same may be true.
There seems to be much evidence that many (perhaps all) individuals
of many different familes and species will accept chicks or ducklings that
do not show the normal down pattern. If the wild Red Jungle fowl hen
really does recognise her chicks by their colour pattern and kills wrongly
coloured young, then clearly this innate selectivity must have lapsed in
domestic fowls before the first white (yellow chicks) or black (black
chicks) mutations could have occurred and been successfully reared.
The melanistic form of the Common Pheasant arose spontaneously
among introduced stocks in England and elsewhere (Delacour, 1951,
Goodwin 1982). The chicks of this form are dark chocolate or blackish,
with pale areas (sometimes) on the head, quite unlike the much paler and
intricately patterned normal chicks.
Yet, obviously, these strange-looking dark chicks were, and still are, ac-
cepted by their mothers. I have myself seen a wild, normally coloured hen
Pheasant, caring for four half-grown chicks, one normal in colour, the
Female Pheasant with three normal and one melanistic chick
other three melanistic mutants.
Where Mallard breed in numbers in places where they are little, or not
at all harrassed by birds of prey, it is common for a variety which is dark
chocolate to greenish black, with a white patch on the breast, to crop up.
Less frequent, but still not really rare, are pure white or partly white indi-
viduals. I am talking here of birds that in size, shape and flying ability differ
in no way from normal wild Mallards, not of strayed domestic ducks or

obvious crosses between them and the wild Mallards. The ducklings of the
dark form are almost uniform blackish olive, those of the white form
bright yellow (fading after the first week or so). Yet, so far as I have seen,
their mothers accept and care for them, even when there are only one or
two such freaks in an otherwise normally patterned brood.
I saw this freak Mallard duckling at Wey-
mouth in 1983. It had what looked like a
white (not, to my surprise, yellow) "powder
puff' on the back of its head. It and one
perfectly normal duckling were evidently
the sole survivors of the brood. They were
not more than five or six days old and their
undiscriminating mother was normal in
appearance.
It is not clear whether the Muscovy Duck that Lorenz wrote of was of
the wild or domestic form of the species. Domestic Muscovies of the
wild colour, and also those which, though otherwise of the wild colour
pattern, develop white or partly white heads at the second moult, are,
when ducklings, patterned in blackish-olive and yellow very like (to human
eyes) the ducklings of the Mallard (though not exactly alike). I have
watched many domestic Muscovy Ducks with broods comprised of some
wild patterned and some partly or entirely yellow (white when adult)
ducklings and have never seen the mother discriminate between them.
The Black-shouldered or Japanned morph of the Peafowl Pavo cristatus
has repeatedly cropped up among wild-coloured stocks. The chicks (and
females) of this form are whitish and differ strikingly from the normal
cryptically patterned Peafowl chick. When they occur (as they probably
often do) in a wild state they are no doubt soon eliminated by predators
but, so far as I know, there is no evidence that such conspicuous little
freaks are ever rejected by their mothers, even when these are normally
coloured Peahens. That acute and observant aviculturist the late Miss
Frances Pitt bred both forms, and had Black-shouldered (= whitish)
chicks produced by normal hens. She would certainly have noted and
recorded any such discrimination in the bird she so carefully observed and
so lovingly described (Pitt, circa 1924, and 1931).
Besides the above concrete evidence there is much circumstantial but
I think good evidence with other species. Whether good ever comes out of
evil is a debatable point but it is certain that knowledge often does. One
result of the past and ever continuing mass slaughter in Britain of thous-

ands upon thousands of gamebirds, waterfowl and Woodcocks for sport
(an activity approved of by many of our most influential bird protec-
tionists who are so horrified if a boy has a pet Kestrel or if a starving
peasant in the "third world" kills and eats a lark or a tern) is that such
freaks as do occur among these objects of the "legitimate sport" are
usually shot; and some at least of those that are ; end up usefully as museum
specimens.
In the British Museum (Natural History) collection there are many
silver, fawn, pied and very dark varieties of the Red-legged Partridge
Alectoris rufa and the Common Partridge Perdix perdix. There are also
a few pied, fawn and very dark Woodcocks. I have myself seen an en-
tirely white wild Oystercatcher Haematopus ostralegus. There can be no
doubt that all these birds must have differed strikingly when young from
normal chicks of their species yet it is quite impossible that they could
have survived in the wild had their parents failed to care for them nor-
mally.
It would be interesting to hear, via the pages of this magazine, from
any readers who have had abnormally coloured young of any nidifugous
species hatched and reared by their own parents (or by foster parents of
the same species) as to the parent's responses. It would be useful to
know in such cases whether or not any of the brood were normally
coloured.
Of course, any observations of unusually coloured chicks in wild
broods of any species would be equally welcome.

Bird gardens and zoos are sometimes priviledged to be given parrots
and parrakeets by people who are concerned about the future of a pet
bird which they have found difficult to keep due to a change of circum-
stance.
Thus it was that in 1978 I was given "Polly", a Blue-fronted Amazon
Amazona aestiva, which has subsequently proved to be a cock. He was
followed by "Chaka", a hen of the same species. She arrived in 1980. I
do not know much about Polly's past, only that the man who gave him to
me married a woman who was not too keen on parrots! Chaka was bought
out in Africa and is named after a Zulu chief. Her owners decided to part
with her due to the arrival of their own offspring plus the fear of a parrot's
beak. Both parties concerned liked the thought of their respective birds
flying at liberty with the many other species of parrots here.
Polly has flown at liberty since 1979 and when the hen Chaka arrived,
it was love at first sight, so her confirnement lasted only for a few weeks.
Since then, their relationship has become closer with the result that they
reared a chick in 1982, in a nest-box in a tree some 20 yds from the site
where two Scarlet Macaws were also nesting.
This potentially dangerous situation did not lead to bloodshed, despite
the fact that macaws are well-known to be extremely aggressive when
breeding. Frequent visits by the macaws to the Amazon's nest-box was
repelled by the two Amazons, who retaliated by seizing the macaws by
their tails and so managed to drive them away from their nest-box. The
young Amazon was still being fed by the parents when it had been out of
the nest-box for three months. The noise the chick made was similar to
the Meeting of a sheep which caused surprise to passers-by who were
puzzled by what sounded like an airborne sheep!
It is encouraging that these Amazons are extremely hardy. They roost
away somewhere at night and during the course of their freedom have had
to face extremes of cold, wet blizzards and storm force winds. They
appear unaffected by this. They are extremely active birds and spend a
lot of time on the wing in the early mornings and evenings. This is con-
trary to what many people believe since I have heard it said that Amazons,
like African Greys, are sedentary birds. In my experience, African Greys
are strong and active fliers.
Before coming here, both Polly and Chaka were kept in the conven-

tional way, as parrots in a cage, with freedom in a room when their owners
allowed them out to exercise. Both birds were steady with me but not
tame though T gather that they were tame with their previous owners. I do
not think that they were truly humanised, as I have found some parrots to
be. On first meeting, although it was evident that they were strongly at-
tracted to each other, Chaka seemed to be cautious if Polly came too near.
However, during the course of 1981 this cautiousness improved until they
reached a point of entering a nest-box together. Although well able to
defend their own territory, they have not caused any trouble to other
nesting birds. Within 100 yards there are two African Greys, who are
constantly entering a box but sadly have not produced any young up to
now.
As a species at liberty, the Amazon is the least troublesome of parrots.
I have not seen them defoliate the trees or known them to attack my
neighbours' fruit but I wish I could say the same of the other parrots.

tions in South Africa on his fruit farming estate at Somerset West, a
beautiful town at the foot of the Hottentots-Holland Mountains, some 40
kilometres east of Cape Town. His extensive ranges of aviaries are set out
in a wooded area and probably benefit from the partial shade cast by
many magnificent tall trees. The standard aviary length is 8 m of which
approximately 1.25 m is taken up by the shelter, which may be closed by
a door. Losses have been much reduced by closing all birds in the shelters
at night from 17h 30 until 08h00 the following morning. Each shelter is
supplied with a small heater, so that the shelter temperature may be ther-
mostatically controlled at 50*F, and a 15 watt red light bulb for night
lighting. There is double wiring between all aviaries. The floors are all of
concrete because it is thought that worm survival may be less than with
earth floors and concrete may be easily and more thoroughly cleaned.

F.C. BARNICOAT - STEPHAN COLLECTION
All birds bred at "Hathersage" are closed rung while in the nest with
dated and initialled aluminium rings. Not only does this procedure facili-
tate record keeping, but it is likely to become more significant in the
future as governmental and nature conservation laws the world over make
the movement of birds increasingly difficult. These closed aluminium rings
provide irrefutable proof of aviary breeding and it may be easier to legally
transport birds which have been so rung.
Harry Stephan has worked on three themes in his vast collection - the
Loriidae, Australian parrakeets and the smaller American parrotlike species,
especially the conures. Of these, the lory and lorikeet collection is the
most spectacular and, having been established on a fruit farm it is in a
unique and idyllic position for relatively easy feeding, and outstanding
results, and it is probably the biggest such collection in this country at the
present time. It is only possible to enumerate most of the species it com-
prises with a note here and there on the breedings achieved.
Most of these birds take years to mature for breeding. The Black Lories
have not bred yet, nor the Yellow-streaked in six years, even though they
have been surgically sexed. Duivenbode's reared a young male in 1980,
after five years, and a pair in 1981 reared by the mother alone after the
death of the cock. A pair of Black-winged has produced 35 chicks through
the years. The Violet-necked reared three offspring; the father died and
unfortunately all three are hens. The Blue-streaked lost their young in the
nest. The Red or Moluccan do well and were down on eggs agin. The
Dusky seem well established and one of the pairs had two young in the
nest at the time of my visit in February 1982. The Scaly-breasted breed
intermittently and a young aviary-bred pair has now been established. The
Ornate breed like a machine, yet there was a five-year-long wait before
they commenced. Swainson's had two young ones in the nest. Forsten's
had bred regularly. Coconut Lorikeets had young in the nest and have
always bred well. Edward's and Perfect have not bred yet. Two pairs of the
delightful little Goldie's Lorikeet are consistently successful, rearing two
young at a time; a second generation young pair has still not nested in the
third season, hinting at a fairly long maturation period even for this small
species. The Black-capped had eggs in the nest and had bred in the past,
while a pair of Purple-naped were still too young to have nested. Chat-
tering Lories breed quite well; they are inclined to nest only in summer
and not all the year round as with many other species. There were two
pairs of Fairy Lorikeets; they have not succeeded in breeding yet. The
male of the beautiful pair of Stella's regrettably has a growth on his abdo-
men which may prevent breeding success. Two pairs of the recently im-
ported Musschenbroek's looked in excellent fettle, and one of the pairs
had had three young but had allowed them to die. This species appears to

eat more seed than other lorikeet species.
Among the Australian parrakeets are the King, which has bred in the
past, and the Amboina King, still to be bred. Crimson-wings have proved
fairly prolific. The Barraband's is, strangely enough, one of the few species
never to have reared young at "Hathersage". Ill fortune has dogged every
pair that has been kept, but the effort still persists. The Princess of Wales
does exceedingly well once a good breeding pair is obtained, and Rock
Pebblars have also bred frequently. Pileated had had a good season. The
Barnard's, Cloncurry, Port Lincoln and Twenty-eight were all represented
and the intermediate form between Port Lincoln and Twenty-eight. The
Cloncurry looks like breeding soon and the others have already bred
easily. There are all the Rosellas including the Green and the Brown's
which are, of course, the most valuable. In two years the Brown's reared
four offspring; then the breeding cock died. Now an effort is being made
to settle a young cock with the old hen, but he is belligerent in the ex-
treme and his wing has to be kept clipped. There was a lovely pair of Red-
vented Blue-bonnets reared at "Hathersage" and the old pair had given six
youngsters for the current season, which proves them to be successful
here. The pair of Yellow-vented Blue-bonnets had not yet bred. Except for
the Golden-shouldered all the Psephotus were represented, pride of place
going to the Hooded. There was an aviary containing nine young Hooded
from the current breeding season just coming into colour and showing
signs of becoming aggressive towards each other. This species has not,
despite these results, proved easy to breed. Though they are willing enough
to go to nest, the babies are frequently lost, often at quite a late stage, and
they may cause many bitter disappointments. There is a breeding pair of
Yellow-fronted Kakarikis, but the Red-fronted, with which excellent results
were achieved in past years, had happened to die out, so that a new stock
is now being sought. This can easily happen in great collections where only
one or two pairs of each species can be kept. Particular success has been
achieved with the Swift Parrakeet here, and four were bred in the last
season; they are going to be set up on a colony system. They are a lovely
bird, particularly brightly coloured and sleek in plumage.
Among the American species the small macaws - Yellow-collared and
Illiger's - are comparatively new additions and not established yet. The
Illiger's have twice laid fertile eggs but deserted them. A good collection
of conures is being built up, but here nomenclature can be a problem.
For example, in the trade the Green-cheeked, Azara and Red-bellied were
all offered at different prices and on receipt proved to be exactly the same
bird apparently offered for sale without reference to species or subspecies!
These birds have all bred extremely well, however. Other conures in the
collection are the Blue-crowned, which breed only once per year and only

one out of the four eggs was fertile owing to the poor feet of the cock,
two pairs of Red-headed, the Golden-capped, which had reared a young-
ster and subsequently killed it, though one had been fully reared the pre-
vious season, Sun Conures, which had just reared offspring, the Brown-
throated and Jandaya, which, strange to say, did not reproduce and the
Golden-crowned or Peach-fronted which breed well. There are odd speci-
mens of Petz and Cactus, as well as pairs of Patagonian and Painted which
have not bred to date. Celestial Parrotlets are also kept and have bred
prolific ally.
No doubt I have missed quite a number of species, but enough has been
said to indicate that here is an extremely productive collection of parrot-
like birds making a valuable contribution to aviculture in South Africa.

The discovery of new species takes a little time to filter through the
scientific literature but it is well worth wading through the mound of
technical jargon in the hope of finding such a report. The Wilson Bulletin
Vol. 94, No.2, p. 105, outlines the history surrounding the discovery of
the Pale-bellied Antpitta Grallaria carrikeri. The first specimen, a juvenile
was collected during 1976 but was thought to belong to an already named
species. Since then, both sexes, more juveniles and a nest containing three
young have been found. The species has so far been found at three cloud
forest sites, all from Peru.

By coincidence, several days after writing the previous note, another
copy of The Wilson Bulletin disclosed the discovery of another antpitta.
Volume 95, No. 1, documents the appearance of the Ochre-fronted Ant-
pitta Grallaricula ochraceifrons from northern Peru. Two specimens, both
males, were collected in epiphyte-laden, stunted cloud forest in 1978.

Australian ornithologist John Courtney has for several years been using
tape recordings of food soliciting calls of parrot chicks for taxonomic
research. In Australia the number of non-native species available is very
few indeed. Members are asked to assist Mr. Courtney in his work, which
has already produced some important results, by sending tapes to him at
Swan Vale, Glen Innes, New South Wales 2370, Australia, or to Rosemary
Low (13 St. Wilfrid's Road, New Barnet, Herts.) who will forward them on
to him.
If possible, chicks should be recorded at several stages during their
development, the age in days being given as an introduction to each record-
ing and, of course, the species.

On the same subject, it is pleasing to note a change of attitude by some
scientists when a new species is discovered, especially as most regions of
the world are comparatively well-explored and numbers of the species
must surely be low. In bygone years, a whole series of skins would be
collected for the world's museums.
However, no skin of Campbell's Fairy Wren is represented; instead
colour photographs taken at the time of discovery, along with measure-
ments, have been distributed among leading institutions.
This bird owes its discovery to R.W. Campbell, a bander working for
the Australian Bird Banding Scheme at Bosavi, a remote area in western
Papua New Guinea. On three visits (4th-11th February 1980, 6th February,
1981, and 6th-8th November, 1981) a total of five birds were netted and
banded. Other visits failed to find Campbell's Fairy Wren, underlining the
fragile status of the species. Rather optimistically it is being stated that the
range is likely to be a belt of forest some 300 miles long. Although chris-
tened Malurus campbelli, it appears to be a victim of ''lumpers" as it is
unlike the typical Malurus Wrens of Australia. If conventional methods
had been adopted in its classification, it would reside in the genus Cheno-
rhamphus.

The Masked Bobwhite Colinus virginianus ridgwayi is the subject of an
interesting article in the November 1983 issue of the Audubon magazine.
Its ornithological history is discussed in detail and includes conservation
measures projected for the future which, incidentally, revolve around the
release of captive-reared birds into carefully selected areas. Previous releases
have only been partially successful.

To the delight of American ornithologists, last year proved to be the
most productive in recent times for the low population of Whooping Cranes,
a total of 40 young being fledged. Thirty were reared in the wild with a
further 10 at Patuxent where a flock is maintained to supply eggs, either
for rearing there or cross-fostering in wild Sandhill Crane nests. A world
population of 150 is now estimated.

The cross-fostering technique has been mentioned previously in this
column in relation to the New Zealand Wildlife Service and their en-
deavours to save from extinction the Black Robin Petroica traversi. It is
a slow process, hindered this season by unusual weather, but the popula-
tion has now reached 11. A record 18 endemic Black Stilts Himanatopus
novae-zelandiae have also been reared with the aid of cross-fostering. The
efforts of the New Zealand Wildlife Service in conserving their bird life
is to be greatly admired.

subject of a captive breeding project by the New South Wales National
Parks and Wildlife Service over the past three years. Only 15 individuals
remained in mid-1980 but by April 1983 the population had risen to 120.
The intended five-year project will probably finish halfway through the
fourth breeding season.

Television is not a habit I give way to that much but I must admit that
the Autumn/Wmter programming of Britain's four channels made certain
evenings very entertaining - some weeks as many as five evenings included
a showing of a wildlife programme, occasionally two. Admittedly, some
were repeats but when the quality ranked as high as the award-winning
three-part series by the B.B.C., "The Flight of the Condor", there were no
complaints.
One Sunday in November must surely have been the best night's viewing
for a long time with the showing of two 55-minute films: the first part of
"Flight of the Condor", undoubtedly one of the finest wildlife series yet
made, featured a sequence on Torrent Ducks amongst its gems but even
this was eclipsed by "Birds of Paradox", a BBC and New Zealand Television
Service co-production. Not only a whole programme devoted to birds

which is something in itself, but film of some very rare species indeed was
included. Covering flightless birds, it commenced with the familiar Ostrich
and progressed through sequences on Kagu, Takahe, recently discovered
species of Rail and Steamer Duck, and climaxed with unique footage,
taken with night-vision cameras, of the Kakapo. If this film has not yet
reached overseas television services, keep a look-out for it - it is truly a
superb piece of television.

wide and overseas members should keep a watch out for it. Amongst the

Red and Yellow Diamond Doves and Domestic Pigeons
I have read with interest Mr. W.D. Cummings' letter, commenting on
mine about red and yellow Diamond Doves. Not having had the pleasure
of seeing the Diamond Doves in question, I cannot, with any authority,
suggest whether Mr. BrickelFs or Mr. Cummings's descriptions are nearer
what I, or others, v/ould see in the birds.
I am, however, puzzled by an apparent contradiction in Mr. Cummings'
description. He says: "The colours red and yellow can be likened to those
same colours in the domestic pigeon." Then, at the end of the same para-
graph, "The red is clear red, not a brown red."
But all the various shades termed "red" by fanciers of domestic pigeons
are some shade of reddish brown, not a clear red in the ordinary meaning
of that term. True reds (clear reds) are seen in such birds as Scarlet Tana-
gers, Crimson and Eastern Rosella Parrakeets, and many others, but among
pigeons only in some of the fruit doves Ptilinopus and in some of the
bleeding-heart pigeons Gallicolumba . Similarly the "yellow" of domestic
pigeons is at best a warm sandy buff, certainly not the yellow of, say, a
Golden Oriole, Yellow Wagtail or yellow Canary.
In domestic pigeons the "dominant red" or "ash-red" may be any
shade from a rather washy mauve tinged greyish brown to a warm reddish
brown on those parts of its plumage which (depending on pattern) would
be black in a bird of the "blue/black" colour. The colour known as
"recessive red" can vary from a dingy reddish brown with considerable
bluish grey tinge on rump and tail to a uniform rich, deep chestnut"red",
which latter is what fanciers breed for in most show breeds of pigeons
(when they are breeding "red" birds, of course).
The other day I received from Mr. Brickell a colour slide of a Diamond
Dove that was classed as a "cinnamon" in a show in South Africa. This
bird, so far as one can see (it is in a show cage and the wings and tail are,
of course, folded so one cannot see inner webs of primaries or rectrices), is
very similar to many "dominant red" domestic pigeons in coloration and,
like them, has washy pale grey primaries and tail.
Let us hope that some artist or photographer will soon favour us with
accurate pictures of all these varieties of the Diamond Dove, either in some
book we can buy or, if the AvicultumlMagazine&amp;apos;s available cash will run to
it, for publication in our magazine.

THE RARE NDUK EAGLE OWL
Bubo poensis vosseleri or B. vosseleri
AT THE LONDON ZOO

This rare forest-dwelling owl is found only in the Usambara Mountains
of north-eastern Tanzania. Very little is known about the bird, and there
have been no more than 20 positive records since it was discovered at the
beginning of this century. It was first described by Reichenow in 1908
from a specimen collected near Amani and sent to the Berlin Museum by
Dr. Vosseler (Kothe and Haase, 1908). Reichenow designated this bird,
which subsequently was shown to be a sub-adult, a new species Bubo
vosseleri. There were no further records until 1962 when a fledgling,
unable to fly, was found in April in the high forest near Amani, at an
altitude of about 3,000 ft. This bird was transferred from the East Africa
Malaria Research Institute in Amani to London Zoo in August of the
same year, and died of cardiac and circulatory failure some nine years
later in September 1971. Moreau (1964) used this individual to describe
the juvenile and subsequent sub-adult plumage, and to make comparisons
with the closely related Fraser's Eagle Owl Bubo poensis. He concluded,
on characters of size and pattern of underparts, that the Nduk Eagle Owl
is a subspecies of poensis.
In December 1971 another individual was presented to the Zoo, having
been taken, in December 1969, as a downy young by local people to the
Research Institute in Amani, where it was looked after by Dr. White and
his wife. They kept it, almost as a house-pet, for nearly two years, feeding
it exclusively on rats and raw beef wrapped in cottonwool. In April 1975
two more birds were received by the Zoo, both having been picked up as

fledglings near Amani. One was found in December 1972, kept at the
Research Institute and fed on beef and occasionally mice. It was so tame
that it was allowed to live in a Jacaranda tree near the building and each
evening would come to collect its food, though it was also seen to hunt
for itself. The second bird was found in late January 1975 on the road
near Amani and when it came to the Zoo in April was still in its white
juvenile plumage with pale bluish beak and very pale bluish feet.
These three birds are still at the Zoo and are, as far as I am aware, the
only ones in captivity. We now know that we have a male and female, and
the other is probably a female. The pair, of which the male was hatched in
Tanzania in late 1969, and the female in late 1974, are housed in an aviary
measuring 18 ft long x 7 ft high x 6 ft wide (5.49 x 2.14 x 1.83 m). There
is a pond, some plants, and a 7 ft (2.14 m) long shelter at the back with a
peat floor, logs and a nest-box. Though generally inactive, especially
during the day, they are obviously now closely bonded. The nesting
season in Tanzania, from the evidence of when the young have been found,
must be between October and March. In the Zoo, what little breeding
behaviour has been seen has been between November and April. This
behaviour has been food-passing (November, December and January), and
calling (November to April), but has not yet led to egg-laying. The single
bird, hatched in Tanzania probably in late October or November 1972,
was separated from the obvious pair in 1981.
They are all fed on rats, mice, or strips of beef with a vitamin/mineral
supplement SA37, and have had no health problems since they arrived,
apart from a recurring 'bumble-foot' in the single bird.
The Nduk Eagle Owl is listed as rare in the Red Data Book (King, 1981;
Collar, 1982) because of its limited distribution and apparent confinement
to the one area of evergreen mountain forest. This habitat has been subject
to considerable destruction, particularly between 1880 and 1935 with
clearance for subsistence farming, and also more recently, with tea and
cardamon cultivation. Though much reduced in size, the remaining forest
areas are mostly within forest reserves even if they are not always ade-
quately protected. Possibly an undisturbed forest is not as essential as was
once thought, for most of the young owls found have been on the ground
in areas cleared for cardamon but where there is still a forest canopy. The
most recent population estimate suggests about 500 pairs, i.e. a density of
two pairs per square kilometre (Stuart, in Collar, 1982).
The problem remains as to whether the Nduk Eagle Owl is a full species
or is a subspecies of the nominate Fraser's. The few people who have
studied the living bird are tactfully non-commital: Moreau (1964) conclud-
ed from plumage similarities, though he was not emphatic, that it is a sub-
species; White (1974) pointed out that the call is similar, but significantly

different to the Fraser's; Olney in White's (1974) paper recorded a number
of differences in plumage between the Nduk and Fraser's, which were not
seen by Moreau. Comparisons between the three individuals now at the
Zoo, and two adult Fraser's also at the Zoo show there are distinct differ-
ences in adult plumage. The most obvious differences are that, compared
with Fraser's, the Nduk Eagle Owl has(l) dark brown patches (the blackish
brown spots noted by Reichenow in his original description) on the breast,
which are more prominent and extend in two ill-defined lines down each
side of the body (in Fraser's these patches are confined to a broad band
across the upper breast), (2) the dark bars on the underparts are less thick
and more widely spread, and are, therefore, not so clearly differentiated,
(3) the border of the facial disc is wider and darker, (4) the facial disc is
lighter and more orange than orange-brown. The white shoulder bar formed
by the scapulars, which Reichenow used as a diagnostic characteristic in
describing his new species, in fact virtually disappears as the adult plumage
is assumed. In none of the adult Nduk Owls examined at the Zoo has there
been a white shoulder patch, though there have been one or two whitish
scapulars. The type specimen on which Reichenow based his original des-
cription is, therefore, quite definitely a sub-adult.
When alarmed both the Nduk and Fraser's Owls fluff out their body

feathers and make a low clucking sound - chuk, chuk, chuk. There ap-
pears to be no difference between these sounds in the two owls. On three
occasions in November, December and January, in the semi-darkness of
early evening, a series of calls were heard from the Nduk Owls. In each
case the calls consisted of a repeated (three to four times) regular double
syllable note. This was the same call that White (1974) heard, and different
from the call which he thought was made by Fraser's Owl. The pair of
Fraser's at the Zoo have not been heard to make any call apart from the
alarm 'chuckle'.
There is no doubt that the Nduk Eagle Owl and Fraser's Eagle Owl
are taxonomically close, though there are a number of marked differences.
Whether these differences are sufficient to justify the separation into two
species, or whether the separation should be kept to the subspecies level,
is still a matter of speculation. Fraser's Eagle Owl is found in the forests of
west Africa, across to northern Zaire, with two specimens being taken in
south-west Uganda (Snow, 1978; Britton, 1980). The closest record is still
at least 1000 km from the isolated population of the Nduk Eagle Owl in
Tanzania, and vegetation maps (Keay, 1959) show that the land between is
not forested. It seems likely, and there is corroborating evidence from
other birds, and butterflies (Moreau, 1964), that there must have been at
some time lowland forest extending right across Africa from west to east,
including parts of Uganda and Tanzania where forest no longer exists. The
disappearance of parts of this interlinking forest left isolated populations
in the coastal mountain forests on the eastern side, which have become
sufficiently different to deserve at least subspecies, and in some cases,
species categorisation. This is almost certainly what has happened to the
Nduk Eagle Owl. On the evidence there is at present, I would consider the
Nduk Eagle Owl is justifiably a subspecies, and in an evolutionary time
scale could become a full species.

A common bird, the Red-eared or Red-whiskered Bulbul has a large
range through India, Indo China, southern China and Malaysia. It shows
little fear of man, favouring villages, gardens, cultivated land generally and
is even found in and around large cities;it has also been introduced into the
United States. It is very popular as an aviary bird in Britain and is also
widely kept in its native countries.
The following notes form an account of a successful breeding by a pair
in my possession:
Background
Two birds were received from a dealer in September, 1982; they were
both in poor condition on arrival, neither having tails and, with few wing
feathers, were unable to fly. Their plumage was dirty and soiled, one bird
being almost bald on its head and neck. Their condition was worsened by
having undertaken a 27-hour train journey.

The birds were put into a box cage and the lights remained on through-
out the first two nights; the bald one, being very weak and hardly eating,
was put in a hospital cage where it died during the first night. The survi-
vor recovered well and by 20th November, when it was released into a
small indoor flight, had moulted completely and regained its power of
flight
A replacement bird arrived in November after a much quicker journey
by road; he too was in poor condition but could fly reasonably well and
by the end of December had completed his moult. His general condition
being much better than the other's had been, he was released into the
flight immediately quarantine ended.
Sexing
I spent a great deal of time studying both birds, eventually coming to
the conclusion that I had a true pair. Initially I was struck by the coarser
build, especially the head and beak of the second bird, the cock, than that
of the hen; however, as he was also slightly bigger I did not discount the
possibility that they belonged to different subspecies. After moulting, the
cock had a richer, darker brown on his back; furthermore, when the cock,
an intruder, was introduced, he immediately assumed dominance over the
resident hen. My efforts at identification were made easier by the cock
having a split crest which, as it has not moulted out, I assume to be a per-
manent fault.
Taming
The hen remained in a box cage for two months, during which time I
endeavoured to tame her. On arrival, as is often the case, she was very wild
and would never feed until I was out of sight. After a few weeks she lost
this terror although she remained very wary and would normally remain
frozen on her perch at the back of the cage whenever I offered her meal-
worms. If I put my hand in the cage, either to change the food pots or to
offer a mealworm, she would panic. The cock, though slightly bolder and
less panicky, behaved in a similar fashion but as he was in his cage much
less time, could possibly have been tamed if I had tried for longer. When
in their indoor flight, any mealworms were quickly snapped up by a tame
pair of Pekin Robins, purchased at the same time as the cock bird. Any
attempts to tame them in the outside aviary were hopeless, both birds
retreating to the far end whenever I entered. During incubation of eggs and
young, the hen overcame her fear of me, remaining on the nest when I
passed by, little more than 3 ft from her.

<bodyText confidence="0.978041179487179" page_id="56320060"  page_num="136" year="" vol="">
The Bulbuls shared their indoor flight amicably with Zebra Finches,
Green Singing Finches, Pekin Robins and a Diamond Dove. On only one
occasion did I observe the cock threaten a particularly cheeky Zebra Finch.
When they had young, the hen became very protective and if, when she
was off the nest, I put my hand too close, she would fly down and attack
it. Both parents would threaten the starlings in adjoining aviaries if the
fledglings were clinging to the wire netting division.
Diet
The regular non-breeding diet consisted mainly of fruit: apples, pears,
bananas, peaches, grapes and oranges, varying with availability, diced into
fine chunks. To this was added mixed dried fruit soaked overnight and
bread mixed with malted food drink, whilst minced beef was offered once
or twice a week. During late summer, elder, hawthorn and blackberries
were offered but these had limited appeal and were often ignored. 'Haith's
Softbill Food' was provided, as well as a few mealworms daily; any millet
or seeds given were totally ignored.
During rearing they were given a mixture of nectar, rice pudding and
hard-boiled eggs, together with nectar in a separate dish; these items they
refused to try at all but possibly, had they been provided earlier, they
might have sampled them. Mealworms, ants' eggs, minced beef and small
grasshoppers were offered daily in large amounts, all of which were relished
and became almost the staple diet during this period. Two days before
nest-building was observed, food intake dropped by a third: the weather
had been very hot for at least a week beforehand but, if anything, con-
sumption had been higher than normal. The amount of fruit taken remained
low until about a week after fledging.
Housing
They remained in their indoor flight throughout the mild winter, the
room was moderately heated and, apart from the initial loss, no problems
were encountered.
On 26th April they were released into an outdoor planted aviary which
measures 2.95 m x 1.52 m x 1.93m high (9ft 8 in x 5 ft x 6 ft 4 in high)
with a small night house, 0.92m x 0.61m (3ft x 2ft). Additional shelter is
provided by covering part of the aviary roof with Perspex. Various shrubs
had been planted, most prominent being a bush of suckers surrounding the
trunk of an old pear tree standing almost centrally in the aviary. The back
is sheltered by a stone wall covered in ivy, whilst the front and right side
have aviaries adjoining. The night house is situated on the left side and is
only accessible from the outside by climbing up from the neighbours'

terraced garden, thus affording the birds plenty of privacy.
Display and courtship
The main drawback of this secluded and thickly planted Bulbul aviary
is that observation of the birds is extremely difficult. With aviaries in front
and to one side and the back wall of stone, the only view I had of them
was from the valley on the roof of our house which, being built on a hill,
was almost at the same level as the aviaries. Even from this uncomfortable,
and in good weather extremely hot, position my view is restricted to half
to two-thirds of the aviary. It is hardly surprising, the ref ore, that only on
two occasions did I witness an attempted display by these shy birds. Both
were disturbed, the first in early May, by a cat; observation on this occa-
sion was from a different position, my view being obscured partially by
creepers climbing up the side of the aviary and I could not confirm
whether the cock was, in fact, displaying. The second display, in August,
ended when a pear fell on to the aviary roof, but the raising and fanning
of wings and tail whilst calling to the hen corresponded with the descrip-
tion given by Rutgers in The Handbook of Foreign Birds .
Apart from the first display, no interest in breeding was shown what-
soever until the beginning of the nest construction in July, except for the
cock occasionally singing his melodious if repetitive song from a favour-
ite perch; however, the unseasonably wet weather until mid- to late June
may well have been partly responsible.
Nesting
An open-sided nest-box, partly filled with hay, was placed amongst the
ivy on the end wall but the Bulbuls were never interested in this. It was
during a routine inspection of this box on 13th July that I noticed a few
strands of hay and some leaves woven together crudely in the fork of a
pear shoot, about 3Vift (1.06 m) off the ground. Leaving as quickly as
possible, I climbed up to my uncomfortable vantage point to watch.
Construction of the cup-shaped nest was undertaken solely by the hen,
with the cock trailing behind, chirping excitedly. Whenever approaching
the nest, she would look round for signs of danger before disappearing into
the bush: the cock rarely visited but would wait until she emerged and
follow her down to the ground where she collected the materials. She com-
pleted her task by the 16th having used hay, grass, feathers, and dead
leaves, lining it with fine grasses.
The first of three eggs was laid on the 19th; the eggs measured approxi-
mately 22-24 x 16-17mm and were pinkish white, heavily blotched with
reddish brown and a few blue-grey markings. Incubation by the hen com-
menced on the 21st; the cock was never seen to feed her and would never

go near the nest, the hen usually coming off to feed, mainly on mealworms,
after I had left the aviary. Before returning, she would bathe thoroughly
in fresh water, afterwards preening herself on a nearby perch, whilst the
cock would sit alongside, sometimes singing to her. These visits would
rarely last more than five minutes and were usually carried out twice daily.
Despite her nervousness, she never left the nest whilst I was in the
aviary but would not return if she had left before I entered, until after I had
gone; if on these occasions I examined the nest, she became very agitated.
On 31st July, after only 10 days' incubation, I discovered eggshells
beside the water dish. I increased the supply of live food, collecting ants'
eggs and small grasshoppers from a nearby, south-facing bank to supple-
ment the mealworms of which, at that time, I had only a limited supply.
Though the cock was seen to take several of these, he was never seen
feeding them to the young and after carrying them around in his beak for
several minutes, would eat them himself.
Rearing and development
Taking Day 1 as the day following hatching, I have compiled the
following sequence of events. Two chicks hatched which were pinkish
grey with yellowish beaks; the remaining egg disappeared between five
days and fledging, the exact date not known.
Day 1 A thunderstorm during the night gave me cause for concern
but there seemed to be no ill effects.
Day 3 Black pin feathers broke through on the wings and there was
a slight increase in size. They were being fed almost solely on
grasshoppers at this stage.
Day 4 The chicks were seen begging for the first time; before, they
had lain in the bottom of the nest until the hen attracted their
attention.
Day 6 Pin feathers erupted on head, neck and back and started to open
on the head; they had grown well and covered the bottom of
the nest.
Day 8 Feathering well on their backs and wing primaries.
Day 9 Eyes opened for the first time.
Day 10 Apart from having no tails, they were fully feathered.
Day 11 Both chicks left the nest for the first time; initially they perched
just above it, but during the day they flew clumsily about the
aviary. The parents at this time were very nervous, especially
when I entered with mealworms.
The chicks were less than half the size of the adults, their
colouring, though similar to the parents, was a lighter brown on
back and wings, their heads were blackish but, again, not as dark

as the adults; their crests were almost non-existent. Throat and
breast white, speckled with brown, they had no red on them
whatsoever.
Day 12 They were flying more, the parents following them anxiously.
Both chicks spent the night above the nest and showed no
desire to return.
Day 16 The chicks had attained more confidence; their tails just begin-
ning to appear.
Day 17 It was clear that the nest had been re-lined and the cock started
making half-hearted displays to the hen. At 19 days the chicks
were nearly three-quarters grown and by the 20th August the
cock was left in almost sole charge of them. The hen laid the
first egg of a new clutch and began sitting in the afternoon. It
was not until 29th August that they were first seen to feed, one
chick taking some mealworms, although for several days pre-
viously they had both been sitting by the dishes; the following
day both parents refused to feed them, eating any mealworms
themselves. Both young were independent and almost fully
grown by 4th September (Day 35), and, apart from a total lack
of red, resembled their parents.
On 11th September, I first noticed pink feathers round the
vent and, at the time of writing (31st October), the red is just
beginning to appear on their cheeks.
Second Round
Incubation began after the first egg, differing from the first round,
when the hen started after the second. Two chicks hatched out on 1st Sep-
tember, after 11 and 12 days' incubation, the third hatching the following
day, again after 11 days. The weather had deteriorated by this time and,
after three days, the nest began to disintegrate. All the chicks were begging
lustily from two days, something the first clutch rarely did, but by four
days, one had disappeared. It could easily have fallen out of the badly
listing nest but a search of the ground below revealed nothing.
Any attempts of mine to repair the nest resulted in an attack by the
courageous hen whilst the cock and fledged young joined in the alarm
chorus. Development of the chicks was about a day behind the first round
but both chicks remained healthy until the evening of the seventh day,
when one fell out; this was found dangling on a briar below the nest. I
attempted to remove it but it was well hooked and the hen became very
alarmed and attacked me. I made quite sure that it was dead, then left it
until the following day, by which time she had lost interest.

The cock was regularly seen feeding the surviving chick and I suspect
that he had fed the first round young as well, thicker foliage allowing him
to be more secretive. The hen removed and ate the faecal sacs and the nest
always remained clean.
The chick was seen perching on the top edge of the capsizing nest after
10 days'- it was fully feathered but, with a cold wind blowing, it looked
extremely uncomfortable standing with both eyes closed, refusing food
offered by the parents. Deciding it had left prematurely, I again endeav-
oured to repair the nest, with some success, and placed the chick inside;
the hen, after much scolding, returned to brood the chick when I left. My
hopes of it staying were short lived, for, by lunchtime it had clambered
out. I waited until early evening to replace it but, when it would not stay,
reluctantly I left it out. The night was cold and the chick, which had
eaten little during the day was found dead the following morning.
No further attempts at nesting were made. The old nest finally col-
lapsed about three days after the chick died. During the rearing of the
second round, no aggression was ever shown towards the independent
young birds; they, in return, showed little interest in the chicks except to
join in the alarm calls whenever I interfered with the nest. All four have re-
mained amicably together ever since and will probably remain so until
next spring.

BREEDING THE BLUE-EYED COCKATOO

By PETER J. BLOOMFIELD (Assistant Curator of Birds)
Chester Zoo was lucky enough to purchase a pair of Blue-eyed Cocka-
toos from Mr. J. Best in March 1966. These birds are still in the collection
today and from that original pair we now have a collection of eight birds.
We were presented with a male Blue-eyed Cockatoo by a member of the
public in November 1975; this bird was suffering from a bad case of feather
plucking and has remained in the same state since that time, only on occa-
sions moulting out into good plumage - this happening after breeding.
Nevertheless, he has proved to be a good bird to breed from.
The first breeding occurred at Chester in 1973 when the birds were
housed in an isolated aviary away from the public in the garden of Mr. W.
Timmis, the Curator at that time. The birds were left completely alone
except for feeding, and as a consequence, few records were kept of that
early success. The youngster reared in 1973 turned out to be a female and
so we were able to make up another pair on receiving the presented male
in 1975.
For unexplained reasons, no further breeding took place until 1979
when both pairs of birds, now housed in the Parrot House, produced one
chick each. In both cases, the young bird was reared and they turned out
to be a male and a female. The parent birds had been given a barrel to
nest in, with a top opening, and this was filled three-quarters full with a
mixture of peat and wood chippings which were placed on an upturned
turf cut to a depth of about four inches.
Breeding again took place in 1981 and once more each pair produced
one chick, both of which were reared to maturity and turned out to be
two males.
1982 was a disastrous year for the Blue-eyed Cockatoos. Both pairs
went to nest but an egg from the 1966 pair disappeared, we think to a
predator, and it was then decided to remove the egg from the other pair
and place it in the incubator to avoid the same thing happening to that
egg.
The artificial incubating went well and the bird hatched without any
problems but it did not appear to respond well to the diet we were rearing
it on, despite the fact that it was a diet which had proved successful for
rearing other cockatoos. As a consequence, the bird grew up with a
slight deformity and we had to keep it in its rearing pen in the Parrot

House. It was from here one afternoon in October 1982 that the bird was
stolen, and we have not heard anything more about it since then.
In 1983, our youngest breeding pair went to nest about mid-May and
this time the female laid two eggs which turned out to be fertile. The
first chick was noticed on 14th June and the second on 20th June, the
eggs having first been seen on 11th May. The exact incubation was not
determined but we put it down to approximately 30 days. Both parents
seemed to share the incubation duties and both birds were very pro-
tective of the nesting area whenever it was approached by a keeper. Dis-
turbance by the keepers was kept to a minimum, but the design of the
Parrot House only allows us to place the nesting barrels, at most, 12 ft
from the public, however this does not appear to upset the birds.
We now have a group of eight specimens of this species at Chester
and in February 1983 we sent a pair of these birds to Rotterdam Zoo on
breeding loan. Although our original birds are now getting old, we are
very hopeful for the future of this species at Chester Zoo, and aim to
continue to breed them and keep our colony going. This now seems
especially important in the light of recent correspondence with Mr. Roy
MacKay of the Baiyer River Sanctuary in Papua New Guinea, who
informs me that a party of American bird watchers passed through New
Britain recently and did not record this species at all.

The attached drawing shows the four outside aviaries in the Parrot
House that house our collection of Blue-eyed Cockatoos; these measure 12
x 12 x 12 ft (3m 66cm), with the same measurements for the inside
area.
The diet for the Cockatoos during the breeding season consists of a
normal parrot mix plus a varied selection of fruit and vegetables. On the
hatching of the young, we add soaked seed, egg rearing food, boiled
maize, vitamins including Vionate and Bemax.
As a postscript to those interested in the breeding successes of
psittacines, in September 1981 our male Red-tailed Black Cockatoo was
sent to Rotterdam Zoo, Holland, to make up a pair of this interesting&amp;apos;
species. I am pleased to report that, in the summer of 1982, these birds
reared one youngster to maturity and talking to the Curator of Birds,
Han Assink, on 19th December 1983, he informed me that another
chick was hatched this year and fledged only that morning.

(Tokyo, Japan)
In 1972 I wrote a book about finches. I had been keeping birds for
some 25 years by then. The first birds I ever kept were an unfortunate pair
of Tri-coloured Nuns, as they were invariably referred to in those days. A
friend sold them to me, and lent me a Yorkshire Canary show cage to
keep them in. This lad had been given a couple of elderly Norwich Canary
hens by his father, and his great ambition in life was to breed a Chaffinch
mule. He reasoned that the best way to do this would be to place a Chaf-
finch's clutch beneath one of his old hens. Then, from the resultant brood
of tame Chaffinches he would select a good young male to breed with his
canary. He never succeeded in rearing the Chaffinches, let alone creating
the elusive Chaffinch mule. However, his case stayed in my mind for many
years afterwards and, together with the experience with the Munias, was
probably as much the cause of my addiction to finches as anything.
When I wrote the book, I attempted to synthesise in one source a ref-
erence to every finch that had ever been recorded as being kept in cap-
tivity. As much as possible, I relied on personal experience, but to cover
all the species in this way would have been impossible. The tally of about
350 was not bad. However, it never occurred to me that in the space of
ten short years my company would send me to three different contin-
ents of the world, nor that in each I would succeed in finding many spe-
cies of finches that I had not only not kept, nor seen, but had not even
listed in my book. In the following notes I would like to list those spe-
cies. I will also mention species that are in the book but only where I have
learned something new in the intervening years.
My motivation in writing about the birds I have kept is not to lay
down any rules but to prompt readers to add their experiences to the
benefit of all. I am continually surprised, and a little distressed to find
how often there are expert and experienced bird keepers who have never
shared their knowledge - and how many countless thousands of birds
live out their lives non-productively, even anonymously, because their
keepers simply did not realise that the species could be bred (for example)
or might have lived twice as long on a different diet, or might have enchan-
ted the neighbourhood with its song.
From Spain in 1974, I went to live in Venezuela for three years. I
became a director of the Audubon Society there, led expeditions and

outings, and carried out an exhaustive 13-month survey of a large ranch
that covered both hill country and lowland. I set up netting stations for
banding and photographing the local birds. Venezuela is an incredibly
rich country in its variety of geography, and the number of species of birds
being second only to Colombia. From the Andes to the Llanos, the Amazon
to the Caribbean coast, it is a bird-watcher's paradise.
In 1977 we moved to Chicago, living on the lake shore. The migrating
birds moved up the lake shore in vast numbers each spring, and back down
again each autumn. I soon discovered that scores of birds would hit the
windows of the modern ape house at the Lincoln Park Zoo, and also the
enormous McCormick Place Conference Centre. Every day at dawn during
the migration seasons I collected dead and injured birds, keeping perfect
specimens for painting, nursing invalids back to health (and being forced
to keep some over winter) and consequently became a good friend of the
Curators of Birds at the Zoo and the Field Museum. My job at that time
took me around the world two or three times a year but, living in the US,
I could neither import nor export any birds.
In 1980 we moved to Tokyo. I soon contacted the Yamashima Insti-
tute and they introduced me to a man who is the main importer of birds
into Japan, and nearly all of his stock comes from China. We have become
good friends and he saves me "new" species and odd individuals of great
interest.
In each of the three countries I have discovered the pet shops where
the owner is a bird enthusiast and, in the case of Venezuela and Japan, the
source of local native birds.
It can readily be seen by the reader that my peripatetic life has enabled
me to acquire a very wide experience of bird life, and bird keeping, but I am
equally lacking in profound experience. Not since I left England to live in
Denmark in 1967 have I had my own good-sized aviary where I have been
able to keep birds in something approaching a natural situation. Some of
my cages have been large - I have kept owls, magpies, toucans, rollers,
parrots, buzzards and others - and I have bred some finches. I mention
this to avoid giving the wrong impression. My bird keeping has been rather
more like that of Arthur G. Butler than that of Frank Meaden. So, if the
reader has kept any of the species mentioned in the following notes and
can add to the information given, please write to the Editor.
For any reader who has a copy of my original book, I would like to
point out that the list of "Records of Birds Bred in Captivity" (pages
292-303) does include references to lengthy and valuable reports that are
not breedings, but will be of considerable utility to ah aviculturist intent
on breeding the birds concerned. This is clarified in the introduction
(page 16) but not in the introduction to the list on page 292. This over-

sight on my part led my good friend Derek Goodwin, in his review of the
book, to say "......(I find myself) not only credited with the breeding of
those waxbills with which (I) succeeded, but with two - Jameson's Fire-
finch and Black-crowned Waxbill - with which (I) did not!" In each case,
in fact, I had recorded the reference for the first successful breeding, and
then added the Goodwin references for the benefit of the researcher. Both
of those being infinitely more readily available to the average reader than
the Avicultural Magazine for 1935 and 1936 - and, if I may say, much
more useful references for somebody attempting to breed the species
himself.
Several years ago the name Charles Sibley gained some notoriety on
account of the studies this scientist was carrying out. It seemed that he
needed the albumen from the eggs of birds to analyse the chromosomes
in the protein. There were several cases where the eggs of rare birds of
prey had been obtained, and the judge in the ensuing court cases always
seemed to speak up on the side of the protectionists and against the
researchers. Since then Sibley's DNA studies have become widely recog-
nised, and there is little doubt that considerably valuable and relevant
discoveries have resulted. I regret that I cannot give a reference, since the
following came by the way of personal correspondence from a friend
who attended a symposium last year in the USA. It seems that in a paper
presented by Dr. Sibley and two associates, A.H. Bledsoe and J.E. Ahlquist,
DNA-DNA hybridisation comparisons indicated that several South Ameri-
can "finch" genera ( Sicalis , Volatinia, Haplospiza, Oryzoborus and Diuca )
are tanagers, not emberizines. Other genera ( Tersina , Catamblyrhynchus,
Nephelornis and Cyanerpes) are also tanagers. For the purpose of this
paper, I have left the former group in my collection of finches, but it is
certainly worth recording the fact here.

The buntings are perhaps the most disparate and most widely distribu-
ted subfamily of finches. They range across North America and Asia to
Japan where political and legal restrictions result in very many species
being unknown to the average aviculturist and - in many cases - virtually
unknown to the serious ornithologist as well. It is this group that has
produced the most exciting discoveries for me, in each of the four con-
tinents in which I have lived.

From the coloured plate in a text book one could assume that this bird
is a race of the Red-headed Bunting E. brunniceps but in life it is signifi-
cantly different. It is a smaller bird, noticeably so, and with a more lively,
tit-like nature. The males in autumn are extremely variable, depending on
age, but it is always easy to distinguish the sexes.
My birds showed a liking for plain canary seed and the occasional meal-
worm. They are peaceable in a mixed collection, in my experience, and if
anything are inclined to be slightly cowed by their more robust companions
(e.g. Yellow-browed and Red-cheeked Buntings). A lone male kept in a
cage by itself sang sweetly, and often.
JAPANESE GREY BUNTING Emberiza variabilis
This is a largish bunting, fairly typical in shape and character with a
slightly longer tail than usual.lt varies in length from 6Vi to 7 in (16.5 to
17.8 cm). An adult male is instantly recognisable, being grey all over with
a horn coloured bill, pink legs, and whitish undertail. The juvenile male is
similar but more brown and heavily streaked above. The female is a very
difficult bird to identify if seen separately, being buff below, well streaked,
brown and heavily streaked above. The pale malar stripe is very noticeable
and a russet rump also distinctive. Neither bird has any white in the tail.
My experience with this bird is very limited. I bought a single male in a
pet shop in Tokyo. It was very wild and had been kept in a secluded cor-
ner in the company of a few Chestnut Buntings. Its plumage is remarkable,
being thick and soft with a dense black down at the base of the body
feathers. Despite being essentially grey all over, it is a beautiful species.
During the sue weeks I had it in my collection it was very active, apparent-
ly quite fit, but one morning I found it dead.
Many finches will live quite happily on what is virtually an all seed diet
until they sicken with something. Then they will begin eating soft food,
mealworms, fruit, in fact almost anything. Very often such birds will pre-
fer to eat only one kind of seed. This Grey Bunting showed no such ten-
dencies at all. It was quite a mystery.
Subsequently I found a female that I kept over the winter of 1983/3.
It too was very wild and never settled down. It also had a very dense down
on the body feathers. It was occasionally irritable with other birds with
which I kept it.
It is a bird of thickets and is happy in cover. Given the chance, I would
keep it in a well-planted, roomy outdoor flight.

the white malar stripe of that more familiar bird. This species also lacks
the black head in fresh winter plumage, but on the male there are clear
vestiges of black showing that will distinguish it from the female. The
female can be told from the European bird by the lack of streaking on the
breast, and an even, rust-coloured rump.
Out of a shipment of about 2000 birds from northern China, there was
just one pair of this lovely bird. They were both sick, suffering from
gastro-enteritis, and the female soon died. The male lingered on for some
weeks, regularly suffering a relapse before eventually dying. From two
sick birds one can hardly get an accurate idea of what the species is like as
an avicultural subject.
From this limited experience, however, together with some observations
in the wild, I would say that the male is a bold territorial bird, an open
songster, and a good subject for a collection.

A sparrow-sized bird with the sexes rather similar, and not easy to sex
in winter plumage. The head of the male is black with a white stripe down
the centre of the crown, white eyebrow superciliaries, a white malar stripe
and a small white patch behind the ear coverts. The upper parts and flanks
brown, reddish, streaked on back wings and flanks. The female's head is
dark brown, her throat is whitish, and ear coverts huffish. The Yellow-
browed Bunting is quite similar but can be told by the yellow on the fron-
tal superciliary.
It may also be referred to as the Black-throated Bunting, or Taiga Bunt-
ing. It has a small distribution in Manchuria and winters in Korea and
China.
From the big importation mentioned earlier, I sorted out many corpses
and identified several bodies as being Tristram's Bunting. I kept a good
pair for painting. To look at, they are extremely dull and unexceptional
birds in any sense. According to the Japanese importer they are rather
delicate and of little interest.

This is another rather dull and drab species that I could only recom-

one would see the bird at its best, fit males would sing and become more
showy. However, it was not at all noteworthy. As with the preceding spe-

A delightful and slender little bunting, indigenous to Japan. It is yel-
lowish all over, olivaceous on the upper head becoming brownish on the
back, wings and tail. The head is an even colour except for dark lores and
a most distinctive whitish eye ring. The bird also has two pale wing bars.
The female is similar to the male but a little paler and duller. Not always
easy to sex.
This is a prized and popular cage bird in Japan. While a few specialised
shipments get out of China each year, the Japanese prefer to keep the
locally-caught birds. Only males are kept, as the females are not regarded
as songbirds.
In a large cage with other species of bunting, it seems to be a slight and
delicate species. But, despite the overwhelming similarity of many bunt-
ings, the white eye ring of this one, while not being unique, is very dis-
tinctive. I had great difficulty in obtaining a female. The various shipments

kept it from October through to June and my hopes that it was a young
male were not realised. There is nothing like wishful thinking in an avi-
culturist to keep cages full and crowded, is there? I released it before
taking off on home leave that summer.

in identifying it. The importer and the man from the museum both had no
doubts, however.
In personality it was a lively but very steady bird that kept its crest
erect most of the time. The browns of the face and back were very soft
and lovely. Whilst it was very peaceful it was always first to the meal-
worms which it gobbled with great enthusiasm. It was a frequent and en-
thusiastic bather as well. I have since kept several pairs under varying con-
ditions and found this to be a peaceful and beautiful bird, and a fine
songster.
ELEGANT BUNTING Emberiza elegans
In my book I reported that it was a highly prized cage bird in Japan
where it was valued as a song bird. The bird I kept in England 20 years ago
was not a songster, and I could find no record of its song in the literature.
I speculated that it might not be such a good songster by western standards.
Since coming to Japan I have kept it on several different occasions. I
bought a pair in 1980, and since females are very rare in captivity, hoped
to be able to export them to England for breeding but, failing to get a
licence, I released them. I then bought a locally-caught Japanese bird and
kept it over the winter of 1981-82. It settled well, sang occasionally in
company but when caged by itself quickly became a rich and persistent
songster and I could see that its reputation and price (a good male would
be about #40 to #50) were justified.
Subsequently I kept another solitary male which would frequently
throw its head back and utter a short sweet phrase which became rather a
bore because of the lack of development or variation. I found that they
all ignored greenfood, fruit and mealworms, but when I put some greenfly-
infested branches in their cages, they gobbled them eagerly.

Previously I had written of the Rustic Bunting, "I doubt whether these
or any other small buntings from the north of Europe would stay fit and
in perfect condition if deprived of insect food permanently." I had kept a
pair in a large, planted garden aviary and had drawn this slightly odd con-
clusion from watching their behaviour and great affection for mealworms.
In Japan I have kept a fine pair of the large race to our north, known as
the Kamchatkan Rustic Bunting. I should interject here that some author-
ities do not recognise any subspecies of this bird. I believe the plumage
variations and sizes may be individual and not geographic. In this case,
the male was a full half-inch longer than the female and much more boldly
marked. She appeared more sandy in coloration too. They were good and
lively cage birds that settled very well, showed a distinct preference for

canary seed and took the occasional mealworm.
Regarding the food issue, it seems unnecessary to keep buntings on
seed all year round. I have noticed in Japan it is common for dealers to
feed buntings, and other finches, on softfood in the summer months. If
kept indefinitely on dry hard seed, some birds will develop melanistic or
pure white feathers.
LITTLE BUNTING Emberiza pusilla
Herbert Murray wrote to me telling me about his Little Buntings. He
had a pair that he found quite inoffensive. The sexes were distinctly di-
morphic in breeding plumage, but in fresh autumn plumage they became
very similar indeed. They nested - on the ground - but never hatched
young. These birds spent most of their time on the ground, seeming to
eat a wide variety of food and giving the impression of being quite insecti-
vorous, especially during the breeding season.

I have received a few odd single birds from northern China. In my cages
they have always been peaceful, very shy and easily disturbed by their
more rumbustious and larger congeners. I would say they were definitely
best kept in secluded and peaceful - meaning uncrowded - quarters. One
male sang freely and sweetly, with a Skylark-like continuance. A note I
have made says that the chestnut cheek patches are not diagnostic in
autumn plumage. It may be distinctive in Europe, but in Asia many
buntings have very similar plumage. One bird I bought had several white
feathers, in matched even positions - outer tail and inner greater wing
coverts. They successfully disguised the bird. I believe the shipper had
kept it on simple seed (mainly millet) for a long time.

This bird may be rare in western aviculture but it appears regularly in
the trade in Japan and Hong Kong. I have kept it twice now, each time
selecting a good pair for painting. An old adult male in early summer is
most strongly marked and the touch of yellow on the black-and-white
striped head is very clear. In flight, away from the observer, the russet
rump and white outer tail is very noticeable.
In fresh autumn plumage the sexes are very similar, but males definitely
seem (and usually are, in fact) larger. From the number dead out of a
shipment of 2000 or so from China, I would say that they did not travel
well, and my first pair arrived with gastro-enteritis that took me ages to
cure. In general it seems to be a peaceful bird but I have clear memories
of a female occasionally being irritated and rather bitchy. One note in my
diary remarks on them being "a little pushy". They took both green food
and mealworms and were most enthusiastic bathers.

Basically a typical yellow-bodied bunting, brownish and streaked above,
female duller than the male but similar. The four distinct subspecies all
differ mainly by head markings but when seen live, the races are suf-
ficiently different as to appear to be different species. By an extraordinary

The nominate race E.s. spodocephala I have not kept, but retrieved
several fine corpses from the disastrous shipment mentioned a few times
already. Of the four subspecies, the adult male of the nominate race is the
one that truly justifies its name as its head is entirely grey with a slight
olive tinge and a little streaking. E.s. oligoxantha is similar but noticeably
paler with only a slight yellow tinge to a white belly. The grey head is
much paler.

E. s. extremi-orientis is regarded as synonymous with E.s. melanops by
some authorities. We had several birds of both "types' 5 in the shipment,
identified by the skins from the Yamashima Institute, and I found the for-
mer similar but not as brightly coloured as the latter. These birds are some-
what olivaceous on the head, yellow below and streaked on the flanks. The
Japanese race E.s. personata is the brightest of all, but quite variable. It is
the only race with a yellowish chin and throat.
Six extremi-orientis/melanops birds arrived with bad gastro-enteritis
and most soon succumbed. The sexes were very difficult to distinguish in
fresh autumn plumage. In their healthier periods they ate a variety of seeds,
nibbled greenfood and took mealworms. The Japanese birds I have kept
have settled well, but males have definitely tended to be aggressive, to
their own females especially but eventually settled down to peaceful co-
existence. They definitely preferred canary, hemp and white millet, taking
a little greenfood and a few mealworms. In roomy, uncrowded quarters
the male is bold, displays himself well, and is a cheerful and regular song-
bird. I think they would make a positive addition to a roomy mixed un-
crowded aviary.

Not much has been written about this bird in confinement, least of all
breeding. I note that it was first bred by Teschemaker in 1909, but was
delighted to see that P.J. Adams bred them in 1981 and reported the de-
tails on the front page of Cage and Aviary Birds (1st May, 1982). They
bred in a roomy, well-planted aviary. After a couple of occasions when the
nestlings died at five weeks, Mr. Adams took a brood from the nest at
eight days and hand-reared them. Not enough breeders bother to report
their breedings and many of those who do fail to give the kind of details
that other aviculturists find particularly relevant. Mr. Adams is one of the
good ones and he reports on diet in great detail. The staple diet for his
Cirl Buntings is plain canary, paddy rice and millet sprays. In the breeding
season they also have Avivite insectile mixture mixed with grated cheese,
moistened with honey, and blended with chopped mealworms peppered
with Vionate. A point of distinction worth noting is that 30 to 40 moths
were taken daily, collected with the aid of a mercury lamp.

paler with dark brown on the head instead of black. The books may refer
to this bird as Siberian Meadow Bunting and Demenf ev gives each race a
different adjective.
The Siberian Red-eared Bunting, E.c. cioides , is basically a Siberian
bird and it has reddish-brown ear-coverts as the name suggests. The Chin-
ese Red-eared Bunting E.c. castaneiceps comes from China and Korea and
has brown ear-coverts. Both races may migrate a little southwards in the
winter but appear not to reach the areas from which birds are commonly
exported to Europe. A few may come out of Hong Kong. The Japanese
Red-eared Bunting E.c. ciopsis has black ear-coverts and does not occur
outside Japan.
For me, it is a common bird, that can be found easily in lowland forest
and cultivated fields and open countryside. The male is a bold and fre-
quent singer, perching on an exposed branch and seems quite unafraid of
one approaching close. I have kept a few pairs for painting and found them
to settle very well. Females were far less steady than males. I also acquired
a fine pair of the Chinese race which I was fortunate enough to be able
to send to England a couple of years ago for a serious A.S.P.E.B.A. breeding
attempt. My diary contains the following notes on feeding: great fondness
for canary seed, and took canary mixture readily but ignored the hemp.
Mealworms were taken occasionally but not with the frantic enthusiasm
that some buntings display. A female kept over one winter settled well and
sang well and sweetly in the spring before being released. The Chinese
birds were enthusiastic bathers but in contrast the Japanese birds were not.

virtually nothing has been recorded that can encourage the aviculturist. A
more recent breeding by Mr. Hodges of Devizes was printed in Cage and

sparsely planted. The young were fed on soaked seed, small maggots, "nectar
blend", and in sec tile mixture, and the report also made mention of
"...ants' eggs when available". There was some aggressive behaviour
toward a Singing Finch and a cock Firefinch. the Singing Finches were
removed at one point.

Bunting. He found it to be very lark-like, rather delicate, and never hardy.
In his considerable experience it did better in a large flight. He said it* took
a wide variety of food. I watched it in the giant walk-through bird zoo
aviary in Singapore where it was obviously doing very well. I suspect that
climate is a key factor.There is a good recent reference to the breeding
of the Black-crested Bunting Melophus lathami by Mats Tell in the
Avicultural Magazine (1983, Vo. 89, 3, pp. 133-135). I believe it is the
same species as M. melanicterus.

6-7 in (15-18 cm) long, sparrow-sized and rounded of body. At a glance
a typical North American bunting. Brownish above with brown to black
streaking and centres of flights^ white edges to median wing coverts and
pale tips to greater wing covers give two wing bars. Blackish stripes on
head, white superciliaries with the part between the eye and the bill yellow.
Distinctive difference is white throat with greyish cheeks, sides of throat
and upper breast. There is a colour form of this species with the super-
ciliary cream or pale brown.
Juvenile birds are duller, more streaked below, and less distinctly
marked on the head. It is not so easy to tell juveniles from freshly-moulted
adults in the autumn.
According to Peterson, the two colour forms, brown-striped heads and
black-and-white striped heads, occur in both sexes, but the species pairs
polymorphically. However, this is not confirmed in the Audubon encyclo-
paedia.
This is a ground-feeding species - like so many North American buntings.
It hops forward over leaves and ground debris, scratching with a forward-
and-sideways kicking movement, each foot moving outwards. They are
noisy and active feeders. It is important to know this about these and
related species because it makes them somewhat unsuitable as cage birds.
I have kept them in small normal cages, and large flight cages. In the
latter I have covered the floor of the cage with peat, leaves and bark, and
scattered seed and mealworms. In this way, the birds kept active and
obviously in better condition. Sick birds recovered much more rapidly
in this cage type. However, the mess caused in the room is not funny, and
dust will get everywhere, so be warned. They are excellent birds for a
roomy open aviary that is well planted with shrubs and trees where you

For some reason this was the most common species to crash into
the shore line windows in Chicago. To begin with, I brought every dazed
staggering bird home - up to a dozen at a time - but my limited facilities
could not cope. I kept a late juvenile over winter one year and it was a
model cage bird. My notes suggest that it is not an aggressive bird under
normal circumstances (I kept singing males in the spring). It was the
first species to the clean bath every morning and first to the mealworm
bowl. In North America it is too common to be regarded as an ideal
aviary subject, but clearly it is a species well worth keeping and studying.
Incidentally it has hybridised with several other American sparrows.
HARRIS&amp;apos;S SPARROW Zonotrichia querula
Eight individuals of this species were donated to the Lincoln Park Zoo,
Chicago, while I lived there. The curator gave them a large (20 ft/6 m
long or more) flight with a few companions like thrushes to provide a little
variety and extra interest for the public. I visited often, drew them, and
discussed them. They seemed to be rather dull in the sense that they sat
around a lot doing nothing. In contrast a Shama and some Swainson's
Thrushes that I remember^ were always active and on the move, and a
White Wagtail was a joy, running up and down the stream and pond.
Harris&amp;apos;s Sparrow is a big bird and apparently a peaceful and gentle species.

Sparrows, these birds are very intelligent and will never enter a trap twice.
They quickly learned to spot a mist net and would jink up and over, or
into reverse with amazing skill.
One year I caught several individuals with balled swellings of the feet.
Most of these I kept in an attempt to cure them. Some bad cases required
surgery, but in general I found a vitamin-rich diet, combined with daily
application of a cortisone cream, usually did the trick. Some cases were
actually cured by diet alone. It seemed to me that the habit some people
had of throwing out rice and white bread was causing the damage.
Herbert Murray wrote to me in Venezuela to tell me of his experience
with the species. He said: "The last time I had this bird it bred in my
aviaries. The nest was placed near the roof about 6 ft (lm 83) above
ground level. The adjoining aviary was being re-roofed and the cock bird
escaped. There were young in the nest at the time. The cock did not
disappear but stayed close by, hunting for insects which it passed to the
hen through the wire roof. When repairs were completed the cock was
recaptured and returned to the family. The young were reared."
To the best of my knowledge that is the only recorded breeding of the
Rufous-collared Sparrow. Incidentally, in my book I wrote " females
are similar but are a little larger." That may well be true of southern
races from Argentine or Chile, but in Venezuela I found the bird to be
impossible to sex visually. There is a tremendous amount of variation of
plumage. I once drew a series of detailed head markings to check this
and provide a record and came to the conclusion that the coloured plas-
tic bands were not really necessary as - with a bit of concentration and
practice - every individual could be identified by its head and throat
patterns.

5-6Vi in (12.5 - 16.5 cm) long; sparrow-sized, brownish above and
whitish below, heavily streaked with darker browns. The streaks of the
breast form a spot in the centre. The adult male will sing frequently and
at length from one of several favourite song posts, and the large spot in
the centre of the breast is a sure identification of this species. It is quite
variable in density and amount of colouring (there have been 31 races
described) and difference in plumage is no diagnostic to sex at all.
In my experience it is a bird of suburban gardens, parks and shrubby
woodland, but in fact it ranges over a wide variety of habitat. The Song
Sparrow feeds on the ground, taking insects of various kinds, berries
and small fruits, and all kinds of seeds. I found it very easy to keep on a
diet of mixed seed, a few mealworms and seeding weeds like chickweed.
It is a highly territorial species, and a fit male will drive other males away

with fierce energy. I have no doubt that in a mixed collection a fit male
Song Sparrow might cause problems if there are similarly-plumaged species
present.
Mrs. Nice wrote a great deal about the Song Sparrow forty or so years
ago, and I believe that her exhaustive studies included keeping birds in
cage and aviary. Anybody fortunate to be able to keep a pair would be
well advised to obtain copies of Mrs. Nice's work, if possible. The Song
Sparrow is a night migrator and so was one of species I collected in
numbers as a result of window strikes at crack of dawn. One bird that I
picked up had a broken leg and a dropped wing. It was extremely ner-
vous for the first couple of weeks but it gradually settled, and became
quite tame. The wing healed, but always drooped a little. Similarly the leg
also mended, and was able to grip a perch but it too was permanently a
little askew. I kept this bird in a flight cage with a pair of Bengalese. The
Bengalese had a globular wicker basket that they always roosted in, and
pretended to breed in. To my fascination the Song Sparrow always roosted
in this basket, sharing it with the female Bengalese. The male Bengalese,
however, could not take this and would go off to a quite corner to roost
alone.
This individual Song Sparrow sang a great deal, softly and very sweetly,
and also during the night. I was very sad to release it late in May by which
time it was clearly fit and healthy again.

In the wild this is a secretive, skulking and shy little bird that seems to
live entirely on the floor of dark shrubby woodland. Roger Tory Peterson

The individuals I kept all settled very well and quickly but remained
nervous when in human company. They were quite vociferous birds
when held, I remember. Whilst they would undoubtedly do well in an
aviary - and a well-planted flight could well induce them to breed - the

5-6 in (12.5-15.5cm) long, it is a smaller bird than its measurements
suggest because of a longer tail than is usual in American sparrows. It is a
rusty brown bird above, not so streaked as most finches, and buffy below
without any streaking. The bill is a distinctive pink, and there is a notice-
able whitish eye ring. The sexes are alike and I was not able to find any
difference among those that I found.
One bird I found almost dead during the spring migration of 1978 I
took home and placed in a small cage with a mystery Munia hybrid that
I had been given. It settled immediately, becoming close (literally) friends
with the Munia. They roosted tightly snuggled up to each other. It took a
wide variety of seeds, soft food and a few mealworms. It impressed me as
being a lively and active bird, rather tit-like in its behaviour. Another
individual that I picked up settled down very well but I see from my notes
that while it ate a variety of seeds, it showed no interest in mealworms,
fruit or greenfood.

cover among grass. It can be seen when a breeding male perches on a high
grass stem or shmb twig to sing. Sad to say, I only caught it once, and kept
it for a couple of months. My diary records: delightful little bird that
creeps about the floor of its cage, preferring to feed on the ground. It will

impressed by their size, for they are big finches. I was also impressed at the
considerable variation in plumage - amount of rufous, extent of streaking,
etc. It would be tempting to infer some sexual dimorphism here but there
is none. Despite the large size of the species, I found it to be peaceful and
none of the smaller sparrows ever seemed to feel threatened. One individual
had obviously crashed very heavily into the windows for it was badly con-
cussed and had great difficulty co-ordinating its feeding. It would crack
seed and crumble it but not actually swallow. It went light and died, one
of the very few losses I ever experienced in Chicago.
Having now seen a lot of this species in the wild, I can thoroughly
endorse my earlier remarks in my book. It is a handsome finch and well
worth the space it would need. It is also a fine songster, considered by
many to be the best of the American sparrows. Incidentally, my notes
indicate that Fox Sparrows will eat a wide variety of seeds, but I made no
record of them taking mealworms.

before it showed signs of life. I kept it over winter and released it in the
spring. It was an utter joy to keep. Despite its large size it was quite peace-
ful and never threatened another bird. It came into full song in the early
spring. Just two days after releasing the male, I collected a female in exactly
the same place where I had found the male six months earlier. It was in
mueft better shape, and was released just a week later.

In my notes I recorded that the sexes are alike. This is not accurate. In
the field in autumn they are certainly all very much alike, and a freshly-
moulted male will look exactly like an old female. In the spring, however,
the males are clearly a more distinctive grey, lacking the brownish wash of
the female. Immature birds in the autumn have a slight streaking on the
breast and flanks.
I picked up considerable numbers of these birds, both live and dead.
They were always lively and highly-strung and in most cases were released
as soon as they were feeding well and obviously recovered. Those that I
kept for longer periods remained shy and nervous. They are similar to the
Diuca Finch Diuca diuca in appearance, but very different in personality.
My birds always kept to the floor of their cages and it was rare to see them
perched. I once saw a couple in a dealer's cage in Chicago. The man ob-
viously knew he was running foul of the law by keeping a native bird but
he claimed they came into the country with a bunch of exotics. As in my
direct experience, they sat about on the floor of the cage.
In America the Junco is often called the Snow Bird as it appears in
numbers when snow is on the ground, and it is a common visitor to
feeding stations. On these occasions it will often fly to a bird table to
feed, but will clearly prefer to feed on the ground searching for scattered
seeds. I have no experience of any of the races other than the Slate-coloured.
From a study of their varying habitats, nonetheless, I would guess they
would all respond to a similar care and diet in an aviary.

My diary in Venezuela reads as follows: recently fledged birds caught at
Camatagua, late October *75. Adult male and young female kept. They
sorted over seeds furiously, obviously looking for something else. Gave
both mixtures, plus insectile mix, green grass seeds and mealworms. The
latter were quickly eaten, also a mealworm beetle. The female accepted
handfeeding three times, but she was very weak and did not adapt quickly.
The handfeed was a mix of cream cheese, chopped mealworms and Vionate.
She was well-streaked on the breast, slightly greyer with the cap definitely
browner. An immature male was caught showing short but well defined
crest (half in "paint brushes"). It was quite vociferous when caught.
These are surprising birds in the wild and definitely not regular "finches".
They are rather like regular warblers found in woodland, feeding among
the leaves in low canopy foliage and dense shrubberies where there is
little or no seed to be found. Over a couple of years I caught them many
times and often kept them for a day or two deliberately to see if they
would take seed. I always had difficulty, usually serious difficulty in keep-

ing them. They never took dry seed, and sometimes would not even take
mealworms. I often sat by a netting station in the foothills and watched
them hunting for insects beneath the leaves. Males can occasionally be
seen singing, short simple bursts, repeated continually. A song that was not
at all structured or melodic according to my ear.
The reader should note that these notes refer to newly-caught birds.
I have had 20 years' experience with keeping newly-caught wild birds in five
continents and rate this species as one of the most difficult. Birds that
survive in the bird trade must be rather robust. The fact that they take
seed is no reason to keep them on such a diet. I revise my book, they
should not be treated as if they were "normal" buntings. Incidentally, I
have been told by a friend that the Sibley egg white protein analysis
studies indicate that the Coryphospingus and Rhodospingus are tanagers.

Herbert Murray told me about a pair he had kept. They preferred 'a
low bush to live in'. His birds attempted to breed one year. According to
Herbert, they built a perfectly good nest, laid a full clutch, sat and brooded
perfectly, and hatched them. However, a pair of European Goldfinches had
built their nest close by, and their brood hatched about the same time.
Both adult Red-crested Finches seemed to be distracted by the nestling
Goldfinches, and fed them rather more often than they did their own
brood. Unfortunately, the Goldfinches did not return the compliment.
The Red-cresteds would feed the Goldfinches whole mealworms, which
appeared to go down very well.
The outcome of the story is that the Goldfinches fledged, strong and
healthy, while the Coryphospingus died in the nest.
I bought a pair of these birds in Caracas. They were part of a shipment
from Argentina. They mixed in very well with other small finches in
their enclosure. They adored mealworms, took lettuce eagerly, and were
equally fond of apple and orange. I have not observed them in the wild. In
Chicago there were a few in the open birdhouse of the Lincoln Park Zoo.
Under pseudo-tropical conditions they behaved very much like the Pileated
Finches in Venezuela. There was an excellent report in Cage and Aviary
Birds recently by Stuart K. Johnson. The birds successfully bred in a small
planted aviary shared only with some Chinese Painted Quail. The young
were reared on "small live food and egg yolk". Mr. Johnson declared the
ambition to establish a breeding strain.

its behaviour in this habitat it has apparently developed much the same
set of characteristics, being intelligent, bold, strident but very wary of man.
For about 18 months I set traps in and around my garden, banding every
bird I caught and carefully noting all its specifics before releasing it. The
Saffron Finch proved to be a very hard bird to trap. A decoy would always
pull in immatures and if one were able to catch one of a pair, using it as a
decoy would be sure to catch the other, but, as with House Sparrows, it is
almost impossible to catch the same bird twice.
Venezuelan Saffron Finches are sexually polymorphic and it is extremely
difficult to distinguish the sexes unless in the hand. With a known (banded
as a rule) pair under regular observation, the male can be seen to be bigger,
bolder and more upright.
They retain juvenile plumage until their third ye ar, pairing and breeding
in the second year. During this second year males show more yellow than
the females, a difference not noticeable in the first, third or, as far as I
could tell, subsequent years. The fully adult male in definitive plumage
tends to be more orange on the crown than his mate.
The many younger birds I kept all settled well and were amiable
enough. Older birds tend to be more aggressive. I agree with Arthur Butler
when he said many years ago that sparrow would be a more appropriate
appellation than finch. However, the rest of the genus is a homogenous
group of grassland finches, and S. flaveola seems to be the aberrant one.

BLACK-FACED GRASSQUIT Tiaris bicolor omissa

<bodyText confidence="0.9984425" page_id="56320092"  page_num="168" year="" vol="">
In my book, I correctly described the male as being dull olivaceous all
over with a black head, but somewhat misleadingly described the female as
being a "duller, drabber version". I failed to convey that she lacks any
black on head or breast. This is an important distinction to prevent a
young male being taken for a female. Immatures are a duller, slightly
browner olive but males show traces of black at a very early age. However,
they do not acquire the rich black until a full moult.
Thanks to a very exhaustive and comprehensive banding programme, I
did a thorough population study in the suburb of Caracas where I lived. I
found the old males to be quite territorial, defending an area the size of a
tennis court, but many immatures drifted through, hanging around for
weeks and months. Fully black-faced males were immediately challenged
and driven away by fierce song and display chases.
The nest is a spherical affair made entirely of dry grasses with an en-
trance hole at the side, normally placed in a shrub or bush 3-5 ft from the
ground. The nestlings will eject themselves very easily, as do all tropical
species in my experience, then sit dejectedly in some secluded spot
chirruping regularly. I found that if nestlings were placed in a cage, the

parents would still come to feed them.
They settle very easily in captivity and, like their cogenors, the better-
known Cuban and Olive Finches, are good subjects for domestication.
They take all kinds of seed readily, some fruit (mine liked orange and
papaya) and I often saw them combing the stems of weeds apparently
looking for insects, aphids, or something similar. Paul Schwarz and I both
found it an easy to bird to handrear.

DULL-COLOURED GRASSQUIT Tunis (Sporophila) obscura
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9874576875" page_id="56320093"  page_num="169" year="" vol="">
I found this bird along the northern cordillera of Venezuela. It is such a
dull-coloured bird amongst the brackens and brown grasses as to be very
hard to see. When one flies up out of a hummock and drops down into
some ferns it looks exactly like the very common Black-faced Grassquit.
However, an adult male of the latter will defy you with a burst of song as
you pass, and it is possible to find him quite often because of this. I am
not aware of the Dull-coloured Grassquite doing this. Both Paul Schwarz
and I kept it with other Tiaris spp. and with some Sporophila spp. Paul
went to far as to hand-rear them and record the songs, calls, etc., and make
sound spectrographs. Neither of us had any doubt that this bird is a Tiaris
Grassquite and not a Sporophila seedeater, as listed in most reference
books today.
It does, in fact, have a song, but it is much weaker than that of the
Black-faced. The sexes are absolutely alike. It is very easy to cater for.
JACARINI FINCH Volatinia jacarini
I would like to add to the description I wrote in 1970 that the female
may be distinguished from all other grassquits by the streakings on throat,
breast and flanks. Immatures are very similar to adult females but are
generally a little more olivaceous but young males show some black on the
wing coverts very early on. Once some black has begun to show, they
begin to sing.
They take to cage life easily and settle down almost immediately, but
an adult male in breeding condition takes a long while to come back into
song, although one male I caught was in full song again within 24 hours of
being placed in a cage. They were the first birds to enter any decoy trap,
indeed if they are in the vicinity it is difficult to catch other birds without
resort to a mist net. They will invariably gorge themselves on millet before
then attempting to find a way out.
Having now seen the bird in the wild on countless occasions, I can say
that the novelty of the display song-and-dance flight should not be denied
either the bird or the owner, and they should definitely be kept in an
open flight outdoors. I noted two successful breeding reports in 1975.

Sporophila lineola
These two birds both occur in Venezuela; they are migratory but seem
to have the most fascinating overlapping range. One is an off-season visitor
in the other's breeding range and vice versa. I believe lineola ranges and
breeds further south than bouvronides which is more northern. The only
significant difference between them physically is a white stripe along the
crown of lineola. De Schauensee seems to be of the opinion that they are
conspecific. The late Paul Schwarz carried out lengthy comparative studies
from hand-rearing both types to recording call notes, display songs, etc.
Then to the west of Venezuela appears another form, probably a true
species, the Black and White Seedeater S. luctuosa , which has no white on
the head, nor any white on the rump. But there are specimens in the field
which are intermediary between any two of the three, or all three!
The fully adult male has a white rump, not scalloped black as in
younger birds. The song is a typical Sporophila song, being a strung-out
series of very attractive warbles and whistles. It always begins the same
way with predictable phrasing but gradually develops until it ends with
loss of pattern and free improvisation. I kept several in all combinations
and collections. Males together bicker and occasionally scrap - when
breeding they will scrap fiercely. A pair will settle well but the male will
sing much less. Females settle less easily and tend to be more nervous.
They prefer the various millet seeds to any other, both dry and fresh.
They have never shown any interest in mealworms, softfood and virtually
none in fruit.

I then found a female, a lone bird as part of a mixed shipment from
Holland. The pair settled very well. The male sang less often, and not
anywhere near as long rambling as before. In a large cage with other
birds he has become mildly aggressive to other seedeaters, but not
bullying. The female is very peaceable. They were placed in a large flight
cage alone, settled very happily with never a bicker. They loved lettuce,
but only sampled orange. Then in the early summer I was transferred to

possibly sibling species, if not races all of S. minuta.

<bodyText confidence="0.98965815" page_id="56320096"  page_num="172" year="" vol="">
I bought a male in very poor condition from a boy at the side of the
road in the interior of Venezuela, November 1974. It took three months
for the bird to recover and gain fresh plumage, but it became a fine bird,
very steady and an excellent songster. However, it was very aggressive,
would chase away any bird twice its size and would complain vociferously
if another bird sat on the same perch. (The cage was about 5 ft cube) It
took all kinds of seed, fresh grass, apple and pear but did not like orange
or banana. It was an enthusiastic bather. I caught a female for him and
she settled well, her black bill looked large and out of proportion. I
released them once painted. Subsequently I caught a beautiful male in
immaculate condition and took it to paint and compare. It was still wild
and unsteady after two months, when I released it. About this time, while
netting humming birds for photography and identification, we caught a
pair of Slate-coloured Seedeaters S. schistacea, a species that would be
virtually indistinguishable unless the two were side by side. The white
throat patches are not consistently diagnostic as they do not appear in all
schistacea and may appear in intermedia. Side-by-side the Slate-coloured
Seedeater is larger, longer, and slimmer, but the key in any case is the bill,
and I trust that my sketch shows clearly the narrower upper mandible of
schistacea. It is not sufficiently clear in the illustration in my book.

Another very similar grey sporophila is the Plumbeous Finch S. plum-
bed. The race that I am familiar with is S.p. whitley ana. It is virtually
identical to the Grey Seedeater but has a brownish-horn bill, and whitish
chin and mesials . It replaces S. intermedia at higher elevations. In my ex-
perience it is a shy, solitary species. Males will select a high exposed branch
for a lookout post.

Whilst visiting Peru in 1978 and 1979 I saw many small finches in the
bird markets. Mostly they were either S. peruvianus or the Drab Seedeater
S. simplex. It is a slightly larger bird than the average Sporophila , being
drab olive-sandy all over. The bill and feet are horn-coloured in both sexes
and juveniles, but paler in juveniles. I saw plenty of these birds around
Lima and in September (the time of both visits), males were singing
on an upmost exposed branch every time, and chasing each other around
vigorously. They certainly ignored other seedeaters (I saw S. peruvianus
and S. telasco in the same areas) but I gained the impression they might be
quite bothersome in confinement.

REARING HYBRID HISPANIOLAN CONURES

West Indian Aratinga conures have never had a wide appeal in aviculture.

This is due in part to their largely all-green coloration and rarity in captivity.
Most are legally protected, the exception being Aratinga nana of Jamaica,
and A.p. pertinax on St. Thomas. The former is considered an agricultural
pest, and the latter is an introduced species brought to the island by early
Dutch seamen.
The largest and least known of these insular Aratingas is the Hispani-
olan A. chloroptera. A predominately green bird, it has a conspicuous
white periophthalmic ring and red under wing-coverts. These two features
are prominent even in flight, and could prove an ideal field identification.

<bodyText confidence="0.999067880952381" page_id="56320098"  page_num="174" year="" vol="">
A. chloroptera occurs on Hispaniola and two off-lying islands, Beata
and Soana. It favours jungles, but also occurs in the lowlands. It is an
agricultural pest to pigeon peas ('gandules', the vernacular in the Dominican
Republic) and guavas, also possibly corn. Preference for arboreal termitoria
as nesting cavities is shown, but if these are absent, hollow trees or palms
are used.
Aviculturally speaking, it is a rarity that has been bred in very few col-
lections in the Dominican Republic, Denmark and the USA. In the latter,
it was bred around 1936 by Vance Wright. Subsequently, hybrids were
reared at Lincoln Park Zoological Gardens, Chicago, Ill., and in my collec-
tion.
The single bird that is now in my possession was privately imported
around 1975. He resided at a zoological park in New Jersey until early
1981 when he arrived in my collection.
In behaviour there are affinities with the Noble Macaw Ara nobilis , but
his voice is much harsher and does not resemble that of any other insular
Aratinga.
When I acquired the bird, I hoped to obtain a mate for it so that a
breeding programme for this species could be started. This, however, was
easier said than done and up until now, none has been located. I would
very much like to hear from any American aviculturist who has this species.
Also, the bird is extremely aggressive and refused all mates until a
female Nanday Conure Aratinga nenday was offered. This bird had been a
friend's pet for many years, and had never been offered a mate. On intro-
duction, he immediately walked over to her and fed her. If there is such a
thing as avian love at first sight, this is a supreme example.
While I do not favour hybridisation, the Nanday was offered out of
necessity; I wanted to know my bird's potential as a breeder and to learn
more about his reproductive behaviour.
After being together for exactly two months, the first of four eggs was
laid; three were fertile, one was clear. After 26 days of incubation, the first
chick hatched. It was totally covered in white down, very much resembling
a true Aratinga chloroptera. Two more chicks hatched, and were all removed
for hand-rearing so that notes on their development could be made.
The secondary down was very dark grey, different in this respect from
chloroptera chicks which have an almost white secondary down. Develop-
ment was similar to that of other Aratingas , except that growth was much
slower and that chicks were extremely aggressive. When the eldest chick
was four weeks old, it was severely injured on the bill and wing; this degree
of aggression has been noted in other conures, notably Aratinga jendaya.
After a fortnight the three chicks were reunited, and no further problems
were encountered.

At three months old the chicks differed slightly from the male parent
in coloration. The plumage is green, except for the breast feathers which
have a bluish cast, and the thighs which have red feathers, undoubtedly in-
herited from the hen bird. The eye-ring is like that of the male parent
but is off-white.This has lightened and may continue to do so as the
young age. A conspicuous feature is the dark green crown, and reddish
coloured feathers that surround the lower mandible. Underwing coverts
show slight traces of orange, but this colour will probably intensify with
age. In true chloroptera young the underwing coverts take about a half-
year to reach the intensity of adults.
The mandible is large with grey streaking near the base. Feet and
tongue are dark grey.
The young are extremely attractive, much more so than the male parent
but with a considerably higher inflection to their voice. This makes them
almost unbearable and in this respect they are surpassed only by Golden
C onure s A ratinga guarouba .
The pair went back to nest, and hatched three young from four eggs;
one was infertile. These three chicks are almost identical to the first,
differing only in the conspicuous red feathers on the bend of the wing and
underwing coverts.
If no hen chloroptera is found, one of the hybrid young will be paired
to its father.

recently several chloroptera , which had been imported by a private avi-

due to her young age (under 12 months old).

We have received some interesting correspondence from Uwe Wagner in
Scharfstedt, Germany, which Stephen Lacey has very kindly translated.
Mr. Wagner is a keen ornithologist and his birdwatching expeditions have
given rise to some unconventional avicultural experiences.
In May 1982 he found a young Cuckoo at the base of a house wall,
surrounded by broken eggs. The only place it could have come from was a
Swallow's nest under the eaves, so he returned it and waited patiently.
Sure enough, the parent Swallows greeted it warmly and fed it at once,
and continued to care for us until it was fully fledged. Unfortunately, on
the day it embarked on its first flight, the young Cuckoo was surprised by
a neighbour's cat and collided with a stone pillar, breaking its wing in the
process. It had to be rescued, therefore, a second time. The wing was
repaired by Mr. Wagner and during its two-week convalescence, the bird
was* fed on a diet of caterpillars, flies, mealworms, fruit and greenstuff.
When it was fit enough, it was released.
In the same month, he discovered two pheasant's eggs in a cornfield
which would have been destroyed by the farmer's tractor if they had been
left alone. Mr. Wagner collected them and took them home.
Coincidentally, he had a solitary female Buzzard which had just laid
some eggs in a nest in her aviary and Mr. Wagner decided that it would be
an interesting experiment to see if she would rear the pheasant chicks.
She hatched them alright but failed to entice them to feed on meat. For-
tunately there was alternative food available and the chicks did not starve.
Every evening the chicks sheltered under their foster mother who cared for
them as fastidiously as any natural mother. Eventually, they too were re-
leased into the wild - and so was the Buzzard. Mr. Wagner has sent several
colour photographs showing the chicks in the nest.

As mentioned previously in this column, Black Cockatoos form a special
interest for South Australian aviculturist, Fred Bohner. Over the past few
years he has been most successful with the Red-tailed Calyptorhynchus
magnificus, an account of which has appeared in the Avicultural Magazine .
After several years of trying, he has at last managed to rear the White-
tailed C. baudinii, details of which appear in Bird Keeping in Australia.

The Echo Parrakeet Psittacula echo is the subject of an article in the
latest issue of the W. W. Brehm Fund Newsletter (Vol. 2, No. 1). The Fund
sent Indian researcher Preston Ahimaz to the island of Mauritius for three
months to initiate a thorough investigation on its status, and to propose a
management plan for the critically endangered species. The population,
which was thought to be as low as four birds, is now put at between eight
and ten. A number of suggestions were put forward, one of which was a
proposed captive breeding project. Attempts failed to capture any birds
but further efforts will be made shortly.

The Crested Shelduck Tadoma cristata, long thought extinct was report-
ed in the Journal fur Ornithologie (125:1) as being sighted in the Demo-
cratic People's Republic of Korea in 1971; six birds were seen at the
mouth of the Pouchon River where it flows into the Sea of Japan. At the
18th International Ornithological Congress held in Moscow during 1982,
Dr. Eugeniusz Nouak put forward the suggestion that a full search should
be made for the bird which he clearly feels is still extant. Likely areas in-

Two exciting hatchings have occurred at San Diego Zoo during the
early part of this year. Three Pesquet's Parrots Psittrichas fulgidus chicks
are now being hand-reared and will eventually be placed on exhibit once
adult plumage is attained. In 1985, a pair of Chinese Monal Pheasant
Lophophorous Ihuysi were received from the People's Republic of China
and, with the aid of artificial insemination, four chicks of this brilliantly
coloured pheasant have been hatched.

The overall population of Kirtland's Warbler Dendroica kirtlandii is
believed to be as low as 200 pairs. Nesting in a tiny region of northern
Michigan and wintering in the Bahamas, this tiny bird is causing problems
for the protectionists who are trying to increase its numbers. The bird
nests only in stands of Christmas-tree size jack pines, growing on dry,
sandy soil, with low ground cover. Under natural conditions, this habitat
is maintained only by forest fire and therefore occurs only in scattered
tracts. Although jack pines grow across the continent from Nova Scotia
to British Columbia, a combination of factors seem to be restricting popu-
lation growth. Experiments have shown that the bird will nest amongst
red pines so it may give preference to size and form. Ground cover is also
of importance as the tiny nest is embedded in the sand under low ground
cover. Under the Endangered Species Act, 135.000 acres of suitable
habitat are now protected, resulting in the population stabilising.

The Hooded Guan Oreophasis derbianus , considered by Indians to
make a choice meal, is the first bird to be wiped out by hunters when new
areas of cloud forest are cleared in Central America. Its population is now
thought to be well below 1.000 and its habitat is being cleared at an ever-
increasing rate. Though Mexico is working towards the creation of a
reserve for its small population of this bird in Chiapas, the Guan has no
protection in Guatemala.

Field studies have revealed that Eucalyptus flowers, the main food
source for many lories and lorikeets, produce very little nectar, insuf-
ficient to cover the daily requirements of even the smallest member of
this family. However, the flowers of Eucalyptus produce large quantities
of pollen suggesting a constituent energy source. The tongues of most
lories and lorikeets are adapted for the collection of pollen without damag-
ing the delicate flower and several species, on dissection, have been found
to have their alimentary canal completely filled with pollen. Because of
these findings, Dr. Karl-L Schuchmann suggests, in an article in Trochilus
(1984) 5: 45-48 that pollen, instead of being mixed in with the nectar of
captive lories and lorikeets, should be offered dry in a separate container.
The same issue of Trochilus contains, amongst others, papers on the
Fiery-tailed Awlbill Avocettula recurvirostris and Batis and Platysteira
flycatchers.

The third Arctic Tern Sterna paradisaea recorded from Australia was
ringed as a nestling in the Fame Islands on 25th June 1980, and just 115
days later was picked up in Melbourne after being attacked by Spur-winged
Plovers. Unfortunately it died shortly afterwards (Birds, Vol. 9, No. 6).

PROPOSED SURVEY OF THE HOODED SISKIN
Carduelis cucullata

The Red or Hooded Siskin, endemic to Venezuela, is a highly endan-
gered species on the verge of extinction in the wild. The I.U.C.N. Red
Data Book lists this species with an unknown population, but states that
there has been a considerable and seemingly irreversible decline in recent
years.
One of the main reasons for this decline is the great demand in the cage
bird trade, as it hybridises willingly with domestic canaries, producing the
highly prized "red factor". Although protected in its homeland, illegal
collection still persists, thus threatening remaining populations further.
Following a letter in the Avicultural Magazine (1983, p. 120) by Mary
Goodwin and resultant correspondence between several aviculturists, it
has been decided to attempt an analysis of present captive populations to
commence on 1st January 1985. The aim is to assess not only numbers but
their success rate and to compile data on techniques adopted by avicul-
turists in the management of this endangered species.
We appreciate the work involved for keepers but to enable the project
to gather as much information as possible we are asking for details to be
provided under the headings listed below. Answers should be as complete
as possible, clearly defined under the separate headings, and forwarded to
the relevant collator listed at the end of this notice as soon after 1st January
as possible.

Quite a number of interesting guide books have been published recently
and readers may care to have some details:
Of these books, probably the most important is An Atlas of the Birds
of the Western Palaearctic by Colin Harrison, published by Collins (Lon-
don) (322 pages, price #12.95, ISBN 0 00 2197294). The area covered
stretches from the southernmost part of the Sahara as far north as Spitz-
bergen and Franz Josef Land, and from the Azores in the west as far east
as Afghanistan and Pakistan. There is a map for each of 639 species of
birds in the Western Palaearctic (Europe, North Africa and Middle East)
and the breeding ranges of a further 167 species from adjoining areas are
mapped to show patterns of distribution across Eurasia as a whole. This is
the first time that all such information has been made available in a single
volume.
The maps (excellently prepared by Crispin Fisher) indicate summer,
winter and resident distributions and, where relevant, periodic invasions or
irruptions and where a bird may occur on passage. The accompanying text
gives the bird's status, climatic range, typical habitats and nest sites. Whilst
this is essentially an atlas rather than a guide to the birds of the area, there
is a small line drawing of each species at the bottom of the page as an aide-
memoire. The extensive text amplifies the maps.
This is a very valuable guide, with interesting and stimulating text and
extremely good value.
Whilst in Europe, two new handbooks are welcome. The first is the
English edition of Birds of the Mediterranean and Alps by Lars Jonsson,
published by Croom Helm (160 pages, price #5.95. ISBN 0 7099 1413 X).
This volume is the last of a series of five on European birds by this well-
known ornithological artist. One hundred and seventy-two species are
described, each with a distribution map, and illustrated by the author in
most attractive watercolours showing the birds in characteristic postures
in their natural environment.
This will be a most useful, and very inexpensive field guide for visitors
to this area, particularly for holidaymakers.
The Birds of the Balearics by David A. Bannerman and W. Mary Ban-
nerman, is also published by Croom Helm (230 pages, price #29.50.
ISBN 0 7099 0679 X).
Despite the continuing attentions of resident and visiting birdwatchers,
no definitive handbook in English existed on the birdlife of the Balearic
Islands as a whole and the eminent ornithologist, Dr. David Bannerman,
started work on filling this considerable gap in the 1970s but failing eye-

sight caused him to cease work in 1978 when his wife, W. Mary Banner-
man, continued the writing. Sadly, Dr. Bannerman did not live to see the
finished work.
This is not a field guide, since only a few of the species included are
illustrated. These illustrations are contained in 12 attractive colour plates
(average six species to a plate) by Donald Watson and there are some
black and white illustrations and line drawings. The text, however, is
much more extensive, giving very ample coverage of each species - its
description, distribution, habitat, feeding habits, status, etc. Migrants are
included.
The book is a very valuable addition to the literature though its high
price and few illustrations would perhaps not make it attractive to the
hundreds of thousands of holidaymakers to this area for whom the long-
established Field Guide to the Birds of Britain and Europe by Roger Tory
Peterson (Collins) would be more appropriate and helpful.
Les Oiseaux de Chine , de Mongolie et de Coree (The Birds of China,
Mongolia and Korea) - Passerines , by R.D. Etchecopar and F. Hue, pub-
lished by N. Boubee, Paris (704 pages, price 520 francs, ISBN 2 - 85004-
037-1) follows its companion volume on the non-passerine birds of this
area, and completes the series by these two distinguished authors on The
Birds of the Near and Far East (1970) and The Birds of North Africa
(1964).
This is a monumental work covering almost 650 species. Nearly all of
the 350 species that are resident in the area covered have a distribution
map and are illustrated in 22 colour plates by Patrick Suiro and Gilbert
Amani, or in line drawings. The accompanying text describes each species
with points for identification, behaviour, breeding and local and world-
wide distribution. There is an index of latin names, vernacular names (in
French and English) as well as a useful bibliography.
With an elementary grasp of French the text is not too difficult to
follow and the comprehensiveness of this work makes it an important
addition to any ornithological library.
The Birds of Zimbabwe by Michael P. Stuart Irwin, published by
Quest Publishing Ltd., P.O. Box 567, Harare, Zimbabwe (464 pages,
price 9 Zimbabwe dollars, paperback, ISBN 0 86925 156 2) is a very
comprehensive and authoritative work on the birdlife of Zimbabwe. The
author was Curator of Ornithology and now Regional Director of the
National Museum in Bulawayo and he has drawn extensively on his many
years of museum work and field experience in Zimbabwe and neighbour-
ing territories. This is a handbook rather than a field guide and the
author's stated aim has been to set out all that is known about the distri-
bution, habitat, migration or seasonal movements and ecology of each of

the 635 species occurring in Zimbabwe.
The value of this book is much increased by the 25 superb colour
plates by Peter Fogarty which are so far above the standard usual in hand-
books and guides produced today. They are much more than just illustra-
tions, being complete pictures reminiscent of the work of the late D.M.
Henry, and are quite remarkable for their clarity, liveliness and perfect
composition.
Another book from Africa is Birds of the South-Western Cape by Joy
Frandsen, published by Sable Publishers, P.O. Box 98014, Sloane Park,
2152, Republic of South Africa (237 pages, price 27.60 Rands plus
2.0 Rands for postage, ISBN 0 620062606).
Whilst this book has been written mainly for birdwatchers in that
area of South Africa, it is of general interest because of the outstanding
quality of the photographs which have been chosen from the collections
of many South African photographers. Two hundred and sixty-two
species are described, each accompanied by a really excellent colour
photograph and these are more than adequate for identification pur-
poses, showing all the essential characteristics that differentiate similar
species. The reproduction is also of a very high standard.
The Carnegie Museum of Natural History, 4400 Forbes Avenue, Pitts-
burgh, Pennsylvania 15213, USA, publishes interesting regional fauna
guides and a complete list may be obtained from the Publications Sec-
retary. A recent example is West Virginia Birds - Distribution and Ecology,
by George Hall (Special Publication NO. 7, 190 pages, price 20.00 U.S.
dollars, plus 2.50 dollars postage. ISBN 0 935868 05 4). This is a very
interesting and excellently produced book which sets out the status of
the birdlife generally in this state as well as of the individual species
resident. There is a very comprehensive and valuable bibliography.
The Birds of the Ligonier Valley by Robert C. Leberman is Carnegie
Museum of Natural History's Special Publication No. 3 (67 pages, price
5.00 US dollars, plus 1.00 dollar postage) and is a very attractively pro-
duced survey of the present status of the birds living in this valley in
south-western Pennsylvania. It is illustrated by watercolour plates painted
by H. Jon Janisk and line drawings by Carol H. Rudy.
Finally, The Handbook of the Birds of India and Pakistan by Salim Ali
and S. Dillon Ripley is being republished by Oxford University Press, the
latest of the ten volumes to appear being No. 3: Stone Curlews to Owls
(327 pages, price #17.00, ISBN 195613023). Additional forms have been
added to the original 1969 production of this standard work, together
with four new colour plates by F.P. Bennett Jr.

Practically every country in the world now has its share of areas that
are protected for the benefit of wildlife, be they reserves or national parks.
The acquisition, management and problems associated with such areas are
rarely explained to the amateur naturalist so It Is a more than welcome
change to be given an insight into nature protection, in this instance, the
reserves that come under the wing of the Royal Society for the Protection
of Birds, Britain's premier bird protection organisation.
The contents start with a brief introduction followed by sections on
how the R.S.P.B. acquires reserves; managing reserves the R.S.P.B. way;
seabird cliffs; terns on R.S.P.B. reserves; estuaries and salt-marsh; reed-
swamps; lagoons and open water; floodmeadows; upland oak woods,
highland birchwood; lowland deciduous woodland; lowland heathland;
native pinewood; moorland in Scotland and Wales; Orkney moorland; and
a gazetteer of reserves. Two appendices cover habitats for birds in the U.K.
and reserves acquired In 1983.
The gazetteer lists alphabetically nearly 80 of the Society's more not-
able reserves, giving national grid references, directions, brief introduction,
composition of habitat, management techniques and an insight into
recorded wildlife; preference obviously is given to birds but plants, spiders,
mammals, reptiles, amphibians and insects are also touched upon where
studied.
Although the book holds little for the aviculturist, many of us have
more than just a passing Interest in wild birds and as such, this is an excel-
lent and informative guide for those wishing to visit ideal areas to see our
native species In their natural environment.

was the tour of the aviaries, a delight for everyone. Beautiful landscaping,
combined with the very practical arrangement of the aviaries, designed for
the best benefit of the birds as well as their keepers, amply testified to
Raymond Sawyer's renowned taste and knowledge. This is now generally
acknowledged worldwide to be one of the great private collections. The
birds were all in fine condition, many having bred this year, and there was
much of interest to see.
Violaceous Plantain-Eaters, or Touracos, have been bred at Chestnut
Lodge this year and reared by their parents, believed to be for the first
time in Great Britain. Scissor-billed Starlings were also bred but unfortu-
nately survived for only a few days after leaving the nest (this species is
not believed to have been bred in Britain before). Black-winged Stilts
have again bred for several years running - their first breeding at Chestnut
Lodge is also believed to be a 'first'. Ringed Plovers have bred in the
Waders' Aviary, where there were also several families of Avocets, and
White-breasted Rails with babies could be seen. Also in this aviary was an
attractive group of South American Jacanas, and the White-throated Bee-
eater and Golden-winged Sunbird, both of which Raymond has kept
since 1972 - this bee-eater must surely be the only bird of its species in this
country? Members were delighted to see the Superb Sunbirds and also
the Buff-throated Sunbird which Raymond is sure has not been seen in
Britain since the 1950s, and a magnificent pair of Toco Toucans on which
are pinned high hopes. In the tropical house could be seen a Moho or
Oriole Warbler from West Africa, and some very handsome Malayan
Black-crested Jays aroused much admiration. Other breeding successes
this year include a Satyr Tragopan, Palawan Peacock Pheasant, Green
Junglefowl, Tufted Guineafowl, Congo Peafowl, four Keas and a Stella
or Papuan Lory (probably not bred in this country since the last century).
Also on the lake in front of the house was a delightful family of six
young Pacific Brent Geese with their parents.
Throughout their tour, members were accompanied by a very tame
Common Trumpeter and a young Stanley's Crane, bred at Chestnut Lodge
this year, whilst Vulturine Guineafowl, Demoiselle Cranes, and Grey-
necked Cranes (some full-winged) strolled about the lawns in front of the
house.
After all these, and many more delightful sights, members were ready
to appreciate the magnificent tea at which Miss Ezra was a very gracious
hostess. Members sat on in the garden for a long time, renewing old
friendships, and altogether it was a most pleasant and memorable occasion.
We are particularly grateful to Miss Ezra and Mr. Raymond Sawyer for all
their hospitality and generosity in donating the entire proceeds of the
ticket money (some #144, including donations) ) to the Society's Funds.

First Breeding Medals
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992500866666667" page_id="56320112"  page_num="188" year="" vol="">
Is it not time that the Avicultural Society abandoned the practice of
awarding a medal for first breeding? In many cases, these first breedings
reflect chance rather than objectivity and are, in any event, of limited
value to either aviculture or the Avicultural Society.
Since our Society has a considerable and desirable international mem-
bership, would it not be better to establish a policy of honouring those
who have made a contribution towards avicultural advance and that these
awards should reflect our debt to people in other countries as well the
British aviculturist?
It might well be that under a new scheme, recipients would also be
some of the first-breeding Medal holders but I would suggest an award
reflecting avicultural merit, honoured by our august Society, would have
more value than the present system. This seems to me to require the
element of good fortune and, after so many years, a cynical look at what
is left to be bred for the first time!

The Lemon-breasted Canary
I read with interest the article by Neville Brickell on the Lemon-breast-
ed Canary Serinus citrinipectrus in Vol. 89, No. 3. The facts as I know and

remember them are as follows:-
In the 1950s Mr. Scheepers was trapping in Mozambique. This was his
livelihood and it can thus be assumed that he was exporting birds to Bri-
tain, U.S.A. and Europe. Either in 1958 or 1959 Mr. W. Collard (past
Chairman of the Natal Avicultural Society and Director of the Natal Zoo-
logical Gardens) and one or two members of the N.A.S. paid a visit to
Mr. Scheepers and stayed for a few days with him. Whilst looking through
the holding or stock aviaries, Mr. Collard noticed this unusual-looking bird,
and mentioning this to Mr. Scheepers, was told it was a rather funny-look-
ing Peach Canary (our local term for the South African Grey Singing Finch).
Over the next few days, Mr. Collard and his companion/s visited the
native market in Lourenco Marques and there, to Mr. Collard's amazement,
was a cage which contained another three of the same species. Although
Mr. Collard tried to buy them, the African owner would not sell. Later,

however, Mr. Collard asked Mr. Scheepers if he could buy the one he had,
and hoped that he would be able to persuade the market stall owner to
part with a mate. Mr. Scheepers then gave the bird to Mr. Collard who
luckily managed to obtain a mate from the market.
Unfortunately the birds did not live long in South Africa and their
bodies were entrusted to Mr. Monty Baddeley of the Durban Museum.
These were kept in the refrigerator until Dr. Clancy returned from leave.
When he saw the birds, his first reaction was that they were hybrids but
after due thought and consideration, Dr. Clancy and Mr. Lawson set out to
collect specimens and succeeded in doing so in 1960.
The puzzling part about this Lemon-breasted Canary saga, which is
well-known in local avicultural circles, is if Mr. Scheepers trapped about
40 examples in 1959, as stated in Mr. Brickell's article, where did they go
to? Surely if they had been exported, one of the dealers concerned would
have drawn someone's attention to them? There surely could not be 40
'funny-looking Peach Canaries' or 'hybrids'!
It would be most interesting to find out just who should be credited
with the initial discovery of this species - perhaps some of the readers
would care to give their views.
Thank you for a magnificent magazine.

The Black Siskin Carduelis atratus has only once been imported into

released from quarantine in December 1981, despite their high cost and a
previous warning from a bird breeder in Germany that they were "impos-
sible to keep alive in aviaries for long". I hoped that the climate and alti-
tude of Johannesburg might suit them, as they come from the Andes
Mountains, between 6,000 and 16,000 ft, of Peru, Bolivia, Chile and
Argentina. They were strikingly beautiful, the male being velvety black
with golden wing bar and patch under the tail. The hen was readily dis-
tinguishable by being greyish black with lemon yellow wing bars and tail
patch. They had an attractive hovering type of flight in which the yellow
under the wings became visible, and they were reminiscent of some huge,

exotic butterfly. They are far larger than the more commonly kept Siskins
being more the size of a Greenfinch but with small, sharp beaks.
I attempted to acclimatise my pair in a spacious 6ft cage in a birdroom
in which I breed Red Siskins. Here the use of a heater thermostatically
controlled, and a humidifier is available. Black Siskins, however, have the
same dense type of feathering as most European birds and seem adapted
to withstand low temperatures.
The main problem with them manifested itself at once, viz. an extreme
reluctance to eat anything and great shyness even about taking water. I
had hoped that niger seed and maw seed, on which Red Siskins subsist,
would be an easy answer, but they would not touch either. I supplied
every type of seed and at every level, even fixing little dishes among the
branches supplied for perching, and finally covering the whole floor with a
thick layer of mixed seeds, a procedure that works with some newly-caught
difficult species like the Green Twinspot. I tried every kind of softfood
and greenfood I could think of, but not even ripening millet sprays grown
in my garden or bunches of chickweed laden with ripening seedpods would
tempt them.
In desperation I searched through my avicultural literature but, apart
from Robin Re stall's accurate description in Finches and other seed-eating
Birds , I could find only one avicultural account written by T.F.M. William-
son in Bird Notes of April 1919. He had written about his pair in a mixed
collection in his Californian aviary. His Black Siskins "fed entirely on
ordinary rape seed, and though they ate sparingly of lettuce ..they
never touched any grass or other wild seeds." Rape was the one seed that
I had not tried, as I Jiad given it no chance among such luxuries as gold-of-
pleasure, teazle and an excellent wild grass seed mixture. I rushed out and
bought both black and red rape, in the hope that the problem was solved.
This was the first seed in which my Black Siskins showed any interest,
but mine merely picked up the seeds and rolled them around in their beaks
for some time before dropping them to the floor again. I gave all seeds
dry and soaked and in various stages of germination, but nothing availed.
The male only lived for 20 days and the female for 26 days. Presumably
they took a little water when I was not looking and at long intervals they
swallowed a few grains of the smallest yellow millet. The manner in which
they fed was erratic. They would appear puffed up and about to die, then
presumably they swallowed a little seed and they would be better for a
day or so. In the end they lost interest altogether and I force-fed them
with a syringe. This feeding seemed to totally disagree with them and from
this point on, I realised that the whole distressing battle was lost.
Mr. Bill Steel bought a pair on the same day as I did and we compared
notes. His were housed in an aviary with an indoor shelter and outdoor

flight The hen starved to death within 10 days, but the cock took to
plain canary seed and was fond of lettuce. It liked to go out into the
flight and sing in the sun. We thought that this bird, having settled down,
might live to a good age, but within three months it was unexpectedly
found dead one morning.
This species was mentioned in one advertisement in England at that
time, so presumably a small number of them were on the market in
Europe. It would be very good to hear from any fancier who fared better
with this difficult species. The other pairs in South Africa sold quickly
and I do not know what became of them. The silence about them would
indicate that they, too, quickly perished.
Aviculture is not only about success stories, and these should not be
the only stories reported in our magazines. There is as much, or more, to
be learnt from failures. If I had my chance over again I would try the
Black Siskins in an outside aviary with much natural cover in which they
could retreat. This might give them a greater degree of confidence and
stimulate them into eating a satisfactory diet. Or they might be a species
that is stimulated by the flock, because the batch imported seemed to
survive the three-week quarantine period in comparatively unattractive
surroundings with relative ease. \0x25A0

Many members will remember the artist David Reid-Henry who was an
active member of the Society and wrote many articles for the Avicultural
Magazine , as well as contributing 37 superb colour plates which appeared
in the Magazine between 1951 and 1971.
His widow, Louise Reid-Henry, is preparing a catalogue of all his works
and will be pleased to hear from any members who have his paintings or
who know the location of any. Strict anonymity will be preserved but
Mrs. Reid Henry would be very grateful to have a description of each
painting, its size and medium. (He signed his works 'D.M. Henry', in block
capitals).
A number of publications are being planned on the work of this
important artist and a list of his works, as complete as possible, will be of
great assistance to these projects.
If anyone can help, please write to Mrs. Reid Henry, c/o the Editor.

THE AVICULTURAL MAGAZINE welcomes original articles that have not been
published elsewhere and that essentially concern the aviculture of a particular bird or
group of birds, or that describe their natural history. Articles should be preferably
typewritten, with double spacing, and the scientific names as well as the vernacular
names of birds should be given. References cited in the text should be listed at the
end of the article. Line drawings should be in Indian ink on thick paper or card;
photographs which illustrate a particular point in the article will be used where
possible and should be clearly captioned.

residents of the montane rain forest in Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula.
The mainly green plumage is enlivened by the strikingly marked head
and chest, the double yellow and black breast-band being most distinc-
tive. The sexes are similar but the male differs in having maroon mixed
with the black of the hind-crown.
On the 27th April 1984 Chester Zoo obtained a pair of these Barbets
from a supplier in England and they were housed in one of the indoor
aviaries within the Tropical House. This aviary measures 7.0m x 2.6m
x 4.0m high and is planted with a selection of tropical plants including
Hibiscus , Asparagus plumosa and Calathea pulchella. No aggression was
shown between the Barbets and the Red-billed Hornbill Tockus erythro-
rhynchus and Sun Bittern Europygahelias which shared the same enclo-
sure.
The Barbets quickly settled in their new aviary and were fed our
standard large softbill mixture of minced beef, commercial insec tile
food, grated boiled egg, carrot and chopped apple, supplemented with
Vionate. Fresh fruit (pears, melons, grapes, plums, bananas, etc.) was
provided as in season.
On 8th May it was noticed that the Barbets had already chiselled
out several holes in the upright old tree-trunks which had originally
been provided for the White Woodpeckers Leuconerpes candidus that
had previously occupied this aviary. By 15th May the Barbets had
selected one particular hole (in a log close to the adjacent aviary, now
housing the Woodpeckers) and were spending long periods within that
hole.

R. WILKINSON &amp; W. McLEOD - FIRE-TUFTED BARBET
Two more Fire-tufted Barbets were purchased on 17th May. Lacking
the maroon hind-crown, these two presumed females (or immatures) were
housed in a different aviary within the Tropical House. Although out of
sight of the original pair, vocal contact was quickly established with fre-
quent exchanges of lengthy chiming call notes.
Over the next month, when it seemed likely that our original pair
had indeed laid in the favoured nest-hole, the Barbets were disturbed as
little as possible. On 5th June calls from the nest-log indicated that at
least one chick had hatched. We immediately provided mealworms (dusted
in Vionate) which the parents readily accepted to feed to their chicks.
From one to three mealworms were carried per nest visit. The parents
normally ran these through their mandibles several times before feeding
them to the young. To ensure that the Barbets received adequate amounts
of live food, the Sun Bittern and Red-billed Hornbill were transferred to
the adjacent aviary housing the Woodpeckers. We then started feeding
locusts in addition to the mealworms; these were accepted as suitable
rearing food by the parents although mealworms still appeared to be the
favourite food item. Both sexes fed the young. Initially one bird would
remain in the nesting hole until the second arrived with food, but later in
the nestling period both parents spent increasingly longer periods outside
the nest. Observations on 11th June suggested that the male was taking the
larger part of the burden of feeding the young. Pink mice, and later pink
rats, became the major food items over the next few weeks; these were
treated as the mealworms, being dutifully mandibulated before being
carried to the nest.
Disaster struck on 26th June when the male Barbet was found dead on
the floor of the aviary. Despite food being always available to these birds,
the post mortem examination revealed an empty gut. Why the bird had
failed to feed was not revealed. We spent an anxious few hours waiting and
watching to check whether the female would continue to feed the nestlings
in the absence of the male. The female did continue to feed the nestlings
but each time she flew to the nest-hole, the Red-billed Hornbill in the adja-
cent aviary flew at her through the wire. Relocation of the Hornbill
removed this stressful situation and on 3rd July we were rewarded with
the sight of a young Barbet peering out of the nest-hole.
Over a week elapsed before the first chick fledged on 11th July, six
weeks after the first chick calls were heard, and a second youngster
fledged on 14th July. The fledglings differed from the adults in being
slightly smaller and were paler in colour. Those parts that are green in
the adults were of a bluer shade, and the yellow parts were whiter in the
young. The fledglings also differed in having whitish rather than crimson
tipped facial bristles. Pinkish-orange orbital rings were pronounced when

they first left the nest but faded over the next few weeks. By 19th July
the youngsters were feeding themselves. Interestingly, they then rejected
the pink mice and rats on which they were reared in favour of fresh fruit,
the favoured items being apple, grapes, pear and banana.

BREEDING THE GREEN-CHEEKED AMAZON PARROT
Amazona virdigenalis
AT THE ORNITHOLOGICAL INSTITUTE, OBERHAUSEN,
GERMANY

In the summer of 1982 the Ornithological Institute, Oberhausen, was
successful in breeding Green-cheeked Amazon Parrots Amazona viridi-
genalis. Until now this Amazon has been bred rarely in captivity. After a
few successes in South Africa (Boswell Collection, 1976), England
(I. Stoodley, &amp;apos;Peterborough, 1979) and Switzerland (Mattmann, 1981),
this is the first recorded breeding in West Germany.
In the aviaries of our Institute there lives a pair of this species which
was imported in 1977 from north-eastern Mexico. The birds were placed
in an outdoor aviary, measuring 2.0 x 2.0 x 1.0m (614 x 614 x 314 ft). The
shelter measured 2.0 x 1.0 x 1.0m (614 x 3 Vi x 314 ft). Their diet consisted
of a seed mixture containing sunflower seed, peanut kernels, peanuts in
shell, pine nuts, hard maize, oats and wheat. They also had fruit, vege-
tables and dried shrimps. Very milky maize and protein food was a fav-

Green-cheeked Amazon Parrot at 11 weeks old
ourite diet for the young birds after leaving the nest-box.
In spring 1981 the parrots were given a nest-box, which was fixed in
the shelter, protected from exposure to rain and direct sunlight. Nesting
material consisting of rotten wood was placed in the base to a depth of
about 10 cm (4 in).
After a short time the birds showed great interest in the nest-box,
followed by elements of social behaviour, culminating in copulation. In
the middle of May three eggs were laid, of an average size of 26.2 x 35.2
mm, and they resembled eggs of adult Pionus parrots (see Lantermann,
1983 a).
After an incubation period of 28 days, one of the chicks hatched and
developed well for 10 days but died during a thunderstorm one night, as a
result of the stress of the adult birds. That year no second clutch was laid.
The parrots began moulting in the middle of July.
Already by March 1982 new pairing activities could be observed, es-
pecially courtship feeding and social preening. These two elements play an
important role in the social behaviour of highly developed neotropical
parrots and introduce copulation which took place several times a day.
The first egg was discovered in the nesting cavity on 15th April, followed
by a second egg on 18th April. The female started brooding on 16 th April
and the male also seemed to share this activity. The adult birds only left
the nest-box to feed and defecate (see Lantermann, 1984a).
Two chicks hatched after an incubation period of 28 days. At first the

begging sounds of the young parrots could be heard several times a day,
but in later weeks they became more and more quiet.
The development of the young birds took about nine weeks. The eyes
opened in the fourth week and the first feathers appeared at the beginning
of the fifth week. Eight weeks after hatching they were nearly fully
fledged and sometimes peeped out of their nest-box hole.
Both chicks left the nest at the end of the ninth week. Because of the
few nest inspections no exact information about the development of the
young parrots can be given here. Both young birds resembled the adult
Amazons, but only the forehead and the lores were red; the tail was
shorter, the band that runs from above the eyes down the sides of the neck
which is violet-blue in adults was pale blue in the immatures; the iris was
greenish-grey.
In the coming years the colouring process of the plumage will be
studied and compared with related species, also bred in our aviaries. Fur-
thermore, the colour variation of the iris from hatching to sexual maturity
seems to be helpful in determining the age of imported birds, especially
the Amazon parrots (see Lantermann, 1982, 1983b).
We would like to integrate the young birds into a larger group of Green-
cheeked Amazons to obtain more detailed information on the social beha-
viour of this species. In co-operation with German zoos and birdparks, we
hope to be able to repeat this success with other, newly-formed pairs, to
see this species, which is apparently becoming endangered in the wild
(Ridgely, 1980) become established in captivity (Lantermann, 1984b).

spent months in shipment with waxbills and munias. It must have reached
Venezuela from Argentina via Holland. A year later it finally recovered its
health and plumage and was identifiable as a male Band-tailed Seedeater
which ranges from Ecuador down the western Andes to Chile and over
into western Argentina.

phila by its chestnut under-tail coverts, which are diagnostic of the Cata-
menia finches. I have not seen the female but according to de Schauensee,
she is reddish brown broadly streaked with black above, fulvous below,
streaked with dark brown. Both sexes have a white band across the under
surface of the tail.
My diary notes this: it takes small seeds but clearly prefers millet over
all. It is not at all adventurous with food and rarely does more than taste
fruits or greenstuff. The male sings sweetly, a continuous gurgling squeaky
burble that goes on and one. It is not in the least aggressive, in fact, rather
timid. On one occasion when I had a great shortage of space, I put a tiny
ground dove in its cage. It quickly retired to a corner and cheeped plain-
tively, apparently in fear, as if calling for help. It was very happy when in a
cage all by itself. It appears never to bathe.

Another species of Catamenia I saw, but never caught was the Plain-
coloured. There is an excellent plate of it in Phelps and de Schauensee and
it appears to be very similar indeed to the Band-tailed. The female appar-
ently is like the female Band-tailed but without any streaking on the under-
parts. I saw this bird high up in the Andes above the tree line in the Para-
mos. It kept very much to cover when we were in evidence but when out
of danger, it would sit on an exposed stem and watch us.

I must admit to having difficulty with this genus. In my book I dis-
cussed the inadequacy of mentions in the literature, and the difficulty
anybody would have in identifying a bird accurately. I sketched the head
and upper wing of eleven species, adult males, with the intention of provi-
ding a diagnostic reference. I made this chart at the Bird Room of the
Natural History Museum in Tring, and used colour in the original. The
printer, however, having promised a dozen colour plates when the book
was commissioned, cut me down to one, and the serins took priority over
the Warbling Finches.
Imagine my chagrin when, a few years later, in Venezuela, I obtained
a "pair" of unidentified birds from an importation from Holland, and
found my black and white sketches inadequate. They were eventually
identified as the Pretty Warbling Finch, an adult male of which I had kept
some years earlier. Again, very recently in Tokyo I obtained an adult male
of this species and was able to compare it to the colour sketches of my
pair in Venezuela which consisted of an immature male and a female.
My notes in Venezuela show that the outer tail feathers of the male

were all white while those of the female were dark brown at the base. The
male I have now follows. A single adult male in the Field Museum in Chi-
cago had much broader cream wing bars than either of my males (which
have white bars). In the female there is white on the lesser wing coverts.
They are easy birds to keep as they are quiet and in ordinately peace-
ful, being excellent company for waxbills. However, from a dietary view-
point they would be much better kept with tanagers. They love ripe green
food, and all live food, and will take soft food.

<bodyText confidence="0.988131066666667" page_id="56320132"  page_num="200" year="" vol="">
Formerly listed as Spodiomis rusticus by de Schauensee, this is a rare
and difficult bird to find, but it does have a wide range and could find its
way on to the market. The bird I caught and examined was about 5 in
long and was a uniform slaty grey all over. The bill was coral and the legs
orange - not in accordance with de Schauensee, but as I also caught the
Plumbeous Sierra Finch for comparison, albeit in a different location, I
came to this conclusion. As the plumage was faintly striated, I thought it
must be an immature.
I did not keep this bird at the time, regrettably, for I can offer no
comment on it in confinement. However, in the wild it appears to be a
very secretive bird, keeping well hidden or hopping about the ground
among the frailejons (we were in the paramos, above the tree line), and it
seemed to be extremely shy. It could be that such behaviour is a function
of living in such a habitat, and in a suitable aviary the bird would show
more of itself. I doubt it.

Those interested in South and Central American birds will no doubt
have a copy of The Guide to the Birds of Venezuela (de Schauensee and
Phelps) with its excellent illustrations by Guy Tudor and others. There is a
fine plate by Wayne Trimm showing the brush-finches of Venezuela. Finch
and tanager enthusiasts must be intrigued by this little-known genus.
Before arriving in Venezuela I had not even heard of brush finches, let
alone knew what they were. Soon after arriving in Caracas, however, I was
invited to the home of some keen ornithologists who lived further up the
hills (about 5,000 ft, Caracas being about 3,000 ft). While sitting on the
porch watching the birds come to feed and drink, I was electrified by the
appearance of a tanager-sized bird, all orange on head and breast, yellow
belly, and olive green above. It gulped at the papaya/ and banana for a few
mintues, then disappeared. It was my first sight of the Ochre-breasted
Bmsh Finch and I became quite obsessed with the genus from then on.
These are invariably birds of dense underbrush of rainforest hillside.

Occasionally a local bird has become accustomed to the feeding station of
somebody's garden, and will come to feed in open view generally; however
they are skulking, retiring and very shy of humans. It is extremely difficult
to observe them in the wild, and the only times I have ever done so have
been when I have been sitting still for a long period just waiting for some-
thing to come along. The sign is the kicking or tossing of leaves as a soli-
tary bird comes foraging over the ground through the undergrowth. They
are said to feed on small invertebrates but mine ate a great deal of every-
thing - including a lot of seed.

I caught and banded many dozens of these birds in the Cordillera north
of Caracas and thus enabled much more accurate observations of territory
and behaviour. De Schauensee lists four races, one of which has a white
chin, but I only ever saw the northern (coastal area) race. The sexes are
alike but I found the male to be easy to detect in the field by his habit of
erecting the crown feathers frequently (there is no crest), and in the hand
by anal tuft comparison - the male has long yellow "guide" feathers. With
matched pairs the male is also almost 10% larger ( 6 V 2 in). Juveniles are
much duller olive with olive heads and yellowish bib and mesial. The
orange of the head comes through very soon.
I kept several individuals for painting, both young and adult. They
settled easily in large roomy cages and fed happily on mixed seeds, a little
banana, apple and orange. They liked mealworms but I gave only a few
each day. They stayed in excellent condition. They never showed any
sign of aggression, nor did I ever hear them make a noise. I noticed that in
the wild, young birds accompany their parents on foraging parties and I
never noticed any sign of aggression then. This is the only brush finch that
I have seen in groups, however small, and the only one that would forage
above ground level, being occasionally seen in bushes and shrubs 10 ft
above ground level. It would be an undeniably fine aviary bird.

About 7 in also, a big finch with the head striped grey and black, white
throat, black pectoral band, olive above and dingy below. The sexes are
alike. I have never been able to observe this bird in the wild, but one day a
friend called at the office to say that a Stripe-crowned Brush-Finch had
flown into his bedroom window pane, stunned itself, and he feared serious
injury. I duly collected the bird and took it home. I kept it for a few
months in a large cage with other local birds, finches and tanagers, before
painting and releasing it.
It settled very well and was always peaceful with no sign of aggressive-
ness. I found that it ate almost nothing but seeds. Subsequently I learned
that the sexes are alike, while immature birds are virtually uniform sage
green all over.
Skutch devotes a whole chapter of observations on this species. He des-
cribes the song as thin, high-pitched and squeaky, and very short being
easy to overlook. He was also of the opinion that it fed on small insects
and dead leaves. Insects they undoubtedly take, but I am equally certain
that small seeds are a basic diet ingredient.

When Herbert Murray read my notes on this species, he wrote to me
saying that they were very dull in their behaviour, ".the dullest birds I
ever had or have ever seen. They seemed to eat a bit of everything." Ap-
parently his pair led totally uneventful lives and ".....died after a couple of
years, unlamented." Herbert Murray was a great aviculturist and we were
good friends. I sent him birds from Spain, including the Spanish Sparrow,
which he successfully bred. His experience with tanagers was equal, or
greater than that of Mr. N. Oregaard-Olesen, and during my time in Vene-
zuela we exchanged a lot of correspondence on tanagers. If Herbert found
Greyish Saltators dull, I believe him.
I caught an adult in my Caracas garden and caged it with some other
thrush-sized birds, including tanagers. It settled immediately, and very
well. It took a lot of fruit but, as I did not keep it alone, I cannot say for
sure how much softfood or seeds it took. At the bird table in the gardens
they took a lot of banana and orange. I have watched them in many loca-
tions in the wild but have only seen them take leaves, biting bits out, and
buds.
They are shy and somewhat skulking birds, keeping to cover. The song

of the male is the most distinctive and easy to recognise in the clamour of
a dawn chorus, and the male will sing from on high on and off throughout
the day. Its determination and clarity, however, far outweigh its musical
ability. I would put it slightly behind the European Missel Thrush in this
respect. Incidentally, male and female will "duet", singing antiphonally.

STREAKED SALTATOR Saltator alhicollis

<bodyText confidence="0.9989505" page_id="56320135"  page_num="203" year="" vol="">
During my three years in Venezuela I managed a complex 13-month
study of the natural history of a large ranch in the interior. Among the
many hundreds of birds caught were many Streaked Saltators, and I became
very familiar with the species. I decided to keep an adult male for a while.
First I must point out that the Venezuelan race is a richer-coloured bird
than those in Central America or the Caribbean Islands. Its plumage is a
rich glistening, olivaceous green above, not the "dull olive green" as des-
cribed in my book. Also, the eyebrow is yellow, not white as illustrated by
ffrench. Finally, the cutting edges of the bill are rich yellow as is the gape.
My bird was placed in a large cage with a Kiskadee. This was a mistake
as the Kiskadee bullied the Saltator and kept it away from the food. I took
the Saltator away in a very thin and half-starved condition. It refused to
eat and I had to force-feed it with mealworms for a day or two. I also
dropped Vionate in its bill, and mixed glucose in the water. It recovered to
settle down on a mixed diet of fruit, softfood and mealworms.
To begin with, I offered different dishes with various seeds, banana,
papaya, apple, pear and orange. The softfood was a locally-manufactured
dry mix that I combined with honey and grated cheese. At first the Salta-

tor ate only orange, and this fruit remained its outright preferred food
until its eventual release. At the end it was eating orange, mealworms (10
a day), softfood and a little millet. From my observations of the bird in
the wild, it seems to eat buds and leaves, but mainly buds.
ORINOCO SALTATOR Salta tor orenocensis
I have not kept this bird but I observed it several times in Venezuela. It
was found in the upper reaches of large, open trees in open areas between
dense woods. I never saw it low down nor in thick cover. A pair would
carefully comb the branches, bark and leaves, picking at unidentifiable
things, presumably insects of different kinds, small beetles, etc., and also
taking birds and tender bits of vegetation.
I came across a dead one on the highway, still in good enough condition
to paint. It has a strong bill like all saltators, and presumably is fairly om-
nivorous. It is essentially grey above, darkest on the crown. There is a
strong white superciliary, and a white spot at the base of the bill. The
throat is also white but the rest of the head is black. The sexes are alike.

My description of this bird was taken from a comparison of skins in
the British Museum. When I finally collected it live in Venezuela, I found
it to be a little different from my expectation. In many ways it is inter-
mediate between the Virginian Cardinal and the Pyrrhuloxia spp. .Also, in
the birds that I saw, the male has no black on the face at all. My pair were
both longer and slimmer than the Virginian Cardinals I saw in Chicago.
The crest of this species is longer than either of the other two.

Herbert Murray told me that he had kept it for a number of years and
in his opinion it was the finest cardinal of them all. He found the beak to
be amazing and commented on the bulging muscles connected to it. Like
me, Mr. Murray found the female to be a very attractive bird in its own
right. His birds came from Colombia, according to his shipper and "...they
came from semi-desert country". The bird in Venezuela is also found in
semi-desert.
I have watched this species in aviaries in the Caracas Zoo and these
observations agree with my own experience, and that of Herbert Murray,
that it is a peaceful bird and safe in mixed company. Mine took mango,
orange, apple, pear and papaya freely, but only took a little banana. They
also took softfood and mixed seeds. They really had a fondness for sun-
flower and my notes suggest that this seed accounted for about 50% by
bulk of the food eaten.

I bought a male of the Argentinian race from a pet shop in Caracas.
It was badly plucked and almost completely bald. After two months
with not a pinhead showing, I was resigned to having a vulturine grosbeak
in my collection for ever. However, it did eventually begin sprouting when
it began a full moult, and became a fine feathered and beautiful bird. It
would eat about a handful of sunflower seed a day, would take some fresh
millet on the stem, very little fruit, but no mealworms or softfood despite
the good example set by tanagers in the same cage. It was quite peaceful
I caught an immature male of the smaller Venezuelan race. At first, I took
this bird for a female but it cut its forehead and quickly grew blue feathers.
It too was peaceful in the same cage as the older bird.

I subsequently placed this younger male in a cage with a male American
Blue Grosbeak (imported from Mexico). Despite the larger size and senio-
rity of the Mexican bird, the Venezuelan bird pursued It mercilessly and I
had to withdraw it. I then placed It with various other, non-related finches
and it behaved perfectly.
This bird was a great character. It bathed with enthusiasm and took
every food I offered from sunflower to all the other seeds, fruits, lettuce,
chickweed, seeding grasses, etc.

I came across several males in a shipment from Mexico, and bought one
to make comparative colour records against the other blue grosbeaks. In a
3 ft (91.5 cm) cube wire cage with a few other seedeaters, It did well;
however, when placed in a cage with a smaller, immature male Venezuelan
Blue-black Grosbeak, it was pursued relentlessly and they had to be separa-
ted.
It is a large bird with a large bill but the shape of the bill is more like
that of a large sparrow than that typical of the grosbeaks (like the Haw-
finch). It took a variety of seeds with a preference for sunflower, but not
to the overweaning degree of all the other grosbeaks mentioned here.

This bird is known throughout South America as Rey del Bosque (King
of the Woods). We occasionally had a pair resident in the hills above Cara-
cas and could always bring it to within a couple of trees by playing record-
ings of its song which, incidentally, is strong and attractive. However, it
appears to be totally a bird of the tree tops and we could never bring It
down to our level. 1 once saw an old male with one leg in a pet shop In
Caracas and took it home at once. It developed a big callous under Its leg
as it had great difficulty in perching. It would eat nothing but sunflower
seed. However, it remained fit and sang sweetly and often. During a five-
week trip to England I left it in the care of a friend who claimed it sang
well, but then had to leave it with another person who obviously was very
incompetent. Upon my return, I found it had gone light, also had chronic
conjunctivitis, and died within two days.
Later I found another bird - also imported from Argentina, I under-
stood - but although this bird had both legs it was in wretched condition
with bad diarrhoea, eyes dull, and very worn, broken plumage. Like many
finches - especially Emberiza buntings and Ploceidae weavers - with Intes-
tinal problems, it took mealworms avidly. These I dosed with Vionate.
The bird soon recovered, taking mixed seeds with a distinct preference for
sunflower, also a little softfood, and apple, pear and lettuce.

Both of these individuals would bite me readily, and very painfully.
They seemed to be not at all aggressive to other birds, but the conditions
were not at all a fair test of their tempers.

On one January trip, deep into the interior of Venezuela, we saw great
flocks of Dickcissel, North American birds over-wintering in South
America. The following year, at the same time, I was better prepared and
set several mist nets on one part of the ranch where the birds had been
seen that week. At the end of a long and fruitful day, with dozens of
species photographed and a few hundred banded, we began rolling up the
nets. At the very last net, to my surprise and delight, were about 20 Dick-
cissels. I kept two very well marked individuals but not for long as their
cage was opened by accident. These birds were, of course, in winter plu-
mage with huffish edging to much of their feathering. I was struck by the
considerable variation from individual to individual, and also by their size
as they seemed to be as large as big sparrows.
In the short time I kept them they were noisy and aggressive birds
that ate a normal seed mixture. In behaviour I would liken them to the
Common Starling, including the chattering.
PASSERINA BUNTINGS Passerina spp.
There is a strong school of thought that maintains that all six species
of Passerina are, in fact, but races of one species. Conspecific or not, the
fact that they occupy significantly different geographic and climatic
ranges and, in my experience, have different personalities, justifies treat-
ing them distinctly in aviculture. Nonetheless, every effort should be made
to make comparative records. All aviculturists, especially those keeping
adult pairs in breeding condition, pairs of more than one species, would
serve their hobby well if they kept comparative observations.
Breedings of the Lazuli Bunting are extremely rare so it is worth
noting a report in Cage and Aviary Birds (29th November, 1973) by
G.M. Harrison-Wells. One bird fledged from the second brood - other
nestlings were found dead on the aviary floor. The parents took various
seeds, duckweed, and were very keep on mealworms. The breeding oc-
curred in a mixed aviary and there was no recorded aggression.
I collected a few Indigo Buntings in Chicago, both sexes, in the spring
and autumn. I did not keep them for long as they invariably bickered and
disturbed their companions. Herbert Murray kept the Varied Bunting
over many years. There were several abortive breeding attempts, and his
best effort was when nestlings reached the age of 10 days before deser-
tion. With the experience I have now (here in Japan almost everything is

hand-reared from Zebra Finch and Java Sparrow upwards) I think I would
have attempted to hand-rear. However, looking back on it, doubtless I
would have left my birds the way Herbert did. His flights were very large
and well planted. Nonetheless, he attributed his failure to the birds being
highly insectivorous when rearing.
I have recorded two reports concerning the Nonpareil Bunting in
Cage and Aviary Birds (August 1980). One is from M.G. Montague, who
gave a well-detailed near miss (2.8.1980). Then there was a letter to the
Editor from C.S. Reski (30.8.1980) reporting a successful breeding in an
outdoor planted flight in Cornwall. Apparently the birds had plenty of
livefood, including crickets and grasshoppers.
Finally, I have the following note recorded in the margin of my copy
against the Rainbow Bunting: bred in England in 1975 by Mr. and Mrs.
Aberdeen. I am sorry that I did not record the source of this information
as it no doubt refers to the first breeding of the species in England.

The White-cheeked is one of the most widely-kept touracos, so prob-
ably needs no description. The plumage is described and illustrated by
Mackworth-Praed and Grant (1952). It is an Ethiopian bird, T.l. leucotis
being the western race. The eastern race is Donaldson-Smith's Touraco
T.l donaldsoni, which has the crest red, not black. This race is much more
rarely kept. T. ruspolii, Prince Ruspoli's Touraco, is a closely-related, pos-
sibly conspecific form with a very restricted distribution in southern
Ethiopia. The other species completing this sub-group within the genus is
Hartlaub's Touraco, T. hartlauhi, from Kenya and Tanzania. All are birds
of highland forest.
The White-cheeked Touraco was regularly imported in the 1960s and
early 1970s, but rarely since then. It is the most commonly-bred touraco,
young having been reared in at least 13 collections in the U.K. in the last
ten years, although the only detailed account of the breeding of this
species to have been published in the AviculturalMagazine until now came
from America (Everitt, 1965). The first British breeding record in the
Avicultural Magazine appeared in 'News and Views' in 1964, saying
simply: 'Interesting breedings: W.H. Rose, White-cheeked Touraco, one
and two reared'. According to the Members' List at that time, Mr. Rose
was living in Market Harborough, Leicestershire. There was a report of
London Zoo having bred them in 1971 (Olney, 1972), although the first
breeding there was actually in 1969 (Zool. Soc. London, 1969). Surpris-
ingly I can find no earlier published breeding records for the U.K. Second
generation White-cheeked Touracos were reared at Padstow Bird Gardens
in 1980 ('News and Views', 1980).
Summary of breeding results
My first two birds were obtained early in 1976. These proved to be two
hens, producing two eggs each in 1977. In 1978 a male was obtained and
paired with one of the hens (Pair 1); 10 eggs were laid, four hatched and
three young were reared. One young cock was retained and paired with the
other hen (Pair 2).
In 1979 Pair 1 produced three eggs but the hen was killed by the cock
during incubation. One egg was fostered to Pair 2, also incubating at the

time. Pair 2 produced 16 eggs, none of which hatched, but reared one
young bird from the Pair 1 egg.
In 1980 a new hen was obtained for the cock of Pair 1. Six eggs were
laid but none hatched. Pair 2 produced 19 eggs but again none hatched.
In 1981 Pair 1 produced eight eggs, of which three hatched and two
young were reared. Pair 2 produced 15 eggs, of which four were hatched in
an incubator and two young were reared, one by the parents and one by
hand.
In the winter of 1981-82 the cock of Pair 1 suffered badly frostbitten
feet, so a new cock was obtained and paired to this hen. Seven eggs were
laid, of which five hatched and four young were reared (two by hand). Pair
2 laid 10 eggs in 1982, all of which hatched and eight young were reared
(five by hand). All the 1982 hatched eggs of both pairs were incubator-
hatched.
In 1983 the cock of Pair 1 attacked the hen, so was replaced by the
original cock. Despite his badly injured feet, of the six eggs laid two were
fertile and two young were reared. These were hand-reared from two
weeks as the parents were fighting. Pair 2 laid six eggs, of which three were
incubator-hatched but the young not reared successfully. The cock bird
was then replaced by the one removed from the Pair 1 hen earlier in the
season. Two more eggs were laid and one young bird reared by the parents
but was later killed by White-browed Laughing Thrushes Garrulax sannio.
Therefore, in the years 1978-83, a total of 22 young have been reared.

Both aviaries have shelters approximately 6 x 3 x 6 ft high (1.83 x
0.92 x 1.83 m) in wooden sheds and have about a quarter of the roof and
sides covered with plastic sheeting. Both flights are planted with shrubs
and climbing plants. Some artificial lighting is provided in the shelters
during the winter, but no heating until late 1981, since when a minimum
temperature of about 40*F has been maintained. The birds are usually
shut in at night during the winter, also during the day in severe weather.
Feeding
Food consists mainly of fruit. Bananas, apples and soaked sultanas
form the staple diet, but other fruits including pears, grapes, peaches, tom-
atoes, plums, cherries, oranges, guavas (tinned), elderberries, blackberries
and strawberries, are given as often as possible. Other foods such as boiled

rice, potato, carrot, peas, sweetcorn, minced beef, boiled egg and chopped
lettuce have occasionally been mixed with the fruit, but usually prove un-
popular. Most of the fruit is fed chopped and mixed with a universal food
or equivalent, currently Haith's Prosecto, and also a multivitamin powder
such as SA37. The softbill food is also provided separately but rarely taken.
Whole, peeled apples and pears are sometimes fed, fixed on nails. Powdered
cuttlefish 'bone' is sprinkled on to the fruit when hens are known to be
laying. At this time hens can often be seen searching the aviary floor and
will sometimes take grit and small pieces of cuttlefish.
Maggot pupae are taken when young are being fed, and at other times
by some birds. One hen often eats Russian Vine Polygonum baldschuanicum
leaves when feeding young. The birds are usually fed once daily, but at
least twice when feeding young or in hot weather.
Breeding
Nest-sites used have included fruit and fish boxes and a wire basket.
Most nests have been in an apple, or similar box, hung on its side with a
board about Sin (7.5 cm) wide fixed across the bottom of the open front,
and another board underneath to strengthen the base and fill any gaps if
necessary. A good base of hay is provided and the birds add a few twigs.
They have not successfully built nests in these boxes without the hay.
Clutches are of two or three eggs, more often two, laid on alternate
days. Incubation usually begins with the laying of the second egg irres-
pective of clutch size and is shared by both sexes, taking 21-23 days. The
young hatch with eyes open and covered in thick black down except for a
line along the crown, which remains naked until the crest grows. The
lores are also naked. The bill is black at the tip, pale at the base. The
chicks are fed by regurgitation and rarely left alone in the nest, one or
sometimes both parents sitting beside them when not actually brooding.
Young leave the nest at 20-27 (most often 21-24) days old. At this
stage they are very much smaller than the parents with short wings and
tails and the bill mainly black. I have sometimes had to replace young in
the nest but they usually find their own way back, although they cannot
fly. One flight has a Russian Vine growing near the nest which makes
this very easy, and I have seen young running up the wire flapping their
wings at 22-23 days to reach a perch near the nest. They continue to use
the nest as a roost for some time. It has always proved necessary to
remove the young if eggs are hatched from a subsequent clutch, other-
wise the period for which they are tolerated is very variable.
The transition from down to juvenile plumage is difficult to determine
due to the dark colouring and downy texture of the first plumage on the
underparts. The young birds can show a little red on the wings at only

three weeks old. By two months the white facial markings are visible and
the beak and eye-wattles are starting to turn orange. Growth continues
rapidly after fledging, but full size and colour is not attained until about
six months old.
One of the main obstacles to successful breeding is aggression within
pairs, experienced by most breeders, including Berry and Todd (1982),
Delacour (1973), Steel (1973).. With my birds the males have always been
dominant, although other breeders have encountered aggressive hens. The
original cock of Pair 1 killed his first mate while they were incubating eggs,
after breeding peacefully with her the previous season in the same aviary,
and almost killed his second mate while they were feeding young. In both
cases the attacks took place during electric storms, although all three cocks
have also attacked hens under other circumstances. I have quite frequently
had to split pairs for periods from hours to months, and at all times of
the year.
Artificial incubation and hand-rearing
I first tried artificial incubation in 1981 as at that stage my breeding
results had steadily worsened since the initial success. This was largely due
to the cock of Pair 2 refusing to incubate. The hen would initially incubate
alone but consistently deserted before the eggs hatched. If the eggs were
removed as soon as the clutch was complete and incubated artificially, the
hen was usually sitting on another clutch when they hatched and would
accept the young if this second clutch was removed. Even the cock would
feed and brood young supplied in this way although for only 10-14 days,
after which he would turn on the hen, who would rear the young perfectly
well on her own if the cock was then removed. Of course, this then left
the second clutch to be hand-reared. This technique has also been used
with the other pair when necessary.
Since 1982 eggs have been incubated and hatched in a Reliable Thermo-
stat 'Vision' still-air incubator, set at 99.5-100*F with the egg-tray in-
verted to bring the eggs closer to the thermometer. The eggs are turned
twice daily until pipping. The water tray is kept only just wet until
pipping, when more water is added. No humidity readings have been taken
but high humidity during incubation can be harmful, as I discovered in
1981 with a clutch set in a friend's incubator, of which two died after
pipping and one within a day of hatching.
These eggs are, however, otherwise very tolerant of less-than-perfect
incubation. The first egg hatched artificially was one of two which spent
the first week in a Reliable Thermostat hospital cage, which ran steadily
at 98-100*F. The eggs were well insulated from the heat source and a
small dish of water was kept in the cage. The eggs were then put into a

friend's 'Curfew' incubator with some chicken eggs, where one hatched
(fortunately before the chickens) and was reared by the parents. Several
eggs have hatched after being deserted in mid-incubation, probably for
several hours in some cases. Since obtaining the 'Vision' Incubator only
one fertile egg has failed to hatch and this was probably due to poor
incubation by the parents before its removal from the nest.
On hatching the birds are brooded in an incubator if possible for at
least the first few days (the 'Curfew' incubator makes a particularly
convenient brooder) and are then transferred if necessary to a box with
a lamp. The temperature is reduced to 95*F in the first day, then gradually
reduced further.
The first feed is usually given 6-12 hours after hatching, although the
young will beg after only an hour. Feeds are usually given every 1-1 Vi hours
for the first day, then every two hours, and are gradually reduced to every
three hours as the young grow. Intervals between night feeds are two of
three hours on the first night, then two of four hours for the next few
nights, followed by one of six hours and eventually seven to eight hours.
A variety of rearing foods has been used, including various mixtures of
Corn plan. Farex, Horlicks, baby foods including Heinz Fruit Dessert and
Bone &amp; Beef Broth, and Milupa fruit flavours, mixed with fresh banana
and vitamins including Cytacon and Abidec or 8A37, and plain yoghurt
for the first few days. This mixture, made with warm water, is syringe-fed
for the first two weeks, when the diet is gradually changed to small
pieces of fruit, mainly banana, and soaked Purina dog meal which is taken
from the fingers. This change in feeding techniques seems to make weaning
easier and the birds can usually be weaned at four to five weeks.
Several young have died or been culled during hand-rearing, the most
frequent cause being badly splayed legs. This problem often seems to be
linked to the substrate on which the young are kept. They are best kept in
small containers giving some lateral support (e.g. small rectangular marga-
tine tubs), on a relatively rough material (some paper towels are too
smooth). I have only experienced this problem once with parent-reared
young, when the parents had removed almost all the nesting material from
the box.
This condition was cured in one hand-reared bird by strapping the leg
to the body for a few days with masking tape, but this treatment failed in
two other cases, and seems more likely to be effective if the condition is
noticed in the early stages. In my experience, only one leg is affected
initially. The same problem has occurred in several other collections in at
least leucotis , hartlaubi and persa, often in parent-reared nestlings and for
no apparent reason, sometimes affecting only one bird in a clutch of two.
One bird with only very slightly splayed legs, not noticed at first, was
reared without developing this condition and one clutch of three young

had perfect legs but bent toes, probably due to a break in incubation to-
wards the end of the incubation period. Otherwise the hand-reared birds
appeared perfectly healthy and only one bird, reared alone and kept alone
for some months afterwards, showed abnormal behaviour with other
touracos. As far as possible the young were reared in groups and put
within sight and sound of adult touracos as early as possible.
Conclusion
Touracos in general are often keen to breed in captivity but regular
successful breeding is much less common. Young have been reared from
only a fifth of the eggs laid by my birds, despite high fertility. Much sim-
pler hand-rearing diets have been used successfully (Berry and Todd, 1982)
and I will experiment further if the opportunity arises. I apologise for the
imprecision, and in some areas, total lack of my records, and I hope that
other breeders will continue to publish data.
Although at least nine species of touraco, of three genera, have bred in
Britain in recent years, and at least 14 are currently present in British
aviaries, only two, apart from T. leucotis, can now be said to be breeding
regularly. These are Schalow's T. schalowi, and the Red- or Pink-crested
T. erythrolophus , and these only in one and two collections respectively.
A large number of Hartlaub's Touracos have been imported in recent
years and hopefully these will soon start to breed regularly, as well as
several more rarely-imported species which have recently been available in
small numbers. It is important that our captive touraco populations do not
become too inbred, particularly in view of the ever-increasing difficulties
in obtaining wild-caught stock. Birds bred in my aviaries have now pro-
duced young in at least three other collections. In two cases these were
birds paired to completely unrelated stock from other sources; the birds of
the third pair were both bred here but were not closely related.

The Brown-headed Parrot is also known as the Brown-hooded and Con-
cealed Yellow Parrot. It is usually seen in pairs or small flocks of four to
twelve birds, but up to 40 have been recorded. They are rather wary and
therefore keep themselves concealed in thick foliage of the upper
branches of trees. Conversational chatter is kept up continuously while
feeding. If disturbed, their flight is very fast and direct while they utter
very loud, harsh, ear-splitting shrieks and display bright yellow on the
under wing-coverts. They have been observed coming to drink at midday.
The sexes are alike and measure between 22-24cm in length. The
general plumage colour is green; head and neck dusky brown with a
yellowish wash; sides of head, throat and upper breast light buffy olive;
mantle and back yellowish green, the feathers laced with deep green; wing-

coverts and secondaries olive-green; under wing-coverts bright yellow:
primary-coverts and primaries brownish green, tinged on outer webs with
blue; under tail-coverts and rump bright olive-green; tail olive-brown,
tipped with green; iris pale greenish yellow; bill, upper mandible dark grey
becoming blackish towards tip, lower mandible whitish; legs and feet
greyish black. There is an excellent colour plate of the Brown-headed
Parrot painted by D.M. Henry, opposite the first page of the Avicul-
tural Magazine in 1955.
P.c. tanganyikae differs from the nominate race in having the head
more olive-brown; rump, upper tail-coverts and underparts brighter and
more yellowish. Immatures paler than the adults, the upper breast suffused
with dull yellow.
The nominate race occurs in eastern Zululand, eastern Swaziland,
Transvaal (lowveld), south-eastern Zimbabwe and Mozambique (south of
the Save River). P.c. tanganyikae occurs in Mozambique (north of the Save
River), southern Malawi, eastern Tanzania and coastal Kenya, including
the off-shore islands of Zanzibar and Pemba. This parrot is locally com-
mon throughout the lowlands, especially in the coastal districts where it
frequents coconut and cashew nut plantations and mangroves. It is also
quite common in dry Acacia woodland and the edges of undeveloped

cultivation. It feeds on a large variety of seeds, grain, fruits, nuts, berries
and nectar. These parrots have been recorded feeding on the nectar from
the dark maroon flowers of the Sausage Tree Kigelia africana , the fruit of
wild figs, Ficus spp., fleshy yellow-brown fruit of the Nyala Tree Pseudo-
cadia zambesica , globose fruit of cultivated Cassava Manihot esculenta ,
inflorescences of Coconut Palms, seeds of Baobab Adansonia digitata ,
unripe seeds of Kaffirboom Erythrina sp., extracting the seeds from
the pods of Knob-thorn Acacia nigrescens, Umbrella-thorn A. tortilis and
Smooth-bark flat-crown Albizzia gumnifera, and probing the blooms of
Flat-flowered Aloe Aloe marlothii and orange-yellow petals of the Kiaat
Tree Pterocarpus angolensis. They have also been seen eating the young
green shoots of trees. They are partial to ripening grain and will raid
villagers' millet, maize and sorghum crops, devouring some but wasting far
more.
In captivity the birds wid accept a basic diet of two parts sunflower
seed, plus one part each of white millet and canary seed. This may be sup-
plemented with apple, grape, spinach and raw peanuts. They are also fond
of the shoots of Bluegum and Silver Oak. As a rearing food a basic nectar
mixture of caramel and brown sugar mixed with warm water is quite ade-
quate as well as soaked sunflower seeds, Cheddar cheese, bread and milk
and corn-on-the-cob (maize).
Recorded breeding is in June (Tanzania), May and June (Malawi), June,
July and September (Mozambique), April and October (Zimbabwe) and
May, June to July in South Africa. From aviary observations of the court-
ship display the male struts back and forward along the perch with beak
held high, and uttering a series of single note twitterings followed by a
loud scream. This performance is repeated for several minutes. Six nests in
the wild revealed that all were in holes in trees, living or dead, with one
being an old woodpecker hole, and with entrances of 5-10m from the
ground. The nest cavity of one was 12 cm in diameter and 50 cm deep,
while the other measured 90 cm deep. The eggs lay on bare wood. The
Baobab is a known favourite of this species for breeding. The 2-3 eggs are
white, glossy and measure about 31 x 23mm. Low (1980) reports a suc-
cessful breeding of cryptoxanthus in captivity. One egg was laid in a nest-
box which measured 25 cm (10 in) square and 45 cm (18 in) deep with
the bottom lined with inverted turf and peat; after 26 days it was assumed
that the egg had hatched as a near-naked chick was observed a few days
later; the young bird left the nest 12 weeks after hatching. The Brown-
headed Parrot is known to hybridise extensively with Meyer's Parrot P.
meyeri on the Motali River in the north-eastern Transvaal province of
South Africa to the Sabi River in Zimbabwe. Museum specimens show the

By Mrs. J.L. SPENKELINK - VAN SCHAIK
(Soesterberg, Netherlands)
The Little Button Quail is about the same size as Chinese Painted Quail
-the cock is slightly smaller, the female somewhat larger.
It is a patchy, coffee-coloured bird, its back being bright brown with
lighter patches; the patches on the wings are larger than those on the
shoulder and on the back. This pattern is formed by the juxtaposition of
feathers with darker margins next to feathers with small, brighter patches,
which start from the head. On the wing-coverts the margin turns into a
dark brown band across the feather, while the patches become larger,
covering up to half the feather. This pattern goes on across the breast.
The female has dark brown feathers on the throat - in the male these
feathers are lighter brown. The feathers on the abdomen are longer and
red-brown in colour; the tail is short, the legs are flesh-coloured and the
bill yellowish.
Several subspecies of this quail occur on the different continents, in
Asia, Australia and Africa, and there is a subspecies in Europe, T.s. sylva-
tica, formerly found in Spain and Portugal, but now very rare and even
feared extinct in most parts of the range.
In the tropics these quail are used for fighting in much the same way as
in cock fighting. At night, when the oil candles burn in the cabins and it is
quiet in the surrounding bushes, these small birds are attracted up to the
burning lights and are then caught. The females are used for fighting which
is on a smaller scale than with game cock fighting, and often takes place
indoors because the birds are smaller. One can buy these quail very cheap-
ly in the oriental bird markets.
As a child, I kept these charming birds and they became very tame. We
played circuses with them making them jump over our finger or through a
bamboo ring. When they could be bought in the Netherlands some years
ago, I resolved to buy some; the importer found it very strange that I
bought three males to one female.
I put one male and one female in an outside aviary, in which I kept
Neophema parrakeets. The bottom of the aviary consisted mainly of pure
sand. As our daytime and night time temperatures differ considerably, I
decided to enclose the aviary with sheets of glass so that the temperature
inside would remain constant, especially when there was sunshine during

the day. To make their surroundings as natural as possible, I put several
big stones and grass clumps in the aviary.
Soon the male started to display and to call the female towards a
sheltered place he had formed between the stones and the grass clumps.
The female laid five eggs which were brooded by the male, and three
chicks hatched after 28 days' incubation. As in nature, these young lived
on insects though I gave the birds insectile food as well as hard-boiled egg
yolk with crushed biscuit. Only the male cared for the chicks, feeding
them from food which they took out of his bill. In the same way, the male
made them drink by dropping water from its lower mandible into the
chicks' open beaks.
Meanwhile, I had put the female with another male and after about a
month, these had chicks too, but I was unsuccessful with the third male.
As I had no other aviary available, I left the female with the male and
though he too brooded the eggs, when the chicks were about two days
old, the female became aggressive and after a short struggle, the male was
beaten. I put the chicks in a shoe box which was kept to the right tempera-
ture and fed them with a fine paint brush. Their food consisted of egg-
food mixed with flour and made into a pulp with water and this was then
dripped from the paint brush on to the open bill of the chicks. This feed
could take up to an hour as the chicks had to have their bills open at the
right moment to swallow the food. After about three days, it became
easier and every hour they were given about five drops each. From that
moment on, the time between each feed was lengthened until they got
their food every third hour on the seventh day. From then on they ate
germinated millet given by the paint brush. When they were 14 days old,
they were able to feed themselves, so I put them into a larger box. I gave
them cow heart which, whilst still frozen, was scraped with a teaspoon to
give a really fine consistency This clung to the paint brush and was then
fed to the chicks, being mixed with egg after several days, and they grew
up successfully.
It was a pity that most of the chicks I bred proved to be hens because,
owing to their peculiar method of breeding, the best proportion is five
cocks to one hen.
During the winter they stayed on the dry sandy floor, with dry straw
in a corner which they hid in. By accident, one bird was trodden to
death because they all dived into the straw whenever one went near them.
Their protective coloration is very effective and makes them almost in-
visible in the straw.
It is a pity that these very attractive birds are no longer imported, as
my strain will eventually die out from inbreeding as they are all bred
from the same hen.

THE ATTRACTION OF LORIES TO THE MADRONE TREE
By FRED BAUER
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.979063621621622" page_id="56320153"  page_num="221" year="" vol="">
(Garberville, California, USA)
The so-called 'Strawberry Trees' (Ericaceae) are amongst the most orna-
mental of the evergreen trees, and there are over a dozen species in both
the Old and New worlds. The dark, shiny green leaves, white flowers and
strawberry-like fruits are very attractive and various species have been
introduced into many gardens and parks all over the world including
Britain where very old specimens thrive, mainly in the more southerly
parts.
Perhaps the best known member of the family is the Madrone Arbutus
menziesii, a native of the Pacific slopes of North America, and whilst, of
course, there are no lories native to this area, I have discovered that many
if not all lories are strongly attracted to this plant.
In the countryside of the Mattole Valley in California where my aviaries
are located, the Madrone tree is a common and often spectacular feature.
It is said that the largest Madrone in the world lives nearby; this tree
measures over 100 ft (30.5 m)in breadth, its trunk being 16 ft (4.88) thick.
After watching native birds (especially the Bandtail Pigeon) eagerly
consume quantities of Madrone fruit, I introduced these abundant little
globes to my psittacines. The brilliant red berry-like, half-inch spheres were
accepted enthusiastically by some (Caiques, Hawk-headed Parrots, Eclec-
tus and Amazon parrots) and ignored by others (macaws, cockatoos and
most lories).
The following spring (1983) I offered Madrone flowers to the lories. All
species eagerly worked the small white, five-petalled, urn-shaped flowers
(somewhat like Lily of the Valley) with their nifty little tongues and many
of them then crushed and ate all or portions of them. This was quite plea-
sing to me as I had not found my lories show much interest in domestic
flowers.
Madrone flowers are borne in large clusters in great profusion on a stiff
central stem. Since most of them are high off the ground, I use an orchard
pole pruner to reach and cut the clusters. They are gathered in large har-
vest baskets and carried to the aviaries. Strong winds also make them avail-
able from time to time. It is a wonderful resource and I feel that these
flowers are an important addition to my lories' otherwise largely contrived
and unnatural diet. I cannot say that they provide a particular vital ingre-
dient, but they certainly supply a vital element of interest and pleasure.
But there is more to the lory-Madrone story. This winter (1984) I

F. BAUER - LORIES &amp; MADRONE TREE
discovered that some parrots are very fond of the smooth, bark-less skin of
Madrone twigs. These are a smooth, deep red in winter and bright, yellow-
green when growing. Except for new buds, these birds do not eat the
leaves. Most do not chew the wood but quickly peel off the thin skin and
eat it.
I was quite surprised at what happened when fresh Madrone twigs were
placed in the lory flights. Immediately every bird set about licking the
leaf sockets (I had removed the leaves to avoid litter). They then began
to preen themselves vigorously, as does a dog with fleas. I examined the
twigs and the birds with a lens but could find no parasites. This preen-
ing occurs within seconds of contact with the twigs and continues unin-
terrupted, in an urgent manner, until the source of the exciting substance,
whatever it is, is exhausted or every feather is treated. The birds do not
show much interest in dry, dead twigs.
After the leaf sockets are licked clean, the skin of the twig is opened
by biting, though it is not eaten as it is by the other parrots, and the
preening continues. It is very exciting to watch, especially the Stella Lories
Charmosyna papou stellae, who pull the whole of their long tails through
their beaks, requiring a real stretch over their backs to reach the tips. Each
bird also coats its feet with the substance until the skin glistens.
What is going on? What substance is this, and what is the requirement?
I decided to experiment further. I tried other plants, 28 to date. Several
(Douglas Fir, Arizona Cypress, Incense Cedar) generated a similar response
but none so far has stimulated the behaviour described above with nearly
the vigour that the Madrone does. Madrone will excite the lories even
when presented immediately after exposure to one of the other varieties.
The attraction is also strongly present when Madrone twigs are introduced
to hand-fed fledglings, especially Stella Lories. There is an immediate and
instinctive need for this substance.
Those members who are familiar with the terms 'anting' and 'smoke-
anting' will recognise a possible connection with the lory-Madrone pheno-
menon. Anting is a behaviour pattern in which the birds apply living ants
to their bodies, or bathe in smoke from burning twigs or chimneys. I have
not been able to find a convincing explanation for anting.
At this point let me remind members that such experiments could be
dangerous to their birds as some plants might be toxic. I have found, how-
ever, that healthy birds that are regularly supplied with non-toxic plant
matter do not consume that which is harmful to them and in the wild all
birds come in contact with poisonous plants. Nevertheless, perhaps it is
best to experiment on the more plentiful species first.
Whatever the attraction the Madrone has for lories, I consider it is
necessary if for no other reason than the birds' acute desire for it.

Introduction to the species
The Speckled Pigeon Columba guinea has several other vernacular names.
In avicultural circles it is often known as the Triangular-spotted Pigeon and
in South Africa it is usually called the Rock Pigeon. As some writers of
regional avifaunas prefer inventing new English names to using long-estab-
lished ones, it has also been called Hackled Pigeon, Guinea Pigeon and
Red-eyed Pigeon.
It is one of the most widespread of the African Columba species, being
found from northern Africa (south of the Sahara) to the Cape of Good
Hope, although it is not evenly spread over this vast area and is absent
from tropical forest and other areas of unsuitable habitat.
In southern Africa it was until fairly recently mainly or entirely depen-
dent on the presence of sea or inland cliffs inaccessible to or not frequen-
ted by monkeys and other climbing nest predators. Further north, how-
ever, and especially in parts of western tropical Africa where it overlaps
geographically with the Rock Pigeon Columba livia , it was (and Is) associ-
ated with the presence of Borassus palms, nesting in the cavities at the
bases of their large leaves (Harwin, 1963). Over much of its range it has
now taken to nesting and roosting on or in buildings, on sheltered ledges
under bridges and in mine adits. Hollows in trees and old nests of the
Hammerkop and various other situations (see especially Rowan, 1983) are
also used as nest sites (Goodwin, 1983, Rowan).
In captivity and doubtless in the wild also, the roles of the sexes in
parental and nesting behaviour is similar to that of Rock, feral and domes-
tic pigeons. The cock brings the nesting material and the hen builds with
it. The first egg is laid in the evening and the second on the next day but
one after, in the very early afternoon I think, but cannot now remember
with certainty. The incubation and fledging periods are shorter than those
of Rock and domestic pigeons, about 15 and 22 days respectively, in my
rather limited experience.
The Speckled Pigeon feeds on the ground in open country or savanna,
sometimes locally in towns, very often on arable land. When available,
cultivated seeds such as wheat, millet, maize, dari and ground nuts (pea-
nuts) comprise much of its food, which otherwise consists mainly of seeds
of wild plants. It is often shot for sport or food. On balance, however, it
has probably benefitted from modern man's provision of buildings, food

and water supplies. Also from his destruction of tropical rain forest and its
subsequent replacement by savanna conditions or cultivation, this has
permitted it to extend its range in the present century.
In the highlands of Abyssinia and Eritrea the Speckled Pigeon overlaps
widely with another rock-haunting species, the White-collared Pigeon
Columba albitorques. The two are much of a size and seem, at least in
Addis Ababa where both are, or at least recently were, quite common, to
have very similar ecological requirements (Pitwell and Goodwin, 1964). So
far neither is known to be having a harmful effect upon the other there
but it seems likely that they may compete to some extent. Introduced
domestic pigeons have gone feral in many African towns. They would
seem likely to prove a serious competitor to town-nesting Speckled Pig-
eons, perhaps also elsewhere as both species occur together in natural
sites on crags in at least one area of South Africa (Rowan). No competi-
tion between the two has been recorded but this may merely reflect the
tendency of many ornithologists to pay little attention to wild pigeons and
even less to feral pigeons.
Description.
The Speckled Pigeon of the nominate race C.g. guinea , which is found
in tropical western, central and eastern Africa, is about the size of the
average feral pigeon, perhaps a little larger than the latter when it is a bird
of (mainly) dovecote pigeon derivation, but a little smaller than a racing
homer pigeon or feral pigeons derived from this breed. The mantle and
most of the wing coverts are dark reddish purple which may fade to light
chestnut brown in worn and bleached plumage. A white triangular mark at
the tip of each covert feather results in a profuse white spotting over the
closed wing. The neck is encircled with a broad collar of bifurcated feathers
that are chestnut tipped with silvery green or silvery pink. The primaries
and secondaries are dark grey, the tail blackish with a grey central band
and some white on the outer edge of the two outermost tail feathers. The
rest of the plumage is pale silvery grey. In flight the dark shoulders and
tail contrast with the very pale lower back and rump.
A striking feature at close quarters is the large expanse of red or pur-
plish red orbital skin. The eye is yellow with an orange or golden or red
outer ring. The bill is black with a powdery white cere (when the bird is
in good condition) and the legs and feet salmon, flesh pink or pale red.
The race from southern Africa, C guinea phaenota, tends to be slightly
smaller with proportionately slightly smaller bill, less extensive bare
orbital skin and denser, softer body plumage. It is much darker on the grey
parts, and to some extent elsewhere, and has smaller white spots on the
wing. Juveniles of both forms are duller. Skead gives detailed descriptions

of nestlings and juveniles of the South African form.
Personal involvement
I was about 15 when I first saw Speckled Pigeons. Cycling along a road
near Wraysbury, I noticed a number of aviaries in the grounds of a large
house (or small mansion). At once I stopped and scanned the aviaries
through my poor quality 6 x 30 binoculars. I saw Golden, Silver and Am-
herst Pheasants and, much more exciting, a pheasant and two pigeons
completely new tome. Moreover both were very attractive and quite unlike
anything I had seen before. They were, in fact, a cock Swinhoe's Pheasant
and two Speckled Pigeons. I soon identified the former (from some book,
I suppose) but the pigeons remained a mystery until some years later.
Then I visited the place again and actually bought a Barbary Dove from
the lady in the great house. I took the opportunity of asking what the (to
me) mysterious pigeons had been and was told Triangular-spotted Pigeons
from Africa.
In May of 1941, the troopship, on which I and some hundreds of other
young soldiers were en route for the Middle East, stopped for two weeks
in Durban. Here, in a place called Clairewood Camp, we stayed for an
incredibly luxurious break. We were fed on South African army rations
which were not only, understandably, superior in quality to what we had
been used to but incredibly generous in quantity. Quite appropriately, this
food was served out to us by a genial South African army cook beside
whose girth and stature an adult male Mountain Gorilla would have looked
like a marmoset. To me, even better than the delights of gluttony, was our
being granted a great deal of free time.
Unfortunately I had unwisely taken my parents' advice and left my
binoculars at home (a decision I still bitterly regret at the age of 63 and
always shall) so I only got good views of the tamer wild birds. I saw no
wild Columbidae except some Red-eyed Doves Streptopelia semitorquata
and one cock Tambourine Dove Turtur tympanistria.
The Red-eyed Doves were in Mitchell Park and it was in the municipal
aviaries there that I saw Speckled Pigeons again, this time of the dark
southern race. As is the case in Britain, so in South Africa, it seems that
municipal authorities are unable to resist the temptation (I suppose
because they get the birds as free gifts?) to crowd their aviaries with dom-
esticated species to the detriment of the often rare, valuable and interest-
ing wild species that are housed with them and forced to compete, or more
often fail to compete, with them. These two Speckled Pigeons were in
an aviary with about 30 or 40 domestic pigeons of various breeds. There
were only a few nesting boxes for all these birds and, of course, each was
in possession of a pair of domestic pigeons. I was, however, able to glut my

eyes on the (to me) strange, dark beauty of the South African Speckled
Pigeons. It did not then, I think, occur to me that I might one day own
some birds of this species.
In the early 1950s I began keeping Speckled Pigeons through seeing a
pair advertised for sale, in Cage and Aviary Birds I think, and sending off
for them. When they arrived one had an injured wing, although it could
fly, and I think both were cocks but as neither came into breeding con-
dition, I am not sure of this. Some few Speckled Pigeons, the most
effeminate-looking hens and the most masculine-looking cocks, can be
sexed by minor details of head shape and expression but many cannot.

The bowing display of a vigorous male in full breeding condition is more
emphatic and exuberant than the self-assertive version of the bowing
display, which both sexes habitually use, but there is not a great deal in
it. I must confess that I was hopelessly wrong at first about two indivi-
duals which later proved their sex by breeding successfully. One was a
bird that I had picked out from eight others in a dealer's cage because
it had the most effeminate-looking head, and which later turned out to be
a cock. The other was a young hen which I bred, from a cock of the
southern race paired to a hen of the nominate race. While assuming and
just after having assumed her first adult plumage, this bird was so demon-
stratively aggressive and so constantly chasing after and displaying to other
Speckled Pigeons that I assumed she was a cock, until the effeminate-
looking cock mentioned above suddenly began to display to her, when
they paired and shortly bred successfully.
In all I kept, at one time or another, a total of ten Speckled Pigeons,
seven of which I had bought and three of which I had bred. Both for
aesthetic and scientific reasons I had hoped to be able to keep some or
all of them free-flying and, in view of their often living in or on buildings
in Africa, thought (wrongly as it turned out) that this would not prove
difficult.
The first "liberation" was quite unplanned. My only phaenota cock and
his 21 day-old daughter, who had fledged only the day before, escaped
accidentally and flew off into a snowstorm. I feared the worst but some
ten minutes later the cock was back, walking about on the roof of the
converted garage in which he lived. I thought it was only a matter of time
with him, so opened the doors (first penning his mate in their nest-box)
and also the door of a nearby aviary, while I searched for the young bird.
To my surprise, I never saw the cock bird again. It is most unusual for a
pigeon to be lost after it has once come back and I am still surprised at his
disappearance.
I had little hope of his daughter but, again to my surprise, she was back
next day and eating some corn by an aviary. This seemed a remarkable feat
as she had never fed herself before and was only 22 days old. Her growing
up had also involved her becoming timid (though from the time she was
eight days old I had spent some time handling and talking to her each day)
and when I went out, she flew off right away. However, next day she was
back and went inside the aviary whose door had been left open.
This 50% success under very adverse circumstances, led me to think
that it should not be difficult to "settle" Speckled Pigeons. I cannot now
remember the details but know that I liberated two under what I thought
were more suitable circumstances, but they went off and never came back,
and two others that escaped also never returned though one was picked up

dead five miles away two weeks later and returned to me (all had name
and address rings on them).
I think a probable reason for my failure may have been that the area in
which I lived was rather densely wooded and, from the air, in spite of open
areas created by large lawns and roads, was probably too unlike the natural
habitat of C. guinea for them to feel at ease in it or to return to it once
they had flown to a distance. I suspect that anyone living in a more open
area and who was more careful than I was to experiment at first with only,
one of a pair of nesting birds would be luckier.
Though I found most of my Speckled Pigeons were tame enough to
be watched from a few yards away, as with many other birds, complete
tameness could only be got by hand-rearing. The young bird mentioned
above was handled, brought into the house among people and so on during
her early days (eighth to 20th days) but nevertheless did not show com-
plete tameness. However, two of her young ones that I took from the nest
when eight days old and hand-reared became and remained absolutely
tame.
Unfortunately, I had to move to London in 1956, and my Speckled
Pigeons and other birds had to be given away. I tried to find good and
suitable homes for them but am not, with hindsight, at all sure that I
succeeded in this. Since then my Speckled Pigeon watching has been con-
fined to specimens in zoos, especially in the Snowdon Aviary at the Lon-
don Zoo in the 1960s and up to 1976.
Captive care and breeding
Though, of course, as for all birds, the bigger the enclosure they are
kept in the better, I found my Speckled Pigeons throve and bred success-
fully in enclosures of quite modest size. Some were housed mainly in a
garage, converted into an aviary but wired only in front, about 25 x 10x8
ft high (7.62 x 3.05 x 2.44 m); others in an aviary rather larger and higher
and with a shelter about 10 x 6 x 8 ft (3.05 x 1.83 x 2.44m) attached to
it. The birds always seemed rather quieter and more ready to breed in the
garage, probably because there they never had cats or hawks try to get at
them from above.
In very large aviaries, like the Snowdon Aviary at the London Zoo, it is
possible to have several pairs of Speckled Pigeons breeding in one enclo-
sure but in a more confined space, it certainly is not. I found that once a
pair came into breeding condition they would start attacking any other
conspecifics kept with them. Only when these latter were removed (and as
soon as they were) would they begin to nest. I have been told of a case
where a South African aviculturist habitually kept many pairs in an enclo-
sure of moderate size and found that if they were all left together then

eventually the dominant breeding pair would get tired of persecuting the
others and nest in spite of their presence. Such a course is, I think, to be
deplored on humanitarian grounds and those with enclosures of moderate
dimensions should be content with one breeding pair of Speckled Pigeons
in each.
I fed my birds on wheat, millet, canary seed, maple peas, peanuts and
hemp. Peanuts were a favourite food so I used to give these as titbits when
I was with the birds and also, in the winter months, to give each bird a
peanut or two that had been smeared with a drop of halibut oil, every few
days. As I had no heating in my aviaries, I thought giving such allegedly
"heating" seeds as hemp and peanuts could do no harm and might do
much good. The first pair to breed reared a single young bird (the other
egg had been broken), in freezing winter weather, very largely on hemp. It
was in perfect condition when it left the nest and remained so. Grit,
"Kilpatrick's Pigeon Minerals" and salt were supplied ad lib. Like all my
other pigeons, these birds ate lots of the Kilpatrick's minerals when feed-
ing young from four to 20 days old.
I used to put sawdust down deeply - 6-8in deep (15-20 cm), so it would
not blow about - on the floor of the garage aviary and the sheltered part of
the other and scatter and bury panicum millet in it. This kept the birds
busily searching about in it for some time each day. Speckled Pigeons will
nest in any sort of box or other receptacle that a domestic pigeon would
use.
Racial hybrids and varieties
A hen that I bred from a cock C. guinea phaenota to a hen C.g. guinea
was intermediate in coloration and plumage density but closer to her
father, especially in the shade of the grey parts of her plumage, than to her
mother. Two young that she produced when mated to a cock C.g. guinea
were barely distingushable from the latter race. Indeed, had I not known
their parentage, it would not have occurred to me that they were not pure
C.g. guinea.
I observed two colour varieties that were bred, undoubtedly from nor-
mally coloured parents, in the Snowdon Aviary at the London Zoo in the
1970s. One, that I first noticed as a juvenile in early 1973, had moulted
fully into adult plumage when I saw it again in March 1974 and took notes
on it.
It had some white primary feathers in each wing. The grey parts of its
plumage (but not the purplish chestnut parts) were slightly paler than
normal. The tips of the display feathers on its neck were paler, more sil-
very and less pinkish or greenish than normal. Its hides were not orange
but dark, like a "buU-eyed" pied or white domestic pigeon. Its bill, instead

of being black, was a pale fleshy grey, inclining to pure pale flesh at the
tip. The orbital skin and feet seemed rather dull but did not otherwise
differ from that of a normal bird.
The other bird was far more handsome. It was perfectly normal in plu-
mage colour but when first seen (by me) in 1974, when it was in adult
plumage but probably quite young, it had the orbital skin brick red,
strongly tinged with orange. In 1976, when I saw it again, its orbital skin
was a lovely bright deep orange, which contrasted very strongly with the
red or purple-red orbital skins of all the other Speckled Pigeons in the
aviary. It was a cock and was displaying vigorously on my last visit to the

I have seen the display flight of this bird only in the Snowdon Aviary at
the London Zoo. To my surprise it appeared more similar to that of the
Wood Pigeon Columba palumbus than to that of the Rock Pigeon. The dis-
playing bird would fly upwards with a loud clatter and an odd (for a pig-
eon) "fluttery looking" flight, then glide with wings held slightly below
the horizontal and with tail partly spread. Perhaps some of our readers can
give us details of display flights of wild Speckled Pigeons with unlimited
space available to them?
I have discussed the other displays and voice of this bird in a previous
article in our Magazine (Goodwin, 1956). Suffice here to say that its dis-
plays are very similar to but by no means identical with those of the Rock
and domestic pigeons. Its coos are loud and have a tone and intensity very
suggestive of the display coo of the Wood Pigeon. Its advertising coo starts
with a few muffled and slow notes which increase in speed and loudness.
Its display coo suggests a long-drawn version of the Rock Pigeon's but
quite lacks the "broken" effect and has a more Wood Pigeon-like tone
throughout.

HAND-REARING THE AFRICAN BLACK CRAKE
Limnocorax flavirostra
AT THE PHOENIX ZOO, ARIZONA, USA
By MARGARET SPRECKELS (Aviculturist)

The crake aviary at the Phoenix Zoo houses one pair of African Black
Crakes. The aviary is 2.4 x 6.1 x 3 m (8 x 20 x 10 ft) and encloses a pond
0.92m (3ft) in diameter, having varying depths of 1.3 to 7.6cm (^-3in).
We have found our Crakes to be extremely aggressive and intolerant of any
other birds in their enclosure.
The Crakes were purchased in February 1977 and they first went to
nest in the spring of 1978. They nested in palm fronds set up on the
ground in "A frames", one frond flat against the wire and one leaning
about 20.3-25.4cm (8-10in) apart. They reared several clutches but only
one chick (probably the oldest) from each clutch would survive. The
others would grow weaker by the day and finally die. Some attempts were
made to hand-rear the weakest chicks on mealworms but with no success.
In December 1978, the female began eating her eggs. Sometimes she would
eat them as soon as they were laid, other times she would eat them after
they had been incubated for awhile. Many times she did not even eat
them, she just dragged them to the pond and broke them. However, she
still incubated some clutches full term.
According to S. Dillon Ripley (1977), egg-eating is a common practice
with Black Crakes. In some instances, both sexes destroy the eggs. Our
male, however, has never been known to destroy an egg and incubates
them very conscientiously.
By 1982 the female was destroying all her eggs, so we decided to re-
move them and incubate them artificially; no easy task as the eggs are
laid at night, a clutch of four eggs being laid on successive nights. We
would take them away as soon as they were laid and incubate them in
our waterfowl incubator at 99.5*F dry bulb and 89*F wet bulb or 68%
humidity. The incubator automatically makes a 90* turn once every
hour. The incubation period is 20 days.
Our female then began to re-lay every two weeks for the entire sum-
mer. We became concerned about her health and offered her dummy eggs
as replacements, but she continued to lay. We supplemented the hard-
boiled egg yolk and mealworms of the diet with Osteoform, a calcium and
vitamin supplement by Vet-A-Mix. Finally, in September she stopped
laying and she and the male have been incubating the dummy eggs. This
occurrence coincided with the addition of new and more spacious palm

frond nests which afforded the pair more seclusion and privacy.
Of the several clutches that we hand-reared, we found that the chick
from the first laid egg was always strong with a good appetite and easily
reared. The second chick would be a little less willing to thrive. The third
chick would often be quite weak and only the keeper's determination
would keep it alive. The fourth chick would be weaker still and often
have crooked toes; by gently massaging the toes frequently throughout the
day, they would correct themselves in about one or two weeks.
We also found that chicks must be hand-reared separately. The oldest
and strongest chick seems to intimidate the others and will grow while
the others will not, even though the others are getting food. When chicks
are eating well on their own, they can and should (for socialisation) be re-
introduced. This is a gradual process as chicks are very territorial even at a
young age.
The chicks are kept in boxes with a heating pad at one end so that they
can move closer to or further from the heat source. The heating pad is
placed half on the bottom of the box and half going up one side. Towel-
ling is then placed over the entire bottom of the box, covering the heating
pad to keep it from getting soiled. A smaller cloth is placed over all and is
removed once or twice daily for cleaning. The chicks also like to have a
cloth to burrow under. A 1.3 x 1.3cm (Vz x Vim) welded wire top is fitted
over the top of the box to keep the chicks from jumping out. A towel is
put over the top of the box on the heating pad side to keep heat in and
provide privacy.
Given below are the formulae used for hand-rearing the chicks:
1st week :
Soaked freeze-dried ocean plankton )
Soaked trout chow ) - sprinkled with spirulina
hard-boiled egg yolk )
live brown worms (available at aquarium shops) served in water
In daylight hours only, feed from tip of finger every half hour to
hour, beginning when chick is 12 hours old. Some thicks are much
more active and willing to eat than others. Feed as much as they
will eat at each time. They will refuse when full. Dip beaks in fresh
water to accustom them to water supply.
2nd week
Start encouraging chicks to eat independently. Each chick will res-
pond to this differently.
Add to the first week's diet:-

Ground bird of prey diet (canned dog food can be substituted) and
white stage mealworms (after hard chitin skin has been shed).
Ground dry dog food, high-protein crumbles, chick starter, and
parrakeet seed (aU dry and kept in a dish available to chicks at all
times).
Continue to feed all that the chick can eat at half to one hour
intervals. Even when the chick is eating independently, it is often
the keeper's presence that triggers him to go to his food dish. When
it is established that the chick is eating independently, it can be
left for longer periods. The nature of the food, however, requires
that it is changed often.
3rd-4th weeks
Start introducing soaked egg-maker pellets, shrimp meal, occasional
brown mealworms, whole bite-sized dog food in with other dry
mixture, and finely chopped fruits, vegetables and greens (they
particularly like avocado). Decrease plankton and brown worms.
8th week
By now the chick should be on the adult diet which is:
A pan of egg-maker pellets, trout chow, shrimp meal, chopped fish,
VilecSol vitamins (by Vet-A-Mix), soaked in water.
A fruit pan consisting of various fruits, vegetables, hydroponic
barley, hard-boiled egg and bird of prey diet.
A pan containing dog chow, egg-maker pellets, high-protein
crumbles, pigeon mix and parrakeet seed.
6-12 mealworms per day per bird.
Grit and oyster shell.

Whilst surveying an Essex importer's stock in 1970,1 observed a single
greenish, almost featherless pigeon, covered with droppings, on the bottom
of a small aviary with a wounded Turtle Dove and various finches. More
out of pity than interest I purchased both the unidentified pigeon and the
Turtle Dove, on my terms.
After proper feeding and conditions I found that I had a hen Thick-
billed Green Pigeon who, having found her self respect, provided my col-
lection of doves and pigeons with its first fruit-eating pigeon.
In 1972, at the November Cage and Aviary Show, I finally identified a
healthy male out-of about 20 assorted biids in various conditions and ages
in a cage at the bottom of the display. I bought the bird at my price since
the salesman had no idea what the bird was and was obviously glad to get
rid of it. The nuptial introduction established the dominance of the female
which I suspect stemmed from greed - two feeding dishes restored the
marital bliss. Because of the copious production of loose droppings, the
birds enjoyed their first year of marriage in a large mynah cage with a wire
floor.
Daily life consisted of parrot-like walking their perches when not facing
each other on opposite perches in contemplation. This behaviour con-
tinued when released into a large flight. From observations it would appear
that these birds climb rather than fly and this is further confirmed by the
unusual grip of the foot which is more like that of a climbing bird than of
a pigeon.
Year round food consisted of diced pear, apple, peach, melon, bananas
and British garden fruit when available. Dry Universal Food was sprinkled
on the fruit twice weekly and mynah pellets were given daily. Water, al-
though available, was taken infrequently and I suspect only for cleaning
the beak and preening.
During 1973 the pair showed little sign of courting or mating and, apart
from the odd grunt, had little or no voice. It appeared that the birds were
either too old or were incompatible. Each autumn I returned the birds to
the original mynah cage in a heated bird room but, in the autumn of 1973,
I put several branches and some straw in the cage with them. I did this
purely out of sympathy, to provide them with plenty of climbable mater-
ial.

Early in 1974, still in their fairly confined quarters, the pair started
tad-bobbing and displayed obvious interest in each other, sexually. Gut-
teral notes and owl-like hooting or wooing preceded and terminated with
the cock lowering his head towards the hen. The hen then responded in a
similar manner. The cock's display appeared to be in attraction and the
hen's response one of aggression.
Several eggs, two in a clutch and pure white, were casually laid on the
wire floor. The third clutch finally encouraged an attempted incubation
by the hen.
This serious attempt at breeding prompted the removal of the pair to
quarters 2m wide x 1m deep x 0.70m high ( 6 V 2 x 3Vi x 214ft) with the
floor covered with approximately 0.30m depth of peat. These quarters
were filled almost totally with branches and were part of an outside flight
complex, roofed with translucent ribbed plastic which, in summer reached
a temperature of 90*F during the day and dropped, at night, to 40-45*F.
In the seclusion of this environment and provided with a handful of
straw, the pair made a nest on the peat floor furthest from the access door.
Two eggs were laid with both birds taking turns to incubate.
Both birds, when approached on the nest, turned to display a cocked
tail and vent with the head lowered away from the intruder. The unoccu-
pied mate would perform a positive injured flapping away from the nest
to attract the "predator's" attention. The sitting bird always "sat" very
firmly regardless of approaches and there was no wing clouting associated
with pigeon defence.
Generally my observations indicate that in captivity the birds do not
breed until they are quite mature, possibly two to three years old, and
must have complete seclusion and a warm environment. Seclusion can be
provided by giving plenty of branches for cover. I suspect that in the wild
these birds do not stray very far from their roost which provides them
with the cover and their food. There is very little flight and movement is
confined to climbing, so much so that one would think they were parrots
rather than pigeons.
The chronicle of the brood, as observed, is as follows:-

The two birds developed into adult plumage indicating a cock and a

the cock bird very much smaller. I suspect the initial acceleration in devel-
opment of the second squab to be lost during development on self-feeding,
means that they, like the parents, needed separate feeding dishes as they
would not share.

ON THE OCCASION OF THE NINETIETH ANNIVERSARY
OF THE AVICULTURAL SOCIETY

Origins are always fascinating. The Avicultural Society was founded in
Brighton towards the end of 1894 by Horatio R. Fillmer and C.S. Simpson,
two intimate personal friends, who had recently entered upon their pro-
fessional careers in law and medicine respectively. They coined the term
'aviculture', edited the first two volumes jointly - they were published
monthly at five shillings per annum or sixpence an issue - and acted as
Treasurer and Secretary respectively.
Having been bird enthusiasts from childhood, they had a fair amount of
experience in the care of a number of foreign species but, as Fillmer him-
self admitted in 1933, it is doubtful whether they would have succeeded in
making the Society a success without the co-operation of two much older
and more experienced bird keepers. Reginald Phillips, an elderly, white-
bearded retired civil servant, lived in a small house in the Hammersmith
district of London with his charming wife. The entire back garden was
wired over and connected to the drawing room of the house, and here they
achieved amazing breeding successes with birds such as the Australian Blue
Wren and Regent Bowerbird. And Dr. A.G. Butler, who worked for the
Entomological Department of the Natural History Museum, kept a large
and varied collection of birds as a hobby at his home in Beckenham. They
were both very keen and fruitful contributors to the Magazine from their
vast fund of knowledge on all matters avicultural.
Simpson relinquished his work for the Society after two years owing
to the demands of his profession, but Fillmer continued as Editor to the
end of the century, when his proposal to widen the scope of the Maga-
zine by including domestic birds, such as canaries, was opposed. This
apparently distressed him to such an extent that he resigned and subse-
quently founded an opposition journal called Bird Notes in October 1901,
which was destined for a highly successful run until 1924. From 1925 on
Fillmer was made a Vice-President of the Avicultural Society and came
back into the fold. Shortly before his death in 1942, he disclosed a long
and well-guarded secret. There was always a certain mystery about the
articles and correspondence in the Magazine from a Mr. Septimus Perkins.
This was obviously an experienced aviculturist, but he was constantly
changing his address and no one could get to visit him. The truth was that
there was "never no sich person" and Septimus Perkins was a nom de

plume for Fillmer himself, who also contributed frequently under his own
name thereby the more easily maintaining the deception. No doubt our
current Editor still has problems getting copy for the Magazine but I doubt
that she is having to go to such lengths!
In November 1894 David Seth-Smith, then a dashing young man of 19,
paid a visit to J.B. Housden, a retired business man, whose home was high
on Sydenham Hill, almost outside the gates of the Crystal Palace, south-
east London, where he won so many prizes with his birds. The young
David was after some Australian Crested Doves which Housden was breed-
ing at the time. He was much impressed by Housden's business-like aviaries
and the number and condition of the many rare species he was seeing for
the first time. As David Seth-Smith was leaving, Housden rather tenta-
tively took from his pocket what looked like a small pamphlet, saying that
he thought it might interest him as it was the first number of a new publi-
cation called the Avicultural Magazine , published by a new Society he
thought he might like to join. So Housden put up Seth-Smith as a member.
What a fortuitous moment! For so began David Seth-Smith's 70 years of
distinguished service to the Society. As a most forceful Editor he took the
Magazine to unprecedented success during two terms of editorship (1901-
1909 and 1925-1934). Though a qualified civil engineer he became Cura-
tor of Birds and Mammals at the London Zoo and was famous throughout
Britain as the pioneer of natural history broadcasts. His friendly voice
came over the air in the 1930s every Monday in the "Children's Hour",
beginning, "This is the Zoo Man speaking". When he died in 1963 he was
the much loved and respected President of the Avicultural Society.
Likewise James Housden's great interest in birds, ardent support of the
Avicultural Society and numerous contributions to its Magazine were
never failing. In 1942 at the ripe age of 92 he spent part of the last evening
of his life perusing his favourite bird books.
These, and so many, many others, who followed on, have through the
vicissitudes of ninety years (which included two World Wars) kept the
Avicultural Society together and maintained its matchless Magazine. They
have loved bird-keeping with the "love life-long-o" and been loyal to the
Society to the end of their earthly road. They are far too many to mention
and they come from all walks of life, from the most humble to doctors,
professors, dukes and even a King of Great Britain.
We believe that with the sources of birds for aviculture fast closing to
us on all sides, there has never been as great a need for the type of infor-
mation of which the Avicultural Magazine is a possible purveyor as at the
present time. Let us hope that where some have led the way, others will
continue to follow proudly on.

The world-famous Wassenaar Zoo is co-operating with the World
Wildlife Fund in a project to bring together young Bearded Vultures, now
thought to be extinct in the Alps. Out of approximately 550 zoological
gardens im the world, only eight zoos are recorded as breeding this rare
species and Wassenaar is the only Dutch zoo to join in this project.
Their female Bearded Vulture "Benno", born in 1983, will, for the
present, make up a pair with a male in Neumunster Zoo, West Germany,
and the intention is to release their possible offspring in the Alps.
"Benno" was hatched in an incubator and hand-reared with the greatest
care. Now independent, she can be safely put on the aeroplane to Neu-
munster, in the hope that soon her children may be given their freedom
far away from Wassenaar Zoo. It would be interesting to have later
news of how this project, which is being co-ordinated by the World
Wildlife Fund, succeeds since it seems to be an admirable example of
aviculture helping conservation.

Further to the interesting article by Mr. and Mrs. W. Grunebaum on
Breeding the Hyacinthine Macaw (Vol. 90, No. 1: pp. 11-16), believed to
have been a British 'first' for which the Society's Medal will be awarded,
Mrs. Grunebaum writes (October 1984) that the pair of Hyacinthines have
successfully reared another baby. The latest offspring is now flying outside
strongly and the full length of the flight. It was hatched on 5th June and
left the nesting box 14 weeks later. Apart from giving extra food and heat,
Mrs. Grunebaum did not interfere in any way and says that it was much
easier to rear than the first chick!

Malcolm Ellis has sent the following African notes:
The new species of sunbird collected on the Uzungwa Mountains, Tan-
zania, in August 1981 (see "News and Views", Vol. 89, No. 3, 1983), has
been named the Rufous-winged Sunbird Nectarinia rufipennis. Its secon-
daries are rufous-cinnamon, so is the outer web of the primaries. Presu-
mably this characteristic applies to the male and female. Otherwise, the
male is described as having a deep blue neck and back and a purple throat
with a blue then maroon breast band and a dark grey belly. The female is
heavily streaked and spotted on the underside.
Kenya has issued a new set of postage stamps featuring rare birds. The
five species figured are all considered endangered or vulnerable, in some
cases because of the threat to their habitat. The five are the White-backed
Heron, Quail Plover, Heller's Ground Thrush, White-winged Apalis and
Papyms Gonolek.
Heller's or the Taita Ground Thrush is treated now as a very distinctive
race of the Northern Olive Thrush. The Apalis (a small, brightly coloured
warbler) may already be extinct in Kenya. Known there first from two
specimens collected in 1878, the White-winged Apalis has not been rec-
orded in Kenya since 1961, when a third was collected.
In Tanzania, this Apalis was rediscovered in the Uzungwa Mountains
by Simon Stuart, who discovered the Rufous-winged Sunbird.
Three ornithologists have claimed for Kenya the world record for the
most bird species seen in a single day. The three left Lake Baringo just
after midnight and finished in a suburb of Nairobi at 11.30 p.m., when an
African Wood Owl brought their tally to 290 species. The previous record
was 288 species, seen in Zambia in 1975.

A little-known watercolour of an American Egret painted by the great
naturalist and artist, John James Audubon, has been reproduced for the
first time anywhere in a poster being issued by the New York Historical
Society. The full-colour poster reproduces the 1813 watercolour (37 3/8 x
25 l A in.) of a lifesize Egret in a version of the bird that was not included
in the artist's monumental The Birds of America. The poster is the first in
a planned series of full-colour reproductions to be issued by the Society
from its unique Audubon watercolour collection and its publication coin-
cides with the approaching bicentennial of the artist's birth on 26th April
1785.
The poster, priced at 16.50 US dollars (unframed), measures 36 x 24in
(91.5 x 61.0 cm), was designed by Bruce Campbell and printed by Rapo-
port Printing Corporation on 801b Warren's Lustro Offset Enamelled Dull
Cover. It is available at the Museum Shop at the New-York Historical
Society, 170 Central Park West, New York, N.Y. 10024, or by mail (post-
age and packing extra - please write for an estimate).
For more than 100 years, the New-York Historical Society has been the
home of hundreds of Audubon watercolours and memorabilia, including
433 of the 435 original watercolours that served as the models for The
Birds of America. In February 1863, twelve years after Audubon's death
his widow offered these pieces to the Society for the modest sum of
4000 US dollars; today the value of this unique collection is nearly im-
possible to estimate.
The habitat of the American Egret is widespread, ranging through
North and South America. In the United States it can most often be
found in the Gulf States.

A Cinnamon Senegal Dove
</sectionHeader>

In the October-December, 1977, issue of the Magazine (Vol. 83, No. 4),
W.D. Cummings refers to white, pied and other mutations of the Senegal,
Palm or Laughing Dove being 'popular' in South African aviaries. A further
note by the same author, in the first issue of the current year (Vol. 90,
No. 1) refers to Pied, Black-eyed White, albino and Cinnamon Streptopelia
senegalensis at Mitchell Park Aviaries, Durban.
Early this year I saw a 'Cinnamon Senegal Dove' advertised in Cage and
Aviary Birds and sent away for it. On arrival, the bird proved to be of a
basic fawn colouring, with all the normal markings present, bearing the
same relation to the original as the domestic Barbary Dove does to its pro-
genitor, the African Collared Dove S. roseogrisea. Although kept with a
normal male all summer, the Cinnamon Senegal (said by the dealer to have
laid infertile eggs while in his possession) showed no response to the for-
mer's nest-calling, and was found dead a few days ago. A pity, as I naturally
had hopes of establishing the mutation. I should be very interested to hear
of anyone else having this or other colour varieties of the species in their

Fieldfares refusing unnatural foods
The Fieldfare Turdus pilaris often visits gardens where birds are fed, es-

pecially during hard weather. I have not, however, met anyone who has
actually seen it take any food more unnatural to it than cultivated varieties
of fruits, and these usually of species whose wild forms occur within its
normal range.
In the hard weather of January 1982, two Fieldfares spent much time
in the garden of my former home at Herne Hill, in south-east London
Both were first seen on 8th January, one on 13th January, both were
present on 14th, 15th, 16th and 17th. When first seen, they appeared to
be in a starving condition, so I endeavoured to provide them with foods

richer in fats and proteins than fruit, but these efforts proved vain.
On the day the Fieldfares were first seen in the garden, many other
birds, including Blackbirds Turdus memla were feeding on soaked bread
and various scraps. I had the impression that it was the sight of these other
birds feeding that first attracted the Fieldfares but by the time they had
alighted, their interest was centred on a small wild Rose Rosa canina bush
that still had some ripe hips on it. One of the Fieldfares plucked a hip and
swallowed it with some difficulty. Then, taking alarm for some unknown
reason, both flew off.
On 13th, when I was again home all day, one Fieldfare came and fed on
the hips. As few were now left, I cut a sweet apple in two and impaled the
halves, cut side up, in the rose bush. When the Fieldfare returned a few
minutes later, it went at once to one of these (ignoring the rose hips) and
eagerly ate the pulp. I then cut some bits of raw, lean meat into "womi-
like" short strips of a suitable size for a Fieldfare to swallow, washed them
to remove the stickyness that sometimes makes birds refuse raw meat,
when they would otherwise accept it, and laid the strips, each separate,
on the cut surface of the apples. When the Fieldfare returned, it not only
refused to sample the meat, it even picked up three pieces in its bill and
flung them aside in the course of eating the apple pulp.
On the next three days both Fieldfares came to the garden for food
several times each day. I supplied impaled halved apples, their cut surfaces
rubbed and covered with fine white sugar and with suitably sized morsels
of meat, milksop and cooked egg placed on them. The Fieldfares very
eagerly age the sugared apple pulp but, except to toss them aside at times,
made no attempt to eat any of the other foods placed on them (all inci-
dentally, prime favourites with the local Song Thrushes T philomelos and
Blackbirds). Most of the time there were various scraps on the ground and
much soaked bread with other birds feeding on these. The Fieldfares were
mutually hostile so that, at any one period, only one would be in the
apple-supplied rose bush and one would be seeking food on the ground. At
such times the bird on the ground never attempted to sample any food
other than fallen apple or rose hips and the droppings of its companion or
itself when these apparently consisted mainly of only partly or poorly dig-
ested hips.
Many birdwatchers assume that birds of any species, when hungry, will
take any food, natural or unnatural, that they come across, provided, of
course, that they are physically capable of dealing with and digesting it,
but this is not always the case. Even individuals, and perhaps especially
starving individuals, of such species as the Wood Pigeon Columba palum -
bus , feral pigeon C. iivia , and Black Kite Milvm migrans , may refuse to
sample a "new" food if they do not see conspecifics eating it and, at least

in the case of the Wood Pigeon (pers. obs.), sometimes even if they do. I
was, however, surprised that the Fieldfares refused meat and cooked egg
that was carefully prepared so as to be easily swallowed and placed so that
they almost certainly would (and, in fact, did) pick it up in their bills
(though only to discard it) in the course of feeding.
On the morning of the 17th, both Fieldfares came and fed but it was
then thawing fast and they were not seen again in the garden. Some modern
dieticians tell us that sugar is positively harmful to the human system,
except when taken in the forms in which it occurs naturally in fruits or
other food but these Fieldfares showed a striking improvement in condi-
tion after only a few feeds on the sugared apples. White sugar too!
