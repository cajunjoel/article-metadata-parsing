The Avicultural Society was founded in 1894 for the study of British
and foreign birds in freedom and captivity. The Society is international
in character, having members throughout the world.
Membership subscription rates per annum for 1994 as for 1993: British
Isles #18.00: Overseas #21.00 (plus #6.00 for airmail). (U.K. f^nds
please). The subscription is due on 1st January of each year and those
joining the Society later in the year will receive back numbers of the
current volume of the AVICULTURAL MAGAZINE.
Subscription, changes of address, orders for back numbers etc. should
be sent to:
THE HON. SECRETARY AND TREASURER, THE AVICULTURAL
SOCIETY, c/o BRISTOL ZOOLOGICAL GARDENS, CLIFTON,
BRISTOL, BS8 3HA, ENGLAND.
THE AVICULTURAL MAGAZINE welcomes original articles that have
not been published elsewhere and that essentially concern the aviculture
of a particular bird or group of birds, or that describe their natural history.
Articles should be preferably typewritten, with double spacing, and the
scientific names as well as the vernacular names of birds should be given.
References cited in the text should be listed at the end of the article. Line
drawings should be in Indian ink on thick paper or card; black and white
or colour photographs which illustrate a particular point in the article will
be used where possible and should be clearly captioned. If authors wish
their eventual return, they must say so when submitting the article and
write their name on the back of each photograph.

I am certain all members of the Avicultural Society will wish to
be associated with these words of appreciation to my predecessor
as editor of the magazine, Professor J. R. Hodges. I suppose it is
only really possible to appreciate the effort that goes into produc-
ing a publication like the Avicultural Magazine if one has some
insight into the demands such a &amp;apos;calling* can make on one&amp;apos;s time -
and temper!
Since I have spent much of the last three decades editing and
overseeing the production of a variety of industrial publications I
was fairly well prepared for the task in hand. However, I totally
concur with Bob Hodges&amp;apos; comments in his editorial in 1993&amp;apos;s final
issue that &amp;apos;...it is hard work, time consuming and often boring&amp;apos; -
although I am happy to confirm that, thus far, the last thing I have
been is bored!
Let us not underestimate what Bob achieved during his three-
year occupation of the editorial chair. When he took over the reins
the situation confronting him was far more daunting than that with
which I have been coming to terms over recent months. The
magazine was appearing only intermittently, to the considerable
irritation of many members, and much had to be done to restore
editorial integrity and frequency of publication.
He did not spare himself to achieve those objectives as rapidly
as possible - and having done so, he turned his energies to the task
of consolidating the position. The result, and I shall be eternally
grateful to him for it, was that he was able to pass on to me an
editorial operation not only in pristine condition, but running as
efficiently as a thoroughbred watch.
During the hand-over period - which had to be undertaken at
long distance because of my other work commitments - he devoted
considerable time and trouble to ensure the transition was as
smooth as possible. He has worked tirelessly on behalf of the

<bodyText confidence="0.997069083333333" page_id="56230573"  page_num="2" year="" vol="">
express thanks to him on behalf of all members.
It is gratifying, at this stage, to have received a substantial
amount of material and I hope the momentum will be maintained in
the months ahead. That the Society&amp;apos;s long-standing international
character is maintained is clearly essential and I am delighted to
see, among recent submissions for the magazine, contributions
from the USA, Singapore, the Philippines, South Africa, Italy,
Germany and the UK.
I welcome the prospect of having a broader spectrum of readers
contributing to these columns. If they have not already done so,
prospective contributors should first look at the information on the
inside front cover which sets out in clear terms the type of material
that is sought. On the other hand, if any member has interesting and
original observations to pass on but is uncertain about any aspect
of its preparation, then please write to me at the address also given
on the inner back cover.
Thanks to some good housekeeping at the Society&amp;apos;s Bristol Zoo
headquarters, it has at long last been possible to restore colour
illustrations to the Avicultural Magazine. The four centre pages
will be used for this purpose in each issue during 1994 - Centenary
Year - and we will hope to continue after that. Much depends on
whether it is possible to raise extra revenue by publishing selected
display advertisements.
Colour is costly and I make no apologies for emphasising that
only top quality illustrative material will be used; to reproduce
substandard prints or transparencies would be a waste of the
Society&amp;apos;s (and indirectly, members&amp;apos;) money. In addition to slides,
etc. submitted by members, Dennis Avon, whose work will be
familiar to many, has kindly agreed to provide colour transparen-
cies, without fee, for reproduction in the magazine from time to
time.
May I also put in a plea for contributions to News and Views, and
also express the hope that better use is made of the opportunity for
members to place classified advertisements in the magazine. The
latter items are an important element in a publication such as this
and any intended for the next issue should reach me not later than

BREEDING THE CAPUCHINBIRD

The Capuchinbird or Calfbird Perissocephalus tricolor is a little
known member of the Cotingidae. Like its better known relative,
the Cock-of-the-Rock Rupicola rupicola, it is a crow-sized bird
with a large and powerful bill, short tail and strong legs. The
species is predominately coffee-brown to cinnamon in colour with
blackish wings and tail, contrasted with the bare blueish-grey skin
of the head. Distribution of the Capuchinbird is limited to the
Guianas, Venezuela south of the Orinoco, and adjacent areas of
Brazil north of the Amazon (Snow 1971).
This species, unlike most of the other cotingas, is not considered
dimorphic; however, it has been our experience that females have
been smaller in overall size and weight. The females in our
collection range in weight from 233 - 271 grams, while the male
ranges in weight from 272 - 349 grams. The sexes also seem to
differ in vocalisation, males producing an extended two-toned call
while the female produces a shorter, more raspy monotone call.
In early 1988, the San Diego Zoological Society received a
single specimen which was determined, through surgical sexing, to
be a female. In 1990 four more individuals were obtained. After
a 30 day quarantine period, they were also surgically sexed and
determined to be a male and three females, giving a total of one
male and four females.
We were disappointed in this sex ratio because the Capuchinbird
is a lek species. Several males display in close proximity to each
other, while the females observe from the perimeter. After select-
ing a male, a female flies to her chosen mate's display perch where
copulation usually occurs. Even through the females nest in
relative close proximity to the lek, the males are believed not to
participate in nest building, incubation or chick rearing (Snow
1971).
In February, 1990 we set up a single pair of Capuchinbirds rather
than housing all five birds together.. The decision was made on the
limited enclosure space available. The exhibit chosen is an outside
enclosure measuring 3.7mx6mx3m, The rear wall is concrete
with two doors leading into ante-rooms used as keeper access. The
back 72.6 cms is covered by a concrete roof, while the rest of the

enclosure is covered with 1.3 cm x 2.5 cm 12-gauge galvanised
welded wire.
The enclosure contains a wide variety of plant life analogous to
those found in their natural rainforest habitat. The plants consisted
of a single specimen of Ficus elastica , Clivia minita , Thunbergia
grandiflora and Hibicus rosa-sinensis spp. These plants were
positioned in such a manner as to create thick to moderate foliage
in the rear and sides of the exhibit with the centre area being more
open in the hope of creating an arena for possible courtship
displaying.
This enclosure also houses several other species of neotropical
birds: Silver-throated Tanager Tangara icterocephala frantzii, Bay-
headed Tanager T. gyrola, Golden-masked Tanager T.larvaia
franciscae , Orange-billed Sparrow Arremon aurantiirostris
rufidorsalis , Red-legged Honeycreeper Cyanerpes c. carneipes and
Bare-faced Ground Do \q Metriopelia ceciliae.
The diet for birds in the enclosure consists of a diced fruit mix
(apples, papaya, grapes, and boiled long-grain brown rice), an
avocado slice, crickets, mealworms Tenebrio molitor, mega worms
T. obscurus , anoles Anolis anolis , pinkie mice, soaked Purina Hi-
Pro dogchow and Zeigler Low-iron pellets. Blair&amp;apos;s Super Preen
powdered vitamin/mineral supplement is sprinkled on the diet. The
doves are also provided with a finch seed mix consisting of millets
and niger.
The male and one female were set up in February, 1991.
Beginning early that spring, the male began courtship vocalisations
as described by Barbara Snow in her 1972 observations of two lek
sites in Guiana (Snow 1972). Even though the male continued to
vocalise throughout the year there was no apparent response by the
female until 17th July, 1992. It was on this date that a twig platform
was discoved in the thick tangles of a Thunbergia vine at approx-
imately 1.8 m above the ground in the back of the exhibit.
The platform was constructed of Melaleucha spp. twigs that
were part of the mulch used to cover the ground in the exhibit. The
twigs used for the base of the platform were approximately 6 ins
(15cm.) in length. Since similar twigs were not abundant in the
exhibit, more were offered. The female was observed carrying the
twigs to the platform structure, expanding it in both diameter and
height until it was nearly 22.9 cm in diameter and 7.6 - 10.1 cm
thick. The nest structure was losely constructed and remained a
platform with only a slight indentation for an egg.
During this period the male continued to call and to solicit the

female, occasionally following her to the nest site. This seemed
inconsistent with the known behaviour of other cotinga and lek
species and proved detrimental to the success of the first egg which
was laid on 7th August, 1992. At approximately 9.00 am, both birds
were observed in the nest in what appeared to be a skirmish. The
male left the nest site and returned to his display area. The female
was then observed flying to the front of the enclosure with an
eggshell in her beak, dropping it to the ground.
After this failed attempt at nesting, the female showed no
interest in either the male or the nest. This was not, however, as
surprising as the decrease in vocalisations and courtship displays
by the male. This absence of breeding behaviour continued for
approximately the next seven days, after which the female once
again began to exhibit interest in the nest. Almost simultaneously,
the male began to increase his vocalisations and displays.
Suspicious that the female was about to recycle, we began to
watch the nest activity very carefully so that, if necessary, we could
intervene. On 24th August the female was obseved sitting in the
nest - leaving immediately upon disturbance by the keeper. It was
at that this time that an egg was confirmed. Observations were then
made from the front of the enclosure in order to lessen interference.
The male began to pursue the female and she appeared to be
nervously avoiding the nest area. This continued for about 20
minutes when it was decided to remove the male from the enclosure
and put him in the adjacent exhibit. Even with this arrangement
the female continued to appear nervous and unwilling to return to
the nest, and continually watched the male.
After approximately 15 minutes it was decided to move the male
to another area of the zoo so the female could not see or hear him.
She spent the next 10 minutes apparently looking for the male. It
was only after this that she seemed to relax and returned to the nest
and began to incubate. Throughout the 26 days of incubation the
female would leave the nest upon any keeper disturbance in the
exhibit or in the adjoining enclosures. This allowed for a daily
visual check for the integrity of the egg, which was cream-coloured
and covered with spots and blotches of dark brown to dark reddish-
brown. It measured 27.5 mm x 32 mm.
Three days before the anticipated hatch, a video camera and
monitor were set up in the adjoining enclosure. This allowed
observation without disrupting activity at the nest. On the morning
of 17th Septemebr, the 25th day of incubation, a pip was discoved.
All disturbance was kept to a minimum throughout the day and the

nest was not examined again until the next morning.
At 6.30 am on 18th September, the 26th day of incubation,we
had our first view of a Capuchinbird chick. Not knowing how the
female would react to our intrusion and handling of the chick, we
decided not to weigh it for the first several days. During this time
the female continued to leave the nest when the keeper entered the
enclosure, so on the fourth day we decided to take advantage of her
absence and remove the chick for weighing.
Covered in long bright orange-chestnut down, the chick weighed
26 grams and was 7.6 cm in length. Its most striking feature was
the enormous breadth and gape of beak.
The chick was fed predominately protein with the most fre-
quently offered items being mealworms, mega worms, anoles and-
pinkies. When feeding anoles, the female was observed putting
them into the youngster&amp;apos;s mouth, removing them and then, after
swallowing them herself, giving them back to the chick. Even from
the first week, the chick appeared to take them without trouble.
On 26th September, nine days after hatching and having at-
tained a weight of 64 grams, the chick&amp;apos;s eyes began to open and
feather tracks on the wings and back were becoming visible. On
day 26, the youngster was fully feathered and with the exception of
two cranial tracks extending from the crown of the head down to the
cere, was identical to the adults.

flight was not observed for approximately another week.
At day 61, the fledgling was observed for the first time at the
food pan, where the female fed it some fruit. It was not until day
64 that the chick took food from the pan by itself. On day 131, when
it weighed approximately 269 grams, the female refused to feed the
chick.
On 2nd March the young Capuchinbird weighed 259 grams. It
was surgically sexed as an immature female and moved to another
enclosure.
The male was returned to the enclosure housing the breeding
female after a two-week introduction period in an adjoining enclo-
sure. Another adult female has been placed in an adjacent enclo-
sure. If this second female appears receptive to the male, we will
be able to allow him access to her giving us the possibility of two
nesting females.

As the Avicultural Society approached the end of its first quarter
century in the gloom of the First World War, Mrs. E. Johnstone,
herself a great aviculturist, the first to both keep and breed the
Mikado Pheasant and the Mt. Apo Lorikeet (named Trichoglossus
johnstoniae in her honour), forwarded a letter, written in French, to
the Avicultural Magazine. Its editor, the eminent Hubert Astley,
presented the following extract, here reproduced in full:
'Mrs. Johnstone sends a letter from M. Delacour in France, in
which he writes that although his chateau was invaded by Germans
in September last, he only lost a few birds; amongst which were
some rare waxbills; through the aviary doors being left opened.
M. Delacour successfully bred Buffon&amp;apos;s Touracos last year, and
also Columba speciosa, as well as a great many hybrid Mikado-
Elliott Pheasants. He remarks "je crois que personne n&amp;apos;avait jamais
eleve de touracous; les Jeunes sont maintenant pareils aux parents."
Of course M. Delacour is mistaken, for Mrs. Johnstone herself
was successful in breeding touracos at Burrswood.
(A French aviculturist in the War Zone. February, 1916. (Series
III) Vo.VII,120.)*
There were members of the Avicultural Society introduced to
the 25-year-old Jean Delacour, who joined the Society in 1916.
Given that this note is largely written by the Rev. Astley it is, none-
the-less, considered the first of the 281 articles by Dr. Delacour
which appear in the pages of this magazine, spanning all four
quarter centuries of its publication, the last appearing in 1982
(Gibbard, 1988, Lindholm, 1988). It is my intention to present, in
this Centenial Volume of the Avicultural Magazine , excerpts from
at least one of Dr. Delacour&amp;apos;s articles from each of the 64 years that
he wrote for it, and thereby give an overview of aviculture during
this time, as these writings not only cover his own extraordinarly
diverse activities, but those of private and public collections
around the world.

persa buffoni , is a note by the Rev. Astley, which I believe has been
largely overlooked; though I have discussed it previously (Lindholm,
1987). Mr. Astley (who would shortly be one of Delacour&amp;apos;s closest
friends), states that the female Touraco, and likely the male as well,
were the same birds that bred for Mrs. Johnstone in 1904, the first
captive breeding for the family (Johnstone, 1904). She identified
her birds as T. macrorhynchus, a designation one continues to see
in print (Rutgers and Norris, 1972). Delacour (1925) himself
considered his birds and Mrs. Johnstone&amp;apos;s to be separate species, so
perhaps they were, but from what we now know of the touraco&amp;apos;s
remarkable reproductive longevity, it is certainly not impossible
that the world&amp;apos;s first captive breeding pair may have continued to
produce chicks at Villers-Bretonneux until their destruction in
1918.
'In the month of April of 1914, Monsieur Robert Pauwels let me
have a pair of Buffon&amp;apos;s Touracos which he had retained after the
sale of his magnificent collection ... at Everberg (Belgium). He had
had these birds in his possession for some years. They were in
beautiful condition, but had never yet nested in his aviaries.
Directly they arrived at Villers-Bretonneux, I installed them in an
outdoor aviary ...
'In June, two months after their arrival, I found on some straw
in the nesting box beneath the shelter, two round white eggs the size
of those of a Golden Pheasant. Male and female incubated them
alternately, and in 18 days two young were hatched ... The parents
took great care of them, but on the eighth day I found them dead
upon the ground. I fancy it was the father who had done the
deed ...
'Three days afterwards two new eggs were laid in the same nest,
which was always kept beautifully clean. The young were hatched
in the month of July. After a few days, one was found dead on the
ground. I then removed the male bird from the aviary, but his mate
at once abondoned the remaining young one, which died. The
parents showed pleasure when they were reunited. It was just then
that war was declared, and I left Villers-Bretonneux on the 1st
August (1914). I remained without news of my birds until the end
of September, only knowing that the Germans had arrived at my
home on the 30th of August, and had been driven out on the 12th of
September, without having done great damage to my aviaries.
(They had, however, killed a white Rhea, some rare waxbills, some
sunbirds, etc.)

actively in my absence with my birds, wrote to me that the touracos
had again laid in the month of August, and the young ones had been
born during the Germans&amp;apos; invasion! One was dead, but the other
was then more than a month old. The parents had taken good care
of it, the male bird having done it no harm. The nestling lived until
November, but it was rickety, with malformed feet. It died. The
parents were then placed in the heated compartment until the
following May.
&amp;apos;The following are my Mother&amp;apos;s notes on the touracos during
1915:-
'In the month of June, the female laid two eggs in the same nest
as in the proceeding year, and two young ones were hatched. They
were thrown out and found dead on the ground after a few days. The
second clutch was laid immediately, and two young were hatched
on the 10th and 12th of August respectively. This time the parents
took good care of them, and on the 5th of September, the strongest
of the two left the nest and was found perching upon a bush. It was
still very small, and covered with black down, and lacked the crest.
But it flew fairly well, as it had some partly grown flight feathers
which were black in colour; and returned every night to the
nessting-box.
'On the 20th of September its crest began to show, and its
feathers grew, some red quills appearing in the wings. The other
young one was rickety like that of the proceeding year, and never
left the nest. It died at the beginning of October ...
'When I went on leave to Viller-Bretonneux in January 1916 I
found the young touraco exactly resembled its parents; the three
birds were always very united, and the parents allowed the young
one to take the pieces of banana which were given to them, first...
'The young touraco began to feed itself at about the age of six
weeks; the two birds fed it by regurgitation, after the manner of
pigeons and parrots. We always give our touracos the same food
even when they have young ones; namely bananas, potatoes chopped
in pieces and dry raisins ...
'To sum up, this is what my pair of touracos have produced:
1914. Three nests. Six eggs. Six young ones, one of which
survived for two months.
1915. Two nests. Four eggs. Four young ones, one of which
lived two months, the other has become adult/

that these insects are now given to the birds at the Zoological
Gardens. Can you tell me if they are good for them, and if they
would be suitable for my Paradise birds, Motmot, Toucans, Thrush-
es, etc. The insects eat ivy leaves.
Yours, etc ... Jean Delacour (France).'
(A beetle (?) for breeding as food. November, 1916. (Series III)
Vol. VIII, 42.)
The Rev. Astley appended; 'I wrote to Mr. Seth-Smith, Curator
of Birds at the London Zoological Gardens, who replied that he
does not know this insect. Can any member enlighten us? Is it a
beetle?' In reply came a somewhat ascerbic note from Pierre
Amedie Pichot (1916), to the effect that this species is a stick-insect
Orthoptera , and that "... The Field published some time ago a note
from the London Zoological Gardens stating that stick-insects had
been given for food not only to the birds, but also to some ...
mammals, such as Marmosets ..."
&amp;apos;Although my departure for the Army dated from August, 1914,
I was able that year to see something of my birds: a convalescence,
some leave, and above all, the chance that brought me near home
during the summer, gave me the opportunity of paying fairly
frequent visits, and to obtain fleeting glimpses of them.
'I came to the conclusion that the close proximity of the battles
had no bad effect upon my birds, except that a much greater number
of eggs were unfertile, a fact which is no doubt annoying, but not
important on the whole. Considering their nearness to the &amp;quot;front&amp;quot;
during more than two years, the essential point was not so much the
increase of their numbers as the decrease. The coming and going
of aviators, their fights, the appalling bombardment in the near
neighbourhood seemed to trouble the birds very little and to cause
no damage ...
'Up till now an Ostrich has laid four eggs, whilst her mate has
become more and more wicked, and has several times attacked his
keeper. Neither have they suffered from the snow in which they
walked about for a fortnight at the end of the winter, only going into
their unheated shed for the night.
'...The Egrets, egretta and candidissima , have their enclosure,
but have evinced no inclination to nest. Although they never have
fish to eat, they are in perfect condition. The smaller waders, such
as Ibis, Gallinules, Ruffs and Reeves, Turnstones, Plovers, etc.,
keep in good health ...

fowl, very little reproducation and few deaths. Some are full-
winged, and only fly to escape from any danger. The Barnicle and
Maned Geese have not laid, nor yet the Ringed Teal. There is a
little company of Falcated Duck on the water, which give a fine
effect.
'...Buffon&amp;apos;s Touracos have reared a young one under the same
conditions as in 1915, after having destroyed their first clutch of
eggs, and as I write (October, 1916) a third clutch has been laid.
'... The Toucans have lived for more than three years, and are in
fine plumage; they do not leave their large compartment in the
heated corridor.
'The five species which I possess have all the same habits, and
are very tame and amusing.
'These birds are not infrequently ailing, remaining for several
days without eating, and their feathers ruffle, having no power to
hold on to the perches.
'Other species of birds would succumb under such circumstanc-
es, but the Toucans, on the contrary, recover after a few days, so
that I am not very anxious when it is reported to me that one is ill
'... A few words as to the Paradise-birds. Alas, they only number
three specimens: an immature male of the Greater Paradise-bird
Paradisea apoda , and two males, one adult, the other approaching
that stage of Wilson&amp;apos;s Schlegelia wilsoni ...These, along with the
Sunbirds, came to me from the collection of the Marquis de Segur,
which he had in Paris ...

The article from which the above was excerpted was accompa-
nied by the last installment of an inventory, with comments, by the
Chevalier Debreul (originally published in the journal of La Societe
Nationale d&amp;apos;Acclimation de France) of Delacour&amp;apos;s birds. The first
installment appeared in pages 34 - 41 of Vol. VIII, while the second
ran from page 58 to 60. A total of 1,345 specimens of 344 species
and subspecies were at Villers-Bretonneux as of June, 1916.
'I received four Red-crowned Pigeons Pigeons hollandais in the
spring of 1914, three males and one female, which were in fairly
good condition, although evidently worn by their voyage ... I
installed them in an aviary in the heated corridor, where they
settled on a branch, nestling one against another, preening and
arranging their feathers, and only leaving their perch to fly to the
food-tray, from which they ate greedily and copiously of rice boiled
in sweetened milk, with bananas and other fruits cut into small

pieces ...
'Indeed, the Pigeons regained their health so much that I found
their aviary in a state of confusion one morning; one of the male
birds was hunting and knocking his companions about, who, fright-
ened, were crouching in the corners. This seemed to me curious,
considering that up till then the three males appeared to be the best
of friends and apparently attached to each other. I removed the
aggressor, but the two remaining pigeons fought, so that I had to
place each one in a separate flight.
'I then made an attempt to put the female with each of the males
in turn, but without success, for she would have been quickly killed
had I left her to the fury of their attack on her.
'Each of the four birds was consequently put by itself at the time
that the war broke out.
'For a year I saw them no more!
'When I had my first leave home, in July, 1915,1 found that one
of the pigeons had died, whilst the others appeared to be in very bad
health, their plumage and their bills soiled. I at once put them in
an open-air aviary communicating with a heated compartment and
had the satisfaction of seeing them benefiting by the change after
a few days ... I feel certain that fresh air and space is absolutely
necessary in order to keep them in good condition.
'Unfortunately it has been impossible to leave the female with
one of the males, and consequenly one has no hope of their
breeding.'
(The Red-crowned Pigeon Alectroenas pulcherrima. March,
1917. (Series III) Vol. VIII, 139 - 141).
'Last winter was certainly the coldest I ever experienced at
Villers-Bretonneux (Somme) since I have kept birds. Up to January
20th the weather was soft and rainy; afterwards a little snow fell,
and it froze hard until the middle of February; about every night the
thermometer indicated -15*C and more.
'The ice in the pond exceeded 45 cm., and all the birds kept out
of doors had only ice or snow to slake their thirst.
'All that time the sun shone and the wind blew ~only the last
week; and the war prevented the cold from being mitigated on
account of want of coal, etc.

'The cranes, storks, etc., were out of doors during the day, but
driven into an unheated house for the night. The ostriches and
white Rheas remained in their unheated shed, whose windows were
opened in the morning. The macaws and other parrots and parra-
keets lived well in an unheated room and bore the frost every night
without harm. The other birds remained in the heated house when
indeed the thermometer indicated sometimes only 4*C. In spite of
this , sun and sugar birds, tanagers, etc. never had any disease;
two birds only died of pulmonary illness, but perhaps the most
valuable - they were both the Wilson&amp;apos;s Paradise birds, it is a great
pity, for they were in such good condition. The great Paradise bird
did not suffer.
Some Great Egrets, stupidly kept out of door during the first
days, and though sheltered afterwards, soon died, as well as some
pochards and Tufted Ducks, which had no water to swim in; the
Black-necked Swans, Variegated Sheldrakes, Black-backed [Brant]
Geese, and all the tree ducks, kept indoors only at night-time and

the year a very interesting package from the Gaboon,, in which was
found a superb bird - the Great Touraco.
'The different Touracos are always rare enough in collections,
in spite of their hardy temperament and their readiness to breed in

... This year, at the end of May, it was noticed that the hen was
carrying pieces of straw in her beak, and manifested a good deal of
agitation; and so I had the idea of opening the door between the
compartments. The two birds straightway approached each other
and were soon united.
Two days afterwards one egg was laid under a shelter in a
basket, where the pigeons had already placed a little dry grass. This
egg was rather large compared with the size of the bird, and longer
than those of doves in general; it was white, with a very delicate
shell. The parents sat most assiduously, after replacing one another
on the nest, but at the end of ten days the egg proved unfertile.
'On June 15th, 1917, the hen laid another egg in a nest placed
in a young fir-tree; but this was situated in a corner of the aviary
nearest the path, and the constant passing of visitors distrubed the
birds, who abandoned the nest after a few days ...
To avoid such another failure, I put the pigeons in a large aviary
(6m x 4m) planted with thick bushes, in which I placed several
nests. In the early days of August an egg was again laid in a very
small basket, placed higher than all the others, in a witch-elm..
'This nest was left alone for fear of disturbing the birds ... and
towards August 25th, it was seen that it contained a young one a few
days old, rather similar to those of many granivorous doves. By
September 12th it was completely covered with feathers and able
to fly. ...The parents fed it on their own customary diet - crushed
potatoes, hemp-seed, and boled rice, with sweetened &amp;apos;milk and
bananas. The latter fruit was unobtainable from September 10th,
and was replaced by pears.... Some authors declare that the "Pigeon
Hollandais" lays two eggs per clutch. This may be the case in their
own country (Seychelles Islands), but it is to be remarked that in
this case these birds each time produced only one egg ,.. 5

4 ... on account of the length of the war, I parted with a good many
of my birds, keeping only a few rare birds and pets, about four
hundred.
'After the war I intend to move my collection into a warmer
country than Northern France ... My three pairs-ofBuffon&amp;apos;s Touracos

luck! Two of the hens were bred at Villers-Bretonneux. I hope I
shall be more sucessful this year.

before the war. It is now impossible to find Australian and Asiatic
birds.'
(Notes from the aviaries at Villers-Bretonneux. April, 1918.
(Series III) Vol.iX,201.)
The letter from which the above was extracted is dated January
23rd, 1918. In April of that year, the Germans broke through the
Western Front. Dr. Graham Renshaw (1918), then Editor of the
AviculturalMagazine , announced: 'By a misfortune without paralled
in the history of aviculture, Lieut. Delacour&amp;apos;s collection at Villers-
Bretonneux has been utterly destroyed.' Dr. Renshaw continued
with a list of 360 birds of 141 species, subspecies and mutations,
which died there; every specimen in the collection.
'My duties with the British Army having summoned me into the
part of Germany occupied by the Allies, I was able to visit the
Cologne Zoological Gardens on December 23rd last.
'Having many a time heard during the course of the war that the
starving Germans had been compelled to sacrifice their animals, I
supposed that I should see only empty cages. What was my
astonishment to still find there a very fine series of animals, and a
collection, all things considered, better, indeed, than that in Paris
or even London!
'The Bird House is very well appointed: one finds cages all
round. The centre is occupied by aquaria and vivaria. The
collection of Parrakeets there is remarkable ... amongst others,
Lear&amp;apos;s Macaw and the Gang-gang Cockatoo C. galeatus , and a fine
pair of Polythorynchus stellatus [ one of the Calyptorhynchus?].
The Amazons, Pionus, etc. are well represented A.diademata ,
bodini , P. menstruus , etc. There ... is a good pair of Cyanolyseus
patagonicus and a charming Brontogerispyrrhopterus. Further on
I note a little Heron with a most curious beak, enormous beak
(Canchroma cochlearia); a Dacelo gigantea , a Toco Toucan, sev-
eral Hornbills, a Nicobar Pigeon, a Giant Whydah, Chinese Blue
Magpies, and a number of small and medium-sized birds. Further

'Dear Dr. Renshaw, -1 am glad to tell you that I have got a new
country seat in Normandy, the Chateau de Cleres (Seine-Inferieure)
between Rouen and Dieppe.
'I shall attempt immediately to build aviaries and arrange the
park for birds. There is running water and a lake of about three
acres, quite convenient for Waders and Waterfowl. I hope to have
ready for next spring a bird gallery, two bird-rooms, twenty aviar-
ies with heated shelters and twenty enclosures, as well as larger
paddocks for Ostriches, Rheas, Cassowaries and Cranes.
'I think it will be a good beginning, and hope to improve it later
on. I cannot possibly pretend to keep at once the same number of
birds as I used to do .., owing to the awful prices one has to-pay for
every thing nowadays.

The Blue or Tri-coloured Parrot-finch Erythrura tricolor is one
of many species of parrot-finches which inhabit the South-east Asia
and Pacific regions. However, the Blue is found only on Timor in
the Lesser Sunda group, and surrounding islands further east. It
must not be confused with the more widely distributed Blue-faced
Parrot-finch E. trichroa , a species with an entirely different colour
scheme and which appears in many collections.
These little gems are approximately 80 - 100 mm long, with
black bills. They are sexually dimorphic and the males have the
sides of the head and forehead a deep cyan blue with the colour a
lighter shade on the breast and continuing onto the belly. There is
a blue stripe over the median wing coverts, although this is not
consistent in all specimens. Wings and back are rich emerald
green, with red on the rump and short tail. This is in contrast to the
Blue-faced Parrot-finch, which has a pointed tail, in common with
the Pin-tailed Parrot-finch or Nonpareil E. prasina. The female is
essentially the same except that the blue is not as intense and can
be said to be a soft pastel shade of powder blue. The legs and feet
are a dull straw-peach colour.
On the western side of Timor Island, slightly further inland from
the Indonesian town of Kupang where they were collected, the
species is rare and birds were more often heard than actually
sighted. Among sightings there have been many instances of
confusion with the Five-coloured Nun or Munia Lonchura
quinticolor , which also occurs in the same locality. Occasionally
parties of three to eight birds can be seen flying across small
clearings to roost. They are found at a higher altitude in bush
thickets, bamboo and ravine forest.
Perhaps due to their shy nature and rarity, it was difficult to
obtain many birds and according to my personal observations their
breeding season in the wild would be from May - July, as most
juvenile birds are sighted within this period.
In aviculture they are definite rarities in collections and the
numbers exported to Europe and the United States are very few and
far between. To my knowledge, they are among the most expensive
of the Erythrura parrot-finches. Fortunately, the species is repre-

sented in good numbers in my collection and recently a group
consisting of 15.12 Blue Parrot-finches was selected from the total
numbers held in stock and an attempt was made to establish them
in a large aviary in the hope of achieving better breeding results.
Previously, when individual pairs of these birds were housed in
typical finch cages measuring 36 in x 24 in x 18 in high (91 cm. x
61 cm. x 46 cm.), they produced no positive breeding results.
Indeed, when they were removed for a closer examination the
reason quickly became clear. Blue Parrot-finches are extremely
prone to obesity and birds kept in smaller cages, which reduced
opportunities for exercise, would appear a little too robust-looking
and the fatty tissue could be seen as yellow &amp;apos;chunks&amp;apos; around the
neck/crop region, thighs and intestinal surface. Such birds are
unhealthy, despite external appearances, and the chances of breed-
ing from them are virtually nil.
Apart from the total of 27 birds kept for the breeding aviary, the
remainder were too fat to be placed in similar accommodation as an
unrestricted expanse of space would have imposed additional shock
and stress on their systems, ultimately leading to their demise; this
could probably be attributed to heavy damage from excess fat
accumulation. Instead, they were relocated to alternative accom-
modation in indoor lorikeet aviaries where they could get more
exercise in order to slim down gradually.
The breeding aviary was a peculiar &amp;apos;L&amp;apos; shaped structure, 27 ft.
x 18 ft. x 8 ft. high (8.6 m. x 5.7 m. x 2.5 m.), at an adjoining corner
of two separate blocks. Immediate neighbours were pairs of
Rothschild&amp;apos;s Mynahs Leucopsar rothschildi at one end and a men-
acing-looking adult pair of Helmeted Hornbills Rhinoplax vigil , at
the other. Surprisingly, these extremely timid finches appeared
undisturbed by the hornbills and would even perch on the natural
branches of a local Asian shrub, Wrightia religiosa , growing right
next to their common partition!
Due to space constraints, these large hornbills were left in the
adjoining block aviary, which was of similar proportions, and
throughout the entire period, up to the present time, had not caused
any great distress to the finches.
The &amp;apos;L&amp;apos; shaped aviary is heavily planted with shrubs - Hibiscus
spp. and has fern slabs of local orchids Gramatophyllum
slapeliiflorum on the central corner. There is a small clearing in the
middle, facing the protruding &amp;apos;L&amp;apos; section.
Other occupants of this aviary included 1.1.3 Cinnamon Ground
Doves Gallicolumba rufigula , 1.2 Thick-billed Ground Doves Trugon

terrestris , 3.3 Iris Lorikeets Trichoglossus iris 1.1 Mountain Pea-
cock-pheasants Polyplectron inopinatum (which bred at about the
same time as the fledged chicks of the Blue Parrot-finches left the
nest), a number of young Red and Blue Lories Eos histrio which
were bred the previous year and placed in the aviary prior to the
introduction of the Blue Parrot-finches.
Due to their inquisitive and somewhat mischievous nature,
typical of hand-raised lories, all birds of the latter species were
removed as fears arose that they might molest and disrupt the
nesting activities of the Blue Parrot-finches.
A total of eight nest boxes were situated at different points in the
aviary. Wicker finch baskets were not used as the type currently in
use was unsuitable with too large an entrance hole. The boxes used
were standard, horizontal nest boxes 14 in. x 5 l A in. x 3 in. high
(35.5 cm. x 16 cm. x7.5 cm.), with a VA in. (3.7 cm) square entrance
hole, and mass-produced for use with all Opopsitta fig parrots,
Charmosyna and Oreopsittacus lorikeets and smaller members of
the genus Trichoglossus in my collection.
Two of these were nestled among the slabs of orchid plants and
mostly hidden by the leaves, although the opening of one was
visible and could be observed from the exterior. The others were
tucked at various corners, with the ends facing each other, and these
were used regularly by Iris Lorikeets which were very prolific and
produced chicks every season.
There were three separate feeding posts, two located on the
ground and one at about chest-level - for the exclusive use of the
lorikeets - consisting of a cup containing nectar and a small dish of
diced fruit. The diet provided for the Blue Parrot-finches is as
follows: one part each of panicum, Japanese, white and red millets,
a half part of plain canary seed and four parts of paddy (unhusked
rice), together with home-grown grass, wild millet and rice sprays,
which are hung according to availability.
A standard poultry crumble, with unpolished rice, cracked
maize, pulses and beans is provided for the doves and peacock-
pheasants, together with chopped vegetables and ground meat ad-
lib.
Water is available at two different locations - a trough on the
ground and a large cup for bathing on the same level as the lorikeet
feeding post. Fresh water is given twice daily. Vitamins, in the
form of NEKTON T (Nekton Productke - Germany) are added to the
water once a week.

feeding stations, they were free to choose whatever they desired.
Visual observations revealed that, apart from their seeds, they
would sample chicken crumble and beans, especially the sprouts
that appeared from the sides of the water trough, but never touched
meat or the lorikeets&amp;apos; nectar.
Courtship behaviour was observed, with loud twitterings, a
distinctive monosyllabic &amp;apos;tweet&amp;apos;, not infrequently heard in the
field. Apart from these vocalisations, males have been seen and
heard giving a soft, warbling vocalisation, almost inaudible to the
ear, while much chest pouting was observed together with typical
sparrow-like copulation.
All this time some birds would gather chaff, left-over from old
seed sprays, and frequent the box hidden by orchids. Filling the box
with leaves, chaff and feathers, birds were also observed to tear
orchid leaves into small strips to construct an untidy nest. Strange-
ly enough, more than one pair of birds was observed building the
nest.
At night, it was noted that the remainder of the boxes were
utilised for roosting, with a small number of birds, presumably
unpaired, preferring to roost out in the open.
A thorough check revealed that only one box was in use and the
other boxes, although laced with finch droppings, were empty, and
the conclusion was reached that these could not contain any breed-
ing pairs. Throughout this time, active nesting activities continued
and two females were observed to use the box for long periods.
As the orchid plants had now grown completely over the box, it
became impossible to open the observation hatch/door to check on
the occurrences of eggs or chicks. The nest was thus left unmolest-
ed.
Approximately 12-14 days after it was first suspected that eggs
had been laid, the females were observed actively foraging for food
and on occasions males would be seen feeding the females by
regurgitation. Due to the thick planting it was difficult to observe
everything clearly, but it was obvious the finches were feeding
chicks as they started to take an interest in insects and would
remove some of the ant larvae put out for the Mountain Peacock-
pheasant chicks that had also hatched at this time. These peacock-
pheasants are another prized possession and their successful breed-
ing was very encouraging indeed, as their first clutch of two eggs
was removed for artificial incubation and rearing and the clutch
was doubled, the birds replacing the eggs that had been removed
within two weeks.

It was to my very great surprise that after 20 days or so, three
drab-looking Blue Parrot-finch chicks appeared, with an adult
female, sitting in the peacock-pheasants&amp;apos; feeding bowl. They still
had some down adhering to the region of their crown, had no trace
of blue on them and had dull brown-red rumps and tails. They
looked, at this stage, exactly like juvenile Bamboo or Tawny-
breasted Parrot-finches E. hyperythra.
They were most endearing to observe, begging for food from a
single female which picked up scraps of ant larvae to feed them
directly. On one occasion, the two peacock-pheasant chicks, by
now almost three weeks old, were observed feeding side-by-side
with these tiny parrot-finch chicks, together with an anxious female
peacock-pheasant which was more nervous and called her two
chicks under her tail at the slightest disturbance.
Later on, I observed the female parrot-finch feeding regurgitat-
ed seed to the three chicks which always returned to their box at
night to roost. Although there were many other adult Blue Parrot-
finches around and about these three juveniles, no aggression
occurred and at the present time (mid-August, 1993) the youngsters
are three-and-a-half months old and independent of their mother.
Blue Parrot-finches have always been rare in captivity, and
together with other Erythrura parrot-finches, are ever popular with
aviculturists and specialist finch fanciers throughout the world.
Ironically, however, very few papers, have been presented about
parrot-finches in general, despite the large numbers in the hands of
aviculturists - the most common being the Pintailed or Nonpareil
and the Bamboo or Tawny-breasted Parrot-finches, endemic to the
south-east Asia region.
Perhaps others would write about their experiences and success-
es with this beautiful and interesting genus in the near future.
Efforts should also be made by responsible aviculturists to breed
from whatever stock they have in order to preserve these species in
aviculture, and they would apply equally to the more difficult to
breed species.
Because of increasing negative pressures on the live bird trade,
demonstrated by the refusal to carry wild-caught birds by most
international airlines, regardless of the quality or non-endangered
status of the species concerned, it is even more important nowadays
to conserve and preserve stocks presently held by aviculturists.

BREEDING THE WHITE-HEADED (BOHM'S)
BUFFALO WEAVER AND THE TAVETA GOLDEN
WEAVER AT CHESTER ZOO

By Roger Wilkinson and Wayne McLeod
The breeding of White-headed Buffalo Weavers Dinemellia
dinemelli and of Golden Palm Weavers Ploceus bojeri at Chester
Zoo in 1989 was briefly reported in an earlier article in the
Avicultural Magazine (Wilkinson, 1990). A further account of
these breedings was requested and in researching the scientific
literature for the present article it became apparent that the Ploceid
weavers obtained from two different sources as Golden Palm
Weavers Ploceus bojeri in 1988 did not fit the written descriptions
of that species. The birds have now been identified as Taveta
Golden Weavers Ploceus castaneiceps. Close examination of the
males shows that, instead of having the uniformly orange head of
Golden Palm Weavers, they all have yellow faces with chestnut-
orange colour on the nape connecting with a similarly coloured bib
on the upper chest. The females are also streakier than described
for the Golden Palm Weaver which supports their re-identification
as Taveta Golden Weavers (Hall and Moreau, 1970; Mackworth-
Praed and Grant, 1980; Williams and Arlott, 1980) and which was
confirmed by reference to skins at the Liverpool Museum.
This account is limited in detail by the fact that observations of
both species were restricted by their choosing to breed in inacces-
sible areas in the free-flight of our Tropical House. The Tropical
House is a large, high, barn-sized building 240 feet long x 200 feet
wide and 40 feet high, which includes several water areas and
waterfalls and is thickly planted with palms, bananas, figs and
many other tropical plants and flowers. It is heated throughout the
year. Artificial lighting is provided only to a series of aviaries on
an elevated gallery on one side of the house and to the reptile areas
on the opposite lower floor. When opened in 1964 this was the
largest indoor tropical house in the country and although now
showing its age it is still one of our favourite areas of the Zoo.
Around 30 species of birds are housed in the free flight area of this
house including Touracos (previously Schalow&amp;apos;s Touraco Tauraco
schalowi , presently White-cheeked Touraco Tauraco leucotis ),
Celebes Quail Doves Gallicolumba tristigmata, Pink-necked Green
Pigeons Treron vernans , Red-backed Mousebirds Colius castono-

tus and various softbills including Fairy Bluebirds Irena puella,
White-rumped Shamas Copsychus malabaricus , various Tanagers
and a number of species of African Starlings.
With such a variety of birds a large variety of food is offered and
both the Taveta Golden Weavers and the White-headed Buffalo
Weavers take mixed seed and fruit as well as live food. Mixed seed
includes white millet, canary mixture and wheat - the latter being
taken by the larger Buffalo Weaver. The fruit eaten includes
banana, grape, apple and orange. The Taveta Golden Weavers are
particularly fond of feeding from halved oranges. When feeding
young, live food was essential for both species which accepted
locusts, morio worms, mealworms and waxmoth larvae.
White-headed Buffalo Weavers Dinemellia dinemelli were
obtained in 1988 from two sources; four unsexed birds in July and
a further six birds including two sexed pairs in August. These birds
occur in the wild in eastern Africa from Sudan north to Tanzania
and probably arrived in shipments then being sent to the U.K. from
Tanzania. White-headed Buffalo Weavers are striking birds, es-
sentially white with black back, mantle, wings and loral face
patch and orange rump, upper and under tail concerts. When
displaying they raise their wings to display large white patches and
in flight the orange rump is most conspicuous. The black rather
than dusty brown back, mantle and wings and lack of white edging
to the scapulars indicate that these birds belong to the race Dinemellia
dinemelli boehmi sometimes referred to as Bohm&amp;apos;s Buffalo Weaver
(Rutgers and Norris 1977). This fits with their reported origin as
this is the race occurring in Tanzania which was again confirmed
by comparison with museum specimens.
The White-headed Buffalo Weavers are very sociable and ex-
tremely active as they perform wing-raising displays whilst vocal-
ising as they approach one another. A large nest was built in the
crown of a tall palm - too high to be inspected. This was largely
built of lengths of fresh or dry vegetation, especially (much to the
distress of the zoo gardeners) the thorny green froflds of Asparagus
fern Asparagus sprengerii and Asparagus setaceus plumosus. The
preference for these thorny fronds is not unexpected since in the
wild their untidy nests are built from thorny twigs (Mackworth-
Praed and Grant 1980). The communal nest structure measured
several feet across and included three separate nest chambers.
Unfortunately, the White-headed Buffalo Weavers were not all
individually colour-marked and it was not possible to ascertain
which individuals were building and which were entering the next
chambers.

Several nesting attempts were made before the first chick
fledged on 20 October 1989. The fledgling closely resembled the
adults differing only in having darker eyes and a generally duller
paler orange colouring where the adults are reddish orange. A
chick that hatched in early May 1990 did not survive but another
which hatched in October 1990 fledged successfully, The birds
again nested throughout the spring/summer 1991, with chicks being
hatched in April, June , July and August. At least three different
birds were seen queuing near the nest with live food, indicating that
co-operative breeding may be a feature of the social organisation
of these Buffalo Weavers. An extended breeding season has been
previously recorded in the wild with nesting from November to
March. However, at Chester survival has been poor with most
being lost before or shortly after fledging.
Two pairs of Pied Imperial Pigeons Ducula bicolor kept in the
Tropical House began nest building activities in winter 1991/spring
1992. These steal material from the White-headed Buffalo Weaver
nest and no full nest structure has been built by these weavers since
this plundering began. The Pied Imperial Pigeons have so far
thwarted our attempts to catch them up for transfer to another
enclosure.
Taveta Golden Weavers Ploceus castaneiceps were obtained at
the same time from the same sources as the White-headed Buffalo
Weavers and also originate from East Africa. The males are
especially attractive being a bright golden yellow, duller on their
backs, but with a brighter chestnut-orange collar on the nape and
necklace on the upper chest. Unlike many other ploceine weavers
the males have no non-breeding dress and are perennially in full
colour. In contrast the females are rather dull streaky brownish
above and yellowish below. The bills of the females are horn-
coloured with a darker upper mandible whereas those of the males
are all black. Previously little known in aviculture, the Taveta
Golden Weaver is not mentioned by Restall (1975) nor Rutgers and
Norris (1977) although both have individual entries for the sympatric
Golden Palm Weaver Ploceus bojeri and the similar Golden Weav-
er Ploceus subaureus.
Four pairs of Taveta Golden Weavers were obtained in July
1988, a further pair in August and a single male in October. Only
the males build nests often in inaccessible positions at the ends of
Palm fronds, especially those overhanging water areas. Other nests
were built in Rubber Trees Ficus elastica and Weeping Fig Ficus
benjamini , and low down in Umbrella Bog plants Cyperus

alternifolius by the side of one of the water areas. Their preference
for strips of fresh green material which they tear off from the leaves
of living palms again caused some consternation amongst the
gardeners especially as so many nests were started only to be
deserted before completion or rejected by the fussy females. The
first chick was fledged on 31 July 1989 only to drown in the water
below its nest. A later chick which fledged on 13 October survived
without falling into the water. Two chicks fledged from a different
nest in November, although one of these also fell directly into the
water below the nest and was found drowned. This appears strange
for a species which elected to nest in palms above water. However
this is not their normal habit. In the wild Taveta Golden Weavers
build exclusively in swampy vegetation, usually bullrushes, rather
than the palms or bushes used by the ecologically segregated but
sympatric Golden Palm Weaver (Hall and Moreau 1970). Clearly
this preference is not inflexible as shown by the birds at Chester
Zoo nesting in palms and other trees as well as in lower vegetation.
Two more chicks fledged successfully in December 1989. The
chicks resembled the female but were generally darker and more
streaky, altogether more sparrow-like, and had darker bills. Only
the breeding female was seen to carry live food to the nest or to feed
the fledged chicks. The birds bred again in 1990 with a chick
successfully fledged in March, and two more hatched in May
(another of which found its way directly into the water). At that
time the colony consisted of six males and only one female. Since
the loss of that female in 1991 no further breeding has been
possible. Five males continue to weave nests suspending these
from the palm fronds in the false hope of attracting a female. The
observed seasonal scatter of nesting activity with no obviously
defined breeding season may perhaps be expected from a species in
which, unusually for ploceid weavers, the males have no non-
breeding dress. Mackworth-Praed and Grant (1980) give no breed-
ing dates for the Taveta Golden Weaver commenting that notes are
not reliable because of past confusion with similar species. How-
ever, Brown and Britton (1980) report nesting activity in the wild
from October to May.
As reported above the White-headed Buffalo Weaver Dinemel-
lia dinemelli boehmi and the Taveta Golden Weaver Ploceus
castaneiceps were first bred at Chester Zoo in 1989. These are both
believed to be first breeding successes. Anyone knowing of
previous breedings in Great Britain is asked to contact the
Honorary Secretary.

ABSTRACT:
The fertile eggs of four species of Cranes currently or formerly
at the International Crane Foundation (Siberian, Florida Sandhill,
White-naped and Red-crowned) were studied to learn about the
relationship between egg order and egg quality. The sample
included 294 eggs. Indices of egg quality included the hatching
rate, the fledging rate, and the hatching x fledging rate for each egg.
Eggs that were not incubated full-term were not used in the analysis
of hatching or fledging rates and chicks that were euthanised due
to factors not indicative of egg quality were not used in the analysis
of fledging rates. A significant negative relation was found
between egg order and the fledging rate. Hatching rates and
hatching x fledging rates (a measure of overall egg quality) were
not significantly related with egg order. Therefore, inducing
cranes to lay supernumerary eggs does not appear to result in
reduced reproductive potential as the number of eggs laid in a year
increases.

Breeding large numbers of endangered animals is frequently
desirable in captive breeding programmes. Zoos have increased the
productivity of captive cranes by removing the eggs, termed &amp;quot;mul-
tiple clutching&amp;quot; (Koga 1961). Although the effects of multiple
clutching on egg size have been studied (Putnam and Russman
unpublished), no study has examined the effects of this technique
on egg quality of cranes. If multiple clutching results in diminish-
ing returns of fledged chicks per egg laid as the number of eggs laid
in the season increases, then inducing females to lay eggs past a
certain point may not be advisable. However, this possible reduc-
tion in fledged chicks should be weighed against the potential
lifetime total of chicks for each female. If a female produces an
overall high number of chicks, this is good for conservation. I
examined the effects of multiple clutching on egg quality as

<bodyText confidence="0.995904444444444" page_id="56230601"  page_num="30" year="" vol="">
Egg data were taken from the following individuals of four
species of captive cranes at the International Crane Foundation: 3
Siberian Grus leucogeranus , 5 Florida Sandhill Grus canadensis
pratensis , 4 White-naped Grus vipio , and 2 Red-crowned Grus
japonensis. Egg data from 1979 to 1992 were collected. All fertile
eggs were included in the hatching analysis except those eggs we
chose not to hatch for management reasons or those eggs that were
sent away. Eggs that are sent to other programmes are sometimes
subjected to conditions that affect the hatching rate. In addition,
chicks that are euthanised for reasons not relating to the quality of
the egg were not included in fledging data. Statistical analyses
including Pearson&amp;apos;s product-moment correlation matrix (Pearson),
ANOVA, and linear regression were performed on egg order vs.
hatch rate, egg order vs. fledge rate, and egg order vs hatch x fledge
rate. Hatch rate is percentage of eggs hatched. Fledge rate is
percentage of chicks fledged. Hatch x fledge rate is a simple
product of the two and is an overall indicator of egg quality. Systat
version 5.03 was used for all statistical analyses.

DISCUSSION:
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.983199483870968" page_id="56230606"  page_num="31" year="" vol="">
In multiple clutching, the order in which eggs are laid may have
a variety of effects on egg characteristics. Research has been
completed which examines the relationship between egg order and
the sex of Canada Greese Branta canadensis (LeBlanc 1987b). No
correlation was found. In another study, LeBlanc (1987a) deter-
mined that egg order had no short-term implicaions for the fitness
of the chick produced as measured by hatching and fledging
success. Research on the Black Brant Branta bernicla nigricans
suggests that egg size decreases with position in the laying se-
quence (Flint and Sedinger 1992). Friedl (1993) reviewed the
literature on intraclutch egg-mass variation in geese (the last egg
is usually the lightest one in the clutch) and its influence on brood
reduction in precocial birds, a possibily adaptive parental strategy.
Ankney (1982) found that in 4 - egg clutches of Lesser Snow Geese
Anser c. caerulescens the first 2 eggs laid produced mostly males
(64%) and the last 2 produced mostly females (72%). Putnam and
Russman (unpublished) discuss potential consequences of multi-
ple-clutching in captive Cranes. Some possible deleterious conse-
quences cited are: increased intervals between successive eggs in
a season (9% of birds studied), seasonal decline in egg weight (21%
of birds), stretching of the oviduct (1 bird), and later initiation of
laying (1 bird). Despite the effects of multiple-clutching noted,
such as the decrease in egg weight, my study lends credence to the
theory that multiple-clutching does not adversely affect egg qual-
ity. Later eggs are sufficiently valuable; multiple-clutching in
order to produce an optimum amount of chicks appears to be
justifiable. In conclusion, egg order is an entity with diverse
ramifications in breeding biology; it is important in terms of further
comprehension of wild species and in its ramificaitons upon cap-
tive breeding of endangered avian species.

The Emerald Starling Coccycolius iris is found in West Africa
from Guinea to the Ivory Coast. It is, without doubt, an extremely
beautiful bird with its eye-catching iridescent plumage and viewed
in sunlight it appears a very different bird to the one seen on a damp
or wet day. Colour plates of the species can be found in Mackworth-
Praed and Grant, Bannerman and the^vz cultural Magazine. One of
the best photographs of the species appears on page 91 of Walsrode
Park&amp;apos;s guide book.
This is a small, bright green starling. The upper surfaces are
entirely metallic green, with the ear coverts and neck patch purple.
Chin to breast is metallic green with a border of metallic blue; the
rest of the underparts are purple with the centre of the belly
unglosed and blackish. The eye is dark brown, the bill, legs and feet
black. Sexes are alike, size IV 2 - 9 in. (19 - 21 cm.).
In the Avicultural Magazine 1955, 61, 6; 267 - November/
December, John Yealland described the Emerald Starling and there
is a colour plate by David M. Henry painted from examples brought
back in 1954 by the joint BBC and Zoological Society of London
expedition to Sierrra Leone when 26 specimens were collected,
mostly birds in immature plumage. Those depicted in the colour
plate are in adult plumage.
Some of these birds went to Foxwarren Park, home of the then
President of the Avicultural Society, Alfred Ezra OBE and father
of the Society&amp;apos;s current President. This is the first reference I can
find of the bird in aviculture. Raymond Sawyer had at least one of
these birds which he showed at the National Exhibition of Cage
Birds, Alexandra Palace, London in December, 1975.
Emerald Starlings were imported by Ponderosa Bird Aviaries in
1979. Gordon Cooke, a well known importer, also offered some for
sale but said he found them very difficult to establish. Soon a
number of aviculturists had added these beautiful starlings to their
collections. Among them, several birds found their way to the joint
collection of Ruth Ezra and Raymond Sawyer at Cobham, and in
1980 young were reared there. This was propably a world first and
on various occasions since, the species has again bred in that
collection.
The only other known &amp;apos;successful&amp;apos; breeding in great Britain was

achieved by Will Harrison at Wem (Shropshire). A single bird left
the nest and became self-supporting but failed to moult into adult
plumage. The Foreign Bird Federation&amp;apos;s Register of Birds Bred in
the UK Under Controlled Conditions from 1985 to 1991 has no
records of any breedings.
Malcolm Ellis, Avicultural Magazine 1980, 86, 2; 112 makes a
brief mention of the Emerald Starlings kept at London Zoo. They
often carried green privet leaves which they sometimes took into
the various nestboxes provided. In the United States, two young
were bred at Philadelphia Zoo, Avicultural Magazine 1982, 88,
1; 5 8.
I have kept six birds of the species over a 10 year period. The
first pair was bought on 29 December 1982 and had been viewed
previously. They were quite wild when kept in a cage but after
being wintered indoors they were transferred to an outdoor aviary
measuring 8 ft. long x 2Vi ft. wide and 6 ft. high (2.5 m x 75 cm x
2.1m), with an access to a feeding cage, measuring 2 ft. x 2 l A ft. x
3 ft. high (161 cm x 776 cm x 91 cm), indoors in a birdroom. Part
of their daily diet - Orlux softbill food (with Claus added occasion-
ally) and mealworms - was given in this indoor section. Outside on
spikes were halved pears, apples or orange, plus a dish of sliced
fruit including grapes. Ant pupae were offered but not taken. This
pair hatched a single chick in 1986 which lived for less than three
days.
Another bird was purchased in May, 1989 but died a few months
later. A further pair was obtained in December of that year, and
another single bird was acquired in July, 1990. By Christmas, 1991
three birds remained. All had been split rung for ease of identifi-
cation - only for one of them to lose its ring. In February, 1992, a
bird was found dead, badly pecked around the head. Was I,
perhaps, left with a pair coming into breeding condition?
The aviary had been extended at Easter, 1991 into a single flight
10 ft. x 8 ft. x 6 ft. high (3 m. x 2.5m x 2. lm) utilising three smaller
aviaries. Other occupants were three cock and two hen Red-headed
Finches Amadia erythrocephala , a pair of Silver-eared Mesias
Leiothrix argentauris , a hen Amethyst Starling (on loan), a one-
eyed Black-headed Sibia Heterophasia capistrata and numerous
Diamond Doves Geopelia cuneata - reduced to two pairs on 15th
March at which time one of the cock Red-headed Finches was also
removed as the others had paired. The adjoining flight housed a
pair of Red-tailed Laughing Thrushes Garrulax milnei.
The remaining Emerald Starlings consisted of a cock bought in

July, 1990 and a hen purchased in December, 1989. Two nest boxes
were available (as had been the case in 1991); one was a hollowed-
out log aproximately 12 in. x 15 in. high (30 cm x 38 cm.), fixed to
a pole 2 ft. 6 in. (76 cm.) off the ground, with a man-made wooden
lid and a 2 in. (5 cm.) entrance hole. The chosen box was 15 in. x
10 in. x 10 in.(38cm. x 25 cm. x 25 cm.), hung at an angle of 45 0
and made of 1 in. (2.5 cm.) rough-cut timber. It was fixed to a 2 l A
in. x 1 in. (6 cm. x 2.5 cm) piece of timber that formed part of the
aviary frame. The entrance hole was 2 in. (5 cm) in diameter and
4 ft. 9 in. (1.45 m.) from the aviary floor, facing westwards. The
box was 4 ft. 6 in. (1.4 m.) from the front of the aviary with a
flowering currant bush between.
During March both birds were observed carrying grass, coconut
fibre and green shoots from the flowering currant into the nest box.
Although timid and shy, they appeared to be sitting and on 27th
March when both were off the nest, inspection revealed two eggs.
Two days later, three eggs were in the box. They were typical of
starlings - light blue with red/brown blotching.
On 6th April what appeared to be two newly hatched chicks were
in the box. I had obtained a supply of mini mealworms and these
were dusted with a vitamin supplement (SA37) before being fed.
The following day a broken eggshell on the aviary floor provided
evidence that the third egg had hatched. The egg shell looked quite
pointed.
Regular checks were made as the nestlings grew and the Black-
headed Sibia was removed on 12th April to reduce competition for
live food. I handled the three chicks on 23rd April to see if all was
progressing correctly. Their legs appeared sound and they were
well fed.
On 27th April, all three youngsters were out of the nest by late
afternoon when I returned home from work. They were smaller and
paler editions of their parents with underparts that were more
brown than purple. The green areas of their plumage developed
fairly quickly and by Christmas it was similar to that of the adults.
By the end of March, 1993 one juvenile had assumed virtual adult
plumage and by June all three were identical to their parents.
At about the time they were expected to fledge, water dishes had
been partly emptied as a precaution in case the youngsters fell into
them. On the night in question it rained. The birds seemed likely
to roost in a Jasmine bush so a couple of pieces of glass were put
on the top of the aviary to provide some measure of protection and
all was well the following morning. Although they could fly, the

youngsters preferred to remain in the bush and clamber around,
calling to be fed by their parents.
The fledglings survived a torrential downpour during early May
and the following day split rings were put on, providing another
opportunity to handle them and confirm that they appeared to be
developing well. The weather was generally fine for the rest of the
month except for a spectacular thunderstorm during the evening of
23rd May which, in the event, caused the birds no problems.
While they were in the nest, regular supplies of mealworms were
provided - up to six times a day if my father was available to help
while I was at work. The young starlings took to their parents&amp;apos; diet
(which in 1992 was Orlux insectivorous mixture together with
chopped grapes, apples, pears and bananas, plus spiked fruit and
mealworms) without problem. Waxmoth larvae were provided
from time to time, as were ant pupae when available, together with
such insects as the adults were able to capture themselves. Fresh
water was given every other day.
I have often wondered how intelligent Emerald Starlings are
compared to other members of the family and they certainly appear
more timid than, say. Purple Glossy Starlings. They appear to
display a lack of intelligence when compared with, for example, my
pair of Meve&amp;apos;s Starlings Lamprotornis mevesii. However, when the
adult Emerald Starlings were feeding young in the nest they would
closely observe what I was doing in the vicinity, so that when I was
out of sight one or both birds were return to the nest immediately.
Other aviculturists have commented that both Emerald and
Amethyst Starlings Cinnyricinclus leucogaster are generally not as
intelligent as Glossy Starlings Lamprotornis .
In late February 1993, while we were experiencing a spell of
mild weather, the youngsters were separated from their parents and
housed in an aviary opposite. It was an action which seemed to
galvanise the adult pair into breeding behaviour again. On this
occasion they chose the log rather than the previously used box.
Three eggs were laid and incubated (incubation was estimated at 13
-15 days), and all three hatched. Unfortunately the nestlings failed
to survive beyond five days - perhaps because I failed to send off
an order for mini mealworms quickly enough. All the adults had to
feed their brood were regular-sized mealworms and even though
they were cut up they were still on the large side.
This was a disappointing outcome - but better things were to
follow and a further two chicks were successfully reared later last
year. At the time of writing these notes (September, 1993) the

youngsters are starting to show colour in much the same way as did
the 1992 brood.
I suspected the Emerald Starling found dead, and injured around
the head, in 1992 was almost certainly attacked by its own kind.
Raymond Sawyer, who has considerble experience with the spe-
cies, has experienced aggression from time to time, especially
around breeding time. Obviously my flight is small leaving little
opportunity for birds to get away from each other.
At present, Emerald Starlings are still available from UK im-
porters - and at prices that are quite reasonable. If you have
admired this species it would be well worthwhile adding them to
your collection while the opportunity is there.

The Blue-crowned Racket-tailed Parrot Prioniturus discurus is
one of several species belonging to the genus Prioniturus, none of
which could be described as widely known and certainly not
aviculturally established at the present time. The Research and
Breeding Centre operated by B.I.I. in the Philippines specialises in
the captive management and breeding of Philippine, Indonesian,
New Guinea and South-east Asian endemic Psittacines.
The ability to work with these birds within their own natural
range and climatic conditions, aided by the use of natural food
items provided as part of a balanced diet, has meant that several
species of Psittacines, formerly regarded as being not adaptable to
captive conditions, have now become captively established at the
centre. Species of the Prioniturus genus are among those with
which success has now been achieved here.
The Blue-crowned Racket-tailed Parrot is perhaps now the best
known species of its genus. Although not widely known in the past,
it has recently become aviculturally established. From the main
captive population base formed at the centre, it has already been
possible to allow some captive-bred birds to go to avicultural
collections in Europe.
Plumage of birds of the species is predominately green, becom-
ing more yellowish on the underbody. The other significant colour
is the blue on top of the head which gives the species its common
name. The bill is white in adult birds, dull grey in newly-fledged
youngsters. The feet are grey and the toe nails dark grey to black.
The most noticeable feature of this and other Prioniturus species is
the presence of elongated tail shafts which have spatules at their
tips.
Several pairs have become established and are now regularly
reproduced at the B.T.I. Centre and with clutches commonly
resulting in four, occasionally five, chicks, the reproductive poten-
tial of these birds is good. Once problems associated with the
captive husbandry of Prioniturus species had been realised and
provided for, success followed. To begin with, a majority of the

eggs produced were removed from nest-boxes for artificial incuba-
tion and hand-rearing.
In 1992, 22 birds were artificially hatched and successfully
reared in the centre&amp;apos;s nursery department. Currently, more empha-
sis is being placed on perfecting husbandry guidelines to allow for
successful parent rearing, which has also now been achieved here.
This article describes the experiences we have gained from hand-
rearing young birds of the species. A full report describing the
research which has resulted in the centre&amp;apos;s current successful
husbandry practices is also in preparation and will be available
shortly.

INCUBATION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999686466666666" page_id="56230616"  page_num="41" year="" vol="">
Eggs have previously been removed from the nest-boxes of
parent birds only after a period of natural incubation, normally of
at least 14 days. This has resulted in an extremely high percentage
of successful hatches. The species&amp;apos; incubation period is currently
considered to be 24 days. To date, only a limited amount of work
has been undertaken with fresh eggs so a definitive artificial
incubation husbandry guide cannot currently be provided. With
eggs removed from the nest after a period of initial natural incuba-
tion, incubation husbandry is undertaken as follows.
Temperature: incubation temperatures of 37.2* to 37.4*C. have
been used to incubate the eggs of this Prioniturus species with a
high level of hatchability, provided the exact temperature used
remains constant throughout the incubation period.
Humidity: a reading on the wet bulb thermometer of 26.7* to
27.8* C. is used with few weight loss problems being encountered
with eggs removed from the nest-box after a period of natural
incubation (27.8*C. is equal to a relative humidity reading of 53%).
Turning: during incubation the eggs are turned by hand at least
seven times during a 24 hour period. The eggs are rotated 180
degrees, always in alternating directions at each turning period. To
date this has proved successful as the eggs have generally achieved
a percentage vein growth within the available albumen space of
between 70 - 100% by the time they have been removed from the
nest-box. Artificial incubation of freshly-laid eggs may well prove
to require more detailed attention with regard to turning husbandry
in order to achieve a similarly high level of success.
Hatching: to date, hatching has proved relatively uneventful
with few specific problems encountered. The period from internal
pipping to eventual emergence from the shell has, in nearly all
cases, been 48 hours or less. Percentage hatchability has been

extremely high and assistance to eggs in the hatching process has
not been required to date. Eggs are transferred from the incubator
to the hatcher once they have clearly internally pipped and are
active within the air cell, or once external pip has been achieved.
Environmental conditions of the hatcher are an internal tempera-
ture of 36.9*C. and a humidity reading on the wet bulb of 32.2*C.
or above (equal to a relative humidity of 71%). Once internal pip
has been achieved the egg should no longer be turned.

HAND-REARING METHOD
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998078424242424" page_id="56230617"  page_num="42" year="" vol="">
On removal from the hatcher, the chicks are transferred to a pre-
prepared brooder unit. The initial temperature of the brooder is
maintained at 36.6*C. During the early stages of its rearing period,
the chick is placed inside a small plastic tub which is lined with
paper towelling. This provides support to help the newly-hatched
chick maintain an upright body position and the use of paper
towelling also allows for easy examination of the chick&amp;apos;s faeces.
The brooder temperature is slowly lowered as the chick becomes
larger and stronger. Once it has outgrown its plastic container and
has control over its body posture and movement, it is allowed more
freedom by being transferred to the more spacious accommodation
of a cage. The chick is now kept upon segments of cotton cloth
which are replaced and sterilised frequently (in the Philippines&amp;apos; hot
and humid tropical climate, this proves the easiest substrate to
sterilise and frequently replace). Sterilised perches are provided
within the rearing cage as soon as the chick becomes more mobile
and shows a willingness to attempt climbing.
The diet used at the centre to feed these chicks is based on two
formulas. The first is an easy to digest mixture which is fed to the
chicks from day two to day 10. The second formula, which is the
main basis of the rearing diet, is introduced with the first formula
from day five, and then gradually replaces it by day 10. For the first
day only, Lactated Ringers Solution with Volamin is fed.
This formula is prepared and fed to the chicks at a temperature
of 40* to 42*C. throughout their rearing period. Evenness of
temperature throughout the food is ensured by stirring the formula,
using a thermometer, prior to the commencement of feeding. One
of the most noticeable features of chicks of this species is their very
small crop capacity when newly hatched - usually a maximum of
0.2 ml. This means that chicks being reared from day one have to
be fed throughout the night as well as during daylight hours. At the
centre, newly hatched chicks receive additional night-time feeding
at 1.00 am and 4.00 am, as well as being fed every two hours

Often, if the chicks are not receiving sufficient food during the
night time period, they can become hyper-active while calling for
food during the early hours of the morning and the constant rubbing
of feet by such energetic chicks can lead to tiny blood spots which
can be detected on the substrate medium on close examination. The
presence of such spots is a sign that the chicks are being left without
food for an unsuitably long period during the night.
The type of feeding implement normally used is a syringe. The
number of feeds given daily and the quantity of food given at each
feed depends on the development of individual chick, but the
following guide lines provide a basis to work from:
From day 30 until day 60, the amount of food is increased slowly
until the maximum crop capacity - which for P. discurus is 12 ml.
- is eventually reached. The chick will continue to receive four to
five feeds daily, even as weaning begins. The chick will begin to
refuse food as it begins weaning and this will prove to be the best
guide to when to reduce hand-feeding. Weaning food in the form
of fruits, millet sprays and Fruitivore pellets is provided once
weaning has been initiated.

Birds which have spent the early part of their rearing period in
the nest-box, receiving care from their natural parents before being
removed for artificial rearing, seem to wean faster than those
chicks which were incubator hatched. The earliest weaning time
recorded at the centre was 85 days in the case of a chick which was
reared by its parents for 21 days before being transferred to the
nursery department for hand-rearing.
Chicks which are hand-reared from day one take between 90 -
130 days to wean completely. Weaning of P. diScurus can be
considered comparatively straightforward, with few specific prob-
lems being encountered with this species. Chicks are still hand-fed
up to the time they refuse such hand-feeding. In many respects their
husbandry during weaning is reminiscent of Loriidae.

The following notes were made on the physical development of
an incubator-hatched chick, the oldest of a clutch of four removed
from the nest-box as eggs and subsequently hand-reared in early
1993.
&amp;apos;Newly-hatched - skin pigmentation is light pink. Dense, long
white down covers most of the upper body including the head,
wings and thighs. Down is also present on the underbody, but
spread more thinly. Bill is pinkish-white with a very small egg
tooth visible. Toe nails are white. Eyes are enclosed at hatching
but are already noticeably prominent in their size. Chick is very
vocal. Noticeably small crop capacity, only 0.2 ml. Very active,
continually moving.
&amp;apos;Day 2 - little physical change but the chick has become more
settled in its behaviour.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.6134125" page_id="56230619"  page_num="44" year="" vol="">

&amp;apos;Day 11 - eyes are opening.
&amp;apos;Day 13 - eyes fully open, chick very active. Toe nails are now
grey.
&amp;apos;Day 20 - pins that can be seen forming under the skin are

becoming more widespread over the body, but are not yet breaking
through the skin. Flight feather pins just beginning to appear on the
wings.
&amp;apos;Day 23 - flight feather pins now well emerged. Smaller pins
also now starting to break through the skin on the wing and
elsewhere on the body.
&amp;apos;Day 25 - pins are now emerged over much of the upper wings.
Toe nails have now become black.
&amp;apos;Day 27 - most of the upper wings covered by long pins. Pins also
now appearing on the tail and thigh.
&amp;apos;Day 30 - flight pins are now more than 1cm in length. Bill is
white but the base is becoming darker.
&amp;apos;Day 32 - flight feathers are starting to break through their
quilling.
&amp;apos;Day 34 - feathers on the head, thighs, tail and chest are all
starting to break through their quilling. Even pins on crop. Bill
colour is becoming slightly darker.
&amp;apos;Day 37 - feathers emerging from quilling on the head, legs and
more extensively on the chest. All flight feathers are now emerged
from their quilling. Bill has become greyish-white in colour.
&amp;apos;Day 41 - green feathering has now emerged over most of body,
except for the upper flanks. Wing feathering is near complete.
&amp;apos;Day 44 - chick is now regularly using the perching provided for
it to rest on. Chest and wings are now completely feathered, rest
of body is nearing complete feathering except for the upper flanks
which are just beginning to become feathered.
&amp;apos;Day 53 - blue coloration in the plumage of the crown is
becoming brighter and more noticeable. Rackets are also now
noticeable on the elongated tail shafts. Flank areas becoming well
feathered.
&amp;apos;Day 60 - complete feathering. Bill is still greyish-white,
indicating immaturity. Also, the iris are dark. Otherwise the chick
now resembles an adult bird.'
The normal method of monitoring the physical development of
the chick, other than by direct observation, is to monitor the daily
pattern of weight gained over each 24-hour (one day) period. Of the
22 chicks hand-reared at the centre during 1992, the weight gain
records of 10 birds were selected to be averaged in an attempt to

provide a relatively accurate guide to the weight gain pattern for
this species.
The 10 chicks which made up the sample group were selected as
having had an uneventful rearing period with no problems which
might alter the eventual average figure calculated. As with any
species, the Blue-crowned Racket-tailed Parrot is subject to vari-
ance in individual birds&amp;apos; hatching weights and daily weight gain
patterns. Because of natural individual variance, in addition to the
averaged figure of weight gain, a further guide in the form of a
range of variance is provided to show the greatest and least weights
recorded among the sample group of chicks on each stated day.

parent-rearing of the species. The ability to hand-rear is, however,
not only necessary on occasions but also provides the opportunity
to greatly increase the productiveness of specific pairs which is
desirable when an aviculturist may be working with a limited
number of blood lines. The species has shown itself capable of
double clutching and producing up to four, very occasionally five,
chicks per clutch.
A more detailed husbandry guide for incubation may be re-
searched in the future, but currently nearly all eggs that have been
worked with have been partially incubated naturally, under the
parents, prior to their transfer to the incubation room.
Hand-rearing can be successfully achieved so long as proper
consideration is given to providing additional night-time feeding,
as well as the normal 6.00 am - midnight schedule common for most
other Psittacines. Failure to provide adequate night feeding will
result in nutritional problems and physically poor condition chicks
being produced.
The need to establish species of Prioniturus in captivity must be
clear to anyone familiar with the conservation management of
species. Although spread over a comparatively wide distribution,
much of the natural range of the species is disappearing at an
increasing rate. Populations are becoming isolated from each other
and are increasingly disturbed by a growing human population.
Now that the Blue-crowned Racket-tailed Parrot has become estab-
lished in an initial captive population, and is reproducing freely, it
will be up to aviculturists around the world to establish a self-
sustaining population of the species that will ensure its continued
existence for many generations to come.

neonatal care or products mentioned in the text are invited and

CONSERVING THE RED-VENTED COCKATOO
</sectionHeader>

The Philippine or Red-vented Cockatoo Cacatua haematuropygia
is now among the 20 or so most critically endangered parrots in the
world. Once widespread throughout the islands of the Philippines,
not until two or three years ago was it realised that this distinctive
cockatoo had suffered a massive population decline as a result of
deforestation and trapping. Between the 1930s and the 1980s, 80%
of the forests were destroyed - and the destruction continues. Now
the cockatoo is known to survive only on the island of Palawan.
This cockatoo has never been common in aviculture. Export of
wild-caught birds has not been permitted since it was placed on
Appendix 1 of CITES over a year ago. When it was exported
mortality in recently trapped birds was high. Unfortunately,
females were always in the minority and the number of breeding
pairs in existence is very few.
The first step towards preserving this species in aviculture was
taken last year with the formation of an EEP (European breeding
programme). Everyone who keeps this species (even only a single
bird) is urged to contact the co-ordinator of this EEP, Marc
Boussekey, Espace Zoologique, St. Martin-La-Plaine, 42800 Rive-
de-Gier, France. Recording the location of as many birds as
possible is now very important.
This breeding effort has been linked with a conservation pro-
gramme for this species in the wild. An agreement was signed
recently between Espace Zoologique and the government of the
Philippines. The zoo funded and produced a poster in English and
in two Philippine languages for distribution throughout the islands.
It emphasises that the cockatoo must be protected. Prints of the
poster artwork, beautifully depicting a small flock in the wild, are
available in a limited edition of 200. The price is 100FF each
(about #12.50 plus postage and packing) payable to Association
Zoologique at the above address. All profits from the sale of this
print will go directly to the conservation of the Red-vented Cocka-
too.

By Michael Macek and Bruce Bohmke (St. Louis Zoo.)
Mousebirds represent the order Coliiformes , the only order of
birds endemic to Africa (Fry, 1988). According to Fry (1988) this
order is comprised of two genera, Colius (four species) and Urocolius
(two species). All six species have been kept and bred in captivity,
mostly those of the genus Colius but few have bred consistently.
The following observations are of the Red-faced Mousebird
Urocolius indicus.
The St. Louis Zoo acquired six wild-caught Red-faced
Mousebirds in December 1985. The birds were placed in a large
open flight aviary where Speckled Mousebirds Colius striatus have
bred successfully. The aviary measures approximately 9 m x 6 m
x 6 m, is well planted and receives natural light. By 1988 only one
pair remained which bred for the first time in May of that year.
Their first nesting resulted in two chicks but their subsequent
breeding attempts were unsuccessful until 1990 when they were
moved to a smaller aviary.
The birds are offered a mixture of chopped fruit (apple, orange,
banana, grape), diced canned vegetables (corn, black-eyed peas,
carrots, and beets), Apple Jungle Pellets (Marion Zoological Inc.),
and insects (crickets, waxworms, and mealworms). Colour is
maintained by the use of a 10% canthaxanthin solution (Quintrex)
mixed with the food. Food and water are offered once a day unless
young are being reared when a fresh food supply is provided in the
afternoon. The birds feed from an elevated platform but willingly
come to the ground if a platform is not provided.
The smaller enclosure measures 3 m x 3 m x 3.7 m. It also
receives natural light. This aviary has a piano wire front of which
the wires are spaced 1.25 cm apart. Live plants, branches, and
honeysuckle vines, in which the birds spend most of their time
climbing around, are provided. Small woven baskets (12.7 cm
diameter) are normally used for nests although the birds have also
built their own from fine grasses and wool. The mousebirds have
sometimes shared their aviary with a single Barbary Shrike Laniarius
barbarus or a Brown-breasted Barbet Lybius melanopterus both of
which were aggressive and were removed. A pair of Cape Thick-
knees Burhinus capensis now share the aviary with them and as

ground birds present no threat.
Fry (1988) reported seasonal nesting with peaks in late summer
and early autumn. In captivity nests have been recorded in every
month. Eggs are usually laid 48 hours after the female commences
sitting in the nest and chicks have been found 15 days later. Hence,
the incubation period is somewhere between 12 and 14 days. This
agrees with Fry (1988) and observations of the Blue-faced
Mousebird Urocolius macrourus by Gibson (1979). Clutch size
averages 1.76 eggs (1 - 3 eggs, 26 clutches). Fry (1988) found wild
clutches averaged 2.55 eggs (1-7 eggs, 80 clutches). It has been
suggested that mousebirds are co-operative and sometimes commu-
nal breeders (Fry, 1988) and therefore these large clutches may be
the result of more than one female laying in the same nest. Only one
reproductive pair has been housed in the same aviary at the St.
Louis Zoo. Eggs of Colius species are uniformly white (Fry, 1988;
Grant, 1962) but the two species of Urocolius produce white eggs
with spots and scrawls of reddish brown.
Both the male and the female and sometimes a helper (a juvenile
from a previous clutch) incubate the eggs. However, the female
does most of the incubation. When a helper incubates it always sits
beside one of the adults. The eggs are often left unattended for brief
periods when the female leaves the nest to feed. The male has never
been observed feeding the female on the nest as was the Blue-naped
Mousebird by Gibson (1979). Unsuccessful nests are always
abandoned after 15 days incubation although Berman (1985) re-
ported Speckled Mousebirds incubating for as long as 22 days
before abandoning the nest.
Normally one or two young hatch (of 16 nests, six resulted in two
chicks and 10 resulted in one. The chicks are fed by both parents.
The juvenile helpers defend the nest and brood the chicks but have
never been observed feeding them. Chicks leave the nest when they
are 10 - 14 days old. They return to the nest frequently for the first
day or two but by the fourteenth day are fully fledged. The female
often returns to the nest and begins laying another clutch within 48
hours of the chicks fledging. The chicks are then fed by the non-
incubating adult but soon begin picking up food on their own.
Because of their co-operative nesting habits, the chicks are left
with the adults until at least one subsequent clutch has been reared.
This period can range from 8 weeks to almost 6 months. The
carrying capacity of the aviary seems to be approximately six birds
as reproduction has decreased or stopped altogether when this
number has been exceeded for a while.

In 1991 a second pair of mousebirds were housed in an off-
exhibit enclosure which measured approximately 1.5mx 1 mx lm
and was suspended 1.2 m from the floor. Visual barriers were
placed on two sides of the cage as the birds appeared more easily
disturbed in this smaller aviary. The pair consisted of a2&amp;apos;/ 2 year old
male from the original pair and a 3 year old female from Miller Park
Zoo, Bloomington. Three chicks were reared by this pair. To date
the St. Louis Zoo has produced 24 Red-faced Mousebirds.
Mousebirds are unique. They are relatively hardy and will breed
in a variety of exhibit types. They can be kept in groups the number
in which depends on the size of the exhibit. Although they compete
with some perching birds for space they will co-habit with ground
species. All six species are currently kept in captivity. Recent ISIS
abstracts report none being maintained in sufficient numbers to
support a long-term population, with the possible exception of the
Speckled Mousebird, and the genetic viability of this population is
uncertain. If this order of birds is to be maintained in captivity it
may be necessary to concentrate on one species giving particular
attention to its genetic management.

Although the Pheasant Pigeon Otidiphaps nobilis has been
represented in the collection at Birdpark Avifauna (Alphen aan den
Rijn) for 12 years, it was only in 1993 that these striking-looking
birds were bred there. Purple-tailed Fruit Pigeons Ducula rufigaster
and Black-chinned Fruit Doves Ptilinopus lechlancheri also reared
young.
Scarlet Ibis Eudocimus ruber enjoyed a successful breeding
season and by mid-September 33 young had been hatched, while
five Straw-necked Ibis Carphibis spinicollis were also hatched.
Other species to breed in the park during 1993 included Sams Crane
Grus antigone. East African Crowned Crane Balearica regulorum
gibbericeps , Chilean Flamingo Phoenicopterus chilensis and Afri-
can Spoonbill Platalea alba.
In the park&amp;apos;s Tropical House, White-collared Kingfishers Hal-
cyon chloris laid a second clutch of eggs but only one hatched. A
single Violet-backed Starling Cinnyricinclus leucogaster also
fledged.

the nest on 13th and 16th August, respectively. Curator of Birds,
David Rimlinger feels the success was partly the result of removing
the cock from the pair&amp;apos;s enclosure as soon as the hen laid her eggs
- thus creating a less stressful environment. The eggs were incu-
bated for 17 days in a domed nest made of palm fibres, Spanish moss

LAMMERGEIER PROJECT

The Lammergeier Gypaetus barbatus meridionalis is sparsely
distributed throughout Kenya, with a maximum of about 20 - 30
pairs. The best known and most easily observed pair used to nest
on the main rock-face in what is now Hell&amp;apos;s Gate National Park,
eight miles south-east of Lake Naivasha. However, breeding there
ceased in 1975 and in 1983 the pair disappeared, probably driven
away by the substantial amount of human activity close to the nest
site.
Now, Simon Thomsett hopes to stop rock climbing and similar
pursuits in the immediate vicinity - as well as perhaps enlarging the
nest ledge and hacking back some young Lammergeiers, possibly
in the next two years. First, though, he must overcome opposition.
He has been asked either to relocate the proposed nest site or allow
climbing to continue on the rock-face. Rightly, no doubt, he feels
that such activities should themselves be moved elsewhere if his
plan is to succeed.
Simon has undertaken rescue work with other birds of prey,
including completing recently a similar programme with the rare

Plans have been made to plant 20,000 - 30,000 licuri palm trees
in Bahia, eastern Brazil. The nuts of the licuri palm are the main
food of the rare and endangered Lear&amp;apos;s Macaw Anodorhynchus
ieari , of which just some 65 or so are known to be living in the wild
in thorny scrubland in the Brazilian state of Bahia. The macaws
have to fly considerable distances to their feeding grounds where
each bird is reckoned to eat about 350 nuts each day.
As land is cleared for cattle, the palms often are left standing -
but only so their dry leaves can be used as fodder during the long
dry season. Not surprisingly, the continual loss of leaves causes the
palms to deteriorate and some die. In areas where goats range, few
seedlings and young palms manage to regenerate. Forced to forage
even further afield, the macaws may even descend to the ground in
search of food. They become increasingly easy targets for hunters,
who may shoot them for food or try to capture them.
For a donation of #10 (US $20) sent to &amp;apos;A Palm for a Parrot&amp;apos;, The
World Parrot Trust, Glanmor House,. Hayle, Cornwall, TR27 4HY,
England, the donor will receive an inscribed certificate suitable for
framing. The story of Lear&amp;apos;s Macaw and its struggle to survive is
described on the back of the certificate.

VISITS TO MEMBERS' COLLECTIONS

After a positive start, visits to members' collections have
failed to attract much support. A visit to Flimwell Bird Park last
year was initially of interest to nine members - but on the day, not
one turned up.
This was both upsetting and disappointing for Dr. and Mrs.
Player who had gone to considerable trouble to arrange tea and to
organise a good day for the Avicultural Society.
Can we therefore ask members, if they take a ticket for one of
these visits and subsequently find they are unable to attend,
please advise their host to that effect. The Society is entirely
dependent on the generosity of members who are willing to open
their collections to fellow enthusiasts and their kindness should
not be abused.
A visit to three Essex collections planned for September was
cancelled due to lack of support.

Final arrangements have now been made for the two-day sym-
posium at Bristol Zoo, which marks the Avicultural Society&amp;apos;s
Centenary Year, on Saturday and Sunday, 10th and 11th Septem-
ber. Council Member, Ken Lawrence, has gathered together a
number of speakers who will present much practical and thought-
provoking information on various aspects of aviculture in the late
20th century - as well as a nostalgic look back at the Society&amp;apos;s
history and some of the people who helped make it the internation-
ally-respected body it is today.
But before the main programme gets underway, and following
a short Reception, Members and Guests, including leading figures
from the world of aviculture, will be welcomed by the Avicultural
Society&amp;apos;s President, Miss Ruth Ezra and Honorary Secretary-Treas-
urer, Geoffrey Greed.
Subjects to be covered during the morning session include
Cranes in Aviculture (Debra Bourne, MA, VetMB, MRCVS) and
Parrotlike Birds (Michael Reynolds). Subjects covered after lunch
are Planted Aviaries (Raymond Sawyer), Quail and Partridges
(Gary Robbins), Bird Photography (Dennis Avon, MIoP, ARPS),
and Avicultural Successes at Chester Zoo (Dr. Roger Wilkinson).
During the pre-lunch session, Raymond Sawyer, will evoke
memories for many older Members when he looks back over the
years and talks on the subject of the History and Personalities of the
Avicultural Society.
On Sunday, 11th September, following Morning Coffee, there
will be a guided tour of Bristol Zoo. Afterwards, Members and
Guests are asked to make their way to Rode in Somerset for an
afternoon at the delightful Tropical Birds Gardens, established by
the late Donald Risdon and his wife, Betty. Afternoon Tea will be
served.
At an &amp;apos;all-in&amp;apos; cost of just #17.50, the weekend represents very
good value and it is only through the good offices of the Society&amp;apos;s
Bristol Zoo headquarters that Members and Guests are assured of
an excellent Celebration Dinner at a cost far below that prevailing
elsewhere at the present time. If Members would like guidance
about hotels recommended for an overnight stay during this week-
end, Margaret Ware of Bristol Zoo will be very happy to help.

BREEDING THE WRINKLED HORNBILL AT
PALMITOS PARK
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.987635" page_id="56230641"  page_num="62" year="" vol="">
By Rosemary Low (Gran Canaria)
The large Hornbiiis are among the most interesting and dramatic
of bird species found in zoological collections. Because of their
size, it is expensive to feed and house them, thus few are kept in
private collections. In recent years, several Hornbill species which
previously were little known in captivity have been imported from
Asia. This is probably because logging has resulted in trappers
entering new areas.
One of the Asiatic species which was imported on a few occa-
sions during the late 1980s is the Wrinkled Aceros corrugatus.
Apparently it is nearly extinct in Thailand, rare in Borneo and more
common in Sumatra and Malaysia. Most captive birds are believed
to have originated from Sumatra. This species is increasingly
threatened by habitat destruction, as it inhabits lowland forests.
However, not much appears to be known about it in the wild.
Adult birds can be sexed at a glance. In the male the side of the
head is white, the gular (throat) pouch is white and the cheeks, neck
and part of the upper breast are yellow-buff. The female&amp;apos;s gular
pouch is dark blue and her plumage is entirely black. The male&amp;apos;s
casque is mainly red and his beak is yellow and pink with the lower
mandible partly brown. The female&amp;apos;s beak and casque are yellow.
In both sexes the iris is brown and the skin surrounding the eye
is bright blue. As in all the large Hornbiiis, the long black eye-
lashes are the envy of many a human female! Length of this species
is about 28-30 in. (70 - 80 cm). In our two pairs at Palmitos Park,
Gran Canaria, the male is noticeably larger than the female.
Both pairs resided in the breeding centre, away from the public,
until 1991 when one pair was placed on exhibit. Because they were
not used to-the close proximity of people they had remained quite
nervous. Within a month of being in the park they were very steady
and soon became so tame that they did not object to visitors
touching them through the welded mesh.
One day in early 1993 I saw the male chasing the female, but not
aggressively. Interpreting this as a sign that he was interested in
nesting, I exchanged the locations of the two pairs. Again it was
interesting to observe how the nervous pair from the breeding
centre soon became tamer in the park.

In February I attended a meeting at Rotterdam Zoo for partici-
pants in EEP (European Endangered Species Programmes) for
several species. One of these was the Great Indian Hornbill
Buceros bicornis of which we have one pair. Koen Brouwer, of the
EEP executive office in Amsterdam, described the importance of
the correct nest site for Hornbills. The entrance must be narrow and
not too high; the female must be able to reach up when standing on
the bottom to take the food offered by the male. There should be
no perch in front of the entrance.
When I returned from the meeting I asked assistant curator Mike
Gammond to modify the nest-box for our pair of Wrinkled Hornbills.
But he had a better idea and offered them a log. I thought perhaps
it was too small - but I was wrong. It measures 3ft. 4in (101cm.)
high and 12in (31cm) wide at the widest point. At the base it is only
about 8in. (20cm.) wide. There is a perfect natural entrance,
neither too high not too wide.
During the last week in March I was surprised to see the female
inside the log looking out, on several occasions. No courtship
behaviour had been observed - but very little time can be spent in
observation. In both pairs, regurgitation of a piece of fruit is often
seen, perhaps as a prelude to courtship behaviour which was
interrupted.
The breeding behaviour of Hornbills differs from that of all
other birds. The female is sealed inside the log from just before
laying until the young fledge. In the large species, this is a period
of at least 14 weeks. I have often speculated on why this should be
so. After all, a large bird with a fearsome beak has less need to
protect itself from predators than most other bird species, yet none
other practices this form of incarceration. If the reason is not for
defence purposes, what can it be?
Being ignorant of Hornbill behaviour, and believing that the
female might need some mud to close the nest entrance, a tray of
mud was provided. I was to discover, however, that she uses the
faeces from inside the nest. I also suspect, but have no proof, that
it is the female who closes the entrance. In the log provided, the
entrance is an irregular shape, measuring 20cm (8in) high; the
width varies between 6cm and 7cm {VA in to 3in) and 9cm in the
centre. On 3rd April I found that the female was sealed inside the
log, which was closed but for a slit 1.5cm (4in) wide. Almost daily
one could see fresh faecal material smeared down the slide of the
slit, making a smooth surface.
A wooden lid was nailed on top of the log and there was a hinged

door in the side - but for emergency use only. These were not used,
however, as we had no wish to disturb the female. From a very
informative paper which recorded the breeding of this species at
Audubon Park Zoo (New Orleans) (Singer and Myers, 1992), the
incubation period of this species is given as about 29 days and the
usual clutch size as three. This zoo was the first to record breeding
this Hornbill, the first success occurring in 1988.
The log for our pair is situated in the enclosed shelter of the
aviary; it stands on a concrete base. While the female was nesting,
the male spent most of his time in the outside flight which is 5m.
(16ft.) long, 2.5m. (8ft.) wide and 2.4m. high. It is covered in self-
planted weeds, one of which grew into a tree on which the Hornbills
clean their bills.
The maintenance diet for these birds consists of about 90%
chopped fruits (banana, grapes, guavas, apple, pear, orange). Soaked
dog chow is also accepted. Crickets are refused; no other livefood
was offered prior to the nesting attempt. Mice and lizards which
enter the aviary are killed and eaten also, on one occasion, an
unfortunate sparrow.
On 9th May, after 35 days of the female being sealed in, a chick
was heard. A few days previously dog chow had been discontinued
as I feared it might swell up in a small chick and prove difficult to
digest. Now there was an urgent task: to find sufficient animal
protein on which the chick could be reared. The female accepted
food from us as readily as from the male. As he refused crickets,
these were offered directly to her four times daily. She took them
for the first few days but thereafter ejected them angrily, usually
injuring them first. Fruit, mainly papaya and banana, was taken
eagerly in almost any quantity offered. She would also take
mealworms. The male relished the large kind and would have
consumed unlimited quantities but he was usually given about 30
at a time. He would accept them quite gently from the hand or from
a container held in the hand.
The female was hand-fed through the slit four times daily for the
entire duration of the rearing period, between 9 am and 6 pm. It was
time-consuming but well worth the effort, as we were confident that
she was receiving sufficient food. She never refused food and she
often seemed very hungry. Although the male was feeding her, I
suspect he did not give enough and preferred to feed her on mice,
lizards and mealworms. Two species of endemic lizards, which are
extremely common, were offered live to the male. He would feed
only small ones to the female, eating the large, tough ones himself.

then only about two daily. They varied in size from new born to
adult. The small ones were fed directly to the female, the large ones
to the male. He would run them backwards and forwards through
his bill, breaking all their bones, before offering them to the
female. David Gammond, who did most of the hand-feeding, noted
that the female became very vocal when given live mice. She would
feed the small ones to the chick.
Yolks of hard-boiled eggs were also offered to the female,
varying in number between two and four daily. When the chick was
feathered he would sometimes try to intercept the food offered to
the female but she did not permit this. 1 noticed, however, that she
often fed yolk to the chick as I offered it, yet seldom let him take
fruit. Who can say whether this was because she preferred fruit or
because instinct told her the chick needed the protein?
Little could be recorded about the development of the chick,
which was not seen through the slit until it was four weeks old.
During the first few days of its life I sometimes wondered whether
I was hearing a cricket chirping inside the log or a chick! Both
made a rapid chirping sound. As the chick grew, its voice altered;
it would solicit food from its mother with a rapid chirping sound.
She would pass perhaps only one item in seven to it; others were no
doubt regurgitated later.
As the chick grew, it was only possible to see his head clearly,
a notable feature was the very light blue iris of the eye.
On 17th July, a small part of the seal of the .nest entrance was
broken. Next morning the female was sitting in the flight with the
male. He was obviously excited to see her; I saw him jumping
backwards and forwards over her on the perch. Next morning the
young Hornbill was sitting on the floor of the outside flight. Later
in the day he was on a low perch and there he spent the night with
his father at his side. Next day, at noon, he was sitting on the ground
in the full glare of the sun, panting. He made no attempt to struggle
when moved to a shady place. The following day, however, he did
not permit such familiarity. Next day I saw the male fly to him with
food in his beak. It was not accepted, perhaps because the young
one was conscious of being observed. The following day and
thereafter the young Hornbill was almost invariably on the highest
perch with one parent on each side. The individual distance (the
space between each bird) was always the same.
According to Singler and Myers, all young resemble males on

fledging in the colour of the face and gular pouch. A feature of the
plumage of our young bird which was not mentioned by them was
the coloration of the shaft of the feathers of the underside of the tail.
This was black, whereas in adults the shaft is white. A small area
at the base and tip of the tail feathers was also black. The skin
around the eye was bright blue - but not as pronounced as in adults.
The casque on the upper mandible was absent. This enables one to
see that Hornbills and Kingfishers are related for, without the
casque, the bill is more reminiscent of that of a Kingfisher.
On fledging, the young one was equal in size to the female, or
slightly larger, but with a shorter tail than that of the male. The
female had emerged from the log with only one or two tail feathers.
The young bird&amp;apos;s casque developed almost imperceptibly; by the
time he was six months old it was nearly as large as the female&amp;apos;s.
Only then was his sex certain, indicated by the red on the casque and
lower mandible. The female&amp;apos;s bill is entirely yellow. In contrast
to the adults, the base of upper and lower mandible was black. By
then, the iris of his eye was pale brown.

On 31st July, 14 days after she had emerged, the female was seen
in the nest again. On 4th August, she started to plaster up the
entrance. Two eggs were laid. However, the female deserted the

the beginning of October, the female laid yet again. She deserted
the nest on 12th October when it was accidentally soaked by a
keeper cleaning the aviary. It was then I suspected the same thing
had happened on the previous occasion. The single egg was placed
in an incubator. It was not known whether the embryo died before
or after this but it was at an early stage of development. The nest
log was then removed.
At the time of writing, the end of December, the young male
remains with his parents. His rearing was the unexpected success
of 1993. It provided a fascinating insight into the breeding
behaviour of Hornbills. More importantly, it was one more small
step in the direction of establishing this Hornbill in captivity. To
date, young have been reared in few collections but with every year
which passes, another collection records success. In 1992 the
breeding station of Vogelpark Walsrode in Majorca was successful
and at about the same time, Kuala Lumpur Zoo in Asia.
After only one season&amp;apos;s experience with this species, it seems to
me that two of the factors important for success are the provision
of a box or log with a suitable entrance (not too wide and at the right
height) and plenty of livefood of the size of small and adult mice
and small lizards.
The larger Hornbills will never be common in aviculture. The
expense of feeding and housing them means that they are mainly
confined to zoological (not private) collections. However, knowl-
edge gained from captive breeding may one day contribute to the
survival of this increasingly threatened group of magnificent birds.

TOOL-USING BY PARROTS: THE PALM
COCKATOO AND THE HYACINTHINE MACAW
</sectionHeader>

Summary
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996015205882353" page_id="56230647"  page_num="68" year="" vol="">
Poorly known aspects of the nesting behaviour of the Palm
Cockatoo Probosciger aterrimus in north-western New Guinea are
described. The tool-using feeding behaviour reported by Wallace
in 1875, is critically re-evaluated in the light of a recently discov-
ered &amp;quot;natural&amp;quot; feeding technique in Hyacinthine Macaw
Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus.
The usual habit of the Palm Cockatoo, which fills the bottom of
the nesting cavity with a layer of interlocking fresh twigs, has been
reported by various ornithologists and partially observed in captiv-
ity.
Different hypotheses have been put forward on the role of this
particular substratum. It has been said it may prevent plumage
soiling by the semi-liquid tarry faeces of. the single chick, the
flooding of the nest cavity by heavy monsonic rains, or the collaps-
ing of the -whole chamber subsequent to termite activity in a dead
or partly dead tree.
During 1982 and 1983 I had the opportunity to carry out brief
field observations in north-western Irian Jaya (Triton Bay area),
which add to the sparse existing data on this primitive species.
Nest selection in Palm Cockatoos seems to be a rather slow
process, due to the wary nature of the parrot. The first step, once
an apparently suitable nesting hole has been located in a mature
tree, is to select a few metres from it a couple of young trees some
10 cm. in base diameter.
After being quickly deprived of their branches, leaves and part
of their bark, these small trees are truncated more or less at the level
of the nest-hole. The two heavily pruned trees are then used as safe
observation posts, to which the birds daily return for a number of
weeks.
This behaviour had been independently observed by Dr. Soendji,
senior associated ornithologist to the Ragunan Zoo, who extensive-
ly travelled through Irian Jaya and the Aru islands. He drew an
explanatory sketch on letter head of the Ragunan Zoo, Jakarta
(Fig. 1).

The familiarity of the species with this kind of vertical perches
is easily verified in captivity, and they could represent a good
&amp;quot;natural&amp;quot; stimulus in order to induce the birds to breed.
Fig.l
When the pair is definitively convinced that the area is totally
safe and that the selected cavity is neither inhabited nor contended
for by other birds, mammals or reptiles, the male flies onto the
nearest main branch where he repeatedly stamps his foot as a
territorial claim or a social or sexual message to the female (1).
Soon after he starts to inspect the hole which he usually enters in
an upside down position, re-emerging within seconds upright
(Fig-2.).
Once a cavity is considered suitable, it is enlarged within a few
days by biting off and scraping away all decayed wood. Then a
number of fresh twigs, which form an interlocking layer, firmly
anchored to the walls, are dropped inside.
Dr. Soendji has often found, mixed with the sticks, flight and tail
feathers of large birds, such as Hornbills or Herons, as well as other
(1) In the course of my field observations I have been unable to register
the tool-using drumming behaviour described in 1984 by A. C. Wood. This
ornithologist, while in Iron Range, north-eastern Cape York Peninsula
(Queensland, Australia), saw a male Palm Cockatoo with outstretched
wings, producing a loud tapping noise by hitting a hollow branch with a
stick clenched in its left foot.

vegetable scraps, the fermentation of which - he suggests - could
produce heat helpful to the development of the embryo. He adds
that small vertebrates, including reptiles, enter the parents&amp;apos; diet in
the rearing period. Although this statement may look rather
surprising, it can be supported by at least two personal observations
of captive Palm Cockatoos at C.S.C.P. nibbling a mouse, presum-
ably captured on the bottom of the aviary, firmly holding it in one
of their claws.
&amp;apos; ' Fig. 2 n
The way these Cockatoos peel off the bark from the big fresh
branches regularly replaced in the flight as perches, may support
the idea that their wild diet includes insect larvae, as in the
Australian Genus Calyptorhynchus.
No doubt the more interesting field observations on the Palm
Cockatoo&amp;apos;s behaviour are those from Alfred Russell Wallace, the
great naturalist and explorer who, in 1857, repeatedly met with this
species on the Am Islands. I quote here from his book, The Malay
Archipelago :
&amp;quot;It eats various fruits and seeds, but seems more particularly
attached to the kernel of the kanary nut, which grows on a lofty
forest tree Canarium communae, abundant in the islands where this
bird is found; and the manner in which it gets at these seeds shows
a correlation of structure and habits which would point out the
&amp;quot;kanary&amp;quot; as its special food.
&amp;quot;The shell of this nut is so excessively hard that only a heavy
hammer will crack it; it is somewhat triangular, and the outside is
quite smooth. The manner in which the bird opens these nuts is very
curious.
&amp;quot; Taking one endways in its bill and keeping it firm by a pressure
of the tongue, it cuts a transverse notch by a lateral sawing motion
of the sharpened lower mandible. This done, it takes hold of the

nut with its foot and, biting off a piece of leaf, retains it in the deep
notch of the upper mandible, and again seizing the nut, which is
prevented from slipping by the elastic tissue of the leaf, fixes the
edge of the lower mandible in the notch, and by a powerful nip
breaks off a piece of the shell.
&amp;quot;Again taking the nut in its claws, it inserts the very long and
sharp point of the bill and picks out the kernel, which is seized hold
of, morsel by morsel, by the extensive tongue. Thus every detail
of form and structure in the extraordinary bill of this bird seems to
have its use, and we may easily conceive that the black cockatoos
have maintained themselves in competition with their more active
and more numerous white allies, by their power of existing on a
kind of food which no other bird is able to extract from its stone
shell&amp;quot;.
This is the first example of tool-using in a wild parrot, whereby
an external object is used as a functional extension of beak or claws
in the attainment of an immediate goal.
Another, more simple tool-using behaviour, has been reported
by Chisholm in 1971. It refers to Rose-breasted Cockatoos or
Galahs Cacatua roseicapilla which in New South Wales dropped
stones on the iron roof of a country house, giving signs of listening
for the sound as a reward. Similar bombing games are performed
by Kea Nestor notabilis in New Zealand.
Neither the aforesaid Dr. Soendji, nor myself, were able to
observe a wild Palm Cockatoo while opening a kanary nut with the
technique described by Wallace. Hence, as suggested by Dr.
Soendji, this could reflect a misinterpretation on the bird&amp;apos;s behav-
iour. It may in fact happen that when snatching a nut the cockatoo
tears off a whole branchlet with it. The accidental interposition of
a leaf between the upper mandible and the fruit may have produced
a false impression (Fig.3.).

Palm Cockatoos at C.S.C.P. generally crack the hard-shelled
Brazilian nuts Bertholletia excelsa by way of simple pressure,
whereas almond or apricot stones are occasionally subjected to a
partial transverse notching.
An indirect confirmation of the feeding technique so circum-
stantially described by Wallace may however come from observa-
tions recently carried out on my captive Hyacinthine Macaw
Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus , a species whose beak structure shows
a degree of convergence with the Palm Cockatoo.
Besides the usual seeds, pellets, fruits, vegetables, raw meat,
etc., the diet of these parrots includes a good percentage of hazel-
nuts, almonds, walnuts, Brazilian nuts, peanuts and various fruit
stones. Only in 1988, while offering a few particularly hard-
shelled almonds (which had resisted the nut-cracker), did I have the
opportunity to observe an unusual behaviour.
The male collected one of these almonds from the grassy bottom
of the flight, and after a two-three seconds unsuccessful pressing
attempt, he suddenly transferred it to the claw and pulled up a large
grass blade in its bill. The almond was then re-seized by the beak,
while the piece of grass was positioned, with the help of the tongue,
on the action point of the lower mandible. After a few attempts the
stone was finally broken. The same process was, within seconds,
performed by the female too (Fig.4).
Fig-4
This technique is invariably adopted every time the birds are
confronted with sufficiently hard almonds or nuts. When part of the
kernel remains inside one half of the shell, the bird seizes it with

the tip of the upper mandible and pulls it out, morsel by morsel,
with the help of the tongue, as described by Wallace. Other aspects
of the feeding habit of the Hyacinthine macaw significantly diverge
from those of the Palm Cockatoo, but these could be discussed in
a subsequent paper.
Other than grass blades, I also had the opportunity to register
different vegetables, such as willow leaves, dry or fresh couch-
grass stalks, etc., being used as a tool by Hyacinthine Macaws. It
is worth mentioning that the two subjects at C.S.C.P. are adult
captured birds, imported separately and still rather wild.
We know that the habitat of the species, in south-western Brazil
and adjacent south-eastern Bolivia, includes vast humid lands
interspersed with palms (Pantanal) and that fragments of date
stones have been frequently found in the stomach of shot subjects.
We could therefore hypothesize that in the wild a piece of vegetable
matter used by the macaws in order to reduce the slipperiness of
these fruit stones (and more in general of stones freshly extracted
from any juicy fruit) allowing the rim of the lower mandible to
achieve a better grip. An action in some way analogous to opening
the screw plug of a bottle by wrapping it in a napkin. The long
oversighting of such a behaviour contrasts with the large number of
Hyacinthine Macaws held in both public and private Zoos, and
reflects research potential of correctly kept animals.

The final contribution to the 25th volume of the Avicultural
Magazine was the then 29-year-old Jean Delacour&amp;apos;s letter, present-
ed in Part I of this retrospective, announcing his acquisition of the
Chateau de Cleres. In the hindsight afforded by the passage of 75
years, it is hard to imagine a more appropriate and portentious
conclusion to the magazine&amp;apos;s first quarter century.
'I have been living here for about a fortnight, and although the
park is by no means ready it is fenced all round and the first arrivals
are enjoying semi-liberty. Besides some mammals there are White-
necked and Stanley Cranes, Emus, a pair of Trumpeter Swans,
Ross&amp;apos;s, Pale-headed, Magellanic, Canada, Bernicle, Bar-headed
and Cereopsis Geese, two dozen Falcated and Chilean Pin-tail
Ducks, Specifer Peafowl, Crossoptilons, and Siamese Firebacks. It
is a small beginning, but I enjoy these few birds very much.

will be ready for June or July. Mme. Lecallier is kindly keeping a
lot of rare and interesting birds for me until my installations are set
up. She has now a wonderful collection, especially of Parrakeets
and Parrots&amp;apos;.

Trogons, in miserable condition, in fact they they were nothing but
lumps of dirty broken feathers. Three died shortly, but two
recovered, moulted out, and became the most charming birds one
could wish to possess. Unfortunately, one died of stoppage of the
intestines from having swallowed the hard skin of some coarse
grape ... My last Trogon is in the best of health, and now moulting

loose together one cock and two hen Sarus, pairs of Manchurian,
White-necked, European and Blue-crowned Cranes, one Stanley
and a dozen Demoiselles. So far they all agree very well together,
and have not destroyed any nest in the spring, but I am very much
afraid that ... after several years ... I shall have to separate some
pairs ... the cock Sarus is full-winged ... he sometimes disappears
and flies very high for as much as half an hour, but except on one

my Cranes never touch the trout, which are abundant in the stream

in Martinique, where I stayed two weeks in November, and
two weeks again in April, thanks to the kind hospitality of the
Governor, I could visit all points of interest in the island ...
'The commonest bird of Martinique is the so-called &amp;quot;Blackbird&amp;quot;
(Merle) ... The males are glossy black; the females and young dark
brown ... A feature of these birds is their quaint and pretty call,
which can hardly be termed a song, and their boat-shaped tail... i
brought home two pairs of [these] ... Quisqualus [sic][niger]
inflexirostris ... they now live in an outdoor aviary, where I hope
to breed them...
'Another very common bird ... is the charming Quit or Sugar-
bird ( Coereba [flaveola] martinicana, locally called &amp;quot;Sucrier&amp;quot;...
The Martinique Quit is almost entirely black, with yellow under-
parts, and, according to age, yellow or cream-white eyebrows; the
base of the bill is red. They are easily caught and live well on the
usual mixture of Mellin&amp;apos;s food, honey, and milk, and insectile
food... I now have eight of the active and bright little birds in
perfect plumage. I landed nine and lost half a dozen on the way to
Europe... As my late friend the Marquis de Siegur had brought the
three species [of Martinican Hummingbirds] to France in 1914 I
did not try to capture any, as I preferred to import Guiana Hum-
mingbirds. Two species of Seed-eaters are plentiful in Martinique
- the Grey Finch ( Euethia [Tiaris] bicolor called &amp;quot;Cici&amp;quot;, and the
Red-throated Finch ( Loxigilla noctis). Both are easy to catch but
difficult to keep at first. I landed only one male Cici, a very small
grey bird, with almost black head and breast, and five Red-throated
Finches, one adult male and four young ones... There is ... a very
nice song-bird of the Tyrant family ( Elainea martinicana) [sic]
called &amp;quot;Siffleur&amp;quot;, a plain grey bird with a crest, most charming in
shape and character. Several young ones were brought to me, but
only one survived; it unfortunately died in a fit one month after its
arrival in France. A Grey Thrush ( Cichlherminia herminieri) also
died soon after it reached Europe...

ornithology, is the migration through Martinique of the Guiana
Parrotlet ( Psittacula [Forpus] passerinus). These little birds arrive
from the north in February and March as a rule, and remain three
to four weeks in the island. I was fortunate enough to see several
flocks of them and to bring home a pair caught near Fort-de-France.
They are typical P. passerina...
'There are in Martinique many other interesting birds that one
would be glad to have in aviaries, but owing to their scarcity I
would not capture them. As an instance, let me mention some
charming hours I spent one afternoon in a wood of giant tree ferns
on the slope of &amp;quot;Montagne Pelie&amp;quot;. One remembers that twenty years
ago this awful volcano destroyed the city of St. Pierre and its
suburbs, causing in three seconds the death of all 40,000 inhabit-
ants. Now everything is quiet again, and the tree ferns which have
grown since the eruption are some 30 feet high, so rich is the
vegetation in the West Indies. A family of birds inhabited the tree
fern wood: a pair and three young Clarinos ( Myiedestes genibarbis)
or &amp;quot;Siffleurs de Montagne&amp;quot;. The Martinique species is, I believe,
superior to all others in beauty and song... These birds only live on
the hills, above an altitude of 1,000 feet. The five Clarinos were
sitting in the shade, sometimes flying to catch an insect... It was
a wonderful sight, these handsome birds in the stately tree ferns;
but more beautiful still was their concert. The male was singing all
the time, and the young ones joining him now and then; I had never
heard before such a melodious and pure voice. Its own song is most
varied, but the Clarino still mimics perfectly human whistling; I
tried Arpeges, and other tunes, which he answered perfectly at
once. The memory of the time I spent with these lovely birds, which
were fearlessly flying and roosting around me, is the best souvenir
I brought back from the West Indies'.

'The journey down the Rio Portuguesa and the Apure, in a
launch, is wonderful... Here, hundreds of Black Vultures and
Caracaras are feeding on the carcase of a reptile; there are also
various Egrets and other Herons, thousands of Terns and Cormo-
rants. On most of the trees overhanging the water Hoatzins are
sitting or moving along the branches, while enormous iguanas
come down to drink... Over our heads hundreds of large birds are
soaring: huge American Adjutants and Tantalus {Wood Storks}

'San Fernando is a miserable and unhealthy little town, fright-
fully hot. I was there the guest of the Lancashire General Invest-
ment Trust, whose officers were most kind to me... The comfort-
able bungalow faces the Apure; from the windows we could see
enormous Crocodiles and Freshwater Dolphins ... and on the sand
bank, half a mile distant, colonies of Terns, mainly of the curious
Rhynchops , made an awful and objectionable noise day and night...
'We left San Fernando, taking with us a Ford lorry to carry our
live animals; Agoutis (of the new species that I have described as
Dasyprocta apurensis). Tiger Cats, Capybaras, Parrots, Macaws
and Parrakeets, Curassows and Guans, King Vulture, Adjutant
Storks, Tree-ducks, Orinoco Geese, Owls, Sun-bitterns, Purple
Gallinules, Snake Birds, Jacanas. At Camoguans we took the small
birds we had left behind; Black-cheeked Cardinals, Tanagers,
Parrakeets, etc... At Caracas we took the birds we had left... We
sailed for Trinidad with that menagerie on 1st January...
'..we have something new: the Motmot of Trinidad... A kindly
aviculturist, who brought up one of these birds from the nest, most
generously offered it to me. A delightful present, for the Motmot
of Trinidad, peculiar to that island, had never been brought to
Europe, it is decidedly smaller, more brilliantly coloured and more
elegant in form than the ordinary species of the Continent Momotus
momota.
'We embarked on 15th January, on the little French steamer
VAntilles, with our menagerie slightly diminished by a few losses
and only augmented by the Motmot. Some of the mammals and
larger birds ... were left behind, thanks to the kindness of the French
Consul, who took care of them until my return'.

of exile he was quite overcome at seeing a member of my family.
His crime, a small burglary - a very light one compared with those
of most of his comrades, had been augmented by his many attempts
at escape... During all my stay there, this man proved himself
absolutely dependable.
'After having installed the Venezuelan livestock that we had
brought with us, we occupied ourselves in procuring Guiana
species. I engaged some liberated convicts who make it their
profession to catch birds to sell skins: they use blowpipes with
wonderful skill; in addition to that, I provided them with traps...
Every day they brought me in something they had captured, which
my assistant, Mr. F, Fooks looked after'...
(Notes of a bird-lover in Tropical America. October, 1922

'It is no easy matter to accustom the feathered inhabitants of the
tropical jungle to captivity. Certain species are very refractory; at
different times we attempted to keep Jacamars and Manakins in
cages, but without success. Some lived for a few days, others a few
weeks, appearing to become accustomed to the food, only to
succumb in the end...
'...our most interesting experience was with the Humming-
birds. These wonderful little things were all caught with the aid of
blow-pipe loaded with pellets of soft earth ... and were almost
always brought to me in an unconcious state. We then held them
in our hands to revive them and make them feed. They were fed
upon a mixture of Mellin&amp;apos;s food, milk and honey, which was
sometimes substituted by phosphatine in place of the Mellin&amp;apos;s...
We found that it was necessary to catch the birds in the morning
so that they had the rest of the day in which to recuperate, for
Humming-birds caught in the evening died more frequently.
Usually they will feed by themselves between four and six hours
after their capture... Thanks to constant attention we did not lose
more than ten per cent of our Humming-birds, and on leaving St.
Laurent we took with us thirty birds representing the following
species: Topaza pella, Campilopterus largipennis, Florisuga
mellivora, and Thalurania furcata, the two latter being the most
numerous... My collection was further increased by Tinamous
(Crypturns soui), Grey-fronted Doves (Leptoptila rufaxilla), Cay-
enne Rails (Cresiciscus cayennis), various Macaws, Jacarini Finch-
es and other little seed-eaters, Saltators, Quit-quits, and many

'The animals and birds rested at St. Laurent with my other
collections under the care of Mr. Fooks, whilst I visited Suriname
and Demerara and went to spend a week with Mr. Beebe at the
Tropical Research Station of Kartobo (British Guiana), and I
rejoined my collection on board the steamer Antilles when I re-
embarked three weeks later at Georgetown (Demerara) for Trinidad
and Martinique'.

'In the spring a few Cranes were added to my collection; three
white Asiatic and three European, sent from Calcutta by Mr. David
Ezra; a pair of Crown Cranes from Sudan, through the London
Zoological Society; these, Balearica ceciliae are very similar to
ordinary West African Crown Crane, but rather smaller, darker, and
with redder cheeks.
'Ducks have done fairly well ... over one hundred were bred,
including ... White-faced Tree Ducks ... bred for the first time in
France... The Ashy-headed Geese have reared four young ones this
year, which brings my little flock ... up to eleven. I have exchanged
them with the Duke of Bedford so that our birds do not become too
much inbred. Some nice Ducks came to me during the year ... above
all, a delightful pair of Cotton Teal, the only ones in Europe, since
those Mr. Astley kept for some nine years have disappeared. They
have quite settled down in an aviary. From Abyssinia I received
a curious pair of Yellow-billed Ducks; they are decidedly smaller,
darker and less mottled than the South African bird and I think
belong to some undescribed subspecies. I intend to make it clear
as soon as I can.
'In October I shall leave for the East, and after some weeks in
India, Ceylon and the Malay States I hope to begin collecting birds

Golden Rhesus Monkeys... In two bird-rooms and in the house and
verandah there are Birds of Paradise in wonderful condition: two
Twelve-wired, one Red, one Lesser and two young Greater Paradise
Birds; a lot of Macaws and Cockatoos, the best being a Lear&amp;apos;s and
a Hyacinthine.
'There is in Calcutta a very rich Hindu (Mr. Kumar Gitendro
Mullick), who has quite a fine collection ... several Paradise Birds
in cages (Twelve-wired and Red) ... and an excellent collection of
Parrots (about 200), the best of them being several Moluccan and
Leadbeater Cockatoos, one yellow and one blue Rock Parrot (Alex-
andrine), one Pesquet&amp;apos;s Parrot, one Hawk-headed, and a Lear&amp;apos;s
Macaw. In the garden, where he has beautiful aviaries, he keeps
eight White Asiatic Cranes, one Manchurian, Demoiselles, Sarus
and European, as well as Jabirus, Adjutants, and other Storks, and
also Pelicans... He most kindly presented me with a pair of Argus
Pheasants and a pair of Crowned Pigeons.
'The Calcutta Zoological Garden is very good. In addition to
fine mammals, there are two male Pink-headed Ducks, lots of
Cotton Teal, good Fireback and Argus Pheasants, and some Para-
dise Birds. Also one Lear&amp;apos;s Macaw and a beautiful pair of Shining
Parrakeets (Pyrrhulopsis [Prosopeia] splendens)... The bird shops
and the bird market are the best I have ever seen... However, as I
cannot buy much on my way out, I only took some Rain Quails,
Zebra Doves and Perdicula asiatica [Jungle Bush Quail] at
tenpence each!
'I also bought in Calcutta three pairs of Crowned Pigeons;
Common, Victoria and Sclater&amp;apos;s... [and] a wonderful Bee-eater, as
large as a Roller, all green, with a turquoise blue &amp;quot;beard&amp;quot;; I cannot

'...on my last collecting-trip in Annam and some other parts of

to watch birds&amp;apos; habits in their natural surrounding. Nevertheless, I
brought back a good many live birds.

crates, and, owing to the efficiency of the Museum Agents, all the

very rich in Pheasants, my collection of these birds was an impor-
tant one, though the importation of live Reinhardtius , the wonder-
ful Argus Pheasant of Annam, was an entire failure. Over seventy
of these beautiful birds were collected, and did well in aviaries for
months, when an outbreak of diptheric roup slowly killed all of
them. I embarked about forty, eleven of which were still alive and
landed at the end of June; but in spite of all care, they died one after
the other. I hope to be more lucky next year.
'The disappointment with the Reinhardtius was compensated
for by better luck with the very rare Edwards&amp;apos; Pheasant ... of
Annam, which was only known before my expedition by four skins
in the Paris Museum. I brought over alive fourteen of these lovely
birds; four pairs and one extra cock are in the best of heaalth at
Cleres, while the other odd cocks, with Swinhoe&amp;apos;s Pheasant wives,
are in the collections of Mme. Lecallier, Professor Ghigi, and
London and Paris Museum Zoos...
'A greater success still is the importation of one pair of a new
species allied to the above, which I have just found in Annam, on
the north of Edwards&amp;apos; Pheasant&amp;apos;s range. It is a larger bird of the
same general blue colour, but with a black crest and a longer and
more curved tail. The female is lighter in colour and larger than the
Edwards&amp;apos; hen.
'I also brought three pairs and four odd cocks of Bel&amp;apos;s Pheasant,
which looks much like a dark Silver. They are not the first imported
..., as one cock lived for some years in Paris. I have kept the pairs
and presented cocks to the Paris and London Zoos and to Mme.
Lecallier.
'Of other Pheasants, I had twenty Crestless, one Noble and
fifteen Siamese Firebacks, two Chinquis and two Germain&amp;apos;s

'Both specie of Cranes are most interesting; the Eastern Sarus
have been very seldom imported, while the Black-necked had never
been seen in Europe before. It is a migratory bird, breeding in
Thibet and wintering in Tonking where I found it ...
'Another curious bird which attracts public attention is the
White-bellied Booby ( Sula sula). It was caught by a deck steward
on the sea between Saigon and Singapore. I was very doubtful
whether I could succeed in getting it to live. I put it in a cage and
crammed it with fish and meat; to my astonishment it thrived, but
never fed by itself during the sea journey. However, it got very
tame in Paris; it fed at once on fish and meat and is in perfect
health ...

'During the thirty years that Mr. Astley kept birds very many
extremely rare kinds lived in his aviaries; ... a Blue-bellied Parrot
(Triclaria cyanogaster) from South-east Brazil... lived many years
in captivity and ended its days in the Zoological Gardens of
London. Mr. Astley possessed many other Parrakeets, and was the
first to breed the Queen Alexandra&amp;apos;s ( Polytelis alexandrae) and the
Golden-shouldered Parrakeets ( Psephotus dissimilis)\ he likewise
bred Pileated Parrakeets ( Porphyrocephalus spurius ), Stanleys,
Many-colours, etc. He owned a Lear&amp;apos;s Macaw, a Pachynus
[Graydidascalus] brachyurus , a Microglossus, and Solitary Lories
from Fiji...
'His collection of Doves was very good, also that of the Water-
fowl, of these he kept for seven years Cotton Teal ( Nettapus ), and
was the only person alive to keep them so long. He had many
Waders too, particularly Agamia [Agami Heron] and Thinocorus
[Seed-snipe]... He always kept many Cranes, and a young Austral-
ian Crane was reared at Brinsop in 1924.
'He was the first in Europe to rear the Pink-breasted Grosbeak
and Orange-headed Ground Thrush, and in his aviaries Shamas,
Blue Robins, American Robins, Crimson Finches, Cuban Colins
[Bobwhites], and others bred freely.

Those who knew him were well aware that Dr. Delacour thor-
oughly enjoyed the effects of such pronouncements upon those who
heard or read them.
'There are perhaps birds of more magnificent plumage than the
Touracos, but to my mind none more entirely desirable; most of
them possess all the qualities which one requires in an aviary bird.
Their shape is perfect, their plumage enchanting; their character
tame and gentle; they live long without special care and, with me
at any rate, breed freely. I own that Touracos are the birds which
I like best of all'...

'In my opinion the peculiar Hoatzin ( Opisthocomus hoazin) ...
is related to the Touracous, to whom it bears a faint resemblance,
although it is heavy, awkward and slow... I had the opportunity of
seeing Hoatzins at close quarters on the Apure in Venezuela, and
in Guiana, and they really are most curious birds, not timid. Mr.
Beebe, who has made a close study of them, considers them ugly
and grotesque. I, on the contrary, think they are curious, even
handsome. No living Hoatzin has yet reached Europe, but their
importation is not impossible, for individuals have lived in con-
finement in British Guiana, fed at first on different kinds of leaves
and then on lettuce and cabbage, which they eat readily and which
suits them very well.
(Touracous November, 1925 (Series IV) Vol. Ill, 284 - 290.)
It was only in the 1980s that Dr. C. G. Sibley&amp;apos;s work with egg-
white proteins established that Hoatzins are indeed allied to
Touracos, rather than being Galliformes, as has been the conven-
tion.
The preceding two excerpts are offered as examples fo the 40
articles written by Dr. Delacour, and a further 18 co-authored
with various person, from 1923 to 1931 (Gibbard, 1988), pub-
lished in both the AviculturalMagazine andTOiseau. With articles
by a number of other British and French aviculturists, these became
the book Aviculture (Seth-Smith &amp; Pocock, 1923) a standard text
for years, well-illustrated, and now a valued collector's item. In
total, the articles written for this project, to a considerable extent
initiated by Delacour, covered a major proportion of the birds
maintained in British and Continental aviculture to that time.

Pheasants which I brought from Indo-China in 1924. Out of three
pairs only one of Edwards&amp;apos; Pheasants bred, laying three clutches...
The rare Imperial Pheasants gave three young ones, but two met
with accident, and only one, a female, was reared. The incubation
period is of twenty-five days. The two pairs of Bel&amp;apos;s Pheasants gave
three and two clutches, and five pairs were reared. It is a very
scarce bird in its natural haunts, only found on a few higher hills
over 5,000 feet of altitude. It is darker and finer than the Silver, and
just as hardy and robust. It had been bred before in the Paris
Museum menagerie, from the type specimen, between 1898 and
1903, but none surviving after 1913. It has never figured in any
other public or private collections. My Argus, although in perfect
condition, stupidly laid in the winter, and the eggs proved unfertile.

breed next season. A very interesting new race, of which a pair has
been sent to me by my friend, Professor A. Ghigi, of Bologna, has
been named by him after me, Lophura sumatrana delacouri ; it
resembles in every way the Bornean bird (L. ignita), but shows the
pure white central tail feathers of the Vieillot&amp;apos;s (L. rufa)...
'Interesting additions to the Duck collection have been Eiders
and Cotton Teal; two pinioned pairs of the latter are now on the lake
... 'I have recently received Great Bustards from Spain, through the
kind help of Captain and Mrs. R. Paget, and they make a very
valuable and long-desired addition to the bird collection.'

'Many of our members may have been surprised that no descrip-
tions of our present President&amp;apos;s beautiful aviaries and enclosures
have appeared yet in the magazine. The reason is that Mr. Alfred
Exra, being continually building new ones and extending his
collections, it is rather a difficult task to give an account of them
that will not be out of date at the time it is published ...
4 ... a bird room has been arranged in a small building ... a very
pretty and light aviary, all built of wire and iron (which used to be
the home of many Sunbirds and Hummingbirds in Mr. Ezra&amp;apos;s
London flat, some years ago), stands in the centre.
'This aviary contains a fine series of birds: three Royal Star-
lings, one pair of Swift Parrakeets, one Indian Pitta, one Yellow-
fronted Woodpecker (. Melanerpes fiavifrons ), two Black-headed
Yellow Bulbuls, and two White-shouldered Bush-chats (Thamnolaea

wonderful Lutinos, three young Blossom-heads, 10 Ring-neck, all
with pink eyes, one semi-lutino male Ring-neck, of a pale yellow-
ish-green, one male Malabar, one male Layard&amp;apos;s, two Long-tailed;
one Tabuan, and one Taviuni, one Rock Peplar, and a pair of
Eclectus (E. roratus).
'Other Parrakeets are to be seen in a series of movable aviaries
in the park ... above all, a wonderful pair of Alexandrines, the male
light-blue and the female pure yellow ...
'At some distance from the Parrakeet&amp;apos;s aviaries ... with an
enclosure ... of some 16 acres, partly wooded and partly covered
with heather, brush and grass, all surrounded by a high fence ...
There live many mammals ... Birds are represented by eight Sarus
Cranes (four of which are full-winged ...), seven Demoiselle, and
four Black-crowned Cranes; some forty Chukar Partridges, Golden
and Amberst Pheasants, Monals and Australian Brush Turkeys.
'We now come to the aviaries proper ... The first group ...
consists ... of a building ... divided into nine compartments ... The
first one is used as a kitchen and a store ... while the other eight

'Sir, - Although I fear that the following notes may not be of
interest to certain members of the Society as they do not apply to
the species commonly kept in English aviaries, I am venturing to

Pigeons, 5 Long-tailed Doves ( Macropygia leptogrammica) 1 East-
ern Sams Crane, 2 Renauld&amp;apos;s Ground Cuckoos ( Carpococcyx
renauldi), 3 White-bellied Cissas (Cissa hypoleuca).
'From Japan: 3 pairs of Copper Pheasants, 1 male Ijima Copper
Pheasant, 3 pairs of Green Japanese Pheasants, 1 Chinese Spot-
billed Duck, 4 Japanese Blue Magpies, 1 Jap. Bullfinch, 3 Yellow-
throated Buntings ( Emberiza elegans ), 2 Jap. Meadow-buntings (E.
dpi ops is), 1 Jap. Blue Flycatcher ( Cyanoptila ), 7 Jap. Zosterops,
5 Varied Tits, 3 Loo-Choo Robins, 3 Jap. Robins.
'From America: 1 pair Hutchin&amp;apos;s [Canada] Geese, 1 pair Least
Geese (Branta minima ), 1 pair Blue Snow Geese, 4 South American
Comb Ducks, 1 female Orinoco Goose, 1 pair Canvas Backed
Ducks, 1 male Rose-breasted Grosbeak, 1 pair Blue Birds, 1 pair
Baltimore Orioles. The last six birds were kindly presented to me
by the Zoological Society of New York, as well as a fine pair of
Kangaroos.
'Although I had already brought some Rheinardt&amp;apos;s Argus in
1924, which arrived in miserable condition and soon died, the
present birds in my collection are the first to live in good health in
Europe ... The very rare Renauld&amp;apos;s Ground Cuckoo, which is only
represented by half a dozen specimens in the museums of the world
(London and Paris), one which I gave last year to Lord Rothschild,
is a notable addition to aviculture. My friend and associate
aviculturist in Indo-China, M.P. Jabouille, now has seven more in
our aviaries at Hui [sic]. We have also there ... three Elliott&amp;apos;s Pittas
which, up to this year, had only been known through the two ...
type-specimens in the Paris Museum, and which we were fortunate
enough to rediscover... It is a gorgeous bird ... I hope to import
some alive on the return from my next trip. M. Jabouille has also
live specimens of the Annamese Pitta, a big brown bird, with a
greenish back. The White-bellied Cissa is also imported for the
first time and is a rare species. All the Japanese birds, most of them
so rare in Europe, were either presented or procured by my Japanese
friends Prince Taka-Tsukasa, Dr. N. Kuroda, M. Matsunaga and
F. Mitsui, whose kindness to me during my visit ... I cannot
acknowledge sufficiently. All these birds will remain in my
collection or that of my friend, Mr. A. Ezra.'

captivity in Japan, and I was astonished to find that it was quite an
easy undertaking. Pairs are kept in quite small enclosures, with
little water ... Fertility of eggs increases with the age of the birds.
White-necked and Hooded Cranes ... are also to be seen, but they
are much less popular and valuable. Imported Sarus, Demoiselle
and Common Cranes are often offered. White Asiatics are rare' ...
* * *
6 Small birds, however, are the favourites with the Japanese, who
can keep and breed them perhaps better than any other people. Both
insectivourous and seed-eating birds seem to thrive as well, if not
better than in any other country.
&amp;quot;... Japanese cages are simply wonderful; whether they are open
bamboo cages or breeding-box cages, they are always pretty and
most beautifully constructed. In comparison, our best cages look
desperately coarse, unfinished and tasteless ... Open bamboo cages
generally rest on a pretty lacquered tray, from which they remain
separated by a movable barred bottom. For each cage there is a
special case, into which it can be put at night... The usual inmates
... are the lovely Loo Choo and Japanese Robins, Blue Flycatchers
( Cyanoptila ), Zosterops, various Tits and Thrushes, Redstarts,
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.944527631578947" page_id="56230667"  page_num="88" year="" vol="">
Bush Warblers, Buntings, Orioles, Jays and Magpies, etc. Higher
cages are used for Larks. All these native birds are easily obtain-
able and commonly kept. Foreign birds are treated in the same way;
among them, many rare species from Formosa can be found.
Malayan and Chinese birds are the most abundant on the market,
where a good many South American and some East African birds
can also be obtained. European, North American and West African
birds are extremely scarce.
'Box cages of a special model are used as breeding cages for
some kinds of seed-eaters ... Hundreds of breeders exist nowadays
all around the Inner Sea, and especially in Osaka ... Each breeding
establishment consists of several hundred box-cages, arranged in
four or five rows on the top of one another, under some small
wooden hut or corridor with a glass front. Each cage is devoted to
one pair of birds ... While Canaries and Javas reared their own
progeny, all the eggs from theAustralian Finches are given to the
Bengalese ... Gouldian, Long-tailed, Masked, Parson, Bicheno&amp;apos;s
and Cherry Finches are bred every year by the thousand. A man I
visited in April had already reared 200 young Gouldians since the

beginning of the year ... In spite of the large numbers thus reared
in Japan, Australian Finches still fetch very high prices, higher than
ours, so great is the local demand ... the uniform food supplied to
seed-eaters consists of various seeds, green food and a very good
mixture, which I highly recommend; white millet immersed in raw
yolk of egg, which all birds eat readily; it is very easy to make and
keeps for two days.
'In Japan all insectivorous birds, native and foreign, are fed on
the same mixture, composed of ground husk of rice and rice itself,
salad and fish-meal ... I sincerely believe that this food is the best
of all such artificial foods ... One must bear in mind, of course, that
no live insets are given in Japan, except in the case of moult or
illness: mealworms are not obtainable. Consequently birds thrive
on the artificial food and on it only ... all there is to do is moisten
it.

American Wigeon drake have been captured on Dr. Kuroda&amp;apos;s duck-
hunting ground ... In a courtyard close to the garden and on the way
to the museum, there are many aviaries and a bird-room. The jewels
are three males and one female of the fine Mikado Pheasant... that
has quite disappeared from European aviaries, and as the Govern-
ment rightly prohibits the capture of this rare bird the only chance
we have of ever seeing it again in our countries lies in Dr. Kuroda&amp;apos;s
future success with his birds and new ones he may obtain through
an official permission.
'There are also ... two species of Godwits, Turnstones ... Gulls
(Laws crassirostris ), a beautiful rare Lory (Eos rubiginosus) ...
Japanese Robins and &amp;apos;Nightingales&amp;apos; (Horornis c. cantons) and H.c.
canturians , Suthoras [Webb's Crow-Tits] ... and different seed-
eating birds.
'Marquis Yamashina also owns very nice aviaries and is mostly
interested in Waxbills and other small birds ... there is one suite of
eight and another of five small aviaries, with roomy houses, each
one for a pair of birds. I noticed among others Diamond Sparrows,
Sydney and Crimson-rumped Waxbills (Estrilda rhodopyga) with
nests and young, three birds which do not breed in cages ...
'The city of Osaka ... has over one hundred bird shops, fifty of
which have been started within the last two years; it shows plainly
that aviculture is rapidly increasing in the country ... I hope the
above notes will show to many of us, who may think that we are the
only good aviculturists in the world, that our Japanese friends have
not much to learn from us, and our members should do their best to
keep pace with such enthusiastic bird-lovers&amp;apos;.

to share the additional expenses and engaged ,Mr. C. S. Webb to
come over and join me.
'On 29th February, 1928, Mr. Webb and his brother arived at
Hue, and when I knew what his requirements were, I decided to
establish his camp at Thua-Luu, ... on the railway line between the
sea and the foot of the mountains.
'I returned home at the end of April, having left Tourane on 19th
March and brought back with me a number of birds alive ... Eastern
Sarus Cranes, Rheinardt&amp;apos;s Argus, Edwards' and Bel&amp;apos;s Pheasants,
Ghigi&amp;apos;s Polyplectron , Tree Partridges, Renauld&amp;apos;s Ground Cuckoos,
etc., as well as a pair of fine new Pheasants from Cambodia which
I have since described as Lewis's Pheasant ( Gennaeus lewisi). At
Singapore I added Malayan and Bornean Argus, Noble Pheasants,
Java Junglefowl, one young Malay Polyplectron , a rare bird, etc.
"Messrs. Webb, however, stayed behind and left Annam at the
end of April, landing at Marseilles on 25th May, with a fine
collection. They worked continuously at Thua-Luu, trapping birds
most skilfully and establishing them with the greatest care and
patience. In fact, no one else can capture and acclimatize difficult
insectivorous birds better than they do. They brought home, in the
best of condition and in spite of many difficulties, forty species of
birds ... twenty two of which were landed alive in Europe for the
first time.

These few notes are on a pair of Laughing Doves Streptopelia
senegalensis , and two pairs of Red-eyed Doves S. semitorquata
which were resident in our garden in Durban, Natal. Just about
every morning of the year we were wakened by a pair of the former
species which sat outside the window in a 20 ft. Rubber Tree Ficus
elastica, to warm themselves in the sun's first rays. Their soft,
accelerating cadence of coos was pleasant enough, except in sum-
mer when they began at about 4.30 in the morning (no-one in South
Africa having the wit to make the great leap into the 20th century
and introduce Daylight Saving Time)!
A further year-round inconvenience arising from this was that it
became dark between 5.00 and 7.00 pm, leaving no time to enjoy
outdoor activities - such as attending to the aviary - during the
working week. The cooing figured in our daily existence more than
we realised for when a Laughing Dove began to call on TV here, our
old dog jumped up from its slumbers and headed for the door. A
previous hobby of his had been running down the doves, with
limited success, and old habits die hard.
Commencing on 4 June, the doves built their usual fragile-
looking, sparse platform of twigs in an exposed position right on
top of a Bougainvillea bush, conveniently situated just below the
kitchen window. It was completed in two days. Various plants in
the garden that had thorns were utilised by assorted nesting birds -
the motivating force seeming to be the fear of tree snakes.
On the first day of building there were uncharacteristic heavy
downpours and gales blew throughout the following day. But the
little apology for a nest -built in a sheltered spot against the house-
held firmly, while half the nests elsewhere blew out of the trees
during a prolonged gale.
The winter is usually one long spell of cool nights and pleasantly
warm, rain-free days, and no doubt this is why the doves choose to
nest at this time. Being right on the seaside, the weather was marred
by sporadic strong winds, both in mid-winter and mid-summer.
With very neat timing, an egg was laid the day after the nest was
completed, followed by another the following day, 7 June. Two
squabs hatched on 20 June, almost exactly on the winter solstice.

During incubation and brooding, the day temperature was be-
tween 22* - 25*C. (72*- 75*F.), and 11*- 16*C. (52*- 61*F.) at night.
The chicks were covered with long, widely-spaced, tawny down,
and soon their crops were bulging with pigeon&amp;apos;s milk.
The temperature always reached 21*C. (70* F.) by about 10.30
am each day, at which time the hen often left the nest to sunbathe
on an adjacent shed roof. The parents foraged mostly in the large
garden, lining up every morning for the daily bread handout, along
with the resident pairs of Yellow-vented Bulbuls, Indian Mynahs
and Red-eyed Doves - as well as two House Sparrows from over the
wall, where they lived on spilled seed from an outdoor battery of
canary cages.
On the 13th day the chicks were perching on the edge of the twig
platform. On 5 July, the 15th day, they left the nest, probably
because I was gardening underneath it. This was about a day
premature. One landed in a nearby tree, while the other found its
way to a tree in a neighbouring garden. They were not checked the
next day, but on 7 July both were back on the nest.
The following day, both had gone by noon. They stayed on an
exposed branch of an adjacent Norfolk pine for the next two days,
leaving to disappear into denser branches when the garden was
buffeted by a fierce squall. They remained hidden and did not move
from the spot for another five days, during which time the wind
blew hard - up to 90 m.p.h.. Both parents were still in attendance
when the young doves finally left the vicinity on the 25th day. They
were fed throughout that time.
Soon afterwards another nest was built in a small lemon tree,
also below the window, and one chick was hatched. On the second
night the hen was scared off the nest and did not return in the
darkness. The chick was brought indoors and put back in the nest
the following morning, long after it was light. The hen reappeared
and commenced brooding and feeding as though nothing had
happened.
The doves foraged mostly on the ground for weed and grass
seeds, also taking hard berries that had fallen from trees. Some-
times they collected half ripe berries directly from the tree, but
were not seen to eat soft berries or fruit.
It was difficult to see if they picked up the occasional insect, but
were thought not to do so. However, there was one exception to
this. Several times a year, day or night and irrespective of weather
conditions, termites swarmed by the millions - in spite of the
tradition that they only do so in the damp.

When this happened, all sorts of creatures threw caution to the
wind and appeared on roadways to gorge on the insects. Blue-
headed Agama lizards jostled skinks and geckos, and even some
small snakes, for a place among hordes of insect-eating birds
ranging from Pied Crows to sunbirds. The Laughing Doves, as well
as the larger Turtle Doves, all got in on the act.
Two pairs of much larger Red-eyed Doves nested in incredibly
spiky date palms at opposite ends of the garden. The palm fronds
were armed with stiff 3-inch spines and dead fronds fell from the
tree at regular intervals. If you spotted one descending you learned
quickly to leap out of the way - after your first lacerating!
The nests were thus totally inaccessible, so nothing was noted
about them. The adults foraged, just like the Laughing Doves,
presumably taking larger items. When approaching or leaving the
nest, the parents often made a peculiar cat-like miaow, especially
if they saw us, although it was some time before we associated this
unpigeon-like noise with the doves.
These doves, along with bulbuls, gorged themselves on the little
dates that were about 20% fruit and 80% stone. How the bulbuls
managed to pass these big hard seeds was a mystery. The Laughing
Doves may have eaten them, but were not seen to do so.
Nestling Laughing Doves suffered much from tree snake preda-
tion, and occasionally from a passing crow, but the Red-eyed Doves
were more secure, deep in the crown of the lethally-spiked palm.
Snakes were able to move freely among thorns, because most of the
native trees were so armed - but the palms stood separate from other
trees and this helped.
Some of the Laughing Doves had a much pinker tinge than
others during the breeding season. It should not be difficult for
some enterprising person to breed this easily-managed species into
a permanent pink pigeon mutation - if they haven&amp;apos;t done so already.
The same remarks applied to the blue on the Red-eyed Doves, with
one cock having noticeably more and brighter powder blue on the
head and neck than rival cocks.

NOTES ON BREEDING THE BLACK-THROATED
LAUGHING THRUSH

By Michael E. Mace (San Diego Wild Animal Park)
Black-throated Laughing Thrushes Garrulax chinensis are en-
demic to Burma, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, and Hong Kong. Their
habitat is secondary growth consisting of thickets, bamboo stands
and forest understory below 1,200 m (King et. al., 1975). There are
48 recognized species of Garrulax currently listed that can be
found in Asia (Howard and Moore, 1991). The Black-throated
Laughing Thrush is a monomorphic species.
Upon arrival in the collection, each bird goes through a custom-
ary 30-day quarantine period. During this time they are subjected
to a few tests to determine their health status. Towards the end of
the quarantine a laparoscopy procedure was used as a method to
accurately determine the gender of each bird which fortunately
proved to be an adult pair.
The Wild Animal Park has kept Black-throated Laughing Thrush-
es from 1988 until 1992. During this period the birds have been
successfully bred in two vastly different styles of aviaries, hatching
a total of 15 chicks.
The first breeding occurred in an open air, public walk-through
aviary that measured 43 x 33 x 12m. The exhibit was well planted
and housed 35 species of birds consisting of 107 specimens. Of this
grouping, six other Garrulax species were kept with G. chinensis.
They were Tickell&amp;apos;s Laughing Thrush G. streptians, White-throated
Laughing Thrush G. albogularis, White-browed Laughing Thrush
G. sannio , Yellow-throated Laughing Thrush G. galbanus, Red-
winged Laughing Thrush G. formosus, and Red-tailed Laughing
Thrush G. milnei. The first four species listed have also success-
fully produced chicks in this exhibit.
The second aviary measured 6 x 1.2 x 3m and was adequately
planted with Purple-leafed Plum Prunus blireiana, Podocarpus,
Podocarpus gracilior and Russian Olive, Elaeagnus angustifolia.
The cage mates in this aviary were a pair of Golden-breasted
Starling Cosmopsarus regius and a pair of Celebes Quail Doves
Gallicolumba tristmata.
The birds nested in the tallest available plant in this aviary
which was the Purple-leafed Plum. One difference in the nesting
in this aviary was that the Laughing Thrushes would only build the

nests in a pre-hung wicker basket.
The breeding pair is very secretive when building a nest, and
equally reclusive when incubating or brooding. However, they
would readily return to a nest if disturbed as was the case when data
was collected on G. streptians in an earlier study (Mace, 1991).
In the large walk-through aviary, the Black -throated Laughing
Thushes consistently built their own nests in Golden Bamboo
Phyllostachys ourea. The average height of four nests measured
3.37m from the ground. The size of each nest measured 135mm x
66mm overall. The primary building components for each nest
were strips of California Grape Vitus californica. The nest cup was
lined in a softer material consisting of excelsior fibres of the
Quaking Aspen Poplus tremuloides which was distributed on the
ground for the birds to utilize. A completed nest was analysed and
found to weigh 43.7g and contained 523 pieces of nest material with
the longest fibre measuring 52cm and the median fibres measuring
31cm.
The average clutch consisted of three to four eggs. The eggs are
laid every other day and are completely porcelain white in appear-
ance. Eight eggs were measured and the median size was 28.4mm
x 18.00mm and weighed 5.8g. at day one. Egg-laying occurred
from April until July. The incubation period was 13 days. The male
and the female participated in the incubation, commencing with the

Upon hatching the nidicolous chicks are cared for by both of the
parents which participate in the feeding of the chicks by making
numerous trips to the nest. The chicks develop rapidly and by the
13th day each chick had fledged (see graph). At this stage flight is
limited to short flights at low altitudes with the attentive parents
displaying aggressive tendencies towards all intruders. At fledg-
ing, the chicks are covered with a slate grey plumage. The bill is
black, lined in yellow which will eventually change to solid black.
In the wild, Laughing Thrushes feed primarily on a variety of
invertebrates which can only be simulated in captivity. Our adults
are maintained on a diet of mealworms, crickets, moistened dog
chow and a multi-vitamin (Super Preen). When the adults are
feeding young, additional insect food is offered throughout the day.

<bodyText confidence="0.9196682" page_id="56230684"  page_num="101" year="" vol="">
Rose-ringed Parrakeets Psittacula krameri manillensis belong
to a genus whose members have the widest range of any parrot
species in the world. They are also common on the beautiful island
of Sri Lanka and in south-east India. Five members of the order
Psittaciformes live on the island - four of them belonging to the
genus Psittacula. They are the Rose-ringed, Alexandrine P. e.
eupatria , Emerald-collared P. calthorpae (which is an endemic)
and Plum-headed Parrakeet P. cyanocephala. The fifth member is
the Ceylon Hanging Parrot Loriculus beryllinus , which is also an
endemic (Henry 1978).
Rose-ringed Parrakeets are found in most areas of the island, but
they seem to prefer the plain areas of the dry zone. They are also
found in the wet zone and in cultivated districts, where they can
cause considerable damage in paddy and grain fields (Henry 1978).
The breeding season lasts from November until June, sometimes
later. At this time pairs normally leave the flocks, which can
number up to 100 individuals, to start their breeding activities. The
two or three eggs are laid in dead trees, abandoned woodpecker or
barbet holes, and similar situations which provide nesting opportu-
nities.
Sometimes they breed in less closed colonies, especially when
the number of nest holes and occurrence of other parrakeet and bird
species makes it necessary. I watched all five species in February/
March 1993 in the lower hill wet zone in the surroundings of Kandy
and Peredeniya. It is interesting that the Alexandrine Parrakeet
also breeds in this area, because normally it is a species of the low
country dry zone. But there seems to be a general change in
distribution of Sri Lankan birds, whereby dry zone species move
into the wet zone and low country birds further up into the hills
(Hoffman).

This parrakeet feeds on a large variety of fruits, nuts and seeds.
Ali and Ripley (1969) describe them feeding on nectar from
Salmalia , Buttea and Erythrina flowers. Further, they feed on
paddy, grain and maize (Henry 1978, Forshaw 1977). I watched

Rose-ringed Parrakeets feeding on the fruits of Samenia saman. I
counted 30 to 50 parrakeets in these trees, feeding on the flesh of
the long fruits while ignoring the seeds they contained. It can take
up to 10 minutes for the birds to consume the flesh of one fruit
before allowing it to fall to the ground while they start on another.
In the same trees I observed the Ceylon Grey-necked Crow
Corvus splendens protegatus , which also fed on the fruits. I
watched them attacking the parrakeets and following them for more
than a few hundred metres. The crows flew nearly as fast as the
parrakeets, so that the last ones were in critical danger of being
captured by the very aggressive crows. But their agile flight,
combined with their smaller bodies, allowed them to fly through the
trees at enormous speeds to elude their larger, but less agile
attackers. In only one hour I counted 16 attacks by the crows.
Another feeding tree seems to be Schleicher a oleosa. I watched
Rose-ringed Parrakeets taking small pieces of the bark and eating
it. Sometimes they also fed on the seeds. In comparison to their
activities in the Samenia saman trees, I watched only up to five
individuals in S. oleosa In the famous botanical gardens of
Peredeniya I watched Rose-ringed Parrakeets apparently searching
for food in Parkia roxburgii. I never actually saw them feeding. On
the ground I found some fruits with marks that might have been
made by Parrakeet bills. In the same tree I found the nest holes of
Rose-ringed and Plum-headed Parrakeets. Some Sri Lankans told
me that the parrakeets also feed on bananas, papaya and the fruits
of the Yax tree,

There is not a great deal of information about the daily periodic-
ity of members of the genus Psittacula in Sri Lanka. Forshaw
(1977) describes Alexandrine parakeets flying to their feeding
grounds at sunrise. In the evening, parrakeets return to their
roosting trees in groups. The Rose-ringed Parrakeet seems to move
about a good deal while searching for food each day.
The parrakeet year is subdivided by one or sometimes two
breeding seasons. Table 1 gives a comparative summary of the
different Psittacula species in Sri Lanka after Henry (1978). It
becomes obvious that all four species are breeding from February
to May. Some species start one or two months earlier, two species
sometimes have a second breeding period. These circumstances are
responsible for a strong nest hole concurrence between the parra-
keets, which is strengthened by other hole-breeding birds like
Ceylon Common Mynahs Acridotheres tristis melanosternus, barbets

and woodpeckers. I found the nest holes of parrakeets and mynahs
in one tree. The situation between the different parrakeet pairs is
similar and produces agnostic actions every day.
To obtain more information about the daily activities of the
breeding parrakeets, I watched 16 nest holes found in an area of
nearly 3.2 ha. Of this number, 10 nest holes belonged to Rose-
ringed parrakeets, four belonged to Rose-ringed Parrakeets, four to
Emerald-collared Parrakeets and only one each to Alexandrine and
Plum-headed Parrakeets. Complementary, I counted the flying
activities of the genus Psittacula in the surroundings of Kandy on
several days and made some observations at feeding trees.
Flying activities started with sunrise and achieved a first max-
imum point at nearly 6.30 am. It stopped at 9.00 - 9.30 am. In this
period the parrakeets seemed to fly from their sleeping and breed-
ing trees to their feeding places, which could be several kilometres
away. I was able to watch groups of up to 50 individuals at feeding
trees during this time. Pairs very often fed their young from sunrise
to 11.00 am. After this time there seemed to be a pause, which was
signed by only a few feeding activities at the nest holes.

individuals. The flying height varies between 20 and 150 metres.

BATHING
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.955030923076923" page_id="56230687"  page_num="104" year="" vol="">
First of all, I want to point out that I never saw Rose-ringed
Parakeets bathing in rain in Sri Lanka, but some parrakeets bathe
in water bowls in aviculture and rain bathing is described, too
(Smith 1972).
I watched some Rose-ringed parrakeets bathing in the wet
leaves of trees after a rainy night. They flew into the fine structured
leaves and whirled up the water by using their wings and shaking
their bodies. Sometimes they hung inverted in the trees and opened
their wings, shaking their heads and bodies. Their tails were spread
and nearly all body areas were wet. Sometimes their bodies seemed
to become too heavy for the birds to fly, so they had to shake to
dispose of surplus water. This bathing behaviour could last up to
15 minutes.

THE LARVON BIRD GARDENS, ZIMBABWE
By Jeffrey Boswall (Bristol)
Just outside Harare (formerly Salisbury), the capital of
Zimbabwe (formerly Southern Rhodesia), lies the Larvon Bird
Gardens. Owned and run since about 1991 by Frikkie and Henry
Prinsloo, the gardens were taken over from a Harry Scott who
founded the collection, mainly on orphaned birds brought in, and
on donations of young birds.
The Prinsloos were originally interested particularly in parrots
and these there still are, perhaps 25 species, but the majority - say
200 - of the c260 species now kept are indigenous Zimbabwean
species. The few other exotics include Black Swan, peafowl and
Indian Hill Mynah, all outstandingly popular with the public.
About 100 species live in a walk-through aviary where, on 17
December 1993, a number of birds were nesting including Wattled
Plover. Red-faced Mousebirds, as well as different weavers,
sunbirds, shrikes, starlings, finches, Estrildids and others can be
studied at very close quarters. The whole establishment, from the
standpoint of a birdwatcher, is a three dimensional living field-
guide!
From the point-of-view of animal welfare, a good job is done
with sick and injured wild birds and with unwanted captive ones.
Then again, from a conservation perspective, research is intended
into the breeding of - in particular - birds of prey. There are eight
species of eagle, (including the Black) - a couple of Secretary
Birds, a Gymnogene ( a kind of harrier hawk), a Yellow-billed Kite
(being a race of the Black) and four vultures including the Cape.
There is no limitation on size with Great White Pelican (at 25 lbs
the heaviest flying bird?), Greater Flamingo (apart from cranes like
the Sarus, surely the tallest flying bird), the Marabou, also very tall
(a stork succeeding in being a vulture?) and the largest of all birds,
the Ostrich (and the only living species so distinctive that it is in
an order all of its own, and is the only one so &amp;apos;honoured&amp;apos; out of -
at the latest count - 9,650 bird species).
The collection of owls includes Pel&amp;apos;s Fishing Owl and the Pearl-
spotted. I tried to get the latter to turn its head and show me the
&amp;apos;eyes&amp;apos; in the back of its head but failed, so I&amp;apos;ve written to suggest
that a mirror be fitted at the back of its cage.
Well over half the visitors are tourists from overseas, and while
only a proportion of Zimbabweans who will enter are true locals,
the proportion is increasing and the birds on display should help
educate all Zimbabweans about their rich avian heritage.

SODA EXTRACTION MAY JEOPARDISE FLAMINGOS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9418369375" page_id="56230690"  page_num="107" year="" vol="">
Considering that the East African population of the Lesser
Flamingo Phoeniconaias minor may number as many as four
million, it is remarkable that their nest place remained undiscov-
ered until 1954 when the late Leslie Brown almost lost his life
attempting to cross the scorching hot soda flats to reach the birds&amp;apos;
nests at Lake Natron, northern Tanzania.
Occasionally they build nest mounds and lay eggs at other Rift
Valley lakes, but have only once been known to do so successfully
at Kenya&amp;apos;s Lake Turkana and, in 1962, at Lake Magadi. Even on
that occasion many nestlings had to be rescued and others died as
a result of encrusted soda forming anklets around their legs and
weighing them down.
Only at Lake Natron do huge flocks breed successfully on a
regular basis. Now a plan is afoot to build a factory there to extract
the soda - which, should it go ahead, could disrupt for ever the
delicate balance of this unique site.

(Martinus Hall) at Birdpark Avifauna. Masked Plovers Vanellus
miles were also early and our first breeding pair started to lay eggs
on 6th January. Many eggs followed and by mid-March nine chicks
had hatched.
The tropical temperature in the hall suits many of our doves and
pigeons and breeding results with several have been good. Two
species of fruit doves, the Orange-fronted Ptilinopus aurantifrons
and Black-chinned P. lechlancheri , together with Red-throated
Ground Dove Gallicolmba rufigula were all successful.
Plovers and pigeons are held as pairs but Grosbeak Starlings
Scissirostrum dubium can be kept in a group. The first chick
fledged this year on 26th January.
We are expecting the chick of our pair of Great Hornbills
Buceros bicornis homrai to fledge in May. We are very pleased that
we can continue our progress with this subspecies for the E.E.P.

NEW SPECIES?

A new, small partridge-like species discovered in evergreen
forest in the Udzungwa Mountains of Tanzania, is unusual enough
to have had a new genus created for it and has been named
Xenoperdix udzungwensis. Five scientists from the Zoological
Museum of Copenhagen University, led by Dr. Lars Dinesen, who
made the find, said the birds appeared to be plentiful locally. They
are - they think - survivors of a species once common along the
African coast and across into Asia.

Fig Parrot found in New Guinea - considered to be one of seven
Australian birds in imminent danger of extinction. Possibly fewer
than 50 remain in subtropical rainforests in coastal regions of
southern Queensland and northern New South Wales. Surveys in
areas where it used to be seen have produced only one sighting.
So little is known about its habits that should a captive breeding
programme become necessary, as seems probable, staff at Currumbin
Sanctuary in Queensland are developing appropriate breeding tech-
niques with the Red-browned race from northern Queensland.
After a number of ups-and-downs, several clutches were raised last
year. So Curator, Liz Romer is confident they can now breed fig
parrots &amp;apos;fairly successfully&amp;apos;.

even the two greatest areas of rainforest, in the Amazon and Congo

Confusion over the first recorded UK breeding of parent-reared
Duivenbode&amp;apos;s Lories Chalcopsitta duivenbodei has now been re-
solved. Responding to a request for information (Avicultural
Magazine , 1993, 99, 158), Rosemary Low writes: &amp;apos;Parent-reared
young were produced by a pair belonging to Bob Grantham and
myself in 1983 and 1984 and perhaps after this; I do not have the
records after 1984. These breedings are recorded in the third
edition of my work Parrots, Their care and breeding , pages 334-5.
In the first nest, one chick was hand-reared and one was parent-
reared. I recall feeding one of these chicks on the day after
hatching, as it had not been fed by the female (she appeared not to
feed her chicks on the first day). In future nests in which the young
were parent-reared, the young were fed entirely by the parents&amp;apos;.
Rosemary concluded: &amp;apos;I continue to breed this delightful little lory
at Palmitos Park. This year (1993) four young were hand-reared
and one parent-reared from our only pair&amp;apos;.

FOREIGN BIRD BREEDER OF THE YEAR
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990772583333333" page_id="56230694"  page_num="111" year="" vol="">
The 1993 CAGE &amp; AVIARY BIRDS Foreign Bird Breeder of the
Year competition, organised by that weekly journal in conjunction
with the Foreign Bird Federation and John E. Haith Limited, was
judged by Avicultural Society council members. Bob Grantham
and Dr. Roger Wilkinson, Curator of Birds at Chester Zoo.
The results, announced recently, revealed a number of interest-
ing breedings. Terry Cook bred 35 Purple Grenadiers Uraeginthus
ianthinogaster and 13 Violet-eared Waxbills U. granatina , yet
failed to win the hardbill category and instead finished runner-up.
Jim Matthews, another breeder living in Yorkshire, the winner of
the Parrot category, bred 13 Military Macaws Ara militaris , as well
as other macaws and parrot species.
Philip Fisher of Norfolk, winner of the Softbill award, was
particularly successful with sunbirds and bred three White-bellied
Nectarinia talatala , two Yellow-bellied N. jugular is and two Scar-
let-chested N. senegalensis. Runner-up, Roger Green bred five
Rufous-vented Yuhinas Yuhina occipitalis (a possible first British
breeding). Other species bred by him include four Plumbeous
Redstarts Phoenicurus fuliginosus, three Siberian Thrushes Zoothera
sibirica and four Chestnut-capped Thrushes Z. interpres.
In Essex, Charlie Mott succeeded in breeding six species of fruit
pigeons: two Magnificent Ptilinopus magnificus , three Pink-spot-
ted P. perlatus , three Jambu P. jambu , two Superb P. superbus , two
Beautiful P. pulchellus and three Black-naped P. melanospila.
Roger Cattermole, runner-up to him in the Any Other Species
category, bred 208 ducks and waders, including the Spotted or Cape
Thicknee Burhinus capensis. He also bred six Racket-tailed Roll-
ers Coracius spatulata. It was following his success in 1991, his
account of which was published in the Avicultural Magazine 1992,
98, 1; 22 - 26, that Roger was awarded the Avicultural Society
medal for the first British breeding of this only recently available
species.
Paradise Park at Hayle in Cornwall won the top award in the Zoo
and Bird Garden section. Among the 32 species bred were 10 which
had not succeeded there previously. Included were Yellow-should
-ered Amazons Amasona barbadensis , which had four young,

Moustached Parrakeets Psittacula aiexandri , which also produced
four young, and Citron-crested Cockatoos Cacatua sulphurea
citrinocristata with one youngster. The latter breeding coincided
with the park being appointed species co-ordinator for the recently
established European breeding programme for this subspecies.
Temminck&amp;apos;s Tragopans Tragopan temminckii raised three young,
and in the same aviary, Brazilian Scarlet Tanagers Ramphocelus
bresilius reared three broods. Two young Argus Pheasants
Argusianus argus were fathered by a male bred at Paradise Park in
1984. Other successful breedings were achieved with Wattled
Crane Bugeranus carunculatus (one), Crowned Crane Baiearica
pavonina gibbericeps (two), Cheer Pheasant Catreus wallichii
(two), Stone Curlew Burhinus oedicnemus (one), Bartlett's Bleed-
ing Heart Pigeon Gallicolumba criniger (one), Buffon&amp;apos;s Macaw Ara
ambigua (three) and Yellow-fronted Woodpecker Meianerpes
flavifrons (one).
In 1992, John Heath hand-reared a St. Vincent Amazon A,
guildingii from an egg laid by the hen of Paradise Park&amp;apos;s pair. More
recently he raised a Palm Cockatoo Probosciger aterrimus for the
park.

Almost 40 members and their guests visited The Cotswold
Wildlife Park at Burford on Sunday, 13th April 1994 to view an
interesting collection of birds, mammals and reptiles housed in a
delightful setting at this attractive Oxfordshire park. On the day of
our visit, the weather was fairly typical of what one expects in
England in mid-April - sunny, but with a wind which, in exposed
situations, was quite biting.
The park&amp;apos;s birds are mainly housed in well constructed, spacious
aviaries with good plant cover which allows the occupants to
escape from visitors&amp;apos; eyes when they choose to. Many of the flights
were linked to what appeared to be heated shelters.
The collection, although varied, is particularly strong on Pheas-
ants and Tour a cos A highlight in the Walled Garden is a pair of
Great Blue Touracos - probably the only birds of the species at
present on display in a public collection in the UK. It was the first
time I had seen the species in an outside flight.
In another aviary, a single White-crested Touraco was admired.
Again, this bird snd its mate (incubating at the time of our visit) are
the only examples of the species to be seen in a zoo or bird garden
in Britain. Elsewhere, a single Ross&amp;apos;s Touraco was awaiting a mate.
Notable among the Pheasants were Satyr and Temmi nek&amp;apos;s
Tragopans, Reeve&amp;apos;s, Kocklass and Monals. Another interesting
member of the Phasianidae at Burford is the Capercaillie.
Toco and Red-billed Toucans are in the collection, as are
various parrotlike species which include an odd Electus, Macaws,
Double Yellow-headed Amazons, Cockatoos and a colony of Love-
birds.
The Tropical House had had its vegetation cut-back and as a
result we had good views of Banded Rail, -Luzon Bleeding-heart
Pigeons, Silver-beaked Tanagers, Andaman and Philippine Star-
lings, and a colony of Zosterops.
Aviaries in the Walled Garden (where the Tropical House is
located), are very well sheltered and a pair of Collared Starlings

Hornbills (the female was being mudded in at the time) together
with a variety of Waterfowl. It is hoped a pair of Demoiselle Cranes
will be kept at liberty in the Walled Garden.
Outside the Walled Garden are aviaries containing various owls,
while on the lake are Nene and Red-breasted Geese. The owls in
particular seem to fascinate many visitors.
All the birds looked in good health in their spacious accommo-
dation. Our thanks go to the park&amp;apos;s manager, Colin Fountain and his
keepers who answered all the questions put to them and helped
make the day successful. I even met our editor&amp;apos;s son, Michael
Woolham who is on the staff at the park.

Sir,
Re: Visit to Flimwell Bird Park
I would like to correct the item in Volume 100, No. 1, 1994 (page
55) of the Avicultural Magazine. I was in fact one of the nine
members who requested a place at the above meeting, and subse-
quently attended on the day.
Although Dr. and Mrs. Player were understandably disappoint-
ed by the poor turnout, they made me most welcome. I enjoyed a
delightful and informative morning in their company and would
like to thank them again for their hospitality.
The only consolation one can draw from this meeting is that the
other eight guests missed a great day out.

In the final paragraph of my letter to the Editor (.Avicultural
Magazine 1993, 99, 4; 213 - 214), I passed on details of how
photocopies of articles in journals can be obtained from the British
Library through British Council offices abroad and concluded: 6 1
wonder if this service is available to us here in Britain?'
Nicholas Gould, Editor of International Zoo News was kind
enough to write to tell me that he believes such a service operates
through our local public libraries, though it is several years since
he has used it. I wrote to Cornwall Libraries and Arts Department
and, getting no reply to my enquiry, I heeded Nicholas&amp;apos;s advice to
be politely insistent if they tried to fob me off. I wrote to the
council&amp;apos;s Chief Executive and soon received a reply.
There is no problem obtaining photocopies of scientific papers
from local public libraries I am assured. Moreover, the small
charge of 50 pence for each paper is surprisingly cheap by to-day&amp;apos;s
standards. Apparently, although the copy remains strictly the
property of the British Library, arrangements can be made to retain
it.
The end of the third paragraph of my earlier letter somehow
went a little awry. The final point I was attempting to make about
the Red-billed Parrots Poicephalus rufiventris, which were rescued
from bulldozed Baobab trees and hand-reared, was that the wildlife
officials who insisted on releasing them seemed less concerned
about where they were set free. I think that it was simply a matter
of opening the door or doors and letting them go then and there ...
not in eastern Kenya where they live, but well to the west in the
habitat of the Brown Parrot P. meyeri where, unless I am mistaken,
there are no Baobab trees.

DONALD RISDON
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.979065744186047" page_id="56230699"  page_num="116" year="" vol="">
Aviculture in general, and particularly the Avicultural Society,
lost one of its most respected names with the death on 24th April
1994 of Donald Risdon. He was 82 and is survived by his wife,
Betty and stepsons, Keith and Andrew Glenn.
He was widely known in avicultural circles both here in Britain
and overseas, and for many aspiring birdkeepers with a preference
for exotic species, particularly during the 1950s and 1960s, &amp;apos;Q.H.S.
Risdon&amp;apos; - author of several successful books including &amp;apos;An Intro-
duction to Birdkeeping &amp;apos; and &amp;apos; Foreign Birds for Beginners &amp;apos; - was
required reading. His books still grace many an avicultural book-
shelf. These works, and the many authoritative articles he wrote for
various publications including the Avicultural Magazine , provided
the main outlets for the enormous reservoir of avicultural experi-
ence and knowledge he possessed.
Donald Risdon joined the Avicultural Society in January 1934
and was elected to the Society&amp;apos;s Council in 1946. In 1973 he was
elected a Life Vice President in recognition of his commitment to,
and endeavours on behalf of, aviculture over much of his lifetime.
He was awarded the President&amp;apos;s Medal by the Society in 1989.
He contributed many articles to the Avicultural Magazine be-
tween 1941 and 1990. The first of them appearing in 1941 when,
as a young Flight Lieutenant in the Royal Air Force, he found
himself serving on the Gold Coast - a wonderful posting for hny
serviceman with Donald Risdon&amp;apos;s interest in birds.
And birds were to remain a major interest in the years after
World War II when he joined Edward Boosey and Alex Brooksbank
as a Director of what was then Britain&amp;apos;s best known and most
reputable exotic avicultural bird business - Keston Foreign Bird
Farm in Kent.
Many members will remember this bird farm and it is interesting
to reflect on how much influence its concepts have had on present
day public bird gardens, including the Tropical Bird Gardens at
Rode (Somerset), established by Betty and Donald Risdon, which
opened in 1962 - the first of its kind in the UK.
I had the pleasure of meeting Donald Risdon on just three
occasions, twice at the National Exhibition of Cage Birds and more
recently at Rode. He was unfailingly courteous and ever-willing to
proffer advice ... if asked. There is not the slightest doubt that a
man of Donald Risdon&amp;apos;s qualities will be greatly missed by all who
knew him - and by many more whose only contact was through
reading his books and articles. On behalf of all members of the
Avicultural Society, condolences are extended to his family.

The Centenary Celebration Weekend held at Bristol Zoo on 10th
and 11th September was, by all accounts a considerable success.
'Good food, good company, excellent organisation and a panel of
interesting speakers' effectively sums up the comments and other
communications which followed the occasion.
Thanks are undoubtedly due to Geoffrey Greed, Director of
Bristol Zoo, and the Avicultural Society&amp;apos;s Honorary Secretary and
Treasurer, together with those members of his staff who contribut-
ed so much to the event&amp;apos;s smooth running. Council Member Ken
Lawrence also put in a considerable effort to gather together a first-
class panel of speakers for the opening day&amp;apos;s Symposium.
All of the papers given on that occasion were taped &amp;apos;live&amp;apos; and
now await transcribing. I hope it may be possible in the not too
distant future to publish the results as a special supplement for
members, rather than including them in this year&amp;apos;s final issue of the
Avicultural Magazine (which will be published in December) to the
exclusion of a number of interesting articles which are scheduled
for publication at that time.
Material has been coming in at a good rate over the past 12
months, but more is needed if a high standard of content is to be
maintained and I look forward to receiving material from members
in the UK and overseas in the future.
It is interesting to reflect that the magazine started life 100 years
ago with just eight pages per issue, although this number was
doubled during the second year.
At various times over the ensuing years, its Editors have strug-
gled to find sufficient material to fill its pages. But there were also
other problems.
In the magazine&amp;apos;s 75th Anniversary Special Supplement, pub-
lished in November 1969, C. J. O. Harrison, then Assistant Editor,

wrote an amusing account of some of the trials and tribulations
experienced during the publication&amp;apos;s early days. Members who do
not have that particular issue may be as amused as I was to read the
following extract:
&amp;apos;The magazine started off a little rashly with the offer, in the
opening statement reproduced in this magazine, for advice to be
given on all matters by correspondence. This appears to have
produced an embarrassment of material since already, at the
beginning of the second number in December 1894, the Secretary
was apologising for having to omit letters through lack of space.
There was also an indication of early financial stringency when, at
the same time , he added &amp;quot;Mr . Sergeant has very kindly sent me a
charming design for the cover of our magazine but the Treasurer
tells me that he has not sufficient funds in hand to make use of it at
present. The cost of the block would #L 16s. Od. Will any of our
wealthier friends come to our assistance? &amp;quot; Since the cover usedfor
the first number continued to be used for several years we must
conclude that they wouldn&amp;apos;t. '
It was clearly hard going in those days!

The Painted Bunting Passerina ciris belongs to the group of
colourful buntings Passerina supp. included in the subfamily
Cardinalinae, family Emberizidae. The genus is characterised by
pronounced sexual dimorphism, small size, bright colours, and the
absence of the conspicuous crest of cardinals. The Painted Bunting&amp;apos;s
breeding range includes the warmer regions of south-east United
States and Mexico, reaching from North Carolina to the north to the
Yucatan Peninsula to the south. During the fairly wide winter
migration this species moves to the Gulf Coast, Guatemala, Cuba
and Panama.
The Passerina ciris male is one of the most colourful American
birds. The head, nape and sides of the neck are deep violet blue that
contrasts with the red eye ring; throat, rump and chest are bright
red; the back is yellowish green; wings and tail are bronze brown.
The female and juveniles are bright grass green with lighter under-
parts. The males keep their juvenile plumage until the second
moult. Despite the bright colours of the male, Painted Buntings are
difficult to see in the wild because of their shy and secretive
behaviour. Only during the breeding season is it possible to spot the
males, singing loudly from a high exposed perch. The song is a
melodious warble that can be produced also during flight. Like the
Nightingale Luscinia megarhynchos , male Painted Buntings sing
also at night.
These birds prefer edge habitats. They can be found in shrubs,
hedgerows, weed fields, woodland edges, along water courses, in
gardens. They feed on mature and immature seeds, and on insects.
They build their nest in shrubs and bushes, usually not far from the
ground.
Being a native species, Painted Buntings are protected in the
United States and are imported only rarely in Europe, probably
from Mexico. Because of their song and beautiful colours, males
were imported in larger numbers than females and reproduction in
captivity was never systematically pursued. I purchased a pair of
these birds in spring 1989 from a pet shop, and that was the last time
I saw recently imported birds of this species.
In the literature it is usually said that Painted Buntings are cold-

sensitive. Therefore, initially, the pair was housed in an indoor
cage. They adjusted quite easily to life in a small cage, though they
never became tame nor tolerated people coming too close. They
were fed an exotic and canary seed mixture, some mealworms and
fruit (orange, apple, pear, all of which they often ignored). They
bathed twice a day, but their plumage did not recover from the
stressful period in the pet shop until the following moult. In my
four years experience with this species, in order to maintain the red
colours of the male, I found out that colour feeding is essential,
unless it is possible to provide the birds with plenty of live food and
dark soft berries like those of Sambucus nigra and Phytolacca
decandra.
From 1990 on, the birds were housed in a mixed collection in a
planted outdoor aviary. Winter cold (in Rome the temperature only
occasionally drops below 0* C) did not seem to be a problem. In this
setting, the birds gained in health and attempted to breed in August
1990. This attempt was unsuccessful, since, within 5 days, the only
nestling was thrown out of the nest and died. In 1991, the pair did
not attempt any further nesting, probably because they were pro-
vided with live food only occasionally. In 1992, the pair had two
broods and three nestlings (2 females and 1 male) were reared to
independence. In 1993, the adult pair did not attempt breeding. A
pair of yearlings (the second yearling female had escaped) bred
twice but the nestlings always died within 5 days from hatching.
Table 1 shows the data relative to the broods carried out by my first
pair in 1992, and by the pair of yearlings (brother and sister) in
1993. The unsuccessful results of the younger pair is probably
related to a dietary mistake ( probably a calcium deficiency) since
the birds were actively feeding the nestlings.
This species is overall not difficult to cater for, even in the case
of subjects that have been wild caught, as was my first pair. There
are, however, some requirements that are essential for successful
breeding, as my inconsistent breeding records demonstrate.
During the winter the birds are very quiet and shy. They spend
much of their time in the thick cover offered by a Thuja occidentalis
plant. They eat mealworms if available but would not go imme-
diately to the floor of the aviary to get them. They are quite
peaceful towards each other and other species. During winter (after
the moult) it is even possible to house more males together.
In April, when the temperature stays over 15* C most of the time
and days are longer than nights, the male starts singing quietly from
a bush and gets more aggressive towards fast flying birds which it

chases at full speed. This behaviour might seem aggressive, but the
bird does not attack its &amp;quot;victims&amp;quot;, rather it just plays at pecking
their tail, when they try to escape. In fact, birds that do not accept
the chase and hold their ground are not attacked and the bunting
rapidly loses interest. Apart from this chasing, the male is tolerant
towards other birds. It is also interesting to note that during the
whole breeding season, the male spends a great deal of time singing
loudly and flying around the aviary, often in circles, and it gets
more and more excited when there is another male in sight.
As the season progresses, the song of the male becomes louder,
while the female starts exploring possible places to nest. Some-
times, the male enters one of these secluded spots and utters a
peeping sound, trying to attract the female there. In this phase, the
courtship of the male also includes going to the ground and
tightening all the feathers against the body, with lowered and
vibrating wings. This posture evidences the bright red eye ring.
When the female starts uttering often a rhythmic sound, mating and
nest building soon follow: every now and then, the male stops
singing and flies fast towards the female with a peculiar call, with
all the red feathers of the chest fluffed up, and slowly tries to land
on her back to copulate, if the female is receptive, she will raise
her tail and accept copulation.
The female builds the nest with dried leaves, petals, and twigs
for the centre layers and coconut fibres for the inner lining. The
female takes care of nest building, brooding and feeding the chicks.
The male participates in feeding the nestlings only in the last days
before fledging and until weaning.
In order to breed Painted Buntings in captivity, it is necessary
to provide them with abundant live food, both for stimulating the
onset of breeding behaviour and as food for the nestlings. The
parents feed the nestlings exclusively with one insect at a time
carried to the nest in the beak (i.e. they do not regurgitate food). I
provided the birds with waxmoth larvae Galleria melonella (which
are more nutrient and digestible) and mealworms Tenebrio molitor.
Soon after hatching the larvae have to be cut in smaller pieces in
order to &amp;quot;fit&amp;quot; into the nestlings&amp;apos; gape. Such food is unbalanced in
vitamins and minerals. It is therefore useful to sprinkle the cut
larvae with some mineral and multivitamin preparation. When the
nestlings are 6-7 days old it is also possible to provide the parents
with germinated hemp and soaked egg food. When the insects are
finished the female might feed the nestlings with dehusked sprout-
ed hemp seeds or with small pieces of egg food.

<bodyText confidence="0.998962269230769" page_id="56230713"  page_num="126" year="" vol="">
Overall, the live food for the nestlings must be provided to the
parents very often (every hour and a half approximately) and
possibly in small amounts, from dawn to dusk. This schedule is
unavoidable for waxmoth larvae (which are also the most important
food for the nestlings), but with cut mealworms it is possible to give
bigger amounts less often since these insects do not dry quickly,
even in the sun, and therefore are accepted by the birds for longer
periods.
Fledging takes place at 10 " 12 days from hatching, when the
young birds are still not able to fly. Both parents feed them until
weaning, which takes approximately one month. Even when the
young are able to eat seeds, they would still beg for insects from
their parents. Peculiarly however, they seize the insect from the
parent&amp;apos;s beak and eat it by themselves, as if practising how to
handle insects. Before the fledglings are fully independent, the
female already invites the male for copulation, and starts building
a new nest.
Painted Buntings are beautiful birds. They are not often cited
in avicultural literature, because of their breeding requirements
which are similar to those of softbills. I believe that this species
represents an intriguing alternative to more popular and less chal-
lenging seed-eaters. It might be a valuable effort if European
aviculturists could contribute to the general knowledge about its
ethogram and its requirements in captivity. Its behaviour is
complex and its colours are gorgeous, why not dedicate more effort
to establishing it in captivity?

COLONIAL BREEDING OF LESSER PATAGONIAN
CONURES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.986610324324324" page_id="56230714"  page_num="127" year="" vol="">
By W. D. Clarke and Adriana Clarke Marcheggiano,
(Rome, Italy.)
The Lesser Patagonian Conure Cyanoliseus p. patagonus
(Vieillot) is a colourful large parrot, 45 cm. long, with a long tail
and rather small bill. Head, neck, back and scapulars are olive-
brown; rump, upper tail, lower back and underparts are yellow;
thighs and centre of abdomen are orange-red.
There is no sexual dimorphism and young birds closely resemble
adults, the only visible differences being the eye (iris black; it is
yellow in adults) and the upper part of the bill of a distinctly whitish
colour (black in adults).
These conures inhabit open country in the southern part of
central Argentina (I. M. Forshaw 1973, Reichenow 1955), nesting
in colonies in burrows excavated by them in limestone or sandstone
cliff faces.
In the early Autumn of 1990 we found that a local dealer had
imported from Argentina a small number of Lesser Patagonian
Conures and, on impulse (possibly strengthened by the strangely
reasonable price), we bought as many as we could, 16 individuals,
with the secret hope of trying to breed them.
Our birds were all wild-caught adults, and were temporarily
housed in a rather small outdoor aviary 3 x 2 x 2 m. high, where they
very slowly calmed down and began to get accustomed to their new
food and to us. They were so frightened at first that they refused
to eat for the first four days.
We then decided to build a large aviary, specially adapted to
their needs, and planned a 8 x 6 x 2.5 m. high flight.
Taking advantage of a slope in the ground in our garden, we dug
a sort of terrace, so that the north side resulted in a natural wall
2.50 m. high and leaning to this we built a tufa limestone wall.
In the upper part of this wall we made 8 holes 8 x 16 cm high,
connected by 30 cm. long passages to 8 rear cubic &amp;quot;chambers"
measuring (inside) 50 x 50 x 50 m.
These &amp;quot;chambers&amp;quot;, also made of tufa limestone (the cheapest
building material in Latium), were embedded in the ground behind
the wall, with the upper (roof) side resulting 30 cm. below ground
level.

<bodyText confidence="0.976853833333333" page_id="56230715"  page_num="128" year="" vol="">
Of course, in our intention, the &amp;quot;chambers&amp;quot; were to serve as
nests for our conures. On the floor of the &amp;quot;chambers&amp;quot; we put a
15 cm. layer of damp earth. To protect the aviary from rain and cold
we partially covered it with transparent fibre-glass sheets.
Being a self-made aviary it took a very long time to finish and
we at last put the conures in their new home in march 1992. The
birds were immediately attracted by the holes in the wall, much to
our satisfaction, and very soon began to enter them, shortly adopt-
ing the habit of roosting inside the nests. There was no breeding
activity in 1992, as we had expected, the birds having been put in
the new flight too late in the season.
Things changed in 1993, when, after a very severe winter, pairs
began to be easily identified by mutual preening and feeding.
Each pair invariably entered the same nest-hole, defending its
entrance against the other birds. At the end of March the first
mating was observed.
Then followed a very long time without visible news; the birds
just &amp;quot;chattered&amp;quot; more than usual in the afternoon and even at night.
In May and June we observed that a lot more food was taken and that
never more than six birds were out of the nest-holes at the same
time.

a lot of birds out of the nest-holes, and immediately began to round
them: there were 17! Looking closer we soon identified the young
bird by the colour of its bill: whitish instead of black. A more
careful look showed that the young differed from adults also by the
colour of their feet: grey instead of pink, and we could not find this
characteristic described elsewhere in literature.
It was the first young bird to come out, soon to be followed, to
our surprise and delight, by eight more coming out of the nests,
respectively and one by one, on 6th, 16th, 22nd and 25th July and
on 4th, 5th, 16th and 24th August.
All the young birds came out of the nests completely and
perfectly feathered, with no signs of down; they were a bit awkward
when flying for the first two days, very quickly improving and often
re-entering their nest.
The parents were very caring, always near their chick, (see
photo, taken one hour after the first chick came out), specially
assisting in &amp;quot;perching" and &amp;quot;landing&amp;quot;, loudly calling before feeding
the nearby chick (which never uttered a feeding sound) and using
a new call which, curiously, we never did hear in the months in
which the chicks were inside the nests.
On this point, we have observed in many years of breeding
experience with many different genera, that when adult wild-
caught birds finally do breed, there is almost absolutely no sound
and/or activity coming from the nests until the young come out, as
it happens in the wild for protection against predators. On the
contrary, tame pairs of the same species are very vocal and noisy
when breeding and in the nests, not to mention the chicks, often
screaming for food and attention.
It is worth mentioning that after 4 months, it is very difficult to
distinguish young from adults.
Final considerations:
Keeping in a large aviary a number of adult wild-caught,
unmarked and unsexed parrots offers, in our opinion and experi-
ence, the following advantages and, of course, disadvantages.
Advantages:
- after settling down, pair formation is natural, fast and easy
(mutual choice)
- nesting is relatively easily induced when, in a large aviary,
proportioned to the number, species and size of birds housed, a
suitable number of nests of the type used by the species in the
wild (in this case deep holes in a wall) is offered.

THE PARROTBILLS

Among the many groups of birds rarely kept in European and
American avicultural collections, are the Parrotbills, as known in
Indian ornithology, or crowtits, as in Chinese ornithology. With
one exception, this is a group of very distinct passerines with very
short, high-arched bills giving the birds a superficial resemblance
to parrots and none whatsoever to either crows or tits.
Counting the well-known, thin-billed Bearded Reedling Panurus
biarmicus , which certainly belongs with this group, there are at
least 17, at most 24, species the exact number depending upon the
taxonomic viewpoints of those dealing with these birds at species
level.
Parrotbills range geogaphically from the high western
Himalayas eastwards through western China and &amp;quot;Further India&amp;quot; to
East Manchuria, Korea, Taiwan and south to the hills of south
Annam where there is an isolated population of one species; the
northern Panurus has a spotty range in reedbeds from western
Europe to Manchuria and north China. Parrotbills are absent from
the Eurasian tropics, Japan, Africa and Australasia.
Not one species of parrotbill has succeeded in reaching and
establishing itself even in western North America where many
species of birds, mammals and butterflies of unquestioned Eurasian
origin are established, such as the Rosy Finches Leucosticte , the
bighorn sheep Ovis and the Parnassius butterflies Parnassius , to
cite three examples. (It should be noted that the well-known Wren-
tit Chamaea fasciata, of west Oregon and Californian brushlands,
appears to be the New World representative of that Timaliine group
of genera which includes Chrysomma and Moupinia).
With the exception of the two reedbed species - Bearded Reedling
and Heude&amp;apos;s Parrotbill Paradoxornis heudei - these are birds of
subtropical, warm and cool temperate hill and montane forests with
understoreys of bush cover and, most importantly, bamboos of
different species varying in stem thicknesses in the zone where
temperate and tropical Eurasia meet with a most remarkable inter-
mingling of plant and animal species of both temperate and tropical
origins. Only in China, Manchuria and Korea does a non-reedbed
Parrotbill reach the lowlands.

Apart from Panurus in marsh and lacustrine reedbeds in
Turkestanian deserts, no parrotbill occupies any arid region
habitat. Altitudinally, parrotbills range from about 600 m. up to
3600 m. and with some species even up to 4000 m., in the Himala-
yas, western China and the hill tracts of Assam, Burma and the
Indochinese lands; association with bamboos is usual with
parrotbills, though Webb&amp;apos;s P. webbianus appears more eurytopic
than other parrotbills in this respect. The bill of the thick-billed
species (all except Panurus) is adapted to ripping holes in bamboo
stems to extract insects. Lynes (1914) describes this food-getting
method for Heude&amp;apos;s Parrotbill and it is safe to assume that all
parrotbills use the same method for food-getting from bamboos.
Food is insects, seeds and other forms of vegetable matter for all
parrotbills.
In colouration and patterning, parrotbill species are in two
groups. The first, comprises small to medium sized birds which do
not ascend high altitudes (except fulvifrons ), and are patterned in
different colours - browns, light reds and whites being involved
with foreparts including head and throat usually of contrasting
colours including black. Grey crowns are present in five species of
this first group - Panurus biarmicus, Paradoxornis heudei, P.
przewalskii, P. nipalensis and P. gularis. This grey crown appears
to be a &amp;quot;primitive&amp;quot; character which has been lost through browning
or reddening of crown in the species most closely related to
nipalensis - verreauxi , fulvifrons and davidianus , and to gularis -
atrosuperciliaris and ruficeps.
The isolated margaritae of south Annam is the only form of
parrotbill with a black crown; it is very difficult if not impossible
to say whether this black crown was evolved in an isolated popu-
lation, or whether it is a relic from an ancestral parrotbill stock
which had this character, subsequently lost through evolution into
grey then into brown or red. Deignan (1964: 442) treats margaritae
Delacour 1927 as conspecific with gularis Gray 1845. The second
group of parrotbill species including the webbianus complex and
the large species of the oemodius - unicolor - paradoxus species
group, is generally unicoloured without any contrasting patterns
except for greyish head in P.zappeyi which is a west-central
Sichuan endemic apparently nearest to the oemodius group, al-
though about the same size as the birds of the webbianus complex.
Essentially, this second species group is Chinese and high
Himalayan.

yellow to horn and brown; the commisure is strongly sinuated in
some species. Eye-rings are present in the large P. paradoxus and
the small P. conspicillatus - and it should be noted that the depth
of unicolouration tone in the smaller species and also in zappeyi is
the darkish tone of the large parrotbills and not that lighter brown
of the webbianus complex.
In passing, it should be pointed out that Traylor (1967: 54 - 57)
studied the webbianus complex and concluded by suggesting that
three geographically representative species be recognized -
brunneus, webbianus and alphonsianus.
All parrotbills possess four toes on each foot with one excep-
tion: paradoxus. This character neither invalidates the relationship
between paradoxus and unicolor, which form a partially overlap-
ping species-pair, nor warrants the erection of a monospecific
genus Cholornis (Verreaux 1870) upon the strength of this one
character alone. No parrotbill has green or yellow in the plumage
colour.
In life, parrotbills are rather shy, gregarious and skulking birds
moving about in parties through bushes and bamboos with a lack of
inquisitiveness remarkable in a group which has been, and is,
regarded as a subfamily of the Timaliidae - which contains the
laughing thrushes Garrulax , babblers Turdoides and others which
are notoriously noisy, unshy and inquisitive birds. The voice of the
largest species - the Great Parrotbill P. oemodius - has been
described as a harsh croaking like Turdoides ; that of Heude&amp;apos;s has
been only described in winter by Lynes (op.cit.) from flying birds
as a perpetual trill.
The other reedbed species, the Bearded Reedling has the well-
known &amp;quot;ping-ping&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;tic-tic&amp;quot; call notes, well described in the
literature (i.e. Witherby 1938) in addition to churrings which
together with chirrups and bleating sounds appear to be character-
istic call notes of all the Paradoxornis species.
While the nests and eggs of several parrotbill species appear to
be still undescribed, all known nests are deep cups constructed of
reed or bamboo leaves and are sited among reed or bamboo stems
in reedbeds and bamboo thickets, the eggs being white or blue and
white in ground colour. Streaks and specklings of darker colour
have been described as present on the eggs of some species such as
Panurus , the Paradoxornis flavirostris - guttatticollis species pair
and also for P. oemodius.
Though parrotbills are a very distinct group of passerine birds,
being a specialized offshoot from the general Old World insect-

eating flycatcher-warbler-thrush-babbler assemblage, their inter-
nal classification with 11 generic names proposed in the last 150
years and the degree of relationship to other passerine groups have
been subjects of complete disagreement among taxonomists over
the last hundred years as a survey of the literature shows since
Sharp (1882:485-498) recognized five genera of parrotbills in his
Timeliinae. Gadow (1885 77 -78) included Panurus in his Parinae
of the Paridae, concluding with Deignan (1964: 430 - 442), Ali &amp;
Ripley (1971: 195 - 213) and Cheng (1976: 694 - 709) who
recognized only Panurus for the Bearded Reedling, Conostoma for
the Great Parrotbill and Paradoxornis for all the remaining
parrotbills as a subfamily within the Museicapidae.
I am in agreement with this treatment, but question whether
Conostoma should not be synonymized with Paradoxornis as Yen
(1936) did in his review of the whole group except Panurus ; the
Great Parrotbill is very closely related indeed to the P. unicolor -
P . paradoxus species-pair. As for the actions of Hellmayr (1903)
and Hartert (1907) in placing Parrotbills within their Paridae, it can
only be said that their Paridae is an unnatural rag-bag of disparate
groups unrelated to each other - true tits, long-tailed tits, penduline
tits, parrotbills and such Australian groups as the Sphenostoma and
Aphelocephala plus Polioptiia which is an American group includ-
ed for good measure.
An alternative sequence of species within Paradoxornis is
offered commencing with grey-crowned species and concluding
with the oemodius-unicolor-paradoxus group to express my feeling
that this may reflect better the deduced evolutionary history within
the group than the conventional species sequence of Deignan (op.
cit).

BREEDING THE ORANGE-BREASTED FIG PARROT
AT LORO PARQUE
</sectionHeader>

The Orange-breasted Fig Parrot Opopsitta gulielmiterti occurs
naturally on New Guinea, including Salawati in the Papuan Islands,
and also the Aru Islands, Indonesia. Seven subspecies have been
described, although this figure may be in need of a slight revision.
Perhaps the most distinctive is Opopsitta gulielmiterti amabilis ,
which occurs from the North-eastern region of New Guinea. This
subspecies differs very noticeably from others by the fact that adult
males lack the distinctive orange colouration of the breast and
upper abdomen, which is instead pale yellow. The male also lacks
black marking on the ear coverts usually present in other subspe-
cies. The female, by comparison, has the black ear coverts and also
the rich orange breast and upper abdomen coloration, making sex
identification for this subspecies the reverse of the nominate
description and most of the other subspecies.
The Orange-breasted Fig Parrot has been represented in the Loro
Parque collection by the subspecies O. g. amabilis for several
years, although recently these birds have not been on public display
but are accommodated in one of our off-exhibition breeding areas.
One pair of O. g. amabilis at Loro Parque, which are housed in a
breeding cage in one of our off-exhibition areas, successfully
hatched and parent-reared a chick during the early part of the 1994
breeding season. Some of the notes recorded are as follows.
The breeding cage is situated in an off-exhibit area which is not
accessible to members of the visiting public. The cage measures
2.93 metres in length, 1.00 metres in width and 2.36 metres in
height. One end is covered and has solid walls, while the middle
and far end are of more open wire framework design. The birds
have visibility into the adjoining cages, but the pair in question are
not housed within visibility distance of other Opopsitta pairs.
The adult pair are fed throughout the year twice each day - once
early in the morning with a second feed provided during the middle
of the afternoon. In the case of this subspecies, both feeding
periods provide the same foods. A main dish offers a mixture of
various chopped fruits and vegetables, alfalfa, palm fruits and fresh
figs. A second dish, also provided at each feeding period, contains
a commercial dietary pellet, a mixture of small dry millet, niger and

canary seeds, a canine pellet, a special supplement cake which is
made at Loro Parque, and live food in the form of mealworms.
Throughout the year the diet is supplemented with a general
vitamin/mineral powder, plus a small amount of additional Vitamin
K in powder form.
When the time is approaching for chicks to hatch in the nest box
the diet is then supplemented daily with Lactobasillus, a powder
form being sprinkled over the food. This is continued until the
chicks fledge. I have now used similar dietary guidelines to these
to successfully rear both species of Opopsitta and all three species
of Psittaculirostris in captivity.
A choice of three different nesting sites was provided within the
cage. A small conventional shaped nestbox, an L-shaped nest box
and a third nest made from a hollowed out section of palm log. In
the event, the pair selected the conventional style of nest box in
which to breed. It measured 30 cm in height and 15 cm in both
width and length. The entrance hole had a diameter of 5.5 cm. This
nestbox is situated in the more secluded end of the cage, while the
palm log and the L-shaped nestbox are located at the opposite end
of the cage which is more exposed. Wood shavings are used
exclusively to provide a nesting medium within the nestbox.
On 23rd February 1994, the nestbox was inspected and found to
contain two eggs., These were incubated for the full term by the
parents and were not unduly disturbed for inspection until they had
become overdue. On the removal of the eggs from the nestbox they
were examined and found to be infertile.
The next breeding attempt followed in April when the female
again began brooding and the nest box was inspected and found to
contain an egg on 18th April. Two eggs were laid in this clutch and
they were incubated without any cause for concern about the
behaviour of the adult pair. Care was taken during this time to keep
any disturbance to a minimum. On 12th May one chick had
hatched. The second egg failed to hatch and was later removed
from the nestbox.
The single chick seemed strong and developed well with no
specific problems encountered throughout its rearing period. The
nestbox was inspected periodically, but this was undertaken with
great care to cause as little disturbance to the adult pair as possible;
the task was mainly carried out by me.
At the age of 15 days a closed band was fitted to the leg of the
chick, which, by now, was very strong and the parents seemed to be

unconcerned by its handling. The chick first left the nest box on
17th June, although for several subsequent days it continued to
return into the box for short periods of time throughout the day. On
its emergence it resembled the adult female bird, apart from having
generally duller plumage, with lighter coloration on the sides of the
mandible, and by the breast and upper abdomen being a lighter,
more yellowish, shade of orange. The chick continued to be fed by
the adult birds for some time after it fledged, but was first seen to
eat by itself five days after it emerged from the nestbox.
At the time of writing, in early July 1994, a second pair of
O.g.amabilis have now laid eggs and they are currently being
incubated in the nestbox. We believe the chances of further chicks
being reared during 1994 are very good.
The population of O. g. amabilis at Loro Parque is growing each
year and it is our intention to form new pairs from the birds reared.
It is also our intention that a pair of Opopsitta qulielmiterti will
soon be placed upon public display in the Parque - once a new area
of aviaries has been constructed especially for Fig Parrots (Opopsitta
and Psittaculirostris genera) that will allow all five species to be
housed together and bred on public display.
In the case of O. g. amabilis , great effort will be needed by those
working with this bird in aviculture if it is to become established.
To date, very few successful captive breeding results have been
recorded. Continued success at Loro Parque will soon require that
new blood lines need to be introduced into our breeding group and
I would certainly be interested in communication with any avicul-
turists who are successfully breeding this subspecies and who
would be willing to undertake blood line exchanges of captive-bred
birds. There can be few more interesting and captivating psittacines
to maintain than the Orange-breasted Fig Parrot. Its beauty,
personality and intricate behaviour provide endless interest and
every effort should be made to ensure that the very limited number
of birds currently maintained in aviculture are properly cared for
and are the basis for a potentially self-sustaining captive popula-
tion.
This is a realistic goal, and it will require close co-operation and
communication between everyone working with the species, I
would welcome any correspondence from other aviculturists main-
taining these birds at present.

Many new developments at Chester were initiated or completed
last year. Our major project was in designing and developing the
new &amp;apos;Europe on the Edge&amp;apos; exhibit. This exciting new aviary has
been built on the site of the previous Polar bear and adjacent
waterfowl enclosures. It features a massive cliff face with nesting
areas and caves and a waterfall cascading into a river which then
flows into a reed fringed pond. The enclosure occupies a ground
space of approximately 2000 sq. metres and is tented over with 2&amp;quot;
mesh polythene netting suspended from five flag poles, the tallest
of which reach up to 12 metres.
The most important occupants of the aviary are the pair of
European Black Vultures Aegypius monachus. These were moved
into the new aviary in August and other species then added in turn.
First we introduced White Storks Ciconia ciconia together with
Demoiselle Cranes Anthropoides virgo and later Little Egrets
Egretta garzetta , Red-crested Pochard Netta rufina , Marbled Teal
Marmaronetta angustirostris and Waldrapp Ibis Geronticus eremita.
Most recently a pair of Red-billed Choughs Pyrrhocorax
pyrrhocorax have been released into this flight and we hope to add
waders including European Stone Curlews Burhinus oedicnemus
this spring.
Other new developments in 1993 included the completion of an
extremely spacious new aviary for Mauritius Kestrels Falco punc-
tatus and four new owl aviaries. We were delighted to receive a
pair of Mauritius Kestrels bred at Jersey Wildlife Preservation
Trust in 1993 and look forward to working with these birds in 1994.
We have also just started a major new reconstruction of the lower
aviaries in the Tropical House. These are being effectively doubled
in size by now reaching up to the top of the upper balcony and being
extended further out from the wall of the Tropical House. &amp;apos;Always
building* was our founder George Mottershead&amp;apos;s motto for Chester
Zoo and it is excellent to see this being continued.
New species to arrive in 1993, additional to those already

Garrulax galbanus (a pair bred at Leeds Castle and three from
Raymond Sawyer). We also received on loan a pair of Secretary
Birds Sagittarius serpentarius (the male from Marwell Zoo, the
female from the Tropical Bird Gardens, Rode) and a pair of Illiger&amp;apos;s
Macaws Ara maracana from Mr. Jim Matthews. I was pleased to
have the Illiger&amp;apos;s on breeding loan at Chester having enjoyed seeing
these delightful macaws in the wild in Brazil. We are also most
grateful to Mr. Jim Murray who donated a group of Gouldian
Finches Chloebia gouldiae to the Zoo.
Amongst our many &amp;apos;adopters&amp;apos; were the Amazona Society U.K.
who adopted our Lilacine Amazons Amazona autumnalis lilacina.
This was particularly appropriate in that the European EEP Lilacine
Studbook is now run from Chester by Mark Pilgrim and that we had
our first breeding success with Lilacines this year. Two chicks
were successfully reared by their parents, one has now been placed
at Bristol Zoo and the other at Banham Zoo. Other parrots parent-
reared in 1993 included Red-fronted Macaws Ara rubrogenys , Blue
and Yellow Macaws A ra ararauna , Greater Vasa Parrots Coracopsis
vasa, Lesser Vasa Parrots Coracopsis nigra , Lesser Patagonian
Conures Cyanoliseus patagonus , Red-masked Conure Aratinga

We were especially pleased that our second pair of Blue and
Yellow Macaws were successful in their first breeding attempt.
The female of this pair was five years old having been bred at
Chester in 1988. We are hoping that our recently established
second pair of Red-fronted Macaws, which also includes a Chester-
bred female, may soon follow suit. All three pairs of Blue-eyed
Cockatoos Cacatua ophthalmica laid eggs in 1993 but none were
successful in rearing their own chicks. Our most recently estab-
lished pair (which includes a Chester-bred female and which
successfully reared a chick on their first attempt in 1990) have
since taken to breaking their eggs. Another pair kept in the Parrot
House sit tight but have not hatched chicks for ten years. Two of
their eggs were transferred to the incubator this year but although
one hatched, the chick was weak and failed to survive. The chick
was unusual in having white down rather than the yellow down of
other chicks. However that pair was successful in hatching an egg
fostered under them from our third pair and this chick was success-
fully reared by them. Another six chicks were incubator hatched
and four of these successfully hand-reared; one died at less than a
month old and another on weaning.

Superb Fruit Doves Ptilinopus superbus were bred for the first
time at Chester, a single chick being parent-reared. Other pigeons
bred in 1993 included Luzon Bleeding Heart Doves Galiicoiumba
luzonica , Celebes Quail Doves Galiicoiumba tristigmata and Moun-
tain Witch Doves Geotrygon versicolor. Common Bronzewings
Phaps chalcoptera on loan from the Tropical Bird Gardens, Rode,
were also bred in 1993.
The demolition and rebuilding of the largest block of owl
aviaries was completed without major disturbance of our breeding
stock. White-faced Scops Owls Otus leucotis reared a brood of four
charming youngsters and Snowy Owls Nyctea scandiaca and Barn
Owls Tyto alba were also bred. An Andean Condor Vultur gryphus
was puppet-reared - the 10th in recent years. Trumpeter Hornbills
Bycanistes buccinator reared a brood of three chicks and our
African Grey Hornbills Tockus nasutus produced seven chicks in
two rounds. Whilst the female African Grey Hornbill was sealed in
the nest with our first brood of chicks the male escaped from his
aviary into the free-flight area of the Tropical House. Until he was
eventually re-caught the male's role was taken by the keepers who
fed the female in the nest. She accepted this without any of our
anticipated problems and five fine chicks eventually fledged. Our
female Great Indian Hornbill Buceros bicornis again sealed herself
into the nest but her two month incarceration failed to result in the
much anticipated breeding success. Instead she emerged in a very
dirty and very weak condition from a disgustingly filthy barrel.
Without the assistance of the keepers she would probably have been
unable to complete her escape. Her barrel has now been replaced
by another one with its entrance towards the bottom rather than the
top. This nest design is based on the one sucessfully used at
Avifauna in the Netherlands and should permit the female to more
easily avoid her faeces outside the barrel. We hope the pair will
accept this new nest this coming breeding season. The Wrinkled
Hornbills Acer os corrugatus again hatched a chick in their aviary
in the Bird House and reared this to almost two months old. We
were extremely disappointed when this well developed chick died
in the nest. Post mortem indicated pneumonia as the cause of death.
Again we intend to make a number of changes in 1994 but if still
unsuccessful will then try the pair in one of the new aviaries
presently under construction in the Tropical Houses.
Our original pair of Channel-billed Toucans Ramp has to s
vitellinus which first bred in 1989 again had two rounds of chicks
in 1993. Three were fledged from their first brood and two from the

second brood taking the total now reared by this pair to fourteen
youngsters. Neither our second pair of Channel-bills (which
includes a Chester-bred female) nor our Toco Toucans Ramphastos
toco have yet attempted to nest.
Red-crested Touracos Tauraco erythropus hatched but failed to
rear a chick. Schalow&amp;apos;s Touracos Tauraco schalowi hatched two
broods of chicks but because of aggression between the parents
during the nestling periods these had to be removed and finished off
by hand-rearing. Four Schalow's were successfully reared using
this procedure.
The Kookaburras Dacelo novaeguineac reared a single chick
without assistance but because of losses in previous years we
elected to remove the chicks of Red-billed Magpies Urocissa
erthrorhyncha and the Azure-winged Magpies Cyanopica cyana
when 7-10 days old so they could be effectively treated for
gapeworm Syngamus and kept free from re-infection. Four Red-
billed Magpies, four Azure-winged Magpies and one Rothschilds
Mynah Leucopsar rothschildi were reared in this way. Other
passerines bred included Fairy Bluebirds Irena puella, Silver-
beaked Tanagers Ramphocelus carbo, Silver-eared Mesias Leiothrix
argentauris, Red-eared Bulbuls Pycnonotus jocosus, Superb Spreo
Starlings Spreo superbus, Emerald Starlings Lamprocolius iris,
Java Sparrows Padda oryzivora and Mexican Housefinches Carpo-
dacus mexicanus. White-headed Buffalo Weavers Dinemellia
dinemelli , Royal Starlings Cosmopsarus regius. Red-tailed Laugh-
ing Thrushes Garrulax milnei. Red-cheeked Cordon Bleu Uraegin-
thus bengalus and Orange-cheeked Waxbills Estrilda melpoda all
hatched chicks but were unsuccessful in rearing them in 1993.
Waterfowl reared in 1993 included Hawaiian Geese Branta
sandvicensis. Ruddy-headed Goose Chloephaga rubidiceps. Em-
peror Goose Anser canagicus. Fulvous Tree Duck Dendrocygna
bicolor. White-winged Wood Duck Cairina scutulata, Laysan Teal
Anas laysanensis. Ringed Teal Anas leucophrys. Marbled Teal ,
Tufted Duck Aythya fuligula. Red-crested Pochard , Rosy-billed
Pochard Nettapeposaca. Mandarin Duck Aixgalericulata, Caroli-
na Duck Aix sponsa and Hooded Mergansers Mergus cucullatus.
Few of each species were reared as there now seems to be little
demand for these waterfowl. Black-necked Swans Cygnus
melanocoryphus hatched their own cygnets but failed to rear these
and although one Smew 7 Mergus albellus was incubator hatched this
was not reared. Good numbers of several pheasant species were
reared but we discovered it was difficult to place many of these at

the end of the season and as with waterfowl intend to set fewer eggs
in 1994. Pheasants reared in 1993 include Satyr Tragopans Tragopan
satyra, Temminck&amp;apos;s Tragopan Tragopan temminckii , Himalayan
Monals Lophophorus impeyanus , Brown Eared Pheasants
Crossoptilon mantchuricum, Grey Peacock Pheasants Polyplectron
bicalcaratum, Golden Pheasants Chrysolophuspictus and Edward&amp;apos;s
Pheasants Lophura edwardsi. Satyr Tragopans and Temmincks
Tragopans were allowed to sit and rear their third broods. This was
good for them and especially enjoyed by many of our zoo visitors.
We currently hold five species of cranes: Red-crowned Cranes
Grus japonensis , White-naped Cranes Grus vipio , Wattled Cranes
Bugeranus carunculatus , West African Crowned Cranes Balearica
pavonina and Demoiselle Cranes Anthropoides virgo. All five
species laid in 1993 but eggs were infertile for all except the Red-
crowned Cranes which again reared their own chick. More success
was obtained with the Flamingos; six Caribbean Flamingos
Phoenicopterus ruber ruber and one Chilean Flamingo
Phoenicopterus chilensis were reared. One pair of Caribbean
Flamingos which nested for the first time this year hatched but then
abandoned their chick. This chick was taken from the nest in an
apparent comatose condition but soon recovered and was hand-
reared using an adaptation of the diet developed at San Antonio Zoo
(for details see Kunnermann &amp; Perry 1990). In our first few years
working with Waldrapp Ibis we found that all chicks hatched by our
birds died within a few days of hatching. Having now gone through
a sequence of years of first hand-rearing then suppplementary
feeding Waldrapp Ibis chicks in the nest, we felt our adults were
now sufficiently experienced to risk leaving them to attempt to rear
chicks without our assistance. We were delighted that of twelve
chicks hatched in our colony all but one were successfully parent-
reared. As mentioned at the beginning of this article a number of
the Waldrapps including one family party have since been trans-
ferred to the &amp;apos;Europe on the Edge&amp;apos; exhibit. We look forward to
observing how they adapt to this large mixed aviary where they may
face challenges more similar to those in the wild.

In the 1970s a considerable number of species of lories, fig
parrots and Amazons became available in aviculture for the first
time. It was an exciting era, the like of which we will never see
again. Indeed, the ethical aspects of importing wild-caught birds
are now considered in a different light. Few would wish to return
to the days of mass importation. Aviculturists must now be self-
sufficient and never again rely on the importer as a source of stock.
We must value the wild-caught birds in our care more highly for
they are the founder stock whose offspring will be available to
many generations of aviculturists.
So these days we do not expect new species to be introduced to
aviculture. Yet in 1990 the Fiery-shouldered Conure Pyrrhura
egregia appeared in Europe, almost certainly for the first time. It
is a member of a family of small conures which have much to
recommend them. They have attractive personalities, they nest
readily and, unlike other conures, they are not noisy.
There are more brightly coloured species of Pyrrhura but the
feature which gives egregia its name is very striking. The bend of
the wing is fiery orange and the carpal edge is yellow-orange. Its
real beauty is appreciated when it opens its wings; the greater under
wing coverts are yellow and the lesser coverts are orange.
The crown is dark brown and there are a few flecks of dark red
on the ear coverts. (I have not seen one like that depicted by
William Cooper in Parrots of the World which has the ear coverts
actually red.) Feathers of the lower neck and upper breast are
scalloped with grey and white and those of the lower breast are grey
margined with faint yellow. The abdomen is green indistinctly
marked with maroon and there is a tinge of maroon around the vent.
(The breast markings on Cooper&amp;apos;s bird are not really true to life.)
Primaries and secondaries are blue. The tail is dark reddish-brown
above and blackish tinged with red-brown below.
It is the only Pyrrhura known in aviculture which has a light-
coloured beak; the beak is ivory, the cere whitish, the iris brown
and the feet grey. The skin surrounding the eye is white and quite
extensive. Length is 25 cm (10 in). Weight is about 70 g. Of two
adult pairs weighed, both the males weighed 73 g., one female
weighted 69 g. and the other female 75 g. Most Pyrrhuras with

which I am familiar can be weight-sexed; males are slightly heavier
with the exception of the Blue-throated Conure P.cruentata in
which the female is heavier than the male. (She is also dominant!)
In appearance, the Fiery-shouldered is, in my opinion, closest to
the sub-species chapmani of the Maroon-tailed Conure Pyrrhura
melanura. However, the latter has red under wing coverts and
carpal edge of wing.
The Fiery-shouldered Conure has a small range, being found in
the region of the borders of Venezuela, Guyana and Brazil (extreme
north-east Roraima). It occurs only in the isolated, flat-topped
mountains, which are called tepuis, in forested areas. It lives in the
tropical and sub-tropical zone, usually at altitudes between 700 m.
and 1,800 m. The reason why this conure remained unknown in
aviculture for so long is that this area is difficult to invade.
According to Robert Ridgely, one of the most experienced ornitho-
logical field workers in the region, it is &amp;quot;seemingly quite common
within its small range.&amp;quot; Its population is believed to be stable.
The small captive population is probably increasing. I have
been told of breeding successes in Switzerland and Germany.
Certainly one of the two pairs in my care lost no time in the race to
reproduce. They were still in quarantine when the first egg was
laid! Each pair (previously surgically sexed) was housed in a small
cage measuring 102 cm. (3ft. 4 in.) long, 51 cm. (20 in.) wide and
77 cm. (2 ft. 6 in.) high. The nest-boxes provided measured
(internal dimensions) 30 cm. (12 in.) long, 17 cm. (7 in.) wide and
20 cm. (8 in.) high. Inside, a small wooden shelf was fitted under
the entrance home and 8 cm. (3 in.) above the floor; it was 10 cm.
(4 in.) long. This prevents a bird entering the nest from dropping
down on to the eggs, it gives a measure of privacy to females who
prefer to incubate underneath and the young ones can sit on the
board and look out before fledging. The nest can be inspected by
means of the hinged flap at one end.
The birds had arrived on 1st April and one female laid her first
egg on 28th April. There were two eggs by 1st May, three by 4th
May, four by 6th May and the fifth was laid before 10th May. The
date of the sixth egg was unknown because the female was incubat-
ing so tightly.
It was not possible to mark the eggs, thus I could not record the
exact incubation period. What I believed was the third egg was
opened by the parents and contained a chick which was full-term
dead-in-shell. This was very disappointing but a short while later,
on 1st June, there was a chick in the nest, followed the next day by

a second. If it was the fourth egg which hatched first, the incuba-
tion period would have been 26 days which would be a long period
for a Pyrrhura. Probably it was the fifth egg, to give an incubation
period of 23 days for the first egg, if the chick hatched the previous
evening. In the climate of Gran Canaria, most Pyrrhuras hatch
after 22 days with a day or two longer sometimes recorded for the
first egg in the clutch.
The female was extremely protective of the small chicks, thus
she was not disturbed for weights and descriptions to be recorded.
Not until the eldest was 16 days old and had to be ringed (with a 5.5
mm. ring) were the chicks removed and photographed. At this age
they are at their least attractive, with the second down starting to
erupt in little white blobs on body and wings. Not much of the first
down remains. Upper mandible and feet were pink.
Three days later the orange feathers at the bend of the wing and
two or three of the orange wing coverts were starting to erupt. The
development of the youngest chick was several days behind that of
the other. When the eldest was 22 days its flight and tail feathers
were just breaking through the sheaths.
At 28 days both looked beautiful. The crown was dull green, the
cheeks brighter green and the bend of the wing was quite brilliant
orange. Scapulars and secondary coverts were bright green. The
tail of the eldest was about one third the full length, the dark brown
feathers being tipped with blackish. Much dense whitish-grey
down was apparent, denser than in other Pyrrhuras with which I am
familiar. The beak was still pinkish with brown at the base of the
upper mandible. The beak pads were white.
The young were fully feathered a week later, both with an
extensive area of yellow and orange at the bend of the wing. In
Parrots of the World , Forshaw states that in immature birds the
colour in that area is &amp;quot;much reduced&amp;quot; but this did not apply to these
two. At 54 days the eldest differed from the parents only in the dark
base of the upper mandible and in the light feet.
The eldest youngster left the nest during the last week in July.
For several days before, the second stayed at the back of the nest-
box, behind its sibling. I do not handle chicks just before they are
due to leave the nest because of the likelihood of them leaving the
nest prematurely. On 29th July, when it was 57 days old, it was
apparent that the youngest was weak. It was removed from the nest
for hand-feeding and medication but sadly it died the next day. The
cause of death could not be established. The eldest youngster is
now nine months old and indistinguishable from the adults.

Mention should be made of the diet of this species. It eats most
seeds, fruits and vegetables offered. When the young were being
reared, extra fruit and sunflower seed were consumed, also cuttle-
fish bone. I would suggest that fruit and vegetables should form at
least 40% of the maintenance diet.
It may be that no more wild-caught Fiery-shouldered Conures
will be available. The few aviculturists currently fortunate enough
to keep egregia must pair them with care, avoiding in-breeding, if
the species is to have any future in aviculture. A stud-book, or a
European alliance of breeders would increase the chances of its
long-term survival.
Let us hope that its numbers will grow to the degree that all
lovers of Pyrrhuras will eventually have a chance to keep it.

Gurney&amp;apos;s aviaries. I was delighted, when last August I arrived at
Keswick to find that their number had more than doubled ... The
aviaries are built in three groups: the oldest one is in a small garden
surrounded by walls. There is a central path, on the right side of
which is a long and large aviary inhabited by Black-necked Ibises,
Cattle Egrets, Oystercatchers, Ruffs and Reeves ... Alpine Choughs,
Crested Pigeons and Dominican Cardinals. On the left side one
finds six smaller aviaries, all with heated shelters ... the first one
is stocked with many small birds, mainly Finches and Weavers, one
White-crowned Plover and a rare South American Whimbrel... the
last one, very roomy, with three Tiger Bitterns.

'... the second group of aviaries, also surrounded by walls, is
newer and larger... These birds, in the day time, walk about the
garden and paths between the aviaries: there are pairs of Dusky
Trumpeters, Razor-billed Curassows, Pileated Guans, a Screamer,
an American Wood Ibis and various Guinea Fowls...
'On the left a very nice aviary... has been erected inside a
greenhouse: there are males of the lovely Elliot&amp;apos;s Pitta, Bellbird,
Fairy Bluebirds, several Tanagers and Bulbuls. In cages, a few
small Parrots, one very old Golden-fronted Bulbul, a Black-col-

'My Pheasant collection is more or less complete. I have ... four
species of Polyplectron : Palawan, Bronze-tailed, Germain&amp;apos;s and
Ghigi&amp;apos;s Grey; a pair of the latter gave, this season, eight clutches
of two eggs, rearing six young. We also reared to full size one
Rheinart, for the first time in Europe... The hen, which had been
kept out of doors the whole winter, started laying on 3rd may, again
on 22nd May and 12th June... Incubation lasts twenty-five days. I
had a pair of Bulwer&amp;apos;s Pheasants, but the cock died suddenly and I
do not like the look of the hen. I find that the Fireback group do not
do well at Cleres and it is not worth while keeping them here,
although I still possess pairs of the rare Bornean Crestless and of my
own Fireback Lophura delacouri. But I now intend having them
kept for me in the sunny south of France.

four unfertile eggs. In 1931 she laid five, three of which hatched
and two young were reared... An imported pair of Mikado Pheas-
ants produced thirteen young ones in 1930, and the same number
again in 1931. This fine species from Formosa does not seem to
breed before two years old. I have just obtained another pair from
Formosa which will enable me to renew the blood.
'I also own some wild-caught, and therefore pure-blooded,
Amherst Pheasants which I brought in 1930 from Yunnan. The
wonderful Blue Crossoptilons sent to me in 1929 by Mr. Hampe
being all males, hybrids with the brown species were reared last
year and look almost like pure blue ones. One of these 1930 hybrid
hens bred, in 1931, two young ones with a pure blue cock; these are
indistinguishable from their father. In 1930 we reared some
Soemmerring&amp;apos;s Pheasants, a few of which escaped from their coop
and have become established in the woods, where they are occa-
sionally seen, together with some Bel&amp;apos;s Kalij... During these two
breeding seasons we also reared a fair number of... Brown Cross-
optilon, Elliot&amp;apos;s, Edwards&amp;apos;, Imperial, Black-crested Kalij, Horsfield,
Versicolor... Madagascar Guineafowl... Some Doves and Pigeons
were bred: Diamond, Australian Crested, Bronze-winged, Jobi and
Marquesa rubesecens , and, for the first time since I have kept birds,
one Nicobar Pigeon. To my surprise the young one remained nearly
six weeks in the nest, till quite fully grown.
/The collection of Waterfowl is better than it ever was, although
I must admit I have no more Pink-headed Ducks, Pigmy Geese,
African Black Ducks, White-backed Ducks or Hottentot Teal... In
1931 a pair of South African Shelldrakes produced six young ones,
and we reared one curious hybrid Rajah x Ruddy Shelldrake in size
and shape: dark reddish brown, with white head and neck. Also we
had a few Madagascar White-eyes and Meller&amp;apos;s Ducks.
'Sea Ducks are doing very well on our clear running water.
There are fifteen Eider and two Barrow&amp;apos;s Golden-eyes, which feed
greedily on grain and mash, with dried meat. One pair of Common
Scoters have now lived for over three years and keep perfect
condition, but they seem to thrive on natural food only, while a
male Velvet Scoter, wounded at sea in August, has quite recovered
and looks perfect; it has become fairly tame and feeds freely on
grain and mash...
'I am sorry to say that the old Sarus which had been free-flying
for more than ten years met with its death last summer, as it struck
a high-tension electric cable, some distance from the park'.

was out of the nest flying well enough. The weaker one also came
out, but ... was drowned on 5th June, after having been flying well
for several days. Both parents fed the remaining young bird
devotedly, and did not abandon and bully it as I had feared, as the
mother had started laying again in the old nest on the 31 st, while the
cock began another nest, further away ... the hen laid every day, as
many as ten eggs, by 12th June. She insisted on laying in the old
nest, and all but one egg dropped on the ground ... The cock had
by then completed the new nest and would not go to the old one
again. The birds were not sitting. On 13th June I removed the old
nest and put eight eggs into the new one (I thought ten were too
many). Very docile, the hen went to the new nest and incubation
started immediately. Two eggs, probably addled, were rejected
after a few days. At the same time, both parents continued feeding
their first young, now quite strong, and eating also by himself since
12th June. However, on the 21st, I took him by hand (he is very
tame) and removed him into another compartment, where he now
lives happily.'

Oxford, the four young Pittas were out of the nest, and they all have
been fully reared.
'But we now come to the sad end of the story, and we shall see
that, like the Thrushes, Pittas have the most wicked and puzzling
temper.
&amp;apos;As soon as the young ones had left the nest, the cock Pitta,
whose plumage, and especially the quills, were in a very worn state,
started at once building another nest... [which] by 15th July ... was
almost completed. I noticed that day there was a fight between the
two parents, but I thought it was only, as usual, an introduction to
their mating, and paid little attention to it. The next day the hen was
chasing the cock, who kept hidden most of the time, and I decided
to keep a special watch... I went into the greenhouse every hour or
so, to see how matters were going on; it was very much the same.
But at the end of the day the male was found dead in the pond!

the young ones and still is looking after them most devotedly to this
day...'

'In most parts of South America one sees along streams and
ditches, and even in towns and gardens, some very pretty white,
grey and black birds which remind one of our Wagtails...
'They are Water-Tyrants of the genus Fluvicola. Many years
ago I saw many of the White-shouldered species, Fluvicola pica in
Guiana and Venezuela, and I was very much struck with their
attractive appearance. But I was told that they could not live in
captivity. Fortunately M. C. Cordier, of Pernambuco, has found the
way of keeping most Brazilian birds alive in his aviaries, and
afterwards to send them to us.
'I got my first Water-Tyrants F. climazura more than two years
ago. They arrived, it is true to say, in poor condition, and only two
survived. Let out in one of my tropical houses, they soon settled
down and enjoyed immensely the stones and water lilies of the
pond. They proved tame and harmless to other birds. But they
probably were of the same sex, as after over a year no attempt at
breeding took place. They are purely insectivorous birds and take
readily to the usual mixture, a little raw meat and a few meal-
worms.
'Last summer I received two more specimens which, after they
sufficiently recovered, were let out with the first two. Things did
not go smoothly; fights took place and after some time two were
killed. The two remaining birds were evidently a pair.
'Early last winter they started carrying moss and small twigs and
soon built a purse-shaped nest, rather loosely made, in a creeper at
a height of 8 feet overhanging the pond... but after about twelve
days the nest was found to be empty and one broken egg, containing
a well-developed chick, was found at some distance on the soil.
'Soon after another nest was built, in another creeper 2 yards
away from the first one and higher up still. Eggs were laid again
and, on 25th February, two young Tyrants left the nest... One chick
was weak and died after three days, being found in the pond. The
other one developed normally, and it is now indistinguishable from
the parents. The young were reared quite easily on the parents&amp;apos; diet.
'A third clutch was laid in the same nest in May, and on the 26th
three strong young ones came out. They are now in perfect health
and although they have had a new brood the parents have never so

far molested their first baby. It is the more remarkable that they try
to attack savagely a newly imported specimen in a neighbouring
aviary.
'As Mr. de Quincy tells me, these Water Tyrants are quite hardy,
and his pair wintered safely out of doors this year. They also bred
but the young died soon after they came out of the nest. There is
no doubt that tropical birds have a much better chance to rear their
offspring when always kept at a favourable and even temperature,
as is the case in my greenhouses.
'Three years ago a pair of Shamas reared two full broods without
losses in one of the compartments; and one knows that, although
they nest freely, the young are not too easy to breed in an outdoor
aviary. Also it may interest our readers to hear that my Hooded
Pittas have young again. The breeding pair is composed of the old
hen and one of her sons bred last year...'

'In the outdoor aviaries, we had a number of young of the Forest
Foudij [sic] Foudia omissa , the rarer of the two red Madagascar
Weavers. Also, for almost the first time in the fifteen years that
they have lived in their aviary. Pekin Robins reared a brood of four,
and perhaps more, as nests were overlooked, and they seem to be
now so numerous than before.
'Some Whydahs and Weavers also nested, but I do not know
quite which species actually succeeded.'

November, the cocks still are in full colour. I keep these Whydahs,
as well as Queen, Pintail, Steel and Paradise, in large aviaries

Whydahs may some day lay in their nests...

'For an Old World aviculturist, one collection is of very great
interest, that of Mr. Eric Kinsey, at Manor, in a cool and shady
canyon of Marin County, north of the Bay of San Francisco. Mr.
Kinsey, the president of the Cooper Club, is an excellent ornithol-
ogist, who knows as much of wild Californian birds as anyone on
earth. But, quite rightly, he believes that there is a great deal more
to be learned of the habits and behaviour of birds by keeping them
in captivity... Mr. Kinsey has specialised on Californian Passerine
birds, and keeps no others, except a few Anna and Allen&amp;apos;s Hum-
ming-birds. Of course, he can only do so by enjoying a special
scientific permit from the Federal Government and the State of
California... I spent several days up country with Mr.. Kinsey to

such lovely species as Western and Mountain Bluebirds'.

two male Velvet Scoters Oedemia fusca from the sea shore near the
Somme estuary. He had been endeavouring for some time to
procure for me some of these interesting birds alive, by shooting
them slightly in the neck, at long range, with very small shot. Both
birds arrived in fairly good condition, but of course with rather stiff
necks. One survived only a few months, while the other one
gradually improved, and eventually recovered completely. Let out
on the lake, the bird soon became very tame and greedy...
'... the Velvet Scoter looked perfect, till about a year ago, when
he began to show signs of old age; the nail of its bill grew too long,

is fortunately staying at Cleres, and is able to carry on with a

the district, though on military duty, so that I can see my birds at
frequent intervals.
'For the moment we have decided to keep the whole of the
collection, only thinning out gradually to a couple of pairs the more
ordinary species of Pheasants, waterfowl, and small birds, or even
suppressing the very common ones altogether'.

up to an Australian, which had reared many young in the past, laid
late, and did not hatch. One Manchurian was reared...

'In the greenhouses, an Elliot&amp;apos;s Pitta and seven Indo-Chinese
Shamas (two broods) were successfully bred. White-capped Red-
starts nested several times without result, proving extremely spite-
ful during the season. A pair of Garnet-throated Humming Birds
built a lovely nest in an hibiscus tree, but did not go any further.
'Now, all the birds have been removed from greenhouses to
bird-rooms, as it would have been very difficult to obtain coal to
heat them during the winter. The rarer plants have been deposited
at the Rouen Botanical Gardens, and I hope to be able to replant the
houses when the war is over. It was very heart-breaking to me to
close these houses, which were so attractive in every way; this is the
only noticeable difference that the war has made to Cleres so far...'

endeavour to see them safely throughout the present war'.

'When last I saw it, on 7th June, 1940, some thirty bombs,
dropped a fortnight before, already had marred its appearance in
many places and several hundred birds and mammals had been
killed. I was then ordered away with my army unit and I have not
seen Cleres since.
'But I know that on the day I left, as well as on those immedi-
ately after, the park suffered greatly from further bombings, as well
as machine-gunning from the air. Four people, as well as many
more birds and animals, were killed.

loss of still more birds and animals. Some of these escaped through
doors left open, while others mixed with different species and were

killed in the ensuing fighting. However, the Germans permitted
three of my men, who had remained near by, to return and care for
what was left... But naturally in the interim all the more delicate
species, including the Birds of Paradise, the Humming Birds,
Sunbirds and those of insectivorous habit, had died of starvation.
'Mr. F. Fooks, who for twenty years had taken care of my
collection and managed my estate with the utmost zeal and devo-
tion ... had wanted to stay on at any price and against my advice.
But on 8th June, having moved some of the rarer birds to a place of
supposed safety further west, he found he could not re-cross the
Seine and so was cut off from Cleres.
... Some days later we met by luck at the home of an old friend
and bird lover, M. A. Decoux, near Limoges in Central Frances,
whose fine collection of Parrakeets, Doves and small birds, I am
glad to say, is still intact and so far unmolested.
'Here Mr. Fooks and I parted. As I watched him, his French wife
and his children depart in a car driven by one of my sergeants, I
realised that the last connecting link between me and what had been
my life for many years had been severed. The Fooks family
eventually arrived safely in England after a perilous journey, while
I went to Agen, in South-western France. Here I was demobilised
on 20th July. My small part in the defence of France was finished'.

Captain Delacour&amp;apos;s years in New York have been discussed in
some detail in a previous number of this magazine (Lindholm,
1988).
6 1 have spent an early June weekend in the country with my
friends, Mr. and Mrs. Milton Erlanger, and for the first time in
many months I have had the time, and everlasting pleasure, to
watch aviary birds. This may sound strange, as my present position
of Technical Adviser to the New York Zoological Park gives me the
control of the mammals, birds and reptiles, and our collection of
birds is the best now existing, numbering 1,800 specimens of 700
species, about half of which are perching birds. But my duties are
many and absorbing, with planning, committee meetings, and
office work, and I have little time to do more than quickly examine
the birds in our zoo. Mr. Lee Crandall, the Curator, and Head
Keeper George Scott, themselves overworked, are both excellent
aviculturists, and I rely on them to take care of our birds. Although
we almost entirely lack suitable outdoor accommodation, so neces-
sary to many species, the condition of our collection is excellent,
the longevity of our birds being quite remarkable, with losses at a
minimum. But, as I have just said, our outdoor flights are almost
non-existing, a deplorable state of affairs which would already
have been remedied if the war had not brought in additional
difficulties...'

'For more than ten years it has always been a thrilling experi-
ence to see Mr. C, Cordier arrive with a collection of birds. It
happens once or twice a year. Until 1939 he used to bring his
collection to Cleres, and the surplus material found its way mostly
to the London Zoo, to Mr. A. Ezra and Mr. Spedan Lewis in
England, and to Dr. E. Beraint and M. Francois Edmond-Blanc in
France. Those happy days are over, alas! But Mr. Cordier still
brings his collections, now to the United States. He brought us, to
the New York Zoological Park, a marvellous Colombian collection
in December, 1941, and early in October 1942, he was back again,
this time from Costa Rica, with perhaps the finest lot of birds he has
ever secured.
'There are ninety-six birds in the collection, including three
Umbrella Birds which have never before been exhibited alive.
Fifty-four Humming Birds of which the majority have never been
imported anywhere, and eighteen Quetzels'.

'We had to dispose of some of the Quetzals, keeping ten for our
collection. For the first time, I saw perfect specimens... tame and
feeding well. Six inhabit a large planted aviary, and although there
are several adult males, they never quarrel; neither do they molest
the small birds, mostly Sugarbirds and Tanagers, which share their
flight. The Umbrella Birds are also extremely tame and harmless.
'We are now completing the transformation of our halls, where
pigeons and Parrots used to be kept in rather old-fashioned and ugly
cages. We are making five long planted flights of different styles,
more or less in the same way as the greenhouse aviaries at Cleres
were planned. One has a fast-running stream and is called the
&amp;quot;Tropical American mountain stream&amp;quot;. It contains some Blue-
headed and Ruddy Buntings, a small South American Barbet, a
dozen Manakins and Sugarbirds, a few small Tanagers, and a pair
of Fire-throated Humming Birds Panterpe. The next one is an
&amp;quot;Indian-Malayan jungle&amp;quot;; there live some small Fruit Pigeons,
Green-wings and Bleeding Heart Doves, a Pitta, a Rothschild&amp;apos;s
Starling, a Shama, a small Javan Barbet, some bulbuls and Bab-
blers, a few Timor Paddas and Crested Buntings.
'The other three, which will soon be completed, will be a
&amp;quot;desert!&amp;quot;, an &amp;quot;American Garden&amp;quot;; and a &amp;quot;Tropical American Rain
forest&amp;quot;. It is great fun designing and planting these aviaries. I find
it the best substitute to the pleasure I so long used to have at Cleres
on a larger scale'.

with chicken or dog-biscuit meal. If properly done there should be
nothing sticky or wet about this mixture, but should be fairly dry
and crumbly.
'&amp;quot;The Insectivorous mixture is made up daily as follows: Scald-
ed granulated dog or chicken biscuit, to which is added 10 per cent
of meat meal and a little finely grated carrot.
'&amp;quot;Touracos, Cocks of the Rock, Manakins, etc., are given the
fruit substitute with a little of the Insect food hitherto called No. 1

BREEDING THE YELLOW-NAPED AMAZON
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99566225" page_id="56230760"  page_num="169" year="" vol="">
By K. W. Dolton (Worcester)
The Yellow-naped Amazon A mazona ochrocephala auropalliata
is a large and handsome bird, which is easily identified by the area
of yellow on the nape of the neck. It has a range which extends from
southern Mexico southwards to north-west Costa Rica. The subspe-
cies is imported into the United States in large numbers as it rivals
the African Grey for its &amp;apos;talking' abilities.
I purchased my first Yellow-naped Amazon from a pet shop in
the late 1970s and the bird did indeed prove to be a marvellous
talker. As far as I know, there was only one other example in the
UK at the time and that was in Yorkshire. Unfortunately mine died
from pseudotuberculosis in 1989.
Quite a few birds of this particular subspecies were imported in
1987 and in the autumn of that year I managed to make up two pairs
from immature, but surgically sexed, examples.
In 1992 one of the pairs nested in a box measuring 24ins high x
lOins x lOins. They laid two fertile eggs which were removed in
order that a friend could put them into an incubator and hand-rear
the resulting chicks. They proved to be male and female when
sexed last year.
In 1993 the same pair laid three eggs which I left for them to
incubate; all three hatched and the young were reared without any
assistance from me. The diet was soaked sunflower, peanuts, pine
nuts, carrot, apple and brown bread and milk.
All three young left the nest box when 12 weeks old on 18th July
and were independent by 20th August.
These youngsters were as large as the two which had previously
been hand-reared and late last year yellow feathers were already
appearing on parts of the head and neck. The hand-reared birds -
although 12 months older - were still not showing this colour.
I understand from David Spilsbury, who saw these birds with
their parents, that this could be a first breeding.

Members of the Avicultural Society gathered at the home of
Dulcie and Freddie Cooke on 8th May.
Guests were welcomed with lunch served in a pretty marquee
which had been organised by the Cookes especially for this occa-
sion. Aviculturists chatted and exchanged news, good and bad,
over a buffet lunch of cold meats and salads with wine, followed by
superb fruit cheesecakes all made by Dulcie.
Suitably enlivened, guests wandered out into the garden, over an
immaculate lawn. The long border was a blaze of colour with all
the azaleas in bloom, while the flights were flanked by tulips,
forget-me-nots and blossoming espaliered apple trees. What was
evident was not only the immensely hard work put into the garden
by Freddie, but also the careful planning and eye for colour and
design which produced such a ravishing effect.
As always at the Cookes, the birds look in superb condition.
Dulcie and Freddie have bred lories very successfully for many
years, and there is no doubt that the care and detailed work which
goes into the feeding and management of their collection is clearly
visible in the presentation and behaviour of their birds. Not only
are the parrots confident and friendly with visitors, but it is clear
that they are used to, and enjoy, the attention.
The Avicultural Society would like to thank Dulcie and Freddie
for all the support they give to it, and for the hard work and care that
makes this annual visit to their home such a memorable pleasure.
All the proceeds from ticket sales were donated to the Avicultural
Society.

situation when a work received - as has the HBW - such universal
acclaim. Soon after its publication in 1992, the first volume was
awarded the title of Best Bird Book of the year by Birdwatch
magazine, an accolade endorsed by British Birds the following
year. If the remaining 11 volumes are of the same high quality as
the first, we can look forward to a work of unparalleled importance
and value.
Volume 1 weighs 3.5 k and has 696 310 x 240mm pages. It
contains 50 excellent colour plates of birds, 382 colour photo-

An introductory chapter to Volume 1 by Dr. Eduardo de Juana
of the International Council for Bird Preservation), provides a
thorough and authoritative account of the world of birds, dealing
with such diverse aspects as evolutionary history, anatomy, phys-
iology, migration, systematics, etc.
Throughout the book the basic unit is the family, with complete
and comprehensive chapters devoted to each one. All such chapters
start with a summary box which provides brief and basic elemen-
tary details of the family being discussed. The text which follows
is both comprehensive and comprehensible under such headings as
Systematics, Morphological Aspects, Habitat, General Habits,
Voice, Food and Feeding, Breeding, Movements, Relationship
With Man, and Status and Conservation.
Taken at random from the 27 families dealt with in Volume 1,
14 pages are devoted to the Tinamous before the reader moves on
to concise but informative species accounts, accompanied by col-
our plates depicting all species.
General text dealing with each family is up-to-date and rigor-
ously scientific, whilst not detracting from the volume&amp;apos;s essential

&amp;apos;readability&amp;apos;. Subdivisions of the most complex families are illus-
trated by means of clear diagrams. Each order starts with a
summary page, listing some of the distinctive features; lower
subdivision (suborder, family, subfamily, tribe, genus, species
subspecies) appear in the Handbook in the appropriate position, so
that the work also constitutes an annotated checklist of the world&amp;apos;s
birds.
Illustrations are an outstanding feature, with colour plates
which will ultimately cover all the living species, together with
distinctive subspecies, and which are normally followed by three
pages of detailed species accounts in condensed form.
Nearly 400 magnificent colour photographs, including a number
not previously published, are another major plus-point. Nowadays
plenty of ornithological and avicultural books have photographic
illustrations which are technically of the highest quality. But most
are simply excellent portraits. The HANDBOOK OF THE BIRDS
OF THE WORLD has many photographs which illustrate compli-
cated behaviour patterns including courtship, thermoregulation or
feeding techniques. As the publishers point out, they are not
simply portraits, as the 50 colour plates show the necessary details
of plumage and morphology'.
Photographs of rare and little-known species have, wherever
possible, been selected ahead of those of more commonly seen
ones.
I have yet to come across a review of this outstanding first
volume which is critical of its text, illustrative content, manner of
presentation or production quality. It marks, one hopes, the start
of what will surely be the definitive work covering all of the world&amp;apos;s
bird species for many years to come. It will soon be joined by
Volume 2 which covers many more families of interest to avicul-
turists ranging from new World Vultures to Guineafowl. There has
been a gap of almost two years between the appearance of these two
volumes, but the publishers hope to increase the frequency to one
volume per year so that the 12 volume set should be complete
within a decade. It will be well worth waiting for. THE HAND-

CANINDE MACAW OBSERVED
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.968346888888889" page_id="56230764"  page_num="173" year="" vol="">
Although discovered way back in the early 1800s, the Blue-
throated or Caninde Macaw Ara glaucogularis has remained a
mysterious bird of uncertain status. Only now have observations on
it in the wild been published by Otto Carlos Jordan and Charles A.
Munn in the World Parrot Trust journal, PsittaScene 1994, 6, 1; 3.
They found it living in a seasonally inundated mosaic of
savannahs, palm groves and low tropical forest in the Department
of Beni in Amazonian Bolivia. Twenty-eight were observed at two
adjacent sites and they learnt of two other small populations. Their
observations suggest that these macaws eat the sticky sweet flesh
of the ripe and nearly ripe fruits of the palm Attalea phalerata,
which is abundant locally, and another palm Acrocomia aculeata.
One pair was seen excavating a nest cavity in a palm tree and two
nests were found in other palms.
Worldwide there are about 200 Blue-throated Macaws living in
various collections, despite the fact that Bolivia outlawed the trade
in this species back in 1984.

When it came to checking more than 70 lists after a &amp;apos;Birdwatch&amp;apos;
in Kenya, confusion arose because some participants used Williams&amp;apos;
and Arlotts&amp;apos;s popular field guide (Collins, 1980), and others Birds
of East Africa (EANHS, 1980), edited by Britton, which uses a more
recent classification/nomenclature, and which is followed in most
scientific and semi-scientific publications in East Africa.
One point of confusion arose over the White-eyes. Williams,
who pointed out that the classification of the East African White-
eyes was unsatisfactory, listed five species, which were reduced to

three in Birds of East Africa. The one that he called the Kikuyu
White-eye Zosteops kikuyensis , called sometimes Z. senegalensis
kikuyensis is, in Birds of East Africa, treated as a race of the
Montane White-eye Z. poliogastra.
Common in forest around Nairobi, the Kikuyu White-eye Z. p.
kikuyensis is, moreover, considered to be confined to the highlands
of central Kenya. That being so, as bird exports are not allowed
from Kenya (but are from Tanzania), what then are the birds with
the broad ring of white feathering around the eyes, available lately,
which are being called &amp;apos;Kikuyu White-eyes&amp;apos;?
The prime candidate would seem to be Z. p. mbulensis , which
occurs in south-east Kenya and northern Tanzania. Z. p. eurycricota
also has a yellow belly, but lacks yellow on the forehead and Z. p.
winifredae has a grey belly and flanks.

BOMBER' HARRIS TACKLES PIGEON PROBLEM
Pigeons, whose droppings have despoiled the town centre of
Longton near Stoke-on-Trent, have been put to flight by a trained
bird of prey. Property developers refurbishing the area sought help
from the Birds of Prey Centre at Lowther in Cumbria. The answer?
Two handlers and a Harris Hawk. No blood appears to have been
spilled for the pigeons outflew the predator. But the experts believe
the hawk&amp;apos;s presence will have been enough to scare them off
permanently.

CRANE FLOCK EXTINCT ?
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998667" page_id="56230766"  page_num="175" year="" vol="">
A flock of Siberian Cranes Grus leucogeranus which regularly
wintered in India&amp;apos;s Bharatpur sanctuary is believed to be extinct
after declining in numbers since 1960 when 200 birds visited. In
1965, 125 arrived, 38 in 1982, six in 1992 and none in the most
recent winter, 1993/4. The birds are thought to have been hunted
along their traditional migration route across Pakistan and Afghan-
istan.
Six captive-bred Siberian Cranes which were released prior to
the anticipated arrival of the wild flock, joined Common Cranes
Grus grus during the winter but showed no inclination to fly north
with them in spring.
Now, in a further attempt to restore the flock, Siberian Crane
chicks will be raised using Common Cranes as surrogate parents in
the hope that they will follow them on migration.

A report in the July-August 1994 edition of BTO News reveals
a serious decline in Lapwing numbers in the UK. Although the
long-term UK population trend shows a slow increase (which it is
presumed is at least partly a recovery from losses in the exceptional
cold of 1962/3) there has been a downturn after 1984. Thus, this
year&amp;apos;s drop in numbers, estimated at 32 per cent, continues a serious
decline over the last 10 years.

The future of the White-headed Duck Oxyura leucocephala
looks increasingly bleak in the face of threats from the Ruddy Duck
O. jamaicensis , says Baz Hughes of the Wildfowl &amp; Wetlands
Trust. There are new developments in the continuing story of the
Ruddy Duck&amp;apos;s threat to the White-headed Duck, he says. Recent
records of Ruddy Ducks wintering in Morocco suggest they may
already have established themselves in that country, providing a
further source of Ruddy Ducks much nearer to the Spanish breeding
grounds of the White-headed Duck. The Moroccan authorities are
making every effort to control birds which turn up there and had
already shot two male Ruddy Ducks by March 1994. But the size
and spread of the sites on which Ruddy Ducks occur make the
Moroccans&amp;apos; task far from easy.

I.Z.N. was founded in 1951 to give the
world's zoos a regular medium for the
exchange of information, news and ideas.
With contributors in six continents, and
subscribers in more than 40 countries, it
is still the only specialist journal which
covers all aspects of the international zoo
scene. Every issue contains full-length
articles on animal management and
related topics (often including translations
from foreign publications), as well as numerous shorter news
items from zoos in Britain and overseas. Other regular features are
book reviews, conservation news, a free service for advertising
surplus and wanted stock, profiles of famous animal collections,
and reference lists of important articles in other zoo publications.

In common, I suspect, with many other contemporaries, Goul-
dian Finches were very much a part of my avicultural 'education'.
I hope Members, unfamiliar with the trials and tribulations regu-
larly experienced with imported stocks of these birds some 40 or
more years ago, will take my word for the fact that if one succeeded
in keeping - and eventually breeding - examples of these colourful
grassfinches it represented a very marked upwards swing in the
learning curve.
I still have a few Gouldians, together with other fondly remem-
bered species from those formative years. And it is as a direct result
of recent experiences with them that I find myself asking whether
we can really expect conservationists to take seriously the fact that
aviculture has much to contribute to the preserv ation of a growing
list of threatened species.
During the past 24 months, my pairs of 'normal' Red-headed
Gouldian Finches have produced some bonny youngsters, both
Red-heads and Black-heads, but a majority moulted through to
reveal white breasts, while others have a distinctive shade of lime-
green suffusing the normal yellow undersurfaces.
In 1993 a recently acquired pair of 'normal' Diamond Doves
reared eight squabs. My sons, two of whom work in UK zoos and
are familiar with my views on mutations, paid close attention to the
first two rapidly feathering youngsters, and were the first to
congratulate me, with great hilarity, when one of them proved to
be a silver - as was the case with subsequent rounds.
But it is important to re-emphasise a genuine cause for concern
about present-day preoccupations with the production of muta-
tions. Gouldian Finches are present in few public collections, at
least in the UK. So what would be the situation if aviculturists were
asked to contribute stock towards a future reintroduction pro-
gramme?

Let us be clear - this is by no means a fictitious scenario, for the
species is not far from the abyss in some parts of its range.
However enquiries made to a number of breeders in various
parts of the UK over recent months has revealed the disquieting fact
that aviculture might be hard-pressed indeed to provide suitable
stock for such a project. For none of those contacted was prepared
to guarantee their surplus normal-coloured birds would not pro-
duce various mutations.
Although not threatened in the wild, Chinese Painted Quail
provide an even better (or worse, depending on one's point of view)
example. Heaven forbid that we should ever dilute existing wild
stocks with modern caricatures in which fawn, silver, khaki, earth-
brown and other shades may be produced from the same sitting of
eggs.
The wild forms of some Lovebird species also appear to be well
on their way to avicultural extinction, while mutations of many
other Parrot like species are proliferating like flies on a dung heap.
I do not question the right of knowledgeable and responsible
aviculturists to propagate mutations. More worrying is the fact that
surplus stock may be disposed of to individuals interested only in
making money as quickly as possible through the irresponsible
production of such birds. Indeed, I know of one enterprising
partnership in which a breeder sells Rosa Bourke's Parrakeets
through a chain of pet shops - where the birds are snapped up by
unsuspecting members of the public who believe #50 is a reason-
able price to pay for a rare 'Pink Budgerigar 5 .
It is not too much to hope that Members of the Avicultural
Society, 100 years from now, will have reason to acknowledge the
contribution made by their predecessors in the 20th century to the
preservation of many species which might otherwise have been
lost - either through extinction or uncontrolled breeding pro-
grammes.

by Dr. Luis F. Baptista (USA)
The last century has witnessed many bird species in diverse taxa
being bred in captivity. Some groups of birds, notably seedeaters,
breed more readily under captive situations than others. It is not
surprising then that seedeaters were among the first birds to be
domesticated. The Rock Dove Columba livia and Greyleg Goose
Anser anser were domesticated some 3,000 BC (Goodwin 1965,
Sossinka 1982).
Understanding a bird's food habits and behaviour are prerequi-
site to successful breeding. Concomitant with our increased knowl-
edge of dietary requirements came some spectacular breeding
achievements. Hans Lohrl, my former boss at the Max Planck
Institute, was the first to breed the Wallcreeper Trichodroma
muraria. For this feat his good friend, the late Konrad Lorenz,
declared him the world's greatest bird keeper. When I related this
to him, he at once conceded the title to Ellen Thaler (formerly at
Innsbruck Zoo) who bred Goldcrests and Flamecrests Regulus spp.
(Thaler 1979).
Breeding hummingbirds is a great challenge. Cleveland Zoo
bred Jamaican Streamertails Trochilus polytmus in 1959
(J. Lindholm, pers. comm.) and Isenberg (1962) bred Allen's
Hummingbirds Selasphorus sasin in 1961. Several more species
have been bred now and some, notably Colibri and Amazilia
species, tend to be easier to breed than others. One of Wolfgang
Grummt's proudest accomplishments is the breeding group of
Sparkling Violet Ears Colibri coruscans he established in the east
Berlin Tierpark.
My friends the Glotfelties of Pasadena, California, once bred
Black-chinned Hummingbirds Archilochus alexandri using half a
ping-pong ball filled with pasted-on-kapok to simulate a nest cup
which was glued onto a perch. Two chicks fledged from this
artificial "nest". So far, however, no one has managed to breed any
of the Hermit Hummingbirds (e.g. Phaethornis spp., Glaucis spp.)
or even maintain them in health for long periods. This feat will be
one of the challenges of the next century. As these hummingbirds
are spider specialists perhaps the answer lies in keeping quantities
of small spiders as food.
As late as 1984, Jean Delacour believed that fruit doves were

impossible to breed in captivity. How elated he would be to know
that several species are being bred (in the genera Ptilinopus ,
Phapitreron, Treron , Duculo ), and at least one species, the Black-
naped Fruit Dove Ptilinopus melanospila is being bred with regu-
larity. Pheasant Pigeons Otidiphaps nobilis are being bred from
time to time. Jurgen Nicolai had a pair that raised young in a basket
placed on a ping-pong table. A pair at the Frankfurt Zoo raises
young in a communal walk-through aviary. Unfortunately, most of
the birds hatched in the United States of America tend to be hand-
raised. It will be a challenge to establish lines of this magnificent
species who will rear progeny on their own.
Other noteworthy breeding successes are the Lesser Broadbill
Calyptomena viridis at Wuppertal and the San Diego Wild Animal
Park, California, and Long-tailed Broadbill Psarisomus dalhousiae
at the Frankfurt Zoo. For a long time Baikal TzvAAnas formosa and
Red-breasted Geese Branta ruficollis bred only rarely in captivity.
Today both are bred with regularity. If one scans the pages of this
journal and those of the A FA Watchbird , Gefiederte Welt , and
Trochilus , one finds many impressive successes in addition to those
mentioned above. Few of those species, however, are established
in the hobby. With environmental awareness increasing through-
out the world and with airlines pressured by animal rights organi-
sations to stop the transportation of birds, aviculturists will find it
increasingly difficult to acquire wild stock for their pens. The
establishment of captive breeding lines are a first priority in the
years ahead.
Beyond the aesthetic pleasure and companionship which birds
provide, aviculture has contributed to several areas in science.
Oskar Heinroth was probably one of the greatest aviculturists of our
century. He managed to breed and/or hand-raise and study the
behaviour ontogeny of an innumerable number of European birds,
and published his observations with Magdalena Heinroth in their
classic four volume opus "Die Vogel Mitteleuropas". The Heinroths
kept tame European Nightjars Caprimulgus europaeus in their
living room where a pair raised young on a peccary skin rug.
Heinroth's intimacy with waterfowl led him to discover the phe-
nomenon of behavioural homology, i.e. behaviour patterns may be
inherited as are morphological characters, so that related species
will have similar behaviours, probably controlled by the same
genes. His brilliant student, Konrad Lorenz, expanded on these
ideas, and went on to win the Nobel Prize for these and other
advancements in the field of ethology. Lorenz's observations on

the behaviour of waterfowl have appeared in the pages of this
magazine (Lorenz 1951-53). These pioneering studies on water-
fowl and others that followed enabled Delacour and Mayr (1945) to
revise the genera of waterfowl, combining behavioural with mor-
phological characters in classification, another classic study.
The many mutations that have appeared among captives of so
many taxa have enabled aviculturists and scientists to study many
principles of inheritance. One of the most incredible stories in
ornithology is that of polymorphism in Seed-crackers Pyrenestes
ostrinus. Large-billed, small-billed, and megabilled individuals
occur in the same population in Cameroon, Africa, and hatch from
eggs laid in the same nest. Birds equipped with each bill size feed
on seeds of certain size ranges during the breeding season and thus
avoid competition. Thanks to the magnificent breeding colony of
these finches maintained at the Riverbanks Zoo in South Carolina
by Bob Siebel, Smith (1993) was able to establish that the inherit-
ance of bill size is a simple Mendelian dominance.
Many seed-eating and insectivorous song birds (Oscines) have
been shown to learn vocalisations from adults of their species.
Thanks to improved diets, Anna's Hummingbirds Calypte anna
may be maintained in captivity and studies have revealed that
despite their primitive syringes, these hummingbirds may learn
very complex song (Baptista and Schuchmann 1990). Advances in
aviculture have enabled scientists to keep birds in health and study
learning and heritability of a variety of behavioural and vocal
patterns in a host of taxa (Baptista and Horblit 1990; review in
Baptista 1994).
Captive birds have contributed much to our knowledge of brain
functions. One of the noteworthy discoveries of the century is that
certain brain centres in canaries Serinus canarius and other species
(Nottebohm 1993, review in Baptista and Gaunt 1994) undergo an
annual cycle of expanding and shrinking mediated by lengthening
and shortening day lengths of the various seasons. A mutation has
appeared among Belgian Waterschlager canaries that leads to early
deafness so that these canaries are now being used as a model to
study hearing degeneration in humans (Gahr, pers. comm.).
Last but not least are aviculture's contributions to the field of
conservation. The most spectacular success story is the breeding/
release programme of the Peregrine Falcon Falco peregrinus by
Tom Cade and his colleagues (Cade and Hardaswick 1985). This
species was extinct on the east coast, and through the co-operation
of private breeders and Cade's programme, peregrines once more

traverse the skies of eastern North America and many other parts of
the continent. The Lammergeier Gypaetus harbatus breeding/
release programme in Europe is another such success story in the
making.
Some species that are rare or endangered (or even extinct) in the
wild are more numerous in captivity than they are in nature.

Lophura edwardsi are examples. In 1978 and 1981 several Cana-
dian and North American ornithologists visited Socorro Island in
the Revillagigedo Archipelago, 400 miles off the west coast of
Mexico. They found to their dismay that the Socorro Island Dove
Zenaida graysoni had gone extinct due probably to a combination
of reasons including feral cat predation, habit destruction by sheep
and possibly overhunting.
Jean Delacour and Frank Todd put me in touch with a number of
dove breeders and to our delight we found that Socorro Doves still
thrived in their collections. A few birds eventually made their way
to Europe (Nicolai 1991). Theo Pagel of Cologne Zoo and Stefan
Stadler of Frankfurt Zoo are now co-ordinating a breeding pro-
gramme for this species in Germany and Stefan is keeping the
studbook. Some friends of mine and I founded Island Endemics
Institute, an organization dedicated to the breeding and repatria-
tion of the Socorro Dove to its ancestral home. Facilities are being
built to have a breeding programme in California, USA, parallel to
that in Germany.
Meanwhile my colleague Hartmut Walter from the University of
California at Los Angeles and I have collaborated with Mexican
wildlife biologists in faunal and floral surveys of the island and in
drafting a recovery plan (Baptista 1993). President Salinas of
Mexico signed a decree on 6 June, 1994, declaring Isla Socorro and
the Revillagigedos a Biosphere Reserve.
Isla Socorro will henceforth be jointly administered by Mexi-
co's wildlife biologists (SEDESOL) and navy, and visits will be
restricted. No hunting will be permitted so that released birds will
be unmolested by humans. We are meanwhile collecting blood
from doves and conducting DNA-fingerprinting studies to deter-
mine genetic relatedness of captive stock to plan pairings for
maximum outcrossing. Private breeders are also involved in this
programme in helping to breed birds for release, but also to act as
reserves in case some misfortune leads to the extirpation of birds
in the large breeding centres.
Ultimately, it will be up to aviculturists along with zoos to

maintain gene-pools of birds that will be extinct in the wild as
habitats disappear. Because there are so many species in need of
help and so few that may be helped some might argue that avicul-
ture's role in conservation will not be large. This may be true if we
count the actual number of species that will be saved by aviculture
per se. However, we must not lose sight of the greater role
aviculture plays in creating awareness in the general populace of
these beautiful creatures and their plight. Also, in trying to save one
or two species one often has to prepare a habitat to receive those
species and in so doing the programme may actually be preserving
substantial tracts of entire ecosystems, thus saving many plant and
animal taxa.
Again I draw as an example the Socorro Dove breeding/recovery
programme. In organising the programme we have had to draw on
the expertise of Mexican, North American, German and New
Zealand scientists and aviculturists. In restoring the islands we are
saving a flora with an endemism rate of 31.6% (Levin and Moran
1989) and several endemic landbirds (10 species on Isla Socorro).
The latter include an endemic genus, the Socorro Mockingbird
Mimodes graysoni. Once thought to be close to extinction (Jehl and
Parkes 1982), banding studies by Juan Martinez of Vera Cruz,
Mexico (now at Villanova University, Pennsylvania, USA) has
revealed over 200 individuals. Although the picture is rosier for
this species they are not yet out of danger by any means.
Juan's ecological studies will be critical to their preservation as
knowledge of their life history will guide wildlife biologists in their
work. Because of destruction of forest tracts a savannah-like
habitat has been created on the south part of Socorro Island, ideal
environs for Northern Mockingbirds Mimus polvglottos who have
invaded. Juan has been looking at possible competition between
invading Mimus and the resident Mimodes.
Where the two species meet in the south, some Mimodes have
adopted the songs of the invading Mimus (Baptista 1993). In the
brushy northern part of the island where Mimus is still absent,
Mimodes still sings its ancestral song. Will the status quo hold or
will Mimus eventually adapt and invade the rest of the island? Also
could it be possible that when the island is restored and forest and
chaparral habitat return to Socorro, Mimus numbers will decrease?
The Mockingbird story is only one of many in this most exciting
conservation project. The Socorro Dove is the banner species of a
much larger programme involving laity and professionals of
several nations.

Introduction
The Black-backed Fruit Dove Ptilinopus cinctus is a medium-
sized fruit dove from the Lesser Sunda Islands, with a range
extending from Bali in the west, extending through to Tanimbar in
the east. A closely related form, the Black-banded Fruit Dove
Ptilinopus alligator , is found in a small area of the Northern
Territory of Australia.
Description
Adult birds have a white, or pale grey, head, nape and upper
breast. The back, wings and tail are black, and there is a broad black
band across the middle of the breast. The lower breast is pale grey,
and the under tail coverts are greenish grey. The eye is red, the bill
is grey-green with a yellow tip and the legs are red. There is some
sub-specific variation, which is imperfectly described. However,
following White &amp; Bruce (1986), our birds have been provisionally
identified as belonging to the sub-species albocinctus , from the
islands of Lombok, Sumbawa, Flores and Bali.
History
London Zoo purchased a trio of birds from a private collection
in October 1993. Apparently they had been imported from the wild
during 1990. Shortly afterwards they were sexed by Vetgen as two
males and one female. In January 1994, one male apparently flew
into the wire roof of the aviary and was found dead. The remaining
pair were introduced to each other on 18th April 1994. They were
housed in an aviary with a large flight, measuring 4 metres wide by
5 metres long and 4 metres in height, with an inside den of 4 by 4
metres, with a 4 metre apex roof. The birds shared the aviary with
a Grey Francolin Francolinus pondicerianus , two Rose-coloured
Starlings Sturnus rose us, a Bali Mynah Leucopsar rothschildi and
an Asian Pied Starling Sturnus contra.
Diet
The basic diet, fed at about 10.30 am daily was diced tomato,
apple, pear, banana, grape, soaked sultanas, Prosecto, turkey pel-
let, boiled egg, boiled soya bean, boiled rice, boiled potato and
carrot. In addition, seasonally available fruits were added.

Breeding
Following introduction, the birds settled together very quickly,
and, on 2nd May, were observed sitting. The nest site was in the
indoor flight, in a small 10 by 10 cm nest pan, close to an old conifer
tree, wired to one of the walls. The doves had collected a small
amount of grass and placed it on the mesh of the nest pan, but
otherwise no attempt at nest building was made. One egg was laid,
but, on 10th May, it was deserted and was found to be infertile.
The birds were very nervous and cage maintenance was kept to
a minimum. On 31st May, they were observed sitting once again.
Because of the difficulty of observing them, it was not clear
whether both birds shared incubation. On 21st June, after an
incubation period of 21 days, a single egg shell was found on the
floor of the cage. It appeared to result from a good hatch. No
observations were made of adult/chick interactions, but the chick
fledged at 14 days.

At fledging, it was approximately one third adult size and still
had traces of down in its plumage. The head, neck and breast were
pale grey, with yellow edges to the feathers and the back and wings
and tail were bronze green with yellow flecking. The eyes were
dark brown, with blue orbital skin. The bill was blue grey and the
legs were pink. Following fledging, the adults were not seen to feed
the chick.

The chick was removed from the aviary on 29th July, when it
appeared that the adult birds might be going to nest again. Shortly
after it was removed, it scalped itself on the roof of its aviary, but
the damage was superficial and was treated successfully with
antibiotics. Ptilinopus cinctus seems to be a nervous bird, inclined
to sudden flights into the roof or walls of the aviary, so care should
be taken to avoid sudden disturbance.
A number of fruit pigeon species have been imported into the
United Kingdom in recent years; most of them have reproduced
successfully and the genus seems relatively uncomplicated in
captivity. We have not been able to find any reference to reproduc-
tion in this species. The only previous captive hatching that we are
aware of was at the San Diego Zoo in 1991, Olney &amp; Ellis (1994).

THE TRI-COLOURED MUNIA AND THE CHESTNUT
MUNIA - TWO GOOD SPECIES?
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99920972972973" page_id="56230787"  page_num="192" year="" vol="">
By: Robin L. Restall, Hong Kong.
In his seminal revision of the subfamily estrildinae in 1943,
Jean Delacour united three separate munia species into one. The
three were Lonchura malacca, L atricapilla and L. ferruginosa. He
gave the name ferruginosa for the combined species, over-looking
the fact that Loxia malacca Linnaeus (1766) antedates Loxia
ferruginosa Sparrmann (1789). Since then several authors have
questioned the wisdom of this. Wolters (1979) regarded L.
ferruginosa as a good species and Sibley and Monroe (1990) follow
him. Goodwin separated L. malacca, L. atricapilla and L. ferruginosa
into three groups but retained them as a single species, other writers
generally follow suit, but there is a trend to regard L. ferruginosa
as a good species, e.g. MacKinnon and Phillipps (1994). The
specific integrity of L. ferruginosa now appears to be beyond doubt
and I certainly feel it should be treated as a good species. Consid-
ering the detail of all this and regardless of the status of L.
ferruginosa, I have come to the conclusion that L. malacca and L.
atricapilla must be regarded as distinct species. The reasons are as
follows.
The Tri-coloured Munia L. malacca occupies a clearly demar-
cated range within India, quite separated from L. atricapilla by a
strip of land some 250 km between the two at the closest point (Ali
and Ripley 1987). In contrast, L. atricapilla has an extensive
sprawling range within which various sub-species intergrade and
even overlap.
Within L. malacca there are five distinct morphs, by far the
commonest being the familiar black-headed chestnut-backed bird
with a white breast band and white flanks, and a clearly-defined
black belly patch running into black undertail-coverts. This form
accounts for 95% or more of any population. The first of the four
variants has a noticeably irregular zig-zagging of the division
between the black and the white on the flanks. The second has a fine
wavy black barring over the white feathers similar in pattern to that
on the African Silverbill L. cantans. The third has a very light
cinnamon wash over the white with the edges of the feathers darker
cinnamon, giving a scalloped appearance; and the fourth has the
white replaced by an even cinnamon. Obviously the species has a

propensity for colour variation on the white. Only one of these
resembles L. atricapilla, and that is the cinnamon-flanked variant.
But when compared side-by-side, the cinnamon flanks of this form
of L. malacca do not match any of the variations of L. atricapilla .
In contrast there is considerable variation within the different
geographic forms of the Chestnut Munia L. atricapilla. The differ-
ent races have varying shades of brown on the upper surfaces,
including a pale scalloping on the mantle. There are also different
shades of brown on the breast and flanks, and a considerable variety
of colouring of the rump, uppertail-coverts and tail. In addition
there are variations of head colouring, both from race to race and
sometimes within a race, from black to brown and even pale grey
on the nape. The belly varies from an extensive irregular black to
a total absence of black, the belly and vent to undertail-coverts
being the same brown as the flanks. In all this variation, within
which there are many confusing intergrades and some abrupt
contrasts, there is no clear trend nor cline. All the variation is of
the black and brown.
More significantly there are no cases of morphs showing white
anywhere on the body, let alone on the breast and flanks.
Although I have not been able to hold live nestlings side by side
for direct comparison, it appears that the palate markings of L.
Malacca are different from those of L. atricapilla.
In my experience, in behavioural terms L. Malacca and L.
atricapilla self-select for partners and pair bonding, in preference
to crossing or mixing both in the wild and in captivity. Both species
occur in Hong Kong where L. atricapilla is a migratory summer
visitor, and the introduced L. Malacca is a resident. Mixed pairs
have not been recorded. It has been reported that intermediates
between the two species occur (Viney et al 1994) but I understand
from Clive Viney (in lift) that this conclusion was based on
observations of seeing both species entering the same reed beds
carrying nesting material. These would almost certainly have been
male birds in every case, with which cross-breeding is unlikely. It
would be impossible to divine the parentage of juveniles or moult-
ing first year birds without seeing fledglings being fed by the
parents. It seems certain that the two species do not interbreed in
Mai Po.
In the light of his reasoning I find a case for regarding L.
Malacca and L. atricapilla as separate species irresistible. I am
certain that there are members of the Avicultural Society who will
have some experiences or observations that could bear on the

subject, one way or the other. I would be most grateful for any input
however insignificant it might seem. Please write to me care of the
Editor.
Incidentally, there is a plumage variant known in L. ferruginosa.
This differs from either of the foregoing species. It is only found
on the male and has the black of the underparts extending from the
bib right to the undertail-coverts with little or no chestnut on the
flanks at all (and that covered by the folded wings). It would be
invaluable to see the palate markings of the nestling L. ferruginosa

Josef H. Lindholm III,
(Keeper II/Birds, Fort Worth Zoological Park)
As it happens, both the first and second quarter centuries
of the Avicultural Society approached their conclusions in
the midst of the darkest occasions of the 20th Century. While
1919 found Jean Delacour contemplating the utter destruction
of his aviaries at Villers-Bretonneux yet forging ahead with the
establishment of his new estate at Cleres, 1944 found him
ensconced as Technical Adviser to the New York Zoological
Society, uncertain as to what had become of his incomparable
collection in then-occupied Normandy.
Delacour was 55 in 1945, yet, as we shall see, the next 25
years were wonderfully active and rich with achievements.
'I have long been personally interested in waterfowl. For over
twenty years I kept at Cleres several hundreds of these fascinating
birds... under almost natural conditions and many of them were
breeding regularly. This enabled me to make countless obser-
vations which were extremely valuable for the understanding of
their relationship.
'I had already published several articles on the subject...
Since, however, more has been learned, and at the suggestion of
several American ornithologists, Dr Ernst Mayr and I decided to
sum up our knowledge in a new more important paper in English.
Our study has been published in The Wilson Bulletin , vol 57, 1st
March, 1945 (pp. 1-53), and I refer it to all persons interested. Our
object has been to effect a more natural grouping of species, with
a better understanding of their affinities expressed in a simpler
taxonomy.
'The conventional classification of waterfowl usually so far
adopted is founded on a small selection of morphological charac-
ters, primarily the shape of the bill, legs and feet. Nothing could
be more misleading, as these are entirely functional and undoubt-
edly often recently acquired, representing merely a secondary
adaptation, that is repeated in widely separate groups. We have
used on the contrary a number of nonadaptive characters: pattern of
tarsus, plumage pattern in adults and chicks, posture, general

body proportions, length of neck and shape of head, internal
anatomy and more particularly biological peculiarities. Habits and
behaviour are of paramount importance, for they are deeply rooted
and usually the product of very ancient evolution...
'We believe in large genera, since it is the function of generic
names to express relationship not distinctness, which is expressed
by the species names'...

With several modifications , Delacour and Mayr's system of
Waterfowl classification remains the generally accepted one. It is
recognised as a pioneering application of the Phylogenetic ap-
proach to taxonomy.
'...All this is a thing of the past at Cleres. But Mr F.E. Fooks is
back there, and this past has a fair chance to be partly revived in the
near future. As a link, I hear that a Festive Amazon, which we
brought over from South America and liberated In 1921, is still to-
day flying around the Manor House and the terrace. If he could talk
better than he does, he would no doubt tell much, and some of his
stories would probably bring tears to all my friends who knew
Cleres in its former splendour'.
(Birds at semi-liberty at Villers Bretonneux and at Cleres(1905
- 1940), March-April, 1946 Vol. LII, 64-65.)
'The problem of exhibiting cage birds in public zoos is a
difficult one. Until recently it has been tackled rather crudely. Too
often just rows of wire cages are lined up on shelves... practically
never before has it been attempted to show the birds under the best
conditions of light... For many years I had planned to build a
special hall, the walls of which would have had glass openings,
giving view to birds and fishes. Cages and aquariums would have
been decorated and planted. The effect would have been that of so
many animated, living pictures. They would be set up In a wide
corridor encircling the hall, where all facilities would be provided
for cleaning and for the care of the creatures.
'The centuries-old rooms at Cleres, with all their historic inter-
est, did not allow for such a scheme. But I had hoped to build a
special house some day... Fate has decided otherwise... However,
I had the chance to achieve at the New York Zoo for the public what
I once had dreamed to do at home for my own satisfaction. The
result has been what we call the 'Jewel Room'.
'The Bird House in New York consists of three halls, the largest
of which has not been much altered these last years. We have only

redecorated the big central flight and some of the compartments.
The second room has been completely changed in 1942. The
numerous cages and small compartments for Parrots and Doves
have been removed, and five roomy flights have replaced them.
They are decorated and planted so that they now form the "New
England Garden", for native species; "Arid Plain", for desert birds;
"Indo-Malayan Jungle"...; "Tropical American Rain Forest&amp;quot;.
&amp;apos;The third hall was particularly unattractive in its former state;
a large room... with an ugly glass roof and plainly built compart-
ments all around... They were badly lit, and none of the beautiful
colours or metallic reflections of the inmates could be seen at real
advantage. It was the more unfortunate that it always housed a
wonderful collection. This hall has been entirely renovated during
the winter of 1945...
&amp;apos;The transformation has been comparatively simple and easy -
a smaller room has been built inside the hall, entirely dark but for
the light which comes through the glass front of the cages that open
in the walls... The cages form two groups... Those of the first...
ten in number and of three different sizes, are dedicated to Hum-
ming Birds. The others consist of one large (10 ft. by 11 ft.),
unplanted but nicely decorated aviary mostly for hardbills, of two
fair-sized planted compartments (5*4 ft by 5 ft) and seven smaller
ones (3 l A ft by 3 ft). They are at present occupied by a Fairy
Bluebird, a Rothschild's Starling, a Cock-of-the-Rock, and a
number of Manakins, Sugarbirds and small Tanagers, which are
doing exceptionally well in such quarters... It looks like Gould's
plates, but it is alive'...

For further details of Captain Deiacour &amp;apos;s work at the New York
Zoological Park . the reader is referred to an earlier article
(Lind holm, 1988).
Tn 1940 there were nearly 500 waterfowl at Cleres. All the
known species of geese, Sheldducks and Treeducks were represent-
ed, also all the ducks and swans with the exception of about twenty-
five.
'In 1945, practically nothing remained all have been killed or
removed. A lone Whooper Swan, a couple of Common Sheldducks,
a dozen or so hybrids between Mallards, Metiers and Black Ducks,
some three-quarter-bred Ydlowbills, a few diving Ducks, which
look like a darker and more elongated Scaup (Probably with White-
eye and Redhead blood), and oddly enough a male Sharp-winged

Teal and a female Bufflehead. According to Monsieur Georges
Olivier there were still a number of birds till the final slaughter in
1944, and during the occupation Cape and Sharp-winged Teal had
reared broods on the Lake.
'In 1946 Mr Spedan Lewis kindly presented us with a good
collection: a pair of Black Swans, Emperor, Greater Snow, Magellan,
Ruddy-headed, Blue-winged Geese, South African Sheldducks,
and Red-crested Pochards. The Paris Zoo contributed Emperor,
Red-breasted, Bar-headed, Egyptian, and Cereopsis Geese and
Mute and Whooper Swans. Major Pam reared Blue Snow Geese for
us. Mandarins and Carolinas arrived from America... while Chiloe
Wigeon, Rosybills, Tufted and Bahama Ducks, and Ashy-headed
Geese are coming from Leckford, more Ruddy-headed Geese from
Foxwarren, more Bar-headed and Barnicle from Wormly Bury,
Paradise Sheldducks from Whipsnade, and a couple of dozen
species of the various European ducks from Mr Schuyl in Holland.
Many species of course are, and will long be, missing, particularly
the Tree Ducks, now vanished from Europe, and all the sea-ducks
of which we used to keep such a wonderful collection...
'My old breeding pair of Black-necked Swans, that for twenty
years reared their young at Cleres have naturally vanished, and the
species is now terribly scarce in captivity. But pairs of their
offspring at Leckford and in Holland, at Mr Schuyl's, have bred this
year and I hope that later on, a new Black-necked menage will
replace their grandparents in the pretty pool by the waterfall at the
end of the lake, now temporarily occupied by a handsome but
vulgar pair of Mute Swans.
'While I was in England last spring and summer I was delighted
to see how extraordinarily successful Mr Terry Jones was at
Leckford in rearing young waterfowl..., often the offspring of old,
worn-looking pairs. If many interesting species have been saved
for aviculture we owe it to him'.
(Waterfowl at Cleres in 1947. November-December, 1947 Vol.
LIII, 198-199.)
'Soon after my return from Europe, I went on my annual tour of
inspection of the Trumpeter Swan's refuges'.
'Two conclusions are obvious. First, In the wild state under the
present circumstances the annual crop of cygnets is practically
wasted. The Red Rock Lakes Refuge is already over-stocked and
the surplus population leaves it, only to die of starvation or lack of
water, or to be illegally shot outside. We did not capture any
cygnets in 1946 nor in 1947 in order to find out whether or not the

previous captures had affected the level of the wild stock. The
answer has been that it did not in the least. It seems, therefore,
preferable to capture more young birds every year. Second, it
is hopeless to expect this large sedentary species to thrive in
unprotected parts of the country now settled by man. Enforcement
of the law is well nigh impossible in these remote thinly inhabited
highlands. Our programme of propagation of the species under
control appears to be sound. The captive birds at Malheur Lake
(Oregon) are doing well and the 1944 pairs should start breeding
next spring in separate pens. I have just transferred twelve 1945
birds to the Ruby Lake Refuge, Nevada,... where we hope to
establish later on the young Swans which may be reared by these
captive pairs'...

'...The Scarlet subspecies, however,... is the only one to have
been imported alive so far... It is the finest of all and the only true
Scarlet one. It was first brought alive to New York in December,
1941, by C. Cordier, who landed twelve specimens..., three of
which remained at the Bronx Zoo, the others going to other zoos
and a pair to Mrs Milton Erlanger... At the time of writing, two
of the original males are still living at the Bronz Zoo in perfect
condition, if a little faded in colour. One has been sharing for a few
years a large planted compartment with Quetzals, Umbrella Birds,
Tanagers, and several other birds, and there has been no quarrels.

'Since Mr Cordier's visit in 1941, the inhabitants of South-
western Colombia who had learnt from him how to catch and to feed
Scarlet Cocks-of-the-Rock, have recently sent a few every year to
the Louis Ruhe firm in New York. The same thing happened with
Quetzals in Costa Rica, so that these two marvellous species are
well represented at present in American collections'...

deprived aviculture of one of the most intelligent, observant, and

good stock left in captivity. This year 13 Satyrs and 2 Blyth's have
been reared; some of the Satyrs belong to the fifth generation bred
in captivity. They are extremely well fed and cared for so that they
have not deteriorated in the least degree. Mme Malisoux also
possesses a pair of Palawan Peacock Pheasants, and she has recent-

... When I saw Cleres on 7th June, 1940, for the last time until the
autumn of 1946, the grounds had already been bombed heavily
twice, and many animals and birds had been killed.; but for craters
and damaged trees, the park still looked lovely, with hundreds of
creatures all about the place...
'...When Mr Fooks was allowed to come to Cleres in 1945, one
Muntjac, one Crane, some Junglefowl, a Swan, and a few Ducks
only remained.
'Mr Fooks had reported that, empty and spoiled as it was, Cleres
could be restored. I then decided that he should return, which he
was eager to do, and resume managing the estate as he had done so
well in the past twenty-five years. Despite tremendous difficulties,
which further occupation by Allied troops did not alleviate al-
though they proved helpful and considerate, most of the park, the
gardens, and the aviaries were soon put in order. When I returned
in September, I was agreeably surprised at the results of Mr Fooks&amp;apos;
work. The place looked much as before in a general way, and it was
already fairly well stocked, thanks to the generosity of... Mr
Spedan Lewis... and Major A. Pam... . Also Professor A. LJrbain,
Director of the Paris Museum, had returned birds which he had kept
for us during the war, and loaned many others and some animals.
It may be said here that I have bequeathed Cleres and the adjoining
property to the National Museum in order to ensure its future as far
as can be done in these troubled times...

Narie, Vice-Premier and Minister of Justice, accompanied by all
the authorities of Normandy, the British and American consuls, the
Director of the National Museum, and the delegates of numerous
scientific institutions and societies; many of my friends were
there, among them Miss Barcley-Smith... and Mr Peter Scott. To
me it was a very moving occasion.
&amp;apos;Since that day Cleres has been a public park, where visitors are
admitted every day and may wander as they please, the gate takings
paying for most of the upkeep...
&amp;apos;...The main aviaries have been done up, as also a good part
of the pheasantries, the rest being damaged beyond repair... The
tropical houses and indoor bird galleries, however, are a total loss,
and it is hardly worth while reconstructing them as long as fuel and
special foods are not available...
&amp;apos;...I could even obtain a pair of the rare Imperial Pheasant,
which I discovered in Indo-China in 1923; there are still a few of
them in American aviaries, all descendants from the original pair
which bred at Cleres for the first time in 1925; it is nice to see them
again where their ancestors lived before... Among the Doves,
most of the Australian species are represented, including the
pretty Brush Bronzewing, Philippine Cuckoo-Doves, Grayson's,
Bleedinghearts, and African Blue-headed puelia Budgerigars of
many new colours, Fischer's Lovebirds make a good show in some
of the aviaries, while a pre-war pair of King Parrakeets, which spent
several years in a cage in Paris, have bred the last two seasons...
Other aviaries are well stocked with Glossy Starlings, Weavers,
Whydahs, Wax bills, and other seed-eating birds from Senegal,
easy to obtain in France at present. In spite of great difficulty with
labour and food, a number of birds have been reared the last three
years.
'...as a home, Cleres hardly exists for me to-day; but the site
remains, picturesque and harmonious. If I never again can com-
pletely enoy it as I did in the past, since so much I loved is missing,
others can derive pleasure from it. It was, I think, my duty to
preserve Cleres to the utmost of my power...
&amp;apos;...In many ways, it is painfully different to-day, but it has kept
a great deal of its former charm, and glorious memories still dwell
under its tall trees, along its transparent waters, and in its ancient
stones. And gorgeous birds still live, call, sing, and nest in the
romantic old park.

had the pleasure of visiting many of my aviculturist friends in
different parts of the United States...
&amp;apos;In the vicinity of New York one of the first week-end visits was
to Mrs Erlanger's country place at Elberon, New Jersey. There is
certainly the choicest collection of small birds in eastern North
America... In a long garden aviary along the house, during the
summer are kept such insectivorous species as the Red-bellied
Niltava, White-capped Redstart, Indian Crested Tit, Fork-tailed
Flycatcher; also Frugivorous birds, such as Quetzals and various
Tanagers...
'One of the pearls of the collection is a beautiful pair of Scarlet
Cocks-of-the-Rock, finger-tamed and quarrelling to a minimum.
The male, thanks to a careful diet of tomatoes and other appropriate
food, has kept his brilliant deep red colour... They have already
played at nesting, and hopes are high for a brood some time' .. .The
outstanding success of the season, however, was the breeding of
two Yellow-winged Sugar-birds, which had been out of the nest a
couple of weeks when I saw them. An excellent Racket-tailed
Drongo, a tame European Robin, and Vermilion Flycatcher must
also be mentioned.
'There are several very good collections... of waterfowl in New
Jersey and in New England...
'...that of Mr J. Livermore, at West Redding, Connecticut,...
is excellent, far the largest in America. All the more current
species are represented, often by a dozen or more pairs. Among the
rarest are Blue-winged, Ashy-headed, Red-breasted, Emperor,
Orinoco, Ross's and Maned Geese, Coscoroba Swans, Baer's and
White-eyed Pochards, Ruddy Ducks, Golden-eyes, Cape and Mar-
bled Teal, Comb Ducks, Australian and South African Sheldrakes
and Crested Ducks... The collection of Doves is very good
including Plumed Ground, Grayson's, Bronze-winged, Galapagos,
and many other species...
'A little to the North, at Litchfield, Dr. Dillon Ripley has
gathered a very choice collection of waterfowl on a delightful little
lake fed by a stream... Hekeeps... many ducks, including Baer's
and White-eyed Pochards, and three rare and lovely Philippine
Mallards'.

'I have kept for the end a remarkable establishment which
during the last few years has become more and more familiar to me:
that of Mr W.J. Mackensen, at Yardley, Pennsylvania... one hour
out of New York. For some fifty years Mr Mackensen, alone in this
country has managed to make a steady living out of his birds,
mostly Pheasants, Peafowl and waterfowl..
'More than twenty years ago I went to Yardley to buy Geese, and
when I came to live in New York I got in touch again with Mr
Mackensen. I found him so utterly conscientious and reliable that
I asked him to procure or to handle all the birds I acquire for
Cleres... I enjoy the proximity of Yardley during the part of the
year when most of the birds I see are stuffed specimens, and
frequent visits to the Mackensen farm are welcome diversions&amp;apos;.

Mrs Erlanger&amp;apos;s Cocks-of-the-Rock did eventually produce
chicks which, however, do not appear to have survived. Though
otherwise unrecorded in this magazine, this event is referred to by
Jan van Oosten (1957, P.49).
'...I had unfortunately no time to visit Mr Thierry, near Oakland,
who breeds a few of the rarer Pheasants and has several pairs of the
White Eared Pheasant and Palawan Peacock-Pheasants, nor several
other excellent breeders, but I saw at leisure the two largest
collections in Northern California, both in the vicinity of Napa:
Those of Mr R.H. Gibson, at St. Helena, and of Mr Claude Hooke,
at the Circle H Ranch.
'Mr Gibson owns a great deal of land, mostly vineyards, and
a very important wine business... There are all sorts of game
birds... The most remarkable are Victoria Crown Pigeons.
Vulturine Guineafowls, Siamese, Malay and Bornean Firebacks,
White Eared Pheasants, Nicobar and Wonga-Wonga Pigeons and
Mountain Witches. Many young have been reared, particularly
Edwards', Blue, Brown and hybrid Blue x White Eared Pheasants.
'Away in the high hills and far from any town, the Circle H
Ranch is beautifully situated among forests of Redwoods, Califor-
nia Laurels and other interesting native trees. The game farm is
large and it contains the finest collection in America today... All
the species of Pheasants kept in captivity to-day are represented.

...I will end with a few words about Cleres. Thanks to Mr F.
Fooks' incredible energy and ingenuity, it has regained almost
completely its pre-war standard. Despite the disturbance caused
by thousands upon thousands of visitors, who are necessary due to
the very heavy cost of upkeep..., a number of young birds were
reared last summer, mostly waterfowl, game birds, pigeons and
parrakeets. Among the more interesting species, I should like to
mention five Red-breasted and four Greenland White-fronted Geese,
the latter for the first time in captivity...

No specimens of these southern Pintails had so far been seen alive
about anywhere in the world outside of these southern islands '.

'...this fine species has always been scarce in European collec-
tions, where a few have figured now and then in the past, but never
bred. In 1938 Mr C. Cordier brought to Cleres and to Leckford less
than two dozen birds caught, or reared from the eggs, in the Peten
district of Guatemala. But at the end of the last war the only birds
left in England were merely a couple of hens at the London Zoo.
'After the war Mr Cordier accompanied Dr. D.S. Mewill to the
Peten, and they brought over a nice consignment, which was
distributed among American zoos and a few game breeders. Two
or three young have been reared in recent years at the Washington
Zoo and at Mr C. Hooke's game farm near Napa, California, now
closed. But the only real breeding success of these fine birds has
occurred at the San Diego Zoo, where a very favourable climate as
well as special and adequate care by the Curator of Birds, Mr K.C.
Lint, make conditions particularly propitious'.
'There was a good stock of Ocellated Turkeys at San Diego when
I last visited the zoo on 29th June, 1952. Besides the three breeding
pens of a cock and three or four hens, five young birds reared in
1950 and five more hatched in 1951 make up a total of some two
dozen specimens. About twenty chicks were lively and well, and
others due to hatch. Mrs Benchley is determined to establish and
propagate this most interesting species and to distribute her birds'
offspring as widely as possible'.

'I had, of course, to keep birds. Possibilities, however, were
limited. I did not want to spoil the garden, and in town, noisy
things, which might bother neighbours, are not allowed. At the
north side of the garden, by the house, is a garage which I promptly
turned into a bird house. Nearby, a large window of the sitting-

This... aviary has a population of finches, one or two pairs of most
of the Australian species; Lavenders, Ruddies, and Cordon-bleus;
Avadavats; Auroras; Rainbow Buntings; Red Hooded Siskins;
Pintail Nonpareils, etc., about sixty altogether. There are also pairs
of Painted Quails, Mountain Witch, Bartlett's, Silver Diamond,
Talpacoti and Pigmy Doves; a Shama; Giant Whydahs; a pair of
Bourke&amp;apos;s Parrakeets, and a few Sugar Birds. When the housekeep-
er, who takes my place in the care of the birds when I travel, has
sufficient experience, more difficult birds will be added such as
small Tanagers and Sunbirds. As the garden is usually occupied
by wild Humming-birds, it is not necessary to keep any in
confinement where space is very limited...
'Along the fence following the first aviary is a similar one, 28
feet long, 10 feet wide. It contains a pair of Palawan Peacock-
Pheasants; pairs of Harlequin Quails, Bleeding-heart, Ashy and
Diamond Doves, Diamond Sparrows, Australian Crimson Finches,
several varieties of Zebra Finches, , Red-crested Finches, Cuban
Finches, Indian White-eyes, and a European Song Thrush.
'There was an obvious location for another aviary between the
bridge and the solid fence on the south side of the garden. It was
only a question of roofing over the space between the bridge and on
the sides. The result is a large flight, 50 feet and 20 feet, very high
in the centre over the stream which flows in a deep gully. I keep
there a few small ducks and teal, Mandarins, Puna and Sharp-
winged Teal, Maned Geese, Lesser Indian Whistling Ducks; some
Doves: Brush Bronze-wings, Cassin's, Peruvian Ground, Green-
winged, Chiriqui Ground-Pigeons, and a few other birds such as
Pekin Robins, Orange-headed Ground Thrush, Spectacled Jay
Thrushes, a European Blackbird, Dyal Bird, Tricoloured Spreos,
and Purple-headed Glossy Starlings.
'These Californian aviaries are few in number and small in size
compared to those at Cleres and, in the long past, at Villers. But
they are suited to the present circumstances and very attractive,
giving me much pleasure. At past sixty I am just as thrilled as ever
by watching my birds, and I still enjoy caring for them as I did when
I was ten years old. Bird lovers are incorrigible, I am afraid.

'Among my new birds in Los Angeles are Fairy Bluebirds,
Hooded Pittas and an Emerald Starling.
'The breeding season at Cleres was handicapped by Mr Books'
illness during the spring. However... many waterfowl bred, the
most interesting young being 5 Andean Geese, 10 Philippine and 5
Hawaiian Mallards. The latter come from a pair which I had kept
three years in Los Angeles without good results.
'...I spent the months of March, April and June in South Amer-
ica, first with an expedition of my Los Angeles County Museum to
Brazil, later on visiting Argentina, Chile, Peru, Ecuador and Co-
lombia, in the company of Mr and Mrs Dillon Ripley, in the
interests of the International Committee for Bird Preservation. In
the course of this very interesting journey I had an opportunity to
visit some collections of live birds...
'...in the vicinity of Rio de Janeiro... Dr. E. Beraut keeps in a
planted verandah a beautiful collection of Humming Birds, which
he and his collectors obtain throughout Brazil. But the visit that
I made with him to his friend, Mr F. Ruschi, at Santa Teresa,
Espirito Santo (the state just north of Rio) will remain in my
memory as one of the greatest thrills that I ever had. Mr Ruschi...
knows birds as well as plants; his property contains museums,
gardens and aviaries of the greatest interest. In particular he
has built an enormous flight, 300 x 100 feet and 30 feet high, where
hundreds of Humming Birds live and breed freely, including the
lovely little Coquette. I saw fifteen on a bush, all reared by one
original pair. There are about twenty local species in this aviary...
Furthermore, a beautiful large (100 ft. long) house has been built,
with a passage for visitors along its front, to accommodate the
equatorial species from Amazonia which will not stand the cool
nights of Santa Teresa.
'Both Mr Ruschi and Dr. Beraut now entirely feed their Hum-
mers on sugar or honey-water and on quantities of fruit flies. Even
the difficult, mostly insectivorous, species of Phaetornis and
Pygmornis do perfectly well on such a diet.

'In the course of this year I retired from the position of Director
of the Los Angeles County Museum, having reached the age limit
of seventy, and I had reluctantly to move out of my California
house. It was not possible to maintain it as I plan to stay there only
two or three winter months each year, spending the spring and
summer at Cleres, and the autumn in New York, not to speak of
many travels. I deeply regret leaving my garden and aviaries, as
it was great fun to grow exotic plants and to keep birds in this
wonderful climate. I had nine pleasant years in California and I am
thankful for the experience.
'Many of my Los Angeles birds have been sent to Cleres, but the
most delicate ones had to be disposed of over here, owing to an
unwelcome one-month quarantine imposed by France on all birds
from the United States and Great Britain because of Newcastle and
other avian diseases prevalent at present in those countries. Ob-
viously Sunbirds, Sugarbirds, Tanagers, Trogons, Cotingas, and
other softbills could not have survived it. It was a bitter disappoint-
ment.
'While California had one of the hottest and driest years ever
recorded, Normandy was very wet, like the rest of Europe, which
did not help in rearing birds. There were, however, at Cleres... a
number of Pheasants, including Mikados, Bel&amp;apos;s, Brown
Crossoptilons, Sonnerat&amp;apos;s, and Ceylon Junglefowls... The most
interesting waterfowl reared were two Australian Radjah Shelducks,
Brazilian and Puna Teal... A pair of Hyacinthine Macaws laid eggs
which did not hatch.
'A number of important acquisitions were made during the year,
the first being a pair of Congo Peacocks which the Royal Zoological
Society of Antwerp most kindly loaned us. They looked perfect,
but they have not laid yet. We received some good Congo birds
from Charles Cordier: Hartlaub&amp;apos;s Ducks, large Hornbills
Ceratogymna atrata , Ross&amp;apos; and Schueti&amp;apos;s Touracos, Amethyst Star-
lings. Black and Plumed Guineafowls; White-eared and Knysna
Touracos, Rufous Motmots also came, as well as a great many geese
and ducks.

improved, and by the next spring, our collection of such birds will

eaters. hand-reared from the nest. They are tame, they eat strips of
lightly cooked meat, insect mixture and grated carrots, with only a
few mealworms a day. They are in perfect condition, inhabiting a
large indoor flight. There is also an interesting pair of Yellow-

'One more of my old and dear friends has left us - taking with
him more of my fond memories ... John Spedan Lewis, a Vice-
President of the Society since 1939, died on 21st February, 1963.
'He had a very full life. We can only mention here the
tremendous work he has done in expanding very successfully the
large business he inherited from his father, and more so in turning
it into a partnership thus presenting his employees with the large
fortune he could have kept. Spedan Lewis' unselfishness and
idealistic generosity have few, if any, equals in the world today...
'Spedan Lewis joined the Avicultural Society in 1924 and I met
him at the Zoo the following year. He was then living at Hamp-
stead, where he had built some excellent aviaries, w ith large heated
shelters for rare passerine birds, particularly Birds of Paradise,
and a few others. He also had a fine collection of wild cats in
outdoor cages. He soon took great interest in owls and gathered a
large collection of them, w hich w ere housed at Wargrave and cared
for by Miss Ethel Chawner, a learned and enthusiastic naturalist,
and long a specialist of these birds.
'He became a member of the council in 1927. When he left his
house at Hampstead, he built a series of aviaries at Odney
(Cookham), a park used as a country club by the John Lewis
partnership. He acquired many more birds, including pheasants, a
large number of them brought over by Messrs. Frost, Webb. Shaw-
Mayer, and Cordier, sharing those collections with Ezra. Whitley
and me.
'Spedan Lewis moved to Leckford, Stockbridge, Hampshire, in
1933, and Miss Chawner followed him. Great developments soon
took place. With my advice, many very spacious pens for pheasants
were erected up on the hill, and they were as good as any I have ever
seen; also a large duckery was established in the valley on fast-

running chalk streams and ponds, in a perfect location. There were
furthermore, roomy pens for swans, geese, and cranes. Excellent
collections of all these birds were gathered, many of them bred at
Cleres...
* Spedan and I had great fun planning this accommodation. We
had become close friends through the years and saw a lot of each
other in England and in France. He was also a benefactor of the
London Zoo, presenting many rare species, and of the British
Museum, several expeditions being sponsored by him.
'A livestock department had been opened at Peter Jones, one of
the London stores of the Partnership, in 1938. It was soon closed
down, but a fortunate result was that Mr. Terry Jones, who had
been engaged to work in it, was then sent to Leckford... when Miss
Chawner, a great friend to him, was obliged to curtail her activities,
he assumed full responsibility for the collection... The Leckford
collection was at its height when war was declared. Mr. Jones
joined the Navy. It became more and more difficult during the
following years to feed and care for the birds. Many were disposed
of, particularly the cranes, but a good many species of waterfowl
and pheasants were preserved. It was lucky as European, and
even American, collections were replenished... from that valuable
nucleus'.

'I had wanted for years to have a glimpse of New Guinea... My
age does not allow me any longer to go on tiring and difficult
expeditions, as I used to in the past... Therefore a quick visit to Sir
Edward Hallstrom's Station at Nondugl [sic], in the Whagi Valley
of the Central Highlands, was a perfect opportunity. Sir Edward's
health last November did not permit him to come with me, but he
kindly aranged for my visit. I flew to Port Moresby, an insignif-
icant town among the dry hills of the coast, and soon a small, old
plane (DC3) was to take me to Goroka. However, landing there was
prevented by a storm, and I found myself at Madang, on the east
coast, which is hilly, lush and attractive. But soon a six-seater flew
me to up to Goroka, over the high mountains. The other passengers
were all native Papuans, in local dress - that is to say a small belt,
shell or bone face ornaments, and feathers in the hair... Another
little plane took me over a range to Minj, some 20 miles from
Nondgul [sic], where I was driven by landrover along a difficult
road, as the wide valley is cut up by ravines such as I had never
observed elsewhere. I was welcomed by Mr. Fred Shaw Mayer, the

well known collector, whom I have known well for many years. He
had brought over, in the thirties, year after year, magnificent birds
from New Guinea and the neighbouring islands for my late friends
Herbert Whitley, Alfred Ezra, and John Spedan Lewis, and also for
me. He now manages Sir Edward's property in New Guinea. I was
glad to spend four days with this old friend and to talk of the past,
as we have so many common memories'.
'Mr. Shaw Mayer has laid out the grounds at Nondugl with great
skill and taste, and besides the numerous aviaries, there are several
large ponds, beautiful trees and shrubs, and orchids...'
'The aviaries number nearly one hundred and consist of four
well-spaced rows of ten compartments, each of the proper size for
a pair of Birds of Paradise and of several groups of bigger ones. All
have large shelters at the back, and are very heavily planted, except
for a few containing Parrots and Birds of Paradise particularly
destructive to vegetation; some are very large...'
'Birds of Paradise predominate in the Nondugl Collection.
There were, in November. 1962, about 160 of twelve species;
Salvadori's, Finsch's Lesser, Blue, Ribbontail, Stephanie's.
Meyer's, Sicklebill, Carola's Six-plumed, Lore's, Wattled
Loboparadisea , Ring, Hunstein's Magnificent, King of Saxo-
ny's. I had never before seen the latter alive; there were several
males adorned with the tremendously long, horny head feathers.
Four species have successfully nested at different times; Blue,
Lesser, Ribbontails, Stephanie&amp;apos;s; the last two having also produced
hybrids. To this must be added Salvadori's. Three young,
plumeless males and several females live in a large planted flight,
and there was a nest. Mr. Shaw Mayer so far doubted that non-
adults could breed, but we looked into the nest; there were newly
hatched chicks in it!
'I had never seen before anything like the Nondugl aviaries and
it taught me a great deal. It appears to me that the usual treatment
of Birds of Paradise in Europe, and in the United States, is wrong.
Their cages are too small; they are given too much heat; they are
overfed. They should be in large, outdoor aviaries, well protected
from winds, with a large shelter at the back kept just warm enough
(40 to 50 degrees) during the coldest days. Indoor cages in
hothouses are unsuitable... The more space the better. The food
they receive at Hondugl consists, in the morning, of a mixture of
mashed papaya and banana (10 per cent of the latter), crushed dog
biscuit and fresh ant eggs. This food Is eaten by mid-day, when the
birds are given plain fruit, mostly papaya and any available berries.

Only a few (six to ten) mealworms a day; no meat. When ant eggs
and papaya are not available, comparable ingredients can be used
but, on the whole, this is a very satisfactory diet...
'There are other interesting birds at Nondugl; Pesquet's Parrots,
Green-winged King Parrakeets, Eclectus, Opopsitta , a Long-
tailed Buzzard Henicopernis , Victoria Ground Pigeons and
lovely little Salvadori's Ducks, three of which were brought in
when I was there
'Young were reared a number of times in previous years on the
large, natural ponds of the garden. Mr. Shaw Mayer found them
very pugnacious and one pair only could be kept on each pond.
Clutches always consisted of three eggs.
'While I was at Nondugl, native men and boys were constantly
coming in, sometimes large parties, to bring ant eggs and other
insects, fruit and berries, and sometimes birds. It always was
exciting and it reminds me of the good old days in Indo-China...'

'Too few people, in other countries, realize that some of
the best collections of live birds existing at present are located
in Northern Italy. It has been my privilege to visit a few of them
recently with my old friend Professor A. Ghigi, whose series of
pheasants, at Bologna, still count among the best in the world.
Some forty Hume's Bartails, eight Satyr Tragopans, and many
others have been reared in 1965 in his aviaries, and he possesses
such unusual species as Malay Crestless and Sumatran Firebacks,
Argus, Ocellated Turkeys, and White Eared Pheasants. It is always
a great pleasure to stay with him, as I have done for so many years.
At the age of 90, he is just as active as ever, and we did not waste
much time during the four days I spent at his fine villa on the hills
above the old city...
'Dr. P.F. Callegari has a big garden in the suburbs of Ravenna,
where he and his brother keep a large and unusual collection of
birds as well as a few mammals. Let us mention of the latter a
family of Lesser Pandas, with young born there, and a tame Great
Anteater which positively astonished me! He was curled up in the
fork of a large tree about 30 feet above the ground! I had no idea
that these large Anteaters were climbers - its owners stated that it
went up every morning, sleeping the whole day there, coming down
to feed in the evening, and spending the night indoors.
'The most difficult birds live in perfect condition in the
Ravenna aviaries. There are... some... birds at liberty in the

grounds, including a beautiful pair of African Jabirus [Saddle-
billed Storks]. Close to the house are many large moveable cages,
about 6x4 feet, which contain various insectivorous and fruit-
eating birds, several species ofKingfishers, Trogons and Tanagers,
a number of other seldom seen species, and best of all, a dozen Bee-
eaters, among them the beautiful Carmine Merops nubicoides ,
and the Pigmy M pusillus , besides European M. apiaster and M.
bullockoides, all in perfect condition. A pair of small Wood
Hoopoes were particularly attractive. These cages are brought into
a large hall during the winter. In September, a few birds were kept
there and two hand-reared Nightjars were its most exciting
denizens. Lots of live insects are reared and collected to feed all
these birds, hard to keep as a rule.
'There is in the garden a roomy greenhouse with indoor com-
partments and outdoor flights, full of rarities. Pied Kingfisher,
Rollers, Quetzals, etc., and many large aviaries. Several shelter
interesting birds of prey and pigeons, others almost a complete
collection of European Waders, particularly Snipe and three
Woodcock, tame and in perfect condition after over three years in
captivity... But perhaps the best of all is a large-domed one, with
an extensive pond of running vater (perhaps 30 x 15 feet) where
Mergansers and, more particularly. Great Crested Grebes are kept
in excellent shape, living there for many years. The secret of such
an unusual success is the fact that no fish, particularly cut-up fish,
is ever thrown into the pond, but are placed in a small catching
basin where the overflow from the pond falls and runs out contin-
ually. In that way, no fish oil can pollute the water in which the
Grebes swim. Otherwise they would have their feathers oiled and
soiled, and then die quickly...
Dr Roberto Bucci lives at Faenza and there are two collec-
tions that he has gathered. One is in the town's public park, where
Dr. Bucci has generously built fine accommodations... His home,
outside the town, is surrounded by a fine park... There are all the
existing species of Flamingos. Along one side are numerous
aviaries containing many species of pheasants, small birds, doves,
pigeons and parrots. I noticed among the latter a beautiful pair of

died on 27th January, 1967, after a long illness.
'Born at Briantspuddle, Dorset in 1892, Fooks came to Cleres in
the spring of 1920, as I was settling down in the Chateau. Seriously
wounded in action in France during the First World War, he had
worked for some time at the livestock department at Derry and
Toms in London. Before the war, he had kept and reared birds
which he loved as a boy.

after a few years, he took charge of the whole property, which
became the unique object of his interest and devotion. It is because
of his great efficiency and reliability that I was able to leave every
year on expeditions to Indo-China and elsewhere, and to travel
extensively... He was a master at keeping and rearing birds, and
also a perfect agent to run the estate 5 .

'His loss has been a terrible blow to me after forty-seven years
of close association and friendship.
'Dr. P. Ciarpaglini, a veterinarian and an assistant at the Paris
Zoo, has come to succeed him, and I have taken measures so that
the Chateau and the Park will go, after me, to the Museum National
d 5 Hi stone Naturelle and the Department of the Seine Maritime. It
is the only hope to perpetuate what is perhaps the last of the larger
country homes adorned with an extensive collection of birds and
park animals, such as we knew a number in Europe before the war,
which have since vanished. I therefore trust that all the years of
incessant labour that Frank Fooks has devoted to Cleres will not
have been in vain. To me, it never can be the same without his
presence'.

'Today, air transportation has changed the picture entirely.
Native trappers in remote parts of the world can despatch their
catches easily by aeroplane and the flights are so fast that even very
delicate birds can be left unattended until they reach their destina-
tion. Innumerable species which had never before been seen
outside of their native countries, many beautiful and unusual:
Humming Birds, Sunbirds, Quetzals, Tanagers, Cocks of the Rock,
etc., are frequently exported in numbers - in fact, they have been
captured far too much; the early losses have been tremendous by
lack of careful and knowledgeable handling and restriction of such
activities is urgently needed. As a result of this new situation, the

great harbours and bird shops of such as London, Liverpool,
Marseilles, Le Havre, Antwerp, Rotterdam, Hamburg, Genoa, have
been closed, and the new ones are found in the vicinity of the main
airports.
'As circumstances have changed considerably, so have the bird
collections; very few large private ones remain, while numerous
new zoos, large and small, open to the public, have appeared,
particularly in England and in France. Several of these maintain
very good bird collections. Keen bird keepers and breeders,
however, who maintain comparatively small numbers of rare and
difficult species, very well housed and cared for, are even more
numerous than they used to be, and they carry on with the same skill
and enthusiasm the work of their predecessors'.
'It is interesting to note that, as time passes, bird-keeping is
gradually becoming less difficult...'
'Avicultural Societies, of which there are only a few in the
world, ours being the most important, are probably more prosper-
ous today than at any previous time. This is mostly due I believe,
to the greatly increasing interest of the public in general in natural
beauty, and birds stand at the top of the ladder. It seems to be
one happy result of a sad human situation: the artificial, cramped,
distressing conditions of life of so many city people make them
crave for trees, flowers and birds. It contributes to the increase of
our membership'.

'In my early days, orthodox ornithologists considered avicul-
ture just as a nice hobby, and it was generally accepted that the
observation of confined birds was scientifically worthless. Captive
animals were supposed, as a result of a lack of knowledge, not to
show the greatest part of their natural behaviour patterns. I am
happy to state that a complete change of opinion has since taken
place. Perhaps, in a small way, I have contributed to this favour-
able reversal, as a good deal of my ornithological work has been
based on the study of captive birds, even those of a systematic
nature. My friend Konrad Lorenz, probably the best ethologist of
our time, has done more than anyone else to make aviculture a
recognised scientific endeavour.
'Practically all his remarkable work has originated in the obser-
vation of captive birds as well as other forms of animal life. We
both started very young as enthusiastic bird lovers and keepers;
neither of us have any reason to regret it. Aviculture at present, has

very important technique of Biological Science, as it is necessary

The Great-billed Parrot, Tanygnathus megalorhynchos , was
little known on the British avicultural scene until 1987 when a
sizeable consignment was imported. Little has been heard or
written about them since that date and no breeding results have
been reported. When first imported they were advertised at around
#1,000 per pair but owing to lack of interest and demand, the price
plummeted fairly rapidly. They are now rarely available. It does
seem a pity that more effort was not made by parrot enthusiasts to
breed this very lovely bird in captivity particularly as it is unlikely
that many more will be imported.
The Great-billed Parrot has a wide distribution in the islands of
Indonesia and is also found in West Iran and in one of the Philippine
islands where it is assumed it was introduced. It would appear that
many of the various island races have minor distinctive colour
differences.
My present pair were purchased in March 1992 and from the
beginning showed every sign of incompatibility. The hen was the
dominant bird and whenever I was in the proximity of their aviary,
she persistently biffed the cock with her beak at the same time
making threatening croaking sounds. The cock was never seen to
defend himself and fairy rapidly made off from her unwelcome
attentions. They always roosted in the shelter but never side by side
- always several inches apart.
The flight in which they are housed is 12 feet long by 6 feet high
by 3 feet wide. The shelter, open fronted, is 3 feet long. Their nest
box, which is in the shelter, is 20ins. x 12ins. x 9ins.
In mid May 1993 the cock was seen several times going through
the motions of regurgitation whilst alongside the hen but no
transference of food was witnessed.
On 18th May the hen was in the box at feeding time. She
emerged but re-entered the box within a couple of minutes. Inspec-
tion on 19th May revealed one egg. A second egg was laid four
days later on 23rd May and the cock was seen feeding the hen on
the same day. On 17th June, 29 or 30 days after the first egg was
laid, the sound of young was heard. On 18th June, the hen was out
of the box at feeding time. Inspection revealed one chick and
pecking was heard in the second egg. Mid afternoon on 19th June,
the hen was again out of the box. A quick inspection revealed that

<bodyText confidence="0.99922280952381" page_id="56230817"  page_num="218" year="" vol="">
the second chick had arrived. Both chicks were alive and well on
20th June. The next opportunity to inspect the box came on 24th
June, when sadly the younger chick was found dead. Its crop was
empty and it is likely that it had been dead for some days.
The birds were fed on sunflower seed and a mixture of three
parts canary seed and one part each of hemp, wheat and oats. A
vegetable mix of chopped carrot, peas and sweetcorn was also
supplied.
Following my usual practice, all hard seed was withdrawn a few
days before the eggs were due to hatch and supplanted by soaked
sunflower together with the aforesaid vegetable mix, both dusted
with a proprietary nutritional powder. Many years ago, I lost a baby
Muluccan Cockatoo, incubated and reared for five days by a hen
Eclectus, it's crop packed with canary seed. Since then, no hard
seed is given until the young are at least three weeks old.
When the young Great-billed arrived, it was noticed that most
if not all the chopped carrot and peas were left in the food pot.
After a few days, the sweetcorn content was increased and the other
two ingredients decreased. The carrot and peas seemed not to be
touched. I continued with this mixture for a few more days, all the
sweetcorn was eaten but I was not certain whether or not some of
the carrot and peas had been eaten. A mixture of sweetcorn and
chopped apple was then given, together with six peas and six pieces
of chopped carrot. On the following day, the pot contained six peas
and six pieces of chopped carrot, the rest had been eaten.
On 29th June, when the chick was 13 days old, it was completely
bare all over its body, not a hint of down. No sign of any feathers
beginning to erupt. At 18 days old, down was starting to grow on
its rump. One eye was open.
Mid afternoon on 11th July, all soaked sunflower had been eaten
but the fruit and vegetables had not been touched. It is usually
mostly consumed at this time of day.
The chick's crop was almost full. Sunflower was put in the food
pot and both birds quickly ate it and the hen re-entered the nest box.
Later that evening, the hen was out of the box. the chick was very
noisy and its crop was empty. It was taken out for hand rearing. It
ate ravenously and made no sound when gulping the food as do
cockatoos and African Greys. It was 25 days old and had pale grey
down on its rump, paler down on its breast. Its head and cheeks
were completely bare and pin feathers were erupting on its wings.
The mandibles were a rich orange.
At five, weeks old the wings were well covered in dark sheaths

and green feathers had emerged from sheaths on its shoulders. The
head was darkening in colour. At six weeks old, green and yellow
tail feathers were emerging. A few days later, hints of green were
appearing on crown and cheeks and some yellow/gold on wings.
On 5th August, the cock was found dead on the food shelf, his
right wing was almost severed at the shoulder. I have little doubt
that this was a post-mortem injury inflicted by the hen. Another
cock was purchased on 14th August, but more about that later.
When eight weeks old, bright blue feathers had appeared on the
centre of the chick's back. The breast was olive green and its head
and cheeks were well feathered. Its tail was P/a" long. A week
later it was transferred from the feeding box to a cage. It could
roost comfortably on one leg.
On 24th August, when nearly 10 weeks old, it had been vomiting
some of its food for a few days. An injection administered by a
veterinary surgeon cured its crop infection and later that evening it
ate avidly from the spoon. When 12 weeks old, it had been nibbling
seed for about two weeks but not consuming very much. It had
started vomiting again, was very thin and extremely noisy when
hungry. On 11th September when it was 12 weeks and three days
old, it was lying on the perch supporting itself in this position by
its beak resting on a cross bar of the cage. It was removed from the
cage and was unable to stand. Its crop was still full from its feed
some seven hours earlier. It died soon afterwards.
The new cock did not get a welcome reception from the hen
when introduced on 14th August but this was as expected. Great-
billed hens are quite definitely the dominant partners. No fighting
took place as the cock offered no resistance and quickly sought
refuge on another perch.
On 1st May, 1994, pairing was observed twice. The following
day, the cock was seen feeding the hen. This pattern continued for
some days and on 11th May, the hen was seen entering the nest-box.
On 15th May, the hen did not emerge from the box at feeding time.
On 23rd May, the hen was out of the box at feeding time and
inspection revealed two eggs. One egg was much smaller than the
other and later proved to be clear. On 13th June, one chick was seen
in the box. The chick was regularly inspected but only when the hen
was out of the box. The cock never entered the box nor was he ever
seen to look into it.
On 10th August, when the chick was just over eight weeks old,
it was seen roosting on the nest box entrance for the first time. It
had a large flat crown like the cock as opposed to the smaller and

more rounded crown of the hen. On 25th August when it was ten
weeks and three days old, it emerged from the box. Five days later,
the chick re-entered the box and spent some hours there. This was
the only occasion on which it was known to re-enter the box.
The chick was feather perfect, glowing with health and beauty.
The hen was very attentive to her progeny and was seen to feed it
regularly. The cock ignored it completely and was never seen to
approach it.
Chick at six weeks old
When about 12 weeks old, the young bird was seen visiting the
food pot. At 13 weeks, it was probably independent. It was a strong
and accurate flier from the time it emerged from the box and
permits closer human approach than either of its parents. It is also
probably marginally larger than either of its parents but apart from
that, the only noticeable difference is in the colour of its eyes,
which are a dark brown, unlike those of the adult birds which have
pale yellow irises. The black wing coverts which are edged with
gold are no less colourful than those of its parents.
Sad though it was to lose the chick which hatched in 1993, the
fact that it was hand-reared enabled me to make a detailed photo-
graphic record of its development.

Despite its name, the Abyssinian Ground Hornbill Bucorvus
ahyssinicus ranges widely over most of central Africa from Gambia
in the east, to Ethiopia in the west and extending south to Kenya and
Uganda.
It is the largest of the hornbills spending most of its day on the
ground hunting for small mammals, reptiles and insects, returning
to trees only for the purpose of roosting at night.
Unlike other hornbills the pair do not seal the entrance of their
nest cavity. Even so, the female rarely leaves the nest throughout
incubation and the male supplies food while watching over the nest.
Two eggs are laid four to five days apart. Incubation begins with
the first egg, giving little chance for the second hatchling to
survive.
The Paignton pair of hornbills are kept in an aviary comprising
an outside viewing area measuring 4 x 6 x 2 m. high, with off-show
inside quarters 4 x 6 x 3 m. high. During early 1993 two nest boxes
were placed in the house, one of which, a tunnel type, was placed
on the floor and the other, of a more conventional shape was fixed
- 30 &amp;quot; -
Nest Box
at a height of 2 m. Although interest was shown in both boxes the
higher one was preferred. Dried peat was spread in the box while
dried leaves and twigs were scattered for nest building.

Eggs laid throughout 1993 were always broken and so on 25th
January this year two eggs were taken for artificial incubation.
The female had been sitting for eight days, both eggs were found
to be fertile and were placed under a broody bantam. On day 36
they were transferred to a still air incubator set at 39.5* centigrade.
The smaller of the two eggs had begun to lose weight excessive-
ly by day 3 3, and despite an increase in humidity, a 20% weight loss
had occurred by day 38. The chick was assisted from the egg on day
40, but unfortunately remained weak until its death at 5 days. A
post mortem examination revealed a diseased liver.
The bigger egg pipped on day 38 and, hatched on day 39 with
only a 13% weight loss. The chick&amp;apos;s navel was dabbed with an
antiseptic. After being left in the incubator overnight it was moved
to a brooder set at 35* centigrade. Being blind, naked and helpless
the chick was confined in a small tissue-lined tub.

At first the task of persuading the chick to feed proved difficult,
however learning was rapid and it soon settled down to a regular
feeding routine.
The food consisted of finely chopped chick and mouse muscle
seven times daily. After a few days, soaked Diet A (Mazuri Zoo
Foods) was added once daily with a sprinkling of SA37 and much
bone meal.
Soon after hatching, the chick&amp;apos;s skin became dry and flaky.

humidity, petroleum jelly was rubbed onto the chick's skin once
daily until the pin feathers were coming through. This worked well
and further prevented the faeces sticking to the chick&amp;apos;s rear end.
The temperature of the brooder was reduced by 2.5* on days 12,
20, 24 and 30. Pin feathers were showing and the chick&amp;apos;s eyes began
to open by the 11th day. Over the next 2-3 days, as the eyes opened
fully, it became very vocal at feeding times.

By day 24, whole mice were taken and the chick was moved to
a larger plastic box. To prevent leg splaying, cardboard egg trays
were placed under clean wood shavings.
By day 65 when feeding had been reduced to 3 times daily the
chick was standing well, but still unsteady when walking. From
that date it progressed very quickly and by day 80 was walking,
running, learning to fly and was exercised in the grounds mornings
and evenings.
During February the adult hen laid a second clutch which she sat
for the full 39 days, unfortunately both eggs disappeared. At the
time of writing (May 1994) a third clutch has now been removed for
artificial incubation.

SOME THOUGHTS ON A VISIT TO BRITAIN IN
MARCH 1954

By Marvin L. Jones (San Diego)
In March 1954 I undertook a tour of various zoological collec-
tions in Great Britain, which included a stop at Belle Vue Zoolog-
ical Gardens (Manchester). There, Gerald lies, the long-time
Director, suggested that I might like to go on to London with him,
and attend both a performance of Sadler's Wells Ballet (it was a
Command Performance) and also go to the 42nd meeting of the
Avicultural Society, of which he was a Member.
Zoological collections had been a hobby of mine for many years
and in September 1951, as a member of the American Army, I
arrived at the town of Bingen on the Rhine from where, over the
next few years, I would visit many of the live animal collections of
western Europe.
At the suggestion of Gerald lies I joined the Avicultural Society
and in the January February 1954 issue of the Avicultural Magazine
an item was published in which I described the bird collection at
the Cologne Zoological Gardens. Dr Wilhelm Windecker, Director
there, had allowed me to use the guest room of that zoo from early
1952 and there I met many of the directors of other collections, so
that when I travelled out I rarely stayed in hotels but rather in zoo
guest rooms.
An unforgettable stop was at Chester with George Mottershead
to see his vast collection of ivory carvings and hear his account of
the creation of the then fast-building Chester Zoo, now the princi-
pal collection in the United Kingdom.
Thanks to Arthur Prestwich and the then Head Keeper of Birds
at London Zoo, Alf Woods, I soon found myself busily visiting
many private and public collections, reporting on them in the
Avicultural Mazazine or International Zoo News .
In December 1993 I retired after almost 19 years caring for the
animal records at the Zoological Society of San Diego and have
begun, along with Dr Nerbert Schifter of Vienna and Dr Koen
Brouwer of Amsterdam, a series of papers on bird longevity. The
first, on Storks, has been published in the International Zoo Year-
book. Forthcoming shortly will be the next on Ibises and Spoon-
bills, to be followed in order by Herons and eventually all of the
other families of birds.

lake on which the birds depend for food. The cause of the decline
is not clear, although the lake's water level has fallen due to
reduced rainfall which, in turn, has led to smaller numbers of brine
flies on which the birds feed.

removing the first of them for artificial incubation. Both adults
shared incubation of the second egg which started to hatch on 18th
November but the chick could not be found the following day.
Meanwhile, the other youngster is thriving in San Diego's Avian
Propagation Centre where food is offered by a lifelike hand puppet
to prevent imprinting.

POACHING THREAT TO AMAZON
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992876384615385" page_id="56230826"  page_num="227" year="" vol="">
The Red-tailed Amazon Amazona brasiliensis is confined to a
stretch of coast 250 km long and 30 km wide in Brazil's Parana and
southern Sao Paulo states. Heavy poaching is causing the popula-
tion to decline rapidly. There were 4,000 birds in 1989 but this
number had fallen to 3,000 in 1992. Trapping continues while
nesting cavities are damaged when nestlings are taken. Although
the species is legally protected, enforcement is almost nil. Most
of the parrots are smuggled to Europe and the USA and there is no
proven record of captive breeding. It has been suggested that local
fishermen and their families - who are the worst nest-robbers -
should be offered economic incentives to act as unofficial guards,
and that an education campaign, aimed at local people and started
in 1992, should be extended.

INDUSTRIAL CHALLENGE REVEALS 250 SPECIES

As the 1994 BTO-Zeneca Bird Challenge for Business entered
its final leg the British Trust for Ornithology revealed that nearly
250 species had been logged across 64 industrial sites. Sightings
indicated that Britain is enjoying an unprecedented invasion of
Little Egrets Egretta garzetta and there are hopes the species may
soon breed in the UK. Owls were well reported but only one site
(Shell UK at Stanlow) confirmed five British species - Tawny,
Barn, Little, Long-eared and Short-eared. Although they were not
eligible for inclusion in the challenge, observers reported a number
of &amp;apos;exotics' including Red-billed Weaver, Cockatiel, Budgeri-
gar, Helmeted Guineafowl, Cape and Ruddy Shelducks, Chiloe

Volunteer fieldworkers have begun carefully searching the UK
for Barn Owls Tyto alba as the world&amp;apos;s most detailed survey of the
species gets underway. The aim is to find out how many of these
once common birds remain in the British countryside. The three-
year survey is being run jointly by the British Trust for Ornithology
and the Hawk and Owl Trust. It is the first nationwide survey of the
species for 10 years.
