any species of bird which has not previously been known to breed in
captivity in this country. Any member wishing to obtain the Medal must
send a detailed account to the Secretary within eight weeks from the date
of hatching of the young, and furnish such evidence of the facts as the
Executive Committee may require. The Medal will be awarded only in
cases where the young shall live to be old enough to feed themselves, and
to be independent of their parents. The decision of the Committee shall
be final.
The Medal is struck in bronze, and measures inches in diameter.
It bears on the obverse a representation of tw-o birds with a nest containing
eggs, and the words "The Avicultural Society--Founded 1894." O11 the
reverse is the following inscription : " Awarded to (name of donee ) for
rearing young of (name of species ) a species not previously bred in
captivity in the United Kingdom."

By D. Seth-Smith, F.Z.S.
Although the past summer has been all that could be
desired for breeding foreign birds out of doors, the spring was
most trying, excessively cold nights being experienced in May
and June. Several nests in my aviary produced nothing in the
early part of the season ; Parrot-finches nested early and sat
well and most of the eggs were fertile, but for some unknown
reason the birds left the nest a few days before the eggs were
due to hatch, although no human being, at any rate, approached
the nest.
A pair of Crimson-finches have behaved in much the same
way, the only difference being that they have on one or two
occasions actually hatched their eggs, but the young have
perished at an early age. They r sit very closely&amp;apos;- and defend their
nest capitallyE
A pair of Sydneys Waxbills hatched two young birds early
in the spring, which got on very nicely r until they were beginning
to be fledged when an extra cold night killed them.
Diamond Doves have not done so well with me this year
as last. Myr old hen is quite blind in one ey^e and shews unmis-
takable signs of old age--so we must not expect too much from
her. The first nest in May produced one young bird--a cock--
which was successfully reared. A second nest in June likewise
produced a single bird (hatched on the 19th) this time a hen, which
was also reared all right. These two young birds were afterwards
transferred to another compartment in which lived a solitary&amp;apos;-
cock of the same species (one we reared last year) which had,
throughout the spring, been cooing in vain for a mate. He
immediately took possession of the y r oung hen and I fear rather
persecuted the other. On September 2nd, I noticed the last
year's cock sitting upon a newly made nest, and, prompted by^
curiosity, drove him off and discovered a single egg. The same

evening the young lien (now 75 days old) was seen on the nest
and the following morning it contained two eggs. This nest was
was, however, deserted before the eggs were due to batch but one
contained a young bird. Surely it is most unusual for a bird so
young to breed? I have taken care not to let her nest again.
The old pair of Diamond Doves hatched and reared a third
young one in September.
A pair of Redrump Parrakeets have only reared one
young bird--a male--now a very tine fellow. The} 7 were quite
ready to commence breeding in February, but their present
abode could not be got ready for them before May. They should
do better next year if all goes well.
The Chinese Quails made a nest in the grass--a slight
hollow in the ground scantily lined with hay--and the hen
laid six eggs, all of which hatched on August 1st, incubation
having lasted 19 or 20 days. The chicks when first hatched were
remarkably pretty little things, striped dark brown and buff, and
so tiny were they, and so fast did they run that they really
reminded one more of large insects than of birds; indeed so
small were they that I deemed it advisable to promptly remove a
pair of Sacred Kingfishers (Halcyon sanctaj to another compart-
ment in case they should take them for some new kind of beetle,
and swallow them whole. They were all successfully reared,
chiefly upon fresh ants' cocoons and the large winged ants that
are found in ants' nests, and of which they seemed particularly
fond ; they seemed rather afraid of the ordinary "worker" ants.
Curiously enough these six little Quails which are now in full
plumage have all turned out to be cocks. The old pair went to
nest again, laying as before six eggs, two of which were
accidently broken before I had any idea of a second nest. Four
chicks appeared on September 14th, but one of these somehow
choked itself with a feather (I have it now, stuffed). The other
three are now a nice size, but I cannot yet tell for certain to
which sex they belong, but I believe they are hens.(a) Can it be
that two clutches of eggs are usually produced in the season by
this species, the first producing mostly males and the second
females? It does not seem to be known for certain whether, in
a wild state, the common Painted Quail breeds twice a year or
only once. Mr. Hume, quoted in Mr. Ogilvie-Grant's "Handbook
to the Game-birds," writes of this species : "I have reason to
suspect that they may breed twice a year, but the matter is still
doubtful, as the different periods at which we have found the
("). They have turned out to be two hens and a cock.

nests may be due to difference in the climates of the localities in
which we met with them."
On the 22nd of August, a pair of interesting little hybrids
between a cock Indian Silver-bill and hen Dwarf-finch left the
nest. They are at present much like their male parent, but have
shorter heads and smaller bills. In colour, they somewhat
resemble him, but are rarher darker, and the upper tail-coverts,
instead of being pure white, as in the Silver-bill, are yellowish
brown. At the present time (October 7th) there is a second nest
of hybrids from the same parents, and from the noise they make
they appear to be getting on well The Silver-bill feeds them
most industriously.
A pair of Rufous-tailed Finches f Bathilda ruficaiidaJ made
a beautiful nest in the grass, composed of living grass cleverly
woven into a dome, and lined with dry hay ; but they devoured
their eggs.
A pair of Long-tailed Grassfinches nested and laid plenty
of eggs but without results, I think they must be both hens.
Besides the foregoing, we have reared a nest of five
Cockatiels and have another brood of four in the nest; half-a-
dozen Zebrafinches and three Bengalese complete the list of
birds reared here this summer.
OUR TAWNY OWLS.
By Miss R. Arderson.
Some of the earliest and pleasantest of my avicultural
recollections are those of the Tawny Owl.
Some years ago when staying at Scarborough, we saw a
most beautiful specimen hanging in a parrot cage outside a
dealer's shop. The bird looked so disdainfully miserable in its
captivity that our youthful hearts were moved with pity, and for
five shillings we became its owner. On enquiry of the dealer if
he had any more, he disappeared in the shop and brought out a
small blinking Owlet. How old it was I have no idea, but its
head was covered with down and it had also a quantity on the
wings. For seven and sixpence we bought the two birds and
brought them home. They were both very tractable, and
delighted in being petted, and especially for anyone to ruffle
their hand in the deep feathers at the back of the neck. Both
had enormous muscular power in their legs and to remove them
from a perch, when they wished to stay there, was a matter of

<bodyText confidence="0.979099409090909" page_id="32637837"  page_num="4" year="" vol="">
great difficulty. We named the Owls Jimmy and Joey, though
to this day I have no idea of the sex of either. We kept them
for some years, but they never showed any inclination to nest.
For food we gave them ox liver cut into small pieces, this was
their staple diet, varied by scraps from dressing poultry or
game, and any mice we could get. In default of the latter we
gave them small pieces of rabbit skin, as some sort of fur seemed
necessary to keep them in health and to enable them to regularly
throw up large pellets. The Owls much preferred liver to raw
beef, and sometimes when the supply of the former ran short and
I used the latter as a substitute, their disgust at my conduct was
most marked. Joey would stand beside the food-pot and scatter
the offending substance right and left, hardly 7 eating a single
piece.
Some good friends of ours used to send us many dead
mice, sometimes (w r hen the stacks were thrashed) as many as
seventy at once. This was indeed a red letter day for the Owls,
and especially for Joey, for his besetting sin was decided greedi-
ness. I have often seen him swallow five or six very small fur-
less mice in rapid succession. They were eaten without ceremony
but in the case of larger mice the bones of the head were first
broken in the Owl's mouth before being consumed--invariably 7
disappearing head first. Often the tail of the mouse would hang
out of the Owl's beak sometime after the rest of the body had
disappeared. We often saw both birds drink, they 7 were also
very fond of bathing in a large bowl. Their manner of doing so
was very curious and never varied. As they were very shy about
being seen during the process, it was only by 7 patient watching
that I could observe them. The older bird always sat on the
basin-edge and dipped his face several times very solemnly into
the water before finally going into it. Once inside, he fluffed out
his feathers to such an extent that no water was visible, and
made a great splashing. Joey 7 was far shyer in his ablutions.
The bath seemed to have a terrifying fascination for him. He
would draw up his feathers cpiite closely until his legs appeared
a great length and then nervously run forward as if he were
treading on hot bricks. He always reminded me of a child
taking its first paddle, but having got fairly in the water he
thoroughly 7 eujoy 7 ed himself, and generally emerged looking a
perfect scarecrow, with dripping feathers, when he would run
very rapidly up and down a loug perch to get dry 7 .
Joey 7 and I were always great friends, but when we had
had him for some time an event occurred which effectually 7 sealed
his affedtiou for me. One day I found he had broken his upper

mandible nearly in two. It was only held by a piece of skin,
and to make matters worse the break was so high up in the beak
that it was quite impossible for him to hold his food. I feared
he would die of starvation, and, with very faint hopes, I cut up
some raw meat very finely and after adding a small quantity of
water, held it in a spoon to the side of his beak. To my delight
he sucked the fluid in. I fed him every hour or so for days
(fortunately the broken half of the beak could rest on the lower
part) and eventually the injured portion knit together again
quite firmly. It was not quite straight, but he could eat as well
as ever, though he loved to be fed with a spoon long after it was
quite unnecessary. Joey was intensely grateful, and when he
caught sight of me down the garden, even at some distance off,
he would start calling twee ! twee! very loudly.
We kept the Owls for some years, and then Jimmy (who
had never been so contented as the younger bird) began to grow
restless. One day he flew at my face, but instinctively putting
up my hand I only received a few claw marks. After this we
thought it was perhaps kinder to give him his liberty, and as
Joey would have been very lonety by himself we decided to let
both of them go. We took them in a hamper into Clumber
Park, and in a beautiful woodland glade opened the hamper lid,
and then retired some distance off to watch the result. Jimmy
was off at once, but Joey bade us a long adieu. I felt a strong
inclination to run forward and shut the lid and take him home
again--but I refrained, and so ended my only experience of

THE NESTING OF THE BEARDED SEED-EATER
AND OTHER BIRDS.
By Miss Grace Ashford.
Last autumn, I purchased, what I understood to be, a pair
of Green Singing Finches, but what I now judge to be, from Dr.
Butler's description, " Bearded Seed-eaters."
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.971056571428571" page_id="32637838"  page_num="5" year="" vol="">
As time went on they both sang loudly and continously,
there was just a shade of difference in size but none in colouring
or song (since May, the colouring of the male is much brighter).
I made up my mind they were two males, and turned them
into the aviary, which is an outdoor, unlieated one, with a hen
Canary and a hen Green Singing-finch ; these four with a pair
of Pekin Robins and an Orange Bishop, out of colour, spent the

winter together, and the Seed-eaters could be heard for a
considerable distance, so loudly did they sing.
The end of April, the smaller of the two laid several eggs
on the sand and one in the canary seed pan on the floor, on
which she sat. I removed the egg, but she still sat on. I placed
comfortable nests within reach, but she would not leave the seed
pan. I left home for a fortnight in May, and on my return she
was still sitting in the seed, and had not laid any more eggs.
Noticing that the male was feeding her, I took away all
seed vessels from the ground, and they then set to work house-
hunting in earnest.
On June 26th, the Seed-eaters took possession of a nest
built by Waxbills, lowered the roof and flattened out the lower
part ; it was rather tip-tilted but looked safe ; that night the hen
slept in the nest ; on the 30th, she was sitting on four eggs, and
on July 13th,, hatched two young ones.
On the 15th, I was away all day and on my return found
the young ones forsaken and dead.
On the 25th, she was again sitting on four eggs, and on
August 6th, she hatched one chick ; this, two days after fell or
was thrown from the nest, I replaced it and it was fed, but in
the evening it had disappeared, and I could not find even the
cold remains.
I then pulled out the unsafe nest and hung in its place a
roomy box.
On the 15th, she had again laid four eggs ; these came to
nothing, and to-day, September 18th, she is busy with the nest
again.
I never saw the male feed the young, but he constantly
fed the hen both on and off the nest, and they have never
quarrelled.
They are very tame and interesting, and I should be glad
to know if any member has had a similar experience, I cannot
say where the fault lies that none of the young were reared.
Now 7 may I go back to June 27th, and the hen Canary
referred to ; she, on that day, began to sit on three eggs in an
open nest high up in the aviary, which she had built of hay and
grass. I had thought of removing her, but concluded she might
be of use as foster-mother so she was allowed to remain. While
she was sitting, a young White-throated Finch (that I bought in
his nest-feathers, not knowing what he might be) fed her, and
defended her and her nest from the interference of others with

great spirit; the eggs were clear. She at once made another
nest in a box over the door; I let her sit her time, and on the
fifteenth daj^ (July 28th) took down the nest for the purpose of
throwing away the eggs, I was astonished to find two strong
young ones, these were reared, both birds feeding them, and on
August nth they left the nest ; one is now singing. They
look much like green Canaries of a bronze tint, one has white
feathers in the tail, shape and markings of wings and tails some-
what like the White-throat, upper mandibles darker than lower,
legs and feet light horn colour. I suppose when they moult
their nest-feathers they may alter. The White-throat continued
to feed the young till they could feed themselves.
I have had little success this summer ; the intense heat,
tho' suiting the birds well, seemed to dry up the eggs.
Cordon-bleus, a lovely pair, have nested three times : result
eggs only.
Silverbills (African) ditto, owing, I believe, to my having
kept the young of last year as well as their parents ; I have been
so successful with them hitherto.
Zebra-finches, for the same reason, have only reared some
half-dozen youngsters.
Bronze Mannikins, one young one died when a week old.
A Striated-finch mated with two Bengalese, a brown and
white and a fawn and white, all three incubated and fed the
young, there are seven of them. They are in build like the
Striated-finch but much lighter in colonr, some with light throats
and a few white marks.
The greatest disappointment I have had this year, was to
find a fine young Golden-breasted Waxbill dead in the nest.
On Thursday night it w r as strong and noisy, on Friday morning
early, I noticed the little parents in trouble, and on taking dowm
the nest box there was one dead bird and one egg, no doubt the
parents had been driven out of the nest in the night by mice and
the youngster died of cold ; its crop was full, flights half out of
their sheaths, eyes just open, breast-feathers showing. A
destroyed Zebra-finches' nest with young thrown out, and a Grey
Waxbills' nest with eggs containing young which had been
gnawed, told the same tale, also a hole in the border of earth in
which the shrubs are planted.
Among my most perfedt birds that have been out since
May, are Lavender-finches with coats like satin, Golden-breasted
Waxbills, Jacarini, Reddish, Guttural, Aurora, Cherry-finches
and a male African Fire-finch.

The birds, both male and female, were trapped three years
ago in the garden, and have been undisturbed in their present
quarters ever since ; as regards the male he was caught just after
the first moult, and was in possession of the light grey mark on
the head (common to all) running longitudinally from the centre
of the crown to the base of the neck, which he did not lose till
after the third moult, and was then in splendid trim with
brilliant and perfedt markings.
By the way, do Chaffinches breed in a state of nature
before they lose the aforementioned marks ?(&amp;lt;z). It appears to me
that they are not fully adult till after the third moult, when these
marks are lost and they are in full adult plumage, when they would
be between two and three years old ; this I cannot confirm, but I
know this, my male totally ignored the hen till that time, though
she courted his notice, built each year, and laid several clutches
of infertile eggs.
Before passing to the actual fadt, I would like to say that
though the swooping flights and violent courtships, common to
them were indulged in, so much so, that by the time they were
fully paired both bore marks of the conflict they had been
through, yet there were no attempts at copulation in the air
(though they had the space) ; it took place sometimes on the
ground, but most often in the branches ; this was alwaj^s followed
by a sort of gurgling rattle on the part of the male, also
occasionally indulged in when chasing the hen ; for myself I do
not believe the Chaffinch ever copulates in the air. ( b ).
Now for the nesting. Immediately they were paired, the
hen began to build in an earthenware nest-bowl hung close
against the roof, the male gave her but little assistance, carrying
a few straws during the whole of the process; materials used
Were fresh grass, hay, groundsel stems and down, and a few
feathers; four eggs were laid of the usual type; incubation
(a). They certainly do.

lasted fourteen days, the cock taking no part in this, but he
assiduously fed the hen on the nest. By the time the fourteen
days expired but one egg remained (I think my Pekin Robins
were the robbers), this was successfully hatched, the youngster
being very strong and lusty and did well for the first three days,
then all went wrong ; they tried hard to feed it with mealworms
but failed, and though I promptly sent off for some gentles,
there was some delay in transit and they arrived too late to
save the fledgeling, which died during the morning of the fourth
day.
I am hoping for complete success next year, as I shall be
able to profit by the experience of this, and get a supply of
small insects ready in time.
I also noted that though the Chaffinches ordinarily took
freely both of the usual soft food and ants' cocoons always in the
aviar} r , after the youngster was hatched they touched neither for
sometime, though now they are eating both freely.
The fledgling was blind for two days ; it was covered with
longish yellow hairs; its skin, flesh-colour with dark bluish
patches on the head and wings,
I should say, in conclusion, they have about forty com-
panions--Waxbills and Finches, and a pair of Cockatiels; had
they been alone perhaps they would have successfully reared the
nestling.
CORDONS BLEUS.
By Mrs. Barber.
Since I started keeping birds, about two years ago, I have
generally had one Cordon-bleu, at least, and at present there are
three (one cock and two hens) in a compartment of my bird-
room, with about forty of the smaller Pinches and Waxbills.
One hen I have had about eighteen months ; she is very
tame and sings very prettily. When I turned my birds from
their cages into the bird-room, I bought a male Cordon-bleu,
and put him in with the hens. In two days he was dead. I got
another (a fine healthy-looking little fellow) and the next morn-
ing I saw him moping in a corner all " fluffed out." I knew
what that meant, so I watched to see if I could find out the cause
of it. Almost immediately the two little hens flew down and
danced all round him, pecking and calling him, and finally drove
him all over the aviary ; so I caught the poor little thing and
caged him, but he died very shortly.
A few days later I introduced a third male (after having
caught my little "singing" hen and put her in a cage). When the

remaining lien saw the new arrival she promptly " went for
him," but he did not allow himself to be bullied and kept " the
lady" in her place. After a week I put back the second hen,
when the cock started making advances to her almost diredtly,
and those two seemed to think they might start a nest.
About 3ft. off the floor, I had hung a small box in which
my only pair of African Fire-finches had built a nest, and the
hen had laid four eggs and started to sit. What must that pair
of Cordons do, but decide upon that box for their nest, and
there was a great scrimmage, but the Fire-finches were driven
out by the Cordons who did not even go into the box, but stayed
close by all day and defied the owners to return. Towards
evening the Fire-finches started carrying hay into a straw
basket-nest a little higher up, but it was no use, the Cordons
kept them out of that too. I tried to catch the offending pair,
but they were so quick and it frightened the other birds so, I let
them be, but very easily caught the Fire-finches and transferred
them and their basket to a large cage, where they built a nest ;
the hen laid nine eggs but would not sit, and the other morning
I found her dead--egg bound.
To return to the Cordons, they have not yet decided which
box or basket they will have.
My small experience of these pretty little birds is that they
are quite capable of holding their own (especially the hens) with
birds of their own size and a little larger. The " singing" hen, the
other morning, saw the cock Bearded Tit take a mealworm from
the dish ; up she hops, seizes the other end of the worm and
pulls ; the Tit also pulls, and the poor mealworm comes in half,
and off go both the birds, each (I am sure) thinking the other
defeated.
Note. -- With reference to the delicacy or otherwise of the Cordou-bleu, my
experience is that there is great difference in different specimens. I have a cock which for
seven and a half 3&amp;apos;ears has never ailed, but which has lost eight wives in succession.--

THE INDIAN GOOSANDER.
From the Proceedings , Asiatic Society of Bengal, for March, 189S.
Mr. F&amp;apos;rank Finn, Deputy Superintendent of the Indian
Museum, exhibited a living specimen ot the Indian Goosander
(Merganser comatus ), and read the following note on its walking
powers.
The specimen of the Indian Goosander (Merganser comatus
Salvadori) which I have the honour of exhibiting to-night has
been very kindly lent to me for the purpose b} r Mr. W. Rutledge,

of Fntally, who tells me that this is the only specimen of the
bird he has ever received in the course of his long and extensive
experience as a dealer in living animals.
The bird being so rare in captivity, I have thought it
worth while to point out, by means of this specimen, that Mr.
Hume was mistaken in thinking that the species is unable to
walk. He says (Game Birds and Wildfowl of India, Vol. III. p.
301) : " O11 land one only sees them resting near the water's
edge, and when disturbed they shuffle on their breasts into the
river. I do not think that they can walk at all. Anyhow, I have
always seen them just half-glide, half-wriggle, breast foremost,
and I think touching the rock, into the water."/A)
But from the actions of the bird now exhibited, it is easy
to see that the Goosander can walk like other ducks, and does so
in the same attitude as they, though it is not so active on land as
the less aquatic species. No doubt the birds seen by Mr. Hume
were simply disinclined to stand up and walk property when they
had but a very short distance to go, and preferred the lazier
methed of locomotion he describes in the passage above quoted.
REVIEW.
Bird Life in an Arctic Spring.
This is a small book, containing the diaries of the late Mr.
Dan Meinertzhagen, a member of this Society, and Mr. R. P.
Hornby, on a bird-collecting expedition in Finland. The diaries
have been reprinted just as they were written, da}^ by day, on the
northern fells, and, if they lack the polish of notes written for
publication, it is more than compensated for by the freshness of
the narrative, which enables the reader to enter into all the
the authors' hopes and disappointments as though they were
fellow-travellers.
The latter portion of the book gives a short account
of the live eagles kept by the author, and is illustrated with
numerous photographs and drawings, many of them from the
living birds. The book, which was, originally, only intended for
private circulation, and of which a very limited edition has been
printed, is published by R. H. Porter, of 7, Prince's Street,
Cavandish Square.
(c). The bird was here put down on the floor and made to walk about, which it did
in the ordinary manner of ducks, though unwillingly, having probably not recovered con-
dition after a long journey from the Hills. A specimen of the allied Merganser castor not
distinguished from the present species by Hume, who calls both Mergus merganser op. cit.)
which I saw last year in the London Zoological Gardens constantly walked about quite
freely, as did some Smews {Mergus albelltis) observed at the same time and place.

Sept. 30 2 Lanceolated Jaj'S --Garrulus lanceolatus
Hymalayas. Western Aviary.
1 Eclectus --Eclectus (sp. inc.) Parrot House.
Among the new arrivals, the Maroon Oriole is, perhaps,
the scarcest and least known ; it is now to be found in the
Western Aviary, and is a very disappointing bird to view, being
of a sombre brown, the edges of the breast-feathers edged with
white, and the vent and under tail-coverts, yellow. Although
rather wild, it seemed in splendid health and well accustomed to
its new quarters. In the same aviary was a Hoopoe, a splendid
bird and remarkably tame. These birds would, I think, form
excellent aviary birds, and I wonder they are not more widely
kept. I looked in vain for the new Eclectus in the Parrot House,
but fancy they must have been placed 'behind the scenes.' The
Parrot House, to those who can put up with the noise and heat,
is well worth a visit ; for apart from a very good collection of
Parrots and Parrakeets, many in perfect condition, there are
several very fine Toucans, especially a Toco Toucan (. Ramphastes
toco ) which is as fine a bird as it has ever been my lot to see in
captivity. The recently-arrived specimen of the Regent Bird is
also there, but it is a dull coloured bird, though in the best of
health aud condition.
There were several Tanagers and Honey-eaters. The
former crowded together in Parrot Cages, in which it would be
impossible for any bird to do itself justice. The latter were,
however, rather better treated, and the best of these were a
pair of Yellow-tufted Honey-eaters ( Phornis ciuricornis ) in dark
green plumage, with gorgeous yellow gorget.
In the Western Aviary are a nice collection of Doves,
including all the kinds usually kept in confinement. A splendid
specimen of the Eong-tailed Glossy Starling (. Lamprotornis ceneus )
a bird closely allied to the Green Gloss3^ Starling, but having a
tail like a Whydali Bird, shared an aviary with a Sun Bittern and
two beautiful Australian Rails (. Rallies pectoralis ) ; next door to
them might be seen a nice collection of British Shore Birds, and
several species of Whvdahs and Weavers. The Crows' Cages
well repay a visit, most of the birds being clean-moulted and in
good trim. The Australian Piping Crow will alwa} ? s whistle a
tune, and, if you are not careful, a Magpie will shake your hand
in rather a forcible manner.
Among the larger birds the King Penguin, near the Lion
House, should not be missed ; it is a bird from Antarctic Seas,
very rarely seen in confinement, and it is at present in very good
condition.

ASSUMPTION OF BREEDING PLUMAGE BY THE WEAVERS.

Sir, --Re Mr. Todds' remarks on tlie assumption of breeding
plumage by the Orange Bishops, for some time I studied my Weavers with
the pre-couceived notion that it was brought about by a growth of colour
in the feathers, and so, for a time, I missed the mark.
Before going into full detail, I wish to wait for another season's
observations; but I have got so far that I may state definitely (in confirm-
ation of Mr. Todd's remark) that while none of the wing feathers are.
moulted, save a few of the large flights, the whole of the head, neck, and
breast feathers are imperceptably shed, and new feathers produced. This
is common to all the Bishops, and they have only to be caught while the
change is taking place, to establish the fadt beyond doubt. Again, their
demeanour during the change is the same as during the moult, and thej^ may
be observed helping nature by removing some of the feathers themselves.

Sir, --I think it ma}^ interest the readers of the Avicultuial Magazine

At present the3? have no distincive plumage ; the}- are grey-brpwu all

reminds me of a St. Helena. Their beaks (which are still brown) are like
Zebra Finches; their feet and legs, like St. Helenas'.

Sir, -- I can assure Dr. Butler that my hen Pennants are identical
with Mr. Farrar's and Mr. Grace's; and, notwithstanding what he asserts to
the contrary, I still believe them to be ti&amp;apos;pical birds of Platycercus elegans.
Since my last note, I have disposed of one of mj r hens to a lady
member of the Societv-, who, in a letter acknowledging the safe arrival of
the birds, says, "Mrs. M. notices that she has got the green tail feathers
about which so much has been written in the Avirultural Magazine ."
F. W. Oates.
Sir, --It is hardly likely that neither Mr. Farrar nor Mr. Oates know
a Pennant from an Adelaide Parrakeet ; and, on the other hand, Dr. Butler
and Mr. Fillmer tell us that undoubted female skins in the British Museum
have blue tail feathers; and Mr. Cocksedge's and Mrs. Lancaster's evidence
is still more convincing -- especially Mrs. Lancaster's, because the bird has
died during the controvers}&amp;apos;, and dissection has settled the question of sex.
Is it not possible that there are two varieties of Pennant ? According
to the Museum Catalogue, Dr. Butler's idea that the lieu is an Adelaide will
not help us, because it says the tail of the Adelaide is the same as the

Sir,---A llow me a few lines in answer to Mr. Astley. He says, " Do
not all 3&amp;apos;oung Australian Parrakeets resemble for the most part the adult
female when they leave the nest ?" I say, certainly of four sorts, emphatically,
No.
Young Redrumps show the cock and hen plumage at once, so do
Mealy Rosellas, so do Pennants, and so do Crimson wings. In my nest of
young Crimsonwings there were two cocks and one hen, jnst as distinct in
the red of the wing as any gdult, though only a month old.
C. D. Farrar.
Sir,--I say once more in the most emphatic manner that my birds
are Pennants and nothing else ; and anybody that likes may see them.
What more can I say ?
It is very difficult to describe the colour of a bird, in writing; and
some of the writers have wilfully exaggerated and distorted the difference
in colour I spoke of--so much so, that they actuallj' want to make out
that I have two separate breeds, a Pennant and an Adelaide. It would be
about as sensible to say that I have a cock Pennant and a hen Mealy
Rosella, for the difference is no greater than between a cock Pennant and a
hen Adelaide.
With regard to Mr. Fillmer's remark that I wrote black in my first
article, it was doubtless a misprint for blue owing to my bad writing.
I no doubt wrote " blue," but the poor printer read it into " black."
C. D. Farrar.
Note. --The above is only the end of a long- letter from Mr. Farrar, the former part
of which we regretfully suppress, because it seems to us unnecessarily personal.--E d.
Sir,--M r. Fillmer, for some reason best known to himself, persists in
speaking as though I had only one hen Pennant. Now he knows perfectly
well from my Notes that I must have two at least. As a matter of fact I had
three, but sold one to Mr. Oates.
Mr. Oates has two. Mr. Grace has one. He had three, but sold two
of them.
All these birds were absolutel} 7 identical in colour and plumage with
my No. 2, the mother of the j&amp;apos;oung ones. No. i was rather more oraugy-
red in colour.
How many hen Pennants does Mr. Fillmer require to be convinced of
identity of species ? Does he fondly imagine that Adelaides are so abundant,
that silly dealers sell them to the unsuspecting ones as hen Pennants ?
Fond delusion ! Ask Mr. Abrahams ! I wish I could light on five Adelaides
on such easy terms.
Mr. Fillmer saj _ s, " We admitted that Mr. Farrar's female (observe the
singular number) is a true example, etc.,"--he is as far off as ever from
proving that all females differ from the male as his does.
Now I have produced six common hen Pennants, not one; all exactly
like my No. 2, except the first I wrote about, which was rather more
orangy-red in her colour , and yet I am calmly told they are Adelaides.
I leave it to our readers if I have not proved my case up to the hilt
against Mr. Fillmer and Dr. Butler. The six birds are common hen
Pennants, and the offspring of my pair are common or garden Pennants,
and not Mongrel Pennant Adelaides. C. D. Farrar.

June from Mr. W. Rutledge, of Entally, who states that he received them,
together with a specimen of the Blue Rock Thrush ( Petropliila cyanus)
recently, from Naini Tal. The man from whom he procured the birds
stated that he could get others, so that the species is probably not
uncommon. I have no hesitation in describing it as new, as it differs
markedly from any of our Indian Weavers, and does not agree either with
the description of any of the allied African forms to which I have access.
I have much pleasure in naming this handsome novelty after Mr. Routledge,
whose services to Indian Natural History, and to the Museum and Zoo-
logical Gardens in particular, are so well known ; and I charaterize it as
follows : -- Ploceus rutledgii, sp. nov.
" Very similar to the male of Ploceus baya in breeding-plumage, but
easily distinguishable by its larger size, and entirely yellow under surface.
" Both specimens have the same colouration and are of about the same
size, but as one has a stouter head and is brighter than the other, and
constantly sings (d), it is possible that they are male and female and that
the sexes will prove to be similar in this species. A full description, with a
coloured plate, will hereafter appear in this Journal.' " F. Finn.
ENQUIRY.
Sir,--I should be very much obliged if some member will tell me if
the following birds can be safely wintered in a rather cold outdoor avian 7 ,
facing S. E., and only sheltered by glass shutters on the N. W.; the inner
part is open to the front, but has a deep roof with perches and nest-boxes.
The following are the birds--Bleeding-heart Doves, Rosey Pastor,
Nonpareil, Indigo Finch, Green Singing Finches, Mannikins, Greyjavas,
Weavers, Painted Quail (one hen), hen Virginian Nightingale.
Can you tell me if it is possible to secure a Rosey Pastor hen, and if
they ever breed in captivity ? (Mrs.) A. C. Charrington.
The following reply has been sent to Mrs. Charrington --
I am not quite sure about the Rose-coloured Pastors, but, as Starlings
are generally hardy birds, I should not be afraid to try it.
All the others have certainly been kept out of doors throughout the
year by more than one aviculturist ; I have kept them all myself in quite
cold aviaries.
At the Berlin Zoological Gardens, a pair of Rosey Pastors went to nest
in 1893, and would probably have reared a brood if rats had not destroyed
the young. It is probable that Messrs Abrahams or Jamrach would be able
to get a hen for you. A. G. BuTLER.
(d) It also displays weaving&amp;apos; proclivities and frequently drives its companion about,
though not in a hostile manner. Some species of the Yellow African Weavers have the
sexes similar or nearly so, though this is not the case with any Indian species.--F. F.

cage, just arrived from Havre. This was the first time I had
seen the species offered for sale, and, in fadt, the first time I had
ever seen the Dove anywhere; and being struck with their
prettiness and miniature size, I immediately purchased a pair(n).
They were in bad condition as regards plumage ; their wings
had been cropped quite close, so flying was altogether out of the
question ; and many of their tail feathers were broken. Mr.
Cresswell sa}^, in the above mentioned article, "They are
terribly difficult to import from their extreme timidity. Over
and over again cages of them have been shipped for England,
but none ever arrived alive. They absolutely batter themselves
to pieces." The man who shipped those that my pair came
from may have been aware of the difficulty, and it may be
the explanation why they were shipped with wings cropped as
closely as they could be cropped--to reduce their movements and
fluttering in the cage in which they were packed, and their chances
of self-destrucfion, during the voyage over, to a minimum (#).
(a) The remaining- six were disposed of shortly afterwards, i.e. two pairs sold, and
the last couple eventually put into a cage with a pair of Lophotes. The latter very soon
killed them, it appears--as was to be expected ; and they were allowed to do so by the
dealer !--A. S.
(d) I bought a pair in July of the present year ; the female could fly, but the male had
to be placed in a cage, where it has entirely recovered its plumage. This trick of throwing
the tail upright is very peculiar.--A. G. B.

is
As soon as I got my pair home, I removed all the cut and
broken feathers, and put them in a good sized aviary containing
some foreign finches. In a few weeks their new feathers had
grown, and they could fly quite well. During the time they
were unable to do so, I was at home, and had a good opportunity
of watching their movements on the ground. When not hiding
in a snug corner I made for them, lined with hay for warmth at
night and for sleeping purposes, behind a bundle of pea-sticks,
they were running very quickly about the aviary, bobbing up
their tails "Blackbird fashion," picking up tit-bits on the floor
and visiting the seed-dish (containing white millet and canary
seed) and uttering now and then a little coo. They have been
shy and timid birds from the first, and still are ; trying yet to get
out of sight as soon as approached. Since they have regained
their powers of flight, they have abandoned their sleeping
corner on the ground, and spend nearly all their time on the top
of a box and branch that shelters it, fixed up close against the
ceiling of the aviary. I have put a wicker nest, basin shape,
lined with a little nesting material, in the box, and have also
made a nest in the pea-sticks close by, hoping they will
eventually adopt one or the other and breed. So far they seem
much too timid to do so ; but when they get more accustomed
to aviary-life their timidity may leave them and the chances of
breeding be greater.
With regard to plumage, they resemble in several respects
the Bronze-winged Pigeon fPhaps chalcoptera ). They have bronze
spots on the wings as this Dove has, and also salmon-coloured
feathers under the wings, visible when flying. The neck has
very pretty mottled markings. The sexes are much alike in
plumage, but there is a difference in the tint--the cock vinaceous
and the hen ashen--this seems to be the distinctive mark
between the sexes, and, if correct, five out of the eight I saw
were cocks.
The only note I have heard from my pair is a little coo,
uttered when one bird is alone and calling the other, or when
they are startled and are about to fly off to some secluded part of
the aviary. They seem exceedingly fond of each other and are
scarcely ever seen apart; they feed together, fly together, sleep
together and are, in fadt, inseparable.
I do not know if any English aviculturist has been
successful in breeding this pretty little Dove, but they have been
bred in France, and in Germany (by Russ) too.

THE BLACK CASSIQUE.
( Cassidix oryzivora .)
By Reginald Phielipps.

From time to time one meets with an attractive looking
bird which one would like to purchase ; but the thought that
the beguiling stranger may work havoc amongst the other
inmates of the aviary makes one pause. If an account of the
species can be found in any book, one reads it greedily ; but if
no such book be within one's reach, or if the book utter an
erroneous or uncertain sound, serious consequences may ensue,
and grievous wrong may be inflicted, to say nothing of a possible
waste of a substantial sum of money.
On 26th February, 1898, I gave a heavy sum for a Black
Cassique, and introduced a viper into the bosom of my family,
just because there was not any friendly book to warn me. Since
that date, in the Aviculhiral Magazine, in the Feathered World, and
in Foreign Bird Keeping, there have appeared accounts of a
specimen which was in the possession of one of our members,
who had found it "very peaceful towards other birds." The
following gruesome tale, however, will exemplify the truth of the
old saying that there are two sides to every question--even to

the character of Cassidix oryzivora, and may possibly be the means
of saving some fellow aviculturist from the sorrow and loss
that befell me.
At page ioo of vol. iv. of onr Magazine, under its Dutch
name of Zwarte Kivispaal, I briefly referred to my first meeting
with this species. In general beauty, especially as regards the
development of the neck-feathers, this specimen was superior to
either Mr. Russell Humphry's or my own --possibly because it
may have been an older bird, probably because it was kept, as a
tropical bird should be kept, in a warm, well-sheltered place.
The sight of Mr. Russell Humphry's Black Cassique
at the Palace Show of February, 1898, had so stirred up my
recollection of the admiration with which I had beheld the
Amsterdam specimen that, on a fine healthy male being offered
to me on the day already mentioned, being ignorant of its evil
nature, and having no means of learning about it, I purchased
the bird, and considered myself a happy man. It came from a
long way up the Amazon--so I was told, and probably with a
measure of truth, judging from independent evidence obtained
through other sources. It was still in its foreign-made travelling
cage, and its wings were cut.
For several weeks I kept my new acquisition in a six-foot
cage in my dining-room. There were some little finches in the
room, which were often let out for a fly ; and I noticed with
concern that he kept the closest watch on the movements of
these little things, darting at any that might chance to come
near his cage, and, terrier like, betraying the greatest eagerness
to help me whenever I was driving them home or trying to catch
them. However, when the April Magazine came out, and I read
Mr. Russell Humphry's account of his specimen, I was greatly
comforted, and concluded that my bird's excitement was only
his " play."
While in this room, the bird's feathers were steadily
growing, and about the middle of April he could fly sufficiently
to be transferred to the birdroom with garden aviarj^ attached.
Here he was very gallant, making love promiscuously to several
female birds of various species ; but the males for the most part
he pursued with such determination that I could not help feeling
a little uncomfortable notwithstanding Mr. Russell Humphry's
experiences. When I was in the aviary, he was quite an
exemplary character ; but why, when I was out of sight, did he
pursue the birds, especially some of the Parrakeets, with such
relentless earnestness, and why did the birds generally regard

him with such suspicion, if he were truly " very peaceful towards
other birds " ? and, as he became more powerful on the wing, I
became more and more alarmed. But it was the old old story.--
He was a grand bird and I was unwilling to part with him, and
consequently unwilling to think any evil of him. Besides, he
fed largely on seed ; and, in addition to all this, I had talked
the matter over with an " authority," who had assured me that
none of the Cassiques are " rapacious."
In the " Royal Natural History," there is a reproduction
of an illustration of a Crested Cassique busily working at the
skull of a mouse, a pursuit which did not seem to me to be quite
consistent with the above assurance--but then many illustrations
are drawn with the view to pleasing the ej&amp;apos;e rather than of
illustrating facts. With this picture in mind, my feelings may
be imagined when, one morning, I picked up a mouse in the
birdroom which had had the back of its skull neatly opened
and its brains abstracted, but was otherwise untouched. This was
a warning I had no right to have disregarded, for no bird but the
Cassique could have dealt with the mouse in this fashion. I
seem to have been infatuated ; but, then, how about Mr. Russell
Humphry's peaceable bird, and the " authority ! " It is a bad
quality in a man to be wanting in faith--excepting perhaps when
he happens to be an aviculturist.
I have already stated that the Cassique made love to any
female, and hunted only the male birds in my aviary. All the
males were ver}^ strong on the wing, and the females also for the
most part, but there was one exception. I had a female Orange-
flanked Parrakeet, who had come to me with cut wings ; she was
now well on in her moult, but had not yet obtained full powers of
flight. She was a great pet of mine; and she always looked to
me to protect her from her stronger companions : her trustfulness
in my care especially endeared her to me.
One day I had been out for a few hours, and, on returning,
went into the birdroom to have a look round. There was a
scared look about the birds, and instinctively I felt there was
something wrong. I gave one or two calls to reassure them, still
looking sharply about, when, from underneath one of the
houses, I saw something crawling towards me. For the moment
I could not make out what it was alas, it was my poor little
Orange Flank, who, hearing m3^ voice, blind, with tottering
steps, was coming to me with a mute but ghastly appeal for help.
At no time does a man feel his insignificance so completely as
when the dying appeal for help. He yearns to help but is

absolutely helpless. All that I could do for the poor little thing
was to crush out the last remnants of its hapless life. The
Cassique, in endeavouring to pierce the skull and get at the
brain, had gouged away every atom of skin and flesh from the
entire head and face to half way down the neck.
Within forty-eight hours the Black Cassique was an
inmate of the Western Aviaries of the London Zoological
Society.
When offering him to the Society, I had warned them that
he was a dangerous bird ; and when the attendant came for him
I spoke on this point. But the attendant was light-hearted :
they were going to place him with (I think) the Jay-Thrushes,
who would know what to do with him should he venture to
meddle with them.
On August 10th (1898) I asked the keeper how the Cassique
was getting on. His tone was not very jubilant. He had tried
the Cassique with this bird and with that, and with a like result--
the Cassique went for them all. However, he (the keeper) was
happy now ; he had placed him, as a last resource, with the
Laughing Jackasses (Dacelo gigasj, and he wouldn't interfere
with them. I fear I forgot the Cassique for a while, but this last
June, being at the Western Aviaries, I again inquired after him.
With an ominous shake of the head, the keeper had to confess
that at last he had taken to go for the Jackasses, and he had been
obliged to shut him up by himself.
On September 6th, I found the Cassique loose again, and
this time in company with Mr. Russell Humph^'s bird. Both
were on the ground, the latter apparently on its last legs ; the
former spiritless, woe-begone, and utterly crestfallen, and quite
unlike his old self--why, I did not stop to inquire, owing to an
approaching thunder-storm.
O11 October 27th, I was told that Mr. Humphry's bird was
dead, but that Mephistopheles was all right. He had had his
wings cut , however, for, as the keeper said, with great emphasis,
" he was a little too much ! ! ! "
It will be seen from the foregoing story, I think, that it is
not safe to judge of the character of a species from the behaviour
of a single specimen, and that a non-rapacious bird may be a
very dangerous one.
So little seems to be known of the Black Cassique that a
few details may well be placed on record in the Avicultural
Magazine.

It is a slim small-headed bird, almost snake-headed, long-
legged like the Chough, standing and roosting high, and, like
the Chough, it fights savagely with both feet and bill, uttering at
the same time a not un-Chough-like caw. But while the Chough
frequents the ground, and works about among the stones in
search of insects, jabbering (c) to himself the while, the Black
Cassique, no lover of the ground, works away amongst the
boughs of the forest trees, as silently as Satan, -- and up aloft, in
a wild state, probably obtains a large proportion of its food.
My Black Cassique fed largely on canary and other seeds,
including hemp, which he used to shell ; indeed, with me he
lived chiefly on seeds and mealworms. Occasionally he would
eat fleshy fruit, such as a cherry, carrying it up to a perch, hold-
ing it down with one foot, and eating it by tiny pecks, for with
ever}&amp;quot; food he seemed to swallow only the tiniest morsels. I do
not know that he ever touched raw, but occasionally he would
peck at a small piece of cooked meat ; and ordinary insec-
tivorous food he would just peck over : altogether he was a very
moderate feeder. But he w 7 as keen after small insects, not only
snapping at winged creatures as they passed him on some high
perch, usually at the top of a dead tree, but darting into the air
after them within a range of some three feet. He was naturally
a shy retiring bird, keeping mostly to the trees. Not that he was
afraid of. the ground, but he showed an unmistakable preference
for an arboreal life. When on the ground he walked with an
uncertain gait, and occasionally lapsed into a lopsided-Magpie's
shuffling hop. He was very wild, suspicious, cunning, and sly ;
no bold honest knave like the Hunting Cissa, but rather
saturnine, and well deserved the name of Mephistopheles, which
he bore while with me. Although not delicate for a foreign bird,
he keenly felt and disliked the cold.
He was very vain, and would spend hours on a warm day
showing himself off. Holding himself perfectly upright like a
Pouter Pigeon, with bill pressed down over the crop, he would
draw in and hold his breath--like the frog in the fable -- until he
reached the bursting point. I do not know that his neck-feathers
were really much elongated, but he made the most of them by
the manner in which he depressed the chin while elevating the
head. The small smooth face of the bird, with the eyes protuding
as if they would start from their sockets, set in a frame or frill of
the long neck feathers, reminded me of an Owl's face when
( c ) Thus the male ; but I cannot speak for the female, who is comparatively very quiet
and retiring&amp;apos;.--R. P.

mounted as a hand screen. At length he would have to let go
his breath, which would suddenly escape with a violent gasp.
This process, on the top of his dead tree, and surrounded hy as
many female admirers as he could gather around him, would be
repeated interminably if not interrupted ; and when the sun was
shining the colours were very brilliant, not gaudy but chaste.
Another point in his favour was that he was very quiet, not
noisy, in the aviary.
By the Zoological Society he is called a Black Hangnest,
but I think the title of Cassique is better.
And this brings us to a very interesting point, concerning
which it is necessary to say a few words.
The sub-family of the Cassiques ( CassicincE ) is characterized
(by the naked and exposed nostrils and) by the expansion of the
base of the upper mandible into a frontal shield. In some of the
genera, of which there are about nine, this frontal shield is
much expanded and elevated at the base, in others onty slightly
expanded and elevated. In addition to this, there is sometimes
a backward prolongation of the hinder extremity of the lower
mandible. In some cases, the expansions, elevations, and back-
ward prolongations are very remarkable ; nevertheless, not in
any work to which I have access, is the faintest reference made
to or hint given of the probable uses in the economy of the
CassicincE of these exceptional and almost unique developments.
In some instances, too, the bills are unusually conical. Some
are comparatively short and stout, others longer and curiously
slim towards the tip, all the species probably taking their food
generally in a similar manner, each differing perhaps in detail.
In the Black Cassique these developments are very mode-
rate ; but for all that I think Mephistopheles betrayed the family
secret while with me, if secret it be, for realty it is only a develop-
ment of some of the actions of the familiar Brazilian Hangnest.
For nearly two months he was under close observation in a six-foot
cage in my dining-room, inside of which, running lengthwise as
a perch from end to end, there was a fine stick of timber, which
had once flourished in my aviary, and which may be regarded
for the present purpose as a horizontal bough in his native
Amazonian forests. Travellers tell us that in the forests of
Central America, Brazil, etc., there are any number of dead and
dying boughs, and living ones too, which are covered with
growths of many kinds, and of necessity rotten bark abounds ;
and these forests are the home of the Cassiques--and of count-

<bodyText confidence="0.999286232558139" page_id="32637858"  page_num="25" year="" vol="">
less myriads of insects. My bird in his cage, and afterwards in
the aviary where, thanks to the Parrakeets, there are several of
these dead trees, some arranged horizontally, would at first, and
until he had lifted off every particle of bark, creep along the
bough with the greatest caution, minutely examining the bark,
under which he would from time to time insert his bill, pushing
it under the bark as far as it would go, until the bark came
against the forehead. Opening the bill in the well - known
manner of many of his relations, slowly but steadily the dead
and perhaps half-rotten bark would be uplifted, and underneath
he would cautiously spy for insects. A bird doing this continu-
ously would be continuously rubbing his forehead and the hinder
extremities of the lower mandible against the projecting edges
of the bark and other matter ; and one has only to consider what
this means to perceive the value of the developments referred to.
And in my opinion it is by hunting in this and kindred w 7 ays
amongst the boughs and rank arboreal growths that the Cassiques
generally obtain a large part of their food in their wild state.
I should like to have closed this account of the Black
Cassique by saying something pretty ; but, alas, this may not be,
for I fear that the members of this particular species are a bad lot.
The Cassiques (CassicincsJ as a body, so far as we know
them, are a hard-working, industrious, and respectable sub-
family. They are said to build elaborate purse-like nests,
which are suspended from the branches of lofty trees, as
may be seen on reference to the illustration in the Royal
Natural History already alluded to. It is from this habit
of suspending their nests in some form or another that many
of their relations are known as Hangnests. But the Black
Cassique will not build a nest for itself. It will not soil its hands
with the marks of honest toil. It is far too cunning to work so
long as honest folk exist who are soft enough to work for it.
Like a good many of the Cuckoos, Cow-birds, etc., and not a few
specimens of the genus Homo, Mephistopheles will play but he
will not work. To use an expression which is common in some
parts of Scotland, it is his custom to " sorn upon his relations."
According to good authority, Mrs. Mephistopheles (I hope this
title is due to her, and that she does not take after her disreputable
connections the Cow-birds-- Molothri) places her eggs in the nest
of some relative, from preference selecting that of the Yellow
Cassique, Cassiczis persicus. In those regions which are not
frequented by this latter species, rather than build a house of
her own she will put up with that of the Crested Cassique,

THE AUSTRALIAN WOOD-SWALLOWS.
By H. R. Filrmer.
I believe that nothing has hitherto appeared in our
Magazine about these curious birds, beyond a brief reference in
Show Reports. So far as I am aware, they had never been
imported alive until last year, when a few were brought over,
and were exhibited at Shows by one or two of our leading
exhibitors of foreign birds.
Last June, I was most generously presented by Mr. Russell
Humphrys with two examples, together with a number of other
valuable birds. They had been in Mr. Humphrys' possession
for some months, and I still have them, both apparently in good
health.
There are two or three nearly allied species. Mine I
believe to be Artamus sordidus, and I think that all other
examples imported have been of the same species. My birds
are exactly alike, and I do not know their sex. They are about
the size of a Bullfinch, and are not beautiful, the general colour
of the plumage being sooty-grey or smoke-colour, with a white
tip to the tail. The under wing-coverts are white. The bill is
steel-blue, darker at the end. The feet and claws, which are
large and strong, are lead-colour. They are not very lively,
except when excited by the sight of a mealworm. They are very
tame, and will allow themselves to be handled : I judge from
this that they were hand-reared.
I have had no difficulty in keeping them on my usual
mixture for insectivorous birds, which consists mainly of ants'
eggs and fine crissel. They have about half a dozen mealworms
each, every day, and now and then some cooked meat chopped
fine.
Judging from the shape of the bill, and their voracity, I
should say that the}&amp;apos;&amp;apos; are much more nearly allied to the Shrikes
than to the true Swallows.
I keep mine in a large cage by themselves, so that I know

nothing as to their behaviour with other species. They seem
attached to one another.
They always sleep on the wires of the cage, high up in
a corner and touching each other. They scarcely ever alight on
the floor of the cage.
Although, as I have already said, they cannot be called
pretty, their soft colouring and quaint ways make them decidedly
attractive birds. But I do not think that they are particularly
well adapted for captivity, or that their importation should be
encouraged. Mine have kept well so far, but they want care and
judicious feeding, and at best I do not anticipate a long life for
them.
My Wood-Swallows have never uttered a note, beyond a
twittering call.
I understand that, when at liberty in their native land, the
Wood-Swallows, like our own Swallows, spend most of their
time on the wing. It is obvious that, unless kept in an
enormous aviary, the habits of an aerial species must be so
modified by captivity as to be little or no test of its true
characteristics, and this will apply with especial force to hand-
reared specimens such as I believe mine to be.

November 7TH, 1899.
By C. S. Simpson, M.D.
The small number of entries at this Show must have
caused great disappointment, and, it is to be feared, a considerable
money loss to the promoters. Nevertheless there were a fair
number of good birds, though few of extraordinary beauty or
interest. A bird which particularly attracted my attention, was
No. 446, exhibited by Mr. L. W. Hawkins. This was described
as a " Biclieno-Zebra cock." It resembled a Bicheno in character
and markings, with the transverse markings on the chest, and
the white bars on the tail, of a Zebra finch. If the bird be indeed
a hybrid, the absence of the chestnut cheeks and the reddish
spotted sides would seem to indicate the female sex. It would be
interesting to hear from the owner whether the bird was bred in
his possession, and his reasons (which are doubtless good ones)
for describing the bird as a male.
Another curiosity w r as No. 243, belonging to the same
owner, and described as a Red-faced finch. This bird is, I

presume, one of a pair exhibited at the Palace in February
(as Pytelia afro). It appears to be either a Red-faced finch
or an Aurora finch, with a tendency to albinism ; but if so it is
curious that there should have been a pair of them with similar
markings. When I first saw them I thought they might be
immature birds. That supposition was evidently a wrong one.
Can the owner of the birds throw any light on the subject.
Mr. Fulljames' bird, formerly called a Tong-tailed
Combasou, has been finally identified as a Resplendent Whydah,
and appeared in full health and beauty. The name is somewhat
misleading, inasmuch as the bird is by no means brilliantly
coloured.
The Violet-eared Waxbills, which have been a conspicuous
feature of recent Shows, were here only conspicuous by their
absence. They are delicate birds, and it is to be feared most
of those imported have already died.
The genus Poephila was well represented by the Tong-
tailed ( P. acuticauda), White-cheeked (P. leucotis) and Masked-
finches (P. personated), besides the better known Parson and
Gouldian finches. The latter always seem to find Shows very
trying to their constitution, and some specimens at least generally
look lanquid and puffy. I gave up keeping Gouldian-finclies
sonic years ago on account of their delicacy, in the hope that
some of our younger and more enterprising aviculturists might
discover the secret of keeping them in health, but, so far as
I am aware, the secret is yet undiscovered. There were two
pairs of Three-coloured parrot finches in good condition but
wild. They did not strike me as being very attractive birds.
Mr. Fulljames' Blue-headed Tanager is a lovely bird and
looks hardy enough, and his pair of Zosterops were charming.
The same gentleman's Andaman, Black-headed and Malabar
Mynahs, in the next class, were perfect examples of the right way
of exhibiting birds. Each bird was spotlessly clean, with every
feather in place, and shewn in sufficiently large, yet unobtrusive,
cages.
A pair of Nicobar Pigeons would doubtless have been
handsome and attractive in a clean, roomy aviary, but in a small,
and, therefore, dirty cages, they were far from prepossessing.
In the last class was the beautiful Green Touraco, which
has been pretty frequently seen at recent Shows. A very
remarkable bird was the Sacred Kingfisher, a bird whose un-
obtrusive brown plumage formed a curious contrast with a pair
of wonderful, deep-blue eyes. There were also a pair of the

quaint Australian Wood-swallows, a pair of Australian Bell-
birds, a Dyal, and an interesting little pair of Mannikins, which
seemed oddly out of place in the class : they were described as
Striated-finch Bengalese hybrids. My own belief has always
been that the Bengalese is an Albino variety of the Striated-
finch. _
By D. Skth-Smith, F.Z.S.
This Show was held by the British Bird and Mule Club in
the Balliam Assembly Rooms, on the 7th, 8th, and 9th of Nov.,
and so far as the quality of the exhibits went, could hardly have
been excelled.
In the following brief notes I don't intend to criticize the
judging; but rather to say a few words about the birds that
appeared to me to be of especial interest to aviculturists.
I have nothing to say about the commoner British birds,
but in Class 9 there were one or two specimens of some interest.
Here were two Ortolans and a Serin (I don't know why they
were allowed in a " British " Class, but that is not my business
now), and two good Crossbills, as well as, of course, many
commoner kinds. In another class two good Choughs were
worthy of notice.
The class for Pied, Albino, or other rare freaks, contained
some interesting exhibits, amongst which were an albino Black-
bird, a black Bullfinch, a white House-Sparrow, a white Linnet,
and Mr. Fulljames' Cinnamon Starling, which must be getting
used to Bird Shows by now. In the catalogue I notice that a
white Hedge Accentor is mentioned, but I evidently overlooked
it: if it was the same bird that was shewn at the recent Crystal
Palace Show, it was well worth seeing.
There were some interesting exhibits in the class for
resident insectivorous British birds; amongst which may be
mentioned two particularly nice Stonechats, a Marsh-tit, two
Long-tailed Tits--one of which belonged to the white-headed
race, which is not British, and a Crested Tit, whose British origin
I also much doubt. Two Greater-spotted Woodpeckers were
shewn. By the way, when are we to see the Lesser-spotted
Woodpecker on the Show-bench ? It should not be difficult to
keep.
There were some nice Whinchats in Class 21, a good
Spotted Fly-catcher, a Chiff-chaff, and a very large Wheatear;
but the most interesting bird was undoubtedly a Black Redstart--
I question, though, whether it should not have been in the class

for Continental birds. To my mind the nicest British bird in
the Show was the Wryneck, shewn by Mr. Fulljames, which was
about as perfect a specimen as one could wish to see, and seemed
perfectly reconciled to its life in captivity.
The class for Continental birds was well filled, and con-
tained some really charming specimens, the most interesting
perhaps, being a magnificent Hoopoe. This was closely followed
by a fine Black Woodpecker, in good condition ; certainly a very
rare cage bird. There were also in this class some very nice Rock-
thrushes, both of the Blue and common species, and a lovely
Blue-throat.
The Foreign section contained some remarkably good
birds, several of which, most of us had never before seen in
a living state.
Mr. Fulljames' pretty Resplendent Wliydah was in
capital show form, and looked very neat. There was a good pair
of Bathilda ruficauda, a species which I hope, ere long, may
again be imported. A single specimen of Pytelia afra was
shewn by Mr. Hawkins; and Mr. Fulljames sent a nice pair
of Firefinch.es (L ago no s tic ta), but I cannot say to which species
they belonged.
In the class for Gouldians, Parrot-finches, and Pintail
Nonpareils, there was a pair of Gouldians, in which the hen had
just as much red about her head as the cock ; this was, I think,
the finest pair of Red-headed Gouldians I have ever seen. There
were two good pairs of Tri-coloured Parrot-finches, and one
pair of the less rare, but to my mind, far handsomer Common
Parrot-finches.
The most interesting bird in the class for other Grass-
finches was a Bicheno-Zebra-finch hybrid, an extremely pretty
novelty, though I doubt whether, strictly speaking, it should
have been allowed to compete in this class. A good pair of
Masked Grassfinches were worth notice, as were some well shewn
Bichenos, and two or three pairs of Tong-tailed Grassfinches, one
pair of the latter being aviary-bred and still in their nest-
feathers.
There were some lovely Tanagers, including the Blue-
headed, a charming bird ; the Bluish, Black, and one or two
others. A very nice pair of the Australian Grey-backed
Zosterops was also shewn. Starlings were fairly well represented,
the small Gloss} r , Purple-lieaded, Andaman, Black-headed, and
Malabar being shewn, and all in excellent condition.

The Dove class was very poorly filled, a pair of Nicobars,
and a solitary " Peaceful " Dove being the only occupants.
Amongst the Parrakeets there were several exceedingly
good birds. Mr. Doherty shewed a good pair of Kings and a
fine Crimson-wing. The gem of the collection was, however,
Mr. Fulljames' hen Polytelis alexandrce, and she seemed to be in
excellent health ; but one has seen her before, and personally, I
was most interested in a lovely pair of Platycercus browni, which
were also shewn by Mr. Fulljames. I don't remember ever
to have seen Brown's Parrakeet before, and it is undoubtedly
extremely rare in this country, if in fact it has ever before been
seen here alive. According to Gould, Brown's Parrakeet is
found in abundance in the north of Australia, so that there
should not be any trouble about importing it. I was much
pleased with Mr. Maxwell's Golden-shouldered (Psephotus
chrysopterygius), she is a charming little thing, and it is a great
pity that this species is so very rare that a mate cannot be
obtained for her. A pair of Blue-bonnets were also worthy of
notice.
The only Dorikeets shewn were a Forsten's and a Scaly-
breasted. The most interesting of the true Parrots were a Hawk-
headed, a Bronze-winged, and a Meyer's ; the latter species being
to my mind the most delightful of all parrots.
Mr. Fulljames shewed a Hyacinthine Macaw, a rare, but
in my opinion, most undesirable species. I much preferred the
same gentleman's fine pair of Ganga Cockatoos.
A very interesting class was that reserved for all species of
foreign birds not included elsewhere. Mr. Fulljames shewed
a Regent-bird, a species that has probably never before been
seen upon the Show-bench. A pair of Wood-swallows, which I
am told were the same that appeared at the Palace last February,
looked remarkably well. One would expect these birds to be
difficult to keep, but Mr. Fulljames informs me that they are
comparatively easy subjects to deal with. At night they hang,
head downwards, from the roof of their cage, like the Hanging
Parrots and Bats. A good Satin Bower-bird, in the female or
immature male plumage, and a Warty-faced Honey-eater were
also exhibited by Mr. Fulljames. Mrs. Frostick shewed a good
pair of Australian Bell-birds and a Malaccan Dhyal-bird ; and
I may, perhaps, mention my own exhibit in this class, an
Australian Sacred Kingfisher ( d ).
(d) On account of an unfortunate printer's error, which appeared on the Show labels,
and which directed that exhibits were to be at the Show by 9 p.m. on Nov. 7th, (whereas
they should have arrived the previous evening-) the Sacred Kingfisher did not arrive at the
Show until after the judging was over and the Judges had left.--D. S-S.

I must say that the way in which the Show was managed
left nothing to be desired, and I can testify to the excellent way
in which the birds were looked after, and to the great care
bestowed upon the delicate specimens.

The additions this month do not call for very much
comment, and, as in the preceding paper, the most valuable are
to be found in the Parrot House.
Several more specimens of that very scarce bird,Westerman's
Eclectus, have arrived. This is the first occasion on which the
female of this species has been seen, for up to the present the
species has onty been known by a few males, scattered in various
Museums. The female is similar to that of E. pectoralis,
but the blue on the lower breast is of a dull purple, instead
of being similar to the collar, as in the last named species.
The male may always be distinguished by the absence of red on
the sides of the breast. Next to the Eclectus was a very fine
specimen of Forsten's Lorikeet, a lovely bird with blue head
and neck, rosy breast, and green back.
A specimen of the Greater Vasa Parrot from Madagascar,
is also worth more than a passing glance, belonging as it does to
a peculiar genus, with a long tail and short stumpy bill, its
colour being of a uniform dull grey.
But among all the rarities, perhaps the neatest and most
valuable, is the Uvoean Parrakeet, from the Island of Uvoea.
It is a very small bird, about as large again as a Budgerigar,
with the breast, forehead, cheeks, and rump of a delicate light
blue colour. The head is glossy black, and a narrow black line
runs down the nape. The back is uniform light gre3 r with
a canary yellow patch on each shoulder. A second specimen,
presumably young, was in the same cage, and was dull yellow
in front, and grey on the back.
The other new arrivals in the Parrot House are a nice
pair of Orange Flanked Parrakeets, which were very lively,
running up and down their cage exactly like mice. I do not
remember ever having seen a Parrot run head downwards before.
In the other aviaries there has been but little of interest
this month. Passing through the Western Aviary one notices a
magnificent Lanceolated Jay Thrush in splendid feather. There
are also two specimens of the Pied Grallina, from Australia ; a
black and white bird, which, to the untutored eye, has similar

habits to that of our English Wagtails ; it is, however, a con-
siderably larger bird, being about the size of a Thrush, and
would, I should think, be well worth keeping by those members
who have sheltered outdoor aviaries.
A splendid specimen of the Sun Bittern (Emypyga helias ),
was also on view, spreading its wings, with their gorgeous tints,
to such sun as finds its way through the mist of a clear (?)
Eondon November day.

BREEDING OF THE AFRICAN FIREFINCH.

Sir, --I think the few following notes on the successful nesting of the
African Firefinch, in an unheated garden-aviary (a mere shed, fully exposed
at its southern side, and with an open wire flight) will not be uninteresting
to many of our members.
I have had a pair of these birds for the past two years, aud last season
the) r spent most of their time out of doors, and, whilst there, built, laid
eggs, but did not incubate. They were brought into the house on October
15th, and were not put out again until April 3rd, of this year. They went
to nest again, but it was not until July 29th that a fully-fledged young one
left the nest : it was then exactly nineteen days old, and in plumage it
resembled the adult female, with a black beak aud dark legs, but showed
considerably more red on the rump and tail than she did, but less than its
father ; from this I concluded it must be a young cock--which it eventually
proved to be. To-day, as I write (Oct. 14th) it is almost in full colour, and
has the red beak.
The parents again nested, and brought off another young one on
Sept. 17th. This last one differed considerably from its elder brother, in
being much greyer in colour and having less red on the rump aud tail, than
its mother. It appears, therefore, that the sexes are easy to distinguish,
even when quite young.
It is worthy of notice, considering the hot-liouse treatment this
species is supposed to require, that the maximum temperature during the
day-time, when this last young one left the nest, was as low as 42 0 Fahr.,
aud fell during the night to 36T The cold weather we have had recently
seems not to affedt them in the least; they are out at the time of writing,
and the temperature, on more than one occasion, has been as low as 260.
This speaks well for the hardiness of the species, when once acclimatised.
The size of the aviary is 12 feet by 6 feet and rather more than 6 feet
high, and contains, besides about a score of other small birds, six Red-
rump Parrakeets. G. Ee C. Grace.

Sir, --I am afraid Mr. Farrar is very far indeed from proving his case.
The female Pennant, as several of our members have correctly stated,.

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.984004351351351" page_id="32637868"  page_num="35" year="" vol="">
differs from the male in its slightly inferior size, rounder head, and duller
crimson colouring. Neither sex of the Pennant has the central tail-feathers
wholly pure blue; if closely examined, it will be seen that the inner webs
are shot with bluish-green. The Adelaide Parrakeet in no respect resembles
a Mealy Rosella : it is chiefly of a brick- or orange-red colour, with similar
pattern and arrangement of colours to those of P. elegans . but the whole of
the tints are paler and the central tail-feathers are considerably greener.
How Salvadori came to describe the tail as resembling that of P. elegans I
do not pretend to explain, for none of the specimens with which he worked
can be correctly described as having a " tail as in P. elegans.&amp;apos;'
Mr. Farrar's argumeut that five Adelaides could not be picked up on easy
terms is plausible ; but rare birds are sometimes offered on easy terms, as I
know from experience : some five or six years ago, I picked a little bird out
of a lot offered by a London dealer at three shillings apiece, and a year
later the same man was offering a specimen at a sovereign, and declaring
that he had never before seen a living specimen ; my bird is still living, and
in perfect plumage. I have heard of many similar instances.
Undoubtedly it is the business of a dealer to recognize a rare bird
when he sees one, but man} 7 of them do not. In Germany the Adelaide
Parrakeet is not accounted rare, and Russ states that its price is the same as
that of the Pennant Parrakeet. A. G. Butler.
Sir, -- I have no intention of continuing the controversy with Mr,
Farrar, but I must, for the sake of those of your readers who have never
seen the Adelaide Parrakeet, take exception to his comparison of the
difference between a Pennant and an Adelaide with that between a Pennant
and a Mealy Rosella. The Adelaide looks like a washed-out Pennant, while
the Mealy Rosella and the Pennant differ in colouring almost as much as a
Grey Parrot and an Amazon. Horatio R. Fieemer.
BROWN-AND-WHITE BENGALESE, AND STRIATED FINCH.
Sir, --The nest of five young from a Brown-and-White Bengalese hen
mated to a Striated Finch (concerning which you said it would be interesting
to note what they were like, Milieu they left the nest) have done so for about
a week.
Three of them are exactly like the Striated Finch--not a single white
feather to be seen. The other two have a little white, over the beak, on the
breast, and a few white feathers in the wings--one bird rather more than
the other. R. M. Barber.

ENQUIRIES.
Sir, --May I ask of any&amp;apos; member of the Council or Society, who has
had experience, what is the best food for the so-called Blue Mountain Lory--
Swainson's Eorikeet ?
Dr. Greene says they will live a few weeks or months on seed, and
then die in fits of indigestion, and gives rice boiled in sweetened milk as
the rational diet, also sweet fruit.
Dr. Russ says the staple food should be canary seed, oats, and a little
hemp, with moistened stale wheaten bread in addition, and sweet fruit daily.
Speaking generally of Dories and Lorikeets, he says the supposed delicacy
of these birds arises from ignorant treatment, t.e., feeding on boiled RICE,
which may suit them in their own hot climate, but is too hurtful in ours.
Also that cows' milk is injurious to Lories.
Here we have two experts diametrically opposed in the most im-
portant matter of feeding.
My pair are in superb plumage, and, apparently thoroughly&amp;apos; healthy
and acclimatised, so I wish to take care of them. I am giving canary, oats,
and hemp, which they eat well. Also old bread dipped in very sweet milk,
or freshly 7 made cheese curd rolled in powdered sugar--both these they 7 lick
with their tongues and then eat it with relish. They are rather thirsty birds,
and love bathing.
Dr. Greene accuses them of being fierce and cruel as liaw 7 ks: his pair
having murdered two of his Parrakeets and injured another. May I ask if
this is the average experience ? Mine are in a cage, but it would be a con-
venience to me if I could trust them in a space n feet by 7 4 feet by 7 6 to 9 feet
high, in company w 7 ith a pair each of Cockatiels, Grey-headed Love-birds,
and Budgerigars.
Finally 7 , is their any 7 difference in the sexes ? Mine are exactly 7 alike
in size and plumage, except that one has distinct blue pencillings on the
edges of its scarlet breast-feathers, which scarcely show 011 the other. They 7
spend their time caressing and then snapping at each other. They yelp like
a newdy-cliained up fox terrier pup with a voice like an ungreased cart-
wheel. A. A. Pearson.
7 he following answer has been sent to Mr. Pearson --
Your letter re Swainson's Lorikeet has been sent to me to be answered.
I should recommend biscuit soaked in boiled milk as the staple diet,
with the addition of some fruit daily. Apples are generally preferred to all
other fruit, and one good-sized apple will be enough for a pair of Lorikeets.
I11 the summer they 7 may 7 have green food. A little canary 7 seed and oats
will do no harm, but I should not recommend hemp. If they have a
constant supply of properly made sop, they will probably almost entirely
give up eating seed. The sop must be made fresh every 7 day 7 , but it will
keep good for twenty-four hours, even in the hottest weather. It should be
unsweetened--this I believe to be important.
It would not be safe to place the Lorikeets with other birds, unless
they 7 were very carefully 7 watched at first, as they are often murderously
spiteful. I should not care to trust them with smaller birds.

Sir,-- My Senegal Parrot has never properly regained his plumage
since he moulted, a process which lasted an unusual time. All that part
which should be a brilliant orange colour, looks ragged and more white
than yellow. He seems in perfect health, and I should be glad if anyone
can tell me the cause of this, and if anything can be done for it.
C. D. Courier.
The following answer has been sent to Miss Collier --
It sounds as if the bird was plucking itself. I have found what I
thought bad moulting turn out to be that.
I daresay it has plenty of occupation. In case it is weakness, a few
drops of Wyeth's iron might be added to its water. I suppose it bathes; if
not, it should be sprayed. F. G. Button.
GOULDIAN FINCHES.
Sir,--I shall be glad of some information regarding these beautiful
birds, as three have latelj- come into my possession, and I am unable to
obtain any particulars from the books on foreign birds which I have by me.

Black-lieaded Finches. The two former have a kind of song, but one is
more brilliant than the other in colour. The Black-headed Finch does not
appear to have any song, and I am wondering whether it is a hen, and if so
whether it will mate with one of the Red-heads.
H. E. Goddard.
The following answer has been sent to Mr. Goddard --
At various times I have had over a score of these birds; and, if you look
either at my "Foreign Finches in captivity,'' or "Foreign Bird-Keeping,"
you will find full accounts, with illustrations, of both varieties of Gouldian
Finches.
The female can be told at a glance from the male, by the pale colour-
ing of the under-parts : the breast lilac instead of ultramarine shaded with
violet, the abdomen lemon-yellow fading to white instead of saffron-yellow ;
there are other less pronounced differences, but these will suffice.
Black-lieaded hens (invariably, I believe) prefer Red-lieaded cocks ;
one of my earliest hens deserted her Black-headed mate for a Red-head :
this certainly sometimes happens when they are at liberty in Queensland, as
both forms have been shot from the same nest.
No insect-food is required, nor have I ever seen a Gouldian Finch
touch soft-food; but millet in the ear, and grass-seed in the ear, are almost
necessary to the newly-imported examples.

Sir,--I have a Blue-bird which I bought last week, and was told that
it was a Honey-eater and would eat insect food (Arthur&amp;apos;s) and fruit, like the
Tanager; but I do not find that it answers to the description of the Honey-
eaters. It is smaller than my Superb Tanager, and is more sober in its
shades of bine. It has a patch of yellow at the root of its beak and also on
its back ; but is chesnut-browu underneath, and its beak is a little more
pointed than the Tanagers. I have given it banana, orange, pear, and
sponge cake mixed with honey, and Arthur&amp;apos;s mixture mixed with cold
potato--the same food that I give to the Tanager, and which seems to
suit it.
I shall be much obliged if any member can help me to define what
bird it is. I think it must be the Blue Robin, only it is a small bird.

THE MAGAZINE ; THE RATE DR. RUSS.
Sir, -- The accounts for last t 7 ear show that the Avicultural Society
has expended a little more than its income, and is at present indebted to its
Honorary Treasurer for is. 6d. balance on the wrong side.
I enclose my annual subscription, to which I have added 2 S. 6d., and
I venture to hope that of the 289 members a sufficient number will be glad
to make such a small addition to their subscription to extinguish the little
debt.
A foot-note to the Balance Sheet explains that the cost of the
coloured illustrations has considerably exceeded the original estimate.
Their cost has, indeed, absorbed one-half of the total receipts from
subscriptions, entrance fees, and advertisements. I venture to suggest
that it would perhaps be good policy to restrict the number of coloured
illustrations to two, at the utmost, per annum. One every three months
would, I think, be ample ; and a sound financial position is perhaps more
conducive to the best interest of the Society, than a coloured supplement
more or less.
I see with pleasure that the Members' List, published a few days ago,
contains the names of so many ladies ; that of three new members who
joined the Society last month, two are ladies, and that the three new candi-
dates are all ladies. As many ladies have more time for the observation of
cage-birds than the majority of men, I hope the lady-members will in future
frequentty record, in the pages of the Magazine, interesting new facts.
I have seen no mention in the Magazine of the death of Dr. Karl Russ,
which occurred some months ago. The deceased naturalist was probably
the most enthusiastic lover of foreign cage-birds of his time. He devoted
a long life to the care, observation, and description of birds and their habits.
All readers of his many works and writings on the subject, will remember
them with pleasure.^
A few readers of the Magazine may recollect having seen the
magnificent collection of foreign birds Dr. Russ sent over and exhibited at
the Crystal Palace, about twenty years ago. It contained a few hybrids of
extreme rarity. At that time Dr. Russ was already advanced in years. He
( e ) I think one reason for this was, that it was reported that a nephew of the famous
gentlemen (and not Dr. Russ himself) had died.--A. G. R.

was always pleased to show his bird-rooms in the suburbs of Berlin, where
I used to visit him many years ago, as often as I happened to be near Berlin.
He seems to have attained a great age. His writings, especially those relating
to foreign finches, may be a source of useful information and of pleasure to
those who know German. A. F. Wiener.
Note. --We have every hope that, at his leisure, Mr. Weiner will favour us with some
account of the life and work of Dr. Russ, our greatest guide aud pioneer in aviculture,
which would be of much interest to all members of the Society.-- Editor.
Sir,--I shall be so glad if any of our members can tell me whether
Moor-liens feed on young fish ? We have stocked our moat with gold-fish,
but although there was plenty of spawn last spring, no young fish have
been seen. We think it may be because a pair of Moor-liens have been
living there very 7 happily all the summer. The moat is surrounded by low
growing bushes, and so makes a delightful home for these birds; but if
they really do eat the young fish, we shall be obliged to cut the bushes back
and so force them to seek other quarters, but of course should not do so if
they are really harmless.
I do not think the attention of our members has been sufficiently
directed to the pleasure to be gained from supplying wild birds with inviting
nesting-places near the house, where they can be watched without disturb-
ing them.
Last spring, I hung one of the nest-boxes from my aviary in a pear-
tree growing against a wall close to the house ; it was a cosy little affair
covered with virgin cork, and, I hoped, might attract some of the Tits
which used to come to that corner for cocoa-nut. However, about a fort-
night after it was put up, a pair of Flycatchers took possession of it,
building on the top instead of inside. They were wonderfully 7 tame, feeding
their young ones unconcernedly, even while we sat at tea not more than
half-a-dozen \ 7 ards away. They successfully reared five young birds, aud
confirmed Gilbert White's opinion that these birds never nest a second time.
I am hoping they will return to the same place next year, as they were
never disturbed.
Pretty little boxes can be made from half a deep cigar box, coated
with glue, and sprinkled with cork-cuttings in which bulbs are packed. My
boxes have lids, which can, on occasion, be opened to give me a peep at the
young birds, but this I should ojily do in the case of Sparrows or, possibly,
Robins. I think Robins, Starlings, Sparrows, and the Tit tribe would be
likely to nest in boxes placed in suitable positions.
It is also very interesting, in winter, to hang up a cocoa-nut with one
end cut off, and to see the Oxeye-, Marsh-, and Cole-Tit returning to it
again and again. Each bird knows exactly who he can turn out of the
coker-nut, and to whom he must give place; aud they pop in and out like
boys "keeping the pot boiling." E. Brampton.
7 &amp;apos;he following answer was sent to Miss Brampton --
In reply to your query re Moor-liens eating young fish, I do not think
it at all likely that they would in anyway interfere with them. The food of

the Moor-lien consists of slugs, worms, grass, and, where procurable, grain,
and also any insects that may come their way.
I should think it more probable that the fish themselves ate the
spawn, especially if there was any scarcity of food; Newts, I believe, are
also destructive to young fish. J. L. Bonhote.

WILD AND TAME HOOPOES.

By the Rev. Hubert D. Asteey.
Hoopoes seem to be tamer in a wild state in Eastern
countries than in Western. In Africa, India, and China, they
are, in certain parts, familiar and fearless birds, but those that
migrate for the spring and summer months to Europe prefer
more secluded meadow lands, and woods ; yet, if this most
lovely bird were suffered to remain at peace as an English
migrant, there is little doubt that in time we should look for
Hoopoes in our gardens in the spring, as we do for Cuckoos and
Nightingales, and the rest. Not a year goes by without specimens
of these birds being shot, so that it is impossible for them to
make a start in establishing themselves as regular visitors. In
the Scilly Isles every April brings with it three or four Hoopoes,
but passing whither, no one knows ; for they arrive only to
spend a week or two, and are gone again, yet their passage in the
vernal migration is an annual event.
In the water meadows and rich low-lying pastures cf
some parts of England, Hoopoes would undoubtedly find an
abundance of insect food, and would also be extremely useful in
digging out with their long slender bills, certain grubs destruc-
tive to farming and gardening, which many birds with shorter
bills may be unable to reach beneath the surface of the earth.
Anyone who has voyaged up the Nile, has not left Cairo
far behind before the Hoopoes are evident to the most unnoticing
persons.
He is a bird of such striking appearance, with his wonder-
ful coronet uplifted on his head, the long slender and slightly
curved bill, and the beautiful broad butterfly-like wings, banded
conspicuously with black and white.
Walking through the Egyptian villages, it is an ordinary
thing to see one or two Hoopoes running quickly over the dried
Nile mud, either on the edge of some canal or pool, or else prod-

ding with their bills amongst the refuse that lingers lovingly but
unsweetly about the mud hovels of the Arabs. In Egypt there
is an abundance of beetles, which probably make up a consider-
able portion ot the Hoopoes' menu, but to judge by the appalling
effluvia that surrounds the nest and young birds, they cannot be
altogether nice feeders. Like some people, their sense of taste
must be either absent or else somewhat depraved. They remind
me in this respect of a luncheon party I was once at. It was
extremely hot summer weather, and in London. There was
dressed crab amongst other delectable dishes ! One lady guest
seemed to be enjoying it so much, that when it came to my turn,
I too helped myself. One mouthful was not only enough, but
too much. I looked round the table ; three other guests appeared
aghast, portions of the crab untouched upon their plates. " Isn't
the crab good ? " said the hostess. As no one else spoke, I
ventured to say, " Well, I think crabs are very difficult to keep
quite fresh in this kind of weather, and fishmongers are not
always to be depended upon.&amp;apos;' My hostess at once turned to the
lady whose appreciation of decaying crab had beguiled me into
tasting it, and said, " Pray don't eat it." But she was too late,
for like the Walrus and the Carpenter with the oysters, she'd
\0x25A0eaten every bit, and (perhaps with due consistence) stuck to it
that her helping was quite good ; yet it was all part of the same
old crab ! As with people, so with birds : there are some who
prefer freshly killed food, there are others who don't object to its
being decidedly tainted, and Hoopoes are perhaps to be numbered
among the latter.
I hold to this, because when a brood of young Hoopoes
was brought to me by an Arab boy at Assouan, that brood nearly
knocked me backwards. But in three days time, after they had
been fed on clean and fresh food, their disgusting smell had all
but faded away ; and all young Hoopoes that I have ever come
across have equalE affected the olfactory nerves.
When our dahabeah was moored opposite Assouan, below
the first Cataract of the Nile, to a sandbank in close proximity
to the Island of Klephantiua, I had ample opportunity for
observing the Hoopoes. In the early morning, before one was
properly awake, two of these birds used to settle on the dahabeah
just above one's cabin window, where they would utter continu-
ally their love song, hoo, hoo, hoo -- hoo, hoo, hoo; partly Dove and
partly Cuckoo-like in sound. To see the male birds sparring at
each other is extremely pretty, dancing in the air one over the
other, like two large butterflies.

After I had managed to pick rip a smattering of Arabic, I
used to endeavour to make known to various Egyptian boys the
fact that I was very anxious to obtain a brood of young Hoopoes,
having been able to utter, with what I thought extreme glibeuess,
the words " Katakit hidadid," which, being interpreted, means a
brood of Hoopoes ; but whether these youths mistook my mean-
ing, or else considered that a brood of any birds would suit me
equally well, I know not. At any rate, for a week, I was brought
nothing but j^ouug Sparrows, varying in age from three days to
ten. It was not in vain, however, that I used to shake my head
and say, " La ! la ! Hidhid, mafish baksheesh," by which I meant
"No, no, not that, but Hoopoes, you shall have no present."
Consequently, the very next morning (it was early in March) as I
was sitting on the upper deck of the dahabeah under the awning,
there came to my ears the sound of much splashing and yelling.
From the neighbouring island, through the shallow water that
divided it from our sand bank, three of my copper-skinned Arab
boys were racing, one of them holding his white robe above his
knees out of the water's reach in one hand, whilst in the other
were three struggling ungainly-looking bird forms, which, even
at some little distance, I saw were at any rate not Sparrows.
" Shoof, shoof, Hidadid "--" Look ! look ! Hoopoes,"--
cried all the boys simultaneously, and I thought the poor little
birds would have been then and there torn to pieces, for each
boy tried his best to be the one to hand them over to me, with
the usual Arab-like clamour, impetuosity and excitement.
Yes, sure enough, they w ? ere unmistakeably Hoopoes, easily
recognizable even at perhaps a week old. Their crests were
already well developed, and the quills that covered their
odoriferous bodies showed the black and white bars of the wings
and the russet brown of the general plumage.
After having duly rewarded the young Arabs, I placed my
Hoopoes in a covered basket lined with hay, where at first they
huddled into the farthest corner, nearly turning head over heels
in their endeavours to escape from my sight, their hind quarters
up in the air, and their heads, with the double row of crest-quills
widely separated, nearty doubled beneaih them.
And their smell ! well, smell isn't the word ! At that age
Hoopoes' bills are of course not nearly so long as in the adult
bird, and the gape of mouth, with the large yellow edging is
enormous. The only sound at first emitted was a frightened hiss,
but after a few hours, first one and then another began to feed,
when the}&amp;apos;- uttered a jarring note, which lasted as long as they

stretched up their necks and opened their mouths with the lovely
interior colour of orange-red. They were fed on small pieces of
fresh raw meat, mixed with an insectivorous food brought for
the purpose in tins, from England.
Hoopoes nest very early in Egypt, as early as Black-
birds do in England. The first nest I came across was at the
end of February, when we were voyaging between the first
and second Cataract of the Nile ; at Kalabsheh, famous for the
remains of what must have been one of the most magnificent
Temples of Egypt, but now in ruins from the ravages of some
great earthquake aided by Time.
Banding at Kalabsheh, and surrounded by the natives of
the place, I at once pursued my search for young Hoopoes, for I
had not yet received the brood just described. It was fast
growing dark, and we should be leaving at early dawn on the
following morning, so that it was a case of ' now or never.' On
hearing my enquiries in broken Arabic, a good looking young
man stepped out of the crowd, and said, "Aiwa, henna"--"Yes,
here,"--pointing with a graceful wave of a brown arm and hand
towards some rocks at the back of the village. As usually
happened, the whole assembly of some thirty or forty men and
boys immediately commenced to gesticulate and shout at me and
each other, until I was forced to put my fingers in my ears, and
run.
This seemed to improve matters, for the original announcer
of the whereabouts of a Hoopoe's nest, came after me, and
plucking my sleeve, said, " Taala maaya, henna ! henna !
" Come with me, here ! here ! " -- as he walked ahead through a
grove of date palms, which towered up above us, and through
whose graceful branches the stars were beginning to gleam with
the brilliancy peculiar to an Eastern sky. Then it suddenly
struck him that it was already too dark to find the nest without
artificial light, so making me, by expressive gestures, understand
that I was to wait whilst he fetched something, he ran off to the
dababeah, returning in a few minutes with a candle and some
matches. Then he led me,--followed in the near distance by
several boys, to whom I vainly shouted " Emshi ruhli "--"Go
away,&amp;quot;--towards the rocks that skirted the mud houses of the
village.
Clambering up to a narrow fissure, formed by one huge
boulder on another, he lighted the candle and peered in, his
black eyes glittering near the flame ; whilst I followed, a boy on
either side supporting either arm, under the impression that I
could not possibly 7 manage the rocky ground without such aid.

<bodyText confidence="0.999308930232558" page_id="32637878"  page_num="45" year="" vol="">
It was evident that ray original guide knew what he was about,
for he at once turned to me and pointed into the fissure. With
much difficulty, and after nearly frizzling off the tip of ray nose,
I at last discerned, about four feet in, a Hoopoe. The fissure
was so narrow that even she could not stand upright. There was
such a flooring of sand and small stones within that it was
impossible, b}^ the light of one candle, which cast shadows of
every shape and form, to see whether there were au} r eggs or
young ones ; but when I attempted to state my disbelief in their
existence, I was met by a hurricane of denials--" Young ones,
young ones." At first I thought that with the usual ignorance
of the Egyptian (or Nubian) countryman about birds, he was
under the impression that the undoubted adult bird was a young
one, and consequently vehemently denied his assertion.
But no ! again he said " Young ones, young ones," whilst
the other boys caught up the refrain in chorus. And he was
right: for, cutting a long and slender palm branch, which he
inserted into the innermost depths of the fissure just in front
of the poor frightened Hoopoe, he gradually and with much
difficulty scooped towards the opening, a poor wretched little
bird of a few hours old, which was rolled over and over on the
rocky flooring until it was within reach of his arm. It seemed
futile to attempt to rear it by hand, and equally so to push it
back into the depths of the rocky nest ; so I took it, and kept it
alive for twenty-four hours, during which time it fed well, and
really collapsed I believe from suffocation, having wriggled its
poor small pink body into a deep fold of the flannel in which it
had been wrapped, so that its wobbly head was bent under its
breast. It would have been a triumph to have reared it. At that
early age the fluff on the head was largely developed into the
form of a crest, but the bill was quite short as with any other
young bird.
I succeeded in bringing to Cairo seven well-grown Hoopoes
and, much as I loved them, could I ever go through such a
business again ? I think never ! They had to be fed constantly,
and each bird had to be taken out of the cage in turn so that the
food could be placed in its mouth, for otherwise it was thrown
about inside the cage, and the birds would have ended in being
half starved.
As I was staying ten days in Cairo, before leaving for
England, I used to allow two of the Hoopoes which were
particularly tame, to fly about upon the spacious balcony which
opened from my sitting-room ; and very pretty it was to see them

sunning themselves on the balustrade, lying down and spreading
out their wings, crests, and tails to catch the full heat, until they
looked, with their black and white bands and bars, like some
puzzle or kaleidoscope.
The cage in which they lived was an Egyptian one, made
of cane, with a sliding door. With constant opening and shutting,
this door slid back extremely easily, so that perhaps my horror
may be imagined when, on returning from the Bazaars one
morning, I found the door pushed back, and all seven Hoopoes
flitting about in the trees which grew opposite the hotel. Kites
and wicked Grey Crows (the wretches !) were gathering round,
eyeing my poor innocent Hoopoes, some of which, highly
delighted at finding themselves at liberty, were preening their
feathers and erecting their crests, and looking generally perky.
That I should ever recover them all again, I doubted ;
especially as at that moment the finest of the lot took flight
upwards, apparently out of sheer gaiety of spirits, only to be
immediately attacked from above by a Kite, which swooped down
upon it in a most abominably business-like manner--but the
Hoopoe gave a twist and a turn and dodged that evil-minded
Kite, when to my consternation, and still more I should imagine
to the Hoopoe's, a Grey Crow dashed up from below. This was
a mean manoeuvre, for he thought, " that bird shall be made
mince-meat between me and the Kite, we'll sandwich him
between us." That Hoopoe deserved to live, for with another
twist he fled into an acacia tree close by, and put up his crest at
his enemies, in much the same manner as a Eondon street arab
would put up his hand to his nose on escaping from the claws of
two Policemen. It was warm work for a minute or two.
As to those Grey Crows, they are real villains, for the next
day two of them did their utmost to work their revenge, actually
daring to hop with a great sidelong awkward hop on to the
balcony, where, whilst one worried those poor Hoopoes on one
side of the cage, the other seized a wing and a tail that for a
moment had showed itself between the bars, and with a savage
tug tweaked out a large beak-full from both. This attack I
witnessed from my bed-room window, and those Crows, although
they saw me, knew perfectly well that they would have time to
carry out their wicked designs, before I could dash on to the
balcony. It was fortunate for them that I couldn't get at them !
By the time that the Hoopoes were thoroughly hungry,
one after the other flitted across the street and returned to safe
quarters.

With much perseverance they were brought safely to
England, where, as soon as the warmer weather came, they were
placed in a small outdoor aviary. After a week or so I ventured
to open the door and let them fly loose in the garden, and it was
the prettiest and most uncommon sight to see seven Hoopoes
flitting along the terrace towards me when they spied the tin of
mealworms in my hand. Gradually they found their way all
round the garden immediately surrounding the house, but,,
curiously enough, never seemed to trust themselves out of its
sight.
Very quickly their natural instinct taught them to prod
with their long bills in the turf of the lawn, and it was very
interesting to notice their movements when a grub was felt an
inch or two under the surface, shewing that the tip of the bill
must be extremely sensitive for this purpose. When once a
Hoopoe commenced to dig with quick movements, a large brown
grub was almost sure to be pulled out, when it was knocked
about for a few seconds and then swallowed, the bird throwing
his head back, opening his bill, and chucking the insect down
his throat.
People's astonishment was great when I walked them
round the garden. If the Hoopoes were out of sight I used to
whistle, and almost immediately the}&amp;quot; would come flitting to
within a few yards of me, erecting their crests as they settled,
aud then running quickly along with their short little legs, their
heads nodding as they ran. They were most charming pets (I
say ' were,' for alas, they are all dead !) for they seemed to have
no fear, and with the full liberty of wild birds, were absolutely
tame.
The housekeeper used to feed them from the window of
her room, and they would go in and out there at all times of the
day, sometimes if the lattice was closed, tapping at the panes
with their bills. Why they died is a mystery to me, for they all
collapsed before September was out, and had in the meanwhile
had every privilege : magnificent weather, full exercise, natural
food as well as ants' eggs, mealworms and raw meat when they
needed it; and yet as each one moulted their skin seemed to be
attacked by a sort of scurvy, and the new feathers dropped out
w 7 hen about half grown and when still to a great extent in the
quill stage.
One or two of them had fits into the bargain, and all
seven died. It was most sad, but in spite of their loss, the gain
has been great. Whilst they lived they w T ere most beautiful and

interesting. But if I ever had the pleasure of another trip up
the Nile, I don't think I would ever try to bring home any more,
and I don't know that I advise others to do so.
Yet there is a beautiful Hoopoe (unless quite lately dead)
in the Western Aviary of the Zoological Gardens in Regent's
Park, which has moulted successfully, and which, when I saw it
in October, looked extremely healthy.

A complaint has been made that the Avicultural Magazine
is not sufficiently instructive to beginners, but assumes a greater
practical knowledge on the part of its readers than they actually
possess. In order to do something to meet this objection I here
present our less advanced readers with some notes which, what-
ever their faults, have at least the merit of being elementary.
Without any disparagement of the ornithological side of
aviculture, it may be justly claimed that the branch of our
science which is most peculiarly our own is the proper treatment
of birds in captivity. A knowledge of specific and sexual
distinctions, classification, and nomenclature, while of great
value to the aviculturist, is a thing which he shares with the
cabinet ornithologist and the collector, and is scarcely of the
essence of aviculture. But a knowledge of how to keep birds,
in cage or aviary, in health and happiness, belongs to the
aviculturist alone and is his especial pride. Now, perhaps the
most important branch of the great subject of " treatment" is--
food : so that no apology is needed for the presentation of these
notes upon it.
Of all the vices to which the writer on aviculture can fall
a victim, that of consistency is the most dangerous. Therefore,
if I herein set down anything which is, or appears to be, contra-
dictory of what I may have said before, I shall not try to explain
(or explain away) the inconsistency. There are some writers
who are like the man who, having by a slip of the tongue, stated
his horse to be fourteen feet high, remarked, on the mistake being
pointed out, " Did I say ' feet ' ? very well, then I will stick to it."
I am not going to be like that. I try to live and learn, and I find
that I often have to acknowledge myself to have been in the
wrong in the past. Aviculture is yet in its infancy, and I
believe that we shall very likely soon stumble upon some great
discoveries, which will revolutionise all our ideas about bird

food. The food which I here recommend is, therefore, simply
what I, in this year 1899, have found and believe to be the most
suitable--it may not be quite the same as what I should have
advised a few years ago, and perhaps next year I shall advocate
something different. I am afraid this sounds rather egotistical
and conceited--but I can't help that.
For the purposes of my subject, it is necessary to classify
birds in a frankly unscientific fashion, and I propose to deal with
them in the following groups. (Only birds which are properly
cage-birds will be treated of.) (1) Small seed-eating birds.
(2) Doves. (3) Seed-eating Parrots and Parrakeets. (4) Fruit-
er pollen-eating Parrots. (5) Fruit- or pollen-eating birds other
than Parrots. (6) Insectivorous birds. Of course some of these
groups overlap each other.

I.--SMALL SEED-EATING BIRDS.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999573629629629" page_id="32637882"  page_num="49" year="" vol="">
This group comprises finches, grosbeaks, buntings, wax-
bills, grassfinch.es, mannikins, and weavers -- in fact, all the
" finches " in the widest sense of the term. The feeding of all
these is simple, and it is not possible to go very far wrong.
Canary seed is the most generally useful of all seeds, and
all seed-eating birds may be supplied with it ad lib. It is,
unfortunately, often of very inferior quality. The grain should
be full and bright, free from shucked seeds, dust, and the excreta
of mice. The beginner should buy from a respectable bird-
dealer, rather than from a corn merchant--for the dealer knows
good seed when he sees it, and will, for the sake of his own birds,
have no other. On the other hand, highly respectable corn
merchants will sometimes supply very inferior bird-seed, not
with any intention of cheating, but because they cannot under-
stand that the quality of mere bird-seed " can be of importance.
White millet is another very useful seed, but I do not
consider it equal in value to canary seed. It is considered the
proper food for " foreign finches," though some of them seem to
do better without it. I should not give it to Alario Finches, nor
to any of the Siskins, and I should, as far as possible, encourage
all birds to eat canary seed in preference. I have known cases
in wdiich it clearly disagreed with birds, which kept in perfect
health on canary seed. I should not give it to any birds which
were not accustomed to it and were thriving without it. I should,
generally speaking, supply it to all Waxbills, Grassfinches, and
Mannikins, but I should take care that they always had plenty
of canary seed also. White millet is almost always of uniform

g&amp;apos;ood quality, but the whiter it is the more readily it is eaten by
the birds.
Brown millet is absolutely useless--I never knew any birds
that would eat it.
French millet is sold in two forms (i) Spray millet and
(2) so-called " Indian " millet. These are the produce of two
very closely allied, but distinct, plants. Their food value I believe
to be exactly equal--and the only difference which I can detect
in the grain is that that of the "spray" form is slightly larger
and more rounded. I think the "spray" is really the best, as
the birds enjoy pulling it to pieces : nevertheless, I always use
" Indian " myself, because it gives less trouble. French millet is
an excellent seed, and may be freely supplied to all birds. It is
most useful for newly imported Waxbills and Grassfinches, and
for many species when they have young in the nest--the avi-
culturist should never be without it. Unfortunately, it is a rather
expensive seed.
In each of my aviaries which contain seed-eating birds, I
keep a constant supply of canary-seed, white millet, and Indian
millet, each in a separate pan.
German rape is a good seed for such as will eat it, and it
is well to supply a pan of it in the aviary if any birds will take
it. It is very valuable for many British finches, but none of the
Ploceine finches will touch it. Care should be taken that it is
fresh, and free from mustiness.
Hemp seed is valuable, but requires to be used with great
discretion. If crushed, almost all birds will eat it, and I think a
little occasionally is good for most of them. Many delicate
species (such as Gouldian finches) when newly imported, will be
found to greatly benefit b}&amp;quot; a little crushed hemp.
Maw seed is useful for occasional use as a pick-me-up, and
for checking diarrhoea--&amp;apos;but it is extremely fattening.
Inga seed I have never used to any extent, and, although
I doubt whether it is so dangerous as it is sometimes said to be,
I should not care to add it to the regular dietary of any bird in
my care.
Linseed also is a seed which I do not think much of--
though a little will do no harm for a change.
As a rule, I think finches are better without mealworms,
but buntings and cardinals require a few.
Some kind of soft food, containing egg, I believe to be
beneficial to most finches--and I find them less liable to baldness

when they have access to it than when restricted to a seed diet.
Preserved yolk of egg, mixed with powdered biscuit, makes a
good soft food for finches.
A plentiful and regular supply of green food, especially in
the summer, is of the greatest importance.
II.--DOVES.
The smaller species appear to do well on canary-seed and
the two kinds of millet, with a few hemp seeds occasionally.
Dari is recommended. And the larger species would be fed much
like fancy pigeons.

The larger Parrots do well on a mixture of canary, hemp,
oats, and crushed maize--but they should have some fruit almost
daily. Boiled maize is an excellent thing, and might be given
once or twice a week--but it is a bother to prepare it, and care
must be taken that it does not turn sour. A piece of biscuit is
good for a change, and so is a very little milk sop.
The smaller Parrots and Parrakeets will live mainly on
canary seed, with some French millet and occasionally a little
hemp or a few oats. They also should have fruit, and plenty of
green food.

Practically, these consist of the Lories and Lorikeets, and
the Hanging Parrots. I have no personal experience of the
Hanging Parrots, but should imagine that they require the same
treatment as Lories
The true Lories (Eos and Lomus&amp;apos;) certainly differ in their
feeding from the Lorikeets (Trichoglossus&amp;apos;). Lorikeets will eat
seed much more readily than Lories, and do not require such
very soft food. The principal food for all of these, should be
milk sop, made by pouring boiled milk upon powdered biscuit.
I use Spratt's fine " white biscuit meal," as it saves trouble. For
Lories, the sop should be quite sloppjq and those of the genus
Eos seem to like it especially liquid. For Lorikeets it may be
firmer. It is scarcely needful to say that milk sop must be made
fresh every day, and the pan containing stale sop should be
removed from the aviary--but I have never found it necessary to
make it more than once a day, even in the hottest weather. No
sugar should be added to the sop. Besides sop, these birds
should have fruit daily, and I usually give raw apples--but
bananas and oranges are liked equally well. Many of the Lories

will at first refuse anything so hard as raw apple, and for these
there is nothing better than stewed apple well sweetened, or
banana mashed up in orange juice. In the summer, green food
may be given. Dates and dried figs form a useful addition to
the dietary. The dates may be given as bought, but the figs
should be stewed and afterwards mashed. Canary seed may be
supplied, and will be occasionally eaten by some of the Lorikeets.
All these birds resent a sudden change of food, and any one

acquiring one of them should ascertain how it has been fed, and
supply it at first with its accustomed food however unsuitable it
may be, until he can persuade it to take to the diet here
recommended. Lorikeets will often eat nothing but canary seed,
when they have been fed upon it for a long time. (I believe that
" Blue Mountain Lories" are almost always so fed on the voyage
from Australia). On the other hand, some Lories will refuse all
solid food, and have to be fed at first on sop made so liquid as to
be little more than boiled milk, and orange juice.
V.--FRUIT- AND PO ELEN-EATING BIRDS OTHER THAN
PARROTS.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998332478260869" page_id="32637885"  page_num="52" year="" vol="">
This group includes (besides others) the Tanagers, Bulbuls,
Honey-eaters, Sugar-birds, and some of the British Warblers
(such as the Blackcap). All these birds require some good
insectivorous food as a staple diet, and a regular and liberal
supply of fruit. I propose considering the question of insec-
tivorus food under the next heading. The fruit used may be
either apple, pear, banana, or orange. Some birds will like one
kind best and some another--but apples are not suitable for the
weak-billed species, unless they are very soft. Milk sop is a
useful addition to the food of these birds, but it should be given
with caution and discretion. All of them will eat it greedily,
and there is a danger, if they be freely supplied with it, that they
will eat it to the neglect of other food. It is undoubtedly^ some-
what relaxing, and on the whole I should advise its being given
not oftener than every other day, and then not more of it than
will be eaten up within five or six hours. The sop should be
made with boiled milk, be fairly stiff, and no sugar should be
added. I attach a good deal of importance to the sop being
unsweete?ied, because the addition of sugar adds considerably to
its relaxing qualities. I am not a believer in mealworms for
birds of this sort, though a few do no harm to the larger species.
Little things like Zosterops are, I fancy, better without meal-
worms, except perhaps when moulting.

VI--INSECTIVOROUS BIRDS.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999258476190476" page_id="32637886"  page_num="53" year="" vol="">
There is no point of aviculture upon which so much
difference of opinion and of practice exists as upon the question
of what is the best insectivorous food. All are agreed that ants'
eggs should form one of the chief ingredients, but that is the
only point upon which agreement exists. Without disparaging
other mixtures, I will give the formula for a food which I have
used for some time with great success. It is as follows :--Equal
parts, by bulk, of best ants' eggs, dried flies, Spratts' fine Crissel,
and Spratt's fine Game Meal, rubbed up with lard, with some of
Abrahams' Yolk of Egg added. For the more delicate birds it is
better to double the proportion of ants' eggs and reduce the
proportion of meal. I keep the food ready mixed in a tin,
and about twice a week rub up a basinful with lard, afterwards
adding the egg. It will keep good for a week or two after the
lard has been added, and the birds can be made to eat up the
last particle of it, so that there is no waste. I have no claim to
be the inventor of this recipe, which was given to me by a well
known member of the Council of our Society.
One of the chief merits of this food is that it does not
fatten--the birds keep in good condition upon it, but seldom lay
on an unnatural amount of fat. Some aviculturists fancy that if
their birds are fat they must be doing well--there cannot be a
greater mistake. Dripping may be used instead of lard, but I
find lard more convenient. Some people use grated carrot, or
mashed potatoes, instead of lard or dripping, but I do not
recommend either, for they will render the mixture liable to turn
sour, and make it necessary to mix it fresh every day and waste
what is left from the previous day. The same applies to the
use of fresh egg. There should be enough lard to make the
mixture thoroughly greasy, for if too dry some birds will refuse
it--on the other hand the lard must be well rubbed in, so that
there are no lumps, and there must not be so much grease as to
cause the food to cake. Some birds will not take very kindly to
the food at first, but all soon get to like it.
They require, of course, live insedt food as well, and this
generally has to consist of mealworms because nothing else is
purchasable. However, if blackbeetles or earwigs can be got,
they should be preferred to mealworms. It is difficult to decide
how many mealworms a bird should have, and I cannot venture
to lay down a rule. It is certain that too many are almost as bad
as too few. They should be given more freely during moulting
than at other times. I think it will be found that if the insec-

tivorous mixture mentioned above be used, fewer mealworms are
required than when the birds are fed on some of the old-fashioned
foods.
Curd cheese, made fresh daily, has been recommended as
a food for insectivorous birds, and although I have never used it
long enough to speak decidedly about it from actual experience,
I believe it to be an excellent food when mixed with ants' eggs,
etc. But it is a good deal of trouble to make, somewhat
expensive, and will not keep, so that I scarcely think it will
come into general use.
I believe that a very little milk sop, about once a week, is
good for nearly all insectivorous birds which will eat it.
I have never known a little cooked meat, finely minced, to
do any harm to birds, and I think it may often be given with
advantage to many species.
THE RUFF.
(Machetes pugnax).
By Charles T. Rothera.
There is little doubt but that the most generally interesting
birds in our small collection are to be found in the pool aviary.
Of the Kingfishers I have already written (Vol. 3, p. 137) and
the two prime difficulties connected with them are (1) difficulty
of procuring a steady supply of live fish, for the birds will eat
nothing else ; and (2) the refusal of two to live together in amity,
in which respect they are as bad as Robins.
But this year the great attraction of the pool has been the
Ruff. For the greater part of the summer, we had no Reeve for
him and were only able to procure one as lie was losing his
nuptial plumage, and very unfortunately she died during the
moult and her place is still vacant. They are not very easy
birds to meet with. For those who do not know the birds I may
mention that they are about the size of a Partridge on longer
legs and have a longer beak, the hen bird or reeve being altogether
more slender and feminine in build and size. One great pecu-
liarity of the birds is that no two of them are alike in colour or
marking, so that it is next to impossible to attempt to describe
them. Some are uniformly mottled with warm brown markings
on a lighter ground, others are much more irregularly blotched,
while still others have scarcely any markings at all, but are of
a dark black-brown all over. The distinctive feature which
gives the name to the bird is the adornment which he puts on

as the breeding season approaches, and wears till early autumn,
when he loses it in the general moult. It consists primarily of a
growth of feathers from the sides of the face and neck, which
hang down over the neck and breast like a circular-bottomed
pendant, over which the bird has considerable muscular power
and can raise or depress, contract or expand, at will. In addition
to this, two fringes grow on the brow like large eyebrows, and
stand up at an angle after the style of a Mephistopheles : these,
too, can be raised or depressed at will. The colour of these
adornments varies as much as does the body colour of the bird :
a dark brown-bodied bird may have a white frill or ruff, while a
mottled bird may have a cream-coloured one, and so on. In the
first bird we had a year or two ago, the ej^ebrows were bright
gold like braid or thread ; this year's bird had them of a some-
what darker colour than the general tone of the head, and they
were not conspicuous except when raised.
But the possession of these adornments does not satisfy
our gallant : he has to show them off, and his antics in doing
this are most amusing, and drew crowds of featherless spectators
to the pool side. Not having a mate of his own, he made up to
two Knots and a Godwit, and incessantly displayed his attractions
to them. This he did by running in front of them, or flying
over and alighting just before them, and then lying flat on his
breast, putting the end of his beak vertically down to the ground,
raising his ruff all round his head, and elevating his e3^ebrows in
a somewhat fierce-looking manner. When first seen in this
position, perfedtty motionless and his head completely smothered
up, he might easily be taken for a dead bird, and he retains the
position for a considerable time--it seems a minute or more to
aiwone watching him--when he raises himself and runs or flies
again to a position in front of his friends, and squats as before,
always putting the point of his beak down to the ground and
assuming a most peculiar attitude. I have been quite unable to
conceive the object of all this manoeuvring, ( a ) for none of the
other birds, not even the reeve when she joined him, seemed to
be the least impressed by it, and yet from the pertinacity with,
which he persisted in it, he evidently expected some important
result. He never does it now he has shed his ruff.
The birds are fond of paddling about in the shallow water
among the rushes round the marge, and live well on minced raw
(a). Undoubtedly to show off his display to the female. The females of all hirds
where the male makes a marked display are apparently unconscious of the trouble the
male is taking to impress them. Note a Peahen when the cock is displaying; also the
female Great Bustard.--33. G. B. JVI.-W.

beef mixed with soaked bread and mashed potato, with live
earthworms now and then, and mussels.
It is said that in their natural haunts the birds congregate
in flocks, and the Ruffs spend a great deal of time in the breeding
season in fighting--hence their specific name, pugnax ; but with
only keeping one pair, I cannot vouch for the truth of this.

By E. E. Smith.
The first bird I ever had was a hen Bullfinch, which I had
for nearly nine years, in perfect condition and very tame ; after
being caged all this time she started laying, and, in less than a
week, she laid five eggs on a rough heap of chickweed and
flowering grass which I had given as green food.
Thinking that even at that advanced age she might breed,
I procured a cock Goldfinch from a friend, but although the
Finch did his best to charm her with his song, and to feed her,
she would accept none of his attentions.
During twenty-three days she laid twenty-one eg&amp;apos;gs, all
perfectly shelled and proper Bullfinch colour, but very small.
The Goldfinch, finding his attentions were unwelcome,
commenced driving her about and eventually killed her, after
plucking all the feathers from her head and neck. Altogether I
kept this bird about ten years, which I consider a good age for a
Bullfinch caged.
The Goldfinch got stuck in the moult this autumn, and
died after living in perfect health for five years.
The only other British birds I have had were a Robin,
which makes a nice pet, and a cock Siskin, which I have at
present, in good condition and as tame as it is possible for a bird
to be ; he has cage-moulted three years.
My first interest in foreign birds arose Irorn a visit to
Belle Vue Gardens, Manchester, where I was greatly pleased
with a mixed collection of Cockatiels, Budgerigars, Java
Sparrows, and most of the commoner sorts of birds, together
with several pairs of Baltimore Orioles, which had nests of
wonderful construction, and to judge from the noise inside the
nests, most of them had young ; though possibly the liens were
inside and making all the noise.
Seeing an advertisement in the Exchange and Mart ,
" Small Foreign birds,. 12/- per dozen," I bought a dozen, and

received tlie following birds in the finest possible condition--
pairs of Cordons Bleus, Orange Cheeks, Grey Waxbills, Bronze
Mannikins, Combassous and two Orange Bishops (both turned
out to be males), these I kept in a large cage built in a recess in
my shop. The cage is 6ft. high, 4ft. wide, and 2ft. deep.
I soon lost the Combassous, probably because it was too
cold for them when they started moulting; but the others
.alwaj^s seemed happy and contented.
I was so pleased with my success, that I kept adding to my
stock, until I had about sixty birds altogether. I then turned
all the lumber out of an attic, and made an aviary of it in the
following simple manner.
The window, fortunately, was a very large one facing south,
so I fastened wire netting Q-in. mesh) over it on the inside, so
that I could open it for ventilation ; it was a fortunate thing for
me that I did so, for one of the sheets of glass was blown out
during a gale, and but for the wire I should have lost all my
birds. I then covered the floor with oilcloth so that I could
wash the dirt up easily, and then screwing some large branches to
the floor, the place was complete. In this room for several years
I kept the following birds--King, Pennant's, and Bauer's
Parrakeets, all males ; a pair of Brown-throated Conures, a pair
of Quakers, a hen Blossom-head, four pairs of Budgerigars, two
pairs of Blue-wings (Passerine Parrakeets) one pair Madagascar
and one pair Red-faced Rove-birds. I also had Java Sparrows,
Zebra Finches, all the common Waxbills ; Nuns; Orange, Oryx,
Napoleon, and Black-faced Weavers. The only casuality I had
from fighting was after one of the Blue-wing hens had died,
when the males fought for the other, and one sent his beak clean
through the skull of the other, killing him instantly. Most of
these birds bathed all the 3^ear round, some several times a day,
and although I never had artificial heat, I rarely had a death.
Many of these birds were tame enough to eat from my
hand, and the Weavers built beautiful nests, and would go on
building even while I was watching them, they were much
tamer than they were in a cage.
Besides these, I have had Nonpareils (I could never keep
these long, although I provided plenty of ants' cocoons and
mealworms. Do they require heat ?) Cockatiels, Diamond
Sparrows (veiy pretty birds) Parson Finches, Gouldian Finches,
Barraband's Parakeets, Blue Mountain Rories, White-eared
Conures, Rosellas and a Patagonian Conure (I only had a week

of Pat. he nearly screamed the house down) ($). I had a nice
Blue-fronted Amazon, a fair talker and very tame, he would
come to my hand anywhere indoors or out.
I have, at the present time, a fine Masked Parrakeet, very
tame, a Blossom-head, pair Peach-faced Love-birds, beauties
(now in my large cage I mentioned before) pair Parrot Finches,
pair Black-headed Gouklians, pair Long-tailed Grassfinch.es,
cock Lavender Finch, all caged separately ; and in a large flight
cage I have fifteen small birds, including Silverbills Orange
Cheeks, Grey Waxbills, Cordons Bleus, Avadavats, Bronze
Mannikins, and a cock Golden-breasted Waxbill.
I think amongst all the birds I ever kept, the following
are my favourites.---Masked Parrakeet, King Parrakeet,
Barraband's Parrakeet, Parrot Finches, Long-tailed Grassfinches,
Cordons Bleus, and Avadavats ; the cock Cordon is a splendid
bird, and to see him making up to the hen is a most amusing
sight; he .gets a piece of grass or sometimes a plaintain stalk,
and holding it in his beak by the extreme tip of the stalk, lie
shuts his eyes, and sticks his tail at right angles to his body, and
sings and dances in fine style.
The Avadavats are splendid little birds although so
common, and have a pretty little song.
By the way, I have never seen the Orange-cheek Wax-
bill credited with a song; both my males sing every night, just
at dusk ; they stand with their necks outstretched and their
tails waving quickly^ from side to side.
I intend, next year, to go in for Tanagers if I find sufficient
time to devote to soft-bills, and will then give my experiences
with these brightly-plumaged birds.
P.S.--I have had. eggs from many different species, but
have never reared a young one, owing to the birds being mixed
together; the Bronze Mannikins have eggs at present, but the
Cordons Bleus are in their nest all day, so that I expect the eggs
are all broken ; I have not looked.
ZOOLOGICAL PHOTOGRAPHY.
We have lately been favoured with an inspection of a
charming portfolio of photographs taken by the "Zoological
Photographic Society." We find the name of a prominent mem-

probably have quieted down. I have had one over seven years, and do not find him

attention of somebody is called to them.--O. E. C.

Snow and frost--such were the conditions under which
my monthly visit to the Gardens was paid, and I must crave
Lidul gence on that account for my notes being somewhat scanty.
In the Western and Eastern Aviaries all the birds were
shut in, and therefore crowded, making observation difficult. The
Lesser Pin-tailed Sandgrouse, seemed to be settling down well
into their new quarters ; but the Japanese Buntings I was unable to
see. In the Eastern, or rather Pelican, Aviary, a fine adult Gaunet
was to be seen knocking in vain for admittance at the door of
the Pelican House. These birds are most interesting in confine-
ment, where they become very tame, and follow their keeper like
a dog; their chief drawback is their insatiable appetite, and as
they feed solely upon fish, are rather expensive pets. The
remaining place of interest is now the Parrot House, and, for
once in a way, it was the most comfortable ; the new arrivals
include, as usual, several Eclecti, which were in only fair
condition, some of them being rather travel-stained.
The greatest rarities were a pair of Schalows' Touracous,
on which Mr. Tegetmeier wrote a short account in the Field , of
2nd December (p. 891). There are several species of this group,
all of which closely resemble each other ; they are about the
size of small Pigeons, and the general colouration is green with
purple hues. They all have a large crest on the top of the head,
which, however, differs in shape in the various species. They
are nearly allied to the Cuckoos, feed entirely on fruit, and are
confined to Africa. Three species are at present represented at
the Zoo: Shalows', Great-billed, and White-crested. The chief
point of interest about this group is the colouring of the
primaries, which are of a bright and translucent red. This
colour is due to a pigment known as Turacin, which is very
soluble in water and is said to perceptibly tint it when they take
a bath.
I notice that a slight error was made in my last notes, and
that the bird described as the Uvcean Parrakeet was in reality
the Orange-shouldered Parrakeet, which was figured in the
Avicultural Magazine not long ago. The Uvoean Parrakeet is a
much larger bird, having a black back, with broad yellow
margins to all the feathers. The head and wings are bluish and
the rest of the plumage is a light 3 r ellow.

NOTE FROM THE EDITOR.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.971017441176471" page_id="32637894"  page_num="61" year="" vol="">
I am anxious, in an early number which appears under my editorship,
to explain the reason which prompted me to undertake this responsible
office.
For five years the Magazine has been conducted with much success
by two of the founders of our Society. To very many members (I know
well), to myself among them, it has at once been a source of much pleasure
and has conveyed valuable knowledge. Without it I doubt if our Society
would long exist. On Mr. Fillmer's regretted resignation, for mouths no
successor could be found to undertake the onerous work which he had
done, as at once Secretary and Editor, and it seemed as if the affairs of the
Society must necessarily be wound up. To many of us this would have
been a source of much regret. The numbers of the .Society have always
been on the increase ; this, and the fact that subscriptions are, on the
whole, regularly paid, seemed to me evidence that the Society was fulfilling
the objects for which it was founded.
Under these circumstances, I offered to be co-Secretary if another
member would share the work. Eventually arrangement was made that
Mr. Bonliote should undertake the secretarial work, and that I alone should
edit the Magazine. I undertook to do so, full}&amp;apos; conscious of the fact that I
have neither the knowledge of aviculture, nor the acquaintance with
aviculturists of 1113&amp;apos; predecessors, simply, as it seemed to me, to save the
Society from collapse.
There are one or two points to which I venture to call the attention
of members.
1. It is necessar}&amp;apos; that "copy" intended for one month's Magazine
should reach me not later than in the earliest days of the previous month.
My predecessors both lived near the Printers and in a town with great
postal conveniences. I live 200 miles from the Printers ; have but one post
on week-days, and none on Sunda\&amp;apos;s. That the "proofs" may be duly
forwarded for correction to the authors, and to all the members of the
Executive Committee, it is absolutel)&amp;apos; necessary that they should be in type
earl\&amp;apos; in the month.
2. I venture to ask for contributions from a still wider circle among
our members than have hitherto written for the Magazine. On re-reading

the programme of the Society's work, which appeared in the first number,
I am struck with the good sense of a passage, which I reproduce--"Those
who are not prepared to write a formal article, have generally met with
some little facts or fancies in their avicultural experience, which will be of
interest to others, and if they will note them down and send them to the
Editor, they will place the rest of the Society under an obligation. We
want the benefit of the practical experience of all." The late Editor at
one time gave us an interesting column headed "Avicultural Small-Talk."
I should like to revive this column, if members would send me scraps of
news on such points, among others, as birds which they winter out of doors,
dates at which they turn out more tender birds in Spring, and house them
again in Autumn ; dates at which various species nest both indoors and
out of doors.
3. We have lately had fewer descriptions than formerly of the aviaries
and birdrooms of members. My experience is that such descriptions have
great interest for aviculturists, and often lead to pleasant visits and
personal accpiaintance. I shall be grateful to those wdio will send me
accounts of their arrangements for their birds, even though the latter be
ever so few. O. E. CRESSWEIE.
THE BICHENO-ZEBRA FINCH.
Sir, --My description of the hybrid in the Grassfinch class at Balliam
does not appear to be accepted as correct. There is, however, no doubt
whatever that the bird is exactly as described in the catalogue--a male
hybrid bred from a male Bicheno finch and a female Zebra finch. If those
interested in the subject will refer to Die Gefiederte Welt , Nos. 1 and 2,
1898, they will find a long article by a prominent aviculturist, in which the
production of this hybrid is fully described. My bird is one of the brood
there mentioned. The sex of the hybrids could not be distinguished by the
plumage, and none possessed the chestnut markings of a male Zebra finch.
I received the bird direct from the breeder, who informed me that it
was a male, and that fertile eggs were produced when he mated it w&amp;apos;ith a
female Bengalese. It has a continual call of four syllables.
The same gentleman sent me a hen Black-rumped finch as a com-
panion to the hybrid. This differs from the ordinary Bicheno finch, in
having a black rump instead of a white one. The distinction might easily
be overlooked, but if the wings be parted the difference is very striking. It
is claimed to be a distinct species (c). L. W. Hawkins.

Sir,--A t page 39 of the December number, Miss . Brampton raised a
question of no limited importance. Assuming that the present generation
of Moorhens are like their forefathers, and that they have the same tastes
all over the country, I can saj&amp;apos; positively, from many years' observations
and numerous experiments, that Moorhens eat baby fish very freely. Even
(c) It will be remembered that I figured this hybrid in January, 1898, from a skin
lent to me by Mr. Abrahams, and the illustration and description are reproduced in
" Foreign Bird Keeping." I compared them with the living&amp;apos; bird at the Palace Show, and
was pleased to find little difference between the two.--A. G. B.

in deep ponds, etc., without shallows, they manage to catch a good number,
mostly along the margins, and certainly devour all they cau catch. But in
ponds with shallows and suitable reeds, Moorhens will sometimes devour
every baby fish hatched out, entirely keeping down the stock of fish.
In order to verify my suspicions as to the marauders which spoiled
my early piscicultural attempts, and to test their voracity, I have dyked off
little shallows at the edges of the ponds, near to the shallows systematically
visited by the Moorhens, stocked them with young dace, etc., and on the
following morning have invariably found every fish gone. The bottoms of
the enclosed parts, and the dykes, would be so covered with the prints of
the Moorhens' feet that an unmarked squar e inch could hardly be found
I have had many scores taken in a single night of by no means small fry.
Nevertheless, the newly hatched fish are those which are most easily&amp;apos; picked
up by the Moorhens.
In some ponds, however, it is the insect larvae which devour the
spawn and stop the increase. Reginald Phigeipps.

EGG-BINDING IN BIRDS.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999044655172414" page_id="32637896"  page_num="63" year="" vol="">
Sir, --I have recently tried a treatment for egg-binding which was
recommended to me by a German breeder of Canaries, with the greatest
success, and as it appears to be different to that practised in this country,
perhaps some member, who may have a bird suffering in this way, might be
interested to hear of my experience.
Two of my Gouldian Finches paired, a cock Black-head and a lieu
Red-head. They made a nest in a cocoa-nut, and she laid one egg a few
day&amp;apos;s ago. Two day&amp;apos;s later, I found her in a heap at the bottom of the cage,
and apparently dy&amp;apos;ing : her eyes were shut and she was panting very much.
I took her out and examined her, and saw what was the matter. I held her
in my hand on her back under a cold water tap, gently&amp;apos; turned on, for quite
a minute, letting the water run down towards her tail. Then I wrapped
her, all but her head, in a piece of very hot flannel; she lay like this in my T
lap, too ill to resist. In an hour&amp;apos;s time, as there was no result, I repeated
the process--as I was told to do--and in less than ten minutes the egg came
away&amp;apos;, and next morning she was hopping about gaily&amp;apos;. Yesterday&amp;apos; the same
thing happened again, and I treated her in the same way, with the same
result, and to-day she is looking as well and brisk as possible.
Now I have separated the liens for the present, for evidently they&amp;apos; are
not in breeding condition. I notice that the beaks of all the cock-birds
have become white and transparent, with red tips--but only&amp;apos; the beak of
this one hen--all the others are quite dark.
Of this pair, I have had the cock since December, 1S96, and the hen
since April, 1S97 ; her mate died a few day&amp;apos;s after I had bought them. They
have both moulted three times--in April and May each year--and they are
extremely&amp;apos; tame.
If y&amp;apos;ou think this account would be of any interest or use, I should be
glad to hear the views of others ; if not, please take no further trouble
about it. C. D. RoTCH.

THE SACRED KINGFISHER.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.974566076923077" page_id="32637897"  page_num="64" year="" vol="">
Sir, --In Dr. Simpson's notes on the Balham Show, he writes thus:---
"A very remarkable bird was the Sacred Kingfisher, a bird wdiose un-
obtrusive brown plumage formed a curious contrast with a pair of
wonderful deep-blue eyes."
That Halcyon saneta should thus be described, appears to me at least
remarkable, considering that its plumage is deep-blue (which in certain
lights appears green) and buff ; and its eyes are a dark brown.
The only bird of this species shewn at Balham belonged to me; and,
for reasons which I explained in a foot-note in last mouth's issue, this bird
did not arrive at the Show until the evening of the opening day, and, I
believe, long after Dr. Simpson had left. I can only imagine, therefore, that
he had in mind, when writing this description, Mr. Fulljames' Bower Bird,
which was in the greenish-brown plumage of the female and immature
male, and which species has blue eyes. I think that this explanation is
uecessarv, as it is surely rather hard upon the brilliant Sacred Kingfisher
to describe its plumage as " unobtrusive brown." D. Seth-Smith,
[The mistake which seems to have so mystified Mr. Seth-Smith, is
very easily explained. My note referred to Ho. 5^?, described in the cata-
logue as a Sacred Kingfisher.--C. S. S.]
THE BLEEDING-HEART PIGEON.
Sir,--N oting what Mr. Seth-Smith rightly states respecting the
colour of the eyes in the Satin Bower-bird (of which I have had a healthy
pair since the iStli September last) it occurs to me that I have not put on
record the fact that the eyes of the Bleeding-Heart Pigeon are not brown,
as described, but are reddish plum-coloured. My hen died just after her
moult, and I examined the eyes immediately after death. A. G. BuTEER.

A NATURALIST'S NOTES IN ECUADOR.

Perhaps there is no country in the world where birds
abound in such numbers and varieties, as in Ecuador. At least, so I
think who have just returned from spending two years there, and
after wandering about among almost all other " birdy " parts of
the globe. It is not the numbers alone that make it so interesting
to the ornithologist, for it is also the home of the mighty Condor,
the largest bird on the wing, to the smallest species of Humming-
bird known, no larger than an ordinary sized bumble bee. Between
these range endless varieties of birds of prey ; the strange and
little known Umbrella-birds ; some ten or more representatives
of the Trogon family ; the two most beautiful of the three&amp;apos;known
species of the Cock of the Rock, Rupicola sanguinolenta and
R. peruviana; Toucans galore, and bewildering numbers of
Tanagers, Hangnests, Tyrants, and other birds strange or
beautiful. So Ecuador is one vast museum of natural history,
and the chief reason of this is its geographical position and its
formation. Here we have a country situated right on the
Blquator, and divided down the centre in its entire length by the
mighty Andes, embracing every variety of climate from perpetual
snow to the sweltering heat of its unhealthy lowlands. Thus
birds of some kind or another, find a congenial home at every
altitude between these two extremes. And again, it is so in-
accessible and thinly populated, that bird life holds undisturbed
sway in its vast mountain solitudes, and its primeval forests,
which reach from the coast, to an altitude of 10,000 ft. or more
on the western side ; then, skipping its immense central table-
lands, start again on the eastern side of the Andes, and cover
almost the whole of Brazil and tropical South America.
Myself and Mr. Claud Hamilton travelled from the Pacific
coast, and, after crossing all the mountain ranges, journeyed for
weeks on foot down through the damp, uninhabited, virgin

forests on the eastern side, until we reached the head waters of
the Amazon. After staying for months among the wild Indian
tribes there, we descended the Napo in dugouts, and so reached
the Maranon, where we took boats for the remaining 4,000 miles
down to Para, having thus crossed the entire Continent.
It is from notes and observations made on this journey,
a journey made solely for the purpose of taking toll from the
feathered inhabitants of the country, that I shall endeavour to
write a few articles which I trust may prove of interest to some
members of the Avicultural Society.
There are many things connected with bird life in the
tropics that would surprise some of our aviculturists at home. For
instance, who would not, in his mind's eye, associate Humming-
birds, nature's living jewels, with sunny flower-bedecked glades?
It is true that numbers of them are found (and some beautiful
ones, too) in the hot forests of tropical America, but they are
much more numerous, and far more beautiful in the higher
Andes ; some of the loveliest of all being found at altitudes of
between eight and thirteen thousand feet, whilst the little Black
Hummer with a sapphire throat, known as Jameson's Humming-
bird, I have seen, when camping out on the volcano of Pichincha,
Condor shooting, flying past our tent in a heavy snow storm,
with its mournful twit , twit , at an altitude of over 14,000 ft. I
have noticed others of the same family sitting on the telegraph
wires (apparently a favourite post of theirs) along the dusty
roads in the central highlands, in the most prosaic manner
possible, watching, perchance, for passing insects, darting into
the air to seize their prey on the wing, and always returning to
the same spot. It seems to be almost a general rule in Ecuador,
that Humming-birds which make their home in the dense forests,
lack almost entirely the beautiful iridescence peculiar to most
members of the family. But it they lack colour, many of them
have peculiarities of form, as for instance, the wonderful curved
bill of the Eutoxeres aqitila, the saw bill of the Androdon equa-
torialis, and the elongated tail-feathers of Pheethomis syrmato-
phorus. In showing Humming-birds' skins to friends at home,
one always hears the remark, " How lovely they must look flying
about 1 " It is true they do look pretty with their graceful poses,
but their wonderful colouring is generally then almost entirely
invisible, and certainly not seen to proper advantage, many
species looking much the same as one another in freedom, but
vastly different when held in the hand and turned to the right
light. But however fascinating these birds are, I must leave

them, for as they can unfortunately never become denizens ot
our aviaries, they will not possess much interest for the
aviculturist.
There are many beautiful Tanagers, notabty the Blue-
shouldered Tauager (Compsocoma victorini) whose home is in very
temperate regions, where if mild during the day, it is very cold
at night. There is also that singularly handsome Toucan
(.Andigena laminirostris ) which inhabits a gloomy region, where
we had sharp frosts nearly every night during the fortnight of
our stay there. Real Gulls, too we found in numbers on the
small solitary lagoons in the cold, devastated and uninhabited
regions around the smoking cone of Cotopaxi, at an altitude of
quite 13,000 ft., and perhaps 150 miles from the coast. These are
points of interest in bird life, that people at home would hardly
credit.
In looking over our collection of .skins (comprising some
700 species, of which 130 are Hummers) I am at once struck
with the fact that there are perhaps not more than a dozen of
them I have seen in captivity at home ; when scores of them
would undoubtedly be easy to keep, and make delightful cage
birds. We should imagine many of them if we saw them in the
dealers' shops to be perhaps delicate and difficult to keep, when
probably they would have come from some of the temperate
regions of the Andes, and, as far as the climate would be
concerned, could with ease and comfort pass the winter in our
outdoor aviaries.
It is a misfortune that the Ecuadorian birds are so little
known to us, and that the dealers do not endeavour to procure
more birds &amp;quot;for us from there. I am afraid, though, there are
many difficulties in the way which would be hard to overcome.
Iu the first place, live birds could not be shipped direct to our
English ports, as it would be all but impossible to send them
home all the way round Cape Horn ; and the only other route
available is via the Isthmus of Panama, where, I imagine, live
stock would meet with but scant attention from the rail-
way officials. Still, our dealers might manage it by having
agents in Panama and Colon. Perhaps when the canal is
opened all that will be changed, and many Ecuadorian birds,
at present unknown to us by living specimens, will be quite
familiar objedts in our aviaries. Another great obstacle is the
difficulty of communication from the coast to the interior of
Ecuador. With the exception of the port of Guayaquil, there is
no communication from any port direct to Quito, the capital, and

when the roads are in good condition, this is seven days ride.
The traveller has to cross the Chimborazo Pass at an altitude of
14,200 ft., and, on coming up from the coast, the change from the
steaming heat of the forests to the icy winds from the snows, is
very rapid, and trying alike to man and beast.
The Ecuadorians seem to take no interest whatever in the
bird life which surrounds them on every side, and it is quite the
exception rather than the rule to find them keeping birds in
captivity, and when they do, their ambition does not soar beyond
a Parrot. However, at times in Guayaquil, birds are offered for
sale in fair quantities, even if the varieties in vogue are limited,
No doubt the European population has caused a certain demand
for them there, and prices range very cheap indeed--1 real (ajd.)
or 2 reals each seems to be the usual price for almost any bird.
At the former price can be bought any number of the little
Orange-flanked Parrakeets, and very tame indeed they all seem.
These birds are exceedingly common in the neighbourhood, and
can be met with almost anywhere in vast flocks. "Paviches"
they are locally called. They commit great damage in the banana
plantations, and bananas seem to be their staple food in captivity.
In fact, when the natives keep a bird of any kind, they seem
to think, and apparently rightly, it doesn't want any other
food beyond bananas or oranges. I noticed almost the same
thing in the East Indian Islands : the natives there, seldom gave
a bird anything to eat beyond boiled rice, the only change being
an occasional banana. Many animals which decidedly ought to
have had quite a different diet, they kept on the universal rice
also. How long they survived it I am unable to say, but in some
cases they seemed healthy enough. Certain specimens of
Ecledtus, Purple-capped, Ceram, and other Tories which
came under my notice, had lived entirely on plainly
boiled rice, and sometimes a banana, for several years in
some instances. I am often inclined to think that we give
our birds far too many delicacies in captivity, and that
many kinds would live with us longer than they do, on a plainer
diet. I have noticed many times, in bringing birds home from
abroad, that after one has weaned them off on to insectivorous
and other foods, they have lost much of the brilliancy of
colouring which they had when bananas formed their sole diet.
Another bird common all along the western side of
Ecuador, and exceedingly common in parts of the province of
Cauca, in Columbia, is the Red-faced Conure (C. 7 &amp;apos;ubrolarvatus).
This very handsome bird seems to be not very well known with

and perhaps some members of the Avicultural Society may have
others. These birds I saw offered for sale in Guayaquil at 5d.
each, and no doubt at half that price they could have been
bought. Being rather large birds, they show off their colours to
advantage. I imagine, though, they must be rather noisy birds
to keep, for they have a disagreeable shriek. They ought not to
be at all delicate, for we shot specimens near the Volcano of
Purace, by Popayan in Columbia, at an altitude of over 8,000 ft.
In passing through the little village of Carmen (still in
Columbia) on our ride from Buenaventura to Cali, we saw the
same birds in immense clouds, coming from their feeding grounds
in the high mountain forests, to pass the night in the little
sheltered valley below. Carmen could boast of little else in the
way of vegetation but bamboos, which grew in great thickets, and
every branch of these giant grasses was literally weighing down
with its burden of C. rubrolarvatus. The noise was simply deaf-
ening ! Those we shot by the acid waterfall of Parace, in the month
of May, 1898, were undoubtedly nesting in the crevices of the per-
pendicular cliffs there: for on the report of our firearms, numbers
of them flew screaming from the holes and ledges around. I
noticed, too, that the plumage of some was draggled, evidently
by sitting on their eggs.
I11 both the hot and temperate regions of Western
Ecuador, we collected a surprising number of members of the
Tanager family. These were I think, with only one exception,
of the most exquisite, and in some cases, remarkable arrange-
ment and blending of colours. The exception was the Dusky
Tanager {Tanagrapalmaruvi). This bird is one of the very few
birds which is found on both Eastern and Western sides of the
Andes without any change in its plumage. It inhabits the hot
regions on both sides up to an altitude of perhaps 1,500 feet.
Seen in a good light, it is a dusky violet colour, with a lighter
head of a greenish reflection, and the same shade occurs on the
wings. It is about the same size as the Scarlet Tanager of Brazil,
but of a somewhat different shape. I am writing of the bird
without having a skin at hand to refer to, but if I remember
rightly, it was impossible to distinguish the difference between
the sexes apart, but seen together, the male was a little brighter.
They strike one at once as being hardy birds, suitable for cage
life. They are not frequenters of the dense forests, I do not
remember that I found any of the Tanager family to be so,
although many of them like to hide about in bushes, and some

of them always keep near the ground. They all delight in
the more open country on the mountain slopes, or in sunny
clearings near the forests, and pass their time in the fruit trees
near human dwellings. A banana plantation is a sure attraction
for the Dusky Tanager, if it happens there are ripe bunches
about. After he has taken his fill he will sit, on the bare branch
for preference, of some tree, and pour forth his quite melodious
song. This song would be decidedly one of his great attractions
in captivity, for it would do credit to almost any bird. Another
Tanager inhabiting the same region but confined only to the
Western side, is the Yellovv-rumped Tanager (.Rhamphocceclus
icteronotus). If any member of the Society should have kept
these birds alive, I should be pleased to be informed of the fact.
This bird has charmed me in a way that no other bird has done,
that I can remember. In shape, size and habits, it is the
duplicate of the well known Scarlet Tanager. The whole of the
plumage is of a rich black, resembling plush ; but the rump is
of the purest and brightest sulphur colour imaginable. In
repose, it spreads the yellow back feathers over its wings, showing
the colour off to the greatest advantage. Its song is about equal
to that of the Scarlet Tanager. Around a hut, in a clearing in
the virgin forests, among the Colorado Indians on the Western
Side, rejoicing in the grand-sounding name of Santo Domingo
de los Colorados, these birds were as common as Sparrows are at
home. They also played great havoc among the fruit, but were
also indefatigable in searching for insects among the trees, looking
under every leaf. The} 7 were more persevering, in this respect,
than any other Tanagers I saw, and were only out-done at it by
the Dacnis family. In September and October 1S9S, these birds
were still nesting in the thick orange trees around our hut.
Although the nests were not more than from seven to nine feet
above the ground, it was quite a difficult matter to get at them,
for the trees were so thick and thorny, and the nests so well in
the middle, that the only thing to do was to cut part of the tree
away. The nests were rather large structures, composed of dry
grass and dead leaves, and were not at all easy to find, although
the trees stood well out in the open ; they contained in some
cases, five young ones, which resemble the females and do not
attain mature plumage, until probably the second year, for young
males in only half adult plumage, I saw with nests of their own.
The female is brown instead of black, with the yellow of a less
brilliant shade, and some of the same colour about the wings ;
again, not having the skins at hand to refer to, I am unable to
give an exact description of it just now. This bird is replaced

ill Columbia by a Red-Rumped variety, otherwise they are
identically alike in all ways, and it is merely a matter of taste,
which is the most beautiful.
After referring to one more member of the same family,
I must leave the subject till next month, when I shall write of
some Tanagers I kept out there for a time, and, if space permits,
in the same article I will deal with the Hangnest family.
The last one for the present, is the Pale Blue Tanager
Tanagra cana. Besides being very beautiful, this appears to me
a most desirable bird to keep. It has such a wide range, that I
think it must probably be known to, and have been kept by some
of our members, although personally I have never seen it in
England. This bird is exactly the same shape and size, as the
Dusky Tanager, and like it, has also a melodious song. The
true Tanagra cana , were also very common at Santo Domingo,
and were to be found all day long among the ripe bananas.
The same bird, but a little larger, we found in numbers through-
out Columbia, where they were frequently kept in cages. At
one house we lived in, in Cali, one was kept in a cage in the
"patio," and although this was in the centre of a fairly
large town, not a day passed without my seeing two,
and sometimes three, wild ones together, of the same
kind, sitting on the outside of the cage singing. These
birds seem remarkably tame and confiding, and I never saw one
but what would readily come and peck at one's finger through
the cage. In Columbia, they generally seemed to be fed entirely
on oranges, but in a few cases I noticed it was varied by a little
soaked bread. As I said before, these birds have a very wide
range, and if I mistake not, there are some four or five varieties,
varying only in size or intensity of colouring, and extending
throughout Central and Tropical S. America. I saw a number
of these birds in an obscure dealer's shop at Cartagena, on the
north coast of Columbia. As boats run direct between Liverpool
and that port, it ought to be easy for dealers to obtain them for
us. Those we shot at Santo Domingo, were remarkably blue, of
a lovely pale blue all over, and the wing leathers and tail, of an
almost sapphire hue. In other localities, we found them more
of a lavender shade on the body. This bird is replaced on the
Eastern Side of the mountains by one of exactly the same size
and colour, but with beautiful white shoulders, more conspicuous
in the male than in the female. This kind we first met with, at
the foot of the Andes, at the head waters of the Rio Napo, and saw
it again flying among the palms in the centre of the city of Para,

5,000 miles further east. With its white shoulders, it looks very
pretty flying. This is the Tanagra Ccelestis. I noticed that both
kinds were extremely fond of bathing.

MY DOVES' AVIARY.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996499081081081" page_id="32637905"  page_num="72" year="" vol="">
By Miss R. Anderson.
Although my dove aviary is only a small structure, some
19 feet long by 12 feet wide, yet it has this advantage, that being
close to the house I can see my birds from the windows on a wet
day, without going out of doors. The north and east sides of the
aviary are built against very high walls; on the west, the half
inch wire netting comes right down to the ground ; but on the
south it is boarded up for two feet. On this last side there is a
porch with double doors; the outer one of wood, the inner of
wire. A great drawback to the aviary is the lack of sunshine,
owing to the fact that so many trees are growing round it, but
this does not seem to affect the health of the birds in any way.
A shelter, about four feet wide, runs across the eastern end. It
has wire netting in front to within two feet of the ground, and a
door, generally left wide open, leads into the flight; a small
wire-covered window faces the south. The shelter is white-
washed inside, and fitted with perches and shelves.
The flight was added on about eighteen mouths ago. The
ground was very difficult to build on, being filled with tree roots
and several tree trunks had to be enclosed, as we were unwilling
to cut them down.
Having got the aviary finished, I turned my birds into it;
they seemed very happy, but I little knew that my difficulties
had only just begun. My first enemies were rats. For some
unknown reason,--unless it was the pulling down of some old
buildings near,--they began to appear, and I found holes bur-
rowed close to the flight. Though the foundations were on
bricks, I had omitted to sink wire netting below, the tree roots
making it almost an impossibility. There seemed no ether
remedy than to have the floor--which was a slope of bare earth,
save for an asliphalte walk that bordered the north side--
cemented and tiled. Apart from keeping out the rats, I think
this a great improvement, as the place can now be well brushed
out every week with water, which escapes through a small out-
let in the front, that is blocked up when not in use.
I was next troubled with cats. Though unable to actually
get at the birds, they distressed them very much. Twice I found

many of the doves with badl}^ cut wings, wounded against the
netting, and drops of blood all over the floor. I consulted with
the local joiner, a very practical man, who gave it as his opinion,
that unless the mischief was caused by "an howl" he could stop
it, though w T hy he thought the mere sight of an owl could frighten
the birds to such an extent I do not know. This joiner put
up for me six ordinary striped canvas roller blinds, on the two
open sides of the aviary. These blinds are drawn down every
night at dusk, and to prevent them flapping are secured at the
bottom with hooks and rings. The west blinds, being rather
long and wide, have light laths of wood slipped across to hold
them tight to the wire. I have found these blinds useful for
other purposes than the one they were originally intended for.
In winter they keep the place warmer, and afford protection in a
strong wind, and if a nervous bird is nesting close to the wires,
the blind in front of the nest can be kept lowered, and so ensure
perfect quiet. As an additional precaution against the cats, I
had wire netting fastened loosely round the aviary top, slanting
outwards, in the same manner as that used in pheasantries to
keep out foxes. The cats still frequent the garden at night, but
I have the satisfaction of feeling my birds have never suffered
since.
Eater on, mice made their appearance, and worried the birds
whilst nesting. A pair of Turtles (Turtur turtur), who had
sat very steadily were disturbed. Both birds are very tame, so I
caught the hen and put her back on fhe eggs, but could not
induce her to stay. It was very pretty to watch these two birds
while nesting, come on my hands to be fed. They did not mind
my standing close to the nest in the least. Direct^ the one
sitting left the nest to fly to me, the other would at once take
its place on the eggs, and patiently wait until the first bird had
finished feeding. The hen, whom I named "Jamie," mistaking
her at first for the cock, loves to nestle in my hand and be
petted, but though so affectionate, she is very jealous, and
deeply resents me bestowing too much attention on any of the
other doves.
Eventually, I got rid of the mice by catching them in little
break-back traps, known as the " Out-'o-sight " mouse-trap.
They cost about fourpence each, and I have found them most
effective . To prevent any risk of the doves getting caught in
them, I had each trap screwed into a small wooden box (which
also protects them from the rain), part of the front end being cut
out to allow room for the mouse to enter. The box lid can be

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.97401934883721" page_id="32637907"  page_num="74" year="" vol="">
turned back to allow the trap to be baited, or re-set. As there is
no earth in the flight it is impossible to plant any shrubs, so I
have quantities of Scotch Fir branches wired to the walls, and to
the enclosed tree trunks. In these branches are tied many little
flat-bottomed baskets, that I make myself, for the birds to nest
in, and which they much appreciate. One advantage of the fir
branches is that they can easily be renewed when necessary.
In this aviary I placed Turtles ( Turtur turtur), Aurita
(&amp;apos;Zenaida aurita), Indian Green-winged (Chalcophaps indica ),
Australian Crested Marsh Doves ( Ocyphaps lophotes ), and a pair
of Necklace Doves ( Turtur tigrinus). All these have stood
twenty-six degrees of frost without any sign of discomfort. The
remainder of my doves live in a heated aviary. One of them, a
cock Diamond Dove, which has just finished moulting, has
changed from a decided pale grey to quite a drab colour. My
Indian Green-winged Doves are very uninteresting, they have
shown no signs of nesting, their plumage is always ragged, and
they spend all their time in the shelter, though I noticed in the
summer they came out at night to roost in a box tree. The
Necklace Doves I purchased from one of our members at the
Palace Show, Oct. 1898. I think this species must vary a good
deal. Those in the Zoo are larger and browner, and seem to lack
the pretty blush-coloured breasts of my own birds. They are
very gentle, and never fight unless attacked. The hen laid eggs
every few weeks, but was much disturbed by the Crested Doves,
which insisted on taking possession of every nest that the Neck-
laces made, and sitting diligently on the eggs, and being much
the stronger birds of the two, the rightful owners were powerless
to resist. This happened so often that I was obliged to move
the Crested Doves into another smaller aviary.. Here, after
several nests of clear eggs, they reared one fine young one.
They are intensely proud of it, and it still roosts between the
old birds every night. I noticed one of the parents feeding it
when it was quite a month old.
The next enemy of the unfortunate Necklaces was the
cock Aurita Dove. This fine, but bad-tempered bird, used to-
hide regularly in the shelter, and when the Necklaces, but par-
ticularly the cock, came down to feed, he would dart out and
drive them off, and then retire to his hiding-place, to await his
next opportunity. This occurred many times, and seriously
interfered with the rearing of the young Necklaces, but I got
over the difficulty by placing pans of food and water close to the
nest, using two spare nest baskets as brackets. The poor Neck-

<bodyText confidence="0.999386837209303" page_id="32637908"  page_num="75" year="" vol="">
laces were very grateful, and the cock at once began to feed.
The Aurita, who was really a great coward, was no match for his
opponent on the higher level It was most amusing to watch the
Necklace cock guarding the hen on the nest. He would take up
his stand near her, and never for a moment take his eyes off his
enemy, who would come creeping up to him through the
branches. Suddenly there would be a raising of wings, and a
sharp interchange of blows, and the Aurita would invariably fly
off discomfited, leaving the victor triumphant. My doves are
fed on dari, a little hemp and rice, and a good deal of wheat.
They greatly enjoy cuttle fish bone, scraped with a knife into
very small pieces and placed in their grit pot. This diet seems
to suit them, for---I do not say it in any boasting spirit--in the
last two years I have not had a single death or real case of ill-
ness, save four very young birds which died in the nest. The
Necklaces have now eight very fine young ones, and would have
had many more, but that so many of the eggs got broken from
various causes. The parents are in splendid condition, but I
have separated them for the winter months.
I have found a trap-cage (a rough frame-work of wood
covered with wire netting), very useful for catching up the doves.
The food pan I place inside the cage, and if set a few days before-
hand, the birds soon get used to it. The ends of the trap hinge
at the top, and are raised by a piece of strong cord fastened to
them, and passed through a hook screwed in a wooden support
that runs across the top of the aviary. The cord is then threaded
through the netting in the aviary front, and tied tightly to a
heavy weight some distance off outside. This keeps up the
ends of the trap, and when the birds go in to feed the string can
be loosened, and the doors closed, without alarming them by
coming too near ; thus they are caught quite easily. Doves are
very soon frightened, and an attempt to catch one in the hand,
generally ends with me, in terrifying them all, and the work of
months of trying to get them tame is undone in a few minutes,
added to this there is the risk of the birds injuring their wings
against the wires. When I caught the hen Necklace in the trap
she scarcely seemed to know she was a prisoner, and was quietly
carried, cage and all, down to my second aviary.
I must just mention my flight of Barbary Doves that fly
loose about the garden. They never wander far, and assemble
close to the house, at stated hours, three times a day, to be fed.
At night, all the year round, they all roost together in a large
pink hawthorn tree, quite despising a dovecote, erected for their

benefit close by. There is one drawback to having them so near
the house. They will not understand that plate-glass windows
cannot be flown against with impunity. Several doves have
been killed outright, though if only badly stunned, I have found
a little warm milk, and a small quantity of weak brandy and
water, and of course perfect quiet for a short time, will generally
restore them.

THE BREEDING SEASON OF 1899.

By E. G. B. Meade-Waedo.
In recording the results of the past nesting season here,
I am afraid that the readers will consider that there is very little
to relate, which is certainly the case, especially as the most
interesting episode, viz., the breeding of the Scops Owl, has
already been fully described. The Spring this year was a
singularly cold and cheerless one, without a real spring-like day
until the glorious Summer suddenly broke on us, about the end
of May and continued without interruption until September.
Our first nest this year was that of the old Eagle Owls,
who hatched two young ones on April 3rd--this is fully a mouth
later than usual. Both young were reared : which make ninety-
seven reared during my lifetime. Hardly any eggs have been
laid but what have been hatched, and no young one has ever
died, with the exception of one that was choked ; the old pair
going on year after year having their two or three young as
regular as clockwork.
My Ural Owls disappointed me, as, though the hen (who
is very tame) wanted to nest badly and laid eggs, the presumed
cock was too wild to take any interest in the proceedings. He is
tamer now, however, and calls continuously a loud hoot, not
unlike the barking of a fox but with a curious hollow ring in it.
So everything may go well next season. The extraordinary
light and floating flight of this great long-tailed Owl must be
seen to be realized.
This is the first year, for many years, tha.t my Trumpeter
Bullfinches have failed to rear any young ones ; not through any
fault of theirs, however, as a fine brood of six was hatched in
April, but, owing to the lateness of the season, there was
absolutely not a morsel of the weeds they rear their young on,
forward enough to contain the half-ripened seeds that are
necessary. So the young died of starvation, and the old birds
did not nest again, but moulted very early. In their wild state

they nest in February and March, but in other years these have
nested throughout the summer in the aviary.
I kept two pairs of Painted Quails ; they had to be
separated very early as the cocks fought most furiously,
allowing themselves to be picked up, and fighting whilst
being held in the hand. The hens laid the most astounding
quantity of eggs : commencing to lay in February, they laid
until July without stopping, and must have laid well over one
hundred eggs apiece. I usually left about twelve of the freshest
eggs in the nest, but it was not until July 9th that they both
commenced to sit, on ten and eleven eggs respectively. They
hatched seventeen young ones between them, the whole of which
they reared. The young ones at five weeks old were apparently
quite ready to commence nesting, the little cocks making up to
their mothers ! who had begun to lay again when their broods
were a fortnight old, and continued to lay until the beginning of
October. This enormous quantity of eggs cannot be natural, of
course, but the Common Quail will hatch and rear three or four
broods of from nine to twelve young ones in a season.
My good old female Pin-tailed Sandgrouse hatched three
beautiful young ones on June nth; they were all reared, and
proved to be two cocks and one hen. This is the first time that
the full clutch has been hatched and reared here, and these are
the first cocks, although I have bred eight hens. The cock of
this nest was a Western Pin-tailed Sandgrouse, the colours of
which are much more intense than in the Eastern form. The
young cocks, which are half-breds, shew no signs of the Eastern
form, but are most brilliantly marked. Another pair of Pin-
tailed Sandgrouse did nothing but lay eggs, as the cock was a
confirmed egg-eater.
I will only refer to the Scops Owl by saying that four out
of the six young ones reared were given their liberty as soon as
able to shift for themselves, and that they all throve and are still
occasionally to be seen and heard about. They are most enter-
taining to watch on the wing, catching everything in their feet,
and almost stopping still in their flight while they put their
heads down to take the moth or beetle.
Of Waterfowl, the most interesting hatch was a brood of
Shovellers--eight young were hatched from eight eggs, and
seven young ones are now full grown. The nest was nearly a
quarter-of-a-mile from the water--a most laborious walk for the
old duck, being mostly through dense cover. The young of the
Shoveller are very hard to rear, as they absolutely refuse to pick

Up any food whatever, taking all their nourishment by sifting
the surface of the water ; so unless on a pond with abundance of
natural food, they would soon perish. Ours were reared by
scattering fresh ants' nests on the water, when the cocoons to a
great extent float.
To those interested in the moulting of Waterfowl, it is
most interesting to note that the first plumage assumed by the
young drakes in Autumn is not their full Winter breeding
plumage, as in the majority of the wild fowl, but the eclipse
plumage ; the full colour will have to be assumed in the Spring.
So these young drakes will have to complete three moults in
little over six months.
The Pratincoles that I had great hopes of disappointed me,
as I was sure of at least one nest ; so did also my Rosy-breasted
Gulls. These latter are only three years old, and Gulls are
always a long time coming to maturity. It is very curious to
note that the breeding colour of the soft parts of this Gull are
exactly the reverse of what might be expected--the red legs and
beak of Autumn and Winter are changed to black in the
breeding season.
The last nests to record are those of the Gouldian
Finches. As in other years, these charming little birds nested
in the Autumn, each pur hatching four young ones in the
middle of September, the whole of which they reared.
Without pretending to have discovered how to manage
these little birds, I may say that since I procured one pair, five
years ago, I have found them the hardiest and most prolific of
small birds. I put them out in the perfectly open aviary in
April, where they moult, and commence to breed in the end of
August or beginning of September, and I bring them in about
the middle of November--not that they appear to feel the cold
at all. Fast Autumn the original old pair hatched two clutches
of six, and reared them all. When rearing their young I cannot
detect that the old birds eat anything but hard seed, although at
other times they are very fond of grass seed, and of pulling out
the young shoots of grass on the lawn and eating the succulent
ends. The seed can be seen in the crop of the young birds,
apparently just as it is shelled ; but presumably it is somewhat
softened in the crop of the parent first. I tried two pairs of
these birds in the same aviary, for the first time, this }^ear ; but
although in a fairly roomy compartment, 20 ft. by 10 ft., they
fought so desperately that I had to leave one pair in possession.
Except when nesting, they appear the most peaceable of little
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.934637" page_id="32637912"  page_num="79" year="" vol="">
birds. The old birds do not remove any of the excreta from the
nest, the whole accumulating in a perfectly dry odourless
condition.

By Aug. F. Wiener.
The late Dr. Karl Russ was born 14th January, 1833,
and died on September 29th, 1899.
I was in great hope that the report of his death would turn
out to be a mistake, but I am sorry to say the great pioneer in
aviculture is really dead ; the decease of a son of his a few
weeks before his own death, having also been mentioned in the
papers, had led to some confusion.
Dr. Russ's father was an apothecary, and brought up his
son to the same profession. The writings of Alexander von
Humboldt seem to have had a great influence on him, and an
ode to the memory of this great naturalist, published in 1859,
soon after Humboldt's death, is probably the first literary effort
of the late Dr. Russ.
Early in the sixties numerous well-written articles on
Natural History subjects appeared in the German press, and
quickly attracted attention to their author, Dr. Karl Russ.
Birds soon became the favourite subject of his writings,
and the rapid diminution of song birds in Central Europe
attracted his attention. He traced the growing scarcity of song
birds to three causes.
( 1) . The more intense cultivation of the soil, making
suitable breeding spots more scarce, against which little more
can be done, than to educate farmers and peasants to the view
that birds are very useful, and that their wanton destruction is
bound to do harm to the agriculturist.
(2) . The regular capture and consumption of millions of
migratory birds in Italy and Southern France. To Dr. Russ's
writings are due several efforts to arrange international agree-
ments for the protection of migratory song birds.
(3) . The trade of the bird catcher for supplying the
market with so-called pets and European cage birds. The bird
catcher, where he is allowed to ply his trade, is everywhere the
worst enemy of our feathered friends. It may be taken for
granted that out of one hundred caught European wild birds
scarcely one will endure long in confinement.

Dr. Russ moved heaven and earth for the protection of
wild birds from the clutches of the bird catcher, and in course of
time succeeded in obtaining legislative enactments, which are
gradually spreading over many countries.
He was one of the first to foresee that the importation of
foreign cage birds would help the endeavours to protect European
song birds. Because the foreign finches become more easily
reconciled to confinement, they are better adapted to cage life,
and the beauty of their plumage makes them preferred as pets
to the European birds. Substituting foreign for European birds
diminishes the demand for the latter, which is the best means of
stopping the trade of the bird catcher in Europe.
Thus from a protector of European birds Dr. Russ be-
came a student, and, in course of time, an enthusiastic admirer
of foreign cage birds.
His example and writings produced many followers. I
freely confess that if I had never read some of Dr. Russ's articles
on cage birds, I should perhaps never have bought a first pair.
I ended with a large aviary containing several hundred, and
never regretted the time, trouble, and expense I devoted to the
hobby during the spare hours of a very busy life.
Some time between i860 and 1865 Dr. Russ settled in
Berlin, and practically devoted himself to the study of foreign
birds, and the production of numerous books on the subject. Of
these I may mention his " Foreign Cage Birds," his " Handbook "
and his work on foreign finches as the most useful.
I11 1862 he founded a magazine, Die Gefiederte Welt (or
Feathered World), similar in its objects to the Avicultural Maga-
zine. At first this magazine, which has flourished and is now in
its twenty-eighth year, appeared monthly, afterwards fortnightly,
and, subsequently, weekly.
During the early years of the magazine I occasionally
contributed little articles to its columns, and derived so much
pleasure from doing so, that I hope some of the readers of the
Avicultural Magazine may be induced to tty the same amuse-
ment of a spare hour. Anyone taking a deep interest in a
subject is pretty sure to have something to say which will
interest others to read.
I recall one amusing instance. I was asked, one da}q by a
friend in London where he could find a few hundred skins of
the beautiful cock of the Rock. It so happened that I had long
wished to possess this bird, but could never find a live specimen.
Asking what these skins were wanted for I heard that there

<bodyText confidence="0.976226393939394" page_id="32637914"  page_num="81" year="" vol="">
would be a demand for orange feathers and skins of this par-
ticular shade in next season's fashions of hats and bonnets. I
informed my friend, Dr. Russ, and, at his request, wrote a
vigorous protest, which he took care to have reprinted from his
Feathered World into very many continental papers. For that
season we did nip in the bud the absurd fashion of ornamenting
ladies' hats by fixing on them birds' bodies in impossible
positions and ludicrous surroundings. Unfortunately I had
signed my name, and, as a result, I received a large and
amusing number of complimentary, facetious, and also some
uncomplimentary letters of all sorts from all parts of the world.
Another time I raised a puzzling question, which was
never solved by the readers of the Feathered World , nor by Dr.
Russ either. " Why does the Stork, which is so common in Alsace
and South Germany and which crosses the Mediterranean,
never cross the English Channel, and is practically unknown in
England ? " Nobody has yet found a satisfactory answer. An
amusing explanation was, however, suggested. In Alsace the
Stork is supposed to bring the babies to young households. In
England the families are so numerous that the Storks made a
strike and have kept away ever since.
But to return to Dr. Russ. To him the credit is due of
having popularised, more than any author of his time, the
knowledge and intelligent care of foreign cage birds. His
training, his great power of observation, and his love for the
subject, fitted him wonderfully for the task which he had under-
taken. Whilst his descriptions are full of life and of personal
observation, the} 7 exert a fascination on the reader which is rarely
found in the writings of his more dogmatic contemporaries,
some of whom seemed to find it difficult to admit that an
apothecary should not only master so thoroughly a distinct
branch of Natural Science, but also achieve so rare an amount
of popularity in disseminating that science.

BIRDS.
By Arthur G. Butter, Ph.D.
It will be remembered that in Volume IV. of the Maga-
zine a notice was inserted on the cover asking Members to
forward to me dead birds having perfect wings, in order that I
might study the sexual differences in these organs. To this
request the Hon. Mrs. Carpenter and one or two other Members

very kindly responded, whilst my old friend, Mr. Abrahams, sent
me birds so rapidly for a week or two, that I could not find time
to mount them, and had to cry for quarter. In the meanwhile I
carefully mounted and noted the few perfect examples which
dropped off in my own collection.
Having gradually accumulated a mass of material, I at
length decided to sit down and sort it into some kind of order
with a view to sexual comparison, and, to my horror, I discover
that after all this collecting and labour of mounting, the bulk of
my material is practically worthless : this will become evident
when I enumerate the finch-wings in my possession in the order
in which the birds appear in my " Foreign Finches in Captivity
Serinus icterus, male; Alario cilario, male; Chrysomitris
spinus, male; C. tristis, female; Cyanospiza ciris, male; Cardinalis
cardinalis , male ; Spermopliila albigularis, female; S. gutturalis,
female. Thus, in the true finches, I discovered that I only
possessed one sex of any of the species, excepting of our Eng-
lish Sparrow and Einnet, which are easily separable, both by the
pattern and form of their wings.
In the Waxbills I am better off: Stictospiza formosci,
female ; Sporceginthus melpodus, female ; A. amandava, male ;
Lagonostida minima, and L. rufo-pida, males only ; L. ccerulescens,
both sexes; Estrilda phoenicotis, both sexes (but not in good
order) ; E. cinerea, male ; Ncochmia phaeton , female ; Pytelia
phce 7 iicoptera, male. Therefore I possess wings of both sexes in
L. ccerulescens -- the Eavender-finch, and E. phamicotis --the
Cordon-bleu, and I find the following differences :--In the male
Eavender-finch the third and following primaries (") are some-
what longer than in the female, and in the Cordon-bleu the
second to the sixth primaries are considerably longer than in the
female, giving a distinctly more elongated aspect to the wing.
In the Grass-finches I have male wings only of Poephila
mirabilis, worn female wings of Steganopleura guttata ; but both
sexes of Tce?iiopygia castanotis : here again the second to the
fifth primaries are much longer in the male than in the female,
rendering the entire wing decidedly longer: in Aidemosyne ca?itans
I only possess female wings, and, excepting in the case of the
Bengalee (which is variable) I only possess one sex in the wings
of any Mannikin, Whydah, or Weaver.
It will thus be seen that although I have gradually
accumulated much material, hardly any of it proves to be
(a). I, of course, count tlie minute first primary.

valuable for comparison, but what little there is tends to
confirm my original opinion that the wings of male birds
have longer primaries than those of female birds, in order to
give them an advantage in capturing their mates.
Probably few of our members have any idea what a pretty
collection a series of birds' wings makes when perfect and
neatly mounted on card. The wings of birds when carefully
opened are quite as beautiful as those of butterflies, and if both
sexes of many species, mounted to an even level, could be
critically compared, I am absolutely certain that they would
afford just as well-defined sexual differences as the wings of
butterflies do.
I must confess that my examination of the collection of
wings which I have accumulated has disappointed me ; not
because the differences do not exist, but because I find myself in
a position to state the fact in so few instances, owing to the
almost universally unisexual character of my material.

There is a peculiar lack of arrivals this month, and the
few there are belong chiefly to the duck tribe, which is not
studied by many members. Most people are put off from keep-
ing ducks by the idea that a large and commodious pond is a
sine qua non to successful duck keeping, but such is by no
means the case, all of the surface feeding species doing well with

a very moderate amount of water. Of course some members
have no ground or garden, which is essential, but, as many have
small gardens, in which a pair or so may be well and profitably
kept, I may be excused if I digress for a few lines as to the best
means of keeping them. I will not attempt at present to go
into the various species--but for those who may care to look it
up, there is a short article by myself on the British species in
Vol. III. of this Magazine, and there is also an excellent article
by Mr. Finn in the Feathered World of 12th inst. (b). Where a
large pond is not available, ducks will do better kept separately in
pairs, or two pairs of different species, in small enclosures ; a
space 10 ft. square, with a pond 3X2 tt., and planted with
suitable bushes to give them cover is all that is required. Low
box bushes are, in my opinion, the best, and a clump or so of
the common rush, as neither of these plants die down in winter,
nor is the verdure fresh enough for the ducks to eat it. These 1
should arrange at the back of the aviary, carpeting under the
bushes, and for some distance in front with turf--the pond
might be placed somewhere near the front, and the rest of the
aviary sanded over with clean coarse sand. As to the pond,
there need be no great difficulty, for it can easily be made with a
bag of cement and a load of sand, by any handy man--or, if
preferred, it may be made of bricks cemented together--18
inches is quite deep enough--and it should have one shelving
end, in order that the ducks may be easily able to get in and
out. Ducks, in my opinion, are best pinioned, as, if they
have full use of their wings, they are apt to hurt themselves
at "flight-time" every evening; if pinioned, a 3 feet course
of wire netting is all that is required to keep them in, provided
always there are no stray cats! As to food, mine have
ordinal poultry meal every morning, and soaked corn at
night, with regard to soaking the corn, it is the simplest plan to
put it to soak every night for the next evening, directly after
feeding them. It is not absolutely essential that the corn
should be soaked, but it is, I think, far better, and much more
appreciated. They should also have some green meat chopped
up with the meal once or twice a week. Of course, when they
have young, the ducklings should be fed as chickens, but given
plenty of ants' eggs : a handful thrown on the water will afford
them endless amusement.
Apart from the Anatidae, the only birds of interest were a
pair of Brown's Parrakeets and a Bee Eater. The former are

3n flDemoriam.
The Avicultural Society has sustained a very real loss in
the death of Eady Rowe, which occurred suddenly on Christmas
Eve. Her ladyship, who was 75 years of age, was the widow of
the late Sir Samuel Rowe, K.C.M.G. She was a devoted lover
of birds, and took a keen interest in the success of the Avi-
cultural Society. A singularly sweet and unselfish disposition
won for Eady Rowe both the confidence and affection of her
pets, and the love of all those with whom she was brought in
contact. C. S. S.
NOTICE.
The Executive Committee and the Editor much regret that 110
coloured illustrations have as yet appeared in the Magazine this year. The
delay is due solely to their endeavours to get pictures satisfactorily
reproduced without risking any deficit at the end of the year. It is hoped
that, through the kindness of some members who are lending pictures for
reproduction, it will still be possible to give four coloui-ed illustrations
during this Avicultural year.
CORRESPONDENCE.
PIGMY DOVES.
Sir, --It may interest bird lovers to know that I believe I have been
fortunate enough to pick up a pair of Pigmy Doves (Chamcepelia minutaj .
They are certainly the tiniest doves I have ever seen, being very little larger
than a Nightingale, only, of course, not so slender in build.
Their colour is, generally, a soft lavender-grey ; the primaries of the
wings having the outer quills edged with white, and the inner ones
chestnut brown. O11 the wings are some spots of gun-metal colour--or
steel-blue--which form themselves into two small bars, on the secondaries.
The side tail-feathers are banded with very dark grey. The tail is short and
square. The ej&amp;apos;es are reddish-brown ; bill, dark lead-colour ; feet, flesh-
colour.
The male bird gives vent to a tiny coo, in keeping with his miniature

size, which usually consists of three short notes-- ivuh, with, wuh --which, if
pronounced in whistling, may be obtained.
I should add that, under the wings there is a dash of chestnut brown.
I have not been able to find out from what country these lovely little
birds were brought; I only know that they were landed at Southampton.
They are in splendid condition, and very fairly tame. One of them
happened to fly out of its cage one day, and when perched on a ledge of
the window, looked no bigger than a Sparrow. It was very quick on the
wing, and flitted , rather than flew, as most doves do. I mean that its flight
was jerky, as is that in the case of such birds as the Cardinals.
I haven't been able to compare doves like the Australian Diamond
Dove with my Pigmies, but I should say that the former would look quite
large beside them. They certainly are most fascinating little things, and I
should be enchanted if they turn out to be a male and female, and breed.

TREATMENT OF A BIRD IN SICKNESS.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99930896875" page_id="32637919"  page_num="86" year="" vol="">
Sir,--I have a Lesser Sulphur-crested Cockatoo which has a slight
discharge from one nostril, and seems sleepy. Would you be good enough
to tell me if there is anything more I can do for him.
I am keeping him warm, giving a few drops of wine in the drinking
water; and feeding on canary seed, hemp, and oats, with occasionally a
piece of biscuit.
The bird was evidently only just come to England when I got him--
a week or ten days ago--and, unfortunately, I have been, and am, confined
to my room, so he has most likely been left in a draught.
Any hints as to treatment will very much oblige. R. M. Barber.
The following answer has been sent to Mrs. Bat her :
The bird, being presumably a freshly-imported bird, is probably
suffering from an ordinary cold contracted through exposure. At the
worst, it is in the incipient stage of consumption.
In either case, the preliminary treatment should be the same.
Firstly, it must be kept in a warm room, not "stuffy," but warm, with
proper ventilation. An ordinary living room, especially at this period of
the year, is the very worst place in which to keep any bird, as such a room
generally exposes a bird during the day and evening to undue warmth, and
to extreme cold and draughts at night and in the early morning. If the
bird must be kept in a living-room, the cage should be placed out of any
possible draught, below the level of any gas-burners, and carefully covered
up at night. The bowels should be immediately looked to, and if there be
either constipation or irritant diarrhoea, relief should be given either by
the administration of a few drops of pure castor oil--twenty drops in a
warmed tea-spoon would scarcely be too much, as a portion of it is certain
to be wasted in dosing the bird--or, more simply, by the addition of a little
glycerine to the drinking water. Fattening food should be given at the
same time, and I do not know of anything better for the purpose than
white sunflower seed. If this treatment be found to effect improvement it
may be discontinued, and all that will then be necessary will be to have
recourse for a short time to some tonic in the drinking water. I have

found about twenty drops of Parrish's chemical food to the ounce of
water to be a valuable tonic, but many other specifics are recommended.
Gamgee's " Pick-em-up " paste, sold by Maggs Bros., of Swansea, has been
very efficacious as a tonic with my birds. A little port wine in the water
is also good ; or, thirty drops of the tincture of perchloride of iron to the
ounce of water; or, a few drops of cod-liver oil twice daily.
If the disease is more than an ordinary catarrhal cold, and is not
alleviated by the simple remedies as above, it will require much more
drastic measures, and the simplest of these is to wring the bird's neck.
I have devoted weeks of trouble in the hope of saving the lives of
valuable freshly-imported birds, but I have always in the end wished that
I had killed them in the beginning. Such experience as I have had has
taught me that if a bird be so far gone as not to be cured by very simple
treatment, such bird may be considered as dead.

AUSTRALIAN BIRDS.

<bodyText confidence="0.84230656" page_id="32637920"  page_num="87" year="" vol="">
Sir,--I think the attention of members of the Society should be
directed to the fact that a very important Work on Australian Birds has
been prepared by Mr. Archibald Campbell, of Melbourne. The title of the
book is " Nests and Eggs of Australian Birds, including the Geographical
Distribution of the species and popular observations thereon."
Mr. Campbell has worked hard as a field naturalist for thirty years
and is able to say that &amp;apos;* the nests and eggs of nearly every species of
Australian birds have now been discovered."
The book will be a royal 8vo., printed on roughened paper: it is
proposed to illustrate it with about 130 photographic reproductions of nests,
nesting scenes, etc., also 200 coloured figures of eggs : it is believed that it
will extend to from 7- to 800 pages of letterpress.
As a work of reference such a book will be invaluable to aviculturists,
to whom the wild life of their favourites is always of considerable
interest ; and, as it is anticipated that the cost will not exceed two
guineas, it would be well for all the members of our Society who think of
purchasing it to lose no time in obtaining order-forms (c). It would be a
lamentable thing if so important a work should fall through from lack of
adequate support. A. G. BuTEER.
QUESTION--CHINESE DWARF-THRUSH.

similar to a young Robin, but now they appear to be assuming the distinct
markings of a Thrush, and the reddish colour is turning to white.
- W. Nicholson.
The following answer has been sent to Mr. Nicholson :
The only imported Dwarf-Thrush that I know of is a N. American
bird ; however, that does not prevent my being able to tell you how to sex
your birds.
As the young have a spotted breast, I have no doubt that your birds
are true Thrushes, and all true Thrushes (including, of course, the Robins
Nightingales, and allied birds) differ in the males having narrower crowns,
much narrower and longer bills, and somewhat longer tails than the
females. In the Crows, on the other hand, although the males are larger
than the females, their crowns are broader, and their bills are shorter,
broader, and altogether more powerful. A. G. Butter.

Sir, --Some of your readers may be interested to know that, last
October a fine Osprey was seen here (Cobham, Surrey), and was, un-
fortunately, shot by our keeper, who " mistook it for a Heron." It is being
stuffed, to be presented to the Natural History Museum at Epsom. It
measured 21 in. in length and 66 in. from wing-tip to wing-tip.
Those of your readers who are interested in Albinos and rare-feathered
specimens, may be interested to hear that when I was in town, in the end of
October, I saw a lovely stuffed specimen of a pure white Curlew, at Messrs.
Rowland Ward's ; also that, in paying a visit to the Zoo, I saw a fine Albino
Cormorant in the Western Aviary; and that the keeper at the Parrot House
informed me that he had known a case of an almost pure white Vasa Parrot
(I can't remember whether he said it was a Lesser or a Greater Vasa); also
that, a few weeks ago, my brother and our keeper saw a curious looking
black bird in our grounds ; they described it as being about the size and
shape of a vSnipe without a tail; they saw it on more than one occasion,
but I have not had the good fortune to see it, and I don't think it has been
seen for some weeks now. I fancy it must be either a foreigner escaped
from somewhere, or a Melanoid specimen.
In the Crow's Cages at the Zoo, they have a beautiful White Jackdaw,
and amongst the Collection of British Water-birds in the Fish House, they
have a lovely White Peewit; I did not notice if the latter was a true Albino,
the light being bad when I saw it, but I noticed that its legs were much
more pinkish in colour than those of the ordinary Peewit.
I also saw a fine pair of Y r ellow Budgerigars in the Parrot House. It
would be interesting if the Society were to try the experiment of separating
them and pairing them with Greens, to try to produce the Blue variety,
which, as I have been informed by Mr. R. T. Babb, is sometimes the result
of such a cross. I have heard of Yellows being true Albinos, as far as the
colour of the eyes goes, but, as they were not in a very good light, I did
not see whether it was so in their case. The keeper told me, on a previous
visit, that he has known other cases of yellow freaks amongst Parrots, but,
unfortunately, I can't remember the name of the species in which thej^
occur.
Hoping that the above notes may prove of interest to your readers.

A NATURALIST'S NOTES IN ECUADOR.
By Walter Goodfeelow.
(Continued from page *]3).
In my article last month, I alluded to the Blue-shouldered
Tanager as an example of a bright-coloured member of that
family coming from a cool climate. I might have gone still
another thousand feet higher, and spoken of Darwin's Tanager
(T. darwini), for this bird is actually found in the gardens of
Quito, at an altitude of 10,000 ft. I don't say this is its per-
manent home, but I continuously met with it in the gardens of the
British Consulate there, especialty in the months of December
and January, when it came to feed on the seeds of various
flowering trees. Our Consul looked upon it as a great enemy,
always to be slaughtered without compassion. Its presence in
the garden was soon known from its beautiful clear call-note,
like a long drawn-out whistle on one note going up the
scale, and then the same let out again, descending. This
was always followed with a loud cry of " Uarichi," uttered
three times in succession. *'Uarichi" is the name they are
locally known by. This note is rather too loud to be agreeable.
I found out nothing that I can remember about the nesting
habits of this species, but no doubt they nest during the months
of November and December in the " quebradas " around Quito.
These " quebradas " are the huge earthquake rents, forming
quite valleys, and which intersect volcanic Ecuador from end to
end. Around Quito, the country is quite cut up by them, and in
these warmer spots, no doubt, this bird rears its family. It
seemed to me strange that all the birds whose nests I came
across, in, and around Quito, never I believe contained more
than two eggs. This was the case with the Black-winged
Siskin, and various Diglossi and Grallarias, etc. So no doubt
Darwin's Tanager conforms to what seems almost to be an
established rule in these high altitudes. I saw several of these

very handsome birds in captivity in Quito, and they seemed to
take readily to a seed diet, which was most probably varied by a
little fruit. The total length of the bird is 7 inches. The beak
is short, thick, and black, with some black feathers around the
base. The head and throat are pale blue, slightly mixed
with green, and which shades from the neck into olive-green on
the back. The entire under parts are a deep yellow, with an
olive-green shading on the breast, where the blue of the throat
leaves off. The rump is bright chrome-yellow, and the wings
and tail are black, with each feather rather broadly edged with
the same shade of blue as the head. I believe the female has
scarcely any blue on the head, and also lacks the yellow rump.
I regret that I have only the skin of a male with me to refer to,
for I am, unfortunately, writing this article away from home,
and it is, therefore, not so complete in detail as I should wish it
to be. This seems to me to be another of the Ecuadorian birds
well adapted for cage life, especially so, if one takes into con-
sideration its fine form and colouring, the temperate region it
comes from, and that it seems to do well on a seed diet. We
never met with this bird at a higher altitude than Quito.
Another still more beautiful, but considerably smaller,
Tanager, coming from the same part, is the Black - necked
Tanager, as it is called in the S. Kensington Museum (&amp;apos;Eziphonia
nigrico llis). It seems a mistake to call this little bird black-
necked, for the only real shade of black about it is 011 the throat,
cheeks, and at the base of the beak. The head and neck are a
clear bright blue, while the back, wings, and tail are a deep
violet black. The rump, breast, and underparts are all bright
yellow. The beak is very short, and the entire length of the
bird does not exceed 4^ inches. I never saw this bird actually
in Quito, although I have no doubt it is at times met with in the
gardens there ; but within twenty-minutes walk of the town I
saw it. I was told by residents there, that they had kept it in
captivity frequently, and for this reason I mention it here. I
am sure it would be an exceedingly nice bird to keep, with
such bright vivacious habits as it has. The female is quite
different from the male, and very little less beautiful. She is
entirely green, with the exception of the turquoise-blue on the
head and a shade of yellow on the forehead. These birds feed
on seeds, insects, and fruit.
A little lower down on the Western side, we secured one
specimen only of the rare Compsocoma notabilis. This is a very
close ally to the Blue-shouldered Tanager. The arrangement

of the colours is exactly the same, but of au altogether richer
and intenser hue, and it is also a little longer. Its stomach con-
tained nothing but berries of a hard (and what one would have
thought unnourishing) kind. Its lovely cinnamon-green back
has a gloss on it like rich satin, and which throws into high
relief the dull black head and neck with the patch of yellow on
the nape. The entire breast and underparts are orange yellow,
and the shoulders violet. The wings and tail black, edged with
bright violet.
Before we descend from the health}&amp;quot; highlands of Quito,
to the hot regions below, I must just mention, en passant ,
another beautiful member of the same family ---Iridornis dubusia.
The head, throat, and neck, in this bird, are dull black, with a
crown of reddish-gold feathers wdiich the bird can erect at
pleasure. The breast and back are violet and very shining.
The rump and the underparts indigo; the vent rufous; the wings
and tail black, and each feather edged with pale indigo-blue.
This beautiful Tanager we found on the West side of Pichincha,
at an altitude of 7,500 ft. I dont think it is confined solely to
that mountain, but it is confined to the Western side of the
Andes ; and on Pichincha was the only place we found it. I can
say very little about its habits, beyond that it seemed a solitary
bird, usually found singly, and nowhere common. Probably we
procured some five or six specimens altogether, during a period
of several months. It seemed to feed chiefly on berries.
Pichincha is a wonderful mountain for birds. It rises to
an altitude of 16,000 feet, and so just enters the snow line.
Its crater (still adtive) is said to be the deepest in the world,
2,000 feet and a mile or more across. On the Western side, the
forests reach up to 12,000 feet, but from Quito, up to the same
altitude on its Eastern side, the vegetation is much more stunted,
and composed chiefly of flowering bushes, to which vast
numbers of Humming Birds resort. After I have thoroughly
worked out our collection, it will be interesting to count exactly
how many species of birds we obtained from this one mountain.
Various ground birds were very numerous, and also other species
about which I may write later on. As one ascends higher,
the bushes get smaller and smaller until they abruptly cease
altogether, and one enters the bleak regions called the " paramo "
or wilderness. From thence up to the snow line, the mountain
is covered with a long, wiry grass, growing in thick clumps.
This is by no means devoid of bird life, for among the grass is
found a curious Partridge (.Nothoprocta curvirostris) an exceed-

ingly fine Snipe ( Gallinago jamessoni ) and also a Grouse (. Attajis
\0x25A0chimborcizensis), besides several small ground-loving birds, some
exceedingly interesting. All have sombre plumage, and they
struck us as having very mournful notes. When we were camp-
ing out up there, we found the melancholy cry of some of them
quite depressing in the freezing early mornings and evenings.
The note of one ( Pseudocalaptes boissoneanti ) which we heard
all over the highest regions of Ecuador, will always be
associated in our minds with snow and cold. These birds at
night sleep among the roots of the thick clumps of grass, and I
have often all but put my foot upon them. I spoke last month
of the little Black Humming Bird we met with there. We found
they built their nests under the ledges of the rocks, and during
the day they hovered over the grass, sipping the honey from the
small flowering plants, which grew sparsely about. On the
cliffs, many Hawks made their homes, and still higher, the
Condor also found a safe retreat, sleeping on ledges that were
actually a sheet of ice.
From the central highlands near Quito, are several mule
tracks passing over the Western ranges down to the forests
which uninterruptedly extend from there to the Pacific coast.
This would be a charming region for the naturalist to explore,
if it were only more healthy. We crossed over the bleak, windy
pass by the snows of Corazon, and the sudden transformation
to the rich vegetation clothing the mountain sides, was
most remarkable, and it gets more and more tropical as one
descends. Humming birds (some very beautiful ones) were
numerous in the higher parts, but at first I was rather dis-
appointed in the numbers of the other birds. The forests seemed
very silent, and birds scarce, but one had to take into considera-
tion the vast extent of their feeding ground. At that time we
were only passing straight through on our way to Santo
Domingo, and it was rather late in the day for many birds to be
about. I had expected to find them rather numerous along this
high edge of the forest. As we crossed ridge after ridge, and
descended deeper and deeper into the forest it was interesting to
note the range of the different birds. These forests are almost
uninhabited by anyone but Indians, and the traveller will only
come across a negro's, or Ecuadorian's hut, at perhaps the distance
of a day's ride between each ; and that only on the more beaten
trails.
Our first collecting place was Canzacota, a village of three
miserable huts on a beautiful forest-covered ridge at an altitude

of about 5,000 feet. Here we collected among other birds some
exquisite Tanagers, which would cause the aviculturist at home
to go wild with delight if he could but possess them alive ; and
beyond the difficulty of obtaining them, there is no reason why
many of them should not be easy to keep. Those of the genus
Callistc, I am convinced would be hardier than the Superb
Tanager from Brazil. Among the more important and con-
spicuous ones we obtained from this spot, were the rare C.
cyanopygia ; the Rufous-throated Tanager, C. rufigularis ; the
Spangled Tanager, C. nigriviridis ; the Black-eared Tanager, C.
lunigera ; Vassor's Tanager, Procnopis vassori ; and that beautiful
pink one, th &amp; Pyranga cestiva. Some of these are confined solely
to Ecuador, whilst others range into parts of Colombia also.
Vassor's Tanager, with the exception of the wings and tail which
are black, is a uniform shade of a lovely bright, but soft, blue,
with a satin-like gloss over all. This bird I am afraid would be
difficult perhaps to keep for it seemed to feed almost entirely on
insects, whereas the others eat largely of fruit. We found this
same bird, also at about the corresponding altitude, on the
Amazonian side of the Andes, and also the Spangled Tanager;
while the Black-eared is replaced by the Parzudake's Tanager.
This is decidedly one of the most beautiful of all the genus
Callistce. The mother-of-pearl like reflection on the whole of the
breast and back is truly remarkable. Beyond being larger than
the C. lunigera, the only difference is, that it has bright red
cheeks and forehead, and more golden yellow on the head and
neck. These rich looking birds went about in small groups of
three or four together, and like all the Callistce, seem ever on the
move, flitting from twig to twig, with the same little note
uttered by the Superb Tanager. I had thought of trying to give
an exadl description of some of these Tanagers, but on looking
at the skins before me now, I find myself wanting in words to
describe the wonderful shades of colouring. This is especially
difficult with the nigriviridis and the cyanopygia. This latter
bird is also replaced on the Amazonian side, at the same altitude,
at Baeza, by the Blue-necked Tanager, C. cyaneicollis. The
shoulders of this superb creature shine like highly burnished
gold, as they do also, but to a lesser extent in its prototype, the
cyanopygia. These birds are still more solitary in their habits
than Parzudake's and the Black-eared. It is a curious fact that
almost all the birds found at Canzacota, have their duplicates
(in many cases with only a slight change of colouring) in the
birds found at Baeza, on the far Eastern side. It is still more
marked in the Humming Birds. The blood red cock of the

Rock, is replaced at Baeza by the yellowish variety ; a few birds
however remain exactly tlie same on both sides. The pink
Tanager, Pyranga cestiva, is one of these. This bird, which is
close on yin. long, is of a brilliant carmine pink all over, but a
trifle darker on the head and back than on the other parts. The
wings are fawn edged with pink, but the tail is pink with only
a slight shade of fawn in it. This bird has a very wide range,
not only in Ecuador, but all through Colombia, Central America,
and I believe also into Texas. I never heard of it being found
at coast level in Ecuador, but while we were in Quito, we shot
one specimen in the Gardens of the British Consulate. Our
Consul there who is an ardent ornithologist, said it was the
third specimen only he had seen at that altitude during the 30
years he had lived there. The female is yellow in the same way
that the male is pink, so together the\r form a striking pair
of birds. I have noticed that if exposed to too much light, the
pink in the set-up skins, fades rapidly. Another exceedingly
beautiful Tanager we obtained at Baeza, and also on the Western
side, was Rieffer's Tanager, Psittospiza riefferi. This is a fairly
large bird, be,ing nearly Sin. in length. It is of a uniform bright
leaf green, except the first primaries, which are black, and the
vent rufous ; the same colour extends like a mask across the
face. The shoulders are an extraordinarily bright emerald green,
almost too bright to be pleasing. The legs are coral red, and the
beak which is slightly hooked, is of the same shade. We pro-
cured these from various localities and they were always in pairs.
The female is a trifle less brilliant than the male, when seen
together. They were always in fairl}^ high trees, and those we
shot at Baeza had been feeding entirely on juicy berries,
resembling elderberries. They had a curious call-note easy to
imitate, and if one was shot, it was easy to attract the fellow
one back to the spot by imitating this note. As may be
imagined, it was far from easy to distinguish them among the
foliage. The feathers have that same gloss on them which so
many of the Tanagers have. The beak and legs quickly fade
after death, and I noticed at S. Kensington they have not
attempted to artificially reproduce it, as they should have done,
because the contrast of the coral red beak and feet against the
green plumage, is one of the most conspicuous features of the
bird. Near Baeza we also obtained a pair of the wonderful
Orange-rumped GreenTanager ( Chloroch?ysa calliparcza). This
again is a bird whose colouring is too difficult to convey an idea
of in words, for it changes with every position you hold the bird
in. I am unable to give any particulars of their habits, beyond

that they seemed to like thick bushes, and kept out of sight as
much as possible. They are far from being common, and I
should like to have the chance of possessing such a pair of birds
alive. The female lacks the black throat of the male. She is
altogether of a dingy green, and the bright orange rump of the
male is only slightly yellowish in her, and the same with the
golden cheeks and the spot on the crown.
From the Western side we obtained many specimens of
the Golden Tanager (C. aurulenta). This is rather a common
bird at about 5,000 ft. That altitude seems to be its permanent
home, but it doubtless ranges a little lower and much higher,
according to the season. It is a truly fine bird, with its rich
golden plumage and jet black ears. I saw one in a cage in
Quito, kept by a gentleman who was the only Ecuadorian I met
who was really fond of birds. His specimen was in perfect
health and plumage, aud seemed very lively and tame. They
give one the impression that they would be tame birds. I under-
stood that this one had been in captivity for some considerable
time, and, if I remember rightly, it only had orange and banana
to eat.
Among the Tanagers we found at an altitude of from 1,500
to 2,000 ft., were the Rufous-headed Green Tanager ( C. gyroloides)
and the Red-naped Tanager (C. ruficervix), both showy birds.
In the former one, the back, wings, and tail are bright green ;
the rump, throat, aud breast, turquoise-blue with some green
reflections ; the head, rufous ; the collar and shoulders, golden.
This bird seems to range from the Isthmus of Panama down to
Bolivia: so it ought to be possible to procure specimens alive
from Colombia or Panama. It seemed to feed chiefly on fruit.
The predominating colour of the Red-naped Tanager is pale
blue, with deeper blue and violet about the head. The vent
is fawn, and the colour from which it takes its name is more of a
golden-fawn shade than red. This bird ranges from the North-
Western parts of Ecuador right up to the North of Colombia.
I now come to some of the Tanagers of the lowlands,
starting with the Silver-throated Tanager (C. icterocephcila ) from
Santo Domingo, and confined solely to Ecuador.
As I have several times referred to S. Domingo, and shall,
doubtless, have to do so again in the course of these articles, I
may here take the opportunity of saying it is not a town or a
village, but consists merely of two huts in a small clearing of
about eight to ten acres in the virgin forest, and is six days ride
over execrable trails from Quito. The forest formed one solid
</bodyText>

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.998267090909091" page_id="32637931"  page_num="96" year="" vol="">
even wall of vegetation all around the clearing, and, as soon as
one stepped beyond this border into the forest, it took some time
to get the e3^es used to the sudden gloom. I can recollect
nowhere else in S. America where the trees were such a height
as here, or the vegetation so thoroughly tropical-looking. In
this clearing was a small plantation of sugar-cane, and a large
plantation of bananas and a few other fruit trees. The rest of
the clearing was all grass, and a pretty stream wandered through
the centre, fringed with bamboos. It was a veritable paradise
for the naturalist. At no other spot in Ecuador did we find birds
in such numbers and varieties as here. In isolated huts in the
forest around, dwelt the Colorado Indians : so called because
they paint their bodies a uniform red from head to foot. One
day, one of them brought me a small packet of banana leaf,
neatly tide up with fibre, and, on opening it, I found it to con-
tain a live Silver-throated Tanager. It was in perfect condition
but for the primaries, which had been plucked from the wings.
Although the Indian told me he had only just caught it, it
seemed most confiding, and did not struggle in the hands in the
least. Some birds get tamer much more quickly in captivity
than others, and it was after finding this so tame, that I con-
cluded the Golden Tanager would be equally so, for they
greatly resemble one another in general appearance, and in size
the}^ are identical. I kept this bird during the two months of
our stay there. It took great delight in hopping about the room,
and made itself thoroughly at home at once. It bathed regular^
every day, and also sang a little with a gentle subdued voice,
chiefly in the early morning ; and when so engaged would
always sit on the bottom of the cage in one corner. I fed it on
bananas with an occasional cockroach, which it readily took from
the fingers. When bananas got over-ripe (which they quickly did
in that hot country) they attracted into the cage a great number
of very small flies, which the Tanager was very quick to catch.
I fully intended to take this bird back with me to Quito ; but one
day, when the cage was hung outside the hut, one of the bamboo
bars fell out of place, and so m3&amp;quot; Tanager escaped. I found it such
an attractive bird, always so contented, that I hope it may be my
lot some day to possess one of these birds alive in England,
where, if they were known, they would be great favourites.
This bird is just over 5 inches in length. The head is 3&amp;quot;ellow
with a greenish reflection about the nape. A black line starts
from the base of the beak and widens out over the ears. The
back is greenish yellow with a black line down the centre of each
feather ; the rump is veiy golden, and the throat a beautiful

bluish-silver, which extends in a narrow collar around the neck ;
the breast is yellow, with a greenish reflection on the flanks ;
the wings and tail are yellow, with a bright green edging to each
feather. The whole plumage is very shining, and the eyes black
and brilliant. We frequently shot these birds afterwards.
One day Mr. Hamilton discovered on one of the trees, a
large ripe bunch of bananas which was a perfedt " rendezvous "
for birds of many kinds. He would take his stand for a time, under
a neighbouring tree, and the number and variety of birds he got
on this one bunch, was astonishing. He resorted to it every
morning until the bunch was shot complete^ away, when we
replaced it by another. His bag for two mornings consisted of
two species of Toucans, Dusky Tanager, Pale-blue l&amp;apos;anager,
Blue Chatterer (. Procnias tersa), Silver-throated Tanager, two
species of Dacnis, a White-backed Woodpecker ( Melauerpas
pulcher), Red-headed Barbet ( Capito bouciri ), a Hang-nest and
Cassique ( Cassidix oryzivora). These wei&amp;apos;e the species, not the
numbers. On many occasions Mr. Hamilton brought in Wood-
peckers shot on this bunch ; they were all of the same kind.
The question is if they eat the fruit, or is it possible insects
might have been attracted to it, and it was these the Woodpeckers
came for? When shot, their beaks generally contained some of
the banana. At S. Domingo it was necessary to be up very early
to look for birds, for after about 10.30 there was scarcely a bird to
be seen about compared with the earlier hours. Again about
the close of the afternoon they reappeared.
At the headwaters of the Napo on the Amazonian side,
we first came across the Magpie Tanager ( Cissopsis leveria 7 ia).
This is not the species we see alive in England sometimes,-- C.
major . I thought it was till I got my skins home, when I found
mine was a much smaller bird. The total length of the leveriana is
just ioin., otherwise the two kinds seem to me identical. There
may be some other slight difference besides the size, for I have
not yet paid particular attention to them. " Dominicos " the
Ecuadorians call them from their black and white plumage.
We did not meet them on the Napo after where the Coca joins
it, but just at that place they were fairly numerous. I used to
observe them flying past our hut, every morning. At the edge
of the forest near by, grew a number of green bushes, and on
the very topmost leaves, the Magpies would alight. I never saw
them settle otherwise than on the very top. These bushes had
clusters of small hard buds 011 them, and it was these they came
to eat. We were there during May and June, and at first I

thought they had nests at that time, for they always kept in
pairs ; but on second thoughts, I hardty think they could have
been nesting then, for they were in heavy moult, and I remember
it was quite difficult to get one in good plumage ; so after getting
about three specimens we gave up shooting them. Many of them
had hardly a feather in their tails. I was so ill with fever during
almost the whole of our stay at this unhealthy place, that I could
not get out to pay as much attention to their habits as I should
have liked. The Indians used the skins of these birds largely in
their ornaments. I never saw them in the forests. I think they
always kept to the open parts. A very striking looking Tanager
we got at the same place was the Masked Tanager, R. nigrigularis.
It is the same size as the Scarlet Tanager, but a handsomer
bird. The crown of the head and neck are a most intense
scarlet, the feathers resembling scales. It has, what resembles a
black velvet mask over the lower part of the face and throat, just
reaching to above the eyes. The back and breast are scarlet,
but a patch of black extends from the vent half way up the breast,
going off into a point. The wings and tail are black, and there is
a baud of black across the shoulders. The beak is also black with
bluish grey at the sides of the lower mandible. The female
resembles the male, but the black, especially on the underparts,
is very brownish, and the scarlet not so intense. At the Coca
we only obtained one pair, killed together with a single shot;
but lower down the river at the Tiputini, for several evenings in
succession at sunset, a flock of at least thirty of these birds
alighted for a short time on the highest twigs of a small tree
near our hut. These were the only two places at which we saw
these birds on the river. At the Tiputini we also procured some
of the lovely Bolivian Turquoise Tanagers ( C . boliviano). These
birds were also shot always toward sunset, and close to the hut.
I don't see why they are called Turquoise Tanagers, for the blue
on them is decidedly a violet blue.
At Iquitos, on the Upper Amazon (and also on the Napo)
we obtained the indescribably beautiful Paradise Tanager (C.
yeni). Birds at Iquitos were conspicuous by their almost entire
absence. So I was surprised one day, when the old man who
fetched our washing, brought me one of those exquisite
creatures still warm and with a piece of string tied to its leg.
It appears he had stunned it with a blow pipe among the banana
trees in his little garden in the town. He had kept it alive for
some time, tied up with a bit of string, but I found it was
internally injured. I wanted him to procure me some alive, but

as we left the place a few days afterwards, I had no time to see
further about it.
This must end my remarks about the Tanagridce. I have
tried to make them as comprehensive, but concise as possible,
and I hope it may induce some of our Members to try and
obtain some of the species I have named and study them for
themselves.

THE LUNULATED HONEY-EATER.
fMelithreptus lunulatus).
By the Rev. C. D. Farrar.
Some time ago, I one morning received a letter from a
"birdy " friend, telling me that he was at Port Said with a big
consignment of foreign birds ; and that if I wanted any I was to
mark the list and return it at once to London, where it would
await his arrival. I gave a goodish order, and, amongst others,
I booked some Lunulated Honey-eaters. I had not the least
idea what they were like, whether big or small, pretty or plain ;
but I knew that they were rare. My friend assured me they had
never been imported into England before, and, so being like the
old Athenians, " always greedy of some new thing," I determined
to try my hand with Lunuated Honey-eaters.
After about a fortnight, I got word that the birds were in
the London Docks, and that I might expect them at any moment.
Excitement now ran high at Miclclefield, and when, one morning,
a porter was announced at the back door with a big box of " live
things," (this was the housemaid's way of putting it) I was not
long in opening the store cage to see what it contained. I soon
found the Honey-eaters. There were two pairs of them, and
they seemed in perfect health, and very good plumage consider-
ing the long voyage from Australia.
My friend told me that the} 7 had been fed on some soft
mixture on the voyage, but I was rather sceptical as to how long
they would have lived had it been continued.
I transferred them to a big cage to themselves, and put in
a bath. They at once took the hint with great apparent thank-
fulness, and were soon busy making their toilet, and seemed all
the better for it, as they were rather sticky after such a long
journey.
My next care was about food. I had never had a Honey-

eater before; but as they looked something like Zosterops, I
thought I would try them with " egg flake." They went for this
fairly well, but they did not keep very tight in feather. I then
tried bananas ; they appreciated these up to a certain point, but
still I knew that the food did not altogether suit them.
I then thought over their name--Honey-eaters ! but then
I had read such sad accounts of what honey did for birds, that I
hesitated to try it. However, I thought, it is "live and learn,"
and perhaps, after all, honey will not hurt them. Accordingly I
sent one of my children down to a cottage where the} 7 keep
bees, with a request for a jar of their best new honey. In
fear and trembling, I put a small jar into the cage, and it was
really laughable to see the way in which those poor little beggars
went for the sweet stuff. They were down almost before my
hands were out of the cage, as much as to say, " Why in the
world did not you think of this before! " From that day to this
they touch little else, so far as I can see. They have banana,
but it goes out untouched ; also egg, but it is despised. Honey
is the only food they care for. It is a pretty sight to see first one
and then the other settle on the honey jar, and insert their long
tongues in the savoury mess.
They are now in the most beautiful feather and perfect
health. They went all through the late bitter weather in a
perfectly cold room : where the water in their cage was frozen
into a solid block every night, but they did not appear to suffer
at all. I rather feared they would go off : as they are not very
thickly covered with feathers. We had 25 0 of frost !
They are wonderfully tame little things, and will let me
put my face quite close to them without moving. In shape they
are graceful, and about twice as big as a Zosterops.
The beak is yellow, tipped with horn-colour ; the eyes are
dark brown, encircled with a little yellow rim ; the legs and feet
lead-colour ; the head, back, wings, and tail a pretty soft sort of
olive-green ; the breast soft mouse-colour. Under the wing-
butts there is a patch of saffron, darker in the cock than the hen.
Each of the birds has, on the cheek, a half-moon crescent of
saffron-yellow---hence their name of " Eunulated."
Their call-note is peep, peep, peep ; repeated rather rapidly.
They are very fond of bathing.
In the summer, if all goes well, I intend to put the Honey-
eaters and a pair of Zosterops, out into a little garden-aviary,
and see if they will reproduce their kind.

THE GARDEN AVIARY IN WINTER.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995597147058823" page_id="32637936"  page_num="101" year="" vol="">
By Chas. R. Rothera.
It may seem somewhat previous to be writing about the
effects of the winter on the occupants of our garden aviary so
early as ioth January, for many times and oft wintery weather
has scarcely set in at that date. But the vagaries of our English
climate are so proverbial that one may justifiably hope and
certainly assume that, as the days are visibly lengthening and
the sun is already climbing up the hill again and gaining strength
and power by the effort, we shall not have any more bitter or
unpleasant weather than December brought us. It is not often
that 160 or iS* of frost are recorded and several inches of snow
fall and lie for a fortnight before Xmas day as was the case in
1899 ; and in addition to this we had a long cold thaw, dense fogs
for two or three days in succession more than once ; drenching
rains, gales of wind and heavy rime frost fixing its white
crystals so thickly upon the wire netting as to render it almost
solid and quite impossible to see through. Ret come what may,
the conditions during the next two months can hardly be more
unfavourable. And how have our pets fared through it ? The
only losses I have to record are two red-lieaded Gouldian Finches
(both cocks) which succumbed on the same day (5th January).
My caretaker had strict orders to keep a close watch on them and
to bring them in at once if he noticed any signs of distress, but
it was only on Thursday that one of them looked lumpy and
next day both died. They were well fed and in perfect plumage
and I imagine their death was due to lung affedtion. A hen
Japanese Robin has died, too, but I attribute this to the ill-
treatment to which an English cock Robin has subjected her and
which has secured for him his liberty again. I regret her loss,
for she has hatched three nests of young ones though she failed
to rear them for more than a few days. But she might have
done better next time.
Now, I consider this an extraordinary record for such a
season, considering the character of our collection. Ret me

and Virginian Nightingales, Chinese and Californian Quails, etc.
Not only have these passed through the ordeal safely, but the
smallest Waxbills and other allies have had no such help (as
some authorities consider essential) as a lamp during the long
dark nights to enable them to feed at about io p.m. No artificial
warmth whatever is used in their house place. All we do is to
protedt the small foreigners' section with canvas screens over the
open portion of the roof and to give them an additional supply of
gorse inside, and plenty of hay and feathers with which they
construct their own nests in the sheltered portions of their home.
My constant instructions to the caretaker are to see that the snug
corners are made snugger for the winter and that all branches
are removed which may tempt the birds to perch in the most
exposed positions.
Our birds all look well and are a never-ending attraction
to multitudes of our citizens. Perhaps the condition and
appearance of the Bulbul has surprised me most, for I have not
ventured to introduce one till last summer, believing them to be
delicate birds, and even now I am not of course justified in
speaking generally from the experience of only one specimen ;
but he is perfectly strong and healthy.
The Cow-bird too is a picture of loveliness, and the hen
Budgerigar has a nest full of eggs just recently laid.
In past years I have found March and April the most
dangerous months in the year -- for hen birds are so liable to
become egg-bound and die off before they are noticed.
AVICULTURAL HOTCHPOT.
By H. R. Filbmer.
The Bearded Reedling (commonly called the Bearded Tit,
though it is not a Tit) has always had a great charm for me, but
I must confess that I have not been successful in keeping it.
Past summer I had half-a-dozen--two I bought, and four were
given to me by Mr. Russell Humphrys--but I am sorry to say
that onty one now survives. They were all in more or less poor
condition when they came into my possession, most of them
being so bare of feathers that it was difficult to tell their sex.
Four died in the moult, but one pair came into fairly good
plumage and lived on, apparently in perfect health, until one day
in Januaiy, when I found the cock dead. No doubt he had a

fit--but why ? He was in excellent condition, neither fat nor
thin, and had never looked the least out of sorts.
It has often puzzled me that the Blackcap and the Garden
Warbler, which are apparently so closely allied, should differ so
greatly in their adaptability to confinement. Of small British
soft-food birds the Blackcap is undoubtedly the easiest to keep,
and if properly fed it will live for years in perfedt condition. But
the Garden Warbler is a very difficult bird to keep in anything
like good condition, and most examples speedily become shabby
and do not live long. Both species eat largely of fruit as well as
insects, and I should have thought that what would suit one
would suit the other---but this does not seem to be the case (a).
In December, a beautiful Purple-capped Dory of mine (#)
astonished me, more than a little, by laying an egg. Dories and
Dorikeets often make great preparations for nesting, but seldom
get so far as laying--at least that is my experience. The bird in
question is paired with a Ceram Dory, and the two are much
attached to each other. The egg was laid at the bottom of the
aviary, and when I found it I rigged up a nesting box and put
the egg inside. The Purple-cap sat for some weeks with fair
regularitjq but nothing came of it, and the egg disappeared. She
is now sitting again.
I had a provoking experience last year with , a pair of
Madagascar Dove Birds. The hen sat three times, always on
fertile eggs, and always with the greatest devotion, )&amp;apos;et all the
eggs were addled. Both the birds are in perfect health, and I
am at a loss for the reason for this failure.
I wonder that Peat Moss Bitter is not more used as a
covering for the floor of aviaries, For seed-eating birds there is
nothing so good as a mixture of sand and gravel, but although
that can be used for soft-food birds also, it will in their case be
found both troublesome and expensive, as its absorbent powers
are small, and it will require constant renewal. Sawdust answers
fairly well in some respects, and is very cheap--but I like Peat
Moss much better. If the bottom of the aviary be somewhat
thickly covered, it will be sufficient to rake it over once or twice
a week, and renew the moss about once in six weeks. (But the
time the Moss will last depends of course on the size of the
aviary, and the size and number of the birds). It is wonderful^
(a) I have not found the Garden Warbler at all difficult to keep in an aviary ; the
two I have had used to eat my regular soft-food mixture and a good deal of seed ; they
had a little fruit occasionally. -- A. G. B.

absorbent and deodorising, and when removed from the aviary
makes valuable manure for the garden.
A friend of mine has just told me an astonishing tale
about a murderous young cock Canary of his. This little wretch
was kept in a large cage with five brothers and sisters--all
being about the same age, and most of them nest-fellows of the
murderer. One by one he killed off the whole five--striking
each of them but one blow on the head, which produced almost
instant death. On careful examination, a tiny hole was found in
the skull of one of the victims, caused by the fratricidal beak ;
and it is supposed that the rest were similarly injured. The
story may seem difficult of belief, but I can vouch for the bona
/ides of my informant.
Last year, and again this year, the Crystal Palace Show
opened to the public at two o'clock on Friday. I do not know
how this new arrangement commends itself to exhibitors, but
personally I dislike it extremely. Formerly, Saturday of the
Costal Palace Show was the great annual re-union of avi-
culturists, and one was certain to meet one's friends there. Now,
some go on Friday and some on Saturday--the people who
especially wish to meet go on different days--and there is
disappointment.
May I be allowed to take this opportunity of suppliment-
ing my notes on "food" which appeared in the Magazine for
January? Spratt&amp;apos;s Game Meal is sold in two forms--one with
shell and one without. Unless otherwise ordered, that with
shell is supplied. The shell appears to be finely powdered
oyster shell, and is no doubt useful in the case of Pheasants, for
which the Game Meal is principally intended. But when used
as a food for insectivorous birds the shell may sometimes be
dangerous. Some time ago, I had two cases of haemorrhage
from the intestines, in my bird-room, which I attributed, rightly
or wrongly, to the use of meal containing shell. Since then I
have been careful to order it without shell. I always use less of
the Game Meal than of any of the three other ingredients in the
soft-food mixture I recommended. I find that, if too much be
added to the mixture, the other things are picked out and the
meal left. I am not sure whether the meal might not, with
advantage, be omitted altogether--though this would add to the
cost of the food, as the meal is the cheapest ingredient. The
value of crissel as a bird food is only just beginning to be
recognised--I am disposed to place it very high.

THE CR V STAL PALACE BIRD SHOW.
Some Notes by D. Seth-Smith
The recent exhibition at the Crystal Palace was certainly
not up to the average, either in the number or quality of the
exhibits ; at least, so far as foreign birds were concerned, and I
could only find one bird that was an absolute novelty, and of
which I cannot remember to have seen the like before at a show.
This bird perhaps the rarest in the exhibition, was a specimen
of Stictopterci annulosa , of which more hereafter.
The reason for this show being inferior to many of its
predecessors, was probably to be accounted for b\^ the fact that
the weather was exceptionally severe, and several would-be
exhibitors who had entered specimens, at the last moment wisely
decided to keep their birds at home.
Amongst the Weavers and Whydahs, the most note-
worthy exhibits were two Crimson-banded Whydahs (. Penthetria
ardens ). In the class for Waxbills, there was a nice hen Pytelia
afrci, several Rufous-tailed finches (JBathilda ruficauda) and a
pair of the charming, though not altogether trustworthy,
Crimson Finches {Neochmia phaeton).
There was a fine pair of Tri-coloured Parrot-finches and
three specimens of the ordinary Parrot-finch, a good Pintail
Nonpareil, and several Gouldian-finches, one pair of which
were remarkably fine birds. The long-tailed Grassfinch
(.Poephila acuticaudo ) is a bud that appears to be becoming a
great favourite with aviculturists, and indeed, it well deserves to
be, as it is a most delightful and beautiful species, and one,
moreover, that freely reproduces its kind in captivity. Several
pairs were exhibited and I imagine most were aviary-bred. One
pair of Masked Grassfinches (P. personated) were shewn, but
there was not a single specimen of the closely allied White-
eared finch (JP. leucotis). The latter appears to be comparatively
hardy, but I think the Masked must be considered one of the
most fragile of the Grassfinches, at least, I have found it so.
Some nice examples of the Double-banded or Bicheno's
finch ( Stictoptera bichenovii) were well worth notice, and the
closely allied Black-rumped finch (S. annulosa ) shewn by Mr. L,.
W. Hawkins was, so far as I am aware, the first specimen of this
species that has been exhibited in this country; but it so closely
resembles A. bichenovii , that it is quite possible that it may have
passed as such on former occasions. Another bird of much

interest, was the hybrid Bieheno-Zebra-finch which has been
mentioned in a former number of this Magazine.
There was one pair of the minute Cuba finch ( Phonipara
canora ) but the hen looked decidedly out of condition.
In the class for "all species of Grosbeaks, True Finches
and Buntings," there were one or two interesting birds ; the one
that attracted most attention being an example of the Japanese
Bunting ( Emberiza rutila). A large number of these birds were
received by a London dealer in the Summer of 1899 ; and
apparently nearly all were cocks. I obtained two, and found
them somewhat spiteful towards other birds, and very timid, and
altogether not particularly attractive.
Some specimens of the Blue Grosbeak ( Guiraca ccerulea)
were also shown here.
Amongst the Tanagers there was a very handsome species
catalogued as a Blue-headed Tanager, and there was a
brownish bird in the same class which appeared to be a female
of the same species. Two Blue and Black, several Superb, a
Scarlet and a Black Tanager were also worthy of note, and
there were, in the same class, a couple of the Australian
Grey-backed Zosterops (Z. caerulesceus).
The class for Doves and Quails was poorly filled, and
contained only three Nicobar pigeons ( Calcenas nicobarica), a
Bronze-wing l Phaps chalcoptcraj , a pair of Crested Doves
f Ocyphaps lophotesj, and a pair of Chinese Quails (Excalf act otia
chinensis ).
In the Parrakeet class, the best bird was the Alexandra
Parrakeet fPolytelis alexandrce) ; a Pileated Parrakeet ( Porphyro-
cephalus spurius), and a hen Golden-shouldered Parrakeet
(.Psephotus chrysopterygius ) were also of great interest. These
three species are all very rare, but these same examples have
been seen so often before at the Palace that one is apt to forget
how uncommon they are.
Amongst the Lories and Lorikeets, I noticed a very fine
Ceram Lory (. Lorius garrulus), a good Torsten's Lorikeet
( Trichoglossus forsteni), and a Scaly-breasted Lorikeet (Psitteutcles
chlorolepidotus).
Amongst the Parrots, the most noteworthy exhibits were,
a Yellow-naped Amazon ( Chrysotis aiwopalliatci), a Mealy
Amazon (C. inornata&amp;apos;), a grand Hawk-headed Parrot (JDeroptyus

accipitrinus), and a Lesser Vasa Parrot ( Coracopsis nigra). Two
Macaws were shown, a Hyacinthine ( Anodorhynchus hyacinihinus),
and a Red and Blue (Ara macao).
In the class for all species not included elsewhere, were a
few most interesting and rare specimens, the best of all being a
fine Regent-bird ( Sericulus melinus), in full colour. Some of us
saw this bird at Balham last November, but I doubt if the species
has before been exhibited at the Palace. A good Barbet was
also shown here, and a fine pair of Wood Swallows (. Artamus
sordidus).
Amongst the British birds I found nothing of exceptional
interest until I arrived at the "curiosity" class. Here I found
a truly remarkable bird---a Bullfinch, described in the catalogue
as " half cock and half hen," and this description certainly
was not a bad one, for on one side it had the plumage of a cock,
and on the other that of a hen. I have never before heard of a
case of hermaphroditism in small birds, and I think this must be
a great rarity. Another interesting freak was an Albino Hedge
Accentor, and a beautiful Silver-grey variety of the Starling
was well worth notice.
In the class for insectivorous residents, were, amongst
others, two very healthy Tree-creepers, a good Nuthatch, an
unusually fine Stouechat and two Long-tailed Tits. There was
also a very fine specimen of the Greater Spotted Woodpecker.
In the Migratory Section, there were one or two very fine
Redwings, some good Nightingales, Blackcaps, Wrynecks and
Redstarts, not to mention several common species, and one bird
that should have been elsewhere, namely a Crested Titmouse.
This species is now very rare in the British Isles, being found
only in a few of the pine forests in Scotland, and, where it occurs,
it is a resident species. It is hardly likely^ that the specimen
exhibited at the Palace was a British example.
The last class I have to mention, was that composed of
Continental birds. This class is usually a most interesting one,
but, on this occasion it was very poorly filled. The most
interesting bird was a fine Hoopoe. A Blue Rock-thrush, a
Rose-coloured Starling, and an Ortolan, were the only other
birds shown in the class.

By J. Lewis Bonhote.
Owing to having been away from England it is three years
since I last wrote on these classes, and I was consequently rather
anxious to see whether, during that time, any improvement had
taken place in either the management of the Show or the judging,
and to a certain extent I was agreeably surprised, the classification
and division of the classes is carried on in a far more reasonable
manner, with the result that judging is easier and the number of
birds wrong-classed considerably smaller. The same pecularities
(see Avi. Mag. II. p. 65, and III p. 84) or other similar ones,
enabled the cages of certain exhibitors to be picked out what-
ever class they might be in and this will always be possible, and
to some extent unavoidable as long as exhibitors are not bound
down to have cages of certain fixed sizes and shapes. Another
point which is, I think, not recognized is that Shows of wild
birds (British and Foreign) must of necessity be judged on quite
different lines from other exhibits, and that a Show of wild
birds should be rather an exhibition of wild birds enjoying an
existence of confinement than long series of Bullfinches, Gold-
finches and such birds judged b} r an imaginary ideal created in
the judge's brain and probably bearing but little resemblance to
the wild bird which one sees in a country ramble.
With Canaries, Pigeons and Fowls, etc., the case is quite
different; there the Club of any particular variety draws up its
standard b}^ which the birds are judged and the prize is awarded
to the fancier who most nearly succeeds in breeding his bird like
the ideal; but in wild birds there is no fixed ideal, each judge
forming his own, and it becomes a mere matter of chance
whether you are the possessor of a bird approaching the judge's
ideal. In my opinion, however, prizes in the Wild Bird classes
should be given almost entirely for the keeping in good condition
of rare species, or of species difficult to manage in confinement,
so that where, in the one case a man gets the prize for making the
law 7 s of natural selection subservient to his own, on the other
hand he would get it for imitating Nature's food and surround-
ings so satisfactorily as to enable birds to live and enjoy confine-
ment ; a pleasure to themselves and their keepers. I11 this
respect, and in this respect only, are Shows connected with
the study of aviculture, and consequently year by year the
Crystal Palace Show is noticed in these columns.

Let us now turn to the birds.
Class 88 (Bullfinches) was a very strong class and well
judged, we were pleased to notice a nice hen, 3rd, and several
foreigners ignored, while the 1st prize bird was beautiful in
colour and shape.
Class S9 (Goldfinches) was another very large class, and
the birds throughout of very fine quality ; as usual some small
foreigners were shown, but as the differences between a small
foreigner and a large Britisher are practically nil, these mistakes
must of necessity occur.
Class 90 (Chaffinches) were only a fair lot. Mr. Fulljames'
(ex. 1 st) was in our opinion far too dark, and the remainder for
the most part wild and fresh caught.
Class 91 (Linnets) must have taxed the judge's powers
considerably, there being but little to choose between any of the
exhibits.
Class 92 (Lesser Redpole and Twite) was a very good
class, and the Lesser Redpole has at last got a look in. 1st prize
went to a very fine Twite and about as large as any I have seen.
Class 93 (Siskin) was spoilt, as usual, to our taste by the
numerous colour-fed monstrosities. 1283 (unnoticed) was in my
opinion the best.
Class 94 (A. O. V. Finch or Bunting Resident) brought
forward some nice specimens of Hawfinches, Greenfinches and
a Yellow Bunting. 1st was taken by a Yellow Bunting; 2nd,
Hawfinch, a very fine bird ; 3rd by a Greenfinch. Several of
the Greenfinches appeared to me to be colour-fed, but perhaps
I am wrong; this class also included a Cirl Bunting, Tree
Sparrow and a ver}&amp;apos; wild Reed Bunting.
Class 95 (Lark or Pipit) a small but good class. 1st went
to a Lark, badly shewn and as far as we could see nothing to
recommend it; 2nd was a very nice Wood Lark in grand trim ;
3rd, a nice Meadow Pipit which would have shown off to greater
advantage in a cage without perches. The class also included a
very fair Rock Pipit which only got a card.
Class 96 (Robins) a very small and bad class, none of them

birds were young. 1556, 4th, being undoubtedly the best in this
class.
Class 100 (Magpie, Jackdaw, Jay, Chough or Raven)
where is the Rook or Crow to go ? A fair class. 1st went to a
fine Chough ; 2nd to a nice Magpie, and 3rd to a splendid Jay
which ought almost to have been first.
Class 101 (Pied and Albino) would have been a very weak
one but for the 1st prize bird, a Bullfinch, with one-half of its
body like a cock and the other half a hen, we have heard of
such things among butterflies but never among birds, and should
be curious to hear further particulars. The only other bird
worth noticing was a white Hedge Sparrow.
Class 102 (A. O. V. Resident Insectivorous, small) the
judge's usual stumbling block and over he goes. The Stone-
Chat is a resident bird, Mr. Hills, and a common one too, I
think I have noticed that fact before in these columns, however
judges will learn in time. This class contained two Tree
Creepers, two Tong-tailed Tits, two Nuthatches, Grey Wagtail,
etc. I am glad to see that this last named is 3rd in his proper
class at last; matters are improving, but slowly.
Class 103 (A. O. V. Resident Insectivorous, large) a very
small class containing a Woodpecker in good trim and some nice
Missel Thrushes.
Class 104 (Blackcap or Nightingale) was a very small
class, and the birds were of only moderate quality.
Class 105 (A. O. V. Insectivorous Migratory) contained
several splendid birds. 1st and special was a very fine Wryneck ;
two nice Redstarts, several Redwings, a Yellow Wagtail, Whin-
chat, Whitethroat, and a nice Crested Tit completed the class-
Class 106 (Bramblefinch) which we were glad to see in a
class by themselves, contained many splendid specimens.
Class 107 (A. O. V. Seed-eating Migratory) contained
several Snow Buntings, Serins, and 1st a very fine Tapland
Bunting.
Class 10S (A. O. V. Continental Bird) was made up with a
Rose-coloured Pastor, Blue Thrush, Hoopoe, and Ortolan
Bunting, none of them in very fine condition.
The management is to be congratulated on its liberal
classification which it is hoped may encourage exhibitors to fill
up the classes rather better next year.

PARROTS AT THE CRYSTAL PALACE.

By the Hon. and Rev. F. G. Dutton.
I suppose it would not be very easy to get up a really
good Show of Foreign Birds at any time, but when the most
inclement week of the most inclement month of the year is
chosen, and, in addition, the first of altogether insignificant
prizes is withheld, unless there are a certain number of entries,
then no condition which would ensure failure has been forgotten.
Were it not for one or two public-spirited exhibitors who live
near the Palace, the show of Parrots would not be worth the
trouble of going even from London to see.
These conditions operate more heavily against the Parrots,
because they are more valuable, are very often pets, and are more
expensive as to carriage.
Yet Budgerigars, which come first in the Parrot classes,
might be more numerous : for they are hardy, and are bred with
greater ease than Canaries. Here a decent prize list might
produce a good entry. Eleven entries cannot fairly represent
the numbers that must be bred annually in England. The third-
prize pair was the only entry calling for any especial remark.
These were good in colour and distinct in marking. What was
the secret of the wonderful colour Messrs. Mackley attained
some years ago in the Budgerigars they exhibited ? I have
never again seen such intense green as that. What are called
Yellow Budgerigars ought not to be mentioned unless they have
a class to themselves ; they aie quite out of place in a class for
ordinary Budgerigars.
It is curious that no Rosellas were exhibited. There were
two pairs of large Pennants, and one Mealy Rosella. The
Pennants were fine but rather lacked lustre.
The class for Kings and Crimson-wings had three speci-
mens : two Crimson-wings--of which Mr. Smith's specimen was
the most brilliant--and a Queen.
The next class, for single Parrakeets, brought together an
interesting variety. Mr. Fulljames took ist with his Alexandra
Parrakeet, and I presume Mrs. Astrop took 2nd with her Pileated
Parrakeet, which ought to have had equal ist. Mr. Fulljames'
bird is a marvel of successful aviculture, but the Pileated
Parrakeet is as rare and quite as faultlessly shown.
The other birds were a good Rock Parrakeet; a cock Red-

rump, which looked rather mopy ; a neat golden-shoulder hen ;
a very brightly-coloured Bengal, shown by Mr. Babb ; and an
Orange-flank of Mr. Swaysland's. I have no notes of Mr.
Dawson's Indian Parrakeet, and cannot recall if it was there.
"Pairs of Parrakeets " consisted of a pair of INIendays,
shown by Mr. P&amp;apos;ulljames ; and, what I was inclined to think was
a cock Palceornis cyayiocephahis and a hen P. rosa , shown by Mr.
Smith.
In the class for Lories and Lorikeets there were five
entries : a pair of Blue Mountains, a Ceram, a Crimson Lory, a
Forsten's, and a Scaly-breast. The Scaly-breast took ist, but
the Forsten's ought to have had equal ist : its condition was
perfedt.
The Love-birds consisted of three cages of Peach-faced.
In the class for Amazons and Greys, ist went to a good
Gold-nape, but the Inornata next it, which took 3rd, was better
shown. Second went to a good Grey of the light type. Mrs.
Newmarch showed a very large Double-fronted, but it might
have been cleaner. Mr. Cooper showed a nice little Albifrons.
Mr. Billett showed a variegated Blue-fronted, which was sold ; it
seemed a fairly free talker, but it was very rough.
The Cockatoos and Macaws call for no special comment.
Mr. Fulljames showed his Hyacinthine Macaw, but it was beaten
by Mr. Smith's Ara Macaw, which was very well shown.
In the last class for Parrots, Mr. Maxwell sent a rather
fascinating Hawk-head, which took the prize ; Mr. Roberts a
Vasa; and Mr. Fulljames a pair of----? I told him Conures,
but I could not identify them amongst the Conures at the
Natural History Museum. There was also in this class a
variegated Blue-fronted Amazon--which of course was marked

Winter is not a good time at the Zoo : the arrivals are,
compared with the Summer months, few in number, and a great
majority made up of our larger English Wildfowl.
This month, although Wildfowl (with the exception of
the Whoopers and Woodcock) are not represented, the additions
are composed of what may be called from an aviculturist's point
of view, ' the poor and middle-class ' style of bird, and include
no striking or rare species. I wonder if many members have
kept the Burrowing Owl : if not, I can thorough^ recommend
it as a most interesting aviary bird. They are a small bird
about nine inches in length, and their chief peculiarity is the
length of the tarsus, which is considerably longer in proportion
to the size of the bird than in other species of Owl. It is an
inhabitant of America, where it is found from the prairies of the
North throughout the whole of Central and South America. As
its name indicates, it lives in burrows, which it rarely hollows
out for itself but takes one already made by marmots or the
ground squirrels ( Spermophihis ) and alters it to suit its own
purpose. It is large^ diurnal in its habits, which renders it
especially suitable to an aviary existence. In their aviary a
burrow should be made for them, and a small mound erected
just outside the entrance, on which they will be very fond of
sitting, darting into their burrow when alarmed, only to poke
their heads out the next minute and gaze at the intruder.
Except for shelter and when nesting, they do not spend much
time in the burrow, but sleep on a perch like other Owls. The
late Mr. Meinertzhagen bred them successfully in his aviary,
where they made a long burrow reaching into the adjoining
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.973988341463415" page_id="32637949"  page_num="114" year="" vol="">
aviary : so that perhaps it would be as well to sink wire netting
round their cage, in order to prevent their possible escape. At
the Zoo they are kept in a large cage, in which several drain
pipes are laid in a heap of sand, which affords them plenty of
amusement, although of course useless if breeding is the object,
as the sand falls down as fast as they dig.
There is comparatively little else to write about this
mouth ; in cold and stormy weather birds are never seen at their
best, nor is the Zoo a very comfortable place for the onlooker.
The Uvaean Parrakeet, to which I called attention some months
back, has joined the majority. By the way, for those interested
in this bird, there is a short notice in Vol III. p. 130, from the
pens of the Hon. and Rev. F. G. Dutton and Mr. Phillipps.
The Bee-eater is still alive, but looks rather miserable in
a Parrot cage. I11 England we don't understand the keeping of
such birds as they do abroad, where I have seen Bee-eaters,
Rollers, and Nightjars in good plumage and looking just as
healthy as in a state of nature.
At one of the Zoological Gardens abroad--I think Berlin,
but will not be quite certain--they have recently built a large
house solely devoted to the birds of the country, which promises
to be a great success ; I will, however, refer to it more fully next
month. At Hamburg they have also a house devoted to native
birds, and our Gardens might well take a leaf out of their book,
for I feel sure our native birds would be more appreciated were
they better known, and if it were shown that they could be
accustomed to a life of confinement as well as foreign species(c).
The Fish House is worth a visit to see a fine albino
Lapwing, which is of a pure white all over, except the under-tail
coverts, which are light chestnut ; the eyes are of normal
colour, but the legs have assumed the pink colour characteristic
of albinos.
CORRESPONDENCE.
DR. KARL RUSS' WRITINGS.
Sir, -- A mong the important works of the late Dr. Russ is one, not
alluded to by our mutual friend Mr. August Wiener, which (as it is the
latest, most up-to-date, and probably the least known of all his books)
should, I think, be called attention to.
After many years of study, this book seems to have been completed
( c ). I saw such a house at Frankfort-on-the-Maine in 1897; the birds were, however, too
closely caged.--O. E. C.

in 1898, but it was not published until 1S99 : the title of " Soft-food Eaters "
is a modest one, for it practically includes all cage-birds not already treated
of in his works on the Parrots and Finches : indeed part of the work on
Finches--the Tanagers--is more thoroughly dealt with in this later work.
The German title of this--the fourth illustrated volume of the " Fremd-
landisclien Stubenvogel "--is " Die fremdlandischeu Weiclifutterfresser "
(Insekten-oder Kerbthierfresser, auch Wurmvogel genanut, Frucht-oder
Berenfresser und Fleisclifresser), mit Anliang Tauben und Hiihnervogel,"
with ten chromo-lithographic plates.
In his Introduction Dr. Russ commences with the following remark :
" With this Volume II. the entire great work 'The Foreign Cage-birds ' in
four volumes, the principal work of my life, is completed." Strange, that
the author should live so short a time after its completion ! Yet, how
many of us at the end of our span will be able to rejoice that we have
successfully finished all that we hoped to do ? A. G. Butler.

Sir, --The bird sent by me to the recent Balliam Show as a Red-faced
Finch appears to have attracted much attention. I11 every report the name
has been questioned ; one reporter going so far as to say, "described as a
Red-faced Finch, but certainly not so." I have always taken it to be a
specimen of the Red-faced Finch, Pytelia afra, which is, of course, quite
distinct from the other Red-faced Finch, Pytelia melba.
As pointed out in the Magazine last August, there is some confusion
between the two species, owing, no doubt, to the great rarity of both. Verv
marked differences, however, exist between them. For instance, the red
on the face differs in position, extending farther downwards in melba, and
much farther backwards in afra ; the under-tail coverts of melba are quite
white, while in afra they are striped ; then the general appearance of melba
is much brighter, and the transverse markings on the breast are much
more clearly defined than they are with afra.
The bird in question is the hen of a pair received nearly two years
ago. At that time they answered to the description of Pytelia afra in Dr.
Butler's " Foreign Finches." The male, however, had not obtained its full
red face, only a few spots being visible. When moulting, several feathers
in the wings and tails of both birds were replaced by others, white and
yellow in colour, and the surviving hen has also recently grown whitish
feathers on the head--hence the peculiar appearance which has made it a
puzzle. A pair of Pytelia melba, living under the same conditions, moulted
true to their original colour.

I cannot regard the bird as very abnormal, for it is evident that a
third specimen exists in England having a similar appearance. The owner
of this third specimen brought over his bird from Madeira, and had no
idea of its name and species. In October of this year he was at the Crystal
Palace, and, seeing my specimen there, recognized it as the same species as
his own. He then wrote to me as follows : -- &amp;quot;I should be much obliged
if you can tell me the name of the bird exhibited by you in Class 118 at the
Crystal Palace Show last Tuesday. The Number of the bird was 3, audit
was named Red-faced, hen. Is it a Waxbill, Mannikin, or Combassou, and
are they rare birds ? What part of the world do they come from, and are
the}&amp;apos; quite hardy ? I should like to know what price you are asking, if you
wish to sell the bird. I have had a male bird of the same kind for some
time, which I got out in Madeira, but they gave him a Portuguese name, and
I have never been able to find another like him until I saw your hen the
other day. The one I have is the only one I was able to procure when in
Madeira. He is a very friendly little bird, very tame, and a great favourite."
I endeavoured to purchase this gentleman's specimen, but he would
not be pursuaded to part with it. L. W. Hawkins.

THE SACRED KINGFISHER.
(Halcyon sanctaj.
By D. Seth-Smith, F.Z.S.
The numerous family of Kingfishers (. Alcedinidcs ) has been
divided by Dr. Sharpe into two well-defined sub-families, namely,
the fish-eating, or typical Kingfishers ( Alcedinince ) and the
insedt- or reptile-eating group {Dacelonince ), each comprising
several genera.
The genus Alcedo, of which our common European
species ( A. ispida ) is the best known example, belongs to the
first of these groups, and the genus Halcyon , of which the
subjedt of this paper is a well-known species, belongs to the
second sub-family--the land-feeders.
Although very rarely brought alive to Europe, the Sacred
Kingfisher is not at all uncommon in a wild state in Australia,
where it appears to be almost equally distributed over the whole
of the mainland, although, curiously enough, it is not found in
Tasmania. Gould obtained specimens from nearly every part
of Australia, and found that those from Port Essington, on
the North, were identical with those of the South Coast;
whereas, those inhabiting Western Australia were found to be
slightly larger than the others. Although several of the land-
feeding Kingfishers undoubtedly occasionally resort to streams
and capture fish, Halcyon sancta appears never to adopt this
mode of feeding. " It seems," writes Browinowski, "somewhat
of a misnomer to call this bird a Kingfisher, since it not only
does not plunge into the water to capture fish, but is even found
in dry and arid places where it cannot obtain water, from which
it would appear that it can exist without drinking." I have had
two of these birds in my aviary for nearly a year, and I can
never remember to have seen either of them drink ; but they are
by no means averse to a bath occasionally, when they simply
saturate their plumage and take a long time in drying it again.

This species feeds, when at liberty, upon mantides, grass-
hoppers, beetles, small lizards, and such like ; and some speci-
mens, that were shot by Gould in the neighbourhood of the salt
marshes, had their stomachs crammed with small crabs and
other crustaceans.
In captivity I have not found these birds difficult to keep,
in fact they seem to be as easily dealt with as the larger and
better known Dacelo gigantea, the celebrated " Laughing Jackass."
A diet of raw meat, preferably beef, chopped into small pieces,
suites the Sacred Kingfisher well, if it be now and then supple-
mented by a few mealworms, cockroaches, or other insects. I
have seen my birds catch and devour minute frogs ; and any
earthworm that may shew itself is immediately captured. I have
little doubt that newly-hatched birds would prove a sore temta-
tion to them ; but they seem perfectly harmless towards adult
birds however small, in fact I have kept the tiny Zebra Waxbills
in the same aviary with the Kingfishers, which never interfered
with them.
This Kingfisher almost invariably beats its food against
the perch before swallowing it, as if to kill it, even although it
consist merely of a piece of beef: and after a meal of tough
skinned creatures, such as cockroaches, it always throws up the
indigestable parts in the form of pellets.
I have found these birds a very interesting addition to my
collection : they are so very different to every other species that
I have kept, both in habits and appearance. Their flight is very
rapid, and it is interesting to watch one of them, after sitting
perfectly motionless for some time, dart from its perch and seize
an insect from amongst the grass and return, without apparently
touching the ground, to the place from whence it came.
Last summer one of these birds dashed out of the aviary
one afternoon as I entered, and was lost to sight amongst the
trees. I greatly feared I should see it no more, but after a care-
ful search I discovered it high up in a maple tree, enjoying itself
immensely in capturing small green insects. I climbed the tree
and endeavoured to coax it with a mealworm, but, although it
would always allow me to handle it in the aviary, it would not
let itself be caught when at liberty, but as my hand was almost
upon it, went off as though it meant to fly right away. Curiously
enough, however, when it had flown some sixty or eighty yards,
it turned and came back to the tree from which it had flown.
Again I tried to entice it with a mealworm--a dainty loved above
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.996083921052632" page_id="32637954"  page_num="119" year="" vol="">
all others--but all in vain. This sort of thing went on for some
time, and I expected each minute to see it fly right away ; but
somehow it seemed afraid to venture beyond the garden bound-
ary. Fortunately I knew its great fondness for mealworms, and
in them lay my only hope of securing the truant. It's mate was
caged and carried to the foot of the tree on which the escaped
bird calmly sat ; and a handful of mealworms was thrown on the
ground close by, and several were given to the bird inside.
From aloft, the truant cast jealous glances at his mate, who was
having a good square meal ; and the temptation to join in the
repast quite overcame him. With a swoop he landed upon the
frame of the net I held in my hand, where he sat for some time,
apparently conscious that I was powerless to envelope him in its
folds while he remained in this position. But I waited patiently
and my patience was rewarded. With another swoop he seized a
mealworm, and my net was upon him before he could rise from
the ground.
The ordinary note of this species is peculiar and some-
what difficult to describe, sounding something like cuio, cnio, but
it not infrequent^ utters a note resembling chip, chip, like a
Crossbill, but decidedly louder. This is probably the note that
Gould describes as pee, pee.
The upper parts of this species appear green in some
lights and deep blue in others, but the back is decidedly greener
than the wings or tail, which in most lights appear deep blue.
A line of greenish-black runs from the base of the bill through
the eye to the back of the head. The throat is white. A line
from the nostrils over the eye, all the underparts, and a band
encircling the neck are buff, most of the feathers being, in the
immature birds, margined with black.
The sexes are alike in plumage, but the male is probably
slightly the larger bird of the two.
" The season of nidification commences in October and
lasts until December, the hollow spouts of the gum- and boles
of the apple-trees (Angophortz) being generally selected as a
receptacle for the eggs, which are four or five in number, of a
pinky-white, one inch and a line in length and ten lines in
\0x25A0diameter." (Gould). *

(Continued from page ggj.
There is something particularly exciting to the naturalist
when he first plunges into a tropical forest, neither have I found
this feeling to wear off by repetition. Though it is by no means
in the forests only, that one finds a greater abundance of animal
life than elsewhere ; but still one is always expecting something,
aud the strange note of a bird unseen excites more curiosity
there than it might do under other circumstances. We used to
feel this especially after travelling for weeks among the cold,
barren Andes of Ecuador, where we were continuously at great
elevations, and to a somewhat lesser extent in Colombia where
the altitudes were not so high, and, therefore, the changes not so
striking. With what satisfaction we dipped down into deep
warm forest-covered valleys; where everything was full of the
exuberance of tropical life! Fresh flowers, fresh birds and
butterflies, and fresh sounds on every hand. One longed to
possess more eyes to take it all in. We would then throw aside
our warm "ponchos" which only a few hours before we had
found barely sufficient to keep out the cold winds, when after a
short, rapid, and steep descent, we were in a new region. These
valleys, so cut off from one another, are quite a feature of the
Andes, and especially of the southern parts of Colombia, and
present many interesting local forms in their ornithology. In
these restricted areas, animal life is of course much more con-
centrated, and therefore appears much more abundant than in
the interminable forests of the Pacific coast, and of the
Amazonian region. There, one can go on for a whole day
without hearing the sound of a bird, or the chirp even of an
insect. I have never found any forests so silent and gloomy as
those leading down from the Eastern Andes to the headwaters
of the Napo ; for days we would not hear the voice of a bird
beyond occasionally the lovely song of the " flautero." I never
saw this bird, and don't know to what species it belongs. It
seems difficult to believe it to be a small bird, but I was assured
it was by our Indian carriers. It is wonderful for such notes to
come from the throat of a bird ; even our wild-looking Indians
always seemed impressed by it, and would halt for a minute to
listen to the song.
Perhaps the period of the year had something to do with
the paucity of bird life on the higher Eastern side at the time of

our visit, for the fruit-eating birds migrate with the seasons to a
higher or lower altitude as the forest fruits ripen. On the
Pacific side we found a much greater abundance of birds, and
our necks would ache from constantly gazing into the high
trees. Especially in the lower forests, going down to Santo
Domingo, we found our progress quite slow from our frequent
deviations from the trail to shoot, or perhaps to gaze at, some
beautiful bird we had hitherto only known by skins at home, or
to discover the owner of some strange and probably harsh note
of alarm. Then a deer would start up and bound along the
path, and lead us off on a futile chase until we had almost com-
pletely lost ourselves ; and again we would follow for a hundred
yards or more the fresh foot prints of a jaguar which had only
recently passed along the same way as ourselves.
When I commenced to write my February article, I
intended it to be exclusively on the Psittacidcz, but I found just
the skins I wanted were not at hand to refer to, so the present
observations must be supposed to continue where I left off with
the Red-faced Conure.
Compared with other birds, we obtained comparatively
few members of this family from the Pacific side, and those were
mostly of the genus Pionits. Unless one found out the trees
they fed on it was almost impossible to shoot any, for whatever
part we were in on this side, it was seldom our luck to be in the
vicinity of their feeding grounds, and almost our only acquaint-
ance with the majority of them was when they were passing
overhead morning and evening; especially was this so with the
Macaws and Amazon Parrots. The first evening of our arrival
at Santo Domingo, Mr. Hamilton shot a pair of the Ara
\0x25A0chloroptera. A small flock of them passed over the clearing just
about sunset, and alighted in a tree on the edge of the forest for
a few minutes ; as soon as one fell, the rest of them arose with a
deafening noise, and some of them flew around their fallen com-
panion which had lodged in a branch, and it was through this,
that a second one was obtained. These two were the only
Macaws that we procured during the whole of our stay there,
and I never saw them settle anywhere in our neighbourhood
again. Wherever we came across Macaws they always
inhabited the highest forest trees, and were generally out of
range. I can remember no other forest birds which flew at such
a height above the tree tops as the Macaws and some of the
Amazons did. The former look really grand flying, not in the
way of colouring, but from their fine shape and movements, and

they seem to cover space so rapidly. It is a curious thing that
the colours of these birds which are so remarkably brilliant in
some of the species, are imperceptible when flying overhead,
even at no great height; which is due to seeing them against
the bright skies. It was impossible to distinguish then, the
difference between the Scarlet, and the Blue-and-Yellow
Macaws. But at sunset it was another thing, when the slanting
rays of the sun lighted up the beautiful colours of the under
sides. On our long canoe journey down the Napo, I always
looked forward to this, the pleasantest hour of the day. Then
for an hour or more a continuous stream of Macaws and Parrots
would pass overhead with their incessant harsh cries. The
Parrots (mostly of the genus Chrysotis ) would be in flocks of
from four to six, up to fifty or sixty ; but the Macaws, seldom
more than fourteen or sixteen together, and more often less.
On dozens of occasions I have counted them and always, found
them in even numbers. Sometimes I thought I had at last
found an odd number, but, without fail, the straggler would
come hurrying on not far behind. The Macaws always seemed
to prefer a certain kind of tree to sleep in--a large roomy tree,
which rose rather above the general forest level, and which bore
its leaves mostly on the outside. Wherever we were, they always
went to the West to sleep, and likewise in the morning returned
East. They took a long time to settle down at night, and
seemed by the noise to have a pitched-battle before doing so.
Their usual rising time was about 6.30, but if the mornings were
dull and the forest mists hung about later than usual, they
would not start off to breakfast until 8 o'clock. The Macaws
choose the highest sites obtainable for their nests, and seem to&gt;
prefer a hole on the under side of a sloping branch.
In travelling down through Colombia, I remember one
place where we came across a number of the Military Macaws ;
they were passing over a very small valley and were just below
us, and it was a pretty sight to look down upon them as we did
then. I was surprised to find them there, for the altitude must
have been near 5,000 feet. I have always found the flesh of all
the Parrot tribe very tough to eat, whichever way one cooks it;
but if a papaia tree is at hand, and one wraps the carcase in one
of the leaves for a day, it renders it fairly tender. At Santo
Domingo we usually fared pretty well in the matter of food, and
despised the carcases of all the birds we skinned, except the
Game Birds and Pigeons ; but to the people of the hut we lived
in, all was grist that came to the mill, and they boiled up

indescriminately together Hawks, Tanagers, Umbrella Birds
(nasty black-looking flesh), and all birds down to Humming
Birds. Our Indians at Papallacta used to simply throw the
bodies for a few minutes into the centre of the fire without even
troubling to clean them out, and when they were just scorched,
tear them to pieces with their fingers and eat them, accompanied
by much laughter and joking. At some places we, too, were glad
of a pot (barring Hawks) of mixed birds, and one took one's
chance of getting a tasty morsel or the reverse.
Around Guayaquil, and especially on the Island of Puna at
the mouth of the river, the tiny Psittacula coelestis was fairly
common, and at times could be bought in the town for twopence
or threepence each. These are lovely little birds and would
make a grand addition to our avaries at home. Its total length
does not exceed 4 inches. The head, throat, and cheeks are
bright light green, and a brilliant blue spot by the eye ; the nape
is greyish blue, but the back is rather a difficult colour to
describe, being what I call a greenish stone colour. The wings
are sapphire with a green edging to the primaries. The tail is
bluish green with the upper tail coverts turquoise, and the rump
bright sapphire blue. The breast and under parts are light
green. It will be seen by those who are unacquainted with the
bird, that it has a lovely arrangement of colouring. The back is
particularly soft looking, and the shade of sapphire one of the
richest that could be found in any bird. The female is easily
distinguished from the male, in the first place by being smaller
and the colours paler. She has very little blue on the rump and
none at all on the wings, and the breast and under-parts are very
yellowish. These birds are confined solely to Western Ecuador,
and are not found at any great distance inland. In the sandy
and rather barren country just around the Port of Manta, grew
some straggling acacia trees which they frequented in small
flocks. We also met with them again near Estneraldas, higher
up the coast. It is rather strange that on the Eastern side is
found the P. xanthops at an altitude of 5,000 feet, which most
remarkably resembles the Coelestis. It is half as large again, but
the only chief difference in the colouring is the face, which is
lemon instead of green, and the breast is greyish yellow. This
bird is not nearly so plentiful as the Coelestis , in fact it is rather a
rare bird.
At Santo Domingo we obtained some of the Bronze-
winged Parrots (Pio 7 ins chalcopterus) \ I believe it is also found
in Western Colombia. It is a curious looking bird and I was

much struck by it, and wished to procure oue or two alive if
possible. I spoke to some Ecuadorians about it, and as they
seemed not quite to understand the bird I wanted, I fetched one
of the skins to show them. "Ah," they said, "that is not a
Parrot at all," and seemed to pity our ignorance in supposing it
was. I have forgotten now what they did call it. I showed
them another bird of the same genus which they acknowledged
was a Parrot, and it seemed they thought a bird was not a Parrot
if it had no green about it. This reminds me of an incident
which happened at a hut we stopped at for our last night on the
Napo, near the mouth of that river. There was a pretty Duck
walking about the hut with longish legs ; I enquired what kind
of Duck it was, and when the owner finally understood what I
was alluding to, he assured me it was not a Duck. Close by it was
a fowl whose whole body with the exception of the head was as
bare of feathers as an egg. Mr. Hamilton pointed to it and said,
" if you told us that was not a fowl we might believe you."
I know many aviculturists at home consider that the
genus Pioiius are rather stupid birds to keep in captivity. They
are not favourites of mine either, but if I could have procured a
Bronze-wing I think I should have made an exception in its
favour. The general prevailing colour of the bird is a dark
indigo blue, with the feathers on the forepart of the breast
edged with pink, the shoulders and wing coverts are shaded
bronze, the primaries and secondaries violet, the latter partially
bronze. The under tail covert is red with a blue line down the
centre of each feather, the under surface of the tail feathers,
turquoise ; and the under surface of the wings of the same
beautiful shade. The beak is j^ellow horn colour, and the naked
membrane around the eyes, bright red. I think these birds are
not very well known in England, in captivity; but in June, 1883,
they received a pair at the " Zoo." One died within the month,
but the other lived there for four years. We never met with
them in any numbers, generally one or two pairs only together.
At an altitude of from four to five thousand feet, we came
across the Pionus seniloides. This is another rather uncommon
looking bird. We met with them in flocks in the early morning
at San Nicolas, where they must have committed great damage
to the maize. We met with the same birds also at Baeza on the
Eastern side, and I am inclined to think that on the whole they
were rather brighter in colour. Just below Baeza we also shot
one specimen of the very rare Urochroma stidoptera. This is not
a pretty bird, being a uniform bright green, with the wings

brownish black, and the wing coverts tipped with dull white.
Its total length is 6 inches. In the same neighbourhood we
procured another member of this genus, U. hucti. A very-
beautiful bird, but not so rare as the former.
At the headwaters of the Napo, the Pyrrhura souancei was
rather common. The Indians of that region often brought them
to us alive, chiefly young birds taken from the nest. At one
time I had some of them alive. They were affectionate little
birds, but that is about all one can say of them, for they had a
shriek which I found very unpleasant and irritating. In a large
aviary they would look pretty when the bright red on the wings
would show off to advantage. They were nesting in April, May,
and June. They seemed to feed on some exceedingly sticky
fruit, so that their beaks were quite covered with it. I found the
young were easily reared on banana.
Another bird the Indians there seemed particularly fond
of was the Brotogerys jugnlaris. It was quite a usual thing to
see one of these very pretty little birds on the shoulders of the
Archidoua Indian women. They would carry them in that
position when employed in household duties, and also on long
journeys through the forests. I kept one or two alive for some
time and found them most charming birds. They would sit on
my finger and kiss, and try to hold quite a conversation in a
comical little voice. Their only fault, if fault it was, was that
they always wanted to be with one. One of mine met with a
very sad end for it was gobbled up by a dog, and the other was
accidentally killed by myself. I had carried it in my pocket for
two days through the forests to the river where we were to
embark in canoes, but it got out of the improvised cage I had
made for it in a hut we were staying in for the night, and hid
among the litter on the floor, and to my great grief I trod on it
before I knew it was out. We never met with them again after
we left the headwaters of the Napo, although I have been told
since that they are found also on the Maranon. This I doubt,
and I think my informant mistook them for the B. tui. This
latter bird we first met with in the month of July near the
mouth of the Napo, when they were nesting. They were
exceedingly plentiful, but at that season were mostly seen in
pairs only. Stopping one day on the river bank for a few
minutes, just after we entered the Maranon (as the highest part
of the Amazon is called) our Indians I think must have seen
one of these birds enter a tree overhead, or I don't know what
would have caused them to suspect there was a nest there. At

any rate one of them quickly mounted the tree and produced
six young ones from a hollow in the bend of a branch 20 feet
above the ground. There was the greatest difference imaginable
in their sizes, some being almost feathered while others were
only about half the size and scarcely a feather showing. They
were quite willing at once to feed on masticated banana from the
Indian's mouths. The yellow on the forehead was already con-
spicuous in those that were most feathered. I brought a pair
from this nest home with me, and still have them in perfect
health. I didn't trouble to feed mine from the mouth, for small
as they were, I found they would eat the banana readily by
themselves, and would eat all day long if they were kept supplied
with fruit. This diet they lived on solely, until we almost
reached England. I had, however, laid in a small stock of
Canary seed in Para, in case my bananas gave out on the way,
which they did, a day or two before we reached Madeira. I
found, however, they took as readily to the seed as if they had
never fed on anything else. They seem perfectly hardy, and
don't mind cold in the least, but they are just a trifle noisy;
probably with mine it is because they are in a room with a lot of
noisy birds, and when one starts they all seem to think they
must add to the din. I believe they could with ease be taught
to speak, because mine imitate all sorts of sounds, and the notes
of many birds, so that they constantly deceive us in this way.
I have a pair of Golden-backed Trumpeters (Psophia nape?isisJ ,
who say " Chewy, Chewy," in a curious tone of voice when they
want food, and the Tuis imitate this to perfection. When in
fully adult plumage they have a yellow patch around the eyes,
at present it is only faintly visible in mine. I can heartily
recommend these birds as pets, for they are most affectionate,
and although I have no time to pay any special attention to
mine now, they remain just as tame as when they were with me
nearly all day long out in South America. Many of these
remarks also apply to another and much better known member
of the same genus, the Canary-winged Parrakeet (B. virescens).
We met with them for the first time on the Tower Napo, some-
where near the mouth of the Curarai, where at sunset they
assembled on the trees along the banks of the river in such
thousands that I have never seen anything like it in my life
elsewhere. They seemed to choose as their sleeping places
chiefly one particular kind of tree, that was very bare of leaves,
and grew where the banks of the river were lowest and the
ground swampy. Our Indians delighted in making a noise to
disturb them, when the sky all around would be full of them,

and the noise so great that by shouting ever so loud we could
only just hear each others voices. The Canary-coloured wings
are most conspicuous when flying, and such clouds of them
together formed a very fine sight. These birds have great
homing instincts, in fact all birds the Indians keep seem to
possess or acquire this instinct. They keep no birds in cages,
and Toucans, Cassiques, Parrakeets, Parrots, Penelopes, and
other birds I have seen about the Indian habitations with full
liberty, sleeping in the forest trees near the huts at night, and in
and about the huts during the day. When up the Napo, I once
had a pair of the B. virescens brought to me by an Indian who
lived on the opposite bank of the river to us, to see if I would
give him something in exchange for them ; as I was not able to
attend to the matter at the time, he left them in our hut until
the next day, but during that evening they took their departure
back of their own accord, and the river there was quite as wide
as the Thames at London Bridge ; neither was the hut visible
from the opposite bank. I brought a pair of these birds home
alive with me also. I find them as hardy, if not more so, than
the Tins. Their nesting season on the Maranon must have been
in July, for although we never came across their nests ourselves,
we met Indians with numbers of young ones, so I procured a
pair from them and brought mine up by hand.
Although I have nothing of importance to chronicle about
the Red-vented Parrots, I may just remark that they were also
exceedingly common on certain parts of the Napo. All those I
came across in the possession of the Indians, although ex-
ceedingly tame, seemed uninteresting and rather stupid birds.
We did not trouble much to look out for live birds until
we got down to the Amazon, as we expected to find there all we
cared to bring home with us, but in this we w T ere grievously
disappointed. I searched everywhere, in village after village
where we stopped, and lower down in towns also, but could
never meet with anything beyond the most ordinary Amazon
Parrots, which of course we did not want. Where the Brazilians
cared for birds at all, it was their ambition to possess a Canary
for which they would pay extravagant prices. It is no exagger-
ation to say, that apart from Amazon Parrots, more Brazilian
birds are to be found in a dealer's shop at home than we met
with in captivity in the whole of the Amazon valley, and the city
of Para included. I thought when we got down to this last port
we could not fail to find some large bird dealers ; but after
enquiring everywhere, I at last unearthed one, known among

Ship's Captains by the name of " Monkey Joe," and monkeys
were almost the only live stock he had, and very few of those
too. Of birds, he had an exceedingly fine King Vulture which I
felt sorely tempted to buy, and two or three Sun Bitterns, one of
which I bought. One day I had offered to me in the Market, a
lovely specimen of the Japim Hangnest (Cassicus persiais), but
as the owner would not accept less than 60,000 reis (#2) for it.
I declined the offer. This was the only bird I saw in the
thousands of miles between Iquitos and Para that I should really
have cared for. I expect shortly to make another trip to South
America, and perhaps I may be more fortunate next time. I
think our dealers at home must get the bulk of their Brazilian
birds from the Southern parts of Brazil, where the people being
less wealthy are glad to do anything to make money: but along
the Amazonian valley where the rubber boom has brought such
enormous wealth to the country, the natives have no need to
seek to make money by the wholesale exportation of birds.

WILD BIRDS' NESTING PLACES.
By H. C. Martin.
The correspondence in the December number of the
Magazine regarding the encouragement of wild birds by
supplying them with suitable nesting places reminds me of some
further interesting points 011 the subject, about which I had had
it in my mind to write to the Society before, and which came
especially to my notice in the following waj^: Some time ago,
while turning over the leaves of a German agricultural paper, I
came across the circular of a firm who make a business of the
manufacture of artificial nesting places for such insectivorous
birds as build in holes in trees, etc., and whose presence
and multiplication it is highly to the interest of farmers
and fruit-growers to encourage. It is pleasing to bird-lovers
to think that such a business, which one would at first regard
as trifling, ridiculous almost, can be worth carrying on, prov-
ing, as it does, the existence of a very general kindly feeling
towards the wild birds as well as a wide-spread appreciation of
the valuable services they render--and in this, I think, we may
well accept a little lesson from our enterprising neighbours on
the Continent, for it is to be feared that in England the precise
sentiment that makes the business possible, is far from prevailing

to the same extent and that here this small branch of trade
would shew but a poor result.
As the protection of birds by this means seems to me to
be "aviculture" in a literal sense (and a very good sense) the
more note-worthy points about these " Nistkasteu " will doubt-
less be of interest, the circular in question being drawn up in a
precise and quite scientific manner.
The nests are made in four sizes (the various dimensions
being stated with great exactitude in millimetres) and consist of
natural logs suitably hollowed out, the entrance-hole being in
the side, near the top ; the smallest size is intended for the
various Tit-mice, Creepers, Wrynecks, Fly-catchers, Nuthatches
and other hole-dwellers of about the same size, the next for
Starlings, Nuthatches and Wrynecks again, the ffesser-spotted
Wood-pecker, etc., the third for the larger Wood-peckers and the
Hoopoe, and the fourtb for Owls. There is also a horizontal pattern
and a shallow, more box-like one with a large entrance-hole,
suitable for Wrens, Wagtails and other species which do not as
a rule care for a deep nest.
The description reads more or less as follows : " This nest-
box, the result of twenty-five years of practical experience, and
observation, is a reproduction of the natural Wood-pecker's hole.
The box itself consists of a sound piece of branch ; the nest
cavity, narrow at the top, widens out lower down and forms at
the bottom a shallow cup. The entrance-hole is directed slightly
upwards towards the inside, thus rendering it difficult for moisture
to penetrate. The edges of it, particularly the lower ones, are
slightly rounded off both outside and inside, and in place of the
irregularities which are found on the sides of every natural hole,
several angular ridges are cut so as to give the birds proper foot-
hold. The roof-board and the back-board for hanging the nest
up are of stout oak, the former being strongly fastened to the
body with bolts and the latter with bolt and wood-screw. The
roof-board must fit well all round."
" The top is made to take off so that broods of sparrows or
squirrels can be turned out."
" The nests do not require cleaning out."
" Screw-nails are most suitable for fixing the boxes in
position as they held as well as a screwed-in screw and, not
requiring to be driven in so far as ordinary nails, have the
advantage of doing less injury to the tree."

"The most suitable time for putting the nests up is from
the middle of November to the end of February. If necessary
one can do so in March or April also. They should be hung in
an upright position but leaning slightly forward, never back-
wards, and they must be fixed absolutely rigidly. It is to be
recommended to have the opening directed away from the most
exposed quarter, i.e., more or less towards the South-Fast. A
little sawdust should be put in every nest before it is hung up."
The subject seems to have been studied in a practical way
and with due regard to the habits and preferences of the various
species ; aviculturists may be interested to know that the prices
asked range from 5d to 2/2 each, and it would seem that land-
owners in Germany are in the habit of ordering a number at a
time, as quotations are likewise given for the various sizes in
dozens. Those w 7 ho have the good fortune to reside in the
country should find it interesting to try the experiment of
making a few similar nest-boxes to place about their gardens ;
with a little ingenuity the most ordinary materials could be
utilized for the purpose, and I have always noticed that the
" constructive faculty " is almost invariably highly developed
in lovers of living creatures, aviculturists more particularly.
AVICULTURAL NOTES.
By Jas. Cooper.
HYBRID GEESE.
Some time ago there appeared in the Field an article by
Mr. Tegetmeier re a cross Canadian Goose, which he said was
greatly appreciated by Americans. I wrote asking if it was the
same cross as I had myself obtained, viz., between the Canadian
Gander and the Italian White Goose, and if this hybrid would
produce fertile eggs. I never could find any answer to my
enquiry. I believe Mr. Tegetmeier said the cross was with a
Chinese Goose. Is this bird the one which has a sort of bag
beneath the lower mandible ? I should like to have information
on the subject if any member can enlighten me. If our Editor
has Mr. Tegetmeier's address, perhaps he could induce that
gentleman to repty. I have now sold the hybrids to the Swansea
Corporation to place on their public lake.
DUCKS.
A very interesting bit appears this month from the pen
of Mr. Bonhote. He warns against cats ; but, in my small

experience, rats are the bete noire of amateur duck keepers. I
speak, of course, of fancy ducks--in my case, Mandarins and
Caroliuas. I had some beauties, a pair of each sort, and
succeeded in breeding three of the latter, rearing them to about
three-quarter size on ordinary duck meal--sharps, and a few
ants' eggs, and hard boiled egg--nothing more. The rats took
the lot, both old and young. These ducks are such lovely pets,
I am tempted to go in for more, but how to keep out rats--unless
in runs, covered in entirely with iin. mesh net ? I am about
to erect a Dove aviary, 6oft. by 20ft. and 9ft. high. I think I
shall put in a shallow concrete pond, and introduce some Ducks
also. Rats run up wire netting, so a 3ft. netting would be of
no use against them. I never had any trouble with cats, in fact
I used to like an old cat, I had with my first bird aviaries, with
me when on mouse expeditions, and she never looked at a bird,
but it was a bad time for the mice.
DOVES.
These are most interesting birds for amateurs ; at the
same time I must own they are very disappointing, being so very
pugnacious. They must have a very large flight or be kept in pairs.
The Bronze-winged Crested Dove breeds very well: five broods
in a season being a common thing. One season I had five of the
Green-backed Doves of India ; but I find others are not so
fortunate. I believe if a pair of really healthy birds are given a
quiet aviary, they are easy to breed. I have been greatly
troubled by having their eggs continually sucked ; a friend says
it is mice, but I fancy it is one of the Weavers. Could anyone
throw light on this subject? Could mice break and suck
eggs ? I find many birds very pugnacious to Doves, especially
Parrakeets. I have got three Passerine Doves; but they are very
wild, and I am afraid when I turn them out they will do no good.
The description of these Doves, a short time ago, by one of our
members was very good.

The following description of an outdoor aviary and its
inhabitants may interest some of our readers.
The aviary is a wooden shed 15ft. long by 5ft. deep, height
7ft. gin. at back sloping to 6ft. at front, which is open for its
entire length except a gin. board dropping from under the eaves.

The outside is covered with felt, and it is whitewashed inside.
Attached to the front for its whole length, and extending 8ft.
outwards, is an open run, covered with a double wire netting to
protect the birds from cats, etc. In the open run there is a very
shallow concrete basin with a fountain jet in the centre, fed by
waterworks water, which can be turned on from the outside at
will. Inside, at the back, is fixed a nest of " pigeon holes" and
a long self-supporting hopper filled with canary seed. There
are a few evergreens and fir branches about, but otherwise there
is no protection from the weather and no artificial heat. The
aviary is situated under a young lime tree, and stands quite apart
from all walls and buildings; it faces due South.
The food consists of the pure canary seed contained in the
hopper mentioned above, a handful of mixed oilseeds (rape,
linseed, and hemp) thrown down occasionally on the ground; a
little greenmeat ; and the fountain is turned on every morning
to give fresh water for drinking and bathing.
The following birds have lived in perfect health in this
aviary during the winter, and seemed no worse for the continuous
and very severe frosts and blizzards we have lately experienced.
The only bird lost was one of the Bengalese, which I have had
some time and which was of " uncertain age."--
Canaries (hens), Budgerigars (some of which were bred in
the aviary in '99), Napoleon Weaver, Pink-faced Weavers, Spice
Birds, Bengalese, and the hybrids of the last two species bred in
the aviary in '99 ; St. Helena Waxbill, Bullfinches, Siskins,
Chaffinches, Bramblefinches, Twites, Linnets, Redpolls, Gold-
finches, Java Sparrows, Mules (Linnet-Canary and Siskin-
Canary), bred in the aviary.
REVIEW.
" British Birds : Iheir Successful Management in Captivity , with

That the number of aviculturists who now attempt to,
and largely succeed in, keeping healthy and happy in captivity
British birds, which formerly seldom long survived, is largely on
the increase, is shown by the experiences which have been
related in our pages. Dr. Bradburn's experience in this branch
of aviculture seems to have been very large. His instruction

is minute and practical, and therefore valuable.
We are glad to find that Dr. Bradburn does not encourage
the capture of those birds which can not be hand-reared and when
captured seldom survive long. The little volume has good
illustrations of forty-six species, and we can generally recom-
mend it to beginners in this special branch of aviculture.

Once again the number of arrivals this month leaves me
practically nothing to write about; none of them calling for any
special comment. My visit this month was, however, made in
delightful warm, spring weather, and the birds generally were
looking their best, although as j^et, there were no signs of
breeding. I went round the new Crane House, built some four
years ago, which contained a very fine collection of Cranes,
Emus, Cassowaries, and Ostriches. The pens are all small,
mostly containing a pair, or perhaps only a single bird, which
one can see and observe in comfort. This brings me to the
question of foreign Zool. Gardens as compared with our own ; I
have visited a fair number of European ones, and the great
difference between the British and the foreign is, that in the
former one sees fine and commodious buildings, and in the latter
fine specimens in small and unpretentious aviaries, I do not
mean to imply that there are no good specimens in Loudon, for
of course there are hundreds, but the fact remains, that with all

our beautiful bouses and aviaries we do not keep many birds
which are commonly kept and thrive well abroad.
The climate may have something to do with it, but I feel
sure there is too much miscellaneous crowding of widely
different birds in large aviaries, with the result that the weaker,
which are also as a rule the scarcer species, die off, leaving only
the commoner kinds. Abroad, most of the smaller birds are
kept in moderate-sized cages, each kind to itself as a rule, or two^
or three allied kinds together, after the style of our birds in the
Parrot House, but of course in more suitable cages. The
advantage of keeping birds like this is, that each individual can
get personal attention, little extra dainties if it should appear
unwell, a warm bath or none at all in cold weather, and so on,
trifles perhaps, but trifles that make all the difference between a
bird living, or merely existing ; of course it may be objected
that ordinary people do not have time to look after so many
cages, to which the obvious reply is that they should not keep
more birds than they can comfortably look after, whiie as to
birds breeding, there is more chance of their doing so in a
moderate-sized cage in good health, than in bad health in an
aviary. I am naturally chiefly referring to the rarer, and more
delicate species, the hardier ones will thrive anywhere.
Last month I promised a few more particulars of the new
bird house at Hamburg (not Berlin, as stated), and here they
are. The house is built in the form of a long verandah (facing
due south), having shutters which can be put up in case of bad
weather. It is entirely divided up into small cages, of which
there are 88, and in these are housed 105 species of Passeres,
natives of Germany. It will be noticed that almost each species
has a cage to itself, where they should do remarkably well ; full
particulars of this house are given by Dr. Bolau. (Zool.
Garten, xl, p. 1). From the lesser to the greater--I have just
come across the following notice relating to a new aviary in the
Central Park, New York, it is a large structure, 152 feet long,
72 feet wide, 155 feet high, containing a large pool of water 100
feet long. The menagerie situated in the New York Central
Park is a very small and unpretentious place, and contained,
when I visited it, chiefly N. American mammals, with only a
very few birds, which, however, were in very good condition,
and well looked after. I presume this aviary will be for large
birds, as the smaller kinds w r ould hardly ever be seen. I know,
however, nothing more about it than I have stated above.

BIRDS FOR PHEASANT AVIARIES.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995644794117647" page_id="32637970"  page_num="135" year="" vol="">
Sir, -- I have a series of Pheasant aviaries with mesh small enough to
keep in birds not less than Budgerigars. These cages, five in number, face
S.W., and are each about ioyds. long, 4yds. wide, and 3yds. high. They are
built against a building and, for about 3yds., have a glass roof; they are
open in front, except for a range of windows about i8ins. high, that keep
out driving rain. Under shelter, the floor is cement ; outside, earth
with a few shrubs.
I should like advice what birds would do and breed best. The
Pheasants apparently do not interfere with small birds. I think of one
compartment for English birds, another for Weavers, and a third for
Budgerigars ; but perhaps the Weavers and Budgerigars might do together ?
I should be glad of any suggestions from you or other readers of the
Magazine. Geo. Jennison.
7 he following answer has been se?it to Mr. Jennison :
If the wire mesh is less than an inch (i. e., f-mesh) you can not only
keep Budgerigars and all true Weavers, but even Ribbon-finches, Mannikins,,
and probably Parson-finches ; but I doubt very much whether 1 inch mesh
would be small enough to keep Budgerigars prisoners.
You might try Weavers and Budgerigars together (I think with
perfect safety) in such extensive aviaries.
Of British birds the most interesting to keep are the soft-food eaters,,
such as the Wagtails, Chats, Redstart, Blackcap, and Garden Warbler; and,
if you do not object to the daily preparation of a pan of egg, ants' cocoons,
and biscuit, with a little fruit, I am sure these birds will give you far more
pleasure than the few finches which Great Britain can boast of. If you
prefer seed-eaters, try the Cirl-Bunting, Snow-Bunting, and Reed-Bunting.
As with British birds, the foreign insectivorous forms are far more
pleasing in many ways than the seed-eaters : such birds as Bulbuls and
Hangnests would look most attractive in a thirty-foot aviary ; and if you
secured pairs, I see no reason why they should not be bred. Common as
they are, Java-Sparrows are very suitable for such an enclosure, and, being
easily bred, you could soon secure a good stock : Necklaced Doves also,
which will breed in boxes like ordinary Barbary Doves, would be worth
keeping. A. G. Buteer.

ZEBRA-FINCHES EATING THEIR EGGS.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9995313" page_id="32637970"  page_num="135" year="" vol="">
Sir, --I have a pair of Zebra-finches nesting. The hen laid an egg on
the morning of March 10th--the first she had laid. A little later I noticed
both birds in the nest eating the egg, and there was not a trace of it left a
little later still.
These birds nested about six weeks ago, when I had them in a large
cage with other birds, and the same thing happened then ; but I thought
probably they had been annoyed and disturbed by the others, so this time,
as soon as I saw they were building, I caught and put them into a breeding
cage, thinking perhaps they would do better; but so far the result has been,
the same.
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.992533352941176" page_id="32637971"  page_num="136" year="" vol="">
Is there any remedy for egg-eating ? I should be much obliged if
any other members of the Avicultural Society could give me any advice on
the subject. Perhaps these birds only do well in a large aviary when nest-
ing ; but last year a pair of Bronze-wings laid eggs and would have hatched
them out if they had not met with an accident a few days before they were
due to hatch. They were separated from the others and put into a cage by
themselves, and as they did so well I thought the Zebra-finches would do
the same if kept quiet. I feed them myself, and I am very careful not to
disturb them. E. W. Robertson.
The following answer was sent to Mrs. Robertson :
When once these little Grass-finches begin to eat their eggs, I believe
their is no remedy but to get rid of them and buy a fresh pair. I never
had a Zebra-finch which did this, but I have always kept this species in a
tolerably large aviary with many other birds, so that its time was pretty
fully occupied in defending its nest. In an aviary the Zebra-finch breeds
throughout the year, and rarely 7 fails to bring off at least one or two young.

Sir,---A t the Crystal Palace in February, 1899, and at each Bird Show
held there since, as well as at Ba&amp;apos;iham and the Aquarium, one or more pairs
of Parrot-finches were to be seen having a green body, a blue forehead,
and a red throat and tail. These have been constantly spoken of as Tri-
coloured Parrot-finches.
I should like to point out that this description is not strictly correct.
Of course any 7 bird of three colours may be called tricoloured, but the
species hitherto known as the Tricoloured Parrot-finch \Erythrura trichroa)
has no red throat.
The birds referred to are hybrids, the parents being the male ordinary
Parrot-finch and the female Tricoloured Parrot-finch. This will explain the
non-appearance of the birds in the Cat. Birds Brit. Mus.

Sir, -- I was glad to read the few interesting remarks in last month's
Magazine by 7 the Hon. and Rev. F. G. Dutton, and regret having to share
my views with the lion, gentleman that the Parrot classes made an
exceptionally poor show.
One was obliged to ask where were the Birds ; likewise the Exhibitors ?
Whether it was in consequence of the severity of the weather, or the
gloom throughout the country 7 occasioned by 7 the War, are questions that
might be raised.
In my 7 opinion much is attributable to two impediments, viz., exor-
bitant and unjust Railway charges, and inadequate Prize money 7 ; and until
these matters are rightly adjusted, there is little inducement for those
desiroirs of giving us a good exhibition of the larger Foreign Birds that
must necessarily be shown in serviceable and heavy cages which means a
serious railway expense for long distances, disgusting the Exhibitor at the
close of the Show that he has incurred a balance on the wrong side.

I strongly object to withholding prizes in any section unless there is
insufficient merit, and that, I maintain should be left entirely to the
discretion of the judge; but there are authorities overruling judges at
most shows, consequently prizes have to be awarded according to orders
given. This is a means of cutting expenses down closely.
It certainly appears unfair to an Exhibitor when a premier honour
is withheld in a class containing two exceptionally rare and beautiful
specimens, both being of nearly equal merit. There is no alternative even
then but to follow instructions. A difficulty at most Shows, even under
good management, is the exceptionally heavy expenses, and Committees
have as much as they can do to meet their liabilities.
In going back to the Palace Show of 188S, I remember one class
contained 25 Parrakeets, a grand lot worth going a long distance to see; nine
entries in African Grey Parrots, another display not met with now. Amazons
and other large Parrots also showed up well ; Cockatoos were not forgotten
being well represented in the two classes in '87 numbering 21, which
included some magnificent specimens, such as the great Salmon-crested,

I sincerely hope the Palace Show may retain the excellent reputation
it has held for so many years, and not pass into oblivion ; as all interested
in aviculture derive much pleasure and profit when visiting the great
National Exhibition of the year. H. T. T. Camps.
THE RED-FACED FINCH.
Sir, --The white feathers acquired by Mr. Hawkins' bird are, I think,
a mere " sport," and do not indicate any specific or sub-specific difference
from the normal type. Birds of the genus Pytelia seem very liable to this
partial albinism, but it is also seen in many other species, especially the
Avadavat and the Cordon bleu. In most cases it is no doubt due to age,
but I question whether age is always the cause. It appears to be analogous
to grey hairs in man. Horatio R. Firtm^R.
THE BLACK-HEADED BUNTINGS AT THE ZOO.
Sir. --In his notes on the additions to the Zoological Society's
Gardens for January, Mr. Bonhote omits to comment upon the most
interesting and unusual event of the breeding in the Western Aviary of
Black-headed Buntings (Emberiza melanocephala) during that bleak mouth.
The keeper there informs me that he had no idea that this pair were
nesting, until one day (about Jan. 15th) he discovered one of them feeding a
full-fledged youngster, which chirped like a young Sparrow and in colour
resembled the hen Bunting. The nest w r as found amongst the ivy, in the
outer part, built upon the remains of a Song-Thrushes' nest of last year.
When discovered it was quite empty, and probably all the eggs but one
had been eaten by other birds.
The only food that was supplied to the birds in this aviary consisted
of the ordinary seeds and a small quantity of the usual soft-food mixture.
It is somewhat remarkable that a partially insectivorous species
which, in a wild state, inhabits Southern Europe in Summer and India in
Winter; and which is said to feed its young entirely upon insects, should

^successfully rear a young bird in an English aviary in January, when insect-
food must have been exceedingly scarce, if not entirely absent, and when
the temperature was surely far below that ever experienced by these birds
when wild.
It would seem from the foregoing that this species might breed freely
in captivity if located in suitable outdoor aviaries. A pair in my possession
appeared anxious to nest last Spring, very soon after I obtained them, and
when they could hardly have been caught more than a few weeks. I shall
hope to succeed in breeding them this Spring. The male very frequently
utters his song during the breeding season, and I have sometimes heard it
quite late at night. Presumably the male of the pair at the " Zoo " must
have commenced his spring song some time before Christmas; mine is now
(March 4th) just conimencing his. D. Seth-Smith.
[At the time of writing the above I had not had an opportunity of
-seeing the supposed young Bunting, but, having noticed with interest the
report of its arrival, in the official list of additions to the Society's collection
(a copy of which appeared in the last number of this Magazine), had
corresponded with the Keeper of the Western Aviary, on the subject, and
had thus obtained all available information.
I have since visited the Gardens, and viewed the supposed 3 r oung
Bunting from a distance of some ten or twelve feet, the nearest approach it
would allow, and have now little doubt that the attendants at the aviar}&amp;apos; have
been entirely mistaken in their identification of this bird, and that the
Buntings have never bred at all.
The bird which is supposed to be a young Black-headed Bunting is, in
iny humble opinion, nothing more or less than a female Cut-throat Finch.
How it got into the aviary, is a mystery of which I do not pretend to offer a
-solution, for I am told that this species is never kept in this aviaiy.
The Keeper now tells me that he has never actualty seen the Buntings
feeding it; but on several occasions saw them close to it. Thus he jumped to
the conclusion that it was their offspring and reported to the Society's head-
quarters that they had successfully bred in the aviary, in the middle of
January. He then searched for the nest and discovered, what he supposed
was it, on the remains of an old Thrushes' nest.
It is passing strange that such a mistake should ever have been made,
but, unless I am greatly at fault, it still remains to be proved whether Ember-
iza melanocephala, will breed successfully in captivity.--D. S.-S.]
A PROPOSAL TO EXTEND THE SCOPE OF THE MAGAZINE.
Sir,--I am very pleased to see the increase in the size of the
Avicultural Magazine , and hope that it will be maintained.
May I be allowed a little space to air a crotchet of mine, which I
know is not regarded with much favour in official quarters, but which I
think to be worthy of vety^ careful consideration ?
The Avicultural Magazine has been, and is, a great success, and I want
it to become a still greater one. The chief difficulty has been its extremely
limited circulation, and there is no reasonable prospect of this being
materially increased unless it appeals to a wider circle of readers. Has not

<bodyText confidence="0.999565282608696" page_id="32637974"  page_num="139" year="" vol="">
the time arrived when we may safely and wisely open onr pages to other
living creatures besides " foreign and British birds " ?
There are two directions in which we might extend our borders, and
I should like to see a movement made in each of these directions--but they
are quite distinct, and the adoption of one would not necessarily&amp;apos; involve
the other.
First, I should like the Magazine to be open to papers on rare or
foreign Mammals, Reptiles, and Fishes : discussed, of course, from the point
of view of the keeper of living animals, and not from that of the collector
of dead specimens. I believe that this would add largely to the interest of
the Magazine, and considerably extend our circle of readers.
Secondly, I should like the ban against Canaries to be abolished.
When the Avicultural Society was founded, aviculturists were a feeble folk,
and there was a well-founded dread of an invasion by the Canary Fancy. All
that is of the past, and Canaries could now never occupy anything more than
a subordinate position among the objects to which the Society should devote
itself. But there is no reason why they should be excluded altogether, and
in my opinion their exclusion is unscientific and absurd. There is no doubt
but that the publication of a few articles on Canaries in our Magazine would
do more to extend its circulation than any other expedient. There is a great
work to be done in the Canary world--the "fancy" is honeycombed with
trickery and cruelty--there is no publication open for the discussion of
Canary topics except the fancy papers--and there must be a large number of
people who would welcome a Magazine which would treat of Canaries from
a less personal and more scientific point of view than that of our weekly
contemporaries. It has no doubt become the fashion for the aviculturist to
look down upon the canary-man : it would be well for us to consider whether
there is ail)&amp;apos; ground for this contempt. To begin with, keepers of British
and foreign birds have no exclusive right to the name of aviculturists, which
includes all who devote themselves to the culture of birds. On the score of
humanity, the culture of Canaries is to be preferred to that of nearly all other
species, as it does not involve the capture of wild birds. On the score of
science, there is probably scope for as much knowledge and skill in the
breeding of high-class Canaries as there is in the feeding and management
of rare foreign birds.
At all events, no harm can be done by the discussion of this question,
and I think it would be useful if the members would give expression to their
views upon it. Horatio R. Fieemer.
I am quite sure that no good would come to the Society by doing
what Mr. Fillmer suggests, not only would the published Organ degenerate
into a mere fancier's Magazine without any pretention to a scientific status,
but it would cease to be purely Avicultural, which is one of its greatest
attractions. A fancier is in some sense an aviculturist but an aviculturist is
not necessarily a fancier. It is certain that any radical change in the
subject matter of the Magazine would result in the retirement of all the
.scientists amongst our Members. Arthur G. BuTEER

THE SHAMA.
Sir,--I am anxious to try a Shama, but, before doing so, would like
to know, ist, if I could successfully keep one in a large cage in the kitchen ;
2nd, whether they are delicate, and what food it would require; 3rd, would
it be likely to sing and become tame under the above conditions ?
I have read Mr. Phillipps' account; he says, "Put them in a garden
aviary," Sec .; but I regret I have no garden aviary.
As they are rather expensive, I should like any other information you
could give. Charges Speed.
The following reply was sent to Mr. Speed --
Mr. Bonhote has asked me to answer your letter.
A Shama may be kept successfully in a large cage, but it should be a
box cage if possible. Nevertheless the cage should be its home, not its
prison.
A kitchen, as a rule, is a very bad place to keep any bird in; but
there are kitchens and kitchens. A11 ordinary living room, with a fire
during the day in cold weather, will do fairly well, but fully three-fourths
of the cage should be warmly covered at night; and he should be removed
from the room, in cold weather I mean, when the window is opened. In
warm weather, the more fresh air he has the better; but draughts should
be carefully avoided.
For a foreign insectivorous bird, the Shama is not delicate; but
neither can it endure much cold. A little half-open box or shelf, with hay,
in a sheltered corner of the cage (if the latter be large enough) is often a
great help in cold weather.
It is an insectivorous bird, and must be fed accordingly. I will not be
so rash as to suggest which of the many foods recommended in our
Magazine may be the most suitable : -- but beware of too many perfectly dry
ants' cocoons! In addition to the food, which, with clean water, in clean
non-metallic receptacles, should be always present inside the cage, give as.
many spiders and small insects as possible. Unpoisoned cockroaches will
do famously. Place the trap (the " demon " is the best) on the floor, open
the cage door, and the Shama will quickly learn to help himself. With a
mealworm, he can be easily enticed back into his cage.
If } r ou cannot obtain insects, carefully scrape a little cooked mutton,
and mix it with the ordinary insectivorous food. Avoid anything doughy
or indigestible, or your bird may have a fit. Also avoid gentles and wasp-
grubs; and mealworms should be given sparingly--as a treat. If he should
look lumpy, add some fluid magnesia to the drinking water. Let him
bathe regular^.
If you understand birds, the male Shama will join you at meals, eat
off your plate, follow you about the house (mind the windows), become as
tame and impudent as ever you like, and will make a really charming
pet. The males sing freely, and may be taught to whistle tunes correctly;
but most of those which reach this country have been hand-reared, and
then the song is often poor and monotonous.
Let him have plenty of exercise, clean water, and plain food, do not
over-expose him to cold, and he may live a dozen years and more.

LORIES, LORIKEETS, AND OTHERS.
By Reginald Phieeipps.
At page 103, Mr. Fillmer refers to a Purple-capped Lory
in his possession laying an egg. I agree with him that the
laying of eggs by Lories and Lorikeets in this country is unusual.
This may be, as regards the former, simply because Lories are
so seldom given the chance. With Lorikeets, however, my
experience (so far as it goes) teaches me that while the males, if
healthy, are always (more or less according to the season) ready
for nesting, the reverse is the case with the females, who, how-
ever apparently willing, seem never to come into full nesting-
condition, pi&amp;apos;esumably on account of the coldness of our climate.
Moreover with me the male, after every possible endeavour to
bring his own proper female to book, sooner or later has turned
upon her with such persistent savageness as usually to render it
necessary to remove her, in order to save her from serious injury.
The male will, in any case, completely desert her, and with mad
recklessness will endeavour, by fair means or foul--usually the
latter, for a more selfish bird it would be difficult to find--to
obtain possession of some other female, a Conure from preference,
whether the latter may be unattached or otherwise. In my
aviary this was specially the case with a pair of Ornamented
Lorikeets, Trichoglossus ornatus ; but the female was not a very
good specimen, although quite healthy.
Many years ago I had a faultless pair of Purple-capped
Lories, flying loose in my birdroom, with window opening into
the garden aviary. In a few months' time they became as
dangerous as a couple of Goshawks. Then they commenced
nesting, and took entire possession of the birdroom, not a single
bird daring to enter. This was too much ; and I was compelled
to part with them, which was a misfortune.
I11 March, 1896, I obtained a pair of Musky Lorikeets,
Glossopsittcicus concinnus. In a year or so the male deserted the

female under the conditions already stated, and, in the absence
of Conures, went after some of the Brotogerys. For some
months, not being able to obtain a female, each being well
protected, he struck up a close friendship with a male Tovi
( B. jugularis), whom he continually fed from the crop. The
great desire that this bird always had of feeding another has
made me suspect sometimes that the action may have relieved
the system, and thus have contributed towards his length of daj r s,
of which more anon. The Tovi was killed by a Blue Pie, whose
hatred of the chattering Tovis no words can express; and then
followed a period of irregular love-making and warfare, when,
owing to an unhappy accident, a vacancy unexpectedly occurred.
On and from the 28th November, 1898, he took forcible possession
of a female Golden-fronted Parrakeet, B. tuipara , to the great
terror of the lady, who trembled for her life. After a while the
Tuipara became less terrified at the demonstrative wooing of the
Musky, and, since, the two have been literally inseparable. The
Tuipara had alwa3^s seemed as sensitive to our bleak climate
as the female Lorikeets, and I ceased to hope for the appearance
of eggs. Last autumn they took possession of an ordinary
travelling cage hanging up in the birdroom some five feet from
the floor, in an exposed situation near the window ; but I did not
specially interest myself in their proceedings. On the 13th
March of this year, and up to and including the 18th, both the
birds kept to the nest, only rarely leaving it for a brief half-
minute or so : during these days they invariably came off
together. On and after the 19th, the Musky came off during the
day, but kept a sharp watch on the nest, usually from some quiet
corner several yards away, and uttered a little squeak on the
approach of any one ; but never once did the female allow her-
self to be frightened from the nest. The Musky returned to the
nest to roost every evening about 6 o'clock.
Four eggs were laid, apparently on alternate days, round
ovals of large size, larger than those of the Golden-shouldered
Parrakeet, but not exhibiting the slight inclination to quince-
shape of most of the eggs of the Tovi with which I was favoured
some j^ears ago. They were all clear.
Whether the Musky fed the Tuipara whilst she was sitting
I do not know. From the 19th up to the 31st--on which day I
took the eggs--only on two occasions did I see her off the nest;
on the first he was feeding her, on the second she was feeding
herself.
That this Lorikeet should have lived over four years in my

<bodyText confidence="0.999317931818182" page_id="32637978"  page_num="143" year="" vol="">
possession is I suppose remarkable, for of all tlie Lorikeets the
Musky has perhaps the worst record for fits. A lady, who was
many years in Australia, told me that the Colonists seldom
attempt to keep it. One she herself had tried in Australia soon
died in a fit. Even at the London Zoological Gardens (I am
writing this without book, but I think correctly), where with
some of the Lorikeets they have been very successful, they seem
to have been rather the reverse with this species, judging by the
dates of receipt given from time to time in the Parrot House. I
need hardly say that my Musky was not fed on seed, to which,
indeed, he always had access, but which he never touched so far
as I know. Talking about food for Lorikeets, I chanced some four
years ago to visit a shop just after a cageful of these birds had
been fed. The food consisted of thick slices of bread and butter,
which they attacked as greedily as a lot of hungry pigs attack
their evening meal.--Now, please, do not go off and say that I
recommend bread and butter as a food for Lorikeets !
My Musky became very tame and confiding, often flying
on to my head, and also on to my hand when I brought out his
sop in the morning. So little did he fear me and my threats
that nothing would induce him to go to bed before bed-time. On
a cold day I would sometimes endeavour to drive the birds into
the shelter of the birdroom before dusk : seating himself on a high
perch, he would defy me. I would try and frighten him with a
long-handled net, placing the net over him ; but he knew I
wouldn't hurt him, and stuck to the perch. When the proper
time came, however, lie would give a wild derisive shriek and
dash into the birdroom. Nevertheless I betrayed his trust in
the end, for when, on 31st March, I passed him and the Tuipara
on to another member of the Society, he allowed me to catch
him almost without a flutter.
The members of this species are not nearly so savage as
the Trichoglossi. Except occasionally with some of the Psittaci,
in a large aviary they do not interfere with other birds, except
indirectly by going into their nesting boxes. The same remark
applies to the Scaly-breasted Lorikeet, Psitteuteles chlorolepidohis,
if I may judge by a single pair which came into my possession
many years ago. Before the}&amp;apos;&amp;apos; reached me they had been fed and
moulted on canary seed alone, and had lost nearly all of their
conspicuous markings, being mostly yellow-green. The female,
too, was in a decline, and I failed to save her. The want of
proper food may or may xiot have been the cause of the dull
plumage of the two and of the death of the one. No Lory or
Lorikeet with me has ever lost an atom of colour.

Mr. Goodfellow tells us (page 125) 01 the Tovi Parrakeets
following him and the Indian women, and always wanting to be
with him. A pair I had for some years treated me in a similar
way, following me about the aviary, perching on head, shoulders,
any spot on which they could obtain a footing. This looks very
pretty on paper, but it did not work out quite prettily in practice.
The female was a spiteful little wasp, and would seize hold of any
exposed piece of flesh she could reach, my ears and neck being
her favourite morsels ; and the male, excited and incited to evil
by this Jezebel, would join in most heartily. The more I dodged
about and tried to beat them off, the more waspish and Jezebelish
would they become, shrieking all the while at the top of their
voices like a couple of infuriated women. The male was really
a good-hearted fellow, but was superbly chivalrous, always
standing up for his wife. For some years, off and on, a six-foot
flight cage in my dining room was their home : and the end two-
foot door I would innocently open and would attend to the food,
the male sitting perfectly still on a perch opposite and rather
below me, the female being on her eggs at the other end. O11
one such an occasion the male suddenly dashed at my forehead
almost with the weight and violence of a thrown-up cricket
ball, half stunning me and making quite a respectable wound,
although the beak did not readily catch hold of the tightly-
drawn skin. For a few days I was very cautious, but, finding
him quite quiet, once more gave him an opportunity, of which
he promptly availed himself. Darting straight at me like a bolt
from a cross-bow, without cry or the slightest warning, he seized
me sideways across the centre of the upper lip, a little below the
nose, and hung on like a bulldog, the blood flowing inside
the mouth testifying to the bird's long upper mandible having
gone well home. I think it is in " Verdant Green,'' in a Town and
Gown row at Oxford, that we are given an account of a Proctor
peeping cautiously out at a side door into the street, and having
his claret tapped by a playful member of the many-headed. As
he held his handkerchief up to the damaged member, in agonizing
tones he announced to the sympathizing undergraduates around
him, " Gentlemen, this is painful, this is very painful." Now, I
have been bitten by many birds and beasts, under varying cir-
cumstances, and in various parts, but it is seldom that any
creature has found out such a tender spot in such a searching man-
ner, and most feelingly could I have declared to an assembly of
my fellow aviculturists, " Dadies and gentlemen, this is painful,
this is very painful." I observe that some of you are laughing ;
well, if you do not believe me just try it for yourselves.

In tlie last instalment of his interesting paper, at page 126,
I think Mr. Goodfellow has allowed his pen to slip. The
Canary-winged Parrakeet is not Brotogerys viresceus but B. chiriri.
I11 the Zoological Society's List it is called the Orange-winged
Parrakeet, B. xanthopterus, the latter scientific name being the
more common. Brotogerys viresceus is the rare White-winged
Parrakeet, or the Yellow - winged Parrakeet as it has been
unhappily named by the Zoological Society.

1. PLOCEUS RUTLEDGII, THE SUMMER PLUMAGE
OF P. MEGARHYNCHUS.
</construct>
<bodyText confidence="0.9955045" page_id="32637980"  page_num="145" year="" vol="">
In the Proceedings of the Asiatic Society for July 1899, p.
77, will be found the diagnosis of an Indian species of Weaver-
bird which I there named, believing it to be new, Ploceus
rutledgii , after Mr. Rutledge, from whom the types were
obtained. Mr. Rutledge would not sell the birds until assured
that they would not be killed, and I am glad to sa}^ that his
humanity has been justified by a very interesting occurrence.
The birds, being kept alive, have in due course assumed an
undress plumage very similar to that of the ordinary Bayas (P.
baya and P. atrigula ) but differing from this in most of the points
whichfMr. Hume pointed out as distinctive of his P. megarhynchus.
As they also agree closely with this form in measurements, and
were obtained from Nynee Tal (the types of P. megarhynchus
having come from Kaladoongi, below that place) it seems to me
obvious that my P. rutledgii is merely the summer plumage of
that species, hitherto unknown, no doubt, by reason of the
unhealthiuess of its Terai habitat in the season when the birds
are in full feather. Under the circumstances the promised plate
seems to me unnecessary, and therefore I merely append below
a description of this summer or breeding-plumage
General colour bright yellow (brightest 011 L h ea d and dull
impure on rump), with the following exceptions :--lores, round
the eye below, and ear coverts, dark brown ; a dull-black patch
on each side of the breast before the shoulder ; nape and hind
neck, dull blackish brown ; upper back, wings, and tail blackish
brown, each feather edged, entirely or externally, with light
brown, on the uppermost part of the back with yellow; under
wing-coverts dirty white.

Iris bright light brown ; bill black, fleshy-white at base ;
feet dark brownish fleshy, claws blackish horny.
Both specimens, as noted in P.A.S.B. {loc. cit .) were similar
but one was slightly duller than the other. It is also slenderer
in make, though quite as long, and has never sung or attempted
to weave, even when separated from its fellow, which continually
uttered, when " in colour," its harsh unpleasant song, and was
an indefatigable weaver when it got grass to work with ; it used
to stuff bits of earth in the work. It still occasionally sings and
weaves, and sometimes flies wildly about, as it often did when in
colour. The other bird has always been much milder in
demeanour, though more restless, and less tame. It was nearly
a mouth later in completing its change of plumage ; but latterly
I have seen it also behave more like a normal male.
The brightest bird, the singer and weaver, measures :
length about 6Mu.; bill from gape about o - 8 ; wing about sin.;
tail about 2'iiu.; shank about 'psin. The tail is much more
graduated in winter than in summer plumage, and the bill is in
the former fleshy, horny on culmen and tip, instead of black as
in the full-plumaged bird.
It may be noted as a remarkable fact that, though the
primaries of these birds had been plucked before they came into
Mr. Rutledge's possession, and grew again soon after the
specimens were acquired by the Museum, yet these new quills
were again moulted and replaced in the ordinary way with the
other feathers.
A very characteristic point of Ploceus megarhynchus is the
long tail and short wing; as is shown by the measurements of
this specimen and of Mr. Hume's, the difference between the
length of the wing and tail is only about the length of the shank ;
in this point, as well as in the large amount of yellow in the
plumage, P. megarhynchus approaches Ploceella javanensis. It also
possesses, like that species, nuchal hairs, but so do all the Indian
species of Ploceus , though the absence of these insignificant filo-
plumes is given, both by Mr. Oates in the Fauna of British India
(Birds, vol. II, p. 174) and Dr. Sharpe in the British Museum
Catalogue of Birds (vol. XIII, p. 406) as a character of the genus
Ploceiis as restricted by them.
It is not surprising that these authorities both united P.
megarhynchus with P. atrigula , for no doubt there is a certain
amount of intergradation between them, similar to that which
occurs between P. atrigttla and P. baya, as noticed by Mr. Hume
(Stray Feathers, vol. VI, 1878, p. 400).

There are in the Indian Museum several specimens of P.
atrigula showing an admixture of yellow with the buff of the
breast, some of them procured by myself in Calcutta alive and
kept so for a time to see if they would develop more of the
yellow colouring--which they did not. Had I remembered this
when I looked up P. megarhynchus and found that the types were
in winter plumage and had been united with P. atrigula by the
distinguished authors of the volumes of the "Fauna" and the
" Catalogue " above quoted, I might have escaped following their
very pardonable mistake which suppressed this magnificent
species, by far the finest of the Asiatic Weavers.
Excluding, then, the two very easily distinguishable
species P. bengalensis and P. manyar , typical males in summer
plumage, of the remaining species, may be distinguished as
follows :--
Size largest; entire under-surface yellow, . . P. megarhynchus.
,, smaller ; throat dull blackish ; breast buff, P. atrigula.
,, smallest; throat dull black ; breast yellow,
abdomen white . . .. . . P. baya.
For the distinction of males in undress and females size will be
the best guide, though this may not be very reliable in view of
probable occurrence of many intermediate specimens.

f Chrysotis guildingi J.
By Mrs. H. E. Thompson.
I have lived for five years in the West Indian island of St.
Vincent, the home of the Chrysotis gitildingi , but my personal
acquaintance with the bird dates only from the time of the great
hurricane of Sept., 189S. Before that, I had, when camping out
with my husband at the head of a remote valleyq heard the curious
harsh cries of the Parrots, when they came down in the early
morning from the high ground to feed, and just seen a glance of
brown and orange wings in the trees. But the terrible destruction
of the high woods caused by the great storm drove the birds
to lower ground and even into the cultivated parts round the
villages to find food, and so weak were they from hunger and
from the battle they must have fought with the wind, that a
considerable number were easily caught by the natives, some of
which were, I fear, eaten as very acceptable fare in that time of
distress and starvation. Two of these Parrots came into my
hands. They were very weak, but they&amp;apos; were uninjured, and to

obtain a Guilding under other circumstances, it had been the
invariable custom to bring it down with a gun, so that a perfect
specimen was very rarely secured.
The Guilding is fully 19m. long, and has a wide spread of
wing. The beak is light horn-coloured ; the head pale yellow,
deepening in shade towards a band of blue, green and mauve
round the neck ; the body and wings are mixed brown, orange
and 3 , 'ellow : and the tail shows a peacock band. With the wings
extended the bird is like a gigantic tropical butterfly. The eye is
red with a black pupil, small and, I must say, unintelligent. The
claws and beak are very powerful. No species of bird proves
more clearly that individuals of a species differ fully as much as
men and women of any one race. One of the birds brought
to me, evidently a young one, took food from our hands at once.
He was allowed to leave his cage from the first, and he shuffled
about the house with perfect confidence, and quickly learnt the
advantage of coming to meals with us. He showed no sign of
fear or resentment and allowed his head to be stroked at once,
and I bitterty regret his fate. We were all much occupied at the
time, and by some mistake he was allowed to get into the trees
a few days after his arrival, and he was killed in an attempt to
get him back.
The other bird, which I brought back to England last
month, was of a totally different character. He became attached
to me and to my maid, but to all others, vdiether black or white,
he showed fear and dislike. He showed no inclination to speak,
but, on the other hand, he quickly accustomed himself to his
modified form of captivity. His wing was slightly cut, and,
with the other Parrots, he spent the day on a bamboo on the
verandah, but during the hot hours he would wander about in
the trees and bushes near. He had a cat-like objection to rain,
shared, I noticed, b} r many other tropical birds. He would come
down from his hiding place at once, if called by name. He was
on good, if somewhat contemptuous, terms with my seven other
Parrots, but he killed a tame Dove I had with one stroke of his
beak. He took kindly to cake, but his favorite food was maize
and ground nuts. I have known several other specimens in
captivity, one of which, now in England, became extraordinarily
tame and affectionate, though it does not speak. I know
another, which has learnt to call certain names and to cry like a
child ; and I have heard of another, again, said to be a really
good talker; but the greater number of those I know never
attempt to speak.

My other Parrots were--a Mealy Amazon, a most talented
and charming bird, with a great gift for reproducing native
conversations, quarrels, preaching, songs, and laughter, without
perhaps actually forming the words ; two Blue-fronted Amazons,
very different in markings, shape, and character ; a Yellow-
naped Amazon, a clever mimic ; a Red-vented Piomis, tame and
affectionate but no talker ; a Senegal, which acquired a few
words in a small, throaty voice ; a Canary-winged Parrakeet, a
fierce and fearless little creature, but absolutely devoted to the
only two people for whom he had room in his heart. This little
bird acted as watch-dog to his master to such purpose that the
barefooted black servants had often to flee before his furious
attacks.
With the exception of the Canary-wing, which had to be
caged sometimes lest he should be trodden upon, the Parrots,
though they could all fly more or less, were alwa} r s at liberty
about the house and garden, and would almost invariably come
home at night or when called. One could thus learn something
of their natural habits. I am not surprised to hear that some
naturalists place Parrots very high, if not first, in the scale of
birds. They show undoubted powers of memory, reason, dis-
crimination among persons, determination, resource, sense of
fun, and their power of speech is by no means their only
attraction. I think, on the whole, the Double-fronted Amazon--
a bird that conies to us from the little - known Island of
Margarita--is the liveliest and most fascinating Parrot I know.
It would indeed be a thousand pities if the unique and
beautiful Chrysotis guildingi were to die out, as has been the
case with other rare Parrots ; but from careful enquiries made
recently, we felt assured that there is no danger of this calamity.
The birds are to be found only in the high woods ; they are said
by the natives to go about in flocks varying from 20 to 30, but I
think myself, from what I have heard from trustworthy sources,
that the numbers would more probably range from six to a dozen.
No doubt many perished in the '98 hurricane--the hurricane
which, we fear, completely wiped out the smallest of the three
species of Humming Birds known in St. Vincent--and some
were destroyed by the natives in the weeks immediately follow-
ing. But we heard that this year the birds had been seen in their
usual numbers in their usual haunts, and, thanks to the in-
accessibility of these wild parts and the lack of enterprise
among the natives, their numbers are not likely to be sensibly
diminished in the ordinary course of events.

Having recently returned from a visit to the Argentine
Republic, I feel it rather in the nature of a duty to communicate
to the Magazine some notes of such observations as I was able
to make on the birds of that distant region. I must premise,
however, that my limited time there being rather fully occupied
with business matters, my opportunities were very scant and I
was only able to make two or three short expeditions outside the
city of Buenos Aires. On this account the list of birds referred
to will be found decidedly meagre, and it must not be supposed
that the avifauna of the district is correspondingly limited, but
that the times of quiet and prolonged observation so necessary
to effect a close acquaintance with bird life were largely denied
to me. The country generally is exceedingly flat, and but
slightly elevated above the level of the Rio de la Plata, which,
above Buenos Aires, divides into several branches, these
branches again running in many subsidiary channels or creeks.
Copses of Willow and Erythrina often line the watersides, and
on the drier grass lands may be seen here and there small clumps
of trees, usually Eucalyptus. Along the smaller creeks and
tributaries are usually extensive beds of water plants and rushes,
the latter growing some 12 feet high. About the Tigre, a branch
of the Plata, are large orchards of Apple, Pear, Peach, Orange,
and Lemon trees, the banks of the river being occasionally lined
with tall and massive Poplars among the Willows. The
character of the country, however, is generally bare and treeless ;
I should mention, though, that in the immediate neighbourhood
of Buenos Aires planting has been somewhat extensive, and
besides many large shady gardens there are along the railway
line to the town of La Plata several fair-sized woods principal^
of Eucalyptus.
Lying in about 34 0 S. lat., the climate is warm ; even slight
frost is exceptional in the winter, while in the hottest month
the thermometer may even register 100 9 F. in the shade, but this
is unusual.
One of the most striking features of bird-life is the immense
abundance of Carrion Hawks in the neighbourhood of the
meat factories. These consist apparently of two species, one a
large black eagle-like bird, the other decidedly smaller and of a
generally greyish brown colour, exterior parts of the wings
dirty white, respectively called Carancho and Chimango. The
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.996912953488372" page_id="32637986"  page_num="151" year="" vol="">
Caranclio appears to roost in trees ; the Chi mango seems always
to settle down in the hollows in the open grass land and in this
position has a very owl-like appearance. A long stretch of wire
fencing with a single Caranclio perched on each post, motionless,
but with its large black wings half outspread to dry in the sun
is a quaint and not unusual sight in the morning.
On telegraph wires may often be seen flocks of what I
took to be Swallows, similar in colouring to our species but
considerably larger in size. On one occasion I noticed these
birds darting about under a wooden bridge over a creek, and
suspected nests but failed to find any. Generally their move-
ments were in all respects Swallow - like, especially when
skimming over the surface of pond or river hawking for insects.
Of course Tyrants occupy a prominent position in the
avifauna of the country. At the head of these must be placed
the Scissors-Tail Tyrant (Milviilits tyrannus ); its colouring is,
indeed, quiet enough, white beneath, greyish above with black
head and tail, but the outer feathers of the tail are prolonged to
about a foot in length and it is in this that the striking appearance
of the bird lies. When resting, which it usually does in some
prominent position, the tail remains closed, but on taking wing
the feathers are widely extended forming a most graceful object.
Tike others of their kind these birds have irritable tempers and
a high courage ; should a Caranclio venture to alight on a tree
already occupied by one or more pairs of Scissors Tails, they will
attack him with great fury and pursue him for a considerable
distance with contumely and blows. Though this is I believe
supposed to be a purely insectivorous species, I once saw an
individual hard at work eating Elderberries.
The Sulphur Tyrant (Tyrannus sulfuratus) is also a very
common species, and goes by the names of " Bicho feo " or
" Bien te veo " both representing its cry. On one occasion
rowing on the Tigre in the evening, some tall Poplars on either
side of the river were full of them and the air resounded with
their loud cries, answering calls could be heard from the distance
and gradually approaching as others came in from their hunting
grounds to roost. These birds are said by Mr. Hudson to eat
small Snakes, seizing them by the tail and killing them against
a branch or stone.
Among the tall rushes in the creeks is the place to look
for the handsome Red-headed Starling (' Amblyrhamphus
holosericeus ), usually in small flocks of about ten individuals.
On the wing the head is carried stretched out well in front and

<bodyText confidence="0.992809255813954" page_id="32637987"  page_num="152" year="" vol="">
is very conspicuous. I have had one of this species for about
two years in an indoor aviary, and find it easily kept on ordinary
soft food, and a decidedly entertaining bird.
Also among reed beds is to be seen occasionally a smaller
Starling like bird, black with half the wings, beak, and cheeks
white; it only occurs singly and is shy and difficult to observe
closely. It has a rather melodious note. Here too the Yellow-
shouldered Starling (Aglacus thilius) occurs somewhat sparingly.
The Chingolo Song Sparrow (Zonotrichia pileata ) is a very
common bird on the grass lands, and is constantly seen perching
on the wire fences along the woodsides. Of Finches, I only
recognised the Green Cardinal, Diuca, and a species of Sycalis,
probably both A. arvensis and A. pelzelni.
The Spur Wing Lapwing is frequent in pairs on the open
ground. They go by the native name of Tern teru. These birds
guard their particular domain with great jealousy, and should
you trespass on their land they will pursue you, shrieking wildly,
as they circle round your head almost striking you with their
wings; it is said, indeed that they will sometimes inflict a not
inconsiderable wound with the spurs with which their wings are
armed.
In wet places I saw small flocks of Ibis-like birds, about
the size of the Glossy Ibis, but blacker in colour and rather
clumsier in build ; they were rather shy, and it was not possible to
get a very close view of them. Of Cranes, I noticed two species ;
one black, the other grey and white. The latter was often a very
conspicuous object perched on the top of some low tree or bush.
I once caught sight of a Kingfisher, but it was only a momentary
glimpse in the shade, and I could not distinguish its colouring.
Pigeons and Doves were abundant, but I have never been
interested in these birds and could give no guess as to their
identity.
I must not omit to mention the Rhea, though those I saw
were not wild but in a state of semi-domestication in a large
park, which, however, gave all the effect of wildness to these
noble looking birds.
I saw no Tanagers or Humming Birds, though I was told
that the latter are very frequently to be seen about flowering
trees and shrubs in the hot weather in January and February.
Occasionally I observed a little brownish bird flitting about in
the shade of shrubs, probably one of the Wood Hewers.
As an ardent Aviculturist, I, of course, diligently fre-
quented the bird shops of Buenos Aires, of which there are

many, hoping to light on the White Banded Mocking Bird, or
perhaps a nice cage full of Red Crested Finches. But my in-
dustry was in vain. There were Cardinals by the hundreds,
Black Headed Siskins in scores, numbers of a Mocking Bird
from Paraguay, hardly distinguishable from the N. American
species, and any quantity of Canaries, besides S. African Weavers
and Waxbills, but nothing of any interest. Of course the Sis-
kins are interesting, but I did not feel at all tempted to risk
bringing these delicate birds for a month's voyage, to arrive in
England in January. There were a good many also of a species
of Spermophila, something like the Fined Finch but duller in
colour and not very attractive, but these mostly appeared to be
in very uncertain health. I looked in vain for Tanagers or ai^
interesting soft-billed birds.
THE WOOD-SWALLOW SHRIKES.
(Artamus).
By Henry J. Furejames.
Aviculturists who have, in the pursuit of their hobby,
been led from time to time to try their hands at the. keeping
in captivity of many different species of birds will, even if
their efforts have been confined to British birds, have found
from their own experience, that some kinds are quite easy to
keep in health and comparative happiness in cages, some kinds
difficult, and some kinds impossible. In the latter category
must emphatically be classed the Kingfisher and the Swallow.
With regard to the first of these I am happy to say I do not
write from personal experience, as I have profited by the known
failure of others and have never tried to keep an English
Kingfisher. Of the keeping, or, rather, the endeavour to keep,
Swallows in cages, I can, however, speak from the results of
my own attempts, as well as from what I have known of the
fate of the unfortunate specimens seen in the past at our bird-
shows. In this connection I should like to congratulate the
National British Bird and Mule Club upon the evident result
of their action in striking out the Swallow tribe from their
original list of cage birds, inasmuch as that during the past
season I think I have only seen one Swallow at a bird-show,
whereas, until quite recently, a Eondon show was rarely to be
found at which the species was unrepresented by at least two
or three unfortunate examples. I am ready to acknowledge
that I have myself been a sinner in trying to keep these beautiful

birds in captivity. I have tried old birds, young birds, and
even hand-reared birds, but I have never been able to get them
through the moult, although I have had several that seemed
outwardly quite reconciled to cage life, and that would feed
from the hand. When one considers how a Swallow sustains
itself in a state of Nature, namely, by taking innumerable
infinitesimal insects on the wing, at the cost of incessant
exercise, and contrasts this with the way it must, perforce, be
fed in a cage by having a portion of " food " (mostly a stodgy
mixture of indigestible rubbish, or, at the best, only a few
coarse insects and mealworms) dumped down before it daily
(perchance, if its owner is specially attentive, twice daily) to
eat or leave as it may, it is very easy to understand the utter
impossibility of keeping these birds in cages.
If we admit not only the difficulty, but practically the
impossibility of keeping English Kingfishers and Swallows in
cages it will be all the more curious to note that there are
Australian representatives of very similar birds which are quite
easy to keep in health and beauty in a cage. I refer to the
Sacred Kingfisher and the Wood-Swallows, or, more properly,
the Wood-Swallow Shrikes. True, neither of these belongs
respectively to the same genus as the English bird, the Sacred
Kingfisher being Halcyon sancta, while the English Kingfisher
is of course Alcedo ispida , and the Wood-Swallow Shrikes are
Artami of various kinds, our Swallow being of the Hirundo
family. After the very interesting article upon the Sacred
Kingfisher by Mr. Seth-Smith in the April number of the
"Avicultural Magazine" I feel that I cannot add anything in
respect of these birds, especially as I have not been so fortunate
with my pair as Mr. Seth-Smith has been with his. The Wood-
Swallow Shrikes, however, have so many characteristics of our
own Summer visitor Hirundo rustica that I may be excused
for having made mention of the latter as an introduction to the
following lines upon my experience of the former as cage birds.
Unless the Zoological Society has acquired specimens
since its list published in 1896 the Artamus genus has only
been represented by A. siiperciliosus, the White-eyebrowed
Wood Swallow Shrike. A pair of these appear to have been
presented to the Society in 1S66 by the Acclimatization Society
of Melbourne. A pair is scheduled as " Bred in the Gardens,
1870," evidently from the 1866 birds, and a fifth specimen
was " Purchased 1875."
Besides Artamus superciliosus, several species of the

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.998126465116279" page_id="32637990"  page_num="155" year="" vol="">
genus have been described from time to time, notably the
Dusky Wood Swallow ( A . sordidus), The Masked Wood Swallow
(A personatus), the Grey-breasted Wood Swallow (A. cutereus),
the largest of the genus, the Little Wood-Swallow ( A. minor)
a miniature copy of A. cinereus, and the White-rumped Wood-
Swallow (. A. leucopygialis).
About two years ago a friend of mine, a member of the
Avicnltural Society, brought with him from Australia two pairs
of the Dusky Wood-Swallow Shrike, one pair being old birds,
and the other the young taken with the old birds in the nest.
I bought the parent birds, but declined their offspring, as
these appeared to have suffered considerably from the fact that
my friend's stock of mealworms had given out at Port Said.
I believe that this identical pair of young birds are now doing
well with our esteemed member, Mr. Fillmer. I have still my
old pair, and also three other pairs brought over by the same
importer on his next journey (some nine months ago), so that
I have what I presume is the unique experience of possessing
no less than eight of these birds and all well. They have been
kept all together in a large open cage with wire top as well
as sides, and they spend quite a considerable portion of their
time hanging head downwards from the top of the cage. They-
roost as closely as possible together, always head downwards.
When I had my first pair I soon noticed that if anything was
accidentally left on the top of their cage they invariably roosted
directly underneath it, so their cage now is always provided
with a piece of flannel which is evidently appreciated. Some
idea of the way these birds nestle together at night may be
gathered when I state that, when I had only one pair, a Zosterops
that was kept in the cage with them invariably slept actually
between the two inverted bodies of the Wood-Swallows.
One authority (Gilbert) says that they hang from the
under branches of trees like bees swarming until the cluster
approaches sometimes the size of a bushel basket. Mr. Gould,
however, writes that they roost under the branches in groups
of eight or ten birds, and that from time to time an individual
member will leave its position and dart away in pursuit of
insects, returning to its place soon after. The latter appears
to be more likely, as I have never seen my birds hang the
one from the other.
Their food is just the ordinary "insectivorous" food such
as supplied to my other insectivorous birds, and although their
water is given them in an open porcelain dish, they never bathe.

Dr. Brehrn gives a long chapter purporting to be upon
A. sordidus, but the description would appear to refer to a
different bird to mine, as it mentions the bird as being "reddish
grey on the body and with dark bluish-black wings and tail,"
and states that " the hen is smaller than the cock, and presents
a spotted appearance on the back, the feathers on that part
having a dirty white streak upon their shafts." The colour
of the "surface of the body," whatever part of the bird that
may be, is given as being " a mixture of white and brown."
It will be noticed that in one line the bird is described as being
"reddish grey on the body" and in another the "surface of the
body" is stated to be "a mixture of white and brown." I
suppose a mixture of white and brown would produce something
of a " reddish grey," but the description does not fit my birds,
which are of an almost uniform slate colour, darkening to
nearly black on the wings and tail. The first primary is
entirely dark, but the outer web of the second, third, and
fourth is white, as also are the tips of the tail feathers, except
the two in the centre. I absolute^ fail to distinguish between
the sexes either in the matter of size or colour, and when I
have exhibited a " pair," which has been frequently, I have
simply caught out two at random, and sent them to a show
with no other preparation than perhaps washing their primaries
and tail feathers with a shaving brush.
Their call is an exact imitation of the distant cry of an
Oyster-catcher on a beach, and their song, though very quiet,
is quite a pretty attempt at minstrelsy.
Since the foregoing article was written, two pairs each
of A. supe 7 &amp;apos;ciliosus and A. personatus have been imported. I
have procured one pair of each, and the others have gone to
the Zoological Gardens. I have of course not had them long
enough to write much of them as cage birds, but I have thought
that a short description of them might not be without interest.
Unlike the Dusky Wood Swallow, the sexes of the White-
eyebrowed and of the Masked are easily distinguished. The
cock of the Masked Wood-Swallow is grey above and greyish-
white underneath, the throat and face to just above the eyes
being covered with a dense black mask. The grey becomes
darker on the wings and tail, but there is no other black on
the bird than the well-defined black mask which gives it its
name. The wing feathers, except the first two primaries are
very lightly edged at their tips with light grey, which appears
as a fine lacing when the bird is at rest. The tail-feathers are
tipped with the same grey.

The hen is slightly smaller, and her markings are a
subdued copy of those of the cock; the "mask" is only just
visible as a darker patch of grey than her back plumage ; the
breast also is not of so pure a grey as that of the cock.
The White-eyebrowed is a little darker in body plumage
than the Masked, and the cock bird has just such a suggestion
of a mask as has the hen of the Masked Wood-Swallow. It
has the same grey edging to the tips of the wing feathers, but
no grey tips to the tail. Each wing-covert is marked with a
tiny triangular patch of light grey, and these, when the wings
are closed make quite a pretty "spangling." The breast is of
a ruddy brown. A well defined white superciliary streak, which
is the only white in the bird's plumage, gives it its name.
As in the case of the Masked Wood-Swallow the hen is
a subdued copy of her mate. The white eyebrow is only just a
suggestion, and the spangling on the wings is missing.
The same Shrike-like beak, slate color for half its length
shading to black at the tip, and the same strong slate-colored legs
and feet are common to all three varieties.
A most remarkable difference in habit is that while the
Dusky Wood-Swallows spend all night and a considerable
portion of the day hanging, as described, from the top of their
cage, the other two varieties show no trace of such a tendency,
but use their perches for roosting as w T ell as in the day-time.

The chief feature of interest among this month's arrivals
is the pair of Struthideas, which have been, I hope only as
a temporary measure, lodged in the Parrot House. The
Struthidea is a dull-coloured grey bird, allied to the Jays,
inhabiting Southern and Eastern Australia. It has a short and
obtuse beak, which is well adapted for obtaining the seeds from a
tree in its native country, upon which it feeds to a large extent.
It is not often seen as a cage-bird, and has, I should imagine,
but little to recommend it; it is, however, well worth going to
see even in its present quarters.
From the last-named species to the Piping Crows is but a
short step, in classification, though a long one in the gardens !
The Crows are now well worth a visit, and the collection
includes many species, most of them in grand condition. A
pair of Piping Crows, which had evidently paired up, occupied
an aviary to themselves, and their antics, on the occasion of my
visit, were very amusing, and I trust the result may be equally
interesting.
The Gulls have already begun to nest, and those who, like
myself, so enjoy hearing from twenty to thirty of these birds
utter their weird cry all at once, have abundant opportunities for
giving themselves that pleasure.
It is, as yet, too early for much nesting of any interest to
be taking place in the Western Aviary, but the birds are all
looking their best, and several of the Doves were busily engaged
in matrimonial duties.
There is a very fine collection of British Geese in the
Gardens at the present time, but owing to the bad arrangement,
or rather want of arrangement, it takes a careful search to find
out the various species : they are all to be seen between the Gull
Ponds and the Fox Cages, and the differences between the Pink-
footed, Bean and Grey-lag, or the Greater and Fesser White-
fronted, may be comfortablj r and profitably studied.
In the Fish House the chief item of interest for this
month was going on, nameljq the mating of a pair of Knots.

Although this small wader is very common on our coasts, and is
frequently kept in captivity, where it thrives remarkably well, it
has never been known to breed when in captivity, nor have its
eggs ever been brought home from its breeding haunts in the
North of Arctic America. Young birds just hatched have been
obtained, and, on one occasion, a nest of eggs, but the latter
were lost in a shipwreck before reaching England. It would
thus be most interesting if these birds which have paired could
be induced to lay, but personally I have not much hope on
the subject as the place they are in, though not unsuitable in
itself, is far too crowded with other Waders, Puffins, Terns, etc.
The Knot, which is grey in winter, follows the example of many
of its kind and gets red in summer, but this particular pair
were by no means in full plumage; my attention was first drawn
to them by their note, which was quite different from the usual
winter call, but which, from the short time I watched them,
I cannot attempt to describe.

CORRESPONDENCE.
" TREATMENT OF a BIRD IN SICKNESS."
Sir, --In the February number, under the repty to "Treatment of a
Bird in Sickness," I quite agree with the last paragraph.
It is just twenty-one years ago since I bought some Budgerigars from
the late Anton H. Jamracli. Not knowing anything of the treatment of
foreign birds, I asked him what could be done if the birds became ill. He
replied " Nothing." I must say that his advice was correct, for when first

commencing to keep birds, I tried various so-called remedies on newly-
imported ones, when the} 7 became " puffy," but it was labour in vain.
W. T. CaTPEUGH.
A STRANGE BREEDING-PEACE FOR MEALWORMS.
Sir, --When my bird-room recently underwent a " spring cleaning,"
I turned out several nest-boxes which had been hanging in one of the
aviaries for a year or two (certainly not more than two years). They were
the ordinary cigar-box nests, and were hanging about nine feet from the
floor. They were, of course, stuffed full of nesting material, but I was
surprised to notice among this a very considerable number of fine meal-
worms. There were so many that it was well worth while to go carefully
through the rubbish and pick them out, and by doing so I secured about
2CO. The birds in this aviary were not supplied with mealworms, and I can
only suppose that the beetles flew up to the nests and laid their eggs there.
Horatio R. Fiermer.
THE SHAMA.
Sir, --Agreeing entirely with Mr. Pliillipps in his estimate of the
vSllama's merits, I dissent as to one or two points of treatment.
My bird has come gradually to decline mealworms, apparently finding
the tough skin a hindrance. He pinches and mumbles the worm (or used
to) sipping up the fluid so outsqueezed. The pupa state is rather more
acceptable, and when the beetle emerges it is taken readily ; but cockr
roaches are the one thing needful, my bird swallowed 40 fairly big ones in
a day. No doubt living insects would be most enjoyable, but in our
establishment scalding is practised in deference to worldly prejudice.
I have heard or read that the Sliatna, in his own country, feeds or is
fed on grasshoppers, and our Blattu belongs to a nearly allied family of
insects. Failing insect food entirely, shreds of meat, preferably raw and
lean, are acceptable; ants' pupae, wet or dry, were seldom partaken of.
Going back to mealworms--Does everybody know that their culture
depends materially on warmth ? Mine are in a tin box very near to a stove,
and progress is evidenced by the abundant exuviae.
Also I supply the Sliama with the flower tufts of the small wayside
grass (Poa annua) which blooms for eight or nine months in the year (bits
of parsley might do), these are thrown up in flask-shaped pellets, including
the external parts of the cockroach rubbed up into small bits.
My two previous birds were accommodated with a sort of cubicle in
a dark corner, as Mr. Pliillipps suggests. My present tenant prefers a perch
in the full light. T. Turner.

Sir, -- I shall be very grateful if any member of your Council will be
so good as to give me a few hints as to the feeding and general management
of Pennant's Parakeet (Platycercuspennantii). I have recently bought a pair
of them, cock and lien, and so far (that is for the last three weeks) they
seem to be doing well enough on a diet of hemp, canary, and sunflower
seed. They seem to prefer the last. This seed, however, which is so freely
given to^ Parrots in Rome, I find no mention of in Mr. Fillmer's useful
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.983131608695652" page_id="32637996"  page_num="161" year="" vol="">
article on "The Food of Birds in Captivity." I hope it may not prove
ultimately injurious to them. They seem also greatly to relish linseed. I
should be glad to hear what green stuff they should be given, and whether
they have been known to breed in captivity.
I may say that, though very wild when first I had them, the hen bird
will now dance on my finger when I put it in the cage, and both birds will
take food, when hungry, from the hand.
With anticipated thanks for any information which your Council
may kindly furnish, Thos. P. Buttivant.
P.S.--At present my birds have shown none of the uuamiable
characteristics attributed to their species by Dr. Greene in " Feathered
Friends," page 183. Can you tell me what is the standard authority on
Parrots and Parrakeets ?
The following reply was sent to Dr. Bullivant :
I should give the Pennants hemp, canary, millet, and oats in equal
parts.
Sunflower seed and linseed are said by Beclistein to be fattening, and
I should give those as a treat twice a week. Ret them have groundsel,
chickweed, plantain, and watercress for green food.
I think Russ' is still the best book, if 3-011 are a German scholar; but
I confess I pick every one's brains who can tell me anything about Parrots,
and am more and more itnpressd with the smallness of our knowledge
about them.
They have been bred in captivity, but I have never heard of their
being bred in a cage. F. G. Dutton.
NESTING BOXES.
Sir, --Some years ago I invested in a foreign-made Tit-box, but could
not induce the Tits to use it. My next attempt in this direction was a
hollow tree, some 15ft. or 20ft. high, which I put up for Owls. This has
likewise proved a failure owing, I believe, to its exposed position.
A hollow log, placed in a large ash tree, has proved more successful.
It was at first tenanted by Stock Doves, but last year a pair of Barn Owls
reared a brood, or at any rate a young one. This I saw in the daylight, and
it was of a very dark colour. There is a similar example of melanism in
the Booth Museum at Brighton, and another was advertised in the Feathered
World last 3&amp;apos;ear.
M3- other nesting-places consist of boxes of all sizes and shapes :
hollow logs and 18-gallon beer casks. The latter are appreciated by Stock
Doves, and in 1898 a pair of Barn Owls occupied one for a few months.
At the end of May one of them flew in at about four in the afternoon ; I
watched them out that evening, and they never returned. Had the vagrant
been searching for new quarters ?
In making my boxes, the size of the entrance has always been a
matter of doubt (a). It is to be regretted that Mr. Martin did not give the
(a). The name and address of the makers, who doubtless would forward a copy of
their illustrated list, is Gebriider Hermann and Otto Scheid, Biiren in Westfalen.--O. B). C.

dimensions from the German list. The name of the makers might also
interest some of the members: it is desirable to know where such goods
can be obtained. An Owl box at 2S. 2d. is cheaper than a " stinker " beer
cask at 2s. 6d., and requires no adapting to its purpose ; neither is a beer
cask a handy thing to get up into a tree and to fix when hoisted up.

MAGAZINE.
Sir, --I cordially agree with Dr. Butler re Mr. Fillmer's proposal
about the Avicultural Magazine, and I earnestly hope most, if not all, the
other members will give their views on the subject, which would seem by
ar the fairest waj&amp;apos; of settling matters. I feel sure many of us would resign
our membership if we are likely to have such an alteration as Mr. Fillmer
suggests. I have alwa3&amp;apos;S been a great admirer of our useful little Magazine,
and I would sooner double the yearly subscription than incorporate it with
matters outside the birdy world. Eeeen G. Barnes.
Sir,- --At first sight, Mr. Fillmer's proposal to extend the scope of the
Magazine is attractive ; but the more the matter is considered and pondered
over the more serious do the objections to the proposal appear.
As regards Mammals, Reptiles, and Fishes, not only are these
sufficiently well looked after by The Field, Land and. Water, The Bazaar, etc.,
but they 111a}&amp;apos; be said to be specialty looked after and waited upon by The
Zoologist ; and not many of these creatures lend themselves readily to be
discussed from the point of view of the ordinary keeper of animals.
Besides these are not birds ; and not the least objection to the proposal is
that it would necessitate a change of name,--that is, the abolition of the
Avicultural Society and of the Avicultural Magazine.
Mr. Fillmer states that " Canaries could now never occupy anything
more than a subordinate position among the objects to which the Society
should devote itself." The word " should " is well chosen,--but how about
"would!" Whether you attend a Bird Show, or glance at a "Fancy"
paper (how I loathe that word !), letter-press or advertisements, you will
find that it is the British and foreign birds that occupy the subordinate
position, -- and, should the Canary be admitted, it "would" certainty result,
sooner or later, in the British and foreign birds occupying the subordinate
position in the Avicultural as elsewdiere. Mr. Fillmer urges as an argument,
" Keepers of British and foreign birds have no exclusive right to the name
of aviculturists," and "On the score of humanity, the culture of Canaries
is to be preferred to that of nearly all other species, as it does not involve
the capture of wild birds." It seems to me that these arguments apply
equallv well to Domesticated Poultry generally, including Pigeons, Ducks,
Geese, and Turkeys. If once the flood-gates were opened, it w'ould be
difficult to withstand the inrush of the flood, and the consequent swamping
of the British and foreign birds.
When the Avicultural was established in 1S94, it helped to supply a
want; and more and more it has done this, and more and more it will
continue to do this--if we are only true to ourselves.

Sir,--I saw in the correspondence pages of a recent number of the
Avicultural Magazine, your request that members should record from time
to time any notable additions to their collections.
In response, I write to say that during the past week I have acquired,
besides the Wood-Swallows of which I have already written, one Fantail
Flycatcher, or Wagtail Fantail, or Black and White Fantail ( Sauloprocto
motacilloides ), and one Yellow-breasted Australian Robin ( Eopsaltria
Australis ).
With regard to the first-named bird, either of the popular names
quoted would appear to be appropriate. It has a fan-shaped tail, uses it
like a Wagtail, is certainly a fly-catcher, and is entirely black and white in
plumage. All the upper portion of the body, and the wings and tail, are
jet black, and the under half of the bird is pure white. A pair of white
eyebrows furnish the only white in the upper portion of the bird's plumage,
and the only black in the under section of the bird is that of the legs and
feet. The primary and secondary wing-feathers when the wing is extended
are really a pale brown, but the wing when closed appears of the same jet
black as the rest of the upper half of the plumage. In size it approaches
the Shtma or the Dhyal Bird, but is somewhat more slender in body. In
quite a small cage it can keep on the wing when it chooses without
touching the perches. I think the bird has never before been imported.
The gentleman who brought it tried one on his last homeward voyage, but
it died on the journey. My present specimen is in perfect health and
plumage, and is an example of what can be done with intelligent attention
on a journey of some twelve thousand miles through every gradation of
temperature and weather.
The Yellow-breasted Robin is just a little larger than our Redbreast.
Like the Sauloprocto it has many&amp;quot; of the characteristics of the flv-catchers,
and the colouring is similarly- divided between the upper and lower portions
of the bird. The entire upper half of the head and body^, together with the
wings and tail are of a bluish grey, and the under portion of the body is of
the same colour as that of our Yellow Wagtail. Both birds are sufficiently
tame to accept a mealworm from the fingers, but I have of course not had
them sufficiently long to say anything of them as cage birds. Before this
letter can be in print the birds, together with the Wood-Swallows and many
of my best foreign birds, will be in the possession of Mr. Glasscoe who has
helped me in my determination to ''clear out," and it is to be hoped that
this gentleman may in the future give the members of the Avicultural
vSociety the benefit of his experience with these and other foreign cage
birds. If he does not do so it will not be for lack of material, as his collec-
tion I know already includes more than two hundred specimens.

Sir,--I believe some of our members have had past experience with
the above-named birds. I have recently received a very fine pair, and, with
your permission, should like a little information on the following points :
First, what is the difference in the sexes? Have they ever bred in
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.908888866666667" page_id="32637999"  page_num="164" year="" vol="">
England ? Would an outdoor garden-aviary be suitable for them during
the Summer ? (I could give them the choice of several from 30ft. down to
10ft.) To me they appear birds that would be easily tamed, they have such
a jaunty air, not at all sh} r . Are they vicious with small birds other than
Parrakeets ? and lastly, are they destructive to growing bushes, trees, &amp;c.
F. W. Oates.
The following reply has been sent to Mr. Oates :
I believe that there is no difference in the plumage of the sexes in
Forsten's Lorikeet, but the cock can generally be distinguished by his
bolder appearance, and by a difference in the shape of the head. I am not
aware of their ever having bred in England. They should do well in an
outdoor aviary during the Summer. All Lorikeets are more or less spiteful
to other birds. They are not nearly so destructive as the seed-eating
Parrakeets, but unless the aviary were very large they would probably
succeed in killing all trees and shrubs in it. Horatio R. Filemer.

Pcirdalotus punctatus.
By A. G. Butrer, Ph.D., etc.
It will be remembered that last year our member, Mr.
Norman B. Roberts, wrote to ask whether this species had
been imported and kept in confinement in this country, and 1
replied that Mr. Abrahams had imported it in 1882, had sent a
pair to Dr. Russ, but unhappily the birds were dead when they
reached him.
With his letter Mr. Roberts forwarded such a characteristic
coloured illustration that it seemed a pity not to reproduce it
in the Magazine, and, after a consultation of our Executive
Committee, it was decided that it should form one of the plates
for this year's volume.
The Pardalotes or Panther-birds are small showily coloured
active little creatures having very Tit-like habits : they build
covered nests in holes, either in trees or banks, lay white eggs,
and feed upon seeds, buds and insedls : there should therefore
not be the least difficulty in keeping these birds in health either
in cage or aviary.
Gould says of the Spotted Panther-bird--" No species of
the genus Pcirdalotus is more widely and generally distributed
than the Spotted Diamond-bird ; for it inhabits the whole of the
southern parts of the Australian continent from the western to
the eastern extremities of the country, and is ver}^ common in
Tasmania. It is incessantly engaged in searching for insects
among the foliage, both of trees of the highest growth and of
the lowest shrubs ; it frequents gardens and enclosures as well
as the open forest ; and is exceedingly adtive in its actions,
clinging and moving about in every variety of position both
above and beneath the leaves with equal facility.
With regard to the nidification of this species, it is a
singular circumstances that, in the choice of situation for the
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.955705" page_id="32638003"  page_num="166" year="" vol="">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.990733186046512" page_id="32638003"  page_num="166" year="" vol="">
reception of its nest, it differs from every other known member of
the genus ; for while they always nidify in the holes of the trees,
this species descends to the ground, and availing itself of any
little shelving bank, excavates a hole just large enough to admit
of the passage of its body, in a nearly horizontal direction to the
depth of two or three feet, at the end of which a chamber is
formed in which the nest is deposited. The nest itself is a neat
and beautifully built structure, formed of strips of the inner
bark of the Eucalypti, and lined with finer strips of the same or
similar materials ; it is of a spherical contour, about four inches in
diameter, with a small hole in the side for an entrance. The
chamber is generally somewhat higher than the mouth of the
hole, by which means the risk of its being inundated upon the
occurrence of rain is obviated. I have been fortunate enough to
discover many of the nests of this species, but they are most
difficult to detect, and are only to be found by watching for the
egress or ingress of the parent birds from or into ' its' (their?)
hole or entrance, which is frequently formed in a part of the
bank overhung with herbage, or beneath the overhanging
roots of a tree. How so neat a structure as is the nest of the
Spotted Diamond-bird should be constructed at the end of a
hole where no light can possibly enter is beyond our compre-
hension. The eggs ai&amp;apos;e four or five in number, rather round in
form, of a beautifully polished fleshy white, seven and a half
lines long by six and a half lines broad. The song of the
Spotted Diamond-bird is a rather harsh piping note of two
syllables often repeated."
Mr. North writes -- " The Spotted Pardalote or Diamond-
bird is common in all parts of New South Wales, and plentifully
dispersed over the whole of the eastern and southern portions of
the continent." Dr. Ramsay writes as follows -- Dike the
Black-headed species (Z 5 . melanocephalus), it digs a small narrow
burrow in the side of a bank or mound of earth, the end of this
it enlarges into a spherical chamber of about four inches in
diameter, which it lines all round but more thickly at the bottom
with fine strips of stringy bark,(a) or, in the absence of this
material with grass. When the earth is carefully removed and
the nest taken out, it is found to be a very loose hollow ball,
slightly interwoven and having a small round entrance in the
side, opposite the opening of the burrow. Sometimes a small
hole in a log of wood is chosen, a crevice in an old wall, a niche
under a shelving rock, or the banks of water-holes or creeks, all

alike are resorted to ; still I have never known the Spotted
Pardalote to breed in the hollow branch of a tree, or take
possession of the nests of a Fairy Martin ( Lagenoplastes arid )
as P. affinis and P. st 7 &amp;apos;iahis are wont to do.
The eggs of Pardalotus punctatus are four in number, of a
beautiful pearl}&amp;apos;- white after being emptied, but pinkish before,
rather roundish, being in length o-6 inch by 0-5 inch in breadth.
The breeding season, which sometimes commences as early as
July, lasts until the end of December, during which time three
broods are often raised."
It will be seen from the foregoing accounts how closely
this and the other species of Panther-birds approach our
Kuropeau Titmice in their actions, food, and nidification, for
although our Tits frequently only line the bottom of a hole
selected as a nesting-site, I have sometimes found their nests as
perfectly formed as those of a Wren : it is true that they usually,
though not invariably, lay spotted eggs; but this is a detail of
little real importance.
It is sincerely to be hoped that those who are in communi-
cation with Australian dealers will exert themselves in trying to
induce them to send over consignments of these extremely
beautiful little birds. What man has done, man may do ; and as
the species has once been imported there is not the least reason
why the experiment should not be repeated.
With Mr. Roberts' characteristic drawing before us it is,
in my opinion, not at all necessary to give a description of this
bird. The size may be gathered from the fact that Ratham
believed it to be a Mannikin.

Pardalotus punctahis.
By Norman B. Roberts.
It is quite impossible to describe the overwhelming
delight and keen enjoyment of a true lover of birds, upon
waking up one morning in a country new to him, where each
bird he sees is different from any he has previously met with.
Never shall I forget the morning of my first day in the
Australian bush. I had travelled late into the night, and
snatched as much sleep, in an up-country shanty, as my too
numerous bed-fellows would permit. I, however, needed no
disturbing influence to make me leave my bed. There were

unknown bird notes floating through the window, and the
delicious invigorating early-morning air of the bush, laden with
the scent of gum trees, was filling my every nerve with an
excess of life. It was no hardship, therefore, to turn out into a
new world overflowing with wonders and delights.
This ornithological Paradise is on the banks of the Murray,,
in New South Wales. During this, my first, day 'up country/
I noted no less than 68 species, many of which I did not at the
time recognise, and, with the exception of a few Parrots and
Honey-eaters in the vicinity of Melbourne, not one of which
had I ever seen before in a state of nature.
One of the first of the small birds to attract my attention
was the Spotted Pardalote or Panther Bird.
These delightful little creatures appear like animated
jewels, with their shining white spots on a black ground, relieved
by gold and crimson. I found them generally in small flocks of
about half-a-dozen, no doubt family parties. The}&amp;apos; - are not at all
shy, and it is therefore possible to watch them closely. They
are always in motion, and one could not wish for a prettier
sight than four or five of these lovely little birds, swinging
head downwards, or performing other acrobatic feats, as they
forage among the blossons of a gum tree for the small insects
attracted thither by the honey they contain in such abundance.
I have also seen them on the ground, feeding upon grass and
other seeds.
I had no opportunity for examining their nests or for
going into their life-history, but the sexes are alike, and all the
specimens I obtained were marked in a similar manner with
varying degrees of intensity. It is possible that the nest feathers
may be different from those of the adult bird, but if so, they
undergo the change very soon after the youngsters ai&amp;apos;e able to
shift for themselves.
The allied form, P. affinis, is a rarer and not quite so
attractive a bird as the subject of the plate. The back is olive
without any markings, there are no spots, but some of the
secondaries are margined, and the feathers of the crown of the
head are streaked with white, there is very little yellow on the
throat, and the only bright spot of colour is the bastard wing,
which is brilliant scarlet.
I think it would be possible to keep these birds healthy in
captivity, and I wonder that more attempts have not been made
to bring them to this country. They are not uncommon, and
inhabit the same districts as the Diamond Sparrow, Zebra Finch,

(Continued from page 128).
Since my last article appeared many members of the
Avicultural Society have been kind enough to write and tell me
how much they were interested in it. Some express a hope that
it is not all I have to say on Parrots, and regret that I said little
or nothing about the Amazons. We certainly in our travels
came across thousands of these birds and a great many species of
them, but I must confess to never having been particularly
interested in them, which perhaps accounts for my giving them
but a passing notice. Although I have at one time or another
kept hundreds of Parrots and Parrakeets, I have never possessed
an Amazon of any kind. I have 110 doubt that many of them
make charming pets, and are, perhaps, far more interesting than
many birds for which I have a greater preference. In the present
article I intend to write about some of the Toucans of Ecuador;
but to those members who are more interested in Parrots I may
say that when this series of articles are finished, I will try at
same future date to write more about Parrots as we found them
in their own country.
I think I must always have been fond of Toucans, for
among my earliest recollections is a case of stuffed Toucans we
had in our nursery at home, and I fear that when we reached
boy's destructive age that that case was demolished by means
otherwise than fair, for the stuffed birds eventually became our
playthings. Eater on in life I became the owner of a charming
Sulphur-breasted Toucan, which only increased my love for
these birds, so when I went out to South America, for the first
time two years ago, and saw them in their native forests, my joy
knew no bounds. How well I remember the very first ones we
saw ! It was in Colombia, in that beautiful but unhealthy belt
of country between the Pacific and the first range of the Andes.
We were travelling on to Cali, and had just gone through our
first night of what we then thought roughing it. We should,
indeed, have been fortunate subsequently always to have found a
sleeping-place as good as this, or even half as good. We had
wasted a lot of time during that first day's ride gazing at birds
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.999130113636364" page_id="32638007"  page_num="170" year="" vol="">
and nature around us. So we were left behind alone and all our
baggage and camp beds far on ahead of us ; the consequence was
that when night overtook us we were forced to stop at a miserable
shanty, and lay on a bare plank for a bed and used our riding
boots as pillows. Our supper consisted of a very small tin of
sardines which was the only food we chanced to have with us.
Not being then inured to such discomforts, our aching bones
refused to allow of sleep, so we were up and had saddled our horses
when it was scarcely daylight, and started off on empty
stomachs. As the sun rose, multitudes of beautiful birds came
forth from every tree and bush and were shaking the dew from
their feathers and drying themselves in the sunshine. Brilliant
green Kingfishers sat motionless watching the stream below
Tyrants darted out into the air to seize some insedt, always
returning again to the same twig; Hangnests were busily
engaged constructing their long purse-shaped nests, and flocks
of little Blue-winged Dove Birds flew screaming from tree to
tree ; Humming birds darted across the path or hovered over
the bushes sipping the honey from the flowers ; little pale Grey
Doves ran along the paths, and then six large birds flew, one
behind the other, from the top of a high tree on the opposite side
of the narrow valley,and flew into another tree just over our heads.
Yes! they were Toucans, there was no mistaking them with their
long bills pointing downwards. At once hunger and discomfort
were forgotten and I was glad that circumstances had caused us
to start so early on our journey that morning; but what a
different flight they had to what I had imagined ! In a cage one
always thinks them somewhat clumsy, but there was no clumsi-
ness in that graceful flight across the valley, and at the same time
it was unlike any other bird's. How I feasted my eyes on them
as they gamboled among the branches of the great tree above us.
I say gamboled, for that is what they were doing, chasing each
other from branch to branch and snapping their beaks and
making a peculiar rattling noise in their throats. One would
throw a fruit into the air and before it could catch it again,,
another would seize it without any intention of swallowing it,
but pass it on like boys would a ball. I have never seen any
other birds play together like a number of Toucans will, and
on many occasions since, I have watched them doing the same
thing.
These birds are also high fliers, and, although they never
take a long flight at one time, they generally pass along well
above the tops of the forest trees. They rise in the air, and
came down to wdiere they intend settling with a long swoop.
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.999819659090909" page_id="32638008"  page_num="171" year="" vol="">
The wings look particularly short when flying, and the bills
conspicuous. They go in small flocks straggling one behind the
other, the older birds (judging by the length of bill) taking the
lead. As a rule, they are not early birds at getting up in the
mornings, and are late to retire of an evening. I have often
seen them about when it has been nearly dark. During the hot
hours of the day they retire to the shady depths of the forest,
and are never to be seen. Those of the genus Rhamphastus are
dwellers in the highest trees ; While Pteroglossus may be found
in more open spaces, and often in banana plantations round
human habitations. On one occasion I even saw a Pteroglossus
on the ground eating a fallen plantain, but a Rhamphastus never.
Then there are the little Green Toucans, Aulacorhamphus , which
may be said to live among the undergrowth of the forests, and
are never seen in trees of any great height, for they feed on the
berries of bushes and low trees. These birds seem to be solitary,
for I never saw even a pair of them together. Unless you.
happen to see them settle, it is most difficult to detect them in
the forests, for, unlike other Toucans, they will sit motionless
for a long time. Often I have had them pointed out within
seven or eight yards of me, and could not detect them sometimes
before my guide had lost all patience.
One has always read in books that Toucans eat the eggs
and young of other birds. Although it may be true, I never
personally saw anything to confirm this. On the contrary, there
was a tree just by our hut, at Nanegal, to which Toucans
constantly resorted, and the small birds never seemed in the
least alarmed at their presence among them. On the Napo, I
once saw a flock of Toucans in a tree from every branch of
which were hanging the nests of the Cassicus persicus ; the latter
birds passed to and from their nests without taking any apparent
notice of the Toucans ; and I never saw a nest of any of the
Icteridce but which was far too long for a Toucan's bill to reach
the eggs. I am aware that in captivity these birds, as a rule,
evince a decided preference for meat, and I have known them
to kill and eat a small bird, but it might be an unnatural taste
caused by confinement. My old Sulphur-breasted Toucan was
never a sinner in this wa}^ His aviary was only divided off from
the aviary of the smaller fruit-eating birds by wire netting; they
were constantly clinging to the wire, and, had he been so minded,
nothing would have been easier than for him to have pulled
them through, but far from doing that, he used to pick out all
the choicest morsels from his food-pan, and feed them through
the meshes. I am certain that one Bulbul relied solely on him

for all the food it ate, and I never saw it feed from the pan itself.
Often still smaller birds got into the aviary with the Toucan,
and whenever they did so he would offer them food. On the
other side of him were the Parrakeets, and he was just as
attentive to them, especially so to a female Bulla-bulla.
I was often much surprised at the poor, uninviting-looking
berries and fruits that, not only Toucans but almost all the fruit-
eating birds in tropical S. America, lived on. It seemed a wonder
that they could get any nourishment out of such dry tasteless-
looking food, as most of it was. It was the sort of food you
would expect birds at home to be driven to eat, when all other
things had failed, during a severe winter. There were few or
none of those luscious fruits one imagines to be so abundant in
tropical forests. The forest trees make a grand show with their
beautiful and exquisitely-scented flowers, and lead one to expect
equally grand things in the way of fruit ; but like many other
things in this world, the anticipation exceeds the reality.
Toucans, like Macaws, choose the highest sites they can
obtain for their nests, indeed, they take possession of the latter
birds'. Woodpeckers are the first constructors of them ; then
follow the Parrots, who enlarge them to suit their requirements ;
after that the Toucans dispute with the Trogons and other birds
for the possession of them ; in fadt, one would imagine that
there must be great rivalry for these nests among non-boring
birds who build in holes, as the Toucans, Trogons, Umbrella
Birds, and many others do.
Although Toucans are very numerous on the Western side
of Ecuador, there are not nearly so many species there as on
the Eastern side, if only counting those species which are found
*down to the foot of the Andes ; for if we counted those also
which are found down the rivers to where they join the Amazon,
but in territory claimed by Ecuador, they would include most
of the Brazilian species also.
The largest but not the commonest of those from the
Western side, is the Rhamphastus iocard, a bird with a rich
sulphur-coloured breast, edged with cream and red where it joins
the black of the underparts. The upper tail coverts are white,
and the under ones red. The bill is serrated, and the lower
mandible wholly black, as also is the lower half of the upper one,
the black being widest at the base, the other part of it greenish
yellow with a little blue down the centre. The bare skin around
the eyes is a very fine shade of }^ellowish green, and the eyes
are pale blue. These birds seem to live in the depths of the

forests, but sometimes, towards evening, they might be met with
in the highest trees on the edges of the clearings. We procured
specimens from Santo Domingo, and other places about the
same level. I once had a remakably fine specimen brought to
me, which had had its bill and tongue shot off (I presume) to
within a short distance of the base, otherwise the bird was in
perfect condition ; but it was a marvel how it had managed to feed.
The bill was irregularly broken away, and this had evidently
been done a long time previously. The Ecuadorians call all
Toucans " Predicadores," preachers, or " Deos tede"--God gives
it thee; and throughout the whole country these are the only
names they know them by. The first name they receive from
the habit they are said to have of bowing and nodding about,
which, to the Ecuadorians, conveys the idea of a preacher ; but
to me they never suggested that. The latter still more extra-
ordinary name is, perhaps, slightly more appropriate, for in
jerking the food down their throats, they certainly do, with the
aid of a little imagination, make the sign of the Cross by the
movements of the head, and "Dios te de" the natives say as
they cross themselves before meals.
Far more numerous than the preceding species, are the
P. erythropygia. These birds we shot constantly from our hut at
Santo Domingo. They vary much in the intensity of their
colours, and in the size of their bills, in both sexes. The bill is
very much hooked, and of a cream colour, red at the base and
black along the edge of the upper mandible, yellow at the tip of
same, and slaty black at the tip of the lower mandible. At the
base of the bill is a raised narrow white border. An average
length of bill is 4f inches, measured along the side from base
to tip. The colours in these birds are very varied. The head,
neck, and throat are glossy black ; the breast yellow and freely
flecked with red. A band of black crosses it, also freely mixed
with red. The thighs are chestnut brown, the rump scarlet; and
the wings and tail olive green, except the primaries, which are
brown. The under side of the tail feathers is a much lighter
green than the upper. The bare skin round the eyes is bright
red shaded into blue, the iris creamy yellow, the pupil dark
green, and the legs and feet olive. The length of the bird,
without the bill, is 13A- inches, of which the tail measures 6 1
inches. We constantly saw these Toucans feeding amongst
Tanagers and still smaller birds. I never saw any of them in
captivit)&amp;quot; among the natives, nor any other Toucans either, 011
this side.

Ranging from the level of Santo Domingo up to the outer
spurs of the mountains, we found the exceedingly pretty little
Green Toucan, Aulacoramphus hcematopygici. The whole of the
bird is bright green of various shades, with some pale blue at
the base of the bill and about the breast. The primaries are
blackish olive, the rump crimson, and the tail dark bluish green
with deep chestnut tips to the feathers. The skin around the
eyes is red, and the bill uniform dark red shaded with black, and
a pure white line at the base, much wider on the lower than on
the upper mandible. This is another Ecuadorian bird which is
found on the Eastern side, with a slight change in the markings.
The difference is that A. albivitta has a greyish white throat, and
greenish yellow on the bill.
I now come to that beautiful group of Andigena, which
inhabit the highest altitudes of all the Rhamphastidce. There is
only one member that I know of found on the Western side,
namely the A. laminirostris. These birds inhabit a region
between 5,000 ft. to 6,000 ft., and like all the Andigena, live in
pairs only. The total length of the bird is 173-in., of which the
bill measures 3^iu. and the tail 6jin. They have a far thicker
covering of feathers than other Toucans, which at once shows
that the Andigena are made to stand a much colder climate. I
have never seen any of these birds in captivity, and yet above all
other kinds of Toucans, they are admirably suited for our
climate, even to wintering out of doors. The prevailing colour
of most of them is mauvish blue. The laminirostris has
the whole of the breast and underparts of this colour, and
it extends in a lighter and still brighter shade almost right round
the neck. The head and nape are velvety black, and the wings
and back are rich olive tobacco colour, the flanks are orange, the
rump primrose, the vent and thighs chestnut. The tail is slaty
blue 011 the upper surface with deep tips of pale fawn. The bill
is black and very red at the base, and the upper mandible has a
very curious sheath-like piece on each side at the base, itlin.
long. One half of this is creamy yellow and looks for all the
world as if an outer casing of the bill had been taken off,
leaving only this irregular piece on each side. The pieces being
partially detached from the bill itself, still further emphasize
this effect. At Papallacta, on the Eastern side, we shot some
still more beautiful members of this genus, the A. hypoglaucus,
and just a little lower down, A. spilorhynchus. It was the former
Toucan which has such an exquisite bill, that I was thinking of
when I wrote my February article, and mentioned it as coming

from such a cold place, and not the A. laminirostris. The pale
blue spilorhynchus is undoubtedly the handsomest of all this
beautiful group. They range up to a much higher altitude on
the Eastern side than the Western side. The trade winds
blowing from the Atlantic right across Brazil, strike the great
chain of the Andes, and the moisture they bring causes the
forest to grow up to a much higher altitude on that side.
Papallacta is an Indian village standing 11,500 ft. above
the sea level. We had a sharp touch of frost every night during
our stay there, and the days, too, were cold and miserable if the
sun did not shine. It lies in the bend of a spur of Autisana,
the third in height, and the most glorious of all the great Andes
of the Equator. Its situation is most romantic and verdant, but
the Indians there have a bad reputation among the Ecuadorians.
Physically they are fine, handsome fellows, and I can only speak
well of them for we met with much kindness during our stay
among them. The village is much cut off from everywhere else
owing to the dreaded Guamani Pass, which has to be crossed at
an altitude of 16,000 ft. to get there. The Pass is only open part
of the year, when the snows are somewhat melted, and is always
dangerous as I know to my cost, for I crossed it three times. We
procured many rare birds from Papallacta, and sixteen specimens
of a beautiful new species of Humming Bird, the Helianthia
hamiltoni ; still we were rather glad to shake the dust (or rather
mud) of this village from our feet. It was from here we had to
start 011 our long journey on foot down to Napo, and the day
before we reached that river, I met a Napo Indian with a pretty
little specimen of the curiously-coloured Reinwardt's Toucan,
Sclenideia reinwardti. Just as he had consented to let me have
it. I repented of my bargain and thought what a trouble it
would be on the rest of the journey. I have always regretted
since that I did not have it, for we never met with them ourselves
and this was the only specimen I have ever seen alive. It had
evidently been brought up by hand.
By far the commonest Toucan along the Napo was the
White-breasted Toucan, R. toucanus. " Dumbiqui " they were
called by the Napo savages who slaughter them by the hundreds.
Many tribes almost live on these birds, and the wonder is that
they have not been exterminated long ago. Their flesh is
decidedly not to be despised, it is far superior to Parrot, and cut
open and fried they made quite a tasty dish. I once saw a canoe
on the Napo which had over a thousand skins on board of these
Toucans alone. The Indians use them for making their dresses

and ornaments, and also for ornamenting their weapons. Some
wear beautiful thick ruffles of the crimson and yellow feathers
round their heads, arms and legs, and carve many quaint neck-
laces out of parts of the bills. This was the largest species of
Toucan we met with in our travels. They vary immensely in
size, and I am inclined to think there is really a larger and
smaller variety, with a slight difference in the shape of the bill.
I have some large cabinet specimens of this bird, but I measured
a male which had a bill nin. long. I had a very fine one given
to me alive which I kept on the Napo for nearly two months. I
intended to bring it home with me, but it died rather suddenly,
I suspected from eating salt fish. It was a most amusing bird
and although it was caught when fully adult, it was just as
tame as a bird could be. Our hut at the Coca was built high
above the ground on poles and had a wide outer platform
running round it, and the Toucan delighted in going with a
flying hop round and round the hut on this platform. At meal
times it would sit on my knee, or dispute with the dogs and
Trumpeters for the pieces of yuca we threw down. It seldom
flew down to the ground below, and when it did it was merely
for the pleasure of quickly hopping back up the long ladder. It
was a treat to see it chase the fowls off the platform, and after
a time they quite got to know they were not to come up there.
At night it roosted in a bread-fruit tree by the side of the hut,
and for a long time after I first had it, it caused me much
anxiety every night by choosing the most open and exposed
position possible on the tree. We were then in the wet season
and on most nights the rain descended in one deluge, and my fear
that it might, in company with other pets equally stupid in this
respect, get washed from the tree and killed by the force of the
storm caused me to pass many sleepless nights. It would
present a very sorry appearance in the mornings, and was so wet
as to appear to have scarcely a feather on it, but it quickly dried
and never seemed any the worse for its nightly drenching, so I
ceased to trouble about it. It would always get so near to
the end of a branch, that sometimes it would fall off a dozen
times before it finally settled down. When I got up in the
mornings it was always waiting on the platform at the hut door
for its breakfast in company with the Trumpeters, a Hangnest
and some Guaus, and each one vying with the others in their
affectionate greetings.
I wonder if any of our members, who live in a suitable
place in the country, have ever given these birds their liberty in

a garden. There need be no fear of their straying away when
they once know the place, and I cannot imagine keeping them,
during the summer months, under more ideal conditions.
They could then be seen and studied to their best advantage,
and would well repay their owners b}^ their amusing ways. I
have seen various kinds of Toucans kept by the Indians of
Eastern Ecuador, and given their full liberty in the forests
around their huts. They never strayed far away, and it was
remarkable how quickly they came flying back to the huts on
the slightest call from the Indians, or when they saw cooking
going on. Among other Toucans we shot on the Napo, were
Pteroglossus castanotis, P. pluricinctus , and the still prettier little
P. flavirostris. All these birds much resemble one another, and
all combine the same colours but differently arranged.
I had intended to finish up this article by writing about
those handsome and curious birds the Toucan-like Barbets of
Ecuador, Tetragonops rhcimphastinus, but as it is already far too
lengthy, I must reserve my remarks about them and one I kept,
for some future time.

AVIARY NOTES.

By Rosie Anderson.
My smaller birds' aviary stands in a sunny old-fashioned
orchard-garden. It is built against a high brick wall and faces
due south.
The house is composed of two thicknesses of wood with
felt between, and the span roof is of corrugated iron lined with
wood ; the whole being varnished inside except the back wall
which is whitewashed. The dimensions are 16 ft. long by 9^ ft.
wide, and 13 J ft. high at the highest point of the roof. The front
of the aviary is wired to within 2 ft. of the ground, and along
the whole length ten glass-panelled moveable shutters are
fastened by means of bars and screws. I11 summer the shutters
are removed altogether, but in very cold weather they are all
kept up (forming a large window 16 ft. long by 5^ ft. high).
These shutters can be fixed or removed in a few minutes, and are
all independent of each other, so that one or more can be taken
down without interfering with the rest. Added on to each front
end of the aviary is a wooden porch with double doors, the outer
with glass panels, the inner with wire. Inside each porch is a
shelf for seed canisters, etc., over the door. Cluster roses and

ivy climb up the house and greatly improve the appearance of
what is only a very plain structure. At each end of the aviary
there is a window, and in the roof two skylights, all made to
open. The house is divided inside by a wire partition, making
two compartments. There is a water supply in each aviary
constantly running, the stone basins being shaped so that the
birds can bathe in any depth they wish. The waste pipe is only
a half-inch one, and this I found would have been better larger
as it occasionally gets choked with husks and sand, and is rather
troublesome to clear again. The birds greatly delight in their
bath, and I think it has much to do with keeping them in health.
Under each window is fixed a shelf 4^ ft. long by 1 ft. wide. In
these shelves are cut holes large enough for an ordinary saucer
to fit into, the holes being sloped at the edge to prevent the
saucers falling through. These shelves are cleaned eveiy morn-
ing, and the saucers refilled with seed, they are also washed when
the aviary is done out every week. I find this method of supply-
ing food much more convenient than hoppers, and besides so
many more birds can feed together at the same time.
At first I had the floor of the aviary sodded, but finding it
impossible to keep it clean I substituted grey tiles, and find it
much better than grass. The tiles are sprinkled with fresh red
sand every week. It does not seem harmful to the birds in any
way, though river sand would doubtless be much better, but it is
difficult to get here and very expensive. At different places
about the aviary are fixed wooden blocks with holes in them
into which bare tree branches are screwed for the birds to
perch in. (Fastened in this way there is no fear of them
coming down.) Cigar boxes and rush nests are placed amongst
the Scotch Fir and gorse branches, these being renewed twice a
year. Two large cages are in the larger aviary fastened to the
walls, but these are chiefly used for temporary tenants, or for
any birds that require catching up and nursing. All the birds
that can be given their liberty are allowed to fly loose in the
aviary, and are so accustomed to having visitors that they
seldom show any fear of strangers, while to the attendant (who
is exceedingly kind and considerate to his small charges) and
myself they are quite indifferent, and carry on their various
occupations just as if we were not there.
Once a year the aviary is brushed out from roof to floor
with plenty of Sanitas and soap, and the wall at the back white-
washed. The first year I heated the aviary with an oil lamp in
one of the porches. All went well for some time, but one night

179
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.990111441860465" page_id="32638016"  page_num="179" year="" vol="">
the lamp went wrong, and next morning--New Year's day, of all
days in the year--I found half my birds dead on the floor. The
aviary was covered with soot, and the surviving birds a pitiful
sight, dirty and terrified. At the time I felt quite disheartened
and would have been thankful to anyone to have taken birds
and aviary out of my sight for ever. Many of the victims were
old favourites that I had had for years, and it was sad work
collecting the little bodies. The lamp was banished, though I
suspedt the accident was due to my own mismanagement, and
for the remainder of that winter and all the next the birds had
no artificial heat. They kept well but the winters were mild
ones and I could not expect this to be the case every year, so in
the autumn of 1899 I had a small boiler fixed under the floor at
one end of the aviary, and piping fitted in the house. It was
rather awkward to arrange, as part of the floor had to be taken
up, and some of the pipes laid underneath owing to the position
of the doors. The birds seem much brighter for the extra
warmth, and the method of heating the house is so simple that
anyone could manage it. The fire, after being mended late in
the afternoon, lasts all night and well into the next morning. I
was told that the birds would probably sit on the hot pipes and
so weaken their legs, but I never see a healthy bird sitting 011
them (except a few lazy little Doves) ; occasionally a sick or
weakly bird will perch there for the sake of the warmth, and in
this case I do not think it can be harmful. At first I had some
wire guards made to fit over the pipes, but I removed them as
they were not only unnecessary but dangerous, for having to be
moveable to keep them clean it was impossible to make them fit
quite closely, and sometimes a bird would get inside and graze
its forehead in its frightened attempts to get out again.
The following birds are kept in the aviary. I11 the
smaller division : Avadavats, Bronze Mannikins, Cordon Bleus,
Green Avadavats, Grey Waxbills, Lavender Finches, Orange-
cheeked Waxbills, St. Helena Waxbills, one cock Cherry Finch,
one hen Zebra Waxbill, one pair of Barred Doves and two pairs of
little Passerine Doves. The latter on their arrival were very
wild and nervous. I suppose their wings must have been
clipped, for none of them could fly at first. They are quite tame
now and scarcely trouble to move out of my way ; spending all
their days on the ground, and at night going into the branches
to roost. They love to sit in a row on a sod of grass in the sun-
shine, and always keep much together.
In the larger division are Barred Doves, Diamond Doves,
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.959155255813954" page_id="32638017"  page_num="180" year="" vol="">
Diuca Finches, Pileated Finches, vSpice Birds, Java Sparrows,
Citril Finches, Black-headed Mannikins, Nonpareils ; Zebra,
Ribbon, and Parson Finches; a Combasou, Diamond Sparrow,
and a Paradise Whydali (cocks), a Siberian Goldfinch, an odd
Silverbill; Russ', Masked, Napoleon and Orange Weavers, a pair
of Black-headed Gouldians, and a Red-crested Cardinal.
Besides these, several Canaries and Goldfinch Mules ; these
latter are very tame, and, I believe, are a great help in quieting
wilder birds or fresh arrivals. In my Doves' aviary, I find one
or two Barbary Doves serve the same purpose.
A pair of Indigo Finches had to be put into the smaller
division, owing to the animosity of the cock Nonpareil, who,
directly the cock Indigo was introduced into the aviary,
tormented him, though he was quite friendly with the hen, and
also with a previous cock of the same species. This hen Indigo
has just returned from having an operation performed on her.
Two tumours formed on her forehead, one over each eye ; one
seemed to shrivel up, but the other got much larger. The bird
remained for some time in this state, but, strange to say, her
bodily health did not seem to suffer. At last, not liking to see
her in such a condition, I sent her to Mr. Arthur, at Melksham,
who most kindly took out the tumours for me. He told me that,
at some time or other, the poor bird's upper mandible had been
splintered at the base. The operation has been quite a success,
though, of course, the place being of such long-standing date,
it has left a scar; but the bird looks like living for years, and is
much healthier and happier.
Of course, among so many birds, I do not expect much
success in nesting, but they are all very happy together, and so far
I have only had one severe fight, when a Saffron Finch attacked
and killed an Indigo. Having thoroughly beaten it, the victor
rested satisfied, and during the whole of the week that the
Indigo lingered they were quite peaceable. The poor bird's
head was badly pecked, and one of its ejms blinded. I had
hopes of its recovery, but one day I found it dead. A short time
afterwards the Saffron developed murderous tendencies towards
a Citril Finch, and one day I came into the aviary just in time to
find the latter pinned to the ground, and the Saffron, by repeated
blows, trying to break his skull. Formerly the Saffron lived in
a large cage with a hen and several other birds. Here he was
good-tempered ; but on being turned loose into the aviary with a
second hen--the first one died--he became quite dangerous to
the other birds.

<bodyText confidence="0.985677948717949" page_id="32638018"  page_num="181" year="" vol="">
As regards food, the birds have the usual seeds : canary,
Italian and Indian millet, with the addition of hemp in the
larger aviary ; here also they like a little boiled apple, but the
small Waxbills will not touch it. Preserved yolk of egg mixed
with crushed broken biscuit and a little mawseed, given dry, is
much appreciated by all the birds ; also four kinds of grass
seed--meadow fescue, Timothy, Sutton's dwarf perennial rye
grass, and plantain or rib grass. Mealworms, and a few soaked
ants' eggs are given every day, though the smaller birds only
seem to. care for the former item. In summer, flowering grass,
chickweed, lettuce, and dandelion. In winter I have tried
different seeds sown in shallow pans, and given when the seed
has grown an inch or so high ; this way of supplying green
food is very useful when none can be had outside, and, being
grown in a pot, it is always clean, as the birds cannot drag it
about on the floor and soil it.
So far, they seem to prefer rape (summer) seedlings to
anything else, the Doves also being fond of the winter variety.
I have also tried canary, hemp, and millet, but have hardly
experimented long enough to say with certainty which the birds
like best. In summer I catch so many earwigs on my dahlias
(in inverted flower-pots half filled with crumpled brown paper)
that I am thinking of trying to preserve them in the manner
described by Dr. Greene, for winter use. The Indigo and
Pileated Finches are especially fond of them, and of beetles,
when they can get them.
In each aviary, a bunch of spray millet is hung from the
\0x25A0ceiling, and a pot of grit, crushed egg-shell, and scraped cuttle-
fish bone is alwa3 ? s on the floor. Large pieces of cuttlefish are
wired (a hole being pierced at each end) among the forked
branches ; at first I fastened them with string, but find that wire
keeps them much steadier, and, placed in this way, the birds
can get at the bone much better than when hanging from the
\0x25A0end of a branch which swings away every time it is pecked at.
It is hard to say which of the birds is most interesting, for they
\0x25A0each have their own small characteristics; but the hen Shama,
the Pileated Finches, Cordon Bleus, Lavender Finches, and the
tiny Passerine and dainty little Picui Doves, should certainly
have the first places.

<bodyText confidence="0.998128810810811" page_id="32638019"  page_num="182" year="" vol="">
In January, 1S97, I procured alive, in Tiretta Bazaar,
Calcutta, a specimen of a Munia agreeing with Munia malacca
in its general characters, but having the white portions of the
plumage suffused with chestnut, and during the present 3^ear
I have detected in cages of M. malacca many specimens showing
more or less of this rufous colouration below, and have secured
some for the Museum.
It is this occasional variation of the white lower parts, no
doubt, which is alluded to by Mr. E. Bartlett (Monograph of the
Weaver-birds, &amp;c.), under this species, in his description of the
female, which he says, has "the white chest and sides strongly
tinged with creamy-buff." But among the rufous-washed speci-
mens procured by me most turned out to be males, while even
the small series at present possessed by this Museum of the pure
M. malacca shows that the underparts of the female are white
like those of the male, as stated by Dr. R. B. Sharpe (Brit. Mus.
Cat. Birds, vol. XIII, p. 331) and implied by Dr. A. G. Butler
(Finches and Weavers in Captivity, p. 244).
This colouration is evidently not a stain (like the rusty tinge
on the under-plumage of waterfowl, which I have seen assumed
in a single night by a male Pintail (Daftla acuta) kept unpinioned
on the Museum tank, which he used to leave and return to). I
conclude this to be the case from finding the other birds in the
cages with the tinted ones to be clean and pure white, and from
the fact that immature birds still showing the light-brown
plumage vioult out either rusty or pure white below, according
to the colours shown at first. I have tested this in three speci-
mens kept by Major Alcock in his aviary, two of which have
proved to be hens, and one a cock.
This departure from the typical colouration of M. malaccy
is no doubt caused by casual interbreeding with the nearly allied
M. atricapilla , and a similar explanation would no doubt apply
to the yellow-marked specimens of Plocetts atrigula alluded to
above. It would, however, be satisfactor}^ to have the fact placed
beyond doubt by pairing the two species in captivity, which
might easily be done. At the same time, in confirmation of the
interbreeding theory, it may be mentioned that Dr. Butler in the

<bodyText confidence="0.995869366666667" page_id="32638020"  page_num="183" year="" vol="">
work above quoted (p. 220) cites Dr. Carl Russ to the effect that
the African Aidemosyne canta?is and its very near ally the Indian
A. vialabarica, which do not meet in a wild state, interbreed
indiscriminately in captivity. In view of cases like these, and
of the fact that extreme forms of intergrading species, such as
Corvus corone and C. cornix, and Coracias indica and C. affinis are
postively known to pair up together, I cannot accept the theory
that such intermediate specimens as occur midway in the range
of intergrading forms represent the parent species in its as yet
undifferentiated form, as has been advanced by some naturalists.
For the progenitor of two given species need not have necessarily
been an absolutely intermediate type, though the hybrid may be
so, as has been proved by experimental breeding. For instance,
we may presume that the ancestor of two species the males of
which exhibit decorative colours, would have resembled the
duller females and young of the existing forms ; e.g., the primitive
ancestor of the common Bullfinch f Pyrrhula europcea) no doubt
resembled P. murina of the Azores, and that of the Linnet
( Linota canncibina) the duller coloured Twite fLinota montium ] .
Yet when these two Finches are crossed in captivity, the " mule"
has a pink breast, a piece of decorative colouration which was
almost certainly absent in the common progenitors of the Bull-
finch and Linnet genera.
Lastly there is strong reason to suspect that species arise
suddenly as far as colour-variations are concerned. The Red-
headed form of the beautiful Gouldian finch (Poephilamirabilis ) ,
is an example, and is especially interesting as showing how such
sports may tend to increase, as it has been found by Dr. Butler
to be more attractive to the hen than the less brilliant black-
headed variety.

This mouth's arrivals, although fairly numerous, contain
no species of exceptional rarity, and, owing to the cold winds at
the time of my visit, most of the occupants of the Western
Aviary were in their winter quarters, and "not at home" to
visitors. This was rather annoying, as I was particularly
anxious to see the Tyre Bird (.Menura superba ) from Australia.
These birds are, as many members are aware, a very aberrant
group of the Passeres, or perching birds, being most nearly
allied to the Chatteras ( Cotinga ) and Pittas. They are large birds,
bearing an outward and superficial resemblance to the Peacock,

and are distinguished by the long and peculiarly shaped tail
feathers. They possess considerable powers of mimicry and
also indulge in many interesting antics, returning to a particular
spot daily in which to show off their natural beauties.
The other arrivals in that aviary consist of a pair of
Wood-Swallows (about which. Mr. Fulljames has already written),
a Roller (which I did not see), and several Sandgrouse. The
older inhabitants of the Western Aviary may now be seen at
their best, and, judging by the volume of sound, many of them
are in full song.
The Piping Crows, to which I drew attention in my last
month's Notes, do not seem to have made any substantial
progress towards increasing their species, though one of them
was running about with a leaf, which he did not seem to know
quite what to do with. A pair of White Storks (CAconia alba)
have nested on the ground under a small tree in their aviary,
and the female was sitting on the nest aud presumably on eggs.
I have nothing further to record about the Knots; the
pair still keep together, but have lost much of their ardour, aud
the affair will probably end, as I feared, in smoke.
Since last writing, the Great Aviary, opposite the Eastern
Aviary, has been filled up with its summer inhabitants, and
several species may now be observed commencing nestino-
operations, viz., Glossy Ibis, Black-headed and Jameson's Gull,
etc. The two Australian Thicknees, reported in the Western
Aviary, have been placed here ; these much resemble our
indigenous species, but are slightly larger, aud in their present
quarters give one splendid opportunities of observing the habits
of this very shy bird.
The following is a list of the birds bred in the Gardens
during the year 1899, and is chiefly remarkable for its extreme
brevity ; none of the birds mentioned are worth more than
passing notice, as, with the exception of the Upland Geese, they
are all known as very free breeders in private aviaries.

THE WHITE-WINGED PARRAKEET.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990962622222222" page_id="32638023"  page_num="186" year="" vol="">
Sir, --I am much obliged to Mr. Phillipps for kindly correcting the
error I made in my last article, in calling the Brotogerys virescens, the Canary-
winged Parrakeet. At the time of writing I was ignorant of the name it
was generally known by in English, hence my calling it as I did, although,
of course, I am aware that another bird is usually known by that name.
Still, Canary-winged certainly suits it better than Yellow-winged as the
Zoological Society have called it, for some Canaries are very pale yellow
indeed. When flying, the wings of the B. virescens do look quite white,
and I remember one day on the Napo, Mr. Hamilton telling me he had seen
some Parrakeets fly over with white wings. I could not think at the time
what they could have been, until a few days later, we began to meet them
in great flocks. When the wings are closed, the light part which shows is
very yellow, but when spread out, the wings are of such an exceedingly
pale colour, that they might be called White wings. Although, as a matter
of fact, none of the feathers are pure white, but the palest of pale canary
colour.
I suppose Mr. Phillipps means that these are rare birds in captivity
in England; as will be seen from niv remarks about them, on page 126, they
were anything but rare on the Rio Napo. I saw numbers of them in cap-
tivity in Iquitos, and the sailors on the boat we travelled on from the Rio
Javari to Manaos, brought dozens of young ones down the Amazon with
them. I also saw a cage containing perhaps forty or more of them in the
dealer's shop I mentioned in Para, so I concluded they must be well known
also in England. I have been out of England myself, so much during the
past twelve years or more, that I am rather out of touch with matters
relating to the birds the dealers now import.
The pair of White-winged Parrakeets I brought home with me, have
now passed into the hands of another Member of the Society, and I trust
we may hear of their having successfully nested during the summer, for 1
feel confident they will do so if given the proper conditions. I brought
them up by hand but not from the same nest.
The B. chiriri we never came across during our travels. Does it not
come from Paraguay ? Wai/TER GOODFEEEOW.
A PROPOSAL TO EXTEND THE SCOPE OF THE MAGAZINE.
Sir,--O ne would like to ask Dr. Butler's grounds for his assertion
that Mr. Fillmer's proposals if carried out " would result in the retirement
of all the scientists amongst our members." I, for one, should not retire :
but perhaps I am not a "scientist" in Dr. Butler's estimation. It would
be interesting, by-tlie-bye, to learn whom Dr. Butler includes under the
term " scientists." His note certainly implies that he would include him-
self and exclude Mr. Fillmer. Possibly if all our " scientists " retired, the
Society would not have its numbers greatly reduced.
C. S. Simpson.
Sir,--A s members are invited to give their views on the subject of
the proposed alteration in the Avicultural Magazine , I wish to sa}&amp;apos; that I

lieartily agree with Mrs. Barnes, Dr. Butler, and Mr. Phillipps, who have
already recorded their opinions.
Surely it would be a very great pity to abolish the Avicultural
Magazine , which, as Mr. Phillipps points out, must be the practical result
*of opening our pages to "other living creatures besides foreign and British
birds."
Birds are by no means the only living creatures in which I am
personally interested-- very far from it --but there are sources to which we
may apply for information about our other friends, and this is not the case
where foreign birds, at least, are concerned.
When I obtained my first pair of little foreigners, in May, 1892, I had
not the least idea how to treat them or where to look for information ;
there seemed an ample supply of books about Canaries , but these did not
help me. I found Dr. Russ' little handbook ; then I was told of the
U. K. F. C. B. S., and advised to become a member; and I well remember
how delighted I was with the Magazine.
Canaries have quite their share of attention and many devoted
friends, so I think that those of us who set our affections on foreign or
British birds may fairly keep our Magazine "all to ourselves," as the
\0x25A0children say. (Miss) E. E. WEST.
GANGA COCKATOO.
Sir, --Would you be so kind as to tell me if I am treating a pair of
Ganga Cockatoos correctly. They&amp;apos; have been in a cold house all the winter,
and the cock, being in bad plumage, I put them in a small aviary in the
conservatory&amp;apos; about three weeks ago. He has no flight feathers or tail, but
his other feathers are plentiful, smooth, and even. I think his flight
feathers are coming. The lieu is in good plumage, and has only lost a few
feathers from the top of her head.
I feed them on oats, sunflower seed, canary, boiled maize, and
eucalyptus (peppermint) seed--of which they are very fond. They also eat
cuttlefish bone, rock salt, and green food (dandelion and groundsel).
They show every&amp;apos; inclination and wish to breed. I gave them a small
barrel with a hole which they have nearly demolished, but are constantly&amp;apos;
in and out of what remains. They make a curious snarling noise, and
appear to be feeding each other. They are quiet through the day&amp;apos;, but
exceedingly lively in the early morning and evening. Could y&amp;apos;ou tell me
if you think the lieu is likely&amp;apos; to lay&amp;apos;, and if I am treating them rightly&amp;apos;?
The conservatory is not heated. They are fairly&amp;apos; tame and not at all
nervous, but are kept as quiet as possible. I have given, the last two day&amp;apos;s,
ten drops of Parish's chemical food in their water, but they drink very&amp;apos;
little at aiiy time, and never bathe. Marion Johnstone.
The following reply was setit to Mrs. Johnstone :
I have not any personal experience of this bird ; but, from what
Gould and Russ state, y r our treatment appears to be quite correct. I should
have thought it hardly necessary to boil the maize for such powerful birds;
and, if they were mine, I would occasionally give a few nuts in the place of
sunflower-seed (change of diet is always good, provided that nothing
unwholesome is given).

It is just possible that your birds may breed ; if so, it will be a
triumph for you ; as, I believe, there is no record of this species ever
having bred in captivity. In its wild state it lays in the hollow spouts of
lofty eucalyptus trees, but always at such a height that it is impossible to
take the eggs. It would, therefore, be well to fix your log-nest or barrel as
close as possible to the top of your aviary. A. G. ButeER-
THE) WOOD-SWALLOW SHRIKES.
Sir,-- I have just received the Avicultural Magazine for May, and have
read with interest Mr. Fulljames' article on the Wood Swallows.
The description he refers to, as given by Dr. Brehm of A. sordidus,
viz. : " The hen is smaller than the cock, and presents a spotted appearance,
&amp;c." is evidently that of a young bird in its nest feathers, and not that of a
mature female.
I have obtained specimens in Australia just able to fly, and they are
brown spotted all over with dirty-white, with the exception of the flights
and tail, which are dusky slate colour. The old birds of both sexes are
without spots of any kind.
I believe that the young of all the Wood Swallows are more or less
spotted when they leave the nest. Norman B. Roberts.

fEopsaltria australisJ .
By The Rev. C. D. Farrar.
A few mornings ago 1 received a kind but imperative
letter from our Editor asking for an article for the Magazine, as
matter was very short. Of course I felt bound to do my best,
like a good and obedient member of the Society. I select for
my article a bird that is probably quite unknown to the majority
of our readers, except from the writings of Gould. Some months
since, I, one morning, got a letter from a birdy friend, that he
had brought over from Australia a pair of Yellow-breasted
Robins. The letter was rather pathetic, for it ran, "This is the
third time I have made the attempt to import them ; but always,
so far, unsuccessfully." The fourth time, however, had been
crowned with success, and a pair had landed safely in England.
Would I have them? I suppose I ought to have said "No ! offer
them to some more worthy member." Maybe I did a mean and
selfish thing, but I said, " Send them on."
This is a truthful narrative, and I must confess that my
only feeling was one of unmixed rejoicing. I believe we
Aviculturists are brutally selfish. I have occasionally moralized
over the selfishness of buying half-a-dozen rare birds, but it was
not, if I remember rightly, the first of the kind that had ever
come. My feelings always grow finer as specimens become less
rare !
A few mornings after the arrival of the letter aforesaid,
the Yellow Robins themselves turned up. They were in perfect
health and the most beautiful condition; and when we remember
the trouble it is to keep soft-billed birds in good condition in
England in a large aviary, and with every sort of suitable food
and appliance at hand, it speaks volumes for the care and skill
that must have been lavished on my yellow beauties.
In shape, the Yellow Robins very much resemble their
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.997987268292683" page_id="32638027"  page_num="190" year="" vol="">
American cousin, the Blue Robin ; and the disposition of the
color is the same. If for the blue head, back, and tail of the
Blue Robin you substitute ashen grey; if instead of the red
breast and dusky throat of the Blue Robin you substitute a white
bib and a primrose breast and underparts, then you have Master
Yellow Robin. The eye is very full and dark, the beak black
and shortish with hairs round the base ; feet dark lead color.
The hen can be told from the cock by her wings. In the cock
there is a greyish, white bar; in the hen it is slate color. My
couple are very affectionate, and always follow each other about;
and now they are busy feeding each other with mealworms,
which seems to foreshadow matrimonial ventures.
For a time I kept them in a cage, as the weather was
bitterly cold ; but in a perfectly unheated room, where the water
was nightly frozen into a solid block of ice. They did not
appear to mind the cold a bit, and always took their tub with
praiseworthy regularity.
I feed them on a mixture of my own invention. If any-
one asks me how I mix it, I reply, as did a certain great painter,
" With my brains." It suits them admirably, as they show by
their trim coats and sprighty ways.
They are absurdly tame, though out in a big garden aviary.
When I go in and sit down, they flit about pretending an intense
unconsciousness of me and my belongings, until they have
satisfied themselves that I am not inimical; then they become
bold, not to say impudent, and hop and peck about in search of
unconsidered trifles, and evidently intend that you should
consider them one of the family.
At your departure the cock calls his mate, and the last bit
of vitality, I see is the couple inspecting my remains and com-
paring notes--complimentary or otherwise--on my habits and
ways of life generally.
From their dress and manner, I should suppose them to
have been, in a prior state of existence, connected with the
Quaker interest.
They are at present living in sweet companionship with a
pair of English Blackcaps and about lialf-a-dozeu Many-colors.
This latter is not a tarradiddle !
Some writers tell us that all Parrakeets " destroy every
green thing which grows upon the face of the earth." They are
" incompatible" (I think that is the correct scientific term) with
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.962012375" page_id="32638028"  page_num="191" year="" vol="">
shrubs ; also they are described as professional murderers of all
besides themselves.
My Many-colors may some day do both ! When they do,
I will believe. Till then I will endeavour, as our late Secretary
once asked me, to keep an " open mind," as open as that of a
statesman uncertain in what direction the popular cat is going
to jump, or as the valves of an oyster long parted from its
native bed.

THE LITTLE FINCH.
(Phonipara pusilla.)
By Reginald Phielipps.

<bodyText confidence="0.998344133333333" page_id="32638028"  page_num="191" year="" vol="">
A description of this bird may be found at page 147, vol.
xii. of the Natural History Museum Catalogue; but not in any
other work that I possess is it so much as referred to, although
its near relations P. canora, and P. lepida or olivacea (Cuba and
Olive Finches) are mentioned by writers, old and new. By what
English name it is distinguished I do not know; so I am calling
it " The Little Finch " until otherwise instructed.
On 2nd August, 1899, three young males came into my
hands, to which were added, on the 28th, two females, one fairly
good but the other nearly as round as a marble. When received
they seemed to be just moulting out of their nest feathers.
The males, which were very quarrelsome amongst them-
selves, ma3^ be distinguished as Nos. 1, 2 and 3. Males 1 and 2
(No. 3 was afraid of the others and kept in the background)
were most anxious to nest, but only with the best female,
ignoring the other, and also a healthy young female Cuba Finch
who share a large flight-cage with them.
On 3rd September, I found the best female dead in a tiny
saucer of water ; doubtless she had been set upon b\^ the two
males while taking a bath, and had become so saturated and
weakened as to be unable to get out.
All my hopes had been centred on this bird, for the
surviving female did not look like living. Nevertheless I
quickly cleared out the males, and brought all my limited store
of medical knowledge to bear upon her; and with un-hoped-for
results, for little by little she distinctly got better. Male No. 1
I had in the meantime paired off with the Cuba Finch, consider-
ing her to be the more likely^ female of the two ; but at that time he
would not look at her : with a wisp of hay in his bill, he had
only one thought, and that was to get out of his cage and join

<bodyText confidence="0.999461325581395" page_id="32638029"  page_num="192" year="" vol="">
the female Pusilla. L,ater, however, when his cage was filled
up with winter immigrants and the time of his opportunity had
passed, he seemed to have developed in a feeble way a sort of a
liking for the gentle Cuban maiden.
In course of time I placed male No. 2 with the female ;
and he at once commenced nesting, but was not encouraged
either by myself or his mate. Occasionally I would let her loose
in the room to get up her strength, and then she displayed an
extraordinary avidity for the flies in the window. Taking the
hint, I added a few of the tiniest cockroaches to her food ; but
day by day, as her strength increased, her craving for the insects
died away ; they had done their work, however, for the health of
the bird had marvellously improved.
All this time the male had been busy carrying hay up to
the top of the window curtains, and had been unceasing in his
endeavours to persuade it to remain in the open space between
the top of the curtains and the wall; but his efforts to build
without a foundation were not rewarded with success, and
resulted only in a great litter on the floor.
In the hope that a nest might be managed before the
winter, both birds being b}&amp;apos; this time comparatively strong, I fixed
a little box close by where he wanted to build, but he wouldn't
look at it. I then placed a wire cup on the edge of the box, and
in this an open nest was quickly constructed. Then, and not
till then, did the female betray ai:y interest in his proceedings.
She flew up to and inspected the nest most critically, but, to the
intense mortification and disappointment of the tiny architect,
condemned it as unsuitable, and would not look at it again. All
over the room the poor little fellow hunted for a likely spot, but
fora time in vain. Occasionally he would slink up to the nest,
as if to try and soften her obduracy, but to no purpose--her
heart was as hard as a nether millstone.
In the bay window there were two eucalyptus trees ; and
just about this time I brought in a third, placing it more inside
the room than the others, for the birds seemed a little afraid of
our quiet street and its occupants, the latter consisting mostly of
nursemaids with their charges and the cats, all of whom were
over-fond of stopping to have a look at the " Dickie-birds." In
this inner eucalyptus tree, over seven feet high and fairly thick,
the male tried hard to build a nest, but could not get the
materials to hold ; probably a " Christmas Fir" would have been
more suitable. I then fixed a wire cup in the tree, in which he
quickly built another open nest. On October nth, the female

<bodyText confidence="0.997777093023256" page_id="32638030"  page_num="193" year="" vol="">
inspected this second nest, and, to the unspeakable joy of
the male, accepted it as satisfactory, and forthwith seated herself
inside. Instantly they set to work building a covering, the male
bringing the materials and helping from the outside, the female
working inside -- the first work she had performed. This
appeared to be her special duty ; and it would seem as if she
had rejected the first nest because it chanced to be just under
the curtain pole, not sufficient space remaining for the dome.
This dome, which was completed the same evening, was merely
open lattice-work of hay, by far the most open work for the
dome of a real nest that I have ever beheld. The aperture,
which offered no peculiarity, faced away from the window towards
their ordinary cage. The bottom part of the nest was very
bulky, being about three inches thick, and came considerably
above the brim of the wire cup. It was constructed of hay and
dry grasses, with some three or four feathers and scraps of moss
and horsehair stuck in anj^where, but was lined with only the
finest grass and hay. Three eggs were laid, and could be seen
through the roof; they appeared to be white, but the light was
very bad. A hasty glance I had of one a little later revealed a
narrow circlet of reddish - brown spots around the larger end.
The courting postures of the male were pretty ; with head down,
and wings quivering and usually drooping, he would ya-ya at
the female, for I never heard this male really sing; nevertheless
as the song of the Little Finch is a "little" song and I was at
that time unacquainted with it, it is possible, tho' unlikely, that
it may have been uttered and overlooked amongst the twitter-
ings of the other birds. But the prettiest courting figure was
when the male's two wings, back to back and nearly touching,
were pointed and fully extended straight upwards. The two
birds played with the nest for some time, and it was not until
October 24th, when the female commenced to sit, that I knew
there were eggs.
The course of nesting, however, was not destined to run
smoothly, for the male was going wrong, and on the 26th
developed an alarming bronchial attack. On the afternoon of
that day I saw him throw himself madly into the nest; and up
till midnight, when I went to bed, his painful breathing told he
was still there. Practically all that I could do for him was to
increase the temperature of the room. In the morning all was
still as death. I went straight to the nest, but the body was not
there. The female dropped from the nest (about four feet from
the floor) like a stone, and fluttered off shamming injury, just as

a sitting Willow Wren, when frightened from the nest, will
occasionally do. The body of the male I found some ten feet away
in a dark corner. The female continued to sit, but very loosely.
The eggs commenced to hatch out on the afternoon of 4th
November ; on the following morning I found one on the floor,
some distance from the nest ; it had been partially opened, and
a lusty leg was kicking out of the aperture. With more zeal
than discretion, I rushed with it to the nest, and popped it in.
The mother, amazed at such an unwonted invasion of the sacred
precincts, hovered in the air close to me in a very pretty way ; I
have seen a humming-bird moth hover in the air in a very
similar manner. There were then two young birds in the nest,
but the rejected egg and its inmate I never saw again. Possibly
if I had removed the shell a little more, or entirely if practicable,
the j^oung one might have been saved. Or did the mother
deliberately reject it, feeling that the two young would be as
mau3^ as she could rear unaided !
For a few days matters progressed favourably; and then I
noticed that, owing to the body of the nest being too bulky for
the wire cup, the weight of the mother sitting in the aperture
whilst feeding the young was causing it to slide over the edge.
Three times I moved it back into position ; but, 011 the afternoon
of November 15th, both youngsters were on the floor, one
moderately lively and the other apparently dead. Taking them
in the hollow of my hands, I rushed to the nearest fire and gave
them a good warming. Returning to the room, I removed the
nest from its untrustworthy support and planted it on the top of a
heap of sand in the bird's old cage in which the food and water
were always placed, depositing the two birds in it, the younger
still almost lifeless. This was a mistaken move in many ways ;
but in the hurry of the moment I could not la3^ my hands on
anything suitable in which to safely fix the nest in the tree. It
was foggy and dark ; and lamps are a poor substitute for day-
light ; the young were in a strange place, and " on the ground "
(a little over three feet above the level of the floor)--and at first
the mother wouldn't, perhaps later she couldn't, feed them.
Until very late I saw her hovering about ; she went up to the
nest at least on one occasion, but no open mouth received her,
and she eventually disappeared, but with a sore heart. I knew
the young could hardly live without food until the morning, so,
chewing up some sponge cake and egg, I commenced feeding
them with a fine paint brush.

the lusty young of our shrubberies and hedgerows, or even of
the Canary, will have very mistaken ideas of the size, or rather
lack of it, of the young of some of these small foreign birds.
The following does not greatly over-represent the state of affairs.
Imagine two tiny beads, one tinier -- no, that is impossible --
one less tiny than the other, joined together by an absurdly long
fine thread. In my case these were stretched out quite straight
along the bottom of the (according to our ideas) much-too-large
nest, very like a duck as one sees it sometimes laid out straight
on the slab of a poulterer's shop. The two beads with the
connecting filament have the appearance of being as lifeless as
the duck, nay much more so ; and yet the three constitute the
young bird. The mother goes to the side of the nest and
whispers "tsit" " tsit." Suddenly the tiniest of the two beads
wriggles up like the ghost of a red worm (not the garden worm,
but the wavy thread supplied by some to the smallest fish), an
imperceptible opening like the eye of a needle appears for a
moment on the far side of the bead, and the whole affair instantly
collapses into the poulterer's duck. It is during this moment that
the mother gives a peck--nothing more so far as the eye can see. I
noticed repeatedly that, after taking food, she would fly to the
nest and give five or six pecks. There would not be any external
sign that she obtained the food from the crop, but I suppose it
must have been so. Perhaps an atom of food was obtained from
the crop with each action that developed into the peck. And it
was a couple of pairs of these filament-joined beads that I found
fathered upon me on the night of that 15th day of November,
1899.
The heavy fall, the exposure to the cold, the protracted
fast, had brought them into a state of helpless collapse. With
difficulty I aroused the strongest, and managed to give it a
morsel of food. It was so weak, and opened its mouth so un-
certainly and feebly, that I had the greatest difficulty in dabbing
in the brush with the speck of food at the tip. But the little
chap picked up wonderfully ; and after a while I managed also
to give a little food to the weakling,--and thus I fed them steadily
up till midnight, when they became stupid with sleep, and I left
them to their rest. The next morning was less foggy, and I
kept quite away from the nest; and from outside the room I had
the satisfaction of hearing that at least one young bird was alive
and being fed.
At 11.30 on November 18th, the strongest left the nest and
fluttered down on to the floor and scuttled about, but I replaced
it in the nest. A little later both of them fluttered round the
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.998404860465116" page_id="32638033"  page_num="196" year="" vol="">
cage. An hour or so afterwards both had returned to the nest,
which they did not leave again that day. I should state that the
mother never brooded them after the fall from the tree ; where
she slept at night I do not know. I should also say that all the
time the nest was kept scrupulously clean, the excreta being
carried to a distance by the mother. On the morning of the
19th both were on the floor, and I could not induce the weakling
to remain in the nest. The stronger bird got into another
eucalyptus tree close to the window, but the other passed the
night just below, on the floor, to the grief of the mother, who
as late as 9.20 was visiting it in evident anxiety as to its welfare.
It was quite unfit to leave the nest, but, what with a foggy even-
ing and the fear of making matters worse by frightening the
other youngster from its perch, I did not dare to interfere.
Little by little the elder bird worked its way upwards, and on the
21st was snugly hidden in a tuft of leaves at the top of the tree.
The same day the little one got on to the lowest bough, but soon
fell, and was not able to get up again until the evening. On the
22nd it worked its way up to its brother, the two remaining
about three inches apart. On the 23rd, both were hopping about
the lower boughs. On the 24th, the weakling was dead. It had
had a severe blow on the head, doubtless the result of one of its
many falls while endeavouring to get into the tree. At the time
I attributed the death to this blow, but later I concluded that it
had died from the effects of the cold draught from the window.
Both mother and survivor were singularly dull and quiet
that day, as if they were really mourning for the little dead
fledgeling. The body had been carried away to the same dark
corner ; and I am convinced that the bodies of both father and
child had been combed thither by the poor little widow.
The dead young one was ver) r juvenile upper mandible
dark brown, under lighter, with the usual yellow gape of a young
bird. Top of head generally, brown ; upper parts brown tinged
with yellowish ; throat, fore-neck, and upper chest, dark brown
with faint tinge of yellowish ; breast and under parts more dull;
under tail-coverts almost inclined to rufous ; tail just beginning
to peep through ; legs and toes, flesh colour, the centre front
toe being remarkably long compared with the others ; flights
brown with 3^ellowish outer edges.
While examining the toes of this dead bird, I was much
struck with the extraordinary sharpness of the claws, which
quite clung to my finger when touched ; but I failed to detect
an)r trace of anything of the nature of a hooklet. Such excep-

<bodyText confidence="0.999500511627907" page_id="32638034"  page_num="197" year="" vol="">
tional sharpness, which probably would not last long, would be
of immense assistance to a brancher in holding on to its perch.
On November 26th, the survivor commenced pecking at
food, and on the 27th was flying about a good deal, with quite a
respectable tail. By December 8th, it was quite independent,
the mother having ceased to feed, and keeping quite out of the
way. It could now hardly be distinguished from her, except by
its more open tail; but a closer examination of the face would
have betrayed the difference.
The young bird spent much of its time in a eucalyptus
tree in the bay window, quite in the front; and I, with great
dulness of perception, failed to perceive the danger. I found
afterwards that, during the cold and frosty weather, there was a
great draught in this place ; and, as might and should have been
foreseen, the poor little thing was soon laid up with inflammation,
and died on the 17th. I grieved much over its death. It's life
had been so short. What good had it done in the world, and
why had it lived at all! But truly it had not lived its little life
in vain, for it taught me a lesson of sympathy--sympathy with
the many who mourned for their beloved ones that black winter
of 1899--1900.
The following are my notes of this second bird taken
shortly after death. Total length a little under 4 inches, the tail
being inch ; upper mandible and tip of lower, dark brown ;
rest of lower mandible, dull yellow ; all upper parts dark brown
tinged with yellowish * two central feathers of tail darker than
the others. Under parts lighter brown, inclined almost to
whitish down centre of abdomen. Feet and legs, dark flesh
colour 1 hind and central front toes very long, the other two
being very short. First primary nearly, perhaps quite, as long
as the third, the second being the longest, and without outer
web ; along the next four or five primaries, the outer web ex-
tended for about two-thirds from the base. There were not any
signs of yellow or black on face or chest after death, but pre-
viously there had seemed to be lines of lighter where the yellow
would be, and a trace of the dark cloud of the male on the
chest.
It was on the 8th December that I first heard with cer-
tainty the " song " of this species. In the quiet of the evening,
b} r artificial light, male No. 1 repeated his little song without
intermission for quite a considerable time. Afterwards, by day
and by night, sometimes for hours at a time, his quaint little
Tippling carol could easily be distinguished amidst the musical
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.998594581395349" page_id="32638035"  page_num="198" year="" vol="">
babel of his companions. On 27th December, male No. 3 com-
menced ; but he never sang so freely and perseveringly as his
rival. The song would commence with a kind of rippling " tsit "
or twitter for, say, a bar, and this bar, as a rule, would be repeated
three, four, or five times ; and then there would come a kind of
prolonged sigh, which reminded me of the " hiss" which closes
the vocal efforts of the Orange Bishop. Usually a little twitter-
ing flourish or other ornament would follow the sigh ; and in
several details the song would be occasionally varied.
If I may venture to judge by my own specimens, the Little
is somewhat longer and slimmer than the Cuba Finch, and more
active and energetic. In a good light it will be observed that
the male--when in full colour and good condition-- is a very
striking bird, the contrast between the deep bright black of the
face and the rich brilliant orange-yellow of the face and throat
being remarkable. The female is pleasing but plain, much
plainer than the female Cuba Finch. She often bustles and
flicks her wings about like the Hedge Accentor. I have not
observed a male do this ; but possibly not one of mine, when at
liberty, was in equal vigour and strength. Judging by her
movements, the wild bird on the feed hunts about in long grass,
etc., for various seeds and diminutive insect life, keeping;
tolerably near the ground. My Little Finches fed on the usual
seeds, of which canary was perhaps the favourite. A little soft
food was occasionally supplied, to which moistened breadcrumb
was added while the young were being fed.
Whilst incubating, the female tubbed regularly--a very
important point in a dry room.
These birds never cuddle together, at roosting or any
other time.
The male Little Finch, in his second feather (as I suppose
mine to have been) is a brown bird faintly washed with yellow ;
but presumably he becomes less brown as he grows older for,
according to the Museum Catalogue, the body colour is green --
which my birds were not. But my most fully developed bird--
before he went wrong--had the upper parts strongly tinged with
yellow, the outer aspects of many of the wing coverts and
flights being almost bright yellow. A broad bright-yellow band
(much broader fore than aft) runs over and behind each eye, and
is connected in front by a very narrow yellow line. Eyelids
yellow, and a small yellow spot immediately below the eye. A
black spot in front of eye ; and nearly all the face below the eye
up to base of lower mandible black or blackish. Front and top

of head darker than body and more distinctly brown. Throat
and under parts as given below. Thus Nos. 2 and 3, but No. 1
who lived the longest somewhat different, although he had not
gone through another moult that I am aware of; but unfortu-
nately the head had been badly pecked, so that some points were
doubtful. The narrow yellow connecting line across the base of
the forehead was not apparent. All the fore part of the head,
extending well up to the crown, was black, and this black
entirely surrounded the base of the bill, and, reaching down-
wards, enveloped the orange throat patch, and spread over the
fore-neck and chest, but faded away towards the abdomen,
which, with the underparts generally, was of a light ash colour.
Some of the black about the face was very deep and bright,--
but it became more dull and sooty on and below the breast.
The chin patch was of a very brilliant orange, or orange
yellow, slightly but distinctly projecting downwards at each
lower corner, like whiskers when the chin is shaven. Thus
all the living and the dead in the flesh, but not apparent in
the preserved skins.
My female at this time was a neat, dapper little bird, very
lively and active as a rule, apparently of a plain brown colour;
but when in the sun it was seen that the upper parts of the body
were faintly washed with yellow. Faint watery-yellow or whitish
superciliary streaks might be detected; but I failed to perceive
any clear trace of the yellow chin spot. On the other hand,
sometime during February I noticed, what I had not noticed
earlier, a faint cloud of dark brown on the lower throat. This
is not referred to in the Catalogue; but it seems to point to the
females of the Tittle and Olive Finches being very like one
another.

This bird is a native of China, and was described by the
late Consul R. Swinhoe, in the Proceedings of the Zoological
Societjr for 1872. He obtained the species in the mountainous
region of the province of Che-Kiang (Nimgpo), and on examining
the stomach found that it contained smooth caterpillars, grass-
hoppers, seeds, and pulp of fig-like berries. *

In 1873, the first specimen was received by the Loudon
Zoological Gardens from the Jardin d' Acclimatation of Paris,
and Dr. Sclater mentioned that it was the first living example
that he had ever seen. In 1893, the Berlin Gardens secured it;
yet in 1899 Dr. Russ (in his latest published work) spoke of it as
follows: " It must be reckoned as altogether one of the very
rarest imported foreign birds living in our possession." In
England, however, as I understand, the bird has of late years
been imported more frequently, and, although not an abundant
bird in the market, can hardly be considered very rare.
As a rule the species of Garrulax appear to be gregarious,
feeding mostly on the ground and inhabiting bamboo-jungle or
brushwood ; they nest at no great height from the ground,
forming a structure of woody tendrils, twigs, fibre, grass, or
leaves, and lay greenish or bluish eggs. The notes of most are
harsh and chattering, though they utter also clear flute - like
notes, which from their rapid repetition and monotony are some-
times still more irritating; indeed, Mr. Fulljames informed me
that a specimen of the present species, and another which he
kept out of doors, proved such a nuisance to the neighbours
that he gave them to the Zoological Society.
The Collared Jay-Thrush is rather a striking bird to look
at, the upper surface being sandy brown ; the eyebrow-stripe,
a stripe at the side of the head, the cheeks, ear-coverts and
throat, white; a black streak behind the eyes; sides of the head
bordered behind with grey ; nape, bright reddish brown ; sides
of the neck black, forming a nearly complete belt across the
breast ; flights dark brown ; tail brown, the middle feathers
uniform, the outer ones with a black belt; under parts mostly
yellowish brown.
This is a rather large bird, about equal in size to the Blue-
bearded Jay, but with a long and somewhat curved bill. The
feet are leaden grey with paler claws; the bill is blue-black ;
the lower mandible largely horn-coloured ; the eyelid is edged
with blackish, and the iris is chestnut.
The above description is somewhat brief, and perhaps
hardly gives an idea of this quaint looking bird, with his black-
bordered white face and throat and sandy-brown back and belly.
I purchased a specimen on January 26th of the present
year, and was unhappily only able to accommodate it with a cage
of about two feet cubic measure. I feed it upon my regular
mixture--two parts crumb of household bread, one part boiled
potato passed through a masher, one part yolk of egg, one part

ants' eggs, and a little Abrahams' food; also once or twice a
week chopped raw beef, and each day part of an orange or a
few grapes; also cockroaches, and occasionally a mealworm
or two.
Whenever it gets hungry, this bird utters a harsh note
something like Werk, repeated with a short interval four or five
times ; then he begins a most irritating, rapidly-repeated, staccato
whistle. When happy, he sometimes sings a quaint, chattering
sort of song, which certainly has no claim to be called melodious.
Not being a song-bird, being intensely dirty, voracious,
and very fond of pulling out its perches and then hopping fran-
tically from floor to wires, calling for them to be re-placed after
they have been coated with filth, I can hardly recommend this
as a pleasing cage-bird, moreover, in a small area it loses the
feathers from the flanks, and is never really presentable ; but, I
should think, if confined in a six foot flight, the Collared Jay-
Thrush might prove a rather interesting pet.
I have tried this bird with small mice, and he ate the first
one, holding it under his foot and tearing it to pieces, but he
would not touch another; I also gave him for some weeks,
chopped-up apple on the top of his soft food, but this and the egg
from his food is all thrown out and wasted ; yet, no doubt, he
would eat Sparrow's eggs.
ODD NOTES ON MY BIRDS.
By D. Seth-Smith, F.Z.S.
Our esteemed Editor has asked me to send him something
for the July number of the Magazine, as some expected con-
tributions are not forthcoming. Perhaps a short account of the
doings of some of my birds, since the beginning of the year up
to the present time, may be of some slight interest to a few
members.
My Chinese Painted Quails have commenced breeding
decidedly early this year, and promise to add considerably to
the population of the aviary. I turned a pair into the outer part
of one of my aviaries, where there is plenty of cover in the form
of grass and shrubs, about the middle of April. On May 19th,
I noticed that for the first time the cock was alone and the hen
nowhere to be seen, so suspected a nest, which I soon discovered
under a tuft of coarse grass close to the aviary door. The clutch

consisted of seven eggs, five of which hatched out on June 5th,
the other two being addled. As I write (June 16th), these chicks
are doing well ; their quill feathers have grown, and they can
fly. Last year the first brood was not hatched until August 1st,
and even then a second brood was hatched and reared in
September, so that if all goes well I shall not be surprised if
this pair hatch one or two broods more this year.
O11 the nth of April last, I received a cock and four hens
of the Australian form of the Painted Quail, the so-called Island
Painted Quail (. Excalfactoria lineater). It is a slightly smaller
bird than the typical E. chinensis, is darker in colour, and the
tarsi are apparently somewhat shorter. It is probably only
entitled to sub-specific distinction. I put a pair of these in the
second part of the aviary about May 1st, and in a very short
time the hen commenced to lay in a corner, under some fagots.
Here she sat steadily and well, and on June 13th hatched out
three chicks, which are now doing well. They are decidedly
darker in colour than the young Chinese birds, and appear in
fact almost black. I supply each brood of young Quails with
an ant's nest or two every morning, so they have abundance of
insect food.
Of Parrakeets I have at present three species of Psephoti
(. P &amp;apos;. multicolor , P. hcematonotus , and P. hcematorrlions&amp;apos;), a Musky
Lorikeet, and a specimen of the rare Yellow-fronted Parrakeet
( [Brotogerys tuipara) ; as well as a pair of Cockatiels and some
Budgerigars. The Redrumps have at present two youngsters,
able to shift for themselves (both hens), and the hen is sitting
again. The Many-colours seem inclined to breed, but have not
started laying as yet. Three young Cockatiels are out of the
nest, and their parents are sitting again. The only drawback
about Budgerigars is their excessive prolificacy. I started this
season with two pairs and now have nineteen birds, the last two
nests producing seven and five respectively.
Diamond Doves have not done so well as usual with me so
far this season. I lost my old hen in January last, and have to
rely upon a young hen I bred last year to keep up a stock of
these most charming Doves, in my aviary. She has, I believe,
two newly hatched youngsters at the present time.
I have one or two young Crimson-finches ( Neochniict
phaeton ) in the nest, but whether they will be reared or not is
most uncertain ; my pair had several nests last year, but failed
to rear any young.

There are also broods of Eong-tailed Grassfinches, Parson-
finches, and several common things about; but it is still early
for many of the more delicate foreigners to breed. I have
noticed my hen White-throated finch (Spermophila albigularis )
carrying about building material lately, so she may possibly nest
this year. The cocks of this species generally seem ready to
breed, but the hens are very reluctant to go to nest.
A pair of Black-headed Buntings (.Emberiza melanocephala )
have built a nest, or rather the hen has, composed entirely of
living grass (although there was plenty of dry hay about the
place). She is now sitting well, and I only hope I may succeed
in rearing the young, but I fear that unless I can suppl\ r insects
in abundance, I shall have a poor chance of doing so. Just
before the hen commenced to lay, I frequently heard the cock
utter his little song quite late at night, in fact often between
eleven and twelve o'clock; curiously enough he was often
answered by a crow from the Australian Painted Quail.
Just before the young Quails were hatched, I thought it
advisable to shut up my pair of Sacred Kingfishers in case they
might consider the young Quails a dainty morsel for a meal.
The day following, the largest, but least brilliantly coloured of
the two, laid an egg on the floor of their compartment. It is
pure white, more or less transparent, conical in shape, and
measures 1-15 by '85 in. I had often seen this bird go in and
out of a log nest, so that perhaps had I not shut the pair up they
might have bred.
I caught a pair of Chaffinches early in 1899, which this
spring have had two nests. Each time young have been hatched,
but have only lived a few days. It seems almost impossible to
supply enough insect food to enable these birds to rear their
young.
A pair of Bullfinches, caught in December last, have also
had a nest but failed to rear the young. Bullfinches, I believe,
feed their young at first entirely upon insects, and I was unable
to supply mine with enough, although there was always a liberal
supply of soft food, composed mainly of egg, crissd, and pre-
served ants' eggs, at their disposal.
I hope others may follow my example, and let us have
accounts, however short, of the doings in their aviaries.

The arrivals this month, which are fairly numerous, con-
tain two species new to the collection, viz. : four Indian Starlings
and five Sordid Wood Swallows. I am sorry to say that I have
been unable to get to the Gardens this month, and am therefore
unable to give any notes on the new arrivals, but the other
specimens which would be worth a visit are the Tiger Bittern,
Black and White Geese, and the Touracous ; the last named I
dealt with a few months ago, but the Black and White Geese
deserve some special mention. They are chiefly remarkable for
the formation of their feet, which are only partially webbed.
The front toes have only a small web at their base, while the
hind toe, which is long and rises from the same level as the
other toes, bears a large claw. As might be expected from such
a structure, these birds perch freely on trees, and but seldom
take to the water. Their plumage is black and white, and their
beak, which is slightly hooked, carries at its base a large warty
prominence. This aberrant bird has yet one more point of
divergence. The windpipe is coiled back on itself as in the
swan; but whereas in the last named it is coiled within the
sternum or breast-bone, in this species it lies pressed against
the side. It is the only species of its genus, and is not un-
common where it occurs.
A slight error in my last month's notes has been pointed
out to me when I referred to the Hybrid Herring Gulls as being
free breeders in private aviaries. Gulls as a rule are free
breeders in captivity, but I believe the Hybrid mentioned has
only been bred at the Gardens, where the same pair have nested
for several years.

CORRESPONDENCE.
A PROPOSAL TO EXTEND THE SCOPE OF THE MAGAZINE.
Sir, --You have published five letters commenting on my proposal,
and the authors of four of them are strongly adverse to it. I am not
discouraged by this reception of my suggestions, because I expected it.
The Magazine in its present form is fairly satisfactory to our present circle
of readers. The object of the proposed alterations is to extend that circle
by adding to it many whom it fails to interest at present. If the members
prefer a small Magazine with a still smaller circulation, let us continue
rigidly on the present lines -- personally I dislike stagnation, and it having
been proved that the Magazine cannot be much extended with its existing
circulation, and that the circulation cannot be increased while the subject-
matter remains so restricted, I urge the expediency of endeavouring to
overcome the strong antipathy which some of us appear to feel for all
living forms except "foreign and British Birds," and to open our pages to
the discussion of (a) (1) rare mammals, reptiles, and fishes, and (2) Canaries.
All my critics, except Mr. Phillipps, confuse my two proposals
strangely. There seems to me a good deal of difference between rare
mammals, etc. on the one hand and Canaries on the other, and I expected
that some would bless one proposal and condemn the other. But 110--it
matters nothing to the ladies and gentlemen whether a creature be fish,
flesh, or fowl -- so long as it is not a " foreign or British bird " they will have
none of it. I can't help feeling that some of us are rather narrow, and
wanting in sympathy with hobbies which differ very little from our own.
Dr. Butler's letter consists of prophecies, and is not wanting in that
positiveness which is a characteristic of prophetic literature. Nothing but
a trial of 1113&amp;apos; proposals can prove or disprove his predictions. I11 the
(a) To my mind the chief objection to the first of Mr. Fillmer's proposals is that we
should have to change the name of our Magazine, which would be a very great pity. I am
perfectly sure there are a great many aviculturists, who have never heard of the Magazine,
who will join us when they do hear, which they will do when the paper is properly adver-
tised, as I hope it will be before long.
The admission of Canaries I most strongly object to for several reasons : it would be
the thin end of the wedge which would admit all other " fancy " rubbish ; it would cause
all our most scientific members to leave the Society in disgust; whereas our chief aim
should be to make our paper more worth}&amp;apos; of their support. We should be on the high
road to turning our Magazine into a common " fancy " paper.--D. S.-S.

meantime, as they rest solely on his personal opinion, which happens to be
directly contrary to my own, I refuse to believe them.
Mr. Phillipps' letter is worthy of more serious attention, but I cannot
admit that mammals, reptiles, and fishes are sufficiently provided for in the
weekly papers he mentions and in the Zoologist. As for the weeklies, they
stand in the same position to mammals, etc. as the Feathered World does to
birds--while the Zoologist approaches the subject exclusively on its scientific
side, which we should not do. Mr. Phillipps fears that Canaries would
swamp the foreign birds--I believe his fears to be groundless, but it is
merely a matter of opinion and belief, and from its nature incapable of
proof except by experiment.
I well remember that when it was proposed to extend the U. K.
Foreign Cage Bird Society to British Birds the idea was strongly opposed
and consequently abandoned. I do not think that the interests of foreign
birds have suffered through the inclusion of British birds in the Avicultural
Society, and I believe they would be equally uninjured by the inclusion of
Canaries. Horatio R. Firemer.

ACCIDENT TO SHAMA.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997113645161291" page_id="32638044"  page_num="207" year="" vol="">
Sir, -- I send you the following account of an accident to my SliSma,
thinking it might possibly be of interest should any bird belonging to our
members meet with a similar mishap.
My cock Shama, " Phil," (about whom I wrote a short paper in the
June number, 1899) was turned into the outdoor aviary, for the summer
months, towards the end of May. He was placed with the hen bird in a
large cage, broad and high, and about five feet long. A wire partition
divided the cage in half, and I left it in temporarily so that the birds might
get used to each other before I let them fly together. I put up a nest box
among some fir branches in one corner of the cage, for as both birds are
very tame indeed I hoped they might be induced to nest. Phil seemed
much more inclined to be friendly with the hen than on their first intro-
duction, and would sometimes sit and sing to her.
One morning, when he had been about four days in the aviary,
he was discovered to have seriously injured his right leg, which was
hanging quite useless. My man told me the bird was all right the first thing
in the morning, and when he came to the aviary an hour or two later, the
accident had happened. The bird's nails were not long, and there were no
wires he would be likely to catch in, so we were at a loss to account for the
cause. We took all the perches from the cage, and, after lining it with a
thick bed of hay, placed poor Phil inside, and carried him indoors. He
was evidently in great pain and refused to eat, though he once bravely tried
to sing a little.
After a few hours, as he was no better, we called in Mr. Browne, a
veterinary surgeon, who very gently examined the hurt and pronounced
it a broken leg. As the fracture was quite close to the body it was
impossible to set it, and he advised it should be amputated. There seemed
small chance of keeping so active a bird quiet on the chance of it setting
naturally, and Mr. Browne assured me that if the leg remained or. there
would be less chance of Phil's survival, and, besides, he would suffer great
agony every time he moved. I reluctantly agreed to the operation, and

208
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.9849475" page_id="32638045"  page_num="208" year="" vol="">
Phil was carried down to the surgery, where he was given a very little
chloroform, and his injured leg very skilfully removed with a sharp pair of
scissors. The wound was then dressed, and, after being kept quiet and
without food for some hours, he was sent home.
It is now about ten days since the accident, and Phil is as lively as
ever. He learnt to balance himself splendidly on his perch the same
day as the operation took place, for though we kept the hay in the cage he
refused to go down to it. Mr. Browne feared the shock might kill the bird
rather than the operation, so the garden was searched for dainties to tempt
him to eat : aphides, beetles, and anything else we could find, being
collected for the small invalid. I think this greatly helped to keep up his
strength ; but I should add that for some time he has had phosphate of
iron in his drinking water daily, and is now in splendid health and feather.
Phil sings all day, and makes the best of his misfortune. He essen-
tially loves human beings more than his own species, and delights to be
talked to and petted : so as he is to stay in the house now, and not go into
the aviary again, he is likelj&amp;apos; to get more than his share of attention.

CAGE-BIRDS IN CALCUTTA.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993942709677419" page_id="32638045"  page_num="208" year="" vol="">
Sir, -- Having regard to the difficultj^ of procuring choice cage-birds
in South America, complained of b}^ those who have recently visited parts
of that Continent, and given us their interesting experiences in the
Avicultural Magazine, I thought I might well draw attention to the fact that
here, in Calcutta, there is no difficulty in getting good birds if an order be
given.
In the Bird Bazaar can constantly be found, as one would expect, the
best-known Indian cage-birds: such as various kinds of Mynahs, Bulbuls,
Parrots, Weavers, Mannikins,Waxbills, Sliamas, and Dhyals; together with,
generally, Green Bulbuls and Liothrix. By watching the market, however,
or still better by visiting the establishment of Mr.W. Rutledge, Eutally, who
has long been our best-known and most extensive dealer, one may obtain
very good things indeed, such as have rarety or never been sent to England
as yet--I mean such birds as the Blue-winged Green Bulbul ( Chloropsis
hardwickii), Silver-eared Mesia ( Mesia argentauris), Blue-winged .Siva (Siva
cyatiuroptera), White-capped Redstart (Chimarrhornis leucucephala), Black-
crested Yellow Bulbul ( Otocompsa flaviventris), Bengal Pitta (Pitta brachyura),
Minivet (Pericrocotus brevirostris), Niltava Flycatcher (Niltava suntara), Verdi-
ter Flycatcher (Stoparola melanops), Maroon Oriole (Oriolus traiUii),with many
other good "soft-bills." Finches are few as yet, but the Himala3 T an Gold-
finch ( Carduelis caniceps ), and Siskin (Hypacanthis spinoides), are now to be
had in unusual numbers.
Parrots have been imported into India since the time of Jelianghir,
the native species not satisfying Indian fanciers completely. And it may
interest some members to hear that Forsten's Lorikeet is the commonest
Lory imported, and has bred in the Calcutta Zoo. There is often a very
good assortment of Parrots, but not being speciall}' interested in these
birds I cannot say much about them. But many Parrot fanciers would
have been delighted with a specimen of one of the rare Black Lories
(ChaLcopsittacus ) which w f as on view some time back, and was literallj&amp;apos; as
tame as a kitten.

<bodyText confidence="0.99679894117647" page_id="32638046"  page_num="209" year="" vol="">
At tlie present moment, several specimens of both the Great and
Lesser Birds of Paradise (.Paradisea afada and P. minor) are on sale in
Calcutta, and Mr. Rutledge once had as many as four species in his estab-
lishment together.
He tells me that it is no longer worth while for him to get down
specimens of the rare soft-bills I have mentioned above from up country,
as purchasers now are so few, so that there is every chance of this branch
of the trade dying out, as I doubt whether the ordinary Bazaar dealers can
keep it going; at any rate, they have had to sell off this year at much
reduced prices. So that if people really want good soft-bills from India,
the}'- should bestir themselves, and give Mr. Rutledge orders while the
trade is in hand. I have every confidence in recommending him, and
am giving him, without his knowledge, this advertisement in the interest
of the cage-bird fancy at large.
If this recommendation of a dealer is regarded as an ordinary adver-
tisement, I shall be willing to pa}&amp;apos; for it as such.

EYE DISEASE IN GREY SINGING FINCHES.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997078214285714" page_id="32638046"  page_num="209" year="" vol="">
Sir, -- I shall be very grateful for advice how to acclimatize Grey
Singing Finches. Last year I had two pairs from different dealers, and all
died, apparently from the same disease. The first symptom of anything
amiss is the swelling of one eye, which gradually extends until the whole
head is enlarged, death then resulting. I have just bought another pair,
only four days ago. The hen is showing symptoms of the ailment which
carried off the others, and I am anxious to hear of any treatment likely to
check the disease.
I should like also to ask what is desirable to be done in the following
case. A cock Long-tailed Grassfinch has the lower half of beak longer
than the upper. Would this interfere with it cracking its seed properly.
If so, should it be cut down to meet the upper half of beak. In the hen
the two halves fit exactly, which makes me think that the long upper half
in the cock is abnormal.
Asking your forgiveness for so much detail. M. Husband.
The folio-wing reply was sent to Miss Husband :
From the fact that five examples purchased in succession have
suffered from the same disease, I have little doubt that the cause exists in
the cage to which the birds are consigned.
The eye disease is probably due to a bacillus ; but, until microscopic
sections of the brain have been carefully studied by some specialist, we are
not likely to learn much about it. From the fact that it is often associated
with brain paralysis or " staggers " in birds, I am inclined to believe that
both troubles are due to the same cause.
I never knew a Grey Singing-finch to be thus affected, but it is
common enough amongst Zebra- and Gouldian-finches, Canaries, and
Skylarks.
When I first receive Grey Singing-finches (of which I purchase all

that are offered at a reasonable price), I turn them into a large box-cage
with two rows of graded perches rising as in an orchestra from front to
back ; so that, even if unable to fly, they can get well away from the floor
to roost. As soon as they are perfect in plumage, I turn them into large
aviaries.
If I were you I should thoroughly scald or bake the cage, and syringe
it well with Condy's fluid before putting any more birds into it.

PILEATED FINCH WITH BALD PATCHES.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997211785714286" page_id="32638047"  page_num="210" year="" vol="">
Sir,---I should be very glad if you would kindly advise me as to the
treatment of a hen Pileated-finch.
I have had her just two years, and during nearly the whole of that
time she has suffered from bare patches on each wing joint. Her feathers,
though abundant, are rather poor in quality, and sometimes her wings
tremble as if from weakness. During last winter I have caged her, and
given her phosphate of iron in the water, and also several mealworms
daily. At first a few quills grew, but lately they seem to have stopped
growing. I cannot say she seems ill (for she is usually very bright and
active) only delicate. I do not think either of the bare places have altered
in size since I first noticed them.
Will you kindly tell me what the bird is suffering from ; if there is
any cure; and if any danger of infection to the other birds if allowed to
fly amongst them. R. Arderson.
The following reply has been sent to Miss Alderson :
Feather-weakness in birds, known amongst Pigeon-fanciers as soft
moult, is probably due to an insufficiency of lime and phosphates in the
system. Plenty of cuttle-fish bone, mealworms, and phosphate of iron
daily in the drinking water, should gradually put the bird right.
Do not stint green food, if the bird will eat it. Chickweed is
generally a favourite with the smaller finches.
I do not think there is the least likelihood of infection, unless indeed
the loss of feathers is due to red mite; but you would have discovered it
before now if that had been the case.
One cause of feather-weakness is keeping birds too warm. My
English Jay, being kept in a large conservator}', loses many of his soft
feathers at the commencement of the warm weather, and only recovers
them when the cooler season returns. A. G. Butrer.

Sir, --I now enclose two sketches : one of the bird which I
mentioned before, and one of a bird which I have had for some time and
which I thought was the Rose-coloured Pastor (No. i). No. 2 is a much
smaller bird than No. 1, and has quite a song though rather harsh ; but
No. 1 does nothing but eat and fight, and is a most unsatisfactory bird in
my opinion to keep, although they might be better outside, but I am

unfortunately not able to keep birds outside : so badly do I think of the
birds that I shall get rid of them when possible.
When the crown feathers of No. 2 are raised, they give the bird a
most uncanny look, which I am quite unable to produce on paper.
Do you know of any place in England wdiere I could buy chenna (or
grain flour) ? As you are aware, this is the main food used in India for
soft-billed birds, and I find it most satisfactory, with the aid of a little fruit
and a few insects. I have tried several places here, but Liverpool is a poor
place for anything connected with birds : I am obliged to get mealworms
from London, no one here keeps them in any quantity.
I would like to know if you think a few Fruit-suckers (Green) would
pay to bring over, as I expect my birds to pay for their keep. I do not
think there are many here. H. C. Haseeton.
The following answer has been sent to Mr. Haselton :
The coloured sketch numbered Fig. 1, is a representation of the
Rose-coloured Pastor ( Pastor roseus) ; that numbered Fig. 2, is the Pagoda,
or Brahmin Starling (or Myuali), [Stumi?ia pagodarum).
I think Messrs. Praschkauer, of London, would be more likely than
anyone to keep "chenna"; but, in all probability, fine pea-flour would
answer the purpose equally well.
The fruit-suckers always sell; and as I understand that you can
obtain them at Calcutta for about three shillings apiece at certain seasons,
it ought to pay well to import them. A. G. Bu&amp;apos;i&amp;apos;eer.

Sir,--I t has been pointed out to me that, apart from " Panther Bird "
being a very unsuitable name for the species illustrated in last month's
Magazine, it has been known for years in Australia as the " Diamond Bird,"
which certainly seems to me more appropriate. I ..do not know who
invented the name "Panther Bird," but merely write this to suggest that
members when referring to it in future should use the name Diamond Bird
as being the one by which it is best known. J. Lewis Bonhote.
Mr. Bonhote has asked me to explain my use of the name Panther-
Bird in place of Diamond Bird. The species having only been once
imported and the specimens having then been sent to Germany, I concluded
that the use of the more appropriate name adopted by the Germans
(Pa?ithervbgelj was far preferable to that used by Gould, at any rate for
aviculturists. If an aviculturist were to write to an English or even a
German dealer for a Diamond-bird, it is a hundred to one that a Spotted-
sided finch (Diamond-Sparrow) or a Diamond Dove would be sent to him ;
but with an illustrated article 011 the " Panther-bird " in a well-known
Avicultural Magazine confusion would be almost impossible.

HYBRIDS BETWEEN THE PARSON FINCH AND THE

Sir, --It may be of interest to mention that hybrids between a male
Poephila cincta and a female P. acuticauda have been reared in my garden this
summer. The parents have been "nesting," off and on, since last year;
but I was slow in sacrificing the nesting of rarer birds in order to suit their
convenience. One day this spring, in a reckless humour, I placed them in
my best aviary, with the result, not unexpected, that valuable nests were
destroved. When I started for the Continent in the spring, I left them
nesting; and on my return on June 13th, it was clear from the excitement
of both parents that young were about somewhere; doubtless they were
then branchers, but I did not see them. On the morning of June 18th they
commenced to fly; and we had several good views of three of them.
They were fairly strong on the wing, and were being most assiduously fed
and waited upon by the mother, the father having temporarily disappeared ;
probably he is setting upon another batch of eggs.
The one young bird is a very fair Parson Finch, but the other two are
less pronounced in their general colour. They all have the usual black
flank-stripe and black chin ; the tails are short and seem to be scpiare (but
I cannot vouch for this); and the bills of course are black or blackish.
The chin spots, although well defined, seem to be very small.
I regret that I am unable to sa}- whether any female or females among
them show the distinctive sexual mark of the female Long-tailed Grassfinch.

Sir,-- I was much interested in Mr. Fulljames' article in the May
Magazine, and especially in the light which he throws on the early history
ol my own birds. Once again, the danger of generalising from observations
of one or two examples of a species is instructively shewn. My birds never
recovered from their early privations, never got into really good condition,
and have always remained delicate--though it appears from Mr. Fulljames'
more extended experience that healthy specimens may be considered hardy.
A few weeks ago I lost one of my Wood Swallows from that most common
disease of caged insectivorous birds, paralysis, and I fear that the other is
going the same way. Mine, like Mr. Fulljames', never bathe.

Sir,--I consider this to be the most useful covering for the floor of
an aviary in which soft-food birds are kept; but the form in which it is
usually sold is too coarse and lumpy to be quite satisfactory for the purposes
of the aviculturist. Some of your readers may therefore be glad to know
that the Liverine Company, of Grimsby, have brought out a finely-ground
peat, specially prepared for aviaries and poultry-houses. They sell it in
small sacks at is. 6d. per sack, and it is, of course, considerably more
expensive than common peat. Horatio R. Fieemer.

THE BEARDED REEDLING.
By J. E. Bonhote.
The Bearded Reedling, or Titmouse as it is sometimes
called, has always been a great favourite of mine, chiefly, perhaps,
because it is so entirely different in its habits and plumage from
any other bird ; it has a charm of manner, entirely its own, and
is the only existing form of a race which belonged possibly to
the avifauna of a former age, but still holding its own, even in
this country where a gun is never lacking should an uncommon
or curious bird show itself. The plumage is too well known to
require a detailed description, and to any who may not know it,
the accompanying plate will give at a glance, better than any
words, a general idea of the bird's appearance.
There has been much doubt, and many controversies as to
the exact systematic position of the genus Panurus, which seems
to have left the question much where it was. Although rather
beyond the scope of this Magazine, it can do no harm to point
out in as few words as possible, the various ideas on its systematic
position. It was first placed among the Tits by Linnaeus in
about 1765, in which position it was allowed to remain un-
challenged till 1833, when Mr. Blytli, from a careful examination
of its habits in captivity, and from its internal structure, ex-
pressed the opinion that it was nearly related to the Shrikes
(Laniidce). This opinion he subsequently altered, and placed it
near the Waxbills ( Estreldae ). Macgillivray in 1840, from a study
of the soft parts, placed it near the Buntings, while Messrs.
Sharpe and Dresser in their "Birds of Europe" believe it to be
allied to the genus Sphenceacus. Prof. Sundevall places it among
the Viduinae or Whydah birds ; the late Mr. Bartlett considered
it allied to Eiothrix. Mr. Parker maintains that near the Paridae
is its proper place, and Dr. Butler states that in his opinion it
forms a link between the Ploceidae and Buntings. Among such
a mass of conflicting statements, it has been left at the head of
the Paridae , although it is tacitly acknowledged to be in its

<bodyText confidence="0.999061325581395" page_id="32638053"  page_num="214" year="" vol="">
wrong place. Not having gone into the question I shall not
venture to contradict or confirm any of the above statements,
but will merely notice, in the course of this article, any other
birds of which its habits may remind me.
This species is widely distributed in suitable localities,
viz: large reed beds, from England to Central Asia, not being
found north of the Baltic. The nest is placed on the ground,
and is built of reeds and sedge leaves, woven together, and lined
with the flower of the reed. The eggs, about six in number, are
white, sprinkled with small black markings, and two broods are
generally reared in the season. As a British bird, the Bearded
Reedling is now practically restricted to parts of Norfolk, where
it nests annually, though in steadily decreasing numbers ; fifty
years ago, writes Mr. Gurney, the number fof nests in one year
was estimated at one hundred and sixty, while now, at the most
thirty-three pairs bring off their young, the cause of the decrease
being chieffy due to the slow but sure " growing up of the East
Anglian Broads," and also to the systematic trade in their eggs
for collectors. Now however, owing to the protection afforded
to both birds and eggs by law, as well as to the efforts of several
gentlemen interested in their country's avifauna, one has reason
to hope that the decrease may be arrested, and that the Bearded
Reedling may long continue an inhabitant of our somewhat
inhospitable marshes.
Eet us now consider this bird from an avicultural point of
view, and without exception it is, I think, the nicest of all small
cage birds. It is by no means easy to keep alive for long in a
cage and requires a great variety of food ; the longest period I
ever kept one was for two and a half years, having kept several
others at different times with very indifferent luck. Strange to
say the chief thing they suffer from in captivity is too much
warmth, and they never seem to do well in a heated place, for they
lose all their feathers, take cold and die ; while on the other hand,
a pair in my possession never looked in better trim than during
the severe frost of Feb., 1895, when we had six weeks' continual
frost with thermometer several times below zero.
They w^ere kept by themselves in a cage 2ft. by 18 inches,
2ft. high, exposed to the south and west but sheltered on the
other aspects, and roofed in ; half the cage was clear, but the
other half covered with a layer of cement, in which were placed,
upright, the tops of reeds which were renewed twice yearly.
Several reeds were purposely broken half-way up, and bent so as
to form horizontal perches, and every night they regularly

roosted close together on a thin horizontal reed near the top
of the cage. During the daytime they were ever on the move,
continually uttering a soft low note (a), which with the exception
of the loud and ringing call note, was the only sound they
ever made.
They were fed on mixed seeds, hard-boiled eggs, ants' eggs
and occasionally some scraped beef, or some mealworms, but
for these latter, they did not show the marked partiality all
species of Tits and soft-billed birds generally do, and when eating
them, did so after the manner of a Finch, viz : well masticating
with their mandibles first, and not swallowing them whole, as
soft-billed birds ; nor, needless to say, picking them, while holding
them with their feet as Tits. Seeds they swallowed whole, and
did not shell, and when feeding, reminded me rather of a
gallinaceous bird, for on settling on a heap of food on the floor
(they always carefully emptied the dish on to the floor), they
would do a peculiar sort of backward shuffle, scattering the food
still more completely, and after turning their head to see what
they had uncovered, pick up a seed and dart off to repeat the
operation elsewhere.
With regard to their usual mode of progression, about which
some doubt apparently exists {b). I was at some pains to observe
them, and undoubtedly their most usual way is by short hops,
intermingled with a curious and peculiar shuffling walk, some-
what like the strut of the Chaffinch, but with the head near the
ground. I have also a further note, written some years ago,
stating that it occassionally walks, with a similar motion to a
Wagtail, but less jerkily. I will not pledge my word to this last
statement, but it may be more accurate than my memory, as it
was written with the birds in front of me: so much for its habits
on the ground, where it certainly spent a considerable part of its
time ; when in reeds however, it hopped about quickly from one
to another, being, as before stated hardly ever still. The only
peculiarity worth noticing was the curious way in which it would
{a). This note is simply a low and soft form of a call-note, and if not answered is
repeated louder ; the uttering&amp;apos; of this call is I fancy to a great extent involuntary, and is
obviously to keep the flock together, when feeding among the thick cover afforded by the
reeds. It is perhaps interesting to compare the similar incessantly-uttered note of the
Scops Owl, which is uttered doubtless, also to enable them to find their friends in the thick
forest they inhabit ; and probably further observation would elicit the fact that most birds
living in thick cover, have some similar means of keeping together. It may be also noted
that very few of such birds have any distinctive markings, by which they might be
recognised on the wing, as is the case with some birds frequenting the open country,

mount two reeds at once, its feet being turned outwards, and
each grasping a different reed, and then by moving each foot
alternately, it would soon reach the top. With regard to the
moult, there is not much to relate, they have apparently only a
single moult, in Autumn, and their plumage was the same
throughout the year.
At the beginning of their second Spring, my pair showed
signs of mating ; previous to this they had always lived in perfect
harmony, feeding and preening one another, and sleeping close
against each other at night, but now the cock spent most of his
time chasing the hen backwards and forwards all over the cage..
Having, at the end of some ten days, brought her into a fit and
proper state of obedience to his wishes, they began amicably to
build a nest, which was placed in the reeds on the floor of the
cage; the exterior was a very rough and loose structure, doubtless
from want of suitable material, but inside it was carefully lined
with the dead flower of the reeds, and nicely shaped. It was
built by both birds, but the cock alone brought the materials,
and in consequence, had less of a hand in the building. On the
14th of April the first egg was laid, and the clutch of seven was
completed by the 21st. The hen, however, refused to sit, so on
the 24th, I placed six of them under a Canary, the seventh being
broken by mice, which, I believe, was the cause of their dis-
inclination to sit. On the 27th they began laying again, and
completed a clutch of six, with the same result, and later on
another clutch of five, the last egg being thin-shelled and
double-yoked ; on none of these occasions, however, did they
show any inclination to sit. Of the six eggs under the Canary,
two hatched, after thirteen days incubation, on the 5th of May.
They very much resembled young "Reed-Warblers" and were
remarkable for a large dark spot on either side of the back of the
tongue ; they lived and did well for a week, when they suddenly
died off, just as they were shooting their quills, and I am
therefore unable to follow further the life history of one of the
most interesting of our native birds.
To sum up briefly, it is distinctly a bird I can recommend
to aviculturists ; it is difficult to keep in good health, but would
do best in a large outdoor aviary ; the food should be very varied,
and contain a fair proportion of both seeds and animal food. Its
pretty and engaging ways, its tameness and its lion-combative-
ness, render it a very pleasant and harmless aviary inmate.

THE BREEDING OF THE BARRABAND PARRAKEET.
* (Polytelis barrabandi).
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996816358974359" page_id="32638056"  page_num="217" year="" vol="">
By the Rev. C. D. Farrar.
If any had told me that I should this year be successful
in breeding Barraband's Parrakeet, I should probably have
answered them in the words of a certain old Syrian king, "Who
is thy servant, dog that he is, that he should do this thing ? "--
and yet I have actually done so ; and there are at present three
healthy young Barrabands at Micklefield Vicarage.
Barrabands, I may begin by saying, are not at all like the
hideous brute depicted in " Greene's Parrots in Captivity."
Such an atrocious and ill assorted mixture of colours I never
hope to see on a living bird, and apparently this specimen had a
dislocated wing among his other beauties !
The real Barraband is one of the most beautiful birds I
ever saw, and the arrangement of the colours is exquisite.
Whoever comes to see my birds (and they are far too few)
invariably goes into raptures over the Barrabands.
In shape the Barraband very much resembles the Ring-
necked Parrakeet, but it is even more graceful.
In Australia they are sometimes known by the ill sounding
name of " Green Reeks," but I can't think how anyone could
give this lovely bird such a vulgar name.
In size the Barraband is about equal to a Pennant, but has
not the girth of the latter, being exceedingly graceful and slim-
waisted and with a long pointed tail.
The colour of the cock is a beautiful iridescent green ; his
forehead is a lovely crocus-yellow, which colour extends under
the chin, where it merges into a narrowish band of red. The
wings are iridescent green, merging into bluish-green on the
flights.
The hen is of rather a different shade of green in the
body, merging into greenish-blue on the wings and upper side
of the tail. Her eye is dark. The tail has the inner edge of
each feather, or the under side of the tail, of a beautiful salmon-
pink. She has also a dash of pink on the thighs (d).
There is, therefore, no possibility of mistaking the cock
and the hen.
Mr. Gedney says of them, "As cage pets they are very
(\0x25A0 c ). The thighs of a singularly fine hen, which I have had six years, show orange
and vermilion.--O.E.C.

much attached to each other and to their owners." In the very
next sentence he flatly contradicts himself : " Green Leeks do.
not show any strong affection one for the other." Maybe he
thought Barrabauds and Green Leeks two distindl species !
Mr. Wiener says, " I have gathered costly experience by
seeing Barrabauds fall in fits from their perches for very trivial
causes." When I remember the strange and wonderful things,
on which he fed his birds, I am not surprised to hear that they
left him so suddenly.
Dr. Greene on the Barraband is distinctly pessimistic:
"On the whole, one can scarcely recommend the tyro in Parrot
keeping to invest his money in Barrabauds, which are by no
means common, and when imported usually fetch from #3 to #\
each in the market. Enough has been said to show that they
are even more difficult to keep than the Purple-cap or Blue
Mountain Lory."
Only one ray of light seemed to show through the
surrounding darkness. Here are the magic words that fired my
ambition; "So far, none of these birds have been bred in captivity,
either here or on the Continent; nor are we aware even of any
cases of egg production among them." That determined me. I
would have Barrabands, cost what it might. I would demonstrate
that they could be kept if treated on rational principles, and,
maybe, with luck, I would even get as far as eggs, if not farther I
Some years ago I had a pair of Barrabands ; but not
having very much spare room, I sold them to a friend. We
can't breed everything at once, and I was then full up with
other kinds; but I said to myself, " The day shall come when I
will make room for you, my beauties."
This spring, or rather last " back end " I turned a pair of
splendid Barrabands into one of my outdoor aviaries. I did so
with fear and trembling after reading my many "Job's Comfor-
ters," and I thought to myself, " My dears, yours will be a short life
and a merry, and on some near morning you will drop from
your perch in a fit and give me a costly burial." However, I
determined not to do anything to hasten their end ; and, as I do
not believe any healthy-minded Barraband eats sponge cake,
pulped figs, boiled rice, Jamaica sugar, soaked currants, cabbage
blooms, mignonette, pea or bean blooms, and so on, I never
gave them the opportunity of committing suicide !
When first put out, my Barrabands were rather wild ; but
soon got to know me, and took little notice of their harmless
necessary feeder. They passed the whole of last winter out

of doors--and it was a winter and a half, as we say up here. I
remember the day of the awful blizzard : the snow was up to my
waist (and I stand six feet) and the cold was of Arctic intensity,
and the wind cut like a sharp razor. The Barrabands, however,
did not seem to mind it at all.
About May, I began to notice signs of nesting unmistak-
able to an old Parrot keeper; and, after awhile, Mrs. Barraband
disappeared. Now, in their house there are two logs, and so sly
was the lady in her ways, and of such lightning-like rapidity
in her movements, that for long enough I located the nest in the
wrong hole ; and well I might, for she entered the hole like a
streak of greased lightning. It reminded me of Maskelyne
and Cooke, in Bondon. " Now, gentlemen and ladies, there is
positively no deception ; now, look carefully--whist! and that is
how it is done."
I cannot tell the size of the eggs, because I was not fool
enough to look at them. I cannot tell (as Mr. Gedney so often
does) what colour the fluff of the young was like. My Parrakeets
won't stand such liberties--and I don't believe his did either !
The hen sat very steadily; I cannot say exactly how long,
about eighteen days, I fancy, but will not be certain. The cock
sat on the outside of the log where the hen was not, and so
further misled me, as I made sure she was inside where he kept
watch and ward. I thought this a bit of unnecessary meanness !
After a time, I could hear the well-known sounds which told my
joyful and experienced ear that youngsters had arrived. Strange
to say, I did not put my hand in and see. I knew the only thing
was t.o wait and possess my soul in patience.
No one but a Parrot-keeper will ever know the agonies of
hope and fear through which I passed during the next five weeks.
After about ten days, Papa Barraband began to visit the
nest at intervals ; spending all other available time in swallowing
seed as fast as his bill could work. At night, also, he did what
I have never known any other cock Parrakeet do--he slept in
the nest and assisted in brooding the young. This I consider
greatly to his credit as it shows him to be a thoroughly "family"
man. How many human fathers nurse their babies at night, I
wonder, in the Avicultural Society ? Mind, I don't say all Papa
Barrabands do. I will not " generalize," as our late Secretary
was fond of iterating, " from a single specimen" ! !
The first youngster left the nest on Monday, July 7th, and
was a fine lusty chap. In colour he--for I think him a he--

rather resembles the hen ; but where I suppose he will someday
have a yellow crown and chin, he now possesses a dove-coloured,
one, something like a Quaker Parrakeet; he has pink between
the thighs, and pinky-coloured edging to the under side of his
tail ; the other part of his person is green; eyes black, feet
blackish. When he first came out, I expect he plumped on the
ground, as he certainly could not fly much ; and seemed
generally rather surprised with himself and the world at large.
To-day, (Saturday) he has learnt to fly fairly well; can take a
seat beside his parents, and even answer the cock in a voice very
similar to his own.
While I think of it, my Parrakeets never all come out on
the same day, like Mr. Gedney's did ; and they never range
themselves in a line on the perch to be admired. Indeed, they
have little or no idea of perching for some days.
No. 2 came out about Thursday, and resembled No. i, but
was a little finer in make, thereby making me think that she is
a hen. No. 3 came out the following week, and I have not yet
made up my mind whether it is a cock or a hen.
I do not think there can be a prettier sight than this
family of Barrabands ; and the old birds seem as proud of their
efforts as a young couple of their first baby.
With regard to feeding, I always give the very plainest
and simplest diet. I believe Parrakeets are like a boy that was
at school with me at Lancing : he used to say (and didn't we
chaff him unmercifully) " This plain diet and early rising does
me a world of good." I believe Barrabands think the same.
My Barrabands have nothing but hemp and canary seed.
They like hemp themselves, but I think they have reared the
babies entirely on canary. They also have an unlimited supply
of flowering grass. The j^oungsters, when they left the nest,
were about a third of the size of the old birds. To-day, July 26th,
they have grown famously, and the eldest is nearly as big as the
hen.
I hope this article will interest our members as much to
read as it has me to write it; but unless they are strong, I advise
them not to go in for the strain and anxiety of rearing a nest of
Barrabands. My hair is appreciably whiter since they began
nesting.

A NATURALIST'S NOTES IN ECUADOR.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999075525" page_id="32638060"  page_num="221" year="" vol="">
{Continued from page 177.)
As readers of this paper will have observed, I have not
attempted to follow any scientific sequence in my notes on the
birds of Ecuador, but have treated them as they occurred to me,
merely, as a rule, taking a family separately. In the present
article, I shall have to be still further irregular in the classification
as I am going to write of some of the birds which are found in, and
around Quito, or at corresponding altitudes in other parts of the
country, and which from their habits and distribution, seem to
be eminently suited for cage life in this country. I have already
mentioned the difficulties in the way of bringing birds alive from
the interior of Ecuador, but as a great number of the species are
also to be found in parts of Columbia where the difficulties are
not so great, it is possible that at times some of them may reach
us from there. Many of the birds found around Quito are also
to be found around Bogota in Columbia. Quito is seven days
hard ride from the coast, whereas Bogota is barely two days ride
from the banks of the Magdelena River, from whence one can
take the steamer close down to the port of Savanilla, which is in
direct communication with Riverpool. The altitude of Quito
is 10,000 ft., and it stands at the end of a wide valley on the
central table land of Ecuador, between the Western and Eastern
ranges of the Andes, and on the outer slopes of the Volcano of
Pichincha. The climate is very mild (almost too mild) and much
resembles English spring weather in point of temperature, and
the days are most equable, but the nights and early mornings are
very chilly, and during some months of the year frosts are not at
all uncommon. We spent some considerable time in Quito and
thoroughly explored all the country around. There are no
forests whatever in the immediate neighbourhood, and very little
timber, but the mountains in most parts are covered to a high
altitude with flowering bushes, and it is scarcely a day's ride
round to the Western side of Pichincha where the forest
commences. To the North of Quito is a fertile plain, El Egido,
encircled by all the giants of the Andes, and all about here birds
abound along the hedge rows, and among the gardens and fruit
trees.
One of the first birds to attract attention--is the Turdus gigas,
whose loud liquid notes may be heard on every side. At first
sight it might be mistaken for our English blackbird, but

although its notes are much the same, the song is scarcely so
sustained. They are to be seen on the topmost twigs of every
hedge, and during the months of August and September, I saw
many of their nests in the bushes on Pichincha nearly 2,000 ft.
higher up than Quito. We also found these birds still more
numerous at Papallacta. Their food consisted principally of
berries. The male is not nearly so black as our English
blackbird, neither are the beak and legs so yellow. The female
is very brownish and the breast somewhat speckled. The total
length of the bird is just over 12 inches. At times I saw a few in
captivity in Quito, and we had one at the Consulate, which used
to whistle beautifully in the early mornings and evenings. We
first met with them in the mountains of Southern Columbia.
On the Western-side of Pichincha we met with the much
rarer T. leucops. This is a small bird only just 8 inches in length.
The male is very black and glossy all over, and the beak and legs
bright yellow: the female is brown and speckled, and more
resembles our thrush in colouring, the young taking after her. I
cannot say if this species has much song, for it is rare 011
Pichincha, and we only procured one adult pair and two young
ones. I once came across one of their nests. It was in a bush
about 4ft. from the ground, and was made of dry grass and moss,
not a particularly neat structure, and contained three blue eggs.
One was quite plain without any markings whatever, but the
other two were slightly speckled with brownish black.
Another bird very common in the vicinity of Quito is the
Pcecilothraicpis igniventris. This exceedingly handsome bird of
course belongs to the Tanager family, and like the T. gigas was
always to be seen on the tops of bushes and hedges,. I never
dissected one but what I found it had been feeding exclusively 011
berries. I was told in Quito that they often caged them, but
that they never lived long in captivity. This I am quite sure was
only due to their ignorance in giving them unsuitable food, for a
miserable specimen I once saw in a cage had only canary seed
and soaked bread to eat, and its owner wondered why it died.
With proper food there is no doubt they would be very hardy
birds. They are bright and active and have some rather sweet
notes. Even in a wild state they seemed tamer than the general
run of birds, and allowed one to get quite close to them, when
instead of taking flight, they would all of a sudden drop from
the twig they were sitting on into the bush below, as if they
had been shot. The length of the bird is 7^ inches. The head,
neck, throat, back, wings and tail are black, while the breast and

underparts are flaming red, and on each side of the head is a
patch of the same colour. The rump and shoulders are a lovely
shade of bright blue, rather difficult to describe, being somewhat
mauvish and very shining. It is remarkable that these birds
should be as common as they are, for almost every boy in Quito
uses a catapult or a blow pipe, and is always popping at the birds
along the road side. The P. igniventris especially affords them
a good mark as it sits on the top of the twigs, and I have seen
one boy with as many as a dozen of these birds alone, the result
of a day's spoil. The poorer class of people in Quito make
fairly artistic feather pictures, so birds of bright plumage are
much sought after by them and a good sprinkling of the feathers
of this Tanager can generally be detected in their productions.
There seems to be very little difference between the sexes,
but in placing the skins side by side I notice that the red on the
breast of the female is slightly more orange. One reason why
the Quitenos get so few birds to live, is because they seem to
have no knowledge of trapping them properly. They generally
depend upon the aforementioned bo)^s to procure them live
birds, which are merely those that are stunned by the clay
pellets and are not killed outright. As a rule they are inwardly
injured and survive outy a few days.
Two other gaily coloured birds found on Pichincha at a
higher altitude than Quito are the Buthraupis cucullata and
B. chloronota. The former one we found particularly plentiful
at cold Papallacta, where we found them feeding on hard berries
and seeds. The length of the bird is inches. The head,
throat, tail and primaries are black, and the neck, back and wing
coverts the same shade of blue as in the P. igniventris, but with
a still more shining surface: the whole of the breast and under-
parts are clear yellow, and the outer edging of the secondary
wing feathei&amp;apos;S is also blue. The beak is black, short and thick.
B. chloronota is a trifle smaller bird, and has the head, neck and
shoulders violet blue, the throat and upper part of the breast
black, and the lower parts of the breast&amp;apos;chrome yellow ; the vent
and under tail coverts being more reddish. The back is leaf
green and the secondary wing feathers are also broadA edged
with the same colour, the primaries and tail being black. We
frequently saw both varieties together, and found it impossible
to distinguish the notes of one from the other. They seem to
have no song, neither is their call note agreeable, but they have
such a bold attractive air about them, that I feel sure they would
be nice birds to have in cages. B. chloronota seems to be con-

fined solely to Ecuador, whereas the other one is found also in
the vicinity of Bogota.
Another brightly coloured bird from Pichiucha is the blue
Zanthura turcosa; this likewise was still more plentiful on the
Eastern range at Papallacta, and all those we shot there were
much brighter than those from the Western range, which may or
may not have had something to do with the season. On Pi-
chincha we seldom met with more than two together, but at
Papallacta they were sometimes in flocks of twenty, and made
a loud chattering noise the whole time. The Ecuadorians call
them "Auroras," and I was told they could be taught to speak,
which is not improbable. They feed chiefly on beetles and other
insects as well as on berries, and Mr. Hamilton once caught one
in the act of robbing the eggs from the nest of some small bird.
They have much the same habits as our English Jay, and hold
all their prey under the claws and peck it to pieces. The length
of the bird is n inches, and the whole of the plumage is a
bright blue except the forehead which is black, and a broad
patch of the same colour extends across the eyes. The head and
throat are a still more brilliant hue than the rest of the bod}^,
and the throat is encircled by a band of black. The beak is
black and rather hooked, and the undersurface of the wings, and
tail are also black. In the collections of skins from Bogota can
generally be found some of these birds.
The Yellow-bellied Grosbeak (&amp;apos;Pheucticus chrysogaster ) was
also very common at times in the gardens of Quito, where it
committed great damage to all kinds of seeds and buds. I have
seen them picking off the flowers from bushes and trees out of
wanton destruction, and for this reason during our stay at the Con-
sulate we shot all that putin an appearance there when we were
at home. It was somewhat curious that I never noticed them in
the garden except during the mid - day hours. This was
one of the most ordinary cage birds of Quito, in the very few
houses where they kept birds, and I should certainly have
brought some back with me alive had I been coming straight home
from there. Those I saw in captivity were fed on soft young
maize and seed, and became so tame as to go loose about the
house. I am sorry I cannot remember the name these birds
were known by in Quito. It was so familiar to me that I appear
to have made no note of it. It has certainly escaped my memory
now, although as I write these lines I seem to have it on the tip
of my tongue.
In the mouth of October I found two of their nests near

to Quito, each containing two young ones, and in both cases
built in acacia trees. The young resemble the female, and I
should think maintain that plumage until the second moult.
The number of immature males in proportion to adults was very
great. The male is a brilliant yellow all over the body, with
black wings and a conspicuous band of white across the primaries
near their base ; the secondaries are also broadly margined with
white on the outer edge and the shoulders also. The tail is
black, but the two outer feathers on each side are white on the
broader margin for quite half their length, the central ones
being only tipped with it. The upper and under tail coverts are
white. The female is greenish yellow, and with the wings and
tail veiy brownish. The beak which of course is very thick is
black on the upper half and slate colour on the lower half. The
total length of the bird is eight inches. They were ver}^ fond of
the seeds of the acacia trees whether ripe or green. Their
bright colour renders them conspicuous birds, and very beautiful
indeed do they look flying about. At the village of Pifo in the
Chillo Valle}^ near Quito, I often saw them pecking about on an
old stone wall, probably looking for insects ; as many as four or
five were sometimes there together. I never met witli the
Yellow-bellied Grosbeak on any part of Pickiucka, or indeed at
any altitude above Quito, but I was surprised to see some of
them among a collection of skins which recently reached this
country from Guayaquil, shot in the neighbourhood of that port
on the island of Puna. It is strange that a bird which is found
in the cool mountains at the altitude of Quito, should also in-
habit the hot coast lands, and I can remember no other bird in
Ecuador to do so except the Black Turkey Vulture.
Another genus of birds which is numerous in and around
Quito is the Diglossus, the most common one there being the
D. aterrima. They are vivacious, attractive-looking birds, and
exceedingly fearless, for on one or two occasions I was sitting in
the room when one entered at the window and searched all over
the place for spiders, taking no notice whatever of me as long as
I was still. In the garden they seem for ever on the go, hunting
for insects in every bush and plant. A pair started nesting in
one of the "patio" gardens of the Consulate, and would not
tolerate the presence of any other bird there. A pair of Hum-
ming birds (Petasophora iolata), which had reared many nests of
young in the same garden, had their nests pulled to pieces by
the Diglossi eveiy time they started to build : so I should think
they must be rather pugnacious little birds during the nesting

<bodyText confidence="0.996315744186047" page_id="32638065"  page_num="226" year="" vol="">
season, at all events. Their own nest they built among the
sword - like leaves of a slender kind of aloe, most skilfully
arranged about 3ft. from the ground. Whilst sitting, they were
not in the least disturbed by my standing over them, and never
once left the nest when I went to look at them, but would gaze
up fearlessly at me with their shining black eyes. The eggs
were two in number, blue and speckled with red, but the nest
was destroyed by the gardener before the eggs were hatched,
much to my regret. A gentleman I knew in Quito had a pair of
D. lafresnayi which he caught when they entered his room
searching for insects as they did in mine. They quickly became
very tame, and would readily take flies from the fingers; after a
time they were allowed out to catch them for themselves. Flies
and bread crumbs formed their sole diet, and on the ordinary
foods for soft-billed birds they would undoubtedly thrive well.
They were very fond of bathing and kept themselves in the
pink of condition. This species is glossy black with lavender-
coloured shoulders, the whole length of the bird being 6 inches.
Their curiously-shaped beaks give them a very perky appearance.
Out of the fourteen known species coming from Northern and
Western South America, we found six of them inhabiting the
neighbourhood of Quito, namely aterrima, sittoides , humeralis,
lafresnayi , personata and indigotica. They are found only in
mountainous regions. We shot an albino specimen of aterrima
near Quito. The personata is a handsome bird, blue all over and
with a black mask, but the tiny indigotica is the prettiest of all,
being a much richer shade of blue than the well-known Indigo
birds from the States. The Diglossi range from Mexico down to
Bolivia.
Still another little frequenter of the gardens in Quito is
the Black-lieaded Siskin ( Chrysomitris capitalist They go in
flocks and fill the air with their sweet song. They seem to feed
chiefly 011 the seeds of flowering grasses, and I have seen them
fly up in clouds from the fields. I saw a few in cages, and
considering how well they sing it was quite a wonder they were
not more generally kept, and being seed eaters they would be
less trouble to their lazy owners. I was frequently told that the
reason they did not keep more birds was because they were so
much trouble to look after, and as for bringing up a nest of
young birds ! " Why, nobody but a lunatic would take the
trouble." The cages they used had only wire bottoms to them
to save the owners the trouble of cleaning them out, and the
state of the floor underneath was of minor importance in their

<bodyText confidence="0.999418119047619" page_id="32638066"  page_num="227" year="" vol="">
sight. In one or two houses I visited of the higher class, they
had properly made cages, but they might have only been cleaned
out once a year for the excrement had formed into pyramids
until it touched the perches, and this was in canaries' cages.
The male Black-headed Siskin is a very pretty little bird,
with a black head and throat, greenish yellow back, the breast and
underparts more or less yellow with green shading on the flanks.
The wings are black and barred with bright yellow, the secondary
feathers are tipped with white. The female lacks the black head
and is a more uniform brownish green, and the yellow on the
wings is also much less distinct.
Some species of doves are very abundant in the immediate
neighbourhood of Quito, but they call for no special attention with
the exception of the little Chamtzpelia passerina which abounds
in the valley of Chillo. This is rather a dry sandy valley where
acacias and aloes chiefly flourish, and has been devastated over
and over again by eruptions from Cotopaxi. Here these little
doves may be seen running along the dusty roads everywhere,
and might easily be snared in great numbers. The male is
especially pretty with his delicate fawnish pink colouring; the
wings are spotted with purple bronze, and the primary and
secondary feathers are rufous red edged and tipped with black.
When flying the wings have the appearance of being wholly red.
In the female the fawnish pink colouring is not so bright. The
bird does not exceed 5^ inches in length. I found their nests 011
the branches of the acacia trees and also one on the giant flower
stalks of an aloe. It was exposed to all weathers and liable to
attack from birds of prey, which were common about there. I
could not have got it without chopping down the plant, but
I could see the bird sitting on the nest. The other nests I saw
were in each case built of fine twigs, a little dry grass, and the
thin dry seed pods of the acacia trees. They appear to have a
wide range through Central and South America, and we met
wdth them in many parts of Columbia, but always in the higher
mountains.
Another pretty Dove much larger than the preceding
species was the Metriopelia melanoptera, which we met with only
on the high wind-swept regions at the foot of the cone of
Cotopaxi at an altitude of from thirteen to fourteen thousand
feet. I can't imagine what they find to eat amidst such
desolation, for the only vegetation was a scanty wiry grass
growing here and there, among the cinders, rocks and lava

thrown out from the crater. The length of the bird is inches.
The head, back and upper part of the breast are smoky dove
colour, much darker towards the rump, and the under parts a
very light dove colour. The tail and wings are black, the
primaries being very finely margined with white on the outer
edge near the tips. The shoulders are pure white and look very
conspicuous when flying. The most curious thing about the
bird is the bright primrose coloured bare spot it has between
the beak and the eye which fades when the bird is dead. This
dove ranges through the mountains at high altitudes from
Central America down to Chili.
I can hardly leave out the White-tailed Solitario Agriornis
solitaria from this article, as they are to be seen about on the
house tops and in the gardens throughout Quito, and they at
once attract attention by their loud liquid notes. They nest
under the tiles of the houses, in the thatch of the huts, in
Church towers and also in trees. If I had time I might consider-
ably extend the number of birds from these regions suitable for
captivity, for I can think of more than double the number I have
already mentioned which equally claim attention. I have said
nothing of the Grallarias which may be seen hopping about
under the hedges, especially under the bushes on the slopes of
Pichincha, G. squamigera, hypoleuca and monticola being among
the more notable ones. They would look extremely nice in a
large garden aviary. Then there are those miniature Owls, the
Glaucidium jardinii which sit and blink outside their burrows or
on the ledges of rocks all day ; neither have I time to treat of
any of the members of the genus Catamenia and also Phrygilus
which one meets with in flocks, and all of which are eminently
suited to cage life, being seed eaters. I think though, I have
said enough to show how many interesting birds there are well-
adapted to stand our climate, and of which unfortunately at
present we know so little. As I have said before, it is a pity
that in many cases the regions they come from are so difficult of
access, that under present circumstances we are debarred from
obtaining them, but if any readers of these pages should feel
tempted to visit Ecuador, these notes may be of use to them in
indicating the birds most suitable to look out for, and the
localities where to find them.

SOCIETY.
By H. R. Firmer.
The title at the head of this paper was very familiar to
the founders of the Avicultural Society five or six 3^ears ago,
but probably it is quite without meaning to nine out of ten of
the members who have joined us during the last four years.
I have for some time been desirous of giving our newer members
some account of the old Society, which was the parent of the
Avicultural, and began a little article on the subject some
months ago ; but I found it very difficult to handle, and for the
time abandoned the project. Now I am going to try again ;
but I must ask my readers to bear in mind that, in order to
avoid treading on corns, and unearthing buried controversies, I
must refrain from saying a good deal which I may perhaps be
expected to say. Being thus hampered in my treatment of the
subject, it is possible that I may convey a somewhat false
impression of what I am going to give an account of. But I
will do my best within my limitations.
The U.K.F.C.B.S. was founded in 1890, and very soon had
fifty members. The first President was Dr. W. T. Greene, and
the Vice-President the Rev. H. D. Astley. Mr. W. Osbaldeston
was Secretary and Treasurer, and filled those offices during the
whole existence of the Society. The first Committee consisted
of Messrs. W. Bottomley, S. Barnes, J. T. Dewar, J. Frostick,
T. C. Kneen, F. Spencer, W. Oakey, J. A. Sleep, C. P. Arthur,
W. Swaysland, J. Abrahams, and H. T. T. Camps. The chief
purpose of the Society was the issue of a Monthly Report,
consisting of Notes by the Secretary and letters or short articles
from members, with an occasional reprints of articles which had
already appeared elsewhere. These Reports varied in length;
some consisted of but two or three small pages, while others
attained the dimensions of a short number of the Avicultural
Magazine . The matter was similar to that in our Correspondence
pages, but the Editor might, with advantage, have used the blue
pencil more boldly than he did.
The U.K.F.C.B.S. appealed also to Exhibitors, and did the
work now performed by the F.B.E-E. The Society held a Show
at Preston in 1891, and one at Brighton in 1893, and both were
great successes in their way.
The Society seems to have reached high-water mark in
1892-3, when it had a membership of about ninety. The late

distinguished ornithologist Lord Lilford became President, and
the Committee was strengthened by the addition of the names
of Dr. Simpson, Mr. J. Sergeant, and others. The bound
" Reports " of this year form a volume of 254 pages.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.994900869565218" page_id="32638069"  page_num="230" year="" vol="">
Next year, 1893-4, there was a slight falling off in the
membership, while the Reports consisted of only 142 pages.
In the following year, the membership had fallen to between
thirty and forty, and the Reports to about seventy pages. In
May, 1895, the Society was amalgamated with the Avicultural
Society.
Ths four Volumes of Reports (Vol. I. has long been out
of print) are useful for reference, as several cases of breeding-
are therein recorded. But, to the present-day aviculturist, the
chief interest of the U.K.F.C.B.S. lies in the fact that it was
the fore-runner of the Avicultural Society, and if it had not
existed, it is probable that the Avicultural also would never
have come into being. The object of the founders of the
Avicultural Society was to start a similar Society on improved
lines, and they did not launch the new Society until after an
unsuccessful attempt to reform the old one.
Another Society which served in some degree as a model
for the Avicultural was the Cage Bird Club (a 7 ). No doubt the
success of the Avicultural Society is in some measure due to
the fact that its founders had before them the examples of the
U.K.F.C.B.S. and the Cage Bird Club ; they endeavoured to
imitate the good points of each, and also tried to avoid what
they believed to be the defects of these Societies.

The arrivals this month, as will be seen, are all, with one
exception, well-known, and frequently figure on the list of
arrivals at the Zoo, and, in consequence, there is but little for
me to write about. The Allen's Porphyrio makes, if I mistake
not, the third presented this year, all of which have been cap-
tured at sea. The Orinoco Goose and Wandering Tree Ducks,

both interesting birds of their kind, I was unable to find, the
Duck Ponds being somewhat extensive, and at this time of the
year, rather overgrown ; in my search however I came across a
nice brood of young Pintail, and on one of the small ponds,
some very nice specimens of Boers Duck ( Fuligula bceri).
The Angolan Vultures, in very bad condition, are now in
the Kites' Aviary, behind the Eagles' cages, but are not worth a
visit. In the Western Aviary, the Yellow-bellied Liothrix and
Mountain Witch-Doves are perhaps the most interesting of the
new arrivals; among the other nice birds in the same Aviary is
a Roller, which I think came in last month, and a nice lot of the
various Weaver Birds in full plumage, the most noticeable of
which was the Golden-backed Weaver Bird, in superb trim. Of
the other orders in the same aviary, a pair of Australian Rails
(Rallies pectoralis&amp;apos;) and some Common Sandpipers ( Tot anus hypo-
leucus ) were in lovely plumage and condition.
The Storks were not apparently successful in their nesting
operations, as they were both w T andering round their paddock
looking very disconsolate.
The only Gulls which appear to have hatched in the Gull-
ponds were a pair of Great Black-backs, which were about half
grown, and looked very pretty chasing their parents round the
pond. In the Great Aviary, opposite the Eastern Aviary, a pair
of Jamieson's Gulls are being successfully brought up, while
young Ibises are to be seen all over the aviary ; a pair of Night
Herons are also sitting, but, so I was informed, are not likely to
hatch.
The one exception referred to at the beginning of this
paper is the arrival (not mentioned in the list) of five Gentoo
Penguins ( Pygosceles tceniatus ) from the Falkland Isles; they are
placed near the Emperor Penguin (wdio, by the way, still con-
tinues well), and the Sea Dion. They are like most Penguins, a
plain-coloured bird, dark slate above and snowy-white below,
and appear to have stood their journey w 7 ell, but were rather
unhappy in the present heat.
CORRESPONDENCE.
A PROPOSAL TO EXTEND THE SCOPE OF THE MAGAZINE.
Sir, --Permit me to enter my protest against the suggested alteration,
in Magazine. We are a Society of avicnlturists, not fanciers. I cannot
conceive liow the Canary fancy can be termed aviculture in any sense--
therefore, to be consistent, if we admit them to the Magazine it seems to
me we must alter the name both of Society and Magazine; and cannot but

think with Dr. Butler and others, that the proposed change would work
disastrously for the Society. I should have written earlier, but have been
laid up the whole of this year and am still unable to attend to business.
W. S. Page.
Note --The writer of this letter wishes it to be known, that it was
written before he had seen the July No. of the Magazine. Editor.
Sir, --At the risk of becoming tedious on this subject, I venture to
comment on Mr. Seth-Smith's foot-note to my last letter. He says,--" The
admission of Canaries.would cause all our most scientific members
to leave the Society in disgust; whereas our chief aim should be to make
our paper more worthy of their support." Some time ago Dr. Butler gave
expression to similar views.
Personally, I give our "scientific members " credit for more sense. I
do not believe that the changes which I have suggested would lead to their
resignation--for this strange prejudice against a particular species is
eminently zzwscientific. But even if they did resign, their loss would not
be insuperable. Their number is very small, and their activity on behalf of
the Society (with a few notable exceptions) by no means conspicuous. It
seems to me that a tendency is developing to subordinate the Society to the
views of a minute minority. I protest against Mr. Seth-Smith's state-
ment that our chief aim should be to make our Magazine more worthy of
the support of the scientists (the word is abominable English--but I
suppose it must be used). Our aim should be nothing of the sort--it should
be to promote aviculture, and to give the members advice and assistance in
the pursuit of their hobby. The Societ} r is not a scientific Society, and the
great majority of the members know little of science and care less. By
playing at being a scientific body we shall only make ourselves ridiculous,
and neglect our proper work.
I would not be misunderstood. I heartily appreciate the assistance
which has been rendered to the Society by one or two scientific orni-
thologists, and I would cordially welcome their co-operation in the future.
But I object to the interests of the general body of members being
subordinated to the (supposed) tastes and prejudicies of a small number.
At the time when the Avicultural Society was founded, there was a
tendency on the part of some avicultural writers to belittle the work of
scientific ornithologists, to invent eccentric systems of classification, and
to make friendly relations between scientists and aviculturists almost
impossible. Our Society has altered all that. The pendulum has now
swung far in the opposite direction, and we are threatened by a very
different but equally dangerous tendency. We are now told that our
" chief aim " should be to win the approval of the scientists.
If this is in future to be the aim of the Society, it will, I am convinced,
rapidly grow out of touch with nine-tenths of its present supporters.
Aviculturists will not submit to be treated as the humble followers of the
ornithologists. Aviculture is, in a sense, a branch of ornithology, but it is
not an inferior or dependent branch. There is a real danger of confusing
aviculture and ornithology, but the two things are essentially distinct and
different.

The horticulturist can help the botanist, the apiarist can help the
entomologist--but we are not told that the chief aim of horticulturists
should be to win the approval of botanists, or of bee-keepers to receive the
applause of entomologists. The horticulturist cultvates plants because of
their beaut} 7 or their utility, or both. The aviculturist cultivates birds for the
same reasons, and also because their companionship gives him pleasure.
There are a few who keep birds partly with a view to studying and
recording their habits, and thus adding to our knowledge of ornithology--
but such persons are to such an extent ornithologists and not aviculturists.
Let us try to "clear our minds of cant." We are not, as a Society, scientists;
we do not, as a Society, keep birds with any direct scientific object. Then,
in the name of common sense, let us not pretend to be what we are not.
I fear that I am wandering from my subject, and will return to the
consideration of Mr. Seth-Smith's remarks.
As to advertising the Magazine. This has been tried before, and it
was proved by experience that advertisements in weekly papers did not pa} 7 .
If the Society embarks on a policy of advertising, it will be found that each
new member, so gained, will cost many times the amount of his annual
subscription. I differ from Mr. Seth-Smith on this point also, that I do not
believe in the existence of the " great many aviculturists who have never
heard of the Magazine." I believe, on the contrary, that the number of
persons sufficiently interested in the subjects of our Magazine to become
regular subscribers, and who have never heard of it, is very small.
Mr. Seth-Smith ignores the existence of a powerful " fancy" element
in connection with foreign and British birds, especially the latter. This
element has never been any trouble to the Society, and there is no reason
why the Canary "fancy" should be more difficult to deal with. My
personal experience is that Canary " fanciers " are neither better nOr worse
than " fanciers " of British and foreign birds.
One of my chief motives in urging the admission of Canaries, is that
an arena for the discussion of Canary topics may be provided, which shall
be free from the objectionable features of the fancy journals. Our Society
lias done much to elevate the pursuit of the culture of foreign and British
birds, and I hold that it is now our duty to try to do the same for the
pursuit of the culture of Canaries.
I feel sure that there is no risk of the Magazine being turned into " a
common fancy paper," so long as it is under the control of the present
Editor and Executive Committee; and to admit such a possibility seems
scarcely a compliment to them. H. R. Fielmer.
Sir, -- Mr. F&amp;apos;illmer at one time seemed to appreciate the fact that the
study of living birds was the truest science : he now says that the Society
is not a scientific one, and he evidently desires that it should not be recog-
nized as such : unhappily for Mr. Fillmer's wishes it is recognized as such
already, and the contents of its organ are regularly noted in the "Zoological
Record "--a work which deals only with publications of recognized scientific
interest.
Mr. Fillmers present attitude is to me quite incomprehensible.
Time was when none of our members was more anxious than he that the
Society should be based upon strictly scientific lines; no member objected

more strongly even to the very term " fancy ; " now he would persuade us
that aviculture and "the fancy" are one and the same thing, that the
refusal to study the abortions of man's creation amounts to the refusal to
recognize certain natural species: he knows as well as anyone that this is
not a correct statement of facts, and that our pages are now open to any-
one who cares to write an article either on the wild Canary or the Rock-
pigeon.
When an advocate is obliged to misrepresent facts to bolster up a
weak case, surely it is no longer worth while to consider it: doubtless it
would be unscientific for us to refuse au article on either of the birds above
mentioned, but it is not unscientific to refuse to include monstrosity-breed-
ing (generally known as " the fancy ") into a Society founded for the serious
and scientific study of wild birds.
I deny that, the wishes of the many are subordinated to the few as
Mr. Fillmer hints ; I am sure that the majority of bird-lovets care little or
nothing about Canaries. A. G. BuTRER.
Sir, --To start a controversy with my friend Mr. Fillmer is the
last thing I should have wished for, but I think his letter calls for some
comment from me.
I am perhaps mistaken, but I feel and always have felt that the aim
of our Society should be to increase our knowledge of the habits of birds,
and to find out all we can about their wild life, by keeping them in a state
approaching, as nearly as possible, to that in which they enjoy life in a wild
state.
I dislike cages and the term " cage-bird," and I had hoped that one
object of our members was to discourage the keeping of birds in cages and
to encourage their culture in large aviaries. Moreover, I hoped and
thought that we were to confine our attention to the lovely natural forms
in the state in which au All-wise Providence created them, and have
nothing to do with the artificial productions of man.
If we are to open our columns to the domestic Canary, with all its
numerous and often hideous varieties, and which is nowhere to be found in
a wild state in its present form, why should we not also admit all the
domestic poultry and Pigeons ?
We have also been asked to admit mammals, reptiles, and fishes.
Personally, so long as all domesticated forms were excluded, I should have far
less objection to these than to the domestic Canary ; although I think it
would be a mistake to admit any of them. Still, supposing quadrupeds
and Canaries were admitted into our Magazine, we should then have
domesticated creatures amongst the birds, and we should have no shadow
of excuse for excluding domestic quadrupeds--dogs, cats, rabbits, and
white mice.
Surely we have a wide enough field for study if we admit only all
birds which have not undergone domestication.
Mr. Fillmer says " this strange prejudice against a particular species
is eminently zmscientific." No one is prejudiced against the species as it
occurs in its wild form, it is only the domesticated bird, which is as unlike
the pure wild bird as black is unlike white, that is objected to. The very
idea of opening our pages to discussions on such subjects as " colour-
feeding," "crest-breeding," &amp;c., is to me loathsome.

I contend that every aviculturist should strive to be an ornithologist,
(just as the horticulturists should be a botanist, and the apiarist au ento-
mologist) and our Magazine should teach him to become such.
Where is the pleasure in keeping birds if you know nothing of their
wild life, or if you do not seek to study minutely their life habits, or if you
know not from whence they come ?
Mr. Fillmer was once opposed to the term " fancier," as applied to
the aviculturist, but his views seem to have changed somewhat. For my
part I hate the term, for the fancier keeps his birds solely for show, or for
what he cau make out of them, and cares not how he distorts nature;
whereas the aviculturist keeps his birds because he loves to study their
ways, and to learn all he can of wild nature. D. Seth-Smith.

Sir, --I shall be much obliged if you will kindly assist me with your
advice, as to how to treat a favourite Gre) r Parrot. Within the last few
weeks, w 7 e have noticed a growth appearing on the side of his face, near
the jaw. At present it is the size of a filbert, and quite hard ; the bird does
not appear to suffer any inconvenience, and is quite cheerful, talking and
whistling as usual. He appears to feel no pain as he will allow you to rub
it. He is twenty-seven years old, and in all other respects is perfectly
healthy and in first-rate plumage. Laura Swinfen Brown.
The following reply has been sent to Airs. Swinfen Brown:
There can be little doubt that the swelling on your Parrot's face is a
fatty tumour, and could be easily removed by an expert, without giving the
bird much pain. You cannot do better than get a veterinary surgeon to
examine it, and to operate if he thinks it sufficiently advanced.

Sir,--K indly inform me if a foreign Bullfinch from Florence should
be allowed dandelion seeds, and how many in the day. When do Bull-
finches moult ? The one I have sits quite still all day and never attempts
to sing, and looks very ill, but I see no feathers in the cage.
Kindly inform me from whom I can obtain fine Indian millet, the
colour of spray millet only smaller seeds. I require it for Gouldian Grass-
finches. Georgina H. Maitland.
The following answer has been sent to Mrs. Keith Alaitland :
This is the time of year at which Bullfinches begin to moult: which
may account for your bird being quiet and not singing. He may have a
few dandelion seeds if he likes them, but fresh green chickweed daily is a
better diet, and green food, is necessary.
I do not know any millet smaller than spray millet, or any better
than this for Gouldians. There is, of course, the pui&amp;apos;e-white millet,
procurable at any good bird shop ; but this is larger, and I have always
found my Gouldians thrive best on spray millet, and they have lived with
me towards five years--an unusual term of life in captivity for them.

(Continued from page iqg.)
According to the Museum Catalogue (vol. xii. p. 148), P.
Pusilla and P. olivacea (a) merge into each other ; " and it is
certain that they cannot be regarded as more than sub-species."
This may be so ; but I think it should be pointed out that (so I
gather from the Catalogue) the birds on the islands (Greater
Antilles) breed true to colour as P. lepida, while the mainland birds
(from Mexico throughout Central America to Panama and
Colombia--and also presumably on the island of Jolbox) breed
true to colour as P. pusilla. It would seem that it is only on the
island of Cozumel that the two merge into each other, by the
Cozumel specimens of P. pusilla (distinguished as P. intermedia&amp;apos;)
having green ear-coverts like P. lepida , and smaller breast
patches than the typical bird.
The smaller breast patch and the green ear-coverts seem
to be the disturbing features. But allowance does not seem to
have been made for the changes of plumage, perhaps partly
seasonal and partly in respect of age. It is quite possible that
most of the specimens from each locality, in the Museum, may
have been obtained at the same time. I do not know if such was
the case, but British Naturalists do not visit such a place as the
island of Cozumel every day. Now the numbering of my males
was in accordance with what appeared on their arrival to be
simply the brightness of their plumage, but what was probably
their degree of forwardness, which naturally carried with it
proportionate vigour and courage. But the developments do
not seem to have altogether stopped with the moult, for No. 3,
(a) This is one of several instances in the Catalogue where the author betrays that he
has not the courage of his convictions. In this case, he considers that the familiar specific
name of the Olive Finchshould be superseded, and styles the species P. lepida ; but in the
text he talks of it not as P. lepida but as P. olivacea.-- R.P.

who lived longer than No. 2, was in the more advanced plumage
when it died, being much more yellow in general colour, but
with a crown only slightly darker than the body, whereas on No.
1 the black from the forehead extended up to and encroached
upon the (^) Crown. On the other hand, front about the time
that the latter was struck with mortal illness, the black breast
patch, which had been his great beauty and distinguishing
mark, very greatly faded, and the upper parts of the body had
become again of a dull brown, the yellow wash having dis-
appeared. On March 16, I was So struck by the incouspicuous-
ness of the breast patch that I was quite perturbed, wondering if
the bird could be only P. lepida after all. The bird was on the
ground near the window, feeding in the sun ; and at a distance
of less than two feet I scrutinised the plumage carefully (not for
the first time by many), and found that the ear-coverts were
tinged with green as in the Olive Finch. I at once referred to
the skins of males 2 and 3, and a glance at their breasts reassured
me, for previously No. 1 had been the most finely plumed of the
lot.
Altogether our knowledge of the plumage of these two
birds, in their several stages, seems to me to be in an unsatisfactory
state ; and further investigation would seem desirable.
The last chapter in the history of my Tittle Finches is a
sad one ; indeed the whole story seems but a mournful record of
blundering and disaster. On January 28, 1900, I suddenly became
aware that both my males were dying, No. 3 dying the same&amp;apos;
night from acute inflammation. Both had been shut up, in
separate cages, on opposite sides of the room, with a number of
other birds. Whether the room door had been left open in the
early morning, perhaps too while the adjoining front door was
open for door-step-cleaning purposes, or otherwise, I do not
know, but evidentl} 7, there had been some sudden undue lowering
of the temperature of the room. To make the matter worse, a
spiteful female Bengali had worried and injured No. r. So
crushed and cowed did he seem that I placed him quietly with
the little widow, in the hopes that her presence might give him
heart, which, doubtless it did, for he lived quietly and I may
say happily with her until March 18, when I found him dead
in bed, having passed away in his sleep, from some disease of
the kidneys brought on doubtless by a chill. It is unquestionably
a delicate species, requiring special watchfulness as regards
(b) This black seems to run up the sides of the crown in a V shape, forming ail
edging, sometimes faint but sometimes broad and bold, to the yellow superciliary
streaks.--R P.

temperature; for of over thirty other little birds kept in the
same room through the winter I did not lose one.
During these days of the last male's illness, the female
had not been allowing the grass to grow under her feet. Before
many days had passed after his admission to her presence, she had
built in a rush nest hung up in the cage, but the four eggs were
clear. Yet another nest did she build, this time in a box, her
mate's sleeping apartment; but his presence disturbed her, and
the nest with three eggs was deserted, and a fourth clutch of
three was immediately laid in the rush nest where the second
batch had been. But, owing to the sickness of the male, these
also were clear. Both these nests (uncovered) were constructed
by the female without any assistance from the male, and almost
entirely of hay and dry grass.
Two curious little points came under my notice when the
female had completed her time on the last clutch. I was in the
habit of opening her cage when I came down in the morning, and
giving her a call, when she would come out for a fly and other
purposes; but apparently she always remained on the nest until
the door was opened. Even in this, by the waj^ we may perhaps
see a reason why some birds will never rear young in a cage with
a generally closed door. On March 19, the plucky little thing,
once more a widow, came off with something in her bill. For
the moment I thought it must be a piece of shell from a newly
hatched bird, but it was only a bit of hay. Did her instinct
teach her that time was up ! or did she know that time was up
by the second incident ! On the morning following, almost
immediately after being let out, she ejedted some fluid from
the crop, doubtless some secretion of the nature of Pigeon's
milk, which, owing to the failure of the eggs to hatch, she was
unable to dispose of in a natural manner.
Although these ten eggs had a family likeness, some
differed from others in size, shape, and arrangements and size of
spots, teaching a lesson how dangerous it is to draw conclusions
as to eggs having been laid by the same or different females
according as they may happen to be alike or otherwise ; neverthe-
less it would be unusual for so many eggs, if laid by a wild bird, to
differ so much, although of course variations are common
enough in the wild state also.
As I did not see any of these eggs when fresh, I am a
little doubtful as to what the normal shades of the colours may
be. The ground colour of some were whitish, of others cream-
white, of others blue-white. The spots and blotches on some

were almost dun, on others faded brown, on others again reddish
brown. I think that the latter would be the more usual colour.
The bodies of most of the eggs were faintly speckled, the spots
being mostly gathered at the thick end, running into and
joining one another, sometimes forming a circle with a clear
centre.
Amongst the last batch was one egg of unusual size. In
olden days, having been brought up amongst the birds, in my
simplicity, I should have called this an ordinary double-yolked
egg, as I would have called an abnormally small egg a yolkless
one. But in these enlightened days such childish ideas have to
be put away, and I must now recognise in this large egg the
zygodactyle foot, and deposit it in my cabinet amongst my
Cuckoos' eggs accordingly.
On July nth, I detected a mounted male Phonipara
pusilla in one of the glass cases at the Natural History Museum
at South Kensington. It was described as a Yellow-throated
Seed Finch from Mexico. It was the only specimen on view of
the genus Phonipara , but was in the company of Volatinia
jacarina and Sperniophila lineola , both of which were also called
Seed Finches, a name which, as regards these two, is not generally
accepted. In the Zoological Society's Fist, not one species of
the genus Phonipara is called a Seed Finch, the name being
reserved in the List for the genus Oryzoborus. Considering that
the Finches generally, and many other birds, eat seed, it is not
clear to me why a select few should be styled Seed-eaters and
Seed Finches.
For Phonipara pusilla (little), the name of either Little
Finch, or Yellow-throated Finch, if not already appropriated,
would do very well.

Since writing my last notes, two rather rare Amazons
have come into my possession, Chrysotis augusla and C. boitqueti.
It may be well to say something about them, before I go on to
the next species which will be Pionus. But I wish to see more
of them before I say anything about their ways, and there is a
subject of vital interest to all parrot keepers which I might say
something about, and that is the question of food.
In this matter it must be understood that I am simply
giving the results of experience--my own and others'. Though

I have kept a good many parrots, I know too little about them to
form theories.
But it will be obvious to anyone who reflects that a race of
birds inhabiting such different parts of the world as Patagonia
and Mexico, the Amazons and the Andes, the Himalayas and
New Guinea, Australia and Bengal, are no more likely to be
suited by one diet, than they are by one temperature. A cocka-
too will thrive in a temperature that would kill a grey parrot.
When I buy a bird, or acquire it, I like to know what it
has been fed on. If the bird is a picture of health, it doesn't
matter how unsuitable I may think the food, I go on with it.
One of the best conditioned greys I ever saw, had nothing but
hard maize and water. Most parrots are indifferent to maize and
will not eat it. And even if the bird is plainly being fed
wrongly, and the food is not suiting it, I should not change all
at once. Birds will very often refuse to touch food, if it is
strange to them. I sometimes think it does not enter their head
it is food, and they are not like man, who will eat anything to
stay the pangs of hunger.
Perhaps---I hope it is so--that birds do not siiffer as man
does when he starves. I gave away some linnets once that I had
reared by hand ; I had fed them on rape : they were given canary
seed. They coidd have cracked it perfectly, but they died
without making any effort to do so. Therefore, if you want to
\0x25A0change a bird's diet, do it gradually.
Some people like to forbid bread and milk, others sop,
others hemp. I have not been able to do so myself. I do not
like bread and milk. I do not care about boiled maize. Both
are apt to go sour, and I think bread and milk likely to give
\0x25A0dysentery, however sweet it may be. But I had to give it to my
Macaws, and boiled maize : they required it and throve on it.
A friend had a Pionus violacens from Guiana. It was very tame,
but it always seemed to be wanting something, and it was not
thriving. This was before I had kept any Macaw, and thought
bread and milk an abomination. Something, I forget what, led
me to try feeding the bird with bits of bread and milk from my
fingers. That was clearly what it wanted, and from that day it
was contented and throve. But there came a day when it,
unlike the Macaws, outgrew its bread and milk, and took to seed.
I have once or twice seen parrots in the bird shops young enough
to be still calling to be fed. Those I should certainly feed with
bread and milk for a time.
I should perhaps have done better to have made my

remarks as to suitable food after each species. In Macaws, as I
have said, I found form}&amp;apos;&amp;apos; scarlet and yellow, my Hyacintliine,.
and my blue and yellows, bread and milk in one tin, boiled
maize in another, and canary and hemp and (with a good deal
more hemp than canary), peanuts in a third, suited them very
well. My Spix, which is really more a Conure than a Macaw,,
will not look at sop of any sort, except sponge cake given from
one's fingers, only drinks plain water, and lives mainly on sun-
flower seed. It has hemp, millet, and canary, and peanuts, but I
do not think eats much of any of them. It barks the branches-
of the tree in which it is loose, and may eat the bark. It would
very likely be all the better if it would eat bread and milk, as it
might then produce some flight feathers, which it never yet lias
had. But I expect it would not eat any sop, even if I gave it
nothing else.
Now Conures I do not know much about, but I should,,
unless there were special reasons for something different, give
them only water, canary, hemp, millet and oats, and peanuts.
Some recommend fruit, but I find parrots care very little about
it. My two rare Amazons, I believe, were largely fed on banana
in Dominica. Augitsta will eat banana, but Bouqueti will not
look at it. They take the fruit, bite a bit, and then throw it
down. I find it difficult, too, to make parrots eat strawberries.
They evidently think them messy, for they shake their heads
violently over them when they taste them. I have known
parrots like them, but with me such parrots have proved the
exception.
To Brotogerys I should give millet, canary and oats, but Mr.
Phillipps will perhaps say what they ought to eat, as he has kept
many of them. I am not sure he has not told us, but away here
at Tarasp, I cannot refer to my Magazine.
Piomis and Chrysotis may have sunflower, hemp, canary,
millet, and peanuts, with rather more hemp than the others. I
always give mine bread and water sop. They do not eat more of
it than they want. If my experience is any guide, and I have
kept not a few parrots, no one need have the least fear of its
upsetting their digestions, or its leading to feather picking. I
have had a good deal to do with feather pickers, because I have
bought them, and borrowed them, to see if I could cure them.
I think I can say I have stopped one case, and that is about all
the success I have had. I have once--in all my experience of
parrots, now extending over a period of 45 years--seen a case of
feather picking that I think was due to improper feeding. The

bird, a Salmon-crested Cockatoo, appeared to tear out its feathers,
and that certainly looked as if it were a case of irritation.
Possibly--I do not know--a case of a Uvoean Paroquet I had
which ate its feathers--at least they went, and were not in the
cage--may have been from something lacking in its diet, which
it missed and tried to supply with its feathers. I had also a
grey which moderately plucked itself before it laid, and that
may have been a nesting instinct; and the case which I stopped,
I stopped by changing from a cage to the aviary, and back again
to the cage, when I saw any signs of the habit. But in almost
all cases the trick, for it is that and nothing else, is learnt while
the bird is preening its feathers. As it passes them through its
beak, it one day begins to nibble, and then you can hardly ever
stop the trick. Even turning them loose in the open air will
not stop it. I had a Gang-Gang Cockatoo from the Zoological
Gardens I tried to cure, and by supplying him with plenty of
wood, green and dry, I got him to leave his breast and back
alone. I turned him loose in a tree, and I thought if he would
only let his flight feathers grow, so that he could fly, I should be
able to restore him a decent bird. His flights began to grow,
and just as I was hoping he might get enough to fly with, he bit
them all off in one or two days. Then I pulled out all the
stumps, and hoped when they were all growing evenly, he would
let them alone. Not a bit of it. Just as they were getting a
hopeful length, they all went again. It is possible that putting
paraffin on the feathers every day might have stopped it, or still
more certainly a leather collar fastened round his neck, and
sticking out far enough to prevent his getting at his feathers.
But it seemed to me cruel to keep a bird from touching his
feathers for months. The bird was not tame enough to let him-
self be caught willingly. With a very tame bird one might take
the collar off once a week, spray him, and after he had arranged
his plumage, put it back. But, as all authorities say, prevention
is better than cure. A parrot is as restless as a monkey, and if
you don't want him to pluck himself, give him plenty to do. I
daresay modern cages have much to answer for. In old days the
binding wire was never soldered, and the birds were always
trying to unfasten it. In modern cages they have nothing to
take hold of, by which they could get it off. One might suppose
that two birds together would amuse each other, and that where
two were kept in one cage, they would not acquire this habit.
But they will, just as a child in the nursery will bite its nails, no
matter how many children it may have to play with. If any-
body likes to hold his opinion that it is from irritation caused by

wrong feeding, I have no wish to disturb their belief. But the
gentle nibble, nibble, nibble, shows me that my parrots certainly
do not do it from irritation, but to amuse themselves.
To return then to our feeding.
All the African Parrots, Psittacus and Pococephalus, may be
fed as Amazons are fed. I should not object to their having a
dry bone to pick to pieces, if they liked it. It is not as good as
wood, bnt if no meat is on it, it will be better to let the bird have
it, than to give it nothing to bite to pieces. However, I must
confess that I have never been able to get any parrot to touch a
bone.
The smaller parrots and the paroquets I give less hemp.
For them I think equal parts of hemp, millet and canary best.
Cockatoos I feed as I feed grey parrots, and all Australian
paroquets need little hemp. Budgerigars want none.
The difficulty of feeding correctly comes with Australasian
and the Spice Islands parrots.
The New Zealand parrakeets ( Cyanorhamphus ), I feed as I
do the smaller Australians. Stringops I have never had. I was
offered one at a high price, but as Sir W. Buller says that even
in New Zealand they have not been kept alive longer than
eighteen months in captivity, I declined the offer. Nestor I
have never had, but Mr. Fulljames told me he parted from his
Notcibilis , because it was so messy a feeder. The late Mr.
Bartlett assured me that when he gave Nestor notabilis (the sheep
eater) mutton chop and Indian corn, it left the mutton chop for
the Indian corn. The form of their bill would almost lead one
to suppose that the}&amp;quot; wanted much the same food as the Lories.
Bnt as it is a fact, that Blue Mountain Lories eat honey in the
wild state, and yet canary seed and millet suit them best in
captivity, I do not see why the Nestors should not be content
with seed.
Polytelis I have never kept, but I believe they want a
certain amount of soft food.
I have never myself been able to get the true Lories, Eos
and Lorius, on to seed, but as far as health is concerned, I found
the following mixture suit them perfectly. Take a dried fig,
pour boiling water over it, let it soak, and then mash it up with
a bun. It need not be given too moist. If ever I had the luck
to get the tiny Coj&amp;apos;iphili from the Fiji Islands, I should try that.
The species that beats me is Nymphicus. To look at their
bills you would say they were seed-eaters ; but I bought a lot of
eight once, which looked healthy enough. They all died, one

after the other, of digestive troubles. And I have had other
specimens, which I have kept for twelve months or so, but then
they have died. They have never been kept very long in the
Zoological Gardens. I cannot but think they would live longer,
if we knew how to feed them correctly.
I think I have now run over the kinds of parrots I have
had, and that are most likely to come into the hands of my
readers, but if any particular difficulty should arise, I am always
willing to do my best in the way of advice. But I can only say
what I have said before, that the longer I live, the more the small-
ness of our knowledge about birds' wants and birds' diseases
strikes me.
[Since writing- the above, Mr. Farrar has told us that he gives his Barrabands noth-
ing but hemp and canary. I certainly have always found bread and water sops a great
help to the old birds when they are rearing young.--F. G. D.]

THE MASKED PARRAKEET.

Avicultural Magazine, so I thought a few remarks on this

eminently handsome and interesting bird might be worthy of a
place amongst the series of " Rare Foriegn Birds" which have
appeared at various times ; though not so rare as some which
have been described, it is a bird which is rarely offered for sale.
The size of P. personata is about equal to the well-known
King Parrakeet, though possibly a shade longer. The plumage
is for the most part bright green, the feathers being of a hairy
texture and with a lustre approaching that of the Resplendent
Trogon ; the face to the back of the eyes is black, so are the
beak and tail; the feet are very dark grey, and the flight-feathers
of the wings dark blue ; the eyes bright orange, and the bell}&amp;apos;&amp;quot;
yellow, deeper in colour near the vent.
This bird has the power of dilating and contracting the
pupil of the eye, which it always does when excited. The
specimen in my possession is very tame, and a great favourite.
I feed him on hemp, canary, and oats, with all sorts of fruit, and
plenty of green food ; he is very fond of twigs of various trees
with the bark left on.
For the most part he is a very quiet bird; but at dusk
every evening he hangs head downwards from the top of his
cage and gives several hoarse Raven-like croaks, so startling

that one's hair almost stands upright with the shock : apart from
this there is nothing objectionable about him, and he will stop
diredtly he is spoken to.
He holds everything in his feet when eating (generally
the left foot) and he is a remarkably good climber, for he will
walk up the side of his cage holding on with his feet alone, and
carrying a piece of orange or other fruit in his beak.
I should like to know if anything has been discovered
regarding the sex of this Parrakeet, as, according to Dr. Greene's
&amp;lt;l Parrots in Captivity," that gentleman supposed P. splendens to
be the female, because no female of P. persojiata or male of
splendens had been recorded ; though in his description of the
latter he abandons the theory, and describes the female of
P. splendens.
The Masked Parrakeet is a native of the Fiji Islands, and,
in my opinion, a beautiful and most desirable bird.

Agelasticus humeralis.
By Arthur G. Butler, Ph.D.
This bird is a native of Cuba, and is nearly related to the
Yellow-shouldered Marsh-Troupial. As I was called to account
for altering the trivial name of the Spotted Pardalote for the
benefit of aviculturists, I do not doubt that I shall be severely
reprimanded for applying the generic name proposed by Cabanis
to the group of yellow-shouldered birds : I will therefore at once
explain that, as an aviculturist, I am entirely opposed to the
union in one genus of the thick-billed, extremely wild forms
typical of Agelceus, with the more slender, longer-billed and con-
fiding forms for which Cabanis proposed the name of Agelasticus.
The latter are far more nearly related to the Hang-nests
in their method of feeding; for I find that they do far
better (in captivity at any rate) if fed precisely like Hang-nests
than as I first treated them--on insects and seeds, and in their
form they much more closely resemble true Starlings, than the
red-shouldered and brown-headed forms of the genus Agelmis,
all of which are considerably more like Cow-birds.
I had two males of the common Yellow-shouldered Marsh-
Troupial in 1S94, and fed them chiefly on seed, giving a little
soft food now and then but no fruit: neither of them lived
many months.

Early in June of the present year, I received a letter from
Mr. Maximilian Praschkauer, of the well-known firm of bird-food
importers, asking me if I would be willing to accept a rare
" Oriole," which had been his wife's pet for the past ten years,
and had accompanied him and his wife wherever they journeyed.
This bird was purchased in America, where at the time he was
travelling on business ; his wife had become so fond of it, that
the constant anxiety lest it should fall a victim to some prowling
cat, while she was out for a walk or on a visit, at length
convinced her that she would be happier if it were in the hands
of someone, who would take care of and protect it against injury.
I found that this bird had been fed chiefly upon moistened
sponge-cake and fruit, even mealworms having been only given
once or twice, as its mistress was afraid lest they might prove
injurious.
The bird came into my hands about the middle of the
month : it had up to that time, been kept in a waggon-shaped
brass-wired cage with receptacles for food and water at each end.
This cage was about fifteen inches in length by ten inches in
width, therefore it did not offer much space for exercise ; certainly
none for flight. I transferred it, or induced it, by the offer of a
mealworm, to transfer itself to a flight-cage, three feet six inches
in length, and about eighteen inches wide : it flew up to a perch,
but was afraid to descend to the floor of its cage, until I gave it a
spider, which it carelessly dropped and could not resist the
temptation of recovering it ; it therefore hung from below the
perch, first by both feet, then by one, finally letting go and
alighting on the sand : it however took several days to acquire
perfect confidence in the use of its wings.
At first I supposed this bird to be merely an oddly coloured
male of the Yellow-shouldered Marsh-Troupial, but on examin-
ing the skins at the Natural History Museum, I discovered that
no such variation occurred in that species : I therefore looked at
the allied species and recognized my bird under A. humeralis.
Dr. Sclater describes the wing-coverts as yellowisli-brown,
but this conveys the impression of brown washed with yellow,
whereas the real colour is satiny ochre-yellow with a faint
suspicion of a sienna brownish wash over it ( c ). When the
bird stands up high, a few small bright yellow feathers become
visible at the back of the thighs, a character not recorded either
in this species or A. thilius \ the under wing-converts are pale
creamy sulphur-yellow. As compared with A. thilius, with its
(c). Russ describes the coverts as reddish yellow.

bright narcissus-yellow shoulder, the present species might be
regarded as having a brownish shoulder, but there is very little
brown in it, even in the dullest-coloured examples.
Unlike the Yellow-shouldered bird, the song of which (as
I have noted in my article on the species in the Feathered World,&amp;apos;)
reminds one strongly of the sound made by working the handle
of an old iron pump--" Chinker-on - king- tsch wee, ' ' the present
species has a distinctly pleasing song; not unlike that of a
Canary, as a Starling might be expected to sing it if taught; it
is a little more reedy in character than a Canary's song, and has
a few somewhat harsh notes in it, but altogether I prefer it to the
performance of the finch.
I don't know whether it is because my example has been
allowed to have his own way in everything, but he is certainly
not a polite bird; he not only cries for everything which he
fancies may be good to eat, uttering a peevish waa (with the
tune of the word ware less the r) but when he is offered the
dainty, he repeats the sound, as if he were abusing you for giving
it to him.
Since the bird came into my possession, he has distinctly
improved in glossiness of feather ; he bathes every day and takes
plenty of exercise : although he by no means dispises cock-
roaches, he certainly prefers mealworms : when eating preserved
}mlk, he generally dabs it two or three times into banana to
soften it before swallowing it; orange appears to be his favourite
fruit, but a thin slice of apple is much relished.
I have given the name " Flame-shouldered " to this bird
because I can discover no other : it has never visited our Zoo,
but in Germany it was first imported in 1887, and was successfully
bred in 1S88. Russ calls it " The Gregarious-Starling with fiery-
red wing coverts," but that is too long for a trivial name and is
incorrect.
Gundlacli gives the following account of its wild life:--
" Common, and lives less in the forests than in the borders of the
woods, and other places where there are trees. In the autumn
they unite into communities, which at that time make havoc of the
millet- and rice-fields. Later in the winter they seek their food
in the plantations, feeding in the pig-sties or the drying-traj^s
used for sugar. Also they search for nectar in the larger flowers
of trees. In the afternoon they assemble in considerable numbers
on lofty trees or bamboo cane to rest, and there each of these birds
from time to time exercises his monotonous voice, so that from
the multitude of these cries, a great but not unpleasing sound

arises. At the least alarm they are instantly silent, but as soon
as this is comprehended, they again commence their noise.
Occasionally they are combined with other species of the family,
and then the concert produced by all together is even more
complete.
"This Starling nests in April and May, constructing its
nest on slenderly branched sites on the trees, or on the leaf-
sheathes of palms, or between the large leaves of the Bromelias
living as parasites on the trees, of dry plants, hair, feathers, etc.
The laying consists of four eggs."
Thieuemann describes the eggs as somewhat elongated,
not symmetrical, grey-greenish-white, sparsely dotted with grey
and black-brownish points, which are wanting at the apex, but
numerous at the base, which is covered by a large brown patch
and small black-brown dots. Length 22 mm. breadth 14 mm.
The nest which was built in captivity, was so deep that
only the bills of the young birds could be seen, so that the
nestling plumage could not be described : but five days after
leaving the nest, the young birds chiefly differed from their
parents in their inferior size and yellowish wing-coverts.

The actual difficulties to be surmounted on ship board
during the transit of birds from the Antipodes are many and
varied, and probably a rough sketch of the average trip might
interest not a few. Having selected your stock and received the
same on board, all seems well while on the coast with nice warm
weather and plenty of sunshine, but after leaving Adelaide and
clearing Kangaroo Island, the land dips to the North West,
while the ship keeps on her Westerly course and immediately
plunges into the Great Australian Bight with its very change-
able and boisterous weather, the thermometer invariably di&amp;apos;opping
often 15 0 to 25* in one night; the sky becomes overcast, heavy
w 7 eather sets in, and the ship starts plungingand rolling heavily;
the cages and boxes are stacked away as snugly as possible, but
alwa}^s in some corner where the only light they have is through
a ioin. or i2in. port hole, which, with every other roll of the
ship, is under water ; so little light penetrates the cages, that

one is often glad when dusk sets in and the electric light is
turned on to give the birds sufficient light to see their food.
Occasionally too, to add to your difficulties and to the discomfort
of the birds, one of the boxes breaks adrift and you find it,
generally, face down on the floor, with sand, water, and seed in
a pulp, sticking all over the cage and sand-tray at an angle of 45 0
in the box. This state of affairs often lasts from three to five
days. After rounding Cape Lewin, you meet with more
genial weather and have the stock removed to some sheltered
spot as near the open as possible, as it is yet too cold to take
them right out on the deck, especially Gouldians, which, when
freshly caged, I find the most sensitive to cold ; they will rarely
stand a less temperature than 75 0 ; at 70* they get ruffled up
with their head tucked under the wing and drop off rapidly.
After a few mere days the weather gets quite warm and it is
perfectly safe to have the stock transferred to the open, and need-
less to say the birds thoroughly enjoy the warmth, fresh air, and
daylight. In a week's time you begin to compliment yourself
on the condition of the stock, when you are plunged into the
stifling moist atmosphere of the Indian Ocean, from thence to
the Gulf of Aden and Red Sea. During this period Gouldians
improve daily, but most other specimens feel it very trying,
gasping all day for breath and resting on the perches with out-
spread wings. Towards sundown they simply go mad with joy
and eat their evening meal ravenously. They are now always
left on deck over night (my boxes are all double fronted, iin.
space between each wire front for protection against rats).
During the Mediterranean passage they pick up wonderfully 7 and
by the time they reach home (should the weather from Gibraltar
to the Channel be fairly mild) are in grand condition. Sometimes
boisterous weather is met with from the Portuguese Coast to the
Thames, when a repetition of the Australian Bight difficulties
occurs, but on a modified scale, as there is more space on the
ship, consequently 7 more light and air, and to the happy survivors
more cage space.
As to food and general treatment during the voyage,
Gouldians, Bichenos, Crimson Finches, Grass Finches, etc.,
have canary seed and Indian millet in separate boxes, spray
millet and cuttlefish, with sea sand and finely 7 ground shell on
cage bottom, fresh daily 7 and thoroughly 7 cleaned out every second
or third day, outside bath on cage daily 7 . With this treatment I
find they do exceptionally 7 well with me and always arrive home
clean and in grand condition. Parrakeets have the usual

mixture of canary, hemp, millet, oats, and crushed maize,
according to variety. Lorikeets always boiled bread and milk
(Nestle's condensed) first thing daily, which generally lasts them
two to three hours; canary seed remainder of day. On this diet
I find Swainsons' and the Scaly-breasted do very well, but the
Musky Lorikeet and some others will never touch the seed, so
have fruit (bananas or ripe pears) instead when procurable. For
insectivorous birds, I have no hard and fast rule, their treatment
is so variable, but for the general stock food I use that recom-
mended by Mr. Fulljames in Vol. iv, pages 44-5, with fruit or
mealworms where necessary. I take a particular delight in
getting my birds into, and landing them in faultless condition
when possible, and generally succeed, as very few die soon after
importation, and this considering I always carry most delicate
and rare stock.
With reference to Mr. Fillmer's article 011 Wood Swallows
in the December number of Avicultural Magazine , probably that
gentleman will be glad to learn that his conjecture was correct
in thinking they were hand reared ; I reared them from the nest,
and perhaps he will be more surprised to learn that the parents
are the pair first possessed by Mr. Fulljames and exhibited
several times by him.
In the March number of Magazine, Mr. Farrar has an
article on the Lunulated Honey Eater, in which he principally
refers to the diet. Now, I have imported many Honey Eaters,
including the Warty-faced Yellow-tufted (Ptilotis auricomus)
also P. lewinii, the Bell bird (Manorhina melanophrysJ Black-
capped (Melithreptus atricapillus) and the Garrulous. I tried
them all on pure honey which they one and all took to greedily,
refusing to taste any other food while honey remained, but
never found them do well on it; besides I found it impossible to
keep the birds clean if kept in cages. The Larger Honey Eaters
are easily kept and will partake of any good insectivorous food
with addition of fruit and mealworms.
The Smaller Honey Eaters are much harder to cater for,
but I find they do fairly well on bread and milk-sop sweetened
with honey. I shall be glad to hear at the end of the season how
Mr. Farrar succeeds with his Lunulated Honey Eaters in his
garden aviary.

By A. Savage.
A critical period of a foreign cage - bird's life is,
undoubtedly, the first month after its arrival from its native
country. Many have had anything but " a pleasant trip over
the state in which they arrive shows it--and nearly all are at
least much fatigued by the journey, and require special care the
first few weeks they are in the hands of their owner, more so if
rare or valuable birds. It frequently happens that a bird, which
seemed in good health when in its cage at the dealer's, goes
wrong shortly after it conies into the possession of the purchaser.
One gentlemen told me, not long ago, when speaking on this
point, " they come to me to die." It is a great mistake to take a
newly-arrived bird home and turn it out immediately into a large
aviary containing other birds, especially if an outdoor one and
the weather is bad--but this, it is to be feared, is often done. A
new arrival requires rest and quietness and, nearly always, a
little nursing. In a large aviary with other birds it cannot get
this, consequently, cage-life, alone , for the first few weeks is
necessary. A bird in a cage can be closely watched and treat-
ment given as soon as it seems to be going the wrong way. The
complaints a newly-imported bird most frequently suffers from
are, probably stomach, bowel and lung disorders, and if it is in
this way afflicted, and not properly looked after, it soon goes over
to the great majority. Symptoms of these ailments-- a glassy e3^e
ruffled feathers, drowsiness and panting--" beating time, as it
were, with its wings and tail, to its breathing." We have a
preparation, on this side of the Channel for stomach and bowel
disorders, which has rendered me good service on more than one
occasion, viz. : gentian, cinnamon, anise, and ginger, all in
powders, mixed in equal parts (say, {oz. each) and a pinch
dusted over the seed given to the bird every morning, till it is
better. For lung complaints, I generally give Tibbs' Canaradyne.
{This is not intended as an advertisement--other preparations
may be good, but I have found the one mentioned very useful).
For over twelve months I had a fine cock Rufous-tail
Finch without a mate, and, a few months ago, saw a cock and
two hens in a bird-shop. I purchased the odd hen ; she appeared
in good condition, but I put her, nevertheless, into a small indoor
aviary with the cock. In less than a week, the glassy eye became
visible, ruffled feathers were to be seen, and the " beating time"

business, as previously mentioned, began. She was evidently ill,
and getting into a critical condition. I treated her as above--
ten drops of Canaradyne, daily, in half-a-wineglass of water (no
other water given), and dusted the seed over every morning with
a pinch of the powder-mixture referred to. In a couple of weeks
she was much better; she eventually moulted and is now in the
best of health, flying about in a large outdoor aviary with a
number of other birds. She looked well enough to go there the
day I bought her, but had I put her there at first, I should
probably have lost her.
It no doubt gives a little trouble to cage birds alone for
the first few weeks after their arrival, but one is well repaid for
doing so, especially if they are rare or valuable ; it prevents
losses in many instances. All the newly-imported birds I buy,
I cage alone for a few weeks, and watch their progress--Parra-
keets as well as small birds.
The powder-mixture can also be used for stomach and
bowel disorders in fowls, pheasants, and partridges--a pinch per
bird per day, mixed with the soft food in the morning. Or, if no
soft food is given, a few drops of salad-oil can be put on the
grain given at the morning meal; add the powder to that, and
well mix up. The oil makes the powder adhere to the grain,
and in eating the grain the powder is taken with it.

My notes for this month will, of necessity, be rather short,
chiefly because I have been unable to visit the Gardens, and also
because the list of arrivals gives 110 hint of any family which
might furnish me with an excuse for an article.
We may notice the list of breeding birds this month,
which, although of the ordinary character, is slightly larger than
last year's ; the Great Black-backed Gulls have succeeded in
rearing their brood this year ; and three species of Pigeons ; the
Glossy Ibises have, as usual, brought off their young.
Two species are new to the collection, viz. : the Red-
banded Lorikeets from N. W. Australia, and the Sulphury
Buntings from Japan ; but neither of them call for any special
notice. The only other bird to be noted is the Silky Cow Bird,
which is an inhabitant of S. America, and resembles in its habits
our common Starling, accompanying the large herds of cattle
which wander over the plains of that Continent.

CORRESPONDENCE
ORNITHOLOGY versus AVICULTURE.

Sir, --I have said all I have to say in support of my proposal to
extend the scope of the Magazine. The idea seems to have many enemies
and no friends but myself. If there are any in favour of it--let us hear
from them. If there are none, the subject had better drop.
I should be glad if Dr. Butler would have the kindness to point out
When and where I endeavoured to "persuade" anyone " that aviculture and
the fancy are one and the same thing." Until he has done this, I think
that the less he says about " misrepresenting facts," the better. I am in no
danger of imagining " aviculturist " and "fancier" to be Synonymous--
neither do I think, as some of us appear to do, that "fancier" and "fool *
are two names for the same thing.
In the first number of this Magazine, an aviculturist was defined as
" a person interested in the keeping and breeding of birds." I object to
any narrowing of the meaning of the term.
This correspondence has brought to light a tendency among a section
of the Council to confuse aviculture with ornithology, t(c) exalt the scientific
side of our pursuit at the expense of the practical, and to subordinate the
interests of the Society to the supposed wishes and prejudices of the few
members who are scientific ornithologists. This appears to me to be a
much more serious and important matter than the adoption or rejection or
liiv " proposal," and if this tendency grows and developes, there will soon
be no room in the Society for such an unscientific aviculturist as
Horatio R. Fieemer.
SPRAY MILLET.
I hasten to correct my answer to Mrs. Keith Maitland's question in
the August Number. There is, I find, a very small Indian Millet, much finer
than the the common Spray or African Millet. Mr, J. Abrahams has sent
me a beautiful sample of it. It can, I presume, be obtained from him.

Sir, -- I have had Grey Singing-finches affected with the disease
\0x25A0described by Miss Husband--also the European Serin-finch. It is, in my
experience, a disease almost peculiar to the genus Serinus, or at any rate
one to which they are more liable than other birds. Not being a doctor,
I can say nothing as to the cause or nature of the malady--but it did not
seem to be contagious. Horatio R. Fieemer.

Sir, --Will you kindly advise me how to treat my cock Bullfinch
(Russian); he has been suffering from diarrhoea for the last ten daj^s, with
loss of appetite, sitting moped and ruffled. I gave him two doses of castor
oil, with an interval of three days, and fed him on bread and milk, soaked
crushed rape seed and a few ants' eggs. Now I have added a little crushed
hemp seed mixed with the rape, and some of Abraham's egg, as he seemed
in want of more nourishment and was much better and more lively, but
still breaths rather quickly, and I observed yesterday had lost the feathers

round both his eyes, having bald patches, otherwise he is not moulting.
I want to know whether he might have green food, and when he may
return to canary and rape seed, his usual food. The ants' eggs were the
first things that seemed to do him good, and his appetite is much improved
and the complaint lessened to-day for the first time.
Shall be much obliged for your advice. M. W. E. Ward.
The following reply was sent to Airs. Somerset Ward:
In reply to yours of 7th iust., your Bullfinch appears to me to have
been suffering from a cold, though he seems to have got over the worst.
Feed on a generous diet i.e., canary, rape, and a little hemp, but when he has
hemp let him also have green food, groundsel, chickweed or lettuce. I
should also continue for a time, ants' eggs and Abrahams' egg, or ordinary
hard-boiled egg, and gradually drop it off. Later on, when privet berries
come in, I should let him have plenty of them if convenient, as they form
a large part of Bullfinches natural food at that time of year. See that the
cage is in a fairly regular, though not necessarily high temperature and
that it is not placed in a draught. J. LEWIS BonhotE.

Sir,--I should be thankful if you could give me any information as
to the cause of my hen Pekin Robin's death.
A pair of these birds lived in perfect health for four years, and were
in show plumage and condition. Suddenly the lieu began to tear out her
feathers, especially 011 her left side, till her body was bare and raw. At the
same time, she was evidently suffering severely. She was at once isolated,
kept perfectly quiet, and given an increase of insect food, but she never
ceased tearing at her feathers, and died within two day&amp;apos;s from the first attack.
Her skin was perfectly clean, and free from any insect trouble : indeed both
birds are such frequent bathers, and keep themselves so clean, it would be
difficult for anything of that sort to gain a footing. They 7 have never
attempted to breed. Their food is the usual mixture, with mealworms,
flies, caterpillars, and fruit in season.
If you can tell me the cause of the disease I should be thankful, also
for any 7 advice as to its treatment in case it should recur. The birds are
kept in an unlieated room. E- F. Chawner.
7 &amp;apos;he following answer has been sent to Aliss Chawner :
Feather-plucking is due in most cases to irritation of the skin, the
only 7 exception I know of is in the case of the Cardinals, the males tearing
out their breast-feathers when courting, apparently to show off to the hens;
but, possibly, as with Canaries, to provide material with which to line the
nest.
Liothrix is subject, more than most birds, to liver trouble ; which is
liable to produce a hot irritable skin. The best remedy would be to
commence with a mild purgative--about six grains of Epsom salts in the
drinking-water for one day 7 ; on the following dav give fifteen drops of
laudanum and a teaspoonful of dandelion-juice ( taraxacumj in the drinking-
water ; then, for a week or so, give the dandelion-juice without the
laudanum ; and complete the cure by about ten drops of tincture of iron
and quinine in the drinking-water for several day&amp;apos;s. A. G. BUTRER.

The subject of this paper is so well known now, and so
closely resembles, both in habits and plumage, the familiar
Parson-finch (P. cincta ) that I fear I can record nothing concern-
ing it that is new to the majority of our readers.
Our esteemed fellow-aviculturist, Mr. R. A. Todd, was, I
believe, the first to breed this beautiful species in England (vol.
III. p. 210) ; and probably since that time a great many have
been reared by other members, for it seems to reproduce its kind
in captivity quite as readily as the Parson-finch ; and I believe
several aviary-bred specimens were exhibited at the Palace and
elsewhere last year. Tike most of the Grassfinches the sexes are
identical in plumage, and I know of no certain way of ascertaining
the sex of a given bird. I believe, as a rule, the males are
slightly the larger birds and the centre tail-feathers are some-
what longer than in the females. I have heard also that the
white tip to the lateral tail feathers is only to be found in the
females ; but this is certainly not alwa3^s the case, as some
undoubted males in my possession have this mark, although it
is certainly more pronounced in the females ; possibty, however,
it may be absent in very old males.
I have found this species quite trustworthy in a mixed
collection, although its temper is certainly not of the sweetest
type, and it knows how to fight well enough when other birds
intrude too near to its nest.
The song, which is not often uttered, appears to me to be
absolutely identical with that of its congener the Parson-finch,
with which species it interbreeds freely enough ; and I think it
most probable that the young hybrids would be perfectly fertile
amongst themselves or with either of the parent species, so
closely do the two resemble one another in all their ways. Mr.

Phillipps has this year reared some of these hybrids from a male
P. cinctci and a female P. acuticauda, and he will be able to
prove in due time whether these will breed.
The Tong-tailed Grassfinch is a very rapid flyer and is a
particularly graceful bird ; I hardly ever have seen a specimen
in really rough plumage ; it seems always to keep itself sleek and
trim.
The colour of the bill seems to vary somewhat in this
species, and I have sometimes thought there must be two distinct
forms. Some specimens have the bill orange yellow, in others
it is quite a reddish orange, and certainly the ones with the
yellower bills seem to be the largest birds and to have the best
developed tail-feathers. That this variation in the colour of the
bill has nothing to do with sex I am perfectly satisfied, for I
have at the present time undoubted pairs of both varieties, and
I am also satisfied that age has nothing to do with it.
I have found egg-shaped reed baskets, seven or eight
inches in length with a hole in one end, greatly appreciated by
this and the other Grassfinches both for sleeping and nesting in,
although the nest is also often built amongst the branches in the
aviary without any artificial framework ; and the only two young
reared this year in my aviary were hatched in a nest of this kind.
Grass seems to be the material mostly used.
Mr. Phillipps has already pointed out (vol. IV., p. 187) the
singular way in which the genus Poephila is divided up into
pairs ; first we have the Tong-tailed {P. acuticauda) and Parson
Finches (. P.cinda ), resembling one another in all their ways and
in the markings of their plumage, the only differences apparent^
being in the colour of the bill and feet and the length of the two
central tail-feathers. Then there are the more delicate but
equally beautiful White - eared (Z 5 . leucotis) and Masked
Grassfinches (P. personated) very closely resembling one another,
but both differing greatly from the first couple. Lastly, there
are the two forms of the Gouldian Finch (P. gotildice and P.
mirabilis), breeding freely together and identical in all but the
markings on the head, but absolutely unlike the other two
couples in every way. It seems to me very strange that all these
should be placed in the same genus.
The Tong-tailed Grassfinch inhabits the North and North-
west of Australia.
The prevailing colour of the adult is pinkish - brown ;
upper and under tail-coverts white, with a black band across the
rump ; head delicate pearly-grey ; a patch of deep black on the

Some four years ago, the Long-tailed, the White-eared,
and the Masked Grassfinckes were practically unknown to the
majority of aviculturists in this country ; but then there came a
flood of them, and the three species have since been almost
common.
More than once in our Magazine have I referred
incidentally to the species which forms the subject of this
paper. In September, 1S97, at P a g e X S5 of vol. III., I gave
a short account of its habits as a squatter. And in August and
September of the following year, under the heading of The
White-eared Grassfinch, I gave some further particulars, drawing
comparisons between the two species, especially at pages 186-187.
And members who are interested in these little finches, wdiich
are somewhat alike and occasionally mistaken for one another,
should compare Mr. Peter Smit's beautiful illustration of the
White Ear which faces page 169 of vol. IV. with that of the
Masked Grassfinch, which I understand has been most kindly
painted by Mr. Seth-Smith and is to appear with this article. In
my opinion, not only do illustrations, especially when coloured,
greatfy add to the interest of a magazine, but are of immense
assistance to aviculturists in helping them to identify their pets.
&amp;apos;We ought, therefore, to be particularly grateful to Mr. Seth-Smith
for thus ornamenting our Magazine, and enabling us to see at a
glance the difference between Poephila lencotis and P. personata.
I fear that I have not much of interest to say about the
Masked Grassfinch. It has from time to time nested with me,
but, from various causes, has never brought matters to a
satisfactory conclusion. And it is difficult to know exactly when
they are really nesting and when constructing only a squatting
place. More than once have I said to myself, " Behold, they
nest! " when they were building only something on which to
squat. At a bird show, it is very pretty to see these birds
squatting side by side on the bottoms of their cages ; but, when

they have liberty in an ordinary room, this habit of squatting;
becomes an element of danger. In a room they will probably
squat on the draughty floor, facing the room, with their raised
tails against the wainscot, or, worse still, on the window itself a
most dangerous place.
In the garden aviary, until they had learned wisdom by
bitter experience, my birds, when first let out, used to sit on the
ground, and passed a great part of several weeks on a sunny
hillock. But a hillock in London is not often a sunny one for
any length of time ; and when cold and wet followed the warm
weather they built for themselves a squatting place (I flattered
myself that they were nesting) against a post, amongst the
Virginia creeper stems, aud completely covered by the leaves.
Probably it was because of the denseness of the foliage that they
did not make a covering to this structure. It was about two feet
from the ground, several inches high, rounded laterally, with a
flat side against the post, nearly flat on the top, with the solid
part largest above and tapering off below, like a rounded
pedestal. It was made entirely of dry grasses, broad ones pre-
dominating, with the peculiarity that from top to bottom, and
all round excepting against the post, the grass ends were
arranged so as to hang down some 3-6 inches, not in chance
confusion, but with what had the appearance of being designed
symmetry and orderly arrangement, like a fashionable shower
bouquet. It was a remarkable piece of architecture, and worthy
of being preserved, but was so interwoven amidst the stems that
I found it would be impossible to remove it without cutting
the stems and destroying a large mass of Virginia creeper.
During the summer it was quite hidden ; and it was not until
the autumn, when the creeper had shed its leaves, that I was
able to see and appreciate it fully. The Masks were removed
to their winter quarters ; and, since, their natural instincts seem
to have become blunted, or they have turned lazy, for they are
usually satisfied with ordinary nesting boxes, or the deserted
nests of other birds. In truth my Masks have proved them-
selves, with the one exception mentioned above, very inferior
architects, and sadly lacking in energy and perseverance
compared with the White - eared Grassfinches, whose nests
and squatting places, alike in general character but varying
considerably in detail to suit varying circumstances, continue to
surprise and please me year by year.
In the early summer of 1899, an odd male Mask paired
with an odd female White Ear, a nest being built in the heart of

*some hay which had been arranged against a wall behind some
lattice-work. After some time the female entirely disappeared ;
and when I was able to institute a search I found her dead on the
nest, still sitting on her eggs. It was not a case of egg-binding.
The faithful little creature had stuck to her post through cold
and rain, and had perished while still "mothering" her four
clear eggs. For how long she had been sitting on them I cannot
form an opinion. This failure does not alter the opinion I
expressed at page 170 of vol. IV., so far as it relates to the
probable fertility of eggs produced by birds of these two species
pairing together. The birds require warmth, and my aviary is
too cold for them. But a longer acquaintance with them has
taught me very plainly that, like other species, these two will not
interbreed under normal conditions.
A nice open aviary, thickly planted with trees and shrubs,
is a charming place in theory; but in our uncertain climate it
sometimes produces disastrous results. This is the second time
that I have lost a valuable mother from wet and cold. More-
over, from time to time I lose strong, healthy, young birds, not
so often in as after they have left their nests. Branchers of many
species keep night and day in the trees, and wet and cold are
often too much for them. The opinion that one sometimes sees
expressed that, if the young of delicate foreign birds could be
hatched and brought up in the open air they would be as hardy
as Britishers, is a delusion. As a rule, the young are less hardy
than the adults--at least I think so. But there is a happy
reverse side to the picture. I have never had a single case of
ordinary egg-binding in my garden. On the very few occasions
that I have had a case of egg-binding, it has been in the house.
But 1 must confess to having lost not less than two females from
inflammation of the ovary, caused by cold. And, again, many
species will nest in a natural aviary which will not nest in an
artificial one ; and it is only in the former that the real natures
and habits of many species can be observed.
1 understand that the Masked Grassfinch has not been
bred in this country. The Natural History Museum Catalogue
(vol. XIII., p. 377) says of the young, " Browner than the adult,
with a blackish bill; the whole plumage with less pink, and the
black mask and flank-spots not so pronounced."
The sexes are practically alike; and there is something
about the bird which tends to mislead one as to the sex in a very
provoking manner. I think the male is a larger, more energetic
bird, with a thicker and more strongly-curved bill.

It is only fair to the Masked Grassfinches to add that I
have never cared so much for them, and have not, except
perhaps at first, given them such fair and favoured treatment as
the White Ears have received at my hands. This should be
borne in mind, and also that I have far too many companions
for them, for under favourable conditions they might have done
much better.
The Masked Grassfinch is a quiet, amiable bird, but, in
my opinion, is neither so elegant, so engaging, nor so rare as
the White Ear. It is quite as delicate, some think much more
so. Nevertheless it is a nice bird, which I most strongly
recommend our members to add to their collections--if they
cannot get the White Ear.

In the present article I am going to write of some of the
birds from the lowlands or hotter parts of Ecuador, in the same
way that in my last article I wrote about some of those from the
higher mountain regions.
To begin with, I will take the Toucan-like Barbet ( Tetra-
gonops rhamphastinus ) from the forests of the Pacific side, as I
kept one of them for a time, at Gualea. These handsome birds,
in the texture of their feathers and arrangement of colours,
much resemble the Andigena laminirostris, and somewhat
strangely, too, the}- come from the same localities, between four
to six thousand feet, which is their usual home ; but, it is
probable that, like the Toucan, they range to a still higher
altitude at certain seasons of the 3 r ear. While we were collect-
ing at Gualea, a boy brought me one of these birds, slightly
injured in one wing. He had it carefully tied up in his poncho,
and I naturally at once put my hand in to take it out, but I
could not have withdrawn it quicker had there been a snake in it
instead of a bird ; for it hung on to the back of my hand, and
would not let go until its beak was forced open with an awl. Its
tenacity was astonishing, and I never remember having a worse
bite from a bird, except from a Macaw. One has only to look at
its strong corrugated bill to realize the bite it could give ; beside,
the extreme tip of the lower mandible forms a slightly projecting

tooth on each side, which the upper one fits into. However,
when transferred to a " changara," a kind of basket with open
meshes, it quickly became resigned to captivity, and fed
readily on almost anything that was offered to it. It was
surprising how soon it came to know those who were in the
habit of feeding it ; and whenever I entered the hut, it always
expected me to give it some dainty. Its staple diet was boiled
potatoes, which was about all we could get there ; but at times
I gave it various kinds of berries ; some it would eat readily,
but others it rejected altogether. Insects of all kinds it de-
devoured greedily, especially cockroaches, and it was its passion
for these that caused it to become tame so quickly. It was a
silent bird, and I cannot remember that I heard it utter any sort
of sound while I had it ; but, unfortunately, its quarters were so
confined that it had no chance of showing itself off to advantage,
or to exhibit any talents it might have possessed. I was obliged
to leave it at Gualea while we went further down into the forests,
and on my return a few weeks later, I was told it had escaped.
I had looked forward so much to getting it back to Quito, where
I could have given it better accommodation, and had more
opportunities of finding out its good or bad qualities. These
birds are confined solety to Ecuador, and are found only on the
Pacific side. They are very striking looking birds, and attract
special attention even among such a varied collection of beautiful
birds as we made. Its total length is eight-and-a-half inches,
and in shape is rather a bulk}' - and thick-set bird. To describe
it minutely is rather difficult, but I will try to give a general
impression of it. To begin with, the top of the head is glossy
black, which colour narrows towards the nape, where the feathers
are an inch long and lie in a point on the back. They have
such a gloss on them that they quite glitter, and the black
extends in a narrow shining collar half way round the neck.
From just above the base of the eye is a patch of white, which
reaches back to the collar. At times my bird rather spread or
puffed these feathers out, but I never saw it raise the long
feathers on the neck, which really look like a long crest coming
from the top of the head. The sides of the head, throat, and
fore part of the breast are a fine mauvish-grey, and a broad band
of shining blood-red crosses the centre of the breast, and in very
adult specimens continues right down the centre to the vent.
The flanks and lower parts of the breast are orange mixed with
green, and the vent is greenish-grey. The back is an exceedingly
rich shade of golden-brown, rather greenish in some lights, and
the rump is chrome-yellow. The tail is slaty-blue, and the

wings the same colour, but the flights are edged with dark
greenish yellow. The bill, which is surrounded at the base with
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.999383285714285" page_id="32638105"  page_num="264" year="" vol="">
stout black bristles, is yellow with a black tip, and a patch of
dull red on each side at the base. Those who are unacquainted
with the bird, but can picture it in their mind from 1113^
description, will see that it is a bird of no ordiuar\ r appearance.
We collected, perhaps, a dozen of them at various localities, and
I have some which are blackish red on the head and collar, but
not having them at hand to refer to, I cannot remember if they
are labelled females or young. They were b}^ no means easy
birds to see in the forests, and we found them always singly or
in pairs.
Of the true South American Barbets we obtained three
kinds from the Western side at about coast level. They were
the Capito bourcieri , C. richardsoni , and the rare C. squamatus;
and from the Napo, on the Eastern side, C. punctatxis was the
only one we met with. The bourcieri is by far the handsomest of
the lot, and is locally called the "Ruisenor," which is the Spanish
for Nightingale. I cannot imagine why it is so called, for, as far
as I could make out, it has no song whatever, neither does it in
the least resemble our sombre plumaged songster, with its head
and breast of intensely brilliant red, its yellow underparts, bright
green back and wings, and its stout-looking bill. Its wife also
is delicately and peculiarly coloured of a style all her own, and
under ordinal circumstances would be considered a rather
bright coloured bird even for a male. We met with them only
in the forests, and did not find them at all common anywhere.
The richardsoni is a small bird, barely five inches long, and much
resembles the preceding species in its colours, but is a little
more variegated. The sqitamahis is very distinct, being glossy
blue-black and creamy-white, with a yellowish-red forehead.
The only place where we saw these birds was at Santo Domingo
in the dusk of the evening,when Mr. Hamilton saw three together
on a dead tree on the edge of the forest. He killed two of them,
but only recovered one, as it was impossible to find the other
among the vegetation in the growing dusk. The next evening,
about the same time, he chanced to be in the same spot, and again
saw the third bird in the tree where he shot the others the even-
ing before. This one he secured, and it turned outto be a male ;
this was the only pair we ever came across. They cling to the
tree trunks, and run up them much in the same manner that a
Woodpecker does. The C. punctatus was fairly common about
the headwaters of the Napo, and I think we shot some at all the
places where we stopped to collect on that river. At one of the

Zaparo Indian villages somewhere in the forests, I had one given
to me alive. It was so exceedingly tame that I think it must
have been brought up by hand, and like most of the birds we got
from these Indians, had been in the habit of living constantly
on the women's shoulders. It certainly preferred to run about
our clothes, or to perch on our fingers, to any other position. It
seemed to hold on to one so much tighter than any other bird
except a Parrot, because it has two claws in front and two behind
like a Woodpecker. It was, perhaps, rather more fond of
climbing than hopping from perch to perch, and it did the latter
somewhat clumsily, and gave one the impression that the feet
were loth to relax their grip of the perch ; still it was a lively
uncommon-looking bird, and had a quaint habit, when perched
on my finger, of lowering its head, turning up its tail, and jerk-
ing its body quickly from side to side, accompanied by a bubbling
noise in the throat. Unfortunately, it was not in my possession
long, for it was eaten by the same dog which robbed me, about
that time, of one of my Tovi Parrakeets. Its favourite food was
the boiled fruit of the "chonta" palm--a mealy kind of carrot-
coloured fruit, tasting something like boiled chestnuts. It is a
food these particular Indians give to all birds and animals they
keep, and Parrots, when once used to it, seemed to prefer it to
all other food ; but it gives the bird or person who habitually
eats it a peculiar aroma which I consider anything but agreeable.
My punctahts would also eat banana, but not with the same
avidity as " chonta," and cockroaches and all insects it was mad
after.
On the Western side we met with several varieties of
Dacnis, the principal ones being the D. egregia, ccerebicolor , and
puicherrima. We found the first the commonest, and the last
the rarest. They are to be found in the clearings in the forests,
among the fruit trees about the huts, searching all day long for
insects ; and in the way they cling to the twigs and leaves,
remind one much of the Blue Tits. I have also seen them
taking small spiders from the thatch under the eaves of our hut.
They never seem still for an instant, but take little or no notice
of the presence of human beings. I once caught a ccerebicolor in
a butterfly net at Nanegal. We also found the beautiful Chloi-
ophanes atricapilla to be common in the same localities, especially
among banana plantations, and most of those we collected were
shot in the ripe bunches, in the company sometimes of large
birds.
One of the birds which took my fancy immensely was the
Black-faced Blue Chatterer (Procnias tersa). In certain localities

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999275744186047" page_id="32638107"  page_num="266" year="" vol="">
we found it to be quite common on both sides of the Andes,
chiefly at the foot of the mountains in the forest clearings, but
never in the forests themselves. The males looked remarkably
brilliant as they flashed past the hut in the sunlight. On the
Western side we often shot them on the bananas, and I also saw
them eating the young and tender shoots of bushes ; but on the
Napo side, several that we shot had been feeding on a hard green
fruit like a sloe. Although they have a very wide gape, it
seemed a large fruit for a bird of that size to swallow. The male
is about five inches long, and, if held facing the light, is a curious
shade of bright shining green ; but, if turned back to the light,
the whole plumage at once looks a lovely ccerulean blue. The
face is black, and so are the flight feathers, but edged with blue.
The vent and centre of the breast are pure white, and the flanks
are very finely barred with black. The bill, which is very short,
flat, and wide, is also black. The female is entirely of a rich
green, and 3^ellow where the male is white on the under parts.
As may be imagined, the female is much more seldom seen than
the male, as her plumage, assimilating with the foliage, affords
her more protection. The young take after the female ; and
some we procured, which have partially changed their plumage,
look very curious, mottled with the combination of male and
female colours. I should somehow imagine these birds would
not be at all difficult to keep in captivity ; neither should the
glorious Cotingas be, of which we also obtained specimens on the
Napo. The Cotinga maynana is realty about the same colour as
the Procnias tersa, but somehow looks still richer and more
beautiful, which is partially due to the scale-like plumage, and
also to the curious purple and white base all the feathers have.
No one who has heard the song of Turdiis ignobilis would
again think that tropical birds lacked the sweet voices of some
of our Northern ones. Even making allowance for the fact that
the majority of the birds from the lowlands of Ecuador have no
song worth mentioning, and therefore when we came across
a bird which did sing it was doubty appreciated, still I have
seldom heard anywhere a bird with richer or more ringing notes
than the Turdus ignobilis. We first met with them around
Popayan, in Colombia, but I never remember hearing them sing
there : probably it was not the time of the year for them to do
so. We did not see them again until we got down to the Napo,
where we found them very common at the Coca, in May and June
of last 3^ear. I have two skins before me now, both males, one
from Popayan, and the other from the Coca: and I find there is

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999377558139535" page_id="32638108"  page_num="267" year="" vol="">
quite a local difference between them. The Colombian bird is
larger and has more of an olive-brown shade over all the
plumage; the throat is less white than the Coca bird's, but it has
the lower part of the abdomen and under tail coverts of a much
purer white; the bill is also a little darker. I am sorry I have
not more of their skins with me at the moment, to see if these
differences are constant or not. I often noticed them feeding on
the same bushes with the Magpie Tanagers, and they usually
frequented the bushes and low trees in the most open parts of
the clearings. One of the first of the many sounds to wake us
in the early mornings at the Coca, and often before the weird
cries of the night-birds had ceased at the approach of dawn, was
the beautiful song of the ignobilis, which came from the tops of
many bushes about the small clearing, and continued until the
daj^ grew hot.
I had some four or five of the young ones brought to me
at different times, but I never could manage to rear one of them,
although some I fed on an exclusively insect diet (chiefly spiders
and small cockroaches) ; perhaps some of the insects did not
suit them, for they all seemed to get a distaste for their food, and
died. In such a country as we were then in, where nothing was
to be had, it was always difficult to rear young birds unless they
were exclusively fruit-eaters ; and I cannot congratulate myself
on my success with the many young birds of various kinds I
tried to bring up. I cannot be certain that I came across any of
the nests of the 7 . ignobilis myself, although I believe that some
of the old and new nests I found in the orange trees near the
hut must have belonged to them.
In my last article I mentioned the Xanthura turcosa, which
we found in the cold mountain regions. We also met with
another of the species, X. incas, in the warm valleys between the
mountains on the Eastern side. It is still more beautiful than
the turcosa , because its colours are more varied and assimilate so
well together, a peculiar softness blending them all. Its total
length is twelve inches, and the top of the head and neck are
creamy-white in one light and the palest of mauves in another,
which is shaded into pale blue on the back. The sides of the
head and throat are black, but there is a broad triangular patch
of Oxford blue on each side at the gape, and a small touch of the
same colour over the eyes. The feathers on the forehead, which
grow out in a forward direction, are of a slightly more violet-
blue shade, and cover half the length of the bill. The wings
are a soft green on the upper side and yellow underneath, and

<bodyText confidence="0.999135744186046" page_id="32638109"  page_num="268" year="" vol="">
the whole of the breast, underparts, and tail, are clear Canary-
yellow, except the two central tail feathers which are bluish-
green and longer than the rest. We saw these birds in flocks
below Baeza, and always in high trees, making such a loud
chattering noise that we heard them long before we came near
them, in fact it was the noise they made which always drew our
attention to them. I believe the Colombian bird does not vary
from the Ecuadorian one, and we often saw' them in the Cauca
valley.
An Englishman who had a mine there kept several of
them alive, which he had brought up by hand. They were
exceedingly tame, and had their liberty about the verandah and
garden. They were very amusing in their ways, and I often
watched them pick up small pebbles, scraps of paper, etc., and
hide them in holes in the walls, and behind the shutters. They
were not at all particular as to what they ate, and lived on scraps
from the table and what they found in the garden.
On the Napo we also shot some of the Violet-blue Jays
(Cyanocorax violaceus). These large birds are a beautiful violet-
blue all over, except the head and throat which are black, and
the nape which is so light as to be almost white. As you turn
the bird about in the light, the colours change to every degree of
richness. We saw r them always in pairs. I include them in this
article because when we reached Iquitos, on the Upper Amazon,
I saw a very fine specimen which had its liberty about a house
close to where we were living, and it often paid us visits.
Although its wing was not cut, it never flew away from the
place, and was always about the small garden or on the roof of
the house. It was very friendly and inquisitive, and I hoped I
should be able to pursuade its owner to let me have it before we
left, but I never succeeded in doing so, although the disagreeable
old woman who owned it did not seem to have any affection for
it. The female bird is not quite so bright in colour as the male,
especially on the breast, which looks greyer.
We found three varieties of Motmots common at the
Coca--the Broad-billed, the Red-headed, and the Blue-headed.
The last were perhaps the most numerous. I believe Motmots
have been kept alive in England, but, judging from their habits
in a wild state, I should think they have little beyond their
beauty to recommend them. They seem silent uninteresting
birds, and sit for hours on the same branch, only leaving it to
seize a passing beetle or other insect, returning again to the
same place. On the edge of the forest, I have seen them fly

down to the ground and catch a grasshopper without settling,
and fly back to the tree to eat it. We found the Broad-billed
variety on both sides of Ecuador, and, although personally we
only met with the Red-headed ones on the Eastern side, they
come also from the Pacific side.
Doves and Pigeons are not at all abundant in either
species or numbers in the hot parts of Ecuador, and are among
the birds least met with ; still at Santo Domingo we obtained
some of the exceedingly pretty little pale grey Peristera cincrea.
They were always in pairs, running about the paths near the
huts, and they had a slight peculiarity in their habits which I
have not noticed in other Doves. When alarmed, instead of
taking flight as most Doves do, they remained immoveable,
skulking as near to the ground as possible. At times, when they
must have seen my approach long before I got to them, and
had plenty of time to clear off, although I had not noticed them,
they startled me by dashing up almost from under my feet.
This was the only species of Dove we met with in the forest
regions, but about the same districts we found the remarkably
handsome Pigeon, (a) Geotrygon pitrpurcita, which was confined
to the tops of the high trees in the thickest part of the forests.
We only shot one male ourselves, but often heard their rather
curious note, resembling a loud hoot, but seldom could catch a
glimpse of them. A rubber hunter brought me a female in the
month of July, which had an egg inside ready to be laid, but
broken, so they must have been nesting then. They seemed to
be solitary in their habits, and were certainly not common in any
neighbourhood we were in. It is a small Pigeon, barely nine
inches in length, and has its colours of snowy white, richest
purple, mulberry, green and bronze, wonderfully arranged. The
long, loose, delicately-coloured fawn feathers on the thighs also
add to its appearance. It is one of the most difficult birds to
skin that I have met with : its skin having very little more
substance in it than wet tissue paper, and the feathers fall out
copiously even with the most delicate handling. It is quite as
bad in this respedt as some of the Trogous, which are usually
considered the most difficult birds to skin. The flesh of this
Pigeon is white to a remarkable degree, and resembles alabaster
in appearance. O11 the Napo side we found a still smaller Pigeon,
the ( a ) G. sapphirina , which exactly resembles the piirpitrata
in all respects, except the back of the head and neck which are
(a.) Osculatia purpurea, and O. sapphirina, according&amp;apos; to the Nat. Hist. Museum Catalogue.

grey and green, instead of rich purple, and the purple line from
the gape is also paler. In July we shot a very young one of these
Pigeons on the Suno, which has the head, back and wings, dark
reddish-brown, barred with black, and across the upper part of
the breast is a broad band of dark dull grey, barred with brown
and fawn, which band on the adult bird is of the palest grey.
A few feathers on the head and back are just moulting to the
adult plumage. These were the only two species of Pigeons
we met with in the forests of Ecuador.
And with this I must bring these notes to an end. I had
intended, if time permitted, to have extended them to two more
articles, but I expect, by the time this appears in print, to be
about ready to leave England once more for a sojourn in far off
lands, in quest of more birds ; and if I am spared to return in
safety, it will give me great pleasure, at some future date, to
write again of my success and experiences, in the pages of this
Magazine.
NOTE.
I am sure that I am expressing the feelings of the whole of the
Avicultural Society, when I tender on its behalf very hearty thanks to
Mr. Walter Goodfellow for the series of charming and instructive articles
which, through the past year, have been such a great gain to our Magazine.
We hope that his next wanderings may be as successful and as fruitful as
those in Ecuador, and that on his safe return he may not forget the pages
of the Avicultural Magazine. EDITOR.
THE BREEDING OF THE INDIGO BIRD.
Fringilla cyanea*
By the Rev. C. D. Farrar.
By the Creoles of Eouisiana this pretty little bird is known
as the Petit Pape-bleu. It is a migratory bird, and arrives in the
Southern States from the direction of Mexico, with the Painted
Finch or Nonpareil. They are taken in great numbers by
means of traps. It is not a forest bird ; but prefers the outskirts
of woods, the little detached thickets, along the fields, and
is seen frequently perched on a fence or on some conspicuous
bough, whence it utters its really pretty song. The female
skulks in the thick brushwood, where her sober coat renders her
still more inconspicuous.
The Indigo Finch is rather a short stumpy little figure of
a bird, and, though not as gorgeous as the Nonpareil, he has not

the latter's vile temper. Indeed, he will agree well with his
kind : a thing which the Nonpareil utterly refuses to do--his
motto seems to be, " One world for one Nonpareil," and he
certainly acts up to it.
I never could understand where the Indigo P&amp;apos;inch got his
name, as it is quite a misnomer. This cock is not indigo but
azure. The cock Indigo only assumes his gorgeous livery as
spring advances. During the autumn and winter months he is a
sober little gentleman in a drab suit with just a mere suspicion
of blue facings. The hen remains the same dowdy little thing
all the year round.
I have at present two adult pairs of Indigos in a large
aviary, which I call " The Wilderness." It is full of shrubs and
bushes, and long rank grass knee deep, interspersed with thorns
and nettles of gigantic proportions ; an ideal place from an
Indigo Finch's point of view.
In this aviary they have been now two years, but till
the present season they never made any attempt at nesting ;
although the Nonpareils gave them a lead last year.
One day in the late spring of this year, I saw Mrs.
Indigo carrying about some bents in her beak : a sure sign of
nesting operations about to begin. She was very ' tickle' about
a site, as we say up here ; and began on several, but finally
abandoned them for reasons best known to herself. At last,
however, she found a site to her liking at the very top of a tall
shrub. The nest was composed of the very slenderest materials,
and was no stronger than a White-throat's. It was not built on a
solid foundation, or some convenient fork ; but suspended by the
strands from the branches, like a small Oriole's nest. So light
and utterly flimsy was the whole affair that I was in despair. I
felt certain it could never stand any real work. Just as it was
finished and ready as I thought, I went to London for the inside
of a week, and on my return I found that an egg had been laid,
presumably that day. I looked the next morning for No. 2, but
it was not there, and I feared she would lay no more. However,
I waited in patience, and the next day there was a second egg,
and a third followed ; and then Mrs. Indigo settled down to her
duties.
Here let me make a strange note--the eggs were all with-
out any markings whatever, and a dirty whitish blue in colour.
Now, in all books I have read, it is said that the eggs of the Indigo

Finch are blue with a spot or two of purple at the larger end.
Did my hen lay abnormal eggs ? (Y)
Mr. Oates, one of our members, has seen the eggs, and if
the one clear egg survives, (c) I hope to send it to Dr. Butler to
look at.
I soon saw, when the hen began to sit, that like Humpt}^
Dumpty who sat on the wall, my poor little friend would, unless
I did something to avert the catastrophe, " have a great fall."
The mere weight of her body made the nest lean over in the
most ominous manner ; and I saw that if it were to survive,
artificial strengthening would have to be resorted to. Now there
may be readers who, when they read what follows, will cry in
derision, Credat Judseus! but as Bret Harte makes one of his
characters say somewhere, " My name is truthful Janies," at any
rate for this occasion. Seeing that the nest was giving way in
its supports--remember it was onty suspe?ided by thin strands of
grass from the branches--I determined that I would try a
Caesarian operation. Probably in America the Indigo Finch can
find tougher material for " suspensors " than I can find in
Yorkshire. I went indoors and found my wife's workbox. I
selected a needle of 'fair proportions' and with an eye that 1 a
camel might go through ' ; some stout black thread that would
hold a healthy Zebra ; and after spending some hours of patient
effort, I succeeded in threading it. Then I hurried off to the
aviary and to the aid of poor Mrs. Indigo. I found her bravely
sitting but in what I cannot but think must have been a painful
position, as her head was down and her tail was up, and I saw
that if things went on as they were doing, the precious eggs
must fall to the ground by the attraction of gravity. I looked at
the little hen and I said to myself, " I wonder if you will stand
what I am going to do. It is for your good and the welfare of
your coming family, therefore pardon me." I put out my finger
and she skipped off with her little crest erect and hopping on to
a neighbouring branch, anxiously awaited developments. I was
as quick and handy as a man could be with such a clumsy
weapon as a needle to handle and a long bit of thread.
I passed the threads through the nest to act as ' suspensors '
until like Johnny Gilpin, ' I made the balance true.' It took a
bit of time, but then I am not a good hand with needle and

he would see that on p. 58 I say of the egg&amp;apos;s : " they are mostly bluish-white, though some-
times they are sparingly spotted and blotched with rusty brown." -- A. G. B.

thread. I had grave doubts as to whether my well-intentione
efforts would succeed, but it was kill or cure. I felt like Baden
Powell, it was a question :
If we go forward, we die.
If we go backward we die.
Better go forward and die.
My readers can supply the parallel.
To my surprise my little friend seemed to understand that
I was only lending a helping hand ; and when I came back a
quarter of an hour later, she was sitting on the eggs as if naught
had happened. To show my perfedt veracity I will send the
nest and suspenders of thread to some member of our Society to
see (d).
At the end of twelve days I found two of the eggs hatched
and one clear egg. I was pleased over my luck, as I felt sure
from past experience that I could rear them.
Everything went happy as a marriage bell, for a week,
and the youngsters grew as one could wish. The next day was
Sunday, a day of peace and goodwill. In the country Sunday is
a day of terrors to people who have aviaries ; for the common
necessary boy is on the prowl. I went to Evensong at 6 o'clock,
and I forgot to lock the padlock on the Wilderness. When we
came out of Church I went across to the aviaries to feed up for
the last time. As I crossed the field I saw three boys up a tree
aftera nest. I shouted to them fiercely and they fled incontinently,
but not before I had recognized them. It was a rare thing I did
look, as the sequel will shew. On reaching the aviaries I
found to my horror that the padlocks had been stolen, and on
looking inside I could see that someone had been inside. I said
to my wife, " It is those boys and I will be bound those young
Indigos are gone." I entered with a dreadful feeling of sickness
and crept miserably towards the Indigo's nest. To my joy it
was there all right and the youngsters in it. How that nest
escaped will always be to me a miracle. I could have screamed
for joy. Then my thoughts turned to sweet revenge. I went
to one of the boys and I said : "If you do not give me the
padlocks you have stolen you will accompany me to the police-
man." He protested with ashy face that he had never been near
my garden and had never seen my padlocks. Unfortunately for
himself, he had a few moments before offered to exchange them
with another boy for value received. I taxed him boldly with
(d). They were seen and handled b3&amp;apos; Messrs. Creighton and Watson.--C. I). F.

defledtion from the path of Truth. He vowed he only had one
padlock (a red one, of all colours) which his father had given
him. I again hinted at the man in blue. He reconsidered the
matter; he knew who had got the padlocks. Would I let him
go and fetch them. He even named the boy. I consented. In
about a quarter of an hour he returned with my padlocks. The
next morning, it being Sunday, I went to see Papa No. i. I
told him the story and gave him the alternative of (i) giving
the boys a sound thrashing or (2) going to the neighbouring Police
Court. He elected the former, and opined in a tragic voice that
his lads would not come into my garden again. The tone was
horribly suggestive and I felt for those boys, but then I thought
also of poor Mrs. Indigo and her family, and the cheek of the
whole thing. That same evening a knock came at the door,
and when I went out to see, there stood paterfamilias and the
two culprits, greeting right sore, and as I opined also right sore
(forgive the pun) as to their lumber region. Papa had a good ash
plant in his.hand, as though to give me ocular proof that justice
had been done. " There," he said, "Sir, I hav gien them a reet
good thrashing, and they won't trouble you no more. Now,
then," to the culprits, '&amp;apos;beg Mr. Farrar's pardon." I really felt
a little sorry for the poor lads, and I freely forgave them ; I
should have liked to have given them sixpence, but then that
would have been to encourage vice.
These Indigo birds are now locked up throughout the day
and woe betide anyone who comes to molest them. I never so
nearly lost a medal as I did that Sunday evening. The other
and worst culprit, I have reason to believe, was executed on the
same evening, but at a later hour, when his sire returned from
hay-making, and I believe the weapon of execution was
identical. Let this plain unvarnished tale in which I have
nought extenuated, nought set down to malice, warn all my
fellow aviculturists to lock up their aviaries, even on Sundays--
When wicked little boys delight
To pull poor birds' nests out.
I say it with no egotistical spirit, that I consider these
birds that rear their young exclusively on animal food far the
most difficult to breed. Indigos are no exception. They
absolutely refuse to feed on anything but " live bait." Hence I
think a gold medal should be given for rearing them ; or better
still "unlimited mealworms" (&amp;lt;?).
( e ). I am not at all sure that this species has not been bred previously in England :
it has been repeatedly in GPrmauy.--A. G. B.

The hen, as in many savage races, has nearly all the work
to do ; she labours early and late. The cock sits perched on
some lofty twig and warbles approval, or finds fault like so many
human fathers do when things go wrong. When the young are
getting to an interesting stage, he takes a little more notice of
them, and goes so far as to give them an occasional meal. Some
human fathers are like that. They can't stand a flabby baby ;
but they like the chicks when they begin to take a bit of notice!
Papa Indigo is the same. He first becomes fully conscious of
his duties when his youngsters are beginning to cover their
nakedness and to look a bit decent.
At first the young are very dark in colour, like young
Bullfinches, but naked as Robins, as we say up here ; but why is
a Robin naked ? When the quills begin to show, they look very
much like a man that wants shaving badly. My children some-
times say to me: "Father, you are blue to-night!" The coat
of the young Indigos is a sober brown and the old birds feed
them for a long time after they leave the nest. In the same
aviaty was a pair of Nonpareils, and they, too, reared a nest at
the same time as the Indigos. Mrs. Nonpareil was always
master of the situation and always had first go at the food. If
Mrs. Indigo ventured to try to get first served, she was soon sent
off with a flea in her ear. It was amusing to see Mrs. Nonpareil
helping herself, and when her beak was full, off she would fly
and then poor little Mrs. Indigo made the best use of her time,
and off she would pop to her nest, and so the work went on
early and late. I must say that I have never had a more interest-
ing and yet more anxious experience than I have had in
breeding the Indigo finch, and I am thankful to be able to say,
with Shakspeare, " All's well that ends well."
The young are little brown birds.

MY FIRST VISIT TO A LONDON BIRD SHOP.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99065775" page_id="32638116"  page_num="275" year="" vol="">
By The Rev. C. D. Farrar.
I know of few more trying ordeals than a first visit to a
Rondon Bird Shop, there to confront the more or less self-
assertive and cultured person who presides over that establish-
ment, and whose knowledge of all bird matters will probably far
exceed your own ; at any rate in his own estimation. In this
interview I determined on a golden mean of conduct, lying
between undue assertiveness on the one hand, and unmanly

abasement 011 the other. I would enter the shop quietly and
naturally, and not allow myself to be astounded by anything I
saw or heard. I would show familiarity with all the different
birds, and would boldly select what I had come for. This
seemed, the night before, easy and plain enough. After a long
and tiring walk through burning streets I at last got down East,
and after a deal of asking found the street I was in quest of.
Entering the establishment I had been in search of, I was
effusively greeted by the owner with a "Well, Sir, what can I do
for you?" The night before I had felt bold enough for anything;
now I felt all my courage oozing out of the soles of my shoes,
and old lialf-forgotten memories of the spider and the fly come
rushing to my mind. I managed to stammer lamely, " I want a
bird." This seemed to the owner such an obvious truism in a
bird shop that he vouchsafed no answer.
" I want a good bird," I tried this time. Mark the word
"good." Properly understood, it ought to have suggested to the
man that I was a knowing old hand, and knew all about birds,
and owned probably thousands, and just out of pure cussed ness
wanted to add another to my collection. But it was not so
understood. The man of the shop seemed occupied in some
abstract calculations, and answered quite shortly: "We never
keep bad birds in this place."
" Well," I said, " will you show me some Firefiuches."
He went to a distant part of the shop, dashed into a long, dark-
looking cage, crowded with terrified little captives which he
denominated " Seuegals," and after a good bit of scrambling
produced three or four of the desired species. " There yer are,"
he said, " 'ow many." He said, "'ow many" in such a tone as
to suppose that he would be mentally offended if I said less than
fifty. I said rather tamely : " Well, I only wanted about one or
two." "All right," said he, "take 'em or leave 'em." I took
the cage in my hand, held it up to the light, and opened one eye
and shut the other, as though I proposed to go shooting. Mean-
while the man maintained a stony silence. Indeed, he appeared
not to take the slightest interest in me or my purchases. Even
curses would have been welcome. I grew frightened and
flustered; I opened the cage to get a nearer peep, and lo!
"peep," away shot a Firefinch up to the ceiling. Still that man
said nothing; at least nothing audible. He just got a net, and
after about lialf-an-hour's chasing, managed to get that Fire-
finch ; more dead than alive. " Don't 3^011 think it would be

well," I said, "to have your cage made more secure." He said
something under his breath about "silly idiots" coming in
taking up people's time ; and audibly, that if I would let him
know when next I proposed to honour his shop with a visit, he
would try to devote a whole day to me.
"I will take these two," I said, rather haughtily, as if I
was conferring a high favour. He seemed to take it quite as a
matter of course. "All right," he said, "what next." "Any

reasonable ; #3 each, taking the lot. I bought all that came."
I said : " Oh ! indeed ! " as if fifty Sugar birds, more or less, was
nothing to me. " Would you halve them ?" The man lightened
considerably. Yes ; he would to oblige me. I said I would

sleep on it.
Then I decided to be open with him. I told him how I
knew literally nothing about birds. He positively beamed on me.
We went into all sorts of abstruse subjects, foods, mealworms,
cages, sex of Parrots, till my head fairly reeled. I came in to
buy a humble Firefinch. Now I was in, it was quite wonderful
how many things I wanted. " Do you know what this is?" he
said, taking me by the lappet of my coat. I confessed 1113^ crass
ignorance. " That is a Poe bird from New Zealand." " Is it very
expensive?" I faltered. "Oh, not very ; you shall have it for
#/\ ios., though it is worth more." I thanked him with tears,
but said my purse would not run to it.
We parted excellent friends ; before I left the shop he was
almost affectionate. For my part I paid a few judicious com-
pliments about the immensity of his knowledge and the ignorance
of all other dealers. This seemed to please him mightily ; and
when I last saw him, he was still beaming upon me.
When I got home I opened the cage and showed my
purchases. Somehow they did not look quite so fresh and gay
as in the shop. My family were not encouraging. They said
they never knew anyone so easily taken in. "What did I want
more birds for?" What could I say? I went out and slammed
the door.

Born in Menagerie. Great Aviary.
This time of year is about the worst in which to see birds
in anything approaching good trim : they are for the most part in
moult, and those that have not moulted are in very worn and
dirty looking plumage, while even those for whom the annual
event is now past lack the characteristic brilliancy and ' go '
which was everywhere visible a few months back. I was,

therefore, agreeably surprised on my visit this mouth to find
that the birds as a whole were looking remarkably well, the
summer heat having evidently restored to health and spirits the
brightly coloured inhabitants of sunny climes.
The arrivals in the Western Aviary this month are com-
paratively few, consisting chiefly of Doves, about which, I regret
to say, I am very ignorant, and several Weaver Birds; these last
are well worth seeing at the present time, many of them being
clothed in the most gorgeous tints.
The Crows seem to hang in the moult more than most
birds, and the attractions in their cages at the present time are
not great, if we except a beautiful Piping Crow, who was piping
away for all he was worth. The Gulls' Pond is also not very
attractive just now, most of the birds looking very sulky and
mopish.
Wandering by the Goose Paddocks, I noticed two speci-
mens of the Black and White Goose (Anseranas semipalmata)
to which I think I drew attention some months back. They are
very queer looking birds, more resembling an Oyster Catcher
than a Goose, being very long in the leg, which is only partially
webbed, and having a curiously shaped head which slants
upwards and backwards, almost following the slope of the bill.
The Pheasants, of which the Gardens have acquired
several this month, were not visible, nor was it much loss as
apart from their beauty they are about the most uninteresting
birds it is possible to confine, aud are practically untameable {#).
The Little Bittern and another small heron, not yet re-
corded, looked rather miserable in the Fish House in a cage full
of Waders, a Puffin, Terns, etc. The Waders looked very well,
and seemed to thrive in spite of their foreign companions.
I visited the Northern Aviary where Owls and Hawks
exist; there are some nice birds there but in such bad trim as
not to be worth a visit.
The only remaining house is the Parrot House, where the
moult was greatly to the fore ; the Westerman's Fclecti which
arrived last winter seem to have gone among several others, and
nothing of great rarity has arrived. The Grassfinches, Toucans,
Touracous, etc. which inhabit that house were looking well, and
seem to thrive where the rightful inmates perish.
(g) I regret to differ from my g-ood colleague; but lest any one should be prejudiced
against Pheasants by his opinion, I cannot help recording the fact that almost all my
home-bred foreign Pheasants eat from my hand. -- O. 1$. C.

1899-1900.
The membership during the past j^ear has remained
practically stable, although there is a slight increase--thirty-five
new members have been elected, and the number now on the roll
is 270.
The }^ear was started with a deficit of ^12, which, it was
hoped, might have been wiped off by voluntary subscription ;
this, however, has not been quite possible, and there still remains
a deficit from last year of #\. The Council desire to tender
their best thanks to those who have so kindly helped to wipe off
this debt, and if there are any more who would like to help, they
are reminded that it is not too late to do so.
During the present year the Magazine has been somewhat
enlarged, with the result that we have, unfortunate^, again
exceeded our income. After most careful consideration, we have
decided that, in order to prevent a further recurrence of deficit,
the annual subscription must be raised to 10/- This we have
been compelled to do, as even were the size of the Magazine
diminished, there would still be a deficit on the coloured plates,
the originals of which were this year kindly presented to the
Society. We might point out to members that when the
subscription was raised before, in order that coloured plates
might be supplied to all members, it was shewn (Avicultural
Magaiine, vol. IV., p. 201) that the extra 2/6 would not fully
cover expenses, and that a large increase in membership was
expected, which expectation has not been realized.
Two medals have been issued during the year : to Mr. R.
Phirripps, for breeding the Black Lark ; and to the Rev. C. D.
Farrar, for breeding the Nonpareil. Mr. Firrmer has been
strongly advocating the inclusion of Quadrupeds, Canaries, etc.,
in the scope of the Magazine ; but, as we believe this to be
greatly against the general wish of the members, his suggestion
has not been followed. Miss Hadow kindly presented to the
Society the first three volumes of the Magazine, which have been
sold.
Many thanks are due to all those members who have
kindly contributed articles or letters to the Magazine, and we
hope that during the ensuing year many others may be stimu-
lated by their good example and strive to emulate them.

Our thanks are also due to all those who have so kindly -
presented original coloured plates for publication, without which
we should not have been able to issue any plates at all.
Finally, we would tender our best thanks to all the officers
of the Society and Executive Committee, who have devoted so
much time and attention to conducting the affairs of the Society,
in a way which has, we trust, been satisfactory to the members.

AVICULTURE AND "THE FANCY."
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.979920481481482" page_id="32638123"  page_num="282" year="" vol="">
Sir, --My friend Mr. Fillmer calls upon me to prove my words, in
that I say :--" Now lie would persuade us that aviculture and ' the fancy '
are one and the same thing," and he hints that in making such a statement
I am misrepresenting facts.
If I had been able to discover any other explanation of Mr. Fillmer's
observations, I should have refrained from making the above statement;
but I always imagined that Mr. Fillmer understood the meaning of the
term ' fancy ' ; therefore I could discover no side path by which he might
escape from the interpretation which must be given to his remarks on
p. 234 of the Magazine. He says: --
"Mr. Seth-Smith ignores the existence of a powerful ' fancy ' element
in connection with foreign and British birds, especially the latter. This
element has never been any trouble to the Society, and there is no reason
why the Canary 'fancy' should be more difficult to deal with. My per-
sonal experience is that Canary ' fanciers ' are neither better nor worse than
'fanciers' of British and foreign birds."
Furthermore, Mr. Fillmer hints that to ignore fancy breeds of the
Canary is unscientific, implying that by so doing we are ignoring a species :
he might as well tell a dressmaker that she showed ignorance because she
did not waste her time over fancy work.
The study of living species of birds is a well-defined branch of
Ornithology, and is necessary to a thorough knowledge of birds : if carried
out with a view to the acquisition of knowledge, it is as much (perhaps
more so) a branch of Natural Science, as the stud} 7 of cabinet birdskius :
it certainly teaches more facts about the birds themselves : this study has
been called ' Aviculture' and should in no wise be confounded with what is
known as ' the fancy.'

'The fancy' is not bird culture, but the culture of bird-abortious: it
does not deal with species at all, but only 7 with the variations from species,
which mail's fancy 7 has selected. The fancier is no more an aviculturist
than the florist is a practical botanist: he deals not with birds , but terato-
logical sports.
There is no fancy 7 about foreign and British birds; it is all hard fact.
If you put up a pair of birds for breeding, you don't worry about whether
one is sib-bred and another crest-bred ; you know without telling what you
are likely to breed, because you are dealing with birds, not fancies: there-
fore to talk about the foreign ' fancy ' is to talk of what does not exist.
A. G. Butter.
[This controversy is now closed. I have been glad to be able to insert
every letter forwarded for publication on Mr. Fillmer's proposed extension
of the scope of the Society. The course which the Council have thought
well to take is announced in the " Report."-- Editor].

PARROT PICKING ITSELF.

Sir, --A lady living in this neighbourhood called recently 7 and asked
me to see a Double-Fronted Amazon Parrot that she has had three months.
When first sent to her she thought it might be infested with insects, as it
kept pecking its body. Keating's Powder was rubbed in but did not seem
to do any good. She then put the bird in a warm bath, and well washed it
with Sunlight Soap. The bird is immersed while the washing takes place,
and only the head appears above water. The bird likes being bathed in
this manner, and is in Show condition. As I have never heard of a Parrot
being so tubbed, if you know it is something out of the common, would it
be worth chronicling ? W. T, CaTreugh.
P.S.--Since the bird has been washed in the above manner it has
ceased to peck itself.

"REARING YOUNG BULLFINCHES."

<bodyText confidence="0.9997615" page_id="32638124"  page_num="283" year="" vol="">
Sir, --Some weeks ago, in reply to a letter from Mr. Hett asking for
information as to the rearing of some young Bullfinches which were just
due to hatch in his aviary, I suggested eggs, ant's eggs, live ants, green
food and berries, especially privet if practicable. I herewith enclose Mr.
Hett's answer relating his success, as you may consider it of sufficient
import to publish. J. L. Bonhote.
Sir,--I have delayed thanking you for your letter of the 8th instant,
until I should have something to report.
On Friday the ioth inst. two young Bullfinches were hatched. I was
not at all prepared for them, but followed your directions as far as
practicable. I tried ant's eggs from an ant hill, but the other birds paid
much more attention to them than did the Bullfinches. Egg they&amp;apos; did not
seem to touch. An abundance of grouudsell and sow-thistle tops were the
luxury of which they showed the greatest appreciation. Raspberries and
currants (particularly the former) were also eaten. On the ninth morning
one of the birds left the nest. The other which had always been the weaker
was dead. The brancher is now, on its twentieth day 7 , nearly as large as
the parent birds although it is still fed by 7 them. Had I been able to clear

the aviary and leave the Bullfinches in sole possession, I might have had
still greater success. The active hen Chaffinches were generally to the fore
when any misguided insects wandered into the aviary.
Thanking you for your letter and the information contained therein.
Chas. Louis Hew.

TASMANIAN AND SOUTH AUSTRALIAN PARRAKEETS
FOR IMPORTATION.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997815222222222" page_id="32638125"  page_num="284" year="" vol="">
Sir, --Could you tell me where I could obtain information as to the
Tasmanian and S. Australian Parrots, Parrakeets and small birds. I have
been able to import some privately, but am rather at a loss to know what
would be most suitable and best worth sending over. I should be much
obliged if you could give me some information on the subject.
M. A. Johnstons.
The following answer has been sent to Mrs. Johnstone.
There is no book limited to the aviculture of Australian and
Tasmanian birds.
If you can read German you will find Dr. Carl Russ' " Handbuck fur
Vogelliebhaber," the most useful for your purpose : if not, I am afraid ymu
will have to fall back upon my " Foreign Bird-Keeping," in two parts (part
II. not y^et completed) published by the Feathered World : these are the
only two up-to-date works I know of which deal with general aviculture.
If you could import the Painted Finch [Emblema picta), the Australian
Fire-tailed Finch (Zonceginthus bellies), and two or three of the common
species of Pardalotes, these would be prized as much as any of the small
birds of Australia. A. G. BUTTER.

AURITA DOVES AND BRONZE-WINGED PIGEONS.

Sir, --At last my Aurita-doves are sitting steadily, in one of Abrahams'
shallow nests, rammed into a sponge-basket and hung up in one. corner of
the aviary (g).
I found a Bronze-winged Pigeon's egg, only bruised, on the ground;
so I stuck a bit of stamp-paper over the indented part and have put it
under a White Barbary. Will it hatch ? (h) A. G. BuTTER.
(g) Since the above was written, they have deserted their eggs, the nest being
apparently too much for them.--A.G.B.
My Aurita Doves now breed as freely as Barbary Turtles ; they require much space ;
without it they devote all their energies to fighting.--O.E.C.
( h ) I have often known Pigeons' eggs thus treated to hatch.--O.E.C.
