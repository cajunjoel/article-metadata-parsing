REPORT OF THE COUNCIL.

For I9I2-I3.
The past year has brought about important cbauges in the
Executive caused by the retirement of Mr. J. Lewis Bonhote
from the joint office of Treasurer and Editor. The Editorship
has been kindly undertaken by Mr. H. D. Astley and the
Treasurership by Mr. B. Thomasset.
The Council wishes to take this opportunity of recording
its appreciative recognition of Mr. Bonhote's services to the
Society. He has always taken an active interest in its welfare ;
and his tenure of the two posts above-mentioned was marked by
an improvement in the financial status of the Society and in the
quality of its Magazine. He also acted as editor of the volume
on " Practical Bird Keeping " published this year by the
Society.
The Council is also desirous of expressing its indebtedness
to Mr. P. W. Farmborough, chartered accountant, who, in the
capacity of Auditor to the Society, entered thoroughly into the
business relations of the Society with its publishers and made
several useful and practical suggestions concerning the
administration of the Society on a more secure footing, legal
and financial.
It will be evident to all members of the Society that the
zeal and energy displayed by Mr. Astley as Editor has improved,
and added interest to, the Magazine. This, with other factors,
has led to a marked increase in the number of members and has
placed the Society in a more flourishing position than it has ever
previously occupied.

RULES.
The Medal may be awarded at the discretion of the Committee, to
any Member who shall succeed in breeding,in the United Kingdom, any
species of bird which shall not be known to have been previously bred in
captivity in Great Britain or Ireland. Any Menber wishing to obtain the
Medal must send a detailed account for publication in the Magazine within
about eight weeks from the date of hatching of the young and furnish such
evidence of the facts as the Executive Committee may require. The Medal
will be awarded only in cases where the young shall live to be old enough
to feed themselves, and to be wholly independent of their parents.
The account of the breeding must be reasonably full so as to afford
instruction to our Members, and should describe the plumage of the young
and be of -value as a permanent lecord of the nesting and general habits of the
species. These points will have great weight when the question of awarding
the Medal is under consideration.
The parents of the young must be the bona fide property of the
breeder. An evasion of this rule, in any form whatever, will not only dis-
qualify the breeder from any claim to a Medal in that particular instance,
but will seriously prejudice any other claims he or she may subsequently
advance for the breeding of the same or any other species.
In every case the decision of the Committee shall be final.
&apos;l&apos;he Medal will be forwarded to each Member as soon after it shall
have been awarded as possible.
The Medal is struck in bronze (but the Committee reserve the right
to issue it in silver in very special cases), and measures -2.\ inches in
diameter. It bears on the obverse a representation of two birds with a nest
containing eggs, and the words " The Avicultural Society--founded 1894."
On the reverse is the following inscription : "Awarded to {-name of recipient)
for rearing the young of [name of species), a species not previously bred in
captivity in the United Kingdom."

THE RING-NECKED TEAL.
Nettium torquatum.

If the Teal are the most beautiful of the clucks, the Bing-
necked Teal may I think he said to be the most beautiful of all
the Teal, at any rate it is surpassed in beauty by none of the many
species that have been imported alive.
The first living specimen I ever saw was a male in Herr
Blaauw's collection in Holland about three years ago, and I was
immensely struck with its beauty. More recently I leave seen
single specimens, all males, in the Zoological Gai^lens of Berlin
and Cologne. 1 was told that some few years ago some half dozen
specimens, all males, were imported into Germany. It appears,
however, that at least one female reached that country, for last
year a few pairs were offered for sale, all of which, I ascertained,
had been bred in Germany. This year others have been offered
from the same source I imagine.
I had the good fortune to be able to secure a pair of these
little Teal on behalf of the Zoological Society last year, and then
for the first time saw the female, a very beautiful little duck, though
without the brilliant colouring of her mate. The pair have not bred,
which is perhaps not surprising their first year, as ducks generally
like some little time to settle down before making any serious
attempts at nesting.
The Bing-necked Teal inhabits Paraquay and Argentina,
but appears to be a very local species, nowhere very abundant.

Mr. W. E. Teschemaker.
Mr. Hudson gives the following note on the species :--" In the
neighbourhood of Buenos Ayres the Ring-necked Teal is strictly
migratory, and in the month of October appears in small flocks
in the marshes along the river ; but in the interior of the country
it is seldom met with. They are extremely active birds, constantly
flying about from place to place both by day and night ; and in
the love-season, when they alight in a pool of water, the males
immediately engage in a spirited combat. While flying they utter
a peculiar jarring sound, and occasionally a quacking note, rapidly
repeated and sounding like a strange laugh; but on the water,
especially in the evening, the male emits a long inflected note,
plaintive and exquisitely pure in sound -- a more melodious note
it would be difficult to find even among the songsters."
Although the sexes of this duck are so very distinct, the
drake has no eclipse plumage, or at any rate our example has failed
to don one. As is well known the drakes of the Northern Hemi-
sphere ducks, in all cases in which the sexes differ in plumage,
change their dress, to one superficially resembling that of the female,
for a short time after the breeding season. In most of the Southern
Hemisphere ducks however, this change does not take place, and
we find species such as the Rosy-bill, the Brazilian Teal, and the
Ringed Teal, possessing no vestige of change.

NESTING OF THE WHINCHAT.

The Whinchat is one of those interesting species which do
not readily yield their secrets to the student. One reason for this is
that we only know rather more than a quarter of their lives -- that
quarter which they spend in their breeding area. Why do people
continue to write books about British Birds, as seen in Britain, but
never make the least attempt to give us a book devoted to British
Birds, as seen abroad ? We may paraphrase a well-known line and
ask what do they know of British Birds who only Britain know ?
How fascinating an account of our summer migrants studied in
their winter haunts would be !

During the past few years I have bred and carefully observed
both the Stonechat and the Whinchat, and yet I cannot persuade
myself that I have made any considerable advance towards under-
standing&apos; the many problems which are interwoven with the life-
history of either species. If there be any of our members who
think that they know all that they need know about our indigenous
species let me ask them one or two questions. Why do all Whin-
chats migrate while the majority of Stonechats remain more or less
stationary throughout the year ? If the Stonechat can maintain
itself here during the winter, why cannot the Whinchat ? If the
Stonechat is the hardier bird, as one may reasonably infer from its
frequently wintering here and from the fact that it crosses the
North Sea in March, why does the Whinchat nest so much further
north ? Or again, if the former is the hardier bird, why do we find
it nesting in such an extremely hot climate as the south of Spain
and N. Africa, where the Whinchat is only seen as a migrant ? If
the Whinchat is the more delicate of the two, why is it found in
greater numbers in the Eastern Counties, whilst the Stonechat is
much more numerous in the (warmer) Western Counties ? Why
does the Whinchat nest at high elevations in the southern part of
its range and the Stonechat on the plains, whilst in the northern
part of their range these situations are more or less reversed ?
Although it might be possible to somewhat elucidate some of
these questions we will not further discuss them, but turn at once to
the subject of my present notes. The Whinchat nests, according to
Howard Saunders, in many parts of Central and Northern Europe
as far north as 70* N. lat., in Scandinavia, and as far east as the
Ural Mountains, but in S. Europe is chiefly seen as a migrant.
After the nesting season, we see individuals and small family parties
hurrying south in this country, and we are told that the western
contingent of this species winters in Africa, as far south as Fantee
on the west side and Abyssinia on the east. Then the curtain is
rung down and our little Whinchat passes into the unknown.
Through the very kind assistance, however, of our member,
Dr. E. Hopkinson, I am able to lift just for a single instant a very
small corner of the curtain so that we can obtain one momentary
glance at our Whinchat in its winter quarters. Dr. Hopkinson has

Mr. W. E. Teschemaker,
been contributing for some time past to our contemporary, Bird
Notes, an extremely interesting series of notes on the Birds of
Gambia, and amongst these notes (Vol. VIII. p. 294) may be found
the following reference:-- 11 Whinchats are common in Gambia from
about November to March. They are found in pairs or singly in the
old corn-fields and other open spaces; as active restless little birds
here as they are at home, flitting from bush to bush or perching on
the tall stalks which remain standing here and there about the
fields.'' Hearing&apos; that Dr. Hopkinson was home on leave, I ven-
tured to bombard him with various queries on this subject, which
with great good nature he endeavoured to answer, as follows:--
" I have occasionally seen an odd one or two as late as May, but I
am pretty sure they do not breed there. Most of those one
sees are in young plumage, more sandy than the adults. I have
never noticed specially on what they fed, but in West Africa there is
generally every possible variety of insect-food. By corn-fields '
please understand 1 Guinea-corn ' after the harvest--a very different
thing to our corn-fields : dry sandy tracts covered with long dry
stalks of the Guinea-corn (a millet) from which the heads have been
cut. Last year, when I stayed till the rains, the first time that I
saw Whinchats was in the early part of November ; I remember
seeing one or two before the arrival of the Wagtails and making a
note of it." I particularly enquired whether any males had been
heard to sing but evidently Dr. Hopkinson does not share my view
that all our migrants probably sing in their winter areas for he
adds: "I have never heal'd a Whinchat sing in the Gambia; a few
calls, nothing more. I really cannot believe that Nightingales at all
events do sing abroad. Their song must have been noticed by
someone, if they did."
Here then we have a peep at the Whinchat flitting from stem
to stem of the Guinea-corn and we may note that it does not reach
the Gambia until November though it crosses the Straits of
Gibraltar in September (Irby), thus showing us how leisurely a
journey the autumnal migration of this (and many other) species is.
Howard Saunders' statement that it leaves us in October is surely an
error. Though I am too far west to see it frequently as a migrant,
on those occasions which I have noted it has always been much

earlier. For instance, in the last week of August last year I saw an
adult female and a young male pitch on the Shaldon Embankment
(near my house) and, after spending an hour in resting and feeding,
" lift " again, presumably to essay the adventurous feat of crossing
the Channel at its point of greatest width. We have no evidence
that the Whinchat sings at Christmas ; nevertheless I can testify to
the fact that the Blackcap, Chiffchaff and Willow-wren do so and we
know that young male Nightingales are trained vocalists when they
return to us in the spring, also that they are in full song when they
reach the Italian shores. I want someone, therefore, to explain to
me where they acquire that wonderful song unless it be in
Africa.
When, a couple of years since, I succeeded in breeding the
Stonechat (for an account of which see Bird Notes Yol. IX.), it
seemed a reasonable inference that something might be done with
the Whinchat. However, it does not do to jump to conclusions in
any matter connected with birds and several years' study of this
species convinced me that it was not going to be so easy a task.
Whilst the Whinchat is sunning itself in Gambia, the Stonechat
may be seen apparently enjoying life amidst the bleak and weather-
beaten " tors " of Dartmoor, fifteen hundred feet above sea-level.
The Stonechat may be easily kept in captivity even by a beginner
(an exhibitor who begged for one of my young Stonechats moulted it
several times in a cage without the least difficulty), but anyone who
can carry a Whinchat through a winter and through a spring moult
in high condition may justly consider himself an expert--in fact
there are many self-styled " experts " who could not perform such a
feat. There w r as also the question of rearing the young. Miss
Turner assured me that she saw a male Stonechat break up a lizard
and give it to its young piecemeal and my Stonechats fed their young
partly on grass-seeds but it seemed very unlikely, considering the
delicate digestion of adult Whinchats, that the young of the latter
would prosper on any similar diet. Still another consideration was
that, whereas I had been able to trap hen Stonechats myself, I
should have to depend on others for a supply of Whinchats ; so much
depends upon the treatment the hens of insectivorous species receive
during the first few days of captivity.

Mr. W. E. Teschemaker.
The first two hen Whinchats I received this spring had been
" meated off " on one of those dreadful compounds sometimes most
quaintly termed "insectivorous (?) mixtures," so I opened the window
and let them fly. I then obtained four more which were forwarded
immediately after capture and reached me in good order. After a
couple of days' close observation I was able to pick out a breeding&apos;
hen with tolerable certainty ; I also retained another, nearly as
promising, as a second string and released the others. With the
majority of the monogamous species the association of two females
with one male would mean failure, but there are exceptions and
previous experience led me to think that this species would prove one
of the latter. Changing&apos; the scenery in a small aviary is never a very
difficult matter and I converted the 16ft. by 16ft. space in which the
Sprossers bred in 1911 from a Bamboo-swamp into a Common in
next to no time with a load of gorse and three large sacks full of turf
and heather from Dartmoor. The cemented basin was emptied, the
swamp allowed to dry and, Hey Presto, the thing was done. The
gorse proved to be a superfluous bit of scenery for the Whinchats
*carefully avoided it; moreover so did the Stonechats, when they
nested, and, when I add that one of the latter when trapped on
Dartmoor had a very sore foot, I expect our members will agree
with me that the one and only reason why both these species perch
on gorse in a state of freedom is probably that in their own
particular localities they have nothing much else to perch on.
On the 5th May, just as the long&apos;spring drought was breaking
up, I turned out the Whinchats with three Finch-larks and the former
seemed much pleased with their surroundings ; they revelled in the
spring showers, inspected the Common and perched on the broken
heads of some of the bamboos exactly as one might imagine they had
recently perched on the swaying stalks of the Guinea-corn in the
Gambia. The Finch-larks on the other hand led a somewhat
chequered existence and my impression is that they did not enjoy the
past summer at all. I tried to explain to them that everyone cannot
expect to be happy in this world of contrasts and that the same Fate,
which had made tire Whinchats King&apos;s and Queens, had made them
the Pawns in the game--but they did not seem convinced. Upon
this peaceful scene there descended, on the night of the 14th May,

my deadly enemies, the Tawny Owls ; they snipped off one leg of the
male Whinchat, cut a wad of skin and feathers out of the back of a
hen Wheatear, killed outright my only two hen Snowfinches and
then retired, with their usual discretion, before I could avenge my
dead. O happy London aviarist ! if you only knew what it is to be
raided by Hawks and Owls and Magpies and Stoats and Weasels
and Moles and Fieldmice you would indeed call yourself thrice
blessed ! I nursed the poor victim and in due course released him ;
for a week or more he pottered about the garden, apparently little
the worse for the amputation, and then he drifted away to fresh
fields and pastures new.
I obtained another male Whinchat and we made a fresh
start. This male was in fine adult plumage and soon began to sing
and to flirt with the most brightly coloured female. With drooped
and quivering wings, tail expanded and somewhat raised, and head
thrown backwards he would pose before and sing to the female,
showing off' his handsome tan waistcoat and the contrasted areas of
pure white on the wings and tail to perfection. I never realised
before what an extremely handsome little bird a male Whinchat is.
On the 12th June the breeding hen was carrying nesting material.
It will be necessary to distinguish between these two hens in order
to make my story intelligible, so we will call this one "Beauty,"
because she possessed the greatest gift of the Gods ; the other we
will call "The Flirt" because she seemed most anxious to win the
affections of the male and used to follow him about with quivering
wings. The male assisted in the construction of the nest and on the
19th Beauty was missing and had presumably commenced to sit. The
nest was on the Common, under a tuft of heather and close to the
wooden panelling of the aviary, but so well concealed that it was
impossible to look into it without removing the heather, in the very
roots of which it was embedded.
Now we come to the queer part of my story. A few days
later The Flirt was also missing. Where was The Flirt's nest ? I
had seen no pairing, no building--yet she must have a nest some-
where. Now the Common was not what you would call extensive --
perhaps some nine feet by five feet--but looking for a Whinchat's
nest is at -all times rather like hunting for a needle in a bundle of

Mr. W. E. Teschemakek,
hay, and I looked in vain. The annoying part of it was that it was
impossible to examine Beauty's nest without stepping on the Com-
mon, and, if one did this, the chances were that one would step on
The Flirt's nest. So I waited and watched. Now and again a
sharp eye would get a glimpse of Beauty leaving&apos; her nest as one
entered the aviary, but The Flirt would either leave the nest before
that event or else she would judiciously select the exact moment
when one's back was turned. So the mystery remained a mystery
until almost the end of the last chapter. 0 wonderful Book of
Birds ! So vividly interesting and yet so hard to translate and with
so much written between the lines ! What mistakes we often make
in trying to read that Book !
The male never sat and never fed the hens, so when, on the

2nd July, I saw him stealthily carry an insect to the nest I knew
that the Stork had alighted on our aviary and that Beauty was a
proud mother. A day or two later The Flirt also began to feed, so I
concluded that the Stork must have paid us another visit, and from
the extraordinary celerity with which the live-bait disappeared one
might have reasonably thought that there were at least a dozen
young&apos; Whinchats. The Flirt, mysterious as ever, would not give us

the least hint as to the whereabouts of her family. She would perch
in a medlar-tree, piping " u-tic," (the first syllable very long, the
second very short) and sometimes " u-tic-tic " for half-an-hour at a
time until one's patience was exhausted. But one day I detected
The Flirt in the very act of leaving&apos; the nest and--it was Beauty's
irest she left. At last the mystery was solved. I went down on my
knees and turned over every inch of the Common. Yes, there was
only one nest, and that contained five well-grown young Whinchats,
evidently all of the same family. What then had The Flirt been
doing all this time ? She had been helping her more fortunate
sister to rear the latter's family : just that and nothing less. I have
known polygamy where there should have been monogamy ; I have
known communal nests containing&apos; clutches of eggs laid by two
hens ; I have known assistance given in rearing a brood by a parent
who had lost her own brood, and also by the young of an earlier
brood, but that a hen, whose charms had been despised and advances
rejected, should voluntarily assist a rival whom she had every reason

to hate, seemed so strange, so contrary to nature, as to be almost
unbelievable. Yet it was so. 0 splendid little lady, who chose the
better part ! 0 wonderful Book of Birds !
In the very early hours of the 14th we had a terrific thunder-
storm followed by a cloud-burst of a tropical character, three quarters
of an inch of rain falling&apos; in half an hour. It must have needed courage
to stick to the post of duty during that storm, hut the two little Chats
evidently never flinched, for on the following day the five youngsters
flew and looked bonny. They were a light brown on the hack, many
of the feathers being margined with buff, the lower half of the tail
feathers much darker brown, the breast sparsely spotted with dark
brown, the light buff superciliary streak rather conspicuous. They
kept well apart, each selecting a good hiding where there was thick
cover, and it was impossible to locate them, except by the aid of the
faint chuckling notes they uttered when hungry. On the 17th I
approached the aviary quietly and saw one perched on the top of a
gorse-bush (it had yet to learn discretion), sunning itself. But The
Flirt was doing sentinel duty and was well prepared for such an
emergency; she flew straight at the youngster and, with a dexterous
stroke of her wing, knocked him headlong into the thickest part of
the cover. 0 wonderful Book of Birds ! The adults began to moult
on the 19th.
On the 3rd August I caught all the Whinchats and made the
following note :--" Colour of young Chats. Some have warm buff
breasts (probably males) and some whitish-buff ditto (probably
females) ; all have some spots and striations on the breast ; basal
half of primaries white on anterior margins ; rest of flights blackish-
brown ; some have a buff spot on angle of wing (probably males) ;
upper half of tail white except two centre rectrices ; curious long
reddish-brown median upper tail coverts, nearly Tg-ins., tips rather
square (possible object to conceal contrasted colour areas of tail) ;
superciliary streak light buff, more conspicuous in some (possibly
males)."
I released the whole family except one young male on the
same day. As in all other matters connected with birds, this has to
be carefully and wisely done, not relying on " luck," or the erstwhile
prisoners will assuredly starve; for, though a bird never forgets any-

thing, it does not know in a strange locality where to find food, and
it has become rusty in the art of catching insects. I notice that
when these starving birds return to the aviary for food, as they often
will, their owners .sometimes write enthusiastic letters to the weekly
press, announcing that they can prove that birds prefer captivity to
freedom ! However, given fine summer weather and liberal feeding
(supplementary to what they can find), they soon become self-support-
ing. For several days my Whinchats required a lot of assistance,
especially the youngsters, who seemed to forage for nothing but ants
(on which they had been partly reared). With a whistle and a swing
of the bait-can I could call them up at any time ; in fact, a Bank
Holiday tripper, one of the many readers of a certain weekly paper,
who paid me a visit on the 5th, found me sitting in the garden with
the whole family taking lunch under my chair. On the following
day they disappeared, and, though it seemed odd that they should all
go on the same day, still, as they looked quite prosperous when last
seen, I think it probable that all went well and that in due course
they flitted away southward over the dim blue hills on their long
journey to the corn-fields of the Gambia. Quocl felix fciustumque sit.
P.S.--The young male did very well in a cage. He underwent an
extensive moult, especially of the breast and neck feathers,
and yet he sang throughout the moult. On the 23rd August
I watched him pulling several breast feathers out with his
beak. After the moult, the crown was darker, the breast
brighter and had lost almost all the dark spots ; the median
tail coverts, above alluded to, were replaced by others rather
shorter with pointed tips ; a small white patch appeared near
the angle of the wing, almost entirely concealed by the lesser
coverts.

By H. E. Goddard.
In my perusal of the monthly numbers of the Avicultural
Magazine , it has often occurred to me that it would be a good
thing if some of our members, whose names we only know through
their appearance in the yearly list, would give us their experiences
from time to time. I refer especially to those who, like myself, keep
but a small number of birds, and those of the most commonly
imported and, therefore, cheap species.
My own experience dates from about twenty-five years ago,
when I purchased a pair of Bronze Mannikins, which, though not
particularly interesting themselves, gave me that love for the little
foreigners which I have never lost. The list of birds which I have
kept is not a very extensive one : -- Waxbills, Avadavats, Ribbon
Finches, Gouldian, Zebra, Long-tailed Grass Finches, Red Crested
Cardinals, Green and Grey Singing Finches and Ruficaudas, Bud-
gerigars, Cockateels, Madagascar and Blue-winged Love Birds and
Blossom-headed Parrakeets practically comprising the lot. My only
experience of Soft-bills, largely through want of time to attend to
them, has been with Pekin Nightingales, cheap, but nevertheless
very delightful birds and mostly, easily tamed. But the birds
which have and still attract me most are the small seed-eaters,
Waxbills and Grass Finches, especially the former. My pocket is a
modest one and consequently I have had to confine my attention to
the more common varieties. Of these I have had, at various times,
the common and green Avadavats, Cordon Bleu, Orange-cheek,
Orange-breasted, Common African and Cinereous Waxbills.
With the exception of the Green Avadavat, I have had more
experience of these birds than of any of the others I have mentioned
and, therefore, will try and give, in as few words as possible, my
ideas of them as desirable inmates of an aviary.
They are all delightful little birds and have given me many a
happy hour watching their interesting ways. Of course, we know
that the great aim of the aviculturist is to get his birds to reproduce
their species, and although this has been my wish for many years
past, I must frankly confess that up to the present, I have completely

Mr. H. E. Goddard,
failed. One pair of Cordons in my possession some years ago did get
as far as young birds, but as far as could be judged never attempted
to feed them. They built a very nice nest completely domed over,
with hole at side, well concealed in a wire flower basket. The
birds sat splendidly and there the matter ended. Possibly with
another attempt they might have succeeded hut, unfortunately, the
hen died, and although the cock bird lived for eight years and was
provided with other partners yet no hen lived long enough to go
to nest. Herein perhaps lies the difficulty in breeding these birds.
It seems almost an impossibility to get a true pair of birds to live
long enough to get thoroughly used to the climate and their surround-
ings, either the cock or the hen " pop off " just when you think
you are about to he successful. But I suppose aviculture will
always be full of such disappointments.
With the other Waxbills or Avadavats I have never got
beyond eggs and, even when the birds laid, it was without the
slightest attempt at making a nest. Apart, however, from breeding,
their little lives are full of interest, the sprightly love dance of the
Cordon with his shrill whistle, the sweet little song of the Avadavat
and the warning note of the Orange-cheek, each has its charm.
Then again the plumage is not to be despised. What is more
beautiful than the full dress of the little cock Avadavat. It has
often seemed to me that if these birds were expensive they would
be much more highly prized. The one I have now was purchased
last Autumn out of colour. He started to don his full dress in
May and completed it by the end of June. The red patches on the
underparts appeared to extend gradually, but whether by moulting
the old feathers and growing fresh ones, or by the colour of the
existing feathers changing, I am unable to say. Has this point
ever been cleared up ?
I have found the Cordon Bleus the most difficult to get
acclimatised. They are usually in such poor condition when they
arrive here that it is no easy matter to pull them round. The best
thing, in my experience, when they will take it is the green fly
or aphis so common on our rose trees. The other Waxbills appear
to offer no special difficulty if they are in reasonably good condition
when purchased.

The best guide as to condition seems to me to be the eyes. If
they are at all sunken reject the birds, but if they are bright and full,
even though the plumage may be defective, it is usually pretty safe
to take them, as with reasonable care for the first few weeks they
will soon be in the pink of condition. Even with the Cinereous
Waxbill, which is usually considered very delicate, I found no
difficulty. Perhaps, however, I should not say much on this point
as I have had only one pair, but they lived in my aviary for a good
many years. One of them escaped twice, and on one occasion was
at large for two days, but he kept in the immediate neighbourhood
and seemed very pleased when I was able to get him into the aviary
once more. That is one of the most striking characteristics of
these little feathered mites, their great contentment with their
\0x25A0captivity.
Of other birds I have kept there is not much to say. Zebra
Finches have always been short-lived. This may not be the general
experience but it has always been mine. Gouldians and Ruficaudas
are delightful birds, but at present I have only a cock bird of the
latter left, and with their current high prices am not likely to
replace them. Ribbon Finches are somewhat dull and clumsy and
a bit of a nuisance with the other small birds.
As regards accommodation, I have a cage of the Crystal
Palace variety indoors, principally used for wintering the small
birds, an outdoor aviary with flight 16ft. by 8ft. and indoor shelter
4ft. by 8ft. and part of my 18ft. greenhouse wired off. The last
named appears to suit the Waxbills very well and they do no
appreciable harm to the plants growing there.
I am aware that there is no matter of great interest in
these personal notes, but they are written in the hope that they
will be the means of bringing some of our retiring members
forward, as after all it is the sum of the little experiences which
make up the total of general knowledge, and it is only by gathering
together the general concensus of opinion that we can arrive at definite
results. Will some members who have been successful breeders
of Waxbills now come forward and give us of their wisdom ?
I venture to think that I shall not be the only reader interested.

An important recent addition to the collection of birds is a
pair of Great-billed Ravens (Gorvnltur crassirostris), from Abyssinia,
a present from the Marquess of Tavistock, and the first of their kind
to be exhibited in the collection.
This remarkable Raven is about the size of the common
species, glossy black, with a brownish shade to some of the upper
wing-coverts, and the back of the head is decorated with a large
white patch. But the most remarkable feature of this bird is its
bill, the upper mandible of which is greatly swollen and arched,
the colour being black, with the tips white.
In habits this Raven does not appear to differ appreciably
from other Ravens, feeding for the most part on carrion, while
small animals, insects and fruit are also taken. Its voice is a
harsh croak.
The Zoological Society has recently purchased from the sale
of Mons. Pauwel's collection some rare and interesting pigeons ;
namely, one Wallace's Fruit-Pigeon (.Ptilopus ivallacei), a beautiful
bird of pale grey, green and orange, with a blood-red cap on the
crown ; a pair of Pearl-spotted Fruit Pigeons (Ptilopus zonurus),
green with yellow heads, a band of grey on the nape and pink spots
on the wing coverts ; a pair of Orange-bellied Fruit Pigeons (Ptilopus
iozonus), small birds of a dark green colour, with greyish-blue
shoulder patches, and a large patch of rich orange on the abdomen ;
and a single specimen of the Yellow-bellied Ground Dove (Phlogcenas
helviventris ), a species allied to the well-known Blood-breasted
Pigeon. In colour it is deep chestnut above, with the breast and
underparts yellow. It is one of the most striking looking doves one
has seen for some time.
The above birds are natives of the Aru Islands and all are
new to the Zoological Society's collection, and probably to aviculture
generally.
Besides these, however, there is a splendid specimen of the
White Fruit Pigeon (Myristicivora luctuosa) from Celebes, of which a

When an author publishes a book on the subject which has
been his life-long study, the results cannot fail to be of interest, and
when that subject is one about which so much mystery has been
made in the past, and that is still but imperfectly understood, one
may well expect a considerable addition to the knowledge already
existing on the subject.
Mr. Eagle Clarke has given us a delightful book, written in a
remarkably clear style, and explaining in a manner, which has not
been attempted before, the remarkably complex migrations which
are continually taking place in our islands. The Chapter of the
Starling, for instance, is a model of how such a series of very
complicated facts should be treated, and we venture to think that
many readers will learn with some surprise of the practically con-
tinuous movements that are going on amongst some of our commonest
species throughout the year. We have mentioned the Starling in
particular, but there are almost equally good Chapters on other
common species, namely, the Swallow, Fieldfare, White Wagtail,
Song Thrush, Skylark, Lapwing, and Rook. These Chapters alone

form a complete vade viecum to all the different kinds of migration
that take place over our islands.
The whole of the second volume, and part of the first, is
devoted to accounts of the author's visits to various Lighthouses,.
Lightships, and lonely islets round our shores. These accounts are
pleasantly written and include a complete list of all the birds obtained
at the various stations.
The island which has been most continuously worked in this
respect is ' Fair Island.' This is a small island, lying midway
between the Shetlands and Orkneys, about one mile broad by 21-
miles long, it is surrounded by a belt of precipitous cliffs and covered
with heather, grass, stunted junipers, and on the lower ground there
are a few small ' loehaws ' and a little marsh ground. On this small
area Mr. Eagle Clarke has come across within the space of 65 years
no less than 207 species of birds or 1 about one half of the birds that
have ever been known to have occurred in the British Isles. Of
these, five species are recorded from our islands for the first time,
while some species considered as rare stragglers have occurred on
several occasions and in small numbers. What light do these facts
throw on the general theory of migration ? Here, perhaps, our
author is a little disappointing. One might have hoped that with
his practical knowledge of migration and his undoubted power of
unravelling the tangled skein of the different routes taken by the
same species which, at certain times of the year, are taking place
simultaneously through Great Britain, some definite hypothesis
might have been forthcoming which would have attempted to solve
the large subject of migration in its general aspect.
Mr. Eagle Clark has decided otherwise and, perhaps, wisely..
This book is, as set forth in the preface, merely a record of his own
studies, no attempt has been made to investigate or criticize the work
of others, which would have been essential were the subject treated
in its more general aspect.
Many have rushed into print (or manuscript) from earliest
times to the present day, giving to the world theories of migration,
many of them of a somewhat wild and fantastic type, and if we are
disappointed at the absence of hypothesis, we have at least the
satisfaction of feeling that no mistakes have been made. At the

SIR,--Since writing about the Blue Thrush, which improved so wonder-
fully in a short time by being in the fresh air, a sequel has proved yet more
strikingly the truth that air means life. I parted with the bird in question to a
home where he was kept indoors, in a room at a window which was not always
open. He only lived a few months, and an autopsy showed that he died of
consumption. I quite believe that he might have lived longer and remained
in health had he been out of doors instead of in.
Another proof was exemplified by my Laughing Kingfishers, supposed to
need much warmth. They enjoyed a cold frosty day thoroughly, and broke the
ice (thin ice) in their bath for a bathe.
But I mentioned this in a notice on these birds--"Jack and Jill" -- in a
number of the Magazine in 1911. K. CURREY.

SIR,--On June 12th when feeding one of my Hangnests--the example
figured in the volume for 1907--I discovered that a mouse had foolishly entered
the small aviary compartment and had not only been killed by the Hangnest,
but its head had been picked to pieces and devoured. I was aware that this bird
was bloodthirsty from the fact that some years previously it had slaughtered one
bird and seriously mauled a second in the adjoining compartment, but it was
new to me to discover that it would devour what it had killed. Doubtless in
their wild state the Hangnests do not confine their predatory assaults to insects,
but also prey upon small vertebrates. A. G. BUTLER.
BREEDING QUAILS.
I was much interested to see in the Avicultural Magazine that they had
succeeded in breeding the Douglas Quail at the Zoo this season.
I have been similarly successful with the Venezuelan Quail ( squamata )

and have also a troop of young from a Venezuelan cock and Californian hen. I
believe that this is the first time they have been bred in England. These have
been entirely raised by the parents, the cock in both instances doing most of the
mothering. The hybrids look like making exceedingly handsome birds.
I thought that you might be interested to hear this.

EARLY IMPORTATION OF THE RUFFED LORY.

The following letter, received by Mr. SETH-SMITH is of considerable
interest as it shows that the Ruffed Lory (Calliptilus solitarius) of Fiji, was
actually brought alive to this country forty years ago. Dr. Bahr, it will be
remembered, brought a pair of these most beautiful, though decidedly delicate,
parrots home in 1911, ( Avic. Mag., December 1911), which were believed to be
the first imported. A description of the birds was appended to the following
letter, and leaves no doubt as to the identity of the species.
"DEAR Sir,--N oticing under the heading "Birds at the Zoo" in the
Morning Post of Sept. 10th, mention of the Parrot Finches of Fiji, I am
interested to know if they are of the same family as the little friends I suc-
ceeded in bringing from Fiji round Cape Horn alive to England, when Com-
mander of H.M.S. "Clio" 40 years ago, being kept alive during their long
voyage of some 15,000 miles by being housed in a cage protected by glass and
warmed by hot-water bottles and ordinary night-lights ; their food consisting
of condensed milk and honey.
At the time to which I refer these birds were considered so rare that the
Curator of the Sydney Gardens, N.S.W. did not even possess a pair and
entreated me, instead of venturing on the attempt to take them all the way to
England, to leave them in Australia. But I had visions of being able to
execute the work taken in hand of conveying them home, and, possibly, one
day seeing them ensconced in the Zoological Gardens ; and, although I was
successful as to the first, fate decreed disappointment as to the latter. One
little bird succumbing during a snow-storm as the anchor was let go at Spit-
head, and its companion shortly afterwards, by injury, received during my
absence from home.
I have had many pets in my time. Humming Birds in the West Indies,
Love Birds and Mousedeer in the Straits of Malacca, &amp;c., but I consider the
Fiji Parrakeets far away the most interesting. They were devotedly attached
to one another and, if separated but for a moment, would screech till again
together. This was particularly noticeable and amusing when occupying their
sleeping chamber--a cocoanut shell suspended from top of their cage.

Writing to Mr. SETH-SMITH, under date June 1st, 1912, Mr. E. Le
SOUEF, the Director of the Zoological Gardens at Perth, Western Australia,
sends the following interesting notes : --
" Our Zoo. has made great strides since you saw it, and you would hardly
recognise much of it now. We reared a lovely pair of Manchurian Cranes
this season, which are now finer than their parents. We also have a fine
collection of Tantalus in perfect feather and with the cris-cross black and
white markings on the wings and rose-coloured rump. They make a lovely
colour scheme. We reared many White Swans, Carolina Ducks and Varie-
gated Sheldrakes. Our Emus are laying. Last year the Queen Alexandra
Parrakeets laid, but other birds took their eggs, and the same thing happened
to the Red-headed Cardinals.
We have a pair of large Indian Hornbills doing very well. They are in a
large open aviary where they can fly round and hop from perch to perch, and
they have improved out of all knowledge since their arrival.
We bred two strong young Macaws (Ara macao), but a dreadfully hot day
killed them both when about ten days old. I think that the heat affected the
old birds so much that they could not manage to feed their young.
Our Geese and ducks are well, and I am putting dried meat into their
food, as the dry climate and poor sandy soil seems to prevent their breeding.
Ducks, however, breed freely a few miles from here where the soil is of clay.
We have beautiful palms forty feet high bearing thousands of seeds, and
all our trees are well-grown and very thick and suitable for birds, and the
result is that Honey-eaters of several kinds breed in the Zoo. We feed them
with honey and water suspended from the trees. We also have Fantails, Wag-
tails, Zosterops, Chats, and many other birds as regular inhabitants of the
Gardens.
We breed the Southern Stone Plover every year, and they run loose among
the visitors and do not mind being lifted off their eggs.
We learnt a curious fact the other day, namely, that some of the Honey-
eaters kill and eat smaller birds. Our Head-keeper saw a Wliite-eyebrowed
Honey-eater chase and kill a Silver-eye ( Zosterops ) and start to eat it. I
suppose that it is need of animal food owing to insects being scarce here.
We counted eight hundred Black Swans, eighty Pelicans, and many hun-
dreds of ducks on the Swan River the other day."

One of the matters that arose for discussion at the Council
Meeting in the summer was the question of printing the Balance
Sheet and issuing it annually to Members, a practice which was
formerly adopted but which has been discontinued for many years.
The Council, however, was of the opinion that it was un-
necessary to incur the expense involved, unless there was a widely
expressed feeling on the part of Members that it should be done.
They decided, however, that a copy of the Balance Sheet should be
kept by the Hon. Business Secretary at his office in the Zoological
Gardens, and any Member of the Society who wished to see it could
do so by giving the Secretary forty-eight hours notice of his-
intention to call. R. I. POCOCK.
THE MEMBERS' DINNER.
Members of the Society will recollect that a proposal to hold
a Dinner in London after the Council Meeting at the end of January
or the beginning of February has been under consideration. Since,
however, Members cannot be expected to pledge themselves so long
beforehand, the matter has been left in the hands of the Business
Secretary who will make the necessary arrangements, provided a
sufficient number of Members express their willingness to attend.
The date and other particulars of the proposed dinner will be
announced in the January issue of the Magazine, and Members will
then be invited to let the Secretary know if they wish to be present.

By Frank Finn, B.A., F.Z.S.
Although we have heard a great deal about aviculture as a
scientific study, the fact remains that the avicultural purview has so
far remained very limited, and neither in private collections, bird-
shows, or Zoological Gardens do we find any all-round representation
of the many families of birds ; yet, without this all-round represen-
tation, aviculture cannot be said to be scientific. The reason is, of
course, that the ordinarily-kept families, such as passerine birds,
parrots, doves, pheasants and ducks, are so much easier than the
others that the temptation is to acquire good series of these and to
consider that a rare species is a great acquisition, while neglecting a
family which is seldom kept at all.
The rarer families of birds have, however, always had a great
attraction for me ; not only are they likely to be of more scientific
interest, hut they are often by their very unfamiliarity of form and
w r ays, more pleasant to watch, while some species among them may
he far easier subjects than many birds belonging to the more ordinary
avicultural groups. For instance, for a bird which lias the distinction
of being&apos; the unique representative of its family, easy to keep, and in-
teresting in its ways, we may refer to the Kagu (Bhinochetus jubatus )
whose quaint and affable manners we have mostly admired at the
Zoo. The first known eg&apos;g of this species, by the way, was laid there
many years ago--a triumph far greater than the modern breeding
results we hear so much about.
I purpose here, then, to say something about members of
rarely-kept families of which I have had personal experience, and I
shall use my own experience as a peg on which to hang remarks or
suggestions re the treatment of out-of-the-way birds which I have
only seen kept by others, chiefly at various Zoos, which are not un-
fortunately, usually good schools for high-class scientific aviculture,
though an absolute beginner may learn much there about the keeping
of hardy unkillable stuff.

Practical Bi rd - Keeping.
For a full account of what groups have been bred in captivity
and their incubation periods, &amp;c., I may refer to my book " The
World's Birds."
Among perching birds, these families which are called in the
less modem works " Picarian " (i.e. all perching birds other than
Passerines and Parrots have always been my favourites), and when
I went to India I was delighted with the commonness of Rollers,
Bee-eaters, Woodpeckers, and Barbets, and soon set to work to
acquire experience which might be of use to amateurs not so happily
\0x25A0situated. I found that the young of that glorious creature the
Indian Roller (Coracias inclica )--always called Blue-Jay in India--
were quite easily reared on cut-up raw meat and cockroaches ; the
cockroaches were very satisfying, being of the great American kind
(.Periplaneta americana ) now thoroughly established in India. The
same food also suited adults, which I have successfully " meated
off," beginning with cockroaches with the heads pulled off, which
leaves them helpless but kicking, then going on to small dead fish
and shrimps, and finally proceeding to the raw meat.
Fish and shrimps are, of course, unnatural food for thorough
land birds like these, but they take the place of lizards and large
insects, and are suitable for all birds which eat these; Rollers
especially need something with hard parts in it, to form their pellets,
for like so many (though not all) insectivorous birds, they cast up
the hard parts of their food like birds of prey. Rollers are not at
all suited for cage-life -- no birds which either sit still or fly are so,
unless very small--and if they have to be confined in a cage at all
this should be as long as possible and have only two perches, as
mentioned in my remarks on transport. In aviaries they are charm-
ing, and the European species was bred successfully in 1901 by our
member Mr. St. Quintin, the young birds being reared at first on
insects, then on chopped-up raw rabbit (fur and all) and hard-
boiled egg, which was the usual food of the old birds.
Rollers will devour any small bird they can swallow, and I
have seen both the European and the Indian species at the Zoo
greedily gulp down lettuce in large pieces. Chopped lettuce should
therefore be supplied, and it is as well to dilute, as it were, chopped
raw meat with biscuit-meal or dry-boiled rice. Suitable companions

for Rollers are other large insect-eaters and such birds as small
Gulls, Plovers, and the Great Laughing Kingfishers ( Dacelo ).
Woodpeckers I never bothered much about, as they are better
known in Europe than Rollers, but I reared, on cockroaches chiefly,
the beautiful Golden-backed species (Braehypternus aurantius) which
is the commonest over most of India, and the best Woodpecker I
have seen in captivity. However, our own species are so good, that
they quite sufficiently represent the family, and I hope some who
have had experience with them will summarize their results with
this family in the present series.
I never troubled to send any Rollers or Woodpeckers home,
there being already European species available, for I made a rule,
when sending birds for the Zoo, to avoid as far as possible represen-
tatives of groups already available either in nature or in the trade,
holding that it is not the business of a scientific official to encourage
stinginess or want of enterprise in scientific societies, or to interfere
with the hard-earned livelihood of those much and unjustly abused
individuals, our dealers.
For the same reason I had little to do with Barbets, the Blue-
fronted ( Cyanops asiatica) being already well-known when I went to
India in 1894; but my experience with the Coppersmith or Crimson-
breasted Barbet ( Xantholcema licematocepliala) may be worth re-
cording, as it throws light on some recurrent avicultural problems.
In the Marshalls' monograph of the Capitoniclce or Barbets will he
found the statement that Barbets do not thrive in captivity, a
statement that lias been duly copied by other writers ignorant of
aviculture. Now everyone knows that Barbets are easy subjects,
treated as Mr. Townsend has recommended for Tanagers--in fact,
the Blue-cheeked is one of the easiest soft-bills (the term is used
technically, not literally, as all Barbets bite like fiends) one can keep;
and I fancy that my friend the Coppersmith started the story. He
is the commonest of Barbets, plying his miniature gong in the street
trees in Calcutta ; yet I was told he could not be kept. I thought
the reason was that satoo, the standard soft-bill food, did not suit
him, and I found that adult birds could be meated off, or rather
fruited off' " on banana, and live on that alone ; young birds could
also be reared on this simple diet, and I found that at any rate when

reared, bread-and-milk could be consumed with impunity. Since
then, a few have reached England, and, though undoubtedly delicate
compared with others, this charming Barbet is evidently not the
impossible subject our native dealers supposed. Small blame to
them--they were probably feeding birds on satoo in the time of
Alexanders' invasion, and I was not surprised that my success did
not alter their methods--should the aviculture of ages be upset by a
mushroom European ? I, however, profited by the lesson and by
the similar one I learnt in connection with the Cotton Teal ( Nettapus
coromandelianus ) another impossible bird (of which I sent the first
specimens home) and have since stedfastly refused to believe in the
impossibility of keeping any bird. The Asiatic Barbets, by the way,
are far more purely fruit-eaters and more unsociable than the two
African species I have seen.
I have had some most interesting experiences with Cuckoos, an
interesting group which are grossly neglected as a rule. The easiest
of all is the Koel ( Euclyncimis honorata), which is a favourite cage-
bird in Calcutta, and should be represented in any scientific collection.
Being, unlike most Cuckoos, a fruit-eater, it is easily catered for.
It is parasitic on crows, and a pair of tame jackdaws or magpies
should make good fosterers for it. Being so common, and having
been exhibited at home, I did not trouble about it, but more than
once reared specimens of that fine non-parasitic cuckoo the Indian
Coucal ( Gentropus rufipennis) locally known as the Crow-pheasant, a
name much apter than it sounds. In habits and general form this
species resembles a magpie, and can be reared on cut-up raw meat,
snails, and cockroaches, and when grown allowed liberty about a
garden. It is an enemy to any small bird it can catch, and will eat
lizards and snakes. I had one loose which fed itself on toads and
refuse boiled rice ! This bird has been represented at the London
Zoo, and ought always to be an view. Another non-parasitic
cuckoo, the Guira or White Ani ( Guira guira) of South America, has
also been frequently imported, and has bred in this country. Like
the Crow-pheasant, it is carnivorous.
I was lately shown a fine specimen of our common cuckoo,
belonging to Mr. Harwood, the taxidermist, whose success as an
aviculturist in keeping this bird (and in a thrush cage) till it has come

into full adult plumage), is as remarkable as his beautiful taxi dermic
work. The bird, it is useful to know, has been fed almost entirely
on hard-boiled egg and mealworms, though of course, like most
*cuckoos, it greatly appreciates hairy caterpillars.
Trogans have never fallen to my personal lot, hut the first
-one I ever knew to be kept in captivity since the time the ancient
Aztecs kept the Quezal ( Pharomacrus mocinno) for its feathers, was
a specimen of the Indian Red-headed Trogon ( Harpactes erythro-
cephalus ) which we had in the Calcutta Zoo in my time. This was
fed entirely on grasshoppers and cockroaches, and kept in a cage. I
also recently saw again the first Trogon ever brought to England,
the Cuban Trogon (. Prionotelus tevmurus ) which was imported by Mr.
Frost in 1907, and had been in Mr. Maxwell's hands. Other speci-
mens have since been imported, and the Zoo have owned one and
had two (I believe a pair) on deposit, hut in neither case did the
birds live a fourth as long as Mr. Maxwell's. Private individuals'
birds must be expected to have an advantage in the fact that their
owners have paid for them themselves ; hut the fact that no attempt
was made to encourage the pair (?) exhibited to breed, or even to put
them in an outdoor flight, shows how little science is regarded at the
Zoo. The young stages of Trogons are almost unknown, and to
have elucidated them would have been to win some of that respectful
recognition from skin-ornithologists for which some of our avicul-
turists are continually hankering, as if the study of live birds were
not infinitely the more scientific of the two, if people needs must
specialise !
The only observation I have been able to make on captive
Trogons is that they hop when moving on the ground, not waddling
like Bee-eaters or most Kingfishers. I should recommend anyone
keeping them to hang up bunches of grapes or berries in their aviary,
as the fruit-eating forms, like the Cuban, which are the only ones w 7 e
are likely to get yet awhile, dart out and pluck their fruit on the
wing as if taking insects. They would need a covered nest-box, as
they breed in holes, and though more active on their feet than many
short-legged birds, are eminently not birds for small cages.
Kingfishers are very easily obtained in India, and I have
hand-reared the common species -- much commoner out there -- the

beautiful Piecl ( Cenjle ruclis ) and the great Stork-billed ( Pelargopsis
gurial) ; all Kingfishers are easily brought up if one has fish to give
them and can stand the yells and smells they generate. When they
are reared,however, the difficulty begins, as they knock themselves
about in a cage, and in an aviary are generally too quarrelsome for
even a pair to live together, though individuals of different species
will do so. For aviculture, therefore, the best species are the well-

SALE OF MONS. R. PAUWEL'S
COLLECTION.
The breaking up of the unique collection of foreign birds,
belonging to Mons. K. Pauwels, of Brabant, Belgium, is an event
of some importance in the history of aviculture, for this was pro-
bably the finest private collection of rare living birds ever brought
together. From the catalogue, which we understand has been sent
to all the members of the Avicultural Society, there appears to he
some three hundred foreign birds, mostly of very rare specie, for
disposal, amongst which may be mentioned Pileated and Bourke's

SUCCESSFUL BREEDING OF THE
GRAND ECLECTUS PARROT.
By Miss Drummond.

<bodyText confidence="0.999139041666667" page_id="32654867"  page_num="Page 49" year="" vol="">
My attempt to breed the Grand Eclectus Parrot has gone on
for three years. The pair have had four nests, but the eggs have
all been clear, except last year, when one hatched out, but owing to
a badly-constructed log the chick fell out and was killed at about
three weeks old, probably caught in the hen's wing. However,
fortune has turned, and I have now two well-grown, well-feathered
young ones--male and female--feeding themselves and flying in and
out of the flight when the window is opened on fine days. It is, I
suppose, being lighter than the old birds that they use their wings so
much, the old ones generally only scramble from one end of their
aviary to the other.
The eggs are white, about the size of a large walnut, and there
are always two. Incubation lasts 30 days, during which time the hen
seldom comes out of the log, and is fed almost entirely by the male.
These young ones were hatched about July 21st, and came
out of the log on October 9th, returning to sleep there for the first
ten days. While in the log the hen fed them entirely for the first
month, as, during incubation, the hen was almost entirely fed by
the cock. Then she fed herself, as well as receiving from the cock,
and a large amount of food was consumed by both birds, viz. :
boiled Indian corn damp, Osborne biscuit made into sop, with a little
Mellins' food made with boiled milk, and either baked rice-pudding&apos;
or boiled potato, besides the usual seed, two or three apples, chick-
weed and lettuce and a few nuts. The green food I thought most

necessary, as the more they had of it the more they seemed to eat
of the other foods, which was most important, as the young birds
for the first two months never seemed satisfied, and the noise they
made when hungry, as they generally seemed to be, was more like
young puppies than birds.
The log--18in. by 20in.--is a piece of a trunk of a tree bored
out. It was rather dark, which made it very difficult to watch the
growth of the plumage ; besides which the hen always returned when-
ever she saw anyone looking in ; but on August 20th I saw grey dowu
on wings and part of the head, the rest was quite bare. On 31st, a
red tinge on one head. Sept. 2nd I noticed red and green feathers
showing&apos; on the two tails and down on wings and a little on the back.
Sept. 9th, tail-feathers much larger and a tinge of colour in wings ;
backs quite covered with down. They were very lively, making
dabs and rushes at one's hand. By Sept. 18th the young male's
head was quite feathered, and there were a good many feathers on
the chest, but the back was still unfeathered. The hen was longer in
feathering, and for some time after the male's head was quite green,
she had only a red fringe over the eyes, the rest grey down ; yet she
got her tail-feathers first, and I thought her the oldest. On and
after October 1st they came out occasionally on the platform in front
of the log, but if anyone came into the aviary this most careful
mother would push the young back. When they were outside I first
noticed the male bird feeding them, and they used to follow him for
food, after they came out altogether, which after a few days seemed
to annoy the female and she became very cross towards the male and
the young one, so on the 20th I had to cage her. He continued feeding
for another week, but has now given it up and they feed themselves
principally on seed, but I have not quite given up the Indian corn.
The beaks are not yet their proper colour, the young male's
being a very dusky orange with red tip, the female's a very dingy
black; the eyes have always been the same as those of the old birds
as far as I could see. I should add that the old birds are tame
and very clever and devoted to those they know. The male bird
says a few words.
I am afraid I have written at much too great length, but I am
told that the Eclectus has not been bred before in Great Britain.

Chrysomitris cucullata.
By Dr. M. Amsler.
In March 1909, I bought a pair of these charming birds from
-a fellow aviculturist; they arrived quite lively and well, but the cock,
as I had been warned, was " a trifle thick as he had not quite
finished his moult." As a matter of fact this was his normal con-
dition, for he was never as slim and tight in feather as his neat little
mate. This pair spent the warmer nine months of 1909, 1910, and
1911 in an open aviary with plenty of opportunities for nesting,
but, although they were obviously on very good terms and never far
from each other, we got no further than volumes of sweet music
from the male, and once I think an attempt on the part of the
female to build a nest; on the latter point, however, I am uncertain
as there was a very mixed collection in the aviary at that time.
The whole of last winter, the cock, who was obviously aged,
was very puffy and asthmatical, and as spring approached and his
condition did not improve I took the opportunity when in Bordeaux
of buying two cocks in perfect condition and feather, which I brought
back to England. On my arrival, I found as I expected, that the
old cock had departed this life, and I, therefore, introduced one of
the new comers to my hen. As I have this year changed my house
and have had to build new aviaries the birds were not turned out
until July 7th.
The Siskins shared the aviary with Gouldian Finches, Bufi-
caudas, Avadavats. and other Waxbills. Almost the first day I
noticed the hen carrying, but nothing more happened and my hopes
fell again to zero, for I could picture one of Mr. Hubert Astley's
beautiful little hens busy at work and robbing us of the medal
In the middle of July the hen was moulting, but the cock was still
in perfect feather and very attentive to his spouse, regularly feeding
her from the crop. On August 24th, I again noticed the hen carry-
ing bits of felt which I had given the Avadavats as a lining for their
nest. She was continually going in and out of a nest-box hung up
near the roof of the shelter, but she always emerged with the nest-
ing material still in her bill and, therefore, got no " forrader." The

Dr. M. Amsleb,
following clay I examined the nest-box and found nothing in it, so I
placed an old Chaffinch's nest firmly in the box, and hoped our friend
would line and make use of this. She was, however, very indignant
at my interference and began pulling the nest to pieces.
On the 26tlr of August I found she had taken possession of a
nest-box previously used and lined by my Ruficaudas. This box was
fortunately low down, about five feet from the ground and was open
at one end, so that one could easily see into the nest. A very neat
cup-shaped nest was built in thirty-six hours, of hay and cocoa-nut
fibre, lined with felt and feathers. The hen began to sit at once, but
no egg was laid until August 30tlr, The full clutch consisted of four
eggs, which were laid on consecutive days ; they were of the faintest
possible pink colour with very minute brown spots at the broad
end. Size : 16 mm. by 10 mm.
The male bird took no part in building or incubation, but was
always near the nest and ready to feed his mate when she came off.
The latter was a model sitter and I only saw her off the nest two or
three times during the whole incubation period.
On Sept. 13th (a Friday to wit) the first and only chick was
hatched, the other three eggs proving clear; it was quite naked and
of an orange-brown colour. On the 15th, I peeped into the nest
and saw a distinct increase in size, and a crop which was bulging
with food. I think this consisted of sponge cake and maw seed; in
fact, I believe the chick was reared on these two foods (of which
large quantities disappeared) and green food such as groundsel and
flowering grass. Here, again, the cock took no direct or active part,
although he was always ready to feed the hen when she left the
nest. After three or four days, however, she seemed to have no
further craving for pre-digested food and always took her fill of maw
seed and sometimes a little hemp as soon as the food supply was
given out in the morning.
On Sept. 21st, I heard the chick calling for food, and again on
the 24th, this time at a distance of twenty yards from the nest; on
this date I again looked into the nest, the three clear eggs were still
there and the chick w T as now a dark-brown colour and showing
feather. On Sept. 26tli, the orange-brown cross bars on the wing&apos;s
were clearly discernable.

On Sept. 29th (Sunday) I found the youngster sitting on the
edge of the nest, and later, at 4 p.m. he was squatting on the ground.
The weather was atrocious--floods of rain and a falling glass--so
fearing the chick would perhaps roost outside and be drowned, I did
a somewhat risky thing and caught both him and his mother, caged
them, and left fhe cage in the aviary so that the hen should not miss
her mate. Neither of the birds, however, seemed to mind my inter-
ference, so on the following day I brought the cage indoors, where
the birds would be protected from the night fog&apos;s which we get here
in the autumn. The male seemed none the worse for his enforced
celibacy, but I often heard him calling to the hen, who, I believe,
answered him, though at a distance of quite thirty yards.
On Oct. 1st I saw the chick fed by his mother on several
occasions, and he also picked up and ate sponge cake himself.
The following are my notes of his colour at this date: --
Beak dark horn colour; irides dark brown or black ; forehead, head,
and nape ashy brown ; back and rump rufous brown ; chin, chest
and underparts crimson brown ; primaries dark brown with grey
tips; secondaries similar, but having the outer web an orange brown
colour for a distance of half-an-ineh from their bases. Scapulars
dark-brown tipped with orange-brown ; wing coverts brown, tipped
with light brown ; tail dark brown; feet and legs flesh colour.
On Oct. 3rd the chick was again seen feeding, and on Oct.
4th could crack hard seeds and was flying strongly.
On Oct. 6th I caught up the cock and caged him together
with the hen and young Siskin. He behaved very well, and occa-
sionally relieved the hen by feeding the youngster. It is interesting
to note that he must have recognised his offspring, from whom he
had been separated for a week and whom he had only seen for an
hour or two after it left the nest, for I feel almost certain that he
never looked into the nest before the chick flew. At the age of five
weeks the sex of the young bird was evident and I was disappointed
to find that it was a male -- first the feathers on the chin and a few
days latter those on the forehead and occiput began to assume an
ashy-black colour. On October 25th I heard him attempting to sing,
the " song " resembled the sound made by rubbing a wet bottle with

occasions.
At the time of writing (November 7th j there is no trace of
scarlet in the young bird's plumage, and the black-cap and bib are
still very imperfect. The general colour is a cinnamon brown with
dark flights and tail and he is quite strong and independent of his
parents, although at nights he usually roosts between them.
I propose sending further notes on the changes of plumage at
a latter date, hut have written the foregoing account in compliance
with the Society's rule that nesting notes should be sent in eight
weeks from the date of hatching the young.

BREEDING NOTES FOR 1912.

By W. H. St. Quintin, F.Z.S.
The breeding season of 1912 will probably be long remem-
bered by most aviculturists as one full of disappointment. Besides
the never-ending rain, the absence of sun, and consequent low
temperature, was most unfavourable to young things of all sorts.
I began well by rearing five young Ravens. The old pair
brought up two last year and five the season before that, always
making a huge nest of boughs and twigs on a wine hamper lid fixed
up in a corner of their aviary, and lining it with moss and sods of
soft grass.
My Giant Kingfishers brought up two fine young birds,
hatching on the 17th May. Mr. Cosg&apos;rave has given a full account
of the successful rearing of a young bird of this species at Lilford
last year, so I need not give my experience, which confirms his.
In my case, both parents were most devoted, and by hard work
managed to keep the enormous appetites of their young family
satisfied.
A pair of Madagascar Hemipodes, put into an outdoor aviary
on April 26th, at once went to nest and reared two young from their
three eggs. We made out the period of incubation to be 14 days.
As there was no other male available, the hen bird was unable to
gratify her polyandrous instincts, and, to my surprise, showed a

good deal of interest in the chicks, offering them food and showing
anxiety when we entered the aviary. But the young always stuck
close to their father and I never saw them brooded by the female.
The chicks were luckily kept by the male most of the time under the
light of a large garden frame which was fixed near the ground in a
sloping position, supported on loose bricks. I recommend this as
a good way of keeping a piece of ground dry for such birds, even in
wet weather, without obstructing light.
Tour American Blue-birds were partly reared (all males), but
after they had left the nest, and had just begun to feed themselves,
they and the mother became affected with "gapes," and the young
died.
My Australian Cranes laid eggs (two clutches), but the female
is, I think, scarcely adult, and never showed the slightest interest in
them ; and the male, on each occasion, after sitting steadily for about
two days, apparently concluded that to incubate for so many weeks,
in such a summer, was not to be undertaken single-handed, and,
losing patience, he broke and sucked the beautiful eggs.
Of the nine young Cabot's Tragopans half-reared, only one
remains. They were treated exactly in the way that usually answers
perfectly. But the incessant damp and chilly weather was too much
for them, and one after another they drooped and died. And the
same with some chicks of Sonnerat's Jungle-fowl, we lost the first
brood. But in July the hen went to nest again, and though so late in
the season, by rearing entirely in a dry shed upon peat moss, and
supplying insect food by hand, we have managed to get two fine young
birds up. A young Impeyan, being reared by the parents, also died
one excessively wet night, when the size of a partridge. As with our
Game-birds in a bad season, the time when the young have grown
too large to be easily brooded by the parents, is very critical. They
miss the protection of the plumage of the mother bird, their own
feathers being soft and their covering not complete, and they cannot
stand much exposure.
But my great disappointment remains to be told. I have
more than once had young of the Little Bustard hatched, but the
chicks have never lived more than a few days, chiefly owing to the
nervousness and excitability of the mother, whose one idea was to

draw the young away when attempts were made to supplement the
failing&apos; supply of natural food in their enclosure.
But this year, a female bird which went to nest, was ex-
tremely tame, and even allowed us to put up the light belonging to a
small garden frame over her as she sat, so that the nest remained
dry all the miserable weather which we had in Yorkshire at that
time. Probably owing&apos; to the low temperature and absence of sun
the bird had gone to nest unusually late, and it was not till the 18th
July, after the usual incubation of 20 -- 21 days, that the two eggs
were hatched.
At first the chicks were tender and weak on their legs, and
wandered a very little way for some days ; and the mother with
much discretion took them to sleep under the light which still re-
mained over the nest. At this time the daily maximum ranged from
57 to 65, with minimum to 48, while rain fell at short intervals and
there was a total absence of sun. Of course all this was most
unfavourable to young&apos; birds of this class, accustomed to almost
incessant sun and a dry climate in their breeding-haunts.
We kept the birds very quiet, as they got so wet in the long&apos;
grass, when they crept away to hide : but gentles and wasp-grubs
were thrown down within their reach several times a day. On July
22nd I saw the old birds pick up something and call to the young,
who ran up from a distance of two or three yards to take the food
from her hill, and once I saw her take a gentle about the same
distance to the young, who kept close to some thick tufts of grass.
The little birds also were just beginning to pick up food themselves
in spite of the weather, they seemed doing&apos; well. I had to leave
home then till the 27th, when I found that one chick had succumbed.
They had grown fast, and no doubt the mother could not cover them
both so well as when they were first hatched. On the 3rd August,
the survivor was feathering, but it seemed sluggish, no doubt from
cold (the thermometer on the grass had fallen to 33 the previous
night) and the mother had given up trying&apos; to brood it. It died later
that day, and nothing remained hut to send it up to the Nat. Hist.
Museum as a specimen. I think in anything like an ordinary season
we should have reared these birds.
Young of Chilian and Chestnut-breasted Teal were reared, as

well as various species of more ordinary waterfowl; but the in-
clement season seemed to affect even these birds, for I never knew
so many unfertile egg&apos;s laid.
An otter, passing through my enclosure one night in March,
killed two valuable birds, a Versicolor and a Cinnamon Teal, both
drakes. It is not the first time that this has happened ; one spring
an otter broke up five pairs of ducks of different species in one
" raid." They are hard to keep out, and not the least provoking part
of it is that it is pure mischief that prompts the act, for the otter
seldom eats the birds, but contents himself with crushing their bodies
with his powerful jaws, apparently seizing them from below, while
swimming under water.

BIRDS.
By Dr. Arthur G. Butler.
In an article by W. L. McAfee, published in the Academy of
Natural Sciences of Philadelphia for June, 1912, entitled " The
experimental method of testing the efficiency of warning and cryptic
coloration in protecting Animals from enemies " the author argues
that the evidence brought forward in support of the theory of
protective coloration in animals by the students of animals in
captivity is altogether unsound, inasmuch as it has been proved by a
wholesale examination of the stomachs of wild animals that their
natural tastes differ considerably from those of captive animals : he
says with regard to information on the natural food habits of birds
contained in the United States Biological Survey " They comprise
detailed informations of the contents of more than 48,000 bird
stomachs representing all families of birds and collected in hundreds
of localities in the United States at all seasons. The United States
has a goodly representation of butterflies, yet only five of these
48,000 stomachs contained remains of Rhopalocera. It is hoped
this will be more satisfactory to the selectionists than the " negative
evidence " they are accustomed to cite with contempt."

Dr. A. G. Butleb,
Whereas I have always maintained that a great deal too much
stress lias been laid upon the importance of evidence afforded by the
acceptance or rejection of certain forms of living food by animals in
captivity and have always expressed my entire disbelief in the theory
of warning colours, that disbelief being itself based upon the study of
my own birds during the past thirty years, I think Mr. McAtee goes
too far in assuming that the numerous experiments made by many
observers with reference to protection are utterly valueless.
It is doubtless true that wild birds, which are able to hunt for
food over large tracts of country, naturally prey upon those creatures
for which they have a decided preference whenever the latter are
obtainable ; but in seasons of drought, when their favourite food is
scarce, they undoubtedly pursue and devour what they can get
provided that it is not utterly distasteful ; thus last year, when we
had an unusually long dry hot summer, I repeatedly saw the common
House-Sparrow chasing and devouring all three species of our
common white butterflies :--Ganoris brassicce, rapce, and napi, the
wings of which they snipped off before eating the bodies. That
many birds do eat butterflies in their wild state is proved by the
numbers sent home from abroad with triangular gaps cleanly
snipped out of their wings evidently by the beak of a pursuing
bird.
To assume that captive birds accept certain food which they
would never look at in an unconfined state is to beg the question : a
hungry bird would probably accept it eagerly, just as a hungry bird
would certainly examine a leaf-like butterfly or a stick-like cater-
pillar if it came across it while searching for insect food upon a tree
or shrub ; in cases of that kind the legs and perhaps the antennae of
the butterfly would be noticed and the short true legs or prolegs of
the caterpillar would probably attract attention : this would induce
the bird to test the character of the mimetic form with its beak and,
if palatable, it would undoubtedly be devoured : a study of living
birds in flight-cage and aviary enables us to be sure of this.
I have never known any captive bird to exhibit fear of what
are called warning colours in insects ; they sometimes ignore certain
startlingly coloured insects altogether and at other times they peck at
and either accept or reject them. It is true that anything very

bizarre in form and coloration renders those birds which are not
accustomed to it extremely cautious in their approach ; they stand
on tip-toe with neck lengthened, run round it in a circle, peck and
spring back ; if they actually feared it they would neither approach
nor peck. As for terrifying attitudes in caterpillars, I am certain
that no insectivorous animal pays the least attention to them, so if
the unfortunate creatures think that the assumption of the line of
beauty looks frightful they must be greatly deluded.
On the other hand, although insects which at one time are
rejected by birds sometimes become acceptable when subsequently
tried, it does not follow that a wild bird which had rejected an
insect that offended its taste would test its flavour a second or third
time and eventually develop a liking for it ; it is far more probable
that having once found it nauseous, it would subsequently ignore it
utterly. A confiding bird naturally tests, and either accepts or rejects
what its owner offers it, but it would not be likely to select what it
had already proved to lie unpleasing when other and palatable food
was to be obtained with equal ease.
If the larvee of any insect were entirely protected from all
insectivorous animals by form or colouring, they would undoubtedly
become so abundant as to be a scourge : if the larvae of Centra
and its allies were not eagerly accepted and devoured by the Titmice,
they might have become as great a nuisance, as the caterpillars of the
currant-moth Abraxas and its allies,which are generally rejected by
insectivorous animals ; but even A. grossulariata, which spiders will
not approach but cut out of their web as they often do wasps, is not
invariably refused by foreign birds in captivity, though for all we
know to the contrary it may generally be by birds in freedom.
Metallic colours seem to be attractive to birds and in an aviary
they never hesitate for a moment to chase and devour the most
metallic of our British moths ( Plus-ici chrysitis), nor do they hesitate
to peck, if they do not invariably devour, chrysalides of Vanessa
urticce with its metallic decorations.
Birds both wild and in aviaries are eager for spiders and devour
them in considerable numbers. I have seen a wild bird hover in
front of the web of Epeira diademata and pluck the little animal from
the middle of its home ; this in itself tends to prove that the mere

Evidence afforded by Captive Birds.
fact of partial confinement does not entirely obliterate a bird's
preferences in the matter of food.
There is a tendency in the minds of exclusively indoor Zoolo-
gists to decry the value of the work done by aviarists and curators of
Zoological Gardens : they assert that the animals observed being&apos;
more or less limited to a comparatively small area, do not behave as
they would in a wild state, and consequently all observations
recorded must he wholly untrustworthy. Do birds in an aviary
alter their entire method of nidification ? As a rule we know
that they do not ; and when they do, it is because reason shows them
that some other method is more advantageous under existing circum-
stances : indeed, as I have previously stated, centuries of cage life
have not obliterated from the minds of the Bengalee and Canary
the pattern of the nest which their remote ancestors used to build
when at liberty, and in an aviary containing shrubs these birds
construct their typical nests to-day.
Of course, in order to ascertain the favourite food of any wild
animal an examination of the stomachs of numerous free examples
is by far the better way ; but nevertheless a study of the evident
preferences shown in captivity is not altogether valueless. All
evidence should be accepted with caution, and the testimony of many
workers in various lands should be carefully studied and thought
over before any conclusions are come to, and it should always be
borne in mind that " Natura non facit saltum " is a rule rarely
broken and the development of so-called mimetic forms must have
been an exceedingly slow process, much more so than if insectivorous
animals actually cared a brass farthing what colour was presented to
them, or what attitude a caterpillar assumed when at rest or
startled. Brightly coloured caterpillars are generally severely pecked
even when subsequently rejected, so that their coloration does not
preserve life unless it puts birds upon their guard against interfering
with similarly coloured examples ; to some extent it may be so,
though I am inclined to think that smell is a more potent deterrent
than any arrangement of colours, and undoubtedly some brightly-
coloured caterpillars are rejected by certain birds, though not by all,
because they are hairy.; yet the perfect insects evolved from them

In fine, whatever bias we have, let us not jump to hasty con-
clusions, but calmly consider all evidence from every possible point of
view ; and, for our own sakes if for no other, never attribute to the

AVICULTURE.
By J. Lewis Bgnhote, M.A.
In the August number of Tropical Life there appeared an
article entitled " Economic Zoology--a Neglected Industry," which
dealt chiefly with the possibilities of farming the Egrets for the sake
of their plumes. As the subject is closely connected with Avi-
culture, we may perhaps be excused for bringing it to the notice of
our readers. With regard to the procuring of the plumes of wild
birds for the adornment of ladies' hats, certain facts are indis-
putable. Firstly, the trade involves the serious diminution or
extermination of many of the most beautiful species that nature
has evolved, and secondly, this destruction has been carried on in a
manner which involves no little cruelty to the innocent victims of
the appetite for adornment. To put a stop to these undoubted evils,,
societies and private individuals in various parts of the world have
attempted, and in some cases, succeeded in passing laws ensuring
absolute protection to the birds. This has led to serious dissatis-
faction among members of the Plume Trade and others interested
in this traffic, as well as from Agriculturists, who are finding their
crops ravaged by harmful and non-ornamental species.
It must be acknowledged that the laws, so far passed, have
had little or no effect in stopping the trade ; most species of birds
naturally shun the advance of civilisation and it is, as the pro-
tectionists themselves acknowledge, practically impossible to enforce
any laws in the remoter parts of the world.
Looking at the matter from the standpoint of a perfectly&apos;

Mr. J. Lewis Bonhote
unbiassed observer, have the protectionists any right to dictate to the
rest of the world what may or may not be killed ? Wild nature is
common property, and the non-protectionists have equal rights
with those whose pleasure is merely to watch nature or to enjoy a
satisfaction in knowing that it exists unharmed.
On the other hand, those whose business leads to the des-
truction of these beautiful creatures must remember that others
have rights as well as themselves, and that they are only entitled
to take the interest and not the capital, so that if they will not
restrain their hands from deliberate extermination, strong laws
must be passed against them. The cruelty aspect offers, of course,
no argument--civilisation sets its face against cruelty of any sort even
to the humblest of creatures, and while recognising the full rights of
man to take to his own use a percentage of Nature's abundance, the
trade would, we feel sure, be the first to put down any cruel methods,
were they approached in a reasonable and not in an aggressive spirit.
For every product of life Man is dependent on Nature, were
the Prohibition doctrine carried out to its logical conclusion, Man
would at once cease to exist and were this law "Thou shall not kill "
pushed still further, life of all kinds would cease except, perhaps, for
the lowest organisms which find their nutriment from the chemical
compounds in the earth and the rain.
This is the logical reductio ad absurdum of an entirely prohi-
bitive policy, and we must thus accept the inevitable Law of Nature
that Man has a right in common with all living things to take from
Nature what he can get.
Man, however, from Iris high brain development has the
power of storing, bartering and exchanging, so that his toll from
Nature is not directly limited, as in the case of other animals, by
his own immediate needs. It therefore becomes necessary for laws
to be passed to regulate the yearly toll which may be taken from
Nature so that future generations may still find food, adornment
or an aesthetic enjoyment.
As ages roll on, however, Man has enormously increased both
in numbers and in his needs for life -- the rough fare and primitive
clothing of savage tribes are not sufficient for civilised man and pari

passu with this increase, Man has encroached on Wild Nature
restricting her boundaries and reducing her numbers.
Such a state of affairs could not long&apos; exist, the toll taken from
Nature would eventually have become so small that Man himself
would have been in danger of starvation. The question was solved,
however, by the domestication of certain wild species. These being
under the entire control of Man were, in the first place, protected
from their natural enemies, and thus a larger surplus was available
for the needs of Man, who has also increased their fertility, and
ensured for himself an unlimited food supply.
In other cases, by the regulation of " close times," destruction
of natural enemies, etc., the nominal increase of many wild species
has been greatly augmented and turned to Man's advantage, without
to any appreciable extent interfering with the balance of Nature,
and even in the case of the plume trade we have the Ostrich, which
has undoubtedly been saved from extermination by domestication.
Surely, therefore, the only logical and fair method of dealing
with the Plumage Question in which, as we have tried to show, both
parties have rights, is by attempting to farm, either in a wild state
(as is done in the case of Plovers, Partridges, Foxes, etc.) or in a
state of domestication (as is done with Ostriches, Peafowl, etc.)
those species whose plumes are the most valuable and to regulate the
destruction and sale of other species with whom the above methods
are not practical.
Why has this method, so universal with other animals and
plants, not been attempted ? There are two main reasons. Firstly
the world is wide, birds are numerous and a large toll can be exacted
for many years before the result of that suicidal destruction becomes
obvious, more especially as it is taking place in the remoter parts of
the worid. Secondly, to "farm " any species successfully it must be
carefully studied, both in its wild state as well as in confinement, and
hitherto no attempt has been made or money forthcoming to enable
such an enquiry to be undertaken with even a single species. A
French firm has made a beginning by offering a prize of #400 for
the first Osprey (Egret) farm established on French territory, but a sum
much greater than that would be required to carry out the necessary
observations and then stock a farm with any chance of success.

The Plumage Question and Aviculture.
That the matter is possible we do not doubt for a single instant.
Under favourable conditions Egrets can be bred in confinement, and
the taking&apos; of plumes from captive birds is an easy matter. Unfor-
tunately they are large eaters, feeding on fish and other aquatic
aaimals, so that their keep would he an expensive matter, yet in
a suitable environment it should not be impossible to farm them
on an economic basis.
Birds of Paradise offer, perhaps, a more difficult problem, but
we now know, through Aviculture, that they are fairly hardy in
confinement and Sir Wm. Ingram has shown us that they will thrive
wild in other quarters of the Globe, where they could be much more
easily farmed and protected than in their native haunts, so that if
due attention was bestowed on them their case need be by no means
hopeless.
We must bear in mind that the destruction of these birds is,
as matters stand at present, only a matter of time and that then the
profit from much of the Plume Trade is gone. Can we not appeal to
the Trade before it is too late, to carry out a thorough investigation
on these lines which, we feel sure, would in the future repay them
a thousand-fold, and thus do away with these futile attempts at
legislation and counter legislation which entirely fail to reach the
root of the matter.
Here is also a chance for Aviculture to show its practical use
and at the same time to keep the trade open for its own necessities.
Prohibitive legislation is already beginning in certain countries, e.g.
America and Prance, to suck at Avicultural life blood, putting back
the progress of science and denying to many the pleasure and know-
ledge to be derived from the keeping of the birds, to which also plume
wearers and bird keepers have equal, hut not greater, rights than the
most rabid of protectionists.
Let us, therefore, honestly attempt to solve this question by
the method that has hitherto been applied successfully to other
cognate cases and in a manner fair and satisfactory to plume lovers,
the trade, the protectionists, and lastly, but by no means least, to
those species which we are morally bound to leave in undiminished
numbers for the enjoyment of future generations.

first made its appearance in 1909, when a notice of it appeared in
this journal ( Vol. VI., second series, page 313). So well has it been
received that now a third edition, which has been brought up to date
and enlarged, has appeared. The subject is so fascinating and the
results of the methods described so encouraging that all who are
interested in our wild birds would do well to read it carefully.

SIR,--I think I ought to let you know a success which ended with a
disappointment with my Hooded Parrakeets (Psephotus cucullatus).
I had kept two pairs of these beautiful birds several years without any
signs of nesting becoming apparent. One pair lived several years during the
summer in a large aviary in which there is a large hawthorn tree.
In spring, when the tree was full of white flowers, the beautiful blue,
yellow, black and green birds made a delightful show. But here the joy ended.
They lived mostly hidden in the thick foliage and the only thing they did was to
disturb the nests of the little Picui Doves that live in the same aviary.
Last spring I thought I would give the Picui Doves a change of nesting with
success, and put the parrakeets in another aviary in which there was an enclosed
part with glass in front. In this closed part a nesting box was put. During
spring and summer the birds lived their usual retired life, but in September they
began to get very lively, flying about restlessly. Towards the 15th of the month
the female was found to be wanting. The nesting box was examined and there
she was found sitting on four eggs.
Towards the end of October the young ones could be heard and hopes of
a success was high. The cold wet weather became worse and worse and about

the end of October it was discovered that the old birds did no longer go into the
nesting box. The box was examined and five beautiful young birds were found
dead in it. They had their crops full of food so that it must have been the cold
that killed them. The feathers were just beginning to grow.

By Frank Finn, B.A., F.Z.S.
(Concluded from page 43).
From the point of view of a very large proportion of avicul-
turists who must perforce be content with small accommodation, the
most desirable group of the Picarians or non-passerine perchers is
the family of Humming-birds ; while hardly any family surpasses
them in intrinsic interest, owing to their tiny size in so many cases,
their frequently wmnderful colours, and their pre-eminent adaptation
to flight. This would at first seem to put them out of court for most
aviculturists, but the fact is, that their speciality in flight is rather
active evolutions in a small space than remaining long on the wing,
which they do not do, according to those who have observed them
wild. This facility in circumscribed flight could have been studied
with great advantage in the case of a pair of Prevost's Hummer
{Lampornis prevosti), which, alone out of a consignment of eighteen
humming-birds of different species, succeeded in surviving a month
at the Zoo in 1908. The male, indeed, lived five weeks -- I remember
this well, because I promised the keeper a shilling for every bird he
kept over the month, and much regretted I had only this individual
to pay for. He also grew a tail during his captivity here, showing
that he was not nearly " on his last legs " constitutionally. In fact,
as only three of this species were in the consignment it is pretty
obvious that Prevost's Hummer is fairly hardy as Hummers go, and
I should recommend anyone who has access to Venezuela to

specialize on this species if he wants to get Humming-birds oyer
alive.
It must be remembered in keeping Hummers that they have
very little use of their feet except as grasping organs ; I never saw
any of the Zoo specimens try to walk or hop if they found them-
selves on the ground, and even in moving along their perch they
whizz the wings. Newly-imported specimens, therefore, should have
their perches so arranged that they can sidle along them to get at
the food and water--for they drink freely though living on syrup.
Once they are well-established and flying strongly the fewer perches
the better. Of course these should be often cleaned, as the birds
have a curious trick of grasping their long thin bills with their feet
and wiping them down, any stickiness thereby accruing being promptly
transferred to the perch, of course. For bathing the Prevosts' pre-
ferred a large leaf which had been sprayed on--no doubt a natural
habit--but would also use a pan with a piece of moss in it. The cock
took no notice of the hen except to pull her off the wet leaf by the
scruff of the neck when he wanted a bath, and they kept as far apart
as possible, so that solitary confinement would seem to be no hardship
for a Humming-bird. A very high temperature is necessary, at any
rate for newly-imported birds, as they become torpid like reptiles or
very young nestlings if the temperature falls too low. This, how-
ever, seems to do them no harm ; a female Kuby-and-Topaz Hummer
(Chrysolampis moschitus ) in this consignment, arriving torpid, was
placed on the hot water pipes for resuscitation, revived suddenly,
flew all over the house for a long time without striking the glass,
fell down on a Marmosets' cage, was rescued from the clutches of
a Marmoset which had grabbed its head, and about a quarter of
an hour later was hovering in its glass-sided case, apparently trying
to peep into the lens of a camera which was being operated in front !
Surely so robust a minikin ought to have lived longer than it did ;
the tameness it showed was characteristic of the group, which excel
in this lovable and desirable peculiarity.
Provided they can be kept warm and clean (a most important
point), the chief difficulty with these birds is evidently the provision
of suitable food ; but as this has been got over with the Sunbirds
{Nectarinzidce ), which belong to an entirely different group, being

true Passerines, we need not despair of seeing Humming-birds also
more commonly and successfully kept sooner or later. It is true
that Sunbirds bop about in the normal way, and are not quite so
sensitive to cold, apparently, but that they were not easy to begin
with the following experiences of mine may show.
In 1897, I started from Calcutta with twelve Amethyst-
rumped Sunbirds (Arachnechthra zeylonica), a selected lot -- for to
avoid useless waste of life I had liberated at least as many, which did
not look like doing well--and one Purple (A. asiatica), the only one
I -could get, and in moult at that. Although I arrived home about
midsummer, all the Amethysts died cn route --the last in the train
going up to London--evidently from cold ; the one Purple reached
the Zoo, and lived there about a fortnight only, though treated with
every care by that excellent former keeper of the Insect-House,
Quan trill.
So far as I know, these were the first Sunbirds to reach Eng-
land, or Europe for that matter; and had I argued as some people
do about Humming-birds, I should have said that Sunbirds were not
worth trying with again.
The subsequent experiences of others, especially of Mr. A.
Ezra, have shown, however, that even the delicate Amethyst can be
shown and moulted successfully; while the Purple, which has
confirmed my scanty experience by proving much the hardier, can
not only be so treated, but has been kept by a dealer (Mr. J. D.
Plamlyn) in numbers in a store-cage in a sitting-room for nearly a
year--a good record for a soft-bill of any sort.
So that, as on the evidence Prevost's Hummer should be even
hardier than the Purple Sunbird, to say nothing of the other, there
is nothing to despair about, and when this species is fully understood
we can proceed to others with more confidence.
I fed my Sunbirds on diluted condensed milk mixed with
crushed biscuit and powdered hard-boiled egg-yolk, but in the light
of the subsequent experience of others, I should recommend a
mixture of honey, condensed milk, and Mellin's food, to be given in
a shallow covered vessel with holes in the cover ; and this ought to
serve for Humming-birds also. Aphides and spiders should of course
be provided wherever possible, though I cannot say that the Zoo

Humming-birds specimens cared much for those given to them--
they may have become inveterate syrup-bibbers !
The unidentified Humming-bird imported by Mr. C. Harris in
the autumn of 1910, however, was actually reared on honey from
the nest, and anyone who reads Gosse's account in the Birds of
Jamaica of his rather blundering attempt to keep the splendid
Aithurus polytmus of that island on syrup only will see that that
species has a resistent constitution, and would probably do well with
better food and more careful treatment. Sunlight, judging from my
observations on the Zoo birds, is not indispensible to Hummers, and
is even shunned by some when wild, such as the magnificent Crimson
Topaz ( Topazct pella) of Tropical America, which haunts the forest
shades, while some species, such as Selasphorus rufus in North-west
America, and Eustephanus galeritus in Tierra del Fuego, range into
climates far more cold and bleak than any inhabited by Sunbirds.
To pass to very different groups of birds, in dealing&apos; with my
especial favourites the Waterfowl, I have also followed as a rule the
possibility of avoiding familiar types for export, the chief exception
I made being in favour of the Pigmy Goose or Cotton-teal ( Nettapus
coromandelicmus) above mentioned ; the difficulties in keeping this
bird I have dealt with previously {Avic. Mag., VII. 1901, p. 129); I may
summarize them here by saying that they consist simply in the fact
that the bird is very groggy on its legs and at the same time foolishly
eager to climb up wire-netting, so that its enclosure on first capture
if small, must be arranged to obviate this. Cotton-teal should always
have plenty of water and be kept under netting, unpinioned, as they
fly cleverly and perch freely ; they are delightfully tame, a rare
virtue among the smaller ducks. They feed on the ordinary duck
foods.
The same difficulty about land locomotion besets him who
would keep the delightful family of Grebes ; they are very bad on
their legs, especially the larger species, but fortunately do not try to
climb. Their plumage very soon loses the water-resisting power if
they are kept out of water, so that they must be accustomed to it by
degrees. When hardened off, they should be allowed only small
landing-places -- say about a yard square -- at each end of their water-
space, or as an island in the middle. The rest of the edges of the

pond should be wired, and if the water can be given a serpentine
form, so as to ensure as much swimming exercise as possible, it will
be all the better.
I have always fed Grebes on fish, adding insects for Dab-
chicks, but I have seen the Great Crested Grebe recently kept in the
Wader's aviary at the Zoo taking meat on shore, and even robbing
the Waders when they took a hit to the water to wash it. As
Grebes also take vegetable food, rice and chopped lettuce might well
be offered with advantage. An aviary is not a suitable place for
them, as they require water-range above everything, and cannot rise
on the wing in a small space, so they may as well he clipped or
pinioned, except in the case of Dabchicks when on water that is not
running and so liable to freeze. Divers and Auks could no doubt be
kept in the same way.
Among Waders, I took particular interest in the curious
Jaganas {Parridee), though my fondness for especially beautiful
birds led me to specialize in the Pheasant-tailed species {Hydro-
phasis chirurgus), albeit this is the least typical of its family, being
more Plover-like than the rest.
These I found lived well on boiled rice mixed with chopped
raw fish or hard-boiled egg, but soon became dry and cracked about
the hocks if kept long away from a pond, for they did not seem to
have the sense to make much use of a mere shallow tray of water.
In nature they keep mostly on floating vegetation, swimming occa-
sionally but not often enough to keep their legs wet, so that this
peculiarity of the skin puzzles me. It indicates, however, that their
legs should be frequently wetted with fresh water in a travelling cage,
either by spraying or sluicing, or better by immersing the bottom of
the cage in a bath whenever possible. When established they should
be kept where they must wet their legs to get food, and ought to be
taken indoors in winter ; I fancy, however, that if the lot I sent to
the Zoo for the first time in 1901 had been kept in the excellent little
aviary in the Fish House instead of in the Western Aviary, they might
have lived longer. Combining the grace of the Crane with the size oJ
a Collared Dove, they are beautiful even in winter plumage, and in the
long-tailed summer garb so exquisite that they make the daintiest
ducks look coarse in comparison. Their huge long-toed feet do not

look ungraceful as the birds stand on the weeds, or even on the
ground: but one point is to be noted about these feet, that the long&apos;
hind-toe is very weak and easily gets bent forward permanently. While
the birds thus affected still walk well, I always turned loose on the
Calcutta Museum tank all that went that way, along with other
weaklings, some of which did well and stayed even when not clipped.
Thus I was able to see them feeding : they ate chiefly water-snails,
turning over the leaves to get them, but would take paddy-rice
thrown in. Water-snails, by the way, are appreciated by a large
variety of water-birds; among my own specimens, I saw them
regularly eaten by ducks, both surface-feeders and divers, flamingoes,
and coots. They also come in handy for land-birds, and being so
easily collected and kept, should not be neglected by aviculturists.
To return to Jacanas; I found them, though peaceful in con-
fined quarters, rather unsociable on the tank, the large strong hens
especially keeping their " worse halves" aloof. In an aviary with
other water-birds they should do well, but if no water-plants are
in the pool some artificial floating leaves of thin wood should be
provided to make them feel more at home, as they are really " lily-
trotters," not mud-larks or beach-combers like other waders.
I will add, in conclusion, a few notes on another out-of-the-
way wader I was the first to introduce--a Pratincole -- though the
general management of these does not differ to any important extent
from that of small waders generally as laid down by Mr. Barnby
Smith in this series, because it just shows how one may pick up a
good bird casually. It was when I was on the East African coast
twenty years ago, and out with Mr. Macalister of Mombasa, in
whose name I presented the bird to the Zoo. He shot and winged
it, breaking the fore-arm, and we took it home alive. I cut off the
broken part of the wing, placed it in a rough box-cage and fed it on
grasshoppers, but it soon left off feeding, so I had to cram it for
some days, but ultimately got it on to eating raw meat by itself on
board ship, and it reached the Zoo safely to thrive in Quantrill's
care. It was the Madagascar Pratincole (Glareola ocularis) not
previously known from Africa.
I may mention that, opportunities having been lacking, I had
never kept anything more difficult than a blackbird before this trip,

but I brought home, in addition to this Pratincole, a Green-necked
Touracou ( Gcdlirex chlorochlamys) , a Fruit-pigeon ( Treron dela-
landii), three Black Gallinules ( Limnocorax niger), a Crow-
pheasant {Centropms superciliosus) , presented by various donors, all
new to the Zoo, besides other live-stock, although I was sent to
collect earthworms, and of course got them too, both pickled and
living.
I feel that this finale, and this article generally, has a rather
egotistical vein running through it, but I hope this may be pardoned
in consideration of my idea of writing thus, which has been to show
that the keeping of out-of-the-way birds chiefly depends on the wish
to keep them, and that if one will only give one's mind to it, the
pioneer work of aviculture, though difficult, is not absolutely heart-
breaking.

PARRAKEET.
Psephotus cucullatus.
By Hubert D. Astley, F.Z.S., M.B.O.H., etc.
I think the fact was recorded that last winter my pair of
Golden-shouldered Hooded Parrakeets nested twice, in November
and December, but although there were young in the eggs, at any
rate in the second clutch, they failed to hatch. These happenings
took place in a bird-room.
This summer I turned this beautiful pair of what are almost
the loveliest of their family into a large outdoor aviary, but true to
their wild habits, they refused to nest until October, when in their
native country (Northern Australia) their springtime would be
flourishing.
On my return from Italy on the 20th of October, where I
had been for two months, my bird-keeper told me that he was sure
that the female Hooded Parrakeet was sitting in a long log, laid
horizontally on some cross-beams under the lean-to roof of the open
part of the aviary, about ten feet up. The log in which this interest-
ing event took place is almost six feet long, and hollow from one end
to the other, a regular tunnel with a flooring of dry and decayed
wood.
After my return home, I began to wonder whether, after all,
things had not ended unsatisfactorily, for the female was constantly
off the nest, but my hopes revived when she w T as also often to be
seen entering the log from time to time, and better still, to be passing

Breeding of the Hooded Parraiceet.
the night there. Then on another occasion the male also went in,
remaining for a few minutes. Nothing coulcl be heard in the way
of nestlings being fed, as is the case with many of the parrakeets.
At last I felt I really must remove suspense and look, which
I did at the end of October, after I had been home ten days. I
mounted a ladder. All was darkness and silence, with a strong
odour of mice within. Silhoutted against the light which came
through from the far end I could just make out two small round
heads moving about. " Mice ! " I thought, " how disgusting !" But
still the old birds continued to go in and out of the log.
On the 15th of "November, armed with a portable electric
bull's eye lantern, again I mounted the ladder, flashed the light down
the tunnel, and there to my huge delight and astonishment, in the
very centre of the log were seated four most beautiful young Hooded
Parrakeets, almost ready to fly, whilst nearer to me lay the skeleton
of a fifth, which must have lived for at any rate a fortnight, for it
had feathers on its wings.
To have seen in ths same aviary within six months, young
" Queen Alexandras " and young Hooded Golden-shoulders was
almost more than one's feelings could endure; my bird-keeper and
I refrained from sobbing on each other's necks from an overflow of
joy, but it required self-control!
I managed to sleep that night, but on the following morning I
began to see visions of the nestlings issuing from the log and dashing
wildly against the wire-meshing, besides which the weather was--
well ! what the weather is liable to be in England in the middle of
November -- and here were birds that ought to have been hatched in
the tropics of Australia.
Consequently, on the 16th, I again mounted the ladder, and
although it took us a long time, the bird keeper and I managed to urge
the young&apos;-parrakeets, by means of a long cane to leave their dark
and happy home. Two flew out and two flopped out, and one
immediately dashed hard against the wire, but luckily did not damage
itself. The father of the family flew down in a great state of mind,
and both parents called loudly. Finally the whole family was put
into a small inner aviary, where it is warm, and where risk of injury
is almost nil.

The young birds resemble the female, except that the cere
and bills are bright orange-yellow, and the young males can evidently
be distinguished by a brighter wash of verdigris green on the under-
parts and perhaps a greyer colour on the forehead. When I handled
them, they were all as plump as partridges, and had their crops well
filled.
The parents, besides having a daily supply of biscuit sop, and
when there was no frost, chickweed and shepherd's purse, have
throughout greedily devoured fresh gentles, and to this latter food
can probably be attributed this great success. I believe that these
rare and most lovely parrakeets have never been bred in England
before.
By the 8th of December the young birds could all feed
independently.

RICE BIRDS.
By Katharine Currey.

Some of the funniest birds I have ever kept were the little
Bengalese Rice Birds, black-and-white, and yellow-and-white. I
had three pairs in a large cage, living very sociably together, with
plenty of moss and earth and grass in their cage, and in the middle a
good sized shallow bath. They ate rice, and seed, and dabbled in
the wet moss all day long, dragging it into their bath before bathing
in the water, and chatting incessantly, only one refrain, exactly like
the words Diddle-diddle-dee ! " repeated very fast and loud, and
in a high key, while they stood on tiptoe, with their necks stretched
out, looking very much astonished. When the sun set they all
huddled together in the sheltered end of the cage, mounted on each
other, and forming a pyramid. When one of those underneath had
had enough of it, he crept out, and down fell the whole erection,
amid screaming and chattering. But they soon remade the pyramid,
the one who had been underneath now perching on the top--to cool,
and the one who had been on the top glad to creep beneath for
warmth. As the weather was warm, I supposed it was their way of
roosting, and the destruction and rebuilding of the pyramid might
have gone on ad infinitum had not a wiser bird friend told me the

poor little things wanted a cocoanut-shell to sleep in. As soon as I
hung one high up in the cage all six hurried to it and crowded in,
chattering, doubtless with joy, but the song never varied. Out and
in they popped, standing on the perches and boughs to chatter their
diddle-diddle-dees," till the daylight waned, when they all made
for the opening together, pushing and jostling and squeaking. They
soon settled to sleep, after a few drowsy " diddle, diddles," ending
up with a long drawn-out 11 dee-e-e."
After a time I tapped softly on tire back of the cocoanut to
see what would happen. Out popped the little heads, one above the
other, to see who was there, looking uncommonly like a crowd of
little old gentlemen with night caps on. Then they all withdrew
inside again, only an occasional " Peet " revealing the discomfort of
one of them, probably trodden on or squeezed by the others.
A pair of St. Helena Waxbills lived in their cage with them
for a time and, until the arrival of the cocoanut, were tolerated by
the Rice Birds. The Waxbills roosted on a bough like respectable
birds and gazed with surprise at the pyramid below them. When
the cocoanut appeared on the scene the Waxbills were not allowed
to go near it. If one of them ventured to roost on it, or even near
it, out would come a Rice Bird, and uttering angry little shrieks,
chase it away, and return grumbling to the cocoanut. Two of the
Rice Birds laid eggs in the same nesting box, in which they made a
tidy little soft nest, but as the whole party sat on them together the
eggs did not long remain whole. They then chattered on tip-toe
more than ever, one in particular never ceasing the whole day long :
indeed he was such a nuisance that I wondered the others put up
with his garrulity.
I found a great objection to keeping Rice Birds was the
strong and most unpleasant odour about their cage, in spite of its
being kept scrupulously clean and the moss perpetually renewed.
Their ceaseless repetition too of their one refrain from morning till
night was wearisome in the extreme, and I was not sorry when a
friend with a collection of little finches took them. Their conceit
and self-assertion was most ludicrous, and though they were
perfectly tame--I do not suppose it ever would have struck them to
be otherwise -- I could never have made friends with them.

NUTHATCHES.
Citta Ccesia.
By Katharine Currey.
If a Nuthatch (or pair of them) is kept in confinement it
should have a large cage to dart about in, and logs of wood, apple or
elder in preference, to hammer its nuts into. In any but a large
enclosure it stands the risk of concussion of the brain, when darting
and dashing about with the lightning&apos; rapidity of its movements.
The Nuthatch is extremely intelligent and easily tamed, but it never
loses its darting habits. I have often wondered, while watching a
Nuthatch hammering at a nut in a hole or cleft, why its long beak
never splits, but at the tip the hill curves slightly up--no doubt to
protect it.
The protective colouring of the Nuthatch conceals it com-
pletely in autumn, as it hangs upon an old lichen-grown apple tree,
the grey of the stem, and deep brown of the wet leaves, or inside of
the bark where a bit is peeled off, harmonizing exactly with the
colours of the little bird. All the Nuthatches I have kept, except
one pair, I have let loose in spring after having studied them and
their ways. They lived in the orchard (and probably are still there)
in company with a pair of Redwings which, after keeping a year, I
let loose. The Redwings stayed and nested and sang as we passed
beneath the trees where they were. The pair of Nuthatches which
formed the exception to those I let fly, I kept in an aviary where
there were Doves, and where they had plenty of logs and stems to
hammer in. While watching them I used often to think the Doves
were worried and angry with the incessant darting about, hut I never
anticipated the fate that awaited the little Nuthatches. One day
both lay dead, stabbed in the hack by -- ivhat ! I fear by none other
than the fierce beaks of the gentle Doves ! I rescued one little
Nuthatch once from a cruel fate at a dealers. It had almost dashed
itself to death in the tiny prison it was in. However, it revived in a
large cage with fresh apple branches and fir logs in it, and plenty of
earth and a bath. " Nutty " became very tame and ate out of our
hands and soon grew very handsome. In his cage was an old elder
stem, with a hole going right through it. This I stood up on end,

and " Nutty " roosted on it, hanging to the bark ; then when the
nights grew cold lie crept inside and roosted there. Suddenly he
ceased going into his hole and took to roosting on the top of the log,
and nothing would induce him to enter. When I tried to urge him in
he would look fixedly at me out of his dark brown eyes as if to answer
" How can I ? Don t you see I can't go in?" Next morning I
took out the elder stem and out popped a mouse ! " Nutty " was
then let out into a lawn aviary to "rootle" about in every day,
and one afternoon a fine hen Nuthatch came and tried to get in.
Every day she came during the winter, and after a time he became
so restless and looked out for the hen to come that I let him out.
She was waiting near on a walnut tree bough, and off they flew
together, no doubt to build and nest in the garden.

<bodyText confidence="0.9857392" page_id="32654902"  page_num="Page 78" year="" vol="">
By C. Barney Smith.
It has been my good fortune during the past season to see
many rare and interesting birds at the Zoo and elsewhere, but there
stands out in my memory one sight above all others--a little bird,
the most insignificant and the most interesting of all. This bird was
a wilful little Phalarope chick.
It came to pass that last June I was able to lift myself out of
the ruts of civilization, and, journeying, northward, I arrived after
some nine days travel at my farthest point, a land of fire and
water--a place on the edge of a large lake where many birds
abound. A more weird or more picturesque spot in its way it would
be difficult to imagine. On the border of the lake, for miles in one
direction, extended miniature craters of volcanoes, perfect in form --
some of them not more than a few yards in diameter and many of
them blackened as though only a few weeks old. Beyond these was
a region of grey lava where the surface of the ground was contorted
and twisted into fantastic shapes, forming in some places huge
tunnels with rounded roofs and in others pillars with intervening
cracks of unknown depths.
On the other side the lake were ridges showing yellow and

red in the northern light, and behind these, blue-black mountains
streaked with gold in the long gullies and behind the snowy peaks.
The region of grey lava was frequented by Ptarmigan. Only
those who have tried to see cock Ptarmigan on grey lava can realise
how perfectly their plumage hides them--the white and grey
feathers harmonizing completely with the light and shade on the
rocks. At intervals between the rocks were patches covered with
dwarf scrub frequented by Whimbrel, Golden Plover and
Dunlins.
The lake itself and a region about the margin having been
declared a protected area the result was that in July there were
hundreds of acres of water dotted over with ducks of seemingly
endless variety. The repeated cries of the male Long Tails practi-
cally drowned all other sounds at times, though occasionally Divers
and Wild Geese passing over could be heard. The Arctic Tern more-
over were not distinguished for reticence.
Amongst the duck on the lake I was interested to see several
broods of Sclavonian Grebe -- the birds being fairly tame and
permitting a good view.
The Great Northern Diver nests freely not far from here and
earlier in the season I got over eight fresh eggs and presented them
to the Zoo, in the hopes that they would hatch and make a pleasing
addition to the Penguin's enclosure, but alas ! no good result was
obtained in spite of every care. Probably the eggs were too much
shaken in transit to England as the journey is necessarily rough and
lengthy.
I was told that in a place a very long day's journey distant
from the lake and near the edge of the desert (where men seldom go
in the spring) Wild Geese had for the past two seasons been found
nesting and that an expedition to the spot last spring resulted in
bringing back 200 of their eggs--the number being only limited by
the carrying capacity of the ponies. It seemed a shame to take all
these eggs until one learned they were for necessary human food.
At one end of the lake is an enormous marsh where fire and
water seem to meet, that is where the lava is half submerged and
there are endless little pools of water (from 10 feet in diameter
upwards) surrounded by rushes and rough grass. Here was the

place for Red-necked Phalaropes, and here were the nests and young
ones in abundance. The old birds were so plentiful it was difficult
to distinguish the different pairs as, although quite tame, they
were continuously flying&apos; quickly from place to place and getting
hopelessly mixed. However, having inspected several nests with
eggs I sat down to watch a little brood of four chicks which the old
cock bird was looking after amongst the long grass on the edge of a
pool. It was a sight I shall not readily forget, to see the care of the
old bird for the chicks which were evidently only a few days old.
The one precocious chick that so excited my interest would insist on
sailing out into open water far from land, when the old bird, after
calling him with repeated cries without result, swam quickly after
him and getting on the outside (farthest from the land) kept pecking
him vigorously on the head until he got him to land, and then the
old bird stood on the grass (within a few feet of me) and kept
spreading his wings and calling loudly for the chick to come to be
brooded which, after some demur, it did, and so remained for quite a
long time.
This was my best bird-view of the past season. To those who
have not seen Phalarope chicks it may seem trivial, but not, I think,
to those who have and who, like myself, " take off their shoes."
AFRA DOVES.
Ghalcopelia cifra.
By Katharine Currey.
The lovely little Afra Doves are charming pets, but they
should live in a flock, not in isolated pairs, for they are very sociable
and never seem to wish to fight. A pair I had were restless, as all
gregarious birds are when alone, but as soon as I let other Afras into
the aviary they settled down, and now generally sit together on one
perch, a row of them. Before their present aviary was constructed
I had them altogether in a large cage, letting them out into a lawn
enclosure to fly about during the day. They knew very soon what
they had to do at sunset, and one by one came down from the
branches and hopped into the cage to be taken in, out of the way of

noctural enemies. Occasionally one got out, and after a flight round
the garden, came to he let in again.
Their note is strangely mournful, a sort of reproachful moan,
ending in three little notes like a toy trumpet: " Too-tu-too ! Too-
tu-too ! Too-tu-too ! "
I have never seen my Af&apos;ras hathe, and they drink very seldom.
They love basking in the sun, hut will stand almost any weather
provided they have a shelter to retire to, out of any draught or cold
wind. I find it difficult to identify a pair, as the sexes are alike, and
they are too sociable for ' aloofness.' Their beauty tempted me to
buy the first pair I had, for they are some of the loveliest of the
doves, with their soft mouse-grey backs and wings, the latter having
metallic spots on the top, and a rich chestnut brown underneath,
visible when in flight. Their heads &apos;are ashen blue, the eyes large
and dark brown, and the white breast has a faint rose blush on it.
Last summer I received a pair of little Ruddy Turtles, also
beautiful birds ; the cock rose-red, with a light blue head and black
ring round the neck ; the hen a soft grey-brown, with a black neck-
ring also. They and the Afras live most harmoniously together in a
new rustic aviary I have just had constructed, and which I find quite
satisfactory. It is made in two pieces, each half easily carried by a
man and a boy, and fastened together, so as to defy rats, at the top
of the gable, which is 6ft. 6in. high. The aviary is made of larch
poles with the bark left on, and half-inch wire-netting, the latter
carried on to form a rat-proof floor, sunk six inches into the ground
and filled in with earth and gravel and turf. The aviary is 6ft. 6in.
wide (facing the gable) and oft. 4in. deep. The roof on the north
side is partially covered by boarding over the wire, and a moveable
shelf runs along the whole width, with nesting baskets. They could
also nest in a fir-tree in the cage, or among the branches which form
their perches. The cage faces South. Sheets of zinc laid on half
way along the wire roof protect from bad weather. The earth must
be raked over every other day and the perches cleaned, a very simple
matter.
I am curious to learn how long the little party will be able to
stay out of doors ; they have weathered nine degrees of frost and were
none the worse for it, but as I write we are not yet quite in winter.

Anas boscas and Gairina moschata.
By Frank Finn, B.A., F.Z.S.
Although both of them are ancestors of mere poultry-birds,
the Mallard of our common domestic ducks, and the Muscovy of
those kept over a large part of the Tropics, especially in Tropical
Africa and America, they may perhaps be allowed to form the
subject of the present article, inasmuch as the Mallards dealt with
are those kept as more or less ornamental birds, and the Muscovy
is in Europe and India, and probably elsewhere, chiefly kept as a
curiosity, and not for poultry purposes as in many hot countries.
In looking over the mallards kept in our London parks, it will
he noticed that many of the drakes vary from the typical form with
white collar, chocolate breast, and grey flanks, in two directions--in
one case the white collar remains, but the reddish-brown of the
breast is continued along the flanks and sometimes on to the
shoulders, while the upper parts are of a paler grey, often nearly
white ; in the other the white collar disappears, and the pencilled-
grey of the flanks invades the breast, to the complete exclusion of
the chocolate tint, reaching up to the green of the neck.
Both varietal forms are usually definite, but there is a little
inter-gradation with the type ; the chocolate may extend only a
little beyond the breast, or conversely may appear at the base of the
neck in an otherwise grey-breasted bird.
M. G. Bogeron, in his most excellent work " Les Canards,"
p. 140, has cited a case which shows that there is a definite form of
female correlated with the grey-breasted drake ; he having hatched,
from mallard ducks of a wild origin, some black ducklings --
regular little niggers "vrais petits negrillons," he calls them--
lie expected to rear from them a black variety, but found that when
they came into full feather, the drakes were of the grey-breasted
form above noted, while the ducks differed from the normal mottled-
brown type in having the head uniformly speckled, without the
light eyebrows and cheek-stripes to be seen in the normal mallard
female. The speculum or wing-bar in both sexes of this variety was

dull black instead of blue as in the type. Such ducks may be often
observed, but until M. Rog&apos;eron's observations were made there was
nothing to connect this slight variation with the markedly distinct
drakes and ducklings. He mentions, by the way, that the ducks of
this strain, whether normal or of the variety above described, have
always continued, though mated to unrelated drakes, to produce both
types (about equally divided in number) in their broods, except in
the case of one which, mated to a Pintail (Dafila acuta) drake,
produced no black young, though her previous broods had always
shown some.
This set me wondering as to what may he the female cor-
related with the drake showing an excess of red-brown, extending on
to the flanks, and this I have not yet found out. But I have this
year carefully watched some red-sided drakes in Regent&apos;s Park on
their assumption of undress, and have found that when in this stage
they are lighter in tint than normal drakes in undress, redder on the
breast, and whiter on the throat and sides, with the dark markings
more in the form of simple spots than of pencilling ; in other words,
they correspond rather closely to the abnormally light females one
often sees in park and farmyard ducks.
Moreover, this year, six ducklings were hatched in the
London Zoo from eggs laid by the female of a pair of mallard-
coloured park ducks which visited and nested in the Gardens. Three
of these were of the usual mallard colour in the down--black above
and yellow below and on the cheeks -- the other three were yellow
with a dash of black on crown and back. Of course I expected
these last to fledge off white, or at least heavily pied, in the style of
the Indian Runner, whose markings also occur as a spontaneous
variation. But to my astonishment they grew up simply pale-brown
ducks with dark markings and whitish throats--the light form above
alluded to, in fact. It was also noticeable by the way, that they
grew and fledged much quicker than the normal ducklings, which
developed the usual mallard plumage as one would expect.
Is it possible, then, that the red-flanked, pale-backed drake is
the correlative of the ochreous, white-throated duck, and that both
are yellow when young ? If so, we have two variations constantly
cropping up in the mallard under our protection , one tending towards

Mr. Frank Finn,
melanism, the other towards albinism, yet never actually getting a
white or black plumage, and looking much like true species. Pro-
bably under human selection they would breed true, hut the females
seem to exercise no choice, the red-flanked or grey-breasted drakes
finding favour equally with the typical form of the species.
The type form of the Muscovy duck is not so well known as
that of the Mallard, the species being a bird of the warm parts of
America, so I may here mention that the true colour is black richly
glossed with green or purple according to the part of the plumage,
with the wing-coverts, upper and under, pure white. The drake has
the naked skin of the face black (except along the eyebrows, wdiere
it is red) and smooth, not carunculated, and the caruncle above the
base of the bill very small ; the duck has no bare skin about the face
and no caruncle at all, but entirely resembles the drake in plumage.
The immature birds have the forehead, cheeks, and under-
parts frosted with white edgings to the feathers, and this is lost by
a moult, and the facial bare patch gained, before the white wing-
patch is developed, i.e. by the end of the first year, judging from the
development of wild-coloured domestic specimens. In such, the
denudation of the skin round the eye is preceded by a growth of
white feathers in that part, seeming to show that having white
feathers on a part is next to having none at all there -- a fact which
may have wide significance. In the domestic female the face is
usually bare as in the male, but always red, whereas in the male it
is sometimes nearly all black as in the wild form.
The ducklings of typically-coloured tame Muscovys are like
young mallard, i.e. black above and yellow on the cheeks and below,
and in fact, only differ from them noticeably in having the " nail &amp;quot;
at the end of the beak red and the tail longer.
I will now detail the results of crossing a wild male Muscovy,
received at the Zoo in 1908, and still living, with tame females.
His first mate was of a variety common in the domestic race--
which generally, by the way, shows more white than the wild type
-- she had a white head, red eye-patch, dark eyes, and dull yellow
feet, the rest of the colouring being normal. Her ducklings all
showed some white speckling on the head, and were very free flyers
and perched readily in trees, that being the habit of the wild race --

i
the tame bird's ambitions do not usually go beyond sitting on the
fence. This led to the loss of some of them ; some were sold with
their mother, and one, which showed the least white on the head,
was mated with her father, the wild drake. She had grown up to
be very like her father, being slighter in body than the tame race,
but as she became adult she developed some bare red skin at the
base of the bill and just round the eye, but not a full bare face ;
moreover she got some white speckling on the head (white on the
head does not develop, so far as I have seen, in the first plumage,
even in fully white-headed Muscovys) and had olive-yellow feet.
Her offspring were normal in the down, but most were sold
early, and the one female retained for breeding resembled her so
closely, still showing a little white speckling and red skin on the
head, and pale feet, that she might have been her sister instead
of her daughter. Probably in consequence of being so closely in-
bred, her daughter never laid, pined away, and is now dead. Mean-
while the Society had acquired another pair of Muscovy ducks,
also from South America, but this time obviously, from their heavy
forms, of domestic origin ; their colour was peculiar, a shaded
brown, much like a "poker-work" scorched picture; the drake,
whose eye-patch was black with red eyebrows, had not fully
developed the white wing-patch, but the female had, and was
fully adult. She had a red eye-patch and dark eyes, while the
half-wild female and her three-quarter-wild offspring&apos; had light hazel
eyes like the wild drake. These birds soon moulted into the dark
green-black plumage of the wild bird, and the drake acquired the
full white wing patch like his mate ; she also had from the first a
white patch on the front of the neck. The brown colour must have
been due to fading under a hot sun ; they never assumed it again
here. When the three-quarter-bred wild female was mated to her
grandfather, the half-bred wild bird was paired with the above tame
drake as well as his own original cotnpanion. Both became
mothers of ducklings, those of the half-wild bird being normally
black and yellow, assuming the white-edged under-plumage when
feathering, and judging from the one drake kept till adult age, fol-
lowing the normal course of developments the nasal caruncle was
still smaller than in the wild bird.

Mr. Frank Finn,
The ducklings of the tame duck were, however, very peculiar
-- all sooty black except for a yellow patch on the fore-neck ; in some
this yellow was succeeded by some white feathers, but in all, the
portions of the immature plumage--cheeks, forehead, and under-
parts--which are white-edged in the type, were edged with brown,
which resulted in the young birds looking at a little distance com-
pletely black all over. The two which were kept to adult age,
however--a drake and a duck -- assumed the white wing&apos;-patch as
usual, and no one would have known they had been melanistic in
the downy stage. The drake also, as in the normal-coloured form,
developed white feathers round the eyes before becoming bare there ;
the duck, curiously enough, has developed these feathers but as
yet has not become bare there.
She was mated to the wild drake -- as her mother should have
been in my opinion--this year, and laid when much less than a year
old, and before her white wing patch was developed. Only one duck-
ling, a normal one, was hatched from her first clutch, and this soon
died ; from her second six were hatched, two of the normal yellow-
bellied and faced form, and four all sooty-black, without any yellow
on the neck ; the mother, by the way, was one of those which bad
no white feathers on the neck.
These ducklings are now Hedged ; the two normal-coloured
ones have the normal white-edged immature plumage, the others
have the forehead, cheeks, and underparts edged with brown instead
of white, and look all black a little way off. None have their grand-
mother's white neck-patch. Meanwhile the said grandmother has
had another brood by the same tame drake, just like the first, all
black with yellow neck-patches.
Unfortunately there is no means of knowing what this tame
drake was like as a duckling, but as the half-wild duck when mated
to him still bred normal-coloured young, and as his daughter by his
tame mate still breeds some dark young (even darker than her
mother's, being without yellow neck-patch) even when mated to the
wild drake, it seems that for this new dark variety of the duckling
she alone is responsible; she is, in fact, a highly dominant bird in
this respect.
It is curious, however, that while even the three-quarter-bred

wild bird descended from the other (white-headed) tame duck showed
red round the eye, this has not yet appeared in the purely tame
daughter of the black tame bird, which daughter yet has obviously
the clumsy tame shape. Probably her premature breeding has
arrested development.
I may here mention another curious instance of variation in
Muscovy ducks which occurred at the London Zoo several years ago.
In this case, a tame drake, normal except for a few white feathers
and a general deficiency of green sheen, accompanied by a slaty
tinge, was mated to two tame ducks of the white-headed variety.
The offspring were about half normal in the down, the other half being
pale drab or lavender-grey above instead of black. The normal
birds grew up normal, but got white heads later, as far as I saw in
those which were kept ; of the grey-hacked six were kept (the others
being sold in the down), and these all grew up pale grey like Anda-
lusian fowls ; two had the erectile crown-feathers white. Both these
were drakes ; in fact only one of the six was a duck.
I have seen this grey variety elsewhere, but it is rare; but of
the few I have thus seen three were females, though those were not
all grey, but about half white. It evidently occurs sporadically,
and may not be sex-limited to any great extent.
Some interesting conclusions may be drawn from the study
of these familiar ducks for they throw light on several colour
problems. We see that a new variation in down-colour (black) may
arise suddenly, and be correlated with an adult plumage differing
little (in the Mallard) or not at all (in the Muscovy) from the
normal type. Furthermore, in the Muscovy case the black type
of young seem to have decidedly dominant tendencies.
This may help to explain the curious fact that of our two
most familiar British diving-ducks, the Pochard (Nyrocct ferina ) and
the Tufted Duck (.Fuligula fuligula), the former has pied young
much like the young of the Mallard, and the latter has ducklings all
black except for the yellowish abdomen. Those theorists who would
maintain that all differences of colour have a close relation to
the environment would be puzzled to say why the young of these
birds, breeding on the same fresh waters and remarkably equal in
diving power, should be so different in colour; one type must in-

eviably be out of harmony with its environment, if the other is
protective. But if the black young of the Tufted Duck are simply
the result of a dominant variation in the direction of blackness, there
is no need to drag in the environment at all.
And if the environment does not matter, we can understand
why the Mallard, essentially a temperate-zone breeder, should have
young so like the Muscovy, which breeds in tropical swamps, where
the environment is not quite the same. Both of these are surface-
feeders, and it evidently does not matter how the young&apos; are coloured.

GARDENS.
At this time of the year, as a rule, eery few birds of any
importance arrive at the Gardens, which is just as well considering
the uncertainty of the weather conditions ; and there is not much to
record, the past two months having been no exception to the general
rule.
In November, three examples of the Indian Pond Heron
(Arcleola grayi) and a Koel (Eudynamis honorata) were purchased,
neither having been exhibited for some years. Only once previously,
in fact, has the Pond Heron been represented in the collection,
namely in 1901, when Mr. E. W. Harper presented a pair. It is
quite a small heron, only some 18 inches in total length, and the
male is a beautiful bird when in breeding plumage, its head pale
yellowish brown, carrying a crest of long white feathers, the wings
and tail white, and the back feathers long and of a rich maroon
colour. One of the birds at the Gardens is in this summer plumage,
the other two in the brown plumage of the non-breeding season.
Mr. Finn tells us that the arrangement of colours of this
heron renders it very inconspicuous when on the ground, but most
conspicuous when the bird gets up, as it appears then to lie almost
a white bird. Its food consists of frogs, crabs and small fish and
insects, and it frequents even the smallest ponds, and is common in
nearly all parts of India.

The Koel is a purely fruit-eating cuckoo, the male of a glossy
greenish-black colour, and the female a brown bird, which lays its
eggs in the nests of the Indian Crow. Its call-note resembling the
syllables 11 Ku-il," is repeated time after time, ascending and de-
scending in the scale, and is one of the most familiar sounds in
India in the Spring.
The Society is indebted to Mr. W. Cross, of Liverpool, for
the valuable donation of a Southern Fruit Pigeon (Crocopus chloro-
gaster), another Indian species, which is by no means common in
living collections, although common enough in its own land. The
prevailing colour is olive green, the breast being greenish yellow and
the top of the head and cheeks grey.
There are now eight species, lielonging to five genera of fruit-
pigeons in the Gardens, and it is much to be hoped that we may be
successful in inducing some, of which we have pairs, to breed next
summer.
The collection has been enriched by the purchase of four
more specimens of the blue variety of the Budgerigar, all of which
are young birds, not nearly so bright in colour as they will be when
adult. We have one adult specimen, a male, which is mated to a
green hen, so the pair should produce some interesting young birds
next season. The blue colouring is very intense, and well set off by
the pure white of the forehead. We know that the yellow variety
of this little parrot occasionally occurs in the wild state (a case is
recorded in the October number of the Emu), and it is hoped that
ornithologists in Australia will keep an eye open for wild specimens
of the blue phase which has so far only turned up in captivity. We
hope soon to be able to exhibit side by side the three phases of this
interesting little parrot.
A bird of very great interest is an example of the rare Nepalese
Eagle-Owl (Hulma nipalensis) from Eastern Nepaul, recently pur-
chased from a gentleman who had taken it from the nest last April
and reared it by hand. It is a very handsome owl, very light in
colour with large black eyes and long ear-tufts. Only once before
has the species been represented in the collection, and that nearly
forty years ago. D. S.-S.

By Herbert Goodchild, M.B.O.U.
In the last week-end of Nov., 1912, the twenty-fourth annual
exhibition of the London Cage Bird Association was held. From
the point of view of the number of entries (some 2,200) the event
was a great success, and also from the point of view of species to be
seen, there being some six species of birds that the present writer
had never seen alive before. The judging of the Foreign Bird
Section was in the hands of Mr. D. Seth-Smith, and this had an
advantage over the previous arrangement of Mr. Astley judging, as
with Mr. D. Seth-Smith as judge, we had the pleasure of seeing
some of Mr. Astley's rarities, one especially, the Blue Niltava,
(Xanthopygia cyanomelcena) securing the coveted prize for the
choicest foreign bird in the Show, and being greatly admired for its
beauty of plumage and condition.
The foreign birds were arranged in seventeen classes, of which
two were for members of the L.C.B.A. only, and one was an " open
selling class."
This brief review is not written in any sense to either criticise
or commend the judging, but to give those of our readers who were
not fortunate enough to he present an idea of the number, variety,
and rarity of the birds exhibited.
The total number of entries in the Foreign Section w r as 167,
this excluding Siberian Goldfinches or Bullfinches or the very in-
teresting " Continental " class, which will be dealt with later.
In the first class, for Budgerigars, Love Birds and Hanging
Parrots, the only rarity was Mr. A. Ezra's Abyssinian Love-bird
(Agapornis taranta), this being the first time I had ever seen one
alive.&amp;quot; It is a very plain little bird, and this specimen was in
splendid condition and was awarded first prize.
The next class, for Parrakeets in general, contained the rare
Purple-crowned Lorikeet (Mr. C. T. Maxwell) a species only
recently imported. It is a native of South Australia and got first
prize. A very good male Queen Alexandra Parrakeet of Miss Lydia

Clare's had second prize, while her Turquoisine Parrakeet ( Neophema
pulchella), the first I ever saw living, was fourth ; third prize went
to a Barraband's Parrakeet. Mr, Astley showed a pair of Queen
Alexandra's Parrakeets--I was told the pair that had bred &apos;in his
aviaries. These particular birds looked ill at ease. An interesting
bird in this class, described as a " rare Rosella," but which Mr. Finn
and I both believe to have been a Tasmanian Parrakeet ( Platycercus
flaviventris ) was shown by Mr. T. J. Dawson. Other fine birds were
a good cock Many-Colour ( Psephotus multicolor ) and the Masked
Parrakeet from Fiji, shown by Mr. C. T. Maxwell. The class also
included Bauer's, Barrabands, Crimson-winged, Yellow-rumped, Red-
rumped, Barnard's, Blossom-headed, Red-headed Conure and Rosella
Parrakeets.
The class for short-tailed Parrots included a true pair of Blue-
rumped Parrots,--the same pair I believe that Mr. L. W. Hawkins
showed at the Crystal Palace in Feb. 1912, and of which a black-and-
white plate appeared in our Magazine. They were then in immature
plumage, but have now got into adult dress. These got first prize ;
second prize went to Mr. Maxwell's Black Cockatoo ; third to the
Rev. G. H. Raynor's charming Meyer's Parrot ; fourth to his rare
Everett's ; v.h.c. to his. Aubrey's, and h.c. to our member. Mr. Sydney
Williams for his Ducorps Cockatoo, which he tells me may not only
be trusted out of its cage, but which will go out with him seated on
his shoulder. Mr. Williams also "swept the decks" in the class
for Weaver's, taking first with a Crimson, second with a Red-headed,
third with a Black-headed, and fourth with a Kaffir--a fine team.
In the class for Waxbills in general, Mr. R. J. Watts got first
with his charming little Green Avadavats ; third with Indian Silver-
bills ; v.h.c. with his Cordon Bleus and h.c. with Golden-breasted
Waxbills, while second went to Mr. F. Howe for Golden-breasted
Waxbills, and fourth to Dr. G. B. Thwaites for his pair of Cordon
Bleus. All the birds in this class were of well-known species.
Class 182 for the rarer Waxbills, Fire Finches, etc. had nine entries.

them being Calliste tricolor : the other two fastuoscc. First prize,
as usual, going to our redoubtable friend, Mr. S. M. Townsend, with
his only exhibit in this class, a Tricolor.
The class for the rare Tanagers numbered eleven. First prize
going to Mr. Maxwell's unique Bed and Black Tanager, which is not
yet in show condition ; this was the first living one I had seen.
Fourth to his Necklace Tanagers. Fady Kathleen Pilkington showed
four birds, the now well-known Blue and Black Tanager--the only
living one I ever saw,--a Black-backed, Festive and Pectoral. Mr.
A. Ezra showed a pair of the rare Black-backed Tanagers ( Calliste
melanonota), Miss Bousfield a White-capped Tanager and Mr. Towns-
end a charming specimen of the uncommon Yellow Tanager.
The Sugar Birds, Sun Birds, etc., as usual had the most
interesting and beautiful birds in the show. Foremost of all was
the Amethyst-rumped Sun Bird ( Cinnyris zeylonica ) of Mr, Ezra's,
a bird that, as a living gem, might grace the palace of an Emperor.
Mr. Maxwell's pair of Purple Sugar-birds came next; third to Mr.
S. M. Townsend's Black-legged Blue Sugar-bird,--a rare thing in
collections of skins and the only one I ever saw alive--in perfect
condition; fourth prize went to the Hon. Airs. Bourke's Purple Sugar-
bird. Mr. Maxwell showed a Banana Quit ( Certhiola luteola I

believe), and an Amethyst-rumped Sun-bird, while Mr. Hawkins
showed a Purple Sun-bird (C. asiatica) and a Black-headed Sugar Bird.
The class for the Shamahs, Bulbuls, etc., had nine entries,
the only uncommon birds being a Red-eared Bulbul and a Dval
or " Magpie Robin."
The 1 odds and ends " class contained three specimens of the
rare Loo Choo Robin ( Erithacus komaclori) a species that is only-
represented in the National Collection by two or three skins, in
second rate condition, of birds that have been in captivity, hut Lady
Kathleen Pilkington, the Hon. Mrs. Bourke and Mr. A. Ezra, all
showed birds the British Museum would be only too glad to possess.
In this class the gem of the show, for rarity, if not for beauty, was
the Blue Niltava ( Xanthopycja cyctnomelcena) of Mr. Astley's, a bird
found from China to Borneo wherein the sexes differ vastly, the male
being black, deep blue and white, and the female brown and sandy.
Everybody admired this exhibit, which was charmingly tame, hut
which was not easily seen in its deep box cage. Mr. Astley also
showed Indian Brown-backed Robins (not Wrens, as listed) while
the Hon. Mrs. Bourke also showed a Ruby-throated Warbler and a
Minivet ( Perecrocotus hrevirostris) , the first Mini vet of any species
that I ever saw alive. Unfortunately, the red colour, which should
he vermilion, had turned pale in captivity. Mr. Ezra showed a
Japanese Redbreast ( Erithacus akahige). Mr. Maxwell a "Copper-
smith " Barbet, a common bird in Calcutta, but a rare one in
London, and Mr. J. Erostick, an Indian Hunting Cissa, which, like
the Minivet, had lost its bright colour by moulting in captivity.
Class 190, " Pairs for Foreign Hybrid Breeding " contained :
first, pair of Fire-tailed Finches (C&lt; H. Row) ; second, Sydney and
Violet-eared Waxbills (C. T. Maxwell); third, Russian Goldfinch and
Rose Finch (Carpodacus) , and (C. T. Maxwell) Tricolour and Pretre's
Tanagers.
The remaining classes for foreign birds (selling and members'
classes) contained a Yellow-rumped Finch--first shown by Mr.
Seth-Smith at the Crystal Palace,--American Nonpareil, Paradise
Whydah (Mrs. Thynne's), Silver Tana ger, Mr. J. Dewhurst's African
Coleys and Mr. W. A. Shepherd's three exhibits of Mynahs, of
species I have not determined.

The Members' Dinner.
The British birds, all told, numbered about 340 entries, but
the great majority were the common seed-eating species--Goldfinches,
Bullfinches, Linnets, etc. However, there were five or six Haw-
finches, several Snow and Cirl Buntings, an Ortolan, and others.
Another class contained a Nuthatch, several Bearded Reed-
lings, and a Marsh Tit. Amongst the Larks were two Shorelarks, a
Woodlark, a Meadow and a Tree Pipit. Another class had a Ring
Ouzel and a Great Grey Shrike, the latter was very much at home ;
and a Waxwing, no uncommon bird at a Cage Bird Show. Another
class contained five Nightingales and seven Blackcaps. The Jays,
etc. contained a Jay, a Magpie, and two Choughs, one of which, by
its size and colour might have been of the Himalayan race. Wag-
tails numbered two Greys and three Yellows.
The mixed class for insectivorous birds included five or six
Dartford Warblers, a Whitethroat, a Treecreeper, a Wheatear, a
Wood Wren and a Black Redstart. The next class for hen birds
had two more Dartford Warblers, a Goldcrest and some Bearded
Reedling&apos;s, Those who like abnormal birds would admire the white
" Blackbird " and the lutino Yellow Bunting that were in a class for
" rare-feathered birds."
Mr. Shepherd exhibited a Kestrel Falcon, the only bird of
prey in the Show, unless one includes the Shrike.
The " Continental " birds included the lovely Azure Tit of
Mr. Maxwell's, his Red-breasted Flycatcher and Mr. Ezra's Euro-
pean Bee-Eater.
Altogether the Show was one the L.C.B.A. might well be
proud of, and the visitors thankful for.
THE MEMBERS' DINNER.
Provided a sufficient number of members express a wish to
be present, the proposed dinner will be held on Friday, Feb. 7th,
4943, at the Cafe Royal, Regent Street, at 7 p.m. The price of the
dinner, excluding wines, will be 6/-. Morning dress.
Since rooms at the Caf6 Royal are in great request during the

RETIREMENT OF MR. BONHOTE
FROM THE EDITORSHIP AND TREASURERSHIP OF THE SOCIETY.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.985136" page_id="32654923"  page_num="Page 95" year="" vol="">
Members of the Avicultural Society will share the regret of
the Council at the retirement of Mr. J. L. Bonhote from the double
post of Editor and Treasurer, which he has held since August 1910.
For several years before that date Mr. Bonhote acted as Treasurer ;
and when Mr. Finn, owing to pressure of other work, was compelled
to give up the editorship, Mr. Bonhote kindly consented to fill his
place, and, with the sanction and approval of the Council, to retain
the duties of Treasurer as well. Mr. Bonhote's tenure of these con-
joint offices has been followed by marked improvement, both in the
financial affairs of the Society and in the quality of the Magazine ;
and the Council wishes to take the opportunity of expressing their
great indebtedness to him for giving so much of his time, energy and
knowledge, without remuneration, to the work the conduct of the
Magazine demands, and of wishing him every success in his new
duties, the undertaking of which has compelled his reluctant retire-
ment from the active and prominent part he has hitherto taken in
the affairs of the Avicultural Society. They hope, nevertheless, that
he will still be able to help the Society by contributing articles from
time to time to its journal.
MR. BONHOTES SUCCESSOR.
During the past four months Mr. Bonhote has found it im-
possible to give the necessary attention to producing the Magazine,
and, since last October, the duties of Editor have been carried out
by Mr. D. Seth-Smith, to whom the sincere thanks of the Society
are due for undertaking the work for which his official post in the
Zoological Society leaves him but little spare time. The Executive

rmvieius.
Committee, however, has great satisfaction in announcing that Mr
H. D. Astley has most kindly volunteered his services as Editor in
succession to Mr. Bonhote. Mr. Astley's wide experience in avicul-
ture and competence as an ornithologist are so well known that the
Committee feels assured that members of the Society will share their
confidence that the editing of the Magazine could not possibly be
entrusted to better hands.
Mr. D. Seth-Smith has kindly consented to produce the
February number of the Magazine ; but articles and notes for the
March and subsequent numbers should be sent to Mr. H. D. Astley,
whose address, until further notice, will be :--
Benham-Valence,
Speen,
Newbury.
Since the work of our Editor is often rendered arduous by the
necessity of applying to Members for articles and notes and by
having to fill up vacant spaces in the Magazine from his own pen,
the Council venture to hope that Members will make every effort to
lighten Mr. Astley's labours in these respects by the unsolicited

This is one of the usual brochures directed partly against what
is called " sport " and partly against the study of animal life in
captivity. As usual it assumes that the sensations and mental
equipment of the lower animals are as highly developed as in man,
whereas every student of Nature knows that they are nothing of the
kind.
Personally I consider sport, in so far as it consists of the
hunting and shooting down of semi-domesticated animals, a selfish

if healthful pastime ; but I should not pretend to question the right
of those who think differently to indulge in it, because (after all is
said) we have the highest authority for claiming that man's welfare
is of more importance than that of a beast. I do not excuse pigeon-
shooting from traps : if a man desires to show his skill, shooting at
glass balls thrown in the air would answer the purpose equally well.
A bird in a cage does not spend its existence in vain regrets
over its lost liberty : in all probability its mind is a complete blank
as regards the past. It lives in the present and is content so long as
it is kindly treated and has plenty of food suited to its needs.
If the well-meaning persons who write pamphlets of this
character would confine themselves to condemnation of those prac-
tices which all aviculturists condemn, such as the barbaric adorn-
ments worn by thoughtless women and involving the death of
thousands of innocent and beautiful creatures, or the wholesale
slaughter of useful birds by ignorant persons, they would be doing
good work. As it is they are hindering the advancement of science.

THE EMU.
The October number of this journal is well up to its usual
standard of excellence, its chief feature being an admirable paper
by Mr. Sidney W. Jackson, entitled Haunts of the Spotted Bower
Bird. In it the author describes a trip to a station on the
west bank of the Moonie Biver in New South Wales, about
500 miles north-west of Sydney, where he camped for about five
months, during which he gained a better acquaintance with the
Spotted Bower Bird than probably any person has previously
possessed. His diary of field observations, which was kept daily,
is of very great interest, throwing considerable light on the habits
not only of the Bower-birds, which were his daily companions, but
upon a large number of other birds which frequented the district,
which appears to have been a regular ornithologists' paradise, not-
withstanding the fact that the season was excessively dry and hot
--100* during the night of December 25th.
Mr. Jackson succeeded in taking a number of photographs of
the nests and eggs and young of the Spotted Bower-bird and several
other species, and some of these have been admirably reproduced to
accompany the paper.
Other subjects dealt with include " Internal Parasites re-
corded from Australian Birds," by Dr. Harvey Johnston. " Field
Ornithology in South Australia," by Captain White, and " Notes
on the Mistletoe Bird " by Mr. L. G. Chandler. D. S.-S.

The Committee appointed by the British Ornithologist Club
to carry out observations on the migration of British birds have had
no light task to perform, and the present exhaustive report, like
those previously issued, is an imposing volume containing an im-
mense amount of useful information on a subject which, until it was
taken up by this Committee, was very little known.
As in previous Reports, the various species are taken separately
and the dates of their first arrival and subsequent movements over
our islands, as observed by the large band of ornithologists and other

observers who are working in touch with the Committee, are re-
corded. Thus we read that the Turtle Dove appears to have entered
the country mainly on the south-east between Suffolk and Hamp-
shire, the first arrival being recorded on April 13th. By the first
of May one of these first arrivals had already laid in Essex. The
main body of these doves arrived between May 4th and 15th, and
slowly extended north and west, immigration being continued on
the east coast right up to the end of May.
All of the spring&apos; and autumn migrants are dealt with in
the same way, and weather conditions for the period covered are
published.
Although efforts have been made to condense some of the
matter in this Beport, it considerably exceeds in size those previously
issued, running to no less than 332 pages. D. S.-S.

The September to November numbers of this charmingly
illustrated and interesting Magazine fully keep up the standard of
excellence to which we confidently look forward as each number
appears. We cannot spare the space to give details of all matters of
interest recorded in these parts of the volume, but would call special
attention to Mr. Abel Chapman's article, illustrated admirably by his
own pencil and entitled Spring-notes on the Borders, in the Sept-
ember number ; Miss E. L. Turner's instructive paper " Notes on the
Bearded Tits," with photographs by the authoress, in the October
number, and Dr- N. E. Ticeliurst's splendid article, illustrated by six
photographs by the author, entitled " Some Notes on Nightingales "
in that for November, all of which papers make good reading. In
addition to valuable contributions by Mr. J. B. Nichols and others
are numerous interesting short notes to which it would be impossible
here to refer in detail. A. G. B.

In The Field , of December 14, appears a letter above the initials D. McD.
describing the successful breeding of a pair of Balearica pavonince at Logan,
Strauraer, Wigtonshire. "The nest, raised some inches above the ground, was
in the centre of a large patch of bullrushes in swampy ground on the side of a
loch. Three eggs were laid. The birds began to sit on Aug. 12, and one egg
was hatched on Sept. 9 ; the other two unfortunately were bad. The birds took
it in turn to incubate, the one off duty flying up to the house to feed, remaining
there only a short time. Two days after hatching the parent birds brought the
chick on to open grass near the nest. On this ground they spent the whole day
busily engaged in catching insects to feed the young bird. When hunting for
insects the cranes walk slowly backwards, stamping the ground, doubtless to
drive out the insects, which, owing to the cold weather, are somewhat scarce."

THE MEXICAN PIED GROUND THRUSH.
Cieocichla pinicola (Sclater).

of this Thrush in Europe.
A pair was sent me from Germany in the autumn of 1911,
and these birds moulted and were extremely healthy, while in the
summer of 1912 they were killed through being given unclean
gentles, which at the same time were the cause of the death of a
fine pair of American Bluebirds with their one young one, which had
left the nest. Such carelessness and neglect of proper care will, I
trust, be a lesson to my bird-keeper, whom I had actually warned
of the danger.
The Pied Ground Thrush is not nearly so active a bird as his
near relative, the Orange-headed (Cieocichla citrina), neither have I
ever heard it sing.
My pair would sit in a lethargic way, and became too fat in
consequence ; and when they did fly, they flew heavily, although in
perfect plumage. Their legs are not so long as in most of the
Geocichlge, and to call them Ground Thrushes seems to me a mis-
nomer, for that is just the place where they do not seem to be at
their ease; they were always perching when they could.
They uttered two notes, one a sharp squeak, which seemed to
be a note of warning or alarm ; the other a much more melodious
one, sounding like a railway-guard's whistle blown softly and shortly.
They are Thrushes which seem naturally tame, for I have

The Mexican Pied Ground Thrush.
lately received two more, both of which I am almost sure are males;
for both are dark, and the female is easily distinguished from the
male, by being of a much lighter shade of brown throughout.
The Mexican Pied Thrush is found in the Valley of Mexico,
and up to an altitude of 8,400 feet above the sea level, at which
height it breeds. It is an inhabitant of the pine woods.
Localities where it has been found are Tetelco and Coapa,
etc. (Valley of Mexico) ; Peal del Monte, Hidalgo. Amula, Guerrero;
Sierra Nayarit, etc.
There is apparently no difference between the summer and
autumn plumage, but Seebohm remarks--Monograph of the Turdidas,
Vol. I., p. 96 -- that freshly-moulted birds are somewhat more tinged
with ochraceous buff on the abdomen and under tail-coverts. Geo-
cichla pinicola resembles the Indian Pied Ground Thrush (G. Wardi),
and the Siberian, but is not so strongly and handsomely marked.
This Thrush is about the size of a Song Thrush. Both with
my first pair and my present ones, when I first received them, they
hopped out of their travelling cage in the bird-room, making them-
selves quite at home, and evincing no shyness at all, taking meal-
worms from the fingers almost at once. But to me they are not so
attractive as the Orange-headed Ground Thrush, one tame male of
which species lives in a cage in my bedroom, where he flies about
when I am dressing of a morning, and emits his ringing and melo-
dious notes, seated on the edge of my dressing-table. By the
beginning of December he is in full song, and as soon as the room
is light enough with the grey dawn creeping in, he tunes up. And
how he splashes in a green basin put as his bath on the floor !
A charming pet. His orange head and breast become brighter each
moult: it is curious why some birds, like the Sepoy Finch, the
Crossbill, etc. should on the contrary lose their colour, no matter
how they are fed.
I had looked forward to my defunct pair of Mexican Pied
Thrushes breeding, and now that I have received what I believe to
be two males, my hopes are deferred !
I regret having so little to record about a species which is so
rarely imported.

By W. E. Teschemaker, B.A.
I am told that there is a corner which wants filling in the
prospective number of the Magazine, so I am writing a few further
notes on the young male Whinchat which I kept for further obser-
vation out of the happy family of five reared in the aviary last
summer. As I think I remarked recently, it is unfortunate that
we are compelled by our Rules to exclude from articles describing
the nesting of species all data as to the change of colour and the
subsequent history of the young reared, although the latter data
may be of even greater interest. Of course one can send supple-
mentary notes, but these form only disconnected observations, losing
their context, their freshness and much of their interest.
I kept the young Whinchat for some time after the moult in
a cage in the sitting-room. I like to see birds in their proper places,
that is to say either in an aviary or in the bird-room ; at the same
time it is sometimes necessary to have a bird under constant obser-
vation, and it is nice to have just one singing bird downstairs, so I
find room for this one cage--a home-made, three-compartment affair
--in my sitting-room. The Shama occupied two compartments and
the Whinchat the remaining one. I did not think much of the
Whinchat's song at first : it was low-pitched, somewhat throaty,
and had some very unmusical passages, which reminded one of the
scolding notes of a Whitethroat, but it gradually increased in volume
and began to borrow some of the Shama's tours. Then the Shama,
who up to this time had taken no notice of the Whinchat's vocal
efforts, tried to silence his rival, whereupon the latter redoubled his
efforts, and the result was a tremendous vocal contest which generally
lasted from early morning until the lamps were lighted. Just at this
interesting stage two Blue-throated Warblers in the aviary began to
fight and I was compelled to bring one in and to turn the Whinchat
out, in order to make room for it.
Now, although the Whinchat's new quarters consisted of a
heated aviary where some Wheatears, Blue-headed Wagtails, etc.
were doing well, he almost at once began to fail. One always takes
a risk when one shifts a bird which has got into a particular groove

and is doing well in that groove. For one thing bird-society is very
cruel to the stranger within its gates--as cruel as human society is
to the woman with a past. Moreover, a bird never forgets anything;
it pines for the old faces, the old ways; it becomes unhappy and, in
next to no time, it becomes ill, though its food, mark you, has not
been varied in the smallest particular. In two or three days the
Whinchat's wings began to droop and I made a mental note that it
required watching. One morning the Whinchat did not come to
greet me as usual : I found it in a dark corner leaning against the
wire-screen encircling the hot-water pipes. This generally means
one of three things. Usually it means that the sufferer is dying,
and in that case, if handled, its temperature will be found to he lower
than that of one's hand. Or it may mean that the bird has made
up its mind to commit hari-kari. It is a well-established fact that
when the untutored savage has had a little too much of the noble
white man--of his stock-whip, his six-shooter and his whisky--he
sometimes squats upon the ground, bends his head, closes his eyes
and in a very few hours he has entered the great darkness : all birds
have the same faculty, This is one of Mother Nature's good gifts
to her children--her happy release.
But the noble white man, having deserted Mother Nature for
the tinsel and paint of a strange and deadly thing called Civilization,
is no longer the recipient of her good gifts and, when he wishes to
commit hari-kari, generally has to make a horrid mess of himself
and his immediate surroundings.
The third case I never fully understood until quite recently.
One evening I found myself in a sumptuous new Restaurant ; every-
thing of the best was there--every thing except customers, who had
apparently not yet discovered its merits. I sat in one corner
and in the dim distance was one other solitary diner. Standing by
their appointed tables were the trim waitresses, each a picture of dull
apathy and utter weariness: probably they had been standing there
all day with absolutely nothing to do. In the centre was one of
those artistic hot-water radiators in cream enamel and, leaning
against it, was a motionless and pathetic little figure in dainty cap
and apron. I shall always remember that picture -- the splendid hall
with its vaulted ceiling, its oak-panelled walls and oriental carpets,.

the soft glow of the shaded electric lights, the spotless linen, the
profound silence and that pathetic little figure, clasping the radiator
with one rounded arm and leaning a tired head against its smooth
columns. Then I understood why the palatial aviary with its
sumptuous appointments is not always a conspicuous success and I
realised that the Whinchat, huddled against the hot-water pipe, and
the little figure clasping the radiator were one and the same mental
phase, though exactly why they both found consolation and support
in this way was not so easy to understand, unless perchance it
reminded them both of the warmth of a snug little nest, far away
from smoky cities, and of happy days long past, which would never
return.
I picked up the Whinchat and carried him back to his old
home in the sitting-room. In one short week a plump and vigorous
little bird, suffering from no definite illness, had become almost a
skeleton and was evidently on the very brink of that dark river which
no traveller recrosses. Now a sick insectivorous bird of any kind is
difficult enough to deal with, hut a sick Whinchat is a proposition
more difficult than the fifth of Euclid -- of evil memory. However,
with sympathy, careful handling and that best of all medicines known
as &apos; little bits,' he rallied most amazingly. At the end of one week lie
sang a little, in a fortnight he took the Shama on, in three weeks he
had become a really fine performer. I was inclined to regard him as
a brilliant exception to the ordinary run of Whinchats, but the other
day I took up my copy of Bechstein, in which I found the following
(quoted from Sweet) : -- " This bird may be considered as one of the
tenderest of the tribe, being very susceptible to cold. It is one of
my greatest favourites. One that I bred from the nest by hand
learnt the song of the Wliitethroat, the Redstart, Willow-wren, Night-
ingale, and also that of a Missel Thrush which it frequently heard
singing in a garden close by, of this latter song it was so fond that
we were frequently obliged to put our favourite out of the room, not
being able to bear its loud notes ; it was certainly the best bird I
ever kept of any kind, singing near the whole year through and
varying its song continually ; the only fault was its strong voice."
In the matter of the susceptibility to cold of this species
there seem to he the usual exceptions, for our member, Mr. Galloway,

Anas boscas and Cairrna, moschata.
By Frank Finn, B.A., F.Z.S.
{Concluded from page 88).
I ought to have mentioned above that the second lot of
ducklings from the two domesticated Muscovys alluded to on p. 86
as black with yellow neck-patches in the down, have fledged off
exactly as their predecessors with the same down-colour and parent-
age had done, with brown tippings to the feathers of face and under-
parts ; some of these also had the white neck-spot like the mother,
hut not all. As I did not pay attention to the inheritance of this
point, I cannot give the number of those which showed it.
To return to the question of the significance of these duck-
variations; another point they throw light upon is the origin of more
striking colouring in a species. When such a point distinguishes
both sexes from the young, it is commonly presumed that the male
has acquired it first and that then it has been transferred to the
female ; in the Muscovy duck we can see that both processes are at
work, without human or natural selection.
The hare face has indeed been generally transferred to the
female in domestication, in whatever part of the world she is kept ;
at any rate, I have seen it in specimens bred in India, Africa, America
and Europe.
On the other hand, the white head, which is often the only
abnormal part of the plumage, and looks just as natural as the
white head of the Bald Eagle (. Haliaetus leucocephalus) appears in-
differently in both sexes. As it does not appear in the immature
plumage, anyone not knowing the true wild Muscovy duck would, I
am sure, conclude that this is simply the proper adult colouring of
the species in default of evidence to the contrary.

some spontaneous Variations in Mallard &amp; Muscovy Ducks. 107
A similar case is furnished by the Andaman Teal (Nettium
albigulare ) all recently captured specimens of which I have seen
show a white head (except for the crown and a few scattered
feathers) and nape, in both sexes ; yet such birds breed young whose
heads are at first without white, and have only a white eye-ring
developed at first, as the normal bird used to have. Here we have a
character suddenly developing in an undomesticated bird.
The variations of the two domesticated ducks also throw
light on the phenomena of "warning colours" and "mimicry."
They are not at all nearly allied, and the Muscovy is much the more
able to look after itself, and is inferior, as human food, to the
common duck.
Hence its conspicuous colour and slow flight (the half-wild
birds bred in the Zoo showed this well) would be put down as
characteristics of a protected " species if it were an insect. These
characteristics are enhanced in domestication by the general change
of the black of the male's bare face to red, the common appearance
of abnormal white in the plumage, and the frequently yellow (instead
of dark) colour of the feet.
At the same time, the common domestic duck, the descendant
of the very different-coloured and far more palatable and helpless
Mallard, often varies from its normal colouration to resemble the
Muscovy, for one often sees black-and-white common ducks coloured
and marked very like pied Muscovys. Moreover, white and blue-grey
forms of both occur. Yet no one would conclude that the tame
Mallard is developing their colours by selection, individuals having
colours like Muscovys having escaped the clutches of the poulterer
thereby ! Thus we need not conclude that if two remotely related
species of butterflies or birds in the same district resemble each
other that natural selection has brought this about.
Finally, we may learn a lesson as to the development of sex-
colouration. I have cited an instance in which the development of
the blue-grey colouration in the Muscovy showed a tendency to be
limited to the males; if this proved hereditary we could soon raise a
strain characterized by blue-grey males and black females, and this
would not have been due to the "preference of the females through
untold generations," but to an abrupt unexplained development of a

PARRAKEETS.
Psephotus cucullatus and P. chrysopterygius.
By Hubert D. Astley, M.A., etc.
In The Field of the 28th of December, 1912, Mr. Seth-Smith
supplied some notes upon these two species of the family of Psephotus ,
of which the Red-rump Parrakeet and the Many-Coloured are two
well-known members.
Mr. Seth-Smith perhaps thinks that I confused the Hooded
and the Golden-shouldered, but when I wrote to The Field to an-
nounce the fact that I had successfully bred the former species, I
carefully wrote the Hooded Golden-shouldered Parrakeet, and gave
its title of Psephotus cucullatus ; but the Natural History Editor
omitted the latter and also the title of " Hooded." This beautiful
little Parrakeet is quite as Golden-shouldered as its near relative,
P. chrysopterygius, and consequently I called it the Hooded Golden-
shouldered Parrakeet ; rather a lengthy name perhaps, but des-
criptive.
However, be that as it may, tire principal point of Mr. Seth-
Smith's Field note, is that the Hooded Parrakeet is probably
synonymous with the Parrakeet described by Professor Collett in
the Proceedings of the Zoological Society for 1908, which he named
P. dissimilis. He described it as nearest to P. chrysopterygius (the
Golden-Shouldered) but as lacking the yellow hand across the fore-
head ; the crown chestnut, etc. : and further on he described the
crown as dark chestnut. In the Victorian Naturalist, Feb. 1909,

on Hooded and Golden-Shouldered Parrakeets. 109
Mr. North described a parrakeet which agrees perfectly with P.
cucullatus, i.e. as having the crown black, not chestnut.
Mr. Gregory Mathews, who is publishing a great work on the
Birds of Australia regards North's P. cucullatus as synonymous with
Collett's P. dissimilis. Mr. Seth-Smith adds that the specimen
from which the latter author's description was taken, was probably
immature, which would possibly account for the crown being dark
chestnut instead of black. " This being so," he adds, " we must in
future adopt Professor Collett's name of Psepholus dissimilis for
this species."
Now to begin with, with all due respect to Professor Collett,
dissimilis seems to me both inapropriate and non-descriptive, for the
word merely means dissimilar-to or different. So that if one w 7 ere
to translate the bird's name into English and call it according to that
translation, when any inexperienced stranger perchance on visiting
my aviaries were to ask me the name of the hooded parrakeets, I
should have to say 11 That is the dissimilar' parrakeet, and it is
" called so because it is rather different from what is known as the
golden-shouldered ' parrakeet." The Hooded Parrakeet is an
appropriate distinction, and it seems a pity as it is known as P.
cucullatus (= hooded) to drop that title. However, I ought to be
able to prove this question, having four young of this species in
nestling plumage, which as yet resemble the adult female.
When they moult it remains to be seen as to whether the
males at once acquire the black hoods or dark chestnut. If the
former colour appears, I think it will undoubtedly prove that P.
cucullatus is not synonymous with P. dissimilis, and this will be a
fact of great interest. Neither can I help feeling that it will he so,
as it is surely very unusual for parrakeets to assume a half-way
colouring on the head, with the rest of the plumage as found in the
adult bird. I could imagine the hood attaining the full colour
perhaps rather gradually, that is not entirely black (or chestnut) at
the first change of feathers, but not chestnut the first year, and then
black. Nous verrons !
Since the above was written I have received the following
note from Mr. Blaauw:--" I had the pair of Hooded Parrakeets
" which you have, before they were in colour, they looked fike

Mr. T. H. Newman,
"females. The male acquired the black hood at once, and there
" never was any other colour, so I suppose that your young birds
"will do the same."--H. D. A.
[However inappropriate a name may seem, it must be recognised and
adopted providing it was the first name given with a description of the species
in a recognised ornithological journal. I quite agree that the name cucullatus
describes the bird in question better than dissimilis does, but that is not the
point. If P. cucullatus is proved to be the same bird as the one previously
described under the name of P. dissimilis, then Mr. North's name, proposed
in 1909 , must give place to Professor Collett's name proposed in 1908 , however
much we may prefer the one to the other.
Whether the two are really synonymous or not is another matter. I
published a note on this subject in this Journal for April 1910 , and I considered
then that the two must be distinct, as I could not see how the crown of P.
cucullatus could be described as dark chestnut. There is, however, a tendency
in hot climates for black feathers to fade to a rusty tinge, and this may
possibly account for Professor Collett mistaking the colour for " dark chest-
nut." I am inclined to agree with Mr. Astley that it would be remarkable for
the young of a black-crowned species to exhibit a chestnut colour on the crown,
although I suggested this as a possibility. But I think the theory of the
plumage being faded is more likely to be correct.
Mr. Gregory Mathews, who has for some years been working on the
birds of Australia in connection with his great book, tells me that the two
names undoubtedly refer to the same bird, which must in future be known as
P. dissimilis. -- D. S-S., Ed. pro tem .\]
THE WHITE-THROATED PIGEON.
(Colurnba albigularis)&lt;
By T. H Newman, E.Z.S.
In 1910 an account of the nesting of my White-throated
Pigeons appeared in our Magazine. As several points were then
left in an unsettled state, and as I believe my birds are still the
only specimens in England, and perhaps in Europe, I now venture
to send a few additional notes. This magnificent species has
proved itself in all ways such an admirable bird in every respect
from an avicultural point of view, being surpassed by none in
beauty, it is perfectly hardy, freely rearing its young even in
the depth of Winter, it is amiable in disposition (exceptionally so

on the White-throated Pigeon.
Ill
for a Pigeon), it readily adapts itself to confinement, always
keeping itself in beautiful condition, is not wild, so does not
dash about and knock itself against the wires, as for example
the White-crowned Pigeon will often do, and is absolutely no
trouble to cater for, being content and thriving on a diet
composed chiefly of ordinary maize ! So what more can any
aviculturist possibly want ? For though all praise is due to
anyone who can keep a delicate little bird in good health and
condition, that would die without the hundred and one little
almost hourly attentions needed to keep it alive, yet the only
really satisfactory kind of bird which is likely to survive among
us in the good time to come, which is promised to us, when no
poor bird may be caught and kept in durance vile, is the sort
that adapts itself freely to semi-domestication, such as the
Canary, Budgerigar, Barbary-dove, etc., etc. To this catalogue
very possibly this fine bird,--the White-throated Pigeon,--might
be easily added as a notable addition. Perhaps it even might be
allowed its liberty, as it is a bird of considerable intelligence,
and I notice it is fond of spending much of its time in certain
spots, which it seems to regard as its home. But this last point
is one that is only conjecture, as the birds are too valuable and
my stock too small to allow me to experiment in this way,
much as I should like to do so. It must also be borne in mind
that such forms of Pigeons as have been domesticated, such
as the races of lima and phteeonota are naturally rock dwellers,
whereas alhigularis is a strictly arboreal species, even more so
than our familiar Wood-pigeon.
I will now narrate the doings of my birds since I first
wrote about them. It may be remembered that I described the
rearing of two young birds in 1909. The same pair of old
birds nested three times in 1910, hatching three more young
ones, all of which were reared. In 1911, the old pair were
together with the five, now grown up, young ones. One word in
passing about the sex of these young birds, of the four eldest,
three were cocks and one a hen, the youngest, which lived for
over a year, was not sexed (this is the only bird hatched here
which has died so far). During this year twelve eggs were laid

Mr. T. H. Newman.
by the old lien, but there were too many of the birds together,
for though the birds as a rule do very little fighting, it must be
remembered there were now three grown up sons all asserting
themselves, and as one of these was paired with the young&apos; hen,
and this pair were also anxious to set up house - keeping,
naturally there was keen competition for the rather limited
eligible and desirable nesting sites, in every case after the very
first nest, which was made in an elder tree in the open flight ;
all nesting has taken place on the top of faggots under the glass
shelter which looks out towards the open flight, the nest being
placed in a corner so as not to he immediately under the glass.
None of these twelve eggs hatched, most of them were broken in
the disputes, some were certainly fertile, hut the majority were
not, which I think was due to a curious and rather unusual
incident in the economy of the life of a pair of such faithful
birds as pigeons, for I found that one of the eldest sons had
supplanted his father in the affections of his mother, for although
the old cock remained healthy and vigorous, and still is so I
am thankful to say at the time of writing, yet the old hen
refused to have anything to say to him, literally giving him the
cold shoulder whenever he came up to speak to her as he con-
tinually did, being naturally hurt by his wife's strange conduct ;
of course the young cock also behaved unkindly to his father.
Can it be wondered that such a misalliance did not prosper, and
that no young&apos; ones were hatched ? At the end of the season
I removed the five young&apos; birds, when the old hen quietly returned
to her original mate, and nesting was resumed during the early
part of 1912 as if nothing had happened to interrupt the even
tenor of their blissful partnership. The first two attempts were
unsuccessful, the first egg being unfertile and the second one
being broken, hut three more nests each have produced a healthy
young one, two being fully reared, the last one, hatched about
January 2nd, 1913, being still in the nest, so the old cock who
was thrown over two years ago is still proving himself as devoted
a parent as ever: the male parent, I have noticed, seems to do
nearly all the brooding by day, it is quite an exception to find
the hen on the nest. The young bird first leaves the nest when

about three weeks old, by which time it is well feathered, its
wing&apos;s being large but rounded looking as the longer flights are
not yet nearly full grown ; it is capable of quite sustained flight,
though it does not then seem able to distinguish objects well,
as it will fly against the netting as readily as to a branch,
where it will remain clinging to the wire for some time. The
other day I saw what was probably the first attempt of a young
bird to explore the outer world. I was outside the aviary, when
my attention was drawn to an old cock White-throated Pigeon,
perched on a branch, uttering frantic grunts and vigorously waving
his wings up and down in a great state of excitement. I then
found that his precious infant had just flown from its nest and
was clinging to the wire netting.
After its first flight the young bird invariably returns to its
nest where it will often remain for two or three days longer before
again venturing forth. The reason why so far every egg hatched
has been reared may be attributed to the fact that the birds do
not nest so frequently as most pigeons do. It so often happens that
pigeons in captivity become anxious to nest again before the young
of the first nest can look after themselves, so they get neglected and
become weak and often die. The White-throated Pigeon seems to
lay about every two months, on the average, though, of course, it
will do so more often if anything happens to prevent the rearing of
the young in one nest. The young do not seem to be driven off
when full-grown. When the old pair were with their five young ones,
it was not until the young birds were themselves anxious to nest that
I noticed the first signs of disagreement, and quite lately, since the
last young one has been hatched, almost every day I used to see the
former young bird, then about two months old, sitting by the
side of its father who was brooding the newly-hatched young one.
All the above refers to a single pair of birds and their young
ones, but it may be remembered that there were originally six birds
imported. I will now briefly relate the history of the remaining
four. I mentioned that three of these birds were heavily marked
with white feathers on wings, tail and breast, but that I believed
they would in time revert to the normal plumage if they improved
in health, as the white feathers were evidently a sign of weakness..

On the White-tliroated Pigeon.
This, I think, was quite home out by subsequent events, for though
none of these birds lived long enough to regain the perfect plumage,
one dying on 18th June, 1910, another on 23rd October, 1910, and
the third on 25th May, 1911. They were all most certainly much
darker with fewer white feathers than they at one time had. I have
the skins of two of them, all the white marked feathers seem to be
old and worn, whereas the new feathers are all normally coloured.
I believe all three of the white marked birds were cocks, one
of them mated with the sixth and last, an ordinary coloured bird,
early in March, 1910. Six eggs were laid, three at least being fertile,
unfortunately none were hatched. The hen died on 1st February,
1911. It is very much to be regretted that this pair did not rear
any young as they would have been so useful to mate with birds
from the first pair.
I mentioned above that two of the young birds reared here
had mated. The young hen laid her first egg on 20th August, 1910,
it was unfertile, but I gave them a young newly-hatched Snow Pigeon
(Columba leuconota), they kept it alive for about a fortnight, but did
not rear it. During 1911, seven eggs were laid, but nearly all were
unfertile. In 1912 five eggs were laid, three of which were broken,
but the other two hatched, two beautiful young birds having been
fully reared, in every way appearing as strong and healthy as any
of the others although bred from birds which are brother and
sister. My present stock consists of a pair of the original birds,
eight more bred from them, and two grandchildren, twelve in all, a
beautiful series, which I cannot however regard without a certain,
melancholy feeling, for without a further importation of fresh blood,
this stock must, after a few years at the most, gradually lose vitality
and die out, and when shall we see a fresh importation, for who
wants pigeons ?
In my first paper I mentioned that the second bird reared in
1909 had thirteen tail feathers instead of the normal twelve, and I
wondered if it would still retain them all when it became adult ; it
is now a fine cock bird and still has thirteen rectrices, he lives with one
of his brothers on most friendly terms. This last summer these two
birds were most anxious to nest, they built a large substantial nest
in which one or the other spent much of its time, the only thing

needed was an egg. They were much pleased when I gave them one,
but they did not hatch any young birds.
It may have been noticed that I have not mentioned the
number of eggs laid at a sitting in this paper. I have now records
of forty eggs, laid by three different pairs of birds, one pair twenty-
one, another thirteen and the third six eggs respectively, and in every
instance, without a single exception, only one egg has been laid at
each sitting. From this fact it often makes it rather difficult to be
quite sure of the exact day when the single egg is laid, but from my
notes I gather that the duration of incubation is about 17-19 days
The following details will suffice for an example : found an egg laid on
the morning of March 20th ; on April 6th, the egg was chipped ; on
April 7th at 10 a.m. the egg was much the same, only rather more
chipped; at 4.30 the same afternoon the young one was hatched.
I have had eggs laid in every month of the year, the birds seem
rather, perhaps, to prefer rearing young in the winter, but they seem
ready to nest at any time, except when actually moulting.
OUR CRANES.
By Miss R. Aldekson.
Some six years ago a friend offered to give me a Crane he
had brought from Africa. I wanted it, and I did not want it ; most
people who keep birds will have gone through the same mixed feelings.
I had no aviary large enough to keep such a bird in, and to give it
full liberty in the garden meant possibly destruction to the flowers.
Also it was said to eat fish and this seemed rather a difficulty, so
I declined the Crane, though very reluctantly, and feeling terribly
ungrateful to my friend. Yet I am sure it is best to say 'no ' to an
offer of a pet of any kind unless you are sure you are quite happy
in having it. Most of us can keep only a limited number, and these
should be just the special kinds we really want.
I little thought that in a very short time we should have not
one Crane but two. In Jan. 1907, two Crowned Cranes were sud-
denly sent to us by a friend out in Nigeria, and we could not refuse
them as they were already on the way. In Vol. VI. of the Maga-

Miss R. Alderson
zine (New Series) page 123, you will find a few notes on this pair of
birds, so I must not go over old ground by repeating myself, but just
continue their history from where it leaves off.
Of these two birds we still have the hen, so that she has
been with us six years, and we do not know how old she was when
she came ; she has never been ill, and is a very fine bird.
Her grain food for some time now has been wheat only, and
she seems to thrive on it. Added to this, there is what she picks up
in the garden (and in the summer especially this must amount to a
good deal) and a regular supply of black-beetles.
Beetles love darkness and warmth, and are found in great
quantities down coal-pits. One of the miners catches the beetles for
us in traps, and his little children come every month for " beetle-
money." The contents of the traps are emptied into a shallow
dripping tin, with a little water in, and from this the beetles cannot
escape. Their troubles are short-lived, for the Cranes soon pick
them out and eat them. I think the oil in the bettles must act as a
sort of feather-tonic on the Cranes, their plumage looks so glossy.
The lien Crowned Crane, " Lady," bids fair to be a sort of
avian " Bess of Hardwick," for she has outlived two husbands, and
I have no doubt will welcome a third when we can get her one.
We have been unfortunate with our cocks. The original one
"Rex" did well for some years, then one day he was noticed to be apart
from the hen. As he was generally a perfect shadow to her, and a
slave to her every whim--and she is a real tyrant--this seemed very
strange, and we soon saw that it was not a quarrel but illness that
was the cause. The pretty pink colour in Rex's cheeks began to
fade, and a blackish look came over the hare skin, his head and
wings drooped, and though he still came out of the aviary every day
he looked the picture of sad despair. " Lady " seemed purposely to
keep away from him, and if she was troubled she did not show it.
As a rule, you will find it very seldom that a sick bird is befriended
by a healthy one. The strong seem to shrink from the sick, and
leave them to their fate ; it is perhaps a law of nature and a survival
of the fittest.
One or two instances of the reverse side come into my mind
as I write. One of a hen Brush Bronze-wing Pigeon who had one

strong young one in the nest. The second young one--too strong and
venturesome--fell out on to the floor below and lay hurt and dying.
When I went down to the aviary I found the poor anxious mother-
bird brooding the hurt young one on the floor. How her heart must
have been torn between the two, but the little injured bird claimed
more of her love than the healthy one.
Poor " Rex " had to bear his illness alone. We, of course,
got advice for him, and he was given medicine and was hand-fed
and for several days he still went about, at first seeming better, then
worse. On about the third day I got up vely early and went to the
aviary to see how he was. I opened the door only to find him
stretched on the floor quite dead.
We sent the body up for a post-mortem examination and you
can imagine what we felt when the answer came that it was diph-
theric roup. As well as we could we disinfected the aviary, but
we had nowhere else to put the hen so she had to stay where she
was, but she kept quite well and went on as usual with her daily
life in the garden, just sleeping in the aviary at night.
A little time after this, my brother bought a pair of Demoi-
selle Cranes thinking they would be company for " Lady," but she
took no notice of them and kept to herself. At night we shut her
up in the inner part of the aviary as it did not seem wise to leave
all three birds together, for the Demoiselles were very young&apos; and
the Crowned Crane much the stronger bird.
The Demoiselles were bred in Germany, and were only in baby
dress when they came to us. Their colour was drab brown, where
later it was clear French grey, and the beautiful snowy curling ear-
tufts were very undeveloped and not very white.
We called these two birds " Paul" and " Virginie " and soon
the former, which was the larger and more upright bird, became very
tame and would eat from our hands. " Virginie " came to a sad end
only last summer when we had had her for some years. Like the
Crowned Cranes the Demoiselles were pinioned and had the run of
the garden. One day the two birds were walking about as usual when
one of the gardeners noticed that " Virginie " was bleeding under
her body. He sent in word to me and I came out to find her still
walking about, but with a most fearful cut. The strange part was

Miss R. Alderson,
that, otherwise, she looked much as usual. I telephoned for the
veterinary and he came up quickly, prepared to stitch the injured
part, but a very brief examination showed him the case was hopeless,
the internal mischief was so great. There was nothing to be done
save to put her out of her pa in as mercifully and quickly as possible.
We never found out the cause of the accident, and can only think
the bird tripped over a flower stake. It was all so sudden. In less
than an hour all was over, and poor " Paul " our only Demoiselle.
We gave the dead body to a naturalist here and he made the
strange discovery that the dead bird was a cock, though much the
smaller and feminine looking of the two. "Paul" is a much finer
bird and walks with an erect gait. " Virginie " used to mince along
with her neck curved, but we noticed that she used to do far the
most of the dancing.
In the meantime we had got a second cock Crowned Crane.
He was in poor condition when he came, but looked healthy and
promised to make&apos;a line bird. For lack of a better name we called
him " Beder," which in the native language means the full moon.
It was amusing to see how " Lady " expected from him the
same slavish worship which she had from poor " Rex." She would
march up the garden thinking the new arrival was following her,
and when she at last looked round and found he was taking no great
interest in her, she would stop in great perplexity. After a time she
gave it up, and became quite ready to give some of the admiration
instead of expecting it all for herself, and many were the kisses and
caresses the pair bestowed on each other, but always in a very dignified
fashion. Their manner of doing it was curious ; they would come
close together, their beaks almost touching, and gaze into each
other's eyes as if transfixed, then would come gentle affectionate
dabs with the beak of one on the face of the other, generally ending
in the " crown " feathers being smoothed out. They used to make
a pretty picture, but they hated even a hand camera, so a photo-
graph was almost an impossibility. But still in some ways " Lady"
was decidedly the master. One day I was amused to watch the birds
taking their bath. The bath was specially made for them and is
large and shallow. " Lady " stepped in first, and after a moment or
two "Beder" followed, but this she would not allow. With quiet

determination she literally shouldered him out, and enjoyed her bath
entirely alone, whilst " Beder " walked round the outside, catching
the splashing on his feathers and trying to pretend it was just as
good as being inside.
These two Cranes were very happy together, and the hen
welcomed her companion, for I think that she was more lonely than
we realised during the few months she was without a mate. But
now, unfortunately, she is again a widow. About ten days ago. on
January 11th, we had a very heavy snowtorm, it looked like last-
ing all day, so my brother went out to drive the Cranes into the
aviary. As a rule they stay out all weathers, but when it is very
severe we put them up. The two Cranes were found in different
parts of the garden, and "Beder" was noticed not to be looking
quite as bright as usual. He did not, however, seem really ill, so
you may imagine what a shock it was to us to find him dead in the
aviary next morning. He seemed to have died very quietly, the
body was quite stiff, and the beautiful pink colour in the cheeks had
faded away. We sent his body up for a post-mortem examination,
but have not yet heard the result. Poor " Lady " looks lonely, and
for a day or two seemed shivering and cold, but she still keeps quite
well, and now the snow is nearly gone she can get about better.
Close to us is the Roman Catholic Church, where they have
a single bell, not a very musical one. This bell is rung three times a
day,--in the early morning, at mid-day, and at night. Whenever
the Crowned Cranes heard it they would begin to call; first both
calling together, then one after the other, like a pair of horses
breaking step. Now " Lady " does the calling alone. Even in
the dark the Cranes would do it, but they ceased when the bell
ceased. They seldom called at any other time, save when they were
frightened, or separated from each other, or when they came up to
the house to be fed, or to tell us they considered it time for the
aviary door to be opened so that they could go to bed. Fortunately
our neighbours rather like the Cranes' call when the bell goes. One
lady, who lives close by, but who did not know at the time that we
kept any Cranes, mistook the noise for something wrong with the
bell, and was much amused when I told her the real cause.
It was very pretty to see the Crowned Cranes dance, they

Miss R. Alderson,
looked so beautiful, marching up the lawn with their wings held
high and stretched to the full, but it made one wish so much that
they had not been marred by pinioning. The effect in the spread
wing is quite enough to spoil it, though when the wing is in repose
it does not show. I do not think the operation is very painful if
properly done, and it is, of course, a necessity if the bird is to run
loose. The hen Crowned Crane is a great jumper, but does not&apos;
often indulge in it unless frightened. Sometimes she will have a
mad fit and careers up the lawn in wild jumps with outstretched
wings and neck. She comes close to the house to be fed, but will
not feed from our hands.
After the death of " Virginie," the Demoiselle, we got another
mate for " Paul." This new bird " Rudolph " is supposed to be a
male, he is still in his drab dress and very young and is aviary bred
from abroad. He is rather frightened of "Paul" though they are
always together. When first " Rudolph " came he was very in-
quisitive and if the low windows in the drawing room were left open
he would come inside and walk round the room, never breaking
anything, but apparently much interested in the pictures. " Paul "
would not venture inside, but would stand close to the window
giving his call note of fear again and again. Though he displays
this anxiety yet to tell the truth he bullies " Rudolph," and in little
points, such as helping himself first to feed, he is essentially the
master. " Paul" loves to look for long at a time at his reflection in
the drawing room windows, and has, I think, a latent taste for
music, for he tapped hard on the glass, as an accompaniment, when
I was playing the other day.
Both the Demoiselles like Spratt's Pigeon Biscuit (it is sold
ground in small pieces, and I was told contains egg) as well as
wheat. They have no other grain, but enjoy mealworms, these,
however, are only given as a special treat.
Every morning&apos; I put two little heaps of pigeon biscuit on the
dining room window sill for the Cranes, if I put only one heap
"Rudolph" would go short. "Paul" is also very fond of small
pieces of bread, and prefers crust to crumb. It is pretty to see him
take it through the window from your hand, for when he is pleased
lie gives happy little grunts of satisfaction whilst eating. He makes

another sound, more like a hiss, that is pretended indignation when I
play with him. He will spread his wings at me and make his neck
feathers all stand out straight, and puff out his white whiskers and
dance about, but it is all fun and show off, for "Paul" and I are
very good friends and quite understand one another. He knows
quite well that he has only to ask and to have, and that I am always
ready to feed him whenever he wants anything. He generally tells
me by looking in at the windows, or lingering by the garden door.
Our little broken-beaked Robin comes from his look-out in
the hawthorn tree close by to pick up "Paul's" crumbs from the
sill. Or, if the window is open he will come inside and help himself
if any food is on the table. Sometimes he sits on the back of a
chair and gives us a sweet low song, just to show it is not quite
all cupboard love.
We have had this Robin now for some years and when first
the beak -- the upper mandible--was broken it could not pick up
food from a flat surface, but only if we dropped it amongst grass. The
brave little bird weathered that hard time though we feared it would
die, and it has never forgotten us. The beak has grown only a little,
hut it has hardened, so can grasp the food better.
I think every bird lover should have an " aviary Robin " and
a ' house Robin." The little fellows are there for the asking and by
their cheeriness, give us much more than we ever give to them.
The Cranes have a great aversion to cats and are very inquisi-
tive about them, but not at all afraid. They will stalk them
amongst the bushes, and the cat generally looks very uncomfortable.
I once saw " Paul " keep our little wild squirrel a prisoner up a tree
for quite a long time. The squirrel wanted to come down for the
food we had put out and chattered with rage and disappointment,
while " Paul " with uplifted beak guarded him quite unmoved.
He is a strange bird, the other day I saw him very busy
picking up short twigs from the lawn and dropping them just an inch
or two away from where he picked them up, there seemed no object
at all in what he was doing.
Sometimes " Paul" will pick up a stick and begin to dance
with it in his beak. He has one sad fault, lie loves to root up

Snowdrop bulbs as if he liked the smell of them, but beyond this and
eating the Ribbon grass, the Cranes are not very destructive.
I have got so used to having Cranes that I should not like to

plenty of space, try one and I think you will agree with me that
they are very charming pets.

GARDENS.
Little of importance, in the way of birds, has arrived at the
Gardens during the past month, but three species appear to be new
to the collection--The Mahali Weaver, the Cuban Black Bullfinch
and the Pink-browed Rose-finch.
The Mahali Weaver-bird ( Plocepasser maliali ) of which the
Zoological Society acquired three specimens by exchange, ranges
from Aufola and Matabeleland into Eastern Cape Colony and the
Transvaal. The sexes are alike in colour, and in size it about equals
the Greenfinch. The top and sides of the head and a band
down the side of the throat are black ; the back brown, and the
underparts, lower back and tail-coverts and a conspicuous streak
over the eyes white, the wings being barred with this colour. Dr.
Stark describes these birds as inhabiting bushes and mimosa trees,
rarely being found in the open country. " Of social habits " he
remarks, " it remains in flocks all the year round and breeds in
company, several nests being generally built in a single tree." But
although of social habits he describes the males as extremely
pugnacious, constantly fighting during the spring.
The Cuban Black Bullfinch ( Melopyrrhci nigra) is very closely
allied to the little finches of the genus Spermophila and it is not
very apparent why it should ever have been separated from these.
Both sexes are alike, black, with a white bar on the wings. It
appears to be new to the Gardens, though I think I have seen it in
captivity somewhere. Three specimens have been acquired by
purchase.
Mr. St Quintin has kindly presented a specimen of the Pink-

browed Rose-finch (Propctsser rhodochrous ) which, although new to
the Zoological Society's collection, does not appear to be quite new
to aviculture, as I hear that others have been imported recently. It
is a native of the Himalayas, and when in colour, the male is
clothed in rosy-pink hues suffused with brown, the pink colour
being particularly bright over the eyes and on the rump. Like all
the Rose-finches, however, it looses the pink tint in captivity,
its place being taken by a dull yellowish hue.
Since the death of the cock Somali's Ostrich a few months
ago, the Zoological Society had been without an Ostrich, but now,
thanks to the kind help of Mr. A. C. Minchin, the Director of
the Adelaide Zoological Gardens, we have received five very nice
young birds of the South African form, Struthio australis, which
were bred in Australia, where Ostrich farming has been going on
successfully for some years. It is to be hoped that these Australian-
bred specimens will stand the climate of London better than those
from the hot interior of Africa.
The pair of Kolbes' Vultures occupying&apos; the large central cage
of the Birds of Prey Aviaries have gone to nest as is their habit at
this inclement season of the year, and, as I write, the hen has been
sitting for about five weeks. On previous occasions they have done
the same, but without success. This year we have carefully sheltered
the sitting bird with canvas, and we hope that the single egg may
hatch. I only hope I may have the pleasure of recording this happy
event next month. D. S-S.

or Sea Swallows which annually visit the British Islands for their
nesting season. Mr. Bickerton has studied these five species on their
nesting grounds, and in addition to making very valuable notes on
their habits, all of which are fully recorded in his book, he has
secured a truly wonderful and very beautiful series of photographs,
no less than thirty-seven of which have been reproduced, mounted as
thirty-two plates in this book.
The rage for collecting eggs of the rarer British birds has
been particularly destructive to the Terns in the past, and were it
not that some of the species are now strictly protected by the
owners of the land upon which they nest, they might ere now have
vanished as breeding species. The Sandwich Tern is now steadily
increasing in numbers as a breeding bird on the Ravenglass Gulley,
thanks to the strict protection afforded it by the owner, Lord
Muncaster, a fact which is demonstrated by the numbers of eggs
observed annually by the keepers.
The author's account of his search for the rare Roseate
Tern is very interesting, but for obvious reasons he refuses to divulge
the secret of the locality in which he discovered this prize. The
very excellent photographs of this beautiful species prove how
successful he was.

CORRESPONDENCE, NOTES, &amp;c.
THE MOULT OF IMMATURE BLACK REDSTARTS.
SIR,--When writing recently in the Magazine I suggested that young
male Black Redstarts probably assume an eclipse plumage at their first
autumnal moult because they are (as far as my limited experience goes) so
much darker than adult females in nest feather, but barely distinguishable from
the latter in the interval between their first autumnal and first spring moult. I
released the adult female when clean moulted and, as I expected, she flew straight
away just like a wild bird. The two young males were rather backward and
showed no inclination to forage for themselves and, even if they had been a little
older and more experienced, they would certainly have perished in the truly
appalling weather which we experienced here at the end of August. So I let an
exhibitor, who has kept one of my young Stonechats in good trim for almost two
years, have them for a few shillings on the understanding that he should report on
the change of colour, if any. It may perhaps be of interest to quote briefly from
his report which, as will be noted, supports the above conjecture. His letter is
dated 7th Nov.: "I very much regret the delay in answering your previous,
enquiry re Blackstarts, but you will understand that this is our busy season and
I am at business until 9 p.m. and it is almost 10 p.m. before I get home, so that
I have had really very little spare time since the beginning of September. The
Blackstarts have both finished their moult and have become very much lighter
in colour than when in nest feather. I can hardly describe the colour correctly,
but it is a very soft shade of grey. The inner flight feathers have an edging of
brown, the same as in the Redstart, but I think that was the colour they had
when in nest feather as they did not moult wings or tail. Thev look very nice
just now."
Whilst on this subject I may mention that one of our members, who wae
staying last October at Brixham, came over to spend a day with me and told me
that he had seen no less than seven Blackstarts in a quarry there one sunny
morning. There is a rumour that four of them returned home with him. As
has been the case with those I have seen myself on our Devonshire coast, he--

found them exceedingly shy ; they refused to look at a mealworm, but succumbed
to a very fine wire smeared with bird-lime. In my recent notes I remarked on
the shyness of this species and pointed out how remarkable it was that it should
frequently become so familiar in the breeding season. A well-known ornitholo-
gist, writing recently in a well-known Monthly, describes how he saw one on a
small island off our east coast. Apparently he yearned to slay it but the Black-
start was too wide awake for him. He says :--" On Oct. lltli I had a good view
with binoculars of a Black Redstart sitting * (?) on a wall. I had two more
views of it at about a hundred yards but it was very wild and would not permit
a near approach."
Well done, little Blackstart ! I strongly recommend you to adopt the
same policy again the next time you meet any ornithologist. Look out for
aviculturists too: they are not much better. W. E. TESCHEMAKER.

RAIN QUAILS.
SIR,--I bought three Rain Quails in the summer--one cock and two hens.
I have no outdoor aviaries here. Do you think they are likely to breed in a run
6 feet long by 4 feet wide and 1 foot high, and could I put them out in the grass
by the middle of March ? They are at present in a cage in my sitting-room and
seem most content and happy.
I should much like to get them to breed but fear this run may not be large
enough for a pair. I should be most grateful for your advice, and I hope you
will forgive this long letter. HELEN ATHERLEY.
[Rain Quails would not be very likely to breed successfully in the small
run you describe. Eggs might be laid, but the hen would probably refuse to sit.
They want a place three or four times the size, with long tussocky grass.
You would be wise to wait until April before putting the birds out.--ED.
An odd thing for the bird to do, especially in October. W.E.T.

SIR,--This extraordinary mild Christmas has had the effect of making a
good many of my birds think of nesting. In my largest aviary a pair of Rusty-
cheeked Babblers have constructed a nest in their shelter in a dead larch. The
nest is a very large one, measuring 18 inches across and 6 inches in depth. In
appearance it resembles an extra large and rather untidy Blackbird's nest. The
material used was almost entirely the roots and leaves of the artichoke, of which
plant a good many were growing in the aviary last summer. These Babblers
are quite the most interesting birds I have. They are extremely active and make
constant use of their long scimitar-shaped bills in turning over sods, etc., and
digging for worms and other insects. A very curious feature connected with them
is their call note. The male has a very fluty whistle of two notes, and the female
whistles one note only and has a higher pitched one than the males. When the
male calls, the female instantly answers, so that the three notes are continuous.
In fact, for a long time I thought that all three notes proceeded from the same
bird. I have never heard either whistle separately.
Their other song is an inharmonious chatter chiefly used when
frightened or angry. I have great hopes that these birds will lay and bring up
young. Should they do so, I shall hope to send you full particulars, as I under-
stand that they have not so far been bred in this country.

SIR,--I read in The Standard a short time ago a notice on the subject of
injury to health from bird-keeping, and the multitudes of disease-germs
scattered abroad merely by a pet canary shaking itself. It seems to me to be a
matter of extreme importance to Aviculturists, and we should take the warning
to heart by observing the most scrupulous cleanliness in the case of our
feathered friends, both for their sake and our own, and letting them have as little
house atmosphere as possible. Cages can be kept quite wholesome if washed
every day regularly, with a little Condy's fluid in the water, and every other day
fresh sand and earth thickly laid on the zinc or tin floor of the cage, not merely
sprinkled on it. I do not suppose that really careful bird-keeping--in cages and
aviaries--injures health, but one can readily imagine the reverse. A bird that
bathes in fresh water every day can surely disseminate very few disease-germs !
On the other hand, anyone who keeps a bird in a wretched little cage with no
means of bathing properly, and the perches and floor of the cage seldom if ever
cleaned, is courting disease, and in the interests of the campaign against tuber-
culosis, this sort of bird-keeping ought to be strictly prohibited by law. A cage
that is kept as clean as one's house should be, can be no vehicle for disease. It
would be well if the attention of the Sanitary Authorities were turned to the

animal and bird-shops, many of which, judging from the atmosphere in them,
must contain masses of disease germs. If bird-dealing were regulated by law
and under supervision, it would go far towards the prevention of tuberculosis,
besides being a step in the right direction towards stopping the deplorable indis-
criminate traffic in birds.
Katherine Currey.
[We quite agree that birds kept in cages should be kept scrupluously clean,
chiefly for the sake of the birds themselves. The form of tuberculosis from
which birds suffer is quite different from that to which human beings are subject,
and we do not think it has ever been proved that the one can be infected by the
other. The state in which many bird-dealers' shops are kept is deplorable, but
the chief sufferers are the birds and not their human attendants.--ED.]
RINGING BIRDS.
One of the most delightful and satisfactory branches of Aviculture is that
in which birds are kept in a semi-wild state, being allowed to fly freely, and
returning to the same place for their food. This method of keeping birds can,
of course, only be practised by a few--those who are the fortunate owners of large
estates, or who are on such good terms with their neighbours that the latter can
be trusted to refrain from shooting the birds. But several Aviculturists in this
country have foreign birds flying about their gardens in perfect freedom. I know
of a pair of Sulphur-crested Cockatoos, the property of one of our members,
which have their liberty in some woods in Surrey, returning regularly to their
cages for food ; while in Woburn Park there are hundreds of rare birds such as
Cranes, Geese, Ducks, Ibises, Black Cockatoos, and even small foreign finches
which are not confined in any way.
In such collections some birds are certain either to fly right away at the
period of migration, or to stray outside the protected limits, and, in all proba-
bility, be shot ; and the object of this letter is to endeavour to induce people who
keep their birds thus, to mark them by means of small light rings, so that should
such a bird be shot or captured its ownership may be traced. Such rings are made
either of aluminium or other non-corrosive metals, in several sizes, suitable for
any sized birds, and are so light that they do not in any way inconvenience the
wearers. They are most useful in enabling one to determine as to whether an
unusual bird visitor is a genuine wild example or one that has escaped from some
private collection. D. S.-S.

By Arthur G. Butler, Ph.D., M.B.O.U., &amp;c.
The external sexual characters of birds have for many years
been a fascinating study to me, and I suppose no other living avicul-
turist has paid anything like the same amount of attention to them
as I have. It has always seemed evident to me that, inasmuch as
most birds are able to recognise their mates at sight (certain Doves,
in which there is a great similarity of plumage in both sexes, being
exceptions), our sight only needed education to enable us to discover
those differences between male and female which were patent to the
birds themselves.
Although I did my best in my little book--" How to sex
Cage-Birds " to indicate features by which the sexes of the present
species might be identified, I failed to mention all the differences of
plumage which actually exist ; and, to impress characters of this
kind upon the memory, I am sure that nothing is better than an
accurate coloured plate; so that I congratulate myself and the
Society upon the fact that one has been granted to illustrate the
present article.
Liothrix lutea is variously known as the " Red-billed Hill-
tit," the " Yellow-throated or yellow-bellied Liothrix," the " Pekin
Nightingale or Robin " and the " Japanese Robin." Of course, as
the last-mentioned name is hopelessly incorrect, the bird being
neither a native of Japan nor related to the European Robin, it is

Dr. A. G. Butler,
the name in most general use. The best title, that first mentioned
above, is given in Jerdon's " Birds of India " ; inasmuch as, in many
of its attitudes and movements the Liothrix much resembles the
Tits, although in its wing-shuffling and graminivorous tendency it
reminds one of the species of Accentor ; not that this bird any more
than the Hedge-Sparrow limits itself to a seed diet, for it is both
frugivorous and insectivorous, while in captivity it devours soft
food with avidity.
The late Dr. Sharpe placed Liothrix and Accentor very near
together in the Museum Catalogue ; and, partly for this reason,
though also on account of a similarity in the behaviour of the two
genera, I called Liothrix and its near relatives &amp;quot;Accentorine Tits " in
my "Foreign Birds for Cage and Aviary," Yol. I, p. 28. On the
other hand, Messrs. Hume and Oates regarded Liothrix as a Babbler
and not very far removed from Zosterop.s, although referable to a
distinot Subfamily.
It has been argued that the present species is not Tit-like,
inasmuch as it does not hold its prey under its claws in order to pick
it to pieces, but rubs it backwards and forwards against its perch, or
even against the stiff feathers of its wings or tail after the manner
of Garrulax : this, I think, is correct, for I well remember on more
than one occasion, when I have thrown ants' nests dug up in my
garden upon the floor of the aviary where one or more Liotriges were
confined, that I was astonished at the extraordinary antics which
these birds indulged in and which at the time I imagined were due
to the ants having climbed upon and bitten the fleshy parts of the
wings and tail, whereas doubtless the little insects were in the birds'
bills and were being rendered helpless before being swallowed.
However, my object in writing the present article is not to
discuss the most appropriate trivial name of this charming songster,
nor its rightful position in the classification of birds, but to define
the external characters by which the aviculturist may select pairs
for breeding purposes, and to comment upon the racial forms of
the species.
In Jerdon's "Birds of India" no sexual differences are indi-
cated ; thus for many years bird-lovers were obliged to distinguish
the sexes entirely by their notes, -- the call note of the hen being a

monotonous whistle repeated four or live times, and the reply of the
cock a short musical phrase consisting of from seven to nine notes.
Later, as the species became more and more abundant in the
bird-market, one naturally wished to be able to distinguish male from
female at sight: crowded together in the dealers' cages Liothrix is
not always ready to respond to the whistled imitation of the female
call-note by the would-be purchaser. In Russ' " Handbuch fur
Vogelliebhaber " no information was available to assist the student,
but in his later work " Die Fremdlandischen Stubenvogel " Yol. II.,
published in 1899, detailed descriptions of both sexes were given.
Unfortunately both males and females of this species vary so con-
siderably, that one only becomes perplexed when comparing examples
in one's possession with such descriptions : they do certainly give
one a general idea that males are in all respects brighter than females,
which is correct when one compares the brightest examples of each
sex, but they do not indicate all the characters by which a brilliantly
coloured female can be distinguished from a male not in its most
showy plumage.&apos; 1 &apos;
With a view to studying these points more thoroughly I took
advantage of an offer made to me by a friendly dealer about 1899 to
secure three dozen examples at an extremely low price : and I asked
him to pick out the most varied specimens, which he evidently did. Of
course I had no intention of keeping the whole thirty-six permanently,
therefore when all were in perfect condition I set to work to sort
them out into what appeared to be undoubted pairs : these had a
most convincing aspect, and I was so satisfied with the result that I
let many of my friends have them. The purchasers were well
satisfied, both with the beauty of the specimens and the reasonable
price, but to my astonishment not one of those three dozen birds ever
sang: no doubt the cocks had all been weeded out of the consign-
ment before any of the birds left the hands of the importer, and thus
the low price was accounted for: they were all hens.
An experience such as the foregoing would probably dishearten
many men ; but I hate to be beaten, and therefore still continued to
* The white tips to the upper tail-coverts are described as a white band
across the tail, and for long I doubted the constancy of that character.

Dr. A. G. Butler,
search for differences which might be relied upon. In my book
" How to sex Cage-Birds," p. 15, I pointed out one colour-character
which appeared to me to be constant, and so far I have seen no
reason to change my opinion on that point as regards the Himalayan
form ; there are, however, other characters which ought to be, and
probably are, distinctive and reliable, and one of these has enabled a
Sydenham dealer recently to pick out cock birds for his customers
without, apparently, a single failure ; it is a character noted, but not
emphasized, in Russ' description of the male bird ; namely, the
more yellow tint of the crown.
My friend Mr. Allen Silver kindly procured one of these birds
in rough plumage for me : it was not only yellowish-green on the
crown but the front of the crown was blotched with yellow feathers
more or less abraded. When it had moulted, its inferior size and
different coloration seemed to me to indicate at least a well-defined
race, if not a distinct species from L. lutea : -- the crown was some-
what ashy in front, and where the yellowish patches existed in the
freshly-imported bird, there appeared after the moult two short
whitish streaks, the orbital ellipse and sides of head were, and are,
distinctly ashy : but more of this anon.
The following sexual differences in L. lutea seem reliable:--
Male, when mature, larger than female and with greater width of
skull ; the bill noticeably shorter when seen in profile, and broader
in the middle ; crown of a more golden olive colour, especially on the
forehead ; elliptical orbital streak pale yellow throughout and brighter
along its upper edge ; throat of a deeper yellow, this colour extending
below the orange belt which crosses the fore-chest, the belt itself
broader than in the female and of a more decided and brighter rusty-
orange hue ; primaries with broader yellow margins ; central upper
tail-coverts more broadly fringed at extremity with white.&apos; 1 &apos;
The colouring of the throat in various females which I have
possessed at various times grades from pale brimstone to lemon
yellow ; the elliptical orbital streak is either ashy throughout or pale
* Russ regarded this character, I think rightly, as the best for distin-
guishing males from females : it is not wholly absent, as Russ states, from three
female skins in my possession, but much narrower.

yellow in front of the eye and ashy behind it ; it is likely enough
that these differences in individuals may he indicative of age, and that
the paler birds are the younger ones, since the only skin I have which
shows yellow in front of the eye was nine years in one of my aviaries,
dying in 1910 : on the other hand they may characterize Indian and
Chinese types.
If my present cock bird lives, it will be interesting to see
whether succeeding moults will produce a permanent change in the
coloration, more especially of the head. It is not rare for old birds
to develop white patches on various parts of the plumage, but if
such characters exist in young birds they tend to increase in extent
with advancing age, and certainly it would be very unusual for the
juvenile plumage of a species to be considerably brighter than that
of a mature adult.
Liothrix lutea has been pretty freely bred in Germany, and
the plumages from the nestling down to the fully adult feathering
have been carefully observed and noted. Russ says of the young
feathering :--" Upper surface ash-grey, also the sides of head and
cheeks; wings blackish-grey; each primary with a narrow clear
yellow outer edging, through which the coming orange-yellow specu-
lum, that is to say on the third to eighth primary, is already clearly
discernible ; moreover, the last mentioned primaries have a broad
whitish inner border," &amp;c., &amp;c., but nothing is said about yellowish
or whitish patches on the crown.
Although at first sight very like the typical Indian form of
L. lutea, the inferior size of my bird and the various noticeable
differences in its colouring seemed at first to indicate something
more than what nowadays is distinguished under a trinomial desig-
nation as a subspecies; but, after the complete growth of all the
rest of the plumage, the whitish streaks gradually disappeared from
the crown, which became uniformly golden olive. Whether the
growth of the feathers covers the previously revealed pale bases, or
whether the colour intensifies as the bird recovers vigour I cannot
say; but in our Goldfinch the front of the face after a moult is
sometimes silky golden at first, subsequently changing to scarlet.
My present male Liothrix differs from the slightly larger
Himalayan form in its more yellow-green crown, more slaty-tinted

Dr. A. G. Butler,
back, ashy sides to head, including orbital ellipse ; paler and more
restricted throat-area, owing to the duller and more diffused orange
breast-belt ; margins of primaries buttercup-yellow and broader to-
wards the tips; wing speculum apparently of a brighter crimson ;
belt crossing secondaries behind speculum buttercup-yellow and
rather narrow : white terminal fringe to upper tail-coverts well
defined ; feet ochreous. Its song is shorter and less varied.
Not possessing the volume of the Museum Catalogue in which
Liothrix appears, and believing that no species but L. lutea was
known to science, I wrote to Mr. Charles Chubb at the Museum and
asked him whether he knew of any record of a species or subspecies
nearly related to L. lutea. In reply he said he knew of no new
species of Liothrix having been described, but he enclosed a note
published by the late Henry Seebohm in the Proceedings of the
Zoological Society, in which that author argues that the Himalayan
bird is distinct from the Chinese one, which is typical of L. lutea,
Scopoli (the original specimen having come from Nankin), and
should take the name L. calipyga (Hodgson, Indian Review, 1838,
p. 88).
Of the Chinese bird Seebohm says two examples procured by
Herr Baun at Puching differ from Himalayan examples in having ''a
much more forked tail, the outer feathers being &apos;35 inch longer than
the central feathers, instead of only &apos;15 inch. The red patch on the
wing is almost as rich, whilst the red on the outer webs of the two
innermost primaries is almost as pale as in Liothrix argentauris.
The tertials of the Chinese species are slaty green, like those of
Liothrix. argentauris, instead of being rufous green, and the general
colour of the upper parts is of a bluer green than in Liothrix
calipyga.&amp;quot;
Although some of the above-mentioned characters might pos-
sibly not be perfectly reliable, in a species which undoubtedly be-
comes more richly coloured as age advances ; it is highly probable
that the majority of them have a local value. My bird, though it
seems more nearly to approach the description of the Chinese than
the Indian bird, seems to be in some respects rather different from
either of them ; and might prove, if we knew its habitat, to repre-
sent another race of the species. It is probable that Chinese birds

the trivial name of " Japanese Robin. - '&amp;quot;&apos;
I asked Mr. Silver to try to discover the origin of the con-
signment in which my bird arrived, and he writes :--' I am sorry to
say that I cannot get reliable particulars concerning the batch of
Hill Tits, in which came our birds."
"Clarke, of Sydenham, selected them from a June consign-
ment at Luer's, of Walworth : I telephoned young Luer this evening
and he said they were all a Marseilles lot, but could not, of course,
say more about them. He promised me that if he can get any
further information from his Continental dealer, he will advise me
later."
Thus, for the present at any rate, we can get no nearer to the
origin of this interesting form.
Since, according to Darwin, common and widely-distributed
species vary most, it should surprise nobody to find, not two only,
but many local races, of the Red-billed Hill-Tit.
In conclusion, as one who, through over-zeal was tempted to
give a distinctive name to this Hill-Tit, let me caution my brother
aviculturists not to attempt to risk adding to the synonymy of
ornithological literature by naming and describing living birds. No
bird is reliable until it is dead, its plumage may change more or less
at any moult. In 1907 I described and figured what I believed, and
still believe, to be the insular form of Icterus vulgaris , chiefly relying
upon its pale colouring, as Ridg&apos;way did in the case of I. xanthornus
curasoensis, but, at its next moult it assumed the deeper colouring of
the typical Venezuelan form and recently even the naked blue triangle
behind the eye has partly extended above and below that organ ;
nevertheless the more slender build, the pure white wing-belt and
the considerably more varied song remain constant, t
The describer of skins may separate the adult and young of
the same bird as distinct species and has done so, but he is saved
the shock of seeing his work tumble to pieces in a few weeks ; on the
contrary his supposed new species may be accepted for years, and
* I suspect that the illustration in Bird Notes , Jan. 1907 ,was taken from a
Chinese bird.
f The pale yellow colouring in Icterus appears to be merely a sign of youth.

when the truth comes out nobody blames him, but woe to the man
who describes an unstable living model.
As aviculturists it is our duty to note the habits and the
changes of plumage in living birds, to clear up the inadvertent errors
of our brothers the cabinet-ornithologists ; not to give names to ap-
parently new forms : I regret that I did not realize this fact sooner.
The worst of it is, that even when an aviculturist has care-
fully noted the gradual development of a young bird into complete
adult plumage, and has thereby been able to link together two sup-
posed species without a shadow of doubt, the cabinet worker some-
times refuses to admit the identity of the two, but obstinately ignores
the published evidence : such treatment tempts the aviculturist to
overstep his legitimate territory and trespass upon that of the
museum-man : yet it is not wise to do so, it is far better to leave the
naming of doubtful and unsound forms to the student of skins, and
expend one's energies upon the more satisfactory and far safer study
of bird-life: doubtless when the life-histories of birds have been more
intimately studied, many supposed distinct species will prove to be
mere transitional plumages or seasonal phases.
When the startling differences which characterize the summer
and winter forms of many Butterflies were first made known and
proved, probably something approaching one quarter of the recog-
nized species among forms supposed to be nearly related had to sink
as seasonal phases. When I became convinced of the truth, I
immediately set to work to revise many genera, reducing not a few
of my own species to the rank of wet, intermediate, or dry phases.
. True science always seeks to make known the exact truth,
disregarding such frivolous questions as the sponsorship of species,
which (excepting that one must have names to know things by) is
less than nothing and vanity. When one has learned the correct
names of the different parts of any organism, the multiplication of
descriptions becomes almost a mechanical process. One has to
assure oneself that a species is new, by patient research, and des-
cribe it ; after that there is little more to be done in that branch of
zoological work, but living nature is always revealing something
fresh.

CAPTIVITY.
B. Theo. Stewart.
The pair of Abyssinian Great-billed or Thick-billed Raven
recently acquired by the Zoological Society aroused considerable
interest among Aviculturists. Very little appears to be generally
known concerning the habits, etc., of these remarkable birds, and
though my attention was called to a brief account published a short
time ago the narrative seems to me to suffer from a lack of personal
observation and experience.
Perhaps it is as well to say here that my bird was in my
possession before the advent of those mentioned above and was, I
believe, the only specimen in a private collection. I have kept
Ravens for years and quite fail to see the resemblance either in habits
or appearance between the Great-hilled Raven and the European
kind.
At the first glance the bird appears more brown than black.
It is larger than the common Raven, standing higher on the leg,
has a long neck and is more ungainly in shape- The white patch on
the lower part of the head, extending down the neck, has a curious
woolly look, just as to my thinking the bird has a negroid stare
about him altogether, intensified may be by the enormous arched
bill which is grooved at the sides, brown at the base, highly
polished and terminates in a white hook. The same white hook
by the way, when imbrued in blood, gives just the touch of colour
which is needed !
I will not pretend to answer the question as to why the
bird should own such an extraordinarily developed bill, but that it
serves whatever purpose nature intended it to I have no doubt. That
it is not the powerful offensive weapon casual observers believe and
stand in awe of, I have had my proof. It lacks the " power behind
the blow " of the knife-like appendage sported by its common
relative. The gentleman who is always dressed in black !
I have tested its capacity many times on my bare hands !

birds. I have no sympathy with those people (and how many there
are) who show such intense fear of the King of Crows. To he afraid
of any bird, vicious or otherwise, is an impossible state of affairs.
Owing to the conformation of the beak the bird usually bits
sideways and upwards ; and whittles away at wood much after the
manner of the parrot tribe. It can give a vicious pinch when so dis-
posed and also on occasion draw blood, but really nothing to speak of.
My own bird was a very fine specimen and his appearance excited
immense interest among the rural population. She was sent in a
large crate whose hieroglyphics greatly puzzled the natives. The one
who had the honour of delivering the greatest rarity of the age did so
in the following words :--&amp;quot; I have brought you-," here words
failed him and he glanced inside for information and tried again.
&amp;quot; I've brought the-," stuck once more and added desperately,
' Well, anyhow, I've brought it ! "
Toti " was believed to be a male, hut on examination I came
to the conclusion that she belonged to the mis-called gentle sex-- to
my infinite regret--for " the female of the species " does not greatly
appeal to me."
She protested violently, both with beak and claws on being
handled, croaked dismally while the rapidly changing expression
of the eyes showed her anger. She was I found though in fine
plumage in very poor condition and had a wound in her breast which
exposed the bone and bled freely. Truly she had " suffered a sea
change," and taking into account her value might have proved a
costly experiment, for the chance of her recovery was doubtful in
any but skilled hands, into which, happily for her, she had fallen-
I put her for a short time on a special diet, one that I have never
found to fail, and she speedily improved. The wound healed slowly
(once she reopened it in a blind rage), hut she soon showed a change
for the better in all respects. She was very shy hut not at all
vicious and would take food from the hand very nicely. A most
intelligent companion, finding her way about the place in a very
short time. She felt tire cold intensely and her " private house " was
always kept at a fairly high temperature. When let out for a run
she showed an intense desire to fly up, failing this she jumped, and
being a heavy bird she did considerable damage in this way. I fed

her largely on fish, of which she is very fond, and fresh raw meat
cut up rather finely.
It is a popular error that Ravens love carrion. Whatever
they may do in a state of nature from necessity, in captivity they
show no such inclination. My experience of these birds is a very
large one and in every instance tainted meat was invariably
rejected in favour of fresh. " Toti " used to dip his meat in water--
another old favourite rubbed his in earth.
In regard to fruit, of which the Great-hilled Raven is said to
he fond, all I can say is that 11 Toti " had a choice of figs, grapes,
bananas, dates, etc., and always ignored them. Neither would she
touch any small insects, though once she swallowed a spider, by
mistake I fancy, as she was yawning ! I once put a large black slug
in her bowl, she was immensely interested, carefully lifted it out in
her powerful (?) bill and gently placed it uninjured on the side of her
cage watching it creep away with evident pleasure.
Toti " was not a large eater by any means. All food not
immediately disposed of she carried about carefully concealed and
when irritated by the presence of strangers she had a pleasing habit
of disgorging it much to their edification. I should have much liked
to illustrate this article with some photographs of the bird with a
beak, believing as I do that the illustration is always the best thing
in any article. My reason for not doing so is best expressed in the
Spanish saying, " Sahe el cuervo mas que el hombre."

At my home in the Scilly Isles, immediately in front of the
house, divided only by two garden terraces, lies an enclosure of grass
land which verges on to a fairly large piece of fresh water. Beyond
that, the ground slopes slightly upwards where big stretches of bracken
and gorse finally almost meet the sea-shore, -from which the fine
white sand blows inland, covering the coarse bent and grass, whirled
about and heaped up by the big gales which sweep over the Atlantic.
Here amongst giant boulders, the Wheatears have their homes,

nesting, too, in rabbit burrows and stone walls ; and the charming
little Stonechats perch on the summits of the gorse bushes. In the
distance, from the windows, the different islands stud the sea's sur-
face, and&apos;the big liners go on their way to and fro from England to
America and hack, beyond the furthest rocks, on the open ocean.
On the grass enclosure which leads to the big pool--and the latter is
not fifty yards from the house--a pair of Sarus Cranes, some Rheas,
etc. walk about, whilst mingling with them when they leave the
water, are several species of ducks and geese.
Out on the pool, big companies of Gulls assemble--Herring,
Great, and Lesser Black hacks--enjoying the fresh water for bathing,
afterwards flocking on the grass land on the farther shore to preen
and dry their feathers ; 200 and 300 together, sometimes giving the
appearance of a big patch of snow. Their laughing cries ring
through the air when they disperse seawards, whilst an occasional
Cormorant flops on to the water to regale itself on eels.
Since the latter part of October (1912) ten wild White-
fronted Geese have been living with the various tame Waterfowl,
within a stone's throw of the windows of the house. It appears to
me an extraordinary thing how soon wild geese become tame, and I
wonder if they were left in peace whether they would do so else-
where as they do here. [I am writing in January].
We have several times, in other winters, had odd White-
fronted Geese which took up their abode in the field with the other
birds, which are pinioned, hut I have never seen so many together
making themselves completely at home for so long a time. The
paddock is quite a small one, but they pay no attention when one
walks across, and continue busily eating grass, allowing one to
approach within ten yards of them, one bird only, who is apparently
acting as a sentinel, putting up his head to see that all is well.
Even when wild duck shooting is going on, they pay little
heed, only rising on the wing to circle round for a few minutes, after
which they return to their grazing, or settle on a flat swampy green
close by. There were twelve of these wild geese when they first
arrived from the far north for the winter, but they foolishly flew
over to one of the other islands, from whence they returned
reduced to ten. The fate of the other two was pretty certain, for

two gun shots were heard in the distance ! Now they seem to
realise that they are safer where they are, and never wander very
far. Their wild cries when they rise on the wing and circle round
are delightful to hear. A few years ago a White-fronted Goose was
taken, for it was so tame that a boy threw a stone at it, and by so
doing, captured it ; after which it was pinioned and turned out with
the other waterfowl, where it is still living happily with its Chinese
and Canadian cousins, being quite as tame as they are.
About three or four years ago a Greylag Goose was caught in
much the same way. It took a fancy to the Toulouse geese at the
farm, and was calmly driven into a wire enclosure, when it too was
pinioned, and, as the story hooks say, has lived happily ever after.
I may say that there are no foxes on the island, so that any
kind of waterfowl can be kept on the grass paddock and on the Pool,
beyond which they have the run of the sandbanks, of which the
Shelduck are especially fond, and the wild Widgeon and Pochards
come ashore to feed with the tame ducks.
A few years ago, six or seven Greylag Geese used to come and
feed in the field, and we set up various contrivances with nooses of
string to try to catch them, hut they were too wary and flew away
after a stay of a few weeks.
In March I expect that the White-fronted Geese will also
disappear and fly to their nesting-home in the far north : but in the
meanwhile they will have afforded great pleasure with much interest,
and I have hopes that it will he a case of au revoir.
[We hope Miss Dorrien-Smith will kindly continue to contribute
interesting notes and articles upon birds to be observed in the Scillv Isles.
Mr. Pycraft gives some information of interest with regard to the wild
" Grey " Geese in Section X of " The British Bird Book," p. 163, etc.
He writes : -- ''More than a hundred years ago, perhaps a hundred and
&amp;quot;fifty would be nearer the mark, the Greylag Goose bred in numbers in our
&amp;quot; English fens, where the young were annually taken and kept in a more or
" less reclaimed condition with vast flocks of tame geese, which, it may
" be remarked, are a domesticated race of this species."
"Darwin, in commenting on this fact, remarks that though the
"reclamation of the Greylag must date back to very remote times, yet
' ' scarcely any animal which has been tamed for so long a period has varied
" so little, for, save in the case of the white race, these domesticated birds-
"differ but slightly from the wild stock."

" That the Greylag and the White-fronted Geese are near allies, there can
" be no doubt, indeed the latter seem positively to have been derived from the
" former, since it is distinguished therefrom in its exaggeration of features,
" which in the Greylag might almost escape notice. For it will be remembered
"that the Graylag shows a more or less distinct line of white round the base
" of the beak, and indistinct black bars on the chest."
Nothing is really known with regard to the breeding of the White-
fronted Goose in the Arctic regions, although its nest and eggs have been often
taken.
Mr. Pycraft continues :-- " Trevor-Battye, however, lifts the veil, so to
" speak, for a moment, in his most interesting book, ' Icebound on Kolguev,'

In the Don steppes, Alpheraky says he has flushed these geese in
swarms of tens of thousands ; but having once risen, the hosts immediately
broke up into comparatively small flocks, and flew off, one after the other,
either to another part of the steppe or to water, uttering all the time their
loud laughing cackle.
It is refreshing to know that one of these little companies has, in the

for publication, I will begin with some mention of a pair of Bulbuls
which are in my possession, hoping that some other Member may
supply more information about them and especially about the chances
of breeding them.
My Bulbuls were privately imported several years ago from
Syria or Palestine, and were in the possession of Dr. B. who kindly
allowed me to see them. He kept them in his bedroom where they
flew about from one article of furniture to another and seemed
fairly tame. The room was spacious, but neither light nor airy,
and I wondered that they kept in such good condition. After the

doctor's death, they passed into the hands of a friend of mine who
placed them in his aviary, where they occasionally brained some of
the small exotic Finches. He then presented them to me and I
have now had them for three or four years. They are delightful
birds, so bright and nimble, and though soberly clad, are elegantly
shaped and keep themselves in perfect trim.
They are very lively, and occasionally slip out of their cage,
and then it is a regular game of hide and seek. They fly about
perching on my head or on my finger, pecking it viciously, but with-
out allowing themselves to be caught and chattering all the time
like angry sparrows. Then they unexpectedly disappear and it is
impossible to find them, when suddenly they dart out of their
hiding place and seem to mock me. One day after seeking one in
vain for a long time I found him at the bottom of an empty
water pail under a table, where he crouched so flatly that it was
difficult to see him.
I keep them in a large cage with a movable partition ; some-
times they live peacefully together, while at times they fight and
have to be separted. They look perfectly alike in size, shape and
colour, and until last spring I thought they were two cocks, but one
day one of them seemed very puffy and altogether ailing. Its
former owner advised me to remove the partition and allow the birds
to be together saying that the little creature was melancholy and
wanted to be with its companion. I followed his advice and the
birds flew to each other and petted each other affectionately. Alas !
in less than an hour's time one of them was crouching half dead at
the bottom of the cage and a heap of feathers littered the floor.
It was so badly hurt that I thought it would die before the end of
the day, but applications of Pond's Extract of Hamamelis healed
its poor little inflamed head, and the very next day (18th March) to
my surprise, it laid an egg. After this it gradually recovered and in
time clothed itself with new feathers ; the wing feathers had all
been plucked off.
On the 17th of April it laid a second egg, and it contined to
lay during May and June no less than eighteen eggs. I tried
different kinds of nests, placed heather, grass, hay, etc. in the cage,
but it preferred to drop the eggs from the perch, consequently breaking

them. It amused itself with the nesting materials, sometimes filling
its bath with them, but showed no disposition to build and still less
to sit. The eggs are dark with purplish stains as if they had been
dipped in red wine. I would like to try the birds in an aviary but
am afraid of the cock murdering the hen. Can some Member tell
me if Bulbuls have ever bred in captivity and under what circum-
stances ? As spring is drawing near I would like to make the
attempt if possible.
My Bulbuls are fed with bread and milk, fruit and some seed
with an occasional meal-worm of which the cock is very fond, while
the hen rarely touches them. They are very fond of the kernels of the
stone-pine and of cherries, also of pears. They are very intelligent
and their bright dark eyes are always on the look out for some
dainty. They moult very quickly, one day their head is bare and
two or three days after it is covered with dark velvety feathers,
Their song is by no means that of a Nightingale, but they have some
fine liquid notes, and they chatter a good deal whenever I go near
them and come to peck my fingers with open wings and spread-out
tails. If I had more time to give them I think they would become
very tame and as amusing as my lost pet, my Ciroquita (Sturnus
atricjularis) of which charming bird I will tell another time.

Chloephaga antarctica.
By F. E. Blaauw, C.M.Z.S.
During a trip which I took in February, 1911, to Southern
Chile, I had the pleasure of seeing a good many Antarctic Geese on
the rocks by the water's edge in Smith's channel, etc., and north-
wards as far as the southern coast of the Island of Chiloe.
The birds w T ere generally seen in pairs, the white male being
very conspicuous, whilst it was more difficult to see the female which
is blackish brown in colour. On the rocks round the coast of
Ascension, the most northern island of the Chonos Archipelago,
these birds were particularly numerous, and I occasionally saw as
many as seven together. It so happened that the ship which

carried me had to take in some timber at Melinka, which is the
little port of that island, and this gave me an opportunity of
landing.
Walking cautiously along the sea shore I soon found myself
in close proximity to some Antarctic Geese, which were much tamer
than I expected. One pair of these birds in particular which were
standing on a rock close to the village, allowed me to admire them
from a very short distance. This species of goose is stouter and
more robustly built than the other members of the genus ; and the
dazzling white male bird with its lemon coloured legs and feet, large
black eyes and black bill, was a most beautiful object. The female
is chocolate brown, barred with white on the breast, the shoulders,
back and tail are white, the bill is flesh coloured, the legs and feet
pale yellow, while a yellowish ring encircles the eyes.
One of the natives, seeing that I was interested in the Kelp
Geese, told me that he knew of a young bird in confinement and
proposed that I should go and see it, which of course I did, and
there sure enough in a garden surrounded by a palisade, I found the
young goose, trying to hide itself. The owner was quite ready to
sell it, and although I was fully aware of the difficulties that would
beset me if I tried to bring the bird home, I could not resist the
temptation to do so. A little wooden box was procured and when I
handled the bird as I was putting it in, I noticed, to my dismay,
that it was as light as a feather !
On my asking how it had been fed, I was told " It will feed
on anything but you must not forget to give him Lutsche." Now
Lutsche is a kind of Kelp or seaweed which grows on the rocks in
the southern part of Chile and on which the Geese feed. This is a
thing easily procurable in the Chonos Archipelago, but decidedly
difficult to obtain anywhere else except, perhaps, in Santiago, where
it is sold in a dried state as human food. A provision of Lutsche
was put in the box with the goose and it was taken to the ship.
Here my first difficulty began, for the box was too small to keep it
in for any length of time and I did not know where else to put it.
Fortunately the Captain was a kind man and, seeing my difficulty,
he suggested that I should keep it in an empty dog kennel of his on
the bridge of the vessel. This proposal I gladly accepted and the

Mr. F. E. Blaauw,
goose after haying been put in, at once retired to the furthest
corner of the kennel. I then gave it a tin in which was water,
bread and Lutsche ; the first day it hardly fed at all, but on the
second it began to eat the Kelp, carefully avoiding the bread. This,
of course, would not do, so I mixed the bread and the Kelp thor-
oughly together, so that it would be difficult for the bird to eat the
one without the other, and after a few days my efforts were rewarded,
for the bird began to feed on the bread without the addition of
the Kelp.
Of course, during these first few days I paid constant visits
to my Goose, and when at last I saw it eating the bread, I was so
delighted that I could not help telling my friend the Captain of this
event, as he had been much interested in my bird all the time.
He immediately came to look and found the Goose still
eating. He, however, being a gigantic Norseman and accustomed to
eat things by the bushel, thought the nibbling of the bird at the
breadcrumbs in the water a very unsatisfactory way of feeding, and
having watched for awhile, he turned away in disgust, saying
depreciatingly "I should call that drinking, not eating!"
Happening to go on shore again, I obtained some fresh clover
and green cabbage, and after a while the bird began to feed on both.
High time too that it should, as the supply of Kelp was quite
exhausted. In the meanwhile my Goose had become quite tame.
After a voyage of a week I reached Coronel where I had to leave
the ship and travel by train to Santiago.
Now the difficulties began in earnest, and I was encouraged
by a kind friend who knew the country, who told me that if by
chance I should succeed in getting the Goose to Santiago in my
compartment, I should certainly fail in carrying it over the Andes to
Buenos Ayres ! Putting it with my luggage would have meant its
certain death, for it would have been thrown about as luggage
generally is, whilst at the same time I should have been unable to
feed it.
I left the ship at Coronel early in the morning, where I
admired a flight of Pelicans in the harbour, and started by train for
Conception, having successfully, without much difficulty, put the
box with the Goose into my compartment. Spending the day in

Conception, I left the bird at the railway station, and in the evening
took the night express to Santiago. The guard of the train kicked
up a shindy (as the English say) on finding the Goose in my
compartment, but fortunately some fellow travellers prevailed upon
him to overlook my unusual and illegal piece of baggage.
Arriving safely at Santiago on the following morning, I
happened to go to a hotel, the manager oi which was fortunately
kindly disposed towards birds, and he promised to procure me a
large box in -which the Goose could be placed. Unluckily, in Chile,
the final accomplishment of a promise is apt to take place some con-
siderable time after the promise itself, and as the poor Goose had to he
freed from its very confined quarters in the small box, I had to turn
it out in a corner of the room, where it could rest and feed, both of
which it did, rather to my surprise, living alternately in the box and
in the room for three days, after which the promised box of larger
dimensions arrived.
The next night found me en route for Buenos Ayres by the
Trans-Andean Railway, and I had to pass the night at Los Andes,
where I had the greatest difficulty in getting my luggage and the
Goose to the hotel, as there was nothing in the shape of porters, hut
some diminutive boys, as is usual in Chile. Carrying the Goose, along
with some other birds, I tumbled over a deep open drain just in
front of the hotel which was in a dark street with no light. Luckily
the Goose w T as none the worse, which was more than I could
congratulate myself on, but I reached the hotel with my belongings.
Next morning I left for the Andes in a train starting at nine
o'clock, and found it crowded with passengers, so that I began to
despair as to whether I should be able to take the Goose in my
compartment, but my difficulty was overcome through the courtesy
of a German official who found me a place in a second-class
compartment which was fairly empty.
Except for having to tip the train guard an occasional 'peso'
when he came to say that birds were not allowed in a passengers'
compartment (and these officials seemed to be gifted with second
sight for discovering my goose in a box which was all but closed up),
I had no more trouble until I arrived at Puente del Inca (Argentine)
when a fresh official boarded the train and insisted upon my poor

Goose being transferred to the luggage van. Now this might not
have been so bad in itself, were it not for the irritating habit that
the officials have in that part of the world, of apparently, purposely,
turning every piece of luggage upside down, which would have been
very disastrous for the Goose ! With the assistance of some ' pesos '
(there is no doubt that money rules the world! ) the bird was
handled fairly carefully, and at one o'clock in the night I arrived at
Mendoza where a sleeping car awaited me for the continuation of
my journey to Buenos Ayres, and there I secured my Goose in its
box and carried it into my compartment, in spite of a great outcry,
but a friendly German, who spoke Spanish fluently, saved the
situation, and I am sure his lie was forgiven him, by firmly declaring
that I had a special permission, and the Goose was all right so far,
hut next morning it had to he taken out of the box to let it feed, and
whilst its breakfast was in progress, who should come in but the
ticket collector who at once made a great outcry at the presence of
the Goose in the compartment, whilst I, in my turn, retorted and
argued that as I was paying for the whole compartment I had a
perfect right to take the goose there if I chose, and that it was no
one else's business ! I carried my point so far that the man went
away swearing that he would have his revenge when we reached
Buenos Ayres, but I comforted myself by thinking that once there
I could manage to get through somehow or other.
So the Goose and I travelled peacefully after that to Buenos
Ayres, arriving after midnight ; but hardly had I stepped out of the
train when three ferocious-looking officials informed me that I must
go to an official in the railway station, leave the Goose, and return
in the morning and explain matters.
This of course would never do !
My German friend, who spoke Spanish so fluently, and who
had already assisted me, again most kindly came to the fore and to
my rescue, with the residt that I was permitted to take the Goose
away with me by paying eight 1 pesos,' which I did not, under the
circumstances, begrudge : and at one-thirty a.m. I arrived at my
hotel with my luggage and my birds.
Next morning, after much difficulty a place was found on a
terrace on the flat roof of the house for my Goose, and it was put

into a large open case provided for the purpose, in which the bird
passed four days fairly contentedly.
On the 1st of May the bird was transferred on board the
steamship Zeelandia, when the final stage of its journey to Europe
commenced in a hen house which happened to be on the bridge of
the vessel. The Goose was the chief attraction of my menagerie
which I was bringing to Europe. The collection included a beautiful
specimen of Phrygians princetonianus, which I had caught in Terra
del Fuego ; a pair of long-billed Parrakeets (Henicognathus leptor-
hynchus), which I had brought from Puerto Varas--on the Lake of
Llanquihue, and thirty other birds which I had bought in Buenos
Ayres.
I had taken a sackful of green cabbages on board, as a
supply of food for the Antarctic Goose, which I hoped would last as
far as Lisbon, but the hot weather caused it to last for a shorter time
than I had anticipated, so that it was fortunate that I had a supply
of dried Lutsche, or Kelp, to fall back upon ; which I had brought
from Santiago, and which when soaked in water for about an hour,
looked almost as good as new, and the Goose ate it greedily.
When the ship w T as in the neighbourhood of the Equator, the
bird seemed somewhat unhappy, but it fed well all the time, and
some white feathers began to put in an appearance on its body.
The legs also became much more yellow in colour.
On reaching Lisbon I was able to get a fresh supply of green
vegetables, and on the 29th May, I had the great satisfaction of
landing my bird safely at Amsterdam, and of settling him in his
Dutch home at Gooilust on the same day.

During the past summer, two pairs of Lesser Pintailed Sand-
grouse ( Pteroclurus exustus ) that I obtained from Mr. Barnby Smith
nested and reared their young in our aviaries. The first pair laid
the end of April and hatched two of their three eggs on the twenty-
third day. These young w 7 ere successfully reared almost entirely on
maw seed, as there were no small seeds of wild weeds sufficiently up

to be of any use at this early date. The second pair nested later,
hatching their three egg&apos;s early in July. Of these two were reared,
incubation in this case only taking 18--19 days.
The procedure of these birds is precisely the same as the
Greater Pintailed Sandgrouse (. Pteroclurus alchata), viz., the female
incubates by day, the male by night, and the male soaks his breast
with water for the young to drink or rather suck. There is, how-
ever, no remarkable change of plumage in P. exustus in the breeding
season ; also, while P. alchata is a great eater of green food, P.
exustus scarcely touches it.
A very old pair of Greater Pintailed Sandgrouse nested and
reared two fine young cocks. This was unfortunate, as I have now
only one very old hen and plenty of beautiful vigorous cocks, so
unless I can procure some females, my Sandgrouse are in danger of
coming to an end, after having been maintained practically in one
unbroken family for twenty years.
I do not remember to have seen the display of the cock Blue
Crowned Hanging Parrot (. Loriculus galgulus) described, it is rather
remarkable. The little male commences by marching backwards and
forwards on a branch nodding his head; he then draws all the feathers
of his head and neck quite tight, with the exception of the crimson
gorget which stands out in a bunch. The scarlet upper tail-coverts
and scarlet feathers of the rump and lower back are then raised up,
sometimes into one point, sometimes two ; it is a wonderful example
of making the most of himself. A pair, which we have had for
six years, were most determined sitters, the hen sitting practi-
cally from April to August, but with no result. The nest is built
deep in a hole of an apple tree of green strips of Aucuba leaves, the
strips when cut off being conveyed into the nesting-hole by being
inserted into the upper tail-coverts and feathers of the rump. The
little hen looks very strange flying into her nest with a bunch of
green leaves trailing behind her. The female is much larger than
the male, and the latter does not get any of his colour until two
years old, and not the full colour until four years.
The Waterfowl here can scarcely be considered in confine-
ment, as beyond being fed they are quite unenclosed and look after
themselves. We have a great mortality from foxes, and to lessen

this as much as possible many are full-winged and many are half
pinioned, about four primary feathers being taken off so that they
can get up and fly pretty well, but it is too laborious a business to
make them want to migrate.
A pair of half-pinioned Gargany Teal went away and success-
fully reared eight young ones, all of which flew away in September.
Pintails, Gadwall, Wig&apos;eon, reared their young. Many Pochards
were reared, and the full-winged Mandarins did very well, but not so
well as in 1911. They have extended their range a good deal, and I
hear of them some miles away, but they are very secretive and show
very little, and in this country frequent the most thickly-wooded
ponds and pits. Ours practically keep to themselves, rarely coming
to feed with other ducks. A very few have been accidentally shot, I
have eaten them. They are quite eatable, but I should not call them
a good duck ; anyhow a male in full plumage seems far too beautiful
to pluck and cook !
THE HOODED PARRAKEET.
Psephotus dissimilis (Collett).
By Gregory M. Mathews.
The last number of this Magazine (p. 108) contained a note
regarding P. cucullatus (North) and P. chrysopterygius (Gould) by
Mr. Hubert D. Astley.
As there is much of interest in connection with these birds, I
offer the following remarks : -- When Gould published the beautiful
plate of Psephotus chrysopterygius in the Birds of Australia, Sup-
plement Plate 64, he wrote : " One of the greatest pleasures enjoyed
by the late celebrated botanist, Robert Brown, during the last thirty
years of his life, was to now and then exhibit the drawing of a
parrot, made by one of the brothers Bauer from a specimen pro-
cured somewhere on the north coast of Australia, but of which no
specimen was preserved at the time, and none had since been
brought to England. It afforded him at times much amusement
to exultingly show me this drawing as a bird I could not find, and
which I had not included in my great work on the birds of that

country. Now the only way in which I could meet this kind of
half-taunt from my friend was to remark that I should get it some
day or other ; and I certainly did exult when I received an example
from the hands of Mr. Elsey, a year or two prior to Mr. Brown's
death. On comparing the bird with the drawing, made at least
forty years before, they proved to be so much alike that no douht
remained in my mind as to its having been made from an example
of this species."
In the Natural History Department of the British Museum,
the drawing referred to by Gould is still preserved, as is also the
manuscript description drawn up by Robert Brown at the time the
bird was procured.
In Blinder's Yoy. Terra Austr., Vol. II., 1844, p. 226, it is
recorded that at Melville Bay on Feb. 16th, 1803, "A beautiful
species of paroquet not known at Port Jackson was procured." It
may be that this refers to this bird as though most of Brown's
manuscript bears accurate localities and dates, this one unfortu-
nately only gives " M. ora. septentrionali."
This painting is a most beautiful and accurate one of P. dis-
similis (Collett), and differs in many details from P. chrysopterygius.
Gould noted this, as can be gathered from the last sentence ; but
the wish to refute Brown probably caused him to minimise such
differences.
Over ninety years after Brown met with this bird, it was
again collected on the Mary River Northern Territory on May 9th,
1895, by Dr. Dahl. This specimen was described by the late Dr.
Collett in the Proe. Zool. Soc. (Lond.) 1898, p. 356, under the name
Psepliotus dissimilis. The description reads : " Forehead, lores, and
crown dark chestnut ," but this is a pure mistake, those parts being
black. This is written from an examination of the type specimen
which is now in my collection at Watford.
Through this erroneous description the bird was redescribed
twice afterwards.
A consignment of these birds was brought to Europe via
Sydney some ten years afterwards. While in Sydney they were
examined by Mr. North of the Australia Museum, Sydney, who,
noting them as new, described a specimen in the Victorian Naturalist,

Yol. XXV., p. 176, 1909, under the name P. cucullatus , giving as
the vernacular, Black-hooded Parrakeet.
After the birds came to Europe Mr. Blaauw, the well-known
aviculturist, bought some ; and Mr. Van Oort examining them, also
considered them new, knowing nothing of North's action, and re-
named the form P. chrysopterygius hlaauwi in the Notes Leyden
Mus., Yol. XXXII., p. 71, 1910.
In the preparation of my Reference List of the Birds of Aus-
tralia (Nov. Zool., Yol. XVIII., 1912) it was necessary to examine
and compare all the types available. It was obvious that North's bird
was the same as Van Oort's, and Mr. \ T an Oort kindly lent me his
type, which was carefully compared by me with Dr. Collett's type
and found absolutely identical. Consequently the three names all
refer to the same bird, and as Dr. Collett's is the earliest proposed it
must be used. As regards the vernacular, however, the well-known
name of Hooded Parrakeet can be retained.
Therefore, Psephotus dissimilis (Collett) can he still called the
Hooded Parrakeet, though North's name, P. cucullatus, must he
dropped, as well as Van Oort's P. c. hlaauwi.
[We are glad to have this matter made clear. Museum naturalists
often speak as if all points were sure when once the skin of a bird is in the
hand, and are inclined to be over-sceptical with regard to one in the hush.
Aviculturists may comfort themselves they are not the only ones at fault !

Last month I reported that the pair of Kolbe's Vultures,
which occupy the large central aviary in the range devoted to the
Birds of Prey, were busily incubating their single egg. Incubation
commenced on December 20th last, the birds taking turns in the
duty of sitting. On February 12th, fifty-four days later, when
we had almost given up all hope of a result, the egg hatched,
revealing a chick covered with browish-white down, with a soft beak
shaped exactly as in the adults. Two days later, however, both birds
were seen off the nest, and a search being made for the chick, only
its head and neck were found, its body having been eaten, apparently

A great disappointment after having actually hatched a chick. Next
time it may he advisable to take the egg away shortly before it is
due to hatch and place it in an incubator and attempt to hand-rear
the young bird.
The Brush-turkeys have been transferred to a new enclosure,
formed by wiring in a fairly large piece of the canal bank at the
western end of the North Garden, and the stock Iras been increased
by the addition of four birds, presented by the Duke of Bedford,
President of the Zoological Society. They should do well in this
enclosure, where they will have ample opportunity of constructing
their nesting mounds. D. S-S.
EDITORIAL.
Several members have kindly promised, in response to my
appeal, to send articles and notes for the Magazine; but I still want
more ' copy,' so that I need not as Editor live, as it were, from hand
to mouth ; begging my way along the hard high road from month to
month, with only just enough, and perhaps sometimes barely that,
to keep me going. I ought not to have to go out into the highways
and the hedges, I ought not to be forced to knock at members' doors
to tell them I have not sufficient to last me out; or, worse still, to
receive so meagre a supply that I must hurriedly pick up what I can
on my own account.
And besides food for the Magazine, I want money. Money
beyond the yearly subscriptions; for otherwise our illustrations
cannot be what they should. Let me have sufficient for the
Treasurer -- Mr. THOMASSET, who has kindly undertaken that office
-- sufficient for him to write : " We can afford a coloured frontispiece
every month." Quite small sums add up into big ones, and some
members can give larger ones straight away. The officers of the
Society are unpaid, so that those who have kindly given in the past
to an Editor's stipend, can transfer that money to other expenses
which are necessarily incurred.
Let us all work to keep up the standard of our Magazine, and
remember that the Avicultural Society was founded for "the study

that those who have opportunities of observing wild life amongst

At a meeting&apos; of the Council held on February 7th, the
appointment by the Executive Committee of Mr. H. D. Astley as
Editor of the Magazine was confirmed and Mr. B. Thomasset was
elected Treasurer, the two vacancies being caused by the retirement
of Mr. Bonhote, as announced in the January issue of the Magazine.
A cordial vote of thanks to Mr. Bonhote for his past services to the
Society was unanimously passed.

THE MOULT OP IMMATURE BLACK REDSTARTS.
SIR,--I am interested in Mr. W. E. Teschemaker's letter in the last issue
on the moult of the Black Redstart (not Blackstart please ! a lazy abbreviation
which is not only incorrect, but might be misleading), but do not quite under-
stand what he means by his "eclipse plumage at their first autumn moult."
The young after the first autumn moult ( i.e . in first winter plumage) are darker,
as Mr. Teschemaker points out, than the adult female in nest feather (i.e. in
breeding plumage) ; this is because the latter's plumage is worn and faded,
whereas that of the bird in autumn is fresh. Mr. Teschemaker refers to the
spring moult of this species ; so far as I am aware the Black Redstart, like the
common Redstart, has no spring moult.

The sequence of plumages in this species I believe to be the following : --

<listItem confidence="0.951697529411765">
1. Down plumage present in hatching.
2. Juvenile plumage acquired whilst in the nest, also called nestling plumage.
3. First winter plumage acquired by moult of body feathers at the first
autumnal moult. The bird is now in the brown dress.
4. First summer plumage (the same feathers as first winter) and allowing for
abrasion and fading resembles the winter plumage. In this dress the
bird was described by M. Gerbe as a new species and called by him
Ruticilla cairii ; many individuals nest in this plumage.
5. Second winter plumage acquired by a complete moult, and the males now
become really black on the breast for the first time, As there is a
considerable variation-of plumage in "black" winter males it is possible
that they may take another year or even more to attain perfect adult
plumage. Here is an opportunity for aviculturists to decide this point.
6. Second summer plumage resembles the second winter plumage, allowing for
abrasion and fading, there being no moult.

THE CAPE LONG-TAILED Sunbird {Promerops cafer). Total length
19&apos;5 inches, of which the tail is 14 inches in the adult male.
The Amethyst Sunbird ( Cinnyris .amethystinus) a most beautiful
species. Emerald green crown. Rose-lilac gorget and upper tail coverts.
Body, deep violet black, Total length 5&apos;3 inches.
A third species which has been brought safely to England is the lovely
South African WEDGE-TAILED SUNBIRD (. Anthrobaphes violacea). The total
length of adult male 6'5 inches, of which the tail occupies 3&apos;3 inches. Head,
neck and uppermost portion of back and wing-coverts, deep metallic green ;
gorget, metallic green, shading into lilac and steel-blue; underparts, yellow,
strongly washed with orange red on the front of the chest and on the tail-coverts.
A lighter yellow pectoral tuft at the shoulders.
Mr. Owen is to be congratulated upon the importation and possession
of these beautiful Sunbirds. H. D. A.

THE GARDENER BOWER BIRD.
Amblyornis inornata.
By Hubert D. Astley, M.A., etc.
" Inornata " !! What a title ! Imagine a thick-set bird,

<bodyText confidence="0.989528681818182" page_id="32655015"  page_num="Page 157" year="" vol="">
rather larger than a fine Song Thrush, of a rich golden brown,
which lightens to a more delicate shade on the underparts, and the
male with his resplendent and shining crown of pure gold, i.e. of
brilliant orange. He should have been called ' coronata ' or some-
thing which told of his wondrous skill and love of a garden, but
'inornata'!! He is no more that than a peacock.
Of course there was a mistake, and this most interesting bird
must have been described and named from the female, and thus this
utterly misguiding title sticks to him. Give a bird a bad name, and
it seems to do so. Of making these names there is no end, and
very often no end to their inappropriateness !
Baron von Rosenberg first discovered this wonderful creature,
and Dr. Beccari published a description ; apparently of the female
only, or of an immature male, which description was afterwards
published in the Gardener's Chronicle [that was appropriate at any
rate] of March the 6th, 1878.
Amongst other things, he wrote, We were on the projecting
" spur of Mount Arfac (New Guinea). The virgin forest was very
" beautiful. Scarcely a ray of sunshine penetrated the branches.
" The ground was almost destitute of vegetation. I found here a
" new Balanophora, like a small orange or a small fungus. I was
" distracted by the songs and screams of new birds ; and every turn

Mr. Hubert D. Astley,
" in the path showed me something new and surprising. I had just
" killed a small new Marsupial that balanced itself on the stem of a
great tree, like a squirrel: and turning round, I suddenly stood
" before me a most remarkable specimen of the industry of an animal.
" It was a hut or bower close to a small meadow enamelled with
" flowers."
" The whole was on a diminutive scale " (compared with a
hut for human habitation). "I immediately recognized the famous
*' nests described by the hunters of Bruijn."
" We had reached the height of about 4800 feet."
" I had now full enjoyment in the preparation of my treasure ;
" and I gave orders to my people not to shoot many of the birds.
" The bower I had first seen was the nearest to my halting place.
" While I was there, neither host nor hostess was at home. I could
" not wait for them. My hunters saw them coming and going out,
" when they watched their movements to shoot them."
" The Amblyornis selects a flat even place round the trunk of
" a small tree that is as thick as a walking stick. It begins by con-
" structing a kind of cone chiefly of moss of the size of a man's
" hand, at the base of the sapling. The trunk becomes the central
"pillar; and the whole building is supported by it. On the top of
" the central pillar, twigs are then placed methodically in a radiating
" manner, resting on the ground, leaving an aperture for the entrance.
" Thus is obtained a conical and very regular hut. Many other
" branches are placed transversely in various ways to make the
" whole quite firm and impermeable. A circular gallery is left
" between the cone of moss and the outer walls. The whole is
" nearly three feet in diameter."
" Before the cottage there is a meadow of moss. This is
" brought to the spot and kept free from grass, stones, or anything
" that would offend the eye. On this green tuft, flowers and fruits
" of pretty colours are placed so as to form an elegant little garden.
" The objects are very various, but always of vivid colour. There
" were some fruits of a Garcinia, like a small apple. Others were
" the fruits of Gardenias of a deep yellow colour in the interior. I
" saw also small rosy fruits, and beautiful rosy flowers of a splendid
" new Vaccinium ( Agapetes amblyornithis )--[named after the bird,

" who first discovered it! ! Editor] . There were also fungi and
" mottled insects placed on the turf. As soon as the objects are
" faded they are moved away."
Mr. Sharpe says that the form of the playing-ground, as
given by Mr. Goodwin, is totally different from that sketched by
Dr. Beccari.
Fully adult males, with the orange crest, have been received
by Mr. Walter Rothschild, not only from Arfak, but from the Owen
Stanley Mountains in S.E. New Guinea.
There are at any rate two other species, which closely re-
semble Amhlyornis inornata, and they are A. subalaris and A.
flavifrons ; the latter having been discovered in Dutch New Guinea,
but as our Magazine is for the aid and benefit of aviculturists and
not so much for those who sit on desks all day in Museums, peering
at skins flattened out, stuffed with antiseptic wool, minus eyes, and
with discoloured feet and beaks, I will not burden our members
with too many details of sub-species and inappropriate nomenclature.
I take it that the artistic side of bird-life appeals to them more
strongly ; along with, where possible, the gathering in of knowledge
from those who by experience are able to tell of the birds in life,
with their habits, their food, and their many interesting ways of
living. We do not decry Museums and bird-skins which are col-
lected for scientific researches, it is merely that life appeals to us
more than death, that when the spirit of the bird has departed from
the body seeking pastures new, that bunch of feathers can no
longer attract us aviculturists, indeed more often than not we sit
down and weep ! It was the life we loved, the agility, the daily
cleansing of those feathers in bath and pool and stream, the call
notes and the songs ringing in our ears, the putting on and putting
off of many a coloured plume, the nesting and the broods, and all
that goes to make up life.
And so, although we must needs pay our debt of gratitude to
those who have collected as skins what we would fain have had as
pets, we aviculturists have our moments when we shrink from the
idea of killing : for honestly, had I been the first to look upon that
marvellous work of the Gardener Bower Bird, I know full well that
I could not have brought myself to shoot the builders of the huts

and the gatherers of the gardens. " Mere mawkish sentiment " I
hear our ornithologists of science retort! But life is made up of
sentiment, and sentiment produces those miniature huts with their
surrounding parterres of fruit and blossom.
People talk of human reasoning and the lower animals'
instinct, but although their brain power is not as highly developed
as our's, yet they along their own lines reason also. Just as well
might it be argued that because we do certain things according to
regular habits, that we too act by instinct. It is surely more than
what is usually taken to mean instinct, [that is, an unconscious
manner of performing certain acts and of living], that enables the
Gardener Bower Bird to select certain blossoms and fruits of par-
ticular colours with which it adorns its garden, hidden away in the
great humid and darkening forests of New Guinea. Does every
little ' Gardener ' select exactly the same species of orchid, exactly
the same kind of fruit, all of exactly the same colour ? I doubt it.
That the whole species forms the gardens after a certain fixed type
is true, just as an Englishman can be stamped as such in comparison
with a Frenchman or a Bussian, but if we could examine and
know each bower and garden, assuredly we should discern a differ-
ence, brought about by the individuality, the personality of the
builder.
There is nothing&apos; which is an exact duplicate of anything else,
not even a leaf on a tree, where thousands of its kind grow and
draw their life from one source.. And is not this because every-
thing has, however lowly developed the life may be, its own per-
sonality as it were ? " Instinct in dumb animals," one hears people
say- It is reasoning in things that are anything but dumb. Animals
which have their own language, apparently to most people as little
understood as would be Spanish to those who have never learnt it.
A language expressed in birds by very distinct sounds of alarm,
warning, affection, and the like--and again each individual differs in
tone of voice and power of song.
But my pen has run off the line, and I must bring it back to
the subject of the moment.
When that intrepid and wonderfully successful collector, Mr.
Goodfellow, brought back from New Guinea some few years ago, four

Gardener Bower Birds, I became their possessor, they were all in
immature plumage, easily scared, wild and unapproachable.
In the small aviary in which I put them, one if not two met
death by dashing against the wire meshing, but this was due J
fancy more to the bullying propensities of the survivors than to
terror of human beings. When I was near, they would sit in the
bushes like stuffed birds, but if I concealed myself, I sometimes
saw one of them unmercifully persecuting another, driving it about
with savage scoldings. At last the one victor remained, and was
finally presented to our Zoological Society in London, where he is
still to be seen in one of the small outer aviaries of the Bird House
(January, 1913).
It seems that like the Birds of Paradise, these Bower Birds
pass three or four years in immature plumage, for it was not until
this Gardener had been in Regent's Park for some time after I had
him, that the orange crest appeared.
Mr. Seth-Smith has told me that he has seen the bird display
in the earlier hours of the morning, hopping backwards on the
ground, and suddenly erecting his splendid crest, with the tail and
wings spread at the same moment.
It had been my hope to see a bower built and a garden laid
out, but although whilst in my possession, I put in long willow twigs
and blossoms of geraniums and other flowers, nothing was done with
them.
The Gardener Bower Bird has not attractive manners; from
living always in humid and solitary forests, he has apparently
developed the nature of a recluse who votes society and social
gatherings a bore! but the one in the Regent's Park Zoological
Gardens has become quite bold.
If only one pair had survived and mated, how intensely
interesting it would have been to see what blossoms and what
especial colours they preferred and selected for their garden.
Could one but obtain hand-reared birds, this might come
about; but mine were caught, and Mr. Goodfellow told me that
wdiat attracted them were some bright blue beads, brought out for
barter with the natives. Blue beads which w T ere not unlike a
beautiful blue berry which he found arranged by the bower. He

Miss E. E. Chawner,
also told me that blue and orange seemed favourite colours--the
blue berries and an orange orchid.
The birds were very particular as to tidiness and cleanliness
--in which not a few humans might with advantage learn a
lesson from them!--and if leaves, etc. were scattered on the mossy
" meadow," they were as soon as the opportunity arrived, promptly
removed. The ground on which the bower is built is cleared of all
refuse and smoothed down.
So the love of gardening is very, very ancient, and the Bower-
Birds must be highly developed along their own line of evolution.

" Of all the birds that ever I see,
The owl is the fairest far to me." Old Song.
It is now fifteen years since I started Owl keeping, and I find
these birds so charming that I can only wonder so few aviculturists
appear to share my enthusiasm. Dealers constantly tell me that
there is no demand for Owls, and therefore it is no use to import
them.
When one considers that all Owls are beautiful, many quite
hardy when once acclimatised, long-lived and easily kept in health,
that they are highly intelligent, quickly become tame and often
warmly attached to their keepers, their many merits should establish
them firmly in the affections of all bird-lovers.
I now possess the following species :--True pairs of Eagle
Owls ( Bubo maximus ), Cyprean Scops Owls ( Scops cyprius ); S.

They go to nest every year, but the only fertile egg was accidentally
broken a few days before it would have hatched. The hen sits very
closely, and is guarded and fed by her mate, who becomes very
urgent for tit-bits, such as mice and sparrows, all of which he faith-
fully carries to his wife and puts into her beak with many polite
bows. If she refuses to take it he lays it beside her and returns to
his sentry duty. Both are tame and take food from hand, the cock
rather likes to be stroked and made a fuss of, but the hen does not
permit any familiarities. Their staple food is rabbit, varied by rats,
kittens, birds and mice. A friendly poulterer sends me fowls' heads
and necks, which are relished as a change, but the birds soon tire of
them. Being aviary-bred they have always had dead food, and
when a live mouse was once presented to them they showed nearly
as much consternation as an old lady would under like circumstances.
In Spring, it is amusing to see an impudent pair of Cole Tits calmly
fly through the large meshed wire and collect rabbits' fluff to line
their nest! The Owls watch the intruders with the utmost interest
and benevolence, never attempting to molest or frighten them.
Eagle Owls are very fond of bathing, and these mop up the water
in their pan like great sponges, till their feathers are so heavy they
can scarcely fly up to their lowest perch. They also enjoy sun, and
I see them sometimes with spread wings and feathers puffed out
enjoying a sun bath till they pant with heat. They are kept in a
good-sized aviary, with a shed at the back, where they can be
private when they wish, but they like to see all that goes on and
pass their remarks. The sight of a cat or dog converts them into
animated fire screens, and very magnificent they look with their
beautifully marked wings and tails expanded and their orange eyes
gleaming, as with hisses and loud snaps they follow every move-
ment of their enemy.
They are now (January) again preparing to nest, that is to
say, the cock is making experimental " scrapes " and calling the hen
to look at his work. A great deal of hooting is heard from both
birds, the cock will generally hoot when I speak to him, but, as far
as I can discover, he alone utters a very loud or demoniacal kind of
cackle. I do not know its significance, but it forms a sad contrast

Miss E. F. Chawner,
to his fine bell-tonecl call, and I feel thankful he does not often
indulge in it.
In a flight cage close by, live two charming little Cyprean
Scops Owls, a variety which is said to be restricted to the island of
Cyprus. My birds were hand-reared and are delightfully tame, and
they deserve (and I hope soon will have) a larger place, where their
movements and beautifully variegated plumage can be seen to better
advantage. They are believed to be a true pair, and one is certainly
a trifle larger than the other, but they otherwise appear to be exactly
alike. They are very silent, but the smaller one utters a low croak
when hungry. Mealworms are regarded as a great dainty and they
take them from my hand with the utmost gentleness. When I
received them I was warned that they have enormous appetites and
cannot fast for more than a few hours. Next to mealworms, they
love a cockchafer grub, and can accommodate seven or eight in their
crops at a meal, gulping down surprisingly large ones. As staple
food I give them mice or sparrows, according to the state of the
larder ; they will eat chopped-up rabbit, but prefer the smaller and
more natural food.
I am much looking forward to seeing them in an aviary
instead of a cage, as I expect they will then be less sluggish than
they appear at present. They bathe fairly often and keep themselves
in very good order, though one had the misfortune some months ago
to break the tip of its upper mandible clean off, which put it at a
disadvantage in preening its feathers as well as tearing its food. It
was glad of help for several weeks, but I am glad to say the damage
is nearly repaired. We have so far not had any really severe
weather, but I believe these Scops will prove hardy, provided their
food is not allowed to freeze before they have satisfied their hunger.
A little further on stands what is known as " the four Owls'
house." Herein live a hen English Tawny Owl, a cock (?) Sharpe's
Wood Owl, and a true pair of S. American Burrowing Owls. The
two Wood Owls are very friendly together, and as the others have
their private fastness underneath a large stump, it is hoped that they
will continue together in harmony. The Tawny Owl is a hand-
reared specimen--the gift of a former Sunday school boy on his
enlistment into the Artillery. Since that event it is hard to say

whether boy or bird is more smartened up. Since she has been
allowed a bath the Owl has moulted into a particularly well-marked
handsome bird, and w r hen I see her old master swaggering down the
village street " on leave," and recall his former intense grubbiness,
words fail me wherein to describe how marvellous is the change.
" Mrs. Hutchings " is tame and very charming, but Tawny Owls are
too well known for me to enlarge upon her management and
character.
Sharpe's Wood Owl was also very " rough " when sent to me,
and a course of baths and a moult were needed before his great
beauty could be perceived. He is a typical Wood Owl in appear-
ance and ways, and has become very confiding, always expecting
attention and a tit-bit when his aviary is entered. At first he
snatched dreadfully, but he has learnt that it is not good form to
pounce with both claws and his beak when a mealworm or
cockchafer or even a mouse is held out to him, and he takes the
gift in a proper and gentlemanly manner. The Burrowing Owls
are not so friendly, nor do I think they will ever become so, but they
are pretty and interesting and keep themselves beautifully spruce,
though they rarely (if ever) bathe. They also are so well known
that no further detail is necessary. The staple food of all these
Owls is rabbit; rats, mice and sparrows are given when obtainable.
Next come the Marbled Owls. I have had them for several
years; they were imported by Messrs. Wallace and Payne with a large
consignment of Australian birds, and I do not think any have since
come into the market, though some have been on view in the London
Zoological Gardens. I have been told that the Marbled Owl is a
variety of the Boobook. Mine are gentle, confiding, and very pretty,
especially the hen ; about half the size of our Tawny and with the
same full, soft plumage ; general colour dusky brown, breast lighter
streaked with warm brown; the wing coverts and the scapulars are
' marbled ' with round white spots ; eyes greyish yellow, but some-
times, when the light catches the pupils in a particular way, they
look red as rubies. A dark patch just behind the eyes adds very
much to their beauty.
The cock cannot fly very well owing to a drooping wing, and
is sometimes allowed to come out of the aviary and visit his neigh-

Miss E. E. Chawnek,
bours. He is then full of importance, ancl struts up and down with
all his feathers puffed out, breathing defiance and slaughter. He
dearly loves to be out in heavy rain and dances and plays with the
drops until he is thoroughly soaked ; his wife, being full-winged,
cannot be trusted in this way. Both these birds are particularly
fond of mealworms and other insects, and I have seen them pick up
and eat full-fed larvae of the Lime Hawk-moth which drop from the
big Lime beside their aviary. They also hunt and eat the large
brown spiders which are found underneath rubbish.
These Owls go to nest each year in a tub and lay three or
four large white eggs. The hen sits splendidly, but the eggs are
always clear: all through the nesting-time she is fed and jealously
watched by her mate, but they will allow me to hand in tit-bits,
which the hen accepts without leaving the nest or disturbing herself
in the slightest : in fact, she will frequently call when she hears me
passing, as a hint that she would like to be visited. The usual cry
is a double hoot, which sounds very much like a cuckoo gone flat.
They are fed on rabbit, young rats, mice and sparrows, and as many
cockchafers as I can obtain.
Once the hen escaped and I did not recover her for some
weeks, as the man who caught her did not know that she belonged
to me. When I got her back she was in good health, for fortunately
her captor possesses a sparrow-trap, but her feathers were draggled
and filthy. I think if the people who say that Owls do not need
water could have seen how that poor little creature rushed to the
bath as soon as she was released in her own aviary, they would alter
their opinion. I changed the water three times before she was
satisfied that evening, and she washed all over again during the
night. Some days elapsed before the cock would allow her to
approach him, I suppose his feelings were hurt by her elopement.
It is curious, considering their intelligence, how incapable an escaped
Owl is of providing for itself. Even wild caught specimens seem
altogether to lose their hunting instincts when they have been given
dead food for a year or so. Also they are, in my experience, quite
without the homing instinct which brings doves and small birds
back to the place where they have been fed. When an Owl escapes,
its only idea seems to be to hide in a thick bush or lofty tree until

dark and then to move on somewhere else. Even the call of its
mate does not bring it back, and after a few days it becomes so weak
and listless that it can easily be taken by hand; and if not per-
ceived it either falls a prey to a fox or cat, or perishes of starvation.
The next aviary is tenanted by another rarity--a Fernando
Po Eagle Owl. This very beautiful bird only lately came into adult
plumage, and unfortunately most of his tail and several flight
feathers are broken, so he will need another moult before he can do
himself justice. When he arrived in England, last March, he was
still in down and had experienced very rough treatment. His
plumage was ragged and verminous, one leg had been cut to the
bone, presumably by a tether, and the other was nearly as bad,
consequently his feet and legs were so swollen and tender that he
could hardly stand. He could not feed himself and was altogether
deplorable.
At this stage he had a white head and breast, fawn coloured
back mixed with white, and black barred shoulder patches. The
wing-coverts were also fawn. The flight and tail feathers were
about half-grown, yellow barred with black. His eyes were, and
still are, deep black, very full and fringed with very long eyelashes.
Legs and feet bare and white.
On the advice of the Falconer at the King's House -- who is
a kind friend to all my birds and particularly "gone" on Owls I
padded the perches and kept them continually moist with vinegar
and water, and fed the invalid several times a day on such nourish-
ing dainties as pigeons, " warm " young rabbits and sparrows, etc.
We sprinkled his feathers with 'Keating's ' and provided a bath, of
which he took full advantage. Gradually he was coaxed back to
health ; those feathers which were not broken grew rapidly, his legs
fined down and became thickly covered with white feathers barred
with black to match his breast. He grew a fine pair of ' horns,' and
tortoiseshell feathers took the place of the white down on his head
and back. By the end of May he had become a very personable
well-clad bird, most of the ragged feathers came away, and those
which remained were at any rate clean. It might well be supposed
that all this ill treatment would have made the bird either savage or
timid, but, as a matter of fact, he is the tamest and most affectionate

Miss E. F. Chawner,
creature imaginable. If I stand near his aviary he flies to a perch
near the wires and holds his head down to be tickled, and when I go
away he calls after me as long as I am in sight. When I go the
round of the birds every morning, he looks out for me, calling and
watching, and when I unfasten his door and go in, he snuggles up,
coaxing and caressing me, catching my coat in his claw lest I
should go away before he has had all the petting he desires. I have
owned many tame birds, but never one more truly affectionate. But
there are two sides to every shield. Let but a strange man approach,
and my docile pet is transformed into a hissing, snapping fury. As
one visitor truly remarked, at such moments he looks more like a
lynx than a bird. We believe that some man has tormented him
and he cannot forget it. The aviary boy dare not open his door and
changes the water and rakes the floor over from outside, while the
Owl glares at him ready for battle. To other birds he is frankly
detestable. I once, when much pressed for room, put another Owl
in with him and hoped that they would tolerate each other, but if I
had left it there, it would have been killed in ten minutes' time.
Possibly he would behave more amiably to the opposite sex of his
own species, but I do not feel very sanguine about it, and in all
probability he will not get the chance, as these Owls rarely come
into the market. His voice is curiously weak for his size, a feeble
squeak appears to be all that he can do, but he is conversationally
inclined and " talks" freely. One of his amusements is to carry a
piece of wood about and play with it, usually finishing by throwing
it into his bath and jumping in after it. He has a wide spread of
wing and needs a good big house.
Just beyond, again in a small square aviary, is a cock Mexican
Pigmy Owl. He measures six inches from his beak to the tip of his
long tail, which he wags from side to side in the most comical
manner. He is so rare that I have never been able to procure a
mate for him, and he vainly utters his metallic clink night after
night through the breeding season, but the lady never comes. His
cry " carries" surprisingly, it sounds like the clink of a small hammer
on metal and is uttered nine or ten times in succession, then a short
pause, and da capo, Poor little Owl! I would so gladly give him
the longed for companion !

He became mine in 1910 by a lucky chance. I had been to
the Zoological Gardens to see the Pearl Spotted Owlets then on view
in the Small Birds' House, and my heart was heavy with envy and
covetousness. I walked down Oxford Street, meaning to go to
Mudies', and suddenly I saw across the street a tiny Owl bobbing up
and down in a cage in Wilson's window. I rushed across, and five
minutes later the deal was concluded. The shopman told me that
the Owl had been brought from Mexico by a ship's captain, and that
it was the second he had brought them ; the first, a larger bird,
probably a female, was already sold. My individual's plumage was
somewhat ragged and he had only the stump of a tail to wag, but he
was as cheerful and healthy as possible. His plumage has long ago
recovered, except two flight feathers, which have never grown and I
fear never will. His predominant trait is curiosity. When visitors
approach he retires to his private corner, but soon reappears, and,
with excited chirps and twitching tail, takes stock of the strangers.
Though so small, he is both fierce and courageous: some time ago it
was necessary to transfer him to another house and I anticipated
some difficulty on account of his extraordinary rapid movements.
Pigmy, however, instead of trying&apos; to get away from me turned on
his back in a fury and defied me, biting and scratching his worst,
while his yellow eyes fairly flamed. He eats mice&apos;and small birds,
generally "killing" his food as soon as it is put in, and he may be
seen dancing exultantly with the prey tightly clutched by the neck
in one foot; he is not a very large eater. He bathes once a day as
a rule and- very thoroughly.
This list comes to an end with the Sparrow Owls. I have
not had them more than two months, and they are still something of
distinguished strangers. Mr. A.B. Jamrach obtained them in Switzer-
land for me. They arrived in beautiful condition, and given ordinary
luck should do well. At present they spend much of their time in
retreat, but I hope when their new house is completed to see more
of them. They are tremendous bathers and good trencher-men. I
was advised to cut up their food, but I find they manage it quite
well for themselves ; the sparrows and mice, which are their daily
bread, presenting no difficulty to them. These tiny Owls are smaller
even than the Mexican Pigmy, but they twitch their tails like him

In praise of Owls.
and, except that they have speckled heads, they also resemble him in
plumage. So far they are silent, so I do not know what their call
is like.
A few general remarks may well bring this long article to an
end. People invariably put this question when they see the Owls :
" How do you get food for them, and isn't it very expensive ? " As
many rabbits as I require, usually from four to six every week,
according as other things come in, can be obtained in the season
from the local game-dealer. When wild rabbits are ''off " the green-
grocer provides tame ones as I require them, and the village boys
who keep rabbits are only too pleased to sell me their surplus
families; the market price for these is one penny per week up to
twelve weeks old. Drowned kittens and ferreted or trapped rats
cost a penny a piece, and mice and sparrows (other birds are re-
fused) fetch one halfpenny each. We live on the outskirts of the
village and the school children do a brisk trade in these " small deer."
A certain old gardener, whose leaf heap abuts on the Forest, brings
me quantities of " grub worms," i.e. cockchafer and stag beetle larvae.
During May and fern harvest, enough mice are often brought in to
feed all the Owls for a couple of days, and Bank Holidays can
generally be relied on to produce a string of rats. These last,
while making a good change of food for the larger Owls, are not
suitable for the Scops and Pigmies, and I have lately contracted for
a weekly supply of sparrows to feed these small Owls.
The aviaries are very simple structures, boarded sides and
roofs, the latter protected from the wet by corrugated, iron ; the
fronts are made of wire netting. The small Owls' places are wired
underneath as well for fear of rats. Inside, a stump or two and
some rough perches are all that is necessary, with a barrel or box in
a dark corner. All the floors are thickly strewn with coarse road
grit. People who are fortunate enough to own a rabbit-warren or
some shooting and a couple of sparrow traps, could keep Owls prac-
tically for nothing when once the buildings have been put up. The
difficulty more often is to find a suitable position, for Owls need
plenty of room if they are to be kept in health. My indulgent
parent has allowed an ideal position .facing south, under large
deciduous trees. Here, during summer, the trees provide the

necessary shade, and when the leaves are off, the birds have the
benefit of any sun which may be vouchsafed to us, and are protected
from north and easterly winds. They do not mind frost I find (as
long as their food is not frozen) if they have a dry place and are
protected from draughts. Alas ! this eligible building site is now
fully occupied, and I shall have to close my doors and steel my
heart against more Owls.
In conclusion, I may perhaps be allowed to express my deep
indebtedness to Mr. Meade-Waldo for his great kindness in naming
my Owls for me and advising me as to their treatment. I have
never appealed to him in vain, and any success that I may lay claim
to is in reality due to his knowledge and generous assistance.
SOME EXPERIENCES.
By Alfred Lockyer.
The following notes have been penned in response to the
Editor's appeal for " copy." They have no scientific value, but may
perhaps serve as " padding," and so help to save some forthcoming
issue of the Avicultural Magazine from undue shrinkage. They deal
more with the ethical than the practical side of aviculture.
In the course of a fairly long life, I have seldom been without
furred, feathered, or other dependants. The list includes dogs, cats,
rabbits, hedgehogs, tortoises, guinea pigs, rats, mice, poultry, pigeons
and numerous other birds, but my experience leads to the conclusion
that an outdoor aviary, stocked mainly with foreign finches, parra-
keets, canaries, and other hardy granivorous species, yields the
maximum of pleasure with the minimum of trouble. The latter
consideration is important where, for half the year, the proprietor
can only secure a few minutes of daylight in the early morning on
week-days for attendance on his pensioners.
The first domestic aviary seen by the writer when a boy, had
previously been a stable, or rather loose box. It was roomy enough,
but the lighting arrangements left much to be desired, and it was by
no means proof against rats. However, with all its faults, it so
captivated his fancy that he there and then resolved to have some-

thing similar at the earliest opportunity. This opportunity did not
arrive for many years.
My first aviary was an adaptation of a small, but very lofty,
lean-to conservatory. It was what is known as a " builder's con-
servatory," with a lot of unnecessary woodwork (mainly old material)
and much coloured glass, and was quite unsuited for plant-growing.
It opened out of a sitting-room, had a concrete floor, with tiled path
down the centre, and an outer door leading by a short flight of steps
into the garden. This gangway had to be retained, so a light wood
framework was erected on either side about seven feet high, covered
with small meshed wire-netting, two dwarf doors being included.
The top was close boarded, making a capital platform for the birds,
and leaving a roomy flight up above, in addition to the space on each
side of the path. By way of a beginning, this aviary was furnished
with a miscellaneous collection of British seed-eating birds and a
few canaries.
Instances of liberated birds returning voluntarily to captivity
are by no means rare. It was in connection with this aviary that
the following incidents occurred. Among the occupants was a cock
Bullfinch, which had got out of condition and seemed to be moult-
ing, so I thought it would be a kind act to give Bully his liberty.
Accordingly, he was netted and liberated one fine summer morning,
and flew gaily away over the neighbouring gardens, so I naturally
supposed I should never see him again. Imagine my astonishment,
on returning home in the evening, to find my little friend in the
gangway aforesaid, waiting patiently for. admittance at one of the
small wire doors. The mute appeal could not be resisted; I opened
the door an inch or two and he hopped gratefully inside, where he
remained for the rest of his days.
On another occasion, a Canary escaped over my shoulder as
I was entering the aviary in the morning, and bolted like an arrow.
I wasted half-an-hour hunting for him (in lieu of breakfast) but
without success, and had then, perforce, to wend my way to the
railway station. Bemembering&apos; the former experience, I placed a
dish of seed inside the corridor, leaving the outer door open, and
gave instructions for a watch to be kept, so that, in case the
bait attracted, the retreat might be cut off. I had not gone far when

I heard a familiar call, and looking up saw the truant perched on the
fence of the local recreation ground. He had, of course, recognised
me and saluted in the customary manner. He was in such a state
of delighted excitement that I really thought he would allow me to
capture him, but just as my hand was about to close upon him he
bolted again, happily in the direction from which he had come. I
could do no more than bid him go home, and this is exactly what
he did do, for it seems that within a quarter-of-an-hour of my leaving
he was busy with his second breakfast and was promptly secured.
No doubt, in both these instances, hunger helped to arouse
the homing instinct, but surely such incidents are a conclusive refu-
tation of the absurd contention that there can be any cruelty in
keeping in a state of captivity suitable species of birds under suitable
conditions. They also suggest the interesting enquiry whether, in
favourable surroundings, selected species of small birds might not,
with patience, be trained to "home" in the same way that pigeons
do. Perhaps the greatest difficulty would be the probability of
"mobbing" by sparrows and others of the "lower orders" of
feathered creation. Cats also would, doubtless, take heavy toll,
but certainly a secluded garden in which Budgerigars, Canaries,
and the like were at full liberty would be a delightful resort.
The mention of Sparrows reminds me of an amusing episode
which took place in the same aviary. One day I found a cock Spar-
row flying about in the adjoining sitting-room. He had blundered
in through the open window and had not sufficient sense to find
his way out again. I closed the window, caught the intruder with-
out much difficulty and placed him in the aviary in order to see how
he would behave in polite society.
Now, I am aware that Sparrows have apologists--I believe
they even have admirers ! I belong to neither category--but this is
not the place to revive the old, old controversy, which has so often
raged around the persons of these feathered anarchists.
For about a week after his introduction, this particular
specimen devoted all his energies to gorging himself on the un-
accustomed stores of Canary seed, millet, and so forth. When this
began to pall through continued repletion, another trait in his
disposition emerged--he started persecuting all the small inhabitants

of the aviary. Observe, he never at any time offered to molest a
bird of his own size or fighting weight, but the poor little nuns,
Spice Birds, etc. had a shocking time. No mercy was shown to the
helpless victims, and what was formerly almost an abode of love
was fast becoming something like a bear garden, until it seemed
probable that my experiment might end in a verdict of " wilful
murder," followed by the well-deserved execution of the culprit.
However, just in the nick of time, a lusty Java Sparrow seemed to
grasp the situation, swore himself in as a special constable, and took
his British namesake in hand. From that moment the oppressor
knew no peace. He was driven from the food hoppers, chased into
corners, chivied about from morn to dewy eve, and every day made
frequent and painful acquaintances with the powerful beak of the
avenger. He was speedily reduced to such an abject condition that
he fairly screamed with terror whenever the representative of law
and order came within measurable distance, and each morning the
floor of the aviary was more or less littered with the unlovely
plumage of Passer clomesticus. The " treatment " was drastic but
effectual, and, after a few days of it, I thought the patient had had
almost enough, so I caught him and let him go--half naked, half
starving, battered, bruised and bleeding, a much sadder and. let us
hope, a wiser bird.
So passed the glutton, bully and coward from the scene of his
misdeeds, leaving his character writ large behind him, and the little
republic reverted to its normal condition of peace and tranquility.
My second aviary was built against a brick wall facing south
and consisted of " night-nursery, day-nursery and playground." It
need not be described in detail, there being no unusual feature about
it. It was here that a delightful friendship sprang up between two
birds of widely divergent species--an incident which supplies one of
those "touches of nature" which make the whole world--avian as
well as human--akin.
A little Spice Bird--the survivor of a pair--had got into ill-
health and seemed to be in a condition of perpetual moult--alto-
gether a miserable-looking object. There was also in the aviary an
odd cock Budgerigar who, having no mate to claim his affections,
decided to bestow them upon the little invalid. They became in-

separable companions, and it was diverting in the extreme to watch
the officious attentions of the self-appointed guardian, his extrava-
gant endearments (in approved love-bird fashion), his attempts to
feed his protege (which the latter seemed scarcely to understand)
and his jealous scoldings, dealt out indiscriminately to any inquisitive
watchers who came too near. But the prettiest of these " moving
pictures " was reserved until evening. There was a long perch
which ended in a sunny corner, formed by the junction of the roof
with two sides of the aviary. This corner was much in request as a
dormitory, but Budgy would allow none but his favourite to occupy
it. He would gently push his companion along the perch, with
much chattering (as is the manner of his kind) until the desired spot
had been reached, he would then raise his nearest wing and spread
it out until it completely covered the half-clad little sufferer, and so
they would sleep night after night. Truly a charming idyll of bird-
life at its best and sweetest !
It was in this aviary that a cock Canary (adult when pur-
chased) lived happily for twelve years and died of sheer old age.
My present aviary is much on the lines of the preceding one,
and has so far yielded nothing worthy of record, except perhaps the
circumstance of a Yellow Budgerigar hen mating with a Green cock,
the young (two only) showing no traces of variation, being absolutely
true to the type. A clear yellow Norwich hen Canary also mated
with a dark variegated cock ; the sole young bird reared being a
replica of his father. These results are w r hat might be expected, the
influence of the type being stronger in the first generation at least
than that of the variety. (I take it that the heavily-marked dark
Canary is nearer to the original wild progenitor than the clear yellow,
obviously artificial variety.)
In concluding these disjointed memoranda, I wish to ask
some member or members of the Society to kindly publish a list or
lists of the proved hardiest seed-eating birds (non-British), such as
can be relied on to thrive in a sheltered outdoor aviary without
artificial heat. I should place in the first rank for hardiness the
following--Budgerigars, Madagascar Love Birds, Canaries, Saffron
Finches, Java Sparrows (both Grey and White) and Weavers (Red-
billed and Russ's). Fairly hardy :--Passerine (Blue-winged), Parra-

It may interest our members to have some short notes on a
few species which have come under my notice in Scotland and
elsewhere.
I might commence with the Crested Tit (Pants cristatus )
which I was able to observe in the Spey Valley, when I took down a
few details as to their nesting and breeding. These birds only build
in tree stumps that are quite rotten and very easy to peck a hole in.
Consequently these attractive little Tits can only find suitable nest-
ing places in a few spots where old natural fir-woods are to be found.
All down the Spey Valley woods of this kind are numerous, and thus
it is that these birds especially collect there for their nesting.
They seem to be slightly on the increase, which is surprising,
as many eggs and nests are taken every year by so-called ' natural-
ists.' In Morris's "British Birds" it states that two were killed
near the River Spey. The year I was along that valley, in all
probability quite twenty pairs were breeding on the hill side where I
found two nests, for I myself saw four pairs, and in these dense
woods they would very easily pass unnoticed.
In my notes I recorded as follows: -- " A nest consisted of a
foundation of moss, lined profusely with rabbit's fur, no other
material being used, and was placed in the rotten stump of an old
fir tree about three feet from the ground; the hole having been
bored by the birds themselves by pecking away the decayed wood.

Within were three eggs, which was not the full complement, the
normal clutch being at least five or six. The eggs were white with
reddish spots chiefly on the larger end, similar to a Blue Tit's, but
slightly bigger.
The food of the Crested Tit consists, as in the case of other
members of the family, of insects ; but they also consume a lot of
seeds from the fir-cones, as well as berries, such as rowan, etc. This
species is resident, but its numbers are sometimes augmented by
migrants from the Continent. Its note is very similar to the Cole
Tit, but has a peculiar quaver at the end.
I might add that another nest I found belonging to this
species was of especial interest, for it was placed in a hole formed
by a board being nailed against a hollow in a fir-tree trunk, the tree
itself being alive and not decayed as is usual, the birds having taken
advantage of a small entrance between the board and the living
trunk. The board had been placed there by a Ghillie who took a
great interest in wild birds, and he told me that although he had
found a great many nests of Crested Tits, he had never before seen
one in anything approaching to an artificial site, or in hard wood,
as in the above case. He had seen a pair of these charming little
birds in his garden, and thinking they had been unable to discover a
suitable nesting site, had devised one for them, for which they
/
appeared grateful, much to the delight of the landlord, who took
the greatest interest in his feathered tenants, for they were by no
means the only ones, as in addition to other birds, a pair of Tree-
creepers had utilized another tree treated in the same manner.
I was also fortunate enough to find a Crossbill's nest (Loxia
curvirostra ) which was built near the top of a tall Scotch fir on the
outskirts of a wood, being placed towards the end of a horizontal
branch.
The nest closely resembled that of a hedge-accentor's, but
somewhat larger. There were young birds within, nearly fully
fledged ; one of whose number was unfortunate enough to be blown
out during a gale, which I picked up dead. Its mouth was full of
seeds of larch cones. Up to the age of three weeks, the bills of the
nestlings are quite straight.
Coming to an entirely different family and locality, I may

On Crested Tits and other Wild Birds.
perhaps be permitted to record a few of my observations on Tawny
and Barn Owls in Shropshire.
On the 26th of July, 1912, my note book has the following :--
I had to-day an opportunity of making some interesting observations
on these two species. About 7.15 p.m. I saw two Tawny Owls
emerge from an old elm tree ; it being nearly an hour to sunset I
could see with ease. The two birds started beating the ground for
mice, etc To prove that in the first instance the birds had not
been disturbed, one of them very soon caught a mouse and flew into
a tree to eat it.
This hardly seems to tally with Mr. Bonhote's remarks in his
"Birds of Great Britain," where he says:--" This species ... is
" extremely nocturnal, never appearing until quite dark, and seldom
" pursuing its prey in the open, but keeping to glades and rides in
" the woods." In this case it was perfectly light and the birds were
quartering over an open grass field. All this time I could hear a
curious high-pitched sort of squeal proceeding from several of the
neighbouring trees, and on crawling up to one on all fours, discovered
a young Tawny Owl and was able to watch him making this noise for
some minutes, besides which he uttered the well-known "kee-wick"
note. On moving forward I disturbed from a tree another Tawny
Owl which had a mouse in its claws, and with which it flew away,
the mouse dangling beneath it. Neither were the Tawny Owls the
only ones of their species that were about, for immediately after-
wards I heard a curious snoring noise proceeding from another tree
near by, from which, when I approached it, a Barn Owl flew away.
It was evident that there was a brood of young ones in a nesting-hole,
and I found several pellets cast up by the owls lying beneath the tree,
which I examined. These pellets were composed exclusively of the
undigested portions of mice and voles, showing that this species of
owl--a fact which gamekeepers and others do not always realize--is
one of the most useful to farmers and agriculturists.
I might mention that in the same tree, within a few feet of
the owl's nest, was a stock dove incubating her two eggs, and yet
people say that these owls kill pigeons.
The Barn Owl is a very expert mouser, and the way in which
it can sense a mouse and drop right on it in long grass, is amazing.

I have observed that they usually fly about six feet from the ground,
then suddenly checking themselves, they hover for a moment before
dropping like a stone into the grass, where they remain for a second
or two before rising on the wing with a mouse in their talons. I
disturbed a Bari Owl from a tree when in the act of eating a mouse,
and on flying away the bird had the mouse in its bill, but as it flew
it very distinctly transferred it to one foot, which goes to prove that
that is the ordinary manner of carrying&apos; its prey.
[We are very pleased, not only to have a fresh writer for our Magazine,
but also one who gives such interesting matter as does Sir Roland Corbet, who
is evidently a keen observer of birds, and we express a hope that he will
continue to contribute in other numbers. If a subaltern in the Coldstream
Guards can do this, there are surely several other members of the Avicultural
Society with more experience, because they are of riper years, who could do
likewise.-- EDITOR.]

important work, is published, and consists of an index, enlisting the
number of species of birds at 4561. This list, however, is by no
means regarded as final, but the authors venture to hope that it will
form a basis on which ornithologists can pursue their investigations.
The scope of the list includes South America and the islands
adjacent to the coast from Columbia, Venezuela, Tobago, and
Trinidad to Cape Horn and the Falkland Islands. It will naturally
be a costly work, the first Vol. being #1. Is. and the rest #3. 3s.

before him, and whilst he is able to observe birds in their native
wilds in some parts of S. America, Mr. Chubb is ably assisting him
from within the walls of the Natural History Museum [South
Kensington].
It is no light affair to tackle, and such an effort deserves to
be crowned with success.
To aviculturists who have access to the work, a great boon is
the fact that English names are given to the birds as well as those
in Latin, many of the former filling bird-lovers with an extra desire
to obtain some of them as living pets. Amongst the Humming-birds
the little family Phcethornis, for example, is called " Hermit," of
which thirty-nine species are indexed.
Then there are the Sabre-wings, the Emeralds-- [picture the
Blue-breasted Emerald! and the Blue - spotted, and the White-
breasted and the Green-headed] -- Agyrtria is the family name. And
does not a bird which is called the Blue-headed Sapphironia appeal
to you ? Go and look some of them out in the Museum cabinets --
Mr. Chubb will no doubt show them to you. But you must ask
him for L epidopyga cceruleogularis, then he'll understand you! even
if you don't quite do so yourself.
Oh! what treasures and flashing bejewelled feathers there
must be. " Families " who call themselves Erythronotes, some of
which belong to Felicia and Alice, whilst others are blue-capped, or
copper-tailed, or green-bellied, or white-breasted, and this family calls
itself Saucerottea. Dear me ! one pictures them with something saucy
about them : tails probably ! And fancy walking into a nice clean
bird-shop, and seeing eight species of delicious birds, all called
" Sapphire," and taking home with you a Rufous Throated Sapphire,
or a White-throated or a Red-rumped Sapphire.
One's behaviour would be so boisterous that one would run the
risk of being hurried to the nearest lunatic asylum ! And there are
more of that genus--I only know them as Humming-birds--but with
such names, they surely must be treasures, as indeed they always
are. I read of the Blue-chinned and the Blue-breasted Sapphire ; and
hardly has one recovered from the agony of desire, when one's eye
catches on another family known as the Wood-Nymph (Thalurania).

" Sir, I have lately acquired a humming-bird new to aviculture, viz.,
Thalurania refulgens --the Refulgent Wood-Nymph." It is the sort
of thing one might see in an up-to-date Drury Lane Pantomime.
I feel that if I look through Lord Brabourne's and Mr.
Chubb's index much more, that I shall either take the first aeroplane
to Brazil, Ecuador and British Guiana, or expire from futile and
fatal longings.
I have, for I cannot resist it, turned over another page (p. 123)
and the first name that catches my eye is i! Little Violet-ear," and
feel certain that this is no dry museum index of ornithological
research, but a fairy story, which after all would not be astonishing,
for Lord Brabourne's grandfather wrote very charming fairy stories.
Yet not for the world would I encourage the capture of these
living jewels, at least not until we are quite quite certain we can
feed them and keep them well and happy.
But there are hundreds of other species which could be
imported. Barbets, galore. Five-coloured; gold-fronted; orange-
banded ; Many-coloured, etc. ; some from Peru, some from Ecuador,
some from Venezuela, Brazil, etc. And the Woodpeckers! One
hundred and ten species under ten family titles. Golden green ;
black and green; Blood-coloured; Beautiful; Crimson-banded ; and so
on. I think the Piculets must be rather attractive too ; [ Picwnnus \
stick a lot of them ! There are ever so many Bush-Shrikes and
Bush-Birds and Ant-Birds and Ant-Wrens and Ant-Creepers and
Ant-Thrushes. It bewilders one, and one feels inclined to exclaim
" My giddy Aunt." "The pale Earth-creeper" sounds rather too
much like a worm, as does also the red-tailed ditto, but for all that
they are apparently birds, and no worms. And imagine winning&apos; a
special prize at the Horticultural Hall for the rarest bird in the
show, and having to catalogue it as an " Equatorial Whiskered
Recurved-bill." " Tyrants " there are too, any amount. I should'nt
care for them, we already have one or two too many at home ! and
they ought to be ' in captivity ! '
Flycatchers, too, of sorts by the hundred; and Manakins ;
amongst which are coroneted ; fire-crowned; golden-winged; fiery-
headed ; opal-crowned ; azure-crowned; etc.
Of Thrushes, or things allied to Thrushes, there are many.

One becomes confused when one finds the Rose-breasted
Grosbeak of N. America, which is found in the winter in Columbia
and Ecuador, called Zamelodia ludoviciana ; when one has been
forced-- nolens volens --to speak of Hydemeles ludovicianus.
The genus of SporopJvila (lover of seeds) is represented by
forty-two species. Some of these, although very few, have been
kept by members of our Society--the Chestnut-breasted, for ex-
ample, and the ocellated, or is it lineolated ? And there are nineteen
Siskins, in which list of course is included the now well-known
Hooded (or Red) Siskin ( Chrysomitris cucullcitus), which was suc-
cessfully bred by Dr. Amsler at Eton. But Spinus is given as the
family name, not Chrysomitris. One will forget one's own name
next !
Some of our exhibiting members would give much fine gold
for the possession of some of the members of the Dacnis family.
D. cayana is well known as the Blue Sugar bird. I don't think I
shouid mind Bang's Scarlet-thighed Honey Creeper (D. fuliginata),
though probably bang&apos; would go saxpence and the rest, before one
got it.
As to Tanagers, their name is legion ; their mere names filling
up twenty-seven pages of this voluminous index. Now that col-
lectors of living birds are being drawn into the great South American
Continent, we aviculturists may look forward to receiving some of
these rarities. We take off our shoes when we strive to gaze into
the depths of those vast forests, when we mentally wander on the
uplands of those unexplored countries, and see as in a vision the
Silver-banded Motmot swinging his pendulum tail, or hear clairau-
diently the ringing notes of some unnamed denizen of a mountain
gorge. Yet what struggles and trials and privations would have to
be undergone before reaching this fairy land.
I have been told, by one who knows, that the uplands of
British Guiana are a paradise, with air so exhilarating and health-
giving that one never would wish to retrace one's steps to that large
sponge which is anchored in the Northern seas, called the British
Isles. That there, in that Guiana, one enjoys all that is desirable
of the tropics and nothing to the contrary, when one can pitch one's
camp at a height of 4,000, 5,000 or 6,000 feet, beside limpid torrents.

Mrs. NOBLE, who is very much interested in her aviary, writes that she
has been rather amused with two little incidents. She has a Bleeding-heart
Dove that roosts every evening on a perch, and a little Steel Finch sleeps on the
back of the Bleeding-heart, nestling down amongst its feathers for warmth.

Another interesting scene is that of a Ribbon Pinch (Cutthroat) which
nestles under the wing of a Harlequin Dove, its head just peeping out.
A hen Bengalese has mated with a Magpie Mannakin, and Mrs. Noble is
much interested to see what the result will be of this hybridism.

THE MOULT OP IMMATURE BLACK REDSTARTS.
I have noticed the remarks in Mr. W. E. Teschemaker's letter on moult
of the Black Redstart. I notice in this month's issue (March) a statement to
the effect that the young after the first autumn moult are darker than the adult
female in breeding plumage. Thus it would seem that the young would not
be in adult plumage for about fifteen months after hatching. I am not quite
certain on this point, as I have never had young of this species in the nest to
enable me to note at what time the adult plumage is assumed.
I had a young male sent me towards the end of July a few years ago, sold
to me as a hen, but, on examining the plumage, I could see it was a male,
In immature plumage the female is of a rusty ashy grey, showing most of
the rust colour on the breast ; the short wing-feathers close to the body are
very narrowly edged with dingy buff. The male is only very slightly larger, but
he is of a uniform smoky grey all over head, neck and back ; the breast has
less of the rusty colour ; the short wing-feathers have broader edges of pale rusty
buff on the outer edge than the female; when the wing is closed it clearly in-
dicates where the clear white edges would show in the adult plumage ; the two
dark-brown centre tail-feathers are a shade broader than those of the female, but
the remaining orange-red tail-feathers are no brighter than those of the opposite
sex in immature plumage until after the adult feather is attained. This bird
was sent to me in July, moulted the following September and came out into rich
adult costume as bright and clear as any adult male I have ever seen.
If the Black Redstart does not come into adult colour until the second
autumn moult, it is strange why the Common Redstart should not do the same.
This bird, however, after leaving the nest, is like a young Robin with an orange-
red tail, until Autumn, when it moults into adult plumage; the only difference
is that the jet black throat and orange breast is more frosted at the tips of the
feather than in spring, and the white forehead not so clear owing to the feather-
tips being grey like the top of the head. P. P. M. GALLOWAY.
THE MOULT OP IMMATURE BLACK REDSTARTS.
SIR, -- I notice that one of our members has some criticism on my recent
short letter on this subject, both from a literary and an ornithological point of
view. He protests against the use of the popular name " Blackstart&amp;quot; on the
ground that it is a " lazy abbreviation, which is not only incorrect but might
be misleading."

The test of a popular name is its popularity and this particular name
stands the test well, for I doubt if there is anyone in this country, interested
in insectivorous birds, who is not acquainted with the name or who would
apply it to any other species. It seems to me to be a simple and obvious
abbreviation. Just as Nightingale becomes "Gale," * so Redstart frequently
becomes " 'Start " (an abbreviation which I saw in print only a few days since)
and " Blackstart " is therefore simply " Black-'Start."
With regard to the other points Mr. Ticehurst raises. He seems to have
misunderstood my remarks because I used the phrase " nest-feather " as equiva-
lent to " nestling plumage," but, if he had read the notes I contributed on the
nesting of this species, he would have understood my meaning. In these notes
I restricted myself chiefly to those points on which I thought the nesting of the
species, as observed by me, might throw some light. The plumage of immature
Blackstarts after the first autumnal moult has been often observed and I there-
fore did not refer to it (except incidentally), but probably very few aviculturists
in this country have seen young Blackstarts in the nest, or reared them from the
nest, so I pointed out how much darker young males in nestling plumage (before
the first autumnal moult) are than adult females and also how much darker than
in their first winter plumage. This seemed to me to be interesting and I had
not seen the fact noted elsewhere. I called the first winter plumage an "eclipse
plumage ' ' because it is duller either than that which precedes or than that which
follows, and because it is presumably protective.
And now as to the question whether immature Blackstarts have a spring-
moult or not. Ornithologists either label a species as " having a spring-moult "
or " not having a spring-moult," hut it never seems to occur to them that it
may sometimes have such a moult and sometimes not. Yet every aviculturist
realises that in the matter of moult not only every species but every individual
is a law unto itself. Of the three immature male Blackstarts which I have
had under observation during the spring months, two showed some change in
March (a few dark feathers appearing on the upper breast) and one of these
birds which I had occasion to handle, as will be inferred from the following
note, was found to be casting some flights.
11 March, 1910. " Heard Blackstart in No. 2 Div. singing; song rich,
bubbling, and in parts like a Starling's."
5 April, 1910. "Transferred Blackstart to No. 4 Div.; has some
primaries missing."
* The name of the Nightingale is full of charming and poetical associa-
tions. "Gale" is certainly a most undesirable abbreviation, and whether it be
due to laziness or not, it decidedly gives one that impression. Hundreds of
people would not know what it was meant to signify. Neither is the abbreviation
Blackstart correct, because start = tail, and the Black Redstart has, as its name
implies, a red tail. Blackstart = Blacktail. In old English 'start,' 'stert,' or
' steort.'--ED.

Correspondence.
I have also a note on the autumnal moult of this particular bird. 10
Sept., 1910. " Cock Blackstart is now in grand colour after moult; rich black
on throat and upper breast and some white on wings."
I noticed also in ''Canary and Cage-bird Life" that Mr. Allen Silver
stated that he knew of a Blackstart now moulting. Here, then, we have
evidence that males of this species sometimes have a vernal moult, but I do
not say and I do not think that (at all events as far as those individuals which
winter in Europe are concerned) this moult is of frequent occurrence. On this
point I have obtained some definite evidence from Mr. E. Taylor, who now has the
two young males which I bred last summer. He says: ''I have now had six
young cocks within the last five years, including the two I obtained from you,
and have never had one yet that had a spring moult or change of plumage : the
two I have at present have not dropped a single feather so far this year though
they moulted their body feathers last autumn." I may mention, however, that
Mr. Taylor's birds have always been moulted in a cold room in a cold climate,
(Glasgow) whereas mine have been moulted in heat, and some heat seems to be
necessary to obtain a full and natural moult -- of insectivorous species at all
events.
With regard to the question of the exact age at which males assume the
perfect adult plumage, I note that Mr. Ticehurst says : " Here is an opportunity
for aviculturists to decide." It is very satisfactory to find that there is, in his
opinion, just one little brick which aviculturists can add to the stately edifice of
ornithology, but he has evidently overlooked the fact that this particular brick
was turned out rather more than one hundred years since, and by an aviculturist
(Bechstein). I can confirm the latter's statement. I obtained the old male
(mentioned in my notes) at the end of 1909 in his first winter plumage. In the
autumn of 1910 he assumed adult plumage and his colour was good (as may be
inferred from my note above) but, after his third autumnal moult, the area of
black and the white wing patch were larger and the colour deeper. After his
fourth autumnal moult the white wing patch was larger still but the black on
the breast was not so deep, which is perhaps due to his having been moulted
last autumn in a cold bird-room. Our member, Mr. Galloway, tells me that he
considers that some Blackstarts attain their full beauty at their second autumnal
moult, but I do not think that he has had the opportunity of watching one particu-
lar male for three years as I have, and I think he has overlooked the fact that
when he saw this male in my bird-room last October he told me he had never
seen a larger wing patch.

The following reply has been sent to Miss Mundy :--
If you possess Yol. I. of my Foreign Birds for Cage and Aviary and look
at p. 154 you will see the following:--"A pair of Avadavats built a nest in a
box-tree, which I introduced, in a pot, into my bird-room ; but no sooner was it
finished than a pair of Cordon Bleus took possession, to be in turn ejected by
Lavender Finches," &amp;c. I think this will sufficiently prove that box-trees are
not injurious to Waxbills, but I have frequently introduced them into other
aviaries in which Waxbills or Grassfinches were living and, in spite of the
offensive catty smell of these bushes, I consider them quite harmless to bird-life.

WHITE BLACKBIRD WITH ASTHMA.
SIR,--I have in my possession a pure white Blackbird ; the eyes are red
and the beak yellow. He has been reared from a nest of five, all white birds.
I do not know if the parents were white. I am sorry to say he has a bad
asthmatical cough. Could you kindly tell me what is a good thing to give a bird
to cure this, I am so anxious he should get well and live. He is very lively and
enjoys a bath every day, but he coughs every two or three seconds. I feed him
on Abrahams' soft-bill bird food and puppy cake broken up and all kinds of
insects. E. STAVELEY-HlLL.
The following reply has been sent to Mrs. E. Staveley-Hill :--
Albino birds are always delicate, and thus your bird has readily caught
cold. The best remedy is--first a drop or two of castor oil placed well back in the
open bill (so that it may be swallowed and not flung away by the bird) ; then
daily in the drinking-water put eight drops of glycerine and a similar quantity of
dissolved gum arabic to each wineglassful of water, well stirring the mixture with
a glass rod (perhaps a steel knitting-needle would do as well).
When the breathing becomes normal, give a tonic. I prefer iron to any-
thing else,--a crystal or two of sulphate of iron the size of a grey pea dissolved in
the drinking-water daily for a week or two, but Syrup of Phosphates is also an
excellent thing.
When obtainable a little fresh lettuce chopped up finely and mixed with
the food is good. By the way, you should give fruit : all my Blackbirds have
grapes and oranges at this time of year and other fruits when in season,
A. G. Butler.
SIR,--I have a tame Australian Piping Crow, she is a most amusing pet;
I have had her three years, she was only a young bird half-grown when I got her.
If it would be of any interest to the readers of the Avicultural Magazine I will
get a good snapshot of her and send it up to you, with a short account of her
habits. At present she is busy building a nest in a chair in the conservatory.
She is not caged and goes in and out when she likes, following me about the
garden whistling and talking. E. STAVELEY-HlLL.

Extract from "British Birds, " February, 1913.
A SWALLOW RINGED IN STAFFORDSHIRE AND RECOVERED
IN NATAL.
The following letter has just reached me :--
</bodyText>
<table confidence="0.786340428571428" page_id="32655054"  page_num="Page 188" year="" vol="">
Grand Hotel,
Utrecht, Natal,
\0x25A0&apos;Witherby," 27th December, 1912.
High Holborn, London.
DEAR SIR,
On December 23rd a Swallow was caught in the farmhouse of the farm
" Roodeyand," 18 miles from this town, with a metal label round its leg, with
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.99216162962963" page_id="32655054"  page_num="Page 188" year="" vol="">
the words : Witherby, High Holborn, London, and on the other side B.830.
The farmer, Mr. J. Mayer, took the label off and has it in his possession.
As I am interested in birds of any sort and the migration of the same, I shall
be glad to know if you receive this letter safely.
Yours truly,
C. H. RUDDOCK, Proprietor.
The ring B.830 was put on an adult Swallow by Mr. J. R. B. Masefield,
at Rosehill, Cheadle, Staffordshire, on May 6th, 1911. This bird was one of a
pair (Mr. Masefield thought the female) which nested in a porch. Its mate was
also caught and ringed. At the same time Mr. Masefield ringed another pair
nesting in the same porch. In the summer of 1912 he again caught the Swallows
which had come to nest in his porch and found that only one of them had a ring,
viz. B.827, which was one of the birds nesting there the year before. Neither
its mate nor the other pair of which the present B.830 is one had returned to
this particular spot.
That this Swallow breeding in the far west of Europe should have reached
so far to the south-east of Africa, seems to me extraordinary. Unfortunately
the few records we have as yet of ringed Swallows recovered during migration do
not afford a clue to the routes taken, and it seems to me unreasonable to suppose
that our birds proceed southwards down the east side of Africa as might be
inferred from this Natal record.
It is, indeed, quite impossible to theorize on a single recovery of this kind
and we must be content at present with the bare fact--perhaps the most startling
fact that the ringing of birds has as yet produced.
We are most thankful to Mr. Ruddock for reporting this extremely
interesting recovery and we hope that the details of it will become widely known
in South Africa and thus produce further results. H. F. WITHERBY.

THE BLUE NILTAVA.
Xanthopygia cyanomelcena.
By Hubert D. Astley, M.A., etc.
When Mr. Gooclfellow brought over the Mikado Pheasants
from Formosa for Mr. and Mrs. Johnstone in the summer of 1912,
he also, amongst a few other interesting&apos; birds, imported one Blue
Flycatcher which he obtained I believe in China. This bird came
into my possession, and was without much doubt the only one in
Europe.
I exhibited it in November at the L.C.B.A. Show at the
Horticultural Hall, Westminster, and also a pair of Indian Brown-
backed ' Robins ' ( Thamnobia cambaiensis) where the Niltava won
the silver medal for the rarest foreign bird. To my great dismay,
all three of these rare and lovely birds died a little while before
Christmas, along with three birds which were newly imported ; a
rare Tanager (. Pyranga bidentata) and two Mexican Ground Thrushes
(Geocichla pinicola). Whether the latter brought the disease, I
know not, but the only birds which died of my hitherto perfectly
healthy and acclimatized ones, were the three above mentioned.
In the bird-room, where they were kept, there are Himalayan Blue
Rock Thrushes, Sunbirds, Sugarbirds, etc., none of which caught
the disease, neither did the female Pyranga bidentata.
My bird-room is always kept most scrupulously clean, with
open window&amp;quot;, washings down with Jeyes' fluid, etc., water vessels
thoroughly rinsed twice a day, and the rest of it.
The beautiful little Blue Niltava was the first to succumb ;

Mr. Hubert D. Astley,
although he was, before I sent him to the Show, in perfect condition,
and if anything a little too fat. I noticed him one day in December
looking dim about the eye, and when he flew (for he generally came
out of his cage to have his bath) he moved feebly compared with
his usually swift and robust flight, and on catching him, found
his plump breast was dwindling, and that he was going light ! after
that, he rapidly became worse, and the post-mortem showed death
from ' bird-fever.' And then the lovely little Brown-backed 'Robins'
followed ; first the female then the male. Most despairing ! In any
case, they would not again have been seen on a show bench, for the
little Robins returned with the water upset, the sand all over the
food, and both birds exceedingly puffy and the worse for wear ! and
only from Paddington to Newbury, after crossing London irom
Westminster.
Well! let me leave this sad part of my account and speak of
the Blue Niltava as a pet.
I took him out to Italy for August and September, where he
moulted successfully, and enjoyed the warmth, and in addition to
that, plenty of fresh insect food, especially black meadow crickets,
which are about the size of an English house cricket but more
thickly built. They are easy enough to catch, for they live in
colonies on grassy slopes, two or three in a burrow of their own
making, and these burrows are very apparent, holes which a six-
pence would about cover over. One takes a long piece of stiff grass,
twiddles it into the burrow, and after a moment or two, out runs a
grillo (cricket) which is at once seized and put into a bottle. One
can catch thirty or forty in a very short time. These are the
crickets which in Italy, (and I fancy it is much the same kind of
insect in Japan) are kept in tiny cages on account of their so-called
song. They are very pugilistic, and if one sits still, one sees two
issue from different burrows and spar at each other like game-cocks.
The Blue Niltava appreciated them highly; they went down,
after a certain amount of banging about, like oysters. He always
had a flight in a room, and loved his bath, which he would take two
or three times a day. He would settle on the back of a chair,
flirting his tail from one side to the other, and uttering a sharp
" Tck," besides which he had an extremely pretty song; at moments

rather like an English Robin's, at others more resembling some bird
of the gorse lands, such as a Stone-chat, etc.
From my fingers he readily took mealworms, although he was
very shy at times ; but he was, just before his death, becoming much
tamer.
In the wild state, this beautiful Niltava is found in China
and Japan. It passes on migration through the Lower Yangtse
Basin, where it arrives at the end of April. It is met with in
numbers among the bamboos of the Lushan hills, and returns in
September.
Mr. F. W. Styan records that it breeds at Ichang in West
China, and Mr. Seebohm, writing on the birds of Tsu-sima, Japan,
shot a solitary male on the 22nd April (Ibis, 1892), when it was
sitting on the branch of a bush, and not at all shy.
M. Kalinowski obtained a female in Corea. It is also seen
in the island of Hainan, which lies opposite the extreme southern
point of the mainland of China and which is separated from it by
a channel only a few miles in breadth.
Mr. Swinhoe, when he wrote on the " Ornithology of Hong-
kong," mentioned that this bird's native name is, in Cantonese,
" Moey-Fa-tsoey" ; and that a few occur in Hongkong in April. In
Canton for the first fortnight in April he observed them as remark-
ably abundant near the city walls. " Almost every mound," he
wrote, " or gravestone, had its blue bird standing erect, on the look-
" out for passing insects. I was much struck with the appearance
"of a brown bird of similar habits and seen in similar positions;
this I found to be the female of the Blue bird ; the one I shot
" being an almost uniform olive brown plumage."
It is just that, the charming contrast so often to be found
between males and females of different species, each one setting off
the beauty of the other. One of the most striking examples is
perhaps to be seen in the two sexes of the Purple Yellow-legged
Sugar Bird, where the male is like a sapphire, and the female a green
tourmaline.
The description of the female of the Blue and White Niltava
is as follows :--Bill, blackish brown ; legs, greyish brown ; iris, dark
brown; inside of mouth, yellowish flesh colour ; upper parts, olive

If anyone has a friend in Canton, perhaps some of these
delicious birds could be imported in pairs.

By F. E. Blaauw, C.M.Z.S.
Puerto Varas is a small place on the Southern shore of the
beautiful lake of Llanquihue in Southern Chile. The chief glory of
this lake is the snow-clad top of the Osorno volcano which, along
with other mountains, can be seen from the greater part of it.
Puerto Varas is on the way to Puerto Montt, if one goes
south, and is a fairly important place, mostly inhabited by German
colonists. When I was in Puerto Varas I had just returned from a
trip to the Nahuel Fluapi lake, and had the intention to travel
northwards to Valdivia, so that I only stopped for a day at the place
named. It was the 25th of March, 1911, and I thought I would
spend it by making an excursion to Puerto Montt. Accordingly I
set out on horseback early in the morning, travelling southwards.
The road at first led through open country, more or less hilly, and
was, as is usual for roads in Chile, of the worst kind.
In the neighbourhood of Puerto Varas the Diuca Sparrows,
which in Chile take the place of our House-Sparrows, were very
numerous ; and the Chimangos, which are the birds of the roads and
are as tame as bam-door fowl, were there as usual. Occasionally I
saw one or two Zonotrichia pileata amongst the Diucas, but these
being of a more retiring and shyer disposition, would always quickly
disappear, leaving the Diucas in evidence.
After about half-an-hour's ride we crossed a stream by a
bridge, which was of the usual Chilian design, that is, it consisted of
a wooden framework on which a number of loose stout planks, full

of holes were laid to form the road. As I passed, a pair of oxen
spanned to a large cart full of wood, showing more sense than their
driver, flatly refused to pass over the miserable structure. My
horse had experience enough to avoid the dangerous places, and we
passed over without mishap.
Near the edge of the stream was a small wooden cabin, and
a tame Long-billed Parrakeet ( Henicognathus leptorhynchus) , which
evidently belonged to the people who lived there, was washing its
head in the water of the river. The poor thing had not only its
wings but also its tail cut short, so that it looked quite a different
little thing from what it ought to look. But in Chile they like to
spoil the beauty of anything they can get hold of.
Following the road, I passed some enclosed fields near a farm-
house, and in one of them about forty Black-faced Ibises (. Theristicus
melanopsis ) had alighted, and were walking about with the greatest
unconcern looking for grubs. Their grey and buff plumage and rosy-
red legs made them objects of great beauty.
The road now led through the remains of a primeval forest
which had been burnt down, and of which the tree stumps were
still standing. Some of them were of enormous size, two or three
yards across, and as the interior was rotten and decayed quite
a little garden of flowering shrubs like fuchsias, Darwin's barberies,
etc. grew on them.
After about two-and-a-half hours ride, we came to the summit
of the rising ground, and as I reached the top the sea lay in front
of me, whilst in a deep and lovely bay on my right was the town of
Puerto Montt. In front, some islands were visible, and in the
distant haze there was the contour of Chiloe. It was a lovely sight.
The town itself has very little to recommend it. It is like nearly all
South American towns, built on the square system. One fairly wide
street runs right through it, and in the middle near* the sea is an
open square or garden, where the "fashionable" people assemble
in the evening and, I believe, hear a band play occasionally. The
streets are all very dusty when the weather is at all dry, as of course
there is no pavement. The " trottoirs " were raised and held by a
square wooden beam, on which I noticed horse-shoes fastened in
such a way as to form rings, and I afterwards saw that they were

Mr. F. E. Blaauw,
used for tying up the saddle-horses to them whilst their masters
went about their business.
After a while, we reached the principal inn of the place,
where we ordered some luncheon, and whilst exploring the building
I found a small courtyard in which a Gull, a White Egret and a
female ashy-headed Goose looked very sad and out of place. The
White Heron, which perhaps looked as miserable as any of the trio,
had not long ago, the host told me, flown away as he had forgotten
to have its wings cut, and after an absence of a few days had
voluntarily come back to re-occupy its dismal place near the small
water-basin. This story the host told me in great triumph as I
remarked to him upon the sad looks of the poor birds.
After luncheon, I enquired about the distance to go to a
German settler whom I wanted to visit, and in true Chilian style
got the wildest ideas and estimates about the situation of this estate,
which I knew to be not very far away. The host told me it would
take three or four hours or more; another man estimated the
distance at two hours, etc., etc. Not trusting any of them, I went
into the town and chanced to find a man who had actually been
there, and told me that I could easily reach the place in an hour-
and-a-half, and this information proved to be true. So having
mounted our horses we left the town in a westerly direction and
without much trouble found the road we wanted.
After having gone uphill for a while the road led amongst the
ghastly-looking remains of burnt forests. I had been told to follow
the road until I passed two lakes, and eventually I reached the first
of the two. This would have been a lovely spot from its shape if
everything round it had not been burnt down. After a while I
passed the second lake, and shortly after this the road entered a
beautiful unharmed forest. I had been told to look for a gate, and
after a while the gate appeared, and passing through it I entered
the forest, which still showed all its original beauty. The road
was nothing else than the bed of a stream, which, for some
reason or other, had changed its course and was winding through
the forest in a most eccentric way. The ground was damp, and
many of the old trees were covered with ferns and lichens, some
white ones hanging down in fringes and other brownish green ones,

growing in cushions and patches. Fuchsias, with their graceful
slender branches full of little scarlet flowers, were particularly
abundant, and on many of the old beeches were bushes of a para-
sitic plant with pale scarlet pipeflowers and pale green square leaves.
On an old tree that was partly decaying, were bushes of a kind of
bromilia with glorious scarlet centres ( Bromelia bicolor). Having
admired these and all the variety of beautiful plants which this part
of Chile offers in abundance, I heard the usual mocking laugh of
Pteroptochus rubecula. The bird that generally laughs at the in-
truder and disappears. This particular bird however was of an
inquisitive disposition, and instead of disappearing it quietly sat in
a tangle of dead wood in a very conspicuous place and watched me
closely. I stopped to look at it, but it did not mind it in the least.
Pteroptochus rubecula is a pretty brown bird with yellow red breast
and eyebrows and intelligent big glittering black eyes. Little light
spots on the sides are an additional ornament. In shape, the bird
is between a robin and a wren, the tail being carried upwards. It is
a little person, that knows what it is about and takes great interest
in what happens in its domain. It is about double the size of our
own robin.
As I went on, a little brown black Wren, larger than our
own bird, and with not quite such an upright tail ( Scytalopus
magellanicus), crossed the road and disappeared in the jungle. After
a while the wood became thinner, and at a curve of the road began
to give way to bamboo bushes with open spaces between them.
Turning to the right the ground rose, and on an eminence clad with
grass stood the house and farm-buildings, all low constructions of
wood and sheet iron. I opened a gate in a wooden fence, entered an
enclosed space and rode to a door that stood ajar. After a while
somebody came forward and told me that the owner was absent, but
that his wife would soon be there, and asked us to alight. This we
did, leaving the horse to take care of itself as is usual in those parts.
The lady of the house having come, show r ed us the farm and grounds
in which I noticed the beautiful strong growth of the fruit trees,
and she told me that they had reclaimed all the land themselves, it
being a virgin forest all over when they took possession of it. When
she showed me her poultry yard, I asked if the foxes did not play

Mr. F. E. Blaauw,
great havoc, the virgin forest being so near. Her answer was that
they poisoned them, and upon my asking her how this was done,
she told me to my horror that they did it by spreading poisoned
birds. " We sow poisoned grain every spring, she added, and this
kills many thousands of little birds, which we use as bait " ! I
pictured to myself all those lovely little Chilian birds lying dead in
thousands, and in the breeding season too, and it was all I could do
to restrain my intense indignation, an expression of which would
have been quite useless ; but one thing I did say, and that was to
warn her that the insect pests would be innumerable if they con-
tinued to wantonly destroy the little birds in that manner. But she
only laughed, saying that they would get no harvest if they did not
poison the little birds. So I daresay that they will go on with it
just as in other parts they wantonly burn their forests until the
climate changes, and no more rain comes, so that parts that were
once overrun by a luxurious vegetation are now arid stone deserts.
Finding me so much interested in birds and in the few nice
shrubs near the house, the farmer's wife advised us to return to
Puerto Varas by a cross-country road which did not touch Puerto
Montt, and which ran a great part of thew&apos;ay through her husband's
estate. I gladly availed myself of her advice, and having thanked
her for her hospitality, we mounted our horses, which were feeding
on the rank grasses near the house, and departed on our journey
hoping not to lose our way.
We at first crossed some grass fields, and others from which
the harvest had been gathered, after which we came to wilder
country, thickly grown with bamboo bushes, and here we came
across some nice-looking cattle that seemed mostly to feed on the
bamboo.
Very soon after having left the house I had noticed a clump
of enormous trees, which from top to bottom were covered with
beautiful large white flowers like apple-blossom. My road led me
close to this clump of trees, but I could not reach the foot of them
as the trunks were standing in an impenetrable tangle of bamboos.
They were giant specimens of Eucnjphia pinnatifolia, or Urmus
trees as they call them in those parts ; and these trees seem to
attain their greatest size in this part of Chile.

Riding on I descended a slope to cross a river and entered a
virgin forest, mostly composed of Urmus trees, although there were
a good many antarctic beeches and a great variety of other trees and
shrubs as is usual in those parts of Chile, which makes those woods
so lovely. The trees were full of Long-billed Parrakeets ( Henicog-
naihus leptorhynchus ) which screamed loudly and were very active,
flying about in small flocks or perching on the tops of the giant
trees. These birds were probably feeding on the seeds of the Urmus
trees, which are very numerous, and on the countless other seeds
and berries as well (the Urmus fruit looks like a small olive).
Although the bill of the Long-billed Parrakeets looks as if it
was made to dig up roots or bulbs, I never saw any of them on
the ground, as long as I was in Chile, in places frequented b}^ those
birds. My tame birds of this species at home, however, delight in
digging up the turf in their aviary and eat the roots of the grass.
The woods also resounded with the calls of the large grey
white-backed Woodpecker (Colaptes pitius) which at this time of the
year goes about in small parties. Riding through woods in Chile I
had often heard a curious trembling noise in the thickest parts of
the forest, but I had never seen the bird itself, although the noise
followed one. This time I was more fortunate, and saw that it
originated from a beautiful golden-brown and black-brown little
creeper-like bird with white underparts, which apparently lived in
the thickest jungle. This bird is Oxyurus spinicauda, and is quite a
feature in the Chilian forest from the way it has of following the
traveller. Although it looks in shape so much like our Tree Creeper
(Certhia familiaris) it does not usually seem to creep up the stems
of the trees like our bird. It is always to be found in the bushes
and tangles at the foot of the big trees, and I never saw it against a
tree. In Punta Arenas, or better in a forest near it, I saw numbers
of them feeding on the fat in the carcase of a lamb which hung in a
tree near a goldwasher's hut. On that occasion they were quite tame.
In the damp places near streams the fuchsia bushes were very
beautiful, as well as the finely subdivided tall ferns with black stems.
In the fuchsias one could usually see a Golden-crowned Humming-
bird ( Eustephanus galeritus), which appeared suddenly, screaming
loudly, to hover under the flowers. It very quickly disappeared,

only to reappear as suddenly as it went. A little farther on several
trees had bunches of a scarlet flowering parasitic plant with square
bluish green leaves. Of these flowers the Humming-birds were also
very fond.
Riding on I came to a tangle of European Brambles which
had spread there in a dreadful manner, and on them quite a flock of
Turdus magellanicus were feeding on the berries ; some flew away as
I approached, but a good many, coming probably from uninhabited
parts, were quite tame and allowed me to pass without disturbing
themselves. I also saw feeding on the fruit of those brambles, some
Phytotonia rara. This same species I saw a couple of weeks earlier
also feeding on the brambles near the road between Osorno and
Puerto Octay.
In some places the bamboos grew against the trees to a great
height, hanging down from the big branches like a creeper. On many
of the shrubs along the road, the beautiful Lapageria rosea, with its
wonderful red bell-like flowers, was quite abundant. That curious
little creeper, Tropoeolum speciosum, is also at home in those woods.
As soon as we neared some settlement the Diucas and the
Chimangos were in evidence, and when we passed a house we were
generally furiously attacked by a lot of ferocious dogs.
After having left a river, the banks of which we had gone
along some time, w r e turned uphill and passed a cut in the mountain
called the " Devil's Glen." In the damp shelter of the Glen the
vegetation was most luxurious. All the beautiful evergreens and
flowering bushes grew there to perfection ; the fuchsias were enor-
mous, and the different species of ferns most wonderful and splendid
also were the tangles of Gunnera scabra.
Once having passed the Glen and having gone over the
mountains, I came to cultivated country, and soon saw Puerto Varas
on the delightful lake of Llanquihue, before me, the snowclad Osorno
Volcano and other giants lifting their summits against the clear
evening sky.
I had decided to go north again next day, taking the steamer
to Puerto Octay, from which place I intended to ride to Osorno.
An hour before I left next morning, I noticed near the inn a tame
long-billed Parrakeet, which, with stunted wings and tail, was sitting

in front of a small house. The little bird was quite tame and was
offered me for a few pesos, as soon as the owner saw that I noticed
it. Bather foolishly, unmindful of all the miles that separated me
from home, I could not resist the temptation, and bought the bird,
carrying him to the inn in my hand, and as no such thing as a cage
was to be had anywhere, I with great difficulty arranged a little box
to put him in. This was just finished when I had to go on board
the steamer with all my belongings. In Osorno I managed to get a
mate for the little bird, and brought the pair safely home, via the
Straits of Magellan, Tierra del Fueg&apos;o, the Smith Channel, etc., etc.,
where I still have them in splendid plumage at Gooilust, and when
their shrill voices ring through the air in the garden where they
inhabit an open aviary, it reminds me of the splendid woods and
mountains of Southern Chile.

Travellers in Egypt will very probably have caught sight of
this strikingly handsome 11 Wheatear," if that name can be applied
to any other of the species besides our own British bird : and the
illustration will at once explain the colouring, for with the exception
of the under-tail coverts, which are reddish buff, this Chat is black
and white, although the primaries and secondaries of the wings are
in reality deep brown, but the effect is a black and white bird. The
female is the same, but slightly duller in colouring, although one
would have expected her to be less conspicuous.
This species occurs in South-Eastern Europe and North-
Eastern Africa. It has been met with in Italy and Greece, but as
rather an uncommon visitor, I take it.
It is not uncommon in parts of Turkey, in Europe ; and very
common in New Russia, arriving, like our Wheatear does here, as
one of the earliest of the spring migrants. In Palestine it is
common, and Canon Tristram recorded it as being found 4 &apos;throughout
the year in the rocky regions overhanging the Jordan Valley in the
Judaean Wilderness."

On the Piecl Chat.
It is universally distributed throughout the Sinaitic peninsula,
from the highest mountains to the seashore. In Africa it is found
in Egypt, Nubia, Arabia and Abyssinia.
Whether any of our members have ever possessed any of the
Pied Chats in captivity, I do not know, but in an aviary a pair would
be strikingly handsome, and therefore I have given an illustration of
it, in the event of anyone, unacquainted with it, being fired with the
desire to obtain some living specimens.
All the members of the Chat family -- Saxicola, etc., are very
attractive, both in plumage and demeanour. A hand-reared Wheatear
which I once had, was so tame that he would play " hide and seek "
with me when out of his cage, popping in under chairs and sofas,
sometimes to pop out again behind me when I was searching under
the piece of furniture beneath which he had disappeared.
I forget whether I have recorded the sad event, but this
charming bird was killed owing to this. I shall never forget the
poignancy of my feelings. As I rose up from looking under a sofa, I
set my heel right on to the poor little Wheatear, crushing his life out
to my intense horror. He had swiftly emerged round the other side
of the sofa, when my back was turned towards him, and was
evidently, as he had often done on previous occasions, waiting behind
me to surprise me and had stationed himself just by one of my feet.
I was about to add that it was a terrible moment, but it was
more than that, for it took me a long time to forget it, at its worst,
and to forget it altogether, I never can, although it occured some
thirteen years ago. I never saw a bird so deliberately play with one
for when he bobbed out from behind a chair, he would pirouette up
to me with his wings extended, daring me to catch him, and when I
made a feint so to do, he would flit off again, appearing round from
the other side of the chair to repeat his frolics. It was no question
of mealworms or other bird-delicacies, it was nothing but a romp,
as one would with a puppy or a kitten.
So that I think, if hand-reared Pied Chats could be obtained;
a romping, frolicsome Pied Chat, such as was my "never-to-be-
forgotten" Wheatear; some lucky aviculturist would possess a very
charming playfellow.

At the Scilly Isles a very large number of small rocky islands
are inhabited only by wild birds, where gorse, bracken, and thrift
grows above the high tide confine. The gorse is always more or less
in flower, but in the springtime it makes large patches of the most
brilliant golden-yellow, forming a wonderful contrast to the pure
blues, greens and purples of the sea. Here the linnets twitter
merrily and nest.
The sea-pink, or thrift, in May is a wonderful wealth of
colour ; a rosy pink carpet, especially on the island of Annette, where
it covers the whole of the ground up to the big boulders on the verge
of the sea, but of this particular island I hope to write another time.
In the autumn, the bracken turns into brilliant yellows, golds
and browns, and again the blue sea, and it is really blue, forms a
most striking contrast. On some of these uninhabited islands a few 7
wild Duck nest where there is no fresh water for their young to be
brought up on. But the parent birds carefully think out their
whole plan of providing for their young beforehand, and a daring
plan it sometimes appears to be.
Last spring, a launch was steaming down the channel between
some of these islands, when the boatman suddenly noticed a bird
with apparently a long tail, on the water: steaming nearer he
discovered it to be a common wild duck with a brood of fourteen
young ones following behind as closely as possible. &amp;quot; These had
evidently come from the island of Samson, which lies about three
quarters of a mile across the sea to the westward of Tresco, and
the old bird was wfisely braving the elements, not to mention the
Gulls, to bring her family to the fresh water pools of Tresco : for
the shores of which island she and her ducklings were making as
quickly as possible.
On landing there they had a steep sand bank to walk up and
rough ground with bracken and brambles to get through ; altogether
a quarter of a mile to cross before the fresh water w r as reached.

The Endurance of young Wild Ducks.
The whole brood apparently arrived safely, as a duck with
fourteen young ones was seen there the next day. How many she
succeeded in rearing I do not know, but the ravages of gulls, eels,
and rats usually reduce the number of young ducks considerably.
I have seen an old duck bravely defending her brood from a Lesser
Black-backed Gull, standing&apos; up and fighting for her family like a
true Briton.
Some years the Gulls seem much more voracious than others,
and Lesser Black-backs, which certainly are the commonest here,
seem the most voracious of their tribe, even attacking and killing
Puffins on the outer islands where they all nest together.
I have seen an unfortunate young wild duck bobbing up and
down on the water, an eel having caught it by the leg, poor little
dear ! until it finally disappeared altogether. There are some very
large eels in the pool too, one having been caught weighing 7j lbs.,
a broad nosed eel. They appear to flourish in the rather shallow
muddy water, and also have not far to go to get out into the ocean
to their 100 fathom spawning ground.
Every year the gulls have to pay toll for their ravages, and
one or two have to be shot and hung up as a warning to their
brothers not to intrude where the young wild ducks are being
reared.
There are usually two pairs of Peregrins that breed on the
outer rocks, and these also are a great source of danger to all young
birds, but their usual fancy is the young white Wyandottes, rather
than wild ducklings. An old Peregrin took between 40 to 50 one
year, till at last the poultry-man could stand it no longer and the
poor Peregrin had to pay for his ravages. The last few years we
have had no trouble with these, and they have contented themselves
with small birds ; sad to say usually Blackbirds, Thrushes, Turn-
stones and Redshanks; gradually attacking larger birds as their
young get older. Puffins and Razorbills being about the last to be
attacked by them when the family are nearly full-grown.
I have found nests of the common wild duck on other of the
outer islands, from whence they have even farther to travel on the
sea, before they are able to reach the fresh water pools with their
families.

In a Review in the January number of a little pamphlet
" For Love of Beasts," published by the Wild Birds' Protection
Society, the pamphlet in question is accused of hindering the ad-
vancement of Science by calling attention to many acts of cruelty
to animals and biids that go on unchecked, not only in this country-
I have read the little brochure, and can only find in it a protest--
which every naturalist could not but endorse--against needless or self-
ish cruelty : but no ' hit ' aimed at a legitimate study of animal life.
As an aviculturist, I for one, should be inexpressibly thankful
if a law against the wanton and indiscriminate capture and improper
caging of birds were put into force ; a strict supervision of dealers'
shops made compulsory, and bird traffic relegated to those dealers
who recognize their duty towards the inferior Creation, and under-
stand the nature and needs of the birds they sell.
The Review further advises that such protests as appear in
the pamphlet were best directed against the plumage traffic, and the
wholesale slaughter of beautiful birds for the milliners' shops.
Fiendishly barbarous as this slaughter unquestionably is, and
for which there is no shadow of excuse (for the plumage of game
or poultry would answer their purpose just as well) is the fate of
the birds caught alive in millions to furnish the dealers' shops
one whit less pitiable ? I think, if possible, it is even more so, for
whereas the poor birds caught for their plumage are at all events put
out of their misery, those destined for sale alive have to linger on in
suffering--suffering of the very worst kind that can be imagined,
the bird being deprived of every condition of life suitable to its
needs in the shops of those dealers who are quite ignorant of the
requirements of the birds they sell, and only deal in them for gain.
A more flagrant injustice could never be perpetrated on a living
creature. No one knows better than the aviculturist that the needs
of a bird are fresh air, space to fly, clean water to drink and bathe
in, and food and fresh soil suited to its nature.
What then is the lot of birds in such shops ? Imprisonment in
a cage, too often not large enough for it to turn in, and never cleaned ;

For Love of Birds.
a stifling, foeted atmosphere, owing to thousands of filthy cages with
many diseased birds in them; gaslight flaring into their eyes for hours
when the little head should be tucked under the wing in the restful
dark ; no fresh water--often no water ; and, in place of the sweet
fresh grass or earth, filth accumulated, on which too often quite the
wrong food, sour and tainted, is thrown. Is it possible to imagine
greater torture for a creature so exquisitely and delicately organised
as a bird ? And, alas ! this is no fanciful picture, hut a stern and
hideous reality, in a country that boasts of a high state of civiliza-
tion ! Aviculture is a fascinating pursuit, and enables man and his
little bird brother to know and love each other, but as a Wild Birds'
Protectionist, I often have heart-searching&apos;s not only as to whether
aviculture justifies the forcible detention of cretures to whom free
dom is a birthright, and for which their whole nature and being are
adapted, but in the thought, that by the purchase of even one little
bird, I am indirectly contributing to all this suffering by helping to
make a market, even though I may have bought it only to set it free !
Then there is another side to the picture. Vast host of
birds perish annually during migration, or fall a prey to their natural
enemies, of whom they have always to live in fear, and thousands
die of starvation during a severe winter. Compare the lot of a bird
in a happy home, with its natural surroundings and a kind human
friend to care for it, with that of those I have just mentioned. A
life of liberty would not seem to be a state of unmixed bliss. The
study of birds is a beautiful and interesting pursuit under humane
conditions, but are the means employed to arrive at it humane ?
We know they are not, and that the suffering and waste of bird-life
is ghastly and appalling. It surely lies with the aviculturist there-
fore to endeavour to remedy this evil. It is a responsibility we
cannot shake off if we would.
The Review I have alluded to deals also with the question of
the alleged great inferiority of a birds' mental faculties to those of
man, even denying that a bird has memory, and cares only for its
food supply, plus of course kind treatment. But if a bird is a
creature of such limited understanding, and so extremely uninterest-
ing, what is there in aviculture to learn, as its physical structure is
well known ?

But who is to place limits to mind ? If a bird has mental
faculties at all, it has mind. Its senses are far more highly developed
than man's : its sensations probably equal in proportion to its place
in Creation. Man is unquestionably lord of creation, the whole
of the rest of Creation mysteriously linked with him, and the
little bird brother one of the most marvellous and beautiful of
all created beings. As to the senses of a bird, what human being
ever possessed the eye-sight of the Hawk or Eagle, or even of
other smaller birds ? Or their sense of hearing ? Their power to
detect wholesome food at a glance, or the presence of a human
hand that has been about their nest ? Their extraordinary sensi-
tiveness of touch ? And as to memory, does not the swallow find
its way from distant lands, year after year, back to the old haunts
it loves ? The pet bird pines and refuses food if deprived of its loved
owner, and remembers him, or her, again after a long lapse of time,
even years. What is this but memory ? Who then shall say that
in the miserable prison it is doomed to at the dealers, it does not
remember happier days and pine for lost liberty ? I do not hesitate
to affirm that I am certain it does, and that in that little breast
there are longings and regrets of which we grosser mortals reck
little or nothing. I conceive it to be no more than our bounden
duty if we cause a bird to be deprived of freedom, to see that it shall
find in man not an enemy but a friend and protector.

The persistent mild Southerly and S. Westerly winds which
have been going on ever since the early part of November (with the
exception of about ten days of dry cold weather with the wind
Easterly, which occurred about the latter end of last month) has
brought on the growth of vegetation at a tremendous pace. We are
practically five weeks in advance.
In the woods there are green carpets of bluebells quite five
inches high, the foxgloves have grown six inches in length, ferns in
places have not died down, some have remained green all the winter.

Mr. P. F. M. Galloway.
the Almond is in bloom, only instead of at Easter, the wild Bullace
and Blackthorn have been in full bloom for some time past.
Nearly a month ago, I visited an open common in Oxford-
shire, and the furze was quite yellow with bloom, and a pair of
Stonechats were flitting about on the topmost sprays, the cock bird
was wonderfully forward in colour, being as bright as you would
find him early in May.
Hawfinches are to be seen about their breeding haunts, quite
a number of them, and are in song much earlier than usual.
A gamekeeper told me that he found a Blackbird's nest which
contained eggs, this year as early as 20th of February, and the bird
had commenced incubating.
Redwings, which usually flock together prior to their depar-
ture to the north about the end of March, are now in large flocks,
and may be heard already singing together loudly. The Chaffinch,
which usually comes into song early in March has been singing
freely and in rivalry for close upon three wneks.
Starlings are separating from the flocks and can be seen here
and there hanging around their old nesting-places, especially in the
morning time ; this generally takes place at the end of March instead
of the beginning. Green Woodpeckers have already started their
rattling or boring noise made by striking the bill in rapid succession
against the tree trunk, probably to attract a mate, as this is one of
the Green Woodpeckers ways of making love; the other way is, that
when the cock bird is near the hen, especially when on the ground
in a meadow, he will continually nod his head up and down and
make a low-pitched noise, nodding the head up and down much
after the fashion of a Drake. The hen appears to take no notice of
him, but they evidently understand each other.
These mild open winters are a great help to this species and
should cause the Green Woodpecker to become more numerous, for
although this bird can stand as much cold as a common House
Sparrow, yet if snow and hard frost should last under a fortnight,
this species is the first to die of starvation, as it subsists almost
entirely on ants in winter and ants and their eggs in summer.
The first of this species to die off are those that are in a
neighbourhood where they are compelled to feed upon the small

black and the yellow ant, which they find in the large hillocks in
rough grass fields and on open commons ; as soon as the snow covers
these to any depth they are done.
Those birds that are able to wriggle on until a thaw sets in,
are those that are in a district where the large wood ants nests are
to be found in pine woods, they know where these nests abound and
will regularly visit them and will bore deep holes into these large
heaps of pine needles, the holes often being as large as a rabbit
would make, and here they are able to find the ants in winter in a
numbed or torpid state and lick them up.
The Lesser and Greater Spotted Woodpeckers appear to get
through severe weather better, especially the latter species, as they
will feed upon nuts, acorns, and even beechmasts when insect food
is scarce and never touch ants, therefore there is a great difference
in the way in which the Green and the Spotted Woodpeckers feed
their young. If an observer discovers a nest of the Green and is
able to keep himself out of sight and yet be close to the nest hole, as
I have done, he will see the old birds come to the hole, with nothing
showing in their bill at all, go into the nest and remain in the hole
for quite a minute and a half, come out and fly off, and will often
not return to feed the young for nearly two hours. The reason is
this, the ants and their eg&apos;gs are licked up from the ant's nest and
stored in the throat and probably in the bill as well, and are ejected
in ball-like masses into the mouths of the young, and these masses
of ants brought at a time are evidently large, at any rate, enough to
satisfy the young for some considerable time.
The Spotted Woodpeckers, on the other hand, visit the young
in the nest-hole every few minutes, and grubs and caterpillars can
be seen hanging in the point of the bill of the parent birds.
The male Great Spotted Woodpeckers have already begun
their Spring quarrels. In fact, nearly everything is earlier this year
except the Cuckoo, and although it has been reported as having been
heard, it is not likely to be here any earlier this year than any
other, and we shall have to wait until between the 12th and 17th
of April before we hear the notes from a real live Cuckoo.

At this time of the year, when many species are contemplat-

Where space allows, if there are no living&apos; bushes, branches of Scotch
fir, when obtainable, last a long time, and can be propped up in
corners. Fresh bare branches can also be put in for perching on,
and these always look better than straight perches from the car-
penter's or cage-maker's shop. Willow is good, and sycamore.
Branches that seem quite insignificant when cut from a tree, assume
tree-like proportions when fixed in an aviary.
If any portion of the latter is turfed, it is a good thing to
remove the old turf, level the ground, sprinkle fine sand, and relay
it with fresh turves. Where there are Thrushes, a nice quantity of
earthworms can be thrown on to the earth, and covered up with the
turf, so that they will not all be devoured at once, but work their
way up in a natural manner ; giving the birds something to do, and
probably affording them some sport in catching them.
All nesting-boxes for Parrakeets, Grassfinches, etc. should be
well scoured.
For Parrakeets, there is nothing to beat natural hollow logs,
with plenty of dry rotten wood inside, but all aviaries are not large
enough to contain them, and everyone has not the opportunity of
obtaining them. Lacking these, the best nesting-boxes are those
which are sold by the Selborne Society, etc. The boxes must be
rounded off in a cup shape within, so that the eggs cannot roll away
from beneath the sitting bird, and in the case of Parrakeets, a hand-
full of dry decayed wood can be put in. They prefer the entrance
hole to he as small as possible, but the box must not be too deep, or
the young might be unable to climb out when they are ready to fly.
Where natural hollow log&apos;s can be obtained, they are best
placed horizontally on cross bars under an overhanging eave. Many
birds will be reminded of their parental duties and privileges by the
introduction of suitable nesting sites and materials.
Open baskets may be hung up, where the rain cannot reach,
filled with hay, moss, dead leaves, bents of coarse grass, and
feathers, etc. Many birds seem to like dry bamboo leaves, amongst

other materials ; and for doves and pigeons, the finer twigs of spruce,
etc., as well as heather bents are acceptable.
Only one pair of certain species of birds should be kept in an
aviary, for instance those of the Thrush family. Doves also are
very pugnacious, disturbing each other dreadfully, if several breed-
ing pairs are kept together.
I believe that quite small aviaries with, for example, one pair
of Blue Birds, or Orange-headed Ground Thrushes, or Shamahs,
etc., etc. are preferable, giving much more chance of success in
breeding than where there are a lot of birds of various species
mixed together, unless an aviary be very spacious, with plenty of
nesting places for all.
Parrot Finches are better alone, but several pairs can be kept
together&apos;, so long as they are in pairs, and the same thing applies to
the Australian Grassfinches; except perhaps in the case of the
Crimson Finch, which can make itself extremely disagreeable, mili-
tantly breaking its neighbours' windows, destroying their homes,
and generally interfering with other people's affairs ! ! But Crimson
Finches are not the only two-legged creatures that behave in this
vulgar and blatant manner !
Tutto il mondo e paese, as the Italians say, which, being in-
terpreted, is " All the world is one country " ; the naughty tempers
and bad habits to be found in ourselves, are also innate within our
aviaries ! Only we humans are worse, for at any rate birds are
total abstainers, with a few exceptions, and then they only break
through their rule through human influence, as once happened when
Bishop Wilberforce -- the famous Bishop of Oxford as was--tempted
a Blue-fronted Amazon to sip port wine [I remember the incident
vividly when quite a small boy] with the consequence that the
Parrot ended by reeling about the dinner table, much to everyone's
amusement, not excluding the Bishop's. Whether it was the result
of the port wine, I know not, but not very long after, that Parrot
laid an egg !
It is advisable to place the food in a tray-like open box, with
sides about three or four inches high, so that seeds, etc. are not
littered about. I have these trays lined with zinc, so that they
can be scalded out at times.

Hints about Aviaries.
Flowering grasses, chiekweed, etc., are best placed in the form
of a miniature sheaf of corn, the stems tied round with a piece of
wire, or else the whole bunch can he wired round a stick driven into
the ground. In this way, the birds can pull and peck at the green
food as if it w r ere fixed by natural roots, and at the same time it is
not littered about. It is most important to give fresh green stuff
every day during the spring, summer, and early autumn.
In the autumn too, there are elder and hawthorn berries, etc.
Thrushes and other birds are very fond of the fruit of the Physalis,
or Cape Gooseberry, which must he removed from the outer sheath.
[Bye-the-bye! it makes good jam for ourselves !
Grit is another necessity. Such little fellows as Melba
Finches, Violet-eared Waxbills and the like, greedily devour oyster-
shell grit : a small quantity of which, according to the number of
the birds, can be placed in a red earthenware saucer. Talking of
that, glazed red or green earthemvare is best ; it can he kept cleaner.
Where pheasants, partridges and quails are kept, fresh lettuce
and other green food is most important, and here again the lettuces
can be tied to a stick fixed in the ground. These birds need fresh
salad, berries, fruit, etc. just as much as geese need grass, and ducks
and swans, water plants.
If gentles are given to insectivorous birds, great care must be
taken that they are clean. A good way of collecting these nasty
squirmy things, is to fix up a small rainproof shelter, so long as you
can fix it far enough away from your nose, hook up a bucket or tin,
with holes bored in the bottom, and a piece of meat suspended
inside, and then place a box with clean sawdust beneath. The
maggots when ready to leave the nest, will drop through the holes
into the saw dust, from which they can he collected ; but if they
show any dark stain in their little insides, don't give them to your
birds, or they will have something in their's, which may cause them
to turn up their toes. H. D. A.

GARDENS.
Some additions have recently been made to the fine collection
of pheasants at the Gardens. The Marquess of Tavistock presented
a pair of Horsfield's Purple Kaleege Pheasants and a pair of Ander-
son's Kaleege was purchased, while Mr. W. 0. Dankwerts, K.C.
has presented a pair of Cabot's Tragopans, and Mrs. Johnstone has
deposited two cock Mikado Pheasants.
A pair of Piping Guans ( Pipile cumanensis) from Trinidad,
presented by Mr. L. Leslie Moore, form a very interesting addition
to the collection, as they belong to a species which has not been
represented for a number of years. It is a very handsome species,
black in colour with a greenish gloss, with white on the top of the
head and wing-coverts ; a naked patch round the eyes, of greenish
blue, and a large blue wattle. Like most of the Guans, they are
quite tame, and we hope there may be a chance of their breeding.
Twenty-four hybrid Jung&apos;le-fowl have been hatched, the male
parent being the fine green Javan Jungle-fowl (Galius varius), and
the female, the Bankiva or Red Jungle-fowl.
Some months ago five young Cassowaries were deposited by
the Hon. Walter Rothschild, and now that they are developing the
characteristic colouring on their heads two have been identified as
Casuarius keysseri, a species only very recently described by Mr.
Rothschild from German New Guinea.
A fine specimen of the Greenland Falcon, captured on board
ship in mid-Atlantic, has been presented to the Society by Lt.-Col.
Drage, R.H.G. and the Hon. John H. Ward, C.Y.O.
A very interesting collection of Indian birds has been pre-
sented by Major Perreau, amongst which may be specially mentioned
a Rufous-headed Crow Tit (. Scceorhynchus ruficeps), a female Great
Niltava ( Niltava grandis ), two short&apos;billed Minivets (Pericrocotus
brevirostris), four Rufous-necked Laughing - thrushes ( Dryonastes
ruficollis ) one Grey-sided Laughing-thrush ( D. ccerulatus) , two white-
tailed Blue Robins (. Notodela leucura ) and an Ashy-headed Scimiter
Babbler ( Pomatorhinus schisticeps) . D. S-S.

An illustrated monthly magazine which is the outcome of the
exhibition of work by members of the Zoological Photographic Club,
which was held at the offices of the Zoological Society of London
last summer.
To those who can afford this work, it will be an interesting
and valuable addition to any collection of publications on Natural
History. It is evident that a great stride has been made in photo-
graphy of wild creatures in their native haunts and surroundings,
and it is also evident that the photographs are taken in that way.
There is no faking and no stuffing. The mammals, birds, fish, and
insects are alive, whilst many of the reproductions of their life are
extremely artistic pictures.
The magazine was first published in January of this year, in
which number may be perhaps especially admired&apos; the photographs
of the Little Egret in their nesting haunts in the south of Spain, by
Mr. Wm. Farren; the different poses of the British Wild Cat,
by Mr. Douglas English, who is the Editor ; the Ring Ouzel with
its nest and young ones, by Mr. Alfred Taylor.
In the letterpress too, one finds much that is interesting, and
much that is original; indeed all is written by the various photo-
graphers, who describe what they saw when taking their pictures.
The February number of " Wild Life" is perhaps even more
interesting than the pioneer of the work, beginning with a very
striking photograph, as a frontispiece, of one of the few apes now
left on the Rock of Gibraltar, its form profiled against the pale
mistiness of the sea, below the rock on which it is seated, apparently
admiring the view ! Mrs. Moore is the successful photographer of
this pathetically solitary and human-like figure.
Mr. A. M. Stewart's photos, of the Fulmar Petrel in Westray
-- an island of the Orkney group--are a triumph of the camera,
especially perhaps the one that shows the nesting ledges of Guille-

mots, Kittewakes and Fulmars on the face of a precipitous rock,
looking almost as if one of the birds themselves, taking the camera,
had flown out over the sea, made the exposure, and returned it
safely into the owner's hands !
There are successful photos, of Herons and their nests, by
Mr. Alfred Taylor, and a splendid one of a fox ; " Madra Ruad,"
(the Red Dog) as he is styled in Ould Ireland, by Mr. Douglas
English.
We are more concerned with the birds, as aviculturists, but
nevertheless no one who loves wild life, can fail to be interested in
the photographs of fish, taken under water in their native ponds and
streams.
For adults who know their subjects, this publication cannot
but be interesting, for the rising generation it will be a means of
education, an encouragement to arm themselves with the camera
rather than the gun, to study wild life, sooner than destroy it !

A book which all book-lovers should read, albeit pathetic,
sad, and one might say heart-rending.
It is described as a practical treatise on the extermination and
preservation of wild life, a protest against slaughter, a call to arms
in defence of wildlife, which will be heartily welcomed by the friends
of the wild birds and mammals throughout the world.
Dealing very largely with facts about the destruction of wdld
creatures in North America; for Mr. Hornaday is an American and
the Director of the New York Zoological Park ; it nevertheless is
world-wide in its statistics and interest. In a 'foreword,' Professor
Henry Fairfield Osborn, the President of the New York Zoological
Society, writes in clear and decisive warning. He speaks of the
forceful pages of this book as reminding him of the sounding of the
great bells in the watch-towers of the cities of the Middle Ages,
which called to arms the citizens to protect their homes, their

liberties, and their happiness. " The whole earth," writes Professor
Osborn, "is a poorer place to live in when a colony of exquisite
" Egrets or Birds of Paradise is destroyed in order that the plumes
" may decorate the hat of some lady of fashion, and ultimately find
" their way into the rubbish heap." .... " The facts and figures
" set forth in this volume will astonish all those lovers of Nature and
" friends of the animal world who are living in a false or imaginary
" sense of security. The logic of these facts is inexorable."
There are 44 chapters, each one teeming with interest for the
ornithologist and the humane hearted, but of such a nature that if
the pages of this book are perused before bed-time, one wonders what
form of night-mare one will have to go through, during sleep ?
What concerns us in England in the first place is to be especially
found in the chapter upon the " Extermination of birds for women's
hats," for London has the greatest feather market in the world, the
feather industry wants the money , and the London feather industry
is willing to spend money in fighting to retain its strangle-hold on
the unprotected birds of the world.
Our Society was founded for the study of British and foreign
birds in freedom and captivity. We who are members love them in
their freedom, and when we limit that freedom by keeping a few of
them in what is called captivity, we still afford them liberty to live,
liberty to sing, liberty to propagate their species, as the granting of
medals to various members for the latter accomplishment, proves.
But the captivity which means unmerciful destruction for mere
gourmandizing and adornment of hats for personal vanity, we will
have none of. We aviculturists love our birds, and when we read
Mr. Hornaday's account of "the Bird tragedy on Laysan Island"--
Chap. XIY. -- we must needs rise up and turn militant, because
"London has the greatest feather-market in the world." On Layson
300,000 albatrosses, gulls, and terns, were butchered with the most
revolting and heartless cruelty during the space of several consecutive
months, the wings being cut from living birds which were left to die
of hemorrhage. There is a photograph in the book, taken in 1911,
showing acres of albatross bones bleaching in the sun : the feathers
of which birds have been used to trim and " adorn " the hats of the
women of "civilized" nations! "What the eye does not see the

witnessed, and never will in this life, the Paradise Birds spreading
their nuptial plumes in the forests of New Guinea ; the colonies of
the White Egrets, flying in companies against an azure sky ; the
splendid Crowned Pigeons drumming out their resounding notes in
their native jungles ; the Humming Birds glittering with all the
jewels of the earth, as they flash amongst the valleys and mountains
of the great continent of South America ; but for all that we like to
know they are there, we like to ponder upon the marvels of age-long
evolution which has developed them into what they are ; and, unless
man steps in, will still develop them into what they will be.
But that is the whole point of " Our Vanishing Wild Life " !
Man and woman has stepped in--man to kill, woman to wear!
The book is full of illustrations, amongst which are excellent
portraits of some of the well-known birds of the United States, that
of the merry Rose-breasted Grosbeak being especially good.
It is a book to possess, and a book to give away : but do not
give away your only copy, unless perchance by so doing you may
convert one sinner. H. D. A.

Part I. of the fourth volume of the second edition of Mr.
North's magnificent work, the previous parts of which have already
been noticed in this journal, is to hand, and deals with the Ibises,
Spoonbills, Herons, Storks, Swans, Geese and Ducks. Written in
the very thorough and exhaustive style characteristic of Mr. North's
work, and containing very full field notes, it forms a most useful and
valuable work on the groups of which it treats.
Of the splendid Straw-necked Ibis, the author tells us that it
has been distinguished by some pastoralists as the most useful bird
in Australia, destroying as it does vast quantities of injurious insects
of all kinds.
A long account is given of the Nankeen Night-Heron, which
reminds the writer of a most interesting sight he witnessed one
evening at dusk in the Zoological Gardens at Melbourne. Walking
round with the Director, as we approached a lake we noticed that
every tall tree in its vicinity was covered with these birds, while

others continued to arrive, preparatory to their descent upon the
edges of the ponds and streams in the neighbourhood.
A curious habit of the Maned Goose or " Wood Duck " is
recorded by one of Mr. North's correspondents, namely, that of a
pair taking charge of the young of several other pairs, besides their
own. " Where they breed in great numbers," writes Mr. Thos. P.
Austin, "one pair of old birds will sometimes take possession of
several families. At Wambiana Station, on the Macquarie Biver,
my brother and self saw a pair of old birds with over fifty young;
we tried to count them, but could not, but were sure there were
over fifty, and we could easily distinguish four different clutches,
probably more."
It is curious that two species of Teal so closely allied as are
the Chestnut-breasted and Slender Teal should inhabit the same
country, although one is more generally distributed than the other.
Mr. North gives full accounts of both these species which have
confused many ornithologists. In the Chestnut-breasted Teal
(Nettium castaneum) the male is brilliantly coloured, with green
head and neck and red breast, but the female is practically indis-
tinguishable from the two sexes of the Slender Teal ( N. gibberifrons).
The former, of which several may be seen at the London Zoological
Gardens, is the rarer, occurring chiefly round the coast line of Aus-
tralia and in Tasmania, whereas the latter is widely distributed in
Australia, and occurs also in New Zealand and the adjacent Islands.
CORRESPONDENCE, NOTES, (R)c.
A USEFUL MEDICINE FOR GASTRO-ENTERITIS.
Mr. P. F. M. Galloway, writing of illnesses in birds, mentions that they
die chiefly through lung or bowel troubles, the latter being due to gastro-
enteritis.
He says-- " The symptons are these--A bird that has been looking nice
" and tight in feather is suddenly seen to look soft in feather. It eats well, but
" loses flesh rapidly, which is due to the pain in the bowels, causing the bird to
"look puffed out and soft."
Mr. Galloway then goes on to speak of Ditchfield's Tonic Drops, which
he says he tried with a severe test. A Golden-crested Wren was very bad with
gastro-enteritis. The little bird was picked up from the floor of an aviary, and

two small drops, undiluted, were put into its mouth. It was then placed on a
perch in a cage, but it fell on its back, to be once more put up, when it fell
forward-and shuffled along into the comer of the cage, putting its head under
its feathers and seeming in a hopeless way.
In half-an-hour's time it was up on a perch--its insectivorous food was
taken away, and only fresh insects given it, and twenty drops of the same tonic
in a tablespoonful of warm water, as cold drink increases the pain, and birds
-with this disease are thirsty. At noon the little Goldcrest was drinking the
medicine, and also feeding, looking certainly better.
Mr. Galloway had to be absent from home after that, until 4 p.m., when
he found this small creature as tight in feather as possible, quite lively, and all
its insect food eaten up! "The marvellous thing was,'' Mr. Galloway says,
" that in nine hours after having taken the medicine, the bird regained nearly
" all its lost flesh, and at night, on handling it, it was quite plump.''

CURIOUS FRIENDSHIPS.
SIR,--On pp. 183-4 of our last number, some notes appeared of curious
friendships amongst Mrs. Noble's birds. The same kind of thing has happened
here more than once. For instance :--
In July, 1886, I obtained a male Black-backed Piping-Crow--a rare species
in those days. After a while, I introduced a female Chinese Jay-Thrush into
the same aviary, who, finding the Piper unattached, quickly sought his pro-
tection, and very soon the two were fast friends. Not only did they associate
together and sit side-by-side during the day, but they invariably slept together,
the comparatively small Jay-Thrush cuddling up for warmth and safety amongst
the feathers of her stalwart champion.
In the course of time, I obtained a male Chinese Jay-Thrush, and placed
him along with the other birds. Alas for the fickleness and ingratitude of the
sex ! The little woman, without a moment's hesitation, without even a chirp of
thanks, forthwith turned tail on her trusty guardian who had watched over her
so faithfully when he might have eaten her (and it would have served her right)
--and went off after the other fellow ! Reginald PHILLIPPS.
AN AVIARY BURNT.
SIR,--I feel sure that other aviculturists will sympathise in the loss of all
my best birds that I sustained the night of April 5th.
I have a large cage aviary divided into two parts, all facing south, and in
the day the glass shutters are down and at night they are put up. It is an
ideal aviary, the only thing wanting are extra wire runs at each end. As I have
some birds that like warmth I tried to heat the building from the house by pipes
and acetelene gas, but as I thought it unsafe and gave off fumes I did not try it
one day but took it out and went to the expense of a boiler and hot water

apparatus. The entrance, with double wire doors, was at the back and the
heating boiler was surrounded by galvanized iron with a large air space between
it and the aviary. It has been working satisfactorily since January.
The whole building is tarred outside and creosoted inside, except the front
which was newly painted, and it was about fifty yards from the house in a line
with my bedroom. I woke about 4 a.m. with a light in my room and my first
thought was the house was on fire, then I looked and saw enormous flames
coming out of the aviary. Even from that distance I could see it was hopeless.
Nothing could be done to save the birds and the only thing is, I hope the fumes
of creosote overtook them and stupified them before being burnt.
We prevented the surrounding bushes from catching fire and luckily the
wind blew the flames away from the house over the lawn. There is not a plant
left standing.
Amongst some of the birds were a Rose-breasted Grosbeak, two Argentine
Thrushes (imported personally), one pair Orange-breasted Ground Thrushes, pair
Green Cardinals, Blue Budgerigars, Gouldians, pair Parrot Finches (breeders),
Stonechat, Diamond, Long-tailed, Grass and other Finches, in all about forty
birds and some very tame.
I cannot think how the aviary got on fire. It is very sad, to think I put
in the apparatus to make the birds happy and safe from fire and now this has
occurred. I have used a paraffin stove in the lower aviary, with great fear, some
years past during intense frosts. I once tried a carbon stove in the aviary that
was burnt, but that gave off fumes and killed eight birds and I luckily
discovered it in time to save the lot. M. C. HAWKE.
THE HABITS OF LIOTHRIX LUTE A.
SIR,--Dr. Butler's able article on the sexes of Liothrix lutea which
appears in the current issue of the Avicultural Magazine will, doubtless, have
been read with interest by admirers of this engaging species--now so commonly
kept by bird-lovers; and his notes, aided by the beautifully-coloured plate, cannot
fail to prove of value to those aviculturists who have hitherto experienced
difficulty in distinguishing between the male and female bird.
That this difficulty is very real is testified to by the fact that very many
experts of considerable experience have found the sexing of L. lutea a veritable
stumbling-block ; small wonder, then, that amateur bird-keepers are so easily
deceived. If a word of advice be acceptable to such--one would counsel a rigid
avoidance of all consignments of so-called cheap birds when the purchase of a male
specimen is in contemplation; one's experience in matters of this kind is
usually bought dearly, and it will be found to pay best in the long run to put
down a fair price and get the genuine article, which can generally be accomplished
by going in the first place to a reliable dealer, verb. sap.
One point in Dr. Butler's notes would seem to be of special interest, viz. :
his reference to the Tit-like habits of L. lutea , and the expressed opinion that
this species does not hold its prey under its claws in order to pick it to pieces.

My own experience is somewhat at variance with that quoted by the
talented author, for I have recently observed the male of a pair of Hill Tits in
my possession vigorously hammering at a piece of fibre held between the claws of
one foot; whilst as I write these notes, both the male and female--separately
caged--are each engaged in tearing piecemeal at a soaked currant held in a
similar manner--the cock on the floor of his cage, and the hen on her perch.
Those who have studied the habits of our British Titmice will, no doubt, be
familiar with this characteristic method of "negotiating" a more than usually
tough morsel.
If I may be permitted to mention yet another peculiarity in the behaviour
of my Hill Tits, it is the curious habit they have of occasionally throwing back
their heads whilst on the perch--often to such an extent as to overbalance
themselves and fall fluttering to the ground. I do not remember to have seen
this recorded as characteristic of this species, but from a note which appears in
the excellent little work on Bird-keeping by C. E. Dyson, published in 1878, it
appears that the habit was observed in the early days of its importation. The
author writes--&apos; 1 It (the Hill Tit) has only been known in England a very little
while. Some birds brought from China died in their voyage before they reached
the Cape, from being fed improperly, entirely on seed, with the exception of a
few flies caught in the cabin each day. They were known onboard as Tumblers,
from a curious habit of falling backwards from their perch and alighting on their
legs, but I have not heard of this as common to others of the species, so it may
have been due to giddiness or weakness from want of nourishing food."
The cause here suggested certainly does not apply to my birds, which are
in perfect health and condition. A. A. GOODALL.

Eleven semi-wild Mute Swans come to and leave the lake regularly, some-
times passing the whole day there, and then all rising on the wing together towards
sunset, wending their way ' en masse ' up the Kennet Valley to pastures new.
They travel at a great rate when flying, certainly faster than a train.

Mr. W. FROST is on his way home with a fine collection of Indian birds,
a good number of which are new to aviculture, including the beautiful Blue
Nuthatch (Sitta frontalis), the tiny Chestnut-crowned Tesia ( T. castaneocoronata );
the Spotted Forktail: two or three species of Wagtails, and also of Chats ; little
Blue and White and other Flycatchers; Golden Bush Robins, besides many
others, We hope he will be able to land them safely and in good health.
THE GREAT NILTAVA.
Mr. A. EZRA secured the male of the pair of Niltava grandis, brought
home by Major Perreau, a Niltava the male of which is a fine deep blue and
black, whilst the female is pale brown with a small streak of blue on each side of
the neck. It was certainly a pity that a compulsory separation was granted,
especially as birds in pairs are so often more attractive than single ones, the male
and female, when differing greatly in colouring, as in the Niltavas, acting as a
foil the one to the other in their individual beauty. The great Niltava is a good
deal larger than the other species. We understand that Major Perreau has
presented the female to the Zoological Society.

WHITE - NECKED CRANES.
Anthropoides leucauchen.

Author of "A Monograph of the Cranes.&amp;quot;

<bodyText confidence="0.985701545454545" page_id="32655109"  page_num="Page 221" year="" vol="">
The Crane family is a family of very ornamental birds, being
also hardy and easily kept in confinement. They have one draw-
back, however, and that is that they are very destructive to green
turf and gardens in general, for they are constantly looking for
worms, and if the soil is at all soft the grass is soon nowhere ! A
marsh is perhaps the best place to keep them in, but not every-
body has a marsh at his disposal.
The White-necked Crane--of which a group is shown in the
illustration--is one of the most striking looking, if perhaps not the
most beautiful of all the Cranes. This bird was formerly very
difficult to get and very expensive, and the pair which I have kept
for many years originally cost me as much as a hundred pounds ! !
During the last four or five years they have been imported in
numbers, and the price has gone down accordingly. I think that it
is always a pity when lovely birds are imported in large numbers, as
a good many people lose their interest in them, although they are
just as beautiful as when they were rare.
The White-necked Crane is easy to breed : in fact, it is the
only Crane which can be bred everywhere and anywhere, forming
in this respect a great contrast to the white Indian Crane a near
relative, which, as far as I know has never been successfully bred in
confinement, clear eggs being so far the only thing obtained. You

White-neckecl Cranes.
may move your breeding pair of White Necks as much as you like,
they will breed in the park, they will breed in the small enclosed
garden, and they will breed in a small aviary. Although they are
so very accommodating in this respect they never get on intimate
terms with their owner ; at least my pair does not, and I never saw
one which did.
The White Indians, and even more so the Mantchurians, will
be glad to see you, and will dance and play around you when you
come near them. The White-necks remain indifferent, and I believe
that they prefer not to see you !
Very little nest is made, and one or tw T o dry bits of grass are
all they want. Here, again, they form a great contrast to the white
Indians who make an elaborate nest of sticks near the edge of the
pond ; fetching the material from the bottom of the water, and
passing it over from one to the other.
The eggs of the White-necked Crane are almost always fertile,
and the young ones grow very fast, attended to by both parents.
The first plumage is brown, but a curious thing about this is that
almost as soon as the bird is completely feathered, the hind neck,
which was brown at first, turns a dull white in the course of a
couple of weeks. This great thing achieved, the moult or colour
change, stops for a while, and there seems to be no hurry about
changing the rest of the feathers.
The White-necked Cranes have rather a sharp penetrating
cry, which to my ear is not nearly so melodious as the cry of the
White Indian or the Mantchurian. They have a peculiar way of
walking, keeping themselves very erect. When they have small
young ones, and you come upon the family by surprise, one of the
parents feigns lameness and tumbles about in front of the intruder
as if seriously ill or wounded. If you follow him he will lead you
aivay for a good distance, then, when he thinks you are far enough
away from the young ones, he will suddenly rise on his legs, dance a
few paces as if in derision, and run away!

I happen to have an American Robin (Turdus migratorius)
and a Dhyal Bird (Copsychns saularis) and a very delightful couple
they are; so utterly different in nature, the best of friends when
each is in his home cage, singing to one another in melodious
strains, but enemies if one is loose, and flies up to the other's cage.
They scream with rage, and there seems to be a good deal of jealousy
mixed with it, chiefly on the part of the one that is not loose. So
attached are they to their cages that it is safe to let each out in the
garden for a flight.
The Dhyal Bird, " Dick," loves to cling to the creepers on the
house and look for insects, but at the sight of the mealworm tub he
flies to it with a loud scream. There is a very large Rookery in
some old beeches overlooking the garden, and Dick imitates, or tries
to, the cawing of the Rooks, but it is a shrill scream with him. He
sings, too, very sweetly, in company with "Rob," who is a beautiful
songster. He once flew far away into a hay field, but was easily
caught. The Ringdoves were the cause of this, for he has a great
dislike to Doves, and while loose in the verandah, hopping about
quietly, a Ringdove chanced to fly in, whereupon Rob rushed at it,
and chased it out of the garden away to some fields. The Dhyal
bird is the cleverest of all the birds I have ever kept--sharp as a
needle and very fond of a game of play, especially with a coloured
stone or bit of stuff. He is in perfect health, and has been out in
the garden in a lawn aviary every day and all day long this winter,
with the exception of two days, one of fog and the other a biting
east wind. He was very glad to get out again, and at once took a
' grass bath,' sitting in the grass and fluttering his wings as if he
were bathing. He bathes in quite cold water, even after a frost.
Of the two, I should say Rob is the least hardy, but he splashes
into his cold bath every day, again and again, like a Thrush.
The birds in their lawn cages are visited by numbers of their

allowed to be persecuted in our garden, on the contrary, all are
encouraged, the result being that the fruit-trees and vegetables are
always clear of insects and vermin, with good crops of all. Yellow
crocuses, being a favourite toy of the House-Sparrow, are guarded by
red worsted, stretched round and across them. Not a single flower
is touched.
I may mention that my Ruddy Turtle Doves and Afras have
been out in an unheated aviary all the winter, and are out now,
merely sheltered from the north and east.

By Arthur G. Butler, Ph.D.
In a recent review which I wrote of one of the pamphlets
issued by the Animals' Friend Society, I stated that well-meaning
persons who wrote pamphlets of this character were hindering the
advancement of Science. In an article entitled "For Love of Birds,"
our Member Mrs. Currey observes that I accuse the pamphlet in
question of hindering the advancement of Science by calling
attention to many acts of cruelty to " animals and birds " * that go
on unchecked." It would be impolite for me to contradict a lady,
but in justice to myself it is only fair to ask others to look at that
review and decide for themselves in the first place whether I accuse
the pamphlet or the person who wrote it, and in the second place
whether I did not agree with it in my condemnation of all acts of
cruelty : in fine whether I did not go beyond it in my personal
feeling against what is called sport.
There is not the slightest doubt that the Societies which
have sprung up of late years, with the avowed object of advocating
humanitarianism, while undoubtedly doing a little good, have
(owing to their refusal to look at both sides of the question) done an
incalculable amount of mischief.
Years ago, before birds-nesting was made illegal, I was
spending a holiday at the seaside with the object of adding to my

collection of butterflies and moths : fortunately for aviculture these
insects were unusually scarce, and so I turned my attention to
collecting eggs. When I got home I naturally wished to name
my specimens, and therefore procured Hewitson's British Birds-eggs,
but found his plates almost entirely useless for the purpose, because
he only gave one or perhaps two illustrations of each kind of egg.
This fact determined me to produce a work which would give some
idea of the variations existing in the commoner eggs, and to this
end I not only collected long series of eggs, but also of nests of as
many species as possible. The result was first 11 A Handbook of
British Oology " illustrated by myself, and later " Bird's Eggs of
the British Isles" illustrated by Erohawk.
Now, whatever opinion may be held by scientists respecting
the value of the above two books as a help to the study of Oology ;
the fact cannot be disputed that they have conclusively proved
the enormous variability to which eggs are subject, and therefore
have added to the sum of human knowledge ; yet had the penalties
for taking birds' eggs existed when I was still young, neither of
those books would ever have seen the light.
But, supposing that books produced by me were entirely
valueless, it by no means follows that other young men who made
collections would also fail to do good work, as a result of their
studies in bird-life ; yet now, if they would seek out Nature's secrets,
the poseur of humanitarianism brands them as criminals ! and,
having persuaded the law of the land to back him up, prosecutes
these lovers of Nature without mercy.
Collecting birds' eggs led me naturally on to rearing young
birds from the nest, and thus bred within me an affection for my
younger feathered brothers, which has certainly not been injurious
to my avicultural friends and has been admitted to be not entirely
useless to Science. Now all this seems egotistical at first sight, but
it must be born in mind that if an ordinary lover of Science, after
taking up the study of any branch of animal life, can produce work
of any value whatever; a law which would throw obstacles in the
way of a budding Darwin or Huxley would be wicked in the extreme.
No end of silly and grossly ignorant twaddle has been
written respecting the cruelty of taking birds' eggs ; but, as a matter

Dr. A. G. Butler,
of fact it affects the birds very little indeed. If a House-Martin's
nest containing eggs be knocked down (a frequent event in country-
places where good housewives sometimes object strongly to this
form of mural decoration) you may see the old birds busy within
the hour building again, and so it is with many other birds. Unless
it is the last nest of the season which is taken, it makes no
difference to the number of young reared. Many of our wild birds,
if materials are handy, can build a nest in a day (as I have proved
on several occasions) and few of the smaller birds, unless cold or
heavy rains intervene, take more than three days ; of course the
Long-tailed Tit is a notable exception, but his nest is a marvel of
beauty when completed, and not built in the slap-dash mechanical
fashion adopted by a Finch or a Thrush.
To take nest after nest of eggs produced by the same bird is ?
of course, abominably cruel; but even that cruelty, practised in
1872 upon the Wryneck by a collector who took no less than forty-
two eggs from one nest, proved at least that the removal of a single
sitting could have no injurious effect upon such fertile creatures as
birds ; if it did, how could poultry-farmers be excused for robbing
their fowls continuously ? but, of course, that detail would not
occur to the wild bird protection faddist, besides to call in question
the morality of robbing the poor domestic hen would interfere with
the agitator's own comfort. Depend upon it, the laws of Moses
were quite stringent enough, but even they permitted birds-nesting.
I never encouraged cottagers' children to take eggs, because
they either collected them in order to indulge in the foolish game of
hop-egg, in which the child who smashed the greatest number as he
hopped across them was proclaimed the victor ; or they threaded
them on strings to hang up as ornaments ; but the amount of actual
harm done by even these thoughtless collectors was infinitesimal,
inasmuch as they rarely found any but the commonest and most
easily discovered nests, such as those of the Blackbird and Thrush
Then again I never took nests needlessly ; and at the present
time nothing gives me more pleasure than to discover nests in my
own garden, to watch the growth of the young birds, to guard them
(so far as it is possible) from the murderous attacks of feline vermin,
and hail with delight their flight from the parental home; even

though I know that presently they will reward me by rooting up
plants, scattering manure over my paths, and later on digging holes
in my apples and eating my cherries.
Well, so much for birds-nesting, which has been made a
punishable offence through the efforts of the Wild Bird Protectionists:
next we come to the hand-rearing of our native birds which has
also been denounced as cruel. Our present Editor, Mr. Astley, has
ably written on the delightful companionship afforded by a hand-
reared Wheatear, and my household, as well as many friends,
experienced the greatest pleasure some years ago in watching,
talking to, and playing games with a hand-reared Pied Wagtail.
Nobody, unless he had spent an hour or two in the company of that
bird, would have credited for a moment the extraordinary intelligence
which it displayed, the zest with which it entered into a game of
touch or hide and seek. The bird was infinitely happier and lived a
much fuller life than it could have done in freedom ; moreover I
rescued it from what would have been almost certain death, a
marauding cat having already devoured its brothers and sisters when
I came upon it shivering against a fence after it had sprung from the
nest. The present law would prosecute anybody who, through pity,
adopted one of these poor victims to the modern tendency to keep
four-footed pests, and made it a child of the home; thus it gives the
cat a right to rend and maim a creature infinitely more beautiful,
more intelligent and more lovable than itself, and excuses the
brutality of its action on the ground of its being a cat's nature to
delight in destroying life; so the man who would make a friend of
the helpless creature and render its life a continuous joy, is deemed
worthy of punishment.
Does the so-called Bird-protectionist really believe that in
interfering with man's undoubted right to claim dominion over the
fowls of the air, he is doing the birds themselves any good at all; or
is his action dictated solely by a love for notoriety, for a malicious
pleasure in meddling with concerns respecting which he is not only
profoundly ignorant, but concerning which he does not desire even
to know the actual truth ? I am afraid, from the constant repeti-
tion in his pamphlets of statements which have long been proved
unsound, that there can be only one answer to this.

Dr. A. G. Butler,
Now, as regards bird-catchers, who have been driven from
pillar to post, persecuted and prosecuted for many years past,
because in the winter w T hen their usual work was slack, they were
able to go out with their nets and pick up a precarious living and so
keep their wives and children from starving; they have been as
a body accused of wanton cruelty and many another crime; but I
have found most of them industrious, sober and most intelligent,
even though uneducated men ; they taught me several interesting
facts about birds respecting which previously I had no knowledge.
Of course, there were occasional exceptions, as in all other businesses,
but it is unfair to condemn the whole class for the sins of the
occasional rascal.
And what did the late talented observer, Herr. Gatke,
remark as to man's asserted reduction of the numbers of birds ?--
" To a witness--of the enormous passage of migrants, of the myriads
of individuals which, on autumn nights, travel past this island, like
the flakes of a snow-storm, not only within the area of the light-
house, but for miles north and south out to sea, these complaints
seem quite incomprehensible. It is surely impossible that the hand
of man can exercise any perceptible influence on such enormous
migration streams."
A lot of absolute nonsense has been written about the
decrease of Goldfinches and other birds in England, and the blame
has been put upon the bird-catchers ; as if they alone were respon-
sible and the comparatively few birds captured in their nets made
any appreciable difference to the many millions of these birds born
each year in Europe. Of course where there is a decrease in
numbers it is due entirely to the cutting down of timber and
reclaiming of waste land formerly covered with thistle and teazle,
upon which these birds delight to feed. When on migration in the
spring it is not to be expected that Goldfinches or any other birds
should settle down in a locality where they can neither find suitable
nesting-places nor food which appeals to them.
The actual effect of the pretended humanitarianism agitated
for by English protectionists has been to hamper the honest poor in
providing their children with the necessaries of life, while at the
same time dooming a greater number of lovely song - birds to

slaughter by the French and Italian peasantry, who capture them
in countless numbers during migration and eat them, even the tiny
Goldcrest not being allowed to escape.
To what does all this misplaced zeal tend ? We know that
the desire and aim of these reformers is to put an entire stop to
bird-keeping throughout the world. The mischief they have already
done is enormous : already most of the native birds of the United
States and Australia are so strictly protected that students of bird-
life in this country are only able to obtain them at an exorbitant
price. That the birds of New Zealand are protected is perhaps just
as well, inasmuch as some of them, ow T ing chiefly to the efforts of
the natives, had become extinct or w T ere becoming extremely scarce,
but to prevent a few thousand Australian, North American or
European birds being captured each year, and so hinder earnest
Nature-students from working out their life history and recording
many facts previously unknown to science, seems not only injurious
but futile. The capture of one in perhaps ten thousand individuals
ranging over enormous tracts of country, can make no appreciable
difference to the preservation of the species ; whereas it may make a
considerable difference to ornithological knowledge.
The well-known fact that one or two species have in the past
been so persecuted by farmers and others, either on account of the
depredations which they have committed upon crops, or because
they made excellent food, that they have been well-nigh exterminated,
does not justify the hindrance of scientific research by the wholesale
protection of every non-injurious native bird. In expressing these
opinions I can claim to be personally quite disinterested, inasmuch
as at my age it is highly improbable that I shall have an opportunity
to do much more for science.
And now the question arises as to whether the birds them-
selves will benefit by wholesale stringent protection : in this country,
at any rate, the indiscriminate destruction of birds of prey and of
such vermin as stoats and wild cats, which formerly broke up bird
families to a considerable extent, added to total immunity from
man's action, must necessarily result in constant inbreeding between
brothers and sisters, thus weakening the stock and producing a
tendency towards final extinction of species. Already we see one

Dr. A. G. Butler,
result of this increasing weakness, in the frequent occurrence of
albinism in our wild birds : where formerly a white or pied bird was
regarded as a rarity, at the present time not a year passes in which
one does not see several in one's own garden, while the records of
such aberrations appearing in papers devoted to birds are increasingly
frequent.
No good was ever done by man interfering, in attempts to
assist Nature ; he only succeeds in disturbing the balance of things:
if he would retain in the country the native birds which have been a
delight to all lovers of sweet sounds and chaste colours, let him do
his utmost to preserve for their use as many bird-sanctuaries as
possible and, if he will, put up numerous nesting-boxes for the use
of his feathered friends ; but, excepting in the case of rare and
occasional visitors to our shores, which ought to be allowed the
opportunity of rearing families amongst us, I believe firmly that,
in addition to the injury done by discouraging the study of Natural
History in the young, laws for the absolute preservation of all native
birds and for the prevention of their capture for observation in
aviaries, will not prove of any benefit to the birds themselves ; but
very much the reverse.
With regard to the feather trade, of course it needs super-
vision in order to prevent the wholesale destruction of beautiful
species; but it has been proved in some cases that the accounts
published with a view to working upon the feelings of the soft-
hearted have been greatly exaggerated. I cannot say that I like to
see feathers and bird-skins in ladies' head-coverings ; it is a survival
of savagery, but if they must have them, domesticated birds assisted
by the dyer will always suffice to produce effects which should
rejoice the heart of even a queen of the cannibal islands. On the
other hand it must be borne in mind, as pointed out by Dr. A.
Menegaux in his admirable treatise entitled " Bird Protection and
the Feather Trade " that " We must take our latter-day surround-
ings into consideration and remember that we may not interfere
unduly with the means of livelihood now guaranteed for thousands
by the use of natural products. In Paris alone are more than 600

factories and workshops for the treatment of feathers. The turnover
is more than six million pounds sterling a year, and more than
50,000 men and women derive a living from the manufacture and
industries associated with it.
Then, again, as touching the destruction of Egrets, about
which more capital has been made by the protectionist party than
anything else, we read (p. 9) :--"It is not necessary to slaughter
Egrets to obtain their ornamental feathers. Indeed, Mr. Geay, who
lived and travelled for many years in Venezuela, Darien and French
Guinea, has noticed that in moulting time you find these elegant
feathers scattered here and there in large quantities on the bushes
and at the foot of the trees near the " lagunos " and small rivers.
Natives pick up these feathers, which would else be lost, by the kilo,
and sell them to the trade without any damage to either species of
heron. When collected in proper time, these feathers are almost as
fine as those of a shot bird. Soiled feathers easily regain their
beautiful snowy white by the peroxide water treatment. In no case
are they taken from the living bird."
This statement is confirmed by Mr. Leon Lag&apos;laize who
travelled for two years in the valleys of Orinoco and Apure. But I
need not make further quotations from this essay since its cost is
only 6d. and anybody interested in the subject can readily secure
a copy and study it for himself.
Finally, no real lover of birds objects to a certain amount of
reasonable protection, but in the present day, restrictions upon the
liberty of the subject are becoming every year more unbearable, the
masses are being tormented for the self-glorification of a few mistaken
sentimentalists and the means of earning an honest livelihood are
being continually decreased. If, to the discouraging of the laudable
instincts of budding naturalists, to the enfeebling of the children of
would-be bird-catchers (by depriving them of food at a time when it
is most needed), be added the total abolition of the trade in living
birds, the misery resulting to many thousands will be simply appal-
ling. Surely to anybody with a spark of real humanity it would be
infinitely better that a thousand birds should spend their lives in
aviaries than that one human being should perish from hunger or
be reduced to want.

Major Horsbrugh's Indian Collection.
As for birds being unhappy in partial captivity, that we know
to be the veriest nonsense: indeed there are scores of recorded in-
stances in which, when liberated, they have voluntarily returned to
their former owners : this is not surprising when one considers that
a wild bird is subject to frequent alarms from predaceous birds and
beasts, that it often has much difficulty in obtaining sufficient food
to satisfy it, and that in the winter in this country it is exposed to
all the bitter and trying vicissitudes of our most uncertain climate.

COLLECTION.
In the first week of May, Mr. Frost brought back to England
a wonderful collection of birds, which were principally inhabitants
of the Himalayas.
Major Horsbrugh himself travelled to Genoa to meet the ship
which had borne so many treasures from India, and I, joining him
at Milan, not only acted as interpreter with regard to various
arrangements with the Italian railway officials, but also had the
privilege of seeing the collection of 400 birds on board the steamer
after she had come alongside the quay in the far-famed Genoese
port. Having some few hours in Milan, w T e took the opportunity of
visiting the Turati collection of stuffed birds, which Professor
Giacinto Martorelli, the Director, showed us with all the courtesy
and kindness that a kind and courteous Italian can show. It is
an extremely fine collection, one of the best in the world, and w T e
only had time to merely glance at portions of it, especially taking
notice of stuffed skins of some of those birds which we hoped to
see alive two days afterwards.
On the following day, after our arrival at Genoa, there was
much conversation with the master of the principal station, and
also with a custom house official. All went well, which is a matter
of congratulation in Italy, where officials are concerned, and arrange-
ments were duly arrived at whereby Major Horsbrugh could take a
certain number of the more delicate birds by rail from Genoa to
Paris, and so on to England.

Thus Friday, the 25th of April went by, and we went to our
beds, hoping and praying that the ship would not delay on the
following day. But on the Saturday we were told that she would
not be in before five o'clock, which one felt meant later! Not being
Italians, that much-used expression of "Fa miente " or "non
importa " could not spring to our lips, for we considered it most
important that the steamer should arrive by daylight.
Can anything be more irksome than w T aiting and waiting in a
strange city. It was a case of " Sister Anne, Sister Anne " through-
out the afternoon, and Sister Anne was the agency of the Dutch
steamers. Moreover, the weather was anything but nice, and the
skies anything but Italian. Grey, windy, and raining. At last came
the message "The steamer is sighted," and when we reached the
dock at 5.45 she was just coming in.
How many birds would there be ? How many had suc-
cumbed? were the questions we asked each other. And then the
ship was towed alongside of the quay, when we saw Mr. Frost
amongst the crowd of passengers above our heads.
" How many ? " shouted Major Horsbrugh, and above the
din of much Italian chatter amongst porters, etc. on the quay, we
heard him answer " Four hundred." " Any Bed-headed Titmice? "
I shouted, and two fingers were held up for a response.
Then came an aggravating wait, whilst a doctor went on
board to give a bill of health or otherwise, the yellow flag fluttering
in the chilly wind until he finished his work, which we certainly
came to the conclusion would have been accomplished much more
quickly in England : and the dusk creeping on too ! Our remarks
upon Italian dawdling and dilatoriness were not exactly complimen-
tary. It certainly was a case of "pazienza," as one is always told.
At last the yellow flag was lowered, and a confused rush
began up the gangway, everybody shouting and struggling, some
coming off the ship, and garrulous inconsequent Italian porters
bundling on board her. And oh that dreadful dusk growing deeper
every moment and the steamer in the port for not more than three
hours ! Having greeted Mr. Frost, we quickly made our way to the
birds which were on the upper deck under canvas, one end of the
improvised tent being open. There was no electric light there, no

light of any kind, except an occasional match which we struck, and
the birds at the end of the shelter were nearly invisible.
The first thing I saw were three large cages full of Sunbirds ;
in one, no less than forty of the beautiful little Yellow-backed Sun-
birds (&apos; CEthyopyga seherice) with its breast of blood red, and mous-
taches of glistening sapphire blue.
A quantity of Amethyst-rumped Sunbirds (A. zeylonica ) and
also of Yellow-backed Black Sunbirds, A. saturata, as far as one
could see, looking uncommonly fit, especially considering the evening
was very chilly and the ship had passed through stormy seas.
Another species--a solitary individual--which caught my eye,
and which, amongst others, I carried off, was a splendid Green-
breasted Pitta (P. cucullata). I think I remember seeing a specimen
at the Crystal Palace Show some years ago, but it is a good while
since this bird has been seen in England, and the one which arrived
in Major Horsbrugh's collection is probably the only one in Europe.
The Scarlet and Black Minivets were a sight ; three species,
and one regrets that the gorgeous glow of red would fade to a dull
yellow when they moult in captivity.
The large Minivets (P. speciosus ) were especially magnificent.
Major Horsbrugh took these away by land.
The list of species brought by Mr. Frost is as follows :

One wonders when such rare species will be seen again,
especially as I hear the Germans are now keenly exploiting India
and her mountains for birds.
Major Horsbrugh is to be congratulated upon having intro-
duced to English aviculturists many species which have been im-
ported for the first time into Europe, and Mr. Frost must likewise
be congratulated upon his success in collecting them, and his untiring
zeal in keeping them alive under very difficult and adverse circum-
stances. Had he only brought the Sunbirds, he might have rested
content, and perhaps for beauty and fascination these were the
gems. When those crimson-breasted ones moult out, they will
indeed be jewels ; rubies, topaz and flecks of sapphire. One knows
what it is to tend twenty or thirty birds in cages, when they are in
good health and safely at home ; but to look after four hundred at
sea, many suffering from cramped quarters, cold winds and turbulent
waters, is a task that most would shrink from and many refuse.
We hope to hear later on in more detail of some of these
rare birds, as members of the Society have opportunities of writing
about them.

By Martin Cuningham.
On receiving the Editor's letter, asking&apos; for some contributions
to the pages of the Avicultural Magazine, I thought the following
very rough notes on the Capercaillie, in his home in the vast pine
forests of Siberia, might prove of some small interest.
An adult cock Capercaillie in the spring is, in my humble
estimation, one of the finest sights of the bird-world; my first
acquaintance with him was at this time of the year. I had taken a
peasant with me who knew the haunts of these birds, and we started
in the evening so as to get to the forest in the dark. Driving through
the pine forest we several times startled some of these birds, who
went creaking through the pine tops. The least noise, though quite
dark and long after roosting-time, starts these birds flying at once.
In the morning, an hour or two before sunrise, they begin to
call, and it is then one has to do the stalking to get near them, as
whilst calling they hear nothing, from which comes their Russian
name of " Gluchar " (the deaf one). When he stops you have to
do the same, as he hears the least noise when not calling, and this
sudden stopping generally means being caught with one foot in the
air or else in some similar and very uncomfortable attitude. When
you do see him, it is well worth all the trouble, with his neck frill
and tail standing out stiff against the brightening light. The call is
very piercing and can be heard a long way off ; it is a challenge I
think, as I have never been able to find a hen anywhere near. When
he is on the ground then you can be certain that there are hens
about. He then does his dancing, with tail, neck, and wings spread
out to their utmost limits. Taking several steps forward, he jumps
into the air, and coming dowm again makes a loud, booming noise,
not unlike a drum heard at a distance.
Only once have I ever seen two males fighting, and this gave
me the first opportunity of having one of these birds alive. They
were hard at it when I first saw them and, though naturally the
shyest of birds, took not the least notice of me. I caught one in
my hands, and it was several minutes before the other realized that
there was a stranger near and solemnly stalked off. My capture

proved the most troublesome of any I have ever had since, as he
refused to touch anything for the first two days ; but, afterwards,
whether owing&apos; to a domestic hen getting in where he was, or finding
himself very hungry, he started to feed all right. He proved, how-
ever, so wild, that on my getting some young birds, which at once
adapted themselves to their surroundings, I turned him loose in his
beloved pine forest again.
The forest keepers have several times brought the young birds
in to me before they could fly, and then I never had any trouble
with them. Their food at first was hemp and Canary seed, and
when they got bigger, wheat, barley and oats, also any wild berries
or green food, and occasionally the ordinary water melon. They
became quite tame in a very short time, and used to wander about
among the domestic hens. We found, however, that we could not
keep more than one cock, though even if only a few months old,
owing to their continual fighting. They showed no signs of wishing
to fly away, though unpinioned, and seemed quite happy.
In spite of everything I could do, I have never been able to
bring any of my birds through a winter. The cold is intense, any-
thing from 20-40* below zero, and when turning them out they got
their feet frost bitten and then rapidly collapsed, but exercise of some
sort they must have. In their wild state, in the winter, I have
never seen one of these birds on the ground.
The nest is always very cunningly hidden, as the hen covers
her eggs, and unless you happen to nearly walk on it, it is very difficult
to find as she sits very close. It is generally at the foot of some
tree, a slight hollow being scraped out. I have also found it several
times at the foot of an ant heap, the bottom of the latter being
scraped out, making a sort of tunnel for the bird to sit under.
Owing to these grand birds living only in the big pine forests,
which nearly all belong to the Government and with regular keepers
who prevent indiscriminate shooting, they stand a chance of surviving
a long time. Without this protection and with their slow flight
and big size, they would very soon have become exterminated as the
Siberian peasant has not the least idea of giving any bird a chance.

Mr. Hubert D. Astley,
THE LESSER EGRET.
Ardea garzetta.
By Hubert D. Astley, F.Z.S., M.B.O.U., etc.
The beautiful little Egret is being cruelly and disastrously
reduced in numbers, owing to the plume trade. In Europe it inhabits
only the southern countries, but ranges far south in Africa, and right
across the continent of Asia, and from thence down to the Malay
Archipelago and Australia. It has occurred as a rare straggler in
Great Britain, North Germany, and Holland, etc.
It is essentially a marsh bird, preferring swampy ground
where there is plenty of aquatic vegetation, and its nesting places
are often situated in the midst of vast swamps.
In " Wild Life," Yol. I., No. 1 (an extremely attractive
monthly illustrated magazine, and from which I took hints for the
accompanying drawing of the Egrets) there is a most interesting
account written by Mr. W. Farren of his experiences amongst a
nesting colony of these birds in Southern Spain.
I cannot do better than quote some of his description :--" In
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.898819105263158">
" the nesting season they congregate in large colonies. The sites for
" such colonies, which are occupied year after year, are generally in
" well-wooded marshland, or shallow lagoons fringed with bushes and
" small trees. On these bushes and trees the nests are massed
" thickly together, and, when the eggs have been laid, and the young
"ones hatched, the parental instinct becomes dominant, and the
" birds lose much of their shyness." .... "The ' Heronies ' of the
" Little Egret afford, under normal conditions, one of the most
"exquisite spectacles of bird-life conceivable. The graceful outlines
" of the parent birds, now flashing white against the cloudless blue,
" now settling on the olive-tinted branches, now mirrored from the
" water as they fish--colour and movement, life and sound are here."
" Then come the hunters--and silence ! "
" But for one cry--the cheeping of the slowly starving nest-
" lings. Round them lie mutilated bodies, some--so it has been said
" by eye-witnesses--still throbbing with faint life. For it is only a
" small patch of skin tohich is marketable."
" Fifty or sixty years ago Florida could boast of a number of
" nesting colonies, each consisting of thousands of Egrets. Season

Spain " and " Unexplored Spain " have leased the Coto Donana for
some years, which is a long narrow strip of country which stretches
along the coast line for about forty miles from the north bank of the
Guadalquivir. Here the marismas teem with wild-fowl in the winter,
and with marsh birds in the spring. The low marshy part of the
country merges into interminable marismas, stretching for miles on
either side of the river.
Here where tamarisks fringe some of the lagoons, the Little
Egrets, associating with Buff-backed Herons, etc. build their nests,
in some cases only a few feet above the water's surface.
Mr. Farren graphically describes his efforts at photographing
some of the birds. Concealed in a small tent, which the Egrets did
not seem to be frightened at, he watched them at close proximity for
a length of time. He writes :--" Egrets and Buff-backed Herons
" flew low down over the tent, circled above the bushes, and one by
" one dropped with dangling legs on the branches. Their long toes
"seemed ill-fitted for grasping, and there was, it must be confessed,
" some ungainliness of action in their progress towards their nests.
" As they climbed down from branch to branch and raised their
" wings as balancers, their waving plumes and snow white primaries
" caught, at each step, fresh glint and play of sunshine."
" There was much bickering and squabbling amongst them,
caused as it seemed by unintentional, unavoidable trespass."
In the Natural History Museum in New York, there is a
most beautiful case of stuffed Egrets, representing the birds amidst
their natural surroundings with their nests and young : and so skil-
fully is it done that it is difficult to forget one is not looking upon
real life. These magnificent examples of the taxidermist's art, and
there are many, each one if possible more interesting than the last,

are lighted from above, after the manner of the big tanks in the
Brighton Aquarium. Real material--bushes, grass, stones, etc.--
are used, and are brought from the very spots in which the original
scenes took place, whilst the backgrounds, painted by well-known
artists, are so cunningly devised that it is often difficult to discern
where the painting of grass, etc. begins and the genuine articles
leave off. With the Egrets, in the foreground are portions of trees
covered with long strands of lichen, amongst which the birds are
perching near their nests, some of which contain eggs, some young
ones, whilst you look down apparently into the depths of a weedy
and slimy lagoon, lying in the heart of a tangle of forest growth,
and in the distance innumerable Egrets are flying over the bushes
and the water. The birds in the foreground are stuffed, those in the
further distance are painted. The whole effect is intensely interest-
ing and the work intensely skilful.
The Society for the Protection of Birds has for some years
striven to trumpet from the house-tops the iniquities of the plume
trade, but many women seem absolutely impervious and even callous
to its reports and entreaties. Men too are to blame, for long ago a bill
should have been passed by the English Government to absolutely
forbid the importation of birds' plumes and skins for millinery pur-
poses. Neither do some of those ladies who are highest in society
set the example they should. Feathers of Birds of Paradise, Crowned
Pigeons, Humming Birds, Egrets, etc. are still to be seen in women's
hats, and there are many who do not care what the history of the
slaughter is, so long as they can wear what they think to be smart
and becoming to them. In these days of spiteful destruction at the
hands of suffragettes, it is a pity that a band of these women, who
can so easily make themselves notorious, do not concentrate some
of their energies upon striving to put down a cruelty for which their
sex is primarily responsible.
There was one woman not long ago who paid #200 for a hat--
and the fact was thoroughly and blatantly advertised--because that
head-gear was smothered in ' aigrettes,' the plumes of forty or fifty
of the Little Egrets, which probably meant, in addition to their
destruction, the deaths of about one hundred young birds left
starving in their nests under a blazing southern sun !

In fifty years' time, at this rate, the Little Egrets will be
exterminated from off the face of the earth.
In some of the States of North America, plumes of these
and other birds are confiscated, whilst we in England, with all our
boasting as to kindness to animals, permit our women, encouraged
by the hat shops, to wear on their heads feathers which represent a
mine of cruelty.
When crossing from New York on board the ' Lusitania '
some five years ago, I became so indignant by seeing a woman day
after day parading the decks and lounging in the saloons with a
whole skin and part of another of a Greater Paradise Bird in her
hat, that I finally spoke to her, asking her to pardon my effrontery
and explaining to her the fact that these birds, amongst others,
were being killed in hundreds and hundreds, and were becoming
more and more rare every day : " Would she give up encouraging
such destruction, and help to persuade others ? " I told her of how
more than one man had been murdered in the swamps of Florida,
when they were acting as guardians to the Egrets.
My remarks were received with a supercilious shrug and an
insolent smile. " Really " was her answer "I don't see what all
this has to do with me, and I don't see why I shouldn't wear what I
choose. So callous was her spirit, so unmelting her heart, that I
replied: " Well! Madam, I have always understood that women are
the gentler sex, and supposed to possess more tender feelings than
men ; a man is now striving, and has done so courteously, to move
your heart ; I see that it is useless, and I withdraw my apology for
having taken upon myself to address you as a stranger."
If she could have served me, to judge by her expression, as
the Birds of Paradise in her hat had been served she would have ! !
even perhaps to wearing my scalp !
On the other hand, others to whom I have appealed have
answered courteously, with an explanation that they really did not
realize what was entailed by the wearing of ' aigrettes,' etc. Why
should this abominable cruelty and destruction continue when hats
can be quite as becoming, and even more so, in these days of
delicately manufactured artificial flowers, etc. It is said that the

Mr. F. E. Blaauw,
London market supplies Paris, etc. with plumes; then let the London
market be closed.
All this is not mere sentiment--so called--it is a deep and
humane feeling that the Egrets and other birds have a right to live,
and move, and have their being. I hear someone say, "Well you
imprison birds, what about that?" What about it? Why this !
that to keep as pets a few examples of different species, which
evince their happiness by reproducing their kind, and rearing their
families is a very different thing to assisting in the slaughter of
thousands and thousands, aiding to bring on the extinction of species!
As a matter of fact the Little Egrets are to be obtained alive
but infrequently, but when they can be, they will live happily for
some years, especially if they are kept in a fairly large enclosure,
where there is shallow water, and reeds and bushes. They are birds
of sunny climes and should have shelter in the colder months. Fish,
cut small, and meat is what they feed on, and they become quite
fearless.
I have a pair of Little Egrets, [the male is somewhat larger
than the female,] which will run forward to take the pieces of roach,
etc. when thrown to them.
In conclusion, cannot lovers of birds, whilst doing all they
can to make their living pets happy; and these can be absolutely so ;
try to do something definite towards abating and putting a stop to
such ruthless destruction.
THE RUDDY-HEADED GOOSE.
Chloephaga rubicliceps.
By F. E. Blaauw, C.M.Z.S.
This Goose -- a native of the southern parts of South America
and the Falkland Islands -- is the smallest of the genus Chloephaga &amp;gt;
and, like all the members of its family is an extremely pretty bird.
It was first imported alive to England, I believe, about 1860, and
bred in the Zoological Gardens between 1865 and 1870, after which
time until quite recently it has only been represented there by odd
specimens which have not bred.

On the continent, the species was first imported in 1886,
represented by a single male at the Zoological Gardens of Antwerp,
where I had the good fortune to be able to acquire it through the
courtesy of the director, Mr. J. Vekemans. A couple of months
later, Dr. Sclater kindly let me have a female which then lived in
the Zoological Gardens of London, and from these two birds I have
been able to breed a numerous progeny which, with the occasional
addition of an imported bird, are almost without exception respon-
sible for all the Ruddy-headed Geese that have been kept in captivity
since 1887.
In its native land this bird is a migrating species. In Tierra
del Fuego, which I visited in 1911, I saw flocks of this species ready
to leave on the 11th of April, and I was told by the settlers there
that the bird is a summer visitor to the island.
In the country behind Punta ikrenas this bird is also a
summer visitor, breeding in the rough land to the west of the town.
In the private Museum of Padu Borgatella in that same town I saw
goslings in down, which had been collected there. How far north
they migrate in winter I am unable to say.
On Tierra del Fuego I found the birds remarkably tame near
the Jente Grande bay, and in several other places. They did not
mix there with the flocks of Chloephaga dispar.
In confinement, I have found the Ruddy-headed Goose ex-
tremely hardy and very long lived; but to do well it must have as
much grass as it wishes for. The young females begin to lay
generally when they are two or three years old and the number of
eggs laid is usually five, although I have had broods of six. The
goslings, which are carefully tended by the parents, generally grow
very fast, and the first plumage is like that of the parents, only that
the markings are not so well defined, and the white shoulder is a
little mixed with grey ; also the glossy green wing bar is not present.
Before the winter the birds moult their first plumage, except
the greater flight feathers, which are retained until the second moult.
The female is slightly smaller than the male and has of course a
different voice. Some of the adult males have a beautiful pearl
grey colour about the underparts which is lacking in others, where
it is replaced by deep foxy red.

Gooilust, 1913.

By Hubert D. Astley, M.A., F.Z.S., etc.
I might supplement Mr. Blaauw's remarks upon this beautiful
little goose, and record the fact that apart from his birds I have had
two females, imported from the Falkland Islands one in 1900, and
another in 1911. These were presented to me through the kindness
of a lady living near Newbury, whose brother had them sent to her.
From the 1900 bird, several were reared, mated to a gander which
Mr. Blaauw sent me, and from the young goose imported not quite
two years ago. I hope to have more goslings, with a strain of
good fresh blood in their veins, mated as she is to one of the finest
ganders I ever saw.
That I received no more from the Falkland Islands was very
unfortunate, for two others died, either on the voyage home or im-
mediately after they arrived. However I have tw T o breeding pairs,
and with the fresh blood one ought to be able to keep up a good
stock. These little Bernicles are exceedingly pugnacious in the
nesting season, so that only one pair can occupy an enclosure ; and
last year a breeding gander nearly drove my pair of Lesser White-
fronted Geese to death, although the four birds were in a large
enclosure, with a pond dividing the grass land.
None of my birds have the pearl-grey on the underparts that
Mr. Blaauw describes, but the foxy red is so handsome that I would
not wish them otherwise. The time to see this colour is when the
sun is setting, lighting up their breasts with a warm glow.
I find these geese are very fond of Melox, especially in the
winter time, and it helps to keep them in good health, when grass is
not abundant.
The gander is decidedly richer in the fox-red colouring than
the goose, and he stands higher than his mate. When the sexes are
seen together it is not at all difficult to distinguish them ; and the
male bird's head and upper neck is a clearer colour than the female's.
Last year, perhaps from too much in-breeding, I had one
gosling out of a brood of four, which was born blind, and I could

not understand for a day or two why, when the others were feeding
well, the poor baby goose made such bad shots at the food.
On picking it up, I saw that the pupils of the eyes looked life-
less. This gosling survived for three weeks, and was then taken by
a rat or a stoat when the hen, under which they had been hatched
was walking about outside the coop.
Certainly the Ruddy-headed Goose is one of the most hand-
some of its tribe, but to be able to appreciate its good looks one
must see it at close quarters, so as to discern the beautiful pencil-

PETER, MY PAINTED BUNTING.
Passerina ciris.
By Wallace Craig.
Peter was bought in a bird store in Chicago, and given to me
as a present. That was on July 20th, 1891, when I was but a lad,
though I had been already for some years an enthusiastic student of
birds. Peter lived under my care for two and a half years, during
which time he and I became intimate friends. We spent hours
together. And I made frequent written records of what the bird
said and did. From these old records, and from my vivid
recollections, I have prepared the following little biography.
Peter was an active, intelligent and interesting pet. Though
confined in a round Canary cage of the usual small size, he took
abundant exercise, traversing again and again the habitual though
invisible paths up and down and across his cage. One feat which
specially impressed me was his starting from the lower perch, at the
left of the upper one (which was at right angles), jumping up with a
turn to the left, turning 270 deg. and alighting on the upper perch.
He made this three-quarters turn always at the same place, and
ahvays in the same direction. Another cage habit that I recorded,
was that when the cage was cleaned and fresh gravel put in, Peter
Avalked on the floor and picked the gravel; but at other times --
because of the dirt, I thought--he avoided the floor, so much so

Mr. Wallace Craig,
that even if he wished a piece of food that was on the floor he
would try to reach it from the lower perch.
Peter was very fond of bathing, if the water given him was
not too cold. In winter I gave him the bath weekly, in summer
daily. When bathing daily he did not show the same eagerness as
when the bath had been withheld a few days. He always entered
the bath very cautiously, as if to make sure of his footing, his bath
being of the usual type with steep sides more than an inch high.
He first put in one foot, usually the left, and (unless very anxious
to bathe) repeated this several times before jumping in with both
feet. But as soon as his feet were both firmly on the bottom he lost
no more time, putting his head down and splashing vigorously.
Occasionally I let him fly out in the room. When it was
time to get him back into his cage I found this difficult to
accomplish, and I sometimes frightened and fatigued him in the
chase. Yet I found that, once back in his cage, he was as tame
as ever.
His staple food was Canary and rape seed, but he ate a great
variety of other things. He tried whatever I offered to him, tested
several bites, and generally swallowed at least a little of it.
He ate cracker (biscuit) readily. Fruit he enjoyed--apple, orange,
banana, strawberry, water melon, figs ; he cared less for date. In
eating a fig he took each little seed and apparently shelled it, eating
only the kernel. He ate celery, and probably also lettuce and other
green food. He was specially fond of spiders, and almost equally
fond of insects--house flies, bluebottles, May-flies {Ephemeridce) ; he
attacked even grasshoppers. Once when I held by one wing an
enormous " Mourning Horse-fly " {Tabanus atrcitus), Peter pecked
the big buzzing thing, hit its head off, and ate also the body, or at
least part of it. When he saw insects flying or crawling on the
ceiling or walls, he tried to get out of his cage, uttering, a little note,
pit, pit," which called me to get the insect for him.
All Peter's activities showed a good deal of adaptability and
intelligence and what in human life we call common sense. Even
within the first few days under my care he grew accustomed to his
new surroundings, began to grow tame, and learned to expect
the tit-bits (chiefly flies) which I brought him. For two years I

recorded that he lost one fear after another, and grew more tame.
At first I killed the flies for him and dropped them into his cage ;
but he soon learned to take the buzzing fly from my fingers, and to
come for it eagerly before my fingers reached the bars. He busily
examined and tested in his bill whatever I gave him, whether edible
or not. The following quotations from my note-books show
typically his common-sense ways of meeting conditions.
September 15th, 1892. I am sorry to say that I forgot to
feed Peter yesterday. This morning when I went near him he
looked so anxiously at my hands, I thought he wanted a fly, so I
gave him one. As I took his water to him he watched and waited
and drank as soon as it was given to him. He acted similarly as I
brought his seed."
" October 25th, 1893. I must have forgotten to give Peter
water yesterday. [Believe me ! This happened very rarely.] This
morning, when I was taking his water cup out, he came down and
stuck his head as far as he could into the lip of it, not being at all
afraid of my hands. When I took him his water, he began to
drink before the cup was right in."
In both the above cases Peter evidently did his best to tell
me what he wanted.
" January 15th, 1893. Peter seems to have more intelli-
gence than the Canary, in several ways. Peter seldom refuses a
bath when the bird-bath full of tepid water is given to him (once a
week just now), and he sometimes tries to bathe in his drinking
cup : the Canary never bathes, but pretends to in his cup. The
Canary is not afraid of anybody going near him, or even making a
noise or moving quickly ; but if they put his food in his cage he tries
to fight, and is shy of taking food from the hand. Peter is just the
opposite of this : If a person of the house goes near him gently he is
tame and friendly, but if they approach boisterously he is
frightened; and when gone to roost he is shy. But if anyone
offers him a fly he is not only tame but exceedingly anxious to get to
the hand that bears it ; and now when flies are scarce, or wanting,
he often comes to the side of his cage and looks at my hands (he
knows a hand) to see if I have a fly for him. Flies are his great
dainties : when I fix a piece of fruit between the bars of his cage,

Peter, my Painted Bunting.
he looks into my hand for a fly ; when I take my hand away, he
tastes the fruit."
Peter had two sorts of song : a loud song, consisting of a
loud, clear note repeated four or more times without variation ; and
a soft song, which was a pleasing, varied warble. The loud song
was sometimes harsh and piercing, sometimes more moderate and
agreeable. " In uttering it he stands up with his head thrown back
and opens his bill widely at each note. His whole body moves as a
result of the energy with which he utters the strain." The loud
song seemed to be given chiefly in the morning, but the warble
might be heard through the middle of the day. The loud song
seemed to be confined to the summer, whereas the warble w&apos;as given
beautifully in December. Besides the two songs, Peter gave a
small variety of single notes, with divers meanings. One was
given, as we have said, when- he eagerly sought an insect
which was out of his reach.
The first time my bird moulted he lost all, or almost all the red
in his plumage. "The red round his eye was replaced by dusky, the
red of his underparts became yellow, and that of his rump green in
continuance of his green back." Knowing that iron enters into the
composition of many pigments, I put a rusty nail into his drinking
water. The nail was put into the cup in the summer (it must have
been the summer of 1893) and was kept there permanently. When
the bird moulted the next autumn, some of the new feathers came
in with the normal red colour, but others did not, so that the under-
parts were irregularly patched red and yellow. I hoped that in
another year the red would be completely restored, but the death of
the bird frustrated my hopes. Whether the iron in the drinking
water caused the restoration of red colour, is very doubtful; but I
give the facts as observed.
Peter died suddenly, the cause of death being unknown, on
January 23rd, 1894. I was truly sorry at the death of a bird who
had become so friendly and confiding.

MEMBERS' TEA (R) PROPOSED DINNER.
At the last Meeting of the Council of the Avicultural Society
it was decided to give afternoon tea to the Members in the Fellows'
Tea Pavilion in the Zoological Gardens at four p.m. on Friday, June
20th, the day of the summer Meeting of the Council. Each mem-
ber is invited to bring one friend ; and those who wish to be present
are requested to inform the Hon. Secretary not later than Monday,
June 15th. so that the number to be provided for may be known.
It was also suggested at the Council that some members and
their friends might like to dine together in the Zoological Gardens,
at seven o'clock in the evening of the same day ; the price of the
dinner not to exceed 5/- per head, exclusive of wine. The necessary
arrangements for this can be made, if four days notice be given to
the Secretary. R. I. POCOCK, Hon. Sec.,

THE MOULT OF THE BLACK REDSTART.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997621806451613" page_id="32655142"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
SIR,- -- Mr. Teschemaker in his last letter has now made clear a point
which before was not obvious, at any rate to me, that what he meant by what
he called the eclipse plumage was merely the first winter plumage. Of course,
whether this plumage is analogous to the usually accepted idea of an eclipse
plumage in other birds opens up too large a field to discuss here.
The possibility of some individuals of a species having a spring moult and
others not has occurred to many ornithologists who have studied the question.
But the longer one studies it the more one is struck by the fact that in the wild
state every individual is not a law unto itself but follows the rule of ' ' moult or
no moult " to a remarkably constant degree. (I do not say that individuals do
not vary slightly amongst themselves as to the exact amount).
Many birds in captivity moult peculiarly and irregularly, and because an
odd Black Redstart or two change a few feathers in spring in captivity I should
hesitate a good deal before saying that this species has a spring moult. It is
interesting to hear that Bechstein long ago had already determined how long the
male of this species takes to attain fully adult plumage, (subsequent authorities
seem either not to have accepted this or have overlooked it) but Mr. Teschemaker
does not tell us whether this was worked out on captivity birds or not; but
seeing that Mr. Teschemaker and Mr. Galloway from the study of captivity birds
do not seem to have come to the same conclusion, I am afraid that this " par-
ticular brick " in the " stately edifice of Ornithology," which I hoped might be
added by aviculturists, is an insecure one.
In answer to Mr. Galloway's letter, I do not think that the rusty edgings
on the secondaries are a certain sexual characteristic, as I have some females
with broader edgings than some males have. As I have pointed out in British
Birds (Vol. III., p. 397), and as Mr. Galloway partly indicates in his letter,
the Common Redstart does not attain fully adult plumage until the second
autumn moult.
Finally I should like to again protest against the use of such ugly and
lazy abbreviations as " Blackstart," 11 Start " and " Gale "--their use seems to
be confined to some aviculturists -- we shall hear of " Lesser 'throat " and

should not strive to maintain the names of our favourite birds intact : especially
as some of these offensive abbreviations have originated amongst men who have
not exactly received a University education, to put it mildly !
In advertisements of birds too, one often reads names which have plainly
been invented by dealers, simply because they are ignorant of the original ones ;
are we to adopt them because amongst a certain class they may become
I ' popular ? ' '
It is bad enough to hear people ask one if one has seen the " Panto,"
meaning Pantomine, etc., etc. One feels inclined to say ''I haven't been to
the Zoo lately, I suppose a Panto is some new animal there."
And, also, if birds are to have their names clipped, why not people ?
Montgomery might as well become " Gomery " ; and no doubt one will soon

Miss CICELY DORRIEN-SmiTH, writing in May from Gibraltar, says :--
" There are lots of birds here and they are so nice and tame, as they are pro-
tected, and sing all day. There are plenty of Blue Thrushes. When I was
sketching on the Mediterranean side of the Rock, there was one about thirty
yards from me, sitting on a stone and singing away for all he was worth, for a
long time. I also saw two on an old wall, both singing hard, with their body
feathers all puffed out. Another day, I saw a dozen, or more.
There are two Peregrine's nests on the Rock, one on the east, the other on
the west side.
I also saw two Ospreys one day, and a Black Chat. They say there are a
good many of the latter about.
I went over to the Spanish mainland one afternoon, and there the Night-
ingales were singing everywhere, and I also saw a beautiful male Golden Oriole,
as well as Kites, Eagles, and Vultures."

At Woburn Abbey, Lord Tavistock has found that Banksian Cockatoos
thrive on oak-apple grubs, when obtainable. Two of these rare birds, which
were apparently hopelessly ill, were pulled round after a diet of the grubs.
Lord Tavistock regrets that he did not make this discovery sooner, as he
feels sure that he could by this means have saved a tame cock Banksian, " the
most interesting and charming creature I ever had,".as it was not nearly so ill
as the hens when they were first taken in hand, but just wasted slowly away
through refusing food, while suffering from nothing more serious than a mild
internal inflammation.

"by." (The Parrakeets live in a semi-wild state in the gardens and park of
Woburn Abbey). "It would be all right if the Cock Barnard had not got another

THE CHESTNUT-BELLIED BLUE ROCK
THRUSH.

writes :--" Every particular relating to the history and economy of
" this species of Bock-Thrush appears to be as much unknown or
" buried in obscurity as it was when I published my Century of
" Birds from the Himalaya Mountains thirty-three years ago."
Even Mr. Jerdon merely states that this Thrush has hitherto, he

believed, only been found in the Himalayas, generally at a consider-
able elevation. It is not rare about Darjeeling, and is found on the
Khasia Hills.
In June, 1912, Mr. Erost brought over two pairs, one of
which came into my possession, the other going to the London
Zoological Gardens.
My birds are, as I write, in full beauty in a large outdoor
aviary, where they underwent a complete vernal moult, beginning in
March. The female is now darker than she is depicted in the
coloured plate, the original of which was painted in February.
In an aviary these birds seem quite peaceable, but are fond
of sitting in dark corners, on the top of some log close to the roof,
etc. The male displays to his mate sometimes, puffing out his body
feathers and uttering tones of a metallic sound.
His song is not unlike that of the European Blue Bock
Thrush.

Mr. Hubert D. Astley,
very tame, after the manner of their kind ; but in an aviary they
are somewhat shy ; but only ' somewhat.'
I have not had these extremely handsome Rock Thrushes in
my possession long enough to be able to write much about them ;
as far as nesting goes, the hen was seen carrying hay about in May,
but she was not very serious over it, and if all is well we hope for
another year to bring more definite results in this direction.
Of course these Rock Thrushes are not true Thrushes, as are
the species Turdus (represented by our Song Thrush) and Merula (e.g.
the Blackbird) and Geocichla --the so-called Ground Thrushes, of
which the Orange-headed Ground Thrush is an example. The
Rock-Thrushes are nearer to the Chats and Redstarts : indeed the
European Rock Thrush (P. saxatilis ) much resembles, in his move-
ments, a large Redstart, quivering the tail in exactly the same
manner. The Italians call him 'Codirossone,' which signifies the
Great Red-tail, in distinction to ' Codirosso,' which is the Common
Red-start; the termination ' one ' meaning something large.
Major Perreau brought a pair (?) of the Chestnut-bellied Rock
Thrush to England in March, and Mr. Frost (in Major Horsbrugh's
collection) also imported one or two.
These Rock Thrushes, if kept in a cage, need exercise, a daily
bath, and a good insectivorous food, with fruit mixed in it, and fresh
insects. In this way, I kept a European Blue Rock Thrush for
thirteen years. I believe that my birds, and the pair that went to
the London Zoological Gardens were the first to be imported alive,
probably to Europe, and certainly into England.
SUN-BIRDS.*
By Hubert D. Astley.
With the advent of the beautiful Himalayan Yellow-backed
Sun-birds (Gdtliopyga seherice ) which Major Horsbrugh imported, we
aviculturists, now that we have discovered how easily they can be
kept, when once acclimatized, look eagerly for the importation of
some of the other species of this lovely family.
Mr. A. Ezra is writing for the Magazine on several species which he keeps&apos;
successfully.

I hope later on to publish a coloured plate of the above-
mentioned species. In the sunlight the crown of the male shines
like an emerald, his back and breast like a ruby, his moustaches are
sapphires, his upper tail coverts and lower back, topaz with a touch
of emerald.
And these Sun-Birds are so fearless and intelligent. They
can be trained to come on one's hand in a very short time, where
those who are songsters, and many species have very sweet notes,
will sit and sing. They are hardy, for so many go to high altitudes,
at any rate in the summer time; altitudes ranging from six to seven
thousand feet.
(Fdhopyga bella must be an absolute treasure ; very tiny,
with saffron yellow breast, scarlet back, emerald crown and tail, etc.
It is an inhabitant of the Philippine Islands. And as to the Fire-
tailed Sun-Bird (A. ignicauda ) from the Himalayan Mountains, I
feel a grudge against Mr. Frost that he did not succeed in bringing
some back !
It is rather a larger Sun-Bird, forehead and crown steel
violet-blue: back of the head, neck, back, and upper-tail coverts, and
two central tail feathers, bright scarlet ; lower back, yellow ; chin
and throat metallic violet, shading into steel blue : under surface of
the body, yellow ; strongly shaded with scarlet on the centre of the
chest. Furthermore the tail is very long, measuring five inches of
the bird's total length of eight.
It is very common in the Sikkim, and in the cold weather
may be found in the Subhimalayan tracts, e.g. at Kalsi in the
Dehran Dhoon.
It is also found in the western hill portion of Assam, etc.
At Darjeeling it appears in considerable numbers about April, the
males at that time in the process of donning their gorgeous nuptial
plumage.
To obtain this species of Sun-Bird only, an expedition would
be worth while. They must be perfectly beautiful ! And so easy
to keep. Some bottles of Horlick's Malted Milk, and some jars of
Marmite and of honey are sufficient. There need be no failing of
food-supply on the voyage, and all one wants is some hot water to
mix it with, day by day.

Mr. Hubert D. Astley,
There are a goodly number of members of the species
CEtliopyga, all with longish pointed tails, and mostly shewing scarlet
and green and yellow in their plumage. CEthopyga flavostriata is a
beauty, the bright scarlet chin and throat being strongly streaked
with yellow in distinct lines, running downwards from the chin.
It inhabits the Celebes.
The Sun-Birds classed under Cinnyris have square tails, the
Purple Sun-Bird {C. asiaticus ) being&apos; one that has been seen on the
show-bench for some time. In the sunshine a very beautiful
creature, looking rather like a miniature Rifle-Bird, but the mag-
nificent general colour of deep shot blues, greens, and purples is
relieved by the orange yellow pectoral tufts at the shoulders. The
Purple Sun-Bird extends far into the Himalayas, and is abundant
in Ceylon in the maritime districts and low jungles.
Mr. Holdsworth wrote that at a Government rest-house in
the extreme south of the island, a pair of these birds had a nest in
the verandah, which was fastened to an iron rod hanging from the
roof, once used for suspending a lamp.
The birds showed very little fear, although he was for several
days sitting within a few feet of the nest. Mr. Morgan says that it
breeds in the Neilgherries up to an elevation of 6000 feet, as well as
in the plains.
The song is thought to resemble that of the Chaffinch, but
less strong, and more melodious. Others have likened it to that of
a Willow-Wren.
In winter it may be seen sporting on the sunny side of lofty
trees. As soon as the Saliajna {Hyper anther a maringa) begins to
blossom, it is constantly seen hovering before the white flowers, and
as each forest-tree blossoms, it rifles them of their sweets.
Dr. Jerdon has written that a pair built their nest just out-
side his house-door at Julna. It was commenced on a thick spiders'
web, by attaching to it various fragments of paper, cloth, straw,
grass, and other substances, till it had secured a firm hold of the
twig to which the spider's web adhered ; and the nest suspended on
this, was then completed by adding other fragments of the same
materials. The entrance was at one side, near the top, and had a
slight projecting roof, or awning, over it. The female laid two eggs,

of a greenish-grey tinge with dusky spots. The first nest was
accidentally destroyed after the eggs were laid ; and the couple
immediately commenced building another in a small tree at the
other side of the door, and in this instance, as in the last, began
operations on a fragment of a spider's web ; which is a hint for
nesting in an aviary !
Another observer describes the nest as composed of small
twigs, pieces of grass and leaves, and lined with thistle-down and
silk cotton. It is generally adorned with the excrement of cater-
pillars, small bits of rag, paper, etc. Mr. Morgan records that a
pair which built in front of his office at Kurnool, in an acacia tree,
had the most extraordinary nest he had ever seen. It w T as orna-
mented with bits of blotting-paper, twine, and old service stamps
that had been left lying about. The whole structure was most
compactly bound together with cobv r ebs, and had a long string of
caterpillar-excrement w T ound round it. It breeds from February to
June. They have tw 7 o broods in rapid succession, usually in the
same nest. When the female is on the nest, her little head can
be seen just peeping out of the hole under the ' aw T ning,'
A nest at Agra was built on a loose piece of thatch-cord in a
verandah, and on the side of the nest, stuck on like a signboard,
was a piece of a torn-up letter with ' My dear Adam ' on it; pre-
sumably the little Eve had written it in admiration of her husband
with the shining plumage.
The Sun-Birds form part of the large group of Honey-
Suckers. The plumage of the males in nearly all instances, differs
strongly from that of the females, and is as a rule very brilliant,
vying with the colours of the Humming-Birds. No coloured picture
can really do them justice on account of the metallic hues which
change in great variety according to the light.
Sun-Birds in a wild state feed on minute insects, and suck
honey from flowers with their long slender tongues. They do not,
like the Humming-Birds, hover in front of flowers to feed, but cling
to them.
The range of the family is an extensive one. Africa, Mada-
gascar and the neighbouring islands ; Palestine ; Southern Asia ;
Sumatra, Java, Borneo, Philippines, Celebes, New Guinea, North

Mr. Maurice Portal,
Australia, and the Papuan and Moluccan Archipelagos. They are
not found in Europe, nor yet in the Western Hemisphere.
The species entitled Hedydipna is distinguished by a shorter
bill, whilst the tail is square with the two centre feathers in the
male much elongated, and the ends rounded and slightly widened,
and this is also the case in the Nectarinice, which species inhabit
South, West and North-East Africa.
Anthobaphes is another, in which the tail is very strongly
graduated, with the two centre feathers narrow and much elongated.
The males have pectoral tufts at the shoulders. They are found in
Cape Colony and Little Namaqua Land.
If any aviculturists wish for something really lovely, tame,
confident, and when acclimatized, easily kept, I can certainly re-
commend Sun-Birds ; but the males are very pugnacious, and -will
even bully their mates in confined quarters. When let out of their
cage, they will flit lightly about, peering here and there in a fearless
manner, and if hungry (or rather, thirsty) they will boldly come to
a vessel of their liquid food. The long tongue protrudes and dips
in, whilst the small throat vibrates as the liquid is sucked down.
Unlike Sugar Birds, they do not seem to eat sponge-cake, but will
suck all the liquid out of it. On a journey a good plan is to put in
the food glass a perfectly clean piece of sponge, which should be
scalded in boiling water every day. The Sun-Birds will suck the
liquid which is prevented from spilling over.

Probably most of us who are interested in the keeping of
Waterfowl of various kinds, fall into the common error of overcrowding
our pond or ponds--unless blessed with special facilities for keeping
Ducks. If one only looks on one's pond as a source of intense
interest in noting the many changes of plumage and colour which a
Duck passes through in the twelve months, and noting their various
calls and modes of courtship, the over crowding matters less--as

provided ample green food (such as cabbage in winter and lettuces
or lawn mown grass in summer) is given, together with sufficient
corn and gravel and grit and old lime is provided, the birds will
thrive well enough as long as the water is fresh. On the other
hand, if one wants nests, then the trouble begins.
Duck will not court and nest freely if they have a crowded
water area, even though the surroundings may be good for nesting&apos;
purposes. I have noted that nothing puts a pair off courtship more
than being worried by other birds. Again, in Spring time some
species are much more pugnacious than others and trouble is often
caused by a male driving all other birds away from the water near
where his mate is thinking of nesting even. I am convinced that
prolonged fighting and disturbance, means eggs dropped in the water
and no nest.
If the facilities exist for it, I would prefer to pen up birds of
a species and give ample nesting room, even though a smaller water
area were given during the nesting season.
It would appear that to ensure success in getting one's ducks
to lay, three things are necessary.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.998723666666667">
1. To have hand-reared stock.
2. Not too many birds on the water.
3. Avoid looking too often to see if they are nesting.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.997995928571428" page_id="32655161"  page_num="Page 259" year="" vol="">
This last is one of the hardest things to avoid doing--and it
is really needless, as if the ducks are carefully observed early in the
morning, it will be found that most of them lay between 6 a.m. and
8 a.m., and by watching the water, you see what females are off and
probably see from what direction they come back on ; where you
see a female come on and be at once joined by her mate, you may
be sure she is laying.
If you later miss her off the water during the day, it is fair
to assume she has started to sit, and one can then look for and take
the nest if desired.
There is no accounting for the tastes of Ducks--some sites
are always in request for nests, others, which look to the human eye
better or identical, are never looked at. This year a Mandarin laid
in one of five boxes, all identical and three of which faced the same

Stray Notes on the Keeping of Waterfowl.
way. A Gadwall turned her out and pushed eggs to one side and
laid eight eggs, which I took. Two days later a Tufted was in and
now I note another Mandarin goes in too.
Moorhens should never be allowed on a pond where any
rarer sorts of Waterfowl are kept, they not only suck the eggs, but
will also kill small ducks when hatched. Last year a Moorhen sucked
a Baikal Teal's nest for me and was shot with the air gun as it finished
an egg. On opening the bird, egg, etc., was visible, so no possible
doubt exists. I am told the Australian Water Bail is rather worse.
In the rearing of young ducks of Teal, Wigeon, Gadwall,
Shoveller, Mandarin, Tufted, Chiloe, etc., I find duck weed and a
few ants' eggs (dried ones or fresh) of the greatest use, combined
with duck meal and fine egg. If young birds will not take on to
feed, I have found scalded Vermicelli, hung in strips on blades of
grass, or dropped on backs of ducklings to be a means of getting
them to feed. Probably the man who tries most little dodges, is
the most successful rearer of birds who are slow to start feeding.
Shell Ducks seem to thrive best on a good many worms or
strips of fish, as well as duck meal. Small chopped worms I have
found excellent too, and if placed in the water in shallow dishes or
tin lids, often help to bring on backward ducks.
Much can be done to increase the numbers of the more
uncommon nesting Ducks in England, such as Gadwall, Tufted,
Wigeon, Teal, by putting one's surplus young birds, in September, on
suitable ponds or lakes, with the feathers of one wfing cut; they will
not be able to fly until the following July-August, or thereabouts,
so will probably have nested--or if a species which does not breed
the first year, then at any rate, they will have become used to the
place and probably stop about--and breed next season.
Wild fowl are decreasing all over the world and it behoves us
all to do our best to help to maintain a good stock in England.

By A. Trevor-Battye. M.A.
At the Editor's request for something&apos; about the Great
Bustard (Otis tarda) I gladly offer this little general account. (I
remember that the practical side has already been covered in the
Magazine, notably by letters from Mr. St. Quintin). One of the
pictures which these remarks accompany will be interesting to
those who have not had an opportunity of seeing a bird of this
species on the nest. Mr. Hubert Astley took the photograph in
an enclosed orchard at Benham Valence. This individual was a
Spanish bird ; she came from a nest on, I think, the Isla Major below
Coria del Rio on the Guadalquivir, and was brought up, with others
that reached me at the same time, in a little back yard of a cottage
in that village.
The other photograph shows the astonishing transformation
of a male Great Bustard during 'display.' This bird was also for
two years in my garden ; he was photographed by Mr. St. Quintin.&apos; 1 &apos;
The Great Bustard is found from " Spain to Mesopotamia "
(Newton), but its principal centres in Europe are, I think, the
Crimea, Turkey, and the Danubian Provinces. It is a bird of ex-
tremely powerful flight, although the slow movement of its wings is
deceptive and gives no idea whatever of its swift progression, mis-
leading at first even a practised partridge-driving&apos; shot.
In Andalucia, the Great Bustard is shot by the following
method. Late in February or early in March, when the birds are in
the waving green corn, guns and drivers start out on horses. On
Bustards being sighted perhaps a long&apos; way off -- for males when in full
display are as conspicuous as marble monuments -- the horses string&apos;
out, a driver keeping with each gun. When the direction of the wind
and the lie of the ground have determined the line of ambush, each
gun in turn slips off his horse (on the side away from the Bustards)
and drops into the corn or other cover. His companion leads along
the horse, and the Bustards, who keep their gaze on the moving&apos;
horses, do not notice the ruse. When all the guns are favourably
placed, the drivers ride out and round so as to get behind the birds.

On the Great Bustard.
Then they advance, and finally work the birds over the guns as in
partridge-driving.
A male bird shot thus in full flight comes to the ground with
a considerable shock ; for though 27 lbs. is the weight of the heaviest
Great Bustard we have personally seen shot, they are said to reach
as great a weight as 38 lbs. (Newton). In Spain the wild bird does
not live only upon crops and wild herbage but on much animal food
such as lizards, insects and mice.
It is not a little curious that the males should ' display ' long
before the coming of the females, which are said not to arrive before
April. These birds in captivity make four distinct noises, viz., a
rough bark or " honk " made habitually when scared, a deep guttural
11 laugh " when visited in their paddock and not afraid, a deep sound
like a " stopped " note on a base viol, made by the male when in full
display, and a kind of whine, only heard, in my experience, when
their feeder leaves their paddock; then they call after him with
this particular cry. They are interesting birds to keep, though
always rather an anxiety because of their liability to panic : yet in
Mr. Walter Buck's lovely garden at Jerez de la Frontera, where they
are quite at liberty, they are so bold that they dispute possession
of food with two huge mastiffs.
The Great Bustard has a particular interest for us, as once a
British bird--one indeed that just managed to retain its place in
Norfolk up to some 75 years ago, within the possible memory of
many an old man living yet. But in the beginning of the last
century there were groups of these birds, not only in Norfolk, but in
Yorkshire, Lincolnshire, Suffolk and Wiltshire, though they seem to
have disappeared by that time from Dorset, Hants and Cambridge-
shire, where they were formerly known. They frequented large open
spaces--the plains, heaths and wide corn-lands. It would have
been in any case impossible for so shy and so conspicuous a bird to
survive the pressure of the increasing population about its narrowing
borders, but, to begin with, the extension of plantations robbed it
of its sense of security, and then the invention of the corn-drill and
horse-hoe sealed its fate (Stevenson), for the use of these implements
inevitably led to the discovery and destruction of its nests.
*Tke same thing is apparently happening in the case of the Corncrake, owing
to the hay-cutting machines. Ed.

A solitary Great Bustard, reported from Norfolk two or three
years ago, was believed to be the sole surviving remnant of a com-
pany of seventeen (?) birds turned out by Lord Walsingham some
few years before.
The re-establishment of this noble bird in its old haunts in
England has been a dream with many who regret its loss, and some
attempts have been made in this direction, but each time with dis-
appointing results. In the opinion of the present writer no efforts--
on however large a scale--are likely to meet with success. Those
adverse agencies which acted before would act again, only "more so,"
and this applies to the birds whether pinioned or full-winged. Take
the most naturally favourable of their old haunts left--take Salisbury
Plain. Consider the ease with which a male bird in display could be
there detected, and across how great a distance ! Think of the foes
to pinioned birds--of foxes, dogs, men ! Even if by any chance a
hen did save her nest, could she ever hope to bring up her young
against such odds? If, on the other hand, the experiment were
made with full-winged birds, each would quickly be shot in one part
or another of the country. (We know what happened w 7 hen the
wise men of Gotham tried to keep their Cuckoo in the tree !)
It is to be hoped that any landowner who may contemplate
again liberating Great Bustards will not sacrifice such noble birds in
this way, for the experiment is foredoomed to failure, but instead
will set about making " pheasantries " for them on a large scale :
for the best we can now hope is that some one may have the
good fortune to hatch and rear the Great Bustard in a semi-
domesticated state.

Over half-a-century ago--we were at lunch one day when
" Jones " was announced; and in he came with that look of pent-up
importance which betokens the man who has something to say and
won't be happy until he has said it ; and scarcely waiting until he
had taken a seat, he burst forth, addressing an elder brother of

Mr. Reginald Phillipps,
hawk's nest in the Nether Wood and the old birds are taking his
chickens."
A stranger listening to the conversation that followed, in
which my brother and his quondam chum took a leading part, would
have assumed that the latter was an old and experienced falconer
who knew all about falcons and falconry that there was to be known
--and a good deal more besides. As a matter of fact, he had never
possessed a hawk in his life--I doubt if he had ever kept so much
as a canary. It was I who had the birds (hawks, jays, magpies,
&amp;c.) and had inspired the hawking mania in his breast ; and, chanc-
ing to come upon a book on falconry, he had so worked himself up
into a fever that he was instant on the subject --sometimes in season
but more often very much out of it; the attack while it lasted was
acute, but happily for others it was short-lived.
While the chums chattered, I sat still without saying a word ;
indeed, the two grown-ups were far too superior to recognise my
existence. A much sat-upon younger son, I had become reserved
and silent: and I listened to their vapourings with contempt--I fear
I seldom was so pleased as when I saw them floundering helplessly
in some Natural History quagmire. I had kept birds and beasts
ever since I could toddle, and, at the time we are writing about,
flattered myself that I was acquainted with every nest of importance
anywhere in the neighbourhood ; nevertheless I was now brought
face to face with the ugly fact that there was a hawk's nest in the
Nether Wood, little more than half-a-mile away, and I knew not of
it whilst others did. I felt that such a circumstance was a serious
reflection on my character, -- though why this should have been is
not quite clear.
The Nether Wood occupied the whole of one side of a rather
deep valley, running along the hillside for a mile or so, but was
comparatively narrow. It was mostly an oak wood, which had
been thinned out a few years previously, with a luxuriant under-
growth of hazel hushes. x\t one end, however, in the top right
corner, the oaks gave way to some thick tall trees of the beech
species; and, just outside, there was a little hamlet ; never having
found a nest of interest near the hamlet, I had not searched this
part of the wood, and therefore concluded that the nest spoken of

by " Jones " must be among the beeches. Thus it came about that,
as soon as the two tattlers thought proper to bestir their nether
extremities in addition to that other little member which wagged
ceaselessly, I led them (for to have gone without me never entered
their heads) straight to this corner, and, in but a few minutes, had
spotted the nest, chucked off my coat, and was gliding up the beech
as agilely and silently as a monkey with an eye on a sleeping bird,
leaving my two inconsequent companions chattering&apos; aw r ay upon any
and every subject but the one which had brought us to the place.
On getting clear of the hazel bushes, I paused for a moment
to inspect--and there fell on my ears a sound which sent a thrill
tingling&apos; through my wdiole system. I had believed that there was
not a wild bird about our parts whose voice I could not distinguish ;
nay, I could tell what each call meant. I had thought that the
nest aloft was a Kestrel's, but the voice which now floated up from
the valley below was no Kestrel's voice-- it was something new ! ! !
It was a ventriloquial cry, for although it sounded as if far away it
came from the lower edge of the wood only some two hundred yards
off, and from birds on the wing which were flying&apos; backwards and
forwards but out of sight. Quivering with excitement, I resumed
my climb as stealthily as possible, for the season was getting on and
young&apos; hawks ought to be strong on the wing ; and I was soon close
under the nest, which was high up in the tree ; taking a firm hold
with my left hand, and with my right free and ready to make a
pounce should the inmates be stampeded by my appearance, I slowly
drew myself up until I could see into it. This caution was not
needed, however, for the three nestling&apos;s were but a few days old; so
I speedily descended, and, hustling my loquacious elders away from
the spot, and keeping&apos; them temporarily quiet with uplifted finger
and a hus-s-sh , I asked them, when at a safe distance, whether they
had heard "the birds." I need not have asked the question; of
course they had not--had not heard anything but the sound of their
own sweet voices; a strange bird? what a comical idea! had I a
tile loose in the upper storey ? surely much bird-nesting had made
me crazy. It ivas a common Kestrel's nest: did not he " Jones," say
it ? so what was the good of arguing&apos; ! With thoughts of unutterable

Mr. Reginald Phillipps ;
contempt, I withdrew into my shell.--Before separating, we agreed
to come back in a few days' time.
On more than one occasion, I had taken say a couple of
youngsters from a nest, and, a little later, had compared my " bring-
ings up " with those which had been left behind. I had tried this
with Kestrels and had found that, however much care I might
bestow on the little ones, the parents could beat me hollow in the
rearing of young birds. It is not solely a matter of food, but there
are also the tender nursing and the gentle warmth of the parent-
birds brooding over their offspring which can only be feebly imitated
by man ; and, bearing this in mind, I knew it would be a mistake to
take the young hawks at so early a date as that decided upon--but
farmer Innes had to be reckoned with ! These sturdy old-fashioned
farmers of long ago, notwithstanding their out-of-date methods of
farming, were splendid fellows of untold value to the nation, and
they had their own little way of dealing with hawks' nests when
chickens went too fast. As soon as they could spare the time,
taking up their double-barrelled muzzle-loader from its corner (a
novel weapon with Innes, who still had an old flint-lock in service-
able condition), they would lie in wait at the foot of the tree if
necessary for hours; sooner or later an old bird would venture to
return, one barrel directed with a certain aim would bring it to the
ground, the other would be fired into the bottom of the nest, and off
our friend would go feeling that he had done his duty--by his
chickens. I remember examining a Kestrel's nest which had been
thus treated. One well-feathered nestling had been hit with that
second barrel, and the survivors had fallen upon it tooth and nail
and had left practically nothing but the frame, the large feathers and
the head--usually the first part attacked, but it had proved an over-
hard nut for them to crack. They w T ere so ravenous that, presum-
ably the other parent had been too panic-stricken to return to the
nest.
The appointed day found the three of us once more at the
tree, and I was quickly among the branches. On this occasion the
old birds were bolder, and with wild cries were sweeping around;
and they made bold and threatening swoops in my direction as I
neared the nest. The sky was bright and clear, but I could not see

any colours--only two dark silhouetted forms, with very long sharply-
pointed almost Swift-shaped wings, dashing through and cleaving
the air in a manner no Kestrel could ever approach. To my trained
eye, the flight and shape of the bird on the wing were absolutely
different from those of the Kestrel: to my trained ear, the cry like-
wise was absolutely different and distinct. They were not Kestrels
--that was pat; they were not Sparrow-Hawks--that was certain ;
Merlins did not come our way and never (so I then thought) nested
in trees : then, what could they he ? In a few minutes, the three
white balls of down were in my cap, the cap was in my mouth, and
I had descended and was displaying my treasures to the unbelievers
below. Yes, they had seen and heard the hawks--just common
Kestrels ; but the cry ?--just the well-known cry of the Kestrel,
which any body who knew anything about hawks would recognise in
a moment; I pointed to the moustache (cheek-stripe), the shades of
which were beginning to appear--exactly as in the young Kestrel!
Oh, the indescribable vanity and conceit of the ignorant! Surely
they know more than all the rest of the world put together. And
they are so happy in their own superlative emptiness ; he would be
a churl indeed who would grudge them their length of ear ! On
reaching home and examining the new arrivals quietly by myself, I
found that some of the quills were beginning to burst forth and
were dark like those of the Peregrine:-- Kestrels indeed !!!
A day or two later, " Jones" called to enquire how the young
"Kestrels" were getting on; and how he jeered and mocked and
scoffed, before other members of the family, at my obstinacy in
maintaining that the new birds were not Kestrels ! Like so many
of his calibre, including a great number of the " softer " sex, to
differ from their dictum is regarded as a personal affront ; he had
been nursing his dignity ever since our last meeting, and now was
mad angry at my total disregard of his opinion. Was he not " Jones "
of Brazenose, who had got him a name at Oxford for pulling a good
oar, and I but a beardless youth ? And the conceit of these people
is such, that the possibility of others not being of their way of
thinking never occurs to them :--and so the poor man allowed his
feelings to carry him a little too far; and great was the shock to his
self-esteem when my tall father, who had been reading or pretending

Mr. Reginald Phillipps,
to, abruptly rose from his seat with a look on his face that there
was no mistaking, ancl which caused the inane laugh of superior
wisdom to fizzle out in a sickly giggle. Haying too much old-
fashioned courtesy to attack a visitor (the son of an old friend, too)
under his own roof; the old man, at one time a keen sportsman,
field naturalist, &amp;c., and who knew our British birds right well, not
trusting himself to speak, for he was impatient of folly, took out a
book, turned over a few leaves, and, laying it on a table before
"Jones" tapping the page almost menacingly, pointed to--
THE HOBBY.
Falco subbuteo.
Some little time after this, " Jones" arrived one day with a
military friend who genuinely went in for falconry, and who brought
a trained Goshawk for us to look at. This gentleman, hearing of
the Hobbies, had expressed a great desire to see them ; he said that,
if he had been in my place, he would have erected a booth (of
branches) near the nest and would have stayed in it for a week in
order to watch and note the habits of the species. He gave me
the address of Lord Somebody's falconer, who, for half-a-crown,
sent me a hood for a Hobby : but the hood was too small even for a
male : so it would seem that the practical man, accustomed to handle
Peregrines, Goshawks, and perhaps even Gyrs, had no real know-
ledge of this rare little falcon.
In the following summer, I found a second nest, this time in an
exceptionally thick forcing oak-wood almost ready for the forester
and quite on the flat. In this, again, there were just three nestlings.
During the third summer, the last before I was turned out of
the home-nest to fly--or otherwise, I found a Hobby's nest (perhaps
there was but one pair) in a much larger oak-wood, which covered a
hill of considerable size. The oak in which the nest had been built
was just about in the centre of a wide bend or bay in the side of the
hill, and commanded a magnificent view of the open country below,
an ideal position for a falcon's eyrie. But, here, an ill-omened
silence overshadowed the place. In vain I looked for those swoop-
ing forms ; in vain I listened if I might hear but the faintest whisper
of those well-beloved cries--all was silent as the grave. Certain

marks on the tree shewed that some one had been up there before
me; and, on finding one young bird in the nest, I felt that it
was one more than I might have hoped for: probably it had
been left temporarily on the chance that a shot might be had at the
surviving parent; for there was a large farm-house in the front, not
very far away, with chickens galore. It was nearly fully feathered,
but had been over-exposed, for it had a vocal defect in its call, which
experience had already taught me meant death ; and in course of
time it sickened and died in the manner described below.
In each of these three cases, the nest was Crow-like: in fact,
doubtless each was that of a Carrion Crow in which young had
been reared earlier in the year ; for the Hobby is a late breeder, not
laying its eggs until June.
In no case did I see the egg. Howard Saunders says,--
" The eggs, usually 3 in England, but up to 5 in number on the
Continent, are often yellowish-white, closely freckled with rufous,
and can then be easily distinguished from those of the Kestrel;
but sometimes they are suffused with reddish-brown and are
therefore not so recognizable."
Doubtless, in England at any rate, this species has but one
brood in the year.
The Hobby is a summer visitor to this country ; and, what-
ever the adults may be, the young are not robust. I used to keep
my hawks loose in a large loft, with netting over the " window,"
and, on fine days, would place any nestlings I might have in a
basket, which I suspended from a bough in a quiet unfrequented
part of the shrubbery, with the result that, as they grew to be
branchers, they learned their way about and to know me, my whistle,
and my dog. Kestrels and Sparrow-Haw T ks flourished under this
treatment; but I found that if a Hobby, even when well feathered,
were exposed to wind, it would have its voice affected, and, when
once so touched, would certainly die. Eor some two months, the
crack in the voice would be the only apparent symptom of mischief ;
but eventually the invalid would become puffy, a greenish discharge
would flow from its mouth, and it would die from some bronchial
trouble. Thus even in those far-off days I learned that a too free
and general application of the fresh-air treatment will leave some

Mr. Reginald Phillipps,
victims in its track : what is one bird's life is another bird's death !
However, not in any case did a young Hobby become affected after
it had grown sufficiently to fly freely about.
I customarily allowed the Hobbies and Kestrels, and some-
times the less reliable Sparrow-Hawks, with bells on * (ferret bells),
and various other birds, to fly loose during the day ; and certainly
it was a pretty sight, and a very pleasing experience too, as I chanced
any time to be returning home, that there should suddenly appear
from various points a number of hawks flying dead at me, each in a
bee-line like so many spokes of a wheel, and all bursting into their
wildest cries as they neared me, perching on my upraised arm, on
my shoulders and head, screaming and fighting over my cap (which
I had to take care of), and frolicking and circling around me in reck-
less delight; and many were the queer stories, not altogether fables,
which the country folk had of "Master Reginald " and the birds.
One case was certainly a little startling. I was some way from
home, and a large flock of Rooks and Jackdaws was passing over
homeward-bound, when one of the latter, detaching ifself from its
comrades, curved backwards and downwards and circled round and
round my head uttering friendly caws of recognition, and, settling on
the ground only three or four yards away, greeted me with unfeigned
pleasure. It was a truant that had given me wing-bail some time
previously. Two country fellows near-by looked upon the scene
with stern set faces and grave suspicion. In earlier days, I suppose,
I should have been subjected to a treatment of bell, book, and candle,
and a warm quarter-of-an-hour at the stake. But I am digressing.
Towards evening, I had but to sound my whistle, and seldom had
trouble in getting my little flock into their loft. I must admit, I
fear, that the Hobbies were neither so active and interesting on the
wing, so clever in finding their way back to the mews, nor so en-
gaging as pets as were the common and unwisely-despised Kestrels.
I have referred to the Hobby as being a rare species ; never-
theless, from later observations, I am inclined to think that it may

been a time, not so very far distant in my days, when the species was fairly

be less uncommon than many suppose. At any rate it seems to
favour the neighbourhood of London, for I have noticed it in Hert-
fordshire, in Kent, and even in meadows adjoining Barnes Common
of all places, and not so very many years ago either. Probably if
people could learn to distinguish its flight and call, it would be more
often recognised ; but what hope is there when so many still tell us
that the flight of the cuckoo is like that of a hawk ( which hawk ?
no two of our small hawks fly alike, and that it is difficult to dis-
tinguish a hawk from a cuckoo.
The wild Hobby on the wing is a beautiful sight ; its powers
of flight are marvellous. On the rare occasions that I have seen a
wild Peregrine, so far as flight is concerned, it seemed to be nowhere
compared with the Hobby. The latter is not a large bird, but its
wings are long and pointed, and, when at rest, extend beyond the
tip of the tail. In outward appearance, it is of the Peregrine type
and quite different from Kestrel, Merlin, or Sparrow-Hawk. The
sexes are much alike, but the female is the larger of the two.
Speaking from memory, for I have no book on the subject to
refer to, in olden days the Hobby was used for flying at larks and
other small birds, and (I am sure I have heard or read somewhere)
is the only falcon that can take a climbing (soaring) Snipe. Per-
sonally I never succeeded in doing anything with my Hobbies--but
then they were fat, lazy, overfed pets. The would-be falconer must
take the matter seriously, and ever have at the back of his mind
the Arabic proverb,--"Keep your cat hungry and she will catch the
rat." Few hawks will give real sport except when sharp-set.
I have been told, though I am unable to confirm the state-
ment from my own observations, that, in the wild state, the Hobby
feeds largely on insects as well as on small birds. I have never seen
it attempt to catch either mouse or vole.
Some 26-7 years ago, I kept hawks, &amp;c., here in London, the
collection including a Hobby. In the aviary, although as tame as a
kitten, she was somewhat uninteresting. It is the fashion to assert,
and to assert dogmatically, that birds of prey, in confinement, do as
well in a small as in a large place, or something to that effect. But
on this point I differ absolutely : the mistake lies in not providing
them with a sufficiently large place. My aviary was large euough

for the comparatively short-winged Kestrels, who were as active as
cats, the liveliest of the lively, and ever on the look-out for mischief :
but the Hobby, a fine powerful female in perfect feather, found no
scope for her long wings in a ten-foot-high aviary. Such birds do
not naturally hop and walk about ; they are creatures of the air,
and need an abundance of space. Certainly this is easier talked of
than put into practice--but why put the saddle on the wrong horse !
My London Hobby seemed to be so dis-spirited by her (to her)
cramped surroundings that, at feeding time, I often had to shut her
up by herself, for other birds, notably the Kestrels, would swoop and
snatch away the food, even out of her very beak.
In October, 1898, a really nice pair of Hobbies was exhibited
at a Crystal Palace Bird Show. Even to this day I remember the
force I had to put upon myself to keep my #4 in my pocket and
leave the hawks behind, even although, by that time, I had ceased
to keep birds of prey, either diurnal or nocturnal--so tenacious are
the bands of old associations.
REVIEW.
A DICTIONARY OF ENGLISH AND FOLK NAMES
OF BRITISH BIRDS. *
An interesting work, which, including variations of spelling,
contains nearly 5000 names.
English 5ooZc-names are gathered from past authors giving
the history and first usage of the accepted names of species, and also
the provincial, local, and dialect names in use now or formerly in the
British Isles. The accepted English names are printed in capitals,
whilst the names of introduced or doubtful species are in italics.
We find the Siskin is called Aberdevine, etc. The Bullfinch,
" Hoop " (it is known under that name in Cornwall).
Avocet is derived from Avocetta, probably meaning a graceful
little bird, etc., etc.

Brent Goose comes from the Welsh, brenig -- a limpet. The
actual word " Bird " was formerly Brid or Bryd, which was derived
from the Anglo-Saxon bredan, to breed. The term, we are told by
Mr. Swann, was properly applicable to the young only, and seems
synonymous with brood. (A. Sax., brod ), the proper term for the
adult bird being fowl. (A. Sax. fugol). According to Poole, brid
still survives in Staffordshire. Several blank pages are provided as
memoranda for additional names for the reader's own notes.

If the members wish me to continue the work of editing our
Magazine, I must ask them to one and all do their best to provide
me with more articles, notes, and photographs. I do the work
gratuitously, and it is by no means light, taking up a great part of
my time ; and I am never idle. I am moving to a new home (in
Herefordshire) in the autumn, which change will find me with little
leisure time. I sent a letter to every member when I first took up
the work, begging for articles and notes on birds, and I may perhaps
he allowed to add, charging nothing for at least 400 stamps. To
have to continually urge members to write is most irksome to me,
and must be (if they pay any attention) most tiresome to them : but
what is still more so to an editor is that he has to pad and write
notes which are simply forced, and therefore cannot be really good.
If members think I have nothing else to do they are very
much mistaken. There are a few who are always helping, and the
thanks of the Society are due to them : but there are surely more
who could write and do not. HUBERT D. ASTLEY.

SIR, --Can you help me to identify two Yellow Weavers? The cock,
which was bought from a dealer as a hen Rufous-necked, is rather larger than
my cock Rufous-neck. The back-wings are greenish yellow, face in front of
eyes, upper part of throat brownish black, remainder of body rich yellow.
The hen is the size of a Grenadier Weaver. Back and wings greenish
yellow as in the cock, face and remainder of body chrome yellow. Neither of
these birds have had a seasonal change of colour.
I am anxious to know the name of these birds as they have mated and
the hen is sitting on eggs.
Thanking you in anticipation. WM. SHORE BAILY.
The following reply has been sent to Mr. Baily : --
The Black and Yellow true Weavers are most difficult to name with
certainty, excepting by comparison with skins in a Museum.
I think it probable that your bird will prove to be the Masked Weaver
(Sitagra monacha ), but it might be S. luteola or Hyphantornis vitellinus.
With these birds having a similar general plan of colouring it is always
most satisfactory to take them to a Natural History Museum for identification.

SIR, --I have just received four specimens of the enclosed African Fruit
Pigeons, but unfortunately the one enclosed died when being sent to me from
the gentleman that hand-reared them and brought them over from West Africa.
The purple patch on the shoulder blade shows much more distinctly in the three

months old. If you can identify them for me I shall esteem it a favour and

Thanking you in anticipation. P. W. THORNILEY.
The following reply has been sent to Mr. Thorniley :--
I make out your bird to be either the female or young of the Bare-faced
Fruit-Pigeon (Vinago calva ) : it answers well to the description of that species
in the Catalogue of Birds in the British Museum, and there seems to be nothing
else that it could be. A. G. BUTLER.

It will be seen that this classification is an encouragement to exhibit com-
paratively common as well as rare birds, and I therefore take the liberty of
asking members of the Society to help to make it possible to hold a really good
and representative show of foreign birds once a year in London by sending as
many entries as they can.
Every care will be taken of exhibits, and special arrangements will be
made with all Railway Companies with reference to their transit.
There is practically no risk in showing birds if they are sent in proper-
show cages, and I should be only too pleased to supply members with any in-
formation they may require with reference to the easiest and cheapest methods
to adopt when sending birds to shows or any other particulars relating thereto.
Only 402 entries are required to make this venture a complete success, and mem-
bers of this Society have in their possession enough material to make an
exhibition which should equal or even outrival anything in the nature of a
flower show, to say nothing of being far more interesting.

As Editor, I should especially wish to draw the attention of the Members
of the Society to the fact that I must put on record my entire disagreement with
Dr. Butler's statements in his article in the June number with regard to the
plume trade in general and Egrets in particular.
My article upon the Lesser Egret, and my footnote on p. 250 with regard
to the enforcing of the Aigrette Law proves this.
I was absent in Italy during April and May, and did not see Dr. Butler's
article until it appeared in the Magazine, as Mr. Seth-Smith had kindly
undertaken some of my work whilst I was abroad.
I am sorry that I must so entirely disagree with Dr. Butler, especially as
he is one of the few members who really works for the benefit of the progress of
the Magazine.
Those who have thoroughly studied the facts, are almost universally

agreed that it is impossible for the agents of the plume-traders to pick up shed
" aigrettes," and that these feathers are undoubtedly plucked from the slaughtered
birds. If moulted plumes can be obtained as Dr. Butler mentions, how is it
that the poor Egrets are becoming exterminated ? Even if it is not necessary to
slaughter them, the fact remains that they are slaughtered, and I consider it a
most abominable and vicious way of obtaining a living. No doubt plenty of
people have earned a living by slave-traffic, opium growing, etc., etc., but are we
to hesitate to put down such things on that account ? Human beings bring
punishments upon themselves, the birds are unable to reason sufficiently to
avert the miserable destiny which, owing to humans, so often awaits them.
Let the plume-traders and milliners employ the people in the factories
and workshops upon artificial plumes, etc.
If the turnover represents more than six millon sterling a year, and more
than 50,000 men and women derive a living through the plume trade, all I can
say is that it is a shameful blot upon humanity's civilized escutcheon, and are
we to countenance such an evil, connected as it is -with intense cruelty to the
birds, because people mustn't suffer, whatever they may do ?
Are we, as aviculturists, who strive to keep a few birds happy in our
aviaries, where they sing and build their nests, and are protected from many
foes ; to encourage indiscriminate and cruel slaughter, instead of doing our
utmost to crush it down ?
I drew attention in a review, to Mr. Hornaday's book, ''Our Vanishing
Wild Life; " and no one after reading that would be anywhere but on the side
of the persecuted and exterminated birds.
Mr. HORNADAY says :--" To offset as far as possible the absolutely true
"charge that Egrets bear their best plumes in the breeding season, when the
" hapless young are in the nest, and the parent birds must be killed to obtain
"their plumes, the feather trade has obtained from three Frenchmen--Leon
" Laglaize, Mayeul Grisol and F. Geay--a beautiful and plausible story to
"the effect that in Venezuela the enormous output of Egret plumes has been
" obtained by picking up, off the bushes and out of the water and mud, the
" shed feathers of those birds! According to the story, Venezuela is full of
" Egret farms, called ' garceros '--where the birds breed and moult under
"strict supervision, and kindly drop their feathers in such places that it is
"possible to find them, and to pick them up, in a high state of preservation !
" and we are asked to believe that it is these very Venezuelan picked up feathers
"that command in London the high price of forty-four dollars per ounce !
" Mr. Laglaize is especially exploited by Mr. Downham, as a French
"traveller of high standing, and well-known in the Zoological Museums of
"France ; but, sad to say, when Professor Henry Fairfield Osborn cabled to the
t( Museum of Natural History in Paris, inquiring about Laglaize, the cable
"flashed back the one significant word: ' ' Inconnu ! ' ' (Unknown!)

Mr. Hornaday proceeds to quote a letter to him by Mr. E. H. Mcllhennv

Hubert D. Astley, Editor.
AN ANSWER.--By LORD WILLIAM PERCY.
SIR,--In the June number of the Avicultural Magazine an article appeared,
entitled "For Love of Science," from the pen of Dr. Butler, which was read by
more than one member with some astonishment.
It consisted of a lamentation on the evil effects of Bird Protection in
general, and its baneful influence on the activities of collectors and aviculturists
in particular, and he goes out of his way to say a word in defence of the plumage
hunter and the egg collector, and asks us to regard them as victims of the mis-
placed zeal of the bird protectionist.
Some of the arguments with which this article was fortified were novel.
Let us take a few samples.
From it we learn that Egret plumes are not, as we supposed, taken from
the body of freshly-killed birds, but are (in Venezuela) invariably gathered as
moulted plumes lying thickly on the bushes and at the foot of the trees near the
lagunos where these birds breed. Such travesties of the truth may be good
enough to pass muster with, and salve the conscience of the fair lady who buys
the plumes, but it is a little surprising to find such nonsense quoted by Dr.
Butler. Never having been in Venezuela I cannot contradict the statement from
</bodyText>

Correspondence.

<bodyText confidence="0.998498113636364" page_id="32655189"  page_num="Page 279" year="" vol="">
personal knowledge, but if it is suggested that the gathering of moulted plumes
is the custom of the plume hunter in other parts of the world, I can assure him
from personal knowledge that that is a delusion and a lie. In a district with
which I am acquainted, and from which large quantities of Egret plumes are ex-
ported, every single plume is plucked from freshly-shot birds. But in those
countries (unlike Venezuela apparently) Egrets do not moult their plumes in a
condition in which they could be of any conceivable use for the adornment of
hats.
Again, though no allusion is made by him to the ravages of the bird and
egg collector as a factor in the extermination of British species, we find that the
blame for the serious diminution of ' ' one or two species ' ' is accounted for by the
"well-known fact that farmers and others " have so persecuted them " that they
have been well-nigh exterminated." And yet memory fails to recall one single
species, in this country at any rate, whose disappearance has been brought about
by farmers, or in the agricultural interest.
We are treated, too, to such logic as the following. A collector in 1872
took 42 eggs from one Wryneck's nest, " which proved at least that the removal
of a single sitting could have no injurious effect upon such fertile creatures as
birds " !
Finallv, in conclusion, we are warned that unless we take the place and
do the duty of the birds of prey who formerly " broke up bird families to a
certain extent, the protection afforded to these favoured species, rendered
" immune from man's action," will assuredly result in the final extinction of
these species through inbreeding.
This latter argument requires no comment, but it is so laughable that one
is tempted to believe that he is indulging his sense of humour at the expense of
his readers.
There are probably few of us who will be found to disagree with Dr.
Butler that the regulations of the Wild Birds Protection Act leave much to be
desired, and fewer still of us who are collectors in any shape or form, wlro are
not continually hampered and irritated by the lack of discrimination--and often
the folly--of the provisions of the Act; but futile lamentations on the part of
the provisions of the collector, or for the matter of that on the part of the
protectionist, are not very helpful contributions to the attainment of a better
regulated system of protection--and for this reason.
The subject of bird protection is approached, both by the protectionist and
the collector, solely from the point of view of the aims and aspirations of each,
and neither the one nor the other claims the sympathy of the mass of the public.
On the one hand, we have articles from the hand of the humanitarian
bird protectionist, of the ill-informed and always narrow-minded. He would
desire to see all birds allowed to increase unchecked, regardless of the interests
alike of the agriculturist and the game preserver, and of any other interest that
clashes with his views.
On the other hand, we have the equally selfish complaints of the collector,

that his personal research--which is not seldom another name for a desire to
accumulate an infinite number of eggs or skins--is interfered with by a badly
regulated and senseless method of protection. There is a family likeness in his
complaints, they usually include a plea for "the poor wild-fowler,'' or the
" industrious birdcatcher," but the real burden of his complaint is that it is
HIS aviary that cannot be filled without paying ' exorbitant prices,' or that HIS
cabinet of skins and eggs requires more specimens. Unfortunately the collector
has a bad reputation, and not a few deserve that reputation only too well.
But, curiously enough, there is one attribute which the advocates of
protection and the collectors possess in common, and they are never tired of
proclaiming in glowing language the intensity of their " Love of Science."
Love of a cause is commonly gauged by the extent of sacrifice of personal
aims that the lover is willing to make for the sake of the cause, and yet we
search the writings of these protagonists in vain for any indication of the
slightest willingness to subordinate their personal interests.
The Protection of Wild Birds in a thickly populated and highly developed
country such as ours is admittedly an extremely difficult problem, and must
depend largely upon the good will of the population. The economic value and
importance of agricultural and sporting interests is sufficient guarantee that,
even assuming the realization of the aspirations of the fanatical bird protectionist
were desirable, they are utterly and hopelessly beyond his powers to attain.
The unchecked increase of the Peregrine and the Golden Eagle is as in-
compatible with the preservation of a grouse moor, as is the indefinite increase
of the Bullfinch and the Hawfinch with the interests of the market gardener.
The only effect of advocating wholesale and unsystematic protection is to
alienate the sympathy of a large body of public opinion: it is the very length of
the list of protected birds (many of them in no want of protection) in the
schedules of some Counties, that renders the Wild Birds Protection Act in some
districts almost a dead letter, owing to the hopeless impossibility of enforcing
its regulations. If the protectionist would confine his efforts to the protection of
all species in such numbers as not to conflict with interests that must be con-
sidered, and at least in sufficient numbers as to adequately guarantee their
continued existence on breeding species, he would find himself supported by
every lover of birds in Great Britain, and at the same time do away with a
considerable amount of the opposition he now encounters.
That there is still room for every British species to exist and continue to
exist, there can be no room for doubt; and this is true of even the most des-
tructive and predatory birds. But it is just here that the crux of the question
arises, and the crux of the question is the collector. There are collectors, and
collectors, but for the type of collector with which we are now concerned, no
genuine lover of birds has anything but the bitterest condemnation.
To this type of collector the value of a British taken egg is exactly the
measure of the rarity of the bird that laid it, and it is largely to these gentle-

men that we owe the present state of affairs, and the necessity for regulations
which in their working hamper the pursuit of genuine research.
In justification of that proposition, let us consider for a moment the
genesis of the Wild Birds Protection Acts. The indignation of the British
public, which resulted in the agitation for the protection of wild birds was first
brought about by two things : (1) the wanton slaughter of sea birds at the breed-
ing stations in the interests of the plumage market, and (2) the no less reckless
and senseless extermination of some of the finest British species by the egg
collectors ; the former done with the open object of commercial gain ; the latter
perpetrated ostensibly in the guise of a 1 Love of Science,' in fact for no better
reason than the collector's own personal gratification. The plumage hunter
was easily dealt with ; the nature of his work compelled him to work openly ;
and the Wild Birds Protection Act put a stop to the wholesale slaughter of sea
birds. Not so with the collector ; he works silently, and sometimes by singu-
larly underhand methods, and continues to do an infinity of harm, always be it
remembered, in the name of a ' Love of Science.' A love of science so genuine
and intelligent that the last clutch of British taken Osprey eggs is of infinitely
more value in his eyes than an exactly similar clutch taken on the Continent.
As a result it has come to this, that there are some thirteen British breeding
species that bred regularly with us up to recent years, that are at this moment
either non-existent as breeding species or are hanging on in diminishing numbers
too small to guarantee the continued existence of the species.
In this state of things the collector is solely to blame. It is true that in
the case of many of them, modern conditions, draining, and the value of sport-
ing rights, etc. had already rendered it impossible that they should continue in
their former number, but their continued existence in reduced numbers was, and
is, not only possible but certain, if they could only be protected from the
intolerable lust of the egg collector. In such species, the last lingering hope rests
with the public spirited efforts of individual landowners and others who, at no
small expense to themselves, are engaged in the endeavour to retain some of
the finest British birds on the active list. All honour to them, and every lover
of birds in Great Britain gives them unstinted gratitude.
It is nothing short of a disgrace that these efforts are not better re-
warded, and in some cases are totally wanting in results. The Kite has been
saved in the nick of time, though the attentions of the collector have gone forth
to rob us of the full possibilities resulting from their protection, while the efforts
of gentlemen who have undertaken the protection of the few remaining nests of
Montagu's Harrier hen have been almost entirely without success.
In others it is even now too late, and one of the most magnificent sights
in the whole of bird life, that of a wild Osprey fishing, is no longer to be seen in
these islands, while the empty eyries of the sea Eagle and the Osprey stand as
recent monuments to this sickening travesty of a love of Science.
It is small wonder that those, and they are many, to whom Nature is

something more than a playground for the collector, and who hold, and unjustly
hold, that genuine scientific research has never yet demanded the extinction of a
single species, regard the collector with the bitterest feelings of distrust.
With such standing examples of his work, is it wonderful that the dog
gets a bad name, that the very word collector has become a byword for merciless
and wanton destruction, and that the public have some difficulty in discrimina-
ting between the genuine student of Natural History who is honestly trying to
work out some problem, and the egg-snatcliing, bird-mongering hypocrite who
talks of a Love of Science ?
Who can wonder that those who derive perhaps the keenest enjoyment in
life from association with the wild birds of this country, and who are often far
better naturalists than some collectors who possess large museums crammed
with dry skins and empty egg shells, sometimes overstep the limits of moderation
in their frantic desire to prevent any more species being reduced to that degree
of rarity at which they become the special subjects of the greed of the collector.
They know only too well, that for every collection of eggs made with the object
of making any serious contribution to the study of Oology, there are scores
which have no object at all, unless the accumulation of an indefinite number of
clutches of some rare birds eggs, of which the proud possessor can boast that
" he has taken them all himself in the British Isles " can be called an object.
They know too, from bitter experience, that there is a type of egg collector
whose greed for eggs has so far got the better of his sense of honour that he does
not scruple to abuse the hospitality of landowners when granted leave to " come
and see the birds breeding on the ground," nor hesitate to attempt to induce his
employees to break faith with their master by offering large bribes to them for
allowing eggs to be removed, which he knows full well are the special object of
his host's protection.
It may be too much to hope that in the near future the protection of wild
birds should be entrusted to a central committee--not of politicians--but of
ornithological experts, empowered to grant licence to properly accredited persons
to obtain the necessary specimens for genuine study, and who would be in a
position to discriminate in the choice of individuals to whom such license was
granted. Surely it is not too much to hope that a step in the right direction
should be made, and that certain Ornithological Associations should show in a
rather more rigorous fashion their disapproval of acts of useless destruction, and
their determination to exclude from membership such as are guilty of them.
It is only too common to hear members of such associations condemning,
in private, in the bitterest language, the performances of fellow members, while,
when the opportunity occurs of expressing their disapproval in public, fear of
unpopularity leads them to remain in silence. WILLIAM PERCY.

" He deplores the restrictions placed by the modern bird protection regulations

" of immoderate hostility towards the domestic cat--a very estimable beast with
"many supporters !--though not good for birds, I admit. Then his remarks on
"the feather trade are doubtful in facts and do not harmonize at all with your's

SlB,--From Dr. Butler's article, Love of Science does not seem compati-
ble with Love of Birds to say the least, and it would be a great pity if many
adopted the views enumerated by him.
Indiscriminate taking of clutches of scarcer and rarer birds' eggs can
only lead to extinction of that species in England, and prevention of any of the
species of birds once common in this country being re-established.
The egg collector, who takes clutch after clutch, to show some slight
difference in colouration or marking, is clearly diminishing the breed.
Wholesale "scientific research" only equals wholesale scientific destruc-
tion. The fact that the owner of the estate where certain rare birds breed, may
desire to retain them (and is willing to run the risk of " inbreeding of brothers
and sisters") does not appear to come in for consideration.
Man may possibly not succeed greatly by attempting to assist nature ! he
succeeds admirably though when he attempts to wipe out nature.
With regard to Egret plumes, it may not be necessary to kill the bird, but
I have little doubt which method is quickest and generally adopted by the plume
hunter, and I do not think it will be that of gathering up stray moulted half-
broken feathers ! Let us hope the Egret appreciates protection. R.
Le Clienil in a leading article " Pour et contre les Oiseaux," criticizes Dr.
Butler's views, and makes the following remarks with regard to the ' aigrettes.'
Mais la ou le Dr. Butler est inexcusable c'est lorsque lui, naturaliste,
accepte les grossiers mensonges de la plumasserie, a savoir que les crosses
d'aigrettes sont ramassees par les sauvages dans les marais apres la mue et, aux
nombreux temoignages des voyageurs impartiaux qui out assiste aux massacres
de ces echassiers pendant l'incubation, qui ont vu l'agonie des milliers de jeunes

Mr. WILLIAM T. HORNADAY, SC. D., writes in June, from New York,
the following: --
DEAR Mr. ASTLEY, --Our measure in the new Tariff Bill, to absolutely prohibit
the importation of all wild birds' plumage for millinery purposes, went swim-
mingly through the House of Representatives, and passed before the milliners
had a chance to train their guns upon it. You never saw a lot of feather dealers
so completely surprised and chagrined as they were. That they were caught
napping, was not our fault; but they feel very sore, just the same. Now they
have hired distinguished lawyers, and set them to work in the Senate to defeat
our clause. Naturally, we are fighting for our own, and whenever we see a
head, we hit it! The good and the sensible women of the country have become
thoroughly aroused regarding this matter, and are flooding members of the
Senate with letters demanding the passage of our clause exactly as it stands.
But this is not a quarter of what they will do provided it developes that there
is any danger that our clause is likely to be stricken out.
I am so busy with this campaign that I scarcely know which way to turn,
and my desk is piled high with neglected correspondence. Some day I may be
able to write something for the Avicultural Magazine : but at present I have no
thoughts for anything other than the war with the feather trade.

Mr. Astley has a pair of Ixula flavicollis. They came from Major
Horsbrugh's Indian Collection, and, although not brightly coloured, in fact more
after the hues of a White-throat (except for the broad band of yellowish chestnut
at the back of the neck), are very pretty and graceful, with the movements and
demeanour of the Blue-winged Siva. Their most noticeable adornment is a
full crest, which can be raised over the head, with the tips of the feathers
inclined to an outward curve. They come from the Himalayas.
Major Perreau also imported three specimens this year.

The Green-breasted Pitta, which Mr. Astley purchased from Major

it enjoys hopping under a group of bamboos and bathing in a pool of running

from the fingers. The Pittas have a fascinating way of quivering their extremely
short tails, after the manner of a Redstart.

FEEDING WILD BIRDS ON QUAKER OATS.

<bodyText confidence="0.994259095238095" page_id="32655197"  page_num="Page 287" year="" vol="">
A lady who for some years lived in a small house hidden away between
wooded hills in Herefordshire, had regularly fed the wild birds from her drawing
room window with dried Flake oats. I visited this house for the first time last
February, and a prettier sight I never saw. As soon as the sash window was
pushed up there was a frou-frou of innumerable wings, and down fluttered
Chaffinches, Great and Blue Tits, Robins and Greenfinches, Hedge Accentors,
whilst almost immediately the more sedate Blackbirds and Thrushes came
hopping from the bushes near at hand.
All the birds know (for they are still fed) the exact hours when the flake
oats will be thrown to them ; morning, noon and evening.
What struck me so much was the intense blue of the Blue Tits as they
flew down just under the window for flakes, as well as the magnificent colouring
of the Chaffinches. They certainly looked more brilliant than usual. Mr.
Headley, of Haileybury College, the brother of the lady mentioned, writes to
me--' ' I fear I cannot give an elaborate account of the birds my sister used to
" feed. On the 16th of January, she wrote that there was a hard frost and snow,
" the birds frantic for food. Many big and impudent Blackbirds, one bulky hen
" continually fighting a cock bird. [She must have been a militant suffragette,
"for she often had the best of it in a tussle!] One Thrush much scared,
" attracted into a quiet corner where it put away 110 flake oats."
The lady bountiful also wrote-- 1 ' Blackbirds are bold and impudent :

EGYPTIAN PIED CHAT.

<bodyText confidence="0.935949333333333" page_id="32655197"  page_num="Page 287" year="" vol="">
SIR,--I think the name used for the Egyptian Pied Chat, illustrated and
described in Mr. Astley's article in the May number of the Magazine (p. 199)
should have been Saxicola lugens, and not S. leucomelcena *
The bird was named lugens by Lichtenstein in 1823. The name leu-
comelcena was given by Burchell in his " Travels in South Africa " in 1822 to
the Chat which had already been named monticola by Vieillot in 1818--a bird
only inhabiting South Africa.
Besides being a synonym of a different bird, leucomelcena has the dis-
advantage of being confusingly like leucomela, the name which Dresser used
for Saxicola lugens in "The Birds of Europe," but which seems to have been
given by Pallas in 1770 to another Black-throated Chat, which again had already
been named Motacilla pleschanka by Lepechin in the same year.

GOULDIAN FINCHES.

<bodyText confidence="0.998476058823529" page_id="32655198"  page_num="Page 288" year="" vol="">
SIR,--Will you kindly tell me if Gouldian Finches would live in a warmly
situated outdoor aviary here during the winter, and would the cold be too great ?
Which are the hardier, Red-faced or Black-faced, and how can you distin-
guish cocks from hens ? A. A. THOM.
The following reply has been sent to Mr. Thom :--\0x25A0
My experience of Gouldian Finches is that the Black and Red-headed
phases are equally hardy. I left my own birds in an outdoor aviary for some
weeks after the commencement of sharp frosts : their bath-water was frozen over
every morning and, after I had smashed the surface ice with a hammer, the
Gouldian-finches immediately jumped into the ice-cold water and bathed with
the greatest pleasure.
Cocks can be told at a glance from hens (apart from other differences) by
the purplish ultramarine breast-belt; in the hen this belt is dull rosy lilac. I
still have one cock red-head living of the pair which I bred in 1905 ; it is there-
fore nearly eight years old, but quite active and healthy.
If your aviary has a covered portion I should think it safe to winter
Gouldian-finches in it. A. G. BUTLER.

BIRD - WATCHING IN FLORIDA.

A pleasant picture of Bird-watcliing comes from Tampa, in Florida. Mr.
JAMES Shaw, an octogenarian correspondent, writes
' 1 1 have many friends among the birds, principally Blue Jays, Mocking-
birds, a small bird I call a Wren, several kinds of Woodpeckers, Mourning Doves,
Humming Birds, and occasionally Butcher-birds. Opposite my house a small
stream, known as Spanish Town Creek, flows down to the bay, and is a favourite
resort for my feathered friends ... I am principally attracted by the Mocking-
bird--such a cheerful, happy, companionable bird--a live oak close to our porch
is a favourite spot; no false modesty about him ! Many times he will come
down where I can almost touch him, and thrill me with his matchless song.
His dropping song when approaching his mate is wonderful. He sings the first
stanza in a low dreamy voice, and then as if the sweetness of his love exalted
him, he lifts his voice higher and higher until the air rings with its melody.
His mate twitters an answer. His response comes like the notes of a silver
trumpet. He springs up into the air and slowly drops singing, alighting on a
twig above his mate, and beginning to fall from branch to branch, but singing
more softly and sweetly as he approaches her.
I have seen this many times as I sit in my porch."

SOME OF MY SUNBIRDS.
By Alfred Ezra.
THE AMETHYST BUMPED SUNBIBD.
Arachnecthra zeylonica.
My first experience of this beautiful bird was two years ago,
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.995123318181818" page_id="32655207"  page_num="Page 289" year="" vol="">
when I received six, sent by my brother from India. Four of
them were cocks in colour, and the other two looked like hens.
They arrived in very good condition and I only kept two of these.
One in colour, and the other because he was a beautifully shaped
bird. The latter turned out my best, and was evidently a young
cock, as after two months he moulted out a splendid bird and such
a lovely colour! This bird I have shown three times and he has
never been beaten. Both my Amethysts are just going through
their third moult and look as healthy as ever, and so happy. They
have quite a pretty song and make charming pets. The two are
very much alike in their ways, with this exception, that the best
bird goes to bed very early as soon as it gets dark, and will not
move or feed even with the electric lights on, whereas the other is
always jumping about and feeding, and will only retire when the
lights are put out. At the show last winter I had to put my hand
into the cage and wake the former several times to feed.
All my Sunbirds are fed on Mellin's, Nestle's, and honey,
and sometimes I make a change and give them Horlick's Malted
Milk instead of Nestle's. The proportions are--a heaped-up tea-
spoonful of each ingredient in a breakfast-cup of boiling water.
They all eat grapes and tiny green flies, but the two Amethysts
have a much larger menu. They will eat, besides the above, lettuce,

spiders, fresh wasp grubs, live ants' eggs, and the thing they love
most of all is a small caterpillar. They will eat as many as half-a-
dozen straight off&apos; and take them from my fingers. The other
varieties I have, are new arrivals and will not eat anything so far,
except the syrup, grapes, and green flies. I think they only take to
eating a variety of things after they have been kept for some time. A
bath they all look forward to and have one every morning, summer
and winter. They do best in a bright room where the temperature
does not vary much, and about 60 degrees is quite warm enough.
THE BLACK BREASTED YELLOW BACKED SUNBIRD.
A. saturata.
This bird is the only one of his kind in the country, having
been lately imported by Mr. Frost, and is a perfect pet, being so tame
and gentle in his ways. He is smaller than the Amethyst, but has
a longer tail. In colour he is black, though the back is a maroon
red. Crown of head and a narrow stripe down each side of the
throat a brilliant metallic violet-blue with a steel blue tail and a
yellow patch on the lower back. Very dainty in his ways and
movements; in fact he seems more refined, if I may use this
expression, than all the other Sunbirds. v

By Hubert D. Astley.
For some years I have kept in a large flight aviary two pairs
of the Australian Straw-necked Ibis (I. spinicollis) and three years
ago I turned in a Black-headed White Indian Ibis, near akin to the
Sacred Ibis, which was at the time an immature bird. In the
summer of 1911 one pair of the Straw-necks nested, but just as
the three eggs which were laid were about to hatch, owing to the
bickering and squabbling which went on between the nesting pair
and the pair which had not taken upon themselves the cares of a
family, the eggs were rolled out and broken, shewing young almost
fully developed.
In 1912 nothing happened, but this summer two pairs have

on the Mating of two Species of Ibis. 291
built nests, laid eggs, and quietly incubated side by side. But one
pair has, or ought to have been through the Divorce Court, for a
female Straw-neck has deserted her husband and " flown " away with
the Black-headed White Ibis, who turns out to be of the male sex.
The two nests were constructed on the top of a diminutive
willow tree, on which had been wired a large flat basket-lid. The
Australian Straw-necks were the first to commence, in May, and
their nest was not more than three or four inches high, composed of
sticks and rushes. Two eggs only were laid, and never hatched.
But the second pair--the fly-away couple!--built their nest so
that it touched the other, but topped it by several inches, in fact they
were evidently bent on going one better in every way, for not only
were three eggs laid instead of two, but the three hatched, where
the two did not, proving that the course of true love does not
always run smoothly.
The young hybrid Ibises were, I think, hatched on the 25th
of June ; but alas ! were found dead on the 2nd of July. They
were lying on the edges of the nest, and may have been kicked out
by the other Ibises, or perhaps hauled out by one of the little South
American Whistling Herons (Syrigma cyanocephalum), which are
decidedly meddlesome.
The parents were most diligent in their care of them, both
sexes taking their regular turns in brooding and feeding them, as they
likewise did in incubating the eggs. At a regular hour in the after-
noon, I have seen the male Indian White Ibis fly to the nest, grunt-
ing until the female Straw-neck rose up, when he would at once sit
down in her place.
The young Ibises had thick black down on their heads and
necks, where in both parents there is naked black skin. Their bills
were about an inch long, with the very slightest tendency to a curve
towards the tip ; otherwise the bodies were, when examined, too
decomposed to record many details.
In feeding them, the parents regurgitated their food, putting
the tips of their bills into the nestling's mouths.
As usual, one regrets that one had not given the breeding
birds a place to themselves, in which case, as far as I could foresee,
the young would have been successfully reared.

PARRAKEETS.
By The Marquis of Tavistock.
When the Editor first began to represent to me that it was
the duty of all good members of the Avicultural Society in general,
and of myself in particular, to contribute articles to the Magazine, I
told him that on the occasion of my first appearance in print I
wished to describe either a successful acclimatization experiment, or
else the breeding of some rare bird for the first time in this country ;
there might then be some chance of my article containing at least
one fact of novelty or interest. But success, as a rule, comes slower
than disaster, and the nesting operations of most members of the
parrot family--to which my own avicultural efforts have been
mainly confined--are peculiarly lengthy : also the exhortations of
the Editor, like the command of Nebuchadnezzar the King, wax
very urgent, so I have had to put my pride in my pocket and write
my experiences of a species which, unfortunately, is not to be
numbered among my successes.
The Australian King Parrakeet (Aprosmictus cyanopijgius),
although not very freely imported, especially in recent years, is
nevertheless too well known to need much description. It is a
large bird, nearly twice the size of a Kosella, with a long and rather
broad tail. The adult cock has the head, neck, and breast scarlet,
or scarlet tinged with crimson : the rump bluish black, and most of
the remainder of the plumage a uniform green. Across the wing
coverts runs a narrow band of pale verdigris which is often nearly
concealed by overlapping feathers of the prevailing darker tint, but
which can be very conspicuous if the wing is held at a particular
angle. On the nape of the neck is usually a patch of dark metallic
blue, the size of which varies greatly in different individuals, pro-
bably according to the locality from which they come ; some have
hardly any blue at all.
The hen has no blue spot on the nape, and has the head,
neck, and upper breast green, and she usually, if not invariably,
lacks the verdigris bar on the wing coverts. In other respects her
plumage resembles that of the male. Young birds in immature

plumage are like their mothers, but are said to have the tips of the
tail-feathers pink. I am very much inclined to think that the young
cocks can be distinguished from the hens by the verdigris wing bar
above mentioned, which they certainly possess at a very early stage,
if not actually at the time they leave the nest. Whether the young
females also possess these light green feathers or not I cannot
absolutely say, but I should consider it most unlikely that they do.
In build, the King Parrakeet bears a close resemblance to the
Crimson-wing, and also to the magnificent members of the genus
Pyrrhulopsis, which are unfortunately so rarely imported. It has
little affinity to the Platycerci, either in form or manners, and it is
difficult to understand why the old writer Greene desired to place it
among them. The tail is long and broad it is true, but it is quite
different in shape from that of the Kosella and its allies: and
although the bird can and does spread it at times, it is quite unable
to shake it in the manner so characteristic of nearly all the Platy-
cercines. In fact the King resembles the latter in one respect only,
viz., in its voice, the whistling call-note and sharper screaming cry
uttered when the bird takes wing, both reminding one considerably
of the notes of some members of the broadtail family.
The first King Parrakeet I remember seeing was kept as a
cage-bird in our house about eighteen yeai's ago and was ultimately
given away to a friend in Scotland. He was reasonably tame, but
not a particularly interesting pet (none of the larger Australian
parrakeets are really suited to cage-life, i.e. they do not show to
advantage in close confinement), and the whistling of "Pop goes
the weasel " was I believe his only accomplishment. He ultimately
died of sunstroke.
The next King, whose acquaintance I made, has had a more
varied and interesting career; also, unlike too many of his relations
I shall soon refer to, he is still alive and well. He came into my
possession during the summer of 1911, and on arrival was turned
into a large grass enclosure with a cut wing, together with a number
of other Australian parrakeets which I intended for an experiment
in acclimatization. By the time that the autumn moult had restored
his powers of flight he had become accustomed to his surroundings,
and for a while showed little disposition to stray from the garden.

The Marquis op Tavistock,
Having no companions of his own kind he was obliged to content
himself with the society of some Pennants, and when they and he
were on the wing together it was interesting to notice how greatly
they differed in their method of flight, the former moving in the long
undulating sweeps characteristic of their family, and the latter pro-
pelling himself in a straight dove-like manner with sharp and regular
strokes. The speed of both appeared to be about equal.
But the Pennants were after all only a makeshift, and in
February,--when the good food and exercise which his free life gave
him were rapidly bringing him into breeding condition -- the King's
plaintive call-note, one short and one long whistle, sounded more
and more insistently until the day came when we missed him from
the feeding trays, and it became only too evident that he had gone
off on a hopeless quest in search of a mate.
Subsequent experience has taught me that I could not under
the circumstances have expected anything else. An unmated bird
of the parrot family, unless it be tame and attached to its owner,
will, in nine cases out of ten, stray away as soon as the breeding
impulse asserts itself, should it have the chance of doing so, and its
fate is usually speedy and untimely. On this occasion, however, I
was more fortunate than usual. About two days after the King's
disappearance, we were out shooting at a place about four miles
from home, when my eye was attracted by a brilliant patch of
colour in a bare thorn edge, and there sure enough sat the missing
bird, looking somewhat disconsolate after forty-eight hours of semi-
starvation--for Kings, like Cockatiels and Redrumps and unlike the
typical Platycerci, have little capacity for living in the country and
fending for themselves during the winter months. I at once sent
for a feeding&apos;-tray (the feeding-trays for the birds at liberty are so
constructed as to be convertible at a moment's notice into a kind of
box trap, by the pulling of a cord attached to one end) and in a very
few minutes after its arrival he was safely taken.
A few days previous to the King's departure, I had with some
difficulty obtained two hens -- one apparently a fairly good bird, the
other with something the matter with her wings which interfered
considerably with her powers of flight. In order to restrain him
from further wanderings, I shut up the King in an indoor aviary, in

company with the best hen, intending to set the pair at liberty when
the warmer weather returned. But this unhappily was not to be,
for a few weeks later the Queen sickened and died of a disease of
the liver, possibly brought on by a too liberal indulgence in hemp-
seed, and the hen with the stiff wings had therefore to take her
place. In April, the pair went out together as I hoped to stay and
perhaps to nest--but not a bit of it! The Queen's flight in the
aviary had been clumsy and erratic, but outside she got on only too
well, and without a day's hesitation she went straight off to the
extreme limits of the Park, taking her mate with her. Two days
later she was picked up exhausted and returned to me, and not
long afterwards the cock was captured in a farmer's poultry-yard.
So ended the second chapter.
Having no proper aviary accommodation for the recalcitrant
pair, I was obliged to cut their wings, hoping that by the autumn
the hen would have become better used to her surroundings and
more accommodating in her behaviour.
That summer I obtained five more Kings--three young im-
ported cocks and a splendid pair of adults-- acclimatized and in
perfect condition. With this stock I looked upon the establishment
of a flock of Kings as merely a question of time. But, alas ! " The
best laid schemes of mice and men gang aft ag&apos;ley," and on this
occasion my hopes were to be disappointed with a vengeance!
About the middle of July my collection was swept by the scourge
of septic fever, introduced I believe, in the first instance, by a
newlv-imported Crimson-wing I had rashly omitted to quarantine.
Septic fever is often regarded as a disease which can only flourish
in dirty cages and stuffy rooms : that it originates in such places is
beyond doubt, but I learnt to my cost that it can be disseminated far
and wide in the open air and among the cleanest surroundings. Not
only did the outdoor aviary birds die, hut many of those at complete
liberty, which came occasionally to feed in the enclosures where
their cut-winged relatives were kept. I did all I could and attempted
to save the apparently healthy, by moving them from the infected
ground, only to find that I had taken them in hand too late and
had merely succeeded in spreading the disease still further. When
the epidemic appeared to have run its course I had only one

The Marquis of Tavistock,
King left--the old cock--all the rest had succumbed ! Kings, like
Crimson-wings, Blue-bonnets, and the little Parrakeets of the genus
Neophema have not, even when in the most perfect health and
vigour, the very slightest power of resisting fever infection ; the true
Platycerci withstand it better (Port Lincolns and Pennants are the
most susceptible), and it was fortunate for me that they do, for other-
wise I do not believe I should have had a single parrakeet left. Even
as things were, however, my losses were sufficiently grievous, and
for a long time Kings remained a very painful reminiscence. However,
time may bring consolation, and when, in the late autumn, a pair of
Kings was offered for sale at the disposal of M. Pauwels' splendid
collection, I determined to have another try with them and attempt
to repair my shattered fortunes. When the birds arrived, I found
the cock as perfect as I could desire, but the hen rather disappointed
me as she looked decidedly ' thick,' and I entertained grave doubts
as to the soundness of her internal economy and particularly of her
liver. However, she did better than I expected, improving steadily
and looking quite another bird after a few weeks had passed. About
the time of the arrival of the pair from Belgium, two more Kings
reached me--a fine cock and a rather moderate hen who had lost
the ends of some of her toes.
The former, together with the other male bird, I turned out
with cut wings into a large glass quadrangle in the centre of the
house, where they did admirably and still continue in the finest
condition. Turning out to grass with cut wings is I find an ex-
cellent way of keeping many of the larger and hardier members of
the parrot family. A pair of Eoseate Cockatoos treated in this way
have nested and reared their young, although the cock was a newly-
imported bird and by no means tame. Cockatiels have twice laid
eggs, which accidents prevented them from incubating, and many
Platycercine parrakeets of different species have lived under similar
conditions for several months in the best of health, and with a little
encouragement would, I believe, have nested successfully. Small
and delicate species, like the members of the Neophema family, do
not thrive so well under this treatment, and there is great risk of
enteritis when the removal of the flight feathers leaves the side
exposed to the cold. The two Queens I kept together for some

weeks in a large outdoor cage and finally decided to reserve the one
from Belgium as a mate for the old King, and to put the other with
the cut-winged couple above mentioned. As I had often heard that
Kings are absolutely indifferent to cold, I did not anticipate that
she would thrive any less well than the two male birds, but it soon
became evident that the treatment did not agree with her; for,
although the weather was mild, she looked so obviously cold and
unhappy that I foresaw her speedy demise if I persisted in the open-
air treatment. I therefore caught her again and put her in a cage
in a warm room, where she spent the remainder of the winter in
good health. It is evident that Kings are only indifferent to cold
when in really good plumage and condition, and it is unwise to turn
them out of doors when newly-imported, unless the weather be really
warm. There are, in fact, very few parrots able to withstand such
Spartan treatment; Blue-bonnets can, and probably Quakers and
Cockateels, and perhaps some Macaws ; the rest must have heat,
which after all is only natural when one considers the high tem-
perature to which most are accustomed in their native haunts. All
this time the old King--the sole survivor of the fever outbreak--had
been leading a life of unfettered freedom. He spent most of his
time in the company of some Port Lincolns, with whom he some-
times made expeditions of several miles, always, however, returning
to roost. When February came round, the Queen from Belgium,
now looking very well indeed, started calling persistently in her cage
until she attracted the attention of her intended mate. He was
much delighted at discovering her, visiting her constantly and per-
forming various antics for her benefit.
The courtship of Aprosmictus cyanopygius is quite unlike that
of most other Australian parrakeets and is very amusing to watch.
The cock indulges in aimless hops and rushes in the immediate
vicinity of the object of his affections, picking up bits of leaf or
grass and throwing them about. Occasionally he sits down in front
of the hen and moves his wings up and down a few times, and at
frequent intervals stops and scratches his head violently as if he
had forgotten something he wanted to say. The whole time the
display is going on, the pupils of the eyes keep contracting and

The Marquis of Tavistock,
expanding with excitement, and the plumage is drawn close to the
body and never puffed out as in the case of a courting Broadtail.
After the King had been paying his addresses for several days
and the lady had begun to show evident signs of appreciation, I
thought that the time had come to release her, which I accordingly
did, but not without considerable anxiety, for I feared she would
repeat the wandering tactics of her predecessor. For two days,
however, all went welt. The pair were as happy as possible and
the Queen showed no inclination to go off on her own account, but
was content to follow her mate and let him show her the way about.
But my ill-luck was not yet ended, and just when I was beginning
to conjure up roseate visions of a nest of young Kings, the third day
dawned--and no Queen ! Her mate returned to the empty cage
she had once occupied and called long and disconsolately, and I
came to the conclusion that she must have wandered away and got
lost or had met with some accident. A few hours later, however, I
saw her on one of the feeding trays, but not, alas! the strong,
healthy bird of the day before, but a sickly, miserable object. I
caught her at once and put her in a warm room, imagining that she
had caught a chill. In two days she was dead, and the post mortem
revealed to my astonishment and disgust, not enteritis as I expected,
but my old enemy septic fever ! Apparently the wretched disease
was still lurking in the garden, though for six months there had
been no fresh case, and no new birds had been turned out to re-
introduce the infection. The widowed King, after much fruitless
calling, resigned himself once more to the unsatisfactory company of
Platycercines, and some weeks after the death of his mate, astonished
me by a most unexpected and talented display of mimicry. I
happened to have bought a new hen Pennant, whose appearance
made a favourable impression on the King, for I found him one day
sitting on the top of the aviary indulging in his courting antics and
calls. The Pennant, however, unused to such peculiar methods of
wooing, remained unresponsive, and her suitor, apparently thinking
that something more was required of him, suddenly began, to my
great astonishment, to imitate with extraordinary accuracy the
crooning and cackling of a flock of domestic poultry. How he had
managed to acquire this accomplishment--for it certainly is acquired

and is not natural--I cannot say, nor do I know why he considered
that the small-talk of fowls was an appropriate medium for express-
ing his devotion. He may perhaps have said to himself, lt I have
spent at least twenty minutes in addressing this lady with all the
endearing epithets my language contains and she won't pay the
least attention. Possibly she does not understand what I am saying,
I will therefore talk to her in the language of the birds of the
country and see if that will make any impression upon her ! " I
have only once heard him going through his chicken performance
since and, as on the first occasion, he used it as the final argument
in a proposal of marriage. When the warm weather returned I
again put the Queen with the cut-winged birds in the quadrangle
and this time she did well enough. Her appearance caused great
excitement and the three cocks spent most of the day displaying
before her, biting her mildly from time to time to revive her interest,
whenever they thought that she was allowing her attention to
wander from their proceedings. The old cock, curiously enough,
was driven away by both the cut-winged birds--whom one would
have thought he could easily have mastered--and was obliged to
keep at a respectful distance. Still he remained in the vicinity of
the hen and, probably on account of her presence, underwent a
great change of disposition. Ever since he first came to me he
had been rather a shy bird and frequently would not allow one to
get within thirty yards of him without taking alarm. Suddenly,
however, his timidity vanished, and when one day I wished to drive
him out of the quadrangle, where he had shown a disposition to
bully some cockatiels and appeared likely to injure them, I found it
impossible to make him go. He let me walk right up to him and
hit him over the wings with my handkerchief, and even then only
flew slowly round and returned to his original perch within three
feet of me, regardless of my hostile demonstrations in his face. For
quite ten minutes I pursued him, belabouring him as hard as I could
without risk of really hurting him ; at the end of that time I had
thoroughly alarmed everything else in the place, except my friend
the King, who was as cool as ever and as determined to remain. I
retired defeated ! Of late, however, he appears to have grown tired
of the indifference of the Queen and the unfriendliness of her two

companions, for he has left them almost entirely and spends his
time in the company of a cock Rosella with whom, for some reason,
he has struck up a warm bachelor friendship.
In conclusion, I may perhaps give a word of warning to
intending purchasers of King Parrakeets. As I have already said
these birds are extremely liable to contract septic fever, therefore
never get one which is thin or weak, it will only die and may infect
your other stock. Be very careful also to examine the birds' eyes,
and if they are dull or watery, have nothing to do with it. Kings
are subject to one or two diseases of the eye, which almost invariably
end in loss of sight, one form being characterized by a dilation of
the cornea, another by a revelling of the eyelid, and, eventually,
complete closing of the eyes; and these diseases are never developed
by birds kept in clean healthy surroundings, but are started in the
filthy travelling boxes and stock cages to which so many dealers
consign their unfortunate stock.
If obtained in good condition, however, the King is easily
kept, especially in an outdoor aviary. Wheat, oats, canary seed
and a little hemp, with fruit, dandelion, lettuce, etc. being all that
it requires in the way of food. When at liberty, Kings take a
certain amount of insects and I have even seen mine eating lob-
worms and dead (very dead ) mice ; but in captivity such extras are
quite unnecessary and might prove harmful.
As an occupant of a mixed aviary a King does not shine,
being of a bullying disposition and fond of attacking smaller and
weaker birds. He is, however, very often a bit of a coward as well.
Contrary to the popular belief, bullies--human or avian--are gener-
ally very courageous, but the King is an exception. On more than
one occasion I have seen my old bird put to ignominious flight by a
small hen Pennant, who was about the only other parrakeet who
ever attempted to stand up to him. Moreover, while he enjoys
nothing&apos; better than looking on at one of the indiscriminate melees
in which the members of the broadtail family love to indulge
during the winter months, he always takes good care to keep on the
outskirts of the fray and cheer on the combatants from a respectful
distance.

It is with great pleasure, but with some diffidence, that, in
response to the request of the Editor of the Avicultural Magazine ,
I am writing a short account of "Agrippa," my long-legged bird
(a white Stork) named after "Tall Agrippa," out of Shockhead Peter,
a book which gave me great pleasure in my childhood's days.
Agrippa is a friend of five years standing. I bought him,
chiefly, I think, in order to rescue him from the tiny pen in which
he was being kept in a horribly dirty condition in a bird-shop in the
East end of London, for I felt that he would be happier in my
garden, where he stalks at will, and can, if so disposed, bathe in a
little pond. He has a house to go to at night, to avoid the danger
of the fox or very bad weather, and he quite realises that this house
is his sanctuary, for every evening the door is opened and he retires
and there remains undisturbed until the morning, when I go to let
him out.
On his arrival he was very timid and nervous, but he soon
became quite tame, and now, when one enters the garden and calls
"Agrippa," he comes up to take out of one's hand any little dainty
he can be offered, in the way of a piece of raw meat, fish, dead mouse,
bird, or even rat, which are swallowed whole without the least
inconvenience as far as can be gathered from his demeanour.
Whenever he sees one digging in the garden, it is interesting
and amusing to watch him walk up to the place and stand over it,
eyeing every spadefull of soil turned over in the hopes that a worm
may appear, at which he immediately grabs.
On several occasions he has walked into the house with me,
but is a little diffident, apparently being alarmed of meeting one of
the dogs or a stranger, whom he really never quite trusts.
The bird hardly ever attempts to fly, and the only time I
ever see him exercise his wings is in the morning when first let out,
possibly that is because I keep a few of the feathers cut, usually
cutting them in the autumn when the old ones have come out.
All the time I have had him, he has never done the least
harm in the garden, I should rather say done good, for he devours all
wire-worms, caterpillars, etc. he can see, with the greatest joy. His

only wickedness is, if ever a chicken happens to get into the garden
it is always death to it, as he darts after it at once, and the chicken
comes to a bad end.
I keep him well supplied with food in the winter, and he
does not appear to mind the cold in the least. Agrippa has been a
source of great pleasure and interest to me for the last five years
and, I trust, will be for many more to come.

A SHORT RECORD OF MY DOVES'

WITH MENTION OF MY DWARF PARROT.

As the heading of this brief article will infer, there is little I
have to tell concerning my, at present, but small flock of doves.
Much as I love all birds, this group of the ColumbcB ever has
been, and will remain, my favourite one. So that, as I have only
space for, and time to attend to, a limited number of feathered pets,
I prefer to keep to those I am most in sympathy with. Let me then
write of some of the members of my little family.
Of course, the familiar but always delightful Barbary Doves
have a prominent place among them, of which there are two pairs--
one hen dating back to 1896. She was given to me at Strassburg
(Germany) by an acquaintance, together with her original mate,
both birds being at that time a year old or a little over. Since then,
she came to England with me, was paired a second time (her mate
having flown away), and now still bides with me in Portugal with
her third mate, the second one dying in England. And this wonder-
ful old bird, not only still continues to lay, but, since 1910, when I
came over to Lisbon, has hatched and reared various young ones
successfully. One is now just four weeks old and she is sitting
again ; surely a record I should say. She does not look her age,
never having had either her nails or beak cut, nor does she need
these operations. Her daughter, hatched in England, is paired to a
fine young Portuguese Barbary named " Cheery," an appellation
he well deserves.

Next comes my poor crippled Whitewing, with the joint of
one wing cut or broken off, and a deformed beak with the upper and
lower mandibles crossing each other after the manner of the Cross-
bill. But he keeps in very fair condition, as besides grain I give
him soft food daily, made up of yolk of hard-boiled egg and biscuit,
moistened with a little water. Though he cannot fly he fights
gallantly, despite his limitations, with "Cheery," who engages in
battle with him on the floor of the aviary. Sometimes I let my
poor Whitewing out in the garden where he struts about quite
proudly.
The rest of my pets consist of six small foreign doves, not
long since eight, but two that I had with me since 1904--a male
Picui and a male Talpacoti--unluckily escaped about five months
ago, to my great regret.
I remarked, with regard to the Talpacoti especially, that he
improved greatly both in plumage and spirits since I brought him out
here (Lisbon) and, curiously enough, his beak, which grew abnormally
long whilst he was in England, and required pretty frequent clipping,
never needed shortening since he came to this country. He became,
too, a much bolder and livelier bird than under the dull skies of
England. The change of climate does not seem to have made any
sensible difference in the case of the Picui, or of my pair of Zebras,
which throve well in Hanwell and also equally well in Lisbon.
Since residing here, I have acquired two so-called Emerald
Doves (Chalcopelia afra and Chalcopelia chalcospila), and one with
sapphire blue marking on his wings instead of green, and with the
tip of his beak bright coral red ; a handsome bird.
Lastly, I have a male Harlequin Dove, apparently perfect in
plumage, only with naked skin under his wings instead of feathers,
unsightly when they are raised, but otherwise not noticeable, nor
in any way affecting the bird's health.
By a strange coincidence, the male true Emerald has the
same peculiarity, so that, instead of pairing him with my very
lovely female, I have put him in a separate cage with his fellow
sufferer, the Harlequin Dove.
The two fully adult cocks are fast friends, the Emerald even
going to the length of frequently feeding his companion from his

beak, as all cloves do with their young. It is always the Emerald
who goes through this truly comical performance. The attention is
never returned by the Harlequin, who feeds well by himself into
the bargain. Furthermore, the Emerald fondles the head feathers
of the other, evidently regarding him as his son. My bird-dealer
tells me he has never seen a similar case between two cock birds.
I am sorry I have no breeding results to record, beyond those
of the Barbary. I cannot spare either time or space enough to go
in for this, but my doves seem quite happy without nests or nesting.
In conclusion, I must give a short account of my dwarf
African Parrot. His proportions are perfect, only he belongs to a
diminutive species of his tribe, just as the human race of Pigmies
in that same Continent do with regard to their fellow-being&apos;s.
His length, from the tip of his beak to the end of his tail, is
9 2 inches, but he gets so scared when I attempt to measure him
with a ribbon yard-measure, that I cannot be very accurate on this
point, otherwise he is very tame and lets me handle and play with
him at will.
He is beautifully coloured. His back throughout a dark slaty
grey, intermixed with olive green feathers ; the shoulder-butts are
goldfinch yellow: the breast cheeky black and bright green : the
back, from under the wings to the base of the tail, of a most
exquisite peacock blue in the centre, shading off to green on the
sides and down his legs. * ; the inner part of the wings is fawn
colour, excepting on the shoulder-butts, where the yellow overlaps
the wings.
This parrot does not talk, but whistles ; imitates the song of
a canary, and " click-clicks" most imperiously when he fancies some
fruit or other dainty from our table till his summons is attended to.
And now I think I have said all I have to say on the subject
of my present experiences in bird - keeping. I should not have
thought it worth while to record them, had not the Editor invited
all the members of our Society to do so through the medium of our
Magazine, each one thus adding his item to the knowledge we all
strive after in the wonderful world of birds.

The weather, over which most unfortunately we have no
control, plays an important part in the successful rearing of most
fancy ducks.
Those who use incubators tell me that they find many a
young duck is saved by being&apos; put back to warm up thoroughly, but
my own experience has been that when attacked by cramp, the end
is too sudden for any outside assistance. If the bird is merely
starved with cold and wet, then the incubator drawer is excellent.
Newly-hatched young ducks do not appear to take any harm if they
do not feed for the first thirty-six hours after being put in the coop,
and some species seem much more apt to refuse food at first than
others, notably Carolina. There does not seem to be any certain
road to success in making any young take to eating. This year I
am trying putting a young call duck with each coop, at the sug-
gestion of a friend. So far it seems to have answered well, as
call ducks are greedy feeders and teach the others to come on.
It needs great patience to get an obstinate and self-willed
brood to feed at first, and the more little tricks are tried the greater
the success. Mr. Wormald advocates hanging small bits of the
food on grass tips, as well as scattering it on the backs of young
birds. I have also found vermicelli scalded and hung in threads on
grass to be good; as it is white it catches the eye.
Ants' eggs, dried of fresh, are appreciated by all young ducks,
and especially by Pochards and Tufted. I do not know if there is
much feed in dried ants' eggs, but anyhow the birds like them.
Maggots I have never used, but small worms nicely chopped up
seem to agree with all young ducks, and if put amongst coarse
sand and a little water the ducklings seem to thrive. Personally I
use Duck Meal and egg five times a day at first, and give water in a
very shallow tin lid not half an inch deep. Bread crumb and egg
is used with advantage by some, especially in Prance, for Mandarins
and Carolinas. Duck weed is appreciated by all young ducks, and I
do not think too much can be given in the water. It is full of
insect life, apart from being vegetable too, and is one would imagine
almost a food in itself.

Mr. Philip Gosse,
I notice most ducks are very fond of water shrimps, and when
the birds are a month old and allowed deeper dishes, I give water
shrimps and duck weed in tin trays, about 4ft. by 2ft. and 3in. deep,
and the birds thrive.
Shell Ducks are fond of fish, and I used to give raw fish cut
in strips twice a week when they were feathering, though I do not
for a moment say it is necessary. Probably the most critical time
with young ducks--after once they have started to feed well--is
when they are feathering, as it is then that the greatest drain on
their system takes place. If they do not feather well, I have found
a little cod liver oil mixed with food a good thing.
If one gave all one's personal attention to the duck rearing, I
think one would do better with incubators and foster mothers than
with hens, as the latter vary so : a restless hen kills half her ducks,
and many a hen takes a dislike to having a lot of wet ducklings
rushing in under her or standing on her back. No doubt cross-bred
Game-Silkie are the best mothers, but they do not cover many eggs.
Bantams are always good, but so small that they get out of the coop
bars, and the former objection applies still more to them.
After all, luck enters largely in the element of success, and
some of one's friends find a certain species quite easy to rear while
one fails signally at it oneself, though successful with another which
others find hard.
A DAY IN A HAMPSHIRE GARDEN.
By Philip Gosse.
How often it happens that one goes forth after much pre-
paration to watch or look for some bird or other and returns empty;
perhaps to find something of ornithological interest at one's very
door step.
Being compelled to spend a day at home and to go no further
than the boundaries of my small garden, on a day in June, the
twenty-first to be concise, I could not help noticing how much that
was interesting was taking place near at hand.
At breakfast--and being one of the lazy sort of bird-watchers

I leave the birds alone before--there were two insistent call notes :
one the Corn-crake, the other the Lesser Spotted Woodpecker.
This Pigmy among the Picidce is always rather a conundrum
with me, as each year in the early spring I can hear him "drumming"
on a favourite dead tree half a mile away across the river. Then
nothing more is seen or heard until one day in the month of June I
hear his persistent "keek-keek" in the apple trees close to the house.
Then, if one is patient and has a good pair of binoculars, one may
discover the charming young family in the upper branches of an old
apple tree or an elm, being fed by the parents. But where they
nest I have never yet discovered.
A few days ago I watched one of the old birds in the usual
apple tree, its beak full of insects, but was unable to trace it, much
as I wished, to its nest-hole, though I rather suspected an old elm.
To-day, hearing the familiar " keek-keek " for the first time, I knew
that the young had left the home, and on going out to look for them,
there they were, the young ones very difficult to see among the high
branches of the elm tree.
It was like hearing the voice of a long-lost friend, when one
hot afternoon in June of this year, a loud " crek-crek " rung out in
the long grass by the tennis court. It then continued intermit-
tently day and night, and even the dearest and oldest friend becomes
a trifle wearisome when he repeats the same monotonous tale
continually, as our Corn-crake does. Still it is good to have him
back again with us after several years of absence.
Howard Saunders in his text book on British Birds says
that the call of the Corn-crake can be imitated by rubbing one's
thumb-nail rapidly along the teeth of a stiff comb, and that by
doing this the Corn-crake may be made to approach quite close to
the performer of the hair comb. So, lonely one moonlight night, I
went forth with my comb and patiently imitated the voice of Crex
pratensis for half an hour or more. But not a feather did the Land-
rail seem to turn, in answer to my seductive comb-song ; so that
after ruining my thumb-nail and breaking half the teeth of my
comb, I returned home, for the first time in my life having my
faith a little shaken in Howard Saunders.
Finding that the Land-rail was almost always to be heard

each night calling in exactly the same spot, one apparently about
twenty paces from the tennis court in some long grass, I decided to
track him down. Again a lovely warm moonlight night and the rail
in full voice, when I ventured forth through the high grass, stopping
every few paces to play a few notes on my comb, making slowly
towards the spot where I thought the bird would be.
When I eventually found my little friend I discovered that
he was just one hundred and fifty yards away from where I started,
and not twenty as I had judged. When I got within two paces of
him, and he was still calling, I was surprised to hear what a
tremendously loud voice he had. What I think the sound was
most like is that made by one of those old-fashioned wooden
burglar alarms or police rattles. It was quite overwhelming in its
loudness and intensity. Suddenly he stopped and the most utter
silence prevailed for perhaps several minutes : when I could stand
the suspense and the midges no longer and took one step nearer,
up got the rail, fluttering away a few yards to drop out of sight
again in the long grass. By the time I had reached the house again
" crek-crek " was ringing out, still apparently only twenty yards
away.
Another summer visitor who has stopped to nest in the
garden this year is the Lesser White-throat, Mr. Hudson's " better"
white-throat. One spring morning he was there, singing from sun-
rise to sundown, up and down the hedge, hunting for insects and
singing at the same time.
Eventually the pair nested low down in the hedge among
some brambles ; the cock ceasing to sing when the hen commenced
to sit. In due time six little Lesser Whitethroats were successfully
hatched out and the parents were kept busy finding insects to feed
them with. All went well until a few days of the time when the
young would be able to leave the nest, when, on going to pay them
my usual morning visit, lo ! the nest and young were gone and the
bush pulled about.
It was a dreadful blow ! I felt I had lost some dear friends ;
having watched the birds daily, during their courtship, building the
nest, pairing, feeding and guarding their young, and all to end in

this tragedy. I felt sure of the murderer : a vile, slinking black
cat from the village.
At eight o'clock the same evening, at the other end of the
hedge I found the male White-throat paying marked attentions to
his lady, so hope that all may still be well with them.
An hour later, a shot rang out and a black murderer met his
just sentence, and was given a felon's burial by moonlight, at the
spot where a Lesser White-throat's nest had been.

By Maurice Amsler.
The Editor having asked me for copy for the July number of
the Avicultural Magazine, I propose keeping an old promise made to
him of a short account of my new aviaries.
Last year, when I moved into a new house, all my old home-
made aviaries had to be pulled down, and almost the whole of them,
by dint of much thought and engineering, have been requisitioned
in the construction of the new flights.
I do not think that anything in the present range of aviaries
is either particularly new or startlingly striking, but I had neverthe-
less profited by experience in the building of the old flights, and
this experience served me in good stead, and may prevent other
beginners from making many mistakes in the construction of their
bird-houses.
Whereas the old aviaries were gradually built with my own
hands (there were seven including a bird-room), the new ones had to
be erected in three months, and I was obliged to employ a couple of
labourers for the heavy work, and also a carpenter for part of the
time, acting myself chiefly as foreman and clerk of the works.
Quite at the beginning I was able to obtain a sound wooden
shed, built of 4in. by 3in. quartering and feather-edge boards ; it had
a span roof which was in bad repair, and was 20ft. long by 18ft. broad
and 15ft. with ridge. The ground at my disposal was a strip 54ft.
long and 20ft. broad, and by planting the shed in the middle of this I
was able to wire in two flights 18ft. by 20ft. at each side of the shed.

Dr. Maurice Amsler,
The two gable ends of the shed were first put up, ridge board
and rafters followed, a large skylight was let in to each slope of the
roof, which was then hoarded and covered with " Stoniflore," a great
improvement on tarred felt. The sides of the shelter shed were not
boarded but glazed -- the glass being stippled with white paint,
which obviates the necessity of wire netting to protect the birds
from injury--the shed being then divided, by means of 2in. by 2in.
quartering and half-inch mesh wire, into four partitions, 10ft. by 9ft.
Each of the partitions opens by means of a glazed door into an
outside flight, 10ft. by 18ft., but in cold weather the doors can be
kept shut and the birds allowed to fly in and out of the shelter
through a small trap door placed above each door and worked by a
cord and pulley.
The floor of the shelter is concreted, and each partition is
provided with a 4in. by 4in. post, 3ft. high, on which is planted the
feeding&apos; tray, thus the food is absolutely out of reach of mice.
The doors leading from one partition to another have each,
in addition to a latch, a special spring, thus obviating an accidental
" mix-up " of the birds should one be left unsecurely fastened.
The outside flights, 18ft. by 10ft., are 8ft. high and built of
stout quartering and fin. mesh wire netting, this was an extravagance
which I hoped would keep mice out, but so far I have failed signally
in this, although the house is let 18in. into the ground.
All birds prefer to roost rather high, and I have found that
they can easily be induced to do so in the shelter, provided the
shelter is higher than the flights, they are thus safe from storms,
rain and cats. While on the latter subject, I might mention that I
have fixed rectangular wire brackets, projecting two feet all round
the tops of the flights, on which is stretched one inch mesh wire
netting, this making the top of the aviary absolutely inaccessible to
cats ; by means of this contrivance, a rifle, and last, but not least, a
bull terrier, I no longer have much trouble from felis clomesticus.
It is perfectly maddening to wake up in the middle of the night and
hear your poor birds--some of which are perhaps sitting--dashing
about in the dark, and, on looking out, to see the hated dark form
of a cat crouching or careering about on the roof of the aviary.
Each of the flights is provided with a concrete bath, which is

fitted with a plug and an overflow connected with a " soakaway,"
and down pipes from the roof of the shelter keep the baths full and
clean during rainy weather.
There is a concrete path running the length of each flight,
which I find easy to keep clean, and on which I sprinkle tit-bits of
seed, etc. ; gravel paths on the other hand are liable to become very
foul and cannot be used for this purpose.
The end of one of the flights is fitted with a movable frame
fixed 3ft. from its end--this gives me a small aviary, 10ft. by 3ft. by
8ft. high (fig. 5 plan). There is also a long narrow flight (fig. 6)
30ft. by 4ft., which can be made continuous with Aviary No. 2 by
opening a door ; this aviary is provided with a small partly glazed
shelter at the far end.
All doors opening from the garden into the flights push in-
wards and are 18 inches lower than the flights themselves ; this
greatly reduces the chances of a bird escaping when one is entering
the aviaries ; the main door into the shelter opens into a small
lobby, built also with the idea of safety. Moreover, in hot weather,
this door can be kept open.
The occupants of the aviaries are
No. I. Pairs of Golden-fronted Fruit-suckers and Blue-winged
Sivas in the outer flights (both building). A pair of American
Robins are shut into the shelter half of this aviary because they
were inclined to the greenhouse. These birds are sitting.

begging for mealworms for their family. The young are grow-
ing apace, and are now fourteen days old, so I shall soon be
obliged to close the aviary door unless I am to find my chicks
flown. I fear that, notwithstanding their tameness, nothing
would bring the old birds back to their home once they had
made off with their precious charge.

I don't know how the majority of aviculturists have done
this year, but reports from several quarters seem to show that the
season has not been at all a good one for breeding. At the Zoologi-
cal Gardens we have had an extraordinary number of infertile eggs,
in many cases from birds that have before proved themselves to be
good breeders. A full-winged wigeon duck nests every year in one
of the flower beds near the Three-island pond, generally bringing off
a large brood of seven or nine. This year she sat well on nine eggs,
but succeeded in hatching only two. A Paradise duck (Tadorna
variegata ) generally produces a good brood, but this year all her eggs
except one proved clear. The pair of White - throated Ground
Thrushes which reared three young birds last year, have so far had
two nests, but the eggs have all been infertile. Now she is sitting
again, and we hope for better success.

The old pair of Crested Screamers in the Great Aviary hatched
three beautiful chicks, fluffy yellowish little birds much like young
geese, with orange legs. But they brooded them too well, for they
managed to smother one soon after hatching, and, since the accom-
panying photograph was taken, a second has met with a similar
fate. This second youngster was a fine strong bird, but the pressure
of its mother's enormous foot during the night simply transformed
it into a flattened corpse. These extraordinary birds are so much
like geese, feeding chiefly upon grass and other green food, that I
should be much inclined another year, to transfer their eggs to the
care of some steady old goose, who, I believe, would rear the chicks
without any difficulty.
In the great Seagulls' Aviary the pair of White Storks nested
as they did last year, hatching three young ones. Last year five
were hatched, but all died. This year, however, I am glad to say
the three young birds have been successfully reared and are now
shifting for themselves in one of the paddocks of the Ostrich House.
The American Red-winged Starlings have a family of three
which have left the nest. Bronze-wings, Crested and White-fronted
doves all have young, and a pair of the little Spotted Tinamous have
brought off three chicks.
A pair of Blue Water-hens (Porphyrio porphyrio) hatched off
two chicks in the Great Aviary, but as they seemed inclined to
neglect them, being much disturbed by the other birds in the enclo-
sure, we took them and gave them to a small bantam to rear. They
are exactly like the young Black-backed Porphyrios we have reared
on several occasions, and most engaging little creatures, running to
meet their keeper on his approach, and readily taking food from his
hand.
Mexican Quails have a small brood of three or four chicks,
and to-day (July 14th) the keeper discovered a hen Douglas Quail
with a good brood of seven or eight. We thought she was sitting
somewhere, but the nests of these quails are so very well concealed
in the long grass that it is impossible to ascertain their whereabouts
without running the risk of causing the bird to desert. They are
generally approached through a long tunnel under the grass which
is pulled down so as to completely conceal the nest. Another pair

of Douglas Quails nested in a more exposed situation, but the hen
had an attack of " gapes" just as she was about to sit, so the eggs
were placed in the incubator, and as I write one chick has hatched
and the others are chipping. The hen was successfully treated and
will probably lay again. These chicks will be placed in a Hearson's
Foster Mother, in which we successfully reared six of the same kind
last year.
Of new arrivals, we have lately received two nice young
Boatbills of the northern form, Canchroma zeledoni, a species which
appears to be new to the collection. It is to be hoped that they
will do as well as the old bird of the southern form, C. cochleria,
which has lived well for more than nine years.
The arrival of a second specimen of the Kagu and two Sun
Bitterns are noteworthy, as both species are rare and most attractive
forms. The old Kagu has lived in the Western Aviary since 1906
and been a constant source of interest to visitors. It is much to be
hoped that the new arrival may prove to be of the opposite sex, but
it is impossible at present to say to which sex either belong. The
Sun Bittern is also a most delightful and beautiful bird which, years
ago, bred several times in the Gardens. In recent years there have
only been single individuals in the collection, but now that we have
three there may be a chance of their nesting.
Mr. Goodfellow recently brought home from Chili a couple of
the handsome Andean Geese ( Chloephaga melanoptera) , and these
have been purchased by the Zoological Society, forming a valuable
addition to the fine series of waterfowl in the collection.Whether
they are a true pair or not is at present uncertain.
Quite recently a gentleman brought home from Australia a
pair of minute flower-peckers ( Dicceuvi hirundinaceum ) and pre-
sented them to the Society on behalf of Mr. Heumann of Sydney.
They are no larger than Gold-crests, and their successful importation
is a most creditable achievement. The Society has only once pre-
viously exhibited a Dicceum, namely in 1909, when Mr. Frost brought
home an example of D. ignicolle for Sir William Ingram from the
Aru Islands, which lived for just a year in the Small Bird House.

Young Emperor Geese were hatched out, but did not live. In spite of
being in a very large enclosure where they could have found good grit, they ate
fine sand which brought on enteritis.
Young Stanley Parrakeets were hatched in the grounds (the parents being
at liberty) and brought up ; and also Rosellas. A brood of Adelaide Parrakeets
were in their nest at the beginning of July, and a second one of Barnards.
The Gang-Gang Cockatoos had apparently again deserted their eggs.
It is curious that birds at liberty should take the trouble to nest and lay, and at
the crucial moment give it all up. One wonders whether any interfering Owls

SIR,--I was sold a bird the other day by Thorpe, of Worksop, as a female
S. African Bullfinch, and the enclosed curious Latin names sent as likely to be
one of them.
The bird is more like a Hawfinch in size and build, a hen Greenfinch
coloured with green rump, dirty white streaks by eyes and under throat. Sings
very well and is great friends with my Russian cock Bullfinch. I bought her to
try and get a cross.
What is it likely to be ? I enclose names as I got them.
(Crilosagra chroysopyga). (Lohospisa croropygia).
E. Warren Vernon.
The following reply has been sent to Mrs. Vernon.
Your bird is certainly not Crithagra chrysopyga (that being a synonym of
Serinus icterus --The Green Singing-finch). As it comes from South Africa it is
probably the male of Serinus albigularis --The White-throated Seed-eater, said
to be an excellent songster. I have only had the female of this bird, which
never uttered a note. The allied species Serinus crocopygius (Poliospiza
crocopygia is a synonym) comes from South-Western Africa.

SIR, -- I have read with much interest the various letters respecting my
article under this heading, in the July No. of our Magazine and in Le Chenil.
To my horror I discover that I have committed the unpardonable sin of not at
once repudiating with scorn the evidence published in trade Reports touching the
present method of obtaining Egret plumes in Venezuela. The truth is that I
was so pleased to be assured, not only by French plumage collectors, but by His
Britannic Majesty's Minister at Venezuela in a letter under date of January
14tli, 1909, directed to the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds * (that the
wholesale massacre of families in which we had (with the deepest horror and
disgust) been taught to believe, as the sole method by which Egret's plumes
were or could be collected, was no longer practised : that I thought it would
please my grieved fellow-members of this Society to be told the joyful news.
Not having ever been out of Europe in this life, I do not pretend to any
knowledge beyond what I read : however I need not enlarge upon this point,
which was the last item touched upon in my article, but has been referred to as
if it had been an obsession with me and had tinctured my whole existence and
all my writings, whereas -- as I stated before--I personally object to see the
mortal remains of birds, however beautiful, perched aloft upon women's hats.
At the same time I do not for a moment admit that feathers, picked up after a
moult from bushes in the sleeping quarters of birds (not out of the mud under
deserted nests), must necessarily be either broken, frayed or soiled. I often pick
up feathers in my comparatively small aviaries, after the moult of my birds, in
absolutely perfect condition. If it is a deadly sin for me, when I am told that
some crying evil has been remedied by very strict laws, to ask my friends to
rejoice with me, I suppose I must be content to be a sinner and unrepentant;
but it is not exactly pleasant, when I would do good, to be informed that evil is
present with me.
Now I will cease to be feather-brained and revert to the commencement
of my paper. Monsieur A. P. (I don't know the gentleman's patronymic) speaks
of me as birdsnesting when a village infant and Mr. St. Quintin as a lad.
I was not born in a country village but at Cheyne Walk, Chelsea, in June 1844,
and I began to collect eggs in the Blean Woods near the village of Herne when
staying in the neighbourhood with my wife in 1871. Belonging, as I then did
to the Staff of our National Museum, I loved the natural sciences for their
own sake and not for personal profit: the study of Natural History is rarely
profitable.
As I never was a rabid collector, of course I agree perfectly with many of

Lord William Percy's remarks and his condemnation of the wholesale accumu-
lation of rare eggs. I collected both nests and eggs with a definite object ; and,
no sooner was that object attained and my first book on Oology published than I
ceased to add to my collection. Though nearly all my eggs were taken by
myself in Kent, Norfolk, and Essex, I had a few given to me by friends ; and
others (which for all I cared may have been either British or foreign) I purchased,
to represent the species in my series.
I always believed that I had some perception of humour, but for the life
of me I fail to see anything comical in my suggestion that inbreeding weakens
stock and, if persisted in, may tend to extinction of species : it certainly would
be no laughing matter for the offspring produced, though one or two of my
readers seem to have discovered a great deal of humour in it, I believe it to be
an admitted fact that many bird families, unless forcibly broken up, keep within
call of each other from the time when they leave the nest until the succeeding
mating season (at any rate among resident species) and it has been unques-
tionably proved that steady inbreeding in birds tends to produce albinism,
which undoubtedly is not a sign of a vigorous constitution.
At my time of life I assuredly do not desire to add many birds to my
aviaries. If I could afford to pay a regular skilled attendant to look after them
the case might be different; but, after many years, one grows weary of the
monotony of daily preparing soft food and fruit for insectivorous species and
supplying the many needs of a large living collection. I dare not trust the
happiness and well-being of my family to ignorant and unskilled persons, there-
fore they live on year after year in perfect health and condition, and I perforce
have to spare at least an hour each morning from the culture of flowers, which
of late years I have returned to with fresh enthusiasm after many years of
partial neglect of them.
At one time my collection of living birds numbered 250 individuals ; now
it totals about 40. In the past three years I have purchased just six quite cheap
birds, all of which were brought to me : but though I neither desire nor intend
to add to my own responsibilities, I do sympathize with our poorer members
who would be glad to keep and perchance breed many of the beautiful things
which I used to obtain at reasonable prices, but which excessive bird-protection
has placed beyond their reach.
I never suggested that the species which had been well-nigh exterminated
by farmers and others were British; in fact I was thinking of Conuropsis
carolinensis and Ectopistes migratorius, both natives of the United States.
Cats ! ! I have always regarded these beasts as vermin ; I was born with
an inherent antipathy to them, as some persons to reptiles : now I love lizards ;
they are the only four-footed animals which I ever made great pets of, though at
various times I have also kept axolotls, newts, frogs and I think a salamander,
not to mention legless reptiles. We are not accountable for these likes and dis-
likes, they may have some connection with our own earlier history or that of our

ancestors and therefore have become instinctive. Unhappily cats seem naturally
attracted to me, and sometimes jump into my lap when I am visiting friends
to my great disgust.
There have been many prosecutions of unhappy persons caught with young
birds in their possession ; and, in spite of all assertions to the contrary, I am
quite satisfied that if I had been caught with the rescued Wagtail in my
possession by any zealous protectionist, I should have been dragged before a
magistrate, fined, and the barely fledged youngster turned loose to die of hunger
and cold, or be devoured by the first predacious creature which came across it :
nor, if I had explained my motives in taking the bird home, should I have been
believed.
The Wryneck is a single-brooded bird, and if we allow six eggs to a sitting,
the hen cruelly plundered in 1872 and the year following was deprived, each
season of the equivalent of seven clutches, whereas under natural conditions
only half a dozen eggs would probably have been laid. Where then is the want
of logic in my remark that to take one sitting from such fertile creatures as
birds, could have no injurious effect upon them ?
I think these are the only points which need comment from me, but the
Editor may surely congratulate himself upon the additional copy which my
little article has brought him.* A. G. BUTLER.
EGRET PLUMES.
SIR,--I had no intention of taking part in the discussion raised by Dr.
Butler's letter in the June issue of the Magazine, but when recently reading Mr.
Caspar Whitney's charming book, "The Plowing Road," published in 1912,1
came across some authentic information on the subject of Egrets which, being
first-hand, has an important bearing on the question and cannot fail to interest
aviculturists. I make no apology, therefore, for quoting Mr. Whitney's own
words:--"The father [of this family] in the summer season was a plume
hunter, he told me, devoting his efforts almost entirely to Egrets, whose
feathers he-tookto San Fernando de Apure to a milliner's agent, who assorted
and forwarded them to New York. The last year had been a poor one for him ;
indeed for several seasons the general annual plume harvest had fallen far below
the standard, because of the great and repeated yearly slaughter. He referred
enthusiastically to the profits of the business, declaring he had in a few weeks'
hunting made enough to keep him a year, and [that] one hundred birds in a
single visit to a colony rookery [was] not unusual.
" Killing an Egret is as easy as killing chickens in the yard, he explained,
because the birds return year after year to the same places to make their
rookeries, which are closely occupied in great numbers, and because they are
easy of approach during their breeding period, the only time when they wear the
white nuptial plume .... known to the millinery world as the aigrette. . . .

In reply to my particular query if moulted feathers are gathered, he answered
that some such are used by the Indians for decorative purposes, but none of
commercial value are ever found on the ground, the season of slaughter being
while the birds are nesting, when the plumes are in full lustre and life. With
the decrease of the Egret, or little white Heron, native gunners from San
Fernando and Bolivar in the employ of the millinery interests are beginning to
kill other birds of attractive plumage, which previously had been unmolested-
several of the larger Herons, the Cranes, Spoonbills, Ibises being thus prej-ed
upon. In short, he added, that the entire bird colony is becoming perceptibly
reduced in numbers." (pp. 261-262).
Finally Mr. Witney speaks of the Apure-Arauca delta, and the southern
reaches of the Apure itself as "the Egret-shambles" (p. 263).
The passages quoted supply evidence, which may not be disregarded, that
Egrets ancl other birds carrying plumes of commercial value are decreasing in
numbers and that moulted Egret plumes are valueless to the trade. Further
comment is superfluous. R. I. POCOCK.

SIR,--I see the subject of the indiscriminate capture and traffic in birds,
and their condition in the dealers' shops, on which I dwelt in the May number
of the Magazine, has not been taken up by members as I hoped it might have
been, for it is a very real and great evil, and ought to appeal to the sense of
justice for which England is famous. I would ask those who deprecate or deny
the statements I make to examine into the matter for themselves, as I have
done. To visit as many bird-shops as possible, not merely in London, and
ascertain if the birds are kept in sanitary and humane conditions ; and to be at
the docks to see the birds arrive from abroad by millions, an increasing stream.
By the side of this wholesale traffic and enormous waste of bird-life, the English
bird-catcher and his hungry children sink into obscurity. I should, at the same
time, be very sorry to let it be imagined that in the protest I make against the
bird-shops in England I mean to "tar them all with the same brush." There
are of course honest and intelligent dealers, who value and understand about
their birds and do their utmost to keep them in health and cleanliness, but
these, as I have said, are alas ! quite in the minority, and they would be the
first to deplore the existing state of things. Even they, if they keep a large
stock of birds, must find it extremely difficult to give to each the attention and
care it requires. Imagine the daily task of cleaning out such a multitude of
bird-cages ! Add to this the ornithological knowledge required to provide each
bird with its proper food supply, and the work of supplying the food. The care to
ensure freshness and the labour of seeing to all the different supplies--of egg-food
and ants' eggs and mealworms and insect-food and the different kinds of grain.
A small army of workers, busy the whole day long, would be needed to look after
hundreds of birds ! I have sometimes wondered if a properly organized bird-

market, under scientific supervision, might be possible, the capture of young and
healthy birds restricted and properly carried out. It would probably be a boon
to the honest dealer and ensure the Acquisition of healthy birds, besides putting
an end to this senseless traffic. It would be a benefit all round : to the avicul-
turist, the dealer, and the birds.
In Le Chenil, I see that the deplorable condition of affairs with regard to
the indiscriminate capture and dealing, is contradicted as " une generalisation
nullement justifiee," and that " les oiseaux s'accomodent fortbiendela captivite
pouron qu 'ils y trouvent les soins necessaires."
As an aviculturist, I fully endorse this last statement. Birds, given
proper conditions and in kind hands, get to look upon their cages as home. But
it is the absence of the " soins necessaires " that constrains me to call atten-
tion to and deplore it! The dealers' shops in France appear to be properly looked
after, and the fact " qu 'on etablisse une inspection sanitaire pour les cages
d'oiseaux " proves how much ahead of us the French are in such matters. I
have never entered a French bird-dealer's shop, but I have visited many in
Germany, and have always been struck by the superiority of them to so many in
England. The dealers are intelligent men and fond of their birds, and the cages
are roomy and kept clean. Moreover, there do not appear to be, so far as I can
judge, such thousands as there are in the London shops, and there is more
variety. Such enormous numbers of little foreign and tropical birds are there
in the latter -- common enough, poor little things !--that dealers advertise them
as "the usual rubbish," and one can imagine their fate.
Le Clienil goes on to say " la meilleure epreuve qu 'ils n'y souffrent pas,
c'est qu'ils chantent." . . . " et que leur plumage peut y etre aussi brillant
et soigne qu' a l'etat fibre."
As to a bird singing in a cage, its song is surely in great measure--whether
caged or free--a physical necessity for its lungs and throat, not solely an ebulli-
tion of joy. The poor Larks, jumping up and down unceasingly in their vain
efforts to rise and soar, shriek with song. Is their's an indication of joy and
content ? Is any bird's melody poured forth in a tiny cage, when its eyes
have been put out with hot wires to make it sing better, " une epreuve qu 'ils n 'y
souffrent pas ?" * And as to the plumage, if this is as brilliant and well cared for
as in the birds' wild state, why do we not oftener see it in the dealers' shops?
The most common sight is that of once beautiful birds huddled up, shivering
with fever, sick and miserable, and we are told " he's a bit out of plumage now,
the gas, you see ; but he'll be all right once he's out of the shop." Even birds
in fair health are too often ragged and dirty in the shops. How is each one to
bathe in clean water ?
When we reflect that each bird is in itself a miracle of beauty and in-
telligence, for very love of Science we should no longer remain callous to the
existing state of things. KATHARINE CURREY.

Thinocorus rumicivorus.
By Hubert D. Astley.
Mr. Goodfellow brought home from Chili, landing&apos; in the first
week of July, some birds which were a puzzle to those who had
never before seen them. Mrs. Johnstone very kindly invited me to
go to Burrswood on the day after their arrival. Incidentally, the
principal interest w T as not birds, but Chinchillas ; which I preferred
infinitely to see in their skins, rather than the latter made into
muffs and boas, etc. As however, they are not birds, I must refrain
from studying them too closely, at any rate in the Magazine;
suffice it to say, they are most fascinating, and a pearly-grey coated
Chinchilla, when tame, would make a charming pet. In a cage near
by, I saw what at first sight looked like larks, but it reminded me of
Lewis Carroll's line--" I looked again, and saw it was a hippo-
potamus " ! but in this case, when I looked again, I saw a miniature
bustard, of a lark's dimensions, and yet again, when one's eyes
examined the wings, they were of the snipe order.
On the following day, I betook myself to Mr. Chubb at the
Natural History Museum (Cromwell Boadh " Seed Snipe " he said
at once, and we proceeded to hunt out the skins. Thinocorus
rumicivorus they turned out to be, inhabiting W. Peru, Bolivia,
Chili, Patagonia and Argentina.
Imagine a bird the size of a sky-lark, with upper plumage of
much the same colouring, running and stooping to the ground in a
"larky" fashion, but with yellowish legs and feet small, and

The Seed Snipe.
looking as if they would scarcely sustain the weight of the body,
after the bustard manner: only the Seed Snipe has a diminutive
hind toe.
In the male, a blackish line runs down the centre of the
breast, and forks out on either side. The female has a yellowish-
brown breast, and in both sexes the underparts are white. There
are the narrow, long, sharply-pointed wings of a snipe, with the
plump body of a partridge, and the head of a lark.
In "Argentine Ornithology," Vol. II., p. 176 (Sclater and
Hudson), one finds that when alighting, the Seed Snipe drops its
body directly upon the ground, and sits close like a goat-sucker ;
when rising, it rushes suddenly away with the wild hurried flight
and sharp, scraping alarm-cry of a snipe.
These birds migrate northwards to the Pampas in the winter.
They flock together in forties and fifties, keeping very close when
flying, hut are much scattered when on the ground, and reluctant to
rise. If a person stands close to, or in the midst of a flock, they
soon betray their presence by answering each other with a variety
of notes, which seem to come from beneath the ground.
Mr. H. Durnford has recorded in the Ibis (1876, p. 164) that
he found the Seed Snipe common in the neighbourhood of Buenos
Ayres from May to September, and always in flocks, and that it
seems equally fond of wet swamps and the dry campos. When
disturbed, they fly round, uttering a low whistle, and invariably
alighting head to wind. When in Central Patagonia, Mr. Durnford
took eggs of this species at the end of October ; and the young were
running in the middle of November ; but they probably have two or
more broods in the season, for he found chicks in March.
The nest is a slight depression in the ground, sometimes lined
with a few blades of grass ; and before leaving it, the old bird covers
up the eggs with little pieces of stick. The eggs are pale stone
ground-colour, very thickly but finely speckled with light and dark
chocolate markings ; they have a polished appearance, and measure
1&apos;3 x '8 inch. The chick is finely mottled all over with light and
dark brown, having the beak pale horn-colour ; legs, flesh-colour ;
iris, wood-brown.
This curious bird is most nearly allied in essential structure

to the Plovers. Only about six species are known. Mr. Goodfellow
found them on bare and desolate districts in Central Chili, on high
ground.
I have not yet put the pair that I took away with me from
Burrswood in an outdoor aviary, but when I do, I feel sure I must
clip their primaries on one side, or they would certainly fly suddenly
up and kill themselves against a wire roof. In the bird-room, I let
them run about the floor, where although inclined to take fright
suddenly, they are as a rule quite tame. When kept in a cage they
require a turf, or peat moss, for their small feet are apt to become
clogged with sand.
The male bird at times uplifts his body and gives out a
curious ' crow,' which sounds not unlike a wheel in some machinery,
rapidly moving round and in need of oil.
Although in a wild state Seed Snipe are said to be graniverous,
I find mine will greedily eat fresh ants' cocoons. They are also fond
of green food, which is undoubtedly essential to their well-being.
If they live through the winter, and they seem extremely healthy
and easy to keep, it will be most interesting if they nest and breed
later on.

Motacilla alba.
By W. E. Teschemakek.
I propose to curtail my notes on this most interesting species
for several reasons, one of which is that I recently contributed to
"Cage Birds" an article giving the fullest possible details of its
habits both in captivity and in freedom, its migration routes, etc.
To the migration routes mentioned in the above article, I may briefly
add that our member, Major Perreau, has informed me that there is
a vertical migration of this species in the Himalayas, the adults
moving up to the higher altitudes to nest in spring and returning
in autumn with their young. The migration routes of the species
in North America should also have been worked out, but I do not
wish to go into that matter now.
Perhaps those of our members who are beginners will better

Mr. W. E. Teschemaker,
realise what a dreadful waste of time may be involved in breeding
some particular species, if I arrange these notes under the headings
of the years that have elapsed since I took the matter in hand.
1906. In September of this year, I first saw an actual flock
of White Wagtails on a sheltered beach in the Isle of Man, and was
much delighted with their beauty and grace, but I had no apparatus
for trapping.
1907. I took some traps to the Isle of Man, but the
Wagtails were far too wary to enter the traps.
1908. I spent the last week of May, and the first week of
June in the Island, and endeavoured to solve the question whether
any pairs nested there. In September I took over clap-nets and a
call-bird, but without success. In October I caught my first White
Wagtail in Devonshire.
1909. I caught three White Wagtails in the Isle of Man,
and kept them in an outdoor aviary through the winter.
1910. In the summer of this year, I had a nest built and
young hatched, but the old birds refused to feed with anything but
moths, which they flushed by beating the grass with their wings.
This made me think the attempt somewhat hopeless.
1911. I had three nests and three more failures. I released
the Manx Wagtails (which presumably belonged to the race which
breeds in the far North), and obtained a series from Germany. I
applied a test to these, retaining one male and two females which
showed some inclination to feed with the class of insect food which
I had decided to use.
1912. I could not induce either female to nest. This
species does not easily become reconciled to captivity, and requires
much more careful management than the Pied Wagtail.
1913. I only used one hen this year, keeping the other in
reserve. The spring moult took place between the 10th and the
28th February. (Eor a description of the moult and the character-
istics which distinguish it from that of the Pied Wagtail, see my
article in " Cage Birds " ; the suggestions made there have been
supported by later experience).
Towards the end of April, the male constructed a nest
without assistance in a nest-box, eight feet from the ground. Court-

ship commences with a curious mannerism: the male crouches
directly in front of the female, facing her, and widely opens his beak.
A little reflection will convince us that this curious pose (also
adopted by the Blue-throated Warbler), is simply the attitude of a
young bird asking to be fed, which sufficiently explains its origin
(See Darwin on the origin of kissing).
The display is very characteristic and interesting. The
female crouches on the ground with quivering wings and tail, and
beak raised. The male standing sideways to her grovels on the
ground, trailing his drooping wings ; he then throws himself on that
side which is farthest from the hen, the wing on this (the furthest)
side drooped and quivering, the other wing raised perpendicularly
and also quivering.
19th May. The female commenced to build in a nest-box
(not the same one). 2nd June. Female commenced to sit. 4th
June. When the female comes off the nest, the male takes her
place ; if he delays to do so, the female drives him to the nest.
13th June. Shells of two eggs carried out of nest. It is not
possible to inspect the latter on account of its position in the nest-
box, and the fact that the top of the latter is a fixture. 26th June.
One fine young bird looking out of entrance hole. 27th June. Mr.
A. G. Findeisen (a member of the F.B.C.) and myself watched two
young birds fly from the nest, and saw one or more in the box.
30th June. One young bird helping itself from the receptacle
containing live insect food.
5th July. Caught adults and young (four), and took second
clutch of eggs (four) and two addled eggs of the first clutch (which
therefore had originally consisted of six eggs).
I have no less than 18 eggs of this species, all laid in the
aviary. They vary considerably, both in size and marking&apos;s. The
smallest egg measures 77mm. in longest diameter, and the largest
86mm. The majority are densely freckled with light grey, but some
have a few purplish markings, and some a few pale brown spots.
Adult Plumage. The published descriptions of the adult
and immature plumage which I have seen being somewhat meagre
and even contradictory, I will add a brief description of a very fine
male caught in Central Europe. Length barely 7&amp;quot; (Saunders says

7.50 : a skin measurement probably). Wing 3.37&amp;quot; The tips of the
longest secondary and longest primary are equidistant from the
flexure. Tail 3.35&amp;quot; The margins of the lower and median coverts
white, forming two conspicuous bars across the wing : beak, quills
of flights and legs black ; crown, nape, chin, throat and upper breast
black ; forehead and sides of face pure white, the patch extending
backwards so far as to just barely divide the black area of the nape
from that of the upper breast. Length of the breast patch from
base of beak to base of patch 1.62&amp;quot; Back and rump a beautiful soft
pearl grey. Underparts and under tail coverts pure white. Tail jet
black, except the two outer rectrices on each side, which are white
except the basal half.
Saunders and Coues describe the flights as " blackish," but
this appears to be correct only as far as their outer margins are
concerned ; the primaries, except the first and second, are margined
on the inner side, as to the lower half, with white (in the immature
plumage with light grey), and the broad white margins of the
secondaries are very conspicuous.
Immature Plumage (twenty-sixth day). Wing 3.25&amp;quot; Tail
2.50&amp;quot; The margins of the lower and median coverts as conspicuous
as in the adults, but pale cream ; the two outer rectrices on each
side have less black on them than in the adults ; flights as above ;
the second, third and fourth primaries have the outer web emargin-
ated (the exact effect of this has not as yet, I think, been explained,
but it must impart special characteristics to the flight, as witness
the peculiar flight of the Tyrants, and the singular emargination of
the inner web of the primaries of this group) ; beak dark born
colour ; crown, nape and back grey, the feathers tipped with dull
buff: Saunders describes the forehead as "white, tinged with yellow,"
but these young birds had the forehead grey like the back; sides of
the face and the throat cream ; surrounding the throat patch a
crescent of blackish feathers of varying size and depth of colouring.
The young flew well immediately after leaving the nest, and
their tails flickered in the characteristic manner of the adults.
9th July. Released the adults and two young, retaining two
of the latter to settle a question connected with the spring moult.
In the evening I was delighted to see old and young flying about the

estuary of the Teig&apos;n in that state of freedom for which the Creator
created them, and from which I had ruthlessly snatched them, with
no better excuse than the fact that I had intei'ested myself in the
species.
General Remarks. Recent experience has tended to
support the conjecture, which I put forward in the above mentioned
article, that the reason that this species does not nest in this
country, is that its diet, and, in particular, the diet of the young,
consists almost entirely of winged insects ; although the Germans
call it " Weisse Bachstelze " (White Brook-leg), we may note that
it has not the same partiality for water and water-insects as its
first cousin, the Pied Wagtail, and is often found breeding in dry
districts, far from pond or stream. We also note incidentally that,
although we have been recently told that " Blackstart must mean
Blacktail," the abbreviation which those naughty German
aviculturists have introduced (" Weisse Stelze ") obviously does not
mean " White-leg." Lastly let us note that the White Wagtail is
the most difficult of the European Wagtails to domesticate: it is
essentially a wild creature--a creature of the wild, nesting on some
barren mountain side, by some remote Icelandic tarn, or on some
lonely beach lapped by a northern sea.
P.S.--I have many photographs of the nesting of this species
but the one selected, will, I hope, convey a suggestion to our friends,
the ornithologists, that it is not necessary to destroy life in order to
study the plumage of a bird, or to obtain a record of the same. My
assistant might with great advantage have made better use of his
nail-brush !

By E. J. Brook.
Just over two years ago I purchased from a London dealer
wdiat was admitted to be a job lot of Sunbirds. There were four-
teen of them, and there were hardly feathers enough on the lot to
decently clothe four birds, at least that is what they looked like.
None could fly and so branches had to be placed on the floor of

Mr. E. J. Brook,
their aviary. Two birds died soon after arrival, but nine out of
this lot are still living. The birds were so bare of feathers that it
was difficult to pick out the species at first, and, unfortunately they
nearly all turned out to be hens, but there were two males of C.
zeylonica, two males and one female of C. asiaticus, and the rest
were females of Zeylonica.
These birds all lived fairly peacefully together in an aviary,
12ft. by 7ft., furnished with living bushes and orange trees, till this
spring, when the strongest male Purple bird nearly killed the other
male. A few minutes' observation was sufficient to show that I had
a pair of Sunbirds wishing to nest, but what was to he done with
the others ? Risk or no risk, the mated pair must have the aviary
to themselves, so the rest were promptly turned into another com-
partment among a mixed lot, composed of Sugarbirds, Hanging
Parrakeets, &amp;c., where they have done very well indeed. The
mated pair of Purples soon set about looking for a suitable site for
their nest. The horizontal part of a long spray from an orange tree
was chosen, and to this the hen tried to fix some pieces of moss, but
seemed to find the bark too smooth to get a foundation. Noticing
her difficulty I twisted a little sheep's wool round the branch, and
to this foundation she wove a considerable mass of wool and moss,
but not finding it to her liking she pulled it all to pieces again. This
she repeated three times. I then cut a small piece from the bough
of a dead spruce fir and fastened it to the place the hen wanted to
build from. Nest-building now began in earnest, and soon a mass
of sheep's wool, looking like a large cobweb, was woven in and out
of the small twigs of the spray of spruce. To this web was woven
an untidy mass of wool and moss that hung down about six inches,
the end of w 7 hich was thick and bulbous and into which the true
nest was presently built.
At this stage I noticed that the hen was restless and again
threatened to undo her work. Seeing this and realising that if I
did not help in some way there was every chance of no nest at all.
I got some coir thatching cord, tied three lengths of about six inches
each to the branch, and arranged them in such a way that they
hung down with the mass of wool, touching it at three different
places. It was most interesting to see how the hen immediately

on the Nesting of Purple Sunhirds in Captivity. 329
took advantage of this, by weaving together the wool and the rough
coir fibre. I have said that the true nest was built into the thick
end of the hanging mass of wool. The hen made a small hollow
where she desired to make her nest, which was entirely built of
cocoanut fibre drawn from unravelled coir rope and lined with tow
and a few feathers. A few straggling ends of fibre projected in an
untidy fashion over the top of the nest and so formed a sort of
canopy.
During the building of the nest, which was entirely done by
the hen, the male bird paid surreptitious visits to see how things
were going on but was quickly chased away by his mate. When
the nest was finished, and even when the eggs were laid, he was
permitted a moment or two now and then for the purpose of making
a closer inspection, on which occasions he was allowed to perch on
the side of the nest and look inside. After these inspections,
surreptitious or otherwise, he always broke out into loud and
beautiful song.
The eggs--two in number--are dull white, oval in shape, and
heavily spotted with brown on the large end. The hen sat very
steadily and never minded being looked at, but unfortunately the
eggs were not fertile. One must hope for better luck next time,
but the results obtained show that the breeding of Sunbirds is
not out of reach.
A word on food is generally looked for in accounts about
birds. My Sunbirds get the same as all my honey and pollen-
eating birds now get, viz., unseasoned Marmite and Horlick's Malted
Milk sweetened with sugar. The Horlick is made very thin and the
two ingredients are given either mixed or separately. A little sponge
cake is crumbled into the food and is well licked over, but I doubt if
any is eaten. A certain amount of fruit is taken, especially soft
apple and grapes. I have seen some of these birds that have access
to insectivorous food picking that over, but do not know whether
they eat any. Of course any small flies or blight are eaten greedily.

By F. E. Blaauw, C.M.Z.S.
There is a mystery about a bird which however is familiar to
many; I mean the Black-shouldered Peafowl ( Pavo nigripennis)..
As is well known, there are two views about the origin of this bird.
Some say that it is a good species with Cochin China as its habitat.
Others maintain that it is only a variety of the common Peafowl
(Pavo cristatus ) originated in English parks.
The matter being of some interest to me, I have kept pea-
fowl of this kind in my park during the last twenty-four years, and
I have bred great numbers every spring. My object was to see if
Black-shouldered Peafowl would ever in any way throw back to the
so-called original form of Cristatus, thereby proving their origin. I
may as well sav at once that this has never been the case.
Black-shouldered Peafowl have invariably bred true, but
they have in some cases become variegated with white, and by
selection I have at last obtained pure white specimens of the kind.
Having satisfied myself that no amount of breeding would give me
Pavo cristatus I tried the following experiment. I bought a pure
white hen of the common Pavo cristatus and paired her with one of
my Black-shouldered cocks that showed some white in its feathers.
The result was four chicks which are adult now. They are two
cocks and two hens, and are neither Black-shouldered nor white
peafowl, but simply normally coloured Pavo cristatus. Now, if
Nigripennis is only a sport of Cristatus, one would expect that a
white sport of Cristatus would be the same thing as a white sport
of Nigripennis. So that a normally coloured or variegated cock of
Nigripennis paired with a white hen of Cristatus would breed the
same thing with that hen, as it would breed with a white Nigri-
pennis hen, that is either pure white birds or normally or variegated
Nigripennis peafowl.
Now this is not the case. The influence of the white
Cristatus hen is such that the result of the union is normally
coloured Cristatus peafowl, which show no sign of the Nigripennis
father. In the Zoological Gardens of London, Mr. Seth-Smith has
informed me that the pairing of a normally coloured Pavo cristatus

with a normally coloured Pavo nigripennis also resulted in a normally
coloured Pavo cristatus.
If one crosses two good species of birds, however nearly
related, I have always found that the chicks partake of the charac-
teristics of both parents. I must, therefore, come to the conclusion
that Nigripennis is a colour form of Pavo cristatus, in the same way
as the Blue Snow Goose is only a colour phase of the White Snow
Goose, and as I suppose the also mysterious dark form of the Golden
Pheasant ( Thaumalea picta obscurci ) is of the ordinary Thawnalea
picta.
Two years ago, in the London Zoological Gardens, Mr. Seth-
Smith bred chicks from a male Pavo nigripennis and a female Pavo
specifer. Three of these hybrids, a cock and two hens, which I
have in my park, have bred ; although the cock has not yet grown
his train. The result is three chicks, of which two are pure white
and one exactly like a Nigripennis chick. I am very curious to see
what will grow out of them, and whether they will in any way show
their mixed origin.

The Eulabetidce or Glossy Starlings are deservedly favourites
with aviculturists ; their intelligence, charming ways, and handsome
plumage making them an acquisition to any collection. During&apos; the
past ten years the writer has kept at least a dozen of these birds,
besides noticing as many more in various European Zoos.
The Green Glossy Starling ( Lamprocolvus chalybeus ) can
usually be obtained for about a pound or so at a dealer's. Plumage
lovely bluish green, shot with varying shades of purple ; eye yellow
or orange; legs and feet black. When in tight plumage the Green
Glossy Starling appears as if composed of burnished metal, the
glistening&apos; feathers being admirably set off by the bluish spots in the
region of the ear and on the wings. In its quick alert movements,

this bird resembles the common English Starling; its song is com-
posed of a number of harsh notes mingled with others of more
melodious nature. A specimen which I saw in Amsterdam several
years ago had a white feather on the breast.
Glossy Starlings soon become delightfully tame. In a few
days a newly-purchased specimen will take a mealworm from the
hand, or alight on one's finger. Several which I have had became
almost a nuisance from their fearlessness, flying towards one as soon
as the door was opened, and perching about in all kinds of situations.
Often they scrambled right inside the large tin which held the meal-
worms, and stood stuffing themselves greedily, swallowing worm
after worm in rapid succession. Earth worms were also taken,
battered repeatedly against the ground, and then swallowed. Newly-
born mice were also considered tit-bits, and disappeared in a twink-
ling down the red lane. These birds should not he trusted with
weaker species, even of the same size. I have found them, for
example, savage and untrustworthy towards smaller doves such as
the Cape Masked Dove (JEJna capensis).
Glossy Starlings are mischievous and fond of plaguing and
bullying their companions if possible. Milder birds are seized by
the tail and ignominiously pulled about, or the feathers are gradually
pulled from their heads by the officious, teasing starling. Amongst
themselves also a weak companion leads a sorry life, being violently
pecked and otherwise maltreated. In two successive summers a
pair which I had, amused themselves by gathering together dried
grass, etc. This they conveyed into a corner, though they never
made it into a proper nest. This species is fairly hardy and mine
have all the year round access to the open air. In November they
could be heard singing lustily out of doors, though the inner cage is
kept heated during six months of the year.
The Long-tailed Glossy Starling (Lamprotornis aeneus ) has
always appeared to the writer much more delicate than the previous
species. Out of many kept by him and seen in various collections
only two or three appeared to be in perfect health : lung troubles,
going light," &amp;c. always appear to carry them off. At Antwerp a
little while ago I saw five of these birds exhibited in a large cage ;
their temper seems more quarrelsome and uncertain than that of

the green species. A fine Long-tailed Starling in the writer's
possession was attacked soon after purchase by a cage-mate of
the same species. Blows were delivered on the back of the skull,
the beak of the aggressor being held closed and used like a pick-
axe. The unfortunate bird was at once removed, but gradually
became more and more drowsy, and died in a few weeks. With
small birds the mode of attack is to jump bodily upon the victim, as
if to crush the life out of him. Long-tailed Starlings employ a loud
harsh screech as a warning-call, signalling the approach of a cat or
other enemy. The song is not altogether unpleasing, and is delivered
from a high perch or a lofty bough in the outdoor flight. These
birds are imitative : my last Green Starling learnt to call like a cat.
Besides the two species mentioned there are many other
"Green" and Long-tailed Glossy Starlings. All my own specimens
throve well on bananas, mealworms, and German paste.

This is a very beautiful bird, the general colour being&apos; blood
red with a metallic green cap and metallic blue moustaches. Patch
of yellow on lower back ; wings dull dark brown ; abdomen olive.
It is about the size of the Amethyst-rumped Sunbird, but with a-

(Cinnyris afer).
A beautifully coloured bird and seems quite hardy but most
pugnacious. Sings beautifully and most tame. Colour : head, neck
and back intense metallic green; breast, brilliant scarlet, separated
from the green throat by a band of metallic blue ; underparts below
breast, olive ; wings and tail dull earth brown with yellow axillary
tufts, and the upper tail coverts metallic blue. Rather a smaller
bird than a linnet. * * *
THE LESSER DOUBLE COLLARED SUNBIRD.
(Cinnyris c lia lybeus ).
Very similar in colour to the Greater, with the green not so
glittering and the red on the breast only half as wide. He is a
smaller bird, being about the size of the Indian Amethyst and is
beautifully shaped and very tame indeed. Sings very prettily.
Hardy and easy to keep and they make delightful pets.
THE MALACHITE SUNBIRD.&apos; (Nectarinia famosa).
This is a much larger bird than any of the species described
above and most elegant and graceful. General colour metallic green
with black quills and bright yellow pectoral tufts. Abdomen glossed
with blue ; long tail with five inch central feathers. A very fine
songster and seems quite hardy and a very charming pet, and to
my mind the prettiest of all the Sunbirds I have seen. This bird
loses the metallic colour after the breeding season.
All my Sunbirds are kept in separate cages in a bright room
and seem very happy and well.
BIRD FRIENDSHIP.
By Katharine Currey.
Two birds -- of. very different species !--have claimed a nearer
acquaintance with us, a domestic cock (a white Leghorn), and a
Thrush. Every morning at cock crow, Chanticleer proclaims the
hour by crowing in the garden, which he enters by flying over a
gate. He walks round and then returns to the poultry yard. After
breakfast, he appears again at the garden-door, crowing to announce
himself and demanding his breakfast. He stands on the door-sill

and peers up to the dish that is ready on the table, then trots after
the bearer of the dish like a little dog. The presence of a collie does
not disconcert him in the least, for if ' Bruce ' joins the party to the
fowl-yard, the cock merely steps aside to let him go first. No more
is seen of this strange fowl till the afternoon, when, always about
4.30, he appears in the verandah and crows loudly, rushing round to
the garden door to see if the corn-bowl is likely to appear. He
escorts the bearer of it to the place where the corn is kept, peers in
to make sure that the bin really is being attacked, then rushes off to
a gate leading to the poultry yard, and calls the hens. He really is
what a Scotchman would call ' a proper nuisance,' but who could
hunt him away? He has just had a fierce battle.
The Thrush began to come up to the verandah when first he
had a nest and young ones in a yew hedge across the lawn, no doubt
hoping for mealworms which he watched the caged birds being
supplied with. From the verandah, he ventured into the house one
day by the garden door, and hopped along a passage into the
entrance hall, and across it into a room, taking no notice of the collie
who is always about. He comes now regularly at tea-time for cake
and bread and butter, and now the young Thrushes rush up to us in
the garden, taught to beg, no doubt, like the gipsy children!
The garden abounds with Thrushes, one with half the wing
white. I have vainly tried to tame a pair of Blackbirds, but beyond
building a nest and hatching out young ones low down in a creeper,
quite close to the garden door, they do not honour us with their
presence.
Our most faithful wild bird friends are the pair of Bobins
which fly in and out of the house all the year round ; and, during
the nursery days of their young, ' Tee-weekie-wee ' and mate have
sat on the top of the open window of the dining-room consulting
evidently as to the quality of the food they have helped themselves
to on the breakfast or lunch table. At breakfast, one at a time flies
in and perches on the ham or other dainties on the sideboard, or digs
its beak into the butter, always with the greatest boldness while
Prayers are going on and it knows it will not be disturbed. They
know their way about the house, and where the currants are kept
for the house-birds, and they follow us about the garden.

eightpence, wholesale market price. His price to us is not to be
counted, either in pence, shillings, or pounds sterling.
His history is lost in the tides of Calcutta Harbour. When
my husband's collection of Indian birds started on its homeward
voyage from Calcutta to Southampton, there was seen in the rigging
of the " Konigin der Nederlanden " a little grey-coated bird with a
black head and tail, white ear patches, red beak and pink legs, his
breast a soft dove colour. Only a Java Sparrow !
The collection was safely on board. Cage upon cage of costly
Sunbirds, Shamas, Minivets, Woodpeckers, Orioles, Flower-peckers,
etc.; many of them new to English aviculture, and any one of them
worth the weight in gold of the little grey man hopping gaily on the
rigging. A passenger looked up and saw him, and turned to the col-
lector, who had worked tirelessly for months to gather this collection
and who was taking a moment's breathing space. His valuable
birds were housed safely on board, and the labour of months close
to his hand, with only the journey home before him -- difficult
enough, and implying much work it is true--but the birds ivere there,
and granted the care and attention, the rest was on the knees of the
gods. " One of your birds is loose! " the passenger called to him.
Not for nothing has he collected birds all over India, in Aru --
New Guinea, in British Guiana, in Trinidad. Where the Sparrow
came from he did not know, but he guessed him to be tame and he
had a spare cage. " Hold out your finger and call him down " he
said to a lady standing by* The finger was held out and down came
our " Winkie," and before he knew wdiat had happened, he was
inside a little wooden cage, and his liberty was gone. What went
on inside his little black and white head during the long journey
home we cannot tell.
At Genoa, Mr. Astley and my husband met the ship, and
some of the rarer and the more delicate birds were removed,
either to be brought to England overland, or to find a resting
place at Mr. Astley's villa on the Lake of Como. The ship

was late in arriving at Genoa, and it was already dusk. The
interest lay in the Sunbirds, and the rare Woodpeckers and Fly-
catchers. Time was short, for the ship was to sail again at nine
o'clock that night. " Why in the world did you bring this rubbish
home?" asked my husband, standing beside the cage where " Winkie"
hopped and chippered on his perch, the walls of his prison close on
every side, the roof above him close down to the little black head.
The struck match had wakened him from a forlorn sleep, and he
jumped up and down, up and down, in his narrow cell, for pure good
fellowship. His story, such as it is, was told, passed over, and
forgotten in the greater interest of rare and precious birds that were
examined and appraised in the dim light.
Ten days later, my husband met the ship at Southampton.
There was a good deal to see to. The few deaths to record and
regret, the Customs House officials to placate, the specially engaged
guard's van to load up, and all the way to town the birds to feed and
water, and experiences to relate and to hear.
Small wonder that a worthless little Java Sparrow, who fed
on seed, and needed no patent foods, and no milk and honey to
revive him, was as one who had never existed.
Two or three days later, I came into the sitting room in our
hotel in London, just at the psychological moment when my husband
stood over the small wooden cage and lifted the sliding door that let
the grey man free.
I have no expert knowledge of birds whatsoever, but I have
a certain working knowledge, gained in the dark depths of ignorance,
including the intimate acquaintance of many birds whose Latin
names are unknown to me, but whose personal characteristics are
known and understood as those of friends. " Mary " and " John,"
our tame Blue Knorhaan of Bloemfontein days, taught me much,
and the rearing of young and ever hungry South African Mountain
Chats--and our friend the ' Dravelkie " (I believe he is called a
" Double-banded Courser)--all these, and many, many others helped
to educate me ever so slightly in the care and handling of birds.
As I write, I seem to be again in Bloemfontein, high up on
Naval Hill--and playing bridge at night in the hot weather. All
the doors and windows of the big living room thrown open to the

Mrs. Elizabeth Hobsbrugh,
wonderful African night,--the ceaseless " panging " of heavy beetle
bodies against the fly-screens, the scent of flowers mingled with the
acrid odour of the earth of Africa--and from the darkness without,
the melancholy whistle of my Dravelkie dominating the night.
Those who played with us will remember.
And I let my Dravelkie out one miserable day, and because
of a forgotten open door, we very nearly lost him for ever. Luck
was with me that time, and the " Dravel " came home with us, and
lived for many a day. But I have had a fear of open doors for my
bird friends ever since.
And so, on that morning early in May, when I came into the
sitting room, just as the little grey man poked his head out of his
prison cage, and gave one mighty dash for freedom, and flew circling
and chirping above our heads--I confess that my heart was in my
mouth, and I felt sure that whoever the stranger might be, we
should never catch him again. And the next minute he was on my
shoulder, dancing his little one step to his own particular " Robert
E. Lee ! " From that moment '' Winkie " became a personage.
I have seen tame birds, and very tame birds, and " absurdly&amp;quot;
tame birds, but never, never have I met with the equivalent kind
of tameness which is " Winkie's." It is not that he will come to
you. It is that he will not stay away from you. He is obsessed
with a love of human beings, and of them he has no fear whatsoever.
He is afraid of dogs, but man is his brother and his friend, and
without him, life would be a wilderness. I do not know how he
would behave if he had a wife; his own image in the looking glass
sets him wild with rage, and he wastes a great deal of time and bad
language pecking at his own likeness. He has intense likes and
dislikes, and very ill-founded they are ! My maid gives him food and
water, and tidies his cage daily. She takes him into her room when
we go out, that he may not be lonely, and she is more than kind to
him. He hates her! If he is flying loose, he goes for her like a
vicious dog, and with a very angry note he bites her hands. Dance
for her ? Not he! Answer her when she talks to him? Certainly
not ! Nibble gently at a finger placed between the bars of his cage ?
Not at all!--bite it and swear horribly instead! My husband
offended him deeply a few days after his arrival. For some reason

of his own he did not wish to come out of his cage at the exact
moment that the door was opened. The liberty was taken of
removing him, -- more or less head foremost. Again, for reasons of
his own--(not carried to any logical conclusion, as I can do
anything with him)--this wounded him in his inmost feelings.
Perhaps he thought the acquaintance not far enough advanced to
warrant such familiarity.
Be it as it may, -- the result remains in a relentlessly vin-
dictive attitude on his part. He has been treated with respect and
with the courtesy due from man to man ever since. He has been
courted ; he has been cajoled. The result is nil ! He will not make
it up. He will not be friendly, and he will bite and worry the
outstretched hand of friendship until, perforce, it is withdrawn.
We went off to Devonshire for a ten days motor trip, but on
our return, we found him just the same pugnacious little fury to one
of us, and the same gentle little friend to the other. I have done
nothing to make him like me, and it is always my task to put his
gently protesting little body back into its cage when we feel we
really must have the windows open again ! Frankly, I am flattered
at the attentions of this feathered scrap of creation ; but a nice
sense of the proportion of things is borne in upon me when I realize
that I share his affections with the hotel waiters. Hotel waiters
are his dearest friends, although he has also a weakness for early
morning housemaids. For these, he dances unbidden his very best
steps, and sings his cheeriest song.
But the ivaiters ! Let the door open and a heavily laden tea
tray appear, followed by the bearer thereof--and at the instant
" Winkie " has flown from my shoulder, straight as a die, to the
well oiled locks so tempting to his funny little soul, and is dancing,
dancing, dancing and singing his heart out in greeting. Carry a
slippery tea tray, over balanced by a tall hot-water jug, and try to
duck the onslaught of a little grey arrow shot upon you like a bolt
from the blue ! The effect is disastrous; and despite my now
instinctive dive across the room with outstretched finger, calamities
too agitating to relate have occurred more than once.
" Winkie " is curiosity personified. Everything in the room
must be investigated, and the heavy curtains at the windows falling

Miss A. Hutchinson,
in fat folds to the floor, provide interesting&apos; nooks for a sparrow far
from home. A newspaper thrown on the table and forming a tunnel
is a thing to be looked into very carefully, and native caution causes
much time to be wasted before the exploration is complete. Not
that he is afraid ! -- but it is all part of the game, and part too of the
morning curriculum, which includes surreptitious dashes at the fiend
in the looking glass, hasty return trips to my shoulder, and the
invariable unprovoked attacks upon his master.
In the evenings, if we are playing piquet, he sits on my wrist
and scrambles up and down it to keep his balance, with occasional
excursions on to the table, and possibly a sudden dive at his enemy's
fingers. Sometimes an annoying interest in the cards themselves
is displayed. Shuffling always makes him swear. If there is one
thing " Winkie " hates above all others, it is to be left alone. He is
discourteous enough to consider his master's presence as ' non est,'
and if I can get to the door unnoticed (which rarely happens), he
beats up and down it with much flapping of wings until I return.
But "Winkie" at his very nicest is " Winkie " asleep, his
cage turned to the wall; and in answer to my voice, and no other,

A BIRD YARN FROM THE SEA
B.v Miss A. HUTCHINSON.
On the 6th January of this year 1913, I sailed from Naples
to Natal, South Africa, via the East Coast; a far more interesting
route than from Southampton round the Cape, for, as the ship keeps
fairly near land most of the way, the chance of seeing something of
the tropical bird-life both of the sea and land, is much greater than
when travelling right out at sea.
All through the Suez Canal we were followed by small white
and brownish gulls, which seemed to me to be exactly like the pretty
little Mouettes (as the Swiss call them) which haunt the Lake of
Geneva all the summer and winter, but, with the exception of a few
which remain all the year, migrate somewhere else to nest. I should
so much like to know where they go, but have never found anybody

there who can tell me.* About July, back they come, and once
more the air is alive with their voices, asking for the tit-bit from the
paper bags which people bring down to the Lake to feed them with.
In winter they get especially tame, and will take bread from your
hand, but what they like best is to catch it in the air when it is
tossed up to them.
But to return to the East. I had hoped to see Flamingoes
on the banks of the canal, but evidently it was not the season for
them, for there were none to be seen. At Aden there was a great
variety of grey and brown gulls, some of them particularly large and
powerful. At every port we stopped at after that, the ship was
immediately surrounded by big brown Kites, so tame that you could
almost catch them as they swooped about after the bits and scraps
of food and refuse thrown from the galley, pouncing on the water
and sweeping up again with something very enjoyable in one claw
which was hurriedly eaten in mid-air. These, again, looked to me
exactly like the big brown Hawks which fish in pairs on the Lake
of Geneva, t
As we passed the Island of Dailak, I saw a very handsome
bird skimming over the waves, and from what I could judge, he
might have been about the size of a large duck, black on the back
and wings (which were very pointed) and pure white underneath, a
very short tail, and a large white beak. Could he have been one of
the divers ? Another bird which interested me very much was a
large fishing eagle, which kept flying to and from the bush at
Mombasa. He was very handsome with his gleaming white breast
and head and black wings and tail. " Them billy-kites," as the old
quarter-master called them, did not at all see the fun of it fishing
in their waters, for I saw two of them chasing it back to the
bush, but, nothing daunted, back it came again and even sat for a
moment on the rigging and defied them all.
We were anchored off Mombasa for ten days, so took the
opportunity of going for an hour's run by train to Mazeras, through

Miss A. Hutchinson
the cocoa nut and rubber plantations, and I must not forget to
mention the three bright scarlet birds, about the size of Magpies,
which I saw, flying together in the bush ; the flight was something
like that of a pigeon. I am sorry to say that I am very ignorant of
the names of the tropical birds found on the East African coast, and
would have been so glad to have had somebody with me who knew
them. Most of our passengers were coming out for big game shoot-
ing&apos; and seemed to know very little about the birds.
The reason for sending to the Magazine this little account of
my voyage to Natal--which I expect has been made by many of the
members of our Avicultural Society--was to tell of a bird incident
which happened when we were in the middle of the Red Sea. I
had just finished dressing for dinner, and was sitting up in the
writing room, when suddenly there was a whirr of wings and a large
bird flopped on to the floor almost at my feet ; it had evidently
been dazzled by the light, and had dashed through the opening from
the deck into the room which was just at the top of the companion
above the dining saloon. It was so dazed that it allowed me to pick
it up gently, and was quite passive while I examined it carefully to
see if it was hurt and also to see what kind of bird it was ; luckily
it was uninjured. I took it to be a very beautiful specimen of the
Common Tropic Bird, which I suppose is of the family of Terns,
judging by its two long white tail feathers, and I think I was right,
for it exactly answered to the description of one in E. J. Detmold's
" Book of Baby Birds," which, by the bye is a book worth having,
if only for the illustrations, which are beautifully done. Detmold
says " In appearance, the Tropic Bird is something like a Gull or
one of the larger Terns. He has a strong pointed bill, nearly
arched ; his plumage is of a satiny white with curved lines on the
back, while a few of his feathers are black, tipped with white.
The four toes are joined by a web, and his flight is more like that
of a duck, since he gives constant and rapid strokes of the wing.
He is able to soar without resting for longer than almost any other
sea bird, and it is said that he can pass whole days in the air with-
out needing to settle. He is a great favourite with the sailors who
give him the name of Boatswain on account of his shrill whistle.
The Tropic Bird builds no nest, but lays a single egg, generally in

the crevice of some cliff. He is to be found in all the oceans within
the tropics, and is about the size of a partridge, but his long tail
feathers make him appear larger. Another kind of Tropic Bird is
the yellow billed one--plumage apricot colour. Another is the
Roseate Red-tailed Tropic Bird, larger than the others."
My bird was evidently the common one : he had a stretch
of wing&apos; just over two feet, an orange coloured beak of two inches
long ; his legs were yellow and short and his feet were small and
black, rather wider than long, with short webs, answering to the
description in the book; the two long swallow-like tail feathers,
measuring six inches in length were pure white. He was in perfect
condition as could be seen by his large lustrous dark brown eyes,
and the beautiful satin sheen on his perfectly smooth plumage. He
caused great excitement among some members of the shooting party
who wished for his skin, and declared that I ought to give him up as
he was such a beautiful specimen ; in fact, so determined was one
man to get hold of the bird somehow that I had to smuggle him
down into the cabin, and keep him safely tied down in a big basket
lent to me by the chief steward. I had told them all that nothing
should induce me to give him up to be killed, but that I meant to
let him fly the next morning, as it was then much too dark to put
him overboard, especially as he still seemed a bit stunned from his
headlong flight into the lighted ship.
The next morning I found him quite lively in the basket and
took him up to the boat deck, as some of them were very anxious to
photograph him, and it was nice and quiet up there. We made an
impromptu back ground of a black coat which we hung up, and he
was as good as gold while I held him against it, his portrait being
taken by no less than five cameras. Afterwards he was carefully
examined and measured, which ordeal he stood splendidly. Then
came his reward ! I took him to the side of the ship, and with a
sweep of the wings he was gone, but just as he started he gave
himself a great shake as though to make sure he was really free. I
and two friends--bird-lovers like myself--watched him for some
minutes flying low over the crested waves like a big white swallow,
till be became hardly distinguishable from the foam, and finally dis-
appeared from view into the vast expanse of the ocean.

There are many artificial nests hung about for the birds, but the only
enclosed place for them is a small glass-fronted house, measuring 3ft. by ljft.
and 4ft high, the door of which is closed during the winter months, and to which
access is gained by a few small holes in the sides. All these birds have survived
the cold weather, sometimes 18* of frost, i.e. 14o Fahr.
I seem to lose fewer than many of my friends, and I attribute this to the
exercise the birds have. They are always moving about and have a frequent
supply of fresh water, grasses, fruit and blossoms, and, now and again, a few
mealworms.
My experience is that those birds which adopt a complete change of
costume are always the most combative, and I have therefore shut off the
Weavers, etc. All the other birds live harmoniously together and many breed.

\0x25A0 The Zebra Doves, Cutthroats, and Diamond Finches are breeding always,
and Mrs. Green Cardinal is for the third time the proud possessor of four beauti-
ful eggs.
The most beautiful of all birds in my opinion is the delicate little mouse-
like Bearded Tit, but unfortunately I cannot keep them.
There are several evergreen shrubs in the aviary, and in one of these the
Cordon Bleus are now nesting. Besides these shrubs I hang up many branches,
some without foliage and others of evergreens. There are earthenware basins,
which are filled twice or three times daily, in which the birds indulge at all hours
in free mixed bathing,
Altogether they are a very happy friendly family and give continual
delight to all our visitors. LILIAN NEWALL.

WILD TURTLE-DOVES NESTING IN AN AVIARY.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999822260869565" page_id="32655287"  page_num="Page 345" year="" vol="">
SIR,--In an orchard aviary we have several Barbary Doves--once loose
about the garden, but bird-catchers have forced us to cage them now,--and
these are perpetually laying and hatching, and with them in the aviary lives a
pair of common English Turtle-Doves, which have mated after being in the
aviary for years. The hen ever since I had her has been unable to fly, from a
weakness in her legs, but is otherwise healthy. The cock is younger, and arrived
on the scene two or three years later. He used to bow and " gurr " to her, but
his courting obviously bored her, and boredom is fatal to courtship ! Last month
I threw a handful of long grass into the aviary. Two days after, a little round
grass mat appeared in one corner on the ground, and the hen sat on it. I gave
them more grass, and the nest grew and became more cup-shaped. Now the
pair are taking turns in sitting on two eggs of which they seem very proud.
When I appear with the doves' food, and the cock is on, he gets off at once, and
runs up to his mate and says '&apos; Tchup ! " which sounds exactly like a sneeze.
She goes to take his place, but, I can see, finds it a little difficult to cover the
eggs, on account no doubt of her infirmity.
They and the Barbary's are quite friendly together, except when the latter
go too near the nest, when the cock Turtle Dove "fizzes " at them with the
curious little angry note so like a Jew's harp.
The colouring of the bright brown and soft grey of the -Turtles as they sit
by turns in their green nest under the nut trees, is quite lovely. We are curious
to see whether the young will be safely hatched, and whether the weakness of
the hen will be in any way inherited, that is if it is constitutional.

Since writing the above, a mysterious fatality has occurred with regard to
the wild Turtle Dove's cherished eggs. Suddenly they disappeared ! The aviary
is rat and mouse-proof in every part, except a stretch of wire-netting near the
door, which is f-inch mesh, not J-inch, and therefore not mouse-proof. Could
mice have devoured the eggs? Only then they would have left the shells. The
poor Doves ran about with startled eyes hunting for their eggs, and for several

days they continued their search. Meantime, in one nesting basket (the pro-
perty of the Barbary's) I found no less than twelve eggs, some fresh laid. The
thought crossed my mind, could the Turtles by some means have conveyed their
eggs for greater safety into the Barbary s' basket ? Then I dismissed the idea as
absurd, for how could a bird carry an egg, and if it could, how could the egg be
conveyed intact up to a high shelf under a roof? The more I thought about it,
the greater mystery it appeared to me.
I then set to work to remove the old nest, and I placed a suitable basket-
lid with hay in it, on the ground against a bit of south wall in the outer aviary,
and threw down several handfuls of long grass and moss near it, the Turtles
looking on. That same day an egg appeared in the basket-lid, and the hen sat
on it. Now there are two, the grass and moss has all been worked in with the
hay for a new nest, and the sitting is being proceeded with as before. The
Turtles seem to recognise my desire to help them, for they are not so shy with
me as they were. They are extremely intelligent, and so are the Senegal
Turtles, far more so than the Barbary and Java Doves.

THE STEAM ROLLER OF THE "FEATHER TRADE" IN THE
U.S. SENATE--A REMARKABLE SPECTACLE.
SIR, -- The American people are now being treated to the amazing spectacle
of the steam roller of the wild-bird feather trade being run through the United
States Senate in defiance of the appeals and protests of the bird lovers of the
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.975841578947369" page_id="32655288"  page_num="Page 346" year="" vol="">
United States. It is a case of about 30 importing millinery houses, a few
hundred milliners, and a strong lobby of New York lawyers against about 50
million American people. At present the steam roller is going overall opposition,
and the indications are that the program- of the wild-bird milliners is to be rail-
roaded through the Senate as a strict "party measure."
The friends and protectors of birds are striving to end, once for all, the
odious and cruel slaughter of the beautiful and interesting wild birds of the world
for the cash benefit of the millinery trade in America. The best women of
America do not want any more dead-bird hat decorations, and have appealed to
Congress to stop all such importations. The practice of bird slaughter for the
millinery trade is essentially barbarous and cruel, and it has now become odious
and detestable.
The Ways and Means Committee of the House inserted in the tariff bill a
clause designed to stop this odious traffic in wild birds' plumage. Ostrich
feathers do not come from wild birds. The movement has the support of many
bird-protecting societies of the United States, the State and National societies of
the United States, the State and National Federation of Women's Clubs, various
rstate game commissioners, and humanitarians generally. It is supported by 130
newspapers and magazines, and opposed by only one newspaper.

&apos; Many thousands of letters and telegrams have been sent to United States
Senators and Representatives, urging the passage of the Underwood clause in the
tariff bill, unchanged. The Underwood clause passed the House without
opposition, but one bird importer has said significantly: " You never would have
got that through the House if I had known of it in time ! ' '
The Senate is resolutely carrying out the program of the feather importers
who "want the money." The democratic caucus of the Senate, by a vote of 3
to 1, struck out of the tariff bill, except as to aigrettes, the lohole bird protecting
clause! The milliners' lobby of five New York lawyers has done its work well.
It is reported that one of its workers in Washington has said : " Those bird men
are not going to get another peep at the Senate ! ' '
Thus far not one good reason has been advanced by any senator, or
importer, for the striking out of our clause. The milliners' lobby is making no
campaign of public education or appeal. Some Senators claim to believe that in
voting to strike out our clause they are protecting the birds of the United States !
The idea is totally erroneous. Now it is stated that 1 ' Germany ' ' has made a
strong protest against our clause, because it would interfere with the trade in
wild birds' plumage that Germany has built up with our country; and it is
reliably reported that " the protest which the Senate Finance Committee
received from abroad evidently caused great concern, and led them to take the
action " which wiped out our clause at one stroke.
So then, while the Finance Committee obeys the behest of Germany and
the milliners' lobby, the friends of the birds are totally ignored ! In response to
our appeals, we receive the mystic formulas, '&apos; will-be-considered " and " will-
receive-attention." The Senate is, and all along has been, in full possession of
a mass of facts and details that show the deadly nature of the traffic in wild
birds' plumage for millinery. The Senators are not at all ignorant on this
subject. They have had the facts ever since last January.
Do you ask me why certain democratic Senators are against us in this
matter, and are deliberately and persistently defying the known wishes of the
American people? Frankly, I do not know. Ask them, and see if you can
secure a satisfactory answer.
The vote in the Senate as a whole is yet to be taken. Without the deadly
unit rule, I think that a majority of Senators would to-day sustain the cause of
the birds. This is now a world-wide fight. Two European nations are ready to
"clean house " as soon as England does so ; and in England the bird bill has
passed the House of Commons by a large vote. The fight is to an absolute
finish. As for ourselves, we will accept no amendments, and make no com-
promises of any kind with the enemy. We are going to insist upon our clause,
unchanged; and we hope that every friend of the birds will join in this fight.
Senators who are wrong are not invincible.
William T. Hornaday.

NOTES FROM BENHAM VALENCE, ETC.
One pair of Ruddy-headed Geese (Chloephaga rubidiceps) had three sets of
eggs--four in each one ; and all hatched, although not all were reared, owing a
great deal to lack of care in their not being provided with a constantly clear run
of short fresh grass, etc.
These Geese generally lay four eggs in a clutch, so that twelve fertile eggs
from one Goose is quite a creditable performance.

MISCELLANEOUS NOTES.
Mr. GOODFELLOW brought back from Chili, in July, some very hand-
some Pinches-- Plirygilus caniceps --of the size of Greenfinches, but of a finer and
more graceful shape. The male's head, wings and tail is a bright blue-grey, the
back and underparts being a rich ' old ' gold ; the female is much duller, but of
the same idea of colouring. They are very handsome.
There were also several Diuca Pinches, which have the style of a Chaffinch
about them, more especially of the Blue Chaffinch of Teneriffe, which they also
resemble in size. This finch has been imported before now. The male is pale
grey with a white throat : the female a brownish grey. Both species are to be
found in Chili.
There is a pair of Sun-Bitterns in the aviaries at Benham Valence. These
birds are invariably tame and confiding, and when they open their wings, spread-
ing them widely towards the head, look like gigantic moths with rich and
variegated tints of mottled chestnut, white and brown. A fine piece of nature's
embroidery.

This is perhaps the most beautiful of all the known Rock-
Thrushes, and is an inhabitant of different parts of the Himalayas,
frequenting rocky and stony districts. This bird is rather less in
size than the European P. saxatilis, and is a glorified edition of the
latter. In captivity it is naturally tame.
I have two males, but the one hen bird unfortunately died
in May of this year during my absence in Italy.
The true pair was imported by Major Perreau, and the single
male by Major Boyd Horsbrugh. When the new feathers are
assumed in August and September, each one on the back is broadly
edged with light brown, which will no doubt wear off before the
spring, leaving the mantle more uniform blackish-blue.
These Rock Thrushes have a very swift and graceful flight.
When let out of their cages in a room, they will dart to the top of a
cupboard or picture-frame, the white spot on the wings showing
conspicuously. Any idea of a move being made by me to the meal-
worm-box will bring one down with swift and silent wings to my side.
The feathers of the head have a more powdered appearance
immediately after the moult, becoming purer cobalt blue later on, but
I have yet to discover whether these Rock-Thrushes undergo an
almost complete vernal moult, as does P. saxatilis and also apparently
P. erythrogaster.
The song, as far as I have heard it, resembles that of other

By Maurice Amsler, M.D.
On April 7th of this year I turned out from their winter
quarters into my small finch aviary three Blue-breasted Waxbills and
a hen Cordon Bleu. The former I knew consisted of two cocks, and
a hen; they soon settled down amicably, one of the cock Bluebreasts
obviously having plighted his troth to the hen Cordon Bleu.
On June 10th I found a typical spherical nest in a privet bush
and on the 15th it contained four or five eggs and one of the Blue-
breasts was sitting. It never entered my mind until later that this
bird was the Bluebreast who had mated off with the hen Cordon
Bleu. On July 5th, I found that three eggs had hatched out, the
young birds being about half-fledged.
About this time I added to the aviary a cock Cordon Bleu
who was the means of my discovering the mixed parentage of the
young bird. Immediately he had got over the surprise of once again
seeing sunshine, trees and grass, he made up to the female Cordon
Bleu, who treated him with absolute contempt whilst her blue
breasted mate knocked his would-be rival off his perch and chased
him round the aviary. I then noticed that the Cordon Bleu hen's
tail was bent to one side, as occurs with all long-tailed birds of this
genus after sitting for a few days.
I watched carefully and soon found that she was feeding the
three chicks already mentioned. Even so, she might possibly have
been feeding the young of a true pair of Blue-breasted Waxbills, but
on July 11th, the day before the three hybrids flew, I found in
another bush a similar nest containing eggs and being incubated by
the other cock and hen Bluebreasts ; their eggs are fertile and, I
believe, have now hatched.
The nest is rather high and I cannot examine it again with-
out causing a good deal of disturbance.

The young hybrids closely resemble Blue-breasted Waxbills
which I have bred before ; they are, however, perhaps a trifle paler
in colour. Cordon Bleus have the iris of a reddish-brown colour
and the beak has a distinct pink tinge. In the Blue-breasted Wax-
bills the iris is dark-brown and the bill is horn-coloured ; the latter
species are moreover half-inch longer and, of course, considerably
brighter in body colour.
It will be interesting to note later which parent the hybrids
favour, and more especiallv to find out whether they are capable of
reproduction. I am hoping to get another brood this summer, which
will increase my chance of securing one or more breeding pairs for
next year.
I have marked the hybrids with numbered rings and shall
turn them out in an aviary by themselves so as to avoid all chance
of confusion with either of the parent species.

so I shall not be able to comparo the gradual attainment of body-

The Luck of an Expedition That Set Out to Solve the Primary
Problem of Breeding Wild Ducks in Captivity.
Several years ago when on a scientific expedition in Saskat-
chewan we secured eggs of various species of wild ducks. A number
of these, supposed to be fresh, I carried some 2,500 miles in the
cars and set under hens. Most of them proved to have started in
incubation and were spoiled. Two incomplete sets, however, that
were absolutely fresh, hatched, but the young died owing to improper
food. Since that time much has been learned about the feeding of
wild ducks in confinement.
In many respects this field is uncommonly attractive. Though

Mr. Herbert K. Job,
most kinds of wild ducks are readily kept in confinement, very few
of them have been made to breed, so far as is generally known.
Birds of these species in parks or preserves are usually trapped or
wounded individuals taken in the adult state. Though outwardly
tame, they usually show no inclination to mate. I have held the
theory that if stock hand-reared from the egg could be secured, it
would probably prove tame and contented and would more readily
breed. From such beginning&apos;s it might prove possible to restore
some of the species that have mostly vanished from the eastern
part of the country.
The desired opportunity to embark on this line of research
and experiment came to me this season through the liberality of
certain gentlemen who, like myself, are keen over this problem of
the wildfowl. Ample funds were donated whereby as Ornithologist
of the Storrs Agricultural Experiment Station under Federal auspices,
I was enabled to organize a Government expedition to the Canadian
Northwest, the purpose being to bring back eggs or young of as
many species of wild ducks as possible, to study methods of feeding,
rearing and breeding and to give the results to the public in Bulletins
of the Experiment Station.
Now, on the very face of it, doesn't this sound like a crazy,
ill-considered scheme, to send out a party at large expense into
a wilderness entirely new to the leader, and expect him, not
only to find the cunningly concealed nests of the various kinds of
wild ducks with their diverse habits, but to hatch out the eggs
artifically despite the prevalent idea that wild duck's eggs cannot be
moved or touched without spoiling them, rear the wild little creatures
that no one had ever raised before, and then to bring back the
delicate things safely through five days of slambanging in the cars--
a journey of some 2000 miles ! Nevertheless, the outcome in this
case justified the risk--as this article and the sequel will show.
The plan of these articles is to sketch the adventures and
achievements of the expedition, leaving it for the Bulletins of the
Experiment Station to present the full detail and the further working
out of the various problems.
Through unavoidable delay the expedition was unable to start
until June thirteenth, 1912, which was dangerously near the hatch-

ing period of most of the ducks. In addition to the subsequent
hiring of local help, I engaged as assistant of the expedition my son,
George C. Job, of the present Junior Class of Yale University.
Proceeding via Montreal to Winnipeg, we outfitted, selected
under the best advice the ideal locality for operation and I secured
the necessary permit upon presentation of proper credentials as a
representative of our State and Government. The laws of the
Province of Manitoba relating to game birds are very strict. Accord-
ing&apos; to the reading of the law, such permits are issued only to "other
States or Governments." I found the local officials most courteous,
however, and fully alive to the need of the preservation of the game.
The field selected for operation was the immense marshes at
the southern end of Lake Manitoba. Here there is an inlet from
the great lake which broadens out into a vast area of shallow water,
dozens of miles long and several miles across. It is a forest of tall
canes, reeds and rushes, intersected by all sorts of hays, ponds,
creeks and canals, a maze and labyrinth in which it is hard not to
get dangerously lost. In spring and summer it is a wild duck para-
dise, one of the greatest of duck breeding-grounds. On the first day
of September it becomes a duck inferno, when hundreds of guns
from far and near are turned loose on the unfortunate wildfowl. By
October additional hosts have descended from farther north, and the
number of the ducks is said to he amazing.
On June twentieth we took train to a station farther west,
where we were met by a guide with a big double rig. We needed it,
too, for with incubators, brooders, etc., there was much more stuff
than one wagon load. Leaving some of it for another trip, we
started on the long jog north over the trail. The region was one of
flat prairie, with belts and patches of low poplar and willow timber
and brush, known in that country as " bluffs."
It seemed refreshing to meet the prairie birds again--upland
plovers, Western meadowlarks, prairie horned larks, the coursing&apos;
Franklin's gulls and black terns, the grebes and coots paddling in
the small sloughs and various others too numerous to mention.
The country is almost entirely unfenced and unimproved, just
about as it was when the buffalo herds roamed over it. We passed
a few log cabins, and in the afternoon came in sight of a little group

of cottages standing&apos; out on the level prairie. These were shooting
lodges, used by duck shooters in the fall. The owner of one of them
I had met in Winnipeg, and he had with true Canadian hospitality
offered us the free use of it for our scientific quest, which I was
happy to accept.
Comfortably ensconsed, for about six weeks we got our own
meals and lived pretty much in regal solitude, monarchs of all we
surveyed. The guide lived over a mile away, and in the dim distance
we could see a few more little homes scattered over the great plain.
Half a mile back and more were scattered bluff&apos;s of low timber, while
out in front, and close at hand, lay the great marsh which was to
become our field of activity. x4 ditch or canal had been dug in from
the nearest main waterway through the forest of aquatic vegetation,
so that the hunters could paddle their canoes almost to the doors of
their lodges. Two of these had tall flag-poles in front, on which
they hoisted lanterns at night to guide bewildered ones back to
camp. A nice canoe, ready for our use, lay on the shore at the end
of the canal.
Before describing the actual work of the expedition, it may be
of interest to have a few words of general description. The climate
was typical of the North-west prairies, mostly cool and bracing, with
frequent heavy showers and occasionally severe heat. One Sunday
afternoon the mercury on the west side of the house registered 113
degrees. Next Sunday it was 47 degrees, a raging easterly storm.
The saying current out there is that they have three seasons--July,
August, and Winter. Of course, mosquitoes were abundant, but we
were too busy and interested to mind such small annoyances. We
did growl some, though, at the weather, which was pretty bad for
rearing ducklings and even worse for photography. Sometimes I
thought I should hardly get any pictures at all.
The few inhabitants of the region are interesting. They are
the descendants of trappers for the Hudson Bay Company who
intermarried with the Indians. They do little farming, being content
mostly to hunt and fish, raise a few cattle, and act as guides for
sportsmen. Proud and extremely sensitive, they are very friendly to
those who treat them well. They certainly were most kind to us,
selling us milk, eggs, butter, bread, and the like. Fondness for

liquor is their great weakness. The Assistant at one time went
over to a Sunday-school picnic to which they drove from near and
far. There was a series of athletic events, and he was persuaded
rather reluctantly, to enter a number of them. To his surprise, he
won every event. At the close he was rather scandalized to find
that a lot of them had taken to betting on him and had won con-
siderable money !
Close to camp was an interesting historical relic in the shape
of a circular trench with a series of separate pits inside it. After
the Minnesota Indian massacre in the sixties the Sioux fled up here,
pursued by U. S. troops. Our Government offered bounties for
their scalps, and the chase was taken up by the Red Lake Indian
warriors. Near a timber bluff in sight of our lodge the latter
surprised the Sioux, and massacred their women and children. The
bucks fled, and, digging&apos; the trench and rifle pits mentioned above,
made their stand. Again the Red Lakes surprised them when,
after quite a siege, they had fallen asleep, exhausted. More slaughter
ensued, and the surviving bucks finally took to the marsh and
escaped. There is a local tradition that one of them, whose arm was
broken by a shot, held his thumb in his teeth to keep the arm from
swaying, and ran fourteen miles to safety. He settled in the region,
and was said to be still alive.
Early on our first morning we launched forth on the mazes of
the reedy labyrinth, taking the guide along to show us the lay of the
region. After this, for the most part, we managed to find our own
way in the marsh. Occasionally we got puzzled, but always managed
to find the way out. As we paddled through the tall canes away up
over&apos;our heads from one channel to another, each one almost
precisely similar, it was easy to realize what care must be exercised
by the stranger who ventures out alone.
Soon also I realized the great possibilities of the place. At
this season one does not, as in fall, see clouds of ducks. They are
scattered out in pairs to breed, but are frequently in evidence.
Turning corners, we would come upon a pair of ducks, or a
single one, unexpectedly. Others were frequently passing overhead,
especially parties of males. Blue-winged teal were often seen, and
also pintails, gadwells, mallards, redheads, occasionally the lordly

Mr. Herbert K. .Job,
Canvasback ancl others. Now and then a quaint little male ruddy
duck, with its amazing sky-blue bill and forehead and rich-hued
reddish hack, peculiarities of the breeding season, would suddenly
emerge near us from the depths and dive again on the instant. The
same "stunt" was frequently being performed by Grebes, of various
kinds--pied-billed, horned, Holboell's, and Western.
Mud-hens or coots, Virginia rails, soras, yellow - headed
blackbirds, red wings, and long-hilled marsh wrens were also in
evidence with various sounds to contribute to the marsh chorus.
Black and Forster's terns were yipping angrily and darting at our
heads as we paddled unwittingly near their nests. Very enlivening
it all was, especially when a female redhead swam out from the
rushes ahead of us, leaving her nest. Hasty search did not reveal it,
so we noted the spot for further and successful effort.
Presently we emerged upon a considerable sheet of water, a
couple of miles across. Grebes were there a-plenty, swimming
about. Here was a fish-net stretched between stakes. In it were
entangled numbers of fine big pickerel and pike, and also I am sorry
to note, various unfortunate grebes. Out on the open hay were
some lesser scaups or blue-hills, and also several pairs of the big
white-winged scoters, sometimes called sea-coots, and other ducks
as well.
I desired at the outset to find some dry areas in the marsh, or
islands where ducks are likely to breed in concentrated numbers,
which would save much time and labour. The guide told us there
were no islands, hut that there were a few ridges along the shores of
certain bays and channels where the land rose slightly above water
level. One was out ahead of us, across the hay, along a channel.
Paddling over to it, we found the shore moist, hut above
water overgrown with land vegetation, especially nettles, thistles,
vines and all sorts of weeds, truly delightful stuff to struggle
through !
The Assistant and I, however, started in with eager
expectancy. The upland strip was only a few rods wide, and we
undertook a systematic heat, for at any spot a duck might be con-
cealed upon her nest. If we covered the ground thoroughly, and
stepped close to her, she would flutter away and reveal her secret.

Hunting Duck Eggs in the Marshes of Lake Manitoba. 357
In this sort of work things happen suddenly when they
happen at all. With long boots pulled up for protection, we beat
it " along&apos; for some distance, when things began to happen, and with
celerity. Suddenly a blue-winged teal sprang into the air only ten
feet ahead of us. As we searched for the nest in the thick growth,
the assistant made a surprising discovery. He saw two big flesh-
coloured eggs buried in the black mud, with just the upper sides
projecting.
I thought at first, as we dug them out, that they must be old
eggs, left over from last year. Then, as I got them into view, I saw
my mistake. They were fresh scoters' eggs, and this was the habit
of the bird, as I had previously learned, to bury the eggs in the
ground till the set was nearly complete. Then the duck builds her
nest and lines it with down plucked from her breast. Such buried
eggs as I had previously found were always in dry soil.
Putting the eggs back, we soon found the teal's nest a few feet
away with only four fresh eggs, an incomplete set. The nest was a
mere depression with a few weed-stems, the downy lining as yet not
being added. These nests we marked by tying knots in the reeds.
Hardly had we started on when up sprang another duck, almost in
my face. Its brown neck, white wing-bars, and moderate size
proclaimed it a lesser scaup. The dark olive-brown eggs she left
bore out the identification. Holding up to the light one of the nine,
I saw that the degree of incubation was moderate, probably about
ten days. This nest we also marked and left, as it was our plan to
postpone as long as possible being tied up in camp with incubators to
watch.
After this we had quite a tramp before finding anything else,
almost out to the other bay. There the guide had previously flushed
a pintail from her nest on the hank as he paddled past. Though it
proved to be empty I hardly had time to grieve before I almost
stepped on a pintail on her nest, only a few feet from the original
site. She had evidently been robbed, and started a new set close by
There were but four eggs, a fresh incomplete set.
I have found that ducks frequently nest in groups or colonies.
This was again borne out when, only a few yards beyond this spot,
we flushed another blue-winged teal from a set of eleven. Little

Mr. Herbert K. Job,
use, though, were these to us, for they were all rotten and smelt
strong enough to draw the blue-bottle flies. Two weeks later I found
the foolish duck still sitting upon them.
After lunch the nettles across the creek looked more inviting,
and in fact various other ducks' nests awaited us there. However, we
left them for another day and pushed the exploration. A colony of
Western grebes were nesting in the canes growing from the water at
the mouth of the creek. Parents were swimming about with young
on their backs. I photograped a little fellow that fell off and was
caught. Then we made a long detour to the head of the bay, dragged
the boat over a rocky ridge, and were in another big lead of water.
Female canvasbacks seemed quite numerous here, hanging around as
though their young had hatched out. We searched for nests among
the tracts of rushes, where they are accustomed to build, hut the
depth of water made progress slow, and we found nothing.
On beyond here we came across two colonies of the Franklin's
gull, with nests built on the floating dead rushes. One colony was
small, but in the other there may have been a thousand birds, which
gave us pretty exhibitions of screaming and hovering.
We returned to camp about 5 p.m., and I immediately started
out for a tramp on the prairie, as there were yet four or five hours of
daylight in the northern latitude. Though I happened upon no
more ducks' nests, I found a bobolink's, as usual with a contribution
from the cowbird parasite that abounds on the prairies, and lays one
or more eggs in the nests of nearly every small bird. It is surprising
that any escape paying toll, and it usually means the destruction of
the brood. I also found a crow's nest with young, and, better yet, a
nest of the short-eared owl, in which the female had just laid her
first egg. The male flushed first and hovered over me, screaming
angrily. Then I hunted up his nest near by amid a clump of low
bushes. Later they had six eggs.
This description of the first day&apos;s hunt will give a good idea of
the work of the first few weeks of the expedition. Sunset was at
8.45 p.m. We hunted all day, and had supper any time from 7 to
10 p.m., according to circumstances. Then came the writing of notes
and journal, and, rather late, the changing of photographic plates, as

it was not dark till after 10 o'clock. So we seldom got to bed before
midnight, and were up and at it again in good season.
After we had, in general searches, found eggs of most of the
common varieties of ducks, we concentrated our efforts on finding
the scarcer or more elusive sorts that were lacking. We offered a
series of rewards for being shown certain nests, and we ourselves
hunted hard. For example, there was the ruddy duck. Three males
were constantly seen in a pond of the marsh close to camp. I had
searched for hours and days without result, wading through the
labyrinth of aquatic vegetation.
Finally, on Sunday afternoon, June seventh, as I went down
to the slough after a good rest to have a look, I saw a female ruddy
with eleven young swim out from the rushes. This made me
nearly frantic, and I resolved to find a nest next day at all hazards.
Starting in bright and early, before a great while I had found a red-
head's and a scaup's nest, from each of which the young&apos; had recently
hatched. Then I plunged into an awful tract of rushes and canes.
The stuff grew away up over my head, and the dead growth was like
a solid wall, the water being over knee deep.
I was nearly exhausted struggling through the stuff, when I
received a thrill that dispelled every trace of weariness. There,
right before me, lay a ruddy's wicker-basket of rush stems, with
eight eggs showing. Upon investigating further I found three more
eggs beneath them, buried under a false bottom to the nest. The
nest itself was built under a great mass of dead stems with these
arched over it. My theory of this double nest was that one pair of
ruddies fought another and drove them away from their nest, which
they then appropriated, building a second story over the eggs. The
defeated householders then seemed to have removed and built
another nest near by, for within an hour I found another nest
about a hundred yards away in the same tract with four eggs,
which might have been the remainder of the first set. The first
nest, unfortunately, was deserted and the eggs spoiled. The eggs in
the second were only four days from hatching, so I was just in time.
The white-winged scoter also gave us a hard tussle. That
incipient set found the first day was abandoned. The scoter is the
last of the ducks to lay, usually not laying all its eggs till about the

Mr. Herbert K. Job,
first of July. Here they nest in under the terrible tangles of nettles
and other growth. Every day it was getting taller and more dense,
but it was useless to hunt before incubation began. So, early in
July, I instituted a series of the most arduous, sweat-wringing
tramps. On July fourth as I was struggling through the jungle all
of a sudden there arose a tremendous flapping right at my feet. I
had almost trodden upon a scoter on her nest, a few feet back from
the edge of a creek. Off she flopped into the w r ater, and I had her
nine nearly fresh eggs.
Next day I was at it again. Leaving the canoe on the shore
of a bay, I tramped four miles away. Then I landed a set of blue-
winged teal, fresh, even at this late date. Five minutes later, in a
tract of tall marsh grass, I heard a rustle close beside me, and saw
the grass move. Throwing down my hat to mark the nest, I made
a dive for the scoter, and caught her before she could reach the
creek. This nest contained eight eggs, nearly fresh. The parent
bird rested quietly under my arm, as though not in the least afraid.
All of a sudden she gave one tremendous push and flop, and left me
most unceremoniously ! Just then there broke a big thunderstorm
that had been coming up. The electrical display was especially im-
pressive to one alone and unsheltered out in the wilderness.
Not every day, however, did we score a find. The wilderness
was so vast and the ducks so scattered that this nest hunting was
almost like the proverbial quest for the needle in the haystack.
Sometimes days went by without the finding of a single nest, despite
the most arduous efforts. At one time we hired a rig and drove
thirty miles, steering by compass over the prairie to Shoal Lake, a
large alkaline body of water, without outlet, surrounded by timber.
The lake was very low from drought. The adjoining marshes were
baked, and the ducks had mostly abandoned them. All we got for
our three days' effort was one set of gad wall's eggs found on a little
island. Also, on another island, I took photographs of a brood of
four funny, fuzzy little long-eared owls, whose home was in a timber
"bluff." Returning to camp, we started the incubators, and col-
lected up the sets of eggs previously found.
Our activities disclosed the fact that there were twelve species
of wild ducks regularly breeding in the region, namely : pintail,

shoveller, mallard, gadwall, baldpate, blue-winged and green-winged
teals, redhead, canvasback, lesser scaup, ruddy duck, and white-
winged scoter. I also saw two or three hooded mergansers, one
bufflehead and one solitary specimen of our Eastern dusky or ' black"
duck. The latter here reaches about its Western limit. In a-
quarter-century of shooting our guide had seen but six.
The locations here chosen by the various species were as
follows : Redheads, canvasbacks and ruddy ducks nested out in the
deeper water in the thickets of rushes, or sometimes the cat-tail
reeds. The scaup occasionally selects such location, but usually has
the nest on real ground--usually the bank of a creek, an island, or
some ridge of land out in the marsh. This was true also of the
scoter--the big fellow that our Atlantic coast gunners call the
" white-winged coot," and consider to be a strictly maritime species.
These five kinds are distinctively deep-water or diving ducks..
The other seven, "river ducks," so called, seldom nest out over the
water. We found their nests on the drier spots in the marsh, on
islands, or on the prairie, usually near the edge of the marsh or some
smaller slough, yet sometimes quite a distance from water. Fre-
quently they nest quite near human habitation. We were shown
several nests close to the homes of settlers. One was close to a.
schoolhouse, a gadwall's and was found by a little girl at recess.
One foolish pair of blue-winged teal built their nest close to
the front door of the unoccupied cottage next to us, under the step of
which resided a family of weasels. However, they managed to hatch
their brood of eight on the morning of our departure July twenty-
ninth, showing that incubation did not begin till the first week in
July. x4 number of similarly late nests were found, probably second
layings, the first having been destroyed by thieving crows.
Most of the ducks normally begin incubation the last week of
May or the first in June. Some mallards and pintails lay early in
May, though we found some sets much later. Most of the canvas-
backs and some of the shovellers finish their sets by the middle of
May or soon after. On our arrival broods of all these four had
hatched, some few being quite large.
Of the above twelve resident species, we secured eggs or
young of every one. We hatched the eggs in one kind of incubator,

with splendid results, hatching 92 per cent, of the total number of
egg&apos;s. Few poultrymen, even under the best of conditions, which we
surely did not have, attain such an average. The ducklings, too,
were reared with encouragingly little loss. On the 2,000-mile
journey hack I attended the consignment personally in the express
cars, taking sole care of the interesting and almost priceless little
fellows, and landed all but a few tiny ones safe at their destination.

This charming little bird has been placed by several authori-
ties among the Weavers, though it has the habits and appearance of a
Finch. I express no opinion about the matter. Dr. Butler quotes
Russ as saying that it had " only once been imported '' into
Germany, but in my edition (1878), he says " very rarely imported."
A small consignment reached this country in 1907 from which I
obtained two examples--unfortunately both females.
It is a handsome little species, measuring, in length over all,
4&apos;38&amp;quot; : wing, 2'12&amp;quot;; tail, E50&amp;quot;. The nape and back are a delicate
mouse-grey, almost dove-colour ; on the forehead a patch of small,
narrow-pointed, black feathers with white margins (which give the
species its popular name) ; primaries blackish-brown ; tertiaries very
showy--deep black with broad white margins ; tail ditto, except the
outer rectrices ; underparts white ; beak and feet, pale flesh-colour ;
conspicuous black moustachial streaks ; 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th
primary emarg&apos;inated.

above, the Zoo obtained one male. Mrs. Galloway also had one
male and I had two females which laid several clutches of eggs and
incubated with great perseverance. I endeavoured to put matters
straight by asking the Zoo to exchange their bird for one of my hens
and whatever young the pair might produce, but they would not
oblige me. I then suggested to Mrs. Galloway that we should toss
up, the winner to have a pair, but she said she would not care to part
with her bird and would much prefer to purchase one of my hens; so as
it seemed a pity that the species should not be bred, I sold her a hen.
With this pair Mrs. Galloway won Firsts at the Crystal Palace and
elsewhere, but no young were reared. The Zoo lost their bird
within three weeks, hut my remaining hen lived in my aviary for
three years and was then sold to an exhibitor.
Last winter a much larger consignment was imported into
Germany, from which I obtained a pair, but the long cold journey
was too much for them. I then obtained three more, which arrived
in fairly good order, but one bird insisted on roosting in the open
flight one stormy night and paid the penalty. The two survivors
were apparently hens. I have had such dreadfully bad luck with new
purchases during the past year that I almost decided not to give more
hostages to fortune ; however, I felt so sure that this species would
prove a most desirable addition to the list of birds really suitable for
English aviaries and only needed a fair start, that I finally purchased
a " remainder " of half-a-dozen specimens. The result has confirmed
my anticipations. This charming little bird has proved as easy to
breed as the Zebra Finch and it is as hardy as it is handsome.
Haagner tells us that the Scaly-fronted Finch breeds " in
autumn " (which would of course be our early spring) ; Stark says
that on the Orange River they build in March and April, on the
Limpopo in June and July. My first brood flew at the end of May
at which time most of the adults moulted ; the second brood on the
16th June. The third brood came to grief, the male being killed by
some Euler's Finches on the 15th June, when the young were only
a few day's old, and the female did not rear them. A fourth nest
produced only one youngster which flew on the 17th July. At the
present time I have three nests containing eggs or young, so that I hope
to have a sufficiently large series by the end of the season to introduce

Mr. W. E. Teschemaker,
this little bird to English aviaries with a fair chance of its becoming
permanently established and self-reproducing. Several visitors have
seen the earlier broods on the wing, though I only seem to have
made a note of one name--Mr. G. Coates, of Coventry.
I have 21 eggs of the Scaly-fronted Finch in my cabinet.
They are quite unlike those of any other species with which I am
acquainted, being so densely overlaid with brown and dark greyish-
drab blotches that it is impossible to distinguish the ground colour of
the shell. Size, '65&amp;quot; by '50&amp;quot;.
The Scaly-fronted Finch is one of the most enthusiastic
architects of all the dome-builders with which I am personally
acquainted ; when it strikes a dull day and cannot think of any
other amusement, it sets to work to build a nest ; even an unmated
bird will complete a nest in a couple of days. Haagner tells us that
they are very common in the mimosa scrub along the Modder
Kiver, building an untidy dome-shaped nest of grass, woven with
" the ends projecting in all directions and lined with the flax-like
" flowery heads of grasses and feathers." This accurately describes the
many bush-nests which I have seen built (and I may add that I have
seen as many as four such nests in one small bush), but let me here
point out an important difference in habit between this species and
the Weavers. The first article of faith of this little bird is that " a
Scaly-fronted Finch's home is his castle " ; garden-colonies, semi-
detached residences and fiats he greatly disapproves and, if any
neighbour starts house-hunting in his immediate vicinity, there will
be a battle royal (which in one case ended in the death of a fine
male). Frequently, however, he will select a box, as in the
accompanying photo (if the Editor can find room for it), and, in that
case, he builds an undomed or only partly domed nest warmly lined
with feathers.
The young in the nest are most curious little objects, having
large warts of pale cream-colour at the angles of the beak. The task
of feeding a family, which seldom is less than four and sometimes
six in number, is a heavy one, but I may perhaps venture to point out
to those who are not too deeply imbued with the ancient methods of
aviculture, that the task can he greatly lightened if insect-food is

liberally supplied. Perhaps in this connection I may be permitted
to tell you a little story.
Once upon a time, long long ago, a pair of Zebra Finches
nested in a garden aviary. In due course four little Zebra Finches
made their appearancs. But the father of this flourishing family was
of a roving disposition and one day he squeezed himself through a
very small hole into the adjoining division of the aviary. Having
achieved his greatest ambition he was disappointed to find that the
unknown land was not all his fancy had painted it. He turned to
come hackbut, alas, he had forgotten the " Open, Sesame." So he
flew up and down calling loudly to his wife and family, whom he
had left to look after themselves, until at last he attracted his owner's
attention. Then came the first tragedy. It was nearly dark and his
owner clumsily hit him with the rim of the net ; he fell to the
ground and his life-blood stained his white waistcoat.
The brave little mother did not desert her family ; all day
long she flew to and from the seed tin, digesting hard seed for them,
and in due course they left the nest. But every day she grew weaker
and weaker, because her digestion could not stand the strain. The
owner saw the second tragedy coming ; he supplied boiled seed,
soft-food, green-food--everything in fact except the one thing which
alone could have averted that tragedy ; he was not neglectful, simply
ignorant. The day came when she flew to the seed-tin for the last
time ; on the way back she fell to the ground from sheer
exhaustion. Then her starving family gathered round her, pressing
closely against her and calling piteously for food. Even in her death
agony she could not disregard that call. Once she tried to feed them
--twice she tried ; then her eyes filmed over and her spirit flitted
back (as we will hope) to that thirsty land where the wattle blooms
and the eucalyptus sheds its perfume. Then came the third tragedy ;
all day the four young ones, huddled together on the ground, called
vainly for food ; when the evening came, there was silence.
Then the aviculturist wrung&apos; his hands and asked himself
what he ought to have done. No one told him, but, in course of
time, he found out and said to himself--" What a fool I have been,
what a fool ! " and he made a vow that, when an opportunity
occurred, he would strike a blow for the better way of aviculture. At

366 on Nesting of the Scaly-fronted Finch,
length the psychological moment arrived : someone (in a weekly
paper) actually tried to persuade the unwary beginner to attempt
to induce insectivorous birds to rear their young on farina-
ceous food. Then he spoke up and, although he was involved
in a somewhat acrimonious correspondence, it is within his
knowledge that he did good. The acrimony was unfortunate,
but anyone who tries to wake up aviculture from its long
slumber must be prepared both to give and take a hard blow;
he will not find it an easy task. Now if any unwary beginner should
read these lines, let him, for once in a way, disregard the advice of
the Food-specialist and the Expert, and take the advice of a fool,
who is at least wise enough to realise his own folly : let him treat
all hard-billed birds during the nesting season as either wholly
insectivorous, or as insectivorous plus vegetarian, species, and I
think he will not regret it.
The young Scaly-fronted Finch, when he leaves the nest, is
remarkably like an adult ; the black areas on the wings are duller
and the wider buffislr-white margins of the secondaries make the
wings look lighter ; the moustachial streaks are smaller and
narrower. The only conspicuous point of difference is in the mark-
ing of the forehead ; where the adult wears the scaly feathers from
which it derives its popular name, the immature bird has a small
patch of brown feathers. It also lacks the black area between the
beak and eye.
The call-notes are " soo-sook " ; " chit-chit-chit."
P.S.--The upper figure in the photograph is the male of the
pair illustrated : notice his large moustachial streaks, from which
the species obtains its German popular name, Schnurrhartfink
(Schnurrbdrtchen, Russ,) ; notice also his bent tail, from which it
may be inferred that he has been recently incubating. Both sexes
share the duties of incubation. This species is by no means easy
to sex and it is generally safer to take the style and demeanour of
individuals as a guide rather than the plumage. The young
show the first few scaly feathers on the forehead about fourteen
days after leaving the nest.

By A. G. Butler, Ph.D.
In an article which I published in our Magazine in April,
1910, I expressed my conviction that birds when properly looked
after live longer in captivity than when free, and I think the evidence
which I brought forward in that article, and one which appeared a
year later, fully justified that conviction.
Since April, 1911, I have added very few birds to my collec-
tion and some of my dear old friends have departed this life, so that
my present series consists almost entirely of birds which, like my-
self, might be generally regarded as in the sere and yellow leaf; but
who, to all appearance, are still as active and feel as young as their
master.
1 think I cannot do better than frame this article upon the
pattern of the two previous ones, and therefore I will begin with the
Grey-winged Blackbird : * still in excellent health and
plumage after eleven years : the rascal slipped out of his aviary (as
I stooped in the doorway to change his food) a few weeks ago, and
I had to fetch a net and threaten to catch him with it before he
would return to his quarters.
The Shama, after more than nine years in my possession, is
in admirable condition.
My female South African Mountain Chat continues in
perfect health, but rather annoys me by dropping charmingly coloured
eggs to destruction from the perch every spring ; they are not unlike
small models of those often laid by the European Blackbird. By
the way, my old colleague Mr. W. R. O. Grant seems to think that
eggs laid in captivity must necessarily be abnormal: some years ago
I gave an egg of Petronia clentata to the British Museum collection,
the eggs of that species not being previously represented in the series.
In the recently published fifth volume of the Catalogue of Birds'
eggs I note the following remarks :--" The only egg of the Lesser
* My English Blackbird is still perfect in health and plumage after nearly
eight and a half years.

Dr. A. G. Butler,
Rock-Sparrow in the Collection was laid in captivity and is, no
doubt, abnormally coloured.&apos;'
I strongly suspect that the above conclusion was come to in
consequence of Shelley's statement that eggs found in a Weaver-
bird's nest by Heuglin were white. Both P. dentata and P. albigu-
laris laid many eggs in their cage but broke all but two ; all the eggs
were alike and characteristic of Sparrows : on the other hand white
eggs are not rare among the Ploceidoe, and I have no doubt whatever
that the eggs found by Heuglin were either laid by the builder of
the nest, or by some other Ploceid finch which had taken possession
of it. I have preserved a good many of the eggs produced in my
cages and aviaries and they are quite typical of the species which
laid them.
Chinese Bulbul. I thought I was going to lose this old
friend last winter: he became careless of his appearance, bedraggled,
dirty and with many broken feathers ; he suffered from diarrhoea,
was too weak to fly more than about two feet and was altogether
disreputable and miserable; then suddenly one morning, like the
*Jackdaw of Rheims when the curse was removed, he became sprightly
again, had a good wash, grew a fresh crop of feathers and is now as
w T ell as ever after more than fourteen years in my possession.
ARCHBISHOP Tanager : given to me by our Editor and still
perfect in health and plumage after nine and three quaiter years in
its flight cage.
SCARLET Tanagers : my two males, which always fight as
each breeding-season comes round, are still in excellent condition
after over sixteen years in their flight.
CHINGOLO SONG-SPARROW. The bird mentioned in my last
paper as presented to me by Mr. Teschemaker is quite well and lively
after five years in its aviary. Last year it paired up with a Tree-
Sparrow, hut no nest was built and I found no trace of eggs.
Tropical Seed-finch. This bird, which was presented to
me in November, 1907, died on the 14th February, 1912.
Fire-RED Finch. Presented at the same time as the pre-
ceding bird, but still in excellent health after over five and a half
years.

GOULDIAN Finch. The cock bird born in my aviaries in
1905 is still in fine condition after eight years.
Long-tailed Grassfinch. Also alive and well after eight
years : it is a close companion of a hybrid finch sent to me by
Mr. Sich.
Zebra-finch. The last of my series died last year at the

Java Sparrow. A cock bird over sixteen years old is still

Napoleon Weaver. I still have the same collection of
these birds as recorded in my previous paper. As I have never been
without the species since I first purchased a pair, it is probable that
at least some of my half-dozen examples were purchased in 1900.
GRENADIER Weaver. Still in splendid condition ; six and
three quarter years.
Red-Billed Weaver. One cock still living after eighteen

COMMON Hangnest. Both still in perfect health and con-

English Jay. Poor old Jimmy went off unexpectedly after
one day's illness at the early age of thirteen. I felt that I had lost
an old friend : his big flight-cage is now, I believe, doing duty as a
glorified rabbit-hutch : it cost me about twenty shillings to build and
I parted with it for one shilling: a nominal payment often makes
the purchaser value an article more than if it were given.

A few birds have been given to me since I published my last
paper on this subject, hut some of these were evidently almost played
out when they came into my hands and have since joined the
majority : I have also bought five British, and one foreign, birds :
the most interesting being a very brightly coloured Liothrix lutea,
approaching the Chinese type and mentioned in my recent paper
upon that species ; it is becoming&apos; riskily tame, and I am constantly
in dread of its escaping when I enter the aviary where it is.

By John C. Phillips.
Early in 1912 two pairs of Prairie chickens (Tympanuchus
americanus ) were received from the West. Owing to lack of room,
one pair was confined to a small movable pen, while the other had
the run of rather a large low cage built in a secluded spot in the
woods. Its dimensions were 25 ft. by 12 ft., and it was 3oft. high.
On May 12th the male from the more fortunately situated
pair was heard booming, a very interesting sound, but all attempts
to view him failed, as approach to the pen was rather noisy.
By May 15th booming was quite constant, and I was able to
get a good look at the performer.
On June 12th the hen bird was found dead, with a nest-full
of ten eggs, all of which were placed under a brooding hen. The
diagnosis, made by Dr. L. E. Tyzzer, of the Harvard Cancer Com-
mission, was amoebiasis with peritonitis. The male bird died two
days later and was found to have been suffering from the same
disease.
On July 9th or 10th, five chicks hatched from the ten eggs.
Three died after short periods, but the other two were coaxed along,
although they were very feeble at first and required constant care
and feeding. They had a large space to themselves with a very
amiable bantam hen.
One of these two chicks lived only for a week, but the other
survived and prospered. He was extremely active and showed
an omnivorous taste, pouncing without discrimination on all sorts
and sizes of insects, moths, butterflies and grasshoppers. He was
fed on scalded house-flies and chopped worms, besides an ordinary
pheasant diet, and in time grew extremely tame ; in fact I never
saw a tamer bird. Anyone could pick him up, and when tossed in
the air he would flutter down near one's feet. He was never pinioned.
No definite notes were taken as to assumption of plumage
and behaviour, but I well recall that the youngster had a rather
monotonous whistle, somewhat like that of a young turkey, which
he frequently practised while perched upon his brooder coop.

A Prairie Chicken.
The photographs show him at different ages. He died Sept.
20th, but as I was absent from home no autopsy was made.
I eventually lost my other pair of old birds, which might
have been saved if a large portable pen had been kept for them and
shifted frequently to new ground.
Dr. George W. Field, of the Massachusetts State Game Com-
mission, last year raised one Heath Hen (Tympanuclius cUpido ) from
eggs collected wild on Martha's Vineyard Isle. Out of four which
he hatched, one died, two escaped and one is still alive.
Mr. Wallace Evans, of Oak Park, Illinois, kept some Prairie
chickens in a yard which he writes me was somewhat too small.
He collected, however, a number of eggs which hatched well, the
chicks being strong and healthy. They remained with the hen until
six or eight weeks old when they 11 suddenly and mysteriously dis-
appeared."
This is all I can gather as to the behaviour of Prairie chickens
in captivity. It is meagre enough and yet I think something might
be done, with care, patience, ground free from amoeboid infection,
and a goodly supply of money.
Mr. Evans might be able to get a few pairs for anyone in
England who was interested, but the experiment would hardly be
worth while unless carried out on a considerable scale.
It might be of interest to add the autopsy report for the pair
of birds which produced my eggs. I quote it verbatim from Dr.
Tyzzer's letter of June 21, 1912 : --
Adult female .--' There is no marked emaciation and nothing
of note externally. The peritoneal cavity contains thin reddish
brown fluid. One coeca presents several lesions measuring from 0'2
to 0 7 cms. in diameter, of grayish yellow colour, over which the
mucous membrane appears to be intact except over the largest
lesion, where the surface is eroded. These lesions are distributed
over about 6 cms. of the blind extremity of the coeca. The liver is
diseased throughout. The lesions are sharply defined with opaque
slightly elevated edges marked with bright red, sometimes scattered
and sometimes as a zone within the peripheral opaque zone. The
surface within is dull brown, slightly grayer color than the unin-
volved liver. The fibrinous exudate is adherent to the surface of the

lesions in certain portions of the liver. The small intestines and
other organs appear normal.
Stained sections show large numbers of amoebae in both the

The male bird, which died shortly after the female, showed
much the same conditions. The disease must have been acate, as
there was no emaciation in either individual.

I use the above words in a widely different sense to that in
which they were used by the sorely tried Peter Quince, but it is a
fact that the use of various artificial foods for rearing game birds
has become so common that the value of gentles seems in danger of
being overlooked; in some cases, I think, to the detriment of the
would-be rearer.
A few years since, Mr. St. Quintin (than whom few people have
wider experience of game birds) wrote to the Magazine asking for
those who had tried the use of gentles to record the result. This
season I determined to give them a good trial, not only on young
birds, but also on some old Tree Partridges with a view of bringing
them into breeding condition. I have on more than one occasion
written to the Magazine about Tree Partridges, and pointed out how
they can easily be kept on grain alone in a run devoted to Tragopans
or other pheasants ; indeed, under such conditions, I have found
them thrive with practically no attention, though, of course, they
could not be expected to nest successfully. This Spring I put a pair
of common Tree Partridges ( Torqueola ) in an enclosure by them-
selves, and my other pair of these birds in an enclosure with two
hen Rufous-throated Tree Partridges (Bufigularis ). I fed all the
birds freely on gentles in addition to grain, and the result was, I am

Mr. C. Babnby Smith ;
satisfied, highly stimulating ; possibly too much so, as will be seen
from the number of nests built and discarded.
First, as to the pair of common Tree Partidges in an enclosure
to themselves, they made one of their curious domed nests as early
as 10th March. This nest was as usual a hollow scooped out in
the earth and an enormous mass of grass and litter built over it
with an opening at the side just large enough to admit the
bird. The entrance to the nest is often blocked up with litter
when the nest is not in use. Snow spoilt this particular nest, but
another was made within ten days and two eggs laid in it. This
second nest was then deserted without apparent reason, and there-
after, until the end of May, at least eight more nests were made and
pulled to pieces by the birds themselves with surprising' zeal and
alarming lack of discretion. The rapidity with which a new nest
would be made was wonderful. Both cock and hen would work as
if their existence depended on getting sufficient material together in
a couple of hours, and what they could do in that space of time
w y as incredible. Nine eggs (possibly ten) were laid altogether, seven
of them were fertile and several got broken. I do not think the
deserting of the nests can be attributed to my interference, because
although when I saw what was happening I took the eggs from time
to time to hatch in an incubator, yet a new nest was several times
made, or the old nest destroyed, before I took the eggs. The birds
were not shy about their nesting operations.
Now as to the other four birds. The two Rufous-throated
hen partridges joined forces and built endless nests from mid March
to early June, laying I think not less than fifteen eggs ; all unfertile.
Many of these nests somewhat resembled those of wood ants in
Norway, as the birds used great heaps of pine needles in default of
sufficient grass. I have had these birds for some years but never
knew them so active in nesting. The two common Tree Partridges
in this run never paired (though in splendid condition), but the cock
for two months would whistle plaintively for a couple of hours,
morning and evening, in a way I have not previously known. At
the end of May, thinking the breeding season was over (and lacking
space) I put the breeding pair of partridges with the four other birds,
with the result that the unpaired cock was promptly killed, the un-

paired hen half scalped, and the two Rufous-throated hens continued
nest making and egg laying, aided vigorously in the former process
by the surviving cock, but the eggs were not fertile.
As to the chicks from the other run : six were hatched alive
and, with the exception of one killed by accident, all thrived
amazingly, being fed mainly on gentles as I could not obtain fresh
ants' eggs. For the first few days the gentles were scalded in boiling
water and the birds fed by hand, and afterwards living gentles, well
cleaned in dry sand, given. Custard was also given in the early
stages. The birds refused Spratts' Partridge Meal, and although
confined in a small area on stale ground, I never knew birds thrive
better. The incubation period for these birds is twenty-four days.
I have also mainly used gentles this year for rearing young
Crested Tinamous and found the result very satisfactory. It may be
argued that these birds are easy to rear, or that the season has
been favourable, or both ; but I have not lost a single young bird
from disease, and at early stages the birds took more readily to
gentles than to artificial food, and grew very rapidly. The difficulty
I have had with my young Crested Tinamous--which were from
time to time hatched in an incubator and afterwards placed under a
hen to rear--was to get them to answer the call of the hen. They
seemed (unlike the partridges) to have no conception of this, and
would neither come readily to be brooded or fed for at least a week
after hatching&apos;. In one case, the hen, possibly being cosmocentric in
her views, got so disgusted at the young birds' conduct, that she
started to kill them all after a few days time ; luckily another hen
of more benign nature was at hand, and all ended well.
The habit of Crested Tinamous is to lay eggs on every high
hill and under every green tree in their neighbourhood, and as the
eggs are grass green and often partly covered they are difficult to
find. During the first week of July, the cock Tinamou collected
three eggs into a small depression under a little Scotch fir, made
several experimental trials in sitting for half-an-hour a day before
he ultimately commenced to sit steadily, and, as the reporters say of
the House of Commons, " was left sitting at the time of our going to
press."
The incubation period for Crested Tinamous is 21 or 22 days.

By Major and Mrs. Boyd Horsbrugh.
It seems somehow decreed that when I am travelling it
should always be my fate to have birds with me. I have brought
birds home from South Africa on three occasions, from America two
or three times, and from various parts of the earth, a cage or two
has always been part of my luggage.
It is all very well, in our little island, to feed and water your
birds before you start and to put them in charge of the guard while
you sit comfortably in a smoking carriage. But on a journey of
days, down the long rolling Karroo where the train crawls its thump-
ing clanging way at fifteen miles an hour, until you swing down the
winding curves of the Hex Biver Valley, and Cape Town lies at your
feet at last;--or across Europe, with days and nights to pass before
even Calais is in sight--the problem then is a very different one.
And so I travel in the guard's van ; strictly forbidden it is
true on all railways and in all countries, and many and varied are
the experiences I have had.
In 1906 I came down from Potchefstroom in the Transvaal to
Cape Town, bringing with me a large consignment of Violet-eared
and Black-faced Waxbills, Lovebirds, Melba, Quail Finches, Weavers,
Chats, Bobin Chats, and a crowd of other birds.
It is a weary journey, especially to one who has often made
it (once during the war I did the greater part in a covered coal truck);
and the way by Fourteen Streams to Kimberley and De Aar and
then through the everlasting Karroo to the Cape, becomes one dread
nightmare of dust and glare, changing at nightfall it is true to the
wonderful colours that are the glory of Africa.
" Slowly the desert changes."
On this occasion I travelled for the first day in luxury, as I
had a deck chair set out and an empty guard's van all to myself.
I had moreover a sympathetic guard, who was greatly interested in
my birds and who helped me to sort mealworms, to cut up fruit and
to concoct the various messes so well known to any aviculturist.
At night I went to the dining-car in the front of the train and
then to my sleeping-berth. This was all very well, going through

the Transvaal and the Orange River Colony, but it was a long train,,
and when we came to the Hex River Mountains, I forgot--or had
never known--that the train would be divided into two ; and sitting
unconcernedly in the guard's van, I saw to my disgust the front
part of the train pull out of the station, bearing with it my bed and
my dinner.
There was nothing at all to be done. I thought of many
impossible schemes ; searched vainly for food in the few minutes left
to us at the way-side station in the desert, and finally plunged back
into my guard's van, hungry, furious and perfectly helpless !
I slept in the chair and ate some of the birds' over-ripe fruit
for dinner, but when, on the following day I missed my breakfast
and luncheon (seeing them steam off in front of my nose each time)
I was more than exasperated.
At this point I sat down and composed a telegram which
made all the station-masters down the line sit up and take notice,
and just before dinner as that wretched front half of the train was
again moving off, I did a desperate sprint and got on board.
I had a few brief words with the guard and then got my last
three meals all in one, and made up for lost time.
The guards on the South African lines are usually English, or
of English-speaking parentage, and are easily dealt with as long as
they are decently treated. I have many pleasant recollections of
them and many long talks and discussions stored up in my memory.
As the train ' clumped ' clumsily down the long reaches from
the high veldt to the sea, my guard and I discussed the affairs of the
nations. Men long from home questioned me hungrily, interspersing
bits of personal narrative.
" What pay did the guards get now on the S.E.? and the
engine drivers ? Tom Hog&apos;ben 'e went crazy one day driving 'is

" But I wouldn't go back now. I've got used to this country

describe 'im, but 'e sings beautiful and I thought you might know."
But I didn't know.
In May of this, year, 1913, I travelled from Genoa overland
to Calais bringing with me about 60 birds. The Italian guard was
a revelation. In his own home no doubt he is an estimable father-
of-family--anxious over the bambino's first tooth, insistent on
Maria's first communion ; an only son perhaps--and kindness itself
to the old mother with whom he and his wife and the children all
live amicably together.
On his own train it is another story. He is a creature
objectionable in the extreme. He gapes for tips as a young cuckoo
gapes for food, and is just as insatiable. How I hate doing English
Hedge-Sparrow to an Italian Cuckoo ! Furthermore he has as many
brothers as an Indian servant, and all of them, in some mysterious
way, manage to control and to do, totally unnecessary jobs and have
to be tipped accordingly. My birds and I paid for Maria's outfit and
contributed largely to her dowry.
The French guards are of two kinds. The first is very "red-
tapey " and won't let you travel in the van at any price--he won't
even take a ' pour-boire,' but if tactfully approached he will fall to a
cigar -- a good one is quite unnecessary as nearly all French cigars
are villianous, so I kept a special brand of very long black ones.
They smelt like burning seaweed and were much appreciated.
The second tpye of guard is the perfect gentleman ! and he is
also the one more usually met with. He does his best to help, talks
all the time, is joyously enthusiastic and generally has many stories
with which to enliven the journey.
The guard's van in France is usually just behind the engine,
and in it there is a sort of conning tower, much like that of a sub-
marine. From the raised seat inside it one looks right over the
engine on to the line close ahead, and at first the view is rather
alarming. As a motorist one is accustomed to slow up for corners
but the train just rushes blindly at them and tears round with a
shriek from the whistle. It was not until I remembered, with a
sigh of relief, that trains run by signal and have a clear road and a
right of way, that I got over the feeling that there was sure to be a
donkey cart round the corner into which we were bound to crash.

I felt at home with my last guard. Again we discussed the
time-worn European situation ; we grew into brothers and friends
over Alsace Lcnraine, and as the train flew its corners, its whistle
screaming to the heavens, we talked of aviation and branched off to
motor bandits.
I have come to mistrust such catch words as " The Entente
Cordiale," but in this case I believe there is much more in it than
the words convey. That " much more " being borne home to me in
the guard's van !
Dover,--sober and grey, and a home-grown Kentish guard
twenty-five years on the railway, brought this journey to an end.
But short as it was, the two hours run to town was full of interest ;
and again, in the intervals of feeding and discussing the birds in my
care, we talked of the things we both knew and of the land we both
called our own. In this case it was bounded narrowly, for Northum-
berland and Devon were a whole world away. Nevertheless we
were at one.
And I count it not the least of my experiences to have
travelled often and in many lands with the guards in the guard's
van.

My breeding results have not been very good this year. A pair of Malabar
Parakeets (Palceornis columboides ) laid two eggs, but they did not hatch, and I
rather think they were not fertile. A pair of P. docilis had three nice young ones,
but deserted them. I found out afterwards they had been too much looked at.
These were followed by two young cyanocephalus, one a rickling. They were left
unobserved till old enough to take. The rickling died in time. The survivor is
a nice sturdy bird, and a pair of Diamond Sparrows had five eggs. Two
hatched but were found dead. They have another nest now (August).
A VISIT TO AN INTERESTING COLLECTION OF "SOFT-BILLS."
SIR, -- Through the kindness of my bird-dealer's wife, I recently spent a
most pleasant afternoon visiting the varied and excellently-kept collection of
Soft-bills, which a customer of theirs makes his special hobby.

young nestlings, he is ably assisted by a relative of his, who is most successful in
this difficult branch.
The doctor has mostly native (that is indigenous birds), but some African
and other tropical " Insectivorous " as well, all in splendid condition. As far as
my memory serves me. I have noted down the Portuguese birds that most
attracted me.
A handsome " Papa-Figos " (Oriolus Galbula of Linnceus), two
Nightjars, various Shrikes, a Melodious Warbler, a Rufous Warbler,
Nightingales, Blackcaps, Hoopoes, Jays, a Crested Wren, Crested Larks, a
Russet Chat, Robins, an Owl, and a " Great Bustard," Blackbirds, a Crow, also
a bird about the size of a Blackbird, with brownish mottled plumage and quite a
wig of long black feathers on his head, very tame.
The doctor told me this kind is quite common here even among the hills
round Lisbon, but did not know its name. These are all of the native birds I can
remember.
Further, there was a beautiful 11 Metallic " Blackbird from America,
" shot " as it were with blue and green tints, shining through its black plumage:
very striking. Also a number of little gay African mites, whose names I cannot
enumerate.
Among the 11 Insectivorae " there were a few " graminivorous " kinds,
such as a pair of Bleeding-heart Pigeons, a pair of Zebra Doves, some
Goldfinches and Canaries, etc. My bird-dealer's wife tells me that this
gentleman is almost the only real amateur among their list of customers. Many
keep a few cage-birds as pets, but are not in any sense Aviculturists," and
the majority purchase chiefly poultry, pigeons, etc., for purely utilitarian
purposes. CHARLOTTE E. IVENS.
P.S.--The "Cuchicho," i.e., " Galandra Lark," is very common here
(Portugal), but I did not see it represented in the above collection.--C.E.I.

THE NIGHTJAR.
SIR, --The following story with reference to the power of ventriloquism
possessed by this bird may be of interest to your readers. For some days in
June I had heard a curious bleating sound, and thinking it was caused by some
very young calves, as no lambs were near my house, I asked the shepherd if it
was so. He replied that the peculiar sound came from a queer bird in the sky and
that I was not the first person to ask him this question, as only the previous year
a man had stopped at his cottage to tell him that there was a lost lamb bleating
in the meadows and he told him that it was none of his and there were none
around. Upon which the man determined to find out for himself from whence
the bleating came. In vain he searched the field, a rough marshy meadow,
hearing the sound continually near, and then far off, until at last he saw a bird
rise from the ground, and only then was he convinced there was no lost lamb.

Last June, in broad daylight, at mid-day, and for nearly a week, I have
seen a Nightjar soaring round the meadow in circles and each time that it
swooped downwards that curious note seemed to rise out of the ground first on
one side and then on the other at my feet. Having read that the Nightjar, when
perched lengthwise on a bough, had the power of throwing his voice in various
directions with each turn of his head, I was searching in the hedge and on the
ground and it was some time before I discovered it circling in rapid flight
above me.
Is it usual to be on the wing at mid-day ? And was it soaring over its
mate on the nest, or is this daylight flight, its joyful welcome on first arrival to
its summer haunts ? Knowing so little of the habits of the Nightjar I should
feel grateful for any information.
A Water Ousel or Dipper has for a few years built its nest against the
dripping rock and under a waterfall within full view of my house.
This year the nest was robbed, whereupon the bird promptly built
another within a few feet of the original spot.
These notes are the personal obrervation of my sister, Mrs. Mather.
E. Dorothy Leeke.
THE SEED SNIPE.
SIR,--I was very interested to read the account of a pair of Common Seed
Snipe (Thinocorus rumicivorus ) that our editor has been fortunate enough to
procure. I knew these birds well when camping out in the Andes above Mendoza
from the altitude of 10,000 to 13,000 feet.
We used to meet with one other but much rarer Seed Snipe, D'Orbigny's
{Thinocorus orbignyianus ) which was only to be found in the most utterly
desolate valleys, at 12,000 up to 14,000 feet, always like the common variety,
feeding in some damp spot. When on the ground amongst the broken rocks
they are extraordinarily difficult to see.
When flushed both birds utter a sharp cry several times in succession.
They look rather like moths with their quiet jerkey flight.
For some time I could not make out a noise that would often continue all
night round the camp : a sound somewhat like a frog's croak without the rough
notes. At last I found it to be the common Seed Snipe, but was never sure if it
called while flying to and fro, which is what it sounded like. The sound is at
any time very difficult to locate, at first appearing far away and at the next
moment at one's feet.
I should think that they would do well in a dry aviary with a damp sandy
spot in it. I never found them except in a swampy place. Even when they had
young a day or two old they were always in some such spot.
In the winter when the mountains were snow and frost-bound I found
the common variety in flocks round the town of Mendoza in the plains.

NESTING OF THE GREAT TIT.

<bodyText confidence="0.99884685" page_id="32655338"  page_num="Page 382" year="" vol="">
Sir, -- I was interested to read Dr. Amsler's account of his success, on
which I congratulate him. The changes of policy of our Society are also very
interesting.
I well recollect that our late most excellent Editor, Mr. Seth-Smith,
several times impressed upon me the fact that medals would only be awarded for
articles which appeared first in our Magazine, and Mr. Bonhote even suggested
to me that my account of the nesting of the Blackcap might not qualify for a
medal because I had quoted some sentences which I had written some years
previously in Bird Notes ! To-day it appears to be sufficient to write an article
in Bird Notes to secure a medal of our Society. I congratulate the Society on
its more liberal policy.
The awarding of a medal for the young of parents kept only partly in
captivity seems also to be a new departure, for I have an indistinct recollection
that a medal was once refused for a species of Guinea-fowl reared in this way.
As a matter of fact, I believe that several species of Tits have reared young in
this way. One summer a pair of Blue Tits found their way into one of my
aviaries, through a single large mesh of the netting, and reared their young
partly on what I provided and partly on what they brought in to the aviary
themselves. I mentioned the matter to our member, Mr. Wormald, who told
me he knew of a similar instance. W. E. TESCHEMAKER.

Mr. Teschemaker is quite correct in thinking that in order to gain the
Society's medal for breeding any species for the first time in captivity a full
account must appear in the Magazine, which account in the case of the Great
Titmice teas sent by Dr. Amsler for publication; but as it would have been an
exact duplicate of one in Bird Notes, published a fortnight previously, and
seeing that a lot of the members of the Avicultural Society are also members of
the F.B.C. I thought it would perhaps be sufficient to state that Dr. Amsler's
paper had been received. In any case I try to aim at publishing original articles,
etc. and to avoid appearing to merely copy them from a contemporary publica-
tion, feeling sure that many members would not be satisfied in finding portions
of the Magazine filled up with replicas of what they might have, or had, already
read in another one a short while previously.
As to the awarding of the medal to Dr. Amsler for breeding the Great
Tits, the decision must rest with the Council. [N.B.--A medal is still due to him
for breeding the Hooded Siskin -- Chrysomitris cucullatus ]. If a medal has already
been granted by another Society (or Club) the advisability of adding a second
one for the same object is, I agree, questionable. I take it that our Society was
formed for the mutual study of living birds as pets or otherwise, and not for
fostering a spirit of mere competition. Personally I do not consider any award
should be necessary, for if aviculturists are really keen, no medals of any calibre
or quality will stimulate them to encourage their birds to nest and reproduce

their species ; for members will be aviculturists for the love of the thing itself ;
and if it is not so, if they keep birds merely to gain a medal, then they are no
true and fervid aviculturists. HUBERT P. ASTLEY.
A GREAT VICTORY FOR THE BIRDS.
The United States Senate has elected to preserve unbroken its record in
the conservation of wild life. After a prolonged and very strenuous struggle with
the feather trade, the friends of the birds, both in and out of Congress, have won
a complete victory. On September 2nd, the Senate democratic caucus voted to
withdraw the amendment it previously adopted to the bird-protecting clause of
the tariff bill, and restore that measure as it was written into the tariff bill by
the House Committee on Ways and Means. Inasmuch as there is no probability
that this action ever will be reversed, the war with " the feather trade " may be
accounted as terminated, in a iweeping victory for the birds of the world.
The action taken by the caucus affords reasons for profound congratula-
tion. Heretofore no party lines ever have been drawn in Congress against birds,
or other forms of wild life ; and the prospect that the wreck of the bird-
protecting clause might or might not be patched up in the conference committee,
at the Senate's expense, gave the bird protectors a feeling of genuine sorrow. It
seemed deplorable that the Senate should, for even one month, assume a position
of friendliness to bird slaughter, and draw party lines against the birds.
But the ship of state has righted itself, and once more rests on an even
keel. The new tariff bill will prohibit the importation of wild birds' plumage for
commercial purposes, no matter from what country they come, and will totally
abolish in the United States and all its territorial possessions the odious and
cruel traffic in the skins and feathers of slaughtered wild birds. The news of the
action of the Senate will give joy to millions of people, all over the world,
who now are thinking very hard on the subject of bird destruction.
The friends of the birds will be deeply grateful to Senator George P.
McLean, who ably championed their cause in the Senate ; to Senators
Chamberlain and Lane of Oregon, who through their bold and aggressive stand
in the great caucus fight of September 2nd, literally snatched a victory out of the
jaws of defeat ; to Senator James A. O'Gorman who took a position on the
right side at a most critical moment, and to Senators, Hitchcock, John Sharp
Williams, Gore, Bryan, Bacon, Shively, and other democratic Senators who were
in a position to make their influence felt.
The campaign was inaugurated and managed throughout by the New
York Zoological Society and National Association of Audubon Societies.
Immediately it attracted the vigorous support of National and State Federations
of Women's Clubs, the State Audubon Societies, many patriotic societies of
women, the Women's League for Animals, and a host of other organizations and
free-lance leaders. The press of the country at large supported the campaign

with vigour and enthusiasm, and some of the strongest editorials were published
in cities and towns far from the storm centre.
The number of personal letters written to members of Congress during this
campaign was enormous. It is estimated that 100,000 would be under rather
than above the mark. The women of America seized upon this campaign as their
one golden opportunity to square themselves on the bird-millinery question, and
put a final quietus on the traffic they had long abhorred. The traffic was
swept out of the country on a tidal wave of indignant protest that was
irresistible.
To all those who helped to carry through this campaign to a victorious
finish, much credit is due for having won the first great victory ever scored for
the birds of the world. The effect of it will be felt all round the world, and in
every land where birds are to-day unprotected from the gun, the snare and the
blowpipe of the cruel hunters of the feather trade. Now the word of the leaders
is : '&apos; On to London, Paris, and Berlin ! "
The accuracy of the above is vouched for by W. T. HORNADAY,
New York Zoological Park, September 4th, 1913.
[From the Washington Post, September 3rd, 1913].

Senators Bar Out of the United States Imports of Wild
Plumage.
For five hours last night Democratic senators fought out the question of
whether or not the plumage of wild birds should be permitted to be imported into
the United States. The senate committee had agreed to a modification of the
drastic prohibition of the House. This modification was denounced by the
Audubon Society and other lovers of birds, anxious to stop their slaughter, as
tending to make the House provision absolutely ineffective.
The fight for the House provisions was led by Senators Lane and
Chamberlin, of Oregon. The caucus finally decided to stand by the Committee.
The two Oregan senators bolted, and others supported them. Party managers then
found the spirit of insurgency too strong, and the House paragraph was adopted.
This absolutely prohibits the importation of the plumage of wild birds except for
scientific and educational purposes.
