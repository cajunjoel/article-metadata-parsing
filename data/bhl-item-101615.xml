REPORT OF THE COUNCIL
- FOR 1913-1914. -

<bodyText confidence="0.992101222222222" page_id="32669370"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
y^PART from the election of Councillors, the only change in the
Executive to be recorded in the past year is the retirement
of Mr. E, I. POCOCK, E.R.S. from the Honorary Business Secretary¬
ship after the five years tenure of that office allowed by the rules
of the Society. Owing to the increasing pressure of other work,
Mr. Pocock felt unable to offer his services for another term of
five years and Mr. T. H. Newman, who held the Secretaryship
from 1904 to 1909, kindly consented to resume the office.
Under Mr. Astley’s able and energetic Editorship the
excellence of the Magazine has been fully maintained, and the
increase in the number of members, attesting the growing interest
in aviculture, has permitted the expenditure of more money upon
illustrations than was possible in former years.
The Council wishes to express its obligations to all those
members who have helped the Executive by the generous donation
of subscriptions to the Illustration Fund and by the contribution of
articles to the Magazine. Especially indebted is the Society to
Mr. Astley, who has cheerfully devoted his time to the onerous
duties imposed upon him by the Editorship. In addition to the
large number of illustrations he has given to the Society, his articles
and notes have far exceeded in extent those of other members. In
this connection the Council ventures to repeat its appeal to members
to send in “ copy,” no matter how trivial the subject-matter may
appear to be. By so doing they can add enormously to the interest
of our periodical and relieve considerably the undue pressure of work
that falls upon the Editor, with whom the sole responsibility for the
monthly production of each number of the Magazine rests.

Report of the Council.
v.
But flourishing&amp;apos; as is the condition of the Society up to the
present time, the Council feels it a duty to point out that the
financial crisis resulting from the European War cannot fail to
affect adversely the prosperity of the Society in the ensuing year.
The cost of printing the text of the Magazine and of reproducing
plates and text figures will probably rise ; dealers’ advertisements
may be withdrawn or curtailed, and the funds generously subscribed
for illustrations may be required for more important things. It
cannot be expected, that the average number of new members for
the past two or three years will be maintained and, on the other
hand, the number of resignations will probably be increased. It
may, therefore, be necessary for the Executive to reduce some¬
what the size of the Magazine and lessen the number of illustrations.
Nevertheless the Council feels that it may confidently rely upon
Members to continue to support the Society in every way that is
possible through the time of stress and anxiety that is to come.
Signed for the Council,

The Society’s Medal.
The Society s Medal.
RULES.
The Medal may be awarded at the discretion of the Committee, to
any Member who shall succeed in breeding,in the United Kingdom, any
species of bird which shall not be known to have been previously bred in
captivity in Great Britain or Ireland. Any Member wishing to obtain the
Medal must send a detailed account for publication in the Magazine within
about eight weeks from the date of hatching of the young and furnish such
evidence of the facts as the Executive Committee may require. The Medal
will be awarded only in cases where the young shall live to be old enough
to feed themselves, and to be wholly independent of their parents.
The account of the breeding must be reasonably full so as to afford
instruction to our Members, and should describe the plumage of the young
and be of value as a permanent record of the nesting and general habits of the
species. These points will have great weight when the question of awarding
the Medal is under consideration.
The parents of the young must be the bona fide property of the
breeder. An evasion of this rule, in any form whatever, will not only dis¬
qualify the breeder from any claim to a Medal in that particular instance,
but will seriously prejudice any other claims he or she may subsequently
advance for the breeding of the same or any other species.
In every case the decision of the Committee shall be final.
The Medal will be forwarded to each Member as soon after it shall
have been awarded as possible.
The Medal is struck in bronze (but the Committee reserve the right
to issue it in silver in very special cases), and measures inches in
diameter. It bears on the obverse a representation of two birds with a nest
containing eggs, and the words “ The Avicultural Society—founded 1S94.”
On the reverse is the following inscription : “Awarded to {name of r ecipient)
for rearing the young of ( name of species), a species not previously bred in
captivity in the United Kingdom.”

THE RED-HEADED TITMOUSE.
CEgithalisus erythrocephalus.
By Hubert D. Astley.
Nothing more dainty and more fascinating can be found
amongst birds than this tiny Titmouse. Inhabiting the forests of
some parts of the Himalayas, it probably there bears in its habits a
cousinly resemblance to the European Long-tailed Tit, but the Bed¬
headed has more of a curve in the minute bill, and less length to the
tail. Major Perreau brought some to England in March 1913, but
owing to their cage being violently upset on board the channel
steamer, they did not long survive.
Two w 7 ere landed at Genoa last spring in Major Horsbrugh’s
collection, which I took with me to Lake Como, but they succumbed
in two days, after having lived long enough for me to be all but
moved to tears at their departure ! It was a chilly rainy evening
when the ship was towed in to the dock at Genoa, looking as if she
was tired-out after her voyage from India. Perhaps the little Tit¬
mice contracted a chill, anyhow they succumbed within a few hours
of each other. I did all I could. I collected sprays of rose branches
rich in green “ fly,” and those small birds eagerly and without the
slightest fear clung to the stems as I held them in my fingers, pick¬
ing off the “ fly.”
The grace and confidence which they showed would have
impressed even a hippopotamus ! which always strikes me as the
most hideously uncouth and self-centred creature on the face of the

Mr. F. E. Blaauw,
globe. Chacun a son gout! There may be those who would prefer
that monstrous mammal to a Red-headed Titmouse as a pet.
If these tiny birds could recover the disadvantages of a voyage
to England, I see no reason why they should not be easily kept, so
long as in addition to a good artificial insectivorous mixture, they
were supplied with fresh ants’ ‘ eggs,’ flies, and other insects, in
season.
Every aviculturist has his list of departed over which he sighs,
but on mine there is no name written which I more deeply regret
than that of the Red-headed Titmouse.

PARRAKEET.
Henicognathus leptorhynchus.
By E. E. Blaauw, C.M.Z.S.
When I visited Chili in March, 1911, I, for the first time,
made the acquaintance of this interesting and little known parrot.
I was riding between Osorno and Puerto Octay, on the lake
of Llanquihue, a distance of some sixty kilometres, and was tra¬
versing a large w T ood consisting of mixed trees, amongst which the
Southern beech largely preponderated. I had been admiring various
birds, which were busy along the side of the road, when my attention
was attracted by shrill screams from birds with pointed tails and
wings, that were flying in small parties high over the forest trees.
Of course I knew at once that they must be parrakeets, but at first
I did not realise to which species they belonged. Then some birds
by flying not quite so high, or by moving in their flight so that the
light fell more fully on them, showed themselves to be green with
red tails, and then I knew what they were.
As I rode on, the little flights of these birds became more
and more numerous, and for a long time they were quite a feature
in the landscape. As I passed a cottage I saw in front of it, sitting
on a pile of wood, one of those parrakeets with stunted wings and
tail, looking the picture of misery.
Puerto Octay—which I reached in the evening by a beautiful

moonlight—is on the border of the lake Llanquihue, in more or less
open country, and I saw no more parrakeets there.
From Puerto Octay I crossed to Puerto Yaras, and continuing
to travel eastwards towards the Cordilleras the Los Andes, I reached
Casa Pangui after two days, which is near the foot of the Tronador
Glacier. Here again I met numerous flocks of this parrakeet, and
as I saw them perch on lower trees than they had done before I had
a better view of them.
Five or six days later found me at Puerto Montt, and riding
westwards from this place I traversed some splendid woods in which
enormous Urmus trees (Eucryphia cordifolia ) were particularly
numerous. These woods were full of Long-billed Parrakeets, which
screamed loudly and were very active, flying about in small flocks or
perching on the tops of the giant trees. It is probable that these
birds were feeding on the seeds of the Urmus trees which look like a
thin small olive, and no doubt they found any amount of seeds and
berries in those woods. I never saw the birds on the ground, and
it seems that they liked to perch as high as they could. I was told
that the inhabitants of Puerto Montt go out on Sundays to try and
shoot the parrakeets and that they found them good eating !
Having returned to Puerto Yaras, I spent the night there and
decided to go north again next morning by a steamer which was to
take me to Puerto Octay, from which place I would ride to Osorno
to join the railroad there. An hour before I left I noticed near the
inn a tame Long-billed Parrakeet, which, with stunted wings and
tail but looking rather contented, was sitting on a railing in front
of a small house. The bird was quite tame, and when the old
woman who inhabited the house saw that I noticed it, she at once
offered it to me for sale for a few pesos, and, rather foolishly, un¬
mindful of all the miles that separated me from home, I could not
resist the temptation to buy the bird. I carried him to the inn in
my hand, and as no such a thing as a cage was to be got anywhere
I with great difficulty obtained a small box to put him in. This was
just done when I had to go on board the steamer with all my
belongings.
In the evening we reached Puerto Octay, having to travel on
the following morning on horse-back to Osorno, whilst the heavy

Mr. F. E. Blaauw,
luggage was to be taken by oxen-cart. A pack horse was to carry
my valise along with me, as the cart would take some twelve hours
longer to reach Osorno. Now the first difficulty with my “ lorito ”
began. How was he to travel ? I had thought of the oxen-cart,
but I was told that this was not safe. Then I suggested to the
peon that he should fasten the box with the bird on the pack-horse
that carried my valise, but the man, apparently an exception to most
of the people in those parts, was fond of birds and was horrified at
the idea, saying that it would shake the bird to death and that he
was quite willing to carry the box in his hand. This certainly was
the best plan and I gladly accepted his proposal. The man was as
good as his word and carried the bird the whole 60 kilometres in his
hand, bringing him safely to Osorno.
Having resolved to try to bring this one bird home, I of
course thought how I could obtain a second one, and as we passed
the same wood, where a week previously I had noticed a cabin wfith
one of these birds in captivity, I took great care not to miss the
cottage and, having found it, enquired after the bird I had seen
there. The answer was disappointing; the bird had died the day
before !
In Osorno I asked the innkeeper where I could get a second
parrakeet, and his answer was that the only way was to take a walk
through the streets and listen for the screams of a bird of this kind,
and then to enter the house and try to buy it. Following this
advice, after some time a parrakeet’s screams were heard right
enough, and on going to the door of a bookseller, thinking the bird
was there, I was informed that it was in his neighbour’s house,
to which I betook myself and asked to see the bird, of which I, ten
minutes later, became the happy owner for the sum of one peso.
The woman (a milliner) said that it belonged to her boy, but that he
did not care about it any longer and she would be glad to get rid of
it. So I carried off my prize in a paper box, taking it to the inn,
where I introduced it to the other bird. A great battle followed but
no harm was done, and as I had to leave by train soon after, I put
both birds in the small box and took them away with me. Their
travelling about in this manner quieted their tempers and they were
soon great friends. In Valdivia I had a better box made for them,

and next clay I carried them on board the river-boat which was to
take me to Corral, where I was to find a steamer to go south to
Punto Arenas, in the Straits of Magellan.
On the steamer everything went all right, but in Punta
Arenas, where I landed, new difficulties began. I was going to
spend a few days in Tierra del Fuego, and as that meant so many
days on horseback I could not possibly take the parrots with me.
Fortunately, at the Kosmos Hotel there was a bird-loving housemaid
who promised to take care of my birds whilst I was in Tierra del
Fuego, and she kept her promise, for on my return I found them as
noisy and as funny as I had left them.
By steamer, via the Smith Channel, I returned northward to
Conception taking the train from there to Santiago. From Santiago
I brought them to Buenos Ayres, under the same difficulties men¬
tioned in a previous paper treating of my Antarctic Goose, and in
Buenos Ayres I embarked with them on board the *&amp;apos; Zeelandia,”
hound for Amsterdam, where I landed them safely.
Notwithstanding all the knocking about, my two birds had
done very well, and the bird which I had first acquired and which
afterwards proved to be the male—the other one being a female as
luck would have it—was fast moulting his stumpy feathers when I
got them safely home in an aviary at Gooilust. The other bird was
not quite so robust, and as she had apparently no strength to get rid
of her old feathers I tried a stronger remedy and pulled out all the old
stumps, which had a very good effect, for after a few weeks of good
feeding and rest both birds were in splendid plumage and robust
health, remaining delightfully tame and always extremely glad to see
me. Although they were a true pair, they were constantly quarrel¬
ling over something, and the male would never allow the female to
come near me if he had not been fed or played with first.
There is hardly any difference in the sexes, but the male is
perhaps a trifle larger although the colours are identical. They like
to imitate noises and with pains could probably be taught to speak.
The female imitates a whistle with which I used to announce myself
on board the ship, and the male reproduces the loud spluttering call
of the red Oven Birds, which were its travelling companions on
board the “ Zeelandia.” Oven Birds, by the way, which are delight-

ful birds when free in their own country, and are very numerous in
the parks of Buenos Ayres, do very badly in confinement and are
very delicate.
For two years the life of my parrakeets was rather un¬
eventful. They spent the summer in a large garden aviary and the
winter in a bird-house, where they did all they could to demolish the
woodwork of their flight. Last spring, however, in the second half
of May, one of the birds was missing, and on closer investigation it
was found sitting in a roomy nesting log&amp;apos; which hung high near the
roof of the covered part of their aviary. Of course we did not
disturb the sitting bird, and so I could not tell at first how many
eggs were laid, nor can I tell the exact time of incubation. Suffice
it to say that after some three weeks the bird-keeper heard noises
proceeding from the box resembling the cries of young Green Wood¬
peckers. These noises gradually grew louder, and one day, not very
long before they left the nest, the head of a young bird was seen
looking through the opening of the nesting-log. Some time earlier
two addled eggs, more or less cracked, were found under the box.
They were fine large white ones. At last, on the 3rd of August, I
was agreeably surprised at seeing a splendid strong young bird in the
outside flight, and the next day number two also appeared. This
was the end of the supply and the box had no more treasures to
reveal, so that probably four eggs had been laid, of which the two
birds were the result.
The young birds are exactly like their parents, but the green
is darker ( i.e . less yellowish) and all the feathers have dark edgings.
The upper mandibles are shorter than those of the adults and the
tops or points of them are white , the same colour being seen on the
top part of the under mandibles. The naked skin round the eyes is
also whitish.
The old birds are extremely fond of their children, and one
usually sees each of the parents with a baby under its care. They
show their affection by fumbling in their children’s feathers, and
when the wings, tails, etc. have had their turn, the legs are passed
through the bills to the great discomfort and annoyance of the little
ones.
Besides the usual seeds, the youngsters were fed on bread

soaked in milk, and also on grass roots. Little bits of Berheris
dulcis were also very much appreciated, and the birds always loudly
clamoured for some branchlets as soon as I approached the aviary.
And thus my little green friends from Puerto Varas and
Osorno have well rewarded me for all the trouble they gave me dur¬
ing the long and arduous journey across South America, and have
contradicted and disproved the reputation they have with the natives
of their own country of not living in confinement longer than a year.
The reason of their not living there for long is probably that after
a while the owners, like the child of the milliner in Osorno, “ don’t
care for them any longer,” and then the end is near !

THE PRICELESS VALUE OF THE
LIVE BIRD.

A few summers ago, the gardeners, especially perhaps the
rose-growers, complained of the prevalence of blight.
One lovely afternoon found me in a large garden in the
suburbs, where flowers abounded ; and round and about the lawn
there were masses of roses in faultless bloom, none showing a trace
of injury or harm—-yet the neighbours were complaining of the
green fly.
In addition to her flowers, our hostess had a weakness for
birds, which were regularly and bountifully fed ; and the garden was
alive with birds, not a few of them being as tame as chickens.
As I lounged in an easy chair on the lawn, some two or three
feet from my lazily extended extremities I noticed a male House
Sparrow closely shadowed by a fledgeling. Ignoring the humans and
their chatterings, father Sparrow was searching a rose-bush, inch by
inch, picking off aphides, and passing them on to his young hopeful.
Here, then, was the secret of the beautiful roses and flowers :—the
plague was being kept under by the Live Birds.
Not far away there lived another relative, the happy possessor
of larger grounds, to whom we eventually repaired; and I was taken

Mr. Reginald Phillipps,
off by my host to give an opinion on the unhappy condition of a
valuable tree, which I found in a parlous plight. Here was a
splendid stick of timber—I forget the species, it was new to me—
with the bark, from the top to the bottom of the trunk and along the
main boughs, not peeling off so much as bulging out and becoming
detached from the stem : never before nor since have I seen such
a case. Doubtless the tree was or had been infested with the larvae
of some moth, probably of one which bores into and lives in the
wood for some four years before it develops into its imago state. If
the tree had been in the country proper, our familiar friend the Green
Woodpecker, or some of its congeners, would have found it and
would not have rested until every grub had been cut out — and the
life of the tree would have been saved. But, in the absence of the
Live Bird, man was helpless, and could only look on in despair
while the tree was being done to death by a miserable grub.
I have read somewhere that certain savants of the U.S.A.
(? of the United States Forest Service) have expressed the opinion
that, if it were not for the Woodpeckers (and, presumably, other
genera, such as the Cassiques — see our Magazine VI. pp, 24, 25,
December, 1899), there would not be a living tree in the whole of
Tropical America, so rampant there is insect life. Is it going too
far to suggest that the three Americas are saved by the wondrous
variety of their marvellous collection of Live Birds !
At my house here, there are two little bits of ground which
we will call, respectively, the front garden and the back garden.
During a good part of the year, the garden in the front is as full of
flowering plants as we can manage to squeeze in. Until some time
towards the end of June, matters progress very well, and the flowers
are our delight, and the admiration of all who pass to and fro. But,
as soon as the House-Sparrows (the only avian visitors to the front)
have reared their broods and moved on to the parks and other open
spaces, a change comes over the scene—the birds go and the cater¬
pillars come, caterpillars and grubs of various sizes, shapes and
shades, differing in form, colour and habits, but all alike in their
determination to turn my garden into a wilderness. In vain I try
quassia, hellebore, tobacco powder, and other cures recommended
by experts—they care for none of these things. Some of the “cures,”

indeed, by injuring the leaves of the plants, do more harm than good.
There is only one remedy in the circumstances—hand-picking. But
it is not a bit of fun, day after day, for half-hours at a stretch some
two or three times a day, rain or shine, examining leaf after leaf and
bud after bud; and there is no visible end to the loathsome work.
For even the very buds are attacked immediately they appear, and
are ruined before they open into flower. And this summer I have
had a new experience that has aggravated me exceedingly. Hitherto
I had found that the enemy did not attack fuchsias, so, last year, I
increased the number, tended them carefully through the winter, and,
this summer, placed a selection of them (in pots) all round the
dining-room window, outside, on the sill. One of them is a fine
specimen, which, last year, in the same spot, was a mass of bloom.
But woe is me, for this year they have been freely attacked ; and the
pride of my heart now looks more like a cairn on the top of a Trans-
Himalayan pass, stuck full of Tibetan prayer-poles and streamers,
than a respectable, well-brought-up, British-grown fuchsia.
The gardener in the country will not understand this; he
will attribute it to incompetency, stupidity, feebleness, he would
soon put matters straight if the place were in his hands, and so on;
and, with an air of superiority, he will look with self-complacency on
his own beautiful garden. But could he manage one whit the better
if he were here? Just let him try, single-handed, without his allies
the Live Birds ! He is simply ignorant of the fact that his own
garden is in good trim, not through his own exertions alone but
because he has the Live Birds to keep the army of caterpillars and
other undesirables at bay.
The man in the country is thrice blessed. He has the seed-
eaters which, feeding their young largely on insects, during the
breeding-season at any rate are of real value. Then, the whole year
round, there are certain residents and some winter immigrants which
devour insects in any form or at any stage they may be able to find
them. And, during the summer, when insect-life is most abundant,
he has the Swallow family, ceaselessly hawking after winged creatures,
the summer Warblers, the Flycatchers, the Cuckoo, and many other
Live Birds that stand between him and the destruction of his woods,
his crops, his orchards and his gardens.

Mr. Reginald Phillipps ;
Our nearest public gardens of any size are those in Ravens-
court Park. On July 31, after caterpillar-picking in, and a look of
despair at, my own little plot, I took a tram to this place, and sat
for a while in that quiet little retreat wdiich is or used to be known
as the Shakespeare Garden. The masses of rambler-roses and other
flowers were charming—and not a sign of caterpillar or fly. As I
lolled and looked and envied, I noticed a little mouse-like shadow,
running from the copse at my back, enter and disappear amongst the
flowers. It came into sight again a few yards away at the base of
an arch of roses, which it proceeded to climb; and it carefully cleared
the tree of insect-life as it ascended. It was much smaller and
slimmer than an Accentor, and the movements were altogether
different: to me it seemed to be one of the rarer Warblers, but my
eyes are old, and I will not venture to give it a name, neither does
it matter for our present purpose. The staff of gardeners could
arrange for the production of the display of flowers, but not all the
gardeners in the world could have preserved them. That stupendous
work was performed, with marvellous efficiency, by the fragile birds,
of so many shapes and colours and modes of procedure, working
silently and without thanks, and ofttimes so secretly as in the case
cited, but all with one accord, guided by to them an Unknown Hand,
working for the comfort and well-being of man. The head gardener
gets the praise, but where would he have been without the Live
Birds !
Now let us take a peep at my back garden, with the house at
one end and a four-foot-high wall along the other three sides, and
overshadowed by my neighbours’ houses and trees. Some trees and
shrubs will not grow here, the place is so shut in : moreover, it is so
full, so overfull, of such trees and shrubs as will live, if but for a
time, that to attempt to grow flowers would seem to be a hopeless
task. Last year, however, I chanced to move some geraniums,
which had apparently been ruined by caterpillars, from the front to
the back garden, and found that they did very well. Taking the
hint, this spring, as early as I dared, I planted several dozen of the
best obtainable scarlet geraniums in this back garden; and all
through the summer-—and they are still (August) going on—I have
had a magnificent display of brilliant colour, set off and toned by a

rich background and framework of greenery in many shades, quite a
sight to behold and feast one’s eyes upon. But how about the
caterpillars, the grubs, the fly, and all the hosts of the enemy ?
Ne’er a one ! ! ! And herein is the marvel. When I go caterpillar¬
hunting in the front garden, I take with me what sixty odd years
ago was known by the homely name of a pomatum pot—what its
modern scientific name may be I do not know. In this receptacle,
I tenderly and carefully place every grub, caterpillar, fly, and other
beastie I can lay my hands on, and I forthwith set them free, un¬
harmed, amongst the flowers in the bach garden : —that is, for some
weeks, there has been a continuous stream of living creatures flow¬
ing from the front to the back—and, yet, the front garden languishes
and the back garden flourishes ! Of course there can be only one
explanation of this little phenomenon—those Live Birds again !—
but never before have I had the value of the Live Bird brought to
my own personal notice so prominently. The back garden is covered
over with wire-netting, and in it I still have a few little seed-eaters,
but not a single insectivorous bird ; yet these little waxbills and
finches keep the flowers and foliage clean ; and I must emphasize
the point that, for the most part, the geraniums in the front are
identical with those at the back ; for several dozen pots were brought
to the house, of which so many were allotted to the one garden, so
many to the other, yet those in the front have not been permitted
by the insects to continue blossoming while those at the back have
blossomed and still blossom as they like. The birds, those I now
have at any rate, while damaging some flowers, do not injure the
geraniums.
And it is not alone the small bird that is of such value ;
agricultural man has other enemies besides the grub and the fly.
How about the mouse and the vole ? and where would he be with¬
out the Kestrel and others to rule the day and the Owl to look after
and protect his interests at night, during the time when he, good
easy man, full surely is—or ought to be—lying in his bed, not too
seldom, in his stupid ignorance, abusing his midnight saviours for
making such a noise and disturbing his slumbers.
It is a red-letter day in mouse-land when a man, say in
London, sets up a garden aviary. There are cats in all the gardens

around, and occasionally not too much food ; and the mice are often
put to it to find meals for themselves without serving themselves up
as meals for the cats ; but set up an aviary, and there you have a
paradise for the mice straight away. Outside, the cats may prowl
and hunger and gnash their teeth, but— Inside ! ! ! Canary, and
millet, and other delights and toothsome delicacies, even an occa¬
sional dish of bird’s head—and not a ghost of a cat to disturb the
digestion or the sweet harmony of the place. In the aviary, mice
may squeak and grow fat without a care in the world, for as for man
and his traps — 2vis-s-s-sh —poor feeble creature.
Years ago, I had hawks and owls — but no mice. Times
changed ; the hawks and owls took their departure — and I had
mice. Generation after generation of mice came and went until,
by inherited instinct, they knew every kind of trick and trap as
soon as they could run ; as for poisons and steel traps—they
scratched and covered them up inches deep with earth. Virus they
ignored : why should they eat such poor fare ? A learned chemist,
in his wisdom, said, “ Oh, they want feeding up to it ; now I should
begin with a little toasted cheese - .” Fiddlesticks; they were
not such gudgeons!
Then came a thought:—“ Phillipps, old man, you have never
kept the Burrowing Owl ” ; and a pair were obtained as soon as
might be. For a part of the year, the Owls were shut up by day
and the other birds loosed ; in the evening, the birds generally were
driven into and shut up in the birdroom and the Owls set free.
From the nature of things, this arrangement was inconvenient and
unsatisfactory, and had to be modified from time to time ; neverthe¬
less, it disposed of the mice in my aviary so completely for the time
being that I was thankful when anyone made me a present of a
mouse for the Owls’ dinner. And this notwithstanding that the
Burrowing Owl is a poor mouser compared with most of our splendid
British species, in whom the nation has a veritable treasure, some
indeed killing rats as well as mice. In short, while boastful man
could not do more than keep down the mice, the Owls could and
did exterminate them. v

Apply this little picture to the whole country ; and I hope it
may be realized what a friend and ally man has in the Live Birds,
how hopeless his toil and how helpless he would be without them,
and how, if he loves his country, he ought (for the most part) to
cherish and preserve them and their eggs, instead of carelessly
slaughtering them, or recklessly turning them into “ specimens ” for
Love of Science, for Love of Dress, or for any other love whatever.

By Collingwood Ingram.
Although Birds of Paradise have been known to Europeans
since the sixteenth century, our knowledge of them until compara¬
tively recent times was limited to a few imperfect skins and some
idle tales invented by the earlier Portuguese or Spanish navigators.
Of these travellers’ tales possibly the most fanciful was the one that
led to the Greater Bird of Paradise being described as “the bird
without any feet, which flies about continuously and never sleeps ! ”
This fable undoubtedly arose from the fact that in most of the old
native-made skins the feet were wanting, and Linnseus has unwit¬
tingly perpetuated the fallacy by calling the bird Paradisea apoda!
Since then our knowledge has gradually accumulated. Wallace
met with this and other forms of the family Paradiseidae during his
wanderings in the Malay Archipelago. Then their curiously marked
eggs—for so many years the coveted prize of every oologist—were
discovered, and now the living birds themselves have been imported
into England.
It seems that the Greater Bird of Paradise has lately become
very scarce in its native home, the Aru Islands, Dutch New Guinea.
This marked diminution is doubtless attributable to the great demand
Yol. II. One of the young birds found her way, indirectly, to the Zoological
Gardens ; and, later, certain papers were not slow in trumpeting abroad the
intelligence that a Burrowing Owl had been bred at the Zoo. But that the
mother herself had been bred in my aviary was too insignificant a trifle to be
thought worthy of mention!—R. P.

that now exists for their side plumes for millinery purposes, for the
high price put on these feathers encourages the native hunters to kill
the birds in a very reckless manner. Believing that they were
threatened with extermination, a few years ago, my father, Sir
William Ingram, decided to make a serious attempt to save them
from this fate.
His first difficulty, of course, was to obtain a suitable tract
of land in a tropical climate, and this he finally overcame by the
purchase of the West Indian Island of Little Tobago. The second
was to procure the birds themselves. For this purpose he sent a
collector to the Aru Islands in 1909, and this man succeeded in
bringing back about fifty living specimens, forty-four of which were
ultimately released on Little Tobago in September of that year. Two
more were liberated in the winter of 1910, and a third in 1912—
these latter having been procured from M. Pauwels, the well-known
Belgian aviculturist. All these were in the uniform chocolate-brown
plumage of the immature bird, in which stage it is almost impossible
to distinguish the sexes. From previous experience, however, my
father believes that the majority of these birds were males, but from
their very small size, there was every reason to suppose that the
last three, at any rate, were undoubted females.
On Jan. 2 last my father and I paid our first visit to Little
Tobago. Situated roughly in 11° 30&amp;apos; N. latitude, and 60° 32 / W.
longitude (it is interesting to note that the Aru Islands are roughly
in 6° S. latitude) it lies about a mile and a half off the north-eastern
end of the main island of Tobago ; a group of rocks known col¬
lectively as Goat Island, dividing the channel about mid-way. A
strong current almost constantly runs through these straits in a
northerly direction, and this, meeting the incoming ocean swell, is
very liable to create a choppy sea, when the crossing in a small boat
becomes a difficult and sometimes dangerous undertaking. A very
convenient landing place, how T ever, is formed by a small sandy cove
on the leeward side of the island.
Little Tobago, about a mile in length, is obviously formed by
the crests of three or four small but tolerably steep hills of meta-
morphic rock, the highest of which now stands some 490ft. above
the sea level. According to the official estimate, the acreage is only

240, but if one takes into consideration all the inequalities of the
ground, there can be no room for doubt that the area of the
island has been greatly under-estimated, and a proper survey will
probably show it to be nearly twice that figure.
The island is clothed with a dense vegetation, the ground
being covered with verdure almost to the sea’s edge. The salt-
sprayed rocks, notably on the eastward or windward side, are over¬
grown with thickets of a fleshy-leaved, upstanding cactus ( Gereus sp.?)
among which are dotted here and there the more curious spherical
Turk’s head ( Melocactus communis). The rest of the island is more
or less evenly wooded, an unusual feature for a tropical country (where
gregarious trees are the exception rather than the rule), being the
extensive groves of fan palm ( Thrinax radiata). A striking charac¬
teristic of the undergrowth is the immense quantity of “ big-leaves”—
an aroid plant, bearing as its local name suggests, gigantic lanceolate¬
shaped leaves. It is also an epiphyte, and many of the trees are
burdened with ponderous clumps of this great plant, and it will even
find a foothold on to the small columnar trunks of the Thrinax.
Breaking off one of the leaves at random, I found it measured fully
7ft. in length.
In the sheltered and richer valleys, the vegetation assumes
a more imposing character, and here the trees in their struggle to
reach the light, attain the great heights so often found in a true
tropical forest. Among these trees I noticed the hog plum ( Spondias
lutea), pimenta, fiddle wood, plummer cherry, cannon wood, and,
here and there, the majestic cabbage palm.
Water is unfortunately rather scarce, and can only be relied
upon normally at one point, where a spring of water (apparently
full of organic matter and unfit for human use) percolates through
the soil of one of the little ravines. As it does not appear to be
extensively used by either the Birds of Paradise or any of the native
species, one can only assume that the heavy dews are sufficient to
satisfy all their wants in this respect.
We left the main island of Tobago about ten in the morning,
one boat containing our luggage and provisions, and the other our¬
selves and friends. Owing to the strong tide rip, it took us over an
hour to pull across, and another to carry our goods and chattels up

to the small wooden shanty that was to he our sleeping quarters for
the night.
Although from time to time we had received encouraging, if
somewhat conflicting, reports from the various people who had
chanced to visit the island, I confess I was not very sanguine of
seeing many Birds of Paradise. Surely, one argued, even if their
new surroundings had not proved uncongenial to them, the majority
must have flown across the narrow straits and become lost in the
forests of the main island
It was, therefore, with a sense of great relief that we pre¬
sently heard the well-known “wark-wark-wark ” of a Paraclisea, the
sound being carried to us faintly from a remote part of the island—
but the cry was unmistakable. So one, at least, had survived its
three years’ exile !
In a little while we heard a second bird calling from some
trees immediately behind the building. On being answered by its
fellow, this one rose from the forest and flew boldly across the
valley with a leisurely, Jay-like flight. In so doing it passed quite
near to us, and in the bright sunlight I could clearly discern the
details of its plumage. No side plumes were yet visible, but the
dark green plush-like growth on the throat pronounced it to be un¬
questionably a male.
In several parts of the island my father has had clearings
cut for the cultivation of papaws and bananas. The food supply
afforded by the fruits and the young vegetation of these compara¬
tively open spaces, seemed to attract nearly all the bird life on the
island, and it was to these places that we went in the evening, in
the hope of seeing something more of the Birds of Paradise. Nor
were we disappointed. We saw single birds on several occasions,
and once I observed as many as four together—two young males and,
if one could judge by their smaller size, two females.
* These side plumes do not appear before the fourth or fifth year (perhaps
even longer), and are then only retained for a comparatively short season.—C.I.
* In a letter which I read lately from some person evidently connected
with the plume trade, it was announced that the males do not breed after four
or five years of age, and that therefore they could be killed off. A convenient
but completely false statement. One expects this kind of argument from such
quarters ! ! — ED.

Birds of Paradise are apparently omnivorous, but, in common
with several other native species, they seemed to be very partial to
the soft fruits of the papaw. One would have thought that no bird
would have dared to interfere with the Paradisea, yet the much
smaller, yellow-tailed Cassiques ( Ostinops decumanus ) were obviously
their masters, and only permitted them to feed on the papaw trees
when they had finished their own meal. By the way, these
Cassiques, or “corn-birds” as they are termed locally, are delight¬
fully quaint birds, and deserve a few words of comment, if only for
their extraordinary repertoire of strange sounds. Their song, for in¬
stance, opens with some very singular notes that sound more like the
hollow “ gobble ” of liquid being poured out of a large-bellied flagon
Than anything else I can think of ; these are usually followed by a
prolonged creaking note, which Chapman has aptly likened to the
chafing of boughs in a wind ; or again by the very curious splutter¬
ing sound that cannot be expressed in black and white. These birds
are also wont to utter a singularly human whistle—so human, in
fact, that on more than one occasion I have turned sharply round
under the impression that someone was trying to attract my attention
by this means. Many of their remarkable purse-shaped nests were
to be seen swinging&amp;apos; from the outer branches of the higher trees.
Another bird that we found feasting greedily upon the papaws
was the handsome Blue Tanager— Tanagra cana sclateri (Berl).
Some of these were constantly present, fighting and bickering to¬
gether for possession of the ripe fruit. Humming-birds, Petcharies,
Grass-finches, House Wrens, and, of course, the “ day-clean,” or
Mocking-bird [Mimas gilvus —an extraordinarily plentiful species on
Little Tobago—were likewise usually to be seen about the clearings ;
but these were all inoffensive species that never disputed the rights
of their larger brethren.
It must not be supposed that the Birds of Paradise are the first
birds to be introduced into Little Tobago ; domestic fowls have lived
there in a feral state for a number of years. The story of their
introduction is not lacking in romantic interest. Some thirty-five or
forty years ago, an old man named Mitchell dwelt alone on the
cf. Notes on Birds from Yucatan in this number.—ED.

island—alone, that is to say, with his dog, his chickens, and his
goats. This hermit’s life was evidently not of Mitchell’s own choos¬
ing, for it is rumoured that his friends had quietly marooned him
there to keep him from the bottle that was so speedily killing him.
One fine day, when his friends sailed across with their weekly gift
of provisions, they found the beach deserted save for Mitchell’s little
dog, who greeted them ominously with frantic barks. As soon as
they landed, the distracted animal led them over the hill to a certain
rock on the wundward side. Here they found an old coat, some
fishing tackle, and three sun-scorched fish lying on the edge of the
cliff and, below—the everlasting surf beating angrily against the
jagged boulders.
Although Mitchell’s goats survived him for many years, they
ultimately disappeared. The fowls, on the other hand, soon multi¬
plied, and their descendents exist to the present day, though their
numbers have recently been greatly reduced by my father’s “watcher,”
for it was deemed inadvisable to have the place overrun by these
birds. It is said, and there is every reason to credit the statement,
that these fowds have largely reverted to the plumage of their wild
progenitors. [It would be interesting to obtain some skins to verify
this.—E d.]
Whether the Birds of Paradise have actually increased—or,
indeed, nested at all—on Little Tobago, is a very moot point, and
one that is almost impossible at the present time to answer satis¬
factorily. Towards sundown and in the early morning they become
more noisy, and it is at these hours that one can best estimate their
numbers. Personally I am of opinion that they are at least main¬
taining their numbers. That they should be able to do this after
nearly three and a half years’ liberty, is certainly encouraging, and
I think there is now every reason to hope that the colony will
continue to thrive in their new West Indian home.

Additional Notes by Sir William Ingram.
Robert Herold, the guardian of Little Tobago, writing in
July, informs me that he has seen two or three young birds accom¬
panied by their mothers, one of which was very small and appeared

to have left the nest only about ten or twelve clays. If this is really
the case, it is curious as showing that the Apoda breeds at a different
period of the year from that in New Guinea. There the Paradise
Birds breed in the latter part of October or November (see Dr.
Simson’s account of Journey in New Guinea, Ibis, Yol. for 1907).
I am also informed that, in the far corner in the north part of the
island, there are three separate pairs of Apodas which remain in
that locality and may have nests ; at any rate, it is satisfactory to
know that after nearly four years on the island the male birds are
now easily distinguished from the females, as they have now obtained
the distinctive colouring on their heads and necks, and, according to
Heroic!, have recently grown short “ wires,” although up to the
present no side plumes have been observed by the guardian. I am
told that the birds were moulting&amp;apos; in April; in New Guinea they
change their plumage at the end of November and December.
Now that the different sexes can be recognised I expect to
have more reliable accounts of the habits of the Apodas. To assist
Bobert Heroic! in his observations a good pair of glasses has been
sent out to him, and perhaps in a few weeks I may have further
interesting notes to contribute. [We shall be very glad to publish
them.—E d.]
As to the number of Apodas on the island, I estimate there
may be thirty, but do not feel certain of more than sixteen, out of
which there may be six or seven females. I shall soon know more
on this point, and one can only hope the number of females may be
more than my estimate, as so much will depend on the “ ladies ” for
the success of my experiment in acclimatizing the Birds of Paradise
in the West Indies.

A PAPER ON SEXING PARRAKEETS,
AS ILLUSTRATED BY CERTAIN OF THE BROADTAILS.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991969137931034" page_id="32669432"  page_num="42" year="" vol="">
By Dr. L. Lovell-Keays.
This article is not intended to be a recondite treatise on sexing
birds, but I trust it may be of help in determining the sex of certain
of the Plcitycercina ( i.e . Broadtails). Lately I have taken up parra-
keets, and I was at once struck by the apparent difficulty people had
of sexing the parrakeets they offered to me. Out of upwards of fifty
birds only quite a few, in which it was impossible to make a mistake,
came to me properly sexed. I think one may take it as an indis¬
putable fact that sexing birds is to a great extent a gift. But it can
be cultivated and greatly improved with practice, accurate observa¬
tion and patience.
These remarks are somewhat in the way of an apology for
writing so elementary a paper, and yet I remember my friend Major
Perreau remarking that he thought one got most help and more
interest from the earlier numbers of his bird papers than from the
later ones. We are apt to think that what we have learnt or found
out everybody else has, but it is not so, and very often the most
elementary papers are those most eagerly read.
To return to our parrakeets. It is obvious I think that it is
fairly hopeless to attempt to sex immature specimens, at any rate in
the majority of species. One may often make a guess, more or less
lucky, but one cannot tell certainly. This is, I think, particularly
true in such birds as Pennants, Redrumps, and so on.
Given a mature specimen, how are we to commence ? You
must get the birds in a good light, and if possible in a cage and as
near each other as possible. In most cases, it is almost entirely a
matter of comparison, and to sex individual or isolated birds is often
exceedingly difficult, if not impossible.
Now the chief points of difference are as follows : —
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99842875">
(1) The size and shape of the beak.

<bodyText confidence="0.9764652" page_id="32669433"  page_num="43" year="" vol="">
I have put the points in this order as seeming to me to be
the most reliable guides in that order.
To take the first point. I believe the beak of practically
every bird is an index to its entire nature and character. And sex is
shown more by the beak than by any other characteristic. In the
hen bird in most parrakeets, particularly those parrakeets with which
we are dealing&amp;apos;, the beak of the hen is smaller, narrower, and more
tucked into the bird’s ’&amp;quot;face.” In the Rosella this is a very constant
and marked characteristic. The beak is altogether a more lady-like
and less dangerous looking appendage in the hen.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.696279666666667">
(2) With very few exceptions, it will be found that the hen
bird is smaller than the cock, but of course one may have a well-
developed hen and a poorly developed cock.
(3) In examining some dozens of Jiving birds, not only those
that have actually passed through my hands, but at the large dealers
and London Zoo, I came to the conclusion that there was a marked,
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.992317904761905" page_id="32669433"  page_num="43" year="" vol="">
though not easily described, difference in the shape of the bird.
The hen bird was more kestrel shaped and slimmer with narrower
shoulders and the head more daintily and neatly set on than in the
cock. The neck, too, less well marked, and the head being propor¬
tionately smaller, the neck in the hen is a more graceful and
deliberate curve than in the cock bird. The head itself in many
parrakeets is flatter on the crown in the cock than in the hen.* This
point comes out nicely in Mr. Page’s “Aviary and Aviary Life,”
page 189, in which I should say tire nearer bird is undoubtedly the
hen and the other the cock. On page 207 of the same book we
have what one would, in absence of another bird to compare, call a
“ certain cock,” although in Bauer’s, Barnard’s, and others it is
rather hard to sex these birds unless one sees them side by side.
(4) Finally, we come to the colour. Generally speaking the
hen bird is decidedly duller and less plainly marked than the cock,
and in many species, e.g. the Redrumps, the colour is the great
characteristic, but in practising sexing birds we should try and ignore
colour as much as possible or one is apt to lose sight of the more
* Note “ How to Sex Cage Birds ” p. 106 “ the females of many of the
Parrots . . . have rounder heads ”—Mr. Page probably had his attention called
to the fact by this note, but I believe I had previously published it.—A.G.B.

general and (in many birds) only other means of sexing them. In
Rosellas the colour may lead one absolutely astray, and Butler’s,
theory of the green spot on the nape of the neck is, I am absolutely
convinced, not only unreliable but also untrue. v It is quite true that,
generally speaking, the hen bird is very much duller than the cock
bird, and I must confess it was colour that first led me to doubt that
my Rosellas were a true pair. When I saw a solitary hen the
difference appeared to me so marked that I bought her on sight,
and subsequent events justified my judgment. Bright coloured hen
Rosellas may and no doubt do exist, but if I was buying a “ pair”
of birds I should want to make very sure of their sex in other ways
before I ventured on such a hen. In Pennants the colour is very
variable but, on the whole, the cock birds seems to be a purer red
with less dark marking than the hen, and he is too an altogether
finer fellow. In Bauer’s, Barnard’s, and others, as far as I could
ascertain, the colour difference is but slight. I need hardly say
that, if colour is but little guide in adults, it is practically speaking
of no value at all in the great majority of immature birds. In short,
colour is likely to prove the greatest pitfall of all in sexing birds,
and sexing birds is to the aviculturist of such moment that one
wonders more is not written on the subject, for without properly
sexing your birds you cannot breed them, and without breeding
them you cannot study them properly, and, after all, it is the pro¬
duction of young that appeals to the average aviculturist above
everything. The difficulty I had in getting true pairs of birds, led
me in the first place to study and find out the difference in the sexes
for myself, and in the second to place my observations on record, in
the hope that if correct they may be of help to others, and if in¬
correct they may stimulate controversy and debate. For airy errors
I take full responsibility and crave indulgence.
[Further correspondence on this subject would be very useful.
Perhaps Lord Tavistock and a few other members who have had
experience with the Platycercin.ee, will contribute.—E d.]
* In “ How to Sex Cage Birds,” pp. 127, 128, Dr. Butler states this on
the authority of the late Joseph Abrahams, a most acute observer. Moreover
the shape of the green spot was the character noted, not its presence.—ED.

Hcematopus ostralegus (Linnaeus).
By H. WlLLFORD.
The Oyster Catcher—which my friend Dr. Heatherly has
rightly christened “the coastguard of bird-land”—is more or less
common all round our coasts both summer and winter alike. At all
times it is one of the most wary birds I have met with in my many
attempts at bird-photography, for as soon as one gets near its haunts
off it flies with its piercing warning call.
The nest, if it can be called such, is merely a sci-ape or hollow,
sometimes without any other material than the bare earth, and at
others just a few bents of dried grass, amongst which are deposited
two or more, often three, greenish yellow eggs, plentifully spotted
with black.
The nesting site varies. I have found the eggs laid within
a few feet of high-water mark, and at various heights among bare
rocks, also in the shade of Mallows and amidst the beautiful wealth
of sea-pinks [Thrift].
Both male and female take their turns at incubating, although
it is generally supposed that this is carried on by the female alone.
The particular pair of birds, to which most of my observations refer,
nested on a shelf of rock some ten feet from high-water mark, and
about three feet above the beach. The sitting birds were protected
from the north-east by the rocks at the back. Two eggs were laid,
and when found had most likely been incubated over a week. The
first thing to do on finding a nest with eggs is to test the eggs by
looking through them to see if they are newly-laid or if incubation
is well advanced. If the latter, one need have little fear of the birds
deserting, providing care is taken in fixing up the hide. This is best
done at dusk, as it gives the birds a better chance to get accustomed
to it during the night, and then, by the following morning, most of
their fear will have vanished.
Sea-birds sit very little during hot sunny days, and can leave
their eggs day after day for seven or eight hours at a stretch without
harm ; this I have proved, for the day after I had fixed up the hide
I landed on the island and found that the eggs were warm. Having

On the Oyster Catcher.
set up my camera, I prepared to await the birds home-coming. After
seven hours had passed I began to think something was wrong, for
during this time both birds had been sleeping and feeding within ten
yards of me, and. after a good doze of half-an-hour or so, one of
them would begin to walk towards the nest, covering a few yards
and then retreating. This would go on time after time, the distance
growing less between the bird and the eggs after every effort, till one
felt certain that the next time the bird would surely come on its
nest ; but not so, the bird at this stage would think another sleep
desirable, walk off to its original position and perching itself on a
rock commanding a view of the nest, push its beak in the feathers
of its back and, with one eye always open, doze for a further period.
On the island I was working, which was quite tiny (about
two acres) there w T ere four pairs of Oyster Catchers nesting, and, at
intervals, the sleeping&amp;apos; pair would be visited by the others. On these
occasions the most extraordinary dance took place. The birds would
strut round each other, beating time to their curious call with their
beautiful coral red beaks. Sometimes this “ dance of the Oyster
Catchers ” would last several minutes, then, one by one, the in¬
truders would fly off leaving my pair to continue their broken sleep
with still one eye always open.
After my long wait, I returned home rather disheartened, but
next morning, on paying a visit to the eggs, I found them quite warm.
My friend therefore took up his position in the hide, and I left him
for the day whilst I visited another island for Ringed Plover. On
returning, I found he had made two exposures, and on the following
day a second friend secured three or four. The fourth day I visited
the hide again, and after ten minutes wait the bird came on the nest
again. I got her to go off twice by talking to her. After this,
however, she took no notice of my voice and so I had to scratch the
canvas of the tent. Eventually she grew so accustomed to me that
she allowed me to put my hand out of the front of the tent and
remove the lens and replace it with one of a longer focus. This
shows how a bird can be accustomed to almost anything provided
one has time, and is almost on a par with my friend C. J. King’s
experience when stalking a Shag. Of course he is a past master at
the art and had got so near to the bird that it completely covered

the field of a half-plate. He then began to wonder how near he
really could get, so crept slowly on until at length the Shag allowed
him to stroke it on the back. This took quite a long time, for
nothing scares a bird more than sudden movements.
The Oyster Catcher lives principally on small marine insects,
Crustacea, limpets, etc., and the young when hatched are piloted
down to the edge of the water within a few hours of drying. The
parents are very solicitous of their offspring, and if you should by
chance be close to the young, which will “ squat ” down by a stone
and almost defy detection, the old birds will keep flying round
and calling, sometimes coming to within a few feet.
The wonderful red eye of the Oyster Catcher gives it a fierce
look which is in keeping with its character. When defending its
young it is afraid of no birds frequenting its realms, not even the
Greater Black-backed Gull.

Since my last instalment of these notes appeared in the
August number, interesting new arrivals to the collection have been
few. Five examples of the Seed Snipe ( Thinocorys ) were received,
four of these being males, apparently the first consigment of these
very interesting and puzzling little birds. Mr. Astley secured the
other two, and as both he and Dr. Gosse have written about them
in these pages I have nothing further to add, except that they
seem as though they are likely to do well, and I hope that both our
Editor and the Zoological Society may be successful in breeding
from them next year.
In the Summer Aviary we succeeded in breeding the Spotted
Tinamou (Nothoprocta maculosa ), a common bird in the Argentine,
but one seldom seen in aviaries. It is very small for a Tinamou,
not much larger than a quail, and the sexes are just alike. We had
three birds of which we did not know the sexes. A nest, composed

of a few bits of grass and leaves, was formed in the long grass : three
glossy purple eggs were laid, and the bird (presumably the male, for
in this group the male alone sits) sat steadily for three weeks, all
three eggs hatching.
The young birds were of a pale buffish-brown colour with
three dark brown stripes on the head. The down with which they
were clothed was very long and hair-like, giving the chick the
appearance of being covered with spines. They appeared to be some¬
what weak, and we discovered that the parent bird seemed to take
very little interest in them, and they would undoubtedly have died
had we not taken them and placed them with a bantam, which took
to them at once and successfully reared them. Subsequently a
second brood of two was reared in the same way.
In the summer we liberated seven Roseate Cockatoos in the
hope that they would remain in the Gardens. For a time they did
so, and the flight of this flock as they circled about over the trees
was well worth a special visit to London to see. They stayed about
in the trees during the heat of the day, but about sunset, with loud
cries, they flew high into the air and took long flights round the
Park. One by one, however, they disappeared. They were some¬
what tame, and, I have no doubt, allowed themselves to be captured
by some unscrupulous person or persons who, I suppose, managed
to get a few shillings each for them.
In one of the aviaries in the Small Bird House a pair of
Spot-billed Toucanets (Seleniclera maculirostris ) have their abode,
and as they seemed very friendly towards one another, we fixed
them up a nesting log, of the type that one uses for Parrakeets.
It was at once appropriated by them, and after a short time it was
noticed that the hen spent a good deal of her time inside. This
went on for some time, and then, when she came out, the cock took
her place. We guessed that the hen had laid, and when, one day
the keeper noticed both birds were out, he climbed up and peeped in,
and there, sure enough, were two white glossy eggs.
About four weeks, as we judged, after the eggs had been first
laid, it was noticed that both birds had left the nest and ceased to
visit it, and an inspection revealed the fact that this was empty.

We can only presume that young had been hatched but, apparently,
devoured by their parents.
The birds commenced to visit the nest again, and we knew
there must be eggs, for they again took turns in the nest, and were
evidently sitting.
On July 29th, when, as far as we could judge, incubation had
been going on for three weeks, the birds were noticed to take food
into the nest. Evidently a young bird or young birds had been
hatched.
On August 5th the keeper looked into the log and discovered
a naked young bird, apparently well nourished. On August 14th it
was about half as large as its parents, with dark feathers showing.
The birds fed the young one entirely upon animal food, cockroaches,
mealworms and gentles. No fruit was taken to the nest, so far as
the keepers could tell.
On the 21st of August the parents ceased to visit the nest,
and the young bird was found to be dead.
An interesting and valuable collection of birds has just arrived
from Para, a present from the Museu Goeldi, through the interme¬
diary of Messrs. A. and H. Pam. It contains twenty-four birds, of
which the most interesting are the American Tantalus ( Tantalus

Falcon’s nursery, with minutely recorded details of the babies’ beha¬
viour and diet, not to mention the parents’ mode of living as anxious
husband and wife who realize their great responsibilities, make up a
book of unusual interest; showing how absorbing the very smallest
details can be in recording the daily life of any creature carefully and
patiently watched ; how it is that just those very details, unseen
and unnoticed by the man in the street, enhance the interest, teach¬
ing one to look more closely into nature ; to learn of her rather than
destroy. And on the destruction of such birds as the Peregrine,
Mr. Heatherly has something to say, warning us against the wiles
of the egg-shell collectors, helping us to throw stumbling-blocks in
their way. “ A simple method,” he writes, “is to wet each egg and
“ then scrawl all over it with a violet marking-ink pencil. This has
“no prejudicial effect on incubation, but renders the egg useless to
“ collectors, as the violet marks are more indelible than the natural
“ blotches.”
To put a stop to these greedy destroyers, we gladly accept any
means of selling them, whereby we can prevent them from selling!
To climb up and take a clutch of Peregrine’s eggs need not
be always difficult ; any fool who can shoot at all, can kill the parent
birds; let those who are really sportsmen try to do what Mr.
Heatherley and his companions did, leaving many species which are
in danger of extinction to rejoice in life and reproduction of life,
whilst giving to the world a record of interest, with the satisfaction
that good and not harm has been done. H. D. A.
THE EMU.
We have received copies of this interesting publication of
January, April, and July, 1913.
A paper worth reading, amongst others, in the January No.
is one on the habits of the Cassowary by H. L. White, in the
Rockingham Bay district, the eggs of which bird appear to be ex¬
tremely difficult to find. Two excellent photographs accompany the
article, of the nests and eggs of Cassowaries, the one concealed in
Palm Scrub, the other amid a tangle of ‘ Lawyer ’ canes.

lengthy treatise upon the osteology of the Cereopsis Goose, we are
told that it is necessary to record a complete description of its
skeleton, because “ this extraordinary fowl is now on the road to
extinction ” ! !
Capt. S. A. White’s paper on Field Ornithology on Kangaroo
Island is interesting. Amongst numerous birds, he mentions meet¬
ing with the Kangaroo Island Crimson Parrot ( Platycercus melanop-
tera ) and the Black Cockatoo ( Calyptorhynchus ivhitece).
The July No. also has a lengthy article by Capt. S. A. White
on Field Ornithology in S. Australia (The Gawler Ranges), in which
he tells his readers that probably the first ornithologist to work that
country was Mr. J. F. Andrews in 1880, who mentions in letters
written at that time, that amongst other skins he obtained those of
the Night-Parrot ( Geopsittacus occidentals) for a trifling sum, so
that evidently these birds were much more numerous then than they
are now.
“ Bird-Life of Kow Plains ” (Victoria) by L. G. Chandler

At the commencement of the Magazine’s year, may I once more, whilst
thanking those members who so generously responded to my appeal, again
remind others that in order to maintain and increase the quantity and quality
of our illustrations, donations to the fund are needed. One would like to publish
a coloured illustration every month, for no mere black and white one can do
justice to, or give a full idea of, many species of birds.
Quite lately one of our members told me that he was enabled to procure
one particular species from China, owing to his sending out a coloured illustra¬
tion from our Magazine, which was at once recognized by a Chinaman who had
been asked to procure the living birds.
No description or black and white drawing is of any assistance to many
natives of different countries ; indeed the same thing often applies in our own
case. Hubert D. ASTLEY, Editor.

SOME BIRDS FROM YUCATAN.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995803625" page_id="32669446"  page_num="52" year="" vol="">
At the end of September Major Horsbrugh deposited at the London Zoo¬
logical Gardens some birds which had been brought from Yucatan, amongst
which were two species of Mocking Birds, one of which seems to be Mimus
gilvus, syn. gracilis. There were two of them, charmingly tame, and quite
youngsters, still at that time opening their mouths wide for food, They are in
my possession and are smaller than the better known M. polyglottus — the North
American Mocking-Bird ; the head and mantle are of a purer ash-grey, with the
wings and central tail feathers blacker. The Mocking-Birds are somewhat
difficult to distinguish, for there are many of them, and all bear a very close
family resemblance.
Some Red Cardinals in this collection seem to be merely a rather smaller
race of the N. American birds, and the male is more vermilion in colour.
Two species of Hangnests ( Icterus mesomelas mesomelas and another), very
handsome, with shorter bills and more refined heads than has the “common”
Hangnest.
Five Yucatan Jays ( Cissolopha yucaianica) all but nestlings, their heads
still whitish instead of black. When young this bird is white, gradually
changing to the adult plumage, which is very handsome. Bill, head, and
underparts, black ; upper parts, with long tail, smalt Kingfisher blue. Yellow
rim of skin round eyes. Legs and feet orange yellow.
The Yucatan birds ought to be hardy, for Mr. Gaumer wrote about the
climate and seasons as follows : —
“ I reached Yucatan on the 14tli of Oct. in the first heavy norther of the
” season. The weather had been good for some ten days before, the summer

SIR,—Having read in the Avicultural Magcizineior October of the longevity
of birds in captivity, I think it may be of interest to some of your readers to
know that I had a White-eared Bulbul given to me on Sept. 16th, 1S75, which
only died (in a fit) on May 3rd, 1893. It travelled about with me wherever I
went, both abroad and in the British Isles, and was absolutely tame, always
flying on to my finger directly it was called. It lived a great deal out loose in my
room and I even used to let it out in the train when I could have the windows
shut and 1 knew no one would open the door, F. HAREWOOD.

SIR,—Mr, Teschemaker’s interesting article on the White Wagtail raises
the point as to whether it is a very rare breeding bird in England or not. Per¬
sonally I am inclined to think that it is often casually mistaken for the Pied
Wagtail ( M. lugubris ) owing to the difference in the colouring on back and wings
being overlooked.
There were certainly a pair this year near the coast of Northumberland,
not far from Holy Island, though I did not find the nest myself.

I always felt that we wanted something of a special kind to keep small

The following answers were received from Mr. Silver :—
(i.) SIR,—In answer to your note with reference to sample of seed known as
Accha (?) I went up to South Kensington this morning to try and find out some¬
thing about it. There they do not know it, cannot identify it, or find any
reference to it whatever. In my botany (Bentley) there is a reference to a plant
(graminaceous) called Paspalum exile, which the natives call Fundi or Fundingi
and it is described as the smallest seed grown as a cereal. Pennisetum dichotomum
is called “ Kasheia,” but I do not know either of them. Mr. Trower has never
seen it commercially, but it will be shown to Hurst, the seed importers, after
which I will write you, and in the meantime I will plant some and try to get it
identified from the plant. ALLEN SILVER.

(ii.) I am informed by the authorities at Kew Gardens that the seed appears
to be Paspalum exile, and is known in Gambia as Hungry Rice Fundi, or
Fundungi. It is not known by the London houses commercially.

SIR, — I take the present opportunity of advising members that, in addition
to the extensive classification for Foreign Birds, to be given at the London Cage
Bird Association’s Show, which will be held at the Horticultural Hall on Nov.
27, 28. and 29th, a class has been added for Gouldians and extra one for in¬
sectivorous birds, making a total of 30 classes. You kindly printed particulars
of this earlier in the year, and I again beg to remind those members who may be
inclined to show birds that I should be pleased to supply them with any informa¬
tion they require. There will be no cancellation or amalgamation and full prize
money will be paid in all classes, and every care will be taken with the exhibits
by experienced hands.
If this venture is properly supported, the League will be able to provide a
really good annual fixture. Entries close on or about the 18th of November and
schedules will be ready by November the first.
The judges are Mr. D. Seth-Smith and another.

A MOUSE HUNT.
SIR,—Some time ago. when I was on a visit to the Zoological Gardens, I
was much interested in watching the curious way in which a hen Reeves’
Pheasant was behaving. I stood still observing her movements for some time,
and then saw that a mouse seemed to be the cause of her trouble. The bird was
continually running after it, as if trying to catch it, and after some time gave
the chase up as if tired of the game.
The cock bird then took up the running, and after a sharp chase eventually
caught the mouse, which he held in his beak, notwithstanding its struggles, and
walked about as if he was very proud of his capture. Then he proceeded to
shake the mouse just as a terrier would a rat, and after it was dead, threw it up
into the air, caught it in his beak and swallowed it whole.
I was not aware that pheasants ever fed in this way, or upon such food,
and upon mentioning these facts at a meeting of the B.O.C., was informed by
the late Mr. Tegelmeier that he had never heard of such a case. I thought it
possible these facts may be of interest to the readers of the Magazine.

BIRDS LAYING TWO EGGS IN TWENTY-FOUR HOURS.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992062090909091" page_id="32669449"  page_num="55" year="" vol="">
SIR,—I have read in the A vicultural Magazine of June 1907, on page
255, a letter from Mr. Bonhote recording instances of birds laying two eggs in
twenty-four hours. Mr. Bonhote, in the last paragraph of his letter, asks if any
of our members could furnish further iustances.
I have in my collection of parrots’ eggs, three eggs of the Undulated
Grass Parrakeet (Melopsittacus undulatus ) that were laid in the night, 13th
November, 1912. These eggs are abnormal, being about a quarter the size of the
typical egg. I could supply the exact measurements if it is considered necessary.
The chief point of interest about these eggs is the colour, which is a light blue.
I have a fine collection of parrot eggs, and some hundreds have passed
through my hands, but these are the first specimens I have ever seen coloured.
I may add that a similar egg was laid by the same bird and coloured in the same
way a day or so afterwards. This egg I also possess. H. MUNT.
[Such eggs ought to produce Blue Budgerigars.—ED.]
THE NIGHTJAR.
SIR,—Miss Leeke will perhaps pardon me if I tell her that the bird she
heard and saw flying at a height round a marshy meadow last June was not a
Nightjar but a Common Snipe, executing those peculiar evolutions which it
usually indulges in during the breeding season. She is not the first to be deceived
by the strange sound made by this bird in passing obliquely downward through
the air and which naturalists usually call “drumming.” We are suddenly
arrested by hearing a tremulous sound, much resembiing that of a lamb bleating

on the uplands, and from which the Snipe is sometimes called the “heather
hleater,” the prefix of heather being added from the Snipe often breeding
amongst heather.
The bird sweeps round in circles in the sky when suddenly it seems to fall
obliquely downwards, and in so doing produces the drumming or bleating sound.
If we watch a Snipe closely we shall notice that every time it swoops downward
the feathers of the tail are widely spread and the wings seems to tremble or
quiver, and I have long held the opinion that the shrieking sound called drum¬
ming or bleating is produced by the passage of the air through the still outspread
feathers of the tail, modulated by the humming made by the quivering feathers
of the wings. F. BOYES, Beverley.
EDITORIAL.
May I express my thanks to all those who have helped me
in my Editorial work by contributing to the Magazine, etc., with a
hope that they will continue to do so.
If other Members who can write any papers or notes will
follow their example, my work will be further enlightened ; being, as
it were, a china nest-egg, never to be hatched, but only to promote
the laying of other egg&amp;apos;s.
If I can have in hand sufficient copy ’ for at any rate a
month ahead of that which is published, I shall be grateful.
An editor cannot expect to please everyone, so that I may
consider myself fortunate in having met with almost unvarying
courtesy from the Members of the Society.
Being a mere amateur at the work, and having often to
snatch half-hours here and there in which to write and answer
letters, etc., in addition to sometimes attempting to illustrate the
Magazine, I feel that Members will very kindly continue to bear
with any shortcomings.

HORNBILLS.
By Graham Renshaw, M.B.
The curious birds known as Hornbills must be reckoned
amongst the rarities of aviculture. Quaint, intelligent, amusing,
they are unfortunately but little known to the private aviarist. Long
acquaintance with the principal European Zoos has shown the
present writer that comparatively few species are regularly exhibited :
even in dealers’ lists they figure spasmodically and uncertainly, but
two or three times a year. Apparently the finest collection of living
Hornbills is to be seen in the Gardens in Regent’s Park. For many
years the writer has taken a special interest in Hornbills, and has
found them to well repay the closest study.
Ground Hornbills present a remarkable appearance owing to
the ‘ eyelashes ” [modified feathers] which fringe the lids. Essen¬
tially terrestrial, when on the ground they suggest dishevelled,
monstrous turkeys with the nightmare beaks of Toucans. They
walk well, but are quite able to fly. Ground Hornbills in captivity
are exceedingly playful. They are fond of amusing themselves with
any small movable object such as an iron bar or rod, dancing round
it with much display of their wings. Probably they make believe
that their toy is a snake or other reptile, seizing and dropping it
repeatedly, as if to swiftly disable some dangerous prey. Two
species are recognised, one from Abyssinia {Bucorax ctbyssinicus),
the other from South Africa (B- cafer ).
The Black Hornbill (Sphagolobus atratus ) is a West African
species: one kept by the writer proved a most charming pet.

On Hornbills.
Exceedingly tame, this bird enjoyed being caressed, allowed itself to
be picked up without struggling, and fed readily from the hand. It
enjoyed being scratched on the back of the head, slowly bending&amp;apos; its
head and raising the crown and nape feathers in parrot fashion. It
could catch any food thrown to it, “ fielding ” the morsels with
marvellous unerring accuracy. The cry of this bird was loud and
harsh. The building in which it was kept was warmed by a stove,
before which the bird would squat at night, like a dog crouching
before a fire. Always good tempered and alert, this Hornbill used
to amuse itself by jabbing at the stove with closed beak : it never
attempted to bite anyone. On the ground it progressed in a series
of long hops. Other individuals which I have observed flew well,
making a loud swishing sound which has aptly been compared by
travellers to the puffing of a railway engine.
The Rhinoceros Hornbill ( Buceros rhinoceros ) is but little
known to aviculture. At present there is a very fine example in the
Bird House at the Amsterdam Zoological Gardens, obtained from
Sumatra. It appears to agree very well with the mixed collection of
birds which share its cage. During the hot part of the day this
Hornbill prefers to sit aloft, high up on a suitable perch. I do not
remember seeing this species alive in the United Kingdom.
The “Two-horned” Hornbill (Dichoceros bicornis) is perhaps
the oftenest imported species. It is of large size and somewhat
clumsily built, and is further remarkable for its hoarse braying cry.
As far as the writer has been able to observe, this is a sluggish
species in captivity, entirely lacking the vivacity that characterises
the enterprising, alert Ground Hornbills or the vivacious black
species. Its quaint appearance is its chief claim to the attention of
the aviculturist; possibly it requires a warmer temperature than is
generally allotted to it, in order to display suitably its mental
characteristics.
Temminck’s Pied Hornbill ( Anthracoceros convexus) is a small
bird of convenient size for the aviary. In summer it can be kept
out of doors in the day time : it will eat fish, frogs, mice, grapes and
bananas. Some years ago I saw five of these Lesser Hornbills in
the same cage in the Antwerp Zoo. : occasionally they figure in
dealers’ lists in this country. In common with so many picarian

birds, these Hornbills have the curious habit of shaking their plum¬
age as if shivering. I can cordially recommend them as pets.
The Pigmy Hornbills of the genus Lophoceros, though ap¬
parently very little known in captivity, are sometimes exhibited in
-Continental collections. A few years ago I saw an example in the
Jardin des Plantes, and a few weeks ago another in the Bird House
at Antwerp. These were apparently the grey South African species
(L. epirhinus), and in many years of study were the first living
examples seen by the writer.
Hornbills are easily kept and can be acclimatized like any
other birds. Like all creatures which have succeeded in the battle of
life, they have most accommodating appetites and will eat almost
anything—boiled rice, chopped bananas, fruits of various descriptions,
fish, small birds, mice. Although possessed of harsh voices their
cries are not disagreeable : the Pigmy Hornbills indeed are said to
warble like a Thrush. Hornbills are certainly gifted with high
intelligence, are affectionate, and soon become attached to their
owner. In winter a warm room should be provided for them ; in
summer they may be kept outdoors in the day time. Like parrots
they are subject to tuberculosis. The Black Hornbill mentioned
above was examined by the writer after death : the liver was studded
over with characteristic small, pale tubercular nodules.

Platycercince.
By The Marquis of Tavistock.
Having had some experience of the majority of the Broadtail
Parrakeets, I should say that, when adult, they are not on the whole
■very difficult birds to sex ; nothing like so hard, for instance, as the
true Parrots, Conures, and Macaws.
I quite agree with Dr. Lovell-Keays, however, that the sexing
of immature specimens is in most cases largely a matter of guess work,
though I am rather surprised to see that he mentions Piedrumps as
being difficult to distinguish when young. I have never bred Red-
rumps, although I have seen some not more than a few months old,
and I have always been under the impression that the immature

The Marquis of Tavistock,
cocks were very much greener than the hens from the time they left
the nest; probably, however, I have been wrong, and anyone who
has bred Redrumps will of course know what they look like in their
first plumage.
I wdll now deal briefly with such of the Platycercince as I
have kept, referring to what I consider the principal external sexual
differences and the degree in which they are apparent.
COMMON Rosella. Adult hen decidedly smaller than the cock
and with a smaller head and beak. Body colours usually less,
bright ; the red bib smaller and its edges much more uneven.
An adult cock is quite unmistakable, but it is possible to confuse
an adult hen with a young cock. The best way is to look at
the back of the head ; in most young birds there is a strip of
green about half inch wide, running from the neck right up on
to the crown. In old hens this is seldom noticeable, and the
green strip, if it exists at all, is shorter, irregular in outline, and
frequently edged with orange yellow.
Yellow-mantled Rosella. The only living specimen of this,
beautiful local race I have ever seen, was an old cock, till lately
in my possession. The sexual differences of plumage, size, etc.
would undoubtedly be the same as in P. eximius. In Gould’s
“Birds of Australia ” there is a figure of a parrakeet with an
almost entirely yellow head, which is described as an immature
P. splendidus. It is, however, very improbable that young
Yellow-mantles differ so remarkably from young Red Rosellas
as to possess yellow heads, and it is much more likely that the
bird from which the figure was taken was an abnormally-coloured
adult, possibly with a dash of Mealy Rosella in its pedigree. I
am, indeed, half inclined to think that Yellow-mantles are of
hybrid origin.
Mealy Rosella and Blue-cheeked Parrakeet. Cock rather
larger than the hen and a little brighter coloured. Head deci¬
dedly larger and squarer than that of the female.
BROWN’S Parrakeet. Cock a shade larger than the hen, with, in
* The males are easily distinguished, for amongst other differences, they
have some red on the rump. — E d.

most cases, considerably more black about him. Head and
beak of the male always decidedly larger and heavier. Hen
Brown’s vary a good deal in colour, some being much brighter
and more heavily marked than others. This fact, combined
with the great excess in the number of females imported, is
responsible for the frequent mistakes made in sexing this
parrakeet.
PENNANT’S PARRAKEET. Hen decidedly smaller than the cock,
with a smaller head and beak ; in captivity often duller in
colour, but not invariably so. An easy species to sex.
ADELAIDE Parrakeet. Hen rather smaller and sometimes much
redder than the cock. Beak and head also smaller, but many
cock Adelaides have rather narrow beaks, which makes them
somewhat deceptive birds to sex.
Yellow-bellied Parrakeet. Hen decidedly smaller than the
cock with a much smaller head and beak. The species is an
easy one to sex.
Yellow - rumped Parrakeet. Cock rather larger and brighter
than the hen; beak a little broader. Difference in the appear¬
ance of the sexes, often slight, as in the case of the Adelaides.
Barnard’s PARRAKEET. Hen a little smaller than the cock and
usually less blue. Head smaller and bill much narrower.
Bauer’s Parrakeet. Sexes much alike in colour, but the hen is
decidedly smaller and has a much smaller head and beak.
Yellow-collared Parrakeet. Hen smaller than the cock, with
a rather smaller head and narrower beak. The great size of
this bird—the largest of the Broadtails—makes one rather apt
to mistake single hens for cocks, when one has no opportunity
of comparing them with males of their species.
Stanley Parrakeet. Hen easily distinguishable by her dull and
patchy tints. Her head is mainly green; her cheek patches
very dull in colour and her breast with a lot of green feathers
interspersed among the red. Young cocks have usually a little
more red on their heads than young hens of the same age, or
even than old hens. In some cases they assume the crimson
breast of the adult in the course of their first autumn, but
not as a rule before they are eighteen months old. Gould’s

Mrs. Warren Yernon,
statement that the sexes when adult are alike, appears to be
incorrect.
RED-CAhPED PARRAKEET. Hen duller in colour than the cock :
cap usually streaked with green, even in old birds. Hen Red-
capped Parrakeets appear to retain their immature dress much
longer than males.
Red-vented Blue-Bonnet.) Cock rather larger and brighter
Common Blue-Bonnet. 1 than the hen, with a slightly
larger beak ; more vigorous and perky in demeanour, and
“bobs” with greater energy when alarmed,
easy one to sex.
Redrump and other Pseplioti. Sexes easily distinguishable by
striking differences of colour.
BOURKE&amp;apos;S PARRAKEET. Adult cock rather brighter coloured than
the hen, but extremely hard to distinguish. When in breeding
condition he has a habit of occasionally drawing himself up
and slightly depressing his shoulders. The best way of sexing
Bourke’s is therefore, if possible, to watch their behaviour in
an aviary. [The head of the female is smaller, the skull less
broad, whilst the male has more blue over the cere, etc.— Ed.]
Of the Elegant and Blue-winged Grass Parrakeets I
have had so little experience that I can only say that I am inclined
to think that the males have rather larger and squarer heads than
their mates. Slight differences in plumage are I believe said to
exist, but I have not been able to observe them.
A TAME HUNTING CISSA.
By Mrs. Warren Yernon.
A few weeks ago, Mr. Erost told me he had a very charming
pet — a Hunting Cissa. I was at that time feeling very virtuous and
quite determined to buy no more birds,&amp;apos;at&amp;apos;any rate till after Xmas.
Alas ! for human nature when hobbies come in. One morning, a
few days later, my maid brought a large travelling cage and said “A
bird has come I was expecting none, and was very much surprised.

looking at me, through a piece of thin perforated tin, a lovely bright
eye and saw also a scarlet beak. Before that bird was quite un¬
packed all the good resolutions were forgotten.
I must say he is the most delightful pet one could keep,
besides being so pretty. At present he is deep in his moult and
looks more like a porcupine than a bird.
Now as to his funny ways. The first thing&amp;apos; in the morning
he comes out in my room to be petted ; he likes to be held in your two
hands and stroked and told he is lovely, growling all the time. He
then helps himself to a small piece of butter off my tea tray, and
holds it in his mouth till nearly melted, when he swallows it with a
gulp. I take him on my hand into the bath-room, where he at once
takes a bath in tepid water, and sits on the back of a chair in the
sun to dry. Everything that is bright is carried away, and generally
my dressing table is denuded of all the smaller things. He buries
anything he likes very much, under a quilt or the corner of a cushion.
I have never met a bird so free from fear : the only thing he hates is
a dog, and the awful noise he makes, terrifies them as much as he is
terrified himself. I caught him carrying off a ring the other day,
and we had quite a fight before he would give it up.
I feed him on “ Perfecto,” Mr. Galloway’s food, and York
cheese, and he has a small bird such as a Sparrow when one is
caught, also some raw meat as he is moulting so heavily. He likes
raw peas in their pods, flies, and gentles. He found the mealworm
pan the other day, and I was wondering what mischief he was up to
as he was so quiet : I found him simply gorging as fast as he could
pick them out. He will also eat potato and rice.
I let him fly about as often as possible, and for a large bird I
have never noticed so little smell: he is very clean and, in fact, quite
a companion.

The Crucial Stage of the Manitoba Wild Duck Expedition
—Hatching, Rearing and Transporting the Ducklings.
Somehow it seemed as though the breezy, bracing atmosphere
of the wild Manitoba prairie, while it sparkled with exhilaration, was
tremulous also with interrogation. Everything that we were under¬
taking was new and without precedent. Questions and problems
confronted us on every hand. Perhaps we might fail. It was con¬
siderable of a load of responsibility.
One of the fundamental questions confronting us was whether
eggs could be safely transported, or whether it would be necessary to
try to hatch them and raise the young before starting back. In
either case there were uncertainties, so I had decided to try both
methods. During&amp;apos; the first few days of the hunt we found quite a
few ducks’ nests with fresh, incomplete sets, six eggs or less. The
normal full set is usually eight to eleven eggs, and occasionally there
are even more. I have found as many as twenty-two ! Picking up
now a few of these incomplete sets, I sent them on by express.
They were at once set, and before the trip was half over I knew the
result. Not a single one developed an embryo.
From previous investigation I knew it was hopeless to trans¬
port eggs in the earlier stages of incubation, as the jar was sure to
break the delicate blood-vessels. I had learned, though, that the
embryos within a few days of hatching could stand a good deal.
Mr. C. AVilliam Beebe, of the New York Zoological Park, had
brought incubated seabirds’ eggs from Virginia to New York, without
artificial heat, which had hatched normally on arrival. In case it
should prove expedient, I had thought to attempt transporting some
in lighted incubators on the cars, and had secured special permission
from the express companies.
An early incident of the expedition showed how much punish¬
ment incubated eggs would stand. On a driving trip, off exploring,
we found a set of thirteen Gadwalls’ eggs on an island, thirty miles
from camp. Wrapping them in a rubber-coated focus-cloth to retain

the heat, ancl putting them in a creel, they were carried all the
afternoon in a boat, then set under a hen at a ranch at night, and
driven all the next day over rough prairie trails. The weather was
hot all the time, and upon arrival the eggs were fully as warm as
when taken from the nest. The assistant had carried the creel all
day in his hands, to save the eggs from the jolting as much as
possible. Two days and a half later every one of the thirteen
hatched. Eleven of these ducklings, as I now write, grown to
maturity, are happy and active in their new surroundings in our
“effete” civilization of the East. Evidently the “rough riding”
experience did them no harm.
This was our first batch, one hundred per cent, which came
off on the 2nd of July. Rejoiced at this auspicious beginning, next
morning the assistant and I started out in the canoe and collected
the various sets of ducks’ eggs previously found, most of them
heavily incubated. JThe incubator was now considerably filled. How
handsome the tray looked, as we took it out for cooling and sprink¬
ling each day, how entrancingly interesting, with all those eggs of so
many shades and sizes, freighted, too, with such possibilities ! The
unitiated would say that they looked much alike, hut years of ex¬
perience reveal real differences in shade, size, and texture. The only
kinds in that region that are indistinguishable are the eggs of Gad-
wall and Baldpate, both of which range&amp;apos; from pure white to creamy,
and those of the two Teals, which are small and creamy white.
Day by day other sets were added, and the wonder and interest
grew.
Right here we were, from necessity, violating one of the
fundamental rules of incubator work, never to put in one machine
eggs at different times and in different stages of incubation. It was
clearly impossible to provide, out there in the wilderness, a separate
machine for every set of eggs. Setting hens, moreover, could not
be had, So we had to take chances on spoling the eggs.
Here were the iucubator methods used. In the main room
of the lodge, which was built of logs and plastered, we ran the incu¬
bators, which were kept at 103 degrees. Once a day we cooled the
eggs, till the temperature felt neutral when the egg was laid against
the eyelid. Then the tray was laid on the floor, and water, com-

Mr. Herbert K. Job,
fortably warm to the hand, w 7 as dashed over the eggs. They were
then turned, the other side sprinkled, and then placed back in the
machine. Two towels were then soaked in quite hot water and
placed, almost dripping, on the tray below the eggs. In cool weather,
when the temperature was slow in recovering, the regulator was shut
down temporarily, to hasten matters.
As soon as any set of eggs showed signs of hatching, it was
removed to the second incubator, which was run at 104 degrees,
which was maintained till the hatch was complete. The ducklings
were kept in the machine from twenty-four to thirty-six hours after-
hatching. Owing to lack of brooder facilities, we sometimes used
the third incubator for another day or two as a brooder, keeping the
door ajar and the temperature from ninety to ninety-five.
After our first hatch no more occurred for nearly a week.
Then business came with a rush, on July 8th, a memorable day. On
the seventh three sets had begun to pip, one each of Redhead, Lesser
Scaup, and Pintail. This morning, as I went forth to hunt Ruddy
Ducks’ nests, two little Redheads were already out. At dinner time,
when I returned successful, the batch was actively in progress, the
eggs popping almost like corn over a fire.
It was so exciting and fascinating that we both let dinner
wait and sat in front of the machine to watch, How they did come!
First the shell was chipped nearly round. Pulsations more and more
violent ! Off bursts the larger end of the shell. A few more struggles,
the head is out; then again, and the soaking little novice tumbles all
over himself and everything else. Getting his balance, he takes a
look around, and immediately goes to preening, as though his mother
had previously whispered to him just what to do.
The afternoon was still young when the hatch was complete.
Of twenty-four eggs, only three had failed to hatch — one infertile,
one with dead chick, and one rotten. One set, the Scaups’, hatched
every egg. Our next hatch, a set of Redhead, on the eleventh,
yielded another one hundred per cent, as did next day a set of what we
hoped were Baldpate or American Widgeon, but which proved to be
Gadwall. By this time it seemed so natural to hatch every egg of a
set that we were surprised and even a hit regretful if even a single
egg failed. As, for instance, on the twelfth also, when our small set

of four ruddy’s eggs came to term. All four were pipped, and three
came out promptly. The other duckling was having a hard struggle
and seemed to be stuck. After a time I decided to assist, but it was
too late. The little fellow had died from exhaustion.
So it ran on from time to time. The next four sets hatched
consecutively one hundred per cent. The poorest hatch of all was a
set of Blue-winged Teal, from which we got five good ducklings,
three nearly ready to hatch, being dead in the shell. This was pro¬
bably due to my forgetting the eggs when they were out cooling,
Yet even that result was not bad.
On tabulating the records, I find that only three eggs were
infertile, and very few embryos failed to hatch. In over half the
sets every egg hatched, the average hatch for the season being
ninety-two per cent, which is certainly remarkable, far surpassing
the results in ordinary poultry work. This was despite the dis¬
advantages of placing miscellaneous eggs in the same machine,
transporting them for miles at critical stages of incubation, and
subjecting them to the abrupt change of conditions. Probably it is
the great vigour and virility of this wild stock, hardened to rigorous
climatic conditions, that accounts for this astonishiug percentage.
To revert to stern realities, lack of brooders was one of our
principal causes for anxiety. All we had at first was an indoor
hover, with hot water heater. The large outdoor brooder we had
ordered was delayed in transportation. The weather was cold and
stormy, and, even in the kitchen, that hover would not heat up to
over eighty degrees. We had to keep our first brood quite a while
in the incubator. Finally, getting the hover enclosed in a box and
building a fire in the stove to warm the room, we ventured to transfer
the ducklings. During rare periods of sunshine we transferred the
ducklings by hand outdoors to a wire run on the lee side of the cot¬
tage, partly sheltered from the raging prairie wind. As other broods
hatched, we had our hands more than full and saved the ducklings
only by unremitting toil. Finally, one day, the assistant discovered
the long-desired brooder behind an unused cottage, where a drunken
driver had dumped it the night before.
Everyone familiar with young wild ducks knows what shy-
skulkers they are, having a supposed inherent and unconquerable

Mr. Herbert K. Job,
wildness. This notion may now be consigned to the scrap-heap.
These ducklings, of various kinds, hatched artificially, away from the
influence and teaching of the wild mother, have absolutely no fear of
man. Instead of fleeing from us, they simply would not get out of
the way, and we had to be very careful, in the runways, not to step
on them.
Of all the hungry creatures I ever saw, these took the prize.
The instant I appeared, an hour or more after any meal, they would
rush at me in a frantic mob, piping, struggling, jumping on one
another. If I reached out my hand to remove an empty water
fountain, they would almost eat me up ! When the two heaping
plates of food were placed oil the ground to divide the mob, they
simply hurled themselves at the dishes, each one gulping, gobbling,
shovelling, for all it was worth. One species is specially named
“ shoveller.” but, bless them, every one is a shoveller from the word
“go !” After about two or three mouthfuls, each duckling hustles to
get a drink and wash it down, sifting the water through its bill.
A quart of water did not last any time. It was necessary to use
drinking fountains to keep them from getting soaked, and even then
they got all too wet. We improvised small fountains for the smaller
ones with saucers and tin cans with holes cut in them.
The crucical question now was whether the food would
nourish the ducklings properly. The first week with that first
brood was an anxious one. Every day I was afraid that they
would begin to die off. In a few days one did die, and we held
an anxious post mortem. The others, though grew and flourished.
As the next broods hatched, we could see that the first had made
great gain in size. Another stage of the battle was won. In fact,
for all except the Kuddies and Scoters the food proved wholly suit¬
able. They all thrived on it, and there was not one single death
by indigestion or disease the whole trip.
The feeding system was as follows : The main staples were
raw oatmeal and a special wild duck meal. For nursery food we
began with three parts of oatmeal to one of duck meal, mixed with
barely enough water to moisten, not sloppy. Into this was mixed
also a moderate amount of coarse, sharp sand, not over ten per cent.
This, I believe, is absolutely essential for proper digestion. Also we

kept by them a dish of fine grit and charcoal, and plenty of fresh
water. As they grew older we increased the proportion of duck
meal, till, at over two weeks old, it was about half and half.
Hard-boiled egg, finely ground up, shell and all, is also a
most desirable food. Whenever eggs could be secured, we fed these
once a day, mingled with sand and diluted with oatmeal. The duck¬
lings were eager for this above everything else. It was very hard to
secure eggs from the settlers. Another time I would have cheap
eggs shipped out from civilization in case lots. From about five
days old and on we fed a little crissel, a preparation of dried clean
lean meat, but it must be used sparingly. From the age of two
weeks I began to add a little chick-grain, and from a month old and
on they had a considerable quantity of this.
Green vegetable food is important. Having the ducklings
out on the grass, we frequently changed the location of the yards,
and they soon stripped the leaves off the weeds. As substitutes for
lettuce and cabbage, we pulled up armsful of cat-tails and rushes in
the adjoining marsh, and chopped up the tender inside growth, down
near the root, for which the ducklings were always eager.
During the downy stage we fed them five times a day, as
much as they would eat up clean in a short time, reducing the
number of meals as they grew larger. Three times is enough when
they are getting fledged and two thereafter.
I did not dare to give them water to swim in, especially as the
weather was cold nearly all the time. Under proper conditions, on
warm days, however, they really need an occasional short bath, to
prevent their plumage from getting stuck up. Sometimes I had to
wash them off by hand, and occasionally dry them off in the incubator.
Doubtless it seems strange that ducklings should be kept out of the
water. In the wild state the mother probably keeps them oiled, and
broods them frequently. In confinement, however, they soon be¬
come soaked and chilled, and are apt to die of cramp. We had little
of this, because I did not give them the chance. One or two went
that way, and others I saved by hustling them promptly into the
incubator. Very hot sun is also dangerous, and shade should always
be accessible. The brooder also must not be allowed to get hot.

Mrs. Noel E. Watebfield,
On warm days it should be opened, and the lamp in daytime should
ordinarily be turned very low.
Of our twelve species of ducklings, there were but two for
which our methods were inadequate. — the Ruddy Duck and the
White-winged Scoter. The young scoters are big ducklings, with
black and white down ; beautiful, gentle creatures. They walk around
in an upright attitude, like little men, with a sort of wise air.
Docile, they ate quite freely, though they did not rush and shovel
quite like the others. The food, however, did not nourish them,
and they kept dying.

By Mrs. Noel E. Watebfield.
A few notes on some of the birds that are to be seen in the
Eastern Sudan may be of interest to readers of the Avicultural
Magazine, as, during the winter, the bird population is largely in¬
creased by immigrants from England and more northerly climes.
White Wagtails- Willow Wrens, Whitethroats and Wheatears are all
common in cultivated ground and gardens. The first-named seems
to be the commonest bird of all, and in the desert flocks are to be
seen busily running about with perhaps one or two Yellow Wagtails
who have joined the company. Occasionally a Redstart appears in
the garden or a Red-backed Shrike, but one is struck by the silence
of all the birds ; they are seldom heard, and only to be seen as the
result of much watching. A couple of Bluethroats were the only
birds who seemed to enjoy life, and they were bathing in a pool from
the hose and thoroughly enjoyed themselves and one another’s
society.
The birds all get wonderfully tame, and work diligently for a
living in the sesabau (Parkinsonia) hushes round the little patch of
rough grass, called by courtesy a garden. One other bird who
frequents the house and garden is a Blue Thrush. He sings, though
not very melodiously, and has his special nook for roosting on the
upstair verandah, having kept the same spot for the last three

winters. Perhaps it is his winter plumage, but under a field-glass
all the feathers of his breast appear tipped with grey. *
Everywhere round Port Sudan the country is salt, sandy, and
without vegetation, except where a khor brings down soil from the
hills. It is in these dry water courses that one gets glimpses of
bird-life that are interesting, nay exciting. A beautiful little Bee-
eater, suggestive only of a Swallow but with chestnut orange sides,
sipping honey at the pink blossoms of the wild caper, is a sight not
readily to be forgotten.
But the true desert birds are quiet in their colouring and
wonderfully adapted to their surroundings. First among them for
interest is the little Finch Lark. The male is striking in the curious
arrangement of his colouring. Breast and underparts are jet black,
cheeks white, hack wings and tail mottled sandy colour. It is only
when flying overhead that he can be appreciated, on the stony ground
the bird is invisible.
A beautiful bird and a very common one in the khor is the
Bush Shrike. He flies about en famille during the winter and
breeds in June in a thorny bush. Nesting sites would be hard to
find if he did not want a thorny bush.
The male has a brilliant and irregular carmine marking all
down the breast and a touch of the same colour at the base of the
tail. The hen bird has considerably less carmine to relieve the
sandiness of her plumage.
Another bird always to be seen in the khor is the Desert Chat.
He certainly is the smartest bird imaginable with his black face and
wings, and behaves very much as a Stonechat does at home, taking
up a position on the topmost twig of a bush from which to watch
proceedings.
These few notes cannot close without some mention of the
Egyptian Vulture as he is one of the commonest of birds, and may
be seen by the score in the desert, round a pool after a shower of
rain. Their short tails and slow walk give them a curiously fowl¬
like appearance, so they are well-named Pharoah’s chickens.
* The Blue Rock Thrush has a much more powdered appearance after the
autumn moult, the feathers of the head becoming purer bluein the spring.—ED.

ADELAIDE PARAKEETS.
SOME NOTES AND EXPERIENCES.

Although not, perhaps, one of the most gorgeous members of
the brightly-clad family to which it belongs, the Adelaide Parrakeet
(.Platycercus adelaiclce ) is certainly not the least beautiful: the varied
and rather autumnal tints of its plumage, when seen to advantage,
being seldom forgotten.
It is not very easy to give an accurate description of an adult
cock Adelaide’s plumage, but some idea can be conveyed to those
who have never seen one, by saying that it has the breast and crown
of the head a rosy brick colour, the rides of the neck yellowish buff,
the rump and flanks yellowish or reddish buff and the shoulders
marked with black in the ‘hen pheasant’ pattern seen in the Rosella
and many other AustralianParrakeets. The wings are partly blue and
partly black with some buff or greenish markings, and the tail feathers
are of different shades of blue. Some hen Adelaides closely resemble
the cocks in colour, and are only distinguishable by their smaller
size and slightly duller tints. Others, however, have hardly any
green or buff about them at all, and might almost be mistaken for
small, dull-coloured Pennants. I at one time regarded these very red
birds — they always seem to be hens, I have never seen a cock, dead
or alive — as Pennant hybrids, but I am now rather inclined to think
that this is not the case, for a pair of imported Adelaides, coming
from the same district and perhaps belonging to the same brood, in
which the cock was of the buflish type and the hen very red, pro¬
duced young in which the sexes (now in full colour) are almost alike
in plumage and are indistinguishable from another imported pair in
which there is a similar absence of any marked difference in the
appearance of the male and female.
So much for the colouration of adult Adelaides : now for that
of the young. When first leaving the nest the latter are a golden
olive, yellower on the back than on the breast, with blue cheek
patches, a little red round the throat and some blue in the wings
and tail. During the course of their first autumn and winter they
tend to become rather greener, (though they are never so green as

young Pennants), and there is a slow but continuous growth of red
feathers on the breast and a gradual appearance of the‘hen pheasant ’
pattern on the back. By the time they are twelve months old and
are beginning to think of nesting they are almost as red on the
breast as they will ever become, and the pattern on the back is very
marked, though not yet perfect. There is, however, nothing like the
full amount of blue and black on the wings and the rump is still
yellowish olive and not yellowish or reddish buff. In early autumn,
immediately after breeding, there is a complete moult and the full
adult plumage is assumed. It is rather curious that Gould, in his
‘ Birds of Australia ’ has given figures of what he describes as an
adult Adelaide and one in immature dress. As a matter of fact, the
plate depicts two adult birds — -a hen of the red phase and a cock of
the buff&amp;apos; type. The lower figure (the cock) does not show any of the
markings — or rather lack of markings — really characteristic of im¬
maturity. As an aviary bird the Adelaide possesses the merit of being
absolutely indifferent to cold, when properly acclimatized, not par¬
ticularly destructive to woodwork and easily catered for—wheat,
oats, Canary, millet and hemp, with apple and green stuff, being all
that it requires in the way of food. Grit should, of course, be
supplied, as well as water for drinking and bathing. During the
breeding season a mated cock Adelaide is an impossible neighbour
for any other Platycercus kept in the same aviary. Whether he will
or will not tolerate the presence of other varieties of Parrakeets less
nearly related to him depends a good deal on individual temperament.
He will not, as a rule, interfere with small finches, but as in nearly
all cases, wdrere the latter are kept with parrots or parrakeets, it is
very advisable to protect their sleeping and nesting quarters with
large mesh wire netting, through which they alone are able to pass.
Under these conditions, the casualties, if any occur, wall be confined
to sick birds and very young fledgelings which are not sufficiently
alert to keep out of the way of danger.
In the acclimatization experiment, in which I have been
engaged during the past few years with different species of Australian
parrakeets, the Adelaide has, on the whole, brought me more satis¬
faction than disappointment, which is more than I can say of its
near relative the Pennant, whose exasperating behaviour I am at

present unable to describe in language sufficiently temperate to
appear in the pages of the magazine. This is, I think, due not so
much to the stay-at-home qualities of Adelaides in general, as to the
fact that I was particularly fortunate in my first pair which happened
to be endowed wfitli more sense than others of their kind have sub¬
sequently proved to possess. Their history is as follows :—
In the summer of 1911 I bought from a dealer three young
Adelaides, which appeared to be about twelve months old. They were
in rather poor condition, but on being turned, with cut wings, into a
sunny grass enclosure, they improved steadily, and in a few weeks time
had moulted into adult plumage and were flying about the garden.
One of them wandered away and was picked up dead in an orchard,
too much decomposed for the cause of its death to be ascertainable;
but the survivors, which proved to be a cock and a hen, continued to
stay and throve well. They did not, however, appear to care much
for each other’s company and the hen ultimately paired with a
Pennant. During the course of that winter I bought another
Adelaide, in fine condition, together with his mate, a hen Kosella.
Not then possessing the knowledge with which bitter experience has
since endowed me, I let the pair out together, full-winged. They
stayed for a few days, then the wandering spirit, which is character¬
istic of her kind, asserted itself in the Rosella and she vanished—
and the Adelaide with her. After that, matters ran an uneventful
course until the end of March, when one day I received the dis¬
agreeable information that the cock Adelaide had been picked up
with a broken wing. Wc put him iu a cage, intending&amp;apos; to keep him
safe and well fed, until Nature had repaired the injury, He, how¬
ever, was of opinion that the healing hand of Nature would work
better outside a parrot cage than inside, for, three days later, he
squeezed himself through the bars and disappeared entirely. We
watched for him on the ground feeding trays, but he never came and
was soon given up for dead. What was our surprise, therefore, when
about a month later he suddenly turned up again as strong and well
as ever, except for a slightly ‘ dropped ’ wing, which did not interfere
seriously with his powers of flight. His miraculous return not only
surprised us, but it also, apparently, made a favourable impression
on the hen Adelaide, who deserted her alien husband and took up

■with the ex-invalids The disgusted Pennant departed with all pos¬
sible despatch and was never seen by us again.
The pair of Adelaides had not been together long when the hen
in her turn vanished, and as they had shown no particular signs of
nesting, I imagined that she had followed the Pennant’s example
and that she was lost for good. About this time I received two
more Adelaides from the Continent. They were fine birds, but the
cock proved so insufferably pugnacious that I ultimately sent him
away. The hen I turned out, hoping that she would mate with the
broken-winged bird and prevent him from straying in search of a
wife. She stayed well enough, but to my surprise he took very little
notice of her. Then one day she killed herself by flying against
something—and the outlook seemed gloomy in the extreme. How¬
ever, a few days later, the tide of fortune turned, for after an absence
of about seven weeks the first hen re-appeared, and I saw her in
company with the cock, feeding busily on one of the trays. For
the next fortnight the pair were constantly together and seemed to be
•eating an such abnormal amount of seed, that at length I began to feel
convinced that there must be “ something up.” There w r as ; for one
day came the satisfactory news that the young Adelaides had made
their appearance, and on going out I found four—there ultimately
proved to be six—sitting in a yew tree, uttering their plaintive call
for food. No doubt they had been out of the nest for some time
before we found them, but young Platycercines are not easy to
locate at first as they do not fly far, are very silent except when
hungry, and harmonize perfectly with the green foliage among which
they sit. Their plumage is, from the moment they leave the nest,
wonderfully sleek and perfect, not a feather frayed, ruffled or out of
place, and their soft colours, dainty heads and beaks and dark eyes,
give them a beauty hardly less attractive than the splendour of
the adults. The old birds continued to feed their offspring for
several days; then, evidently considering they were quite old enough
to look after themselves, they became at first indifferent towards
them, and, before long, actively hostile. Unlike Kosellas, Stanleys
and Barnards, Adelaides are, as far as my experience goes, single-
brooded, beginning to moult very soon after the young are able to
fly and never attempting to nest again during the same season.

The Marquis of Tavistock,
The family of six, now deserted by their parents, did not keep
very closely together, and it w r as the exception to see the whole
number at one time ; also they very soon began to disagree among
themselves, especially at mealtimes, and the stronger of the young
cocks would seldom tolerate the presence of his brother until he had
satisfied his hunger and left the feeding tray. During September
and October both old and young birds strayed to considerable dis¬
tances and two of the latter never returned. They showed a great-
partiality for apples and paid frequent visits to neighbouring orchards
without, however, doing serious damage to the fruit, as they are far
less wasteful and destructive than many of the larger parrots, which
throw down and spoil much more than they actually consume.
After the departure of the pair just referred to, my stock of
Adelaides consisted (in November 1912) of the two breeding birds,
an imported cock and two hens acquired during the summer, the
young cock and three young hens. The imported birds, all of which
were fully adult, stayed well during the winter, started to prospect
for nesting sites in February, raised my hopes and then, in true
Pennant fashion, departed for good. Of the three young hens : one
paired with the young cock and another with a cock Pennant. The
third, when about five months old, completely lost the use of one
of her legs ; I thought she had sustained some injury, but when,,
eight weeks later, she lost the use of the other leg also and had to-
be destroyed, it became evident that she had been suffering from a-
mysterious form of paralysis which sometimes attacks my parrakeets,
etc. when at liberty. Fortunately the disease is rare among Platij-
cercines, and a Many-Colour, which recently fell a victim after
enjoying&amp;apos; nearly a year’s freedom in perfect health, is the only other
case which I have met with in this particular family. Madagascar
Love-birds, however, develop the disease so freely that I have had
to give up keeping them. I have sent several for post mortem exami¬
nation, but the reports have always been vague and unsatisfactory.
In March of this year the old pair of Adelaides nested in the
decaying trunk of an oak about 40ft. from the ground, the entrance hole
being perfectly round and only just large enough to allow them to
squeeze through. The hen, as on the previous occasion, disappeared
entirely for nearly seven weeks, being fed on the nest by the cock,

and I am rather doubtful if she ever came off at all, certainly we
never saw her do so. At the end of her long period of seclusion,
she resumed a more normal mode of existence, flying about with her
mate and feeding busily. I was hoping for the appearance of another
brood of six, but in this I was disappointed, for although the young
bird which at length emerged was as strong as I could wish, no
others followed, and it became evident that if more had been hatched,
some misfoitune must have overtaken them while still in the nest.
Another piece of ill-luck followed, for very shortly after the appear¬
ance of his child the cock Adelaide was picked up very thin and
weak and evidently in a bad way. His condition aroused in my
mind grave fears of tuberculosis and septic fever—the two fell diseases
against which I am for ever waging a none too successful warfare;
but as it turned out, I need not have been anxious, for when the bird
died the post mortem revealed inflammation of the lungs as the sole
cause. Poor fellow! it seemed hard luck, that after enduring the fogs
and frost of two winters, unscathed, he should have had his brief
but useful career ig&amp;apos;nominiously terminated in July by an ordinary
cold caught in the moult. If I had only “cooked” him up for a
few days in a room with a temperature of 80—90° {the sovereign
remedy for most sick parrots) I might very likely have saved him !
The fortunes of the young birds in the matter of nesting, fared
no better than those of their parents. The hen which had paired
with the Pennant, lost her mate in the early spring and took up with
a Yellow-bellied Parrakeet (P. flaviventris ). Both she and her sister
evidently nested, as they vanished for many weeks, while their mates
remained. But no young have made their appearance and they are
now long over-due.
To keep up my stock and introduce fresh blood, I have
lately secured three more Adelaides—two cocks and a hen. One of
the former I hope will make a pair with the old breeding bird; the
-other—or the hen, I shall reserve as a mate for this year’s young one
whose sex is at present uncertain. Next year, if all goes well, I may
have eighteen young Adelaides ; if it doesn’t — but we won’t think
about that. How could one bear the present trials and past dis¬
appointments of aviculture if one did not always contemplate a
preternaturally roseate future ?

Motacilla flava.
By W. E. Teschemaker.
My attempts to breed this beautiful species date, as in the
case of the White Wagtail, from the year 1906, when, on a green
sward close to Hickling Broad, I came across a small colony of nests
and thought the sight one of the most charming glimpses of bird-life
which I have ever seen.
Every summer since then I have had a pair of M. flava in
the aviary, but it was not until last year that I obtained a nest from
an old male, which had been more than three years in the aviary,
and a female which had resided with me for fully a couple of years.
Season after season the male had selected a site for a nest and it
had been most interesting to see him executing his singular love-
flight, always in the same manner, hovering or circling slowly over
one particular spot, the body feathers ruffled out, his wings drooped
and his legs trailing. The central idea of ruffling out the feathers
seems to be to make the slim graceful body look as large as possible.
It is a singular fact that this particular male and female had always
been the worst of friends : the former had frequently persecuted the
latter and the latter had on one occasion during the winter turned
the tables and nearly managed to slay the former.
However, they at length composed their differences, and
during the very wet summer of 1912 built a nest in some long grass.
It was close to a Crested Lark’s nest, but, as the female was careful
never to rise from the nest itself, I did not exactly locate it. One
morning, after the female had been sitting for about a week, I saw
the male moping in a corner in the deepest dejection and the female

flying about the aviary. Something had happened to the nest, but
what that something was I do not know to this day ; I suspect slugs
The despair of the male was quite touching ; perhaps some prophetic
instinct warned him that this would be his first and last attempt
to rear a family—at all events he died during last winter, having
reached more than the usual span of life of a captive softbill.
This summer the same female and a very fine male com¬
menced to nest early in July. Once again the characteristic love-
flight was seen in the aviary, but this male hovered over the female,
not over the nest. The nest was on the ground, close up to the
skirting of the aviary. The period of incubation w&amp;apos;as fourteen days
and the five eggs hatched on consecutive days. The female sat most
unsteadily, seldom remaining more than five minutes on the nest,
but, by concealing myself carefully in the aviary, I was able to
ascertain that the male always took her place when he fancied him¬
self unobserved. Without his assistance the eggs would never have
been hatched. The young, with long sprawly legs and some
yellowish down, seemed delicate little things and did not grow
well at first, being almost entirely fed by the female; the male
would brood them but he refused to feed with anything but flies.
The young began to look greyish in the pen-feather stage hut the
buff tips of the flights projecting beyond the quills gave the wings a
mottled appearance.
On the tenth day I extracted one youngster from the nest for
the purpose of a photo and a description. The crown and back were
huffish brown with buff tips to the feathers ; sides of crown dark
brown ; chin pale chrome, ditto eyebrow (well marked) and cheeks ;
under and around cheeks and a streak in centre of upper breast
dark blackish-brown ; wings brown ; lower and middle coverts con¬
spicuously tipped with warm buff; legs, feet and beak light flesh-
colour ; two outer rectrices huffish-white.
The note of the young is similar to that of the adults—a
faint witz-ee ” with the accent on the first syllable; the call-note
of the White Wagtail has the accent on the second syllable and
sounds to me like “ chis-sick.”
The young scattered in the long grass on the eleventh day
and I had great difficulty in finding one to show to a visitor (Dr.

King, of Paignton). In a few days they began to show themselves
in the more open parts of the aviary, and the dark markings on the
sides of the head and the bars on the wing were very conspicuous.
Soon they became very bold, chasing one another on the w T ing&amp;apos; and
catching&amp;apos; flies for themselves. On the 15th August I showed them
to another visitor (Mr. A. Bartlett), and on the 24th I released the
entire family, numbering seven individuals. Once or twice after¬
wards I saw them on the roof of the aviary but they showed not the
least wish to re-enter it. It is with very great amusement that I
now and again hear the suggestion made that birds prefer captivity
to freedom/&amp;quot;
The Yellow Wagtail seems to be rather a delicate species and
intolerant of cold, but I have never had any difficulty in dome&amp;tr

Estrildci cineera.
By W. A. B airbridge.
Only commencing the keeping of foreign birds towards the
latter part of 1912 it stood to reason that I should not know how to
begin. What I did was this : I went to a dealer’s and saw some
birds, when some such conversation as this would take place:—
What are those ? Firefinches : Grey Waxbills.
Are they expensive? No! 3/- a pair.
Are they hardy ? Very. ( ? ).
Will they breed ? Yes.
And so on ; the result was that the birds were bought and the
poor mites brought home and put straight into an aviary. Now we
know better, then we didn’t, and in consequence lost the majority.
Some, however, survived and amongst them the Grey Waxbills.
Why do people call it the Common Waxbill ? Of course it is
common in that it is plentiful, but so are others, and a Grey Waxbill
in good plumage is anything but common to look upon, as with his

tail, an example of perpetual motion, he flits here and there amidst
the foliage searching for some hapless fly—but to progress.
About the same time, in my ignorance, I bought a pair of
St. Helenas so-called, in reality a cock St. Helena and a hen Grey
Waxbill; still there it was, the St. Helena died and the three Grey
Waxbills didn’t, so that in this aviary I commenced the season with
three, all of whom had braved the hardships of a winter out of doors,
merely helped along by having their shed warmed on frosty nights
and on the coldest of days.
Despite, or in consequence of this, they decided to set up
house-keeping&amp;apos; late in February or early in March, when their first
nest was built. For various reasons, this and their two next nests
were deserted and a fourth started on April 1st “ April-fools’ day: ”
said I, ‘ Believe them not,” and I didn’t, but there I was wrong as
events subsequently proved, hence this article.
This last nest was added to and enlarged until it was roughly
six inches high and wdde and about twice as long. I have never yet
been able to discover exactly where the birds got in and out, but it
was somewhere on the far side where I could not see properly ; I
fancy there was an entrance tube, the nest proper being some little
way in. All of these nests were built on the ground in a corner and
easily visible ; three out of the four were built behind bare pea sticks,
the remaining one behind a privet hush, in no case was there grass
within a yard of the nest. It was unfortunately impossible to see
the nest from the outside of the aviary, and the birds must have left
it as I opened the aviary door to enter, as I never saw them leave it
or approach it closely until July 23rd, when for the first time I stw
one of them go to it with what I took to be a crushed up mealworm
in its beak.
I was inside the aviary about this time several times a day
and did not see them feed before this, again at this time they also
became much tamer, and I presume that the young must have
hatched about if not on this day.
The three adults now became exceedingly tame and would
come almost to my feet for mealworms. On August 3rd two young
left the nest and four days later they were dead; I was away from
home and never saw these young ones, but two more left the nest

on August 16tli ancl these lived, and at the time of writing&amp;apos; are still
alive. From Aug. 16th to Aug. 29th the parents fed them on meal¬
worms and seed, principally the latter, while flowering grass and
docks were always available. August 29th saw the young feeding,
on white millet.
When in the nest the parents had access to all the above
foods, in addition ants’ eggs, alive and preserved, and occasionally
spiders were thrown to them.
Two dead young ones were found the other day just by the
nest, and from what was left of them I came to the conclusion that
they too had been Grey Waxbills, in which case the number of eggs
must have been at least six, but whether laid by one hen or two I
cannot say, probably the latter, which would account for the second
two young leaving the nest eleven days after the first two.
Young plumage. On leaving the nest the colours of the young
were as follows :—Breast and abdomen, light grey; wings and back,
light browny grey ; tail, brown with some black feathers (I think
the outer ones) ; beak, black ; throat, light grey, with two darkish
lines (thus A) from the base of beak descending a short distance.
On Sept. 3rd the red eyebrow streak was beginning to show, and
to-day (Sept. 21st) the young are showing signs of being indistin¬
guishable from their parents at no far distant date. The parent
birds have again been seen carrying nesting material.

A cock Bullfinch (a German) owned by a friend living in a
London flat, flew out of his cage about eighteen months ago, and
away into Chelsea Gardens where he probably remained, but unseen,
for about six weeks. He was extremely tame and quite devoted to
his mistress, who had him as a constant companion for three years.
He had lived chiefly outside his cage in her room. Every method
was tried to entice ‘Joseph’ home, but in vain. At last, in sorrow
and despair of his life, she procured another Bullfinch — a freshly-
caught young cock from Shropshire—and he (Anthony) took posses¬
sion of the late lamented one’s cage.

Correspondence .
From the moment this wild young bird was placed out on the
window sill he never ceased to call across the road to the birds in
Chelsea Gardens, until at the end of a week the old Bullfinch
responded and flew into the room, where his mistress discovered
him on her return home one afternoon. But he was out through
the window in a moment and no more seen that day. However, he
re-appeared the next morning, tempted by a train of hemp seed (the
“ forbidden fruit ”); moreover by his intense jealousy of the inter¬
loper, and this time accompanied by a sparrow. While fighting
furiously through the bars of the cage, with poor Anthony inside,
his mistress crept from her hiding place, shut the window and
Joseph was caught: now a shabby-looking little object, much pecked
and draggle tailed, he had clearly been engaged in many a battle—•
one German against many Britishers,—having also lost his own
song he had adopted that of the Dunnock. He was as wild as a
hawk for many weeks, and for a long time nothing could persuade
him to come out of his cage.
But now and for many months he has recovered his looks
and has become tamer and more devoted to his mistress than ever,
and spends most of his time attacking imaginary rivals in the
looking glass.

SIR, — As it was impossible to say all that was advisable in a footnote, I
wish now to make a few additional observations respecting the characters noticed
many years ago, as distinguishing males from females in various Orders of birds,
The flatness of the crown in male birds, though not an absolutely constant
-character, since there are females in which the crown is flatter than in the male,
was first brought to my notice by the late Mr. Abrahams about the year 1885,
when I asked him how to distinguish the sexes of certain finches. In his usual
way, he did not answer me, but caught a pair and held them side by side and asked
me if I could see any difference. Of course, with my training as an Entomo¬
logist and an Insect-artist, I noticed the difference at a glance and this proved
immensely useful to me later on when comparing the sexes of various birds.
I have no doubt that Mr. Abrahams was well aware of the fact that the
Psittaci, in common with many other groups, more often than not differ sexually

in the same way ; he may even have directed my attention to the shape of the
head when with me at some of the Crystal Palace Bird-Shows.
In my footnote I remarked that I believed I had published this character
for distinguishing the sexes of the Psittaci previous to the publication of “ How
to sex Cage-Birds”: I see that in my ‘‘Hints on Cage-Birds” p. 32, when
indicating sexual characters to be looked for in Parrots, I say: ‘‘note whether
the crown is short and arched, or long and flattish.” This little book was
published in 1903 and had previously appeared in serial form in ‘ ‘ The Feathered
World,” the above observation appearing in the part for May, 30th, 1902, and it
is certain that I was aware of the character many years before.
Characters which occur in birds, based upon the form of the skull and
beak, depend largely upon the habits of their possessors : where the female has
to do the thinking and the building, as well as taking her share in defending her
nest and young, she sometimes assumes what are in a general way male charac¬
ters ; indeed she is sometimes more masculine in form of head than her husband,
as I have noted in the case of the Quaker Parrakeet.
By the way, with regard to the green spot in female Rosellas, which, when
present, seems to be always round and of about the size of a pea, I never stated
on my own authority that it was absolutely constant; but where a green spot is
present in male birds it appears to be invariably irregular, never rounded.

SIR,—In a footnote on page 43 of last issue, Dr. Butler refers to a state¬
ment of mine in “ Aviaries and Aviary Life.” Though the matter is but small,
perhaps, I may be permitted to state, that I acknowledged in the preface of
‘‘A. and A. L.” all works which I consulted in its compilation, and that the
statement referred to was from experience gathered from my own and many
friends’ birds under the conditions of avia^ life.
Tq Dr. Butler belongs the honour of gathering together systematically
what was known, as to differences in contour, between the sexes of similarly
plumaged species, aud adding thereto, from an exhaustive examination of the
■skins at the British Museum, etc.
At the same time it must be obvious that many of these distinctions could
not be original; for instance, the one in question as to contour of head, etc.
(this appeared in Bird Life in 1906, I think), was known to myself and many
other aviculturists long before that date, and, not only as regards Psittaci, but
other Orders too.
In “ A. and A. L.” owing to lack of space, I had to make reference to
such matters by a general statement, covering groups and not individual species.
Of course, I read Dr. Butler’s serial ‘‘How to Sex Cage Birds,” in Bird Life,
but did not get it when published in book form : had I quoted therefrom I
should most certainly have made due acknowledgment.
Before laying aside my pen, permit me to remark, re the ‘‘ green spot on

the nape ” of some hen Rosella Parrakeets, that I have seen this on many
individuals, all of which ultimately proved to be hens ; on the other hand, while
I have never come across a cock with the green spot on the nape, I have also
seen many &amp;apos;proved hens which did not possess it, hence I always refer to it as not
constant.
With all that Dr. Butler has done, by collation and research, which none
recognise more than the writer, much yet remains to be done, and, the data yet
to be gathered, to be of real value, must come from living birds and from many
individual pairs of the same species; thus it is obvious that it must be the work
of many (all) aviculturists, the result to be ultimately collated in concrete form
by some enthusiastic and industrious author of the future.
In conclusion may I be permitted to urge all aviculturists (the topic covers
all orders of birds) to have a part therein, and to carefully observe and record
any distinctions in contour of any true pairs which pass through their hands,
whose plumages are similar. It would be of great interest, if observations were
taken as to what extent these contour distinctions are common with such species
in which the plumage of the sexes is dissimilar (Psittaci especially).

NOTES.
HUMMING BIRDS. Herr August Fockelmann received in the beginning
of November three Humming Birds, which only lived, alas ! a few days, and he
sent me the bodies to inspect.
Sporadinus ricordi —the size of a small Sunbird — deep emerald green,
with forked tail, and a little patch of white on the under tail-coverts.
Calypte helence — literally scarcely larger than a Humming-bird Hawk
Moth. Dark emerald green with white throat and underparts. Its tiny feet would
find the stalk of a millet-spray almost too large.&amp;apos; Bill half an inch. Tail half an
inch. Head and body three quarters of an inch. One could hardly believe it
to be a bird, and how this minute creature lasted out through severe ocean
storms from Mexico (?) to Germany, puzzles one.
Herr Fockelmann still has hopes, when storms do not rage and when the
sun shines more warmly, of successfully importing some of these wonderful
little birds. H. D. A.
A LATE SWALLOW.
Mr. 0. MlLLSUM watched a Swallow, near Broadstairs, flying about
on the 23rd of November.
A RARE CONURE.
Mr. WALTER ROTHSCHILD and Mr. ASTLEY have acquired some very
rare Conures from an uninhabited island (Mona Islands), which are said to be-
C. gundlaclii (?) They are in immature plumage, all green with a few scarlet
feathers showing here and there on head, breast and back; under the wings the-
colour is bright scarlet. They were sold by Mr. A. E. Jamrach.

The great majority of these birds live in a large aviary—
roughly 14 feet long and about 10 feet high—all wire, and resting on a
zinc floor beneath wdiich there are two thicknesses of linoleum, then
the parquet, this being an indoor arrangement, to which a whole
fair-sized room has been devoted. Another part of the same room
is filled by a similar though slightly smaller aviary, which is occupied
by my collection of rare Waxbills and finches; then I have a few

odd cages, placed upon collapsible shelves and over the fire-place,
containing either recent arrivals or birds that need special care.
The room is lit on dark days by three powerful electric lamps, as is
also a small adjoining room, opening into a bigger one, and where
most of the cleaning takes place, containing all hird-utensils, foods,
medicines, etc. Each of the two aviaries runs to and encloses a
French window, which being protected by wire inside as well as
outside, can be thrown wide open, during the fine season, for the
inhabitants to enjoy the air and sunshine. There are three ventila¬
tion holes, which can be open and closed at will, one on each window
and one on the ceiling. For perching accommodation I use dead
fruit trees only and branches of trees, the latter being changed at
regular intervals. The floor of the Sunbirds’ house is covered with
sawdust, which is raked up daily and at intervals thrown away and
replaced as necessity commands, for I may say here that if there is
anything I believe in, where the keeping of birds is concerned,
it is the strictest and most unceasing attention to hygiene and
cleanliness. As the whole of the room where my birds are housed
is whitewashed, dirt is easily rubbed or sponged off, and I boast
of the fact that no “ bird-smell ” prevails anywhere.
All my Sunbirds get the usual mixture of Mellin’s food,
Nestle’s milk and honey, as well as a little insectivorous food for
the few Sugar Birds who share their home ; then a variety of salads
and ripe fruit—grapes, orange, pear, apple, banana, figs, etc. twice a
week I receive fresh from the country, in addition to some big roots
of grass for my finches, Traveller’s Joy or other creeper, and this,
besides furnishing all inmates with food and amusement, forms when
being sprayed, their favourite bathing-place. They love to alight on
the wet foliage, some even seeking the spray, shaking their iridescent
plumage, throwing out their golden shoulders, rubbing and brushing
their feathers against the dripping leaves, then carefully combing
them with their slender beaks. To this, and to the more thorough
bath which they generally indulge in afterwards, in the trough pro¬
vided for the purpose, also of course to the large space given them
and which ensures them exercise, I attribute their faultless and
brilliant plumage, their happy appearance, and their almost incessant
singing. Quarrels, unfortunately, there are, as most of these species

are so spiteful by nature, but so far, there have been no serious rows
beyond occasional bad words, owing no doubt to their being able to
get away from each other, and also to the great number of feeders pro¬
vided round the different sides of their enclosure. It is a pretty
sight of a morning and after the daily cleaning&amp;apos; process has taken
place, to see them all crowding round the entrance door, waiting&amp;apos; the
appearance of the food tray, then perching all over it the moment it
is carried into the aviary, each bird eager to be first served or to find
his favourite feeder.
As my bird-room opens on one side into a large and well-
heated hall there is little need for any artificial heating, as the door
is constantly left open when the windows are kept closed, and the
air admitted is quite warm enough, but as an extra ordinary pre¬
caution against frost there is also an electric radiator; which how¬
ever is but seldom used.
I am often asked which species of these lovely birds I like
most. Indeed it is hard to say, though for combined grace of shape
and attitude, charming plumage and brilliant song, perhaps the
Malachite is my favourite&amp;quot;—one of them especially, who from the
first was always tame, and allows me to touch him without even
trying to get away. Then the African Amethyst,—a bird sombre
yet radiant like a tropical night,—deep violet all over with a copper-
coloured spot on the rump, blue shoulder, an emerald green cap and
a gorget that flashes like a flame in the light. To the Lesser and
Greater Double-collared I have one objection only, that is the fact
that after the first moult the crimson of the breast fades away into
orange, though all the tints of the body remain as brilliant as ever.
It is of course possible yet, as this species has only been some six
months in my possession, that the original crimson may reappear,
but I fear it will not, and the same may apply to the Red Sunbird,
who, at time of writing, is in the moult. But of my present col¬
lection, the gem is that rarest of rare birds, the Scarlet-chested or
Southern Bifasciated Sunbird (Cinnyris mariquensis). This species
inhabits the wilds of the lower parts of the Transvaal, and in order
to procure it for me, as well as another charming one, the White-

breasted Sunbird (Cinnyris leucogaster or Talatala ) it was necessary
for the birds, after capture, to be conveyed across the Transvaal
Yeldt for six wearisome weeks in a rough waggon ; then followed a
five days’ journey in the train to the coast, and, lastly, the three
weeks sea journey home. Yet some even of those reached these
shores in almost faultless condition, and to my mind this speaks
well, not only for the well-known “pluck” and determination to
live, which forms an interesting feature of these apparently frail
birds, but also proves the care and diligent attention bestowed upon
them by those to whom I owe so many of my finest and rarest
specimens. Cinnyris mariquensis , like most of the genus, rejoices in a
rather short tail, but his garment on the back, head and upper throat
is of cloth of gold—old gold, shining with almost every metallic hue
as the light strikes him ; his mantle is deep black, his rump blue; a
band of sapphire encircles his gorget, and below there is another
band of scarlet — truly a bird of the sun. He has a pretty song, too,
though not so sweet as the Malachite, and this is heard at its best
when he challenges another male, for this species is particularly
pugnacious, and it is almost impossible to cage two together in a
small enclosure.
A pretty sight is to watch all these birds when it has been
possible to obtain for them some branches of Honeysuckle, Big&amp;apos;nonia,
Lethoea, or other flowers containing nectar. Some of them will
perch on the blooms, twisting backwards and forwards into every
conceivable position and attitude. Others, the Malachite for in¬
stance, enjoy hovering over the blooms, after true humming birds’
fashion, all plunging their long beaks into the very heart of the
flowers in order to extract the honey by means of their flexible
tongue. But they can also take solid food in the way of small
insects—spiders, flies, green fly, etc., when in season — though in a
few cases the mixture seems to be much more relished. Nearly all
will also eat fruit, large pieces of the moistened sponge cake, like
the Sugar-birds. As this is rather fattening, and one must beware
of fits with all these genera, I find it necessary to dose all at times
with a pinch of sulphate of soda dissolved in the syrup.
To conclude these few notes, I will say that besides the great
beauty of most representatives of the Sunbirds’ family, besides their

many curious and interesting traits, one of the features concerning
them, that from my point of view is a great attraction, is the diffi¬
culty of obtaining them. In most colonies, including Africa, these
birds now-a-days are rigidly protected: for that reason and for the
real rarity of certain species, it seems to me unlikely that they
will ever become really common. At any rate those species which
inhabit wild and almost inaccessible tracts of land (and there are
many such) can hardly come into the greedy hands of the bird-
dealer. For their sakes, let us rejoice that this is so.

SOME NOTES ON
THE WHITE-LEGGED FALCONET.

Microhierax melanoleucus.
By E. C. Stuart Baker, E.Z.S., etc.
As pets the members of the Falconidce are not often kept,
except for the purpose of hawking, yet amongst the birds I have
personally made the acquaintance of in captivity, some of the most
interesting have been Eagles and Hawks.
Perhaps the most uncommon capture—I cannot say he was a
pet—I have had, was a tiny Pigmy Falcon or Falconet ( Microhierax
melanoleucus ) and the way in which it came into my possession was
in itself a very striking instance of the bird’s character. At the
time this happened I was stationed in the North Cachar Hills, a
district of Assam, and one day during the rainy season, whilst out
in camp, my dalavallah, or postal runner, handed me with my letters
a bundle in a cloth which he said was a small bird he had caught on
the road. He also advised me to be careful how I opened the cloth
as it was “ a very furious bird” and had bitten him severely before
he tied it up in his puggree. With great caution, therefore, I opened
the bundle and discovered inside this wonderful little black and white
falcon, and with him the body of a Scimitar Babbler ( Pomatorhinus
phayrei ) in the breast feathers of which his feet were still entangled.
The runner’s story was to the effect that he had come on the falcon
seated on the babbler, which he was busy eating, in the middle of
the forest path, and that the killer being smaller than his victim he

Mr. E. C. Stuart Baker,
was unable to carry it away, and his feet being entangled in the wet
breast feathers he could not leave it behind and so became an easy
capture.
As soon as we had freed the Falconet’s feet from his dinner
we placed him in a small wicker-work cage with a perch across it,
upon which he clambered and there sat glowering at us. Even
under these depressing circumstances he looked, every one of his six
inches, a regal little bird, and in attitude more like a Golden Eagle
than a true falcon. His head was held low and sticking out,
his shoulders humped, wings slightly spread, and his black eyes
shining wickedly at us from under his prominent eye-brows. For
two days he sulked and would eat nothing, but as he had, just
previous to being caught, eaten a fine meal off the breast of the
Babbler, this did not hurt him.
The third day I arrived home, and was then able to place him
in an aviary, though, as there were none empty, he had to share
one with some Red-footed Kestrels (Erythropus amurensis ) and a
pair of big Woodpeckers (Chrysocolaptes guttacristatus ). The small
Kestrels were about twice the size of the Falconet, the Wood¬
peckers certainly three times his weight and size : moreover, as
the latter had been more than able to hold their own against the
Kestrels, I had no fear for them in regard to the Falconet, though I
was rather nervous for his sake.
My nervousness however was quite unnecessary, for on being
let out of his wicker cage he stretched his wings by flying a couple
of times round the aviary and then sat on a perch which was vacant
and took a look round his new domain. The Kestrels, who were
scattered about on different perches, at once attracted his attention,
and he proceeded to hunch himself up in imitation of an angry eagle,
opening his mouth and gently hissing at the same time, an intima¬
tion to all hearers not to interfere with his lordship. Having
satisfied himself that he had inspired mortal terror into the hearts
of all the other occupants of the cage he then proceeded to start
bullying them, a proceeding to which the meek little Kestrels sub¬
mitted without protest, collecting in a bunch on the perch furthest
from that taken possession of by the little tyrant. For the time
being, this seemed to satisfy him and he dropped his noble attitude,

fluffed himself out, preened his feathers and cleaned his feet, after
which he considered his toilet finished and composed himself to rest.
The following morning, on visiting the cage, I found that he
had made an attack on one of the Woodpeckers, for there were many
of its feathers lying in tufts on the ground, but with them were some
white ones, evidently from the breast of the Falconet himself, so I
concluded he had been worsted and would leave them alone in
future. Not a bit of it, however, he was only biding his time and
meant retaliation as soon as possible. That day I saw nothing more
in the way of bullying. The Kestrels he seemed to realize were a
kind of “ poor relation,” and as long as they cringed to him and
were utterly subservient in every way, not daring to sit on his
particular perch, he left them alone. He also condescended to eat
one or two fat locusts and drank a great deal of water, but most of
his time he spent seated on the highest available perch at one end
of the aviary, where he surveyed his domain and his subjects.
The next day I gave him a couple of live Sparrows, and one
of these he killed and ate whilst I was away in office, so what I saw
done on my return therefrom was not an act impelled by hunger.
For the convenience of my pair of Woodpeckers I had placed
in this aviary some long logs of wood, one of which passed directly
under the throne of the Falconet. This log had been carefully avoided
during the morning by the two birds, but familiarity, I suppose, had
begun to breed contempt, for as I was passing the cage in the after¬
noon I saw one of the Woodpeckers run up the log and under the
throne. In a second, the Falconet had swooped and knocked his
bulky opponent off on to the ground, but that was the extent of his
victory on this occasion, for, on falling to the ground the Wood¬
pecker, as is the custom of these birds in such emergencies, turned
on its back and presented such formidable beak and claws to the
falcon’s attack that the latter retired, pretending to be satisfied with
the damage inflicted.
For some days all went on well, and the Falconet was content
with killing such small birds as I gave him for the purpose, varying
his diet with insect food of all kinds, but refusing entirely to eat the
carcase of any dead bird placed in the cage. He even became
reconciled to me sufficiently to eat when I was within a few feet of

Mr. E. C. Stuart Baker,
him, but he still infinitely preferred Hying savagely at a finger placed
through the wires rather than take food from it.
There was about a fortnight of this calm and then a tragedy
occurred, for on visiting the aviary one morning I found that Mr.
Woodpecker was a widower and his poor lady lay on the floor of the
cage not only dead but half eaten. There was a solemn hush in the
aviary, the widower crouched on a log in the furthermost corner, the
Kestrels huddled together on a perch, awestruck and mute, whilst
the murderer sat on a perch by himself and picked from his claws
the remains of Mrs. Woodpecker which still adhered to them.
An examination of the victim’s body showed that the little
falcon had struck just like the larger birds, such as the Peregrines
strike, ripping open the centre of the Woodpecker’s back, and it must
be assumed, stunning her so that he was enabled to finish his bloody
deed on the ground.
After this I removed the other Woodpecker to a safer abode,
leaving the aviary to the sole occupation of the birds of prey, but I
really think the Kestrels would also have liked a “remove.” They
wore a scared expression, and the subsequent death of one or
two of them may have been due to nerves, for I could find no other
cause. I never saw the falcon attack them, but if he was irritated
or annoyed by their flying or perching too close to him he would
hunch himself up and hiss at them in such a vicious manner that
they always at once collapsed into stillness until his majesty was
once more good tempered.
This little Falconet remained with me for two years, and was
finally released when I went home on leave, as there was no one I
could trust to look after him in my absence. It is impossible to say
that he ever became tame, in the sense that one uses the word of
most cage birds. He had no fear of me, but neither had he any
fear of anything else, and the utmost I can pretend to having gained
from him was a dignified tolerance of my presence and an accept¬
ance of my services w 7 hen he needed them. He would take any
special dainty from my fingers, or if the dainty was not special
enough, would take a bit of the finger instead when he had the
chance.
He was very crepuscular in his habits, like the wild birds of

his kind, and for most of the day would sit quite quiet and apparently
asleep, but up to about ten in the morning and after three or four in
the afternoon was very lively and active, much to the distress and
^convenience of the Kestrels, who had always to be on the alert
and clear off any perch he desired for the moment to rest on.
He would never kill the small birds given him for food if he
knew that I was looking&amp;apos; on, but the one or two I caught him killing
unawares were all killed in the same way as that in which I first
saw him try to encompass the Woodpecker’s death. He waited
paitently until his prey was just under him and then hurled himself
upon it with incredible speed and accuracy, the result in every
case being death to the bird attacked. The corpses of those I have
found killed seemed to have all met their death in the same way.
In a state of nature the Falconets undoubtedly live far more
on insects than on birds or small mammals, and I have several times
watched them hawking termites in the evening&amp;apos; when these were
flighting. Whilst engaged in this pursuit their actions were typically
those of the larger birds of prey, the foot always being used for the
capture, and for conveyance of the captured white ant to the mouth.
They seldom seemed to miss any termite they struck at, being far
more accurate in this respect than the Rollers, King-crows, and other
birds which joined in the fray.
A flight of “ white-ants ” is a wonderful sight, and in some
cases many hundreds of thousands of ants must be on the wing at a
time, so there is for the time being food and to spare for all who
care. Accordingly Falconets and other birds are all fully employed,
and there is no reason for the former to resent the latter sharing in
the banquet and I never saw any attempt at molestation.
They seem often to have very favourite perches which they
visit evening after evening at about the same hour. One such perch
was a dead branch on the top of an immense tree standing on a
plateau and surrounded by tea, which was regularly visited by a pair
of these birds, who hawked insects during the summer months, from
about four o’clock until it was almost dark. Under this tree were a
good many of the pellets which these little birds disgorge, and these
pellets proved that they were very largely insect eaters, though we
also found bones of mice, bats and small birds, whilst scattered about

were feathers which proved that Barbets, Cinnamon Sparrows, a
Pipit of some kind and various other birds larger than themselves
had been sacrificed to their appetite.
Sometimes they soar round in the air much in the way
of Swallow-Shrikes, fluttering to one side or the other, as some
insect attracts their attention, but keeping much to one spot generally
round and round some big tree. My attention to this habit was first
drawn by Dr. H. N. Colltart, to whose garden at Margherita, in
Assam, a pair of these Falconets were regular visitors, evidently
nesting somewhere in the close vicinity, though we never succeeded
in finding where.
Very little is known of the breeding of this and the allied
Falconets, but it is probable that they always lay their eggs in holes
in trees, deserted nest holes of Woodpeckers, Barbets, etc. I once
found an egg of this species in N. Cachar and two others in the Khasia
Hills, and in each case these eggs were taken from deserted Barbet’s
nest holes, which were more or less filled with a mass of wings, legs,
and other remains of insects. In addition to these there were a few
feathers, conspicuous amongst them the scarlet and black feathers
from a Minivet in one nest, and in another those of a Franklin’s
Barbet.
The eggs are very unhawk-like in character and colour. In
shape they are rather stout little ovals, practically the same size at
either end, and the texture is like that of polished chalk, not so soft
and chalky as that of the Crow Pheasants ( Taccocua or Gentropus),
but more so than that of the Barbets, Parrots, etc.
Two eggs now in my collection measure respectively 29‘1 x
23&amp;apos;3 mm. and 27&amp;apos;7 x 22&amp;apos;7 mm.
The only other egg I have seen of these little Falconets is one
of Microhierax eutolmus, sent to me from the Malay States. This
is exactly like those already described and measures 29&amp;apos;2 x 24’5.
This last egg was taken on the 4th February from a deserted Wood¬
pecker’s nest-hole high up in a big tree. My two eggs of the White¬
legged Falconet were taken on the 12th March, 1889, and the 4th
of July, 1908, respectively.

The Crucial Stage of the Manitoba Wild Duck Expedition
—Hatching, Rearing and Transporting the Ducklings.
{Concluded).
Out in the wilds our resources were scant. Some of them
survived the long journey. An expert from the New York Zoological
Park came out to advise on the problem. Minnows were offered
them, and they were given a varied fish, meat, and insect diet, all in
vain. At the Zoological Park, we were told, they had never been
able to keep Scoters alive. Here is a problem for further study.
The Ruddy Duck is another problem. This duck, though
little larger than a Teal, lays eggs bigger than those of such large
species as the Mallard and Canvasback. The young are most
curious creatures. Similar in colour to the young Scoters, they are
differently marked, and, rather strangely, have larger bills, of broad
spoon-shape. They have a coarse, hair-like plumage, and are fat
and squatty, about as broad as they are long. Their legs are set
uncommonly far “ aft,” even for a diving duck, and the body is so
heavy that they can hardly stand more than for a moment. The
feet are enormously broad. Waddling a few steps, down they fall
and lie there, blinking helplessly, with a sort of foolish air. Seldom
would they take even a mouthful of food or drink. The way they
flop over the ground reminds one of turtles.
I tried various plans to induce them to eat. About the only
way was to put food in water, but they made bad work with it, and
soon would become thoroughly soaked. The first attempt killed one
with cramp, and I had to desist. If I forced food down their
throats they hawked it up. They steadily refused food, and died in
less than a week. Opening one that was four days old, I was
surprised to find a large unabsorbed yolk in the abdominal cavity.
It is entirely different from any other duck, if, indeed, it deserves to
be classed with the ducks. It presents a singular problem—which,
by the way, our guide did not consider worth solving.

Mr. Herbert K. Job,
What in the world does he want to raise ruddies for?”
said he to the assistant. “ They’re no good, even if he raised them.
Why, if you go and pluck one, you pull off the meat with the
feathers.”
Though I hope to pursue the problem further, as an interest¬
ing matter of science, it is probable that various marine species, such
as Scoters, Mergansers, Eiders, the Old Squaw, and the Buddy
Duck, will prove unadaptable to domestication, and would be of no
practical or commercial value.*
The other ten species, however, that we investigated, are
readily raised. These are,—to repeat from the other article ( The
Outing Magazine, November),—Pintail, Shoveller, Mallard, Gadwell,
Baldpate, Blue-winged and Green-winged Teals, Bedhead, Canvas-
back, Lesser Scaup. The young Canvasbacks and Bedheads, con¬
trary to what might be expected, are docile creatures and do
splendidly. The only duckling that showed any trace of natural
wildness was the Scaup — the blue-bill or broad-bill of our Atlantic
coast gunners. Not that they are afraid, but they are nervous and
restless, always running around and jumping, trying to get out.
They seem rather harder to raise than the others, and w T e lost more
in proportion. Nevertheless, we have a nice little bunch of them
grown to maturity.
In addition to the above species which are evidently capable
of domestication, the Dusky or Black Duck and the Wood Duck are
known to come in this category. The chances are also, I believe, in
favour of the American and Barrows’ Golden-eyes and the little
Bufflehead. The Greater Scaup would doubtless be like the Lesser.
Then there is the Cinnamon Teal, found farther west. So here are
at least seventeen splendid native American Wild Ducks, all probably
capable of artificial increase, as some are already known to be.
These are problems well worthy the attention of lovers of
Wildfowl.
I had imagined that most of the wild ducklings would be
practically indistinguishable. As a matter of fact, however, many
of them are absolutely unlike, and all can readily be told apart, even
Perhaps Mr. St. Quintin will write something on this subject ?—ED.

though some are very much alike. Canvasbacks and Redheads
ai-e the “ yellow-birds ” among the duck tribe, but have distinctly
different bills. The Pintailis a blackish and white striped bird. Gad-
wall and Baldpate are identical, save that the former has light
brownish feet, the latter dark slaty. The Blue-winged and Green -
winged Teals are similar, save for a trifling difference in marking on
the head, and the Green-wing has a smaller, shorter bill. The
Scaup is a very dark bird, mostly blackish brown, with a slight
crest. The Shoveller is always distinguishable by its enormous bill.
And so on.
Owing to our late arrival, we found it desirable to try to
complete our stock by catching some ducklings already hatched in
the wild state. If anyone imagines this an easy task, a few
attempts will disabuse him of the notion. I shall never forget my
own futile attempts to chase broods of Canvasbacks and Redheads.
When I first saw them out on open waters of the larger bays, I
thought surely I could catch some, as they were quite young. But,
as I paddled up fairly near, they began to skitter rapidly over the
surface, and then they plunged. Not a sign of them could I see
again, for the surface was ruffled, and they only raised their bills to
breathe, swimming long distances under water to the edge of the
rushes, where they were absolutely safe.
Finally, we were lucky enough t&amp;apos;o enlist some French-Indian
half-breeds, who are wonderful paddlers and hunters. Whenever
we saw their rig&amp;apos;, in the evening, driving towards our camp, I always
felt a thrill of excitement, knowing that something of great
interest was near. Besides some small ducklings, they caught some
magnificent specimens, fledged all but the flight feathers, of Canvas-
back, Pintail, Shoveller, and Mallard.
It w T as exciting to hear them tellhow they caught the Canvas¬
backs. Two or three canoes would single one out from the rest and
chase it. For nearly an hour it would dive and skulk. It took
keen eyes to see where it stuck up its bill and expert paddling to
keep up with it. They simply tired it out, and at last the poor
duck, unable to dive any longer, came to the surface and meekly
allowed the nearest boat to pick it up.
We had little trouble in taming and rearing most of these

Mr. Herbert K. Job,
captives. The Canvasbacks at first would lie down flat on the
ground and skulk, but they soon got over this. In a few hours all of
them would be shyly eating and drinking, and within a week they
would eat out of my hand. The only serious trouble or loss was due
to fighting, on account of a lack of coops, in which to segregate new
arrivals. The larger ducks are terribly savage to others put in with
them as strangers, chasing and hammering them, and we lost some
nice birds thus. Those that could stand it for a day or two were
then accepted on equal terms. We found that the prairie is no
lumber-yard, when it comes to building operations. The proper way
is to build a number of coops in advance, keep new arrivals separate
till they get to eating well, and then mix the groups so that, more
or less, all feel strange.
Though heat is not needed after the ducklings are over a
month or so old, it is necessary to provide good shelter for cold
windy nights and the heavy rains of the region. After learning a
lesson by losing a fine Canvasback, we brought into the kitchen each
night all the ducks not fully fledged, not having material for coops,
and not daring to take any more chances. We also found that a
moderate percentage of wild ducklings captured at a very tender age
were liable to die from shock, exhaustion, or abstinence. Most of
them, though, would take right hold with the tame incubator
birds. With these latter, it was encouraging to find that practically
about the only losses were due to overcrowded conditions. In the
large brooder hardly a bird died, save in the youngest brood of
Gadwalls. The others seemed to get the start of them and were
always stepping on them and pushing them aw T ay from the food.
They became more and more bedraggled and stunted, and in the end
we lost them all.
In the other brooder, with the smallest ducklings, the hover
was crowded at night. It was too bad to have to make fat Scoters
and tiny Teals sleep together, for some of the little ones were
trampled or smothered. There was very little loss from any other
cause. If I were doing the thing again, I should know exactly what
equipment and facilities to provide and should expect the losses to be
almost nil, certainly no more than on a well-regulated tame-duck
farm.

The days passed rapidly, crowded with incident and adven¬
ture which there is not space enough here to recount. It was the
last night in camp. At midnight, having completed the necessary
tasks, I went outside before retiring, and sat on the brooder in the
moonlight, enjoying the wonderful scene and listening to the weird
voice sounds of birds from the great mysterious marsh. How I
should miss the canoe and the charm of the strange labyrinth where
bred the noble Canvasback !
Soon dawned the eventful day when 102 ducklings were to
start on their long journey. In the incubator were a few eggs still
unhatched. Three of them were the remnant of a set of Green¬
winged Teal stepped on by cattle ; the rest were of the late-laying
Scoter. I had calculated that these would not hatch till the end of
the journey. Alas, some were pipped that last night, and on the
morning of leaving a Teal and a Scoter were out, all the rest being
in process of hatching.
It was a real tragedy, but it was too late to alter our plans.
So, reluctantly, I put the unlucky brood in a pail, with warm sand
beneath, wrapped in a blanket. I misjudged the temperature. Every
egg had a live duckling in it, but by the time we got aboard the
train all had been overheated or smothered, save the two already
hatched, which, strange to relate, made the trip safely to
Connecticut.
We could not, therefore, determine the point about tran¬
sporting incubated eggs. I did, however, settle the question of the
safety of carrying a fresh Wild Ducks’ eggs in the cars on a very
long journey under the best conditions, with personal care. I had
saved for this test a set of eggs laid close by our camp, taking each
new egg as it was laid, to make sure of its being fresh, substituting
each time an egg from another set of the same kind in the incubator.
I packed them with great care, in springy paper, took care of them
on the journey, and turned them each day. Despite all this, notone
of them started an embryo. It is clear that the only sure way is to
hatch out the eggs before starting.
I might devote the entire particle to the experiences of that
memorable 2,000 mile journey. Two large double wagon loads
trailed southward over the prairie, that twenty-ninth of July, merci-

fully one of the few pleasant days. The ducklings were carried in
two crates and two brooders, assorted according&amp;apos; to size. Officials at
every divisional point, through the courtesy of the Dominion Express
Company, had received orders to give every facility, and I remember
everyone of them with gratitude. The bumping and jerking of the
cars kept throwing the poor ducklings off their feet, but they were so
tame they endured it philosophically, and devoted themselves to
eating and drinking. The worst trouble was in keeping them dry, as
the water slopped around, and they spilled it in drinking. I carried
a bag of hay, from which I frequently changed the litter for them.
At one point, Fort William, Ontario, I suddenly found that
they w T ere going to divide the train into two sections. I hustled my
suitcase from the Pullman to the express car and saw no more of
my berth or my son for the next tw T enty-four hours. I tremble to
think of what would have happened to the ducklings had I been left
behind ! That night I slept on top of two boxes in the express
car. It was hardly as comfortable as the lower berth, but more
desirable for the purpose in hand. The nights were cool, and I had
to keep a little heat in the brooders most of the way.
All things come to an end, and on the afternoon of the fifth
day of the trip, over four whole days from the start, I landed the
ducklings on the preserve—102 of them, representing eleven species
of Wild Ducks. Also there was a Coot or Mud-hen that harmonized
beautifully with the Ducks and makes a singular appearance among
them, with its long legs and slender lobed toes. We had lost
eighteen birds on the journey, and during the next few days some of
the smallest ones dropped off from the effects of the journey. Ever
since then, as at present, the rest have been in fine shape.
It was most encouraging and instructive to find that of the
losses due to the journey, every one, with one solitary exception, were
of birds not over twelve days old at the start, and down to three
days. Every duck three weeks old or over at the start, except this
one, a Red-head, which may have been about three weeks old and
perhaps was hurt, stood the ordeal safely. It simply means that
young Wild Ducks over three weeks old can stand a long journey if
they are properly fed and handled. A good rule would be to have
them one month old to make sure.

It is a rare delight now to have this unique and beautiful
stock within easy access, to study their early plumages and changes, as
yet not all described in books, to note their interesting ways, and
to work out details of handling, feeding, and breeding, under the
auspices of a Government Experiment Station, where scientific work
is understood and appreciated. If only experiments could thus have
been made with the lamented Passenger Pigeon, we should doubtless
have had them alive to-day. We may well hope that from such
beginnings these splendid wildfowl species may be so widely multi¬
plied that extermination will be impossible, and, better still, that
through public interest engendered in their welfare, they may again
become familiar sights upon the w 7 aters of our entire country.

HAND-REARING BRITISH BIRDS.
By Dr. Arthur G. Butler.
Although many of my experiences in rearing our British
Birds have been published elsewhere, I have never drawn con¬
clusions from my own successes and failures, which might be of
value to others who may be contemplating a similar course.
First of all then I would point out, for the benefit of those
who desire to rear birds for show purposes, that hand-reared birds
will always remain delightfully tame and steady while associated
only with human beings, even though allowed to fly freely in a
room—and in some cases in the open-air : but many of them, if once
associated with other birds in an aviary, become ten times more
nervous than wild caught birds : it almost seems as if the older
inhabitants of the aviary had gone to work to set the new-comers
against their owners and foster-parents. In the case of the Titmice
however we have a notable exception to this rule, for they continue
to be as confiding as ever.
In the second place, if birds are required for song, proper
tutors must be provided, excepting in the case of certain types such

Dr. A. G. Butler,
as the Larks and Wagtails, in which the wild song seems to be
instinctive.
By constantly hearing music superior to its own, we know
that the poor little melody of the Bullfinch (when brought up from
the nest) can be replaced by recognizable tunes and the chirping and
chattering of the House-Sparrow can be replaced by a softer
reproduction of the notes of a Norwich Canary. Untaught Black¬
balls and Thrushes utter a few loud notes which are neither
pleasing nor in the least melodious ; but if given half a chance they
are liable, while still young, to pick up anything in the shape of a
song : thus I once had a hand-reared Song-Thrush which had
learned to sing from a Canary and made such a terrific noise that an
inn-keeper who had heard of it came to inspect it, and willingly
paid rather a high price to become the possessor of it. It proved a
disappointment however, for it ceased to sing when hung up in a
public bar.
Like most beginners I started my experiments with those
birds most easy to obtain and also most easily reared—the Song-
Thrush, Blackbird and Starling : at first I fed these with a mixture
of what is popularly called fig-dust (oat-flour) and pea-meal, given
very wet until the birds were old enough to drink, and afterwards
made up into the consistency of dough and rolled up into small
sausage-shaped pellets. Later, I discovered that greater success
attended my efforts when I gave scalded Spratt’s poultry-meal
mixed with pea-meal ; but these coarse feeders rarely fail one;
indeed I have heard of Blackbirds which had been successfully
brought up upon sopped bread alone, though I should doubt their
having strong constitutions after such poor fare. Nowadays, even
for these birds I should provide far more expensive and nutritious
diet, for I believe in nourishing food for children of all kinds.
I got no opportunity to hand-rear Missel Thrushes until
1886, when I found a nest containing a young pair : these I reared
easily on the pea-meal and flg-dust mixture with scalded snails cut
up and small worms ; they were strong and handsome birds of
which I gave away the hen but kept the cock for show purposes, but
the first show I sent it to (when it was nearly four years old) it was
fed upon minced raw beef mixed with breadcrumbs (instead of the

food which I forwarded with it) and consequently had one fit after
another, dying about an hour after I got it home again/&amp;quot;
As evidence of the evil effects of raw beef upon the Tnrdidce
when given regularly I may note that about the year 1886 a lad
brought me a nest of young Robins (supposing them to be
Nightingales) and, in my ignorance, I tried to rear them upon
shredded raw beef and sopped bread mixed up together, which
speedily killed them all. Then again in June 1887, I got a
genuine nest of Nightingales and, in addition to more suitable food,
gave a little chopped meat : they all got violent diarrhoea and two of
them died ; I then discontinued the meat, feeding the remaining
three upon powdered dog-biscuit, oat-flower, pea-meal, yolk of egg
and ants’ cocoons, and reared them without difficulty.
The same year I attempted to rear a nest of Lesser White-
throats upon moistened Abrahams’ food (a sort of German paste mixed
with yolk of egg and ants’ cocoons) but the tiny things got dirty with
the messy food, which contained a quantity of golden syrup, so that
I lost two of the four and the other two (like many hand-reared
birds when kept in a cage) ate more than was good for them and
died from apoplexy when about a month old.
Later in the same year I successfully reared one of two
Sedge-Warblers, feeding at first upon hard-boiled egg and bread¬
crumbs, but later upon the same food as&amp;apos;that upon which I had reared
my Nightingales. I kept the young bird in a flight-cage and he was
most fascinatingly tame : but overeating caused his death in
September, after the completion of his moult: I still possess his skin
which was pronounced by the late Dr. Sharpe to be one of the most
brightly-coloured examples he had seen.
I only once attempted to bring up a nest of Hedge-Accentors,
but failed owing to the fact that I gave a mixture of egg and sweet
biscuit—excellent for domesticated Canaries, but quite insufficient for
insectivorous birds.
* This and many similar experiences of carelessness on the part of show
attendants, and not infrequently ignorance on the part of judges who preferred
two cock birds exhibited as a pair to genuine sexes (on the plea that the former
were “ bigger birds”—two cocks would seem bigger than a pair) I gave up
showing years ago.

Dr. A. G. Butleb,
The Titmice are most entertaining birds to hand-rear, they
stand in a row on the edge of a basket shouting all together and
forcibly remind one of a class of charity children dressed alike and
reciting, but when feeding begins they push and struggle and jump
over each other’s backs to get at the feeding-stick. I neaidy
succeeded with Great Tits in 1886, but they were so intolerably
greedy that, after they were fully fledged and able to fly, they
apparently swallowed some of the wadding in their sleeping-basket,
and all died in one day. Coal-tits I could have brought up with¬
out trouble in 1888, but unfortunately my holiday came to an end
just as they were beginning to flutter about me, so that I had to
leave them to the care of a young girl who allowed them to
get into such a dirty condition that I lost them all. Blue-tits I
reared without difficulty in 1889, and for several months they were
some of the most delightful pets I had, flying to me and running all
over me so long as I remained in their aviary ; but they require
warmth in winter when kept in captivity and at that time the
enclosure which sheltered them was only protected from the cold on
the outside by a curtain. I provided warmly lined boxes for them
to retire to, but each bird would have a bed to himself and per¬
mitted no other to enter ; consequently they gradually all died
from cold. For rearing Tits a good insectivorous food moistened
is all that is needed ; but they must have warmth when adult, or
they will not long survive.
The only Wagtail I ever took in hand was the Pied, a bird
which I have frequently written about as the most charming and
satisfactory of all my foster-children. I and my wife brought it up
between us in 1892, feeding it upon a mixture of crushed biscuit,
yolk of egg, ants’ cocoons, and Abrahams’ food, mixed together and
moistened. The late Dr. Bradburn asserted that it was impossible
to hand-rear Wagtails, but as a matter of fact they give less trouble
than most young birds. I stated this fact some years ago, and
not long afterwards a reader of the Feathered World wrote to say
that he had brought up a nest of Yellow-Wagtails and was delighted
with their tameness. I never heard the love-song of the Pied Wagtail
until my bird became fully adult ; he often sang it to my servant
when she approached his cage. Of course we gave him a good deal

of liberty, but I fear that he did not get sufficient living insect food
since he died in May, 1896.
I reared Sand-Martins in 1887 upon Abrahams’ Nightingale
mixture, but after they had acquired the use of their wings they did
not care to take exercise, but simply sat on the food-pot and gorged
themselves to repletion. Of course I ought to have discontinued the
soft food and given them scoured maggots; but this I did not know
at the time, so I lost them all in about three weeks time. In 1891
I tried House Martins and with these I was rather more successful
owing to some extent perhaps to their affectionate nature which im¬
pelled them to leave their food and fly to me at once when I called
them ; unlike most birds they delight to nestle down in one’s hand.
However about two and a half months saw the end of them, to my
very great regret, and I do not recommend any of our members to
attempt to keep these birds, since it is very difficult to supply them
with anything approaching their natural conditions of life : I
should never have taken the nests myself, but when they were brought
to me I felt bound to do my best to save the poor little orphans’
lives.
Finches are of course easy to bring up, at first upon egg and
biscuit made into a paste and later upon scalded seeds and perhaps a
few smooth caterpillars, spiders, green fly, etc., but when reared they
must be kept apart from other birds if you do not wish them to
become insanely wild. I reared nine Linnets in 1888 and in the
previous year I had brought up a nest of four Chaffinches: the
only difficulty with the latter is that as soon as you offer to feed
them, although they open their beaks widely they sway their heads
from side to side and back away from you, so that it requires quick¬
ness and accuracy to get the food into their mouths and not all over
their faces : however I succeeded, and got two pairs of strong and
healthy birds for my pains.
In 1898 a young Jay was given to me ; it had been taken from
the nest shortly before and fed upon shredded raw beef and bread¬
crumbs. I at once changed the diet to a mixture of bread-crumbs,
powdered biscuit, egg and “ Century Food ” (a mixture very similar
to “ Cekto.”) I reared this bird without the least dfficulty, and, as
I have already noted, it lived in perfect health for thirteen years : I

rarely gave it raw meat, as too much of this tends to produce
diarrhoea, and is better avoided altogether if small dead birds or
mice are obtainable.
My first attempt to bring up young Skylarks was in 1886 and,
through want of knowledge, I lost them all ; but in 1887 and 1888
I w r as successful, owing to the fact that I introduced a good-sized
fresh turf into the runner in which I kept them : in the turf I cut a
round hole wherein I placed an old Sedge-Warbler’s nest, in which I
placed the birds, covering them up with flannel after each meal.
The birds I took in 1888 were only six days old when I removed
them, as I was returning home that day : I regarded this as some¬
what of a triumph at the time, but as only a perky little hen bird
survived the autumn moult, the only advantage I gained was the
knowdedge that hand-reared hen Skylarks were able to sing
excellently.
In 1887 I reared three Wrynecks from the nest, feeding them
upon Abrahams&amp;apos; Nightingale food and smooth caterpillars ; but I lost
all three before the end of the year, probably from lack of sufficient
living insect food. Years afterwards I tried a young Cuckoo, but it
was a disgustingly greedy bird and no sooner was it induced to feed
itself than it simply stuffed until its food-pan was empty, shouting
to be fed all the time it was eating and then going off into a state of
stupor from which it only aroused to eat again : it never attempted to
clean itself and its plumage became matted with filth : I gave it a
thorough wash every now and then, drying it afterwards by a fire,
but it soon died from over eating, unregretted.
Now it will perhaps be noticed that nearly the whole of my
experiments in hand-rearing birds were made in the three years
from 1886 to 1888 although I brought up successfully one or two
birds at later dates, and it will be seen that of the score or so of
species which I took in hand the following were the only ones which
lived for any length of time afterwards, viz. :—Missel-Thrush, Song-
Thrush, Blackbird, Nightingale, Pied Wagtail, Linnet, Chaffinch,
Starling, Jay, and Skylark, and of these the Wagtail and
Jay were reared when my experience in keeping birds was much
riper than when I made my previous attempts and long after I had
decided that it was not only kinder to the birds, but more satisfactory

Ill
to the owner, to capture them when adult than to bring them up hy
hand ; not that the parents suffer, as sentimentalists would have one
believe, to any great extent, when deprived of their young ; they are
indeed furious at the time, but they very speedily settle down to the
construction of a new nest ; indeed, in the case of Martins and House-
Sparrows, I have seen them at work almost immediately after the
removal of the old one ; moreover I have seen young neglected by
their parents and dying of starvation simply because the nest had
become drenched by heavy rain or because a thorn had grown
through the side, rendering it uncomfortable for the parent to settle
in it.
At the same time my advice to all bird-lovers is—Do not
attempt to stand in loco parentis to baby birds unless you have
learned, by the successes and failures recorded by others, exactly
how to treat them ; and remember that you must be content to hop
out of bed every morning at 6 a.m. to give the first meal : and that,
until the youngsters begin to get fairly lively, they will need a meal
every hour up to 9 p.m. (little and often is far better than a big
meal and stupor every two or three hours). Secondly I would
suggest that no young birds should be taken unless urgently required
for show-purposes, or as household pets : nestlings are extremely
fascinating, but this only makes one feel the deeper remorse at
having taken them, when they die young.
On the other hand, if nestling birds are brought to you which
you have not asked for, as was the case with not a few of those
which found their way to me, or if from any other cause the lives of
young birds are threatened, by all means do your utmost to bring them
up by hand, and may good luck attend your efforts.
Of birds which came into my hands soon after they had left
the nest I cannot boast: I kept them for a time, but they died
young.

By E. W. H. Blagg.
Towards the end of the month of June, 1911, I obtained a
pair of the very pretty Australian Plumed Ground Dove (.Lophophaps
leucogaster). Within a few minutes of being turned into the aviary
the cock bird proclaimed his sex by bowing and showing off to his
mate, with outspread wings and tail. In all the published accounts
of this species that I have had access to it is stated that the cock
and hen bird are identical in the colouring and marking of their
plumage, and so were these two birds on arrival, and so they remained
until the early summer of 1912, when the cock bird, by moult,
changed the colour of his plumes from fawn colour to blue grey, and
the posterior part of the crown of the head also became blue grey
instead of fawn colour. At the same time the black marking on his
throat became more extensive and pronounced.
In this state of plumage, not even the most earless observer
could say that the sexes were alike in colouring. I used to amuse
myself by asking casual visitors to my birds, ‘‘ Do you see any
difference in those two birds ? ” and at once would come the reply,
“ Certainly, one has a blue head and the other one has a brown
head.”
At this time I was speculating as to whether my bird would
retain his blue head for the rest of his life, or whether he would
reassume his brown head at his autumnal moult: in the former case
I should have drawn the conclusion that the blue head was the mark
of full maturity, and in the latter case that the blue head marked the
full breeding plumage. I was also wondering whether the hen bird
was going to follow the lead of her mate, and change the colour of
her plumes, &amp;c., for in that case the sexes would still be alike.
But no, the hen’s plumes have always remained brown, and at his
autumn moult the cock reassumed brown plumes. At the beginning
of this summer, 1913, his head again became blue, and at his autumn
moult he has once more grown brown plumes.
It would be interesting to hear whether anyone who has kept

this species has noticed this change of plumage, or whether it has
been noticed amongst the wild birds in Australia. It appears to me
to be an analogous case to the Chaffinch getting a blue head in
summer, the Brambling and Black-headed Bunting getting black
heads, and the various other breeding plumage changes in different
species, but, so far as I am aware, it has not hitherto been recorded
of any species of dove or pigeon that it assumes a distinctive phase
of plumage for the breeding season.
A FEW OF MY BIRDS IN CAGES.
By Mrs. Warren Vernon.
I am living at present in a very cold part of Scotland, and at
an altitude of 904 feet, so after hearing that last winter the glass
went down to 7° below zero I gave up all idea of out-door aviaries.
I have turned a room into a place for the birds to get exercise and
change, but the majority I have to keep in cages. So far this plan
seems to answer well, and from former experience I consider one has
a better chance of seeing if the birds require attention when in cages
and separately, than when a lot of them are together flying loose.
There is often one looking rough and a little immediate attention
and medicine if given at once will cure,&amp;apos; when in an aviary the bird
may be moping behind something and escape notice till too late to
save Its life.
The room has cork lino on the floor and looks N.W. getting
sun in the afternoon, large boughs in pots, lots of nest boxes and
cocoa nuts to furnish it. On the deep window sill I place some
green stuff, and in front of it a long bough on which the birds sit.
The window is half-wired and is opened whenever the weather
permits, it changes very quickly here from warm to bitter cold.
Large baths stand on a tray, the birds bathing constantly no matter
how cold the weather is. On a mantelshelf all the seeds for the
hard bills are put. There is electric light in the room, and I can
turn it on in the dark evenings, as it begins to get dark so early now,
I found certain birds much more restless and disturbers of
the peace at night than others, viz. : Java Sparrows (white variety)

and Wagtails. The latter used to keep up a continual tapping for
hours at night, until I discovered who the culprits were and caged
them. Now quiet reigns.
The following is a list of birds I at present keep, some in
cages, others flying loose :—Great Reed Warbler; Lesser Reed

The food I give all the soft bills is Galloway’s “ Life,” for
smaller ones “ Perfecto,” for Thrush and larger birds I mix it with
chopped lettuce and York cheese, gentles and mealworms, according
to their individual requirements, some of the Warblers are most
fearfully greedy and will eat till they die, so some days I give dry
sponge cake and ants’ eggs. There is much less eaten on those
days ! Seeds as follows : Paddy rice, three sorts of millet, spray
millet, canary, inga, sunflower and hemp; shell gravel in a saucer.
This finishes the foods.
I have also a lovely Blue Rock Thrush, a hand-reared Wry¬
neck, Gold Crest Wren and Jenny Wren. The latter I also hand-
reared. Also a lovely specimen of the Hunting Cissa, about which I
wrote last month. All the birds have become very tame, from being
constantly handled, and changed from cages to bird-room. Those in
cages fly every day for a short time in my room. They perch on my
head, and also help themselves to the food as I am preparing it.
I find all the small Waxbills like the soft food, and what is left over
in the various glasses from the soft bills I throw on the tray in their
cage. They find great amusement in picking it all over. The grass
seed too is a great delight when the seed is all picked out, the long
ends are taken up and made into nests; all the eight nest boxes are full
of grass. They will also eat small gentles and of course mealworms.
Personally I believe all foreign hardbills will eat live food if given.

The inmates of the Waxbill Aviary are a sight for color con¬
ditions and plumage. The Fire-finch is quite lovely. I have two
cock Grey Singing Finches and one hen. One cock bird sings
beautifully and continually, the other has never uttered a sound. I
have heard that sometimes they never do sing.
The pair have mated and the hen is sitting now, she has
built herself a lovely nest on the top of a box lined with horse-hair.
She was badly egg bound the other day but I was able to save her,
and she is all right and sitting steadily now. Apparently the noisy
inmates don’t in the least disturb her. The Hunting Cissa is really
a most funny pet, he is not like a bird at all, letting one pick him up,
hold him close to one and ruffle his feathers, all he does is to make
a growling noise and spread out his wings. He collects all the
shoes, handkerchiefs, etc., he can find in a heap, and will play a tug
of war with the girdle of a gown, pulling for all he is worth.
He hides meat in one’s shoes, and if given a dead Sparrow eats it,
bones, head and all.
I shall be going to a more salubrious part of Scotland next
spring and shall hope to have more birds and aviaries. I have also
one pair Long-tailed Tits, very tame and very pretty. This ends
my list.
“BOBS” &amp; “BILLY.”
By Mrs. CURREY.
“ Bobs ” was a most charming specimen of the robin family.
He first made my acquaintance during the hot summer of 1911,
when he was still in his baby clothes. Two days after our intro¬
duction an enticing mealworm brought him into my lap, and after
that we became fast friends and I never had any peace when sitting
in his particular piece of the garden, but his district seemed to have a
definite limit.
He always came to the dining room for meals, and one hot
night slept on the curtains and caused a fearful commotion by falling
out of bed in the middle of dinner and landing on the butler’s head.
The room had to be darkened and a lamp put in the garden before he
could be persuaded to leave the room. Sometimes he would be in a

11 Bobs” and 11 Billy.”
room a few minutes before anyone noticed him, when he would sing a
few notes to attract attention, and would generally be found perched
on a candle.
The spring of 1912 I found his nest, but his wife was never
allowed to come for food, any titbits were carried to her. Unfor¬
tunately the whole family succumbed to a too liberal allowance of
mealworms. Bobs himself became ill, nearly losing all power in one
leg, as apparently mealworms cause a sort of fit. He was about all
last winter and gradually got well and strong again, until at last, this
spring, he brought his wife “Roberta” to the window, but she never
came inside the room. After much consultation their nest was made
in the conservatory close by. It was on a large palm pot hidden by
maiden-hair fern, and Roberta’s bright eyes peeping out of the foliage
made the prettiest picture.
It was amusing to see how Bobs kept all birds away from the
dining room window, especially another robin—“ Billy ” by name—
who had a nest on a Camellia tree in a greenhouse on the other side
of the dining room. He and his wife “Wilhaemena” would perch on
a small tree near, and Billy would swoop on any food that he
thought Bobs did not notice ; a battle royal usually followed, in
which Bobs was always victorious. One day I noticed Billy had a
tiny speck on his head, so I thought Bobs had pulled his feathers out,
but the speck grew larger until the whole head and neck grew abso¬
lutely bald. In spite of this, Billy reared tw T o families, and it was
comic to see the bald-headed father attending to the children, as two
days after the fledglings had left the first nest, Wilhamena began
laying again in the same nest, and Billy seemed to have sole charge
of the little ones. He disappeared about the beginning of June, and
has not been seen since, so whether he has died of a cold in the head
or sunstroke I do not know\
Bob’s family again met with disaster, as the eggs were sucked
by mice a few days before they should have hatched. Bobs also has
not been seen since, but I hope he is not dead. I feel I have lost a
friend and am still vainly hoping he may come back again when I
call him.

The twenty-fifth annual exhibition of the L.C.B.A. was held
at the Horticultural Hall on the 27th, 28th and 29th of last month.
The entries were a record, thanks to the untiring energy of Mr. Allen
Silver and The Foreign Bird Exhibitors’ League for altering the
classifications and guaranteeing all the Classes. The Show un¬
doubtedly was a huge success, as never before was there such a
marvellous collection of rare and beautiful Foreign Birds seen —
nearly 20 of which being quite new to the show bench. The most
coveted prize for the Best Foreign Bird in the Show w&amp;apos;as awarded
to Mr. A. Ezra’s Southern Malachite Sunbird (Nectarinia famosa),
a most beautifully graceful bird and in most perfect condition.
Many good judges declared it the best bird ever exhibited both as
regards beauty and condition. In the Class for Parrakeets Miss
Clare’s pair of Queen Alexandra’s were beautiful, also her pair of
Hooded Parrakeets. The rarest Waxbill was Mr. Maxwell’s “ Peter’s
Spotted Finch,” a bird so seldom seen, and next to him came Mr.
Frost’s lovely pair of Red-faced Finches ( Pytelia afro) as well as
a Jameson’s Finch, both of which were not for competition. Mr.
Watts showed his beautiful Queen Whydah, and Mr. Beaty a Gold-
collared Paradise Whydah, a rare bird. Mr. Ezra’s Blue Chaffinch
was a very rare exhibit, as this bird is very scarce, even on the
island of Teneriffe, where they are known to occur, and is not
found except on one or two of the Canary Islands.
In the Class for Sunbirds, etc., Mr. Ezra showed five
different species of these exquisite creatures. They were the
Southern Malachite, the Greater Amethyst, the Cape Lesser
Double-collared, the Black-breasted, Yellow-backed, and the
Amethyst-rumped Sunbirds. Numbers two, three, and four were
new to shows. Major Horsbrugli sent a rare Brown-eared Bulbul
and a Blue and Black Jay from Yucatan, both new to the show
bench. Mrs. Warren Vernon exhfbited a most lovely Hunting Cissa
—the tamest bird in the show.
In the rare-feathered Class Mr. Ezra showed a beautiful

Yellow Ring-necked Parrakeet and a very rare yellow variety of
the Blossom-headed Parrakeet, the head in this instance being pale
pink. Mr. Sutton and Miss Clare benched some good Blue
Budgerigars.
In the Class for Flycatchers, etc., Mr. Ezra showed the
Small Minivet, the Red-flanked Bush Robin, the Large Niltava, a
pair of Fire Caps and a Short-billed Minivet. All except the last
shown for the first time — an exceptionally rare lot of birds.
In “ All other Species,” Lady Kathleen Pilking&amp;apos;ton showed a
lovely pair of Yuhimas, and a Black-throated Wren Babbler, and
Mr. Ezra a very rare and fascinating bird, the Red-tailed Minla—all
three new to the show-bench. Mr. Townsend showed a charming
pigmy Woodpecker and a splendid Indian Kingfisher, Mr. Maxwell
a good specimen of Levaillant’s Barbet and a Pink-crested Touraco.
In the Class for Tanagers Lady Kathleen Pilkington showed
a very rare Black-cheeked, Mr. Ezra a good pair of Pretres, Miss
Bonsfield a splendid White-capped, Mr. Maxwell a Red and
Black, an exceptionally rare bird. Mr. Townsend’s Black-shouldered
was a perfect beauty and in splendid condition.

LONGEVITY IN CAPTIVITY.

SIR-,—In the October number of the Magazine there was an article by
Dr. A. G. Butler on 1 &amp;apos; Longevity in Captivity,” etc. It may be of interest in
this connection to place on record the following cases :—
In February, 1874, I bought a Red-headed Cardinal (Paroaria cucullata).
This bird died in June, 1899. He thus lived twenty-five years and four months
in captivity, occupying the same cage during the whole period. During the last
three years or so he showed some signs of age, much thickened scales on the legs
and a difficulty in the autumn moult, otherwise he remained in excellent
plumage with a brilliant red crest, mostly raised, and was very lively to the end.
In July, 1872, I bought a Lesser Sulphur Crested Cockatoo (Cacatua
sulpherea ), he was then a year old. This bird was killed by an accident in June,
1906, being then about thirty-five years old and showing no signs of age. He
enjoyed a good deal of liberty about the grounds. Of course this is not so in¬
teresting a case as the first, since some species of parrots are known to live to a
great age, over 100 years probably. WALTER CHAMBERLAIN.
SEXING PARRAKEETS.
SIR,—I was glad to see that my humble paper had called forth such a
hearty response. Lord Tavistock’s article is extremely interesting and should
prove most helpful to keepers of Parrakeets. Since writing my paper I have
bought several more Broadtails and in every single case the broods have either
been sexed wrongly or the birds have not been sexed at all.
With regard to young Redrumps I am glad to be put right. I understand
from one who had bred them that one could not sex them until the first moult.
Personally I have never had them although I possess a pair.
The Red Rosella question seems to have caused a good deal of heart¬
burning and I fear I was a little precipitate in bringing Dr. Butler’s name into
the discussion. I do not possess Dr. Butler’s “ How to Sex Cage Birds,” but a
friend allowed me to consult his copy one day and I quoted from memory with
regard to the green spot. Like Dr. Butler I have been a very keen entomologist
and I dare say he will recognise the name in that capacity. It was the Red
Rosellas that first led me to doubt whether they were a true pair. One or two
senior aviculturists took a good deal of trouble to point out the green spot in the
one bird but not in the other. But I couldn’t see it myself and I felt more and
more convinced I had two cocks. Subsequent history proved I was right, and
from that moment I have never ceased to carry out for myself the differences in
the sexes of birds in general and Parrakeets in particular. The result of my
investigations are chronicled. They are absolutely original as far as I am con¬
cerned, and, with the one exception of the unfortunate green spot, I neither

referred to nor consulted a single book of any sort. True I used Mr. Page’s book
as a reference to this extent. I referred to the illustrations in his book to,
illustrate my points and for all I know he may have in the text entirely reversed
my opinion. I hold that if you want to effectually check all progress in any
subject (and aviculture no less than any other) you will write papers with
“ reference ” books spread thickly on the table before you and be fearful lest you
say aught that does not entirely agree with the authorities. If then any remark or
phrase of mine occurs which has appeared in some book or paper or journal some
years previously it is because the writer of that book, paper, or journal and I had
made a similar observation ; which being corroborated is therefore probably
correct. At any rate I can plead guiltless of plagiarism.
But I still feel unconvinced about the green spot, as far as my experience
goes that part of the Rosellas anatomical colouration seems to me to be
absolutely variable and inconsistant. The fact that hen Rosellas are more green
about the head and neck than cocks would ipso facto tend to the assumption
that a bird with a green spot was a hen. But to say that hens had a green spot,
or that all birds who have a green spot are hens, seems to me more than one can
say. Such a variable quality cannot be constant and an inconstant characteristic
cannot be a certain sign, and an uncertain sign cannot be a reliable guide. In
saying this I impugn no lack of respect to Abrahams’ extraordinary and innate
genius. I have no doubt he could spot a hen Rosella the moment he saw it.
Having found a hen Rosella or perhaps several with a green spot he inferred that
all had, and we know quickly the wish becomes father to the thought. Besides,
I ask, who would want to waste time looking for the green spot in a bird so easy
to sex as a Red Rosella.
I must apologise for occupying so much space, but I felt that certain
points needed clearing up, especially from my point of view.
L. LOVELL-KEAYS.

THE SUN-BITTERN.
Eurypyfga helias.
By D. Seth-Smith, F.Z.S.
(Curator of Birds, Zoological Society of London).
</construct>
<bodyText confidence="0.988482863636364" page_id="32669555"  page_num="121" year="" vol="">
This very elegant and graceful species is more often seen in
Zoological Gardens than in private collections of living birds, but it
is one that would well repay the attention of aviculturists if only it
could be procured. It is but seldom imported however, and always
commands a high price.
That enterprising and reliable dealer Herr August Fockelmann,
of Hamburg, received a consignment some few months ago, of which
the Zoological Society of Fondon procured a pair. These were
placed in a compartment of the Western Aviary, next to that in
which was a male example of the same species which has lived in
the Gardens for some time.
The latter bird saluted the new arrivals through the wire
partition with a series of displays of his wonderfully marked wings,
but whether this was a sign of pleasure or disapproval I am not
certain. I am inclined to think the latter, was the case, for the
“ display ” of this bird, when I have seen it, has not been one of love,
but one evidently intended to frighten away the object to which it is
directed. The sexes are alike in plumage, and I doubt if there is
any definite sexual display. I was very anxious to obtain a photo¬
graph of the Sun-Bittern with wings expanded, so one morning I had
a Kag&amp;apos;u run through into the compartment in which lived the then
solitary male of this species. The Sun Bittern commenced to display

to the Kagu at once, and I had no difficulty in securing some good
pictures.
There are two species of Sun-Bitterns, Eurypyga helias of
Brazil, Amazonia, Bolivia, Guiana, and Venezuela, and the slightly
larger E. major of Central America, Columbia and Ecuador.
These birds are said to inhabit the Swamps, feeding on all
kinds of insects, small fish and probably small frogs. In captivity
they live well on a diet of finely-chopped raw meat, mealworms,
small live fish and any insects procurable. Fly-catching appears to
be one of their favourite occupations. The insect is approached
with slow stealthy steps until the bird is within striking distance,
when the thin, snake-like neck darts forward and the insect is
secured at the top of the spear-like bill.
When at rest amongst vegetation the Sun-Bittern is practi¬
cally invisible, the undulations on its plumage being wonderfully
protective, but no sooner does it rise and expand its large butterfly¬
like wings than it becomes a most conspicuous and very beautiful
object.
The late Mr. A. B. Bartlett contributed a very interesting
account of the breeding of the Sun-Bittern to the Proceedings of the
Zoological Society in 1866. It appears that the year 1865 was re¬
markable for the long continuance of dry hot weather during the
summer and autumn, which probably influenced the breeding and
tendency to breed amongst animals that had previously shown no
■such inclination. In May, a pair of Sun-Bitterns, the first ap¬
parently that the Society had possessed, commenced to show signs
of wishing to breed. Bits of stick, roots of grass and similar
materials were carried about, and the birds were noticed constantly
walking round the water pool apparently in search of something.
The idea suggested itself that they were searching for mud, so this
was supplied, with the result that they commenced at once to use it.
An old straw nest was placed at the top of a ten-foot pole and
was adopted by the birds, both of which carried up mud and clay,
mixed with straw, roots, and grass. The sides of the nest were
raised and thickly plastered with mud. The first egg was laid in
May, but was dropped on the ground, and so much did the fragments
resemble the egg of a Moorhen that, as there was a single blue

Waterhen in the same compartment, Bartlett was inclined to think
at first that this bird had laid the egg. However, in the early part
of June another egg was laid, this time in the nest, and it agreed
with the fragments discovered earlier. The two birds took turns in
incubation and in twenty-seven days the egg hatched.
Bartlett describes the young bird as one of the prettiest he
ever saw, being covered with fine short tufts of down, and much
resembling the young of Plovers and Snipe. It remained for twenty-
one days in the nest, being regularly fed by its parents on small fish
and insects. It grew rapidly, and at the end of two months was
indistinguishable from its parents. A second young bird was hatched
later on in the same year and was also successfully reared. It is
much to be hoped that we may be able to repeat this success in the
coming summer.
[The Sun-Bittern I have, is ridiculously tame, and does not
resent being picked up ; and placed on the palm of the hand.

To anyone inclined to embark on that form of aviculture in
which an attempt is made to induce foreign birds to remain uncon¬
fined in the vicinity of their owner’s home, the dove family affords a
not unpromising field for experiment and a fair chance of success.
Many exotic doves are, in the first place, quite indifferent to cold
and some of the hardiest are reasonably well endowed with the
necessary homing instinct. Unlike finches and parrakeets, they can
generally be relied upon to arrive free from infectious disease : they
are easily and cheaply fed (I refer of course to the grain-eating
•species only) and under no circumstances are they destructive to
trees and shrubs.
Our experiments with doves at liberty have now been carried
on for a considerable number of years, and in a few cases interesting
and satisfactory results have been obtained. The number of failures
has certainly been large, but in some instances it is only fair to
.conclude that they have been due to unfavourable local conditions

which do not exist in every part of the country, and that species
which have not done well with us might succeed in establishing
themselves amid more suitable surroundings. Our garden is unfor¬
tunately by no means an ideal home for any bird needing shelter and
seclusion, as it is very scantily provided with winter cover, a defect
which the heavy clay soil makes it extremely difficult to remedy,
since many of the most useful evergreen trees gifrw slowly and thrive
none too well. It is also more or less surrounded at a distance by
large woods which tend to draw the birds away; and last, but not
least, it is the happy hunting ground of owls — both brown and white,
— endowed with a perverted appetite for feathered game which an
unlimited supply of rats and mice renders wholly inexcusable. It
is, therefore, not to be wondered at that our losses have at times
been heavy and disappointing, and that more than one promising
experiment has ended in failure.

the earliest introductions, and although they do not appear to
increase from year to year, their numbers are well maintained, and
no fresh importation seems necessary. Most of the original birds
were turned out with cut wings, so that they had plenty of time
to become accustomed to their surroundings before they gradually
regained their powers of flight. Their welfare has twice been
seriously threatened by outbreaks of disease, but, fortunately, on
neither occasion did the mischief get quite beyond control. About six
years ago, the wild Turtle Doves, which visit the gardens in large
numbers, were found to be suffering from canker, a highly infectious-
disease of the throat, well known to pigeon fanciers. How they
started it will always remain a mystery, but probably one of them
had come into contact with a diseased domestic bird and soon spread
the infection among his fellows. The results w r ere most disastrous;
large numbers of South American Spotted Pigeons were lost, and
practically the entire stock of Barbary Doves, Senegal Doves, and
other foreign members of the genus Turtur. When the infection
had become really bad, the Crested Doves also began to die, and for
a time things looked very bad indeed. Fortunately, however, when
the autumn migration removed the Turtle Doves, an improvement
set in, and by the beginning of winter the disease had apparently

-disappeared. The next summer, on the return of the Turtle Doves,
it broke out afresh, but by immediately destroying all sick birds,
discouraging the presence of the healthy ones on the foreign birds’
feeding trays and dressing large areas of ground with salt, a serious
outbreak was fortunately averted. The following season a few cases
again occurred ; but, this last year, I am glad to say there has been
no outbreak at all, and I am hoping that the disease will not return.
Canker is quite distinct from the diphtheria which in certain seasons
•carries off the Woodpigeons in such vast numbers. A Woodpigeon
suffering from diphtheria will be found to have its throat covered
with whitish spots : a dove suffering from canker has the entire
gullet choked with cheesy matter and much distended. It has great
difficulty in swallowing food and often throws away a grain of seed
after making several ineffectual attempts to get it down. Another
bird which picks up the same seed afterwards, will, if susceptible to
the disease become infected on the spot. I have never seen any
kind of dove suffering from diphtheria, except the Woodpigeon ;
but many species, including the Stock Dove, readily contract canker.
During the winter following the first canker outbreak, tuber¬
culosis made its appearance among the Crested Doves. A good
many were lost from this cause also, but I managed to save a few of
the sick ones by keeping them warm and feeding them on stimulating
food; avian tuberculosis, even when very advanced, is by no means
so incurable as some people imagine, although, if the diseased bird is
not a valuable one, it is usually better to destroy it at once. The
same methods as were adopted in dealing with the canker outbreak,
viz., salt dressings and the removal of sickly birds at the earliest
opportunity, did a good deal towards checking the ravages of tuber¬
culosis. The wretched disease has not been entirely got rid of, as I
know to my cost, probably owing to the large area over which the
infection is spread and the difficulty of treating the whole : but the
cases which occur now are isolated ones and it is long since a
Crested Dove has been among the victims.
When at liberty Crested Doves attempt to breed nearly the
whole year round, but during the winter months they are seldom or
never successful in rearing their young. The latter, on leaving the
nest, may be distinguished from their parents by their duller colours

and very large crests, which, curiously enough, are at that time
more developed than when the birds are fully adult.
In disposition the Crested Dove is little better than the
majority of the pigeon family, which, contrary to popular ideas,
are jealous, quarrelsome, and greedy, and much given to bullying
their own wives and running after their neighbours’.
When courting, the cock raises his tail vertically over his
back and makes a succession of rather rapid bows, each bow being
accompanied by a gulping coo and a spreading of the tail and wings ;
an exactly similar performance is gone through to intimidate a male
rival. The Crested Dove shows little inclination to molest other
birds, but is quite able to take its own part when attacked, and in a
dispute in which I once saw one engaged with a Roseate Cockatoo,
the cockatoo, who had been the aggressor, came off rather second best.
Although largely arboreal in their habits, Crested Doves spend
a good deal of time on the ground as well, and run with great
rapidity. Their flight, which is accompanied by a loud whistling
sound, is tremendously rapid, and I know few birds which can equal
them in point of speed : the wing&amp;apos;s are flapped several times in quick
succession, after which they are held rigid for a few moments until
the impetus begins to slacken. On alighting, the bird throws its
tail up over its back, apparently with a view to keeping its balance.
South American Spotted Pigeons (Cohtmba maculosa) were
introduced about the same time as the Crested Doves and treated in
the same way on their arrival. They have done well—except during
the canker epidemic already mentioned—and a flock of about eighteen
maintains itself from year to year, the number of young birds bred
each season being apparently just sufficient to make up for the losses
among the adults. The flight of this bird is not unlike that of the
Ringdove, but when seen on the wing it is not easily mistaken for
any other species as the rather large head and neck give it a peculiar
appearance which distinguishes it from other doves of the same size.
The Spotted Pigeon begins to nest very early in the year, and
frequently selects the prickly branches of an Araucaria as a site for
building operations. During the breeding&amp;apos; season the cock may often
be seen sitting at the extreme top of some bare tree, uttering his
peculiar call, a hoarse rhythmical cOrrrrw, cor, cor, cdorrrw, cor, cor

coorrrw, at frequent intervals. Should a rival attempt to answer
him from near at hand, a battle generally ensues, for the species is
decidedly pugnacious. When courting, the male bird makes a deep,
quick bow to the hen, accompanying it with a short “ corw,” fol¬
lowed by a shiver of the wings.
Bronze-necked Wood-doves (Haplopelia larvata ) were a later
introduction than the two species already mentioned, our first and
only consignment reaching us about seven years ago. This rare South
African Dove is so little known to aviculturists that it may be well to
give some account of its appearance. In size and general build it
bears a very close resemblance to the Australian Green-winged Dove
and probably also to the Rufous Dove, a bird which I ought however
to say that I have never seen alive. The adult male has the back,
wings, and tail a uniform dark vinous brown and the breast dark
vinous, becoming more or less chestnut on the abdomen and under
tail coverts. The face is greyish white and there is a good deal of
metallic green on the back of the neck. The hen is smaller and
duller than the cock and has little or no white on her face. Young
birds at first possess a speckly, rather grouse-like plumage, which is
moulted shortly after leaving the nest.
The Bronze-necked Wood-dove appears to be quite hardy ;
our birds spent their first winter out of doors without injury, although
during a brief spell of severe frost, the thermometer on one occasion
actually fell below zero, and the following summer they bred and
successfully reared their young. The nest is generally built in a thick
bush, about 8ft. from the ground, and is composed of fibrous roots and
fine twigs; it is rather a slip-shod affair, as is usual with pigeons, but
a certain amount of stability is sometimes ensured by the use of an
old Thrush’s nest as a foundation. Two white eggs are usually laid
and both sexes take part in their incubation ; two or three broods
being reared in one season. When breeding, the cock becomes very
jealous and quarrelsome, fighting with other doves, attacking and
driving away any small birds which happen to approach him and
pursuing his mate with low humming coos.
The Bronze-necked Wood-dove is mainly terrestial in its habits,
walking and running rapidly over the bare ground underneath thick
evergreen shrubs and never venturing into the open. The flight is

low, rapid, and silent, and is not unlike that of a Woodcock. In
their diet these birds appear to be largely insectivorous and I have
found them extremely fond of mealworms, although they have some
trouble in killing them and evidently feel uncomfortable if they
happen to swallow them alive. They eat a considerable quantity
of maize and often seem to prefer it to smaller grain.
The first year we bred them a good many late hatched young
died during the early winter, so next season I attempted to in¬
crease our stock by catching up all the immature birds I could get
hold of and placing them in an aviary. I managed to secure four,
but the experiment was not a success as two died shortly afterwards
of septic fever and a third killed itself by flying against some glass.
As far as I can tell we have at present about four or five pairs of
Bronze-necked Wood-doves at liberty in the garden, but their retiring
habits and unsociable disposition make them extremely difficult to
count. They appear to be immune to canker, but occasionally suffer
from tuberculosis.
Wonga-wonga Pigeons (Leucosarcia picata ) were imported in
small numbers on several occasions, but it is only quite recently that
they have begun to establish themselves and do really well. At
first, many succumbed to tuberculosis and the few young that were
hatched were destroyed by the American Grey Squirrels before they
were able to protect themselves. For the last two years, however,
the ground has been less contaminated, and the squirrels being as far
as possible removed, the Wonga-wongas have done much better and
a number of young were successfully reared this season. Leucosarcia
picata is mainly terrestial in its habits, only perching in trees when
alarmed or engaged in nesting or when uttering its peculiar call—a
loud, high-pitched coo-coo, coo-coo, coo-coo, coo-coo, coo, coo, coo, coo —
often continued for five or ten minutes without a pause. The nest is
usually placed in an evergreen tree from ten to twenty feet from the
ground. The method of building is rather peculiar, the hen sitting
on the selected site, while the cock searches for the materials.
Having found a suitable stick he flies up close to his mate, walks
round her two or three times and then steps on to her back and gently
offers his burden which she takes and arranges under her, while he
goes off to obtain a further supply.

Like many other Australian Doves, the Wonga-wonga has a
fatal habit, when at liberty, of attempting to fly through closed
windows and wire netting. In the case of the window, the bird’s
great weight and the tremendous impetus of its flight sometimes
carry it off victorious to the detriment of the glass, but where wire
netting is the obstacle, a broken neck or a cracked skull is the sad
and inevitable result of the collision.
A small importation of Peaceful Doves ( Geopelia tranquilla)
did not promise well at first, and after twelve months had elapsed, a
solitary cock alone remained. It did not seem worth w T hile to get
any more, as such small birds appeared to stand a poor chance
against the relentless harrying of the owls ; but the little fellow’s
musical coia-coo, coia-coo, sounded so persistently throughout the
day that I at length took pity on his loneliness and got him a mate.
Some weeks after she had been turned out she injured her wing and
had considerable difficulty in flying, although she was just able to
elude my attempt to capture her. In the end, however, rather to
my surprise, she made a good recovery and brought up three broods
during the course of the summer. The latest hatched did not
survive very long after they had left the nest, and two more fell
victims to a neighbour’s escaped Goshawk, which for many months
paid the most unwelcome visits to the garden. Four however, were
left at the end of the winter and more young were reared during the
ensuing summer and again this year. With luck, therefore, and the
importation of a few fresh birds, this pretty little species may
eventually become established.
Barbary Doves ( Turtur risorius ) which are kept at liberty in
many gardens with considerable success, have never done well with
us. Many of those first liberated proved unable to stand the winter
without artificial shelter, and of the survivors all but one perished
during the canker outbreak, together with the Senegal and Half-
collared Doves. About a year ago a few more were obtained, which
have proved hardier than their predecessors, but they have not bred
well.
Bronze-winged Pigeons ( Phaps chalcoptera ) at one time
promised well, being hardy birds, indifferent to cold, not susceptible
to disease and little inclined to stray when first released. In the

end, however, they gradually used to disappear, and although we
tried them on several occasions the result was always the same.
The hens, for some reason, invariably vanished sooner than the cocks,
some of the latter remaining about for nearly two years.
Thibetan Pigeons (Columba leuconota) were released full¬
winged. They stayed well for a shoi’t time and then deserted us.
I believe we should have had more success with them had they been
provided with a dove-cote, for they are naturally rock-dwellers and
spent most of their time on the roof and ledges of the house.
Cinnamon Doves, Scaly Doves and White-crowned Pigeons have
all been tried but soon grew discontented with their surroundings
and left. Tambourine Doves, Bleeding-heart Pigeons and Crowned
Pigeons stayed better, but were unable to survive the winter without
artificial heat. Triangular Spotted Pigeons also proved sensitive to
the cold : a hen of this species we once had was extremely tame,
delighting in being stroked and petted, and showing her pleasure at
the approach of her friends by cooing and shaking her wings. For
quite a long time she was much attached to me and I could do any¬
thing I liked with her, but after I had been absent from home for a
few weeks she would have nothing more to do with me, pecking and
striking in the most spiteful manner whenever I attempted to touch
her. I could never understand this sudden change in her behaviour,
for she was as affectionate as ever towards her other friends, and
birds as a rule have good memories and seldom forget those of whom
they have once been fond.
About eighteen months ago I started an experiment with
Smith’s Ground Doves (Geophaps smithi), obtaining eight of these
curious little brown and white birds, which look more like partridges
than pigeons. On their arrival I cut their wings and turned them
into the grass quadrangle round which the house is built and which,
being sunny and sheltered, I hoped would provide them with a
satisfactory home. They did well for a short time, but after about
a fortnight four died very suddenly, from what exact cause I was
unable to discover. The remainder, however, wei’e more fortunate
and lived for some months in perfect harmony. Then, one day to
my great surprise, three of them suddenly attacked the fourth and
scalped his head badly, and would doubtless have killed him had

they not been prevented by a timely rescue. They had always-
seemed so peaceable, sitting together huddled up in a heap for
hours at a time that I was much astonished by this murderous out¬
break. The victim was kept shut up until he had recovered from his
injuries and was then released in another part of the garden.
Not long afterwards, one of the three in the quadrangle was
killed by a dog, but the others, which proved to be a pair, survived
the winter and showed no disposition to stray when their wings had
grown. They spent their whole time on the ground, never attempt¬
ing to perch, and if anyone approached them they would squat until
nearly trodden on, rising at the last moment with a loud whirring
flight which carried them up and over the roof like rockets, almost
before one had time to realize that they had gone. In a very short
time however they would be back again in their old quarters.
The courting display of Smith’s Ground Dove bears a very
close resemblance to that of the Crested Dove, the bird bowing and
half-spreading its wings and raised tail and uttering a loud purring
“ corrw ” with each bow. Both sexes indulge in this performance,
and may sometimes be seen bowing and cooing to each other, alter¬
nately, a habit I have not observed in any other pigeon. When
moving about, feeding, the birds have a rather different call to the
one already described, a kind of “corrw — coo ” uttered at frequent
intervals with a short pause after the first note. I have found mine,
on the whole, quite peaceable with other birds, but occasionally the
persistent quarrelling of the Crested Doves would irritate the cock
Geophaps smithi, causing him to rush upon the disturbers of the
peace and chase them until they took flight, when he would indulge
in his funny little display as a last defiance to the retreating foe and
return in triumph to his wife. As the pair appeared to be in the
best of health I had great hopes that they might breed this summer.
They have not, however, done so, and recently the hen became
partially paralyzed in her legs, apparently in consequence of some
injury, but is now I am glad to say well on the road to recovery.
The single bird stayed for some time in the enclosure in which we
had placed him and then vanished entirely for about three months.
I had quite given him up for lost and was therefore considerably
surprised one day to hear that he had been seen walking along the

stone terrace in front of the house. After that he again disappeared,
but when in June I obtained a second lot of G. sviithi and put them
in a large glass aviary surrounded by high wire netting, he had joined
the newcomers within three days of their arrival. How he succeeded
in discovering his relations so quickly is rather a mystery to me, as
he could not possibly have seen them and was separated from them
by many obstacles. From that time on, he has been constantly in
evidence, but what will he the ultimate fate of the little flock time
alone can show.
In concluding an article dealing with the acclimatization of a
family of birds which includes among its British representatives such
a notorious evil doer as the common Woodpigeon, it may not be out
of place to say something in answer to the arguments of those people
who view with horror the introduction of exotic birds and regard it
as a certain menace to fruit-growing and agriculture. They point out
continually the disastrous results which have followed the introduc¬
tion of the Sparrow into America and the Starling into Australia and
appear to imagine that because British birds multiply abnormally in
foreign countries, therefore foreign birds will multiply abnormally in
Great Britain. The analogy is, I can confidently say, quite unsound
and their fears are not in the slightest degree likely to be justified.
Of the many species of foreign birds we keep, or have kept at liberty,
(most of which have been carefully chosen as being particularly likely
to establish themselves) one and only one, if certain eminently desir¬
able species of Waterfowl are excepted, has shown some promise of
becoming a truly wild bird, viz., the beautiful and harmless Hill Tit
(Liothrix leutea) or “ Pekin Robin.” Such an addition to the British
list, no one surely could find any objection to. All the rest — doves,
finches, parrakeets, etc . — must have artificial feeding throughout the
year, and even with this assistance, a maintenance of numbers and
not an annual increase is, as a rule, the most that can be expected.

of “The Northern Territory” of Australia.
By G. A. Heumann.
Beading not long ago Mr. Astley’s article in No. 3, Vol. IV.
of the Avicultural Magazine as to the breeding of the Hooded
Parrakeets, and later in No. IV. his remarks on the colouration of
the head and hood, it may be of interest to members to hear a few
words on this question from one who has seen and studied them
in their native home, the Northern Territory of Australia.
Six years ago I conceived the idea of “ doing ” the Northern
Territory with a friend, and leaving Sydney early in June by boat,
we arrived in due course, via Brisbane and Thursday Island, in Port
Darwin. The train leaves here twice a week for Pine Creek, tire
last outpost of civilization, and takes 9—10 hours to do the 140
miles, providing the driver does not see a “turkey” along the line,
.when he will stop the train to shoot the “ turkey ” first. We were
fortunate enough to be able to hire donkeys to take us into the
interior, but I will not be wearisome with a description of my travels
but come straight to the point on which I wanted to write. Camp¬
ing in a place called Granite Bocks, &amp;apos;we were fortunate in having
picked a spot where parrots, pigeons, and finches abounded, more so
than in any other place we camped in during our trip. These
granite rocks are most interesting in themselves. Huge granite
boulders lie strewn about; above them again would lie one, some¬
times two, or even three separate boulders. One wonders at the
wonderful energy required to roll these boulders on the top of each
other. Two water-holes, each one about 100 feet in circumference,,
are the attraction for the thousands of birds which come to visit
this dreary spot. The weather in these regions is very hot during
the day-time, even in the colder months, registering 120° and more
in the sun, but sinking to 40° at five or six in the morning at times,
and I may say that not expecting this low temperature we had not
sufficiently provided for the cold and felt it at times most intensely.
The sun rose (July) about 7 a.m., but already, at about 6.30 the

Mr. G. A. Heumann,
common Parrakeets flew past, screeching as they always do ; after
them came the Hawks, waiting for the flocks of Doves and Finches
to feast on. I shot as many as six to ten every morning, amongst
them the beautiful white variety. The first of the smaller birds to
arrive were the Blue-eyed Doves, and in countless numbers. When
u hawk would swoop down on them whilst drinking, the whirr of
their wings reminded us of the roar of the incoming waves on the
ocean beach. Then appeared the Parrakeets, the Browns and the
Hooded, and here I may mention that those I handled all had the
hood coloured black ; the younger male, only half coloured, showed a
more dirty sooty colour. All the specimens I handled—speaking of
males of course, — show 7 ed either the black or sooty colouration.
None, either from this part or those from the Mary River or Driffield
way, had a hood that one might call brown, even with a certain
amount of imagination. Of course the Northern Territory is a vast
country and other forms may exist elsewhere, but within 300 miles
south of Port Darwin, they are all alike. I often wondered where
the real Golden-shouldered, “ the yellow 7 frontal banded,” might be
at home, but no information was available, so that I have concluded
they must be found in the southern part of the Golf Country,
down the Roper River or thereabouts.
After the Parrakeets had quenched their thirst, the Finches
arrived in untold quantities. Gouldians, the red and black-headed
ones in grey and coloured costumes, Masks, Longtail Grassfinches
(the red-hilled variety) and Double-bars (the black-rumped kind) —
they all catne, not in hundreds hut in thousands. The Blood-finches
seem to me to he the elite of this rabble, always keeping to themselves,
taking their drink apart from the others. It is generally supposed
that all these birds are very delicate, but to live through the cold
and bleak nights up there would convince anyone that they are as
hardy as any hard finch. All they really want in an aviary is a
family nest, so that, as in their native home, they can roost in com¬
pany inside and keep one another warm during the colder nights.
One may see their nests almost on every bush. As the sun rises,
the different kinds of Honeysuckers come flitting across the water;
those gorgeous Bee-eaters are there in great numbers, probably their
winter quarters; and during the day, Pelicans or Jabberoos would

visit the water-holes, but, strange to say, all the birds would only
come to one and the same water-hole for their drink. The Parrakeets
1 have only seen drinking in the morning ; the Finches again at about
2 p.m., when also the Pigeons would come for their only daily drink.
I have counted as many as ninety Squatter Pigeons run single file to
their favorite spot, take their drink and march out in the opposite
direction. About 20 miles away from here we met flocks of hundreds
of Black Cockatoos and Corellas, but they were very shy and it was
hard to get a shot at them. What we found a great nuisance were
the native cats at the Granite Rocks, they would carry off anything
not under lock and key : it was most annoying to me to lose my
spectacles and my toothbrush.
Undoubtedly the Northern Territory is a paradise for the
sportsman, if it can be called “ sport ” to sit at the side of a “ billa-
bong ” ( i.e . large waterhole) and shoot at a flock of ducks till one is
tired : they will just rise at the shot, circle round and alight again.
They have probably never seen a white man and most likely never
before heard a shot. On the Alligator swamps, Pigmy Geese are in
thousands, as are in fact every other kind of Waterfowl, and their
species are numerous. I forgot to mention the beautiful Tree Creepers
I saw up there. Towards evening they would play in the air, having
kind of games as it were, and so display their beautifully marked
wings, they always appeared to me to be as looking, when gracefully
displayed, like beautiful lace.
Of course expeditions like these are not all “ beer and skittles”
as the saying goes, for there are humorous and sad experiences, and
though nothing in the bird-line, I would like to give a humorous
incident in concluding this article. Riding alongside of me was one
of our black boys who had a smattering of English and civilisation
—coming from Pine Creek. Having lived on hard biscuits the last
days, my mouth was dry and very sore. To give myself relief I
removed my top plate and the nigger saw it. He got away from
me, fear depicted in his face. In his pigeon-English he informed
my friend of the fact that I had removed my jaw, asking him to
make me do it again. I show T ed him, to convince him it was not
my jaw. Yet a few minutes later his hands went up to his teeth
as he had seen me do it and he rattled them in the hope to remove

them; but in vain, they would not budge ! The result was that no
present, tobacco, knife, or anything else would tempt him to come
near me again, and that night he deserted us. He took me to be a
witch doctor.
There is yet another point that might interest some of our
members, belonging perchance to the Aquaria-keeping fraternity,
They would find these Billabongs and small water-holes veritable
treasure-troves. Nearly all saltwater fish may be caught in fresh¬
water, the reason is that in the rainy season these water-holes are
connected with creeks, which in their turn join the Mary or Daly
Rivers, emptying themselves into the sea. No doubt the fish find their
way up, and when the floods recede must stay in enforced confine¬
ment and accustom themselves to fresh water. But it is the smaller
species of fish, suitable for aquaria, which I want to draw attention
to. There is one species—“ Five Guns ” we called them—the shape
of a South American Chanchitos, but silver in colour, with five black
spots on each side, lessening in size from head to tail, the adult fish
about three inches. Then a little mud Carp, very small, between
one and one-and-a-half inches, in colour shining all shades of the
rainbow in the sun ; this Carp, like the Needle fish of evil remem¬
brance—which once stung by, one never forgets it—will bury itself
in the mud and lie dormant whilst the water-hole is dry and sun¬
baked. When the rains come, up comes the fish to enjoy new life.
And there are many more, small pied fish, greedily eating the
breadcrumbs one feeds them with, and others striped red and blue.
Every water-hole seems to have a gem of its own. But as this is a
bird-journal, I will say no more about fish.
Much to my regret, I had to leave the Territory before the
scheduled time, for Malaria,—the curse of the tropics,—proved too
much for me, and were it not for the recurrence, even now, of this
awful illness, I would have nothing but delightful recollections of
what was, with that one exception, a most interesting and very
enjoyable trip.

Geocichla erythronota (Sclater).
By HUBEKT D. ASTLEY.
This extremely handsome Ground Thrush was discovered by
Dr. Alfred Russell Wallace (who has only lately passed away) near
Makassar in the island of Celebes, to which it seems to be confined,
occurring in both the southern and the northern parts. Dr. Meyer,
who spent some months in Celebes, in 1870 and 1871, states that
he observed this fine species a few miles from Menado on the way
to Lotta in February and March, at Tumumpat near Menado in
March, and in the churchyard of the Europeans at the latter place,
from April to July. It lives chiefly on the ground, and is very shy.
In the Ibis of 1859, p. 113, we find the following :—“Another

“ as the head chestnut-red. For this bird, of which only two examples
“ were sent, we propose the name Geocichla erythronota. From
“ Lombok Mr. Wallace has transmitted the true Geocichla interpres .”

It seems that the female resembles the male in colour, but I
should imagine that as in others of the group, the male would be
distinguishable by more purity of colouring, as for instance in the
case of the fairly well known G. citrina —the Orange-headed Ground
Thrush ; where the back of the female is not nearly so pure a grey
as her mate’s. The adult bird has the general colour of the upper
parts orange-chestnut; lores white; eye-stripe black; etc. I will not
weary readers with an elaborate and detailed description, suffice it
to say that except for the forehead, crown of head, back of neck,
back, and upper tail coverts, which are, as I have said, orange-
chestnut, this Thrush is black and white, as seen in the illustration.
A fine distribution and rpixture of colouring, a bird much to be
desired, especially if it be as melodious a songster as the Orange¬
headed. Bye-the-bye! why “orange-headed,” considering the whole
of the underparts are conspicuously that colour ?
There is a good coloured figure of G. erythronota in Seebohm’s
‘Monograph of the Turdidae ”—Yol. I. It is a pity that naturalists.

The Lady William Cecil,
and travellers cannot manage to write more details of the habits of
birds than they often do. Looking through the Ibis from the years
1859 to 1912, I can only find the Celebean Ground-Thrush little
more than mentioned , some three or four times. Surely, Dr. Meyer,
for instance, could have stated whether he heard this species sing, etc.
since he observed it in more than one place, and on more than one
occasion. It is tiring, to say the least of it, to search through
volume after volume of some periodical, and find for one’s pains—
&amp;apos; G. erythronota ” on the page to which one has been guided, when
the index filled one with hope ! All the more reason for one of our
Members to try to secure this fine Ground-Thrush alive.

It has often been said, and again and again repeated, that
there are very few birds in France, and that nearly all are shot as
game ” by the sportsman who goes out walking with a small
gun charged with small cartridges, and who “ pots ” every “ cock-
sparrow that sits on a twig ! ” Perhaps to some extent this sweep¬
ing statement is true, for certain it is that annually hundreds,
perhaps thousands of small birds are destroyed for mischief, fun, or
sport, by those whose best interest it would be to preserve these
little “ feathered friends,” who feed on the grubs and insects, by
which the crops are so often ruined.”
The well-to-do sportsman stalks his quarry carefully and, I
am told, that it needs considerable skill to shoot even a Bobin
sitting on a branch in a leafy tree ? The small birds are shot sitting
either on a tree or on the ground, very rarely on the wing. The
peasant shoots for food, or anyhow as an addition to his frugal meals.
A man once showed me triumphantly the result of his
day’s sport ; it consisted of two Lesser Whitethroats and a
Sparrow. He was taking them home to be roasted for supper !
One evening we had driven some distance along an unfre¬
quented country road and stopped to rest in the shade of some big

cork trees, and in the brushwood below them a little flock of Golden-
crested Wrens were flitting about from twig to twig, seeking a
resting-place after their long migratory flight. I pointed them out
to our Provengal coachman, and his remark was truly characteristic,
“ Oui, oui, Miladi, ils sont tres gentils et ils sont tr&amp;s bons ‘ k la
broche ’ ? ”
Some few years ago an excellent law was passed in France,
which to some extent protects small birds; so that now, even in
Southern Provence,there is a “close time” for “petit gibier.” Already
there is a marked difference in the larger number of birds found in this
neighbourhood. We also protect our own birds as much as possible
by putting up boards with “chasse gardee ” in all out-of-the-way
places, and we rarely hear a shot fired or meet a bird-catcher on our
land. In this rather lonely neighbourhood there are numbers of
birds to delight us “ with gay plumage and merry song.” Provence
can show many rare and interesting specimens to the bird-lover,
wFo looks about him with seeing eyes.
On the hill-sides, clothed with evergreens and aromatic
shrubs and endless flowers, there is plenty of bird-life. Among the
groves of olives, and in the branches of wide-spreading “ umbrella ”
(stone) pines, and in the vast forests of “ Maritima” and “ Alleppo ”
pines, that cover the Esterels, in the wild summits and rich valleys
of the Maures, where Spanish chestnut and other deciduous trees
grow, and where the cork, the ilex, and the vine flourish, there
birds are also to be found ; by the rocky, ferny banks of little
streams, or by the reed-fringed rivers and in marshy estuaries, indeed
everywhere from the seashore to the far-off Basse Alpes there are
birds. Here in the mountains the Golden Eagle may be seen soaring
far up in the blue sky, and I believe Bonelli’s and the Short-toed
Eagle, and the Booted Eagle may also be found, though I have not
heard of their being identified.
In the shady ravines of the fir-clad Esterels, the big “ Grand
Due ” Owl blinks by day and hunts by night. The peasants say he
can see by daylight quite as well as in the dark. The Wood Owl,
large and fluffy, is occasionally seen, and the knowing looking Long¬
eared Owl builds in old hollow cork trees, or often in some disused
remains of a Magpie’s nest, returning year after year to the same

place. In nearly every pine in the more open country the little
“ Chouette ” (Scops) Owl may be heard calling in high-pitched
voices, “ ay-oo,” “ ay-oo,” to his neighbours. On the hill-side, or
near the cultivated farm-lands, a Hen Harrier; or the rarer Lanner
Falcon circles and swoops, or a Sparrow Hawk hovers and drops on
its unsuspecting prey.
There are literally hundreds of Magpies, who chatter con¬
tinually from March to June, after that, like the good little girls in
the nursery rhyme, they are generally “ seen and not heard.” The
Chouettes too are nearly silent in the summer.
In the mountains, Ravens croak and flap their sable wings
and I have seen Jackdaws at Rocquebrune, but they are rare and I
think only stragglers.
Perhaps the most numerous of all our bird-neighbours in the
spring and early summer are the Nightingales, from sunset to dawn,
and often too in the daytime, they sing, and sing, and sing ; and at
night close to our windows,
“ Philomel with melody,
Sing in our sweet lullaby.”
sometimes so loudly, and so constantly that they keep us awake
while they hold their concerts, and “ one cannot choose but hear ! ”
I think the same pairs often return to their old nesting-places, and
the male bird sings from the same branch to his mate as she sits
snug on her nest in the long grass below. For several years we
knew one Nightingale with a little “ catch ” in his voice, who sang
every evening and most of the night in a tree close to the house,
near the dining-room window. Last year he was there again, and all
April, and for the first two weeks in May he bravely sang &amp;apos;* Jug, jug,
jug ! ” but finished his melody with a tiny squeak, which seemed
more pronounced each day ; aud one morning we found him under
the tree, quite dead ! If one may judge by claws and bill he must
have been a very old bird.
On opening your windows some morning in early April, you
may hear ‘ Hoo, Hoo, Hoo,’ oft repeated, then you know that the
Hoopoes have arrived, and a few minutes walk will take you to the
tree where the first pair invariably rest on their journey from the
South to this district. The Hoopoes stay with us all the summer,
and if warm weather continues, sometimes to the middle of October

They may be seen constantly fluttering among the trees, or strutting
along the terrace walls of vine and olive yards, peeping into every
nook and corner in their inquisitive fussy way.
Among the elms and ilex that border the streams, and in
shady clumps in the plain and lower hillsides, a sweet song and a
flash of orange colour will betray the presence of the Golden Oriole,
who comes early and stays late, often from March to October if the
season is mild. Rather late in the afternoon, in the middle of May,
if you follow the road across the plain from Fregus to Les Arcs, at a
certain bend of the road, where the telegraph wires take a short cut
across a stretch of scanty grass-land, you will find the first flock of
bee-eaters, arrived from Africa for their summer season in Provence,
—a string of exquisite yellow and green jewels do they seem as they
sit on the wire ; or more lovely still as the sunlight catches the
emerald sheen on their backs as they hover and dart at some passing
insect. Various sections of this same wire are popular with the
flycatchers, too ; both the Common and the Pied Flycatchers are
met with in Provence.
Among the low bushes that in places border the field paths
and vineyards, the common Wren is nearly always to be found, I
think all the year round. I have seen them in seasons as far divided
as December, June, and September. The Golden-crested Wrens I
mentioned before are very numerous sometimes in October and again
in the late Spring. They seem to collect here before migration.
I counted as many as twenty-two one afternoon during a short
walk. There are numerous Tits, including some that are rare.
Perhaps the most interesting is the Penduline Tit, or ‘ Mesange de
Narbonne.’ It is a very pretty little bird with a whitish head and
red-brown body, black cheeks and tail and dark brown wings. It
builds the most wonderful nest, a big round ball-like structure, which
it hangs on a branch, something after the manner of the Mocking
Birds. Mesanges are more plentiful in the Rhone Valley than in
this drier district, and I have never found a nest here.
The ‘ Continental ’ Coal Tits are often seen; they differ
rather from the British species, the under parts being more buff all
over, and the two bars on the wings more distinctly white and the
back more slaty blue. The Great Tit and the Blue Tit are here,

too, among the birds common to the South and to Great Britain.
Another sweet little bird is the ‘ Scieur’ (.Provenqal lou Sialla). As¬
he flies he makes a noise just like sawing with a fine saw.
Between Fregus and the peach orchards of the Boson Valley
the Meadow Bunting may be seen, and probably in many similar
localities ; the French call it “ Le Bruant fou ” as it is supposed to
let itself be very easily caught.
The Serin Finch (Le Serin vert de Provence•) is found in most
of the orchards and gardens in the neighbourhood. It is probably a-
resident, though more numerous in the Spring. It begins to sing
quite early in March, and is among the first to build. The nest is a-
neat and cosy little one, and is generally placed in the lower branches
of a large tree, not in bushes or shrubs.
The Citral Finch is found nearer the mountains, and in the
higher hills beyond Bagnols and Fayence ; it is probably a much
rarer bird here than the little Serin.
Several Warblers are both to be seen and heard in the
neighbourhood. &amp;apos; Beccofico ” is a common name given to those who
habitually frequent the gardens and orchards along the coast and
inland as far as the mountains. Among the rarer ones may be found
the Sardinian Warbler, the Olivaceous Warbler and the Spectacled
Warbler ; the large Barred Warbler (Fauvette eperviere ) has also been
noted. The Black Caps and the Chiff Chaffs warble and twitter in
Proven 9 al Gardens as they do in “ Old England.”
Among other rare birds, the Busset Wheatear is found
occasionally in the plain of Fregus. In the meadows and in the
valleys of the Argens, the Pedegal, the Nartoby and Verdon there
are various Wagtails ; among them, the grey, the yellow and the
white Wagtails. In the tall canes and reeds of the marshy parts
of the river beds, the Moustached Sedge Warbler builds, and I
think, in Spring and Summer, the nest of the Great Beed Warbler
would probably be found.
In the oak woods between Draguignan and Moustiers, and
in the Maures Mountains, and other districts where there are
deciduous trees, there are plenty of Blackbirds and Thrushes in
April and May : Goldfinches, Linnets, Greenfinches, and many other
old familiar friends ’ from ‘ Beyond the parting sea,’ visit us here

in Spring and Autumn, on their migrations south and north. The
voice of the Cuckoo is now and then heard, and in the woods ‘ the
Cuckoo’s mate,’ the Wryneck, feeds on the tree insects, with its long
tongue, while sometimes the Great Spotted Woodpecker makes the
forest resound with his hammering. There are Night-Jars too, the
common ‘ Europaeus,’ and also, I believe, the Red-necked Night¬
jar might be found; it has been seen near Marseilles.
Swifts circle and scream round the old tower of the Cathedral
at Fr^gus and many another ancient building in this country-side.
The Swallows come in the Spring time, though I believe some hardy
birds remain here all the winter if it is fairly mild. They build
under our eaves and in the cloister on the north side of the house,
and in the “ Miradou ” (loggia) on the south. They come in and
out quite fearlessly, and smear the cornices in all directions with
building material, before they fix on a suitable spot on which to
fasten the permanent nests of the season. There are Martins, too,
and in the mountain gorges of the Basse Alpes near Castelane, Crag
Swallows are found. It is curious how many pure White Swallows
breed in our neighbourhood ; year after year several nests are re¬
ported, and the young birds as well as the parents are pure white.
This spring (1913) a pair of white Swallows built in the tower at
St. Raphael and hatched out four pure -white nestlings. The ex¬
tremely rare Rufus Swallow has, I believe, been noted in this district.
Another very rare bird, the ‘ Two-barred Crossbill,’ appeared
here only this morning (September 15th). We saw two of them (a
pair ?) in a pine tree close to this house, and were able to observe
them for several minutes before they flew further afield. A few
common Crossbills come every spring and autumn.
Among the brushwood in the hills, and even close to the side
of paths and far up into the Esterels, coveys of Partridges are met
with, and of late years, since ‘ game birds ’ from Golden-crested
Wrens to Golden Eagles, have been more &amp;apos; protected,’ their numbers
have greatly increased; they are very tame, just rising in front of a
pedestrian, and after flying a few yards close to the ground, they
quickly settle again among the bushes. They are also often seen
on the main road, in the hills, ‘ dusting ’ in the roads, or picking
up tiny insects and bits of grit.

Mrs. Katherine Currey,
It is quite impossible to enumerate all the birds in a district
so wide and so varied as this ; bounded as it is on one side by the
sea and level plain, and more distant marsh land, and on the other
by mountains both pine-clad and bare and interspersed by deep
ravines, fertile valleys and grassy uplands. The gulls and other
coast birds might be a study by themselves. They include, among
many others, the ‘ Yellow-legged Mediterranean Gull,’ the Audouin
Gull and the Slender-billed Gull. One of the favourite breeding
places of the latter used to be, and I believe still is, the mouth of
the Khone. In the marshy districts are various duck and also teal,
as well as snipe. Among the rarer waders are the graceful Avocet
and the handsome Purple Heron.
These short notes may perhaps serve to show that the ‘ Fair
land of Provence ’ is not devoid of bird-life, and that any morning
“ When all the birds have Matin said
And sung their Thankful Hymn ’ ’
the bird-lover or field ornithologist may sally forth armed with field-
glass and note-book, and he will surely find much to amuse, to
interest, and may be, to instruct him further in his favourite study.

BREAKFAST GUESTS.
By Katharine Currey.
There are so many instances recorded of the remarkable
tameness of the Tit family, that now that winter has come, I
resolved to put it to the proof by placing ground-nuts and maize and
other ‘ tit-bits ’ on an upstairs window-sill early in the morning, and
waiting to see what would happen.
The Great Tit has always been one of the most frequent of
our winter guests, fearlessly feeding in the verandah off maize, or
dari, or ground-nuts, which he flies off with to some good hammering
point, such as a garden-chair or table or a forked branch, but beyond
the verandah and into the house he has never ventured. The wee
‘ Blue Bonnet ’ flashes up on to the winter supply of lard and bones
on the bird-pole, but neither he nor the Cole Tit have ever trusted
themselves long in the verandah.

To return to the window-sill. On the first morning, when
I put out the nuts and waited to see what would happen, the Great
Tit appeared on an ilex tree opposite and looked and called “Weetle !
weetle !’ There lay the ground-nuts and nobody in sight. But it
might be a trap set by the Human Giant, whose hand he saw place
them there. But oh! those ground-nuts ! After a bit, he made a dart,
towards the window-sill, seized one, and whisked off with it into the
ilex, where he fixed it into the fork of a branch and began to hammer.
More nuts lay on the sill, and after a few minntes spent in devouring
the first nut, he again ventured, repeating the same performance.
Again and again he came, flying away across the garden with some,,
to, I presume, a winter storehouse, but he managed to eat several.
After a week, he came regularly at 6.30 for his breakfast, and brought
his mate, who is more shy, ringing his little bell of two or three-
consecutive notes, in reality untranslatable into human language,,
but which I can only render by the words “Pingle ! Pingle! ” I have
noticed that he has three call-notes : “Weetle ! weetle ! ” “ Weetle !&amp;apos;
weetle! wee!” And if he wants anything, “Pingle! Pingle!”
These sounds are of course very roughly translated. Sometimes
the “ Weetle ! Weetle ! ” changes to “ Weet! Weet!” The clearness
of sound I could only liken to a tiny bell. If his breakfast was not
there, he fluttered before the window and called for it but he never
calls when on the wing. Needless to say his summons was at once
obeyed ! If hazel nuts are cracked for him, a Kobin purloins them.
Now, after nearly a month, the Great Tit waits on the ilex tree-
regularly for the window to be opened, and even flies towards an
outstretched hand with a ground nut on it, but has not yet ventured
on to it. After hovering near it, he flies away again. I often wonder
at the boldness of a tiny bird. What an amount of courage is
required to approach a being whose ear, say, is about the size of
one’s whole person !
Day by day we advance further in our friendship with our
lovely little breakfast guest, but he never fails to come at a call or
whistle. If he sees no nuts in the original window, he flies to the
next, and hovers before it to attract attention, and so on to a third
window. He comes after me now in the verandah.

INDIAN PIGEONS AND DOVES. *

Mr. Stuart Baker has written exhaustively and interestingly
in this companion volume to his work on “ Indian Ducks,” neither
need he apologize for “ the egoism in the whole programme.” When
a work is produced, we want just that; the experiences, the views,
the personal observances of the writer, rather than quotations from
books already published.
And Mr. Stuart Baker has been a close observer of a beautiful
family of birds ; a good example of this being found in the chapter
on the Bengal Green Pigeon, where the description of how he
listened in silence to these birds’ soft mellow calls amongst some
Mango trees will appeal to aviculturists, more than to the graphic
account of shooting them, fun though it may be for those who take
pleasure therein ! to my mind a very selfish one !
There may be no danger of these Indian Pigeons, etc., going
the way of the late Passenger Pigeon of the United States, but
nevertheless the insatiable love of killing for mere enjoyment finds
no sympathetic chord in one’s heart. There is too much killing :
with men, for the sport of it, with women, for the wearing of it.
“ I have seen parties bring in over two hundred birds,” Mr. Stuart
Baker writes in a chapter on the “beautiful little” Pink-necked
Green Pigeon. This sort of thing may be considered “ sport,” but
it may also be written down as slaughter, and even butchery!
It was Professor Osborn who himself told the writer of this
critique that when a young man he visited a certain part of Canada,
and found it teeming with every possible kind of game ; he some
years afterwards, with the wonderful picture of wild life still clearly
in his mind’s eye, took members of his family to see, promising
them something worth looking at. They arrived : the place was a
wilderness! Man had stepped in and had shot down everything.
“ From that moment,” Professor Osborn said, “I who had delighted
“in shooting, put away gun and rifle, and vowed never to use them
“ again.”

The aviculturist will find Mr. Stuart Baker’s book full of
information, and will learn much of what has been hitherto vague.
Enhanced as it is by fine coloured plates, the book is worthy of a
place on the bookshelves of the ornithologist’s and aviculturist’s
library.
Some of the plates are a little wooden, but several are ex¬
cellent, notably that of the Bronze-winged or Emerald Dove (why
not green -winged bye-the-bye ?) the Snow-Pigeon and the Barred
Ground Dove. Others are very good too, but not so artistic.

On the moat which surrounds the house, Mr. Astley has a pair of Black¬
necked Swans, ten Tufted Duck, four White-eyed Pochard, a pair of Red-Crested
Pochard, some Shelduck, and Brown Call-Ducks. These are all becoming quite
tame, and can come on the water so close to the house that bread can be thrown
out of the windows to them. The moat is fed by a small stream of running
water, and several springs, so that it is clean and clear.
Mr. Astley hopes to obtain some Smew before long, as there are quantities
of small dace for them to feed upon.
The melodious whistling of the Black-necked Swans at night, under the
windows, adds to the charm of the 14th Century house.
All Mr. Astley’s other Ducks are in a large paddock, in which there are
springs, so that a series of small ponds have been formed.
Here there are about 80 ducks, including such species as Cinnamon,
Falcated, Ringed, and Japanese Teal; Red-billed Tree Ducks; etc., etc.

An addition to Mr. Astley’s collection of birds, is a pair of handsome little
Senegal Bustards (Trachelotis senegalensis) which is about the size of a pheasant.
The male has the head marked not at all unlike that of a male Ringed Teal,
with the same creamy face, black crown and ring coming down round the neck.
The body is a bright sandy chestnut, and on the throat and upper breast there
is a patch of rich grey. The female is lighter, and whilst her eyes are pale
yellow, her mate’s are dark brown. These birds are not at all shy.
* *
Two scarlet Flamingoes, from Mexico, are another addition. They are
brilliant shrimp-red: boiled shrimp, that is to say !

SIR,—I have read Mr. Job’s article under this heading with the greatest
interest, and I feel sure that all lovers of Waterfowl will join with me in heartily
congratulating him on his success in what appears to have been “new ground ”
to him altogether. It is a great pity that he did not succeed with Scoters and

Ruddy Ducks, for I feel sure it must be possible to rear them, since Mr. St.
Quinton has succeeded with Eiders and a Harlequin, perhaps he would be good
enough to make a few suggestions for Mr. Job to try on a future occasion.
Personally I think he would stand a better chance if it were possible for him to
use hens instead of incubators. I have found it perfectly hopeless to try forcing
food down duckling’s throats, they invariably throw it up. I believe if Mr. Job
could manage to use a few hens and enclose a little pool of water and feed the
ducklings with flies (which could be caught very easily in a butterfly net and
quashed and sprinkled on the water) as well as prepared meal, etc., the hen
might show them the way to feed. I should also recommend him to try chopped
worms and maggots. I cannot see that Mr. Job used maggots at all, these could
surely be easily procured, and I have always found them the finest food possible
for ducklings, they wriggle and sometimes tempt ducklings who have previously
showed no inclination to feed. Mr. Job seems surprised that Canvasbacks and
Redheads should do well ; they are both nearly related, I understand, to the
Common Pochard, which in my experience is about the easiest of all ducklings
to rear, although usually very shy. Mr. Job will find the Cinnamon Teal quite
as easy to rear as the Blue-winged Teal ; both these are great maggot fanciers.
I cannot understand Mr. Job’s statement that the young of “ Gadwall and
Baldpate are identical.” In this country young Gadwalls and American Wigeon
are no more alike than Pintail and Mallard, and I cannot believe that young
Baldpates in America can differ greatly from young Baldpates bred in this
country from stock originally imported from America, and it seems likely that
the young of American and British Gadwall will be the same.
I fully endorse Mr. Job’s remarks re the difficulty of persuading various
ducklings of different ages to live amicably, and he was lucky in that he did not
lose more from this cause.
With regard to transporting fresh ducks’ eggs, I do not think that the one
clutch of eggs experimented with is sufficient evidence, one can get no proof that
they were fertile to start with ! though I acknowledge that it is extremely rare to
take a nest of wild bred ducks’ eggs which are not fertile, although I have done
so on more than one occasion, but surely if eggs can travel from Iceland to
England and hatch they should be able to stand the journey which those Mr.
Job mentions were subjected to, I am not sure that his eggs did not suffer from
too much care ! I think if the eggs were packed carefully in wood-wool and then
left to take care of themselves, the jolting of the cars would do all the turning
necessary. At the same time, I know that duck eggs, for some obscure reason
will not travel so well as other eggs — Pheasants, for instance —which I have sent
to Russia from Norfolk, and they have hatched out 76 per cent. ; these were
packed in wood-wool (which must be absolutely dry) in baskets of 300, the baskets
were then packed in a large wooden crate and the spaces between the baskets
being carefully stuffed up with straw, the lid of the crate was then screwed down
the crates started on their journey to Russia ; these eggs were certainly never
turned on the journey ! H. WORMALD.

By Miss R. Alderson.
There are two varieties of the Green-winged Dove that are
commonly kept in captivity. That, figured in the plate, known as
the Australian Green-winged Dove (Chctlcophaps chrysochlora ) and
another, known as the Indian Green-wing (Chalcophaps indica).
To most bird-dealers, and indeed to many other owners of the birds,
the two kinds are hardly distinguishable, and go by the general
title of Green-wing.
The price of these doves is usually about 7/6 a pair, never
less and often more. Dr. Greene in “ Notes on Cage Birds,” pub¬
lished in 1899, quotes the price for the&amp;apos;Australian variety at 30/- to
40/- a pair, though in 1900 I paid 18/6 for four birds, but which
variety these latter were I cannot remember. I noted at the time
that the average price then was 12/6 a pair. The Green-wing is a
dove that cannot always be had when wanted, for it does not seem
to be imported regularly all the year round, though the Indian
variety especially, seems common enough in its native country, but
even there it is not often seen offered for sale.
The Green-wing seems a very long-lived bird. One of my
four original birds only died last year, thirteen years since I bought
him as an adult bird, and Dr. Butler mentions one (the Australian
variety) that he kept for over twelve years.
I have found the Green-wing a very hardy dove, though, as
there is an exception to every rule, I have twice nearly lost birds
through collapse from cold. In both cases the birds recovered after

help had been given them, though they were almost unconscious
when found. One bird was a young hen, not long out of the nest,
and though she is now quite healthy and strong I shall always think
the shock checked her growth, for she is undersized and habitually
droops her wings. The other bird affected was one of my original
four. I found him laid on the ground and moaning, but warmth
and a little weak brandy and water brought him round, though for a
day he would eat nothing.
I have noticed this cry of distress, when ill or frightened, in
one other dove, the Aurita, who really cries before it is hurt. If
you only catch the bird it begins to make a sobbing cry, most
distressing to hear. Most doves, and I think other birds too, suffer
pain in complete silence. I shall never forget a little Dwarf Turtle
that had injured itself most terribly on the head, and though the
dressing I put on must have smarted very badly, the bird never
uttered a sound, but kept quite still in my hand during the operation.
I find the Green-winged Dove is a general favourite whenever
any visitors—those especially who know nothing about birds—come
to see my aviary. I have got quite used to hearing “ Oh ! what are
those green ones—that one with the red beak ? ” Just as it is always
said of my Bleeding Heart Pigeon that it really looks as if it was
wounded ; indeed on one occasion a visitor took the “ heart ” quite
seriously and thought some tragedy had happened.
The Indian Green-wing was first kept at the Zoo in 1856 and
the Australian five years later. Both varieties were bred by Mr.
Seth-Smith some years ago. Dr. Euss bred the Indian freely in his
bird-room. In Dr. Greene’s “ Notes on Cage Birds ” there is a most
interesting account of the nesting of the Indian Green-wing in Wales
in an unheated aviary. This pair had five young birds during the
season, and three were reared, the other two died through falling out
of the nest. Some of the winters these birds passed through were
very cold, especially in 1881 when the thermometer went down to
three degrees below zero.
The Green-wing is an easy dove to keep. I have read of
some being fed on maize, some on Canary seed and millet, others on
hemp, and in each case the birds seemed to thrive and do well. My
own birds have a choice of about six seeds—as there are other

inmates in the aviary to consider—and they always seem to keep in
good health. It is one of the great advantages of doves, they are so
easy to provide for.
Dr. Butler tells us how an hen Green-wing that he had, picked
up a worm and shook it to pieces, eating it all, and in a wild state
these doves are said to be very fond of white ants. They are also
very partial to wild strawberries, and in a lesser degree raspberries
and blackberries.
I had long&amp;apos; wanted to breed the Green-wing, but never suc¬
ceeded in doing so till the year before last. The eggs, two in number,
are very dark in colour, almost buff. My birds sat exceptionally
well and the young when hatched I found to be the most curious
baby doves I had ever seen, with blackish skins. Many eggs were
laid and most of them hatched, but whether the young doves were
more restless in the nest than most of their tribe I do not know, but
several were lost through straying to the nest side and getting caught
in the nesting material or branches, and dying before they could be
found or rescued. x\t the end of the season I had only reared three,
they turned out to be two cocks and one hen.
The young Green-wings were very pretty when fully feathered,
the feathers dark blackish brown with lighter brown markings and
iust a few bright green feathers—as if one had dropped a spot of
metallic paint—on the back and wings. They were not at all timid
and allowed themselves to be photographed at very close quarters.
In “ Indian Doves and Pigeons ” it is recorded that in a wild
state the Green-wings’ eggs have been found at an elevation of over
4000 feet, though this height is exceptional. The nest is generally
well concealed, and more substantial than that of most doves. It is
composed both of dead twigs and live ones plucked from the tree.
The nests are mostly built in bushes at a distance of about five feet
from the ground. The favourite breeding season is from January to
May, according to the different locality; there are generally two
broods, sometimes three. In the case of my own birds in captivity
I found that, having once started, they would go on having nest
after nest all through the summer, and had we been more fortunate
I ought to have had quite a small flock of young birds.

On Green-winged Doves.
It is a good plan to always provide a lump of rock salt
(placed in a glazed pot to keep it clean) in every aviary. The cost is
very slight and the salt is a valuable addition to the birds’ ordinary
diet to help to keep them&amp;apos; in good health.
In India, the Green-wing much frequents the “ salt-licks,”
and so well known is this fact that it has become a saying that “ the
elephant and deer like salt-licks, buffalo and gour must resort to
them at times, but that the Emerald Dove (as the Green-wing is
sometimes called in India) dies if it is kept from them more than a
day.”
The Green-wing in its wild state is often seen in pairs or
singly, though sometimes a flock of about six may be seen together,
the flight is very strong.
To anyone starting to keep doves, or adding a few of the
brighter-coloured ones to a mixed collection of birds, either variety
of Green-wing Dove will prove a very attractive addition. As a rule
they are good-tempered compared to many doves, though occasion¬
ally one will have a sudden outbreak of spitefulness, but this fault is
shared by many other birds besides the Green-wings. Sometimes
indeed I have known these doves form strange attachments. I have
a very pleasant remembrance of a little Long-tailed Tit that used to
nestle most lovingly against his big friend, one of the Green-wings ;
and again where a small Diamond Dove and a Green-wing were
close companions.
I have lost my old Green-wing hen, and do not expect ever
to replace her, she was such a good nesting bird, but I have hopes
of again rearing some young ones, for my young hen laid eggs and
sat well last season. Unfortunately she was disturbed by another
bird, but this year, under quieter surroundings, she may do better..

Some few months ago a number of living Conures were
•distributed in this country under the name of Gonurus gundlachi,
and were said to have come from Mona Island. Upon examining
three of these Conures I at once saw that they had nothing to do
with Gonurus gundlachi, whose proper name is Gonurus maugei,
(De Souance) and whose home WAS Porto Rico, but the bird is now
quite extinct.
On comparing the birds with Gonurus chloropterus of St.
Domingo it was at once evident that, though they agreed absolutely
in colour, they were much smaller; in fact they agree perfectly with
Gonurus euops of Cuba, except that the bill is larger, being half-way
between the bill of G. euops and G. chloropterus in size. On ques¬
tioning the vendor as to the real origin of these birds, I was
informed they had been shipped from South America with other
South American live stock, and having believed them to be in fact
G. gundlachi, he assigned them as having come from Mona Island,
the supposed home of G. gundlachi. The fact is that it is highly
doubtful where the two wings, which form the Type of G. gundlachi,
came from. Gundlach, was however on Porto Rico, and these
wings really belong to the extinct Porto Rico Gonurus maugei.
It is evident, therefore, that the living birds are a new race
of the G. euops group from an unknown South American locality.
The Mona Island bird, according to Dr. A. Wetmore, of Washington,
is hardly if at all distinct from G. chloropterus, but as only one
specimen could be procured on the island it might have been an
escaped cage bird of the St. Domingo race.

Spilorms cheela.
By E. C. Stuart Baker.
In the last article I had the pleasure of writing for our
magazine, I gave an account of one of the smallest but at the same
time fiercest of our Indian raptores ; in the present article I deal
with one of the largest and at the same time most easily tamed of
the same family.
The two birds whose life with me I am about to describe
were brought to me as nestlings ; yellowish-white fluffy youngsters
with pale yellow eyes, pale lead-coloured feet and bill and a gape,
which gaped continually for food, matching the eyes in colour.
For a day or two after they were taken from the nest they
displayed all the ferocity of their kind and though they readily
accepted food, struck savagely at the hand which gave it, not with
their bills as one would have expected, but with their feet. Very
shortly, however, they became quite reconciled to me and from
thenceforward I had no further difficulty with them ; they soon
began to recognise me when I approached their basket with food,
and hailed each visit with loud and harsh squawks of welcome.
Their usual attitude in the basket, which took the place of their
nest, was squatting well back on their haunches, a position which
made them look as if they were on the point of falling backward.
In this posture they always received their food and when they first
came, struck out with one leg without losing their balance. When
replete, however, they lay down full length with their heads and
necks stretched out in front of them, their legs either both tucked
under their bodies or one stuck out and grasping one of the small
branches with which the basket w^as lined. In this position they
lay asleep or dozing hut it was a light foot which could approach
within five yards of them without putting them on the qui vive.
They grew with extraordinary rapidity and within a month of coming
into my possession were almost fully fledged, though it was more
than another month before the quills of their wings and tails had
attained their full size.

They were never confined in any cage or aviary, having the
most absolute freedom in every way, but after they were big enough
to get about by themselves they selected a perch in my fowl house
where they nightly roosted in perfect amity with a large assortment of
fowls, guinea-fowls, ducks, etc. In a state of nature, these beautiful
eagles roost at night on very lofty trees, almost invariably selecting
one which has very dense foliage amongst which they sit and, not as
some other eagles do, on a lofty bare branch. My birds, however,
although there was not the slightest restriction placed upon them,
never showed any inclination to roost on high trees and when as
occasionally happened in my absence, they were shut out of the fowl
house, they roosted on one of the lower boughs of some pine trees
in my garden.
They took a remakably long time to learn to feed themselves
and before they had got as far as picking up their food from the
ground were in the habit of snatching it from one another. This the
female bird, who was very much larger than the male, soon ceased to
tolerate, so that the male eagle then began to hunt around for and
pick up scraps of meat for himself, after which fired with his example,
the female also began to feed herself. It was weeks, however, before
they relinquished all idea of being fed, and whenever food was
brought them they would throw themselves back on their haunches
and demand to have it given them with all the energy and noise
they had displayed as babies.
They were, I think, quite the most tame birds I have ever
kept, and their kindly confiding ways were not displayed towards me
alone but equally so to the large circle of pets which at that time
shared my menage. Amongst other animals were four bears, three
of whom were most estimable characters, but the fourth was quite
the reverse and the two eagles soon learnt that whilst they could
take any liberties they liked with the former it was advisable to give
the latter a wide berth. For a short time the bad-tempered bear made
life very hard for them, for although these eagles in a state of nature
seldom visit the ground, these particular birds were very fond of
walking about both in the verandah and also in the garden round
about the house. This procedure the bear resented for some reason
best known to himself and he was constantly making rushes at them,

Mr. E. C. Stuart Baker,
uttering hideous noises as he did so, most unsettling to the birds.
It was with a sigh of content, I think, that they eventually saw him
led away by some Nagas to form the piece de resistance at one of
their wedding feasts. With the other bears they were on very
friendly terms and had regular games ; the bears, like all other
young bears, used to have wrestling matches, two of them wrestling
whilst the third did referee and also sometimes at critical moments
rushed into the arena and bowled over both the contestants. The
eagles took an intense interest in these matches, and when as often
happened, the wrestlers suddenly stopped the match and rushed
headlong upon the birds, they merely hopped up into the air over
their heads and waited for the next round. My tame deer never
really liked the eagles though they tolerated their presence, but the
dogs, cats, and monkeys were all on good terms with them and their
special favourites amongst these were a beautiful greyhound and
a large civet cat.
It was possibly because they had so many four-footed friends
that these eagles spent so much time on the ground, but it certainly
was a very curious sight to see these two birds following me round
the compound on foot with the rest of my pets, only taking to wing
when they had fallen too far behind and had to catch us up again.
Sometimes when the stag beetles had been playing such havoc with
my orange trees that it was necessary to take determined action
against them the two eagles would accompany me round as I went
from tree to tree cutting out the fat larvae from the boles and larger
branches. Whilst the extraction was going on they would stand one
on either side of me watching the proceedings with the most intense
interest, getting frightfully excited when the tempting morsel came at
last into sight. Their bushy crests were then erected to the full and
they danced from one foot to another uttering harsh cries until one
bird was given the grub when both subsided again with quiet
expectation until the next lucious mouthful appeared.
They never uttered their wild shrill calls except when soaring
in the air, high up and often out of sight or, very rarely, when
perched on the summit of a huge Bombax Tree which grew beside
my garden. Sometimes very early in the morning when they were
fastened up in the fowl-house they began their cry but it was always

cut short in the middle. Later on when I had made an opening for
them just under the roof, they got out of the fowl-house through
this and I never again heard them call inside the house. They were
very early retiring birds and were generally on their perch in the
fowl-house before the fowls themselves went in to roost and after
the window had been made for them they were always out first
also and would soar up to great heights to greet the morning sun,
. welcoming the first rays with their shrill notes. This call can
be heard from an immense distance and I nearly always knew of the
advent of my eagles, first by ear and afterwards by eye. When I
had been away from home out in camp and was returning, the two
birds would often spot me as they soared overhead, although they
were quite invisible to me, and would come to meet me when I was
within some three or four miles of the house. They would occa¬
sionally come right down, and more than once actually settled on
my shoulder, but as a rule they came to the roadside and perched on
some tree, from which they would take short flights from one tree
to another as they followed me on my route home.
I was often away from home for weeks at a time, but it
seemed to make no difference to the eagles, and they always re¬
sumed relations exactly where we had left off. Curiously enough,
when I went away from home they never accompanied me, though
they so often met me on my return, and probably they ranged over
a very restricted area for such powerful winged birds. I do not
think I ever met them five miles from the house, so that a diameter
of ten miles would have probably covered their special extent of
country.
About the same area would also seem to form the hunting
ground of wild pairs, and in many instances it is possibly much
smaller even than this. In North Cachar, and indeed all over
Assam, these eagles are extraordinarily numerous, and it would be
impossible to take a walk of 20 miles in any direction in well-wooded
country without seeing one or more pairs. In spite of this, however,
its nest is one of the hardest eagle’s nests to find that I know of,
and even when found it seems to he nearly always empty. The
reason for this is probably that the birds do not lay season after

Mr. E. C. Stuart Baker ;
season in the same nest like most eagles do, and also because their
laying season extends over several months, i.e. March to August.
With most eagles, once having found a nest, you have a
certain yearly take of eggs, as long as you leave the second laying
to the birds, but with the Serpent Eagles this does not hold good.
My own birds never attempted to nest, and it is just possible that
the larger eagles, whilst certainly taking two years, may even take
three before they commence breeding.
I do not know w T hat became of my eagles eventually, but
believe when I left North Cachar for good they were still alive and
well, being then about twelve years old. After I had had them for
some three years I was transferred on special duty for five months,
and though the birds came into my compound and slept nightly in
the fowl-house, they were certainly more like wild birds on my
return than when I had left them, though they were just as friendly
with me personally. Then long furlough home followed close upon
this shorter absence, and when the man who acted for me inhos¬
pitably closed the fowl-house door upon them, the eagles appeared
to be disheartened and took to the jungles entirely. They did not
however desert the neighbourhood, and when eventually in 1900 1
was transferred from North Cachar to another district in Assam, a
pair of these fine eagles still haunted my old home in Gungoug,
which pair the Nagas declared were my former tame birds.
The Genus Spilornis is one which is very well represented in
India, there being at least three species, and yet other sub-species
to be found within its limits. These are as follows: —
Spilornis cheela cheela, the largest form found in India
proper, ranging throughout Central India, extending well into the
West and North West, and again throughout Southern India
both in the West and East.
In the North East of India and thence into Burmah, Yunnan,
Northern Shan States etc., its place is taken by Rutherford’s
Serpent Eagle ( Spilornis cheela rutherfordi ) distinguished by its
smaller size and more barred under plumage.
Smaller races yet again in davisoni and pallidus are found far
South in the Malay Peninsular and Archipelago, whilst in Southern
India, breeding in a part of the same area as that occupied by the

Crested Serpent Eagle, is to be found a much smaller bird known as
albidus, to which must be given the rank of a species.
In the Andamans, yet another species is found, the Andaman
Serpent Eagle (S&amp;apos;, elgini elgini), whose place is taken in the Nicobars
by a very closely allied form S. elgini minimus , a very small bird,
with a wing of only 11—12 inches or about two-thirds the size of
the big Indian bird.
The Crested Serpent Eagles are amongst the most handsome
of the Kaptores ; the plumage itself is very handsomely barred and
spotted, and all the species are provided with a magnificent erectile
crest of black and white feathers which is very thick and full.
The eyes are a brilliant golden yellow and the cere and gape are
also a bright lemon yellow ; these colours against the dark plumage
having a very striking effect.
As its trivial name shows, this bird in a state of nature is
very largely a snake-eater, and every individual must destroy yearly
hundreds of these reptiles. Its mode of attack appears to be to
descend on the ground, sometimes striking at and disabling its
quarry as it descends, but more often knocking the snake down
with its wings after it has settled, and the snake erects itself to
attack. I once came on an eagle attacking a large cobra which it
was buffetting furiously with its wings. I did not see the commence¬
ment of the attack, and the grass in which it was carried on
prevented a very good view of what was happening, but the only
weapon used by the bird, as far as could be seen, were the wings,
still when I examined the snake I found its head and neck had been
badly torn, so that probably the eagle had struck with its talons as
well. They will occasionally stoop at jungle fowl, pheasants, and
partridge, but they do not seem to be very successful at such quarry,
and after snakes, lizards, frogs and small water birds would appear
to form their principal diet.
They are bold birds, but vary very much in temperament
individually, and whilst some will defend their nest, eggs or young
with the greatest bravery, others will flop away from their nests
when these latter are rifled without any attempt to resent the
robbery.

By Hubert D. Astley.
The Golden-eye is one of the most handsome of British
Ducks. Like the Scaup, it is only a winter visitor, but frequents
inland waters as well as the coast, whilst the Scaup prefers the
latter. On the Continent the Golden-eye breeds as far South as
Germany, Switzerland, and Bohemia.
It is curious that the adult males are so seldom seen in
England. As to whether this species has ever bred in Scotland,
seems to be doubtful, but Mr. A. G. More stated that a pair nested
in the hollow of an old larch tree at Loch Assyn—that is talking of
about 50 years ago—and that the nest with the young birds was
found by a shepherd. In Shetland also, a female with young
ones has been seen.
In Finland, Sweden, and Norway, it nests not infrequently in
boxes hung up in trees by the peasants.
The display of the males is worth seeing, the feathers of the
cheeks and crest being erected so as to enlarge the appearance of the
head; then the birds spring forwards, elevating the breast, after
which the neck is stretched out, and the bill pointing upwards is
opened, a rasping note being emitted. The head is then quickly
jerked back until it almost touches the root of the tail, and as
quickly brought to its normal position, whilst the bird springs for¬
ward, kicking the water in a spurt, and displaying the orange legs.
It is said that one male Golden-eye will drive away another
by diving and attacking his rival beneath the water. This sounds
effective, after the manner of a submarine.
I kept a pair of Golden-eye for some years on a lake (at
Benham Valence), in which was an island, with plenty of hollow
logs lying about beneath the trees. I was assured by the keeper
who fed the ducks that the female Golden-eye had laid four eggs in
one of these logs, and had been seen coming out; but I was away
at the time, and unable to verify the statement. If males were
pinioned, and females turned down with cut flights, one would think
that on growing them afresh, they ought to remain with their mates

and nest in hollow logs placed among neighbouring trees, overhang¬

parents were, I imagine, pinioned ; hut the female did not hatch her
own eggs, after having laid them in two boxes placed on poles in the
water, [c.f. Avic. Mag., Yol. VII., p. 37].
The Golden-eyes are splendid divers, and the male with his
head of glossy dark green, his bright yellow eye, black and white
plumage and orange legs and feet is a conspicuous bird in a collection
of ducks.

THE BRITISH SHELDUCK.
Tadorna cornuta.
If these birds were imported from some far-off part of the
world for the first time, duck fanciers would tumble over each other
to obtain them, for there is no duck more strikingly handsome.
Moreover they become exceedingly tame, but are inclined to be very
bullying.
The male is easily distinguished from the female, being a good
size larger, and his colouring more brilliantly and definitely defined.
The crimson knob too of the male (especially in the spring time)
is very much larger and more vivid in colouring.
As with other ducks, and geese too, the voices of the sexes
differ, the female Shelduck emits a distinct ‘ quack,’ as well as a sort
of bark, whilst the drake’s notes are more whistling, and in the
breeding season they take the form of a clear rapidly-repeated trill.
Shelducks are known as Burrow Ducks, from their almost
invariable habit of nesting in burrows near the sea ; although they
do sometimes lay their eggs under bushes, and amongst bracken, if
the coast is too rocky and shingly for them to burrow. They will
also resort to rabbit-warrens which are not far from the sea.
On Wolferton Heath in Norfolk, the old birds will pass
through the village street with their young ones en route for the
sea-coast, where several broods collect together. Shelduck take two,
if not three years to fully mature.
They are not naturally divers, but can do so when playing on
the water, or in the event of escaping from a Peregrine.

A NOTE ON SEXING BLACK-CHEEKED
LOVE-BIRDS.
By Dr. L. Lovell-Keays.
I thought perhaps the following notes might be of interest to
readers of the Avicultural Magazine, as showing the great difficulty
in sexing these beautiful little parrots.
I had two pairs of these birds: one in an outdoor quite
unprotected aviary, and the other, a more recent addition, in my
new covered shelter flight. The former I got from Mr. Fockelmann
in June, 1913, and they very soon went to nest. The birds were
as like as two peas, but the cock (?) was a shade larger and the beak
a little fuller. I could detect little or no difference in colouration
or the size of the white circumorbital ring. The first clutch of eggs
proved infertile, and I came to the conclusion I had two hens.
However, no sooner had I come to this conclusion and advertised
for a cock than to my joy I found them pairing one day. This was
the first occasion I had noticed any amativeness on the part of
either bird. However, I had noticed that only one bird carried
nesting material, and the whole time this bird sat, the other (which
of course subsequently proved to be the cock) took no notice of his
persevering wife. The hen bird carried nesting material in her beak.
My Madagascar Love-birds appeared to carry nesting material under
the wing and tucked very closely in the rump feathers.
For weeks nothing happened with the second clutch, and as
later the hen left the nest fairly frequently I took the nesting barrel
down, but could see no sign of life, nor did I ever hear young birds.
However, the hen bird so frequently visited the shelter that I felt
convinced there was something there, and later on I again took the
nesting barrel down and saw three young birds fully fledged.
Whether the cock fed the young I cannot say; the two birds
are so exactly alike that no casual observer could tell them apart,
and it is only when sitting next each other I can tell them even

to-day. At the time when I still doubted that I had a true pair, I
bespoke a pair from Mr. Frost. They duly came to hand last
November and I noticed one had a slight bald patch on the head,
quite slight and over one eye. That bird was by far the larger
bird. The circumorbital rings were noticeably larger and the beak
fuller and larger and the colour rather brighter than in the smaller
bird. To sex these birds was easy. Eggs had already been laid
before they came to me, and on turning them into a small aviary
w T ith a pair of Guiana Love-birds and other species they quickly settled
down and went to nest. But alas ! one morning, on going to feed the
birds, I found the “ cock ” bird in one corner with the crown of the
head bleeding and featherless. As I had frequently detected the
Guianas fighting with the Black-cheeks the case seemed clear. I
caught the “ cock ” up easily enough. The hen was sitting in the
barrel, incubating. In trying to catch her she escaped and I detected
three eggs. However, she did not return to the nest, so I caught
her up and caged the two together, having first given the wounded
bird a good roasting, the sovereign remedy, as Lord Tavistock points
out, for all sick birds. In two or three days an egg was laid, and
In a couple of days after that I turned the birds into another aviary
with a covered inner flight. They quickly settled down again and the
hen bird was very busy carrying nesting material and spent much
time in the outer flight when the birds were let out. I thought it odd
the cock bird did not appear more often, but put it down to timidity
and to the fact that it had been almost scalped. But he often did
appear and even carried nesting material at times. Things went
well for quite a while, but on December 29th I went to look at my
birds at night and found the cock bird with his scalp quite raw
again, evidently from recent injury and as dead as a door nail.
I was perplexed. On picking it up and examining it, I found to
my utter astonishment the bird was no cock but a hen, and died
from egg-binding. There had been a sudden cold snap and no doubt
that caused it. My theory is that the pain caused the bird to rub
its head on the roof of the nesting barrel or against a tree trunk and
was not caused by another bird at all, as the scalp wound did not
appear to be caused by another parrakeet’s beak. If I had only
searched more carefully night and morning, before it was too late,

Mr. P. F. M. Galloway,
I might have found the bird alive, roasted it up again, and if it had
laid an egg my experience would have been bought without losing
my bird. I must say that this is the greatest surprise in aviculture
I have yet experienced, and treproach myself bitterly for not having
diagnosed the cause of the first illness, and I write this note in the
hope that it may save somebody else from falling into so blame¬
worthy an oversight as to omit to thoroughly examine a sick bird
no matter how apparent the malady or injury. I may add that I
have no doubt that the birds were a true pair and both were adult
birds.
THE GRASSHOPPER WARBLER.
Locustella noevia.
By P. F. M. Galloway.
This species is always a scarce one, and has been so ever
since I can remember. It is certainly not through the egg collector,
for the nest is one of, if not the most difficult to finch I have only
found the nest of this species once, and if it had not been that I saw
what I took to be a mouse run along the ground from my foot,
which I found was almost on top of the nest of eggs, I do not-
suppose for a moment that I should have found it then. I am
certain that the reason why this bird is rather scarce is through the
nest being right on the ground, the eggs and young are destroyed
by mice and other vermin.
When this bird first arrives, which is generally about the
10th of April, it may be found in very unusual situations. I have
seen it in a thin piece of hedgerow beside a main road, close to
Caversham, Oxon., where people were passing to and fro at short
intervals, and I got within almost arms length of him, so near that I
could plainly see his throat moving whilst he was reeling loudly.
During the severe snowstorm, on the 25th of April, about
four years ago, I saw one come out of a tuft of grass on a bank and
flutter across the snow on the road and go down into a garden on
the opposite side, in fact it practically tumbled down into the garden,
for it was numbed with cold and half-starved, and I should doubt if
it lived through the night.

These birds soon find their way to a common of furze and
heather, or to a reed or sedge bed by the river ; these seem to be the
favourite haunts of this species.
I have seen it stated in books, when writing&amp;apos; of the Grass¬
hopper Warbler, that this bird is so shy that it is impossible to get
a glimpse of it, and that it will even run out to the end 6f a bough,
deliver its song and return to its cover at once; all I can say is
that the habits of these birds have wonderfully altered since these
books were written. If one knows the habits of the bird and is
careful to step quietly, one can come right up to within a few
yards of it and watch it, but anything like snapping of sticks or
brushwood under the feet and the bird will turn and run down a
stick to the undergrowth below the bush just like a mouse, and
after a short time, if all is quiet, will work its way up to the same
place and almost on to the same twig and commence reeling again.
I have had these birds run almost over my feet. I once stood on a
common about sunset, quite close to where the bird was, and two
of them came running after each other round and round me, my
foot was not more than three inches off the rabbit run which these
birds were using and I bent down and watched them pass my foot,
round they would go behind me and then run past my foot again and
again, taking not the slightest notice of me and reeling loudly all
the time and carrying their wings up over their back, after the
fashion of a Plover when first alighting on the ground. They were
evidently two male birds.
From the time this species arrives, and up to about the end
of the first week in May, it can be heard at intervals throughout
the day, but after this time not a sound can be heard all day until
after sunset, and often not until nearly nine o’clock at night and
again just at sunrise.
The note is very difficult to imitate ; the noise made by a
new free wheel of a bicycle does not quite do it, the nearest approach
to it is to pull out evenly and continually the fishing line attached
to a check reel on a fishing rod.
The Grasshopper Warbler in captivity soon becomes very
tame. The gait of this bird is unlike any other small insectivorous
bird, it can run fairly fast, seldom hops, and when walking slowly,

it walks in a proud manner after the style of a game bantam cock,
picking its feet up well and putting them down carefully, and has
occasionally a peculiar habit of stepping backwards a couple of steps
or so, and with its tail often spread out fan-shaped. When reeling,
the tail is generally dropped and is then closed and pointed.
Some years ago I was anxious to have some young of this
species and I had a clutch of fresh eggs sent me by post, six in
number. The difficulty was to find a suitable wild bird’s nest with
eggs freshly laid in which to exchange the eggs. It would have
been useless to place the eggs in an open nest on account of the
difference in the colour of these eggs, which are a beautiful pink tint,
and the fine spots on them look as if the eggs had been sprinkled
with cayenne pepper. I found a Chiffchaffs nest, built a foot off
the ground, and being an oval nest with hole at side, the Grass¬
hopper Warbler’s eggs were in shadow as it were and the Chiffchaffs
would take no notice of the exchanged eggs. The birds incubated
them straight away and hatched five, the other egg being addled.
As soon as the young Grasshoppers began feathering I found
one missing from the nest, and the next day another was gone,
leaving only three; vermin had found them out, probably mice,
and the other three would have been destroyed, the same thing
would have occurred to her own young if she had not had the eggs
exchanged. Finding that vermin were certain to destroy the re¬
maining three, I took these and the pair of Chiffchaffs and placed
them in a large cage fitted up with ivy and boughs. I provided the
old birds with smooth green caterpillars, various other insects and
fresh live ants’ eggs ; the result was that they fed themselves and
reared the young without the slightest trouble from the moment
they were placed in their cage.
I fancy the young were two cocks and one hen, but it is
difficult to tell for certain except by the size, as the young males do
not assume their necklace of tiny black Thrush-like spots on the
throat until after their second moult.

Amongst recent improvements in aviculture, a prominent place
must be assigned to the handsome installations of the Amsterdam
Zoological Society—better known as the “ Artis,” from its famous
motto “ Natura Artis Magistra.” When the writer visited the col¬
lection some years ago, the smaller birds were well displayed in
roomy cages and aviaries: to-day they are lodged in a veritable
palace.
The new Bird House is a magnificent structure, with its
handsome, lofty outdoor aviaries, well provided with perching
accommodation, well planted with growing shrubs, well stocked
with healthy birds. Inside one stammers with admiration at the
fine spacious hall, reminding one of the buildings in the New York
Zoological Park. Quite odourless, the Bird House at Amsterdam
presents internally a double row of cages, the larger of these being
practically aviaries. These large cages have impervious concrete
floors, and are enclosed by diamond-meshed netting. The house is
flooded with light through the roof, and in winter is heated by neat,
compact installations of hot-water pipes. Large palms planted in
tubs add to the pleasing appearance df the building. The floor is
laid with tiles in tasteful patterns, and the house painted through¬
out in an unobtrusive colour scheme of cream and buff. The bird
house is continuous with an equally fine monkey-house : in the roof
will be noticed the famous Palconnier bricks, made of glass and each
containing a vacuum. In the outside aviaries, at the time of the
writer’s visit, there was a fine laburnum tree which had begun to
grow through the roof.
Many of the labels in the Bird House exhibit pictures of the
birds, excellently done in oils. In the larger cages several species
are kept together. Amongst the more notable exhibits may be
mentioned : a Cuban Thrush (Mimocichla rubrip.es), a Himalayan

Starling ( Spodiopsar malaharicus). The building contains two
especially rare birds — the Rhinoceros Hornbill ( Buceros rhinoceros)
from Sumatra, and the Red-billed Hornbill ( Lophoceros erythro-
rhynchus ) from Africa. The Cape Masked Doves ( (Ena capensis) at
Amsterdam are very lovely ; the grey portions of their plumage
exquisitely tinged with blue. Then, again, there is a fine brilliant
Gallinule (. Porphryriola martinica) , a Drongo (. Dissemurus paradiseus),.
Red-cheeked Mouse-bird ( Colins erythromelon), Bell-bird ( Chasmo-
rhyncha nudicollis), together with various Troupials, Jays, Toucans
and Pigeons. Both common and Victoria Crowned Pigeons are very
well represented : the booming note of these birds reminds one of
Bougainville’s sailors. When these heroes first landed in New
Guinea they fled in terror from the concealed pigeons, mistaking
their booming&amp;apos; cry for the signals of ambushed savages !
The small cages on the opposite side of the Bird House
contain much of interest. There is exhibited in this series : (l) a
Senegal Parrot, (2) a species of Pionus (Pionus menstruus), (3) a very
fine male Lesser Bird of Paradise, (4) a Timneh Parrot ( Psittacus
timneh ) (5) a Black-headed Siskin ( Chrysomitris magellanica) , (6) a
Vasa Parrot (Goracopsis vasa), (7) an Eclectus (Eclectics pectoralis),.
and (8) a very good pair of Dinemellia dinemelli, the species well
termed by Sir Harry Johnston “ the King of the Sparrows.” The
series also contains the Paradise Whydah, Pintailed Whydah, Laven¬
der Finch, Scarlet Tanager, Purple-capped Lory, and other well-
known birds.
Amsterdam is justly famous for its rich exhibit of Storks and
Cranes and Herons. This delightful installation consists of a neat,
double row of tiny houses, each with a little yard in front of it,
through which flows a stream of water. The shelter houses are
beautifully finished, almost like doll’s houses with their doors and
windows. It is charming to stand at one end of the avenue viewing
this bird town and its inhabitants, so well set of!&amp;apos; by the rich greenery
in the background. Amongst the exhibits may be mentioned : the

for exercise. The fine mass of vegetation adjoining the yards, with
the great birds running about and playing, almost suggests a forest

NUTCRACKER versus CHOUGH.
An Episode at the Zoological Gardens, London.
By Miss Lilian M. Medland, F.Z.S.
I witnessed a very amusing and interesting incident at the
Zoological Gardens the other day, between the Nutcracker (N.
caryocatactes) and the Chough ( P. graculus). I offered the Chough
a grape to see what he would do with it. He took it, promptly laid
it on the ground, dug a shallow hole with his bill, placed the grape
therein and covered it up, as a dog will bury a bone or biscuit for
which he has no immediate need. He came back quickly for
another grape, which he took to the same place, dug up the first one,
and taking both grapes in his bill, carried them to another spot and
buried them together. He came back a third time, took a grape and
hurried back to the other two, dug them up again and proceeded to
try and carry all three in his bill. He picked two up, and in trying
to get the third one, dropped one of the others. This went on for
several moments, and after a successful bit of juggling he managed
it, and took the three grapes to a place about three yards away
under the bushes, scraped a hole and buried all three grapes together
and carefully covered them up. Again he returned to me, and
immediately his back was turned, the Nutcracker, evidently with
evil intention in his mind, hurried to the hidden grapes, unearthed
them and took one away and buried it in a spot far removed from
the others and remained there on guard, with his back turned to the
Ghough, who meanwhile had found the uncovered grapes which the
Nutcracker had left. The Chough, with his fourth grape which he

laid with the others, again covered them up and came back to me
for another. Immediately the Nutcracker, who had been watching
his opportunity, hurried along to the Chough’s hidden treasure and
dug it up again, captured another grape and came back and hid it
with the first theft.
The Chough began to notice something amiss by this time,
and the fifth and sixth grapes he hid in different places and covered
them up with some leaves which were lying under the bush. He
then unearthed the first lot of grapes, minus two which the Nut¬
cracker had appropriated, and hid them in fresh places. He came
back to me and finding that I was not going to give him any more,
went back to the bush, carefully looked around and walked into the
sleeping-place at the back. The Nutcracker watched him out of the
back of his head apparently, and as soon as the Chough was out of
sight ran up to the bush and commenced digging it up all round.
The Chough came out again and the Nutcracker ceased his nefarious
task and deliberately turned his back on the Chough, and one could
see as plainly as possible that he was trying his utmost to annoy
the Chough without being detected. The Chough then came back
to the first patch of ground and turned it all over to see if he had
overlooked any grapes, or to find out where the missing ones had
gone to. Meanwhile the Nutcracker had found one of the hidden
grapes and took it a couple of feet away, dug a hole and covered it
with five or six leaves which had fallen from the bush. The two
birds never attempted to disagree, and in fact held no converse, as it
were, with one another at all. The Nutcracker assuming a non-
chalent air the whole time, succeeded admirably in nonplussing the
poor harrassed, but persevering, Chough.
At this moment the keeper arrived to put them to bed, thus
closing this decidedly amusing and certainly instructive incident.
It showed perseverance on one side, and perhaps the mischievious
qualities on the other side.

By Miss R. Alderson.
It seems rather late to write notes on last year, but with the
task of arranging the birds for the season of 1914, one’s thoughts
fly backwards to the past summer, and how certain birds failed and
others were a success, and what mistakes are to be avoided in
arranging the birds afresh.
For when a separate aviary cannot be given to each pair of
birds so much depends on whether the inmates will live happily
together. If they will there is some hope of a smooth nesting
season, but where they disagree it is impossible for the young birds
to have the care and attention they need if they are to thrive. I
have even known one instance of doves molesting the young one of
another pair with whom they had disagreed ; the poor little thing
was defenceless, and when found was so injured that it died.
So it is as well, when arranging for a coming season, to think
over the past one with a view to making any changes needed, but if
you have found several pairs of doves that will be friendly together
it is far wiser to let them alone, and to neither increase nor decrease
their number. No set rule may be given about any one variety of
dove ; it is more the individual character of the bird that determines
the question. I cannot claim to keep- regular notes on my birds,
though I feel that it is what everyone who keep any ought to do.
Such notes as the date the bird was acquired, its price, late owner,
and all nesting &amp;apos;notes especially, would make an interesting after¬
record, not only to the owner of the bird, but to others also.
My largest aviary has seven divisions. Five of these are
practically the same size—7ft. by 16ft.—and are divided into shelter
and flight. The doors of the shelter always stand open, and a
passage running at the back of the aviary is heated by a coke and
gas stove. I will take the compartments as they come.
No. 1 Division : — 1 pair of Diamond Doves ; 1 pair of Brush
Bronze-wing Doves ; 1 pair of Violet (or White-fronted) Doves.
In 1912 I tried keeping two pairs of Diamond Doves together
in this house, but it did not answer. Both pair of birds wanted the

Miss R. Alderson,
same side of the house to nest on, and though they did not fight it
ended in hopeless confusion, and only four young birds were reared
altogether by the two pairs. I found that eggs were laid in the nest,
then more material added, then eggs laid again, and which pair of
birds they belonged to would he difficult to say ; I can hardly think
they were all laid by one hen.
This last season the pair have reared five fine young ones :
two others died, one when in adult plumage, the other a late-hatched
bird that seemed to feel the cold, so I put it in a cage near the stove
in the passage. It did not occur to me at the time, but I think the
bird’s death was hastened through the fuel I was using giving off
gas fumes. Now I am using another kind, and, though much more
expensive, it is far more satisfactory and gives off a clean heat with
little smoke.
I left all my five young Diamond Doves in with their parents
till the end of the season, and they were a very happy little flock
together. There was such continual nesting going on in the house
that it was almost impossible to at any time do any catching up
without the risk of disturbing some sitting bird or young ones still
in the nest.
I find in every house where more than one pair of nesting
birds is kept there is this difficulty, and if the young birds have to
be left in, room must be allowed for them even if the aviary looks
only half full at the beginning of the season.
The cock Brush Bronzewing in this house is the survivor of
my first pair of this dove. I have had him a number of years, but
he shows no sign of age. The hen is a young bird about three
years old. I am always specially interested in her because she was
hand-reared by me from the egg till she was about a fortnight old,
but her earlier destiny has nothing to do with these notes, which
only concern her as she is now, a very shapely bird, though smaller
than some hens I have had.
This hen laid several eggs during the season, but only one
young bird was reared. It turned out to&amp;apos; be a hen, and did very
well and is now as large as its mother, but I have never seen a
hen with such a large round head. The shape is entirely different
to that of most Brush Bronze-wings, and I am curious to see how

the bird turns out. At present all three birds are still together and
agree perfectly.
The Violet Doves have done nothing. Early in the summer
I had a third bird (a cock) in the aviary, but I took him away as the
other two seemed inclined to nest. They now and then sat in one
of the nest-baskets but that was all. I have never reared any
Violet Doves since 1903, and these two birds are not my original
breeding pair. I have kept a good many of this dove at different
times, but have never found they nested very readily, save the one
pair I once had. The Violet is one of the most beautiful doves
imported, and I shall never forget what a pretty sight a flock of
fourteen were when altogether, just as they were sent to me from
Jamaica by a friend. * * *
In No. 2 DIVISION I have: 1 pair of Bronze-wing Pigeons,
1 pair of Diamond Doves; 1 pair of Senegal Doves; 1 cock Eufous
Dove.
The Bronze-wings were both adult when they came to me,
and I have had them over ten years. They still show no sign of
age, but the cock is quite blind on one side from an injury done
before he came to me. Besides rather spoiling his beauty, it makes
him somewhat clumsy on the nest with eggs or young birds,
though he is very steady when sitting, and a good parent.
When first this pair of Bronze-wings came to me, I also
bought at the same time, and from the same owner, a second cock,
a very fine bird. I gave the hen her choice, and without hesitation
she choose the blind bird, and they have been a devoted couple ever
since. I have watched the hen showing off to the cock, spreading
her gorgeous metallic wing to attract his notice, and giving him
affectionate little dabs with her beak, which I suppose in the bird
world we may look upon as kisses. The cock took it all very
quietly, but no doubt he was pleased with such flattering attention.
These Bronze-wings have reared many young ones, but I
almost thought they were too old to nest, though the hen laid eggs
and both birds would sit. To my surprise this year they reared a
very fine well-coloured cock bird. It w 7 as very strong and grew
very fast, perhaps being a single bird it got extra attention from
its parents.

Miss B. Alderson,
The Diamond Doves in this house reared three young ones.
A further pair—very late hatched—died of cold when out of the
nest. I had put them up a shelter and a good bed of hay, as I do
for all young doves just out (as it is seldom a young dove returns to
the nest, and as a rule it still needs warmth and protection) and in
the morning they were all right. Unfortunately they strayed away
and got on the cold cement floor and one was found dead, the other
cold and unconscious. Warmth and patience revived it, and I took
it in the house and hand-reared it for some days. The little bird was
easy to feed, with a shaped quill tooth-pick, on soaked small seeds.
It was so tame, and loved to sit nestling on my finger before the
warm fire, and as it grew and the plumage began to mature, I began
to hope I should rear it, and pictured what a nice tame pet it would
make. But my hopes came to nothing. One day my fox-terrier
puppy got to the cage through someone leaving the room door open,
and though he could not get to the bird, he upset the cage and I
have no doubt gave the poor Diamond a bad shock and bruised it.
I do not know whether it was this or not, but the bird began to
get weaker and in a few days died.
The pair of Senegal Doves had five young ones, but one died
when full grown. The old birds hardly ever stop nesting all through
the summer, and would go on all through the year if allowed. They
seem to come off the eggs frequently, and yet they always hatch
and the young are generally reared. When I first had these Senegals
I was in despair with them because they would not brood their
young ones properly, and time after time the poor little things died
of cold, now I never have any trouble, for the old birds seem to have
learnt wisdom as they grew older.
The Bufous Dove cock in this division I have had eleven
years, and being an imported bird I do not know his age when he
came to me. His mate died some years ago, and he is too old now
even to fly, but he enjoys his life in a quiet way for none of the
other doves molest him. The two Eufous Doves were almost the
nicest and gentlest doves I have ever kept, and perfect parents to
the many young&amp;apos; ones they reared whilst the hen lived.

In No 3 DIVISION I had—for it is re-arranged now—1 pair
of Brush Bronze-wings ; 1 pair of Diamond Doves ; 1 hen Solitary
Ground Dove.
These Brush Bronze-wing&amp;apos;s I have had for several years and
I used to consider them a good nesting pair, but latterly they have
done very badly, and this year did not rear a single young one.
They make nests and the hen lays many eggs, but the birds either
will not sit out their time, or else they let the young ones die when
a day or two old. Now and then I find several eggs laid in one nest
and the birds not sitting at all. I have tried to hatch the eggs under
Barbary Doves but without success, though the eggs are generally
fertile.
It is the more disappointing as in their earlier years—in the
same aviary—these Brush Bronze-wings used to rear such fine
young birds.
The Diamond Doves in this house did the worst of all my
four nesting pairs. They only reared two young ones : the hen was
shy and would often leave the nest, though I think she generally
returned to it later.
The hen Solitary Ground Dove I have had eleven years. I
put her into this aviary in the summer because she was being
tormented by other birds in the next division and I w r as forced to
move her, though I very much dislike altering the arrangement of
the birds when once the season has^started. The Bronze-wings did
not at first care for the Solitary hen, but finally settled down. I
have, however, had to move her again just recently, as I found her
one day wdth her feathers plucked and only the Bronze-wings could
be the culprits.
The hen Solitary Ground Dove is a very rare Dove. I only
once remember seeing some offered for sale. This hen I bought for
5/-, she being offered me at that price as a rough plumaged unknown
Dove and I did not know at the time what she was. My delight at
getting her was great and as I had already a cock—bought under a
wrong name. They nested, but I only once reared one bird to full
maturity.
No. 4 DIVISION contained : 1 pair of Green-winged Doves :
a hen Madagascar Dove ; 2 cock Spotted Pigeons.

Notes on 1913.
In this house I bred nothing all through the summer. The
Green-wing&amp;apos;s made several nests, and some of the eggs were hatched
but no young ones reared.
The Green-wing eggs are so deep a cream as to be almost
buff, the young birds have very dark, blackish skins, making them
look like little negro birds I always think, and such a contrast to
the young White Java Doves whose bodies are a soft clear pink with
no down on at all, almost like baby mice. The hen Green-wing is a
bird I bred some years ago, at a time when I reared several. She
nearly died of cold after she left the nest and I think this gave her a
check and caused her to be rather undersized, but she is a healthy
little bird all the same.
I was rather sorry for the Green-wings, because one of the
Spotted Pigeons took a fancy to their nesting basket and persisted
in sitting in it. Often when I have come in the house I have seen
the big pigeon’s head peeping over the edge of the nest, though I
do not think it ever harmed the Greenwings themselves. I had to
separate the two Spotted Pigeons, for being two cocks they fought,
and later I sold them both. I was very sorry to part with them for
they were lovely birds, but too large for my small places. The
colouring of the Spotted Pigeon is most harmonious, the tints are so
soft and there seems almost a bloom on the plumage which is always
tight and smooth, the eye is light coloured and seems of just the
shade to perfectly match the surrounding feathers.
The Madagascar there is nothing to chronicle about. She
was just an odd hen, whose mate died the year before.

We are asked to announce that a Public Meeting&amp;apos; in support
of the above-mentioned Bill will be held at the Caxton Hall, West¬
minster, on March 19th, 1914, at 5.30 p.m.
This Bill, a non-party measure, will prohibit the importation
into the United Kingdom of the plumage of wild birds, such as
Egrets and Birds of Paradise—Ostrich feathers being especially
exempted—and it is confidently believed that such legislation will
have far-reaching effects towards the preservation of many rare and
beautiful birds now in danger of extermination.
Mr. Sydney Buxton, ex-President of the Board of Trade, and
Mr. Page Croft, M.P., who introduced the Bill into the House of
Commons last year, will speak, among others; and since it is
desirable that the Meeting should be as representative and influential
as possible, it is hoped that all members of the Avicultural Society
in favour of the measure will attend, if possible.
Free tickets for the Meeting may be obtained from :

My pair of Blue Budgerigars, when I moved my birds from Berkshire to
Herefordshire last October, were put in a small cage, in my new bird-room, for
the winter. The hen laid a clutch of four eggs in a very short time after the
move, two of which were hatched. The eggs were laid anyhow on the drawer of
the cage, which was covered with sawdust, but the birds scratched that away, so
that the eggs were on the bare wood, and were repeatedly rolled about from one
end of the cage to the other. Except for the female, who performed the incu¬
bating, coming off her eggs when the daily food was given and for feeding, she
never left them. There were eight days between the birth of the two young ones,

the youngest dying when a fortnight old. The first-born still survives and is
blue, but rather undersized, and nothing like so robust and brilliant in colouring
as were two from the same parents hatched in my former aviaries at Benham
Valence last summer, both of which birds most unfortunately killed themselves
against the wire meshing when they left their nest in a large hollow log. They
were almost as brilliant a blue as their parents, and almost as large. The old
birds are in robust health, so that it is puzzling to know why this, their latest
progeny, should be undersized, for its life in a cage until leaving the nest would
be exactly the same as that in a wild state. The parents had plenty of green
food all the time,
Now, they will be turned into an outdoor aviary, where I hope they will
rear a good brood. H. D. ASTLEY.

FOREIGN DOVES AT LIBERTY.

SIR,—I was interested to read Lord Tavistock’s article on Foreign Doves
at Liberty in the February number, and the difficulties he had to contend with
in the shape of 1 canker.’
I have myself known the ordinary Collared Dove to catch the disease from
the wild Turtle Dove, which also gave the disease to his Foreign Doves.
But I am especially interested, because I am a Pigeon fancier as well as a
Foreign Bird enthusiast, and during the 1913 breeding season lost a great number
of youngsters through canker.
This disease I had not experienced during the last five years, and the
exact reason for it is hard to account for among Pigeon Fanciers, I believe.
But the curious thing is that the disease only affected young birds in the
‘ squeaker stage, and that the old birds, though feeding the youngsters in some
cases before it was discovered, did not contract it, in a single instance.
In both the cases I have instanced I have examined specimens, and the
‘ canker ’ outwardly appeared the same—a yellowy cheesy matter which choked
the gullet and stopped the free passage of air.
But why did the Doves contract it from feeding on the discarded corn,
perhaps of the Turtle Doves, while the old Tumblers, though feeding youngsters
when choked with canker, were not affected in a single case.
I thought that the parallel cases would not be irrelevant to the Avicultural
Magazine, and that some member might throw some light on the subject.

Sir, —I am not a member* of the Avicultural Society but read the monthly
magazine and was interested to read Mr. Blaggs notes on the Plumed Ground
Dove. I have a pair which laid several times last summer and sat their full
time, the last pair of eggs being left when the young birds were partly hatched,
two other lots of eggs were fertile but failed to hatch. In the case of my pair
there was certainly no change of any sort in the plumage. The birds were in an
outdoor open-air aviary and in perfect condition. They were very wild and shy
at first and deserted the first two pairs of eggs, after sitting a few days, but
afterwards settled down and were quite comparatively tame. You might like to
have my experience with these doves, so I thought I would write you a few lines.
Herbert Bright.
SIR.—I thought the following would be interesting to the readers of the
Avicultural Magazine.
A Sand Martin was flying up and down the river Thames, close to Tile-
hurst, which is two miles from Reading. It was seen there about ten days
before Christmas. I have never heard of or seen a Sand Martin at such a time
of the year, although I have seen House Martins as late as the third week in
November.
A fortnight ago a most unusual thing occurred. A large brood of Part¬
ridges hatched off at Silchester Manor Farm and were all doing well.

If all the egg&amp;apos;s produced in our cages and aviaries became
birds the market would soon be glutted ; but as it is many eggs are
infertile; and many others, though hatched, result in youngsters
which either die or are killed in infancy. The following is a summary
of my failures and successes to date : I do not include domesticated
Canaries, because everybody either has bred or could easily breed
more or less decent examples of these sports, and because our rules
exclude them, but hybrids between the Canary and any wild type
are admissable.
Beginning with the Thrush-like birds then, this is my modest

Fringilla montifring ilia. A hen in one of my aviaries, un¬

Carduelis elegans, three in one nest reared and a second
sitting hatched in 1895. Of course I have also bred mules with the
Canary, the cock bird helping to rear the young&amp;apos;, but then the birds
were not confined within the limits of a Canary breeding-cage, but
had a cage 18 inches cubic measure to themselves : in a confined

space a cock Goldfinch sometimes becomes unreliable, breaking the
eggs.
Petronia dentata and albigularis. Unpaired hens: they built
a neat nest, but dropped many infertile eggs on the floor of the cage.
Sycalis flaveola. Formerly I used to breed this species every
year : I also bred hybrids between it and S. pitlzelni, and in 1898 I
bred several hybrids between a Canary and a hen of this species :
unfortunately only one (a female bird) survived the moult and with
each successive moult became more and more like its mother, never¬
theless a cock Saffron-finch associated with it ignored it utterly.
Sycalis arvensis —built in 1907, but the hen died without
laying, possibly egg-bound.
Serinus flaviventris. An old hen of this species paired with
a cock Canary in 1912 ; built, but laid only one egg which she
reared :—a fine cock bird, hardly distinguishable from cf S. flaviven¬
tris , but with Canary song.
Serinus icterus. Built and laid on several occasions in my
aviaries, but the eggs invariably disappeared, apparently eaten by
the cock bird.
Serinus leucopygius. Built and laid, but the hen generally
died from egg&amp;apos;-binding before the clutch was complete. A hen paired
with a Canary hatched young, which however died before they were
fledged.
Alario alario. Built a nest and laid in August, 1901, but
failed to hatch.
Acanthus cannabina. Of course I have bred hybrids between
this species and a Canary.
Pyrrhula europcea. This species built, laid and incubated in
one of my aviaries ; but died on the nest just as the young hatched :
I handed them over to the tender mercies of a Canary which failed
to rear them : perhaps this was as well, for I believe it was the
same bird which, after bringing up an infant Goldfinch, plucked it
so unmercifully that it died.
Emberiza citrinella. Built a beautiful nest in 1889, but was
disturbed and did not lay.
Gyanospiza cyanea. Paired with Canary which built and
laid in 1896 ; the Indigo Finch wonld not let her sit, but repeatedly
pulled out the nest so that nothing resulted.

Gubernatrix cristata. Built, laid and hatched out four young
ones in a Chinese wicker cage hung up in one of my aviaries, in
1895 ; but three of the four young ones were thrown out of the
nest when half grown, because the parents could not get sufficient
living insect food to satisfy them. The fourth bird was reared
and flew, but did not take kindly to the soft food and consequently
died in the young plumage.
Paroaria larvata. Built, laid and began to sit in 1904, but
deserted the nest and died just as the eggs were beginning to develop.
Paroaria cucullata. Built several nests and pulled them to
pieces again, but did not lay.
Ghloris chloris. Built&amp;apos;, laid and reared its young wdthout the
least difficulty, the nest being formed in an ordinary Canary nest-box
hung on the wire-work of the aviary.
Spermophila albigularis. Built several nests from fine tough
fibre, but never laid.
Sporceginthus amandava. A pair built in one of my bird-
room aviaries in a potted box-tree, but the nest was seized by other
Waxbills successively and consequently there was no result.
Stictospiza formosa has both built nests and laid in my
aviaries, but has always been disturbed by other birds, so that I
have never bred it.
Estrilda cinerea. This Waxbill has also built and laid in my
birdroom, but never succeeded in hatching its eggs.
Poephila mirabilis. After many attempts to breed this species
in cages and indoor aviaries, I at length succeeded in an outdoor
aviary in 1905 and 1906. The two eggs illustrated were from
the same clutch.
Poephila acuticaucla. A female paired with a male P. cincta
built but did not lay : she was of the race to which the name hecki
was given.
Poephila cincta. I have only once bred this species, the hens
being very liable to egg-binding.
Steganopleura guttata. Went to nest on one occasion but
the hen killed her husband because he entered the nest when she
was sitting in the daytime, so there was no result.
Bathilcla ruficauda. A female paired with Tceniopygia

castanotis in 1896 built but did not lay. A pair purchased in
1905 built and began to lay but were driven from their nest by
a pair of Mania piectoralis.
Tceniopygia castanotis. I bred dozens of this common little
species without difficulty.
Aidemosyne modesta. Built in a bush in one of my indoor
aviaries and laid a full clutch of eggs, but the parents suddenly and
unaccountably disappeared. I suspected mice of having carried them
off, since no trace of the birds could be found.
Amaclina fascicita. My first pair of this species bred without
the least trouble, but all others received later suffered from the usual
fault, — egg&amp;apos;-binding, which causes the death of most of the hens.
Amadina erythrocephala. I never succeeded in breeding this
species, all the hens died from egg-binding.
Uroloncha acuticauda. Readily nested in a flight-cage, but
never succeeded in rearing young until paired up with a Bengalee
( U. domestica of Flower). Of the latter, which I regard as of hybrid
origin, I have bred all three varieties at various times.
Munia punctulata. Has built and laid in my aviaries, but
has never hatched out.
Munia maja. Nested and laid, but was too restless to hatch
its eggs.
Munia atricapilla. Repeatedly built and laid, but never
hatched an egg.
Munia oryzivora. I have bred this common species freely,
both in cage and aviary, in all its varieties.
Spermestes cucullatus. A hen paired with Poephila cincta
built repeatedly, but never laid.
Hypochera chalybeatce. Hens which went to nest in my bird-
room died from egg-binding.
Ilypochera ultramarina. The same observation applies to
this as to the preceding species.
Pyromelana franciscana. Built in a cage in 1885, but both
sexes died before eggs were produced. In 1899 one egg&amp;apos; was laid in
another aviary, but not in a nest.
Quelea quelea. Built frequently, and on one occasion laid
two eggs which subsequently disappeared from the nest, probably
devoured by some other bird.

Hyphantornis cucullatus. Nests built, but there was no hen
to lay in them.
Hyphantornis melanocephalus. Built, but the females never
appropriated the nests.
Ploceus baya. My males built many nests, but there were
no females with them.
Ploceus manyah. The same observation applies to this as to
the preceding species.
Anthus pratensis. In 1890 a female in one of my aviaries
laid an egg in a Canary’s nest built about two feet above the ground.
Alauda arvensis. In 1889 a hand-reared hen laid an egg in
one of my aviaries.
Calopsittacus novce-hollandice. I bred one young cock in my
birdroom in 1907. Some years previously I had fertile eggs, but the
hen died during incubation. In an outdoor aviary, breeding with
this species is well-known to be easy.
Palceornis rosce. I bred one female in an indoor aviary in
1894.
Agapornis roseicollis. Two hens kept together in a flight-cage
laid several eggs in a nest-box.
Melopsittacus undulatus. I bred nine young ones in the
winter of 1892-3, but they were all delicate and eight of them died
in 1893 : even in an indoor aviary it is- not advisable to let one’s
birds breed in the winter.
Zenaida aurita. Built in an outdoor aviary, but did not lay.
In July 1900 it laid one egg on the floor of an indoor aviary.
Turtur risorius. I suppose everyone has bred this domesti¬
cated species, certainly anyone could do so : I bred numbers both of
the typical form, the white sport and hybrids between the latter and
the Necklaced Dove.
Turtur semitorquatus. Laid many eggs on a hamper-lid in
one of my aviaries, but were so much disturbed by other birds that
they never succeeded in hatching.
Turtur tigrinus. I bred this in an outdoor aviary in 1897.
Geopelia cuneata. After repeated failures to breed this com¬
mon Dove indoors, I in 1907 turned a pair into a large garden aviary
where they reared young without trouble; I however left them out

too late and lost them; but I bred the species again in the two
succeeding years.
Columbuia picui. In 1900 I found an egg of this species on
the floor of the birdroom.
Ghamcepelia passerina. Built, but the hens died from egg-
binding.
Tympanistria tympanistria. I bred this species in an outdoor
aviary in 1906, 1907 and 1908 ; but indoors, although many eggs had
been laid and one youngster partly reared in 1903, I had never been
successful.
Chalcopcelia ckalcospila. The hen occasionally laid an egg in
a basket-nest in an indoor aviary ; but the cock would not take his
part in incubation, so that none was hatched.
Gkalmpkaps chrysocklora. The hen of a pair purchased in
1896 occasionally laid an egg, but never built: a pair turned into an
outdoor aviary in 1907 (after building but not laying in 1906) made
some pretence at courting but did not even attempt to build.
Phag)s ckalcoptera. I tried a pair of this species for many
years both in indoor and outdoor aviaries, giving them a hamper-lid
to nest upon, the hen laid many eggs, mostly fertile, and did her
duty in incubating them, hut the cock had gouty toes and always
managed to injure the eggs before they were ready to hatch.
OcyphMps lopkotes. The hen of a pair purchased in 1896
laid an egg on the ground; but though I kept the birds until 1903,
no further attempt was made at breeding.
Leiitoptila wellsi. A female received in exchange in 1898,
although unpaired, laid eggs incessantly during the whole of 1905,
and steadily incubated unless they were removed. I secured quite a
number of eggs for collections, but the bird so enfeebled itself that it
died early in the year following.
Leucosarcia picata. Although I could not persuade this
species to breed in an outdoor aviary, the birds were no sooner
brought indoors than the hen began to lay on a loose platform of
branches through which many eggs fell to the floor and others half
way through the twigs, so that none could be incubated.
Excalfactoria chinensis. Laid many eggs, but none were
hatched.

Lopmrtyx californicus. Laid, but did not sit.
Thus, of the seventy forms or thereabouts which have either
built, laid, or both, in my aviaries, only twenty have been success¬
fully reared. Had I kept fewer birds and in outdoor aviaries only, I
do not doubt that I should have bred quite double that number.
At the same time, in spite of all our successful friends may say and
think respecting luck in breeding ; the fact that many birds difficult
to breed have been reared in aviaries more crowded and smaller than
mine, looks suspiciously like sheer luck: on the other hand it is just
conceivable that, when the owner (as in my case) looks after his
birds himself, they may become too comfortable, fat, and lazy, to
trouble about rearing families. I have heard bird-owners say, that
a day of starvation occasionally is as good for birds as for dyspeptic
human beings ; but I should not like to put it to the test.
It is an odd thing that those bird-owners who laugh at the
idea of success being more or less a matter of luck, do themselves
occasionally speak of having had an unlucky season : it is perhaps
natural to think that another’s misfortunes are the result of care¬
lessness and one’s own of sheer ill-luck.

By Lord Brabourne.
An “ embarras de richesses ” will beset any attempt at
aviculture in Paraguay. It is enough for it to be merely known that
an interest is taken in birds and apparently every boy for miles
round forsakes the daily routine of his life in the mistaken pursuit
of every bird, from a King Vulture to a Humming Bird.
The spot, to which these notes refer, was situated 27 miles
north of Villa Rica (the second town of Paraguay) and but a few
hundred yards or so from absolutely virgin forest ; across this small
distance nothing but forest primeval and uninhabited intervened
between the Parana River 100 miles to the westward.
In a country where all the world outside the towns lives in
open thatched huts and where houses in the European sense of the
word are unknown, aviculture must necessarily be rather a haphazard

affair, and the following subjects all lived unfettered in their cap¬
tivity, coming and going at their own sweet will, and for the most
part sooner or later roamed away to their native forest or swamp.
Indeed, in a spot where a Humming Bird’s (Chlorostilbon aureo-
ventris ) nest was discovered under the eaves, where Toucans, Trogons
and Parrakeets would perch in a tree not 50 yards from where one
fed daily and where Tinamous (C. Tcitaupa) would be calling and
answering each other in the garden itself, any kind of restraint
would seem veritable sacrilege.
On arrival in Paraguay the menagerie consisted of but one
bird, a Red Macaw ( A. Macao) ; beyond the fact that his wing was
cut he was entirely free ; this to the detriment of a vine-covered
“ pergola ” and the thatched roof. His usual perch was on the
half-walled-up side of the hut, and from there he descended with
regularity at meal times and climbed up on to the back of the
nearest chair, if his demands were not attended to with the utmost
speed, he would draw attention by gently worrying the neck or
shoulder of the occupant of the chair. The intelligence with which
he understood the reproof or caress implied by the intonation of his
name was a marvel. If the former he would scuttle down from off
the chair, pausing every yard or so in his bow-legged shamble to look
upwards and listen for the least sign of relenting, and, if this was
detected, he used to return shamelessly to his original spot to pursue
his persecutions. Macaws occasionally flew overhead, upon which
the captive would call and the passing birds answer. Once a flock
of six came right down and flew several times round the house
within a few yards, and the tame bird became quite frantic in his
efforts to use his clipped wings.
At a spot some 40 miles northwards, where there are large
grassy openings in the forest, sprinkled with many low palms bearing
in March a yellow fruit called “ Yataitv,” the Blue and Yellow
Macaws ( A. Ararauna) collect in numbers to feed, and a native
makes a yearly custom of netting them with a call-bird and selling
the birds in Villa Rica and Asuncion. He had just returned, and his
catch of over 50 was loose with wings cut in the garden. The noise
may be imagined : also the state of some half-dozen orange trees, in
which the birds were placed; but oranges in Paraguay are as

plentiful as acorns in England, and as cheap. So it was decided on
the return journey to provide a companion for the Bed Bird. How
to convey him home on horse-back was a difficulty. However, a
cloth was wrapped firmly round the barrel of a 12-bore shot gun,
whilst a stout leather thong was bound round the Macaw’s feet, and
bird and gun were attached. Words fail to picture the discomforts
of the journey, the bird’s attempts to fall off the perch, his attempted
frantic assaults on the bearer of the gun, and the difficulty of
dismounting and re-mounting, etc. It happened to be heavy rainy
weather, and at that time Parrots both tame and wild are most
voluble, and the Eed bird was heard at some distance proclaiming
the fact that he still lived ; the Blue Macaw as soon as he arrived in
earshot gave the most piercing shrieks of joy at the near proximity
of a fellow ; and a concert of shriek and counter-shriek was main¬
tained during the time it took to bring the birds to closer quarters.
But the new-comer once placed beside the Red bird the latter’s
attitude changed to one of suspicion. He backed before his new¬
found friend with one claw raised deprecating&amp;apos;ly, and kept the
intruder at a distance for some time. Still, at the end of a few days
they became on the very best of terms, never more than a few feet
away, and scratching each other’s heads continually. Under the
civilizing influence of the older prisoner the Blue and Yellow Macaw
at the end of a month had become comparatively tame, though he
never quite reached that degree of familiarity which the former
displayed. When it is considered that six months before acquaint¬
ance with the Red bird he had possibly never even seen a man, that
he had been captured more or less violently and when adult, and
that in that short space of time he had become as docile and almost
as intelligent as a dog, whose ancestors have been bred in captivity
for countless generations, it is impossible not to wonder at the truly
marvellous intelligence and adaptability of these Macaws.
The Parrots cannot be left without mentioning an amusing
incident that occurred just before the arrival of the Yellow Macaw.
A Toucan (Pteroglossus castanotis ) that had met with some accident
and could not fly, but that was otherwise sound, had been brought
in from the woods by one of the men. He was placed alongside the
Macaw and remained apparently lost in reflections on his unhappy

state. The Macaw, brave as a lion and very curious, approached,
and seemed to have some intention of making himself acquainted,
when the Toucan suddenly awoke and in a fury made lunge after
lunge with his long beak at the Parrot, who was driven simply to
fall off his perch to the ground before his small adversary. This
bird could not be persuaded to eat, so at the end of 24 hours it
seemed better to kill it, and his final resting-place is the Bird
Department of the South Kensington Museum.
“Isabel” was an Urraca Jay (Cyanocorctx chrysops ), the
Acahe ” of the Guaranis, and was taken from the nest at a very
early age ; it was some time before it could be persuaded to forage
for itself, and required a deal of personal attention, but seemed to
thrive well on a diet of chopped raw meat. Still, when after a
few weeks it was able to leave its box and see life it became an
almost insufferable nuisance. The perpetual croaking cry for food
could be ignored so long as it was confined to its box, but when one
was awakened at the very early dawn by unceasing pleadings from
under the very bed, and when in a few days later the bird would
flutter on to the very bed itself, sudden death nearly overtook it
more than once. By-and-bye the Jay began to use its wings, and
becoming less and less familiar soon vanished altogether, probably
to join one of the numerous flocks in the neighbourhood. These
Jays play a conspicuous part in the bird-life of Paraguay, and by
their lovely blue and primrose colouring and strange inquisitive notes
are amongst the first birds to attract the attention of a stranger.
They are always seen in flocks of from about 6 to 12.
An interesting pet whose captivity was of the shortest dura¬
tion was a Tinamou (Bhyncotus rufescens), the Large Partridge of
Argentina and Paraguay. This was at a time when Locusts in the
“ hopper ” stage were swarming everywhere. The bird was only
about the size of a 10-day old chicken, but well able to forage for
itself. Seveivil of these Locusts were placed near it, and in spite of
their jerking efforts to escape, the Tinamou caught them one after
another with all the stately strategy and deliberate greed of a mature
old hen. This young bird showed not the slightest fear of man, but
its powers of upward movement were underestimated ; it was placed
in a large open box and in the morning had vanished. As Locusts

continued to be abundant for some time, it doubtless grew to be a
fine healthy bird.
A Wood Partridge (Odontophorus cwpueira), a bird of un¬
sociable nature, was not a success. This “ Uru,” as the Guranis
call it, was captured when adult, and flatly refusing all sustenance
moped with its head in the corner of its box. So after twenty-
four hours’ captivity the bird was liberated.
Every country in South America seems to possess what may
be termed the “ national tame bird.” In Argentina it would appear
to be the Cardinal ( Paraoria cucullata) ; in the coast region of Peru
the “ Huarakeke ( Burhinus superciliaris ); in Veirezuela the Sun
Bittern (Eurypyga helias), and certainly in Paraguay it is the
Whistling Heron ( Syrigma sibilatrix), the “ Quarah-mimbi ” (mean-
in “Child of the sun”) of the Guaranis. It is appreciated not for
its beauty only. The idea of the natives, that it destroys beetles,
cockroaches, etc., is probably correct. But large indeed would be
the flock necessary to make an impression on a Paraguayan
“ rancho.” Many of these birds were always for sale in the Hotel
in Villa Rica, where rich Argentines come to spend the winter.
Several other species were also kept, Egrets ( Egretta egretta),
Curassows and Guans ( Graz sclateri and Or tali.s canicollis),
Cariamas ( Gariama cristata ), “ Teru-terus ” (Belonopterus grisescens).
No great trade can have been done in -these last, since they swarm
throughout Argentina. From this Hotel on returning south a King
Vulture was bought. He was an interesting bird, and his first feat
was to escape from his cage on the docks in Asuncion. Luckily his
powers of flight were as yet merely sufficient to provide exercise for
the obese, which infirmity was prominent in our two porters ; and he
w r as not very easily secured. On arrival at his destination he was
given complete liberty and soon became very tame, and would pull
one’s bootlaces or take one’s hand and hold it in his beak. As his
wings grew stronger he developed a most unbirdlike “ trait.” Small
Tinamous ( Nothura maculosa) abound in most parts of Argentina,
and in that locality they were sufficiently abundant. So, when
shooting, no great distance had to be covered before the first was
flushed. At the near sound of a gun-shot the Vulture would
immediately fly towards the shooter and attempt to perch on his

shoulders, and would follow up shot after shot in this manner for
some distance. The favourite perch of this bird was on the highest
point of the roof, where he could be seen in the early morning
motionless with wings widespread, as if to catch the fullest warmth
of the first rays of the sun ; a well-known position of all the South
American Vultures. He was discovered one day dead, and a post¬
mortem examination disclosed a badly contused skull. The assassin
was never discovered.
Amongst birds of interest to aviculturists and easily to be
obtained may be mentioned Blue Tanagers (Thraupis sayaca ),
Yellow Tanagers (Tangara flava), the Long-tailed Manakin Chiroxi-
phia caudata ) ; various members of the Troupial family, of which
perhaps the most interesting was the Red-rumped Cacique (Cacicus
aphanes). Previous to arrival these birds had actually had a
nesting colony in the garden. The remains of their swinging nests
were still to be seen but the birds themselves had unhappily been
scared away, though they frequently returned in small parties, as if
to view the site of their former home. There was a whole colony
about half-a-mile away on the edge of the forest, possibly the same
tribe. The beautiful Magpie Tanager (Cissopis minor) and the
perhaps even more lovely Swallow Tanagers (Procnias caerulea)
were amongst the rarer birds. Of the former only two were seen in
fifteen months ; the latter were migratory and common only for
about a fortnight in two consecutive years in September. They
were in small flocks and kept to the tops of the tallest possible trees,
feeding on a small black fruit.
The comparative prices of birds in their native countries may
be of interest to aviculturists. The Red Macaw referred to cost 5/- ;
the Yellow one, 8/4; the King Vulture, 16/8. But it must be
remembered that these were birds particularly appreciated by the
Paraguayans themselves, and in Asuncion would probably have
cost double as much. The average price of smaller birds, such as
Tanagers, Trupials, Finches, etc., may be fairly put at 1/-. The
Jay was bought for one Paraguayan paper dollar, worth at the
time 4d. A Curassow (Crax sclateri) was once offered to the writer
for 6/8.

many of those families distinguishing the great Brazilian sub-region

For months it was on my mind. That move from Berkshire
into Herefordshire. I could not move all the birds at once. I
could not be settled in my new home, yet I must prepare their
homes, and have someone in one county and someone in another
to look after those that would be moved and others still left behind.
People asked me how many birds I had ? I didn’t know ! About
100 Ducks, including some 16 or 17 species, six species of Geese,
Black-necked and Coscoroba Swans, „14 enormous Cranes, which
wouldn’t exactly go into one portmanteau; the contents of a bird-
room, in which were such rarities as Bed Sun Birds, a Crested
Ixulus, Blue-headed Bock Thrushes, Blue Budgerigars, Yucatan
Blue Jays, etc., etc. ; about 90 birds in outdoor aviaries, and other
etceteras, such as Japanese Bantams (the Duckwing variety). And
at the other end all confusion, a 14th Century Manor House in a
state of resurrection from what it had become of late years, a
decidedly dilapidated farm-house, adorned outside with every con¬
ceivable untidiness and rubbish ; the drainage of the house and farm
emptying into the surrounding moat, the farm-yard staring at one
from the other side of the water, offending both eyes and nose, rats
gaily gambolling in broad daylight ; no garden, unless a strip of
ground rich in chickweed (which, by-the-bye, encouraged me to take
the place !) with a “ summer-house,” whose windows were adorned

with blue, red and yellow glass of the most vivid hues, could be
called a garden. Pleasaunce, it certainly was not ! Builders, stone¬
masons, and all the rest of it everywhere, and relays of carts laden
with stone turning every inch of ground (after rain) in a rich soil of
old red sandstone, with a soupcon of clay, into a quagmire up to the
very windows. There was more soup than soup£on, for it was mud
of that nature through which one waded.
And only an occasional day on few occasions to strive amidst
all that turmoil, scrimmage,^and mess inexpressible, to settle upon
the future residences for the birds, and edit the Avicultural
Magazine ! The architect said, “ Where have you been ? ”
“Settling on a spot for my Crane’s paddock.” “Whereabouts?”
“ Over there,” I answered, pointing across the moat, in that
meadow where the other moat is.” “ You will, of course,
put them quite the other side ; it will never do for any wire
fencing to be seen.” I answered, “ Oh, of course ,” not having the
slightest intentions of hiding away my Cranes, especially as a whole
field intervened between the paddock I intended to form and the
verge of the garden which was being brought into being. I did
argue at first that the wire would be almost invisible from the
windows, and that Cranes were in existence in 1340 A.D. when the
house was built and bath-rooms were not ; which latter were to
have their place within the house itself. “ I should have a bath¬
room for the Cranes ; why not ? ” was the retort.
It was plainly useless to invite him to become a member of

be in sight of the house. They would do over there,” and he pointed
to a far-off spot behind a hedge of about 30 feet in height, where the
future kitchen garden was to be. But the aviaries are up, in the
place I meant them to he, within view of the windows too, with
only the moat and an old stone wall intervening; so that I can hear
the shrill calls of Queen Alexandra Parrakeets, the booming of
Bronze-winged Pigeons, the soft cooing of Diamond Doves, and the
;softer notes of Blue Birds, etc., from my bedroom, outside which,

almost sweeping some of the windows with its branches, stands a
giant cedar, planted by Wordsworth, the poet; into the shelter and
shade of which same tree come the Palm and Crested Doves, and
even Kingfishers at times, whilst beneath it, on moonlight nights, I
see the white forms of the Black-necked Swans swimming in the
moat, and listen to their melodious whistling.
The Aviaries occupy the site of a barn, decidedly on its last
legs, which did not perish in vain, for its roof was a roof of ancient
stone moss-grown tiles, and its timbers, which it must have feared
were to be shivered, were of ancient oak ; both tiles and timbers
having found an honourable place in the restoration of the house
itself, so that all is well. The aviaries are surrounded by open
lawn, but a short time ago a foul farmyard quagmire, which
ground is enclosed by stone walls. Six flights, somewhere about
the size of those which form part of the new Bird House at the
London Zoological Gardens, perhaps a little smaller ; with roosting
houses, in each of which is a radiator and electric light.
The shelters are under the roof, higher within than the top
of the open flights, the eaves projecting two feet over the latter, and
the roof is good both in form and material, being composed of old
Georgian grey-green slates of the thickness of stone ones, beneath
which dwelt for some time the celebrated Lady Craven, afterwards
Magravine of Anspach, so that even the architect busy across the
moat had to acknowledge them to be not only inoffensive, but
distinctly good. A passage runs the whole length at the back of the
roosting houses, not only giving access to them but also to four
chambers on the other side of it, one for the heating apparatus, one
for a hospital, one for food, and the last for washing up, where hot
and cold water is laid on.
In each flight is a cement pool, with water running from one
end of the aviaries to the other. The floor of the aviaries is raised
two feet above the path that runs round them, and beneath the
flights thick steel wire meshing has been embedded, deep enough to
allow shrubs to be planted, the meshing being welded into the
cement of the foundations, so that no rats can possibly get in.
Running water, radiators, electric light, good food and
shelter ! What more do birds want ? They are like the bull that

I have written so much respecting my personal experiences
in bird-keeping, that I feel some diffidence in taking up the pages
of our Magazine by an account of my work upon this branch of
ornithology from the time when, as an utter ignoramus, I first
attempted to keep birds in cages : however, our editor asks me to do
so, and therefore I must beg our members to forgive me if I weary
them.
Of course I began by breeding&amp;apos; domesticated Canaries ; but,
although I was moderately successful with them, I soon wearied of
fanciers’ sports, and (as already noted in my article on hand-rearing
British Birds) took up the study of species. I knew nothing about
their correct food beyond what I could glean from various books
respecting that eaten by the birds when at liberty, but I speedily
made the acquaintance of a few other bird-keepers about equally
well or ill informed, and we used to compare experiences of failures
and successes, which may possibly have been of some slight use.
When I began to keep birds I knew of no books which would
give me information on the subject; doubtless there were such books

in existence, but I was not aware of the fact ; so that when Cassell’s
Cage-Birds appeared I was only too glad to secure it. The perusal
of our late friend Wiener’s chapters on foreign birds introduced me
to the excellent work done by the well-known Dr. Buss and first
stimulated me to try and produce something in the same line myself,
as a help to the ever increasing number of aviculturists in the
British islands ; but of course I could not attempt anything of the
kind until I had learned by hitter experience how to house and feed
birds in captivity.
I am afraid my eagerness to acquire a general knowledge of
cage-birds led me into keeping too many at a time ; consequently
there were at first more quarrels and fewer successes in breeding
than there might otherwise have been ; but at least it taught me
what species might be safely kept together. On two occasions my
birds numbered 250, and (excepting during my holidays) I only had
my evenings from 5 p.m. in which to attend to them ; my aviaries
also were not constructed as they would have been had I possessed
greater experience of the requirements of birds at the time when
they were made.
Altogether I suppose I have kept 230 species of birds, British
and Foreign, and many of these owing to their aggressive or pre¬
dacious natures had to be kept in separate cages, but they were
almost invariably accommodated with enclosures sufficiently large
to enable them to use their wings and bathe at will. A small cage
is an abomination and surely not conducive either to the health or
happiness of its inmate.
Of Thrush-like birds the following have lived for longer or
shorter periods in my possession :—The Missel-Thrush, many Song-
Thrushes both hand-reared and trapped in the garden, a pair of
Bed-wings, a Fieldfare, numerous Blackbirds both hand-reared and
trapped, and a Grey-winged Ousel. Hand-reared birds are some¬
times better for exhibition but not as songsters ; because they
cannot learn their wild song without instruction. I gi’eatly pre¬
ferred birds of the year captured during the winter: in severe
weather these soon become tame and confiding, and, after their first
moult in confinement, they are quite as tame as hand-reared

examples. I have not found any of the true Thrushes ill-natured
towards the smaller birds.
Of Chats I have kept the European Wheatear, the South
African Mountain Chat, the Whinchat, the Stonechat, and Redstart,
all of them amiable birds which can be safely trusted in an aviary
with finches. I also found the American Blue-bird (Blue Robin)
peaceful; but the Shama I have always kept in a flight-cage. The
English Robin I have kept both in cage and aviary ; it is a most
fascinating little bird, but too tame by nature to be confined at all ;
I much prefer to see it at liberty.* Of the common Nightingale I
have kept both hand-reared and trapped examples, but found them
disappointing as regards their song: in my opinion a captive
Nightingale’s song is very inferior to that of its free brother; it is
uncertain and scrappy. I have two gramophone records of the song
of a captive bird produced in Germany : they are very fair repro¬
ductions of that of the majority of caged Nightingales, but there is
no comparison between them and the songs which I have heard in
the Kentish woods and copses.
With the Warblers I have had less success than I should
have liked : my hand-reared Lesser Whitethroats died very young.
I kept a Blackcap for some time but eventually it was killed by a
Parrakeet ; a Garden Warbler lived for ten months in one of my
aviaries but died from disease of the lungs ; a Gold-crest which I
had, refused to eat, and only survived for about twenty-four hours :
it was brought to me, or I should not have attempted to keep it.
Willow-Warblers caught in my garden would eat so long as they
were provided with living insects, but as soon as these failed they
died; they ignored soft food although they saw other birds eating it,
so I soon gave up catching them. My hand-reared Sedge-Warbler
only lived about two months.
I have kept many Hedge-Accentors and I once caught, and
for a time kept, a young Alpine Accentor : they are not attractive
either as cage or aviary-birds, for they take a long time to become
reconciled to captivity ; or perhaps to the proximity of mankind,
since they always seemed happy enough when they could not see
* The Robin is sometimes a dangerous associate for other small birds
which it has been known to kill by piercing the skull with its bill.

me ; but I rarely heard one sing even in an aviary : I have found
both Warblers and Accentors quite safe companions for the smallest
finches, but one of the latter killed some Pipits as I note further on.
I have kept two Mocking-birds (Mimus polyglottus) : they
are always excellent songsters ; but my first bird, which I purchased
from Abrahams, was far more talented than the second. If kept in
an aviary with other birds they are mischievous, owing to the
pleasure which they take in scaring their associates : their flight is
noiseless, and they can turn and twist in the air in a marvellous
manner: they are hardy and easy to keep, almost as graceful as
Wagtails and altogether fascinating.
Of the Jay-Thrushes I have only kept two species :—the
Collared Jay-Thrush, a very handsome bird which became tame
enough in time, but which had such a penetrating and monotonous
wdiistle that at times it was quite exasperating, and the Spectacled
Thrush, which is said to have a delightful song ; my bird however
only uttered a few notes, owing perhaps to the fact that it was not
in vigorous health, since it only lived with me for about three
months. Although I saw several examples of this species in a small
aviary at Abrahams’ place flying in company with other Babblers,
Larks, Weavers and Doves, I did not venture to trust my bird in a
mixed community, knowing as I did that the Jay-Thrushes are to
some extent predacious in their habits : perhaps confinement in a
large cage may have shortened its life, but it did not have the same
effect in the case of Garrulax picticollis.
Of the Bed-billed Liothrix I have had dozens of examples,
the majority of which proved to be hens ; but of cock birds I have
owned some superb songsters. I may be wrong, but my experience
has led me to the conclusion that the Indian race is more talented in
this respect than the Chinese, the notes being fuller, more varied,
and better sustained. As is well known this is one of the hardiest
and most pleasing of all imported birds, but it is an inveterate
egg-stealer.
Counting the Spotted-wing&amp;apos; ( Psaroglossa spiloptera ) of which
I wrote in our Magazine n.s. vol. i., pp. 51—54, I have kept five
species of Bulbuls, the others being the Red-vented, Persian, Chinese
and Bed-eared. They are naturally long-lived birds with lively

Dr. A. G. Butler,
dispositions, bright notes as a rule (though the Persian bird far
excels the others as a songster) confiding ; hut jealous of other birds
at whom they swear vigorously if they conceive that the latter are
encroaching upon their rights.
The only Titmice which I have kept are the Ox-eye or Great
Tit, the Coal-Tit in the nestling stage, the Marsh-Tit and the Blue-
Tit. Of these the first is a heartless butcher and far better free than
in captivity; the Blue-Tit is delightful, but unfortunately is very
sensitive to cold, and has a nasty habit of killing and eating the
brains of its invalid brethren ; hut the tameness of hand-reared
Blue-Tits is marvellous. On the whole I found the Marsh-Tit the
most suitable for aviary life.
I have once had the Nuthatch, which I kept in a flight-cage,
but it did not live many weeks with me : it was a pretty bird and I
was sorry when it died. The English Wren I have attempted to
keep once or twice, but I could not persuade it to eat soft food, so
after it had caught all the spiders and small insects in the aviary
into which I had turned it, it speedily died.
Of Wagtails I have had several examples each of the Pied,
the Grey, and the Yellow : I consider them the most graceful and
pleasing of all the British soft-bills : they soon become tame and, if
hand-reared, are astonishingly so : in an aviary of small mixed birds
they are inclined to be somewhat aggressive; hut, as house-pets
with plenty of freedom I know of nothing to approach them. I
have kept ten Meadow-Pipits ; but, though not disagreeable to other
inhabitants of the aviary, they fought each other incessantly ; so
that of the last nine which I purchased at one time some killed one
another, others were killed by a Hedge-Accentor, and eventually
only one hen was left alive : I cannot recommend them therefore as
aviary birds, and as cage-birds they are not much to look at.
I have had one Golden Oriole which lived in a flight-cage for
about two years : it was blind in one eye which possibly may have
been the reason for its uninteresting dulness. It rarely whistled,
and; in spite of its bright colouring, I am afraid I did not grieve
much when it passed away. A Bed-backed Shrike which was caught
in its first year and given to me in 1896 was so wild, ill-tempered
and dirty that I found it more trouble than pleasure : it used plenty

of bad language, but never sang, although there were plenty of song¬
birds round it from which it might have learned to sing well, as
some members of its species do. A young Spotted Flycatcher which
had stunned itself by flying against a street lamp was brought to me,
but I could not induce it to eat, so that it died the day following.
Forcible feeding rarely has satisfactory results.
Of the Swallows I have only had hand-reared House and
Sand-Martins, as noted in my little article on rearing British birds,
and of White-eyes I have only kept the Chinese species; a pair of
which was given to me by the late Joseph Abrahams : I found them
altogether charming, though at first they were rather delicate.
Tanagers I regard as ideal pets for the bird-lover : they are
not only, for the most part, splendid in colouring, but they are by
no means difficult to keep, provided that their flight is sufficiently
large to enable them to take plenty of exercise and a daily bath ;
they usually become confiding fairly quickly, so that they will take
mealworms, caterpillars or spiders from one’s fingers, and some of
them, in addition to the harsh song which many of them possess,
occasionally sing very prettily. Unfortunately they are rather
expensive birds, so that I have only kept five species:—seven
Superb Tanagers (purchased) ; two Archbishop Tanagers (given to
me by our present editor) ; two male Scarlet Tanagers (purchased) ;
two young Black Tanagers (given to me by Mr. Teschemaker), but
which owing to delay on the railway were so weakened that they
both died within two months of their arrival ; and one male Orange¬
billed Tanag&amp;apos;er which unhappily also only survived for a similar
period after I purchased it. Of these fourteen birds the two Scarlet
Tanagers and one Archbishop are still in excellent health.

Mr. Hubert D. Astley,
THE REED WARBLER.
Acrocephahts streperus.
By Hubert D. Astley.
Before very long the hosts of summer immigrants will com¬
mence to wend their way northwards, and amongst them towards
the end of April or beginning of May the dainty little Reed Warblers
will return to marshy and swampy localities, to dense thickets of
reed and sedge, climbing amongst the aquatic herbage, and seldom
going on the ground. It is not a particularly shy bird, although it
objects to coming out into open places, but it can be observed in the
early part of the spring before the rushes and sedges, which it loves,
have become thick and tall as the summer goes on.
The nest, as is well shown in Mr. Symonds’ excellent photo¬
graphs, is carefully suspended on the stems of the reeds, three stems
as a rule being woven round to sustain it. It is composed exter¬
nally of dry grass, with small pieces of wool studded about it ; the
interior having a layer of moss, and lined with sheep’s wool, willow
flax and feathers. I once found a Cuckoo’s egg in such a nest (not
an unusual site, I believe \ although I could never quite make up
my mind that it did not belong to a Marsh Warbler, and how the
Cuckoo managed to cling on to the slender stems of the reeds and
place the egg in the nest was a puzzle. At any rate, it could not
have laid it there. The nest I found was very deep, and was built
in the reeds (not over water) which grew in a large copse of
willows.
The Reed Warbler is an incessant songster, especially during
the hours of twilight. On calm summer evenings the music of
these birds has a charm all its own.
Mr. Stevenson wrote :—“ Its lavish notes are associated in my
mind with many a calm summer’s night in the open broads, the
stars shining brightly overhead, and the soft breeze sighing through
the rustling reeds. All is still, save those murmuring sounds that
seem to lull to sleep. Presently, as if by magic, the reed-birds on
all sides are teeming with melody ; now here, now there, first one
then another and another of the reed-birds pour forth their rich
mocking notes, taken up again and again by others.”

The Reed Warblers are later in arriving in their breeding
quarters than the fussy little chattering Sedge Warblers, and in the
first week in June are at the height of their singing.
Mr. William Farren writes: — “ Retiring as all the Acro-
cephali undoubtedly are, their wonderful industry in song suggests
that the skulking is not so much for concealment as because their
livelihood is so closely connected with the insects and small aquatic
creatures that abound on the stems of the plants. But when
singing they frequently leave the cover for more exposed positions ;
the Reed Warbler may be seen perched on a high reed, and some¬
times it sings as it flits from one reed-bed to another.”
Although Stevenson has written of the melodious notes of
the Reed Warbler, there is much in the song, as Mr. Farren has
written, that is harsh and incoherent, but the Reed Warbler’s notes
are less grating than those of the Sedge Warbler.
Naumann described it as resembling the syllables tiri, tiri,
tiri, tier, tier, tier, zack, ziick, zack, zack, zerr, zerr, zerr, tiri, tiri,
scherk, scherk, scherk, tret, tret, tret. These Acrocephali are great
mimics, especially the Sedge Warbler and the Marsh Warbler.
The subject of these notes is not so generally distributed in
England as the Sedge Warbler, and is more numerous on the
Eastern side than the Western.
Over the greater part of Europe this bird is common as a
breeding species. In Switzerland it is common, breeding even at
an altitude of 4,000 feet. As far as is known its range in its African
winter quarters is extensive, occurring as far south as Rhodesia,
the Orange River Colony, and even Cape Colony.

[The following note, which may interest readers of the Magazine, is
extracted from a letter sent to me by Mr. W. K. Pomeroy, F.Z.S., a generous
donor of valuable birds and beasts to the Zoological Gardens.—R. I. POCOCK.]
“ Camp Rio Recio, Colombia.
“ ... I am now camped on a ridge looking over the Rio Recio, a
river which comes down from the snowy mountain, Tolima, about twenty miles
away. The view is simply magnificent, forest-clad mountains and meadows
with the snowy range in the background. In the precipitous forest by the river
is the home of the Cock of the Rock. It seems rather strange that they should
be found here in a temperate climate at an altitude of 6,500 feet, for although in
the day the weather is like June at home, at night it is much colder.
“ I was surprised at finding them so common. They have a habit, which
will be fatal to them as soon as the plume-hunters discover their haunts, of
assembling every afternoon in a particular part of the forest to have a grand
singing match. It is a wonderful sight to see them all collected together like a
lot of brilliant vermilion flowers. They build in the precipitous rocks by the
river, and as the forest down to the river’s brink is as steep as the side of a house
and absolutely impenetrable unless by cutting a path through the undergrowth,
it is not easy to find the nests, even if one could rear the young ones. I have
seen one empty nest near a bridge, and am employing a man to look for the nests
as well as those of the Colombian Trogon, which builds in holes in trees, and
would be an even more difficult job than the Cocks of the Rock.
The assembling places of the Cocks of the Rock are called Gcillineros cle los
Gallos de Monte, the fowl-yards of the Cocks of the Forest. Humboldt mentions
these birds as being sold in cages by the Indians at the cataract of the Orinoco.
However I am afraid my chance of getting living specimens is small, the people
here, unlike my friends on the Rio Cesar, having no idea of catching or taming
anything.”
SIR, — Mr. P. F. M. Galloway’s note on an early brood of Partridges at
Silchester Manor Farm is of interest, but he does not say if lie saw them, or how
many, or date first seen ?
He states “a fortnight ago,” and assuming Mr. Galloway wrote on
February 24th, that makes the birds hatch on February 10th, and the hen bird
must have begun to sit by January 20th, and to have begun laying by January 1st
at latest.
Perhaps Mr. Galloway would kindly give us some details.

PROSPECTUS.
Mr. Walpole-Bond is well known as a student
of birds in the field, and this book is the outcome of
much experience and persistent observation.
The birds which form the subjects of these
Field-Studies are amongst those which are rare as
nesting species in this country, or scarce and difficult
to locate, and thus comparatively seldom observed.
The author has been able during a number of
years of very active field-work, to gain a wide ex¬
perience of these birds and to make such close and
intimate observations of their habits that much of
the information conveyed in these pleasantly written
essays has the charm of novelty and the value of
originality.
The scope of the book is indicated by the
following titles of chapters :—

(Continued from &amp;apos;page 194.)
Picture an ancient Manor House built for the most part of
grey stone, brought from a quarry in one of the wooded hills near
by, a house with gabled roofs and moss-grown stone tiles. Grey
walls that have been standing since the reign of Edward III., 1340.
A house added to or perhaps partly restored in the time of Queen
Elizabeth, with a remodelling to a small portion of it in that of
Queen Anne. One storey high, but covering a large square of
ground surrounded by the moat, and itself in turn surrounding a
court-yard, the latter paved, the paving stones interrupted by beds of
lavender and monthly roses. In the centre an oil stone font of the
15th Century, or maybe a stoop for holy water. Italian, and dis¬
covered in a carpenter’s yard in Italy.
Only on the west side ; that is where the house shows all
three episodes of its existence, Gothic, Elizabethan and good Queen
Anne; on that side there is a length of lawn, just wide enough to
give room to the great cedar planted by the poet Wordsworth, yet
not wide enough to keep it from spreading great branches of eternal
shade over the moat ; whose water encroaches very much closer to
the house, north, east and south ; within a few feet.
And it is not often, looking through the casement windows
towards any of the four aspects, that some ducks cannot be seen
outside. Walk on to the old stone bridge and w T histle. From the
east side some are sure to come, steaming vigorously round the

corner of the low stone wall which retains the banks. Perhaps
three or four pairs of Tufted Duck and some Summer Duck, which
we always call “ sweety-drops,” to which a child once likened them,
the white stripes and curves on the dark ground colour of the drakes
recalling&amp;apos;, I suppose, peppermint bull’s-eyes !
From the west side another and larger flotilla, headed by the
pair of Black-necked Swans; several Pochard, some Scaup, Chiloe
Widgeon, Brown Call-Ducks, Shelduck, Pinged Teals, Cinnamon
Ducks and others. But I have already mentioned these. A
pair of Golden Eye keep at a distance, and the White-eyed
Pochard never become tame like their commoner, but equally
handsome, cousins. Yet the White-eyes w T ere hatched in cap¬
tivity, and the Common Pochards were caught in a wild state,
as were the Scaup, and the Scaup becomes perfectly tame. At
night, even when their voices are not sounding, one hears the
“plop, plop” of the divers as they dip below; and there are times
when I think they have midnight dances, such a splashing is there ;
wild galops and old-time country dances, none of your languid one-
steps and tangos. They engage the Owls to play the flute perhaps,
for certainly the brown ones perch in the cedar tree and hoot, which
at any rate rhymes with flute ! And the Black-necked Swans are
the “ piccolos.” I love this orchestra. As I lie in bed, with some¬
times the full moon shining through the tracery of the cedar’s stately
boughs, my windows open and the curtains drawn aside, not only do
I listen to the music on the moat, but to the gaggling and grunting of
the Flamingos wading in the pond, separated from the moat at its
north end only by a narrow causeway floored with old red bricks,
edged by irises, and adorned by quite a stately pergola constructed
of large and ancient oak beams and timbers, up which climb roses,
wistaria, honeysuckles, and jasmine; not only do I hear those
quaint, guttural notes, but, as I have already said, there comes a
sudden wild chorus of musically discordant cries from all the cranes
across the meadow, heads uplifted and wings beating&amp;apos; time.
Never does such music distress or disturb me. Unlike one
who, on having the place described to him, answered, “ I suppose
you hear the d-d ducks all night long?” “Yes,” was the
answer, “ and I love it.” I think some people’s minds are not

attuned to Nature’s sounds, nor can they see and hear in the
actions and voices of birds what one sees and hears oneself. If a
bird does not behave as a human, it is called a fool, and even a
d-d fool! I often think that to higher spirits toe might possibly
appear in that light. To them may we not be what apes and
gorillas and kangaroos are to us ? To them we probably appear to
.gibber and jump in foolish ways ; that is, we should appear to, were
those in higher planes not more understanding than we. It is good
to be endowed with a faculty, an insight, an appreciation to see
beauty in everything. There is beauty in the bellow of the blast, as
■Gilbert wrote.
And so that curious rasping grunt of the Flamingos takes me
away to some sunlit lagoon, w T hich I have never seen in this earth
life, where I can picture rank upon rank, squadron after squadron of
the spindle-legged giraffe of the birds, rosy in the full light, rosier
still as the rays of rising and setting sun fall upon them.
This pond at Brinsop is ideal, shallow with a good foundation
■of soft mud, and springs to keep it clear. Eight European and one
of the beautifully coloured Bed Flamingo from Mexico. The eight
Common Flamingos passed last winter at the Wonder Zoo at
Olympia, and when the show was finished Herr Hagenbeck sent
them to me. They arrived at 10.30 p.m. on the 7th of March. I
had given them up, and was going to bed, when a loud banging
at a side door leading into a paved loggia made me exclaim “ The
Flamingos! ” The man who had knocked said that they had
arrived at Hereford (6i miles distant) in such large crates that he
had taken upon himself, with assistance, to remove them and put
them all into a small motor van, loose !
Fetching a lantern, I traversed an orchard to the gate outside
which the taxi stood. When I flashed the light of the lantern to
the window I could have believed that eight damsels, all dressed in
pink and white and showing a good deal of leg, had returned from a
ball, or else from the theatre, where they had taken part in a ballet.
How they had all managed to keep on their legs whilst being driven
rapidly for 6i miles I don’t know, especially as the last 200 yards of
the road was all ruts. My bird-keeper came out, and the odd man.
Four of us tucked a Flamingo under each arm, and stumbling along

in the dark, the Flamingos occasionally pinching&amp;apos; every part of one’s
face, including one’s nose, we landed them for the night in a large
barn.
And next morning the great doors were flung open, and the
corps de ballet stepped out. Oh joy! There was a lovely pond
within a few yards, the mud teeming with water-shrimps, the water
fresh and wind-swept. The contrast after Olympia ! From Olympia
to Elysium ! They all promptly sat down in the water with their
bodies all but immersed, their long necks twisting and writhing
like so many blush-pink snakes. The Red Flamingo withdrew,
haughtily, its nose turned very much down, for a Flamingo
cannot do the opposite. Never had it seen such faded-out things..
But the Europeans were too busy with their ablutions to study
colour, and if they have done so by now they have probably come
to the conclusion that to dress in flaring&amp;apos; shrimp-red is vulgar.
There is nothing left to the imagination, whereas in their case
surprises come when they lift their skirts, as it were, and flash out
rich rosy pink on their wing&amp;apos;s. On still sunny mornings, instead of
nine Flamingos, their number is exactly doubled; upside down are
nine more, so clear and bright are their reflections.
Occasionally there are debates and bickerings, especially
when the Red one claims to be King. Outstretched necks
and long pointed wing feathers raised on the back, looking&amp;apos; un¬
commonly like a Field Marshal’s plumes. At other times, siestas ;
when they stand with the water just touching their breasts, their
necks twisted round, their beaks tucked amongst the feathers of the
back. Then they resemble large water vessels of pale pink enamel,
the twisted neck forming a very distinct handle.
They possibly have their jokes, for one hears guffaws of what
might be laughter, “ Haw, haw,” in guttural tones. And when
feeding they mark time in the mud, the long necks stretched down,
the head immersed, searching for the water insects which they
disturb with their pink w r ebbed feet. There is one part of the pond
which is out of their depth, and until they discovered this they
would swim across it, looking like ungainly swans, the rose-pink
knee joints working up and down beyond the tails.

There are three ways of keeping parrots,—using the term
“ parrot ” in its widest sense to include everything from a Budgerigar
to a Bed and Yellow Macaw. They may be kept in close confine¬
ment in cages or on stands ; they may be kept in aviaries ; and they
may be kept at complete liberty. The first method is the commonest
and the most simple ; the second is the most satisfactory and the
most lucrative; the third is the most attractive and the most
exasperating.
It must be borne in mind that all parrots do not bear close
confinement equally well, and many even of those which will
survive for some years in cages are in reality quite unsuited to cage
life. Anyone, therefore, who desires a parrot as an indoor pet
should make sure of getting a bird which is at least likely to turn
out long-lived, contented and affectionate, even if there is not much
hope of its ever possessing remarkable linguistic talents. Grey
Parrots, Senegals, Amazons, Yasas, Cockatoos, Caiques, some
Conures, Quaker Parrakeets, Brotogerys Parrakeets, and Bud¬
gerigars are all more or less suited to cage life. Some Palceornis
Parrakeets (Bing-necks and their allies) also become very talented
and amusing, but with this family the cocks only should be selected
as pets. A hen Palceornis in close confinement is usually the
dullest bird imaginable.
A parrot cage should be rectangular ; a bell-shaped cage is
apt to spoil the bird’s plumage, as it is always rubbing and pressing
its feathers against the bars whenever it climbs about. Most parrot
cages are provided with a swing, hanging from the top, and a kind of
metal grating at the bottom. The swing may amuse the bird, but as
often as not it only irritates it and gets in its way, in which case it
is best removed. The grating is a senseless contrivance which
serves no useful purpose whatever. It in no way adds to the bird’s
comfort, and greatly increases the difficulty of keeping the cage
clean. A sliding metal tray well covered with grit and sand is all
that is required, and it is important to use enough sand to absorb
the moisture from the droppings before it reaches the tray itself.

The Marquis of Tavistock,
In the case of very valuable or delicate parrots, a metal “ shield,’ 7
shaped like an empty book cover, is useful to put round the back and
sides of the cage as a protection against draughts, but on no account
should the cage be covered with a cloth at night. A large rectangular
cage, three feet or more square, composed of wire netting on a metal
framework and provided with detachable perches of hard wood, a
shield of the kind above mentioned, a sliding zinc tray, and a small
door in the front for the insertion of food, water and baths, will be
found very useful for birds requiring a fair amount of wing and leg
exercise. It is particularly suitable for new arrivals which need a
period of rest and quarantine before they can safely be placed in an
aviary, as well as for aviary birds which cannot be left out-of-doors
during the winter months.
All parrots should be kept constantly supplied with pieces of
soft wood to bite up and amuse themselves with and they should
be allowed baths. An unglazed earthenware dish, shaped like a pie
dish, makes the best form of bath. China dishes will do if nothing
better is available, but they are too slippery and the birds are often
afraid to step into them. Parrots which refuse to bathe should be
gently sprayed or sprinkled with tepid water, or in summer put out
in a shower of rain ; they ought afterwards to be kept in a fairly warm
place until quite dry. Budgerigars never bathe in the ordinary way,
and may be provided with a piece of wet turf in which they are
often fond of rolling. Caged parrots should, if possible, be allowed
out daily for exercise. This is not, of course, absolutely necessary,
but it is very beneficial, and all true bird-lovers wish their pets to&amp;apos;
find the conditions of captivity as little irksome as possible. It
must be borne in mind that parrots are very intelligent birds, loving
variety and amusement, and that when in a wild state many species
take a real pleasure in flying&amp;apos; for its own sake, and do not merely
employ their wings as a means of getting from place to place,,
and of escaping from the attacks of their enemies.
Macaws, on account of their huge size, cannot as a rule be
accommodated in cages, and are usually kept chained by the leg to a
stand. The spectacle of the unfortunate bird perpetually fastened to
the same hard perch until its legs grow stiff and its wings lose their
power is not a very agreeable one, and I would not therefore advise

anyone to keep a Macaw unless it can be given plenty of liberty in
or out of doors, or proper aviary accommodation.
Parrot-keeping in aviaries is, as I have said before, the most
satisfactory and the most remunerative of the three methods. Not
only do the birds usually appear happier and in more perfect
plumage than when confined in cages, but there is also a fair chance
of successful breeding, and a prolific pair of some rare species may
constitute a substantial pecuniary asset to their fortunate owner.
The size of the aviary must, of course, depend upon the
money and space available. As a general rule the larger it is the
better the birds will thrive, but it must not be forgotten that more
satisfactory results are usually obtained when each pair have a
comparatively small compartment to themselves than when the
whole stock is kept together in one large flight. At the same time,
if the species and individuals are carefully chosen (never forget that
with birds as with humans “ extremes meet,” and that while near
relatives may quarrel, distant ones may agree), two, and even three,
pairs may be kept together and rear their young in perfect harmony.
The great secret is to select birds differing considerably in size, and
to make sure that the larger, while being masters of the smaller, are
yet of a gentle disposition and not given to meddling in their
neighbours’ affairs. As an additional precaution the nest boxes
should be provided with entrance holes of different sizes, for parrots,
as a general rule, instinctively select breeding quarters with the
smallest entrances capable of admitting their bodies. A nest box or
barrel should be fixed high—close against the roof, if possible—for
a sitting bird dislikes having her neighbours constantly alighting on
the roof of her home. The bottom should be concave and covered
with a layer of soft decayed wood or sawdust, and the entrance should
be only an inch or two above the level of the floor, otherwise the
young may find difficulty in making their exit.
In building an aviary the materials used must bear some
relation to the destructive powers of the birds which it is intended
to introduce. Ordinary wire netting and stout woodwork will

The Marquis of Tavistock,
require rather stronger netting, and no unprotected woodwork will
long resist their attacks. Large Parrots, Cockatoos and Macaws
can only be kept in by something of the same nature as the metal¬
work which covers the large flight cages at the Zoological Gardens.
The young of certain species of Parrakeets are very apt, on first
leaving the nest, to dash themselves violently against the sides of
the aviary and sustain fatal injuries. It is therefore advisable to
cover, the end at any rate, of a long wire flight with sacking when a
valuable brood is expected to make its appearance.
When Pinches and other small birds are kept in the same
aviary with Parrots, it is advisable to protect the roosting and nesting
quarters of the former with large-mesh wire netting through which
they alone are able to pass. In the open they can, unless very
young, keep out of the way of danger, and it is when asleep or
cornered in a nest-box that they are likely to be caught and injured.
Not all parrots, however, can be trusted in mixed company even
with these precautions. Blue-bonnets and Lovebirds are impossible
neighbours for anything weaker than themselves, and I, personally,
would never trust Conures, Caiques, Lorikeets, Brotogerys Parrakeets
or Budgerigars, though amiable individuals do sometimes occur even
among the most mischievous and aggressive species.
No portion of the interior of a Parrot aviary should ever be
painted or varnished or the most disastrous results will be sure to
follow. Parrots are extraordinarily sensitive to mineral poisons, and
I have found to my cost that Australian Parrakeets, which can stuff
themselves with laburnum seeds and yew buds with absolute
impunity, will die in convulsions within a few hours of nibbling
fragments of painted wood.
Where the aviary consists of an inside shelter and an outside
flight, the former must be absolutely free from draughts. It is best
to arrange for all ventilation to come from the front only. I dislike
top ventilation as it nearly always produces a continued upward
current of air, which draws in from the door and, striking the birds
underneath, is very likely to cause enteritis.
If artificial heat is provided it is very important to secure an
even temperature irrespective of outdoor weather conditions. This
is by no means easy to arrive at, and I have always obtained far

better results from the use of a stove or gas radiator than from any
system which involves the employment of hot-water pipes, which
are usually most ineffective and troublesome. When turning birds
into an aviary for the first time it is a wise precaution, where an
inner compartment exists, to shut them up for the first few nights.
It may also be advisable, especially if the nights are cold, to give a
little artificial heat, even though they may not previously have been
kept in a warm room.. Parrots, when first placed in unfamiliar
quarters, have a perfect genius for selecting the draughtiest and
most exposed places to roost in, and it is most disheartening to turn
a valuable breeding pair into a new aviary and then to go out next
morning to find the cock or hen dead of enteritis. I have more than
once experienced this calamity in the case of species reputed to be
extremely hardy.
In concluding these hints on aviary management, it will be
well to say something about the important art of bringing birds into
breeding condition. This is chiefly a matter of feeding, and with
Parrots, more perhaps than with any other class of birds, are satis¬
factory breeding results dependent on the judicious provision of extra
dainties at the right moment. Green food must be supplied ad
libitum , and it is particularly important to continue giving it after
the young have hatched. Grass, chickweed, shepherd’s purse&gt;
dandelion, sow thistle and lettuce are all good, as well as the shoots
and leaves of non-poisonous trees. Lettuce is sometimes said to be
bad for Parrots, but I have given it to Cockatoos, Amazons,
Platycerci, Eclecti and Grass Parrakeets and never found it in the
least degree injurious; it must of course be perfectly fresh and
unfrosted. When at liberty in this country the Australian Parra¬
keets feed their young largely on the leaves and flowers of the
common daisy, and although I cannot say I have ever offered the
plant to my aviary birds, I have not the slightest reason to suppose
that it would prove harmful. Fruit, particularly apple, is an
important item in the menu during the breeding season, and meal¬
worms may also be offered, though not all Parrots will eat them.
A full ration of hemp and sunflower should be supplied in most cases,
though this can generally be reduced again, with advantage, after the
moult is over.

The Marquis of Tavistock,
In giving green food, etc., do not think that because the birds
will not touch it the first time it is offered that it is no use trying it
again. Many Parrots are extremely suspicious of new foods, and
only summon up courage to try an unfamiliar article of diet after it
has been placed before them many times. Do not grow discouraged,
either, if they only seem to touch the tiniest fragment of what is
given them. Little as they may actually eat, it may make the
whole difference between eggs and no eggs, or between fertile eggs
and clear ones.
When it is desired to breed from a hen bird which has been
kept for a very long period in a cage, it is often prudent to keep her
for some time alone in the aviary on a very plain diet before intro¬
ducing her mate and the nest barrel. In this way the risk of
egg-binding is a good deal lessened.
The plan of keeping a number of parrots at liberty is one
which not many aviculturists will care to attempt since the con¬
ditions indispensable to success are not to be found everywhere and
heavy losses are likely to be sustained, especially at the outset of
the experiment. Nevertheless there is a charm about it which
atones for many disappointments, and successes, when they do come,
are perhaps all the better appreciated for the failures which may
have gone before. The beauty of the birds’ plumage is certainly
most apparent when they are living in complete freedom, partly
because they attain a depth and brilliance of colour seldom seen,
even among the inhabitants of the largest and best-kept aviaries.
There is, too, the satisfactory knowledge that if a true pair can only
be induced to stay they are practically certain to make an attempt
at breeding, and the results are likely to be satisfactory ; for, while
bad weather and accidents do, often enough, spoil one’s hopes, infertile
eggs and neglected young are almost unknown where birds are nest¬
ing under more or less natural conditions. Lastly, there are many
interesting facts brought to light about the wild life of both rare
and common species which can never be discovered as long as the
birds are in any degree confined.
The three conditions most necessary to success are:—
(l) Good winter cover. (2) Good natural nesting accommodation.

instantly trying to shoot it.
A really thick spruce wood provides about the best form of
winter cover, but any kind of tall, dense evergreen will answer the
purpose well enough. Abies orientalis gives even better shelter than
abies excelsa, but is seldom found planted in any other way than as
a single specimen tree.
For nesting purposes English trees unfortunately appear to
furnish very indifferent accommodation, especially for Long-tailed
Parrakeets, which will sometimes spend many weeks in an unsuc¬
cessful search after a home to suit their taste, and finally leave the
neighbourhood in disgust never to return.
Very old oaks, elms, beeches and poplars are most likely to
provide Parrots with habitable quarters, and where these are absent
some good may be done by fixing up artificial nest barrels. These
should alwavs be placed as far from the ground as possible, and
where small or medium-sized birds are kept they should have
entrance holes narrow enough to keep out Brown and White Owls,
which are apt to play havoc among the nestling and sitting hens.
To exclude a Barn Owl the hole should not be more than
2f-inches in diameter ; to exclude a Brown Owl 3|-inches, 2-f-inches
will keep out a Jackdaw, and 2|-inches a Little Owl.
Cockatoos, the larger Parrakeets, and, in fact, most members
of the Parrot family are usually, in the first instance, best turned
with cut wings into a roomy grass enclosure out of which they
cannot climb. If released full-winged they are more than likely to
be lost at once, but where the other plan is adopted their powers of
flight are restored gradually during the course of the moult, and they
are for a long time only capable of going short distances in the
neighbourhood of their home.
The enclosure, w 7 hich should contain no valuable trees or
shrubs (since cut-winged Parrots are ten times more destructive
than those which are able to fly) must be provided with plenty of
branches for the birds to perch on, good temporary shelter from rain
and wind, and a feeding tray of the same pattern as those on which
the birds will find their seed after they have scattered about the
wood or garden in which it is hoped that they will make their home.

The Marquis op Tavistock,
A certain amount of trouble is often caused by fighting, and it is an
unfortunate fact that where both assailant and victim are unable to
fly, the latter for some reason has usually great difficulty in making
its escape. The only plan is to shut up the worst offenders—usually
old cocks in breeding condition—until such time as their mates, if
they have any, are able to fly, when they may be allowed to join
them without much risk of straying.
Very tame Amazon Parrots and Macaws can generally be
allowed the full use of their wings from the first; but it is desirable
that they should become thoroughly familiar with their surroundings
before being released, and it is also well to allow them a little
preliminary flying practice in an aviary or large room. It some¬
times happens that Parrots which have been long confined in cages
are very clumsy and erratic in their flight during the first few days
of their unaccustomed liberty, and having settled in a tall tree they
will starve for many hours before they can summon up courage to
attempt a descent to the ground. Lovebirds should also be released
full-winged after having been kept for some weeks in an aviary
containing a feeding tray of the same appearance as those they
will find outside. They behave like small Finches similarly treated,
and seldom give trouble by straying on the day they receive full
liberty. In dealing&amp;apos; with Cockatoos, Lorikeets and certain Parra-
keets, it is sometimes safe in the case of mated pairs more or less in
breeding condition to allow the male bird to fly, and some weeks
later, when he has become thoroughly familiar with his surroundings,
to permit his wife to join him. In following this plan it is of vital
importance that the hen should remain in full view of her mate
when he first goes out, and it is most risky to attempt it unless the
mutual affection of the two birds is obviously very great indeed.
When new arrivals will find other individuals of their own
species already at liberty the necessity for wing-cutting may or may
not exist, and will depend on circumstances. In the case of sociable
and highly gregarious kinds the strangers may usually be expected
to join their companions at liberty and give no trouble, especially if
they are released one at a time. On the other hand, in dealing with
birds not particularly sociable and gregarious, considerable care
must be taken, or losses will be sure to follow. Let us take the

Platycercince as an illustration. If you have three adult pairs of
Rosellas flying at large and desire to add to your stock by importa¬
tion, it is perfectly useless to turn the new birds out full-winged
in the hope that the others will induce them to stay; they will do
no such thing, and will only bully them and accelerate their depar¬
ture. If you have a small flock of young Rosellas which have not
yet paired, the case is rather different, and it is usually safe to allow
other young birds and even adult cocks to join them full-winged.
Adult hens, on the other hand, are intolerant of the presence of
young birds which do not belong to them, and are apt to resent
rather than welcome their company. If you have an old unpaired
cock at liberty and provide him with a wife, the latter may be
allowed to fly out and join him as soon as he begins to show an
active interest in her and visits the cage or aviary in which she is
confined. If you have a hen at liberty and get a cock to turn out
with her, the latter must be more or less in breeding condition before
he is released (particularly in the case of Parrakeets). If he is not,
the hen will either ill-treat or ignore him, and he will probably be
soon lost. Unmated Parrots of either sex will, unless very tame and
attached to their owners, wander off in search of a companion as
soon as the nesting season approaches. Cockatoos, however, which
have nested at liberty and afterwards lost their mates, seldom
leave altogether. Occasionally, when a mate cannot be obtained
for a solitary bird, a companion of the same sex will console it
sufficiently to prevent it from straying and getting lost.
Assuming that the first stage of the acclimitization experi¬
ment has gone off well and the inherent tendency of most Parrots
to wander on being released has been in some manner restrained,
future success will depend largely on the constant supply of seed or
other food, preferably in more than one place if a number of birds
are kept. Any system of feeding on what I may term an “ open ”
tray or board is quite impracticable, as after a very short time
immense hordes of Sparrows, Starlings, Greenfinches, Pigeons, Jack¬
daws and other unwelcome visitors will be attracted to the spot,
and it will cost a perfect fortune to feed them and the Parrots at
the same time. It is therefore necessary to employ a 11 trap-tray,”
i.e., a feeding tray which can, at a moment’s notice, be converted

The Marquis of Tavistock,
into a kind of box-trap for the capture of unbidden guests. The
■simplest form of trap-tray is a kind of box consisting of a stout
metal framework covered with wire netting, the mesh being suffi¬
ciently fine to exclude mice. Two of the sides, at right angles to
each other, are fastened to the top by means of hinges in such a
way that by placing a T-shaped prop at the corner of the trap, the
two sides can be simultaneously kept raised on a level with the top
and the birds allowed to pass under them and reach the food con¬
tained in the shallow metal tray (perforated with two or three holes
for drainage purposes) which lies on the floor. One end of a line is
fastened to the stem of the prop and the other is carried behind a
screen erected at some little distance, and so arranged that a person
behind it can observe the birds feeding on the tray without making
himself visible to them. A sharp pull at the line from behind the
screen causes the prop to jump away, thereby releasing the sides,
which fall downwards and inwards by their own weight, and the
trap-tray becomes a closed box. Electric bell-wire makes the best
line ; common string is most dangerous, as with the first shower of
rain it shrinks considerably and pulls the trap shut by reason of the
increasing tension,—usually selecting for the manoeuvre a moment
when those birds are feeding on the tray which it is least desired to
interfere with. Where there is any chance of meddlesome persons
working the trap out of mischief or for the purpose of catching and
•stealing the Parrots, it is advisable to lock the end of the line in a
small box fastened securely to the back of the screen, which should
in this case be of a very substantial description. If this is done, it
is impossible for anyone to pull the line without first showing himself
to the birds and scaring them away to safety.
In the centre of the top of the trap there should be a small
hinged 1 door ” which can be opened for the insertion of the hand
and arm when the sides have fallen and the birds have been caught.
The whole contrivance can either be placed on the ground or on
some kind of raised stand. In the latter case it is usually wise to
peg the line down, or rather to run it through swivels on the ground
level, for if it is swinging loose, large birds flying against it or falling
branches of trees striking it are apt to dislodge the prop at incon¬
venient moments. When the trap-tray is on the ground it is as

well to shut it at night, anyhow during the winter ; otherwise the
seed attracts enormous quantities of mice, which in turn attract the
Owls,—and then good-bye to your smaller Parrakeets 1
I need hardly say that the Parrots themselves should never
be caught on the trap except in case of illness or other urgent
necessity. Not only does it make them exceedingly shy of returning
to feed, but there is always a slight risk of their being struck and
injured by the falling sides.
Lastly, it is, as I have already pointed out, absolutely neces¬
sary to familiarise them thoroughly with the appearance of the tray
before they receive their liberty. As a general rule, the larger the
bird the longer it will take to learn to recognise a trap-tray,
wherever encountered, as the “ fons et origo ” of a good square meal.
The ailments of parrots are many and various, and of all
birds they make the worst patients, since owing to the peculiar
formation and immense power of the mandibles it is almost
impossible to forcibly administer in effective quantities either food
or medicine, which, when really sick, they usually refuse to touch
voluntarily. In most cases there is only one remedy to be tried,
viz., heat, and it must be real heat,—a temperature of 85°—90°
evenly maintained night and day, and not merely the comfortable
warmth of a living room at 60° (which probably drops to 45° during
the course of the night). The effect ef great heat on a sick Parrot
is often little short of marvellous, and I would strongly recommend
everyone who owns a valuable collection of tropical or semi-tropical
birds to have a small room specially fitted up as a “baking”
hospital. Like the tiger recommended in the Bad Child’s Book of
Beasts to overburdened parents, “ it well repays the trouble and
expense,” and time and time again it will save a rare treasure which
otherwise would inevitably be lost.
I will now deal briefly with some of the commoner Parrot
ailments, their symptoms, and what I have found from my own
experience to be the best treatment :—
ENTERITIS. —One of the most frequent and fatal of bird diseases.
With Parrots, generally due to chill, but sometimes caused
by the presence of some irritant or poison in the bowels.
The affected bird puffs its feathers, shivers, and often sits with

The Marquis of Tavistock,
its head under its wing (to use a common, if incorrect, expres¬
sion). The eye appears dull, and there is little or no appetite.
Heat is the only really effective treatment, and if the bird is
not too far gone will generally effect a cure. Little benefit is
likely to be derived from medicine or dieting, as the patient will
hardly touch food until it begins to mend. Where enteritis is
due to the swallowing of some irritant such as paint or varnish
the symptoms are more acute, and convulsions and paralysis of
the legs may ensue. Kecovery will depend on the strength of
the bird’s constitution and the quantity of poison taken, and
little or nothing can be done but to keep it warm and quiet,
hope for the best and expect the worst !
PLEURISY. —Often accompanied by pericarditis. Symptoms much
the same as those of enteritis. Generally fatal in a few hours.
Warmth the only remedy.
Inflammation of the Lungs. —Due to chill. The bird pants
heavily and breathes noisily, the eye remaining fairly bright.
It seldom puts its head under its wing as the labour of breathing
is thereby increased. Treatment : Great heat and a fairly moist
atmosphere.
BRONCHITIS. — Generally due to chill. Symptoms much the same
as those of inflammation of the lungs. In enough distilled
water to last for a week’s supply put 30 grains of carbonate
of ammonia, 30 drops of tincture of squills, and 50 drops of
glycerine, and give the mixture instead of plain water. There
is often no marked loss of appetite. Keep in a very warm and
rather moist atmosphere.
PERITONITIS.—Generally the result of some internal injury, and
almost invariably fatal in a few hours. The symptoms of
chronic peritonitis are sometimes indistinguishable from those
of tuberculosis, the bird feeding w T ell, but showing extreme
emaciation and some diarrhoea.
TUBERCULOSIS. — Most commonly met with in Cockatoos.
Symptoms : Emaciation and diarrhoea, and, in acute cases,
vomiting. A tame bird may become extremely savage, probably
under the influence of pain. The appetite usually remains
good. Tuberculosis is by no means so incurable as some

writers imagine, even when it has reached a very advanced
stage. The bird should be kept extremely warm and fed on
every kind of rich and stimulating food which it can be per¬
suaded to take,—unlimited quantities of hemp and sunflower
seed should be offered, cake and even meat, anything, in fact,
which will not irritate the bowels. Avian tuberculosis (which
is not known to be communicable to human beings) is seldom
pulmonary, and fresh air—in the sense of a constant supply of
outdoor air—is of no use whatever in effecting a cure. Far
more birds develop tuberculosis in outdoor aviaries than in
cages. The disease is highly contagious, but the germs do not
appear to be carried by the air.
SEPTIC Fever. —The term popularly employed to designate a
highly contagious malady possibly allied to tuberculosis,
though wholly distinct from it. The disease is most commonly
found among the newly-imported birds which have been over¬
crowded in dirty travelling boxes ; but, once introduced, it will
flourish indefinitely in the cleanest and best-kept aviaries in
defiance of the most thorough attempts at disinfection. The
necessity for a lengthy period of quarantine in the case of all
freshly imported birds likely to be suffering from the disease is
therefore obvious. The micro-organism of septic fever is
possessed of immense vitality, both as regards its power of
surviving for long periods without a living host, and of resist¬
ing the action of disinfectants. It is also singularly, at times
bewilderingly, capricious in its attacks. The disease appears
in two forms, the acute and the chronic, the former being by
far the most common. Both are incurable, and the symptoms
are very similar to those of enteritis, the bird’s eye always
appearing sick, dull and watery.
Grey Parrot “ Fever.” —A highly contagious disease often found
among newly-imported Grey Parrots, Posocephalus Parrots
(Senegals, etc.), and Blue-bonnets. It is caused by the presence
of a diplo-coccus in the blood, and is entirely distinct from
ordinary septic fever, though it resembles that disease in its
symptoms. Cases of recovery are extremely rare, but are not
quite unknown. Great heat is the only remedy to try.

Some Hints on Parrot-Keeping.
FEATHER-PLUCKING. —Is generally due to improper feeding, but
may be also caused by lack of occupation, parasites, or,
more rarely, by anxiety to breed where no opportunity
is allowed of doing so. A feather-plucker should be
placed on a plain diet of canary, millet, wheat and oats
with dry bread and unlimited fruit and green food. It should
be freely supplied with soft, rotten wood, and small branches
to bite up and amuse itself with, and should be allowed as
much freedom and exercise as possible. Baths should be
freely supplied, and if the bird refuses to bathe it should be
sprayed daily with quassia solution,—a dessert spoonful of
essence of quassia to a tumbler of tepid water where the
presence of parasites is suspected. Liberty to roam at will
with a cut wing in a large grass enclosure will cure the most
inveterate feather-plucker that ever existed.
LOSS OF Feathers. —Apparently due to debility. The bird
becomes entirely destitute both of down and feathers, the head
being often the first part to become bare. The disease which
renders its unfortunate victim a most grotesque and unsightly
object, is generally very intractable. It is best to keep the
patient fairly warm, allow it plenty of exercise and occupation,
and feed it on a nourishing and varied diet. A few drops of
Parrish’s Chemical Food should be placed in the drinking
water.
FRENCH Moult. —A popular term denoting a chronic inability to
produce fully-developed feathers, particularly in the wings and
tail, the bird being usually unable to fly more than a few yards
owing to its primarus being very small and malformed. French
moult is most commonly seen in Budgerigars, which are the
offspring of nearly-related, immature, or weakly parents, but it
sometimes occurs among other species, and is often met with
among Hooded Parrakeets which have been caught too young
and received a severe check in their early youth. Treatment,
which is seldom efficacious, should be the same as that recom¬
mended for birds suffering from loss of feathers.

The Indian Shamah is very well known to all aviculturists.
Amongst the many foreigners which come to us, there are probably
very few which can be kept with so little trouble, and possibly none
so delightfully tame and attractive in disposition, as well as charm¬
ing in appearance.
My bird, “ Bob ” (whose photograph is reproduced) possesses
a character and personality which quite separate him from any other
bird I have ever kept.
In common with, as I understand, practically all the
Shamahs in captivity, he was tame and confiding from the time of
his arrival, although nothing like so familiar as he has since become.
His song is extraordinarily varied, and particular bars are
reserved for certain purposes. For instance, “ Mealworms, please,”
is invariably expressed by certain notes not utilised at other times.
When the cage is opened in the morning for cleaning and
feeding purposes, my lively little “ pal ” generally manages to slip
out, and entertains me with one or two of his best selections from
the top of some picture or other point of vantage, until he considers
it time to return home for breakfast.
His powers of mimicry, like other members of his family, are
remarkable. A few mornings ago I was puzzled by a new whistle
which he produced loudly several times in succession, until I
remembered the starlings which are constantly whistling and
chattering in the trees outside the windows. He has also picked
up the not very musical squeak of a young Bock Thrush in the
next cage.
Charming and amenable as he is with human beings, I regret
to say “ Bob ” is a perfect tyrant where his own kind are concerned,
and always ready—not to say anxious—to tackle anything with
feathers on it. For this reason I have been obliged to keep him in
solitary confinement, and as he never dashes wildly about his cage
his plumage is always perfect.
It is difficult, even by the use of colour sensitive plates, to
differentiate between the blue-black of head and throat and the

When trying, as I do in various ways, to get the members of
our Society to take an interest in some of our Northern birds, I am
never quite sure whether I should be best likened to a Pelican in
the wilderness or to a Sparrow sitting alone on the house-top. The
distinction is perhaps not material, but I do think it would be of
great advantage to the Society if members could be induced to take
more interest in birds occasionally found within the limits of the
British Isles. To give a few examples. There are few more inter¬
esting birds in their way than Water-Rails. They are always in
good feather, quite easy to keep, and look most charming running in
and out of rough herbage in a large grass run. There are lots of
details about their nesting habits which are still, I believe, obscure ;
yet does anyone ever make an attempt to try to get them to nest in
captivity ? If the attempt has been made a record of the result
would be interesting. It is worthy of note that Land-Rails have
readily nested, and the Australian Rails nest several times a season
even under adverse conditions.
Another example is the Turnstone. I wonder how many of the
somewhere about 420 members of the Society ever keep these birds or
take any interest in their quaint turnings of stones. I have always
found Turnstones quite at home in captivity, and ready to assume
breeding plumage at the right season ; and if I had the time and
money nothing would give me personally greater pleasure than to
make experiments with a view of getting them to nest. I gather
(from what is not stated in the Natural Histories) there is still
something to learn about their nesting habits.
Another most interesting bird — or rather, I should say, a
bird that one would have supposed to be interesting had the facts

next stated been otherwise—is the Red-necked Phalarope. Yet I
doubt if at this time more than one member of the Society has any
of them in captivity. When once established they do very well, and
are delightfully tame. A photographer will compass sea and land to
get a few photos of Phalaropes, when with a little more trouble he
might view perfectly healthy Phalaropes, at a yard or two distant,
all the year round.
Again, the Editor inserted in the February number of
the Magazine a note asking any member of the Society who
had practical experience of keeping Grebe in captivity to com¬
municate with me. I have not had a single communication
of any description in answer to the enquiry, which seems
to point to the fact that no one takes an interest in these
birds. I am sorry, as I wanted in the interests of aviculture
to get some Slavonian Grebe for the Zoo, or for some suitable
member of the Society who has a place for these birds. [I shall
be delighted to try them on my moat, which has plenty of small
dace in it. And I have a beautiful place for Phalaropes, if I could
only obtain them.—-E d.] Of course the real trouble is how to
manage them and feed them on the voyage to England. When
swimming with their young round them in their native haunts
they look to me very attractive birds.
To mention another Northern bird ; it has often occurred to
me that it would be delightful to see a Great Northern Diver or two
swimming at the Zoo. Mr. Beebe once reared one from an egg, and
a captive bird has been kept in the New York Aquarium.
Two years ago I had some nests watched in Iceland, and got
eight eggs over here for incubation. The experiment was a failure,
probably owing to the eggs being shaken in transit. They were
•certainly nearly all fresh. There seems no reason, however, why
another attempt should not be more successful if anyone is
sufficiently interested in Great Northern Divers to make further
attempts.
The last bird I should like to mention is not, strictly
speaking, a Northern bird, though it used to visit the British Isles.
I refer to the Black-winged Stilt. If anyone is keeping this bird I
hope he will tell particulars to the other members of the Society-

Dr. A. G. Butler,
Personally I have never heard of it being kept in captivity in
England, though this has been done successfully in the South of
Spain, whence it can be obtained. Certainly the public took great
interest in the young Avocet at the Zoo a few years ago. Would
Stilts be more difficult to keep than Avocets, and, if so, why ?
The above are only a few instances of birds that seem to me
to be neglected by aviculturists, but if I am wrong no one will be
more delighted than myself. If experts as to all or any of these
birds exist, I sincerely hope they will not keep to themselves the
results of their experience, for
“ What delights can equal those
That stir the spirit’s inner deeps,
When one that loves but knows not reaps
A truth from one that loves and knows ? ”

It is probably supposed, because my first avicultural book
was “Foreign I inches in Captivity,” that Finches are my favourite
birds ; but this is far from being the case. They are easy to provide
for ; but, with a few exceptions, are by no means easy to breed
unless one possesses large and suitable outdoor aviaries : indoors
they are more subject to egg-binding than most birds. They
certainly do not possess the intelligence or the endearing confidence
of most soft-billed birds ; still they are pretty, some of them beau¬
tiful in plumage, and the small size of many of them renders them
charming. I have at various times kept the following :—
A pair of the Madeiran Chaffinch which I kept in a flight-
cage : quiet tame birds, which I might perhaps have bred in an
aviary, but which made no attempt to do so in a cage. The cock
bird sang well, the performance being more varied and longer, but
with a strong resemblance to that of the European bird. Of the
latter I have kept many examples, mostly caught in the garden in
the winter months. Bird-catchers assert that there are two forms

of Chaffinch in England which they call chuckwados and kiss-me-dears,
from the terminal notes of the songs chucha churr” and “ tissi-
ear ” or “ wheatear ” : they consider the Essex birds the best song¬
sters. For many years I had a fine Essex bird (a chuckiuado), it
certainly was a very strong singer. Of Bramblings I have kept a
fair number; but, unless kept with Weavers or other powerful birds
they are quarrelsome and dangerous, though cowardly ; their song
is ruined by its harsh terminal note
I have hardly ever been without several Goldfinches, for I
consider them the most beautiful of our British Finches ; in an
aviary they are masterful, but not at all dangerous : they are by no
means so confiding as the European Siskin of which I have kept
many examples, some of which would come on to my hand to eat
maw-seed even as early as three days after they came into my
possession. The song is pretty but not to he compared for a moment
with that of Yarrell’s Siskin of which I once purchased a pair from
Mr. Abrahams ; unhappily, however, they died almost immediately.
A Black-headed Siskin which I imported in 1893 also lived a very
short time, being in poor condition when it arrived.
I have had a good many European Bullfinches, but I did not
find them long-lived in captivity, indeed I have seldom succeeded in
keeping them alive for more than eighteen months ; they are essen¬
tially wild birds and seem to resent any curtailment of their liberty.
If hand-reared, they may live in confinement to a good age; but
caught birds, even though they may pair and go to nest, seem dis¬
contented, and, in my experience, soon die; on which account I
eventually gave up all attempts to keep them.
I have only had hens of the Lesser Bock-Sparrow and its
race the White-throated Sparrow ; I did not trust them with other
birds, as Mr. Abrahams told me they were of a very murderous
disposition. I purchased a male of the Grey-headed Sparrow in
1895 which lived a silent uneventful life in one of my aviaries until
1900. Of the Tree-Sparrow I had a pair given to me by Mr. Silver,
the hen of which is still alive : I cannot recommend it as an aviary
bird, as it never becomes tame and I have never heard it sing; this
is my experience, as also that of Stevenson in his Birds of Norfolk.
On the other hand, the late Lord Lilford says that the species

Dr. A. G. Butler,
becomes very tame in confinement, and the late Rev. H. A.
Macpherson informed me that it had “ a very sweet song.” I can
hardly imagine any Sparrow having a sweet song, but perhaps his
bird had acquired the song of some other Finch by imitation: young
Sparrows are rather clever in this respect.
Of the common Saffron-finch I have had and bred many
examples, but of Pelzelu’s Saffron-finch I only had a pair, which I
imported in 1893 ; the male soon died, but the female lived for some
years. Of Yellowish finches I have had several differing not a little
in size and colouring, so that I am rather sceptical respecting the
value of two or three of the forms kept separate by Museum
ornithologists. The song of all the species of Sycalis is very poor,
and many of the notes would no doubt be excruciating to any person
likely to have his teeth set on edge; I never suffered from that
nervous affection myself.
Of Serins (or Canaries) I have kept the Cape Canary, the
Sulphur Seed-eater, the St. Helena Seed-eater, the Green Singing-
finch, a hen White-throated Seed-eater, the Grey Singing-finch, and
the Alario-finch. Some of these birds quarrel fiercely with other
male Serins, the little Grey Singing-finch apparently fighting more
for fun than in earnest; it is a beautiful and indefatigable songster,
and a great favourite of mine. Oddly enough I found the more
powerful species with the heavier beaks the least inclined to bo
aggressive.
Of Rose-finches I have kept the Scarlet Rose-finch and the
Purple Rose-finch, quiet pleasing birds, without much constitutional
vigour apparently, for they both died early. Of Pine Grosbeaks I
received half-a-dozen in 1896, delightfully tame birds, but before the
end of the year they all died. A pair of Crossbills which I had, used
to undo the fastening of their cage and work havoc in my green¬
house ; I did not regret their loss. Like our Linnets, all these birds
are rather unsatisfactory from the fact that the beautiful rose¬
colouring of the males disappears at the first moult in captivity and
is replaced by yellow or orange. Of course I have had numerous
Lesser Redpolls, Twites and Linnets ; they are rather selfish and
quarrelsome in an aviary, and Redpolls are a nuisance from their

propensity to interfere with the nests of other species, which they
pick to pieces for sheer mischief.
Of Buntings of the genus Emberiza only British species have
come into my hands. I have had several Yellow-Buntings, a Cirl-
Bunting or two, three Ortolan-Buntings, and a fair number of Reed-
Buntings. I found the Ortolans aggressive towards smaller and
weaker birds, but the other species were quite inoffensive. Reed-
Buntings are rather inclined to skulk, so that if there are bushes in
the aviary in which they can hide, one may not see them for days.
An example of the Grey-headed Song-Sparrow was given to me in
1897 upon condition that, when it died, the body should be presented
to the Natural History Museum : as it died the same night I did not
see much of that species ; but of the allied Chingolo Song-Sparrow I
have had several pairs, the last being a pair bred by Mr. Teschemaker
which he kindly gave to me. Oddly enough these birds were
hatched from eggs with a white or creamy ground-colour, yet the
hen (before she was killed) laid eggs with a pale greenish ground-
tint (see my plate, fig. 2). Hudson speaks of the Chingolos as
quarrelsome birds, but I have not found them so ; perhaps they
only quarrel with other members of their own species.
The Nonpareil Bunting, of which I have had a fair number
of examples, but only two hens, is quite amiable excepting towards
species of its own genus : it is a pity that this lovely bird loses much
of its beauty after the first moult, and that with each successive
moult (unless kept in an open-air sunny aviary and supplied with
plenty of insect-food) its brilliant scarlet under-surface becomes
more and more yellow. I found the Indigo-Bunting v (absurd name
for a brilliant blue bird!) far more interesting, and I rarely missed
an opportunity of purchasing specimens when offered to me; the
gradual assumption of the summer plumage interested me, since it
was quite evident that the feathers slowly changed from brown or
whitish to blue without a moult. Both the Nonpareil and the
Indigo Buntings are confiding species which soon learn to take meal¬
worms from one’s fingers, and both have pretty little songs.
Of Pileated-finches (Goryphos%&gt;inqus) I have had several pairs,
the first two hens I received from Mr. Abrahams in exchange for a

male of the much rarer Red-crested finch, of which I imported three
males. These birds are innocent, pretty, but not otherwise inter¬
esting ; they seem to have no song, only call-notes. Of Cardinal
Buntings I have had a pair of the Green Cardinal which reared one
young one (the latter, however, dying before its moult), five Yellow¬
billed, two pairs of Red-headed and a good many Red-crested Car¬
dinals ; though powerful, they are not aggressive birds ; but their
songs (in spite of Hudson’s praise of them) are nerve-wracking and
cause sensitive persons to clap their hands over their ears. I have
had three cocks, but no hens, of the Virginian Cardinal (or Cardinal
■Grosbeak) : it is a lovely bird with a powerful, though somewhat
monotonous, song ; it must be kept cool if it is to live any length of
time in captivity ; cold it does not object to in the least, but great
heat speedily kills it; I lost my last two males from heat-apoplexy :
I foolishly kept them in flight-cages on a sunny shelf. Unlike the
Bunting Cardinals, this species should not be trusted with small and
weak associates.
I have kept plenty of Greenfinches, caught in my garden ;
one of them was a superbly coloured bird and had a song equal to
that of a Norwich Canary, but of course with the hideous terminal
note of defiance. I fancy, from its tameness when first caged, that
this must have been an escaped cage-bird ; but I have not found
Greenfinches at any time very wild, and in an aviary they settle
down at once : this however may be due to the fact that they had
not previously been kept for days or weeks in small cages and foul
air ; for a pair of Goldfinches, turned out the day they were caught,
were equally tame. I bought a common Hawfinch from a bird-
catcher ; but, unlike the Greenfinch, it resented captivity greatly,
and did not live very long : I consider it the least attractive in every
respect of all the British finches.
A Tropical Seed-finch, given to me by Mr. Harper in 1907,
lived an uneventful life in a flight cage until early in 1912. Of the
species of Spermophila, or Sporophila, as Ridgway more correctly
calls it (the name Spermophilus having been previously used) I have
kept the White-throated, Lavender-backed, Fire-red, Reddish, Bluish,
Guttural, Black-headed Lined, and Lined Finches : they are delight¬
ful little birds, some of them with pretty songs and, with the ex-

ception of the White-throated finch, are perfectly amiable and
peaceable : this last is sometimes aggressive.
So much for the true finches which have at various times
occupied my cages and aviaries : I now proceed to the generally
more popular Weavers, of which, almost from the first, I have had
numerous specimens and not a few species. Unquestionably the
latter give more satisfactory results when kept during the summer
months in outdoor aviaries with plenty of cover, and undoubtedly
my failure to breed many of them is due to the fact that I have
never had more than two outdoor enclosures, and neither of these
.altogether suitable for the purpose.
(To be continued).
CORRESPONDENCE, NOTES, &amp;c.
NOTES.
My aviary is not a large one, but a few notes on my birds nesting may be
-of interest. I started my aviaries two-and-a-half years ago. This last season
one pair of Long-tailed Grass Pinches brought up four strong young ones.
&amp;apos;The first lot came out of the nest too soon and did not live. Masked
Grass Finches, first nest, young one died after two days. Second nest, one
young one fully reared but disappeared when grown up and I never could find it.
Parrot Finches, four fully reared. Diamond Doves, one pair, six young fully
reared. Cordon Bleu, one young fully reared. Zebra Finches, about 15 fully
reared, first nesting, three died. Black-faced Love Birds, one pair, three fully
reared. Lavender-headed Love Birds, two pairs, eight fully reared. The
Masked Grass Finches had three eggs each time, but they all disappeared but
one. Mice I suppose took the eggs as, though the wire is fine, they manage to
get in when small. I give my birds a great quantity of flowering grasses of all
kinds, which they seem to much enjoy. Orange-breasted Waxbills hatched out
three young ones, but they died in a few days. One pair Green Singing
Finches hatched out one young from two eggs, but it died in two days. This
is the first season I have had my birds in pairs so I think I have done well. I
have now some Blue-banded Grass Parrots (N. venusta) which I hope to induce
to nest this summer, and I hope this season will do better with all my other
birds. Eleanor Turner-Turner.

“ They are very skulking, always preferring the thickest bush to sit in,,
“ and though far and away the most brilliantly coloured bird in the aviary, the&amp;apos;
male usually escapes notice unless one knows exactly where to look for him.
“ Both birds are usually lethargic in the daytime, but become lively just
“before dusk.”

LAYING &amp;C. IN THE APRIL NUMBER OF THE MAGAZINE.
On the coloured plate and in my paper I used only the scientific names
for the species mentioned, as I wished to render them especially of use to
Museum workers in Ornithology, and I concluded that any aviculturist who
was not familiar with the scientific names could easily find out their English
equivalents by referring to my “ Foreign Birds for Cage and Aviary.” However,
as every member may not have the book, our Editor has asked me to send an
index of the English names for publication in the Magazine.

* I see that, by a slip, I have put the Linnean name dominicana on the
plate : it is doubtful whether Linneus intended this species ; if so of course his
name would take priority over larvata.

THE AMETHYST SUN-BIRD.
Cinnyris amethystinus.
By Hubert D. Astley.

<bodyText confidence="0.996517291666667" page_id="32669739"  page_num="231" year="" vol="">
The Amethyst Sun-bird is found in South Africa, ranging as
far as Angola on the Western Coast. It belongs to the “dark
brown ” group, named Chalcomitra by Beichenbach, and to that
section in which the front of the chest is not scarlet.
It is distinguished by its velvet-like deep colour. It is
common in many parts of South Africa, but appears not to occur
from that portion of the South-West coast lying between the Orange
Biver and the Cape of Good Hope. It is abundant in the Eastern
provinces. It has been procured in the neighbourhood of Swellendam
in the mimosa trees which line the banks of the rivers. Also in the
Transvaal and Natal it is common, as well as Swaziland. In Natal
this handsome Sun-bird is said to remain in the bushy country
about Pinetown throughout the year. Mr. Atmore found a nest at

apple tree, very rough outside, composed of short bits of stick, grass,
and spider’s web—arched, as are the nests of all the tribe. The
number of eggs appear to be two ; before they were blown they were
of a soft creamy-yellow colour.”
Other observers say the eggs are a beautiful creamy-grey,
with indistinct confused blotches, spots and streaks, chiefly at the
obtuse end. The male has a short period when the plumage is&amp;apos;
duller, and when assuming the breeding colours the metallic lilac
feathers on the throat grow first, after which the bird becomes
generally mottled with black feathers, while the metallic green crown

I consider this beautiful bird, though of sombre colours, one
of the handsomest of the African Sunbirds. In perfect plumage
the cock bird is a beautiful velvet black with metallic purple on
shoulders, tail coverts and throat. The crown a bright metallic
emerald green. They do not go into eclipse plumage, but when
moulting the bird loses its velvet black, becoming a dull black, but
in a few weeks is in full plumage again.* In good light it is a
marvellously rich colour, and to do the bird full justice it has to be
seen at close quarters. The hen has olive wings with a dark brown
tail of which the outer feathers are tipped with white. Eyebrows
and breast buff, the latter mottled by dark feathers. Throat a dusky
black. A young cock in immature plumage is similar to an adult
hen but with the throat jet black. I have had a couple of these
exquisite birds for eighteen months and they have done splendidly
never causing me the slightest anxiety. They are undoubtedly quite
hardy and very easy to keep. Both the sexes have a broken loud
song which is not at all unpleasant. Of all my Sunbirds these are
the only two that eat only the syrup and grapes, thriving on it, and
refusing spiders and green flies which all the others devour with
relish. They always look in perfect trim and are most peaceful in
my Sunbird aviary, in which I have about twenty Sunbirds of eight
different species.
A couple of days ago I found one of my tiny Indian Amethyst-
rumped Sunbirds sitting on the back of the Amethystinus on the
floor of the aviary, fighting him and pulling out several of his
tail feathers, and the larger bird allowed it without making the
slightest attempt to protect himself or to get away. The culprit
was caught at once and caged separately and I hope this punish¬
ment will cure him of his bad temper. Strange to say the Indian
Amethyst-rumped Sunbird seems to be the most pugnacious and
* Shelley writes of this bird as assuming its full breeding plumage. This
sounds as if there is something corresponding to an eclipse plumage.—ED.

always makes trouble in the aviary. The Amethystinus is most keen
on his bath, and in the mornings when the plants in the aviary
are being sprayed he will always come right up to me and open out
his wings and ask to be sprayed. One of my birds is so tame that
he will let me stroke him and nothing frightens him.
The two cocks I possess seem to moult at different times and
never together, so I am lucky enough to have one at least in perfect
plumage always. They generally roost in amongst the leaves of the
bay trees I have in my aviary, and it is very difficult to find them,
they hide so carefully. It is a pleasure to see them enjoy life and
fly in and out of the branches at a great pace. Needless to say they
are most charming pets and a source of great pleasure to me. Of
the two cocks I possess, one began moulting in February and was in
perfect plumage by the middle of March, the second one started
moulting the end of April and is very nearly in full plumage now.
My Sunbirds are kept in an aviary in a bird-room, where I
always have plenty of light and sunshine. The aviary is a very
light structure made entirely of iron and linked wire netting,
measuring 9 ft. long by 6 ft. and 7 ft. high, a few growing bay trees
and some dead branches serve for perches. I also put in some
sweet-smelling flowers in vases, and the birds will fly at once when
these are put in fresh, to suck the nectar.
No coloured-plate can possibly do such a lovely bird justice,
partly owing to the metallic colouring of the throat and crown,
which is not fixed, but flashes out more brilliantly according to the
light upon them, when at other moments they are much less
observable.

By Maurice Portal.
In 1912 mention was made in the Avicultural Magazine of
the nesting of the Sudan Crown Crane ( Balearica pavonina ) at
Logan, in Wigtonshire. Mr. K. McDouall kindly furnished me with
some further details, and allowed me to go and see the birds at
Logan. Originally six Sudan Crown Cranes were sent home in 1906

Mr. Maurice Portal
but two died of malarial fever a few months later ; three still sur¬
vive, and two of them are full-winged and are to he seen flying about
the estate, often four miles away from the house, but always return¬
ing at night to sleep, which they do, either roosting on the house
top or up in a tree. The birds at Logan do not appear to feel the
cold or suffer from frost and snow, though of course the climate there
is no doubt milder than in most parts, and the sea on&amp;apos; both sides of
the point tends to prevent long frosts or the snow from lying for
any length of time.
The Crowned Cranes, like most of their allies, suffer from
frost bites on their toes as a rule, and Mr. St. Quintin told me he
had known a Crane lose its toe from this. Probably the fact that
the Logan birds have full use of their wings assists to keep them
free, combined with the milder climate.
The Cranes chiefly feed themselves in summer on insects and
various grubs and seeds, but they are fed on dari and maize if they
come up for it to the house. In the Kordofan it has been noted
that the birds feed in the open early on in the day, and then fly to
the river banks and water and spend the rest of the day there, flying
off at dusk to roost in the tops of trees. In 1912—or six years after
they came — a pair made a nest near the water’s edge at the loch,
and laid three eggs of a greenish hue, devoid of any markings. The
nest was a round one, raised on rushes and reeds and not particularly
finished off; both birds helped in the incubation which lasted 30
days. One young bird hatched and was carefully guarded and fed
on insects by the old birds, but when six weeks old a weasel un¬
fortunately killed it.
When first hatched it much resembled a long-legged Pheasant
chick, but the tuft on the head was visible from the early days, the
upper parts of body brown with reddish brown markings; and under
parts light yellowish down, white patch on cheek, and legs of an
olive brown hue. In 1913 the same pair nested again, but in July,
and laid three eggs, hatching all of them, and all went well until the
end of September, when the birds died off, one after another—pro¬
bably from lack of insect life, which was very scarce last year.
Altogether very unfortunate, but one hopes Mr. McDouall will have
better luck in 1914.

Von Heuglin was told that the Crowned Crane nested in the
trees in Kordofan, but it would seem unlikely.
Though these Cranes have laid occasionally at various places
in England and Europe, the only place where they have reared their
young appears to be in Holland. At the Giza Zoological Gardens in
Egypt a pair laid in 1910 and in 1913, but with no result. The
length of the egg varies from 73mm. to 75mm., and the breadth
from 53mm. to 55mm. B. pavonina is not a migratory species,
and extends roughly across Africa north of the Equator.
The other variety of Crowned Crane ( Balearica regulorum)
is no less beautiful and attractive, and is rather the tamer of the
two as a rule. It extends all over South Africa, though probably in
less numbers than formerly. In 1892—95 I saw considerable
numbers in Bechuanaland and up to the borders of Matabeleland,
also in the Kalihari, and I once saw two young birds with the old
ones in the Potchefstroom district. The natives stated they nested
near a Vlei, and a Dutchman gave me two eggs of a bluish-white colour,
which he declared were Crowned Crane eggs, and said they only laid
two. I was never fortunate enough to see any large number of these
birds, and about 20 was the most on a sandbank on the Limpopo
river. They are easily distinguished from B. pavonina by the large
wattle under throat and the cheek being white with the exception of
a very small portion at top, which is, a reddish-pink.
Another nice Crane is the Stanley Crane (A. paradisea) , which
soon becomes tame in captivity, and does not interfere with others
of its species. It is a resident of South Africa, and is found up to
Mashonaland and across to Demararaland and in the district of
Gordonia, where I once saw a few between Taungs and Upington in
the winter months. At the time I was astonished at the distance
they were from water, but it is possible that they w r ere follow¬
ing up belated Locusts. They were reputed to breed down there,
but I personally never obtained any proof of it. The general
appearance is pearl-grey colour, lighter on head, and the tail feathers
dark, and in an old bird touching the ground, legs black. It is
partially migratory only from all accounts.
The Stanley Crane stands our climate, and has nested and
reared a young one at Woburn and at another place. The nest is

merely a scrape in the ground like a Demoiselle Crane’s, and no
attempt made to build a nest like the Crowned Crane’s do with
reeds, etc. A Dutchman told me that these birds often spent the
day with the herds of game out in the open, and were very wary.
The eggs, he said, were brown coloured with spots of a darker brown
at the big end. The bird tames easily, and once at home does not
appear to have any desire to leave, even in its native country, as a
storekeeper had one which the natives brought in, and it used to
spend its day walking about and picking up stray Mealie or Millet
seeds. When I first saw it the bird was moulting and unable to
as it had cast its flight feathers in both wings.

By G. A. Heumann.
For years it had been my wish to see some of our Scrub-birds
in my aviaries, such as Regent, Rifle, Cat, Satin and other Bower-
birds, Mountain-thrushes, Pittas (Dragoons), and many other
feathered inhabitants of the Australian bush, but for years it
remained but a wish. There was no chance of “picking” these
birds up in any of the bird shops either here or in Melbourne, and
how they had found their way, as I knew they had, into the aviaries
of English fanciers I never learned. Talking the matter over with a
friend, also an enthusiastic bird-lover, we decided that the only way
to get these birds would be to go and catch them ourselves.
Spending the winter generally in a more congenial situation than
Sydney, we put in, for several years running, the coldest months in
various parts of the northern rivers of New South Wales. On the
Tweed river we were fortunate in possessing the friendship of the
oldest resident there, a retired Police Magistrate, who came to those
parts at a time when the Nulla-Nulla and the Boomerang still
played a conspicuous part in the tribal warfares of the natives.
Then the thick scrub still abounded with all kinds of native birds
and animals. Alas and alack! the sight of a native now is as

much a curiosity as even the once plentiful native bear. With the
Scrublands they too have gone, for little of the original virgin
forest is left standing, and up to the present day acre after acre is
ruthlessly and needlessly cut down, and valuable timber burned up
even to mountain heights which no cow will climb to look for food.
These sun-baked and barren ridges are now forming a melancholy
back-ground for the more fertile fields at their foot. I mention this
to show that it will not be long before the Australian Scrublands are
a thing of the past, and with them will go the many birds which
once enlivened those dense forests. Going—as the black fellows
and the native bears have gone. Every lover of nature must there¬
fore be grateful to the old gentleman mentioned for setting aside a
small tract of maiden scrub where no shooting is allowed, and where
the native birds of this locality find a refuge and an asylum. As
may be imagined, this sanctuary is thickly populated with Scrub-
birds. Situated on the banks of an arm of the Tweed river, it
commands an ideal position. Stepping out on the lawn from the
bungalow opposite early in the morning, the heart of the bird lover
is gladdened by the calls and songs of the hundred and one birds in
the opposite Scrub. The Coach-whips are heard on every side,
cracking, so that they almost make the air vibrate. The mournful
call of the Koel, the booming of the Wonga-Wonga Pigeon, the
croaking of the Eegent birds, the whistle of the Honey-eaters, and
the crying of the Gat birds mingle together in weird harmony.
From the plains floats across the call of the Swamp Pheasant and
the cry of the Orioles. Once in a way the peculiar whistle of the
Dragoon birds {Pitta) mixes with the rattle and milling noise of the
Satin Bower-birds, and so I might go on enumerating many more
calls and songs which greet the morning. But as the sun rises
behind the forest, and the huge trees, overgrown with creepers of all
shapes and sizes, throw their shadows in the tranquil waters of the
river, little by little the many voices cease, and soon only a solitary
crack of the Whip-birds or the croaking of the Bower-birds floats
from the thicket across the river to break the peaceful tranquility of
the winter’s hot forenoon.
It was here we decided to try our luck, and having received
kind permission from the owner as well as the authorities—for all

Mr. G. A. ETeumann,
Scrub-birds are protected—we commenced operations. We bad
brought with us loquats, apples and bananas, and displayed these
invitingly on the boughs of likely trees. By-and-bye we had the
satisfaction of seeing Cat birds, Regent and Satin bower birds, as
well as other fruit eaters, and Honey-suckers, enjoying the dinner
set before them, and later on a number of them had to leave their
happy homes to enjoy themselves or make the best of it in our
aviaries in Sydney. Of course it took weeks to accustom the birds
to overcome their shyness and eat the fruit set out for them, and the
catching was not as easy as falling from the proverbial log, but the
main point w T as that we got them. The Regent birds in their
gorgeous costume of satin black and orange are, next to the Rifle¬
men, the cream of the bush. They are easily kept on fruit, raw
beef, bread and milk and cake, and will soon learn to take a meal¬
worm from the fingers ; indeed, all my Scrub-birds do well on this
simple diet. The hen is brown, mottled white, with a black cap, as
also are the young males, and it is said that it takes three years for
a male to fully moult out. Personally I am inclined to think it
takes longer, by observations on my own birds. The hen and young
birds have dark brown eyes with black pupils and black beaks; the
young cock in an advanced stage has the eyes of the adult male, a
straw yellow, and the beak is also light horn colour, whilst over the
brown plumage is a hue or bloom of yellow which is missing in the
hen. I saw in an article in the Avicultural Magazine by a prominent
aviculturist that his Satin Bowser-birds (Ptilonorhynchus violaceus )
would not become tame, and were to him unattractive. This
gentleman must have got hold of a very old and recalcitrant pair.
Those in the aviaries of my friend and my own are not only tame,
but actually build bowers, and any bit of blue glass, blue ribbon or
blue marble is greatly appreciated by them. It seems a remarkable
thing this love of theirs for blue. I ventured the opinion once that
the reason of their love for blue is probably because the male sees
not only the blueish purple eyes of his own sex but also takes much
notice of the lighter shade, more of a dark heliotrope, in the eyes of
his lady-love. My theory has not met with general acceptance, but
unless someone gives a more plausible theory, I hold on to mine !
This reminds me of an incident worth recording. On the northern

side of the cottage was a patch of violets in bloom. At dawn the
Satin birds would come to get the fresh blooms and carry them to
their bower not 100 yards away from the house. Here they would
display, walking almost erect with drooping wings through their
bower, uttering deep guttural sounds. Perhaps, if the English
aviculturist who had some of these birds had given them a supply of
twigs and blue flowers, beads, etc., he might have had a different
account to record of these interesting birds. I often sit concealed in
the aviary to watch them and listen to their peculiar song, which
resembles a sawmill at work. Like all Scrub-birds they are easy
enough to breed. It is supposed to take seven years for the male to
assume full colour.
I would not recommend anyone to keep Cat-birds who is not
fond of babies, for they cry at four in the morning till late in the
afternoon, their voices resembling something between the cry of a
cat and that of a baby. They are the size of Satin Bower-birds,
their plumage being dark green, spotted with white across the
wings, breast and abdomen ; a delightful bird in a large aviary.
An English mulberry tree laden with ripe fruit proved a great
attraction to many Fruit-eaters and Honeysuckers, and especially
so to the Australian Oriole (Mimetes sagittata). The cock
bird is very striking in his dark sea-green coat and whitish
streaked breast and abdomen. Around the eye and extend¬
ing behind the ear is an oval-shaped bare patch of dark scarlet
—very brilliant in a wild state, but the moment the bird is in
captivity the red disappears and becomes a very pale sickly pink.
Probably the fright causes this change, for after long periods of
captivity. I have not been able to bring back that flush to their
cheeks which gives them in nature such an aristocratic appearance.&amp;quot;
One of the most beautiful of Cuckoos is the fruit-eating&amp;apos; Koel, a
handsome bird of the same steel-blue coat as the Satin Bower-bird,
but the eyes are a carmine red, the bill hooked and the tail long and
fan-shaped. To catch a rare bird like that is an exciting event, and
the only pity is that to get the bird is one thing, but to get it to eat
and so to live is quite another. With this species they will live as
*Red is a colour which fades in many birds, e.g. the Sepoy Finch, the Red
Sun birds, etc. It generally becomes orange or yellow. But this change does
not take place until the moult.—ED.

Mr. G. A. Heumann,
long as they are being stuffed, which only means to delay a little
the inevitable end. I have met with very many refractory birds like
this, and my experience has taught me that it is far better to give
them their freedom. The Rifle-birds are undoubtedly the cream of
the Australian bush, though the species here is not quite so gorgeous
as the one from New Guinea which has been imported into England.
They are shy birds, and I have not been so fortunate yet as to catch
one. When insects are scarce in the bush they will feed on fruit,
and during one of their raids on a loquat tree one fine cock got on a
lime stick set for Regents, which my friend was watching at the
time. However, before he was able to take the bird it had dropped
off the stick by its own weight. This trick, when finding that the
legs stick, of falling backwards and gradually dropping off without
moving a feather, shows certainly a great deal of intelligence, for
should one feather adhere to the lime there would be no escape. I
found a number of birds do this, such as Silver Eyes, Red Heads and
others. I regret even now that, in mistake for a Honey-sucker
which I did not know, I once shot what proved to be afterwards a
young male Rifle-bird. I have not given up hopes yet of seeing this
bird in my aviaries. A fine bird is the Pitta, commonly called
“ Dragoon,” on account of its proud and upright walk or run. A
gorgeous bird, not unlike the Kingfisher. In the early morning or
towai’ds evening their mournful call may be heard sounding like I
lost my wife,” twice repeated. They are curious birds, and can
easily be whistled up. A trap set with a dead bird in it will never
fail to catch them, even whilst one looks on. Feeding principally on
snails in the bush, these birds have the remarkable habit of carrying
them to a certain stone in the bush which serves all the Pittas in
the neighbourhood ; here the snails are cracked and eaten. It is, of
course, only by chance that one finds the spot, which is apparent
by the quantities of broken shells lying about, but, when found, to
catch Pittas is like shelling the proverbial peas. In the aviary they
live on raw beef, and if a smaller bird comes within their reach they
go for its brains ; yet, with all their faults, they are most desirable
birds. Another lovely bird we caught was the Mountain Thrush
(Turdus lunulatci). These resemble the European Thrush, but are
larger and more stately. They live on the ground in the dense

scrub. Unlike their relatives, the Grey melodious Thrushes, they
are much easier to keep alive, living principally on bread and milk.
Of all the Scrub-birds, if not in plumage yet in interest, I like the
Coachwhip best (Psophodes crepitans). The shape is that of the
cardinal, principally dark green, a trifle mottled on the breast and
abdomen, the large white cheek and black crest set the bird off well.
It is the tail, however, which gives it its stateliness, long, edged with
black and white, they have a knack of spreading and closing it as a fan ;
in fact, they use their tail in the same coquettish way as a lady her
fan at a ball. They are remarkably quick birds afoot, and it requires a
fast trap to catch this bird. When the male bird cracks, no sooner
is the last note emitted than the hen will answer with two weaker
cracks, the pair always keeping close together. It is wonderful what
a volume of sound a Coachman can emit; to see him perched above
the call-bird letting out an especially strong and angry crack is a
sight worth seeing, a sound worth hearing. His crest stands then
very straight, the wings drooped, and the tail spread out to its full
capacity ; with head proudly thrown back he whips out his defiance
and challenge. Often have I seen the bird overbalance himself
through the recoil of the volume of his own sound. In captivity
they do well, soon repaying the care bestowed on them, and sound¬
ing their whips ; yet it is not advisable to keep them with smaller
birds on account of their fondness for brains. Pigeons, such as the
Wonga and Bronzewing&amp;apos;s, are still plentiful in the scrubs, and
though I have tried hard, whilst the Bronzewing&amp;apos;s breed easily, the
Wonga I never succeeded with. Then there are the King Parrots, Lyre
Birds and Brush Turkeys. The latter come down from the ridges
early in the morning to scratch for food along the creeks and narrow
flats where the undergrowth is not so dense. They are stupid birds,
and I never relished the “ sport ” of shooting them. If hunted with
a dog the bird will, when flushed, fly to the nearest tree and sit
there gazing down at the dog&amp;apos; not fifteen feet below it ; in that
position a noose may be thrown over its head without fear of hunt¬
ing it away ; how different from the chase of his brothers in the
plains ! The only way to get at them is by riding or driving straight
at them, and only then a quick eye and a good gun will land the
bird. I suppose I ought not to mention hunting in this paper, but

the difference between hunting in these rugged parts and at home is
worth comparing. The country is very rough and rugged ; one gets
across the creeks best as one can, and some are fairly deep. The
trees are very tall, covered with Elk and Staghorns, their crowns
meeting and shutting out all sunlight. Below twilight reigns always,
whilst the atmosphere is damp, heavy and mildewy. The under¬
growth is so thick that it is often impossible to get through even
with a brush-hook. Creepers and climbing plants are interlaced
between and from tree to tree, often making beautiful caves and
bowers. The greatest curse of all vines are the so-called lawyer and
barrister vines, a species of trailing palm with hook-like thorns. It
is little use trying to tear away from their embrace ; they hold tight,
and only patience will get one out of their grasp by undoing hook
after hook separately. The reason they are called lawyer and
barrister vines is, I am told, that the former will only retain the
cloth, the latter will take your flesh as well ! On the Brunswick
river, where I was shooting once, these vines are called “ Wait-a-bit,”
and most appropriately. Of course, in those virgin forests, fallen
and decayed trees are everywhere hindering progress, and as one
makes an effort to climb them hundreds of leeches stretch out their
slender bodies like small browm flames, feeling upwards for a support.
One invariably carries a few away, and it is not until there is a
squelching sound in one’s boots that one realizes that some of these
brutes have got home ! It is not so much the bite or loss of blood
which makes these leeches so loathesome, but the frightful itching
the bite causes later on, lasting often for days. Then there is the
stinging tree ; the sting of its leaves is about the limit of stings !
Adding to these troubles the scourge of mosquitoes, one begins to
wonder whether the sport of hunting Pigeons, Parrots, Turkeys and
the like is worth such unpleasant experiences,—yet one goes again.
The wild fig trees come in specially for visits of nearly all the
fruit-eating birds in the Scrub, but a strong glass is required to
discern the various species, in fact to see them at all in the dense
foliage.
In my next article I will write about the smaller soft bills of
New South Wales, some of which I hope to bring with me to
England during my forthcoming trip in June.

By Dr. L. Lovell-Keays.
Lest our members should think I have lost my reason over
sexing birds, I have taken refuge under the above heading to give
my experience with certain of the Grass finches. To my mind
the Grass finches (Muniince) are among the most captivating and
interesting of all the hard-bills. Their love-dances and their extra¬
ordinary affection for their mates, or, if a bird of the opposite sex is
not available, for one of the same sex is simply wonderful to behold.
My first Grass finches were a pair of Diamond Sparrows, or better
called the Spotted-sided finch (Steganopleura guttata). They were
simply perfect, and I was assured that they were a true pair. They
had been sexed by several leading “fanciers” (Ugh! the hateful
term). One at least had been discarded by a well-known aviculturist
as a cock; in fact both were dubbed cocks, and as such by half-a-
dozen well-known and experienced aviculturists. I am beginning to
lose faith in my fellow aviculturists, and if you will bear with me to
the end you will see why. The first surprise came when cock No. 1
laid an egg and was in no wise ashamed of the fact, but after being
lectured on the unseemliness of a cock laying eggs proceeded to lay
another. However, the second bird did not so far forget himself as
to lay eggs, but displayed his crimson, beak to all and sundry. In
this guise they came into my possession last May. They built and
laid and sat in a way that would shame any advanced woman.
But all to no purpose. I got Butler’s “ How to Sex Cage Birds,”
and further advice was sought and taken. Great pity was expressed
for my lack of experience and sanguine hopes of a brood of young
from every pair of birds. Like Ag&amp;apos;rippa, I was almost, but not quite,
persuaded. The affection of my birds was manifest and unquestion¬
able. At last, November’s dreary night-like days appeared, and one
of my Diamond finches got very humpy, and evinced that degree of
uncanny tameness that speaks of a happy hunting ground where
there are no bars, no cats, and no Owls at night, and where every
mother bird can hear the music of hungry nestlings calling for their
ministrations. I easily caught her up and put her in my warm
bird-room, where she became my closest friend, but death, the evil

and thirsty one, gathered her one night, and Charon took her on
that journey whence the wayfarers never return. But I am
digressing. I examined the eggs, they were all clear, and once again
I was rash enough to think for myself, pink base or no pink base.
I saw a cock advertised in Edinburgh ; I sent for him and he made
the journey down south during that very cold weather of this winter.
But he never turned a hair until I put him in the flight, and that
only after 36 hours resting up on the warm pipes. When he, for it
was a “ he,” saw the other supposed “ he,” the real and new “ he ”
nearly had a traumatic dislocation of the cervical vertebras, and as
to the other and original “ he,” she simply proved a little minx.
Subsequently I obtained another cock from the Rev. John Paterson,
who, I regret to say is leaving us again for Cashmir. But by that
time my other little friend was feeling too ill to take any stock of
the male article, and his gavotting&amp;apos;s and neck twistings were simply
lost on the desert air. But he was, and still is, a cock, and the first
introduced cock doesn’t forget to let him know it either, even if I
did. Curiously enough Mr. Sich (our fellow member) had two cocks
all last season and I had two hens. We both suspected it and yet
both forbore to suggest an exchange. His, too, were sold as a true
pair. I have thus been brought in contact with eight birds for Mr.
Sich, subsequently obtained a hen bird from Mr. Frost. This last
lias, alas, also gone to the happy hunting ground. The result of my
observations is this. The beak of all the four hens that I have seen
has been a bright coral red with a slight pinkish stripe at and around
the base of the upper mandible. All four cocks that I have seen and
handled have had a dark, almost magenta, red beak with a lighter band
at the base. But the mandible is so much darker than the hen that I
can tell mine apart instantly even with only one in view. Is this a
coincidence or a constant ? I am utterly unable to detect any other
difference, except as regards behaviour. In that respect the difference
is so marked that the veriest tyro could sex the birds. The hen, of
course, never displays or bobs up and down, like a lady at the end
of a bathing machine rope, with a piece of grass in her mouth.
With the cock, however, these antics seem to be his chief amuse¬
ment. The notes are of course entirely distinct, but as musical
expressions generally fail to convey any impression to average

readers I will forbear, — besides which I don’t know anything about
music. I have already dilated all too much on our Diamond finches,
so with the Muses we will join and sing, “ Sic transit gloria guttatae,”
and pass on to the next.
If there is one more charming bird than all the rest it is the
super-elegant, vivacious, charming Long-tailed Grass finch ( Poephila
acuticauda). During the last year or two aviculturists have dis¬
criminated between what used to be the better known Yellow-billed
variety and the more often introduced (recently, at any rate) Red-
hilled variety and called it Hecki. Speaking personally, I much
prefer the latter, and I can detect, or fancy I can, a very distinct
difference in colour as regards the body tint, especially in the chest
and abdomen. In Hecki it is quite a shade darker with a dash of
reddish tinge in it. That and the Red-hill does away with the anasmic
and rather aesthetic appearance of the Yellow-billed variety. To sex
these birds is indeed a puzzle. With all due respect to one or two
dealers who have enlightened me, I don’t believe the size of the
gorget is any criterion at all, and I have, alas, had a good few
through my hands which (whisper it not) have gone to swell
the majority. One hen had a very tragic end. She had three
times been egg-hound, and each time the dry heat treatment had
cured her. But the last was the last, for on letting her out of the
small cage she flew out with a joyous twitter to join her grief-
stricken husband, for he had been inconsolable in her absence, when
she dropped dead, as though shot, with a little thud to the ground.
She never even breathed again. I am no pathologist. I am a
sceptic instead, hut I think we may venture ruptured blood-vessel as
the cause of death. I thought the cock bird would die of grief, but
by a great stroke of fortune I obtained a Yellow-billed hen for him,
and he sits and curry-combs her toupee and kisses her neck all the
livelong day. He is as happy as a king. Long may it last! In
my humble opinion there is only one way of sexing these birds, and
that is by the bill and by the behaviour of the birds towards each
other. True the hen appears a little slimmer as regards head and
neck, and less inclined to “boss” it over the other inmates of the
aviary. But the differences, if any, are extremely minute. It is
hardly necessary to specify the differences in the bill. Suffice it to

Dr. A. G. Butler,
say that in the hen bird the bill is less massive than in the cock and
narrower at the base. It is only fair to add that my wife, who is
almost as keenly interested in my birds as I am, believes the gorget
is larger and broader in the cock than in the hen. In some cocks I
am sure it is, and when very broad it is almost indicative, but I am
positive that it is not a constant distinction, and that some cocks
have as small a gorget as many hens.
I must not write more or our Editor will be sharpening his
blue pencil.* As it is I must apologise for using up so much valuable
space, and crave indulgence once again.

(Continued from page 229.)
The Waxbills (Estrildince) are fascinating little finches, but
unfortunately some of the most attractive of them are extremely
delicate, especially when first imported; according to my experience,
four to five years in captivity usually sees the end of the majority of
them, even of the more hardy species. I have had examples of the
following :—Common Lavender finch, an active but decidedly delicate
bird when first imported ; I have had many examples, a few of which
lived for more than a month, and none for more than four years :
its delicate beauty tempts one to purchase it in spite of its fragility.
Common African Eire finch, a very attractive midget of which I have
at various times bought many examples, none of which survived for
much over a week ; that vigorous examples do sometimes come to
hand, however, is evident from the fact that it has not infrequently
been exhibited, and that Mr. Farrar even succeeded in breeding it.
Of the common Amaduvade, one of the hardiest of the group,
I have had dozens, in fact it was the first Waxbill and one of the
three first foreign birds I ever possessed, and I paid a preposterous
price for my first pair, having no idea of its actual value. I found
this Waxbill quite indifferent to cold: it is an interesting birl from
its frequent changes of plumage, the males at one time of the year
closely resembling the females, thus invalidating the sole character

upon which Shelley founded the Sub-family: fortunately, if we
restrict the group to the Waxbills alone, other features exist. The
Gold-breasted Waxbill, of which I have also had many examples, is
almost equally hardy, although my earliest specimens gave me the
impression that it was delicate ; it is one of the smallest and prettiest
of the Sub-family.
The Orange-checked Waxbill, another hardy favourite, has
often inhabited my aviaries ; as pointed out by Russ, it is an
extremely nervous bird, scared by the least sound or any sudden
movement, thus sometimes creating a causeless panic amongst its
tiny associates. Ridgway describes the females of specimens intro¬
duced into Porto Rico as having “ no orange on side of head ” (Birds
of North and Middle America, vol. iv., p. 288), a curious change to
have been effected by transference from the Old to the New World !
The Green Amaduvade I found the hardiest and longest-lived of all the
Waxbills ; it is beautiful in colouring : I have had nine examples in
all. It has a mischievous habit of attacking and partly denuding of
feathers fresh examples of its own species introduced into its aviary.
I believe it to be the easiest to breed of all the Waxbills ; indeed I
almost succeeded in breeding it myself in indoor aviaries.
Contrary to Dr. Russ’ experience, I found the Australian
Red-browed Waxbill very hardy, and I have had a fair number of
specimens : as usual, in indoor aviaries the hens were liable to die
from egg-binding, but most of the small Ploceid finches suffer in this
way if they attempt to go to nest indoors ; at any rate that is what
happened to my birds. The St. Helena Waxbill, which many bird-
lovers consider tolerably hardy, I found distinctly delicate; about
eighteen months being the limit of its life with me, and I have tried
to keep it many times. Though even more delicate w T hen first
imported, I found the Grey Waxbill, when acclimatized, tolerably
long-lived and easy to keep.
I have had four Crimson-winged Waxbills, three males and a
female, the latter only lived with me for four months and the male
of my first pair died after ten months, the second male lived a
little over a year ; the fourth bird (apparently of the Northern type)
was sent to me anonymously early in 1906, and it died after two
years and seven months in my aviaries. This and the other species

Dr. A. G. Butler,
of Pytelia always struck me as rather apathetic and sluggish birds :
my Crimson-wings delighted to bask in the sun, but on dull days
they used frequently to hide in a bush ; excepting&amp;apos; in disposition,
they seemed to me to show relationship to the Lavender finch ; but
perhaps they may come nearer to Sundevall’s Waxbill.
My first pair of Cordon-bleus w 7 as given to me by Mr.
Johnston, brother of Sir Harry Johnston of Uganda fame ; he used
to exhibit at the Crystal Palace in those days. That was in the
early days of my bird-keeping, and I remember that I thought that
pair the most lovely example of delicate colouring that I had seen in
any birds, and was much surprised to hear that they were quite
cheap. After that, in spite of the delicacy of Cordon-bleus, I was
never without them for many years. At one time I thought I had
secured examples of the Blue-breasted Waxbill (I had not then had
an opportunity of comparing living specimens of the two species, or
I should not have been deceived) : of course at the next moult the
males acquired the crimson ear-patch. The colouring of the soft
parts, apart from the extent of blue on the body, distinguishes the
two species at a glance. I never had the Blue-breasted bird.
My experience of the Violet-eared Waxbill was most dis¬
appointing : Miss Gladstone sent me a perfect pair, which I turned
into one of my two outdoor aviaries: but the hen died suddenly
while flying, falling to the ground as if it had been shot, and the
cock evidently got into trouble through fighting and only lived a little
over a week. Like the Cordon-bleu it is a delicate bird when first
imported, and is so expensive that only a rich man could afford to
replace it continually until vigorous examples were secured : I never
heard my cock bird sing, which was a further grief to me. So much
for the twelve species of Waxbills which I have had, not one of
which I succeeded in breeding owing to the unsuitability of my out-
poor aviaries and to the fact that my indoor aviaries w T ere, perhaps,
too overcrowded.
With Grass finches and Mannikins I w T as rather more suc¬
cessful, though one of them—the Pintailed Nonpareil — owing to its
delicate constitution was always more or less a source of trouble :
its melamistic variations are interesting and &amp;quot;worthy of a coloured
illustration because of their extraordinary divergence from the normal

type : altogether I have had ten examples of the species and the
longest-lived only survived for two and a quarter years. With
Gouldian finches, of which, at different times, I have possessed about
fifteen pairs, I was at first almost equally unfortunate; but later,
owing&amp;apos; perhaps to the greater number imported and the care taken of
them during the journey over, I found these birds far less delicate,
and, when kept out of doors, quite hardy and ready to breed ; but
undoubtedly the strongest birds are those bred here, since a cock
which I bred in 1905 is still in vigorous health as I write.
Of the&amp;apos; Masked Grass finch I have only had a pair ; they used
to pretend to build and sit about in nest-boxes, but they never
definitely settled down : I found them rather uninteresting birds. Of
Long-tailed Grass finches I have had two pairs, of which an example
purchased in 1906 is still alive as I write, I have also had one female
of the form with red beak ; but the most pleasing of the group is the
common Parson finch, an impudent little bird which always reminded
me of our Blue-tit in its actions : of this species I have had about a
dozen pairs. At times this little finch is apt to be aggressive and
even spiteful towards other small associates, but one cannot help
liking it; as previously mentioned, I only once succeeded in breeding
it, but in an indoor aviary-
At fairly long intervals I have had three pairs of the beautiful
Diamond finch : I did not find them very long-lived birds, my last
male however far excelled the other five in longevity. Of the
Rufous-tailed or Star finch I have had seven examples, and the first
pair, for which I paid £2, died within six months; of those purchased
at a much lower price about ten years later, the hens far outlived the
cocks ; they are pretty little things hut not especially interesting. I
must, since the commencement of my avicultural studies, have had
at least a hundred of the common Zebra finch. Not only were these
birds very cheap, but with me they bred freely either as single pairs
in small flight cages or in indoor aviaries, accepting almost any
kind of nesting&amp;apos; receptacle. I turned twenty pairs into the central
division of an ornamental wire-aviary in my conservatory, and even
there several of them went to nest and reared one or two youngsters
upon seed alone.
I have had six of the lovely little Bicheno’s finch and one

Dr. A. G. Butler
pair of the Ringed finch ; most of them did not survive for many
months, but one Bicheno’s finch lived for three or four years, and
one Ringed finch for over a year. I believe these little birds require
plenty of small living insects to keep them in vigorous health. Of
Cherry finches I have had three pairs, two of which attempted to
breed, both building and laying, but in each case the birds were
interfered with ; as they are quite hardy, I was a good deal dis¬
appointed when these birds died without leaving progeny to fill up
the vacant place. Mr. Abrahams gave me a pair of the Indian
Silver-bill, but they proved to be extremely delicate and did not live
for many months : the African Silver-bill, of which I have kept many
specimens, is far more hardy, but I never succeeded in breeding it.
I have had many Ribbon finches; they are not altogether
trustworthy with weaker birds : my first attempt at breeding the
species was the only successful one owing to the susceptibility of the
hens both of this species and the Red-headed finch to egg-binding&amp;apos;;
of the latter finch I have had four cocks and one hen : males of both
species are fairly long-lived as a rule. The genus Amadina is a
group which might be placed either among the Grass finches or
Mannikins, between which it is a connecting link. As a matter of fact
the two divisions of the Muniince are purely arbitrary and merely a
convenience for breaking up a long series of species ; in like manner
the Quail finch might be placed in either division.
Of both Sharp-tailed and Striated finches I have kept many
examples ; as also, of course, of the three varieties of the Bengalee.
The Common Spice-bird was one of the first foreign birds which I
purchased (at an absurdly high price) ; subsequently I had many
examples, among which there were doubtless individuals of the true
Bar-breasted finch (M. subundulata). Mr. Abrahams gave me a
pair of Tugela finches in 1894. Of Pectoral finches I have had
seven examples, two pairs which I bought and three specimens sent
to me anonymously; they are handsome birds, but rather inclined
to interfere with the nesting-operations of other species and not
especially interesting themselves; they seemed fairly hardy, but
several of them appear to have escaped from my aviaries through
surprisingly small knot-holes in the wood ; unless, perchance, they

were devoured by mice, which seems unlikely since much smaller
and weaker birds were untouched.
The typical Mannikins of the genus Munia I consider
the most stupid and least interesting of all finches, so far as
their habits are concerned : some of them are ready at any
time to build and lay, but are too nervous to sit steadily;
others make no attempt at breeding unless placed in a suit¬
able outdoor aviary such as I never possessed ; the songs of
most of them are contemptible, and the efforts which they make
when singing ludicrous. I have had nine Chestnut-breasted
finches and found them hardy and long-lived ; of the allied Yellow-
rumped finch I have had ten, of which one still survives as I write :
both of these birds have audible songs. Of White-headed Mannikins
I have only had two pairs ; of Black-headed, several dozens : this
was one of the three first foreign birds I ever possessed, for each
pair of which I ignorantly paid sixteen shillings and eight pence.&amp;quot;
Since that time I have at different times purchased examples at five
and six shillings the dozen- I have had two or three pairs of the
Three-coloured Mannikins which I consider one of the prettiest of
the group.
In the present day, when there is a tendency to split up both
species and genera, it puzzles me greatly to comprehend why the
Java Sparrow and its allies have not been kept separate from the
other forms of Munia : to the eye they stand out at once as a very
distinct group; and, as a generic name ( Paclcla ) already exists, I see
no reason for ignoring it. I have had a considerable number of the
common Java Sparrow, and at one time used to breed it in its grey,
pied and white varieties in considerable numbers every year, but
now I have only a solitary specimen still living.
Of Mannikins of the genus Spermestes I have had one pair of
Magpie Mannikins, and they lived, one for four the other for six
years, a most uneventful life ; but this I found to be characteristic
of the genus. The two-coloured Mannikin was caught outside the
Natural History Museum and was brought to me by a policeman ;
whether the fact of its being taken up as a vagrant was too great a

three pairs of common birds, I got the cage (a metal one) which contained them.

degradation and broke its heart I should not like to say, but it died
that night, so that I had no chance to study this most beautiful of
its genus: of the allied Bronze Mannikin I have had a fair number,
but the hens always died egg-bound. I purchased two or three of
the tiny Bib finch in poor condition, but did not succeed in keeping
them long; they were probably on their last legs when they came
into my possession. The Mannikins (as a sub-group) are, generally
speaking, hardy and long-lived.

It never rains but it pours ! I wonder whether other people
find that if there is one loss or tragedy amongst their birds, it is
sure to be followed by one or two more.
A few weeks ago my splendid Red male Flamingo, which
arrived from Mexico last autumn, and which I had carefully tended
through the winter, was found dead.
The crop was full of wheat, he was fat and well liking, and
only the day before I had been congratulating myself on his improved
appearance, his energy in sparring with his European cousins, his
colour becoming more vivid, and on his whole demeanour being that
of a bird gaining in health and strength. “ Well,” I said, “ if that’s
the only loss I must feel fortunate,” and tried to buoy up my fallen
spirits with that poor comfort ; but I had my doubts.
I was like a housemaid at a house I was staying in, who,
having had a sharp misunderstanding with the cook, on its being put
before her that the ruler of the kitchen really was not a bad sort and
meant well, replied, “ Well! I ’op&gt;es Fanny will go to ’eaven.” Her
doubts have yet to be verified; mine have not.
I was about to take up my pen to write glowing accounts of
my Cranes, how handsome they all look in one large paddock
together, etc.: when it seemed to me by the calling and trumpeting
that something was wrong, for some of the cries had a sound of
distress. Looking out of the window, the first thing I realized was

that three of the Cranes, a Manchurian and a pair of Australian, had
managed to flap over the six-foot wire fencing, and that some great
commotion was taking place. Then to my horror I could see the
pair of Indian Sams dancing a war dance over a fallen Crane, every
now and again digging at it viciously with dagger-like bills. Out I
rushed like a whirlwind, over the stone bridge and paved terrace,
across the lawn, vaulted the railings, and away over the meadow.
By the time I reached the Crane’s paddock I made certain the poor
Australian was done for; she lay all of a heap, perfectly still, head
and neck doubled under her body, and one big wing sticking up
moved only by the April wind. My language was so strong that I
looked round and felt relieved that no one was near.
Much to my astonishment, on lifting up the fallen bird I
found it was still alive, but grievously wounded about the head, one
eye being apparently destroyed. When I had carried it to a small
stream close by to lave its poor head, and then made to put it gently
on the grass, it rose up with a hoarse cry of terror, stumbled
forwards a few feet, and then collapsed in a heap with its neck and
head underneath its body, just as I had first found it.
I looked back at the pair of Sarus, stalking about in triumph,
and shook my fist. Were I to record what I said to them, all the
respectable members of the Avicultural Society would at once resign,
and it goes without saying that that-would embrace the whole
Society!
After having taken the wounded Crane to the house, and
summoned to my aid my Bird-keeper, I went out to look for the
Manchurian—the pair of Australians which had got out were
walking about the meadow fairly quietly—but the Manchurian was
scared, especially as he was separated from his mate, and had
already reached the far end of a very long meadow, apparently with
some idea of walking to Hereford, 6i miles distant. We headed
him, as luckily there was a high hedge to limit his peregrinations in
that direction, walked him back towards the Cranes’ paddock, and
just as we thought we had him in, away he went with large flappings,
dived through a gap in a hedge of overgrown hawdhorns, and up a
field of plough sloping towards a wooded hill. I ran, and he ran,
and we all three ran. The great Manchurian first, I second, and the

Mr. Hubert D. Astley,
Bird-keeper a bad third ! The bird made for a shut gate, jammed
his head through the bars, and struggled to get through. When
within five yards of him, he started off up the slope and gained the
wood. Now I shall get him, I thought, he’ll have to come to a stop :
for the wood was thick in undergrowth. Not a bit of it, I might
have been chasing a deer, so quickly did that bird scamper through,
dodging underneath nut trees and saplings of all sorts. Darkness
coming on, and I, like “Charley’s Aunt,” still running ; but the despair¬
ing part of it was, that whereas I was blown, the Crane was not. It
was all I could do to keep him in sight, and that wood going up and up
to hill-tops, and on and on for at least a mile, made my heart sink.
Then at last I did lose him, and all I could do, and I only just did
it, was to run up the hill beyond where I had seen him disappear,
and come down again on him whilst he was still on the home side.
Just as I was giving up the search in despair, I caught sight of his
big white body among the trees below me. He saw that I saw !
set up a great “ kraur-r,” and was off again, plunging down the hill
amongst the thickets : but towards home. When I reached the
outskirts of the wood, having nearly spiked an eye with a bough in
my wild downward rush, there he was in a large field, going like
the-, well 1 the wind ! Stumbling and panting over the heavy,
rich, red-brown Herefordshire plough, I turned him, so that he
scrambled over a hedge into the adjoining field, and if he didn’t
make up hill again towards the wood ! I verily believe that the
winner of a mile race at the ’Varsity Sports w r ould have sunk down
long before; true I felt ready to drop, but head that bird off from
the wmod I must, and I did. Flapping madly towards his own
moat, entangled for half a minute in the hedge he had to surmount,
when for half a second I thought “Now I shall get him,” he gained
the island which the Crane’s moat encircles, and I confessed myself
partly beaten, and went indoors, or rather dragged myself there.
To my relief he was still on the island next morning, separated from
his mate only by the wire-mesh fence.
Such are some of the amenities and vicissitudes of
aviculture!
Just on the other side of the moat, the water of which flows
round the house, live in an apple orchard four Crowned Cranes, two

of which are a nuisance. A stranger on walking by them would
think for the first minute or two, “ What charmingly tame birds ! ”
for these two would walk forward, marching sedately by that
stranger’s side for some few paces. Naturally the stranger stops to
speak to them. The two Cranes put their heads together (literally),
hold converse of low guttural sounds, and are apparently saying
Not quite the society we are accustomed to my dear,” and then
without another word of warning they are at one, tooth and nail,
and I prefer the former to the latter, for their claws are uncommonly
sharp and have a slight hook to them, and they do really claw, and
must I think be incarcerated. More unprovoked and vicious attacks
than they make I never witnessed.
The first time it happened was when I stooped down with a
bowl of melox to lay at their feet, whereupon I felt a sharp blow on
my hatless head, the male Crowned Crane having jumped on it. I
had a sore arm for several days where one of his talons had caught
me.
“ What horrible birds you do keep,” a guest said, and really
not without reason in that instance! The cry of these Crowned
Cranes is not musical, it is monotonous and tuneless ; when all four
join in the chorus it sounds like two or three motor cars, or
“ Har- hux, Har-hux, Har -hux ” ; none of that wild-sounding
“ kr-r-ar ” of European, Manchurian and other Cranes. No doubt
at a little distance, which does often lend enchantment, the cries of
a large company of Crowned Cranes on the shores of some African
lake, sound better.
And these Cranes, though they can be gentle, have an ex¬
pression of exceeding fierceness in their eyes of pale straw colour
with the hard-looking and small dark centres.

GARDEN FRIENDS.
By Miss Ethel Chawner.
Birds have been cherished in this garden for the last twenty
years, and it may interest some of our members to hear about them,
though there is nothing at all remarkable to record.
Our chief friendships are with Robins, Tits and Chaffinches,.

Miss Ethel Chawner,
Blackbirds and Thrushes — though familiar enough to make their
wants known when under stress of weather or when hungry families
have to be provided for—keep their distance and obviously look on us
as a kind of ‘ Whiteley’ or ‘ Harrod,’ to be patronised when occasion
arises. Robins are differently constituted. For the last ten years
at least we have never been without one or more finger-tame Robins,
who invade our rooms, observe our exits and our entrances, and
generally use us to suit their convenience. “ Bounce,” our reigning
Robin, does more than perch and away : he hovers in the air like a
Humming Bird while the mealworm tin is being opened, and then
sitting on a finger he picks out what he desires, perhaps stopping in
the middle to sing a few notes or put a feather to rights. A short time
ago he introduced his wife 11 Bet,” who at once showed herself as
fearless as he, and comes just as readily to hand. “ Bounce” will
he four years old next June: he is the child of “Jane,” who
was utterly fearless and who largely reared him on mealworms.
“•Jane ” came to an untimely end, but fortunately we had already
gained the confidence of her speckled nestlings, and “ Bounce ” we
hope is good for several seasons yet. When callers come he is
always to the fore, ready to show off&amp;apos; and be fed ; he appears in the
kitchen, in the drawing room or in my bedroom with equal confi¬
dence, and I have more than once been awakened by his trill shouted
literally into my ear, and have found him on my pillow demanding
immediate attention. Or he comes in dripping from the birds’ bath
on the lawn to dry himself on my towels. When mealworms are
not forthcoming he will condescend to “ pine nuts.” These nuts,
really the kernels of the stone pine, are most useful in winning the
confidence of birds, who all take to them at sight. Tits and Finches
of all kinds delight in them ; Blackbirds and Thrushes bolt them
like pills as fast as they can swallow, and Warblers generally enjoy
them slightly crushed. They are clean to handle and carry about
in the pocket, and a pound, which costs about 1/2, lasts a long time.
Great Tits, Blue Tits and Cole Tits all visit my room regularly
for pine nuts. They come attended by their families in the summer,
and it is pretty to see a brood of young Great Tits sitting on the
dressing table while father and mother ply them with pieces of the
kernels. For some years I had a special friend, a kind of super-Tit,

who taught himself to fly down and dive into a bottle, which I held
up, for his nut. This trick was entirely his own invention and I
have never been able to persuade any other bird to attempt it. My
little friend (a Blue Tit) was most particular and would only
“ oblige ” if his own bottle was held up. During the summer he
always disappeared and I saw nothing of him until the first frost
brought him back spruce and confident as ever. This lasted three
winters and then, to my deep regret, I saw him no more.
Tits are proverbially mischievous and inquisitive, and my
familiars are no exception. When they have emptied their dish of
kernels they examine books—my Spanish Authology, unwarily left
on my bed table, has its wrapper torn and pierced in their search
after knowledge—the dressing table (a favourite joke is to tug the
pins out of the cushion, carry them to the edge of the table and
drop them into space) ; the walls of the room : picture frames can be
hammered and excavations made round nails and quite a respectable
amount of paper torn away or plaster destroyed. I have even found
the holes in my sponge neatly packed with pine kernels, a deed which
I put to the credit of the Cole Tits, who are very fond of making
stores and forgetting all about them. But in spite of these misdoings
they are such dainty rogues and have such amusing ways that I
have not the heart to banish them.
The Chaffinches do not as a rule come into the house, but lie
in wait when we go round the garden, calling loudly until their
demands are attended to. They also like to feed their young on
pine kernels as well as mealworms.
It is curious that neither Marsh Tits nor Nuthatches, both
common here and both domesticated in other gardens not far off,
have so far responded to my advances. Only once have I had
dealings with a Marsh Tit when, during a spell of severe frost about
six years ago, one of these birds entered a garden aviary and refused
to be turned out. He made himself quite at home, living on hemp
seed and mealworms and became very masterful towards the other
inhabitants, so that I was not very sorry when spring came and he
took his departure.
I fear that I cannot lay claim to any particular discoveries
from my observations of these species. Robins I find make “cast-

ings ” nearly as freely as do Owls and Hawks, but this fact is as
well known as the Cole Tits’ habit of “casting their bread upon
the waters” and forgetting all about it. I can only say that I derive
great pleasure from my garden friends and they are a never failing
delight to children of all classes. Errand boys, Sunday school classes
and workmen are always greatly impressed by the sight of uncaged
birds coming to hand, and in some cases have successfully tamed
birds for themselves.
Last year a Thrush nested in the enclosure where a boy keeps
his pigeons, finding her way in and out as they do, and she was
allowed to rear her young and depart in peace with them when they
were fledged. Another has a Robin which comes in at his window,
and not long ago a boy gleefully told me that a Tit is nesting in a
cocoa-nut which he had hung up. This, it seems to me, is a form
of nature study which should be encouraged by all aviculturists.

Ruddy Shellduck, Cinnamon Teal, Common Teal, Blue-winged Teal,
White-eyed Pochard, Red-crested Pochard, Common Pochard, Rosybill,
American Wigeon, Chilian Pintail, Common Pintail, Gadwall, Shoveler
Tufted Duck, Ruddy-headed Bernicle Geese. In addition to these I have

found four or five nests containing four to six eggs, which I shall not be
able to identify until I catch the owners on the eggs. It has been a very
early season here, Rosybills and Ruddy Shellduck (usually late layers) “went
down ” on full clutches a fortnight ago ! Chilian, Ringed Teal, and various,
other species appear on the point of laying. H. WORMALD.
Mr. A. Ezra has received from India, amongst other birds, some of the
handsome Red-headed Bullfinches (Pyrrhula erythrocephala). In style and size
resembling the European bird, the male has the head and breast a bright orange
red, with small black mask round the bill.

Through the kindness of Mr. David Ezra, Mr. Astley has lately received a
lot of Cotton Teal (Nettopus coromandelianns). For 30 years Mr. William
Jamrach tried without success to import these pretty little water fowl, so that it
became a fixed idea that they could not be kept in captivity. Mr. Astley has
one in perfect health that landed in England on the 25th of January, 1914.
Mr. A. Ezra has presented a pair, out of the consignment sent over by his.
brother, to the London Zoological Gardens.

THE YELLOW WAGTAIL.
By J. H. Symonds.
During my summer fishing excursions as a boy to a deep pool
in the river Ivel some eight or ten miles north-east of Bedford, I
well remember the Yellow Wagtail as my constant river companion.
Perhaps only a few yards away he was to be seen daintily pattering
about some floating patch of weed or on a mass of cut rushes that
had come down stream and found an anchorage against the wooden
piles that remained as evidence of a once existing boating stage.
Often his dainty walk would break into a jerky little run, followed by
some wonderful sudden turns in mid-air that almost defied the eye to
follow as he sought some luckless winged insect, and, judging by the
continous snapping of his beak, many met their death. Sooner or
later, however, a fresh cast of my line would send him looping&amp;apos; to
the next floating hunting ground. At the particular point mentioned
the river runs through two or three rough damp meadows, freely
sprinkled with tussocks of coarse grass, and thus admirably suitable
as a nesting haunt for these birds.
One afternoon in June I wandered across these same meadows
with my camera, keeping a sharp look-out for any movement on the
part of the birds that would give me a clue as to the whereabouts of
the nest. By freely using my field glasses I was not long in finding
a nest of young, but, unfortunately for my purpose, they were too
far advanced in life ; in fact, they were on the point of leaving the
nest. It now being late in the season, I abandoned all hope of
photographing&amp;apos; the Yellow Wagtail that year. However, I resolved
to remember my little yellow bird friends when they returned from

their North African winter quarters in the next spring. But as fate
would have it, I was obliged to see that spring and summer go by
without result, and during the dull days of winter I forgot them
altogether. With the welcome song of Willow Wren, White-throat
and Cuckoo in the following April the Yellow Wagtails came back
to memory, and towards the end of that month I set off to the
rough meadows by the stream to find them. I was soon greeted by
a slightly drawn-out high cry “ Wheet,” and a Yellow Wagtail
alighted upon a fence near by with material for nesting purposes.
After watching both birds visit a particular spot a few times, I went
and found they were busy making their home cosy with a lining of
horsehair, both birds meanwhile hovering overhead uttering a
repeated anxious cry of “ Wheesit,” “ Wheesit.” Apparently the
nest would be ready for eggs in about two days’ time, and being
thus satisfied with my mission I returned home. My next visit was
early in May ; the nest then contained four eggs indistinctly spotted
over with ash-grey spots on a dirty white background, and five
ultimately made the full clutch. Some bitterly cold weather whilst
incubation was in progress reduced the number of fertile eggs to
three, which had hatched out three or four days previously to my
going over with a camera and “hiding” on the 19th of May. As
the weather conditions were favourable I commenced work at once.
The hiding ” was erected barely four feet in height about twelve
feet from the nest, and then from a distance, by the aid of my field
glasses, I watched the birds frequently go to the nest. Being thus
assured they were not alarmed at the strange object, I left the
immediate neighbourhood. Returning in a few hours I slipped into
the hiding and hitched it up by degrees from the inside during the
birds’ absence until I got it within workable distance. I found the
Wagtails uncommonly indifferent to any little sound proceeding from
the tent, and the parent birds sat alternately quite unconcernedly on
the nest whilst I arranged the camera, taking of course all care to
work as quietly as possible. The hen Yellow Wagtail often retired
to a favourite spot a yard or so from the nest for a moment’s pause
in the arduous task of foraging for the family, and here her actions
were interesting. Should a fly venture near she would crouch low
like a cat getting ready for a spring, then, at the opportune moment’

■dart forward in pursuit of the intruder. As is customary with other
birds, both the cock and hen took part in the feeding of the young,
the hen being, however, decidedly the most assiduous. Caterpillars
and winged insects chiefly formed the diet of the young birds. Con¬
sistent with the traditions of small bird-life, the Yellow Wagtails
were scrupulously attentive to the comfort of their charges; even the
bed came in for an occasional shake-up. A good deal of energy was
expended on this little duty while it lasted. It was undertaken by
both birds; standing over the young&amp;apos;, they pulled vigorously at the
interior of the nest until arranged to their satisfaction. The
characteristic inquisitiveness of a herd of Welsh cattle caused me
some annoyance. They would, at frequent intervals, come and
investigate my hiding, and it was disturbing to me as well as to the
Yellow Wagtails that I should be constantly getting out to drive the
cattle away. Some days afterwards I was again in the vicinity, and
went to see if the little family had been duly reared. I saw a pair
of old Yellow Wagtails feeding some fully-fledged youngsters a short
distance away, so I concluded all had gone well.

beautiful little bird in its native home, as extracted from Bulletin

are written by Mr. Wells W. Cooke, Assistant to the Biological
Survey. I consider Mr. Cooke knows more about N. American
waterfowl than almost any other American Naturalist, and his notes

The breeding range of the Cinnamon Teal differs essentially
from that of almost every other duck in the Western Hemisphere.
It consists of a large area north of the Equator and a similar district
south of the Equator, and these two homes are separated by a strip
about 2,000 miles wide, in which the species is practically unknown.
In North America the breeding range extends north to Southern

British Columbia (Lac la Hache) and South-Western Alberta ; east

(Fort Wallace, Meade County) ; south to Northern Lower California

Northern Mexico (Chihuahua City), Southern New Mexico (Carls¬

bad), and South-Western Texas (Marathon, Rock Spring).
The Cinnamon Teal occurs sparingly on migration as far east
as Houston, Tex., and Omaha, Nebr. It has been noted as accidental
at Oak Lake, Manitoba ; Big Stone Lake, Minnesota ; Lake Koshko-
nong&amp;apos;, Wisconsin ; Licking County Reservoir, Ohio ; Seneca River
and Seneca Lake, New York ; Lake Pontchartrain, Lake Catta-
watchie, St. Malo, and Opelousas, Louisiana ; Mount Pleasant, S. C.;
Lake Iamonia and Key West, Florida.

Throughout this breeding area the eggs are deposited during
May and June. About six months later the South American Colony
breeds. The breeding range includes the pampas of Argentine as far
north as Buenos Ayres, while in the Andes it extends north to
Central Peru (Santa Luzia). Southward the species breeds as far
as the Falkland Islands and Straits of Magellan. South American
breeders of course are not the same birds which nest in North
America, for it is true, without exception, that no bird which breeds
north of the Equator breeds also in the southern hemisphere.
Winter Range .—The Cinnamon Teal of North America
retires in winter but little south of its breeding range in Mexico as
far as Mazatlan, Guanajuato, and the Laguna de Chapulco, Puebla.
It is found at this season as far north as Brownsville, Tex., Central
New Mexico, Southern Arizona, and Tulare Lake, California. South

of Mexico the only record is on an accidental occurrence in Coast
Bica. There is no reliable record as yet for the West Indies.
During the winter season the Cinnamon Teal of the southern
hemisphere has been noted as far south as the mouth of the Senger
Biver, in Patagonia, latitude 44°S., and Chiloe Island, Chile, in
nearly the same latitude. The northern range in winter is not
determinable with exactness from present data. The species passes
north to Eio Grande do Sul, Brazil, and to Southern Paraguay. It
has been noted at Chorillos and Tungasuca, Peru; near Quito,
Ecuador, at Bogota and Santa Marta, Colombia. These Ecuador and
Colombia Teal may be accidental occurrences. It is significant, at
least, that all the specimens from Colombia were taken half a century
ago, and the species has not been noted there by recent collectors.
Spring Migration .—The northward movement of the Cinna¬
mon Teal in the United States begins about the 1st of March, and
arrivals have been noted at Ash Meadows, Nevada, March 18th,
1891 ; Grangeville, Idaho, April 11th, 1887; Chilliwack, British
Columbia, April 24th, 1888, and April 22nd, 1889; Beloit, Colo.,
March 23rd, 1892 ; Colorado Springs, April 9th, 1882 ; Loveland,
Colo., April 13th, 1890; Lay, Colo., April 20th, 1890; Omaha,
Nebr., April 10th, 1896, and April 12th, 1897; Lake Como,
Wyoming, about May 5th.
Fall Migration .—Southward &amp;apos;migration occurs chiefly in
September, and the northern portion of the breeding grounds from
British Columbia to Eastern Colorado is deserted about the middle
of October.
Migration in South America .—The Cinnamon Teal of South
America is migratory in at least part of its range, for in Central
Argentina it is abundant during the winter season, April to Septem¬
ber, and rare or lacking during the breeding period. The species is
migratory also in the southern portion of its range in Chile. In
Northern Chile and in Peru migration records are wanting. The
time and direction of the migration of this species in South America
correspond closely with those in the United States, but of course
the breeding and wintering seasons are reversed, since they are on
opposite sides of the Equator.
Thus the Cinnamon Teal is distributed in two distinct

colonies, part of the individuals breeding far north of the Equator,
and the rest about an equal distance to the south. The northern
breeders migrate south after nesting, and the southern breeders
migrate north. Whether or not the members of these two groups
now represent sub-species, they are so much alike as to indicate a
a common origin and a former continuous breeding range. Whether
isolation was gradual or was effected rapidly it is impossible to say,
nor do we know the cause.
Mr. Hugh Wormald writes me as follows :—“ This is one of
the most beautiful of the whole duck tribe, though it seems to me
that the name Teal is a misnomer. This duck is, in my opinion, a
Shoveler; the bird’s habits, shape and appearance are much more
like a Shoveler than a Teal, and the courtship is identical with that
of our Shoveler. These birds are now becoming fairly common in
collections of ornamental waterfowl, though a year or two ago they
were practically unknown ; they are certainly among the most useful
for ornamental purposes, being extremely beautiful, quite hardy, and,
in my limited experience of them, very free breeders. Two pairs on
my pond this spring produced four nests. One pair on each occasion
nested at quite a distance from the water, and the other pair at the
water’s edge. A fact I have noticed time after time with all ducks
is that when the first nest is taken or destroyed, and the birds nest
a second time, the second nest is always, or nearly always, within
about ten yards of the spot where the first nest was situated. The
colour of the eggs of my Cinnamon Teal varied considerably ; one
bird produced rich cream-coloured eggs and the other laid very nearly
white eggs. Cinnamon Teal are said to hybridise freely with Blue¬
winged Teal (Q. discors), though I have never seen a bird of this
cross, but I am told that there are some at Falloden. Young
Cinnamon Teal are easily reared, and are sturdy little ducklings, and
may be fed in the usual way, and provided that there are no heavy
rains while they are quite small there should be practically no deaths.
I have found the glass top of a garden frame fitted into wooden legs
most excellent protection from heavy rain. The front legs must be
shorter than the back in order to allow the water to run off easily,
and they must be made high enough to allow plenty of air to get in
between the wooden sides of the “ run ” in front of the coop and the

glass covering. Cinnamon Teal are much tamer in confinement
than most of the small ducks, which is greatly in their favour. The
importation of some wild caught drakes would be a great advantage,
as I fancy that the stock of Cinnamon Teal in this country is
becoming “ in-bred,” all the birds on the market being bred either
here or on the Continent, and I have seen no advertisement of wild
caught birds. Moreover I believe that all the birds in this country
are the descendants of a few birds bred on the Continent.
I regret that I have only a nodding acquaintance with the
Cinnamon Teal in its wild state. I saw it on several occasions on
the Pacific Coast in Southern California in company with Buffle-
heads, Shoveler and Ruddy Ducks, and was able to note the great
speed it has on the wing. I was unable to see it during the nesting
season as I was in California during the winter only. On various
lakes in public parks where no shooting was allowed and where
sanctuaries were carefully maintained, it was most interesting to see
the various birds that fed tamely close at hand. Hundreds and
hundreds of Shovelers, which are identical with the European bird,
and small parties of a dozen or so of Cinnamon Teal, which, as Mr.
Wormald says, closely resemble the Shoveler in habits, hundreds of
White-winged Scoter (Oi. deglanclii) came in to wash in fresh water
and flighted out to feed towards the evening; parties of Pintail,
Mallard, Green and Blue-winged Teal paddled about, while overhead
floated Western Gulls ( L. vegae) and the dark-plumaged Heerman’s
Gull ( L. heermani), and the reeds were filled with Brewer’s Black¬
birds and Red-winged Starlings,—the whole making a picture of
which one’s eyes never tired.

tivity. This photograph I took in my studio, and the bird is clinging
to a piece of wood placed up against the wall.
The first cage in which I put him he stayed in for just about
one hour; the cage had a wooden back, and he pecked his way out
of it almost immediately. I then got a cage made entirely of zinc
wire, about 2ift. by lift. Occasionally I let him fly about the room,
when he would always make straight for my skirt and climb up on
to my shoulder and ask for meal-worms. In one instance he settled
on the head of a friend who happened to come in, and commenced to
peck his head (probably thinking he had found a new piece of wood!)
Two of his great objections were hats and overcoats, and if anyone
went near him when in out-door clothes he invariably hid himself
behind his log of wood in the cage. Of strangers he was also very
shy, but directly he got used to any person he would sit as close as
he could get to them and utter his small, quiet “chipping” note,
which, being interpreted, meant “ Meal-worms ! ” I once gave him
a companion of his own kind, which he inhospitably killed at once
by pecking the new-comer’s head. He would never tolerate any other
bird or animal. I used to put his cage on a wide window-seat
in which my bull-dog&amp;apos; used to like to sit; this the Woodpecker
resented, and used to peck the dog’s back so viciously that he was
forced to get down. Another animal he disliked was a black Persian
cat, which usually sat on the cover on the top of his cage, and if by
any chance the cat put its paws beyond this cover the bird would
fly at it and peck its feet until it was compelled to beat a hasty
retreat. The Woodpecker, in displaying anger, would loosen all its
feathers, erect its crest, drop its wings, and literally shiver with rage,
keeping its beak open meanwhile.
He was so lazy in keeping himself clean at first that I used
to take him out of his cage, well lather him with a shaving brush
and soap, and thoroughly wash ; but after some time he would bath
frequently, often twice a day. A peculiarity which he had was that
of “ sounding ” any fresh piece of wood which had been put into his
cage, and on finding a hollow-sounding spot would commence to
peck a hole, in which he would place any extra large piece of biscuit
or bread so that he had more power over it in order to break it up.
On several occasions, when the wood had been too new, he broke

the tip off the upper mandible, which however grew again after a
week or so.
His food consisted of insectivorous food and meal-worms, but
nothing&amp;apos; came amiss to him, a special delicacy being a chop bone.
He rarely touched fruit of any kind. He used to “talk” to me
quite a lot in his way, and always at night he would respond to my
“Good-night, Pecker” with a little quiet “chipping” sound.
Another note was a prolonged scream, repeated several times as a
rule. He also had a special, agitated, loud and repeated “ Tchuck ”
which he used on hearing any unusual sound, a kind of alarm note
presumably to give warning of approaching danger.

“ Willst du in die Feme schweifen,
Wenn das Gute liegt so nah.”
These fine words might with good results be applied also to
bird-keeping. It is human nature, however, to just want what is
hardest’ to get, and so we commence to keep seed-eating&amp;apos; birds, which
before long are joined by the delicate and—if the purse can stand it
—the most expensive Soft-bills and Honeysuckers often before we
are able to or capable of keeping them alive. I was no exception to
this rule, and during many visits to the Continent I always brought
back of rarities whatever I could buy or exchange for such Australian
birds I had taken home with me. In this way I often managed to
get pairs of rare birds which I afterwards bred successfully out here,
such as Scaly-headed finches, Red-collared Whydahs, Tanagers, and
many more. However, I always had a warm corner in my heart
for the native birds of my adopted country, and little by little,
recognizing&amp;apos; the charm of these home treasures, they filled my
aviaries. Now, after 20 years of tending them, there are but few
species of N.S.W. birds suitable for aviaries which have not been
inmates in my flights and often bred there. Yet, I admit it to my
sorrow, that before I managed to attain success I had to look down

Mr. G. A. Heumann,
on many a dead little songster, many a beautifully-coloured corpse,
and I often felt as if I should like to give the hobby up and stop this
murdering by my incapability to keep them alive. The majority I
can now safely bring on to eat artificial food, set into my aviaries,
and they will live with me for years. Others, like the Fly-catchers,
are still a closed book to me, yet I believe even they may be kept in
confinement if taken young from the nest and reared up. To sum
up my experience of Australian birds and such from other countries,
be they seed-eaters or otherwise, I have come to the conclusion that,
as far as those are concerned which I have had the pleasure of
handling, the Australian birds are infinitely harder to keep and their
lives are shorter as well.
Judging by a number of letters I have at various times
received from English fanciers, I thought it might interest not a few
of the readers of the Avicultural Magazine if I tell them something
about N.S.W. birds I have kept which were nearly all caught
by myself, and I feel sure many of our beautiful Soft-bills could,
with proper care and attention, be landed safely in England.
There is a wave of fashion just now passing through the bird-
lovers of England. The magic word is “ Sun-bird,” so I will com¬
mence with the only Sun-bird we have just now in too sunny New
South Wales.
Myzomela sanguinolenta ,* commonly called “ Blood-bird,” and
it richly deserves this name. The head, back, neck, and half-way
down the breast is bright scarlet; abdomen mottled red, grey and
white ; wings and tail sooty black. The hen is all brown and the
young like the hen. The bill is long, very slender, and slightly
curved. These beautiful little birds come around Sydney early in
September when the first gum trees begin to bloom. Never in
quantities, they are still some years more plentiful than in others.
They live high up in the big gums, and early in the morning when
the sun rises their melodious call may be heard in every direction.
November is the month for breeding. The nest is 10 to 20 feet high
up in turpentine trees, wattles, or even fruit trees, but at any time
it is hard to find, as the male bird gives no clue as to its where-
*M. Sanguinolenta is not a “ Sun-bird ” proper, but allied to the “ Honey-
eaters.”—E d.

abouts. They are very jealous birds, and will not allow another
pair within their “sphere of influence,” which I noticed in all
Australian birds, and yet a dozen and more will select one water-hole
and meet there quite amiably at a certain time, generally between
4 and 4.30 p.m. These birds are hard to catch, as they will take no
notice of a decoy bird, and the only place to get them is the water-
hole—if you can find it. For years I spent with my children one
day a week in the bush, always with our eyes open for any bird we
might meet, yet so far we found only one nest of the Blood-bird
right out. It was built in a wattle tree and made of the dead blooms
of the wattle laced together, a flimsy structure, looking just like a
nest of a species of a hairy caterpillar often seen in the bush about
here. This nest contained three eggs, but returning a week later we
found it empty. No doubt a Butcher-bird was the culprit, the worst
enemy of our small birds. I have never tried to breed the Blood-
bird, but I should not think it more difficult than to breed any other
Honeysucker. Many of them have lived in my aviaries quite a long
time, doing&amp;apos; well on brown sugar and water, and as the flight is large
they catch of course a great number of minute insects as well. In
the open I have seen them on dull days come right down low, hunt¬
ing the turpentine and other shrubs for little spiders and insects.
They are not susceptible to cold, but a draught will surely kill them.
It is a pity that these vivacious and winsome little gems have not
yet been introduced into England.
Acanthorhynchus tenuirostris. This bird is much lovelier
than the beautiful name scientists have given it. We call them
“ Spine-bill ” Honeyeater, and were it smaller it would make a
beautiful Sun-bird. Not so gorgeously attired as the Blood-bird, this
little treasure is much more interesting. Always near the ground, it
will visit low shrubs, hovering over a flower here or clinging to the
stem of another, and dipping its long, slender, curved bill into the
flower. One meets this “flower kisser” always and anywhere in
the bush or garden, and it allows one to come quite close, showing
very little fear. Strange to say, they build very high; the nests
which came under my notice were placed on the outer branches
of high gum trees. We feed them as the Blood-bird ; in addition
they get sponge cake, bread and milk sweetened, soft-bill food and

fruit. They will last years in an aviary, and they become delight¬
fully tame, especially when reared up out of the nest. As soon as I
enter my aviary they will fly on my head and shoulders. Of all the
Honeysucker tribe this one I would always keep; they are charming
and affectionate pets.
Ptilotis leucotis : White-eared or White-whiskered Honey-
sucker. This is another of our favourites, though harder to keep
alive than the Spine-bill. They are essentially Bush-birds living on
the nectar and insects of the bush flowers. The bottle-brush tree they
are very fond of, and I noticed them also visiting the warratahs when
they are just about to open. They are very cunning birds and hard to
get on to the lime-stick, which is best set near their bathing place, for
they love the water and will bathe numbers of times a day. It is a
proud and handsome bird, the head and back greyish-black, throat
black, chest and abdomen black and white striped, the cheeks pure
white and fan-shaped. The wings are greyish-green at the base,
becoming yellow towards the end ; a really lovely bird. Once used
to the aviary they are quite at home, and live a long time.
Ptilotis chrysotis : Yellow-tufted Honey-eater. This is doubt¬
less a fine bird ; yellowish green with a yellow crown and yellow
tufts as whiskers. They are terrors on soft fruit. When the per¬
simmons are ripe in my garden the tree is often more laden with
Yellow Tufts than persimmons. They build in low bushes a nice
compact nest, often close to the main road, and generally so that
every boy can see it; yet they thrive and are always plentiful. In
the aviary they are spiteful to small birds, sometimes taking the
young&amp;apos; out of the nests or whizzing past a smaller bird and lashing it
with the wing. All the same, to an aviary with larger birds they
are an acquisition. I have mine with Parrots, and there they have
been for years now
Melithreptus atricavillus : Black-cap. General appearance
yellowish green with white band across the neck, head black,
abdomen white, bare rim round the eyes, metallic-brick-carmine-red,
it is an indefinable colour. This bird is more like a soft-bill than a
Honeysucker,—a small dainty creature without defined song&amp;apos;, but
always calling to each other. They readily descend to a decoy.
They make tiny nests in turpentine trees, but in my flight they built

in the bamboo. Like most of my birds they will take a mealworm
out of my hand. Other fine Honeyeaters in my aviaries are the
Spiney-checked and the Blue-faced ones. They are both rather
large birds, the size of a Mexican Blue-Jay, and similar to it in
shape. Unfortunately the blue in the latter birds fades pale after
the first moult in captivity. One of my greatest pets in Honey-
eaters is the little tawny-crowned one —Gliciphila melanops. These
are plain little birds of ashy-brown, with a tawny crown and whitish
abdomen. They built their nest—a loose hanging structure of un¬
twisted rope fibre—on a branch of the tree in my aviary. I asked
ladies at the time to come into the flight without their hats, when
these little birds alighted on their heads immediately and tried to pull
the hair out for their nest. This led to many an amusing scene.
I have a number of other Honeyeaters, such as the “ Chick-
up,” the “ Singing ” Honeyeater, and others of less interest than
those mentioned previously. Perhaps the Blue-eyed Honeyeater
should be excepted and deserves special mention. Similar to the
“ Black-cap” generally, it is a trifle larger, and the ring round the
eyes is bluish-green ; a bright and lively bird. Its life in the aviary
is, however, always short; the reason for it is not at all clear to me,
as they are fed as the other Honeysuckers, which do well. Towards
Christmas they come to feed on the late wattle blooms and
abutilons, calling like the Black-caps to one another as they fly.
They are very shy birds and hard to catch.
My experience with Honeysuckers has been undoubtedly
encouraging. In the early days, when I first begun keeping them
and knew little how to treat them, I had many losses. There was no
one then who could advise me, as no one kept them ; and even now
I know of no fancier here who would take the trouble to look after
them carefully. Feeding them on honey, or honey diluted with
water, would send them surely into fits sooner or later. Condensed
milk would not do, and many other experiments I tried failed. The
result was always fits and death.*
Examining the tongue under the microscope, I found it

covered with little bristles wherewith to scoop out of the flower not
only the nectar but also the milliards of microscopically small insects
which no doubt supply the main food. Taking my cue from this
observation, I tried to mix ants egg&amp;apos;s and dried lean meat powdered
up finely with the honey; result: they still went on dying. I now
changed the whole system by substituting unrefined (brown) sugar
and water with a sprinkle of the powdered meat and ants eggs,
sweetened bread and milk, fruit and sponge cake ; result: my Honey-
suckers live and are doing well- They are tight in feather and are
in a general good condition. I am of opinion that honey in any
form or quantity shortens their lives.

(Continued from page 252).
I have only had five species of Whydahs, but a fair number
of Viduine Weavers : thus of the Short-tailed Whydahs I have kept
many examples of both sexes of the Gombassou and the Ultramarine
Finch ; they are harmless, excitable little birds, quite ready to breed
when in colour, only my hens generally died from egg-binding;
otherwise I found them hardy and long-lived. Like the Mannikins
they will build in any of the usual nesting-receptacles, though my
birds always preferred a prepared Hartz-cage to any other ; like the
Mannikins also, and unlike the Long-tailed Whydahs, their eggs are
pure white and unmarked.
Many a time have I been tempted to purchase specimens of
the Pin-tailed Whydah ; but the two or three males which I have
owned were so mischievous in scaring other species in the same
aviary with them that I unwillingly refused them: they are most
graceful and pleasing in flight and their colouring is attractive : I
have had several females. As regards the reputed parasitic habits of
the species, Stark’s description of the nests which he himself saw
containing young birds, and the description of the spotted egg given
by Shelley, seem to me to be a sufficiently conclusive answer. I
have had a fair number of Paradise Whydahs, and found them as a

general rule peaceable and inoffensive, but I had one spiteful indi¬
vidual in 1897 which I was obliged to place with birds as strong as
itself. The Long-tailed or Giant Whydah, although a large and
powerful species, is amiable and long-suffering unless persistently
provoked by smaller birds : I have had only one male example
myself, but Mr. Housden, of Sydenham, had a fair number at one
time.
Of Viduine Weavers I have kept many examples of the
Napoleon Weaver and still have five or six as I write ; two males in
the same aviary are sure to fight in the breeding season, but several
hens can be kept safely with the same cock-bird : like most of the
Weavers they are hardy and long-lived. I have purchased two
Crimson-crowned Weavers from a mixed series in winter plumage,
but both proved to be hens ; I also secured a hen of the Black-
vented Weaver in the same manner. One male of the Grenadier
Weaver, still in excellent health as I write, was sent to me in 1906
by Major Horsbrugh : it is perhaps the most beautiful of the Fire-
Weavers, and my example is in full colour by April each year ; in
the breeding season it is master of the aviary in which it is confined ;
but should any bird pluck up courage and stand up to it, this
impudent Weaver retires at once, evidently considering discretion
the better part of valour. I have had many examples of the lovely
Orange Weaver, which greatly resembles the last-mentioned except¬
ing in its inferior size and orange throat: two males in the same
aviary are liable to dispute during the breeding season, so that it is
better to keep each cock in a separate enclosure with several hens.
Of Red-billed Weavers, the most long-lived of all and the most
indefatigable of nest-builders, I have had many : under different
conditions they vary greatly; one very abnormal male sent to me by
Major Horsbrugh at a later date moulted into quite normal plumage,
to my great disgust; but the albinistic form Russ’ Weaver never
reverts to the normal plumage after acquiring the buff cheeks of
that form.
We now come to the typical or Ploceine Weavers, some of
which are very interesting birds to keep on account of the compact
snail-shaped nests which they build. I obtained one male of the
Rufous-necked Weaver in 1893, and in 1896 and 1899 I purchased

examples of the Black-headed Weaver. In 1895 I purchased a male
of what I then supposed to be an ordinary Black-headed Weaver;
but, after its death on the 29th January, 1910, it was identified at
the Natural History Museum as H. capitalis, which Shelley calls
the Niger Black-headed Weaver ; it is conspicuously smaller than
the commoner species and differs in several other respects. I have
also had the Half-masked Weaver. I have had three male Baya
Weavers and two male Manyah Weavers : they built many nests,
but having no hens to help them, they never completed them by
forming the cup for the eggs or the entrance tube. I have kept two
males and one female of the brilliant Madagascar Weaver and one
male of the nearly-related Comoro Weaver; they are aggressive and
quarrelsome birds, the latter especially so.*
Next to be considered are the Starlings, which I have always
greatly delighted in on account of their intelligence and the readiness
with which many of them become tame and confiding: they include
some of the most brilliantly coloured of our feathered friends, and
are interesting as links between the Finch-like and Crow-like birds ;
their nests, both in form and location, vary as much as they do in
the whole of the two families of finches, while the cunning and
mischievous propensities of some of them are similar to those which
one finds amongst the Crows. Of the finch-like Marsh-birds I
received single examples of the Bobolink and the Bed-breasted
Marsh-bird from the Argentine Bepublic in 1893 : I had to keep
them in a smallish aviary as they were too wild and nervous for a
flight-cage; they did not appear to be spiteful birds. The Brown¬
headed Meadow-Starling, of which I have had two examples, were
certainly quite amiable towards their associates. The Yellow¬
shouldered and Flame-shouldered Marsh - Troupials, with more
slender bills, I only kept in flight-cages and therefore cannot say
how they might behave if associated with smaller birds ; I had two
males of the former and one of the latter species, and should judge,
from the age to which the last-mentioned attained, that if correctly
fed and treated, both would be examples of longevity. I found a
*On April 7th, 1914, Mr. Silver brought me a male out of colour of what
he understood to be a Comoro Weaver, but it has since proved to be a Madagascar

pair of the Silky Cowbird and a second male which I received later
long-lived, by no means aggressive, but extremely nervous and wild ;
yet this species is said sometimes to become tame and trustful in
captivity.
Of typical Troupials I have only had a pair of De Filippi’s
Military-Starling, rather wild birds, but attractive from their beauti¬
ful colouring; with me they only lived about two years. To my
mind the Hangnests are the most pleasing of the New-World
Starlings : they cannot be safely kept with other birds, even though
almost of their own size, indeed I am satisfied that in their wild
state they are more or less predacious in their habits ; but on the
other hand they are most companionable, delight in being noticed,
talked to, and made much of. They are very clever at opening the
doors of their cages, and should a plant stand anywhere within
reach of their long bills it is quickly disfigured, pieces of the leaves
being torn off and pulled to pieces: if turned loose in a room they
are said to make havoc of lace curtains. Their notes are clear, flute¬
like and resounding, and a military band will start them off singing
vigorously; they are hardy, and if obtained in good condition are
long-lived. I have only had two species, a pair of the Common and
one of the Brazilian Hangnest, the latter was in a bad way when I
purchased it and did not long survive, but the Common Hangnests
(of two types which I believe to be continental and insular) are still
in excellent health as I write.&amp;quot;
Of the Old-World Starlings I have had many examples of the
European bird, both hand-reared and caught in the garden. This
common species is a beautiful creature when seen close at hand ; it
keeps itself in splendid condition so that it looks almost as though cast
in metal, and it is naturally tame and easy to keep, being almost omni¬
vorous. On one occasion I trapped thirteen in quite a short space of
time with what is known to the catchers as a caravan-trap (at one
fall of the trap I caught three, for these birds are most reckless in
their greed for food) ; from these thirteen birds I selected one
perfectly-formed snaky-headed specimen with extra brilliant colour-

destruction on the floor of its cage early in April; they were coloured as in

ing and perfect markings, and sent it about a month later to a show ;
unfortunately the judge ignored its perfect form and preferred a
thick-set ordinary example which had been forced into its summer
plumage prematurely. I was naturally disgusted, and sold the bird
to a gentleman who appreciated its good points for the price which
its cage had cost me, and I am satisfied that I recognised it at
several subsequent bird-shows as the winner of first prizes, but it
had again changed hands before then.
Among the Starling-like Mynahs I have had a male of the
Malabar Mynah, a pleasingly-coloured bird, extremely active, but
less confiding than some of the Starlings, and unless one can get
both sexes not so interesting. I got tired of it after a time and
exchanged it for something which I considered more attractive. As
I kept it in a smallish aviary I cannot say whether it is aggressive
or not, but I hardly think it would be towards birds of about its own
size. I had a Common Mynah, either in 1893 or 1894, which
occupied the same aviary later in company with my pair of Blue-birds ;
it is not a very handsome bird. My example was a great devourer
of cockroaches of which one could not supply it with too many ; it
was quite indifferent to the presence of the Blue-birds, but that may
partly have been due to the fact that its health was failing when I
received it, for it did not live for many months and I never coveted
another.
In my experience the Crested Mynah is by far the most
pleasing of all the Old-World Starlings as a pet; from what I had
seen of it I longed for a specimen for some years before I succeeded
in obtaining one. It is a quaint-looking bird with its triple crest,
but it is always in perfect plumage, in abounding health and spirits,
eager for attention, absolutely trustful, and always ready for a fight
with its owner. When spoken to it keeps making jerky bows, utter¬
ing at the same time queer creaky sounds; it can be taught to talk,
but its utterances are gruff and low-pitched ; it whistles clearly and
makes trumpet-like noises. I fancy that my bird was too old when
I purchased it to be taught to talk, the only word it ever uttered was
“ Joey,” and I gave it that name. Although I do not doubt that
the Crested Mynah is by nature partly predacious, killing and
devouring small birds, mice, lizards, etc. (my bird was fond of

young mice), I do not think, from what I saw of a specimen in one
of Mr. Housden’s aviaries, that it would ever be spiteful towards
birds of its own size.
I have only had one of the Crow-like Grackles—the Greater
Hill-Mynah ; it is handsome but heavy in its movements. A mar¬
vellous mimic, this bird can be taught to talk; but its voice is very
gruff. My bird had never learnt any words, but any number of
queer sounds which it had evidently heard on board ship. In my
opinion this large Mynah, in spite of its somewhat Crow-like aspect,
is not predacious ; I believe I shortened the life of my bird by
giving it raw beef, and that it would have done far better if soft food,
fruit and living insects alone had been given to it. Even if it had a
craving for fresh meat, I doubt whether with its ponderous move¬
ments it would be quick enough to capture small vertebrate animals,
excepting perhaps newts, frogs or slow-worms.
Some years later, in the aviary previously occupied by my
Malabar and Common Mynahs, I kept two Satin Bower-birds :
charming creatures with the most beautiful eyes of any bird known
to me. I have already published so much respecting these two birds
that I will say no more about them here : they are essentially vege¬
tarians, but are fond of insects.
I have only had two species of the Crow-family : The English
Jay and the Blue-bearded Jay. They are most delightful birds to
keep, but of course they need a large flight-cage or a smallish aviary
to themselves. My English bird, one of the largest and most hand¬
some of its species, was one of four taken from the nest by a Mr.
Ginner and given to me while still a baby. I only succeeded in
teaching him to say “ Hullo Jimmy ! ” but he mimicked the cats
which passed the conservatory in which his flight was kept, copying
both their complaining mewing and their growls when fighting; he
always growled when he saw a cat, and often cursed it in true Jay
language. His imitation of a bird washing was wonderfully realistic ;
he was very jealous of attentions paid to other birds, and if I stood
near his flight and took no notice of him he picked up stones and
flung them at me. In the breeding season this bird used to show off
to me : flying to the floor of his cage he would lower his head, wings
and tail, erect his crest, curve up his back so that all the feathers

stood on end, and hop round and round in a circle of about eighteen
inches diameter, making&amp;apos; odd noises in his throat, and repeating all
his imitative sounds : he looked absolutely cracked, and when my
friend Mr. Frowhawk saw him I did not wonder at his remark “ I
say, what a fool! ” Poor old Jimmy ! he only lived thirteen years.
My Blue-bearded Jay was a great pet, but I have written fully
about him in this Magazine before (n.s. vol. 1, pp. 227-230, with
coloured plate). It was very fond of having its head scratched and
its chin tickled, and liked me to hold its bill between my thumb and
forefinger. I purchased it in 1895 and it died in 1909.

MY BIRDS AT BRINSOP COURT.
By Hubert D. Astley.
(Continued from page 255.)
Amongst my greatest treasures is a small flock of Cotton Teal
(Nettopus coromandelianus ), and I pride myself in being the first

person to succeed in keeping this pretty little waterfowl in captivity
out of India (its native country) with the exception of two which
lived in the London Zoological Gardens for nearly a year in 1897.
I have had one male since the 26th of January of this year (1914),
and Mr. David Ezra most kindly sent me several more in May from
Calcutta, a pair of which lot was presented by Mr. Alfred Ezra, his
brother, to the London Zoological Society.
The Cotton Teal is very small, a good size smaller than the
English Teal, and is said to be allied to the Geese. In certain
structural points this may be so, but in habits it is totally dissimilar.
The legs are very short, and the Cotton Teal is not a free mover on
land, although the idea that has hitherto been prevalent that it
cannot walk at all is quite a false one, which idea probably arose
from the fact that those previously imported were paralyzed. All
my Cotton Teal can walk about in their enclosure on the turf quite
easily, and, moreover, spend a great deal of their time out of the
water. They perch easily and naturally.
I had always supposed these birds to be divers, but I have

never seen any of mine attempt to do so ; when I let one out loose
on a large pond and had to catch him again owing to other ducks
and the Flamingoes starving him out, it was not until he was hard
pressed by being harried by the boat which followed him that he
finally dived, as any other surface duck would do under such
circumstances.
The male bird is very pretty ; the face and neck snow-white,
the crown of the head dark greenish brown with a darker ring
coming down from the back of the neck and extending round the
base in front; flanks whitish-grey, upper parts deep bottle-green.
The bill is goose-like, as in the Bernicle Geese. Cotton Teal have a
curious way of bobbing their heads up and down, and (on land)
wagging their tails.
They do well on smaller seeds, such as dari, hemp seed,
millet, etc., and are fond of water-weeds. Up till now the flock I
have and the pair at the London Zoological Gardens are, I believe,
the only ones in Europe, and it is only through Mr. David Ezra’s
undaunted perseverance and kindness that these have reached
England in good health, although I must not omit my thanks to the
Captain of one ship and the steward of another who took the
greatest pains to tend them on the voyage from Calcutta.
The next success to be obtained is to breed from them !
They are the smallest ducks that are known in the world. Real
pigmies.

In my Bird-room, which is fitted with every convenience, hot
and cold water, radiator, and electric light, the inmates vary to a
certain extent from time to time. Some of the birds are out in the
aviaries during the summer ; others, especial pets, are always there,
except when their cages are hanging in the courtyard or the loggia,
etc.
A beautiful Blue-headed Rock Thrush still keeps in excellent
condition, his portrait having figured in a coloured plate in the
Magazine. Mr. A. Ezra’s pair of Great Niltavas are also there,
having been sent to me for country air and for more exercise than
they could have in cages in London.

rich brown, with a small patch of bright blue on the sides of the
neck, and a wash of warm grey, over the brown, on the head. Both
birds are extremely tame, and are as a rule flying loose in the Bird-
room, so that when I approach the meal-worm box they instantly
fly down close to me, and will take the worms from my fingers.
The only pair in Europe.
A pair of Red-headed Bullfinches ( Pyrrhula erythrocephala )
are charming birds, quite tame, although only imported by Mr. A.
Ezra towards the end of May. They delight in a large bunch of
flowering grass, chickweed, groundsel, etc. Except for a small mask
of black round the bill, the male has the head and also the breast of
a rich orange colour, otherwise he much resembles our British Bull¬
finch ; the female has a wash of orange yellow on the back of the
head and a grey-brown breast. Their call-note is softer and more
tinkling than that of their British cousin, and the song is pretty, the
notes more rapid than the British Bullfinch’s, and more chattering
perhaps.
A pair of Yellow-backed Red Sun-birds ( CEthopygci seherice),
also sent by Mr. A. Ezra, are generally allowed to fly about the
Bird-room, and are remarkably fearless. The male, whose wondrous
cardinal-red alas fades when he moults to a dull orange, looks very
beautiful in his imported colours when perched on a large spray of
wild cherry, apple blossom or hawthorn, sucking, with his long
tongue, the nectar.
A fine Bullock’s Hang&amp;apos;nest ( Icterus hullocki) gives a vivid
splash of gorgeous orange in his cage; and he too, as do all the rest,
comes out in his turn for a flight and a bath. This is perhaps the
most beautiful of .all the Hangnests.
A Shamah and a Gray’s Thrush ( T. grayi) make the room
resound with their songs. A pair of Petz Conures, pretty little birds,
make it resound, but only at moments, with their shrieks! The
male is all green, with a frontal patch of orange above the bill, the
crown of the head being a bluish-grey ; the female the same, but
less bright, the orange patch above the bill being considerably
smaller. The large eyes add very much to their beauty.
The room is square and as large as a good-sized bedroom, and
has a wheat-coloured composition floor rounded off at the skirting,

which can be washed down, and keeps beautifully sweet and clean.
Roomy shelves go round two sides for cages, and strong hooks for
the same hang on the walls. Large cupboards for food, etc., are at
one end, and at the other a sink of white porcelain, with sloping
grooved shelves adjoining it, over which are shelves with perforated
zinc, on which sponges, empty baths, etc., are stored. The walls
are of enamel paint of duck-egg green, and everything is as sanitary
and clean as is possible.
I use sawdust for most of the cages, putting a little grit in a
glass feeder. The seed-eaters have large bunches of all kinds of
green food, which grows in abundance in the fertile red sandstone
soil of Herefordshire. When I received the pair of Red-headed
Bullfinches (they might have been called orange-headed!) their
delight was great when I almost filled their cage with a bunch of
flowering grasses, chickweed, wild cress, groundsel and Shepherd’s
purse; they dived in amongst it, nibbling with little piping notes of
pleasure.
One of the delights of receiving freshly-imported birds is to
feel what joy one gives them after their long voyage, and to see
them improving daily. One of the sorrows is when they arrive too
late, moving on to an unseen plane. I don’t mind birds coming
with shabby and immature plumage, so long as they will but move
for it is so interesting to watch them moult, emerging from dull
chrysalises, as it were, into fine butterflies. I think the water here
has iron in it, which no doubt is beneficial, for some waters must
be better for birds than others, and here it comes from beautiful
springs. (To be continued).

WHITE COMMON HOUSE-SPARROW.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997895275862069" page_id="32669823"  page_num="285" year="" vol="">
SIR,—I think the following facts will prove of interest to some of your
readers.
For several years past I had in my aviaries a White Common House-
Sparrow. It was a hen, a pure Albino with pink eyes. One day in February last
year an old cock Sparrow was foolish enough to walk inside the passage of one of
my aviaries. I chanced to be behind him and shut the door. I then opened the
door of the aviary in which the white lady was and drove him in. They had an
indoor aviary 14ft. by 6ft. I provided them with a nest box, a small quantity of
hay, and a few feathers. Their first nest of young consisted of two, and left the
nest on May 10th, 1913. Another lot of four left the nest on June 12th. A third
jot of four left the nest on July 15th, and a fourth lot left the nest on August 13th.
There were thus fourteen young reared, all being ordinary Sparrows without a
white feather. Six of these young ones became the meat of a tame stoat, and
the others I turned loose. I have a high wall all round my flower garden, and
one or two nest-boxes against the wall. One of these about a month ago was
occupied by a pair of ordinary Sparrows. On Sunday the young left the nest,—
three pure Albinos with pink eyes and two Common Sparrows. One of the
Albinos was too strong on the wing to be caught, but my man caught the other
two with a net, and they are now doing well. The old birds are nesting again in
the same spot, so I hope to get several more Albinos.
I think this is interesting as showing that in the first jflace the Albino here
mated to the ordinary cock produced fourteen young ones, all Common Sparrows ;
but one of her sons or daughters this year at the first attempt produces three
pure Albinos out of five young ones.
Of course it is possible that both parents are the offspring of the old hen ;
but with the hundreds of Sparrows we have on the place I should doubt it.
I am now introducing another Common Cock Sparrow to the old hen (I
let the other one go in the autumn), and I shall keep all the young ones to breed
from next year and note what happens. W. R. TEMPLE.

not take small insects, as mine feed greedily on them. Possibly the fact that
my Sun-birds have access to the open has something to do with this.
“ I am wondering whether C. amethystinus takes two or more moults to
acquire full plumage. My birds—a pair—reached me just over a year ago. The
male was obviously a young bird, but he soon assumed the coloured throat and
head, also showing a few dark feathers on the breast, wings and neck ; but other¬
wise he is still in the light-brown plumage of immaturity.”
The Societe Nationale d’Acclimatation of France has honoured the Editor
by conferring on him a beautifully-modelled and designed silver medal for various
species of birds kept and bred by him.
The Society writes :—“ Nous addressons toutes nos felicitations a
“ M. H. D. Astley en lui decernment notre Medaille d’argent, grand module.”

FLAMINGOS.
By Hubert D. Astley.
Through the courtesy of Sir Harry Johnston we are able to
publish a coloured illustration of the small Flamingo (Phceniconais
minor), which is to be found in such abundance in B. E. Africa,
especially on Lake Hannington.
Sir Harry Johnston, in his book on the Uganda Protectorate,
wrote:—“On Lake Hannington it is no exaggeration to say that
there must be close on a million Flamingos. These birds are mainly
collected round the northern end of the lake and on the submerged
banks which break up the deep blue-green of its surface. The shores
where they cluster, and these banks in the middle of the lake where
they are above the water’s edge, are dazzling white with the birds’
guano.
These Flamingos breed on a flat plain of mud about a mile
broad at the north end of the lake, where their nests, in the form of
little mounds of mud with feathers plastered on the hollow top,
appear like innumerable mole hills.
The birds having hitherto been absolutely unmolested by man,
are quite tame. (Written in 1902 .—Ed.) They belong to a rosy
species, Phceniconais minor, which is slightly smaller than the
Mediterranean Flamingo, but exquisitively beautiful in plumage.
The adult bird has a body and neck of rosy pink, the colour of
sunset clouds. The beak is scarlet and purple ; the legs are deep
rose-pink, inclining to scarlet. Underneath the black-pinioned
wings, the larger feathers are scarlet-crimson, while beautiful
crimson crescents tip the tertiaries and wing-coverts on the upper
surface of the wings.

Mr. Hubert D. Astley,
Apparently the mature plumage is not reached until the birds
are about three years old. The younger Flamingos very soon
attain the same size as the rosy adults, but their plumage when
they are full grown is first grey-white and then the colour of a pale
tea-rose before it attains its full sunset glory.
On the north coast of the lake the belt of Flamingos must
be nearly a mile broad from the edge of the lake outwards. Seen
from above, this mass of birds on its shoreward side is grey-white,
then becomes white in the middle, and has a lakeward ring of the
most exquisite rose-pink, the reason being that the birds on the
outer edge of the semi-circle are the young ones, whilst those far¬
thest out into the lake are the oldest. It is not easy to make the
birds take flight. When they do so suddenly and the shallow water
is stirred, the stench which arises is sickening. The noise of these
birds can be heard for nearly a mile distant. The kronk, kronk,
kronk of the million, mingled with hissings and spluttering&amp;apos;s and
splashings and the squish, squish, squish of those who are starting
on flight, combine to make a tumult of sound in the presence of
which one has to shout to one’s companions in order to be heard.
It is curious to watch the ungainly motions of these birds when
they wish to rise in the air.
Their flight has to be preceded by an absurd gallop through
the mud before they can lift themselves on their wings.”
Sir Harry Johnston says that as regards Lake Hannington
an important fact should be noticed, namely, that right out in the
middle of the lake and at intervals along its shores there are the
remains still standing of a former forest. These trees appear to
have been killed partly by the saltish waters of the lake, and in
part by being made the eyries of innumerable birds such as storks,
herons, and eagles.
Flamingos in captivity, unless they are in an enclosed aviary,
or on a very small piece of water where it is easy to catch them up,
should certainly be pinioned, or else sooner or later (probably sooner)
they will fly away, and more probably still be shot, as is the custom
in this enlightened country, just as many years ago my tame Storks
(Ciconia alba) were done to death by a farmer, when they settled in
a field near his poultry, his excuse being that he thought they were

“ Molly urns,” which, being interpreted, is ‘ Herons.’ But those
sort of people would shoot anything from a Humming Bird to a
Condor.
I find my Flamingos do very well on grain, wheat, oats, etc.,
but they are loose on a good sized pond, in the mud of which they
evidently find a great deal of natural food. Once acclimatized
Flamingos are fairly hardy, but care must be taken in the winter
that they do not become frozen in to ice. Indeed, during very hard
weather, they are best in a shed, with a flooring of sawdust or peat
moss litter.
They are fond of bread, melox, etc. when once they take
to it, and some of the dried fish mentioned by Mr. Sich in his notes
on Wading Birds would no doubt be beneficial, mixed with the bread
in a bucket of water.
My Flamingos have been busily moulting during June and July,
all the black pinion feathers being shed at once, after the manner of
geese. Flamingos are classified between the Storks and the Geese,
and are peculiar in having most curiously shaped bills, high at the
base and abruptly bent down in the middle ; moreover, these birds
feed with the bill upside down, the lower mandible being uppermost
under the water. In the young, the beak is short and straight. As
is now well known, the Flamingo sits on her nest with her legs
doubled under her, though it was originally declared that the nest
was a structure of mud sufficiently high for the bird to sit straddle-
wise on it, with the legs down on each side !
There are at least four species of Flamingos to be found in
South America : —Plicenicopterus ruber , P. chilensis, P. andinus, and
P. jamesi.
P. chilensis of Peru and Uruguay has green-grey legs with
red joints, the black on the bill reaching above the bend.
P. andinus of the Andes of Bolivia, Chili, and Argentina is
the largest of the family.
Flamingos may be looked on as one of the most extraordinary
developments of evolution through untold ages.

(Continued from page 27S).
Larks are sobrely-coloured birds, the Shore-larks being the
most attractive in colouring, but everybody with any appreciation of
music loves them. I have hand-reared a fair number of the European
Skylark, and one winter when the snow was thick on the ground
and birds were starving to death in thousands, my man (I had one
then to help me in cleaning up cages and aviaries and giving fresh
w T ater) took out my nets&amp;apos;&amp;quot; and brought me home thirteen: I kept
the three best and they made grand songsters : I have tried these
birds both in cage and aviary and certainly they sing better in the
former than the latter. I have at various times bought Skylarks
from the catchers, but I am not sure that I don’t prefer to hear them
singing from the sky rather than from a cage : I don’t believe for a
moment that they are unhappy provided that they have room to run
about, a nice fresh turf, and a good bed of sand to dust themselves
in, with the proper food ; and as to reducing the number of Larks
by catching a few, one might as well talk of reducing the sand of
the seashore by taking home a handful. Larks are hardy and long-
lived when properly cared for, and they soon become wonderfully
tame ; they are quarrelsome if two birds are kept together with
space to fight in.
I have had one or two Wood-larks, but did not care for them
so much as for the Skylark ; they sang less often and the per¬
formance was inferior to that which I have heard when produced
by birds at liberty : seeing that they spend much time on perches in
the day, I was at first surprised to discover that they always roosted
on the floor of the cage at night ; but the Alaudidce, as a family,
are certainly more terrestrial than arboreal in their habits. The
species which pleased me most was a fine Mongolian Lark given to
me by Mr. Abrahams about 1891 ; it was a grand songster and
wonderfully tame ; it always completed its song by mewing like a

cat : and, by imitating&amp;apos; that beast I could always start it off : it
lived to a good age and died peacefully.
I purchased a Sulphury Tyrant about 1895 which lived in a
small flight for about a year. I found it chiefly of interest on account
of its Kingfisher-like habits ; it would kill a minnow or a newt
exactly in the same manner, slapping it from side to side against its
perch before swallowing it : of course it would be risky to trust such a
bird with Waxbills, no doubt it could kill a small bird with one
blow of its enormous and powerful bill : it has an awful screech,
nasal and prolonged, which makes anyone jump who chances to be
looking at it : its colouring is pleasing but I don’t want another
specimen of the bird.
As previously mentioned I have tried to keep young Swifts
but with little success. I have hand-reared Wrynecks and found
them interesting. I only wish I could have kept them longer, the
strongest only lived from July to December. I am afraid the small
greenhouse in which I was then obliged to keep my birds was
hardly warm enough. In 1895, to save the bird’s life, I bought a
hen Green Woodpecker from a catcher ; but it absolutely refused
any kind of food, living or otherwise, and after severely damaging
the&amp;apos;large cage in which I had placed it, it died thirty-six hours after
it came into my possession.
I band-reared a young Cuckoo which was given to me on one
occasion, but I would never take on another. Of all the stupid, in¬
sufferably dirty and greedy little beasts he was infinitely the worst.
Eventually his gluttony and disinclination for proper exercise killed
him and he was not deeply regretted.
With the solitary exception of the Grey Parrot, which makes
an entertaining companion, I don’t care much for the Psittaci : they
are mostly noisy and destructive and many of them cannot be
associated with other birds without great risk. Of course there are
many beautifully coloured species among them and there are a few
whose ancestors must have been utterly devoid of artistic taste, to
produce such crude and unpleasing combinations in their plumage.
I have had the following species :—I once purchased a male Slender-
billed Cockatoo which I kept for exactly a week, when I sold it for
just double the price I had given for it : it was perfectly gentle and

Dr. A. G. Butler,
confiding, but certainly not talented, and I cannot say that I
admired it. Cockatiels I have twice had and from my second pair I
bred one male ; I still have his father ; this is one of the few
Parrakeets which one can trust with smaller birds : it is pretty, but
noisy and is very fond of vain repetitions.
I had a pair of Quaker Parrakeets in 1892, but did not much
care for them and eventually sold them to somebody who took a
fancy to them ; they are hard biters, but when they attempted to
bite me I got hold of the lower mandible so that the bird had to bite
upon my thumb-nail ; when it began fo pinch too hard I pressed on
the lower mandible and it left go at once. Like other Conures this
species is very destructive and rather noisy, but playful and con¬
sequently rather amusing. In 1903 or 1904 I purchased a pair of
Passerine Parrotlets, being tempted by their lovely colouring : the
hen died shortly afterwards but the cock lived until 1906 when it
was murdered by a hen Grey-headed Lovebird which I had given it
as a wife : if I could be sure of keeping and breeding this species I
should like to have an aviary full ; its beauty alone would be
sufficient to satisfy me.
Of talking-parrots I have only kept the Yellow-fronted
Amazon and the Grey Parrot, both excellent talkers and fond of
me ; but the Amazon used to fly into frightful rages when it saw
anybody who was inclined to tease it. These birds when
acclimatized are very hardy and long-lived and for anybody
who only wishes to keep a single bird, I would always recommend a
Grey Parrot or Amazon, bought when quite young and taught to
talk by its purchaser. Of course most of these birds are incorrectly
fed from the time when they are imported, are more often than not
treated as though they were human beings, offered all kinds of
unwholesome table-scraps by their owners, and consequently soon get
out of condition and die young. I have had two species of the genus
Palceornis, the Pose-headed Parrakeet, of which I purchased two
young pairs in 1893 ; of these one pair had been pinioned and did
not live long. From the other pair I bred one female, but these
pretty Parrakeets killed several smaller birds in their aviary and the
young bird so persecuted her mother that I had to confine the latter
in a flight cage to save her life. I sent the father and daughter to a

show at the Crystal Palace where they were at once snapped up at
the price which I had originally paid for the two pairs.
Two examples, both males, of the Moustache Parrakeet were
sent to me anonymously in 1912 ; one of these died three months
later, but the other is in splendid health and plumage as I write. I
cannot get this bird to eat anything but seed ; it is very destructive
to the woodwork of its aviary but is not noisy, such sounds as it
utters would lead one to imagine that it was constantly discontented
or in pain ; it is rather wild, but I believe tolerably happy.
I have had five Madagascar Lovebirds at various times, and
I never wish to have another ; they are nervous, spiteful and
murderous little wretches ; the males ai’e ready to quarrel with any
bird, though twice their own size ; and with their powerful beaks
they are likely to have it pretty much their own way ; the
females I found even worse. In the early days of my bird¬
keeping I obtained a pair of Rosy-faced Lovebirds from Mr.
Abrahams hoping to breed from them. In those days they fetched
a fairly high price ; however I soon regretted my purchase, for they
not only spent the whole day in uttering an exasperating rattling
scroopy shriek, but they attempted to kill every other bird which
approached them : happily for me Mr. Abrahams consented to take
them back. Years later I became possessed of two hens which I
turned into a small flight cage where they lived a quiet uneventful
life, occasionally laying eggs of which the majority got smashed by
being dropped from the perch. Take them all round I am not
smitten with Lovebirds.
The only Platycercus I ever had was a Rosella given to me by
a gentleman who had got tired of it. I found it a quiet confiding
bird, fond of a smooth caterpillar when it could get one. This
was an old bird when it came into my possession and died a year or
two later. Of course I have had and bred Budgerigars, but only
of the normal green type : at present I have one male only. I
should think that an aviary filled with the blue variety would be
delightful ; lucky are those who have a chance of breeding that
pretty little bird !
Doves and Pigeons always appealed to me ; although, with
the exception of the African Bronzewings, they are a most quarrel-

Dr, A. G. Butler,
some Order of birds ; nevertheless they can be kept safely with birds
of other Orders, since they usually do not interfere with them. I
never had any species of Fruit-Pigeon, nor any species of Columba
excepting one or two domesticated sports of the Rock-Pigeon ; but
of Turtle-Doves I have still a hand-reared example of the British
species given to me some years ago by my friend Mr. F. W.
Frohawk. It is much wilder even now than a fresh-caught bird would
be, rattling about the aviary and so scaring the other birds whenever
a stranger (especially if a lady) passes. I have kept two species of
Zenaidince, the Martinican Dove and the Bronze-necked Dove ; they
are very pretty, but exceedingly quarrelsome ; at least perhaps I
ought not to speak too positively about the latter, because they did
agree well with Necklaced Doves, which they even assisted in
incubating their eggs ; but with other species they certainly were
always at war and particularly in the breeding-season.
Of typical Turtle-Doves distinct from our British species, I
have naturally had plenty of both forms of the common Barbary
Turtle. On one occasion I tried to cross the cock of the white
variety with a white Fantail Pigeon, but she pulled out his feathers
in bunches whenever he approached her, so that the attempt failed.
Of the Half-collared Turtle Mr. Frank Finn gave me a pair in 1893,
but as I could not give them an aviary to themselves I failed to
breed them, although they laid and attempted to sit several times.
In 1899 Major Horsbrugh gave me what purported to be a second
pair ; about 1901 (through the carelessness of a servant) one of them
escaped into the garden and was never recovered, the other died in
1902 and was identified at the Natural History Museum as a
Deceptive Turtle. In 1894 I purchased, as a pair, two cocks of the
Necklaced Dove, one of which killed the other. In 1897 I secured
a hen for the remaining cock and bred young which were
subsequently killed by a Nicobar Pigeon. In 1900 I bought another
supposed pair, which proved not only to be two cocks, but to be
Spotted Turtle Doves ; these I sent to the Zoological Gardens. I
had one Senegal Turtle given to me by Mr. Seth-Smith in 1902 ; it
is a pretty little species. I paired it with Barbary Doves, but it
would not breed.
The Geopeliince are far more quarrelsome than the typical

Turtle-Doves and the Bar-shouldered Dove is especially so. I have
had three examples, two cocks and one hen, the latter only lived a
year, and the two cocks, some years later, escaped into the garden
at the same time as what I suppose was a Deceptive Turtle-Dove
(vide supra ) and were not recovered. I heard that the servant of one
of my neighbours was much scared by one of these birds flying
close past her as she was walking in the garden. The Peaceful
Dove is an exception in the Subfamily, for it really is a tranquil bird
and not pugnacious ; consequently other Doves persecute it. I have
had three pairs and found that the hens were more delicate than the
cocks. I only tried them in indoor aviaries, so never bred them.
The closely related Zebra Dove is a spiteful and quarrelsome little
wretch and gave the Peaceful Doves a bad time, so long as the two
were associated in the same aviary. I never purchased more than
one pair. Of the pretty little Diamond Dove I have purchased three
pairs, two pairs in 1896 and one in 1903. In an indoor aviary I
found that they quarrelled incessantly but never bred ; in an out¬
door aviary they breed freely, and more satisfactorily (as Mr. Seth-
Srnith tells us) when several pairs are associated. They do not
appear to be so hardy as some Australian birds, since I lost the
cock and all the young birds reared in 1907 by allowing them to
spend the winter out-of-doors. At the present time one cock bird
only remains alive. &amp;apos;
Of the Peristerince I have only had two species which, in
spite of their small size, I found the most quarrelsome of all Doves.
The Steel-barred or Picui Dove is especially so, and when he has a
chance does not scruple to barbarously mutilate members of his own
species. I purchased three pairs and subsequently what proved to be
two cocks ; the hens are delicate and I never succeeded in breeding
the species. Of the Passerine Dove I bought a pair in 1899, but
the hen and two others which I purchased subsequently all died
egg-bound. Eventually I turned the cock out into an aviary with
many other birds, some of them considerably larger than himself,
but his impudent charges at them soon made him master of the
entire community ; he fell in love with a lien Bronzewing Pigeon
and always roosted beside her : in 1911 he died.

(Continued from page 220).
NlCROSiS. —An infectious disease of a rather mysterious character,
which attacks many birds and occasionally causes loss among
members of the parrot family: Roseate Cockatoos and Bourke’s
Parrakeets being the commonest victims. It is incurable and
may assume either an acute or chronic form, the bird in the
latter case becoming very emaciated.
Eye DISEASE. — An infectious disease of the eye, sometimes found
among newly-imported King, Crimson-wing and Polytelis Parra¬
keets and certain Parrots, usually resulting in loss of sight;
the eyes, in bad cases, becoming entirely closed up. The eyes
may be bathed with warm water and directly afterwards with a
diluted solution of rose-water and zinc. Cases of recovery are
rare.
EGG-BINDING. — Usually the result of over-fatness or an attempt to
breed at a low temperature. Keep the bird very warm and
place a few drops of olive oil in the vent at fairly frequent
intervals. Giving oil at the beak is naturally useless, but is
sometimes done by those who are ignorant of avian anatomy.
WORMS. —Parrots occasionally suffer from both round and tape
worms, and these parasites, if allowed to increase unchecked,
may cause the serious illness and even death of the bird. A
dose of from 3 to 5 grains of cina given daily in the food
or water will usually effect a cure.
The subject of disease naturally leads to that of disinfection.
For ordinary, everyday use, Condy’s Fluid makes a harmless and
satisfactory wash, but neither Condy’s nor Jeves’ Fluids are of the
smallest avail in dealing with the germs of the more dangerous
diseases. A parrot cage, which has been occupied by a bird suffer¬
ing from septic fever, for instance, should be scorched over with the
flame of a painter’s lamp and afterwards soaked in strong carbolic,
finally receiving a wash of plain water to remove any trace of the
poison which may cling to the perch or bars. A small indoor aviary
should, as far as possible, be subjected to the same treatment as a

cage, but an outdoor aviary containing&amp;apos; earth and grass is far more
difficult to deal with. For the disinfection of an outdoor aviary, or
indeed any large area of ground containing avian disease germs,
nothing gives such satisfactory results as common salt applied at the
rate of three cwt. or more to the acre. Gaslime or soot are also
useful, but as the former is rather poisonous, the birds should be
removed for several weeks after it has been applied, and not returned
until it has become thoroughly dissolved and washed into the soil
by the rain, a process which may be accelorated by digging it in.
Ordinary lime is absolutely useless as a disinfectant. It does not
even kill parasitic worms, and why it is so often recommended I
cannot imagine.
Having so far dealt more or less generally with the parrot
family, I will, in conclusion, say something about those genera and
individual species of the treatment and characteristics of which I
have had some personal experience. As I wish to avoid the common
political (?) error of laying down the law in matters of which I am
wholly ignorant, I shall say little or nothing about birds I have
never myself kept, and this will I hope be some excuse for the ex¬
tremely “patchy” and uneven character of the following notes.
Amazon Parrots ( Ghrysotis ) are, as I have said once before,
especially suited to cage life, for no other species keep in finer
plumage in close confinement, live longer, or appear more contented-
Most Amazons, with the possible exception of the magnificent large
island races, have a considerable talent for learning to talk, although
the cocks are usually far better performers than their mates. Amazons
quickly become attached to their owners and are extremely fond of
being petted, though some are a little apt to give an unpleasantly
sharp nip in moments of excitement. This weakness, together with
a tendency to an over liberal use of their loud and raucous voices,
constitutes their chief failing. In an avairy, my rather limited
experience leads me to consider them far less quarrelsome than
parrakeets, and many species readily become inured to cold, the
island forms being, I am told, the most delicate. When allowed
complete liberty, they, as a rule, stay well, give little trouble and
may often be safely released full-winged.
Amazons should be fed on hemp, canary, millet, wheat, and

oats, with fruit, dry bread and plain biscuit they are usually free
bathers. The sexes are very much alike in appearance, but the cock
is in most cases a larger, bolder, and brighter-coloured bird than the
hen, with a larger head and heavier beak.
Amazons are less subject than most parrots to infectious
disease, a great advantage to those who have to buy their birds when
newly-imported.
PCEOCEPHALUS PARROTS. — The best known member of this
family is the Senegal, an active, amusing little bird, with (in the
case of the cocks) a fair talent for talking. Its principal failings are
a tendency to bite hard in moments of excitement and unprovoked
annoyance, and a thin unpleasant scream, which however some in¬
dividuals do not utter. It appears doubtful whether Senegals or
any of their near relatives could be wintered altogether in an un-
heated aviary as, like many African Parrots, they appear to dislike
very low temperatures. The food should be the same as that of
an Amazon.
The Posocephali are very susceptible to Grey Parrot fever,
and newly-imported birds often develop this fatal malady after
appearing in the best of health for some days after leaving the
dealer’s shop.
Coracopsis PARROTS. — A small and very distinct family of
hardy parrots, characterized by their remarkably sombre plumage.
They do well in cages and should be fed and treated like Amazons.
When acclimatized they can safely be wintered out of doors.
Greater Yasa Parrot (Coracopsis vasa ). — An amiable and
lively bird which, with a little encouragement, becomes very tame
and docile. It has a fair aptitude for learning to talk and readily
imitates various noises it may happen to hear, showing an especial
preference for such as are of a loud and hideous nature. Its natural
cry is a kind of whistle, varied by unpleasant grunts and squawks.
It is trustworthy with large parrots, but is apt to be mischievous
with small ones. The sexes are much alike, and I am not aware
what, if any, external differences exist between them.
LESSER Yasa Parrot (Coracopsis nigra ). — Yery similar to
the last; mentioned species, but much smaller. It is a much less noisy
bird, becomes very affectionate and behaves well in mixed company.

Yasa, but rather smaller and browner. In spite of its sober colour
it is rather pretty, with a large dark eye, reminding one of the
smaller falcons.
ECLECTUS PARROTS. — A family of brilliantly-coloured parrots
in which the sexes present a remarkable contrast in colour, the cocks
being more or less green and the hens crimson. Most of the different
species resemble one another so closely that one is tempted to wonder
whether they are anything more than local races of the same bird.
Eclecti should be fed on Canary, millet, oats, hemp and sun¬
flower with nuts and plenty of fruit and green food and an occasional
piece of sponge cake. When kept in cages they are, as a rule, dull
and stolid, though occasionally a tame one learns to talk and
becomes quite a nice pet. Eclectus Parrots are decidedly sensitive
to cold and should always be carefully protected from draughts
and not exposed to sudden changes of temperature. They are
extremely liable to contract septic fever and should never on any
account be placed in an aviary which has contained a case of this
disease. In buying an Eclectus, always see that its eye is clear and
bright and the feathers of the head unruffled. If the eye looks
watery have nothing to do with the bird or its cage companions
and do not believe the dealer’s assurance that it is merely suffering
from a cold in the head. In mixed company I found Eclecti most
inoffensive birds, suffering themselves to be unmercifully bullied
without making any attempt at retaliation. Their cry is very loud
and harsh, but is hardly ever uttered unless they are in exceptionally
good health and spirits or much alarmed- One may keep an Eclectus
for months without knowing that it possesses a voice at all.
Cockatoos. —The habits of the various species of Cockatoos
and their needs in captivity differ so widely, that nothing can
profitably be said of the treatment of the family as a whole.
Greater Sulphur Crested Cockatoo (Gacatua galerita).
One of the best known members of the family. It does well in a
cage, though greatly benefited in health and appearance by a certain
amount of liberty. It is also very hardy and when properly accli¬
matized can stand any amount of cold. The food should consist of
Canary, millet, hemp, wheat, oats, maize, fruit, dry bread and plain

The Marquis of Tavistock,
biscuit. Sulphur-crests are readily tamed, become very affectionate
and learn to talk well, but, like all their relatives, they are capable
at times of producing the most ear-piercing yells. They have been
successfully kept, and I believe bred in this country at complete
liberty and are certainly most attractive birds when seen flying at
large, though unfortunately they are very destructive. It is said
that the iris of the hen’s eye is much paler than that of the cock,
but I must say I have never been able to observe this distinction
in any White Cockatoo except the Rose-crested.
The Greater Sulphur- Crest isspiteful in mixed company and
its relative the Lesser Sulphur-Crest ( Cacatua sulphured) is even
worse.
Salmon-crested Cockatoo ( Cacatua moluccensis) a quaint
and beautifully-coloured bird which should be fed like the Sulphur-
crest. It is very hardy, but when kept closely confined in a cage is
apt to become a feather plucker and should therefore be supplied
with plenty of wood on which to exercise its powerful beak. The
Moluccan Cockatoo makes a good talker and becomes absurdly
tame and confidential, allowing its owner to take every kind of
liberty with it. It is well able to make itself heard upon occasion,
but it is not quite so noisy as some of its relatives. The hen is
smaller than the cock, and has the iris of the eye very dark red
instead of black.
Leadbeater’s Cockatoo ( Cacatua leadbeateri) . — A very
beautiful bird, but sometimes shy and unfriendly in disposition, It
is quite hardy and should be fed like the Sulphur-crest. It is not
to be trusted with weaker birds.
Bare-eyed Cockatoo ( Cacatua gymnopis ),• — A hardy bird,
readily tamed, When kept in a cage it should never be given hemp
or sunflower, which are most injurious to it. It stays well at liberty
but is very destructive.
Slender-billed Cockatoo (. Licmetis nasica ). — Hardy and
should be treated like the Sulphur-crest. It is a good talker and
becomes very tame and gentle.
Roseate COCKATOO. — This well-known species becomes very
tame and affectionate and is not particularly spiteful with other
birds, but it is noisy and a poor talker. Talented specimens are,

however, sometimes met with and I once owned a charming tame
female which never screamed at all. At liberty Roseates are very
attractive and are less mischievous than White Cockatoos. They
are, however, difficult to start, and it is important that the
hens, at any rate, should be perfectly tame where an acclimati¬
zation experiment is attempted. The birds should be placed in an
enclosure with cut wings, and it may even be necessary to keep
them from flying until they breed, which they are usually quite
willing to do if they have plenty of room and unlimited quantities
of grass to feed on&amp;lt;
If the plan is successful and the birds stay when they are
full-winged, it is a wise precaution to catch up the breeding hens at
the end of every January and keep them in confinement for three
months. Otherwise they are almost certain to attempt to nest too
early and in consequence die egg-bound.
The cock Rose-breast has the iris black, the hen red or hazel.
Gang-gang Cockatoo ( Gallocephalon g aleatum). Hardy
when properly acclimatized, but at first very sensitive to cold.
Gang-gang&amp;apos;s become very affectionate pets, but are noisy and
seldom learn to talk. They should never, when caged, be allowed
hemp or sunflower seed. They stay and do well at liberty, but
must be released cut-winged, except in the case of an adult pair,
when the cock may sometimes be released full-winged and his mate
not allowed to join him until he has been flying loose for some
months. The head of the cock is scarlet, that of the hen grey.

hemp, sunflower, monkey-nuts and Brazil nuts—a diet which would
kill most Cockatoos in a few weeks, but on which this splendid bird
thrives admirably. Fruit, bread and green food is seldom appre¬
ciated, but smooth caterpillars are eaten greedily as well as the
small white grubs found inside oak-apples. (In collecting the oak-
apples reject all those which have a small round hole, marking the
insect’s exit). Wasp grubs, gentles and mealworms are usually re¬
fused. When buying a Black Cockatoo always be sure to find out
to what diet the bird has been accustomed, for if it has ever been
used to sunflower-seed it will often starve to death rather than touch
hemp and vice-versa. Some Banksians are imported on plain Canary

The Marquis op Tavistock,
but this seed is not sufficiently nourishing and birds which will
touch nothing else seldom thrive.
Banksian Cockatoos do well in cages, but are not seen to
any advantage in such close confinement. When taken young they
are easily tamed and made dignified and charming pets, loving to be
noticed by their owner and allowed to sit on his shoulder, though
they have a curious objection to being stroked or having their beads
rubbed, the gentlest of them tolerating rather than enjoying such
attentions. Adult Banksians which have never been tamed are
extremely nervous and intractable, and even when thoroughly
reconciled to captivity are terribly upset by a sudden change of
surroundings, refusing food for days in a strange place and uttering
a grating scream of fear whenever a person approaches them. Black
Cockatoos are not so hardy as most of their white cousins, and
while able to stand a certain amount of frost are very sensitive to
the effects of cold fog. My experiment with these birds at liberty
ended in failure, but rather owing to a series of unfortunate accidents
than to their unsuitability for life under such conditions. I did not
find them particularly destructive and some individuals never damaged
the trees at all. The adult cock Banksian is entirely black with a
scarlet bar across the tail. The hen is spotted and barred with
yellow and yellowish red. Anyone who desires to attempt to breed
this species should be careful not to allow his cock to become too
tame. If he does, the bird will transfer his entire affection to bis
owner and display nothing but fear or dislike towards his intended
mate.
Great-billed Black Cockatoo (Calyptorhyncus macro-
rhyncus ).—A local race of the Banksian, differing in the rather
larger size of the beak.
Western Black Cockatoo (Calyptorhyncus stellatus ).—
Much smaller than the Banksian and with a rounder crest. The
cry of the male stellatus is much shriller than that of the male
Banksian and more nearly resembles the call of the female of the
latter species.
MACAWS.—Food : Canary, wheat, oats, maize, hemp, sun¬
flower, nuts, fruit, green food, dry bread, plain biscuit and stale
sponge cake. Macaws are very hardy birds, seldom ill when pro-

perly cared for, and in the case of the large species, at any rate, very
indifferent to cold. They often make excellent talkers—the blue and
yellow being the best—and become much attached to their owners,
though they are sometimes treacherous with those they do not know.
Their chief drawbacks are their destructive propensities and deafen¬
ing cries. Macaws generally stay w T ell when allowed their liberty,
and if attached to their owner and familiar with their surroundings
can safely be released full-winged.
The rare Blue Macaws—Lear’s, Hyacinthine, etc., are as
hardy as the commoner kinds, but appear more inclined to stray if
allowed complete liberty- They are generally very docile and
affectionate and are rather less noisy than the other members of the
group. They are not particularly aggressive in mixed company,
although they are well able to assert themselves. Macaws are very
difficult to sex.
CONURES. —A large family of Parrakeets of small or medium
size, the majority of which inhabit South America and the adjacent
islands. They are easily kept, either in cage or aviary and most of
the common species can be wintered out of doors. Conures are
lively and intelligent birds, easily tamed and capable of learning
to talk : they are, however, extremely noisy, very destructive
and often quarrelsome with other birds, especially those not nearly
related to them. They should be fed and treated like Amazon
Parrots, but should only be allowed hemp seed in small quantities,
as they sometimes suffer from fatty degeneration of the liver. The
sexes are usually much alike.
QuakerPARRAKEET {Myopsittacusmonachus )—A very hardy
bird, indifferent to cold even when newly imported and closely
resembling the Conures in disposition. It is usually spiteful with
Parrots and Parrakeets, but tolerably inoffensive towards birds of
other orders. If allowed complete liberty it usually stays well for a
time but ultimately wanders away, and it is more destructive than
any other bird of its size I know.
Lovebirds.- —A small genus of diminutive short-tailed
Parrots, which despite their popular name, are not conspicuous for
amiability towards their neighbours or even for the idyllic character

The Marquis of Tavistock,
of their domestic existence. They are quite untrustworthy with
weaker birds of other orders.
Madagascar Lovebird (Agapornis cana ).—A hardy and
well known species in which the cock has the head and neck
grey and the hen green. It should be fed on canary, millet and
hemp seed, with grass and other green food. Madagascars stay
fairly well at liberty and will sometimes breed, but with me they
have sooner or later fallen victims to various ailments of which
total paralysis of the legs is the most common.
Black-cheeked Lovebirds ( Agapornis nigrigenis).—k
hardy and attractive little bird in which the sexes are so alike as to
be practically indistinguishable. A number of breeding pairs will
nest together in harmony in a large aviary, but non-breeding birds
are very apt to pluck and molest their neighbour’s young and should
therefore be kept by themselves.
Black-cheeks are useless for turning out as they invariably
migrate in August and September, after breeding.
Rosy-faced Lovebird ( Agapornis roseicollis). —A very
beautiful species but the most vicious of all its family. It should be
given plenty of fruit and sponge cake in addition to seed. A pair I
once tried at liberty did not stay.
Passerine Parrotlet ( Psittacula passerina ).—Commonly
called “ Blue-winged Lovebird.” Passerine Parrotlets are quite
hardy when properly acclimatised, but require plenty of heat on
first arrival. They should be fed on millet and canary seed with
stale sponge cake moistened in water. Green food may be offered
them but they often refuse to touch it. In spite of their grave
and demure appearance these little birds are much given to in¬
dulging in sudden and sanguinary fracas amongst themselves and
should never be overcrowded either in cage or aviary. If it should
be necessary to keep a number of them for some time in a confined
space, it is a wise precaution to separate the sexes. Bluewings
do fairly well at liberty and where Owls are not too numerous
might suceed in establishing themselves- The hen is of a nearly
uniform green colour and lacks the blue rump and secondaries which
adorn her mate.

and oats, with fruit and green stuff. The Palceornidae do well in
cages and keep in far better condition than the Australian Parra-
keets. The cocks are not difficult to tame and make nice pets, some,
such as the Indian King-neck, learning to talk well if taken from the
nest and reared by hand. Palseornis Parrakeets are not very
susceptible to infectious diseases and the majority can safely be
wintered out-of-doors, although it is not always prudent to allow
them to attempt to breed at low temperatures, as the hens are
rather subject to egg binding. Most species have an immature
dress which they wear for a considerable period, during that time
they are most puzzling birds to sex. The palceornidce are not
unduly quarrelsome.

—Deserves special mention on account of its extreme sensitiveness
to cold. It should never be exposed to a temperature below 60 deg.
and 70 deg.—80 deg., would probably be necessary for the success of
a breeding experiment.
Great-billed Parrakeet (Tanygnatlms megalorhyncus).
—Food : Canary, millet, wheat, oats, hernia, paddy-rice, fruit, and
nuts. This brilliantly coloured and grotesque bird is not often
imported. It certainly cannot be described as beautiful, but makes
an attractive addition to a collection on account of the oddity of its
appearance and its absurd actions when tame. It is generally
supposed to be sensitive to cold, but some newly-imported Great-aills
I turned out this spring in very rough plumage, endured a spell of
cold weather (including sharp night frosts) without the slightest
injury. The hen is more “ dumpy ” in build than the cock, with
a shorter neck and smaller beak.
POLYTELIS PARRAKEET. —A small genus of Australian
Parrakeets bearing a strong&amp;apos;resemblance to the Palaeornidce of the
northern hemisphere and having nothing in common with the broad¬
tails. They are fairly peaceable birds and can be wintered out of
doors in a sunny, sheltered aviary. The food should consist of
wheat, oats, canary, millet, a little hemp, fruit and green food.

The Marquis of Tavistock,
a little sunflower, fruit and green food, the first-mentioned seed being
a necessity for them, as without it they generally fail to keep their
condition. They are perfectly hardy when properly acclimatised but,
like most Parrakeets, are very sensitive to cold when newly imported.
They are also highly susceptible to septic fever and take the disease
on the smallest provocation, even when in the best of health. In
disposition, they are spiteful and cowardly, and show hut little
affection for even their own kind. When tame, however, they
may be quite gentle with their owners. The adult cock Crimson¬
wing can easily be distinguished from the hen by his black
mantle, but I know of no way in which young cocks can be
recognised with any certainty. Among the immature birds
brought over from Australia the males sometimes outnumber the
females by 8 to 1, and as they are said not to assume full plumage for
three or four years, one may have to wait a long time before being
certain of possessing a true pair. Speaking from very limited
experience I should say that Crimson-wings might do well at
liberty.
King Parrakeet (.Aprosmictus cyanopygius ).—The King
Parrakeet should be fed and treated like the Crimson-wing, which it
resembles in disposition, being a great coward and bully in mixed
company, although fairly friendly towards its own species, a number
of cocks living together in harmony as long as there is no hen near
them. The King Parrakeet is essentially an aviary bird and is very
hardy. It is quite unsuited to cage life, and in close confinement
generally appears dull, listless and unhappy and not infrequently
falls a victim to fatty degeneration of the liver. Kings are very
susceptible to septic fever and also suffer from eye disease so that
in buying newly-imported birds the eyes should always be carefully
examined. Hens have the head and upper breast green and appear
to lack the light green wing stripe which characterizes the adult cock.
Young males also have green heads for a considerable time, but light
feathers appear on the wings at a fairly early age. King Parra¬
keets stay moderately well when allowed their freedom, being very
dependent on artificial feeding. They should be turned out with
cut wings.

known bird and one of the hardiest and most amiable of the parrot
family. Unfortunately they are useless for acclimatization purposes,
being strongly migratory, utterly destitute of any homing instinct
and quite unable to fend for themselves when deprived of artificial
food during the winter months.
Budgerigar (Melopsittacus undulatus ).—What has just been
said of the Cockatiel applies to a great extent to this charming little
bird, as far as its behaviour at liberty is concerned. It is not quite
such an inveterate wanderer when first released, but it seldom stays
more than a few months and its small size renders it peculiarly
liable to fall a prey to Owls.
LORIKEETS (. Trichoglossus ).—Most of the old writers con¬
demn the Brush-tongued Parrots as a delicate and unsatisfactory
family in confinement and after a series of unlucky experiences with
some of the commoner kinds, I am driven to heartily endorse what
they have written. Nevertheless Lories and Lorrikeets have been
kept with great success by a few aviculturalists who, I believe, have
fed them on a sweetened mixture of unseasoned marmite (made the
colour of brandy) and banana crystals, with or without the addition
of Horlick’s Malted Milk. I have at different times owned upwards
of thirty Lorikeets, but not one of them did I succeed in inducing
to partake of this mixture. Consequently I had to feed them on
seed, fruit, milk, sponge cake, fig, &amp;c.. with the result that all, sooner
or later, fell victims to fatty degeneration of the liver and fits.
Others, I hope, will have better luck than I ! Lorikeets are not
very sensitive to cold, but they like a snug box to roost in. They
are peaceable among themselves but intensely vicious with all other
birds, attacking even those which are four or five times their size.
Tame Lorikeets stay well at liberty, but wild ones usually give
disappointing results. They are just as susceptible to digestive
troubles when flying at large as when kept in a cage.
[There are only three species, viz. : The Barraband, or Green Leek ; the
Rock Pebbler, and the Queen Alexandra, for the latter undoubtedly belongs to
this genus, although dubbed Spathopterus, merely on account of one spatulated
feather in the primaries of the male. ED.]

(Concluded from page 281 .)
In concluding my account I must conduct you from the bird
room out of the house across the old stone bridge which spans the
moat, and so along a broad flagged terrace which leads into an apple
orchard where there is an aviary. Not much in it ; but what there
is, attractive.
A pair of very tame Yucatan Jays ( Ci&amp;solopha yucatanica ),
which used to be in the Bird Boom, but evidently required more
space, and moreover were dangerous there, for if any small bird was
flying about and happened to settle on the bars of the Jays’ cage,
they would instantly do their best to catch it, and that would have
been the finish. So they are in this roomy aviary with a natural
floor of grass, and a snug house to go into.
These Yucatan Jays are a very beautiful unbroken ultramarine
blue on back, wings and tail, the head and underparts being pure black.
They are smaller than a Hunting Cissa, and of a graceful shape with
longish tails. Like all their family, very mischevous, they are ex¬
ceedingly tame, delighting in having their head’s scratched in Parrot
fashion.
A male Senegal Bustard ( Trachelotis senegalensis ) and a pair
of Cuban Quails are, as yet, the only other occupants. The Bustard
is small as Bustards go, looking more like a large Courser, and
uttering at times a very loud note, not unlike that of a Guinea-
Fowl’s ‘ Come back,” but with a distinct pause between each call,
and a stress on the second word.
It is a great pity that his mate, which was in poor condition
when she arrived, should have died in the winter. The male’s
principal colouring is sandy-chestnut.
The Aviaries (&amp;quot;proper) are close by, divided from the orchard
by a stone wall, standing in their own ground, a spacious lawn, and
are surrounded on three sides by a hedge of Fuchsias {Gracilis).
The building is sheltered on the north side by old barns, and in the
autumn, various shrubs will be planted between the barns and the
aviaries.

It is to me always exceedingly difficult, as I do not specialize
in any particular genus, to keep down numbers. One makes up
one’s mind not to overcrowd, but one’s mind apparently does not
brook being ordered about; something tempting is offered ; one says
“ Just one more bird or pair of birds in that compartment ” and so
it goes on ! And goes on against one’s real inclinations, for I do not
care to see one’s aviaries looking like a bird shop.
It is not natural to mix too many species from various parts
of the world together, and the flights of my aviaries are not spacious.
I must weed out some : but what ? Take one partition for instance.
A pair of Chestnut-breasted Blue Bock Thrushes, the only pair
probably in Europe. A pair of Cossy.pha caffra —Cape Bobin Chats ;
again decidedly choice. A pair of Bed Cardinals from Yucatan, a
smaller race, the male with a longer and more sharply pointed crest
than the better-known North American type, and more vermilion ;
yet they are not C. phoeniceus. A pair of Blue Birds ( Sialis ). A
Cat-Bird—a solitary widow w T ho builds every year and lays gorgeous
blue egg&amp;apos;s. A pair of Orange-headed Ground Thrushes ( Geocichla
citrina). A pair of Diamond Doves and a Hooded Pitta.
None of these would I care to part with, and yet if I gave up
the compartment to just three pairs of birds, say, the Blue-headed
Bock Thrushes, the Blue Birds and the Bed Cardinals, there would
be more likelihood of successful nesting, and the effect would be
better. Two many birds confuse the eye, besides the risk of their
quarrelling.
Two of the six compartments are occupied by Parrakeets and
Doves. Three species of the former. Queen Alexandras—five males
and two females, not altogether. Hooded Parrakeets, one pair by
themselves, and two males in another partition, and one pair of
Barrabands (Green Leeks).
In with them are Barred-Shouldered Doves, Diamond Doves
and a pair of Crested Doves, but the latter are going out, for there
are already seven or eight flying about, a pair of which have had a nest
in a hawthorn tree which overhangs the long paved terrace bordering
the moat. These Crested Doves are very tame, walking about close
to people, and paying little attention even to several Pekingese dogs
which have been taught to leave them unmolested. The flight of the

My Birds at Brinsop Court.
Crested Dove is very swift, more resembling that of a partridge or
quail, the wings, after several rapid vibrations, being held immovable
(as in soaring) for some distance until the impetus flags, when they
are again used to carry the bird along. I have never seen the
Crested Doves soar upwards and down again from the summit of a
tree, as the Palm and other doves do, and also our Wood Pigeon
when the males are displaying : and the coo of the Crested Dove is
very weak; yet it carries a good distance.
The display of the male is extremely pretty, the tail being
thrown up and spread out, the wings showing the beautiful metallic
greens and violets, being opened out also.
But I must return to the aviaries, for the idea of turning out
the one pair of Crested Doves made one wander in the garden. In
another partition there are such birds as St. Helena Waxbills, Ruddy
Fire-Finches, Hooded and Columbian Siskins, only a male of the
latter, glossy blue-black above, brilliant daffodil-yellow below; and
also a pair of Purple Sugar-birds, which seem to do very well in
spite of having been out in the fickle changes of the English climate,
really hot as it was during part of April, and then so chilly that one
was glad of a fire to sit by.
So that I believe these Purple Sugar-birds will stand being&amp;apos; in
the aviary during the winter, when the radiators warm the roosting
houses and the electric light enables them to feed up till any hour of
the evening that they wish to.
Rose-breasted Grosbeaks and Black-headed (I don’t think
much of the latter) occupy another partition, as well as another pair
of Blue Birds, always a delight; indeed there are few birds more
lovely and none more cheery. A male, when first the sunshine
begins to warm up in February, opening and shutting his wings,
warbling softly like an English Blackbird in the distance, his upper
parts coloured like the blue of the sky, his breast with the tones of
the old red sandstone of Herefordshire, is most beautiful.
A pair of Seed Snipe are also with these others; tripping
about on short legs and Plover-like feet. Apparently quite hardy.
And also a pair of the handsome Violet-necked Doves from Jamaica,
always nesting in the spring and summer, and invariably choosing
some foolish site, where the eggs or the young tumble off. I should

but myself.
I have kept foreign birds for about ten years now, beginning,

as we nearly all do, with a pair of Budgerigars which I bought on a
visit to the South of France, and at present I have about fifty birds
of different kinds. I am quite sure that no birds belonging to any
other member of our Society have as much travelling as mine have,
because for five months of the year my home is in Edinburgh and
the other seven months I live in Stirlingshire, and as in neither
place can I leave the birds they must travel backwards and forwards
with me.
In the country house I have a nice bird room, about 15 feet
long by 11 feet wide, with big cages 3 feet by 3 feet by 6 feet along
both sides, leaving a passage between. This room has a door window
which stands always open and a frame of wire netting fitted on the
outside in case of accidents. These cages or compartments contain
one pair Redrumps, one pair Cockatiels, one pair Diamond Doves,
one pair Black-cheeked Lovebirds, one pair Red-collared Lorikeets,
four pairs Yellow Budgerigars and two large compartments for small
Finches and Waxbills, which are fitted up with branch perches and
cosy sleeping boxes. In smaller cages at the door end of the bird-
room I have Mesias, Pekin Robins and Long-tailed Grassfinches,
In another room I have, in cages, Violet-eared Waxbills, Rainbow
Bunting, Nonpareil and Indigo Buntings, a Grey Parrot, a Senegal

Parrot and a Lesser Hill Mynah. The latter is a splendid talker and
is most amusing. These birds are all very tame and are great pets.
Owing to the difficulty of taking my birds to and from Edin¬
burgh I can only keep a certain number, so when I am tempted with
anything new I am compelled to part with one or two of the other
birds to make room for the new ones. Notwithstanding all these
difficulties and drawbacks my birds give me a very great deal of
pleasure, and I do not consider anything a trouble that adds to
their comfort, health and happiness.
I feed them on the usual seeds, soft food and milk sop suitable
to the different kinds that I have at the moment, also green food and
banana.
The floor of the bird room is linoleum with a thick covering
of sand. I also have a good bird room in our house in Edinburgh,
but it is not so cheerful and bright as in the country. However, so
long as the birds are warm and comfortable they get through the
winter months very well. I generally show some of my birds at the
Scottish National Cage Bird Show held in Edinburgh at New Year
time and hitherto have been fairly successful.

There is not much difficulty in keeping Gannets in tolerable
health for a year or two if a regular supply of fish is obtainable and
their feet do not get diseased. This is an obstacle which seems hard
to guard against, swellings springing up on the soles, which in time
make the birds lame, and nothing seems to heal them.
Gannets fight but little in captivity, whatever they may do on
their native rocks, probably because the sexual impulse is dulled or
lacking, and it has only once happened that a Gannet has been
known to kill another Gannet, and then most likely it was because,
refusing to feed, it was driven to desperation by hunger.
No amount of frost or cold seems to hurt a Gannet, that is, an
old Gannet, for the young ones less inured are more delicate. The
tame ones here described, would awake quite happy after a night of

twenty-two degrees of frost spent in the open, not a whit the worse
for it. A small shed, open on four sides, which was put up for their
benefit, they would never make use of, possibly because they were
afraid of it and suspected a trap.
Great heat they cannot endure, and on a sultry day in sum¬
mer the poor birds may be seen standing for hours with their
mandibles apart in great distress and evidently only able to breathe
with difficulty. And this may be remarked in a wild state also in
very hot weather on the Bass Rock, where the cliffs get heated if
exposed for long to a bright sun, and the Gannets at once suffer.
A Gannet is very adept at catching a fish when thrown to it from a
little distance, but they are much less clever if the fish falls into the
water, or else it is some disinclination which makes them slow in
picking it up.
A FEW NOTES ON WADING BIRDS.
By H. L. SlCH.
My experience of keeping Waders is not very great because
it only began in 1911, with various intervals, owing to rats and
escapes. I do not think that there are many members who keep
Wading Birds, except as a mixture for varieties’ sake among their
other birds ; if there are they do not write much for the Magazine.
My greatest difficulty is to get hold of any birds of that kind,
and when got most of them arrive in such a dreadful condition that
they die before one can bring them round. Their wing feathers are
cut almost to the bone and do not moult out. Their breast bone is
like the edge of a knife ; their feet are often very sore and ulcerous.
They are only to be obtained from Autumn until early Spring; at
the worst time of the year and have not seen any water for weeks,
perhaps months ; if they get the least chance they will soak them¬
selves with water and shiver for the rest of the day or, worse still,
get a cold or pneumonia and die.
Food I found was another difficulty. I am getting over that,
but my birds are only the common species, not being able to get
anything else. Turnstones I have never seen advertised. My pond

A few Notes on Wading Birds.
is not deep enough for swimming birds, besides it dries up in
summer, so Water Rails are barred.
The aviary is 48ft. x 29ft., with a pond three or four inches
deep in the middle of the aviary, which stands on stiff clay, not the
best soil for the birds.
The following is a list of the species that I have tried to keep.
CURLEWS. They did very well and kept down the mice and also
the nestlings of a few small Finches as well.
OYSTER Catchers did not thrive very well, not getting enough
nourishment.
Green Plover were quite a failure and only lived about seven
months, though one, which was given to me after some brute
had chopped off half its wing, which never healed, lived for
quite a long time.
The Knots always get very fat, and some are now coming into
colour.
The Dunlins are also doing the same, but not getting too fat.
The Ruffs come into colour and moult at the proper time, so I
consider that they are thriving properly. The Reeves are
difficult to get, there are now six Ruffs to one Reeve.
Black-tailed Godwits. Two, which I bought just a year ago,
have very much improved since last year, though their feet
are not right yet ; three others which I had died soon after
they arrived.
Two Golden Plovers never got over the dirty state in which
they arrived and soon died.
A Little Stint lived for a few months, but did not get the right
food.
Two Ringed PLOVERS were doing very well when some rats got in
and destroyed nearly all my Waders, but did not eat any of
them.
I have one REDSHANK at present, but its legs are yellow not red.
There is a fish food which I have used for some time, it
seems to be a help to these birds and makes the food more tasty.
I am sending a packet to our Editor for his opinion on the matter. &amp;apos;&amp;apos;
[It would seem to be a decidedly useful food.—ED.]

THE RED-BREASTED MERGANSER.
Mergus serrator.
By Hubert D. Astley.

The length of this duck is twenty-four inches. The male in
full dress is very handsome, with his double crest, head and upper
part of neck black, glossed with green ; against which the bright
crimson beak and eyes (the legs being of the same colour) make a
conspicuous contrast. The middle of the neck is white, and the
base of the fore-neck, buff with dusky striations. The patch of
white feathers, margined with black at the sides of the fore-neck at
once attract the eye. Back, black; wing coverts white with two
narrow black bars. The flanks grey, with narrow pencillings of
black and white.
The female’s head and neck is dull brownish red, and is
altogether paler, lacking the distinctive markings of her mate.
There is an eclipse plumage after the breeding season.
During the latter period the Bed-breasted Mergansers are
found along the coasts and rivers of Scotland in many parts, and it
is common on the Orkneys and also breeds in the Shetlands, as well
as the Inner and Outer Hebrides. It does not breed in England,
but it occurs in Ireland, in Ulster, Connaught, and Munster. Beyond
the British Isles it nests in Iceland and Southern Norway, in Sweden,
Finland, Bussia and North Germany, and also in Denmark. In
America too, Labrador, Greenland, etc.
To England, it is a winter visitor; a bird of passage in the
autumn and the spring. As a rule the nest is placed on the ground

amongst rank vegetation, heather, etc., sometimes amongst cairns of
stones, or even in a hollow in an old stone wall.
Mergansers are great eaters. Eleven good-sized salmon-parr
have been taken from one bird. Small eels and coarse fish of all
kinds, as well as shrimps and little crabs swell the list of their
varied menu.
They will live well in captivity, provided they have fish or
flesh, but they can subsist, when accustomed to it, very largely on
greaves, melox, etc., but of course the larger the piece of water
stocked with natural food, the better.

By D. Seth-Smith, E.Z.S.
Our Editor has appealed to me to send him some notes
for the September Magazine, and so, on a wet day on my holiday
far from London I am writing a few notes, though as I have not
my note-hook with me, it is possible I may have omitted some
points of interest, and as I left a week ago these notes may not
be quite up to date.
Amongst the most interesting of recent arrivals may be
mentioned a specimen of the Great Courlan (Aramis giganteus ) a
bird that may be described as something between a Crane and a
Rail, with a superficial resemblance to, and about the same size as,
an Ibis, but with a less curved bill. It is brown, with each feather
centred with white, giving it a very speckled appearance. It walks
with an upright carriage and a peculiar jerky motion of the body.
A. giganteus or %&gt;ictus occurs in reedy swamps in Central America
and the Southern States of North America as well as some of the
West Indian Islands. To the south of its range occurs the closely
allied form, which is probably merely a local race known as the
Scolopaceous Courlan. These two are the only representatives of
this genus and form a distinct Family of birds.
This is the only example ever received of Aramus giganteus,

though one specimen of A. scolopaceus was obtained in 1874, which
lived but a few days.
The pair of Cotton Teal, given to us by Mr. Ezra some
months ago and already mentioned in this journal by Mr. Astley,
appear to be thriving well in the small aviary at the end of the
Diving Bird. House. Mr. Astley very kindly gave us a second pair,
but they were some that had been delayed for some weeks on the
Continent, and the long close confinement resulted in their contract¬
ing&amp;apos; tuberculosis, from which they soon succumbed.
An example of the Black-necked Stork ( Xenorhynchus asia-
ticus) received on July 28th is an important addition to the collection
as it is a good many years since a specimen was represented in the
collection. It is a large and handsome Stork with greenish black
head and neck, black wing-coverts and white body and a most
formidable bill. It is locally distributed in suitable localities
throughout India, Ceylon, Burma, and right away to Australia.
The Small Bird House and Summer Aviaries contain just now
a very interesting collection, as a good many new birds have been
added recently. Mr. Heumann brought home a fine collection of
Australian birds at the beginning of July, and of these the Zoological
Society acquired several, and a number were most generously pre¬
sented by Mr. Alfred Ezra. Foremost among these may be mentioned
the charming Blue Wren, one of the most familiar of the birds of
the Eastern State of Australia. The male when in colour has the
crown and back of a most brilliant enamel-like blue, relieved by jet
black, his long tail, which is carried erect, being of a dull indigo blue
The little hen is his exact count erpart in shape and carriage but of a
mouse-brown, with a reddish tinge round the eyes. In Australia
these little birds go about in family parties, generally consisting of a
male in colour, one or two out of colour, distinguished from the
female by the bluish tail and absence of red round the eyes, and
several females. They occur in almost every garden where there is
plenty of cover, frequently coming out of the low bushes and hunting
tiny insects in the grass or flower beds. It will be remembered by
the older members of the Avicultural Society that Mr. Reginald
Phillipps actually bred this species in his garden in London about
ten years ago.

Mr. D. Seth-Smith,
Another very charming bird, of which we have a pair, is the
Black and White Fantail ( Bhipidura tricolor). It is a most familiar
bird and a great favourite in most parts of Australia where it is
called “Wagtail,” “Willie Wagtail,” or “ Shepherd’s Companion.’’
Its long, fanlike tail is constantly swayed from side to side, as it
settles on a post, branch or the ground with a fly or other insect in
its bill which it has captured in the air. Its head, neck, chest, back
and tail are black, its underparts and a streak above the eye, white.
A cock and two hens of the White-browed Wood-Swallow ( Artamus
superciliosus ) are also very desirable additions to our collection, for
they too are most attractive birds and very handsome. But of
more interest, because we have never had them before, are a pair of
White-shouldered Caterpillar-eaters (. Lalage tricolor ), the male of
which is black and white and the female brown. There are five
species of Honey-eaters in the collection of Australian birds, namely
the Wattle-bird, the Spiny-cheeked, the White-cheeked, the Yellow-
tufted and the Lunulated Honey-eater. Of these the White-cheeked
is the most beautiful, a singularly handsome bird, black and white
with conspicuous white cheek-tufts and yellow on the wings.
The Australian Robins ( Petrceca ) are amongst the most
striking of all the Australian birds, and we are very glad to have on
deposit from Mr. Ezra a pair of the Scarlet-breasted Robin (P. leggi)
the male of which has the breast of flaming scarlet; the forehead,
underparts and a patch on the wings white, and the head and
back black. The female is brownish in colour with a tinge of
scarlet on the breast. These and a hen of the Flame-breasted Robin
(P. phcenicea) are the first specimens of the genus that have ever
been exhibited in the Zoological Gardens.
The Sunbirds are becoming very popular just now with avi-
culturists, since a few enthusiasts, notably Mr. Alfred Ezra have
shown that they are by no means difficult birds to keep, some species
being apparently hardy in fact. I have no doubt that before long
these lovely birds will be imported freely. At the Zoological
Gardens we have a very fine male of the Southern Malachite Sun-
bird ( Nectarinia famosa ) recently purchased. It is a common
species in South Africa and an extremely beautiful one.
Four other rarities which have been presented to us by Mr.

Ezra, are a Velvet-fronted Nuthatch ( Sitta frontalis), four Red¬
headed Bullfinches (. Pyrrhula my throcep ha la) , a Blue-headed Rock-
thrush ( Petrophila cinclorliyncha) and a Golden-throated Barbet
(Cyanops franklini ), the first three of these are new to the col¬
lection, and of the latter we have only had one specimen before.
All are from the Himalayas.
Still one other rarity, new to the collection, is a very beautiful
little Hawk ( Gampsonyx swainsoni), from Central America, received
by purchase from a dealer. It is about the size of a Hobby, very
dark blackish brown above, with whitish forehead and chest with a
complete whitish chestnut collar surrounding the neck and chestnut
flanks and underparts.
Breeding results this year have not been great. Since we
took up the breeding of pheasants four or five years ago we have
done fairly well on the whole, but each succeeding year has brought
with it certain unforeseen diseases, a state of things which I fear is
unavoidable where the same ground has to be used year after
year for rearing.
Our rare Douglas Quails laid a number of eggs which we
hatched in an incubator and the chicks are being reared in a foster-
mother and appear to be thriving well. Eggs laid by some hybrid
quails, which we bred last year between the Douglas and Californian
Quails, two closely allied species, have proved to be quite sterile.
Last winter a pair of Crowned Pigeons hatched out a young
bird in the Western Aviary, and it was not surprising that at that
inclement season the young bird was not reared. Now they have
bred again, and when I left a week ago the pair were brooding&amp;apos; a
newly-hatched squab which we hope may be successfully reared.
Green Cardinals, Ruddy and Madagascar Turtle-doves have
all reared young, but the most interesting event, should it come to a
successful conclusion, will be the breeding of the New Guinea Rifle-
bird. In the spring, Mr. Brook kindly lent us a hen of this species
which had previously laid eggs in his aviary. She was put out with
one of our cock birds in the summer aviaries. No sign of nesting
was noticed for a long time, but the day before I left, July 31st, the
keeper Bailey discovered the hen sitting tightly upon a well-made
nest of twigs and dead leaves. Of course we did not disturb her

and do not know how many eggs she has, but she took no notice of
our presence in the aviary, sitting as though glued to her nest, which
promises well.

ORNITHOLOGY.
By Lord Brabourne.
In a well-known novel by a well-known and popular author
the following passage occurs :—“ In the shadow overhead flew and
chattered crowds of Green Paroquets and glossy Crows, while here and
there we could see a Bird of Paradise drooping its smart tail-feathers
amid the foliage. A little further and deep in the forest the ear
caught the tap-tap of the Woodpecker, the snap of the Toucan’s
beak or the deep trumpeting of the elephant. Once we startled a
leopard that gazed a moment at us with flaming eyes, and then was
gone with a wild bound into the thicket.” All this along a jungle
track in Ceylon, frequented by religious votaries and sight-seers.
Having no acquaintance with eastern bird-life the reference to
Birds of Paradise left the writer comparatively unmoved, but the
snapping of the Toucan’s beak ” sent cold shivers down the
back.
A few flocks of “ brightly-plumaged screaming birds flitting
their way from bough to bough, etc., etc.,” present flashes of warmly
picturesque local colouring, which both novelist and traveller alike
seem unable to resist; especially is the second an offender in this
respect. And while he may make a delightful book, he fixes in the
mind of his reader an impression doomed to a certain disappoint¬
ment, should he ever visit the scenes described. The reason is
obvious.
Imagine an observant traveller arriving at an Estancia in
middle Argentina about the end of September. He might
possibly notice, perched on the fencing of the garden of that
Estancia, two recent arrivals from the north ; a small livid, red
bird (. Pyrocaphalus ) and one of the same family, but widely
different in its style of beauty ; grey and white with a jet-black

head, a concealed yellow crest and with two greatly elongated tail
feathers, the well-known Scissor Tail Tyrant ; a third might be
added to the picture ; a snowy white bird with black tips to the
wings (Taenioptera irupero). A month later he might be travelling
by rail through the same country ; he would certainly see from the
railway carriage small flocks of Roseate Spoonbill and Wood Ibis,
collected here and there by the occasional lagunas, on their way to
spread themselves over the Province and the Argentine Pampas.
Such pictures of bird-life are not easily forgotten, so that
they group themselves in the memory to form a blur of coloured
recollection. The traveller may never visit that country again, but
assuredly in the forthcoming book (“ Six Months Impressions of a
Continent ” or some such name) he will casually refer in glowing
terms to the brilliant nature of the Argentine bird-life.
Still undoubtedly the haphazard traveller does occasionally
have wonderful ornithological sights thrust upon him, unsought for.
And it is my intention to relate a few of these from South America.
Everyone must have his own particular idea of what the
general effect of Tropical bird-life should be. The writer has only
once seen his for a few hours in the Delta of the Orinoco. There is no
great river here, but countless small mangrove and palm-fringed
channels with sluggish currents. The steamer takes the Macareo,
the principal and least tortuous of these, to port of Spain. Occa¬
sional pairs of both Blue and Yellow and Red and Blue Macaws flew
over ; not “ soaring like huge Hawks,” as one writer puts it, but
moving in quick-flapping trailing flight as if they knew that
particular palm, where most fruit grew and meant to arrive as
quickly as they could. “ Soaring Hawks ” were however represented
by perhaps the most graceful of all the family, the Swallow-tail Kite.
An occasional Cocoi Heron was there ; and the small Blue Heron
(Butorides striata) in rather greater numbers would rise and fly
croaking across the water. Some exigency of river navigation takes
the steamer rather closely and suddenly round a bend, and from
almost under the bows rises a living streak of fire, as a flock of a
dozen or so of Crimson Ibis flap quickly away. The fauna of that
region has been graphically described by Mr. Beebe in “ Our Search
for a Wilderness.”

There was no great variety of bird life ; nor were there great
numbers of any one kind ; but those, that were seen, seemed to fit
with the general atmosphere and surroundings—intensely tropical
in appearance. In fact the lack of bird-life on the large South
American rivers has been the subject of frequent comment. The
distances are too great.
Still one beautiful species is always present : the Blue and
Chestnut Kingfisher (Ceryle torquata), a bird about the size of a
Pigeon, is seen on all the South American waterways from Caracas
to Magellan (the Southern Argentine and Chilian form G. stellata is
slightly smaller). Indeed the bird seems to prefer the larger rivers
to those backwaters and sheltered “ riachos,” where the generality
of waterfowl congregate in swarms ; and is equally abundant on the
Paraguay River about Asuncion, as on the Orinoco below Ciudad
Bolivar.
A scene from the Island of Trinidad was memorable for the
numbers of one particularly gaudy species. Prom the town of
Siparia in the southern part of the Island runs a road through the
tropical forest to the coast. And all along this road at frequent
intervals were nesting-colonies of the Yellow and Black Cassique
(Gassicus cela, Persians). Their lively spluttering, bubbling notes
and the long nests swinging from the trees gave this road a
peculiarity of its own. The birds actually had a noisy colony in the
Church-yard of Sipari. Plere and there were to be seen the single
nests of the larger and non-gregarious Cassique (Ostinops clecumanus),
The nature of the vegetation is that of the “ High Woods ”
described by Charles Kingsley in “ At Last ” ; and the birds had
probably all deserted the surrounding district, to avail themselves of
the isolated trees, incident upon partial forest-clearing by man,
from which to hang their nests-
Birds of the Hawk family, though some species occur in
flocks especially on migration, cannot be considered as generally
gregarious. But sometimes hundreds may be seen together. The
scene is on the Paraguay River a few miles above Asuncion and on
one of those stretches of water hundreds of miles inland, the straitness
and breadth of which give the effect as of the river itself merging into
the horizon ; the glory of the great South American rivers. On the

west is the low-lying palm and bamboo-edged bank of the marshy
Chaco ; on the east the slightly higher shore of Paraguay proper.
Very far ahead is seen a line of birds continually passing singly, in
pairs, in sixes and in twenties, a never-ending stream flying steadily
from west to east. Not for an instant is there a break of more than
a few yards in the chain. Only when the river steamer is right
upon them, and they rise in their flight to top it, are they seen to be
the Sociable March Hawk ( Rostrhamus sociabilis), a bird of that
deep blue-black colouring, peculiar to certain genera of Hawks
(Urubitinga, Leucopternis • etc.), with a salmon-orange cere and feet
and a bright crimson iris. The steamer passes, the birds sink
again to the original level of their flight ; and as far as the eye can
watch them over the stern the stream continues.
Nor is it necessarily mere numbers or gaudy colouring, that
hold most readily the attention or are best remembered. The writer
was once in the Llanos of Venezuela in February. From all
accounts the Llanos would appear half the year to be a swamp and
the other to be parched almost to desert dryness. This was
towards the end of the desert season. The word “ bish ” accurately
conveys an impression of the vegetation of that part of the Llanos.
There are no trees larger than the English oak ; and the narrow road
is edged on each side by dense scrub, which gradually gives place to
the south to scattered clumps of trees and more open country. A
glance at the map gave one the idea of a country well-watered by
several rivers : but these appeared at that season mere sandy beds.
A few mud-holes still remained and at one of these rather more
deeply sunk in the ground, and not more than a few feet square, a
strange quartet of birds was discovered. A Wood Ibis and a
Roseate Spooonbill rose heavily from under the mule’s very nose and
perched in a tree near by ; whilst on a small bush overhanging the
water sat two large Black Buzzards ( Urubitinga urubitinga) . These
remained perched, merely curious at the sight of a human animal
persuading another animal to drink slush. The writer had been
familiar with all these three species 2,000 miles or more further south
in Argentina ; one of the forms of the Ruby Tyrant ( Pyroceplialus ),
a common Argentine bird, was abundant ; and it needed little
imagination to transfer the whole scene to that country.

And let it be said, that on that occasion during thirteen days
continual riding not once was the snapping of “the Toucan’s beak ”
heard. He was not even seen. Probably they were all on their
vernal migration to the Island of Ceylon.
As a comfort to those, who fear the rapid and total
extinction of all Egrets, it may be stated, that on the morning after
arriving at Ciudad Bolivar (the centre of the export trade in
Egrets, and from which during the preceding year plumes to the
value of £49,705 had been exported) over 60 of the larger kind
(Egretta Egretta ) was seen flying eastward over the town of Soledad
on the opposite bank ; to the Laguna Mamo, a swamp about 40
miles away, as the native boatman, who seemed to be in their con¬
fidence, said. The same man pointed out a rookery of Wood Ibis
about a mile up stream from Soledad. There were several scores
which could be seen with glasses from Ciudad Bolivar. He said that
he knew of no other rookery of the kind, to which the birds
habitually resorted for many miles either up stream or down.
To the Ornithologist the first shot fired in a bird-thronged
marsh must ever present a novelty, similar to that of the lifting of
the curtain on a transformation scene to the expectant child. In
general scenic effect there can be little variation the world through :
but to the bird-watcher there will be abundant difference of detail
in each district ; differences perhaps more of sound than of sight,
since the confused scurryings of the startled wildfowl, make
the singling out of individuals difficult, unless very well marked.
To those acquainted with the Wealdon country, imagine the
North and South Downs ; imagine all the angles, breaks and irregu¬
larities immeasurably distorted and exaggerated. Here and there on
the sky-line are copses ; replace these by jagged snow-peaks ; in
the middle of the plain is the rush-margined Lake Junin or Chinch-
aycocha about 22 miles long by 7 wide, the largest of the Andean
Lakes except Titicaca and Poopoo. Here and there grow coarse,
strong, scrubby grasses, but the pasture is generally beaten
fiat by the bleak wind and hail or else cropped close by flocks of
Llamas and weedy sheep. The Amazon conjures up visions of
tropical heat and steaming damp. Yet the Amazon is there.

tributary, rises in Lake Junin, it is permissible to regard anyone of
the peaty rills, that fell into the Lake, as lesser tributaries them¬
selves. The whole scene is at an altitude of over 14,000 feet, is
unspeakably bleak and miserable but is typical of the great Andean
Plain ; the Puna country of Peru and the Paramo of Equador.
The pale pinky smudge against the brown rushes not many
hundred yards away is a long line of Flamingoes. Nearer at hand are
the dark forms of small parties of Glossy Ibis ( Egatheus ridgwaym,
the bird of the neighbourhood most in evidence. An Andean Gull
( Larus serranus), or a Carrion Hawk ( Ibyeter megalopterus ) in search
of prey sails into view. The lake is not a mile away. But the
distance is too far for the would-be collector laid low by mountain
sickness. The nausea of the sportsman at that altitude has again
saved the lives of many birds ; and all the Duck, Rails, Waders and
larger fowl, that throng the rushes and the edges of the lake remain
undisturbed.
Notes of this nature penned in Peru can scarcely be left with¬
out some reference to the great feature of Peruvian bird-life—the
guano ” producing birds. These actually number but five
species : Three Cormorants (Phalacrocorax cirriger, Bougainvillii
and Vigua) ; one Gannet (. Sula variegata), and a Pelican ( Pelecanus
thagus).
The Peruvian Coast is 1,400 miles in length. There are 44
narrow valleys and the rest is the most arid, sterile desert.
Generally the coast is a straight, surf-beaten, sandy shore ; here and
there the Andes or an isolated spur rise abruptly from the ocean-
Throughout this length of coast all day and every day pass and
re-pass, keeping just outside the breakers, solemn flocks of
Pelicans ; larger flocks of Gannet, vanishing every now and then
with a dart and a splash upon some victim. In the winter come
hugh hordes of Gulls (chiefly Larus modestus and dominicanus)
and small flocks of the beautiful Inca Tern ( Larosterncc inca ).
The Gulls rest by day and roost by night in vast masses on the flat
sand stretches immediately behind the sea shore, and on near
approach rise up with “ hoarse pelagic cries ” and confusing wing-
flappings in all directions. The great body of Cormorants keep farther
out to sea or around the islands. Long lines are to be seen in the near

and middle distance, great clouds of them far out and low above the
horizon. Often a steamer will pass for an hour at a time through
straggling flocks of sea-fowl.
The above is no exaggeration ; it is no picture of some far off
coast or island, inaccessible, sea girt and little known. Except for
the Gulls, of which only a few remain during the summer, it is to be
seen with little variation for 365 days in the year ; and is to be seen
equally from the uninhabited sands of the Sechura Desert, as from
the shore, less the one hour’s walk from the most southerly point
served by the Lima tram cars.
The foregoing notes refer to a period of slightly over six years
actual residence in South America, during which no opportunity was
lost of observing birds and their ways ; the writer has jotted down
incidents that depict spectacular Ornithology likely to attract the
attention of the least observant ; so that it may be seen that in that
region of the world most richly endowed with bird-life—“ the Great
Bird Continent ”—how few and far between these wonderful sights
really are.

Few of the Doves and Pigeons can surpass the Bronzewings
for beauty and brilliance of colouring, and none excel the African
species for amiability towards their associates : to this general rule
however the quaint little Cape-Dove is an exception ; since males of
that species, and especially in the breeding-season, fight each other. I
I have only had two males, so that I never was in a position to attempt
to breed it; a feat which the late Dr. Russ considered difficult of
accomplishment. With the Tambourine Dove, after some years of
failure I was at last successful, as already recorded in this Magazine.
Mr. T. L. Bonstow gave me a pair in 1902 which bred in 1906, 7,
and 8 : the male of this pair is still in good health as I write.&amp;apos; 1 &amp;apos;
* This species was bred shortly afterwards in this country, but I doubt
whether even now it has been bred on the Continent.

Of the Blue-spotted Dove I have had two males only, one
which I purchased in 1903 which died towards the end of 1913, and
a second given to me shortly afterwards by Mr. Allen Silver, which
is still in good health. Of the lovely little Emerald Dove Mr.
Bonstow gave me a South African female in 1902 and in 1903 I
purchased a West African male ; they differ a good deal in the size
and tint of the metallic green wing-patches, those on the Southern
bird being much larger and less golden than those on the Western
form, the colouring of the whole of the plumage in the former is
also darker : whether these differences are constant or not is a point
only to be satisfactorily decided after a careful comparison of many
individuals, but it seems probable that the West African form is typical
and that the Southern one is Beichenow’s C. chalcospila, caffra : or
is it volhnanni ? These subspecific names are a nuisance : if the
birds are constant in their differences why not call them species ?
The very beautiful Maiden Dove seems to be rarely imported, but in
1905 nearly a dozen arrived in the London market, and of these I
believe I received the first pair. Unhappily the Maiden Dove is
certainly more delicate when first imported than most members of
its group and my hen died nearly four months after she came into
my hands, the other birds of that species also died in a disappoint¬
ing manner, so that it was impossible to breed the species: my
male bird lived until nearly the end of November 1908 : it was a
charming bird living in perfect friendliness with its two relatives the
Blue-spotted and Emerald Doves and I was very sorry to lose it.
This consignment of Maiden Doves had the metallic wing-spots of a
glittering crimson colour: the green-spotted and crimson-spotted
forms were at one time considered at least subspecifically distinct,
but recent travellers have pretty w T ell disproved that notion : to what
purpose then is the naming of the far less distinct local variations
of the Emerald Dove ?
Of the far less peaceful typical Bronze wings I have had one
male and two females of the Australian Green-winged Dove, one
pair of the gorgeous Australian Bronze-wing and one pair of the
common Australian Crested Pigeon : none of them ever bred suc¬
cessfully in my aviaries, though I tried the two first both in indoor
and outdoor aviaries : they are very hardy and long-lived birds and

Dr. A. G. Butler,
I really cannot see why the Crested Pigeon which breeds freely in
our parks when turned loose should not be as competent to find food
to sustain it during the winter months as our English birds, if turned
into woods well away in the country. One can hardly speak cor¬
rectly of the acclimatization of a foreign species if food has to be
provided for it during the winter months.
Of the Geotrygonince or so-called “Ground-doves” I received
a supposed pair (two hens) of Wells’ Ground-dove in 1898, one of
which was killed in 1900 by my Crested Pigeons, the second died
early in 1906 : they are quite nice birds, but the name Ground-Dove
is not applicable to them more than to any other doves. I purchased
a fine pair of that delightful bird the Bleeding Heart Pigeon in 1897,
and had I then possessed a suitable outdoor aviary I might have
succeeded in breeding it, but indoors it would neither build nor lay ;
the hen died in 1899 and the cock in 1900 to my great sorrow : they
really are ground-birds, since they spend the greater part of the day
upon the earth. In 1905 I bought a pair of Wonga-wonga pigeons
and soon had cause to regret it on account of the awful monotonous
noise which the cock kept up from morning to night; the hen died
towards the end of the same year and I got rid of the cock by
exchange.
Of that magnificently coloured but Vulturine bird the Nicobar
Pigeon I bought a pair in 1897, which I found rather a nuisance on
account of their absurd nervousness and murderous spitefuluess : in
themselves they are singularly stupid and uninteresting as pets,
spending hours sitting motionless on a branch even when out of
doors in a heavy fall of snow : they seemed quite indifferent to cold
and would spend a winter night in the open part of the aviary and
in the morning I used sometimes to see them sitting contentedly
with a little pile of snow on their backs. The female died in 1902
and the male I think in 1904.
I have kept both the Californian and the Chinese Painted
Quail; I purchased a pair of the former about 1896 or 7, and
turned them into an outdoor aviary where the hen laid many eggs
in corners, but never incubated them : these birds were so frightfully
wild that I willingly sold them again at the end of six or eight
months. I secured two pairs of Chinese Quails in 1897 and was

much pleased with them, they made nests in comers and laid, but
were disturbed by other birds so that none were reared : I found
these birds quarrelsome in the breeding-season, they are hardy and
long-lived, the last survivor of my birds was unhappily killed by my
man, who blundered into the aviary to change the drinking-water
one evening when it was growing dark and trod upon the poor little
mite, completely flattening it.
In 1899 I purchased a “pair&amp;quot; of the Barbary Partridge
which proved to be two cocks : their plumage was very handsome,
but they were stupid nervous birds : one of them went blind and
died in about a week, the other seemed healthy enough but died
about five weeks later. A British Bed-legg&amp;apos;ed Partridge which was
caught in Beckenham was brought to me some years ago and I
turned it out into my larger garden aviary : it was rather wild and
only lived for about a month after it came into my hands.
I never purchased any Hemipodes, but years back my col¬
league Mr. W. R. 0. Grant asked me to take care of some Black¬
necked Hemipodes which he had obtained from Mr. Abrahams until
he had a place ready to turn them into. I had them for about three
weeks, keeping them in a long runner: they were pretty active little
birds and I was sorry when the time came for me to part from them:
I think they would have done well in an aviary.
This completes the list of the species which have been in my
possession since I first began to keep living birds : it may perhaps
be some use to those beginning aviculture by indicating the dis¬
positions of various species, thus enabling them to decide what birds
to associate in the same aviary and what to keep alone or in pairs ;
but it must be borne in mind that as individual human beings differ
from their fellows in disposition, so in birds also one occasionally
meets with a saint in a family of sinners and vice versa : therefore
one must not judge of the nature of a species by the behaviour of a
single example ; but, in the case of notoriously pi’edacious birds, one
need not hesitate about keeping them apart from all weaker than
themselves.

This has been on the whole a good nesting season here, but
there have been too many infertile eggs in some species ; a complaint-
common among several of my friends who keep ducks, and I am
quite at a loss to account for the failure of many of the eggs, though
I believe that in Cinnamon Teal eggs, which have hatched in¬
differently, the trouble is inbreeding&amp;apos; in the parents, there never
seem to be any wild caught Cinnamons on the market. But from
two pairs of the nearly-allied Blue-winged Teal I have had a won¬
derfully good percentage of fertility, every egg in the first nest of
each pair was fertile, and only two failed to hatch, the second nests
were also very good ; the last lot of ducklings for the year hatched
this morning (July 23rd&amp;apos;, these were a late nest of Bluewings,
augmented by one horrid looking egg which I found in a nest box
up a tree on June 15th, and which I did not set for over a week as
I had no others to go with it at the time, and also because I had no
hope of it hatching, since it had a deformed shell, rather crinkled
and discoloured in patches and very pointed at both ends, yet to
my amazement a beautiful little Binged Teal emerged from it. This
was the only egg which the Binged Teal laid to my knowledge, she
probably dropped the rest of her clutch in the water.
I am not aware that Binged Teal have nested previously in
this country, though they appear to breed freely on the Continent.
Next year I hope to get a full clutch from them. Other interesting
hatchings have been a silvery grey Shoveller, which unfortunately
died when ten days old, and a pure white American Wigeon with
normal eyes, which is at present doing very well and should be
reared bar accidents.
Mr. Alec. Duncan kindly sent me nine White-faced Tree
Ducks’ eggs, from a pair which nested with him in 1912 and 1913,
but he failed to rear the young, so this year he asked me to try. All
the eggs hatched, and seven are at present doing well, they are
nearly a fortnight old but look rather delicate little things and
grow slower than most ducks, but I hope to rear some of them.
Altogether twenty-one species have nested with me this year,

A TAME BULLFINCH.
By Katharine Currey.
My pet Bullfinch, “ Cherry,” is so clever and tame that I
think a little account of him might be interesting. If he were sure
to remain I would release him and let him clear the rose-bushes of
invisible (to us,&amp;apos; insects and blight, but I cannot risk losing him.
He soon made himself at home in a ‘ waggon ’ cage, that has done
duty for many predecessors, with a wooden shelter at one end, and
here he pipes and whistles in the sunshine till I let him out in the
lawn cage to fly among boughs and enjoy his large shallow bath.
On cold wet days I let him out in the room to fly about and tease
the Red Tanager to his heart’s content, who, in his turn, when loose
in the room, ‘ goes for ’ the Bullfinch who is in his cage.
Cherry soon became tame, and came flying&amp;apos; into my hand for
a hemp-seed, and if in a naughty mood (for he is very wilful) he
refuses to go to bed, he hides under a chair or in the folds of a
curtain, where he crouches quite still, but letting me catch him.
One day he flew out into the hall, but soon returned. From that
day he watches for the door of the room to open, and has been
several times all over the house, doors and windows having hastily
to be shut. The house has two wings connected by an old landing
lit by a skylight. This is a world of delight and mystery to him,
and calling joyfully he explores every corner, perching on old presses,
hiding in china bowls and cups when he hears my footsteps, and
sitting up on a ledge in the skylight where it is impossible to
reach him. If he was lost pro. tern, all I had to do was to call

“ Cherry,” and a loud whistle came in answer. He looked most
fascinating at Christmas-time on a mistletoe bough hanging in the
hall, where he sat among the berries singing his cheery little song.
One day an upstairs room door was left open when he was loose
and of course he flew in and on to the window sill. I entered by
another door, close to the window, and called him. By good luck it
was raining and a big drop splashed from the eaves on to the window
sill just in front of him. This frightened him away and back into
the room, whence he flew downstairs and into his own room.
Another day the door was left ajar, and he seized the oppor¬
tunity, flew out over the hall, along a passage and out at the garden
door. There he sat on a hawthorn and sang his little song in
triumph. There was a pair of Bullfinches in a large cage on the lawn,
so the only way to get him back was to leave him alone and pretend
not to care if he came back or not (for little birds, like children, are
apt to do exactly the opposite to what they think they are wanted to
do). I merely placed his waggon cage against the other bullies’ cage
with the door open, and hemp seeds in it with his other food. Then
I went about my usual morning avocations, gardening, bird-tending,
etc., and took no more notice of him. He flew into a white cluster
rose-bush and sat there feasting on invisible insects ; thence he flew
on to a yew-hedge, getting tit-bits, and lastly on to a juniper tree,
where he found delicacies in the old bark. Suddenly, there he was
on the bullies’ lawn-cage, swearing at the cock and bowing to the
hen. I called “ Cherry,” and off he was again on the rose-bush.
Birds, like animals, are for ever making precedents ; if they have
done anything once they do it again. So with Cherry. First the
rose-bush had to be scoured for insects, then the hedge, lastly the
juniper. Then again, there he was on the cage. He caught sight of
his own cage on the ground and hemp seeds in it. He peered in
sideways, whistled, and flew off again. The same round as before
had to be gone through, but he had discovered the hemp-seeds, and,
moreover, must now surely be needing a little grain after all those
insects. Again and again he came and peered into his cage, and then,
as the day wore on, all at once he swung round and in. Next day
the dog pushed open the door of the room he was at large in, where¬
upon, having tasted the sweets of liberty, he flew out and upstairs,

where again the room door was open and all the windows. Out he
flew over to the orchard, but he only stayed out an hour or two and
came back to his cage. Did he remember the hemp-seeds ? I am
now getting him a mate, as his marked attentions to the hen of the
other bullies have excited the wrath and jealousy of the cock so that
he bullies his wife, and it will be interesting to see if he transfers his
admiration or prefers single blessedness.
He has a curious little habit, which seems to proceed from a
nervous sort of shyness, of turning his back on one and pretending
to be very much occupied with his own affairs if he thinks he is
wanted to come, say for a hemp-seed or to go to bed, and then
suddenly darting round and taking the hemp, or whisking into his
cage when he thinks you no longer care. The other day he thought
himself aggrieved because he had no more seed left at the end of the
day, and flew into a rage with me, swearing and pecking at my
fingers when I held them up to his cage.
THE WAR.
We do not know how many of our members have, or may be
going, to the front.
Sir Roland Corbet has gone with his regiment, the Coldstream
Guards, and no doubt there may be others whom the Society will
especially think of in this time of trial and suspense. It is calami¬
tous and infamous that not only peace-loving nations should be
forced into a stupendous war, but also that thousands of Germans
who must hate and loathe it should have to be involved, and become
our enemies. The Germans are great bird-lovers ; everywhere in
Germany there are signs of this in the numerous nesting-boxes for
the benefit of the wild birds. Long ago, when aviculture was in its
infancy in England, in Germany many foreign birds had been bred
in captivity, and insectivorous foods had been studied. The vileness
of the plots of the Prussian War Party, with the inflated vanity of
the Kaiser to back it up, is completely outside our experiences of
and dealings with German bird lovers.
The late Herr Carl Hagenbeck was a fine type of a Christian

spirit, a great enthusiast for the wonderful collection of animals and
birds which he made, a man brimming over with kindly courtesy,
gentleness, and hospitality. To Germans like his sons, Herr August
Fockelmann, and many many others whom we trust will, if they
cannot now, eventually know and realize the whole truth of the
scandalous mode of German warfare ; their estrangement from
England (apart from the great loss to their trade), with the appalling
upheaval brought about by their Kaiser and his war-party must
come as a great shock and sorrow.
We look forward to the day when, with these blood-thirsty
and covetous invaders and their leader crushed down forever, we can
once more resume friendly relations and correspondence with our
bird-loving friends and acquaintances, who will we trust no longer be
units of the German Empire, but peaceful citizens of a better and a
smaller country, able to pursue their various studies and trades in
calmer and brighter years.
In the meanwhile one fears that many bird-dealers in England
will inevitably suffer : indeed we have already heard of one with a
wife and six children who through August was unable to sell his
birds unless it were at very low prices, one who is invariably honest
and upright in all his dealings, and to whom the war will, as to
many others, come as a hard task master.
Another result in detail was that a magnificent collection of live
Humming&amp;apos; Birds arrived safely from South America at Havre, im¬
ported by one of our members, when in the great excitement of finding
that there was war between France and Germany, the poor birds were
neglected and all died on board ship, before they could reach Paris,
much to the chagrin of their owner, as well as to all bird lovers who
have heard about it. -

Not long ago Herr August Fockelmann imported in July,
six or seven of the beautiful little Emerald Green Humming Bird
(Sporadinis ricordi ), which Mr. A. Ezra took charge of, as they were
unfit to continue the voyage from London to Hamburg, having been
improperly fed so that all were almost in a dying condition, their
feathers sticky [not blest ! ] with milk and honey. After constant
nursing, not only by day but also by night! Mr. Ezra successfully
brought one of these lovely little things back to health and strength,
it having&amp;apos; been a living skeleton when he received it- I saw it last
month, figuratively falling on my knees to it. When the cage door
is opened, this little “ Hummer ” darts out looking like an emerald
dragon fly, whirring and hovering close to one with complete
fearlessness, and the next moment away across the room to sip
honey from flowers in a vase. Back again close to one’s head, such
a loud Br-r-r from its pointed swift-like wings, up towards the
ceiling, and in another moment by one’s side, it’s throat glittering
like the most vivid emerald. Absolutely a gem, and causing the 10th
Commandment to be broken to smithereens ! Well ! if a tiny thing&amp;apos;
like that can be brought back from the jaws of death, where many
another species looked upon as far more robust would have
succumbed, it gives one just cause to look forward to Humming
Birds being&amp;apos; kept quite easily, so long&amp;apos; as they are imported
properly and can be kept in a temperature not lower than
65 degrees.
What was very amusing to watch in Mr. Ezra’s little
Emerald Humming Bird was it’s evident intelligence, for it would
hum back into its cage and there take up its position on a perch, or
hang in the air with tremulous wings sipping its food (which is the
same given to the Sunbirds). If, however, one approached and showed
that it was the intention to shut the cage-door, it was out like a
flash of lightning&amp;apos;, with absolute steady deliberateness, plainly
saying “ No you don’t,” and still preserving&amp;apos;its calmness of deliberate
movements here and there all over the room, hovering and hum-

CORRESPONDENCE.
BREEDING BUDGERIGARS, &amp;C.
SIR,—It may interest some of your readers to hear that from two
pairs of Budgerigars I have already reared 32 young ones and both have nests now,
one brood already fledged. About March one cock died and I did not get another
for some weeks but the hen nested and much to my astonishment reared a family.
The first brood reared was seven, but I have been unable to count the later ones
as there seemed to be a regular supply of a young bird about every three days or so.
They have all been strong birds except one which had its feathers gnawed as if
by mice, but it lived all right until a cat got it. I cannot keep out the mice but
they don’t seem to disturb the nests.
In the same aviary I have a pair of Madagascar Lovebirds which reared
four young ones. Cutthroats which have reared one and would have reared
many more but for accidents. I think it must be one of the other birds which
throws out their young ones and should like to know which. I suspect Java
Sparrows ; mice never seem to go near the nest and I doubt if they could
get to it.
In the same aviary I have a Rufous-necked Weaver, pair of Pekin Robins,
pair of Java Sparrows, pair of Popes and lately added a Black-cheeked Love¬
bird. The Popes and Robins seemed to wish to nest but were too crowded.
The young Budgerigars, they are all the common green ones, are put into
another aviary when old enough. I find the old ones are very fond of a little
cheese and indeed most of my birds are. They also get bread soaked in sugar
and water, dry bread, cake and the usual seeds and green stuff. One pane of the
sitting room window opens into the aviary so that they can have bits of after¬
noon tea put through. I intend turning a pair of Red-faced and Bluewing
Lovebirds into this aviary soon. It is about 16 ft. long and 6 ft. wide in a snug
corner but short of sun in winter. Ivy, rose and clematis grow up the wall,
but only the ivy is allowed to grow many leaves until it passes through the
wire top, when the rose spreads out and forms a nice shelter.
The wood work was painted red to go with the red sandstone wall but has
gone an ugly purplish colour as usual with iron reds. The other aviary is done
with “ stop rot,” which gives the woodwork a pretty sort of fumed oak look
and is in every way much nicer.
A pair of Bluewing Lovebirds were put in recently by mistake and both got
pecked (the hen to death) before next morning, but probably that was because
they had clipped wings and were new. Birds hate a new bird, with a 11 failing ”
especially, but I am going to put the cock bird back shortly as he can now fly a.
little. The Red-faced Lovebirds will also be put in shortly.
Alfred a. Thom.

Dryonastes ruficollis.
By D. Seth-Smith, F.Z.S.
Amongst the many beautiful and interesting&amp;apos; birds brought home
from India by Major Perreau in the spring of last year (1913) were
several specimens of the handsome Rufous-necked Laughing Thrush
(.Dryonastes ruficollis), of which he most kindly presented four to
the Zoological Society, which proved to be the first of their kind
ever represented in the collection. The others went to private
aviculturists, and it is possible that some of these may have some
interesting notes that they can send our Editor regarding them.
Those at the Zoological Gardens have proved to be hardy, tame and
most attractive birds, and I have no doubt that they would have
made an attempt at breeding if a pair could have been given a suitable
aviary to themselves. But none of the group of Babbling Thrushes
are safe with smaller companions, and so ours had to rough it with
a mixed collection in one of the compartments of the Western
Aviary where I have often seen them picking up sticks and leaves
as if wishing to build. If all goes well we shall try to find them
better accommodation next spring.
Mr. Goodchild’s successful plate gives a very good idea of the
appearance of this fine species and renders any detailed description
unnecessary.
In a wild state D. ruficollis occurs at the lower elevations of
not more than 4,000 feet in the Himalayas. It is said to frequent
thick reedy jungles, constructing its nest in bushes near the ground,
and laying from three to four eggs of a pale bluish green colour.

It may seem strange to our readers, on observing the heading
of these notes, to find themselves suddenly conveyed in thought to
Philadelphia, but as a result of the discovery that, when visiting
Canada, I could also manage a glimpse of the United States without
any extra charge on my ticket, I found myself one evening in the
Delawar Bay and the first thing I observed was a fine Osprey
fishing ; he gave the steamer a wide berth, but I noticed him
make several stoops at fish, which proved unsuccessful, after which
he returned to land.
It was a Sunday night, the 21st July C after the usual troubles
with the Customs) that we landed at Philadelphia. The weather
was warm and summer-like and with high temperatures something
like 95° in the shade ; every one seemed in a hurry and rush as if
life depended on their keeping their watches in their hands. The
town was suffocatingly hot, so I immediately made inquiries and
discovered a place much more suited to my tastes. This was Pair-
view Park, which I reached by trolly car: it was beautifully laid
out in flower beds, and European Sparrows together with immature
bronze Grackles seemed in possession, the latter waddling about on
the grass and staring up with their impertinent little grey eyes in a
most daring way.
Again taking the trolly car which runs round the park I
alighted at a miniature forest called Belmont Glen. It was now
late in the afternoon, a large number of Chimney Swifts iChatura
pelagica ) were circling round the buildings and garden Kiosk, much
as our own birds do in the old world, but these birds are much shorter
in the wing, with hardly any tail and a habit of distending their
primaries, which gives them a ragged appearance ; their wing motions
are quick and their flight bat-like.
I followed the path to Belmont Glen where there was quite
a nice little brook running through a forest of huge trees; by this
time the shades of evening were fast falling, but I saw some birds
moving about with all the appearance of going to roost : a closer
acquaintance proving them to be a hen Virginian Cardinal and some
grown-up young ones.

A little further on a small party of Cat Birds were also in
search of sleeping quarters, making&amp;apos; a ferocious din which at first
had puzzled me not a little. As it was now too dark to see I
reluctantly turned home, determined to renew my exploration the
following morning, which I did, and very lovely it was. The air
so fresh, the sun so bright, the best time in these southern latitudes.
The first thing I heard was the old familiar notes of the Scarlet
Cardinal “whit, whit, whit, chow, chow, chow.” I soon saw a fine
male bird amorously flying&amp;apos; after the hen, but she did not seem the
least attracted, possibly thinking more of her grown-up sons and
daughters than of her husband. I imitated his song&amp;apos; and lie was
furious, alighting in the tree just over my head, looking beautiful,
tail stretched out and crest moving up and down. He was not
going to put up with what he thought was another cock Cardinal,
but I stood my ground although simply charged at. Moving&amp;apos; a little
onwards I heard some bird turning over the leaves, so crept quietly
and beheld a brown Thrasher (Tonostoma rufum) searching for
worms in the true Thrush-like way ; these Mock-Thrushes have a
longer and more hooked bill than the true Turdidce, and are highly
appreciated by Uncle Sam for their song.
Returning to the road I saw another Thrush feeding, which
was either a Wood or Wilson’s, I could not quite make out, possibly
a Wood Thrush, as it was well-marked with spots on the breast.
Wandering along I came across a fresh spring in a dell surrounded
with brambles, and this was simply a bird paradise; all around was
a perfect chorus of Song Sparrows, their notes sweet and melancholy.
A large brown Warbler kept about the spring, Swainson’s Warbler
{Helinaia swainsonii) a good imitation of our Reed Warbler. The
chipping Sparrows were also numerous here, and as I remained
quiet, two birds flew into a tree over my head : brown and about
the size of Mistletoe Thrushes. I could not think what they were,
but on studying&amp;apos; their motions it dawned on me that they were
Cuckoos: on closer inspection I recognised them as the Yellow¬
billed Cuckoo ; most graceful creatures. As they hopped about they
caught the moths that they themselves disturbed.
I returned for supper to the Kiosk, around which there were
boxes of Cannas and Geraniums; whilst refreshing the inner man

Henry B. Rathborne,
to my joy I saw my first humming bird, a male Ruby Throat. It
was like a dream. For a few moments it went round the flowers,
like our well-known Hawk moth of the same name, and then away.
My next experience of this lovely bird was in Canada.
Numerous fowls were kept about this Kiosk. This was a
great attraction for American Crows and Grey Squirrels, so well
known in the London Parks, and flocks of young Cow Birds which
contained parties of twenty or thirty.
In the wood at the back I saw a gorgeous Woodpecker cling¬
ing to some pine trees and quite tame ; the Red-headed Woodpecker
(.Melanerpes erythrocephalus ) bright red, hack black with white bands
across the wings and a snowy white breast.
Robins were scarce here ( Turclus migratorius ) and I did not
meet them in plenty until I visited the Zoological Gardens in Bronx
Park, New York. There they were numerous, hopping over the grass
lawns and feeding in any trees where there were berries. Another
very tame bird was the Flicker, a Woodpecker ( Golaptes auratus).
The first I saw was hopping over the grass, and when I approached it
did not stir. I poked it with the end of the stick before it would
move. The collection of birds in these gardens is about the best I
have ever seen and the North American species well represented.
Very few birds were seen travelling North up the Hudson.
A few belted Kingfishers, Bank Swallows and Sandpipers feeding on
the river banks. Reaching Niagara, birds became more plentiful,
and Belted Kingfishers on the river were numerous. Here I observed
the first American Goldfinch (Astrac/alinus tristis). I had a walk on
Goat Island, densely wooded with vines twisting through the trees
with thick undergrowth. The thermometer stood over 90° Fahr. in
the shade and the atmosphere humid and sultry, except by the
margin of the river’s blue-green torrent where there was a gentle
breeze. Numerous Warblers flitted about through the trees; they
were timid, but I collected some round me by a ruse, imitating the
screech of a caught bird; six gathered round close to my head, so
that I could see them very plainly : four were the Parula Warbler
( Compsotlilypis americana), the other two, American Redstarts
(Setophaga ruticilla). I enjoyed watching their movements and
they remained around me for some considerable time and reminding

me of our genus Philoscopus, only of course they are of very bright
colouring as most of the New World Warblers are. They spend the
winter in the Southern States and migrate northward in April and
May. I spent some time at the Experimental Farm at Ottawa, and
there I found the well-kept lawns quite a paradise for bird life.
Quantities of Robins &amp;lt; Turdus migratorius ) in search of worms ;
Baltimore Orioles feeding on the berries of the Mountain Ash tree, as
well as crowds of other birds such as Cedar Birds, Mock Thrushes,
Flickers, &amp;c.
The Baltimore Oriole feeds in quite a peculiar way, extracting
the juice of the berries with its hill without removing them from
the stalk. They are hard birds to approach and dodge away at the
back of the trees ; the males look gorgeous in their liveries of black
and orange. There is a certain tree at the apiary where at least a
dozen of their pensile nests can be seen ; these are so well con¬
structed that they weather for years the winter storms. Another
beautiful bird that I just got a glimpse of was the Rose-breasted
Grosbeak. This species keeps to the deep solitude of the woods,
the black and white with the rose colour makes a great contrast
against the green of the trees, but once they know they are seen
they mysteriously vanish into the thickets. These birds were at
one time imported into the London market, but have disappeared of
later year since the exportation of birds has been stopped from the
United States.
I noticed the King Bird, plentiful everywhere on posts and
palings and wire fences, flying down to the ground and catching
passing insects. It is quite a graceful bird, but its beautiful golden
crest is not visible except when held in the hand and the feathers of
the head set apart, for instead of a raised crest like most varieties of
birds it is in a hollow on the crown. I have kept its allied species
the Fork-tailed Tyrant (Milvus turanus) in captivity. The bird I
had in my possession was from Trinidad. All these Tyrants are
bullies in an aviary : here I saw them follow in pursuit of Hawks
and Crows or any of the large birds that may intrude into their
domain. I saw one on the plains of Katabazna, Quebec province,
beat a Hawk until I lost sight of it, stooping down upon it making
the Hawk’s feathers fly.

On some Canadian Birds.
Around the suburbs of Ottawa there were some Indigo birds,
a particular pair frequenting&amp;apos; some scrub, the little cock looked so
nice in his bright blue dress beside his slim brown mate. Purple
Finches were along the little creek that flows here, the male is
beautiful and quite a good singer, more purple than the European
Carpodacus, and many are kept in cages here in Canada.
A peculiarly attractive bird of the New World is the Night
Hawk. When first I saw them I mistook them for black Terns ;
they appear quite early in the evenings and at times in the day
during thunder showers: they have a particular fancy for the city
and feed over the chimney pots in company with Swifts.
Whip-Poor-Wills made most uncanny sounds after dark and
were very plentiful on the plains of Katabazna in Northern Quebec.
All these creatures used to collect round the Sheck which was near
a water hole, but their cries usually stopped before midnight.
In August I could observe some signs of return migration to
the South. Cedar Birds appeared in flocks and Purple Martins
lined the telegraph poles ; flocks of Bobolinks passed over with a
swift flight, Eed-winged Blackbirds were in quantities among the
reeds, perhaps the long continued drought shortened their stay in
Northern latitudes.
One day, as I strolled up a lane in Hull, one of the suburbs
of Ottawa, I came across a wooden hut; here, hung up, were many
trap cages with decoy birds, chiefly Goldfinches ( Astragalinus tristis )
and a few Purple Finches, so I enquired within for their owner.
An old lady answered the door, who proved to be the mother of the
bird-catcher, rlio was not within, so I sent for him. After some
time a wild-looking&amp;apos; youth appeared and I at once arranged for a
bird-catching expedition, but in the meantime started him to work.
Two days passed before I again re-visited the place ; on my return I
found he had trapped five Goldfinches, several Purple Finches and a
Bobolink.
We started off with call-birds and trap cages up a hot and
dusty lane, w T ay off&amp;apos; the main road. His traps he set on pailing
posts in a weed-covered common, chiefly thistles in seed and huge
clumps of Solidago, Golden-rod. Many of the weeds in Eastern
Canada are from the old country. One of the trap cages contained

a hen, the other a cock Goldfinch. These little birds are very
beautiful in their black and gold livery ; the male when wild has a
delicate shell pink bill, which I find is lost after moulting in captivity.
The call-birds were soon hard at work attracting one wild bird after
another, which after capture were placed in an extra cage brought
for the purpose. We got about a dozen in all and some Bobolinks
also. I had a special cage made to convey them back with me to
Ireland. Shortly after this I had to leave for home, being recalled
by an urgent wire on account of the labour troubles. The voyage
home was uneventful with the exception of seeing the grand sight of
twenty-two icebergs together at the same time. Our ship was
visited by a female red-breasted Nuthatch ( Sitta canadensis) in the
gulf of St. Lawrence.
Birds of all kinds are plentiful as well as tame both in the
United States and in Canada, (and it is a most enjoyable place for
field study for any ornithologist) from the lively little Chickadee to
the great blue Heron on the silent marsh, with the full feeling of
freedom which in Canada alone we can grasp in its overwhelming
vastness.

Platycerinae .— A large family of AUSTRALASIAN PARRAKEETS
which includes among its representatives many of the most graceful
and beautiful of living birds.
Platycerci (True Broadtail Parrakeets). —Food : Canary,
millet, wheat, oats* a little hemp or sunflower, fruit (especially
apple) and green food. All the true Broadtails can be wintered out
of doors when properly hardened off, but all are sensitive to cold
when newly imported and few can stand, in winter, a damp or
draughty aviary which gets little sun. They will live in cages but
are not really suited to cage life, as their beautiful plumage is very
apt to lose its brilliance after a year or two of close confinement.
As pets, too, they are a failure, having no talent for talking, and being
difficult to tame, and when tamed excitable and treacherous and usually

The Marquis of Tavistock,
destitute of any affection for their owner. During the breeding
season and often at other times, paired birds fight savagely with all
members of their own and allied species, although they may tolerate
the presence of Parrakeets of other orders. Unmated cocks, how¬
ever, agree fairly well together, and it is sometimes possible to pair
two hens to one cock and breed from both at the same time,
provided the hens are on reasonably friendly terms, as is often the case
with a mother and daughter who have never been separated.
During incubation and for some time after the young are hatched,
the hen seldom or never leaves the nest. Hen Broadtails have
smaller heads and narrower beaks than cocks. The young often
breed when a year old, but do not obtain full plumage for eighteen
months.
ROSELLA PARRAKEET (Platycercus exiviius). —The com¬
monest and one of the most beautiful of the family. The adult hen
has the red area on the head and neck smaller than in the cock and
with much more ragged edges and behind the eye the red has a
greyish, washed out, tint. The presence or absence of a green spot
on the nape is not a very useful guide to sex, for while it is probably
true to say that it is never found on an adult cock, it is certainly
absent in the case of many adult hens. Young birds have a narrow
green bar running from the back of the neck to the centre of the
crown and show very little blue on the closed wing. Por turning
out, it is absolutely necessary to get tame, or half-tame adult cocks
-—the tameness of the hens does not matter so much. Newly
imported or young birds are inveterate wanderers when given their
liberty.

country, after which it is as indifferent to cold as any other
Platycercus. It is a satisfactory bird at liberty, wandering less
than many of its allies, and nesting readily either in barrels or
in natural holes in trees. It is very spiteful in disposition, showing
a special aversion to its cousin the Red Rosella and also to the

and has a narrower head.
Blue - cheeked Parrakeet (Platycercus amathusiae ). —
A local variety of the Common or “ Moreton Bay ” Mealy Rosella,
differing from the southern form in the bluer colouring of the cheeks.
Blue-Cheeks often show a few red feathers on the crown of the
head, a peculiarity which sometimes occurs in the ordinary form.

warmth and care until v T ell through the first moult following
importation, but afterwards perfectly hardy. Brown’s Parrakeet is
unfortunately a less good stayer at liberty than the Mealy Rosella,
but it is by no means a hopeless bird to try. Like P. pallidiceps it
has an intense aversion to Bluebonnets and it would be most unwise
to attempt to keep the two species in the same aviary. The cock
Brown’s has a decidedly larger head and heavier beak than the hen.
Among imported birds the proportion of cocks is usually very small
and the number of large, bright-coloured hens, sold as cocks, is
correspondingly great.
Stanley Parrakeet ( Platycercus icterotis). —The smallest
of the Platycerci and a free breeder in captivity. The hen is
readily distinguishable by her dull and patchy tints, the Stanley
being the only typical Broadtail in which the sexes differ markedly
in colour. Stanley’s are not to be recommended for turning out,
as they are bad stayers and are too small to defend themselves
against the attack of Owls
Yellow-rumped Parrakeet (Platycercus flaveolus). —
Formerly quite common, but now rarely imported- The sexes are
much alike and are often very difficult to distinguish. It appears to
stay w^ell at liberty, but I may say that my experience of Y 7 ellow-
rumps has been very limited.
Yellow-bellied Parrakeet (Platycercus flaviventris ).—
Easily distinguishable from the last-mentioned species by its dark
green back. The Yellow-belly is a savage and aggressive bird, the hens
being quite as quarrelsome as the cocks and a great nuisance in
mixed company. They are readily distinguishable by the small size
of their heads and beaks. Yellow-bellies are not very good stayers
when allow-ed their freedom.

The Marquis of Tavistock,
Pennant’s Parrakeet (. Platycercus elegans). —Sexes are&amp;apos;
alike in colour, but hens very readily distinguishable by the small adult
size of the head. Young birds on leaving the nest are a dark leaf
green with a little red on the throat and forehead, blue cheek patches
and some blue in the wings and tail. In securing a pair of Pennants
for turning out make sure that the cock is a steady old show bird
well used to cage life and the ways of the world generally. Newly -
imported, immature or out-door aviary birds, ai’e a vexation of the
spirit as they stay well for many months and then depart on the
approach of the breeding season. When in poor condition, Pennants
are very susceptible to septic fever.
Adelaide Parrakeet (Platycercus adelaidce). — Sexes much
alike, but very red birds are nearly always hens. The young are
decidedly smaller than young Pennants of the same age and of a
more golden olive colour. Adelaides do fairly well at liberty.
Barnardius Parrakeet. —Closely allied to the typical
Platycerci their food and treatment should be the same.
Barnard’s Parrakeet ( Barnarclius barnardi). —A very
beautiful bird and not particularly dangerous in mixed company.
Beak of the hen much smaller than that of the cock and her colours,
usually, though not invariably, duller and showing less blue. Barnard’s
do well at liberty but the young are apt to stray to great distances
from their birth place and eventually fail to return.

</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997273" page_id="32669936"  page_num="356" year="" vol="">
specimens have the lower breast almost entirely yellow and have no
red on the forehead. The hens are easily distinguished by the
small size of their head and beak. Bauer’s are most dangerous
neighbours for other quarrelsome Parrakeets likely to fight with
them and even at liberty will often inflict fatal injuries by biting
deeply into the upper mandible of an adversary and sometimes
tearing it completely off. Half-tame birds are best for turning out.
Yellow-Collared or Port Lincoln Parrakeet
(Barnardius semitorquatus). —Typical examples have the lower breast
pale green and some red feathers at the base of the upper mandible,
but intermediate forms between this species and P. zonarius are
very common and are of no fixed type. The hen Port Lincoln is
less easy to tell from the cock than the hen Bauer and the sexes-

are alike in colour. Port Lincoln’s stay fairly well at liberty and
their loud whistling calls, unpleasantly noisy in a room, are most
beautiful when heard at a little distance in the open air. Un¬
fortunately B. semitorquatus is a murderous fighter and just as
expert as the Bauer in inflicting beak injuries.
Pileated oe Red-capped Paeeakeet (Porphyromphalus
spurius ). — This curious, aberrant Platycercine is, in spite of the fact
that it is lively, striking in appearance and amiable in disposition,
liable to bring its owner more anxiety and disappointment than
satisfaction. Of all Parrakeets it is the most intensely nervous, and
catching and handling&amp;apos; it in the most gentle manner will often reduce
it to such a state of prostration through sheer terror, that its life
may be seriously endangered. It also possesses in captivity an
absolute unrivalled capacity for catching fatal chills on the smallest
provocation. It is therefore a wise precaution to remove it from the
aviary in autumn and keep it in a roomy cage in a warm room until
spring is well advanced when it may be very cautiously hardened off.
At the same time Pileateds are under certain circumstances capable
of withstanding cold, as is proved by the fact that I had a fine cock
at liberty during the greater part of the winter of 1912 which kept in
perfect health. Unfortunately in February he strayed in search of
a mate, lost his way and quickly starved. Pileated Parrakeets would
probably do well at liberty as they are very dependent on artificial
feeding, but the process of cutting their wings is so likely to prove
fatal that one hesitates to try it with such valuable birds.
Porphyroceplialus spurius is one of the very few Australian Parra¬
keets which will eat banana with any relish.
Psephotus Paeeakeet. — A family of rather small
Parrakeets of extreme grace and beauty, which spend a good deal of
their time on the ground. The sexes usually present a striking
difference in colour. The food should be the same as that provided
for the Platycerci and green stuff is most important. When tame
they make gentle and affectionate pets.
Redeump Paeeakeet ( Psepliotus Jicematonotus). —The best
known member of the family. Very hardy when properly acclima¬
tized but not at other times, Redrumps would be charming birds at
liberty were it not for the fact that owing to their small size they

The Marquis of Tavistock,
almost invariably fall victims to Owls before they have time to
establish themselves. They stay remarkably well when released in
pairs, but directly a cock or hen is lost its mate will invariably g&amp;apos;o
clean away within two or three days if a substitute is not provided.
Redrumps are very dependent on artificial feeding and unlike many
of the true Platycerci starve directly their supply of seed is beyond
their reach. They may either be turned out with cut wings or if a
pair in breeding condition are obtained, the cock may he released
full-winged and his mate (who must be kept within sight and hearing)
allowed to join him after a few days. Adult Redrumps fight savagely
with members of their own and nearly allied species. They are
highly susceptible to septic fever.
Many-coloured Parrakeet (. Psephotus multicolor). Like
the Redrump, able to stand cold when properly hardened off. Old
writers describe this bird as a hopeless one to keep on account of
its liability to die suddenly and without apparent reason from
cerebral haemorrhage. There is no doubt that Many-colours do
sometimes succumb to this ailment on very insufficient provocation,
but they certainly do not do so to such an extent that anyone need
be deterred from trying them. They are however given to developing
septic fever in the most inexplicable fashion and the greatest care
must be taken to safeguard them from possible infection. Like
Redrumps they are very quarrelsome.
Hooded Parrakeet (. Psepliotus cucullatus). — This beau¬
tiful bird has been described as very sensitive to cold, but I have
found that, provided it is well protected from draughts and cold
winds, it is by no means impossible to winter it without artificial
heat. It is, however, fatal to allow it to nest at a low temperature
as the hens are very subject to egg-binding and many are lost from
this cause. On leaving the nest the young of both sexes resemble
the female in their sober coloration, though the young cocks always
show a trace more blue on the cheeks and breast. Adult plumage is
assumed during the course of the first moult when the birds are
about ten months old. Hooded Parrakeets are not quite so
susceptible to septic fever as are their near relatives. Psephotus
chrysopterygius, the Golden-shouldered Parrakeet, described by Gould,
appears to differ from the Hooded in the presence in the adult male

very aberrant Psephotiis which really deserves to be placed in a
genus of its own. Why this bird should be classed with species to
which it has a very remote affinity, and that most typical Polytelis
the Queen Alexandra Parrakeet separated from its two near relatives
for the very insufficient reason that the adult cock possesses one
primary feather somewhat peculiarly shaped at the tip, is one
of the mysteries of scientific classification which are most difficult
to account for. Cock and hen Blue-bonnets are alike in colour, but
the latter have rather smaller heads and are less perky and assertive
in their demeanour. Blue-bonnets are the hardiest of all Australian
Parrakeets and can safely be turned out of doors at any time of
year. They are, however, highly susceptible to septic fever and
grey parrot fever, the germs of which they cannot resist even when
in the most perfect health and condition. In disposition they are
excessively spiteful both towards parrakeets and birds of other
orders. When tame they make nice pets but usually bestow their
affections on one person only. When given their liberty they are
apt to stray during the first few weeks, but after that they generally
stay well. They seldom fall victims to owls and are able to live
for many days even during the winter on what they pick up for
themselves in the woods and fields. Blue-bonnets should be fed
like the other Psephoti, but it is not wise to allow them much hemp
unless they are flying at large.
Bed-vented Blue-bonnet (Psephotus hcematorrhous ).—
Differs from the common variety in the possession of red feathers
under the tail and a reddish chestnut or maroon patch on the wings.
Both kinds have a red patch on the abdomen. P. hcematorrhous
has little claim to be considered anything but a local variety of the
common Blue-bonnet, and birds showing intermediate characteristics
are often met with.
Neophemas Parrakeet. —These beautiful little grass parra¬
keets are now rarely imported and it appears only too likely that
some of the most lovely species are nearly or quite extinct. They
should be fed on white and spray millet, grass seed and canary seed.&amp;apos;

Some Hints on Parrot-Keeping.
A few of the larger seeds will do no harm, but they seldom seem to
care for them. Grass-parrakeets are very peaceable with other birds,
but are rather more sensitive to cold than the platycerci.
Elegant Grass Pareakeet ( Neophema elegans). — The
largest of the group, like all its relatives, highly susceptible to
septic fever. It is very fond of grass and other green food. The
hen has less blue on the forehead than her mate.
Blue-winged Grass-parrakeet ( Neophema venusta ), also
called ‘ Blue-banded Grass-parrakeet.’ Very like the Elegant
but of a duller, darker and less golden green and with more blue on
the wing. The hen has much less blue on her forehead than the
cock—often only the merest trace—and young birds are less blue on
the wing than old ones. Gould asserts that in N. elegans the blue
frontal band extends behind the eye and in N. venusta it does not,
but the distinction only applies to adult cocks, as I have seen no hen
elegans in which the frontal band did not stop on reaching the eye.
Turquoisine Grass-parrakeet (Neophema pulchella). —A
very distinct species in which the markings are different from those
of its commoner green relatives. The cock is readily distinguishable
from the hen by the possession of a small chestnut patch on the
wings. The Turquoisine appears to be on the verge of extinction,
a lamentable circumstance for which aviculturalists both in England
and on the Continent are much to blame, as the bird was at one
time freely imported and bred so readily in captivity that it might
easily have been preserved in a state of semi-domestication.
BOURKE’S Parrakeet ( Neophema bourkei). —A fairly hardy
little bird, rather less subject to septic fever than others of the genus.
Some adult cocks have a broad blue band across the forehead, but in
others this is nearly or entirely absent, and the sexes may be most diffi¬
cult to distinguish as they are of exactly the same size. Bourkes,
especially when young, are very apt to dash themselves violently
against the sides of their aviary in moments of sudden panic and all
glass and wire netting affording facilities for this method of suicide
should be protected by string netting or sacking. Bourkes are not
so fond of green food as their near relatives and a constant supply
is not necessary when they are not breeding. Nesting pairs are
best kept separate as I have had birds killed through fighting.

New Zealand PARRAKEET {Gyanorhampus novce-zealandice).
A gentle and beautiful bird, now hardly ever imported. It should
be treated like an ordinary Broadtail, but should not be exposed
to too much cold.
Pyrrhulopsis Parrakeets. —A small genus of large,
brilliant Parrakeets, all of which are rare in captivity. They should
be fed and treated like the Aprosmicti and a large supply of fruit is
indispensable to their health. The sexes are much alike in colour.
The Masked, Tabuan, and shining Parrakeets are the best known if
not the only members of the genus, the two latter being much alike,
but while the Tabuan Parrakeet has a maroon head and breast, in
the Eed-shining Parrakeet the maroon is replaced by bright crimson.
THE GREAT-BILLED TOURACO.
By Graham Renshaw, M.D., F.R.S.E.
It is unfortunate that the handsome birds known as Touracos
or Plantain-eaters are but little known to aviculture : for, although
somewhat delicate in confinement, their curious ways and quaint
yet lovely plumage render them eminently desirable as pets. Im¬
ported at long and irregular intervals, the total number arriving
in a year can be reckoned on the fingers of one hand : even the
commonest are rarities, though several species have been shown
from time to time at the Zoo.
The writer has in his possession a Great-billed Touraco
(Turacus macrorhynchus). This fine species has the head, throat
and chest dark shining green, the wings are crimson, mantle and
tail violet. The stout beak is yellow anteriorly, but the upper
mandible has a crimson spot immediately in front of the nostril,
and the posterior two-thirds of the lower mandible are almost
entirely crimson. The feathers of the head are produced into a
crest, and this is faintly tipped with white, as if a paint-brush
had been lightly passed along it: a smart white streak also runs
below and behind the eye. The eyelids are bright crimson, the
legs and feet black. This charming and harmonious colour-pattern
is well adapted to conceal an arboreal, forest-haunting bird such as

Mr. A. R. Williams,
the present; it is further remarkable that these hues also occur in
the flower, fruit and leaves of the bananas on which it feeds!
The writer’s Touraco lives in an unheated aviary with a
spacious outdoor flight. For companions it has a Tucai Toucan
(Bhamphastos dicolorus), three Cape Mouse-birds (Colitis striatus}
and a Delalande’s Fruit Pigeon (Vinago delalandei ). It agrees well
with all of them, though at meal times the Toucan’s big beak
ensures the respect of the others, The Touraco is fed on cut-up
apples and bananas, and does not appear to care for mealworms,
which these birds are said to take in captivity. On coming to the
ground to feed, the Touraco utters a short croak and runs smartly
to the food-pan. The stout beak acts like a pair of pincers, gouging
out pieces of banana pulp and swallowing them whole: pieces of
apple also swiftly disappear down the wide, distensible throat.
The upper beak is but loosely articulated to the skull, and can be
moved up and down with a hinge-like action, thus permitting the
passage of morsels which would choke many birds.
Touracos are adepts at hiding, keeping concealed behind
objects (such as posts or boughs) which would have been thought
much too slender for the purpose. When alarmed the bird stretches
out its head and neck, at the same time elevating its crest. The
writer’s specimen is most active in the morning and evening, spend¬
ing the middle of the day in sleep. Besides the croaking sound
already mentioned, Touracos utter harking cries, and also a curious
sound like the winding of a clock, hence the name “clock bird”&amp;apos;
often applied to them.

The West or Herefordshire side of the Malvern Hills is more

more varied, better wooded, and undulates slightly, with small
ranges of hills, giving the interest of variety to the landscape.
Standing on a tree-clad ridge some three or four miles west¬

Hill ancl the Beacon. Sweeping&amp;apos; along the line, the eyes perceive
gorse and fern clad slopes, with houses dotted about in places.
Straight in front the top of one hill is covered with pine trees,
whilst lower down is a considerable wood of mixed trees, through
which the high road runs. A few cottages and some large white
houses border the road at intervals, and occasionally vehicles pass
along. To the right, southward, looms the British Camp, square
and angular and entrenched, a grim relic of the days when our
ancestors alternated war with the chase, sometimes for pleasure,
often as a vital necessity of life, to prevent slaughter or enslavement.
From there a number of small hills slope down, through one of
of which, Dog Hill, the railway runs to Ledbury.
About there a huge obelisk stands ever-visible, a monument
to some past Lord Somers.
It is a peaceful scene. The only disturbances it gets are when
a train rushes with roar and rattle between the Malvern and Ledbury
tunnels, and, in autumn and winter, the wild career of hunters and
hounds in pursuit of a fox. For the rest it is quiet enough. The
ill-paid labourer pursues his useful work unobtrusively, and the
great white-faced “ Herefuds ” stand contentedly grazing, or stare
at the passer-by with large, soft, fearless eyes.
About half-a-mile below us stands a church, a gray building
with a square ivy-clad tower, typical of so many in this country.
A few sombre yews and tall elms stand round it. This is the resort
of the rooks. In the elms they have their loosely-built nests, and
at all seasons they wheel round the tower, or perch flapping on its
summit.
In the tower itself a number of jackdaws have taken up
their abode, and can be seen popping in and out through numerous
holes at the top of the tower. In the Spring the noise of the rooks
can be heard for miles. Now in October they are quieter. They
have not the weighty matters of nesting and rearing young to call
forth “ caws,” and food is so plentiful, in the shape of acorns and
refuse from harvest, that they are at peace with themselves and the
world.
The rook is an omnivorous feeder. He is a destroyer of
pests as well as a partaker in what man has grown, ranging over the

Mr. A. B. Williams,
animal and vegetable kingdom for his food. Of slugs, grubs, worms,
and other creatures of the earth he eats an enormous quantity, as
he does also of acorns.
Coming up a bank suddenly to a sloping field, we disturbed a
rook. He flew up with a rush, bearing something between his claws.
In his haste he had not secured his prize, and it dropped. I went
and picked it up. It was a big potato. In it there were two or
three holes pecked and claw marks. My companion, a local country¬
man, informs me that rooks are very partial to potatoes.
Talking of acorns brings us to the subject of wild pigeons,.
“ quiests ” or “ quises ” as they are called about here.
The pigeon is the farmer’s bete noir • The pigeon has no word
said in its favour. It takes toll of everything vegetable, prefers
crops and leaves pests strictly alone. So it is shot whenever
possible, but flourishes nevertheless, and seems to be increasing,
although it is exempted from the Wild Birds’ Protection Acts, as is
also the sparrow.
“Quiests” eat large quantities of grain, peas, and beans.
They have a still more culpable weakness. It is for young clover.
They bite it off close to the ground, often so closely as to prevent
further growth. In fact, they will eat anything green and tender,
and any kind of seeds. Their voracity for acorns is astonishing-
My friend assures me that he has taken as many as nineteen acorns j
from the crop of one pigeon.
This part of the country is a perfect birds’ paradise. The
prevalence of large farms, the fertility of the soil, the abundance of
woodland, covert, and hedge row, and the sparsity of population, all
favour birds, and they take full advantage of these opportunities.
Man, as farmer, curses many of the birds, and tries to reduce
their numbers, but with little success. The two he hates most, the j
sparrow and the wild pigeon, are the commonest, and their numbers j
seem to increase.
Pigeons have some peculiar habits. They are very fond of
larch trees, and will spend hours in them, perched cooing and preen¬
ing, hut never build there. The nests are usually in woodland trees,
beech being shown a preference.
The sparrows are ubiquitous. They swarm everywhere, and

shooting&amp;apos;, trapping, and even nest and egg destroying fail to make
any appreciable reduction in their flocks.
Game-keeping has made considerable difference to the inci¬
dence of birds, as it has done in the case of animals, just as in the
same way trout and salmon preserving has affected the other fish
and the riverside creatures. A visit to a gamekeeper’s “gallows”
will testify to this—a gruesome row of birds and beasts shot or
trapped and nailed to a post as common malefactors. Jays have
been much reduced this way. The jay is inordinately fond of eggs,
especially pheasant and partridge egg&amp;apos;s. So the gamekeeper fixes up
a pole in or near the wood, places a small platform on top, and
secures there a steel trap. This is baited with an empty egg shell.
The jay swoops down and pecks hard at it, thus losing his life in the
trap. In some parts jays are getting comparatively scarce. The
magpie is a much persecuted bird, being&amp;apos; shot as it flies out from the
hedge or copse. But it is still fairly common, and may often be
seen taking its low undulating flight over the meadows. This bird
is remarkable for its long tail, and the use it makes of it while flying,
raising&amp;apos; and depressing it as a sort of plane, the result being a rising
and falling, switch-back sort of progression.
The large birds are the chief sufferers in modern England.
Some have been quite exterminated, though many would return and
the present species increase numerically were they but given some
encouragement and protection.
But most of the common small birds have multiplied greatly,
thereby occasioning much grumbling from those on whose ground
they feed, particularly fruit-farmers.
There is no bird for which the fruit-grower has a word of
praise : the most credit he will give to the best-intentioned bird is a
grunt of disdain or uncertainty. Considering the varieties of birds
which feed on insects and creeping things, most of which are a
menace to the cultivator, a strong case can be made out for the
birds, and a little bud and fruit-eating might be forgiven them.
This increase of the common birds is rather curious and its
causes not quite definitely assigned. They are mostly small birds,
This form of trap is illegal, and extreme!}&amp;apos; cruel.—E d.

Mr. A. R. Williams,
to whom improvement of cultivation is no bar, but rather encourage¬
ment, for it simplifies feeding. The destruction of birds of prey may
be a contributory cause. Hawks are becoming rare in this part of
England. A kestrel is sometimes seen, but not often. The sparrow-
hawk and kestrel used to destroy numbers of small birds, as well as
small animals and vermin. Now their deterrent influence is not felt.
Above us was a small wooded hill. The farmer informed me
that it was a few years ago frequented by a kestrel. It used to soar
to a great height from the far side of the wood, hover, and take
short flights, darting down with lightning rapidity on to its prey.
But it disappeared; shot no doubt.
Owls are plentiful, both the barn or screech-owl, and the
brown wood-owl, with its “tu-whit, tu-whoo,” curiously resembling
at a distance a forlorn human voice.
Flocks of wild geese sometimes pass over in autumn. This
is said to portend a severe winter, as is also a plentitude of berries.
Both statements lack proof, there being no reliable data to support
either belief.
We moved up towards the house. Below us lay a large pond,
overhung with elms, alders and water-loving&amp;apos; bushes. It was rapidly
filling with the Canadian pond-weed, and has to be raked at intervals
or it would be completely choked up. A number of gold-fish were
swimming about. These fish attain an amazing size in a large pond.
Some of them were well over a foot long.
Trout were kept here at one time, and then a heron used to
visit the pond. It was often seen leaving at daybreak. But the
heron does not confine itself to fish : it eats frogs and any aquatic
creatures obtainable. Herons are now protected by many country
gentry, who take great pride in possessing a “ heronry,” and so these
interesting birds are increasing.
In ten years the owner had seen only one kingfisher here,
and then only on one occasion. They are shy birds and somewhat
localised. On parts of the Severn one can often see them, and a
little patience is rewarded by seeing the bird dive, or rather dip and
catch, after which it perches and works the fish along through its
beak. Why is this ? Is it to kill the fish or break its bones or to
soften it for the young ?

A few water-hens, mis-called moor-hens, were paddling about,
hut rapidly disappeared under cover at our approach.
Woodpeckers are common, and their quick rhythmical tap
may often be heard.
If disturbed, partridges flap noisily away from where they
have been squatting in the long grass. A pheasant, when suddenly
startled, will often rocket with tremendous force straight up and
through the tree-tops.
Away in a large distant meadow countless black specks were
bobbing busily up and down.
Look at those Starlings worming,” remarked my cicerone.
A wagoner&amp;apos;s boy passing along the road shouted “ Shoo.” Instantly
the whole flock rose in a cloud and flew to the tops of the elms close
to us. There must have been thousands of them. Not one was
still or quiet for a moment. The whole lot were on the move
incessantly, hopping from bough to bough, bobbing and bending and
turning and flapping unendingly, with quick jerky movements.
Their noise was deafening. Each starling kept up a sibilant,
half-whistling call, a sort of catch or round on two or three ascending
notes. After watching and listening for a few minutes, we clapped
our hands and shouted, and the flock went off at top speed to
another field. They continue like that all through the winter,
pairing off finally about February or March.
The Starling always builds in a hole, or anything that the
least resembles one, making a rough untidy nest, and has a prefer¬
ence for straw.
At the back of the house is an old brick-built shed, used as a
store by the carpenter. In one gable-end is an opening, two feet
square, through which the carpenter pushed his ladders. About
two years ago this shed was disused and the door was locked all
through the winter. One day, about the beginning of April, the
carpenter went in to have a look round to see if the place could be
used again. He had cleared everything out. Inside, at the bottom
of the wall, below the ladder opening, he found a big heap of straw,
nearly a barrowful. He could not understand how it came there.
A careful watch revealed two starlings at work. They carried
straws from the pig-styes and laid them on the lower ledge of the

opening. Before they got much there it was blown inside by the
wind. But the starlings persisted, and the result was the heap of
straw, all of which had been carried by this pair of birds. The
carpenter using the shed again put an end to the birds visits, or it
would be interesting to know how long they would have kept on in
this way.
The Pied Wagtail is a resident about here, but the yellow
wagtail is scarce, only being seen occasionally.
The early-setting sun was now low in the west. The robin
had ceased his little bursts of autumn melody. The call of birds
were lessening. The starlings flew off with a great rush to the
woods to roost. Bound the church-yard elms the rooks were gather¬
ing and giving a final chorus of “caw” before retiring. The small
fowl were all seeking their resting-places for the night. From the
low-lying meadows came the faint “ pee-wit ” of the plover, an eerie
sound through the oncoming darkness.
A slight mist began to rise from the country, and a fading
pearly-gray light disappeared from the hills, as the lights began to
twinkle from the houses.
Then the faint silvery yellow of the crescent moon peeped
above the hills, and the stars crept out, whilst all the country-side
was hushed to silence.

THE SMALL AND MOBE DELICATE SOFTBILLS.
At the present time I have sixty-five species of native birds
in my aviaries. Amongst them is the Crested Shrike Tit (. Fulcuncu -
lus frontatus ) my favourite bird. In appearance it is a little like
the Coal Tit of Europe, only much brighter and twice the size,
with a fine black comb-like crest. Strange to say, contrary to other
birds so ornamented, it raises the crest when excited, hut when in
the act of fighting it lowers it fiat on to its head and stretches the

body, generally bulky, into a straight and slender line. In that
posture the bird is a lovely sight. The call note is a sweet plaintive
whistle, whereas the young, even when three months old and more,
attract one’s attention by their peculiar quacking noise, just like iittle
ducklings. They lly and feed high and with their powerful beaks
rip the bark off the trees to find cocoons and small beetles. Their
nest is a lovely little structure built in trees up to a height of 50
to 100 feet high, fastened on the outer edge of a branch of a
gum tree. Some years ago I was offered and bought a pair for
thirty shillings, but the pleasure was a short lived one. Now,
however, I have a few doing well, very tame and ready to come
on to my finger whenever I call them. Next to them in my affection
come the White-shouldered Caterpillar Eater (Lalage tricolor). A
real regal bird : brown hind neck, upper back shining metallic blue,
shoulders white, likewise underside and band across wings. But
its beauty lies in the lovely shape. Compared to other birds this
bird is what a race-horse is to a draught-horse. They are at home
in large paddocks with a few big trees, singing even when sitting on
the nest. As soon as incubation is over the male bird takes little
further notice of its offspring. I have noticed this seeming neglect
to their families in numbers of breeding birds, but catching one day
the mother from three young already well on the wing I was sur¬
prised to see later on the father take charge of and lead the young
about. In June the cock changes to grey, the colour of the female.
Their nests are high up and difficult of access. Very shy at large ;
in captivity they soon become delightfully tame : they are birds I
am never without.
The Bobin species ( Petroica ): Scarlet, Flame-breast, Bose-
breast, Bed-capped, Yellow and Hooded Bobins are one and all the
most gorgeous birds we have, especially the four first named ones.
Formerly they must have been very plentiful here, but what with
rabbit poison, catapults, air and pea rifle, they are now very scarce,
especially near the populated centres, where every boy—defender
of the country—must kill something, and the shining red breast of
the robins make a fine target. They are not hard to catch as one of
their characteristics is their guilelessness. No bird will come so
easily into a trap or on to a limestick as these robins: but the

Mr. G. A. Heumann ;
keeping of them is a different matter and few birds will want such
care and attention as these. Another drawback is that they will
lose colour after moulting, though I have had them to go through it
and come out as bright as the best of them in nature. The loveliest
amongst them is no doubt the Rosebreast, and the species from the
north of N.S.W. is the brightest : chest a deep rose pink, the rest a
pearly silver grey. A glorious little bird. The few I have had of
them have given me untold pleasure.
The Red-capped comes next. It is the smallest of the robin
tribe and oh so delicate, but most lovely ! Crown of head scarlet
also breast, abdomen white, rest black with white bar across the
wings. The hen is greyish brown with a maroon patch on the top
of the head, the young are like her. They like flat brush country,
Tee tree or other low scrub; like all robins they only live in pairs or
singles! It takes a long time to locate a pair of this species. The
Scarlet-breasted Robin is I think the brightest, the most gorgeous of
them, being larger and therefore showing more red. To see them sit
on a sunny morning on stumps out in the open flat, they remind one
of soldier sentinels in their black uniform, the shining red breast¬
plate and the white patch on the forehead for a helmet. His relation,
the Flame-breast, is dark silver grey with a light brick reddish-pink
chest and abdomen. To see these birds in their native state is
worth a trip to Australia. They are just too lovely for words. I
am sure if they could be got to England they would do well out
in the open, since they are cold climate birds, as it were, coming
during the colder months only and returning towards the snowy
mountains during the hot summer months. During&amp;apos; cold winters I
have fed them personally in the Blue Mountains when snow was
on the ground with crumbs which they took greedily. Yet try them
that way in captivity and they will surely die the first day.
The Black and White or Hooded Robins are the largest of
the Robin tribe in N.S.W. They are very handsome birds, similar
to the White-shouldered Caterpillar eater, but they remained always
wild with me and I cannot say that they are amongst my favourite
birds. Robins of any kind, in spite of their gorgeous plumage, even
in their wild state, do not impress me as being so buoyant in spirit
as some birds. Their feathers are never as sleek and trim as those

of other Softbills. They have a discontented look about them and
are certainly anything but amiable in the aviary. They often build
their nest close to human habitation, and several I have found under
the thatch roof over corn-stacks.
Close to Sydney only the Yellow Robin is met with, generally
called “ Yellow Bob,” a plain grey bird with light sulphur-yellow
breast. His relation up north is larger and of an intense yellow,
a bird one looks at twice. Robins breed easy enough in confinement,
but the rearing of the young is I think still a problem not yet solved.
Rufous Crested and Yellow Thickheads ( Pachycephala) are not only
handsome birds but also exceedingly fine whistlers. Unfortunately
they are still in the experimental stage with me and so far I am
sorry to say I have not been able to keep them longer than a year
at a stretch. To listen to these birds early in the morning gladdens
the heart of any bird-lover. A plain but attractive bird and one I
like to always have round me is the Willy Wagtail ( Motacilloides ) :
head, throat and breast black, eyebrows and under white and fan¬
like tail. They love sitting on the cattles’ backs catching flies,
always wagging their tail and once in a way letting out their melo¬
dious song which sounds like “ sweet pretty creature.” During
moonlight nights they are often a real nuisance, whistling all night
long. They breed every year in my orchard and I have often taken
the young. They thrive in captivity. A close relation of theirs is
the so-called Scissor Grinder or Frog bird : so-called on account of
their peculiar grinding noise, when, as is their habit, they hover like
a Hawk in the air before swooping down to get the insect they have
been searching for. A slender and very graceful bird, much tighter
in feather than the Wagtail, and more handsome. The white on
the breast comes right up to the base of the bill, the rest is a bluish
green-black. Some years ago I sent to England a dozen or so of
three kinds of Wood Swallows, lovely birds all of them. The
White-eye-browed one (Artamus ) light slate grey and maroon breast
and a white brow, the “dusky ” dark grey with black markings on
edge of tail and wing and the “mask” dark grey, half the head
black, mask-like, tail tipped white. All of them birds I would not
care to be without. They are easily kept on bread and milk, and
readily feed and rear their young with this diet. They are very

Mr. G. A. Heumann,
hardy and live for many years in the aviary, always being first to
fly on one’s hand or shoulders when entering the flight. I had
hoped to make some exchanges with them, but the man who took
them told me on his return that he could not exchange or sell them
in England and got rid of them only on the return voyage in Italy.
Needless to say I have not made another such experiment.
The Wren (Malums) species are of course every one’s favourites
because every one knows them. To see them hop through the low
bushes with their long tails carried almost straight, or to notice the
cock bird in his blue and black costume sitting on the top of a rail
or branch calling and singing to his flock is certainly a fine picture.
They are always travelling in families with one coloured out cock
bird to lead them ; the Blue Wren is the most common and found
almost everywhere around Sydney. There is an impression that
because they have been landed once in a way in England they are
hardy birds and easy to keep. This is a fallacy. Generally speak¬
ing they are as soft as Robins, but during the winter months will
take more readily to food. Once, however, they are used to the new
surroundings and food they live well and breed easily, they will then
feed their young on almost anything soft. They seldom get a meal¬
worm from us and yet the young thrive quite well on cake, bread
and milk, mixed food with plenty of ants’ eggs, raw minced beef,
flies, &amp;c. Of course in our aviaries they catch a lot of flying insects
which naturally help to prolong their lives. During certain times in
the year they lose their bright plumage, generally between April and
July, but in captivity they often never change. A good Blue Wren
is a fine little bird, but a Lambert Wren with its chestnut-coloured
back and wings and its royal purple face and saddle is even more
brilliant. This bird wants to be seen by artificial light, it shows off
the colours magnificently. The Lamberts are much rarer, in fact
very scarce birds and inhabit mountainous slopes. I once watched
a nest of them with two young and to my surprise I noticed two
coloured cock birds and only one hen feeding the babies. Up
north, on the Brunswick and Tweed river, I get my Scarlet-backed
Wrens. These like marshy country and they take some finding,
though fairly abundant. Driving along the road towards dusk I used
to watch for them going to their roosting place, generally a thick

thorny bush of the Acacia species, called by the children “cock-
spurs ” Here the old cock bird would sit on the highest branch,
singing his song of love and delight, perhaps to call to straggling
members of his family to come home. If you discover their roost¬
ing place it is then no trouble to catch father, mother and their
feathery children. A remarkable observation I made on several
occasions with this species is that the wrens love to resort to clear¬
ings where the scrub has been felled and lies to be burnt off. I have
seen the Blues, Lamberts and Beds all mixed up in one Hock of say
two-three dozen and watched them through the glass for some time.
Going near them, they immediately separated into their respective
families. The Blues remained in the low bushes near, the Lamberts
fled up the hill and the Bed-backed ones towards the creek. All
wrens build low into the long grass or low bushes and a great
number of young are thereby destroyed by ants alone. I may
perhaps some later day relate some of the tragedies in bird-life
through ants and other causes which I witnessed in the bush.
Another lovely Wren—though not so gorgeous — is the Emu
Wren, with its scraggy tail like “Ospreys” sticking up (and also
the Striated Wren &gt; but both these species I only kept for a short
time, as they are very hard to get and then very hard to keep
going. A bird resembling the Pied Wagtail of the Continent is
the White-fronted Chat ( Epethianura) commonly called “ Binglet,”
.a great favourite of mine, almost like a double-barred finch, only
with one bar only and the creamy white of the finch replaced by
pure milk white. Their walk is so graceful and dainty that I placed
them among the elite in my aviaries. They inhabit the swampy
places about Sydney and respond readily to artificial feeding,
whereas the Orange-fronted Chat from the West I never succeeded
in bringing alive as far as Sydney. I have never seen the European
Bee-eaters, but I should say by their description that there is little
difference from ours ( Merops omatus ). Taking a boat at Penrith,
about 40 miles from Sydney, at the foot of the Blue Mountains and
rowing down the Nepean river, one sees these lovely birds sitting
high up an overhanging branch. Once in a way, when an insect
appears and is seen, they will swoop down and catch it, returning
with a graceful glide to the place they vacated, seldom will they fly

Mr. G. A. Heumann,
elsewhere. They are lazy, uninteresting birds, in spite of their
lovely plumage and graceful flight. Old birds I have never been
able to get on to artificial food, probably on account of being too
used to catch their food on the wing. They absolutely refuse to pick
up from the ground and only stuffing will save them for a little time,
but it is useless. With the young taken from the nest I have been
much more successful. As is well known, they build in the
banks of the river, burrowing holes about two to three feet deep
and about four to five inches in diameter. I must admit that,
though not afraid of snakes when I see them, having kept them as
pets before my marriage and only giving them up in deference to
my wife’s wishes, I yet have an uncanny feeling creeping through
me when I put my hand into one of these doubtful holes. The
nest is kept very dirty and wings of butterflies and beetles are there
in thousands, blowfly maggots are all over the nest and I often
wondered if the young birds live on them before emerging from the
nest. It is not difficult to get these young birds to eat. I use fine
raw beef, covered with crushed flies ( to give the coating to the
pellets they eject) and a few mealworms per day. These birds
reared by hand become very tame, mine would fly away and return
regularly to a whistle they learnt and remembered. The migrating
season alters all these pleasant relations and one day they do not
respond to the whistle; they have gone away ! I tried to find out
why they would eat bees in some districts and not in others, but so
far I have not discovered any satisfactory solution. Also it is said
■ — I saw it too in a German bird-paper—that Bee-eaters do not
drink. I admit that I never took notice of this as I took it for
granted that they do drink, and being birds that live near water they
always have a plentiful supply. I have none of these birds at
present, but on my return from the Continent shall get them again
and then settle that question.
Flycatchers, Cuckoos and Pardalotes I have tried and am
still experimenting with, but so far they have but lived a short while
with me, especially the Pardalotes or “ Ground Diamonds ” as the
boys call them. Sweet little birds, worth all the trouble to try and
keep them alive. It is amusing to read some of the answers given
to inquiries as how to keep Bee-eaters, Pardalotes, &amp;c. Well, I

■suppose one expects too much at times of scientists or theorists, as
it were ; but for their own sakes it would be as well for them to
acknowledge at times when in a fog “I don’t know myself.”
Other birds I have kept are the twelve Apostles, so-called on
account of generally flying, jumping, and running along the ground
in a dozen or so. They are a dull, brown-black bird and are very
plentiful out west. When picnicing&amp;apos; they will come quite close to
eat the crumbs. In the aviary they are butchers. The same applies
to the Grey-crowned Babbler ( Pomatorhinus) or Happy Family.
Rather a pretty bird and very companionable to the traveller. They
will follow you through the lonely Bush for a long time, jumping
from scrub to scrub and log to log chattering away to themselves.
They are for ever building nests and it is hard to find the one
they mean for raising a family in.
The Black-faced Cuckoo-Shrike is a bird I like to have with
me ; rather large, but gentle and tame, silver grey with forehead,
face and throat black. Soldier-birds are also very pretty but trouble¬
some in the aviary. Being short of rations one day out in the Bush
we tried these Soldier-birds as a dish, but the sweetness of their
flesh—the flavour of bad honey—saved them at once from further
slaughter. Recently I sent a pair of Mistletoe birds to the Zoo. in
London. Exquisite little fellows, steel blue with dark scarlet breast,
the hen grey. They fly very high, feeding on mistletoe berries ;
their swallowing capacity is enormous, since they can gulp down a
berry almost the size of a briar berry. Living so high up and
drinking the nectar of the flowers on the high trees, it is but rarely
one can catch them. If one succeeds they are worth their weight
in gold.
Out in the open and allowed the run on my lawns I have
the Stone Plover or Curlew, the Spurwing and Black-breasted
Plovers, which all breed with me very freely year by year. Then
there is the White-backed and Black Magpie and the Kagus,
which of course are not Australian; also Johnny, the Laughing
Jackass and Billy the Kestrel, a great friend of my pair of Black
and White Butcher Birds, which sleep with him on his perch at
night. A strange friendship! The Curlews were once friends of
Johnny the Jackass, but since he once inspected their nest too

closely and was nearly scalped by them in consequence there is
enmity between them. When Johnny laughs the Curlews will come
to the dividing fence and screech, being followed by a dozen Plovers
and Sea-gulls, and one wonders at the volume of row they can
create, each one trying to outscream the other. Johnny has been
many years with me and bye-the-bye is a lady which, in spite of
her years, still indulges in a flirt during spring-time. The gentleman
comes from goodness knows where and tries in his own way to per¬
suade his love “ to come and fly with me.” But Johnny cannot,
being pinioned, and so they sit and laugh at one another, the lover
on the fence, the lady on the ground ! Romeo and Juliet reversed ! !
For a time I had a Native Companion Crane, “Peter the
Great.” Peter was supposed to stand on his head at four a.m. and
whistle “God save the King ! ” I cannot vouch for the truth as to
whether he did it, as I do not rise quite so early and of course might
have missed it. Peter, like the Magpies, had a habit of pulling out
all small plants and newly-planted shrubs, so that eventually we had
to part with him. He met his death at Mrs. Roberts’ place in
Hobart, being killed, if I remember rightly, by a Kangaroo.
This concludes my articles on the birds of N.S.W. which I
kept and, with but few exceptions, caught myself. I might say that
the catching of especially the rarer birds is one of the many pleasures
I got out of life. First to locate the birds one wants, often necessi¬
tating long distances of travel and entailing inconveniences and
even hardships, which seems foolish to those not sufficiently enthu¬
siastic. Then comes the necessity of studying their habits and of
considering the likely places where they might be caught. To catch
birds is not so easy as it looks, it requires more patience even than
fishing : plenty of really unlimited time and often plenty of cash if
you want to get the rarer species. But the delight and satisfaction,
when after days and weeks of trying, one has succeeded in outwitting
the bird one wants and has it in one’s possession, more than com¬
pensates for all the trouble in obtaining it. :,:

SIR,—It is a very good move to offer medals for birds bred in cages ; but I
should like to plead for a considerable extension of a system of prizes.
Why should the medals be limited to the first time a bird is bred ? It is
very nice to be first, but it may be just as great an achievement to be tenth.
The first will probably be one who has a long purse, because naturally they are
the ones who get the rarest birds.
Why not divide the birds into several Classes, say Class I. True Finches ;
Class II. Mannikins ; Class III. Waxbills ; and so on. And offer in each Class
one or more prizes for the most meritorious breeding results, of not less than
perhaps three species. I11 this way we should get some competition and be
encouraged to do our best.* There might be an entrance fee for each Class.
Is not a cubic yard rather large for a cage? It might be 6 ft. 9 in. long.
4 ft. high and 1 ft. deep and still come under the yard.
I hope others will give their views on this subject.
H. A. SOAMES.
* If aviculturists keep birds for the love of the thing, one wonders why
they need encouragement by means of prizes in order to be successful in breed¬
ing different species. The birds bred would not fetch more money in the market,
as in the case of Poultry and Pigeons. But let us have the opinion of members
upon the suggestion of Mr. Soames. — ED,
