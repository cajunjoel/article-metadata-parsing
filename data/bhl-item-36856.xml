The Society&apos;s Medal.
The Society's Medal.
RULES.
The Medal may be awarded at the discretion of the Committee to any
Member who shall succeed in breeding, in the United Kingdom, any species of
bird which shall not be known to have been previously bred in captivity in Great
Britain or Ireland. Any Member wishing to obtain the Medal must send a
detailed account for publication in the Magazine within about eight weeks from the
date of hatching of the young and furnish such evidence of the facts as the
Executive Committee may require. The Medal will be awarded only in cases
where the young shall live to be old enough to feed themselves, and to be wholly
independent of their parents.
The account of the breeding must be reasonably full so as to afford
instruction to our Members, and should describe the plumage of the young and be
of value as a permanent record of the nesting and general habits of the species.
These points will have great weight when the question of awarding the Medal is
under consideration.
The parents of the young must be the bona fide property of the breeder. An
evasion of this rule, in any form whatever, will not only disqualify the breeder
from any claim to a Medal in that particular instance, but will seriously prejudice
any other claims he or she may subsequently advance for the breeding of the same
or any other species.
In every case the decision of the Committee shall be final.
The Medal will be forwarded to each Member as soon after it shall have been
awarded as possible.
The Medal is struck in bronze (but the Committee reserve the right to issue
it in silver in very special cases) and measures 24 inches in diameter. It bears on
the obverse a representation of two birds with a nest containing eggs, and the
words " The Avicultural Society--founded 1894." On the reverse is the following
inscription : " Awarded to ( name of recipient) for rearing the young of (name of
species) a species not previously bred in captivity in the United Kingdom."

JAYS,
By Hubert D. Astley.
The coloured plate illustrates a lovely member of an exceed-
ingly attractive and handsome genus, but, like all the Jays, not to
be trusted with smaller birds in an aviary. If our English Jaw
arrived for the first time as a rare foreigner from some part of South
America, aviculturists would exclaim at its beauty.
The family of the Jays is divided up into various genera.
The Blue Jay (North America and Canada) is Cyanocitta, as is the
Crowned Jay (Mexico) and the Long-crested or Diademed Jay
(Mexico and Western United States).
The Pileated, the Blue-bearded, the Black-headed, and the
Azure Jays are classed under Cyanocorax, whilst we have the subject
of our coloured illustration, along with the Peruvian, Beechey s,
Yucatan, and Hartlaub's under the generic name of Xanthura. The
Himalayan Jay, the Lanceolated, etc., are styled Garrulus, and
so on.
Blue and green are colours which Jays are often garbed in,
and nothing is more beautiful than the patch of azure blue, barred
with black, on the wing of our native bird.
As a rule, Jays are either exceedingly tame or the reverse, but
always exceedingly knowing, with eyes to the main chance. They
are not easy to breed in captivity, for they are apt to devour their
nestlings, especially if a bountiful supply of animal and insect food
is wanting.
Very omnivorous, Jays will eat meat, sparrows, potato, dog

On Jays.
biscuit, fruit, etc., concealing portions of their food in various corners
of an aviary, just as in wild life they will store away acorns or nuts
until needed for consumption.
A pair of Yucatan Jays, which I have had for some three
years or more, refuse to allow any other bird to remain in peace in
their aviary, and, much to my distress, murdered the female of a pair
of North American Blue Jays, and so mauled the male that I only
removed him in time to save his life. Yet the Blue Jays could fly
much more swiftly than their Yucatan cousins, and were in splendid
condition ; but the Yucatan Jays persevered in their bullying, never
leaving them alone until they finally overpowered them. The Blue
Jays seemed to have no idea of turning upon their attackers or of
resisting the onslaughts in any way, in spite of their superior
activity and equality in size. And these Yucatan Jays, after having
lived in peace with a pair of Golden Pheasants, set upon them too
one fine day, dashing and swooping at their heads until they also
had to be removed to more tranquil quarters. These Yucatan Jays
are extremely devoted to each other; a true pair in magnificent
condition, resembling small blue and black Magpies rather than
Jays, with their longish tails.
So it will be understood that any aviculturist who wishes to
keep Jays of any species must be very careful as to what other birds
are put in the same aviary, since in the case of my Yucatan Jays it
means no other birds except dead sparrows !
Whilst on the subject, we might mention the Long-tailed
Blue Jay of Mexico, which Mr. C. William Beebe describes as the
grandest of all its race. In " Two Bird-lovers in Mexico " he
wrote: " Occasionally a tumultuous flock of Long-tailed Crested
Blue Jays, or Magpie Jays, measuring ever two feet from head to
tail, burst down the canyon ; twenty or thirty brilliant blue and
white forms, graceful in every motion, with tall, recurved, fan-like

behind them as they fly. In cry and action they are thoroughly
Jay-like, and in curiosity they equal any member of their family.

interesting hour's watching of the wild life, when the sharp eyes of.

need of concealment in the vicinity. He would shriek and cry his
loudest, alarming the most confiding species, and making every bird
within a quarter of a mile uneasy and suspicious. Some of these
Jays have white throats, outlined by a band of blue, while in others
the whole throat and front of the neck is black. Perfect gradations
existed between these two extremes, the difference being due solely
to age. The Jays seemed to feed on anything--nuts, seeds, berries,
insects, and even small birds, which, apparently paralysed with
fear at the shrieks of the blue marauders, were an easy prey."
With regard to gradations of colours, mentioned by Mr.
Beebe, it is curious that the little blue and black Yucatan Jay has
the bill bright yellow for the first year of its life, after which it
gradually changes to black, and one then has a small Magpie-shaped
bird with black bill, head, and underparts, yellow legs, feet, and rim
round eyes ; the upperparts, with wings and tail, being a uniform
and very lovely shade of Kingfisher blue. Mr. Goodfellow brought
from Ecuador for Mr. Brook, in the noted collection which arrived
in London on September 7th, 1915, a lovely pair of all-blue Jays
(? the Azure Jay), which unfortunately died a short time after of lung
disease. They would have been most beautiful had they survived to
acquire a fresh suit of clean feathers.
Perhaps some other member will write for the magazine upon
this interesting and handsome family.

Dr. E. Hopkinson,
The minutes of the previous meeting were read and approved.
The Hon. Secretary (Dr. L. Lovell-Keays) announced that,
having offered his services to the army, he was obliged to retire from
the post of Hon. Secretary.
It was proposed by Mr. H. D. Astley and seconded by Mr.
Ezra that the Society expresses its gratitude to Dr. L. Lovell-Keays
for his valuable services rendered, and its great regret at his
resignation.
Miss Alderson accepted the vacant post of Hon. Secretary, and
was elected to fill the same.
A motion of regret was passed on the death of the late Colonel
Boyd Horsbrugh, for many years a valued member of the Council
and the Society.
Dr. L. Lovell-Keays was elected to the Council in the place of
Miss Alderson (who retires on becoming Hon. Secretary) and the Hon.
Mrs. Algernon Bourke was elected to fill the vacancy caused by the
death of Colonel Horsbrugh.
It was decided that the Hon. Secretary be instructed to
ascertain the names of members entitled to medals, and that the
medals be obtained and sent to them.
The Hon. Treasurer (Mr. B. C. Thomasset) announced that,
owing to two generous donations of #40 and #10 respectively to the
illustration fund, the finances of the Society are in a more favourable
condition, so long as members will pay their annual subscriptions
regularly.
The meeting then closed with a vote of thanks to the chair-
man and the Zoological Society.
THE BROWN-NECKED PARROT.
(Pceocejohalus fuscicollis.)
By Dr. E. Hopkinson.
Some years ago I wrote for our Magazine an account of this
Parrot, or rather of what I believe to be this species, though its
range as given in the British Museum Hand-List does not include

the Gambia. The only two Pceoccpliali given as occurring here
are P. senegalus and rubricapillus. The second is, I believe, P.
fuscicollis in its red-headed stage.
At that time I see that I had little but bad to say of this
Parrot as a pet, but this year a pair, which in every way belie what
I formerly thought and wrote, having come into my hands, justice
bids me make some attempt to remove the stigma I may have cast
on these " Bambaras," as we call them in the Gambia, while at
the same time I can take this opportunity to add to and modify,
from further acquaintance, my first description of their plumage.
This I will attempt first, and the best way to do this will be,
I think, to repeat my notes on the plumage of the three birds I had
then (1906) alive, and follow these with a description of my present
pair.
The whole plumage cycle of these Parrots is a * most
interesting one, and appears, as far as my experience goes, to show
three distinct phases. The first is characterised by brick-red
head-markings, which are lost at the first or second moult and
followed by the donning for a time of a wholly green and grey
plumage without any red of any shade either on the head, legs, or
wings. This is succeeded by a third stage, in which the grey and
green is set off by scarlet shoulders and " ankles &apos; -- a real scarlet,
quite different from* the first brick-colour. In one sex this brick-red
m seems to persist on the forehead only for a period at any rate of this
third stage, but whether the red forehead remains as a permanent
sexual distinction I cannot as yet say, but hope that my present
pair will settle this point.
My 1906 birds I described (Avie. Mag., third series, vol. i,
p. 107) as follows :
"No. 1. A very old bird. . . . Whole head (including
forehead), neck, and upper chest brown-grey, each feather with a
darker centre; a reddish tinge on chin. Back dusky green;
scapulars, flights, and tail dull black with a greenish tinge; rump,
upper tail-coverts, breast, abdomen, thighs, and under tail-coverts
grass-green, brightest on the rump; under wing-coverts dark green
merging into grey. Edge of wing (at angle) and ring round lower
end of thigh orange-vermilion. Sexes apparently alike. The beak,

Dr. E. Hopkinson,
which is large and strong and looks out of all proportion to the size
of the bird, is horn-coloured ; the cere a paler shade of the same
colour. Legs black, iris dark brown. Length 12 in.
" No. 2. A younger but nearly adult bird. . . . Like
No. 1, with a grey head, but the green of the rump and under
surface was not so bright and there was no sign of vermilion on the
angle of the wing or thighs.
" No. 3. A young but fully feathered bird with just a few
tufts of down showing on the back and breast; taken from the nest.
The whole crown from forehead to nape bright brick-red (or rather
a colour between brick-red and pink), with a pale wash of the same
colour over the rest of the head, the ground colour of which is
brownish-grey as in the adult. This red persists for four or five
months after the bird leaves the nest, and during that time
gradually changes into the grey of the adult, though some signs of it
last till the first moult. In other respects the plumage resembled
No. 2."
A. Whole head (including forehead), neck, and-throat, brown-
grey, each feather with a darker centre. In the centre of the nape,
however, is a dark green patch which shades into the back. On the
chin and sides of throat the grey is tinged with dusky brick colour.
The upper chest is a grey-green with no dark centres to the feathers.
General colour above green, duller on the back and brighter on the
wings and rump. Flight feathers black, with narrow green edges
above and dark grey below. Tail black above, sepia brown below.
Edge and internal surface of angle of wing and narrow " anklets "
round the lower end of the leg feathers orange-vermilion. Under
surface grass-green ; the breast, owing to the presence of dark
centres to the feathers, duller than the other lower parts.
B. Forehead and anterior third of the crown brick-red (or
rather a colour between brick-red and pinkish). The green nape-
patch seen in A. not very marked. Rest of head and remainder of
plumage much the same as in A., but the green is throughout rather
brighter and also tinged on the upper surface with bluish, and with
yellow or yellowish on the lower. The red, too, on the wings and
legs is more extensive and a bright vermilion or true soldier-scarlet
without any orange shade.

In both birds the irides are dark brown, the legs and ceres-
grey, the beak horn-grey without black tip.
These two birds are, I know T , about sixteen months old at
the present time, having been taken from the nest in March, 1915,
and as they both came from the same nest are almost certainly
a true pair, but which is which I do not know. A., the more
soberly-clad bird, has more the appearance of maleness and is
particularly pally with a Grey Parrot, which is almost certainly a
hen; but, on the other hand, the brighter colours of the other go a
long way in support of his being a male, unless it turns out that
in this species the female outshines her mate, as in the Eclecti
of the East.
We can now turn to their attractive qualities. Although
they can hardly be called pretty, and their heavy build and huge
beaks give them a rather clumsy appearance, one has to own
that they are very striking-looking birds. This particular pair,
too, in every way exemplify the adage, " Handsome is as handsome
does," for they are in character and condition in every way the
opposite of nearly every other " Bambara " I have known. They
are the most confiding company-seeking pair of birds possible,
and as gentle as lambs with all white men, though to the black
the fiercest foes. To a white man they will come at any time
and love to climb all over him, using their deadly-looking beaks to
play with and nibble at his ears or fingers in the gentlest possible
manner, and so far have never made a mistake and used them with
evil intent, even under the influence of sudden excitement. Not
one, however, of the *&apos; boys" dare touch them, and at their or any
other black man's approach they set up a deafening din, and so
have quite a real value as watchmen. Occasionally, when they have
wandered too far, one of the boys has to be sent after them, but he
can only retrieve them by getting them to climb on a cage or
long stick, and this only after much perseverance on his part,
and after still more resistance and torrents of bad language from
the birds.*
* [This is perhaps due, not so much to the skin colouring of the natives,
as to their "auras" and vibrations, which are probably antagonistic, or, at any
rate, unsympathetic.--E d.]

Mr. E. J. Brook,
These birds do not actually belong to me, but are left in
my care by their owner, who has gone to East Africa, and who
anyhow did not wish to take them home to lose them there from
cold or on account of no facilities for their keep. From their
earliest days they have been made much of, living loose in their
owner's camp when on the march or in his compound when at
headquarters, and have never been caged except for the actual
day's march or at night. Now they are living on my verandah
in Bathurst with wings sufficiently clipped to prevent their straying
far, but not enough to prevent them reaching a favourite tree
near by or to cause them to fall in a heap at every attempt at
flight. Nearly every night I find them at dark in their cage,
which they reach via the verandah steps, though occasionally
they have to be hunted for at dusk ; but this never takes long,
for they always make their whereabouts known by their voices.
They have no longings for a night out.
Against their charms, which are many, must, however, be
put two great drawbacks--namely, their great destructiveness
and their screaming powers ; but neither of these out here matters
so very much, where one lives a practically outdoor life and where
the things on which the huge beaks can work havoc are of small
account; but at home I am afraid that consideration for (or the
hostility of) one's neighbours, combined with a regard for one&apos;s
furniture and other belongings, would soon cause their exile to
the Zoo, in spite of all their endearing ways.

GROSBEAK (Pheucticus chrysog aster), NANDAY

I am sending these notes to report the rearing of the Yellow
Grosbeak, Nanday Conures, and Guttural Finch. The Grosbeaks
came to me in a collection from Ecuador, and when recovered from
fihe long journey were placed in a good-sized aviary with an outside
flight. The nest was built in the fork of a branch in the inner
house, and was a very rough construction of coarse grass. The birds

would not use dry grass or hay that was offered them, but built the
nest entirely.of green grass they pulled up in the flight. Two eggs
were laid, of a bluish colour mottled on the rounded end. Incubation
took about fourteen days, I think, and the young left the nest in
about three weeks. For about a fortnight the young were fed entirely
on insects, mostly mealworms, of which I luckily have plenty.
By degrees seed seemed to take the place of live food, and
now that the young are feeding themselves I do not think anything
but seed and green food is taken.
My observations on all these birds that I am reporting on are
rather crude, partly owing to the wildness of the birds and partly to
want of time to watch properly and take the necessary notes.
The pair of Nanday Conures I have had for about two years
They laid three eggs in a large parrot-breeding box, all of which
proved fertile. The three young birds remained a very long time in
the nest, and when they left it were so well grown that it was&apos;difficult
to distinguish them from the old ones. I can see no colour
difference at all, but the tail is slightly shorter. There seemed to be
two or three days between the hatching of the eggs, and there was
an interval of three or four between each bird leaving the nest. I
sometimes think the young are larger and better grown than the
parent birds. There is nothing of particular interest to report on the
rearing of these birds that is not common to the rearing of all parrots.
The pair of Guttural Finches were obtained in Trinidad, and I
have had them exactly a year. The nest, which was in a large
mass of clematis, was built of grass and shaped like a deep egg-cup.
Three eggs were laid ; they all hatched, and the three young birds
are now on the wing.
I am not quite sure to what extent the young were reared
on insects, but certainly a good number were given, as the parents
were &apos;constantly on the hunt for what they could find, and as the
aviary is a large one there was no difficulty about an ample supply.
I can say nothing about coloration, as I cannot get near
enough to the birds to see the colour properly, and they are always
so mixed up with foliage that a glass is not much good.

Mr. W. H. St. Quintin,
[It will be recalled that Mr. Brook's collection of biids from
Ecuador was landed in England on September 7th, 1915, by Mr.
Walter Goodfellow (c/. Avig. Mag., October, 1915).
The Grosbeaks, which have successfully bred for the first
time in Europe, are very handsome. Rather larger than a Virginian
Cardinal, the male has black upper parts, with bold white spots on
the wings and tail, and brilliant daffodil-yellow head and under parts.
The female is greenish-yellow.
We congratulate Mr. Brook on the success of breeding these
rare birds.-- Ed.]

BREEDING OF THE LITTLE BUSTARD IN

<bodyText confidence="0.977609826086956" page_id="9411662"  page_num="Page 30" year="" vol="">
1915,
By W. H. St. Quintin.
I am sorry that the numerous duties, which occupy most of
us at the present time, have prevented me from sending in this
communication earlier.
It has long been my ambition to breed a Bustard! Since
1886 I have never been without examples of the Great Bustard. I
have had many clutches of eggs laid here, but once only was a chick
hatched, which, from stress of weather, soon died, as I have recorded
in vol. ii of the new series of the Magazine.
From what I have seen, the smaller species, 0. tetrax, is a
much easier subject to breed, given healthy, tame birds, and suitable
surroundings.
Though I have managed to keep 0. tarda in an apparently
thoroughly healthy condition for long periods (a male died through
an accident after being hei'e nine years, a female also through an
accident after eleven years, while I have a female at this moment
which was imported from Spain nineteen years ago), still their eggs,
with the above single exception, have always been unfertile.
Perhaps this is due to the impossibility of supplying sufficient insect
food to such large birds at the season when, in the wild state, they
would be largely supplementing their vegetable diet by grasshoppers,
lizards, etc.

on the breeding of the Little Bustard in 1915. 31
In the case of the smaller bird, of course, such insects as we
supply, or as the birds pick up for themselves in their enclosures in
fine weather, "go much further." At any rate I have had, several
times, fertile eggs laid by two out of the 1 three females that I have
kept.
In 1912 a Little Bustard hatched two eggs, but the chicks
were sorely tried by the wet season, and the mother bird was so shy
that she did not take .advantage of our efforts to provide shelter for
her young, and the one that survived longest died, when just
beginning to feather, at fifteen days of age.
Last summer my birds were in fine condition, a male and two
females, all, I believe, birds of 1907. Until the grass gets up in
their enclosure, which they share with a pair of Oyster Catchers and
an Australian Thick-knee, the Little Bustards are shut up at night
in a dry shed. As with all Bustards, their silky feathers do not
turn rain well, and they are safer too on a floor of peat moss in damp
weather, even on such light soil as we luckily have here. The two
females winter quite well in a shed, but the male appears to feel the
damp more, and I generally keep him between October and April in
an aviary, which can be warmed by hot-water pipes.
The male Little Bustard assumes the nuptial dress very
much later than his bigger relative. In the case of Otis tarda, the
chestnut pectoral bands and " whiskers " begin to show about the
middle of December and he is in full dress by March, when tetrax
is just beginning to put on his handsome neck and chest ornaments
(here in East Yorkshire).
As soon as his courting-dress is complete, the nature of the
male Little Bustard alters. Hitherto a peaceable, inoffensive bird,
he becomes transformed into an excitable little warrior, seemingly
always spoiling for a fight. With short steps, head carried high,
and tail depressed, neck feathers extended laterally, and eye blazing,
he frequently runs to some selected spot, a bit of rising ground for
choice, where be utters his curious double rattling note like
miniature castanets, jerking his head back at the same time and
finishing the performance by a leap in the air with a whistling
"whip " of his wings. The note " carries " several hundred yards.
Whether the Great Bustard is polygamous or not, has been

Mr. W. H. St. Quintin,
argued both ways, but there is no doubt that tetrax contents himself
with one w T ife. Last spring my bird would have killed the second
female, after he had made his choice, if w T e had not removed her.
Whether the male would have taken any share of the parental duties,
I cannot say from last summer's experience. I was only too glad to
see the female settle down quietly to nest, for I knew that we could
supplement her efforts to find insect food for the young, if hatched,
and we removed the male to another enclosure.
There have been varied statements as to the number of eggs
laid by this bird. Authors have accepted too readily the statements
of professional collectors, it seems to me. For example, Dresser, in
' Birds of Europe,' quotes a Mr. Aksakoff as stating that he had
found nine eggs in a nest which he had trodden upon, crushing the
sitting bird. Another Piussian collector is in the same work
mentioned as having " stated positively that the bird lays from eight
to twelve eggs." Seebohm (' British Birds ') records finding a nest
with four eggs on the Danubian Steppes, on which the hen bird was
sitting. Here I have never had more than three eggs laid in a
clutch--and the nests of my birds have consisted of a hollow rubbed
out, well protected by a canopy of coarse herbage, and lined with a
little withered grass.
My bird in 1915 laid three eggs, the clutch being complete
on June loth. But, as there was a great quantity of rough g]^,ss
in the enclosure, and we were afraid of disturbing the bird by too
frequent investigations, I could not exactly say when she commenced
to incubate. But in 1909 a single Little Bustard's egg, placed
under a Silky Hen, hatched on the twenty-first day, which deter-
mines the length of the incubation period. Two chicks were hatched
in the evening of July 2nd, the remaining egg proving unfertile.
Up to the hatching day the weather was all that could he
desired ; hut, unluckily, a very wet spell set in at that very critical
time. Fortunately, as a precaution, we had got the bird quite
accustomed to a light taken off a garden frame, which, when one
day she was off at feed, was placed over the nest, supported so
that there was plenty of air, and access to the nest from all sides.
This, no doubt, saved the chicks, for we had torrents of rain in the
next five days, aggregating L74 in. The mother bird kept the

young ones for the first day or two under the shelter of the light,
and they were safely brooded there at night.
When the chicks were three days old I watched their parent
searching for food in the drenched grass, though the day was so wet
and cold that she did not seem to be very successful in finding
insects. When she picked a fly off the grass she ran off to where
she knew the chicks were hidden up, and they answered to her
clucking call and hurried up to take the insect from her bill.
Luckily the bird is very tame, and she took mealworms readily, to
feed to the young. On the fifth day both young birds picked up
chopped egg from the ground freely.
The next day the rain seemed so interminable that, though
the risk was considerable, I decided to have the three birds moved to
a shed with a dry earthen floor, where they soon settled down, and
before night the mother was brooding the chicks quite comfortably.
The young birds throve apace on a diet of mealworms,
gentles, barley and Spratt's meal, chopped egg and lettuce, and by
July 22nd, when three weeks old, they were getting much more
independent of the mother, whom they almost exactly resembled
in plumage, the only difference that I could see being that, in the
young, the iris was a good deal paler than in the adult, and that there
was a well-defined buff streak down the centre of the crown of the
head; but on the feathers faded, this distinction became negligible.
When five weeks old the young appeared certainly more
than half grown.
As there is some uncertainty about the plumage of the
young male in its first year, whether it resembles the female, or
whether, from the first, the markings on the upper parts are finer
in the young male, I hoped the young might turn out to be a pair,
so that we might settle this point. One of the young was slightly
larger than the other, and seemed likely to be a male. However,
unfortunately there was soon an opportunity of settling the sex
of this bird, for somehow it hianaged to break one wing close to the
shoulder, too high up to amputate, and, gangrene setting in, the poor
little thing died on September 2nd. It proved on dissection to be a
female.
Now, when thirteen months old, the survivor resembles the

parent exactly, though it is, if anything, slightly the larger of the
two. I am inclined to think that this is also a female.
I am sorry to add that this year I have had no further
success. The same female went to nest again near her old place,
and on June 16th had one egg. I cannot help thinking that she
had lost some others; anyhow she began to sit at once, and no
more eggs were laid.
All seemed well and she sat steadily till something disturbed
her one night, and she left her egg containing a chick almost ready
to break the shell.
[Note made October 20th .--I was wrong ! Recently the bird
has moulted, and is certainly a male. The spots on the flanks
have gone, and the lower breast, which was tinged with ochre, is
now, like the flanks, pure white. The new feathers on the shoulders
are marked wflth fine wavy striations, instead of the coarse lines,
and spots of the first year (and as in females at all ages). There
apparently the change ends; and, as the bird has not assumed the
complete plumage of the adult, it seems probable that it will not
take on the nuptial dress next spring, and that it will not breed.
But it is evident that, as regards, plumage, the young of both
sexes of 0. tetrax are, in their first year, undistinguishable from the
adult female ; and that the young males partly assume the markings
characteristic of the adult, at their first moult, when about fifteen
months old.]

BRETONNEUX.
From an article written by Chevalier Debreuil, originally pub-
lished in the 1 Bulletin of the National Society of Acclimatization
&apos; of France,' and translated by the Editor and Dr. Butler.
It is on his beautiful property of Villers-Bretonneux, near
Amiens, that M. Jean Delacour has created a veritable ornithological
park.

on the collection of birds oivned by Monsieur Jean Delacour. 35
The property, situated on the hills of Santerre, dominates the
valley of the Somme; in spite of its distance from the Channel, a
matter of more than sixty kilometres, the influence of the sea makes
itself distinctly felt, especially by the dominating west winds.
Violent winds are frequent, and also fine and cold rain ; the bad
weather is more prolonged than in the neighbourhood of Paris, and
the temperature is often three or four degrees lower.
The soil is a very fertile clay, with a subsoil of limestone.
It was in 1907 that M. Delacour, who was then quite youthful, con-
structed his first aviaries.
They comprised : (1) Three flights of 32 square metres by 36
(a metre = about 1 yd. 3 in.), traversed by running water, and
planted with shrubs and having roqsting-houses. These contain
exotic passerine birds.
(2) Five flights of 15 square metres, four containing galli-
naceous birds, the fifth having fine wire meshing and a very warmed
shelter; this is tenanted by Waxbills and other small passerine
birds. These five flights contain 150 birds, comprising thirty-one
species.
In 1911 the enclosures were added to. Eleven in number,
they have an area of 2500 square metres; most of them enclose a
sheltering house, and are . traversed by running water. All have
wire meshing of over 6 ft. in height, and the enclosures are planted
with shrubs, etc.
They contain gallinaceous birds, waders, etc.--thirty-eight
species in all.
There are other enclosures for Ostriches, Rheas, and Casso-
waries. The piece of water, which stretches in front of the chateau,
was enlarged during the winter of 1912-13.
At that time M. Delacour was on military service, but this
did not prevent him from actively directing the works which were
being carried out.
The piece of water is about 50 metres in diameter, with two
islands, and is prolonged by a stream which is 70 metres in length
and 4 in breadth.
The pheasantry, which was commenced in the spring of 1913,
was finished in the following winter, and encloses 43 flights from

10 to 50 square metres, 24 to the left and 19 to the right,
separated by a domed pagoda. The whole length is 80 metres by
16 in breadth. Eleven of the flights communicate with a heated
apartment. To the north and east there is a protecting wall, whilst
to the south and west there is glass. Sixty-eight species of galli-
naceous and other birds are represented.

PROHIBITION OF IMPORTATION OF BIRDS.

We fear this regulation will be hard upon dealers in foreign
birds, and also that our British wild birds may suffer, since they
will probably be in greater demand, and to decimate their ranks
would be undesirable.
A fine consignment of African birds has just squeezed through
as the door was being shut, and is in charge of Mr. T. J. Hose, 8,
Park Place, Clapham Park Road, S.W.
Amongst them are Red-collared, Shaft-tailed, and Pin-tailed
Whydahs, various Waxbills, such as Ruddy, Dufresne's, Blue-
breasted, etc., all in fine condition.
The Red-collared Whydah is an extremely handsome bird.

A BEETLE (?) FOE BREEDING AS FOOD.
Dear Sir,--A friend has given me some insects to be bred as a food for
insectivorous birds ; they are Garausius morosus. I am told that these insects are
now given to the birds at the Zoological Gardens. Can you tell me if they are
good for them, and if they would be suitable for my Paradise birds, Motmot,
Toucans, Thrushes, etc. The insects eat ivy leaves.
Yours, etc.,
Jean Delacour (France).
[I wrote to Mr. Seth-Smith, Curator of Birds at the London Zoological
Gardens, who replied that he does not know this insect. Can any member
enlighten us ? Is it a beetle ?-- Ed.]

NESTING OF GLOSSY IBIS.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990751" page_id="9411676"  page_num="Page 42" year="" vol="">
Dear Sir, --My pair of Glossy Ibis have again this last season caused me
much disappointment in the way of failure of nesting operations.
Each summer for a good many years past they have spent a great deal of
time nest-building on a platform a few feet square provided for the purpose. I
give them rushes and birch twigs on the platform, and also a stock on the ground.
Both birds seem to take the greatest interest and pleasure in moving the nesting
material into various positions, and usually make a good large heap at one corner
of the platform. The pleasure of the birds in nesting is very evident and their
actions are accompanied by much croaking, the cock constantly throwing back his
head and spreading his wings with loud cries.

When, however, it comes to laying eggs, these are almost invariably broken,
either on the nest or by being thrown down on the ground. Both birds seem so
*excited when an egg is laid that they push it about with their bills and utter oud
cries at intervals, the result always being disaster.
I should be very much obliged if some members of the Avicultural Society
could inform me if they have similar troubles, and, if so, if they have discovered
any remedy, as I should much like to get a hatch of Ibis next year if possible.

the chattering of wild Pheasants at night when bombs were dropped a good many
miles distant, and in the June number Mr. Smalley wrote an interesting letter as
to Pheasants in his neighbourhood not taking any notice of ordinary blasting in
adjacent quarries, but being a good deal disturbed by heavy charges of dynamite
exploded in such quarries at monthly intervals.
I am merely writing now to record as an interesting experience that the
same wild Pheasants which last spring were greatly disturbed by the dropping of
bombs between twenty and thirty miles distant did not make any noise or show
any sign whatever of disturbance when similar bombs were dropped by night
within a mile or so of the wood where they were roosting. I had exceptionally
good opportunities of observation.

A TRIO OF LUTINOS.
My brother has recently sent me from India no less than three Lutino
Indian Parrakeets representing three species, the Ring-neck ( Palceor.nis torquatus),

the Alexandrine (P. nepalensis), and the Plumhead (P. cyanocephalus). All are in
line condition and are not yearlings, since they have the full long tail. In all, the
yellow is pure and perfect, of that particularly delicate sulphur shade one gets in
these Lutinos. The Plumhead has a pink head, and the Alexandrine shows the
usual red patch on the wings, the wing coverts adjacent to it being also edged
slightly with red, giving a very pretty effect. The Ring-neck and the Plumhead
both have red eyes and flesh-coloured feet; the Alexandrine's eyes are normal in
colour, but the feet are light. However, some races of the Alexandrine have pale-
coloured feet naturally. Neither the Ring-neck nor the Alexandrine has a ring.
Besides being the finest-looking bird, the Alexandrine is by far the rarest of the

three ; in fact, is the first Lutino of the species I have heard of, although
Alexandrines are quite as common as Plumheads, if not more so. Along with
these came a Lutino Plumhead with normal eyes and feet. This is rapidly
assuming normal plumage, also being far enough advanced in the change to show
that it js a male bird.

BIRDS IN THE LONDON PARKS.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996414423076923" page_id="9411681"  page_num="Page 45" year="" vol="">
By Hubert D. Astley.
To aviculturists who live for most of the year in London the
wild birds, as well as the domesticated waterfowl, are always a
pleasure when there is a time for a walk in St. James's Park, Hyde
Park, and Regent's Park, &amp;c., especially if you rise early on a spring
or summer morning when most of London is still in bed, or at any
rate within doors.
Mr. T. Digby Pigott published a nominal list of London birds
in 1892, mainly based upon that published in 1879 by Dr. Edward
Hamilton (Zoologist, p. 273), who gave 94 species as having been
recorded, which list has no doubt received additions since that date.
One of the most conspicuous is the Wood Pigeon, which has been
firmly established for some years, and is now semi-domesticated.
In an early morning walk along the Serpentine you will
see them bathing in small groups, and their nests are built wherever
trees are to be found, the builders being quite undisturbed by
the roar of the traffic and the hooting of motor cars. In winter
time there are often huge flocks.
Blackbirds and Song-Thrushes are very numerous, but there
are many others, such as Robins, Chaffinches, Greenfinches, Wood-
peckers, Dabchicks, and the rest. Their plumage for the most part
suffers, lacking the gloss and cleanliness of the country birds, but
they find, except for cats, that they have protection, being neither
snared nor shot. Wheatears and Cuckoos have been seen.
The most picturesque addition to bird life from October to March
is the great number of Black-headed Gulls (Larus ridibundus), which&apos;

the public delights in feeding with bread, so that these graceful birds
have become so confiding that they will take food from the hand,
settling on the walls of the Thames embankment, or flying backwards
and forwards in groups to catch morsels thrown to them.
They mingle with the ducks and geese on the waters, and
now look upon London as their definite home for the winter.
Occasionally a Budgerigar ora Bing-necked Parrakeet manages
to exist for a time in some London park, and it would be very
fascinating if Parrakeets of different species could be established,
seed being provided for them in different spots. An attempt was
made to do this with Australian Crested Doves, which were turned
out in the Zoological Gardens, but although some of them nested,
they gradually disappeared, probably down the maws of the London
cats for the most part.
Barbary Doves ought to be able to hold their own, provided
they were fed regularly, and their cooing in the trees on summer
days would greatly add to the attractions of the parks.
There are many Londoners, inhabitants of the great city from
necessity rather than choice, whose avicultural proclivities have to
find vent in the study and presence of the birds in the parks; men,
women, and children who, whilst longing for the song of the
nightingale, find solace and interest in other feathered folk which
are contented to treat London as a haven and an abode.
Of course, in parts of what is known as London, although we
have only been referring to the heart itself, one sees and hears other
birds which do not regularly live in the London parks; suburban
birds they might be called. There is no doubt that the increase of
bird life in the great metropolis during the last thirty years has
encouraged the public to think more about the birds, and those men
and women who are now grown up cannot but recall with happiness
the days when as children they fed the ducks, the portly Wood-
pigeons, and the Black-headed gulls. One remembers the old
gentleman in Hyde Park who every day, with much inward concen-
tration and apparent oblivion to all humans about him, walked along
closely followed by a small cloud of sparrows. At intervals he
would halt, holding out an arm, on which a Wood-pigeon settled to
eat bread-crumbs from his hand, or else he found amusement in

fixing pellets into the interstices of the tree trunks, from which the
sparrows extracted them.
And now the wounded, in peace like lambs, in war like lions
(as the ancient adage has it) ; maimed, halt, and even the blind ;
show that they too can find solace in aviculture, if by that we mean
the care and study of birds in freedom as well as in aviaries and
cages. For that indeed our Society was founded.
Therefore we publish, through the courtesy of the artist, Miss
Estella Canziani, a reproduction of her very striking picture, which
has been supplied to us by the Medici Society 1 &quot; (7, Grafton Street,
W.), for which permission we beg to tender our thanks, thinking
that in the future, as well as we hope the present, such a reminder
of the great war will serve as an interesting record, at the same time
encouraging aviculturists to tame birds in their wild or semi-wild
life, whether in town or country.

The rich meadow lands, the orchards and gardens, as well
as the great woods and forests of North America, both in Canada
and the States, are full of sweet-voiced birds, and the little Warblers
are responsible for a large part of the concert. Many of these
Warblers, as well as tuneful voices have pretty plumage, and all
are a fascinating study. I thought, therefore, that these few notes
might be of some slight interest to bird-lovers, who, like myself,
enjoy watching their little feathered friends in their native
surroundings.
The American Warblers are seldom seen in confinement,
nor do their names figure in bird-shop catalogues. There are such
numbers of them that a full description of all would fill a volume.
I have only chosen here just a few among the many that I have
watched with care and pleasure, and whose sweet notes have

often charmed an idle hour, and will always remain a delightful
memoi&apos;y.
I have in no w 7 ay attempted to classify the Warblers I
mention ;* I have merely selected the notes haphazard from my
American-bird note-book, taken during the time I was in Canada
and the Northern and Southern States at different seasons in the
spring, summer and autumn months.
Many of these Warblers are very much alike in colouring,
so that anyone wishing to identify a bird has to take note of any
peculiarity of marking and colour, also the places which are their
favourite haunts. Some love the deep forests, and some the gardens
and orchards; some live high in the branches ; some near, and
even on, the ground; some frequent the chilly North, some the
&apos;warm South. All these points have to be considered in making
the acquaintance of these little American birds.
The first Warbler's name I find in my note-book is that of
the Black-poll Warbler [Dendroica striata], a small bird which is
black and white with a streaky, greenish and black back and a velvet
black cap. In summer this little bird is often seen in orchards and
gardens fluttering up and down the stems and branches of fruit trees
seeking for insects. It builds in Canada, and makes a very large
nest for its size.
Another dear little bird is the Blue-winged Warbler [Helmin-
thophila pinus]; in colouring it is olive, shading to blue-grey, with a
yellow cap, breast and underparts, with white bars on its slate-blue
wings, and white blotches on its tail. This Warbler, too, may be
found in orchards, hunting for insects, and heard singing a queer
little " see-saw " song. One naturalist (N. Blanchard) says that the
leaves which form part of the Blue-Wing's nest are all placed with
their stems pointing upwards. I have never been fortunate enough
to find their nest, so have not seen this peculiarity.
* American Warblers--Mniotiltidae--are peculiar to the New World; they
have only nine primaries, instead of ten. There are over 130 species, and over 1'25
are summer visitors to North America (United States and Canada). They may
be arranged in five groups--Creeping Warblers, Ground Warblers, Worm-eating
Warblers, Fly-catching Warblers and Wood Warblers--but even now the sub-
divisions are undetermined. The average size of the Warblers is about 5 to
6 inches; a few are smaller, 4 and 4-75, and Icteria virens is the largest,.
7 5 inches.

The Blue Yellow-Backecl, or Pamla Warbler [Compsothypis
americana], is also a blue-grey and yellow bird. It has a very
indistinct band of dark colour, which is sometimes reddish-brown&amp;gt;
across its yellow waistcoat; two white patches or bars on the wings,
and two or three at the end of the tail help to distinguish it. Parulas
are wonderfully graceful little birds; they are oftenest seen fluttering
about near the outside twigs and branches of tall trees. They live
chiefly on insects. They nest in Canada, where we often saw them,
and they winter in Florida, where we also met them. Their song is
a sweet " thready " little warble.
The Bedstart, or Yellow-tailed Warbler [Setophaga ruticilla],
is a lovely little bird in the breeding season, for then his colouring is
rich pinkish orange, with a shiny metallic-black head, a white breast
shading to orange, black wings lined with orange, and a black and
orange tail. During the rest of the year you may see a dull
brownish-black bird which is difficult to recognise as your brilliant
springtime acquaintance. The hens are yellow where the cocks are
orange, the young are most like the hen. This Redstart has an odd
sharp little note which it repeats several times in succession. It feeds
on insects, dashing out at them with sudden short flight, spreading
its tail like a Fantail Warbler. This bird, it is said, takes two years
to reach its perfect plumage.
The Myrtle Warbler [Dendroica coronata] has a grey-bluish
back, the under parts are mottled and streaked with black, and it has
two white bars on its wings, but the surest way of distinguishing it
is by looking out for its four yellow patches, one on its head, one on
its back and one on either side. It is a very common bird in Florida,
but migrates as far as Canada.when the nesting-time comes. Myrtle
Warblers live chiefly on myrtle and juniper berries and the like,
and if food is plentiful and the weather fairly mild some birds may
remain north even through the winter.
The Black-throated Blue Warbler [Dendroica cceruleseens] is
rather more a grey-blue bird than a really blue one, with a light grey
head shading to dark above the tail, with black breast, sides, throat
and cheeks, while the under parts are pure white; a conspicuous
white spot on the wings is a help towards identification. The nest is
generally placed in low bushes, and in rather damp places in woods.

The song is so very soft and low, and so difficult to hear, that I am
not absolutely sure of having heard it, not having actually seen the
bird singing. The hen is quite different from the little cock, she is
dusky olive-green and palish dirty yellow, with only a faint tinge
of the blue-grey.
There is no fear of overlooking a Black and White Creeping
Warbler [Mniotilta varia]. He is only found in America, and is the
" cutest " little fellow imaginable. He is striped and splashed with
black and white all over, and may be found clinging to tbe bark of
trees like a tiny Woodpecker while he seeks his insect food. He alse
flutters up and down the stems and branches like a Black-Poll Warbler.
These creeping Warblers have a very small, soft song; you may watch
them suddenly pause in the middle of their insect hunt to sing
(&amp;lt; Twee-ek-ie, tweek-ie tw-e-e-e-e," hardly above a whisper.
The Oven-bird, or Teacher [Seiurus aurocapillus], is a small
Wood-Warbler, which gets its first odd name from the curious oven-
like nest it builds on the ground, like a wee mole-heap with a doorway
at the side. Its second name is from its call-note, which sounds like
"Teacher, teacher," many times repeated, and getting louder at each
repetition. Oven-birds are very shy little fellows, and become almost
paralysed with fear at the approach of a possible enemy, human
or animal.
As well as its odd call-note, the Oven-bird has a very lovely
song, which occasionally may be heard in the nesting season. I
had the good luck to hear it once, and to see the bird as he sang.
He hovered in the air, almost like a Lark, but among the tall forest
trees instead of over open ground, and he sang his wonderful little
song as he hovered, and then dropped suddenly to the ground, and
was hidden in the undergrowth. He is a sombre-coloured little
bird, greenish-olive above and white underneath, his breast spotted
wtih dark lines and dots. He has a white eye ring; the only bit
of brightish colour is his orange-brown cap, edged with black, which
justifies his third name of Golden-crowned "Thrush," though he
is no Thrush !
The Summer Yellow Bird [Dendroica aestiva] deserves his
charming name. He is really yellow ; above slightly tinged with
olive, below bright yellow with a few streaks of burnt sienna. He

has a mild little song of four or five little "cheeps" constantly varied
in tone.
It is said the Cow-birds often lay their eggs in this Warbler's
nest, and that the little owner of the nest builds another storey over
the intruding egg, and that nests with as many as three stories have
been found built over three different Cow-birds' eggs.
I found a Summer Yellow Bird's nest (near Napanee); it was
most beautifully made of fine grass and thistle-down and fern-down.
It certainly had a sort of rudimentary double floor, but there were
no eggs in it, either its own or Cow-birds', for whatever there
were had long been hatched and the birds flown, as it was the end
of July.
The Canadian Warbler, or Canadian Flycatcher [Sylvania
canadensis], as it is sometimes called, lives in damp woods, where it
can find plenty of insects. It catches them on the wing, as well as
picking them off plants and trees. Its colouring is grey above with
black streaks on its bead ; its breast is yellow, with a row of black
marks across it, set like a Lord Mayor's chain of office. Its song is
louder than that of most Warblers, but very sweet and clear.
The Blackburnian, Hemlock Warbler, or Torch Bird [Dendroica
blackburniae], is lovely. His head is bright orange and black ; his
throat and breast are orange, shading into whitish ; his back, tail, and
wings are black and white, and he is altogether as smart a little fellow
as you could wish to see. Fluttering among the dark trees of the
Canadian forests I have watched little couples of Torch Birds, the
brightly-coloured little cock, and his dull-coloured mate, busy with their
family cares and affairs which the little cock bird varies by stopping
now and again to sing a little pleasant warble, unremarkable, but
full of sweetness. Their winter home is in the South, where they
go some time in September.
Another Warbler, rather a rare one too in North America, is
the Prothonotary, or Florida Warbler [Prothonotaria citrea]. He is
bright yellow, grey and olive, with white marks on his tail which show
when he flies. He has rather a long bill for a Warbler. We made
his acquaintance at Eau Galee in Florida, but I never heard his song.
He does not migrate far North, hardly beyond the swampy forests
of the Southern States.

The Bay-breasted Warbler [Dendroica castanea] has a reddish
breast, in fact really "bay its crown too is the same colour, its back
greenish and black streaky. It has black cheeks and forehead, and
white bars on its wings; a white patch on either side of the neck is a
good identification mark. This little bird is also called the Autumnal
Warbler, I suppose because its breast is so like the colour of a withered
leaf. Bay-breasts are genei&apos;ally found in the tall trees of the Canadian
forests, but often come, in small flocks, to feed in gardens and
hedgerows.
We first met the Magnolia Warbler [Dendroica maculosa] in
Canada, and renewed our acquaintance near New Orleans, at the
opposite ends of his migratory journey. His back is black, with olive
shading, and underneath he is all bright, clear yellow. His blue-grey
cap, with a white line behind and a broad black band all round, and
a large white spot on the wings, and white across the middle of the
quills of the tail, distinguish him very well. The Magnolia Warbler's
song is a clear, distinct, quick whistle, which he seems thoroughly to
enjoy singing.
The Western Warbler [Dendroica occidentalis] is much like the
Black-throated Green Warbler, and seems to take its place from the
" Rockies " to the Pacific. It is olive greyish above, with crown and
sides of the head a clear yellow. The Western has no black line
running through the eyes like the Black-throated Green Warbler; the
breast and chin are black in both birds. The Western Warbler's song
is very sw'eet, though it consists of only two or three notes. It builds
high up in the forest trees. Unknown to us a pair had built in a tall
pine in a clearing we were making in our garden in British Columbia.
The tree was cut down, and the pretty little nest of moss and grass
was destroyed. I was thankful to find that the very next day the little
couple were very busily employed in building themselves a new
abode, where in due time a small family was safely hatched and
fledged.
The Worm-eating Warbler [Helmintherus vermivorus] is a
difficult bird to see, as it "keeps itself to itself " and has not much
song to attract a listener. It is, however, easily distinguished by its
striped pale yellowish-cream and black head, and its pale-coloured
feet. Its back is olive brown, and underneath it is cream shading to

white. These Warblers live on insects, and I suppose worms, though
I have never caught them " worming." They build on the ground,
and generally fly low, keeping to the lowest branches and undergrowth
in the woods.
Just north of El Paso, on the Rio Grande, we had (by a very
fortunate chance) a passing glimpse of a rare bird, the Painted
Flycatcher [Septophaga picta], one of the Flv-catching Warblers.
There was no mistaking its exquisitely shiny black head and crimson-
red colouring, with conspicuous white feathers in its tail which it
showed very distinctly when flying. This is more properly a Mexican
bird, but strays as far north as Arizona. The one we met was
evidently on its journey northward when we saw it about the second
week in April.
The Polyglot, or Yellow--breasted Chat [Icteria virens], is really
a Warbler and not a Chat. It is quite the largest of the Warbler
family, and is justly celebrated for its wonderful voice, which is not so
much one song, as a sort of pot-pourri like all sorts of different birds'
songs. For this reason it is sometimes called the Yellow Mocking-bird,
though the quaint medley is really its own invention. These birds
sing by moonlight, a la Nightingale. They are also said to be able
to ventriloquize. Another of their peculiarities is their curious flight,
for they sometimes " tumble " in the air like tumbler pigeons. Their
colouring is very simple, just olive-green with a yellow breast, but
their best distinguishing marks are their large size and the white
line above and below the eyes and on either side of the throat.
The Prairie Warbler [Dendroica discolor] is another pretty
little olive and yellow bird. It may be easily identified by the black
markings on its yellow sides, running up towards the throat in two
points, and also by the brick-red spots between the shoulders. This
little Warbler, unlike most of its fellows, prefers open country to the
woods. They may be seen in clearings and prairie land, among the
scrub, darting out to catch their fragile insect prey, or sitting on the
topmost twig of a bush singing rather a pretty little song. They
carefully place their nests in thorny bushes.
The Maryland Yellow-throat, or Black-mashed Warbler [Geo-
thlypis trichas] has a greenish-brown back and head and a light
yellowish throat and breast, and he wears a very distinct black mask.

Notes on a few American Warblers.
This little Warbler builds as near the ground as possible, preferring the*
very evil-smelling skunk-cabbage in which to place his nest, certainly
a safe place! He has rather a nice little song, of three or four notes,
which it is said calls "Follow me, follow mee-e." Late in the summer
I watched one rising, almost lark-like, as it sang. It has also a sharp
call, or warning note.
The Black-throated Grey Warbler [Dendroica nigrescens] is
another of the few that have hardly any yellow feathers. He is nearly
all grey, black and white, with a yellow spot in front of each eye.
He is one of the smaller Warblers, being barely five inches long. He
lives in the forests " out West," where we may see him flying about
among the tall trees, where he builds, and sings a pretty little warbling
song.
" Way down South " the Louisiana Water Thrush [Seiurus
motacilla], which is really a small Warbler, enchants us with its song.
Its colouring is certainly Thrush-like, -with wee speckled breast. In
the swampy woods near New Orleans, or inland from Pensacola and
thereabouts, its delicious clear, high voice may be heard. This
Warbler nearly always builds its nest in some inaccessible place, over
water, in the low fork of tree, or upturned root. In summer they
come further North, even to the range of the Northern Water Thrush,
which there takes its place.
The Northern Water Thrush [Seiurus noveboracensis] is also a
Wood Warbler. It is a little smaller than the Louisiana Water Thrush,
and its voice is not quite so varied and clear, yet I have listened with
delight to the sweet trills, a sort of series of sharp, clear notes. This
Warbler has also very much the colouring of the common Thrush of
Europe, in fact it looks like a miniature. They build " far from the
madding crowd " on the ground. Curiously enough, we heard them
singing in August in the woods near Livingstone, where we watched
two or three of them by a little rocky, mossy stream. I suppose
in that rather high altitude they nest later than on the lower levels.
I have seen and watched ever so many other Warblers, but it
would be tedious to enumerate them all.* Those who are interested
in these small birds will find them well worth study, should they

very interesting observations. --Ed.]

also be interesting to trace them further South, through Mexico,
Central America, and the West Indies. I have noticed several
North American birds in Cuba and elsewhere that I have again seen
in Canada, and it is always a happy incident when the little friend
is recognised. And what an exciting moment is the sight of some
rare or unexpected specimen, and how well worth a long day's

" In a former number (' Zoologist,' p. 104) is recorded an instance
of the Grey Parrot having laid eggs in this country. The circum-
stances under which this occurred are sufficiently curious, and
deserving notice, but the following particulars are still more curious,
relating, as they do, to the complexion of the process of incubation
in the production of young birds, and may, I trust, prove interesting
to the readers of the ' Zoologist.' Two Grey Parrots ( Psittaciis
erithacus) were purchased in the market of Sierra Leone in 1840,
when about six months old. They were brought to England, and
then separated, one being domiciled at Hull, the other at Riccall,
near York. In February, 1842, they were united at Riccall, and in
the July following the female laid three eggs. She made no nest,
and the eggs were taken from her. They were perfectly white, and
about the size of a pigeon's egg. On June 10th, 1843, she again
commenced laying, and laid two eggs. A nest was now made for her
of flannel, and placed in a copper near the fire-place, where the old
bird sat exactly four weeks, and one bird was hatched. This bird
was reared, and is now in London. She again began laying in
November last, and produced three eggs; on these she sat four
weeks, and two birds were hatched ; one of these soon died from cold,
but the other is still living, and is a very fine bird. The cock bird
occasionally assisted the female in sitting on the eggs. I have not
had time to search for similar instances, but it is probable that some
might be found, though they are certainly matters of rare occurrence.

An ancient Cockatoo.
I have thought it best to give a complete history of the birds down to
the present time, and for the power to do so, I am indebted to the
kindness of Mr. R. Fielding, the intelligent surgeon of the place
where the fact occurred. It is strange that a second brood should
have been hatched so late in the year as November; even in birds of
our own climate, this would have been considered an extraordinary
circumstance, but how much more so in the transplanted inhabitant
of a tropical climate. The natural number of eggs appears to be
three, though in the instance to which I have alluded at the
beginning of this notice, seven are mentioned as the number. It is
probable that this mention of the fact of the Grey Parrot breeding in
this country may induce others, who have had opportunities of noting
similar instances, to give the result of their observations to the pages
of the ' Zoologist," which journal may be considered a scrap-book,
and this must be my apology for sending to its pages the above rough
and imperfect contribution to the history and habits of the Grey
Parrot. --Beverley R. Morris, M.D., York, August 26th, 1844."
I came across the above interesting record on p. 725 of the
second volume of the ' Zoologist,' published in 1844. It is possible
that this curious account of the breeding of the Grey Parrot in
captivity will be overlooked in the future, as there cannot be very
many copies of the large volume of the ' Zoologist " in our libraries ;
I therefore thought it well to bring this record into the light of the
present day. The pair of Grey Parrots must have been remarkably
tame to sit on eggs in a copper vessel placed near a fire, probably in
a kitchen, and to have brought off and reared two fine young birds.

SUGAR-BIRDS.
By Miss E. F. Chawner.
As announced in the August and September numbers of The
Aviciiltural Magazine , my Yellow-winged Sugar-birds went to nest
again soon after the death of their first family. The hen began to
sit July 17th, and the first egg hatched out July 29th, the other,
the day after. Exactly a week later their eyes opened, and they left
the nest August 13th. The younger bird died the next day, but
the other throve, was well feathered, began to feed itself August 23rd
on over-ripe banana and a little sop, and just when success seemed
assured it became ricketty, lost the use of its wings, and died on
the 31st.
This brood had the advantage of the hot spell in July, and
consequently developed faster and left the nest a full week earlier
than the first family had done. They were reared on those little
grey moths which abound in pasture at that season, with occasional
caterpillars, crane-flies, and stick-insects ; no mealworms.
The hen altered her proceedings this time and took as many
insects as her beak would hold to the nest at once instead of making
a separate journey with each item. She began to give sop as well
as insects when the young were a fortnight old, and gradually fed
them on it altogether.
She was, as before, a most devoted and careful mother, and it
certainly was not her fault that both nestlings were not fully reared;
the weather was magnificent and everything in my favour. I feel,
therefore, that there must have been mismanagement on my part.
If the parent birds live until the next nesting season comes round I
shall hope to do better ; meanwhile, if anyone will be kind enough to
point out how I went wrong I shall be extremely grateful.
[Miss Chawner deserves complete success next year, and we trust she will
have it. One does not understand how she could have done more.--E d.]

(From a letter from F. M. Isemonger, District Officer, Mbale
Uganda, September, 1915).
" . . . Gardening has taken up most of my spare time
lately ; this week I have had rose-trees and mangoes moved out of
the nurseries. One early morning my young pet Crested Crane
followed me down there, and on the way we met two huge full-
grown wild Cranes. I hid behind a tree and watched a fascinating
scene. The wild birds stalked up and circled l'ound my pet with
their gorgeous wings outstretched over it. The young one took
sundry pecks from them very meekly and then opened its beak as if
to be fed. Very curious, that, as it is long past the age when it would
be fed by its pai&apos;ents. It seemed to me almost an involuntary action,
a remembrance of the last time it was with its own kind. The three
stalked about together and fed on grass seed and grasshoppers for
some time, but, at my call, the pet left the two wild ones and came
to me. The old birds were much excited by this, but by going gently
with the pet I got within a few yards of them. The full-grown crane
has magnificent plumage and colouring--black beak, black velvet,
pompom, gold crest, slender neck of beautiful pearl grey, rich red-
brown wings streaked with white and black feathers, with two or
three feathery pure gold ones overlying the tips. A brilliant crimson
pouch adds a fine finish. About 4 ft. high, and very graceful. . . .
My pet lets the children handle him, and is generally friendly, but
shows a marked preference to me--as he should ! . . ."

In the very interesting book by Nesta FI. Webster lately
published, ' The Chevalier de Boufflers,' we find that Madame de
Sabran frequently stayed with the old Due de Nivernais at Saint-
Ouen, just outside Paris. One reads that--" Nothing more enchanting
than this country house of the Due de Nivernais can be imagined.

An outdoor aviary in the reign of Louis XVI.
distant views could be seen through vistas cut in the surrounding
trees. . . . Birds were the particular passion of the duke, and
he loved them so much that he could not bear to shut them up in
cages, so he hit upon an original device for keeping them near him.
Close to the chateau was a little wood through which a stream
wandered, and over the whole of this the duke had almost invisible
wire netting stretched, covering the tree-tops and so transforming
the wood into an immense aviary. Clumps of flowers were then
planted amongst the undergrowth, the duke's writing-table and book-
case were arranged at the foot of a tree in the middle, and lastly,
quantities of birds were turned loose inside the netting. Here the
dear old man sat peacefully at work every morning, composing verses
01 translating Latin poets, whilst the stream murmured at his side,
and countless happy warblers flew around his head and perched in
the branches above him."
One wonders whether the Chevalier de Boufflers brought the
old Due de Nivernais any birds from Senegal, of which at one period
he was governor, for we read that on his first return to France (1786)
he arrived "with the oddest presents for all his friends. There
was a Parrakeet for the Queen (Marie Antoinette) which talked
Senegalese and French with equal fluency, and had been carefully
instructed in suitable greetings for its royal owner: ' Ou est la
reine ? Je veux la voir. La voila ! ' &amp;lt; Ah ! qu' elle est belle ! Je
veux la voir toujours, toujours." Several birds died on the voyage.
The Chevalier de Boufflers in his journal told Madame de
Sabran: " I have lost a green parrot with a red head that I had
meant for Elz6ar (her son), a spoonbill for the Bishop of Laon, five
or six parrakeets ; and finally, last night I was present at the death of
a poor yellow parrot, the first that had ever been seen in Africa,
and as he was unique amongst his kind, I thought of giving him to
one who is unique amongst her kind, and who is to the human race
what the human race (meaning Madame de Sabran herself) is to
parrots." This yellow parrot must have been a Lutino.
Mis. Webster writes of these offerings as "the oddest
presents "; but aviculturists would rather call them " interesting
and welcome gifts."

"The importation of Live Birds, other than Poultry and
Game, was prohibited by a Proclamation issued on the 3rd October.
Licences to import all prohibited articles from France are issued
only by the Paris Branch of our Restricted Imports Department,
and this Branch acts on applications vises by the French Ministry

The Ministry above-mentioned, after having passed such a
communication, transmit it to the English bureau, which, if there are
no objections, will issue a licence for importation in duplicate--one
to the consignee and the other to the consignor, or exporter. This
licence, however, only touches on birds in France, and apparently
on birds of France, since the regulation runs--"Enfin, le b6n6fice des

NOTES.
A pair of Lesser White Egrets which arrived in August with
broken flight feathers have moulted and now roost on the lower
branches of some willow trees on a small island in the centre of one
of the ponds close to the house at Brinsop Court. Will they remain ?
Up till now they come for food, and are absurdly tame, and when
hungry will run along the paved paths beneath the windows if they
catch sight of one within the house: but they must be shut in when
the cold weather arrives. They look extremely picturesque when
standing at the foot of a clump of pampas grass, their snowy forms
reflected in the water. If they think any dace have been caught for
them, they will run at one's heels like dogs or poultry, and follow
anywhere. But the dace are not always forthcoming, and now as a
rule raw rabbit is their fare. They are evidently male and female,
one bird being of stouter build, which has grown his ' aigrettes,' in
other words, his dorsal plumes. It is a relief to see those feathers in
their proper place, instead of on some woman's hat.
If once various species of birds take to cheese, they are very
greedy over it. Amongst Mr. Astley's, it is eagerly eaten by two
nightingales, a Wilson's Paradise-bird, a Motmot, a Shamah, a Blue-
headed Rock-Thrush, etc.

Three British Shelduck hatched at Brinsop, although as tame
as fowls, fled away one Sunday, and were seen no more for several
weeks, when a gardener saw them flying round the house.
In the first week of October (they left in August) one was in
the goose paddock, but it rose on the wing when approached, and
once more disappeared.
The geese never go, although six Magellanic Ruddy-headed
hybrids, two Ruddy-headed, a Ross' Snow Goose and some Canadians

fly round, and feed in different meadows in the immediate vicinity.
And the Maned Geese (Australian " Wood Duck ") do likewise, but
they keep still nearer home.*
The Brazilian Motmot takes almost exactly two calendar
months to grow his two central tail-feathers, and even then the
racquets did not appear through the falling off of the webbing above
them, until about the tenth week.
Mr. Trevor-Battye writes that whilst three young Mandarin
Ducks were swimming on a pool in his grounds, a stoat suddenly
jumped off the bank almost on to them, and followed them swimming
across the water.

Lady Samuelson writes that she has been very lucky with
some of her birds. Ruficaudas had three broods, six young in the
first, three in the second (of which one bird was killed), and six in
the third. A pair of Blue-breasted Waxbills reared three young, and
there was also a brood of Gouldian Finches. Melba Finches twice
had a nest of young, but just as they were ready to fly, the parents
deserted them, or pulled the young out. Of Zebra Finches, Lady
Samuelson says she has a cloud!

unfortunately the hen bird was killed by Mr. Falkner's dingo when
she was picking up grit on a path.
Mr. Falkner adds that he managed to secure another " hen,"
but it turned out to be a cock !
Mr. George Low writes that when he was staying with a
friend on an island on Lough Erne last May, he essayed the rearing
of four Willow Warblers from the nest. They did quite well on yolk
of egg and May-flies until in an evil moment he took the advice given
in a book, and added a very little milk and biscuit, with the result
that all died except one. The survivor was brought home to Kings-
town and put in a large cage, from which the little bird constantly
was allowed to come out, and would fly on to Mr. Low's book,
writing-paper, or shoulders, and was altogether fascinating. The
contents of a butterfly-net were liberated sometimes, when the Willow-
Warbler showed himself marvellously expert at catching every insect.
It happened that there was a young family of Willow Warblers in
the neighbourhood, which used to come on to the roof of the aviary
outside the window, and " Mickey " was quickly discovered. The
wild birds used to fly up, to his great annoyance, and cling to the
wire-netting with which the top of the window sash is replaced when
the window is open.
Mr. Low wanted a wild male, so he cut a small square in the
netting, and supported a small door with a piece of stick and cord
attached.
Sitting in his arm-chair, he very soon caught two of the
Willow Warblers. The sequel made him wish he had left them at
liberty, The two wild-caught birds looked happy in the aviary for
about two months, catching every insect that made its appearance,
but they also apparently partook too freely of the biscuit portion of
the insectile food and died from fatty degeneration of the liver,
although looking outwardly in splendid condition. And poor
" Mickey," the hand-reared Willow Warbler, dropped off his perch
one night from a fit of apoplexy.
Mr. Low comes to the conclusion that tender warblers should
not be mixed with other birds, as their correct mixture of food
cannot be given.

PARROT SUFFERING FROM CRAMP

Will someone advise me as to a remedy for my rare Lesson's Amazon ?
For a month or two the bird will be apparently perfectly well, and then it is sud-
denly seized with a kind of cramp which affects the legs and feet. The legs
straighten and the bird at times is unable to grasp its perch, when it stumbles
about on the drawer of the cage, with feet partly contracted. A few hours after-
wards the attacks disappear, although some have lasted more or less for two or three
days.
I cannot induce it to eat seed, nuts, or grain. It will only feed on boiled
rice, potato, custard, and the like. The parrot comes out o his cage every day and
exercises his wings, and is apparently in good health otherwise.

By Monsieur Jean Delacour.
[Written for the ' Avicultural Magazine,' and translated from the
French.]
Although my departure for the Army dated from August,
1914, I was able that year to see something of my birds; a con-
valescence, some leave, and, above all, the chance that brought me
near home during the summer, gave me the opportunity of paying
fairly frequent visits, and to obtain fleeting glimpses of them.
I came to the conclusion that the close proximity of the
battles had no bad effect upon my birds, except that a much greater
number of eggs were unfertile, a fact which is no doubt annoying,
but not important on the whole. Considering their nearness to the
"front " during more than two years, the essential point was not so
much the increase of their numbers as the decrease. The coming
and going of aviators, their fights, the appalling bombardment in
the near neighbourhood seemed to trouble the birds very little and to
cause no damage amongst them.
The big birds continue to prosper.
Up till now an Ostrich has laid four eggs, whilst her mate has
become more and more wicked, and has several times attacked his
keeper. Neither have they suffered from the snow in which they
walked about for a fortnight at the end of the winter, only going into
their unheated shed for the night.

The Emeus laid about twenty eggs at the beginning of the
year, but the male would not incubate them.
Two young white Rheas hatched in 1915 at Draveil, near
Paris, and sent by M. Hermenier to replace the one killed by the
Germans, are now adult and in magnificent condition, and are, I
believe, male and female.
The grey Rheas have had young, but only one was reared, the
others having died owing to ruptures at their birth. One of the
adult females was killed against a tree during a sudden alarm,
which birds of this genus are very prone to, especially Rheas, at the
sight of anything strange, such as an unknown dog, a motor-car,
etc. These stupid birds begin rushing about, and continue to do so
even after the object of their alarm is out of sight, knocking them-
selves against the wire meshing, with their feathers torn out and
covered with blood, and remaining several days without eating.
These alarms are contagious, and when the Rheas begin to
rush about, the Emeus and Ostriches follow suit.
The Waders, etc., thrive.
The Sarus Cranes are separated from the other species, but
the European, Stanley, Demoiselle, and Crowned Cranes live
together amicably; and have done so for five years. The Egrets,
egretta and candidissima, have their enclosure, but have evinced no
inclination to nest. Although they never have fish to eat, they are
in perfect condition. The smaller waders, such as Ibis, Gallinules,
Ruffs and Reeves, Turnstones, Plovers, etc., keep in good health,
but the Avocets died after being three years in captivity.
There is nothing of interest to note with regard to the
waterfowl, very little reproduction and few deaths. Some are
full-winged, and only fly to escape from any danger. The Bernicle
and Maned Geese have not laid, nor yet the Ringed Teal. There is
a little company of Falcated Duck on the water, which give a fine
effect.
The gallinaceous birds are numerous ; the most interesting
amongst those that have bred being the Monauls, Soemmering's',
and Mikado x Elliot's Pheasants.
A male Elliot's Pheasant mated with a Reeves; but, unfortu-
nately, the one young bird died when a month old.

Notes on my birds at Villers-Bretonneux in 1916. 71
The Doves have not been very successful in their breeding,
sharing, as they do for the most part the pheasants' avaries, and
not having the necessary privacy and quiet.
Many are still unmated, owing to the German invasion in
1914 ; Bleeding-hearts, Crested Doves, Smith's Bronzewings, Green-
winged Doves, etc., etc., of which only one sex remains. Certain
species have been put together, from which perhaps some curious
.hybrids may be produced.
The Crowned and Victoria Crowned Pigeons, as well as the
Nicobar, have not nested. Columba speciosa (Fair Pigeon) continues
to rear a numerous progeny with its mate, G. maculosa.
The Ked-crowned Pigeons (Pigeon hollandais) are in magni-
ficent condition, but always unsociable. These are beautiful birds,
and very robust, provided they have access to an open-air flight.
They have thrived now for three years upon rice boiled in milk,
bananas, and crushed hemp-seed.
The Macaws and Cockatoos are in the open air from April
till November, and live in a friendly manner, except for a few harm-
less disputes. The Macaws stand cold nights admirably and long
rainy days without shelter. The Cockatoos--Leadbeater's, Goffin's,
and Rosy--do not mind the winter.
Buffon's Touracos have reared a young one under the same
conditions as in 1915, after having destroyed their first clutch
of eggs, and as I write (October, 1916), a third clutch has been laid.
The 1915 bird equals its parents in beauty, but it is still difficult
to distinguish its sex.
The Toucans have lived for more than three years, and are in
fine plumage ; they do not leave their large compartment in the
heated corridor.
The five species which I possess have all the same habits, and
are very tame and amusing.
These birds are not infrequently ailing, remaining for several
days without eating, and their feathers ruffled, having no power to
hold on to the perches.
Other species of birds would succumb under such circum-
stances, but the Toucans, on the contrary, recover after a few days,
so that I am not very anxious when it is reported to me that one is ill.

Various birds, such as foreign Thrushes, Jays, etc., live well;
out of doors in summer, indoors in winter.
Troupials decidedly thrive better under such circumstances.
The Shamahs and the White-crested Garrulax stand out amongst
all the other birds as admirable songers. The Grackles, especially
the larger species from Java, are very entertaining with their curious
and quaint cries and imitations. In the course of last year I lost
individuals of that family, such as Trochalopteron rufigularis,
Ghimarrhornis leucocephcila, Myaclestes obscurus, Garrulax albi-
gularis.
Of the seed-eating Passerine birds, there is nothing to record,,
except that they thrive and breed regularly.
The Weavers remain out of doors, and have done so for two
years, enduring great cold in spite of their Senegalese origin.
The various Tanagers are kept indoors; they are fed, as are
the Sugar-birds, on Savoy biscuit, fruit, and the mixture given to the
Sunbirds, namely, honey, Nestle's milk, and Mellin's food, in water.
It is the only way of warding off illnesses which so often
attack them.
The Sugar-birds are fed exclusively on the liquid food. Sun-
birds live well on this mixture, with the addition of small insects
seldom partaking of fruit.
I have six species at Yillers-Bretonneux, namely, Nectarinia
famosa, Cinnyris chalybeus, C. amethystinus, Arachnechthra zeylonica,
A. asiatica and CEthopyga saturata.
This latter Sunbird, unlike the others, is fond of banana. It
seems to me indispensable to keep these birds in separate cages, or
they will sooner or later kill one another. It is also necessary to
keep clean paper (or blotting-paper) on the trays of the cages.
A few words as to the Paradise-birds. Alas, they only number
three specimens : an immature male of the Greater Paradise-bird
(Paradisea apoda ), and two males, one adult, the other approaching
that stage, of Wilson's ( Schlegelia wilsoni).
The Greater Paradise-bird is still fawn-coloured, with the head
of a deeper tint, the eyes yellow, the bill white. He is not yet
brilliant in appearance, but one is able to see how magnificent he will
be later on. His menu consists of insectile mixture, fruits, and a

certain number of mealworms. Banana he does not appreciate, but
captures a great many insects. He is a very wild bird.
The Wilson's Paradise-birds each occupy a roomy compart-
ment in the heated corridor. A most lovely species, with the brilliant
blue skin on the crown of the head, the yellow "rutile " at the back
of the neck, the back of a bright Venetian red, and the frontal shield
of shining and deep green with violet-brown reflexions, the blue
legs and feet, and above all the two curious crossed wire-like plumes
of the. tail, which curve round and almost touch the ends of the wings.
These birds are very tame, and take insects, etc., from the
fingers. They are fed on the same diet as the Greater Bird of
Paradise.
These, along with the Sunbirds, came to me from the collec-
tion of the Marquis de Segur, which he had in Paris.
In conclusion, I would write a few words aboat the Motmot4
This bird, a relative of the Rollers, is most amusingly tame, his red,
eyes and his serrated bill giving him an unusal appearance, which, in
addition to his short legs and small feet and his long racqueted tail,
never fail to attract visitors to my birds. I have not been able to
study the moult of the Motmot, but I am inclined to believe that the
racquets form after the two tail feathers are grown, on which they
appear.

Monsieur Delacour had 1345 birds, representing 344 species,
up to June, 1916.
M. Delacour wrote (October, 1916) that Field Marshal
Sir Douglas Haig and several French generals had lately been to
see his collection of birds, and that he had received unwelcome
visitors in the shape of German shells.

[By kind permission of the Editor of ' Country Life.']
At half-past seven on Easter Sunday the air-scout on the look
out for hostile aircraft called me out to see the first Swallow. The
jolly little beggar was hawking about over the guns catching insects
in the most natural manner in the world. Although every now and
then a gun boomed out its deadly message, the Swallow did not
appear at all alarmed by the noise. High overhead our aeroplanes
were flying, looking like somewhat larger birds against the perfectly
blue sky. Every now and then the shots from the German anti-
aircraft guns burst in little clouds of white smoke until the aeroplanes
appeared at times surrounded by small clouds or balls of fluffy
down.
Later in the day a service was held within a hundred yards
of our position, and the Swallows skimmed backwards and forwards
apparently unconcerned with the strange scene, and intent on
gathering insects. I think, perhaps, some of us felt that the
Swallows were messages from the dear homeland, and watched them
wheeling and darting overhead while the chaplain intoned the

H. Thoburn-Clabke,
prayers to the sharp, insistent boom of the guns and the whistle of
the bursting shrapnel from the " guns the foe were sullenly firing."
A scene to live in one's memory for ever.
The next day the Swallows and House Martins had arrived in
full force, and were twittering and circling round the eaves, flying
in and out of the ruined houses and barns. Although the surge of
battle had ebbed and flowed round these buildings and the whole
aspect of the place had materially changed since the Swallows and
Martins had left France and Flanders in the autumn, the change did
not trouble them in the least. At one ruin I noticed them flying
joyously in and out of a great shell hole, and later on I saw several
pairs of Martins hurriedly nest building on the walls of a drawing-
room, the ceiling of which had been swept away with the exception of
a handsomely moulded cornice. No doubt this, to their mind, repre-
sented an ideal kind of eave. But it seemed strange to see the nests
plastered above a fat baby Cupid, very pink and rosy, nestling among
flowers, and entwined with true-lover's knots of blue ribbon painted
on the panelled walls of a room where once stately dames and their
friends had held high revel. The Martins twittered happily, adding
tiny lumps of mud to the fast building nest, unheeding the associa-
tions of their surroundings.
The roads were very dry and dusty at the time, and the
Martins would fly down to the clay near the horse troughs and
wait until some water was spilt upon the ground ; then they would
gather mouth and throat full of the softened mud and fly back to
their nests. The mode of adding the mouthfuls was for the Martin
to cling to the wall, the tail acting as a prop to hold it in position.
Then, working the beautiful white throat, the bird appeared to mix
the saliva and mud, and then eject a small quantity on to the position
selected. As soon as a ridge wide enough to perch upon had been
built, the Martin sat on this and worked at the nest from the inside.
As fast as one bird emptied its throat the other took its place, and
went on with the task. They appeared to devote all the early part
of the morning to nest building, the rest of the day to collecting
food and resting.
The Swallows built several nests on the rafter of a big out-
house which we used as a harness-room. The nests were only just

above our heads, but the Swallows slipped behind the rafters and
constructed their nests and laid their eggs quite unheeding our
presence. They would flutter about seeking insects, and often
perched for a long time on the telephone wires. They looked very
quaint trying to keep their balance in a high wind with their tails
and wings being jerked into all sorts of absurd angles by the
strength of the gale.
Both the hen and male birds appeared to share the trouble
of sitting. Sometimes the House Martin in possession of the nest
would put out a head and tweet as if annoyed that the mate did not
relieve it. They did not appear to feed each other, but would take
short turns in sitting. When the young were hatched both parent
birds seemed to devote the whole time to feeding the little ones.
The yoimg were the most voracious creatures I ever saw. They
would shriek with anxiety when they heard the beat of the returning
bird's wing, and one would hang half out of the nest to prevent his
brothers and sisters getting anything. The feeding went on from
early dawn until almost too dark to see, and even then the youngsters
demanded more with peevish cries and squeaks.
Once the Germans shelled our position for an hour and a half
We retreated to some cellars which had been sandbagged aud waited
there until the bombardment stopped. The place was struck several
times, and one shell dropped into the cellars, but failed to explode,
and did no damage to anyone. When the " strafing " was all over we
found that one shot had taken off the greater part of the stable roof,,
the second had hit the end of the outhouse and demolished part of
the wall. The Swallows apparently did not care, for they were not
in the least perturbed by the noise of the shelling, and continued
feeding their young ones as if nothing had happened. Before the
day was over they were using the shell hole as a convenient entrance
through which to pass backwards and forwards with food for their
young.
When the young ones were old enough to leave their nests, we
were astonished to find that each nest had contained five birds that
appeared quite as large as their parents, except that they had no
tails; these, however, grew at an extraordinary rate, until they soon
\0x25A0\0x25A0equalled the parents' forked ones. All the birds that lived on the

same rafter associated together, and for some days ten very forlorn
little birds sat in a humped-up looking mass on a length of telephono
stretched between the farmhouse and the harness-room. The parents
would coax them into trying their wings, but if one strayed from the
flock the old bird would anxiously convey him back again. At last
the whole crowd found a convenient stone ledge under the eaves of
the farmhouse, and here they spent their days sunning themselves
and twittering joyously. The parent birds fed them for three weeks,
and every night escorted them back to the rafter in the harness-room.
They made a pretty picture sitting in a row on the rafter, and one
regretted that a camera was forbidden at the front. I should have
dearly loved to snap the row of white-throated heads peeping down
at us. The Martins seemed to disperse as soon as they were old
enough to leave the nests, but these Swallows kept together for some
weeks.
Our battery was continually moving about, coming and going
between various places, and at one of our stopping-places a pair of
Swallows calmly appropriated the rack on which we hung our jackets.
Needless to say, we resigned the rack to them and hung our uniforms
upon a hastily improvised rack consisting of a board with some large
nails driven into it. Unfortunately, we were ordered off on our
travels before the nest was completed, and never knew how the birds
fared in their home-making. The young birds had flown before we
returned.
Swallows and House Martins are the most amiable of birds,
and live together in harmony. The youngsters of both keep together
and form flocks, which are very conservative in their habits. Twenty
young Swallows and House Martins would perch in a half-dead plum
tree in an old deserted orchard and twitter and preen themselves
joyously. Every tine day they came, and enjoyed themselves
happily ; but when it was very wet they deserted the plum tree and
spent their time hawking and hunting under a Noah's Ark row of
limes that bordered the river.
They were particularly fond of darting to and fro under and
over the horses' lines situated beneath the trees. One terribly wet
day in August, 1915, I noticed this particularly. Evidently they
were collecting for migration, for there were hundreds flying about

the old church and ruined houses. Towards nightfall the rain came
down in torrents, and the horses turned their hacks to the storm as
usual and hung down their heads. The House Martins and Swallows
flew backwards and forwards, round and round, now over, now under
the horses, then out over the river and back again, sometimes in the
trees, but generally skimming just over the horses' backs. It
resembled nothing so much as a swarm of huge bees buzzing about
in swarming time in an old-fashioned cottage garden. September 4th
was another day when I noticed an even larger number of Swallows
and House Martins. It was equally wet, and the birds were just as
busy, but in addition they were hanging thick as beads on the
telephone wires along the communication trenches. I did not see
the final act of the migration, for as usual we were moved on, and
our next position did not happen to be near a river, which, I think,
is always the Swallows' gathering place when collecting for their
flight.
The Swifts appear to have a mortal antipathy to both Swallows
and House Martins. At one of our positions we saw nothing but
Swifts. They built in the ruins of a tall factory and other tall
structures more or less ruined, and in the evening their weird screams
sounded strangely appropriate when accompanied by the moan of a
shell. The House Martins had built some nests under the eaves ef
a ruined house, and were enjoying their simple lives when the Swifts
arrived. The latter gave them no peace. Morning, noon, and night
they harried the unfortunate Martins, whirling, circling, and shrieking
fiendishly close to their nests. Eventually the little Martins deserted
their nests and departed for another place where Swifts were fewer,
and their lives could be lived free from sudden wild alarms and
screeching enemies.
The next gun position we took up had no Swifts, consequently
the Swallows and Martins were very numerous ; yet on the evening
of August 26th, just as it grew dusk, I saw thousands of Swifts
going over, evidently migrating. They were flying leisurely, as if
taking their time about it, and not in the least disturbed by the
sound of battle all around and below them. I could not help
wondering whether they had come from England ; if so, they must
have occupied some days in travelling the distance, as the Swifts-

generally leave Westmorland punctually on August 12th or 13th.
There is something so sinister about the Swift, with his weird, ear-
piercing cry, his everlasting swooping, whirling and hawking, that he
has never appealed to me. His very blackness seems to suit his
character of eternal restlessness, and he well deserves his North
Country name of " devilling." There is nothing friendly about his
nature, and as he and his companions flew over our lines I did not
regret his departure, but turned to watch seven Swallows and Martins
hurriedly catching a supper of gnats before they went to their
perches.
Living close to the heart of nature--although a torn and
battle-scarred heart--one finds that a lot of preconceived ideas about
the wild creatures have to go. Very few birds go to bed until they
are forced to by the waning light. The Swallows and Martins feed
until it is too dark to see. The Plover fly long after dark, while on
vividly moonlight nights the birds are very restless and are ahvays
waking. Gulls in particular are always moving, so are many kinds
-of wildfowl.
The idea that gun-fire would chase away the birds has been
quite exploded, and the pathetic story of the Swallows and Martins
wheeling around the ruins of their last year's home, tweeting miser-
ably and then departing from the battle area of ruined towns and
villages is quite untrue. Personally, I think the Swallows and
Martins prefer the ruins. The vast quantity of insects which the
life on the battlefield encourages provides them with plenty of food
and accounts for the fact that Swallows and Martins are far more
plentiful than they were during pre-war days.
Many districts in England are said to have fewer Swallows
and Martins this year than ever before,* so probably the home-coming
birds, finding a good supply of food on the front, lingered somewhere
in France and Belgium instead of continuing their journey across the
Channel. During one of the battles on the Somme the Germans
shelled a small wood. One shell struck the trunk of a tree in which
a large number of Martins and Swallows were perching. The
tree slowly bowed, and the birds went up with the cloud of smoke as

it fell. It was only when the birds scattered that one realised that
they were not bits of shrapnel, yet, after flying about for a few
minutes, they settled down on another tree, preened their plumage
and twittered as if nothing unusual had happened. No doubt,
having been hatched and reared amid the surroundings of battle,
they would think it strange if the incessant clash and clang were
silent, and the country once more assumed its ancient aspect of
peace and calm. Certainly they would miss the vast quantities
of insects which the battle has attracted, and which must be an.
ever abiding joy to the insect-eating birds.

OUR BRITISH SWALLOWS.
By Dr. Arthur G. Butler.
Although one Swallow does not make a summer, there can be
no lover of nature who does not hail with delight the first appearance
of these graceful birds on our shores. The first to arrive, either at
the end of March or beginning of April, is the Sand-Martin, the
smallest and least brightly coloured of the three ; the Chimney-
Swallow follows almost immediately, and then the House-Martin.
[I saw Swifts last year before the House Martins, on the 27th of
April, but this date was an early one. --Ed.] Even in our uncertain
climate we then begin to hope that the winter of our discontent is
really passing away.
Undoubtedly the most gracefully formed and beautifully
coloured species is the Chimney-Swallow (Hirunclo rustica) ; it is
also by far the best songster, although it is probable that many of our
members have never heard its song, but have supposed it to be
represented by the calls with which Swallows greet one another on
the wing. In my experience, the Swallow only sings when roosting,
either on telegraph-wire^ or the cross-beams of an open building, and,
as I have stated elsewhere, its song is, in my opinion, far more
melodious than that of our Linnet.
I have never heard songs worthy to be so called from either
of the Martins ; they twitter when on the wing indeed, and possibly

Dr. Arthur G. Butler,
they may be capable of something more, though I have not been
lucky enough to hear it, nor have I met with any record of such a
thing, and examples which I reared from the nest never made the
least attempt to sing. :;: Now, it has often been incorrectly asserted
that brightly-coloured birds are not gifted with song, but here we
have one of many proofs to the contrary; perhaps the most striking
one, however, is that of the gorgeously-coloured King Bird of
Paradise, of which Sir William Ingram writes Ibis,' 1907, p. 227) :
" Now he hursts out into his beautiful melodious warbling song, so
enchanting to hear, hut so difficult to describe."
Often repeated misstatements are not readily accepted as such,
though their fallacy may be frequently pointed out; it is just as
absurd to take it for granted, because the Nightingale is a prince of
songsters and of modest colouring, that only dull-coloured birds are
similarly gifted, as to assume that only the least attractive flowers
have sweet scents ; and is as foolish as the frequently uttered asser-
tion that there are no singing birds in Australia. Let those who make
this statement repeat that to their ornithological cousin the Lyre-
bird.
Well, all this has taken us away from the Swallows, but
it may possibly have its use in opening blind eyes and deaf ears;
listen to the Blackbird and compare its splendid song with the
somewhat tiresome though cheerful repetitions of the far less showy
Song-Thrush ; just ask yourself whether he is not in all respects,
both of colour and form, a far more beautiful bird, as well as an
infinitely superior performer; but one could multiply instances of
brightly coloured musicians to almost any extent among foreign birds.
Swallows love warmth, and therefore, like sensible creatures,
they leave us at the approach of winter. In exceptionally warm
winters they may sometimes be seen quite late in the year, but it may
be that only a late brood thus ventures. As a rule, the end of
September or October sees their departure to a more genial climate;
I will revert to this point later on. Hand-reared birds delight
to nestle down in&apos; one's hand, and do not object to being stroked.
They are affectionate, and would make ideal pets if one could assure

the Swallow's.--E d.]

them plenty of exercise and small living insect-food ; but a Swallow
in a cage is to me a pitiable object, and a bird of this kind fed upon
soft food gorges itself to repletion and soon dies.
It has been said, and even by good ornithologists, that these
birds cannot walk on account of the shortness of their legs, and that
they cannot rise from the ground because of the length of their wings.
I used to start my House-Martins running races across the floor of a
room and they travelled at a surprising speed, sometimes using their
wings in leaps. On a perfectly level, smooth surface Swallows
undoubtedly find themselves in difficulties as regards flight, but a
sloping surface or an inequality of a very few inches provides a
sufficient take off from which they can rise in the air. If this were
not so the Chimney-Swallows and House-Martins which I have
observed obtaining mud for their nests round country ponds would
indeed have been in an unhappy predicament.
I have often wondered why the House-Martin does not follow
the excellent example of the Chimney-Swallow and mix dry grass or
fibre with the mud, and thus strengthen the walls of its nest. It is
quite easy to secure perfect nests of the Chimney-Swallow for a
collection. They will stand a lot of knocking about without injury;
but with the greatest care I never could get a House-Martin's nest
entire ; it fell to pieces even though carefully supported and separated
from the wall by the use of a long sharp knife. The specimens
for the exhibition case in the Natural History Museum were, I
believe, thoroughly soaked with size and allowed to harden before
removal.
So far as comfort is concerned, the Chimney-Swallow and
House-Martin seem to provide for it in their nests ; but the Sand-
Martin, although it may ensure greater warmth by burrowing far
into a bank, has to submit to the irritation caused by numerous
parasites, many of the nests being alive with fleas and ticks; the
actual nest of this bird also is flimsy in the extreme, and must need
constant rearrangement to retain its character. Nevertheless, liable
as it is to be blown away if exposed to the air, a perfect Sand-Martin's
nest, with its cup of white feathers in a loose base of bents or rootlets,
is a beautiful object; but perfect nests are only to be obtained from
long burrows.

On our British Sivalloivs.
Swallows are not nervous birds ; even the Sand-Martin, though
it does not make its home amongst human beings, not infrequently
chooses a railway hank as the site for its burrows, where it must be
constantly shaken and half-deafened by the passage to and fro of
trains. On the other hand, the Swallow and House-Martin seem to
delight in the close companionship of mankind, and thus endear
themselves to all lovers of birds. Whittaker, in his ' Birds of
Tunisia,' vol. i, p. 183, observes : " In some of the Tunisian villages
I have seen Swallows nesting, and evidently quite at home, in the
smallest and most crowded houses, circling round and round the
interior of the rooms in their chase after flies, and darting in and out
through the open doorways as unconcernedly as possible. I have
myself slept in one of these rooms, with a Swallow's nest over the
head of my bed, my first thought on waking at daybreak being to
throw open the door, the only aperture the room had, in order to
release the owners of the nest."
Swallows are faithful to their mates until separated by death,
and they appear to nidificate year after year in the same localities,
even utilising the same nest if it is in good condition. I have known
the same nest of a Chimney-Swallow to he used tw r o or three years
in succession, and presumably by the same birds, since it has been
clearly proved by marking pairs that they have returned year after
year to the same hreeding-place.
The emigration of these charming visitors from our islands
begins in August, and, according to Dr. Ticehurst (' Birds of Kent,&quot;
p. 132), " it is not at all unusual for stragglers to be observed
migrating in small parties as late as the 20th of November, and I
have five or six records of single birds being seen in the county as
late as the first week in December, the latest being December the 11th
at Walmer."
The speed of these birds upon the wing is considerable, and
they appear to fly without effort. Of course, the velocity of their
flight is considerably less than that of the Common Swift, and in no
respect comparable with that of the Alpine Swift, which passes one
like a bullet from a rifle ; indeed, Jerdon, in his ' Birds of India,'
says of it: "I saw, on several occasions, large flocks of them flying
eastward towards the sea from the rocky hills near Madura about

sunset. On another occasion I saw, at mid-clay, an enormous flock
of them flying eastward from the same range, a little south of
Madura ; these, however, were probably merely taking their ordinary
rounds of a few hundred miles, but the others flying seaward at
sunset--where were they bound for ?" Well, Swifts have nothing in
common with Swallows excepting similarity in appearance, flight, and
manner of feeding. I noted recently that an aviator had chased a
Swallow successfully until the unlucky bird was killed by striking
against one of the stays of his machine; therefore it is probable that
some aeroplanes can attain to a greater speed than Swallows.

A complete list of coloured plates of any group of birds would
be a most useful compilation, and that which follows is meant as an
essay towards this goal as far as the Parrots are concerned. It con-
tains all the references of plates to these birds which I have come
across, but of course is by no means a complete list; for instance, I
know of no plates of such birds as the Tovi Parrakeet, the Black-
headed Caique, or any of the Eclecti,* all comparatively well-known
species, which, I feel sure, must have been illustrated somewhere. I,
however, put it forward, incomplete as it is, in the hope that readers
who are able or who have the opportunity will help to fill the gaps
and correct the errors by writing to me, or better, to the Magazine,

so that communication is sometimes uncertain and always delayed.
With such help I may hope that one day a really complete and
up-to-date list will be forthcoming.
It will be noticed that no reference is made to the beautiful
plates in Matthew's ' Birds of Australia,' but this (and other recent
books) I have not yet had the opportunity of seeing. (Here is a big
gap which can be surely filled at once.--E. H.)

Dr. E. Hopkinson,
I must also point out that, although each entry refers to a
coloured illustration, it does not always mean " coloured plate " in
the best sense. One cannot expect, in the coloured steel engravings
of the earlier works or in the chromos and coloured prints of popular
books, the excellence and life-like accuracy of sumptuous mono-
graphs or other more modern hooks. However, each illustration
referred to is (as far as I know), within its limits, a good representa-
tion of its subject.
The abbreviations are, in most cases, obvious, but the following
need perhaps explanation :
The sign /. means " teste," " on the authority of."

By Pte. A. Silver.
A London dealer received in 1914 among other birds a small
consignment of Combasous. These were disposed of as Long-tailed
Combasous (F hypoclierina), but of those that lived none of the males
assumed other than a dark plumage, and no tail shafts appeared.
From a friend I purchased later a male out of colour, and when it

Hypochera ultramarina.
again assumed full plumage I had no difficulty in assuring myself
that it was an Ultramarine Finch or Combasou.
Previous to this I, with many others, had imagined we had
had Ultramarine Combasous, but they were only very fine Common
Combasous ( H. chalybeata ) exhibiting bluish rather than greenish
sheen on their black plumage,
H. ultramarina * stands well away and quite distinct from
the commoner species in having a bright coral red bill and feet,
whereas the bill of the latter, as everyone knows, is silvery white.
My bird assumed absolutely rich black plumage with the brightest
of Prussian blue reflections; in fact, resembled a miniature Chough
built on Finch lines.
When out of colour these birds are browner than Common
Combasous, more distinctly streaked, and in the case of the females
thev were less distinctly marked on the cheek area. In size the
birds are larger and longer in the body than their commoner relative.
The male sang more sw'eetly and repeatedly than males of R. chaly-
beata that tenanted the same quarters, and flew about a great deal
when at its full season. Selected examples of both species side by side
make a nice contrast, and, as they resemble each other in general
habit, for comparatively plain birds they are equally charming and
hardy.
I noticed that my bird ate white millet in preference to any
other seed, refused canary seed, and seldom touched French or
so-called Indian millet. Spray millet w T as eaten on occasions and
mealworms less so than in the case of the common Combasou. I
kept the bird for about a year, exhibited it successfully on several
occasions, and finally disposed of it to a lady member. I understand
that it is a pretty common bird in its own country, and its range
there extends from the Gold Coast to the Niger, and also to N.
Tropical Africa to about 23 deg. N. lat. Of late years I have seen
many hundreds of birds arrive from Senegal and neighbouring
districts, but among batches of birds in the general trade I have not
seen a single example of the species among the other Combasous.
Unless a glut of such birds came to hand I should never miss the
i. e. the males.

opportunity of acquiring the species when it appeared at a reasonable

TWO HANGNESTS AND A TROUPIAL.
By Pte. A. Silver.
Somewhere about the middle of 1914 a batch of New World
birds were offered in London, and among this consignment I
discovered a mixed lot of Hangnests. There were one or two young
Bullock's, some adult and immature Wagler's, and other oddments
more or less dirty, but sound in constitution, although thin.
I picked out the best Bullock's and an old male Wagler's, and
on arriving home caged them separately, and treated both as per my
usual manner with new arrivals.
They both tried their best to become clean and respectable,
but owing to the adhesive quality of the birdlime that had originally
caused their downfall their labours were in vain. This trouble,
however, was soon surmounted, and they " passed the doctor "
successfully within the next forty-eight hours. With regard to
Bullock's Hangnest, I found it resembled in most ways I. baltimore ,
a very charming species that of late years has not been obtainable in
so far as I have been concerned. I fed on a good insectivorous bird
food, plus game meal damped with grated carrot, and gave also fruit,
berries, and live food, and moulted the bird in full beauty and health
the succeeding season. As a Hangnest I liked the bird as well as
any, and on account of its small size found it more dainty in move-
ment than many of its relations. Although whilst with me it
remained in tip-top health, I found that banana caused it to quickly
become more fat than was requisite, and so latterly, to maintain fine
fettle and prevent too docile a manner, I discontinued its use. The
same experience held good in the treatment of I. baltimore. After
retaining the bird sufficiently long to know it pretty well I exhibited
it on several occasions and disposed of it. Bullock's Hangnest in
summer may be found in Western North America, and otherwise to
South and Central Mexico.

Two Hangnests and a Troupial.
Concerning Wagler's, I found that my bird would have
been less wild had it been an immature specimen when first
caged. I followed up several of the other specimens which
were in olive plumage when first acquired, and they were all
less mistrustful of humans than my bird. The birds mentioned, with
other adult birds, moulted out wretchedly pale, and bore little
resemblance to the genuine article. My own bird I, of course, allowed
a proper ration of tasteless pepper fruit, and it retained its full beauty
after moulting. In an aviary it makes a handsome active species,
and its rich cadmium hues contrast well with the shiny black con-
stituting the other part of its colouring. Both these birds were shy
singers, but the last-mentioned species, whenever people were in
sight, continually uttered a " clacking " call.
The bird was fed similarly to the Bullock's, and could eat an
unlimited supply of banana; but, like all other birds, varied its con-
sumption of this, that, or the other item according to season.
Young birds of both sexes in this species seem to be olive
above and yellowish beneath, black feathers poking through in due
course. It hails from Mexico and Guatemala, and I have read that
it does not acquire a full plumage until the third year. I am inclined
to doubt this, because the young birds of the consignment appeared
to be birds of the year, and acquired to all intents and purposes full
plumage after the succeeding mouit.
With regard to the Troupial, it was one of three Glossy Black
Troupials privately imported. A " quiscaline " bird revelling in the
name of Dives atroviolaceus, it proved anything but charming. I
think my friend Mr. Frank Finn remarked that it was anything but
" rich." True, it possessed a cat-call, and when alarmed behaved
like a sitting Wryneck, but for a black bird w r as not a patch on a
Silky Cow-bird as a cage bird. In addition to sparingly eating soft
food, it partook of canary-seed and sunflower-seed, but almost on
all occasions ignored fruit. Clothed in black, nothing relieved its
general aspect except a pair of staring white irides, and although it
could be safely described as a rare bird on the market, I should not
weep if Cuba sends us no more.

A BIBLIOGRAPHY OF BRITISH ORNITHOLOGY.
Mullens and Swann.
[A Bibliography of British Ornithology, from the Earliest limes to the end of
1912. I3j W. H. Mullens, M.A., etc., and H. Kirke Swann.
Macmillan &amp; Co., Ltd., St. Martin's Street, London, 1916.
Four parts of this publication have been issued, each at 6s.
net, and it will, when completed, be a most useful book of reference,
including, as it does, the biographical accounts of the principal
writers and bibliographies of their published works.
One learns many interesting facts as to the authors. Taking
for instance, under " M," we find that Meyer, after whom Meyers
Parrot was named, was not of that nation which has proved itself to
be the foulest fighter in the history of the civilised world, but of
Dutch extraction, his father having been several times Member for
North Holland, coming to England after the establishment of Louis
Napoleon's Kingdom in the Low Countries, so that his son lived in
England and married an Englishwoman, By one who knew him, he
is described as " an artist by profession and a great naturalist." The
second issue of his ' Coloured Illustrations of British Birds, on large
paper, is of the utmost rarity. In the library at Welbeck Abbey
there is one of these which contains a memorandum in Meyer's
handwriting.
In the biographical record of Morris [Rev. Francis Orpen]
we read that he has a name and place in British ornithological
history, despite the fact that the authors maintain that Morris
' British Birds ' " never occupied any very important position
among such works, and that " he accepted records and statements
without discrimination, and consequently his work abounds in errors
and mistakes." For all that, he must have been a hard worker.
For those who collect publications on British ornithology this
work is a valuable one for reference upon the subject.

Stick Insects (Carausins morosus).
BRITISH BIRDS. Thorburn.
British Birds, written and illustrated by A. Thorburn, F.Z.S. With 80 Plates
in colour, showing over 400 species. In four vols. Vol. IV. Price #6 6s.
Longmans, Green &amp; Co., 39, Paternoster How, London.
Gulls, Plovers, waders, and sea-birds chiefly make up the
fourth and final volume of Mr. Thorburn's beautiful work, to which
we have before now drawn the attention of members. The artist
excels in delineating and painting the portraits of sea and shore
birds, so that one finds many charming and beautiful pictures which
form a natural grouping of those birds which associate together in a
wild state at certain seasons of the year, such as Terns in one plate,
Dunlins and Sandpipers in another, and Gulls in another.
It is perhaps a pity that the figure of the European Crane
could not have been a solitary one, as it seems somewhat out of
place with a Stone-Curlew and two species of Bustards in the back-
ground.
Plates 72, 74, and 76 are especially attractive, Gulls of
various species figuring in the first two, and Puffins, Razorbills, etc.,
in the third; hut the whole of this volume is made up of good work
and clever colouring.

Dear Mr. Astley,
I am surprised that you could not get information at the
Zoological Gardens respecting the insects that M. Delacour wrote
about. * The Field ' published some time ago a note from the London
Zoological Gardens stating that stick-insects had been given for food
not only to the birds, hut also to some insectivorous mammals, such
as Marmosets, which had relished this addition to their fare.
Now, Carausins morosus are orthopterous insects, not beetles,
and they have been the object of the careful study of one of the
members of the Societe d'Acclimatation, namely, the Abbe Foucher,
who has bred enormous quantities ( Carausins and Cyphocrania) and
also leaf-insects in his insectarium. These studies have been

published in the 'Bulletin de la Societe d'Acclimatation,' and have now
been put into book form, with many illustrations (' Etudes biologiques
sur quelques Orthopteres.' Paris, 1916).
Caurausius was obtained by the Abbe Foucher in 1913 from
Mr. Morton, of Lausanne, but only females, but they have multiplied
to such an extent by parthenogenesis that he was obliged to let
loose a quantity in the garden of the Catholic University, where they
settled in the ivy covering the walls. And here I must signalise a
most striking case of the utter futility of the theory of protective
forms, etc. Sticks as the insects looked, the Blackbirds and the
Sparrows were not long in finding out that they were eatable, and
fell to work on them as their daily fare.
In the preface which Prof. Perrier has written for the Abbe
Foucher's book lie remarks that stick-insects appeared on the earth
at a very remote period. Titanophasma, for instance, was in exist-
ence when the surface of our globe was only just clothed with vege-
tation of some kind, so that resemblance to sticks could not be of
any protective value to the orthopterous ancestor.
Must we not, therefore, ascribe tbe stick form to some general
influence which dominated equally plant and animal life?
I might add that the Abbe Foucher has at last obtained a
male specimen by putting some females on very short rations, as has
already been done in breeding butterflies from caterpillars.
Male or no male, the multiplication of Carausius is very great,
and growth so rapid that stick-insects will no doubt afford a very
timely substitute to aviculturists for the mealworms, of which so
large a number were imported before the war from the farms in
Germany.

Dtcar Mr. Astley,-- You will be interested to hear that we have bred Fal-
cated Duck this year. We have two tine drakes and one duck, possibly two. We
thought they were Gadwall at first, and our surprise was considerable when the
male suddenly assumed his characteristic plumage.
We have two birds (a pair) in our pens, the others are with the parents on the
lake, and that is why I cannot be certain about the female birds.
Yours sincerely, Arthur W. Hill.
P.S.--I bought two pairs a few years ago and had them on the pond by the
Museum. Both pairs made their way to the lake and one pair flew away about one
and a half years ago, not being properly pinioned. If this is worth noting in the
Magazine, pray make use of it.

RHEUMATISM IN PARROT'S LEG.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.902276375" page_id="9411738"  page_num="Page 96" year="" vol="">
Dear Mr. Astley,-- I note that you are asking for suggestions for treatment
of your Parrot, which has spasmodic rigidity of the legs. To me this appears to be
due to rheumatism, and this is very likely if you have had the bird for a long time.
The condition seems analogous to the cramps in the calves of the legs, as shown in
the human subject, especially violent at night. The circulatory system requires
flushing through the kidneys, and I should recommend giving an extra gill or so
of water every day : the bird might be induced to take this quantity by adding a little
salt to the ordinary drinking water. This will induce thirst, so after it seems to
have taken enough owing to repeated drinking the last portion being unsalted
would allow its thirst to be quenched.
I was very delighted to note the continued excellence of the Magazine in
spite of the war. I enclose two papers, which perhaps you can use. For a very
long time I have wished to send you something, but have been detained. I have
further papers in contemplation.
I am yours faithfully,

By Miss E. F. Chawner.
Last July Mr. Cross sent me a fine specimen of this Owl, now
not often imported to this country, though formerly (teste Mr. Meade-
Waldo) often represented in the Zoological Gardens of London,
where it was called the Downy Owl. This, I venture to say, does
not well describe it, for several other species have a more downy
appearance than this rather close-feathered bird.
The same authority says that it is " widely spread over
Central and Northern South America, and thus is a purely tropical
Owl." It has the reputation of being a tame species, which my
bird fully bears out. The day after his arrival he sidled along his
perch and held his head down as a parrot does when inviting a
friend " to scratch a poll," and with the same object, for nothing
gives him greater pleasure than to have his head scratched by hand
or with a bit of stick. He is absolutely fearless, and very gentle,
and has evidently been much petted. When he reached here he was
in good plumage, only a few of the flight feathers rubbed and broken,
but his first wash showed that he had a good deal of dirt to get rid
of; he uses his bath freely, and has a curious habit, which I have
not noticed in my other Owls, of dipping his face into water after
feeding. His voice is gruff, something between a growl and a hoarse
chuckle; combined with his oddly-marked face and big, yellow,

Mr. W. E. Teschemaker,
black-pupilled eyes the effect is rather startling, and makes one feel
that his name " Bogey " is well bestowed.
The photograph gives such a good idea of his appearance that
I need only say that his back is not really black, hut the shade
known as tete de ncgre, and his breast and under parts are tan. He
was annoyed at being made to pose when he wanted his head
scratched, and would not stand up, so the photograph does not do
justice to his height; he stands rather higher than the Tawny Owl,
but I think he is a larger bird. His diet is the same as that of my
other Owls.
So far he seems to stand our climate well, hut, being a native
of the tropics, he will need watching during this hard winter.

AVICULTURE.
By W. E. Teschemaker.
So long a time has elapsed since I last contributed to the
Magazine that it may perhaps be advisable to explain why I have
accepted the Editor's invitation to write something, and, in particular,
why I have selected the above subject. I have both a private and a
public object. I wish to show our members that I have not forgotten
them (as I hope they have not completely forgotten me), and I
always set before myself the possibility of raising aviculture from the
very restricted sphere of influence, which it at present occupies, to a
plane of greater dignity and wider outlook.
No doubt one takes a risk or two in writing of German
aviculture at a time when we are at war with Germany, but thfe
psychological moment must not be lost. The old order of things is
passing and there is a promise--or at least a possibility--of a new
world and new ideals ; so we will take the risk and hope for the best.
Aviculture and Politics.
In pursuance of the above object, I will commence with a
postulate and a protest. My postulate is that aviculture is based
</bodyText>

on the Influence of German Aviculture.

<bodyText confidence="0.992503823529412" page_id="9411743"  page_num="Page 99" year="" vol="">
on certain instincts and sympathies, which are common to the
aviculturists of all nations, and is therefore above and apart from all
considerations of race or nationality. I claim that we should regard
the aviculturists of all nations in war time as being fellow-suflerers
united by a common misfortune; for, however excellent the objects
of any war may be, it is bound to be destructive of the best interests
of aviculture.
My protest is against those (if any) who would try to thrust
this terrible war into the quiet realms of aviculture. We should not
only regard them, I think, as disturbers of the peace, but as seeking
to destroy the cosmopolitan character of aviculture and its potential
function as a link to draw all nations more closely together after the
war. One result of this conflict, which we can all foresee, will be
racial animosities more bitter and more enduring than that inspired
in the French by the loss of Alsace-Lorraine. There will be no real
peace in the world until those animosities have been extinguished by
effluxion of time and by the intercourse of nations.
Concerning Patriotism.
We have heard a great deal during the last decade in this
country of that type of patriotism which has produced a certain
national self-complacency, which, when put to the test in the keen
struggle for existence, has not been always justified by results.
Another form of patriotism, less popular but, we think, more profit-
able, is to point out what other nations are doing and to compare it
with that which we are doing, and to thus attempt to discover our
relatively strong and relatively weak points. It is this latter method
which we shall pursue to-day.
Early German Aviculture.
To understand the true inwardness of German aviculture we
must hark back to its beginnings, and here we run up against a
difficulty, namely that the beginnings of aviculture in all countries
have left no written record. We have to fall back upon the beginnings
of avicultural literature and form inferences by comparing the written
records of the same period of different nations.

Mr. W. E. Tescheiviaker,
Avicultural literature, properly so called, has been preceded in
all European countries by certain curious old works on sport and
natural history, many of which are of respectable antiquity; as, for
instance, in England, Leonard Mascall's work on Fowling, 1590, ' A

Prevention ' (Fowling), by Gervase Markham, 1655; in France,
' Histoire de la Nature des Oyseaux,' by Du Mans, 1555; ' Les
Ruses Innocentes ' (trapping migratory and non-migratory birds,

also quadrupeds), 1610 ; in Italy, ' L'Uccellatura A Vischio di Pietro
Angelio Bargeo ' (a poem on Fowling), 1568; " II Canto de Gl'
Avgellia ' (Fowling : interesting as being the foundation of Olina's
work), 1601; ' Olina's Natural History,' 1622. (The above titles have
been much abbreviated.)

A perusal of these quaint old works will convince the student
that in the sixteenth century the chief interest manifested in
European birds was a gastronomic one.
Here we find the Germans well to the fore, in Lark-catching
with their immense fiight-nets, and particularly in Thrush-catching
with " Dolmen " (hanging snares) and " Schlingen " (horse-hair
nooses). Records are still extant of the number of birds snared in
one small district in the Rhine provinces between the years 1611 and
1632, and include 7409 Redwings, 5254 Thrushes, 744 Redbreasts,
52 Redstarts, 54 Yellowhammers, 155 Chaffinches, 2674 Skylarks,
1059 Tits, 14 Waxwings, 51 Jays, etc.
Heresbachius, writing in 1537, tells us (translation) that
Thrushes " are chiefly caught in Germany in the winter. They are
cooked whole, for the insides are eaten also. They have the intestines
filled with the berries of the Juniper." William Turner in his ' New
Herbal,' 1551, also tells us that the juniper " groweth in Germany in
many places in greate plentye but in no place in greater than a lytle
from Bon, where as at the time of year the feldefares fede only of
Junipers berries, the people eate the feldefares undrawen with guttes
and all because they are full of the berries of Juniper."
I am aware that this is not a nice introduction to German
aviculture, but, for those who would understand the subject, it is a
necessary one.

Two Old German Bird-Books.
One hundred and fifty years pass, and the first work really
devoted to German aviculture, of which the writer can find any
record, appears upon the scene. It has a dreadfully long title
(N.B.: this appears to be a marked and constant characteristic of all
early bird-books!), which we will spare the reader, simply referring to
it as the ' Grundliche Anweisung,' and translating the title for his
benefit. I ask the reader, however, to particularly notice the ideals
which the German aviculturist of this early period set before himself,
as deduced from the title. " Practical directions on catching and
domesticating all sorts of birds, on distinguishing them by their sex
and other characteristics, on making them tame, and managing them,
on recognising their attractive qualities, on teaching them songs other
than their oivn, and on accustoming them to fly in and out of the
house.&quot; Authors anonymous ; date 1754.
This is a very interesting old work in several ways. We will
particularly call attention to the art and practice of teaching birds
other songs than those they have inherited from their parents--an
art which the Germans have since most carefully cultivated and
most successfully developed. It is also interesting as being the
foundation of Bechstein's later work--indeed Bechstein himself
brought out a later edition of the 'Anweisung ' in 1797.
Forty-one years pass, and Johann Matthaus Bechstein, M.D.,
presents to German aviculturists his celebrated ' Naturgeschichte
der Stubenvogel,' 1795, so well known in this country through the
medium of a translation. This translation, however, has greatly
detracted from the real value of the work. Even the title ('Natural
History of Cage-birds ') is quite incorrect. We lay special emphasis
on the fact that Stubenvogel should he translated " house-birds "
(literally " bird-room birds "), and that the author adds the definition
"those birds which one can keep in the bird-room," because we have
here the first complete and detailed description of the system of
keeping birds flying loose in a room heated by a closed stove, which
was afterwards so successfully developed by Dr. Russ and others, and
has become so distinctive of German avicultural methods.

Mr. W. E. Teschemaker,
German Aviculture in the 17th Century.
Although the writer has not been able to come across an
earlier German work on this subject than the one published in 1754,
the reader must not jump to the conclusion that German aviculture
began somewhere about this date. I have elsewhere made mention
of a much earlier English work. When I was offered this little book
one day in a secondhand book-shop in Charing Cross Road, for the
modest sum of 10s., I literally grabbed it. Its value to a collector is
more than the latter sum, and, to an aviculturist, it is simply beyond
price. Its title is (as usual!) lengthy : 'The Bird-Fancyer's Delight,
or Choice Observations and Directions concerning the Taking,
Feeding, Breeding, Curing and Teaching all sorts of Singing Birds.
Also, how to take birds with lime-twigs and to make water bird-lime.
With the Maladies and Distempers incident to Singing Birds, likewise
an Infallible Rule to know the cock from the hen ; and many other
observations relating thereto. The like not extant. London : printed
in the year 1711." (Sixty-eight words ! but the title of Brehm&apos;s
' Vogel-fang ' contains no less than 112 words !)
It consists for the most part of a series of essays on the
treatment of certain insectivorous song-birds, that on the Nightingale
being probably the most interesting and most detailed ever written
in any language.
Naturally, as an English aviculturist, I was very delighted to
find that at this early date aviculture in this country was so well
advanced, but, when I came in due course to the article on the
Canary, in the portion of the book devoted to " Hard-beak'd Birds,"
I experienced a dreadful shock. Our countrymen of that date, I
read, could not " distinguish a Canary from one of our common
Green-birds " (Green-finches). But worse was to come. Whence
came the best Canaries? "The birds brought out of Germany far
excel in hansomness and songs ; the German birds have many fine
jerks and notes of the Nightingals, which in its place I shall declare
how they came to have." The author goes on to describe a German
aviary, and German methods of breeding and training the young
birds to sing Nightingale and Pipit tours, and he concludes with this
overwhelming sentence : " This man also did truly affirm that they "

(Canaries) " never came to any perfection until they" (the Germans)
" came to have birds of their own breeding in their own country and
then, being seasoned to the country, they bred in abundance, furnishing
all Poland, Germany and France; and of late years England also
relieve they vend as many as in any -place in the world.&quot;
Some of us had imagined that the German Roller was intro-
duced by a certain chemist, named Seifert, some thirty years since.
Two hundred years before this date the Germans were supplying
trained Rollers to half Europe!!
The Parting of the Ways.
Let us note then, with pardonable pride, that (so far as the
writer's researches extend) we were able to produce in this country
an excellent and detailed work on aviculture half a century before the
Germans, and the fact that English aviculturists of that period could
keep the Wren in captivity and make the Robin whistle tunes and
talk, as related in the ' Fancyer's Delight,' shows that they were no
beginners but masters of their art. But let us also note that even at
this early date German and English aviculture had begun to follow
different lines of development. The Germans had put before them-
selves a definite idea. They had recognised the possibilities of the
Canary as a singing bird ; they had acclimatised it, taught it por-
tions of the songs of the Nightingale and Titlark, and had succeeded
in breeding it on so large a scale that they could supply trained song-
birds to half Europe. Two centuries have passed and the Germans
are still supplying trained song-birds to Europe. :!;
One naturally asks oneself why, if English aviculturists had
all the qualifications for success, they have not produced more
tangible results ? The answer is probably two-fold. In the first
place, aviculture has been pursued in this country in an aimless,
amateurish manner, without any definite object. Another, and
equally unfortunate, characteristic of English aviculture is pointed
out by the author of the ' Fancyer's Delight ' in a very suggestive
passage : " This is the Misery of most people, they breed so many
together that one spoils another.&quot; How many aviculturists one could
* fls not this because the Germans aim to make money with their Canaries, whilst
the English have kept birds for their personal pleasure?--Ed.]

Mr. W. E. Teschemaker,
name who have succumbed to the lure of the " mixed series," have
crammed their aviaries to the limit of repletion with a heterogeneous
collection of indigenous and foreign birds, and have never produced any
definite or interesting results whatever. The " misery " (pity) of it!
Eighteenth Century Aviculture : the Bird-room.
In the next century we note the growth of another distinctively
German idea--the bird-room. Probably this was in its inception
rather a matter of chance than of design, and may be attributed to
the greater suitability of the German closed stove, as compared with
the English open fireplace, for avicultural purposes. These stoves
are of large dimensions and made of some kind of glazed earthenware.
Standing well away from the wall of the room, they diffuse an even
heat and need only to be stoked at long intervals ; also all fumes are
carried away by a stove-pipe. This appears to be one of the very
few articles, " made in Germany," which are not normally imported
into this country. I have only seen one here, and that belonged to
a German family.
Though greatly inferior to the modern " Tortoise" stove, con-
nected to radiators (I have the smallest size of " Tortoise " in my
house, yet it sufficiently heats a billiard-room, a fair-sized con-
servatory, a large bed-room, and a bird-room), it is obviously handy
for avicultural purposes.
(Since writing the above, an acquaintance, who has resided in
Germany, has sent me the following details : " The German stoves are
generally made of iron with a large superstructure of tiles--generally
white ; the iron heats the tiles wonderfully, so that the latter are
often quite warm in the morning and make the room beautifully
warm in all parts--so different from an English room, where one is
only warm close to the fireplace. The latest type has a regulator
and burns all night without any trouble. They burn coals or peat,
not wood. They would be splendid for birds, being so clean, safe,
and easy to manage, but they are not elegant, except those in very
large houses, which have ornamental tiles.")
It is fairly obvious that the seventeenth century English bird-
room could not easily have been systematically heated, and therefore
its owner would have had no inducement to spend much time with

his birds in the winter months. The only description in the ' Fancyer&apos;s
Delight ' of a bird-room of the German type, in which the birds are
always flying loose and are never caged, is of a combined room and
" outlet " (outdoor flight) and is recommended for breeding Canaries,
hut is admittedly borrowed from a German design.
Even to-day there is nearly as much difficulty in heating
efficiently a bird-room in this country. I regret to say that a visit
to two of our members revealed the fact that, in this twentieth
century, they were using nothing more satisfactory than the common
and smoky paraffin lamp. I was on the point of suggesting to
them the vast superiority of the smokeless blue-flame stove of the
" Beatrice " type, but on reflection I felt sure that it would be wasted
effort.
But, though the idea of a comfortably heated room, in which
the aviculturist could sit at all seasons and in all weathers and watch
his birds flying round him, is an attractive one, I have not found it a
success in actual use. Although Bechstein claims that " all birds are
less at ease in a cage than when at liberty in a room," my experience
is the exact converse. During a period of nearly two years 1 tried
many varieties of English and foreign birds under these conditions,
and I found that one and all would spring into the air the moment
one entered the room and fly wildly round and round. Any sitting
birds would throw themselves off their nests, scattering the eggs on
the floor, and Larks would beat against the ceiling. In the very dry
atmosphere eggs did not hatch well, and young birds never seemed
to prosper. I recollect that I failed under these conditions with such
easy species as the Goldfinch and Tree-sparrow. There were other
objections. The walls became dirty. No chair could be left in the
room even for a few minutes without being soiled. Sand adhered to
one's boots and, despite the vigorous use of a doormat, was carried
about the house. How the Germans could breed such shy species as
the Blue Grosbeak under these conditions has always been a mystery
to me. I give them full credit for the requisite skill and patience.
I have heard of some successful English flying-rooms. In one a
soft-bill fancier kept twenty-six (!) Nightingales and claimed that
there was "always one in song," but never more than one, for, in
such a confined space, the master-singer would brook no rival.

106 On the Influence of German Aviculture.
I subsequently built a small outdoor bird-room heated by
water-pipes and with all sides of glass, which was much more
successful. Quails, Quail-Finches, and Lark-Finches were quite at
home in it, and Whitethroats, Garden-Warblers, and Orphean
Warblers sang well in it in the winter. I have now rebuilt this
little house, converting half of it into an aquarium and the other half
into flights for Softbills. I daresay that it will be something else
before long, for the writer is an incorrigible experimentalist.
My indoor bird-room, however, after many transformations, is
in a final and finished state. It is now a song-bird-room. A large
(6x6 ft.) window has been fitted, and a hot-water radiator; a glass
sky-light (for better ventilation) has been inserted in the ceiling. It
contains one large flight, three small flights, and several large cages. I
have had as many as four Nightingales singing at one time in it, and
last spring with two Nightingales, two Orange Ground-Thrushes, a
Woodlark and several Linnets, I probably had as wonderful bird-
music as one is at all likely to hear in this very imperfect world.
The Bechstein Era.
As the eighteenth century drew to its close, we note a great
increase of popularity in aviculture in Germany. Dr. Bechstein's
book--probably the first work on the subject in which there was order
and method and a scientific point of view--had a great reception and
quickly ran through three editions. The Germans began to show
great skill in handling insectivorous birds; Bechstein tells us that he
knew several amateurs who always had one or two Wrens caged or
Hying in the bird-room. Sixty-six species of foreign birds are
described in his work, and he apologises for the non-inclusion of
many other foreign species, which were to be seen in maritime towns
in Germany, on the ground that he bad had no opportunity of person-
ally studying them.
But let us note that they did not overdo it. The worthy
Doctor informs us that, though he had a " passion " for birds, he kept
only thirty. We could all mention aviculturists who have not been
satisfied with less than three hundred, and some have kept a thousand t

By Arthur G. Butler, Ph.D.
I confess that I was puzzled as to the character of the stick-
insects which Mr. Brook mentioned as recommended by Mr. Seth-
Smith for bird-food ; I even wondered at the time whether certain
stick-like caterpillars might not be intended: it is therefore satisfactory
to know that the genuine Orthopterous insects were meant, because
it bears out my own contention that insects are only protected to
a moderate extent by their mimetic character. It is evident that
Carausius is not distasteful, or it would not he greedily devoured,
and it seems probable that the same may be true of other stick-
insects.
We must therefore conclude that where there is abundance
of insect-food a bird does not take the trouble to examine a stick- or
leaf-like object, in order to decide whether it is animal or vegetable.
On the other hand, if an insectivorous bird has been unable to obtain
much insect-food, or is hungry, it closely examines every leaf and
twig, and thus speedily discovers its character, as I pointed out as
long ago as December, 1889 ('Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist.,' p. 472), where
I recorded the fact of giving an example of the leaf-like moth
(Phlogophora meticulosa ) to a Liolhrix on September 25th, 1887,
which, after carefully examining it and probably observing its legs,
tested its character with a peck and then devoured it. I ought,
however, to have said that I suspended the moth in an inconspicuous
corner of the cage when the bird was not looking : I did not otter it
to him, or he would probably have accepted it without hesitation.
Birds have such excellent eyesight that they are not readily
deceived, and anybody who has watched our Tits and Warblers
carefully examining the twigs and leaves of trees and shrubs in their
search for food, or our winter residents turning over the fallen leaves
which carpet the earth, must be well satisfied that little can escape
their vigilance. If their resemblance to twigs alone served to protect
the caterpillars of certain Geometrid moths (loopers), I do not think
many would escape ; hut, as I have pointed out elsewhere, they are
so tough and rigid that a small bird is unable to shake and beat them
to a pulp as he does the softer type of smooth caterpillar. The

smaller, softer, and less mimetic looping larvae are eaten wholesale;
that of Halia vauaria (the V-moth) is a favourite food of the Tits
when they are rearing nestlings.
I should imagine that the true leaf-insects related to Mantis ,
and some other large leaf-like Orthopterous insects, would be pro-
tected almost as much by the great expanse of inedible chitinous
material, which produces the foliiform aspect, as by its deceptive
character, though doubtless passing birds are deceived thereby. The
leaf-like butterfly ( Kallima ), of one species of which Alfred Bussell
Wallace many years ago exhibited a group sitting with closed wings
on almost leafless twigs (at a conversazione of the Linnaean Society),
was extremely convincing ; but the late Mr. Pryer, of Sandakan, told
me that he had only seen the Bornean species sitting on the ground.
One would not see a number of scattered leaves lying edgewise on
the eai&apos;th, and it would require a very foolish bird to be deceived by
them : we must therefore hope that they had only descended on to
damp sand for a drink.
If these mimetic forms were nasty, one could understand that,
after sampling them, a bird might fight shy of them ; although I
proved that in some cases my birds seemed to acquire a taste for
insects which they at first refused ; and Mr. Swynnerton has proved
that insectivorous animals, both birds and beasts, will, when hungry,
eat more or less nauseous insects. I have never known my birds to
refuse caterpillars on account of their colour, although they naturally
fight shy of bizarre types with which they are not familiar. Some
years ago I had the misfortune to offend my friend Prof. Poulton by
pointing out that the (rather fanciful) resemblance of the caterpillar
of the lobster-moth to a spider could only he an inducement to an
insectivorous bird to eat it. I was under the impression that the
late H. W. Bates had suggested the resemblance, hut I was soon
undeceived.
Of course all aviculturists are well aware of the eagerness with
which all insect-eating birds pursue spiders, tiny Waxbills seizing
upon full-grown females of the common garden spider ( Epeira
cliademata ) ; while I have seen Tits go for the largest examples
of the house-spider (Tegenaria domcstica) and devour them
greedily.

The idea of warning-colours seems to have been first suggested
to Darwin by Wallace (' Descent of Man,' 2nd ed., p. 499) to account
for the existence of brilliantly coloured caterpillars which seemed to
be destitute of any other means of protection, excepting perhaps that
they might be distasteful; and he stated that the skin of caterpillars
was extremely tender, so that if a bird pecked one in order to sample
its flavour, it would infallibly die. I don't admit either assumption.
The skin of some caterpillars is comparatively tender, of others it is
extremely tough, and I have known caterpillars which have been
injured to develop into moths in which there was only a slight imper-
fection.
I believe that caterpillars striped black and yellow like wasps
(as that to which Darwin called Wallace's attention) are usually
nauseous, and I think they are fairly thick-skinned; certainly the
insects they become are not easily killed. As a general rule I should
say that distasteful butterflies and moths, such as Parnassius, the
Danaids both of the Old and New Worlds, the Acrceids, the Zygcenids,
and some of the Arctiids among the moths are so little affected by
one hard pinch that a single attack by a bird would have no
permanent effect upon them. If all nasty butterflies were coloured
alike I could quite understand birds and beasts taking notice of their
hues ; but they are of all the colours in the rainbow ; there is nothing
distinctive about them.
The late Professor Packard, of the States, asserted that the hairs
and spines on caterpillars protected them against the attacks of their
enemies, but not only do many of the larger birds simply rub off the
hairs and then devour them, but the most hairy of our British
caterpillars, that of the common Tiger-moth, is more subject to
attacks from ichneumon-flies than any other caterpillar known to me.
Many of my birds ate the spiny caterpillars of the small tortoise-
shell butterfly, some of them rubbing off the spines, but some
swallowing spines and all. Birds are not so foolish as to refuse good
food because it gives them a little trouble to prepare it.
When one reflects, one wonders what possible good it can do
to a species if it possesses warning colours in one stage to advertise
its nastiness, and in a later stage it ceases to be nasty ? Birds do
not say to themselves " that gooseberry-moth came from a nasty

caterpillar and still retains its warning-colours differently dis-
tributed " ; they put it to the test, and some at least of them are
perfectly satisfied with the flavour of the moth, although they did
not care for the caterpillar. The colouring does not put them off,
they are not deceived by it.
Lastly, somebody once suggested (I don't know who it was,
but I hope it was not one of my old friends) that metallic colours
were a protection, the inference being, I presume, that the lower
animals were aware that metal was not fit for food. I don't suppose
it ever entered into a bird's mind to bother about whether it was or
was not, but it is certain that some birds are attracted by metal, or
in fact anything that glitters, and it is equally certain that insects
with metallic colouring are greedily devoured.
There are still many things in this world which hitherto have
not been satisfactorily explained, and some of them will probably not
be properly understood while this world lasts ; but in any case don't
let us credit our feathered friends with being greater fools than our-
selves, or having inferior eyesight. If I can see a red-underwing
moth at rest on a granite wall or a lichen-covered tree-trunk, surely
I may credit a bird with even more acute eyesight.&quot;
SHEATHBILLS.
By Graham Renshaw, M.D., F.R.S.E.
" We find in Chionis a connecting-link, closing the narrow gap
between the Plovers and Gulls of the present day ."--Cones and
Kidder.
There are certain groups of birds which exhibit remarkable
outward resemblance to other groups with which they have no real
affinity. The Old World Hornbills, for instance, with their huge
beaks and weird cries, recall the big-billed, noisy Toucans of America,
though the two groups are poles apart. The long-winged, rapidly-
flying Swifts are popularly classed with the Swallows rather than with
* [Might not a human being detect some such object which could be passed over
by a bird, owing to the much higher powers of reasoning in the former, i . e .,
of putting two and two together ?--Ed.]

on Sheathbills.
Ill
their nearer relations the Humming-birds. In spite of their wide
gape and mottled plumage, the Frog-mouths of Australia should be
ranged with the Oil-bird ( Steatornis) rather than with the Night-jars
which they superficially resemble. Again, the Sheathbills of the
southern seas, though marine and predaceous, recall in external
appearance the poultry and Pigeons of more northerly regions.
Sheathbills are about the size of a small fowl, and have the
active habits of an Oyster-catcher. Their name is derived from the
curious horny sheath situated at the base of the beak, unknown in
other birds. The skin about the eyes is reddish and swollen, as if
inflamed; one species, in fact, is called the " Sore-eyed Pigeon " by
sailors. There are also small fleshy warts on the head, like incipient
wattles, and comparable to the nodules on the head in Turkeys. The
plumage is beautiful snowy white; three species are recognised--the
Yellow-billed ( Ghionis alba), the Black-billed ( Ghionarchus minor),
and the Crozet Island Sheathbill ( Chionarchus crozettensis).
In the Sheathbill the aviculturist has an ideal pet. Inured to
hardship almost from the egg, in its desolate island habitat, this bird
bears easily the long voyage to Europe, and all three species have
been kept alive in this country. Sheathbills have often been exhibited
at the Zoo, no less than nine of the Yellow-billed form figuring in the
collection between 1865 and 1882. They seem, indeed, to be fond of
travel on their own account; for on May 1st, 1875, Mr. John Gunn
of the German barque, " Professor Koch," presented to the Regent's
Park collection a Black-billed Sheathbill which had been caught at
sea. This was a specially interesting gift, as the menagerie at that
time already contained a Yellow-billed individual, so that the two
species could be studied side by side. Still more remarkable was the
occurrence of a Yellow-billed Sheathbill in Ireland in December,
1892. The bird was killed at Carlingford Lighthouse in County
Down ; the wings and tail were nearly perfect, yet the presence of
an Antarctic bird in Ireland was so truly remarkable that its occur-
rence is an inexplicable mystery. Perhaps it was an escape--the
lost pet of some returning sailor.
The Little Sheathbill of the Crozet Islands was long confused
with the Black-billed or "lesser" species--from which it may be
distinguished by its pink (not yellow) feet, and by the smaller beak.

Dr. Graham Renshaw,
Aviculture owes the introduction of C. crozettensis to Mr. Searle, of
Capetown. He had a specimen in his aviary for some time, and
eventually sent it as a gift to the Zoological Society ; the bird was
brought home by Captain Armson, who safely delivered it at the
Gardens. On its death it was made into a skin, and was exhibited
before the Society on November 28th, 1867 ; it is probably thio
individual which figures in the British Museum Catalogue as having
been received from Captain Armson. On October 26th of the
following year two more examples from the Crozets were safely
unpacked at the Zoo--gifts from another resident of Cape Town, Mr.
B. L. Layard. To Mr. Layard we owe our earliest knowledge of the
eurious, plover-like egg of the Sheathbill; for no egg of any of the
species was known until he sent to Professor Newton an example which
he had taken on the Crozets. Sheathbills do not appear to have
hitherto bred in captivity ; the study of the quaint little black
nestlings is a domain untrodden and unexplored.

The little group of early naturalists at the beginning of the
ast century included in its ranks several enthusiastic collectors, and
perhaps the most persevering of them was Mr. William Bullock.
Until recently London possessed a tangible token of his labours
in the Egyptian Hall, Piccadilly: for it was built by him to
house his great museum, which contained over fifteen thousand
" natural and foreign curiosities," and had taken seventeen years to
amass. The cost of collecting had been #30,000, it was said;
amongst the contributors were Sir Joseph Banks, Lord Dundas,
Colonel Gordon, Mr. Edwards, Mr. Irby, and other well-known
people. In 1820 the collection was sold by auction, and its treasures
scattered far and wide.
Amongst the rarities of the Bullock Museum was a unique
specimen--an Ocellated Turkey--the first ever seen in Europe,

" captured in the Bay of Honduras." It was purchased for the
Paris Museum, and is probably still there. Cuvier described and
figured the new bird under the name of Meleagris ocellata ; Temminck'
of Leyden, figured it as Plate 112 of his ' Planches Coloriees."
Eleven years later this beautiful species was seen alive in London, a
hen bird having been presented to the Zoo by the Earl of Ilchester.
About this time the thirteenth Earl of Derby was engaged in
forming his superb zoological collection at Knowsley Hall. The
Derby museum and menagerie became the largest and best in the
kingdom ; the menagerie occupied one hundred acres of land and
seventy acres of water, and cost over #15,000 a year in upkeep. The
museum contained the first Apteryx seen out of New Zealand;
five hundred birds, belonging to forty-five species, were bred in the
aviaries. Lord Derby introduced the Black-necked Swan, of which
he had six at Knowsley, and the rare Sandwich Island Goose bred
freely in the collection. No trouble or expense was spared in adding
to the series; collectors were despatched to the remoter portions of
the globe in order to enrich the cages and aviaries.
The Ocellated Turkey was a special desideratum--alive if
possible, but welcome living or dead. Lord Derby sent out Mr. J.
Bates (not H. W. Bates) to Central America for the express purpose
of obtaining the bird. Mr. Bates was away for fifteen months, and
made a considerable collection of animals, both living and dead. He
brought home a live (female) ocellata and also several skins of both
sexes. On July 2nd, 1851, Lord Derby died, aged seventy-seven ; the
museum was bequeathed to the city of Liverpool, and the menagerie
sold by auction. The sale began on October 6th, 1851, and lasted a
week, realising about #7000. Two of- the Black-necked Swans and
five Impeyan Pheasants were selected by Queen Victoria in accord-
ance with his Lordship's will; the fate of the Ocellated Turkey (if
then alive) is unknown.
Although the female ocellata is a fine bird, the absence of pairs
rendered these early importations of academic value only. In 1856,
however, a pair and an odd bird were obtained in Honduras, and
brought over in August of the same year by Mr. George Skinner and
Captain Wilson. The Turkeys were presented to Queen Victoria*
who deposited them in the Zoological Gardens. Unfortunately,

The Ocellated Turkey.
although they lived nearly two years, the birds did not breed; the
male at any rate was healthy, and used to show off in the spring.
His portrait was sketched by Mr. T. W. Wood, who has vividly
described him " with his tail spread, wings drooping, and all his
feathers puffed up, as if he would burst with pride. At such a time
his head was thrown back so far, and his breast feathers projecting
so far that he could not observe the ground beneath him, and con-
sequently he often stepped into the water, much to his annoyance
and the visitors' amusement." The portrait of this individual,
together with the foregoing account, will be found in the Rev. J. G.
Wood's ' Illustrated Natural History.' The last survivor of the three
appeared to have been an old bird which died in the Gardens in
1860.
In the spring of 1861 Mr. Robert Owen, a resident in Guate-
mala, brought over a small collection of Central American birds--one
Guan, one Globose Curassow, one Tinamou, two Tree Colins, and one
Ocellated Turkey. The last-named (a female) was placed in the Zoo
with the rest of the collection ; it was in poor condition, but improved
under the care of Mr. Bartlett, and apparently lived for three years.
On July 20th, 1880, Mr. W. E. Sibeth presented a pair of ocellata to
the Zoological Gardens--these being specially welcome, as none had
been exhibited since 1864. In May, 1909, the writer saw a fine pair
in the Zoo at Berlin. They were kept in a small building divided
into three or four compartments ; it was practically a mammal house,
as the other occupants were a Babirusa, a Kinkajou, a Great Anteater,
a Tree Kangaroo, and an Ayeaye.
The writer has studied several living examples. Although
even as a museum specimen the Ocellated Turkey is a fine bird, when
seen alive it is truly superb. An adult male, when showing off with
distended plumage, and expanded tail rocking from side to side as if
driven by clockwork, suggests in its gorgeous appearance a huge
metallic butterfly. The plumage is shot with a coppery gloss, like
that on a Monal Pheasant, and the tail coverts are ocellated with
discs of exquisite sapphire blue. The study of the bare areas in life
is interesting. The head has the skin bright violet-blue or grey-blue,
the throat and upper neck are grey-blue, the skin round the ear is
dirty grey. The eyelids are bright carmine, and there are a few

bright red, pea-like caruncles on the cheeks and throat. In both
sexes the top of the head is dotted with small fleshy caruncles,
yellow like suet, and recalling the uropygial gland in a certain species
of Hornbill. The bill is greyish ; the legs and feet are either bright
lake or dull flesh-colour. The occiput is sprinkled with short black
filamentous feathers, and suggests a bald head feebly covered with
hair.
All the specimens seen by the writer were in excellent health*
and were kept out of doors like common poultry, with an unheated
shed to sleep in. This specimen is, however, subject to the attacks
of internal parasites; the old bird, which died in London in 1860,
was found to have a hydatid cyst in the liver. The Ocellated Turkey
breeds readily with the common domestic bird, and many years ago
hybrids were obtained at the Zoo. Altogether the introduction of
this noble species should rank as one of the most attractive chapters
of aviculture; Prof. Elliott has well said: " It would be difficult to
imagine a more beautiful object than the Ocellated Turkey."

Many things have been written, from time to time, about the
Indian Shamah, including descriptions of his appearance, habits,
accomplishments, virtues, vices, house-building, and family rearing.
I am not sure, however, that much attention has been devoted
to one interesting stage of his existence, immediately preceding the
house-building.
At present I have an engaged couple sojourning under my
roof, whose antics are a source of continual interest and amusement.
"Bob" has enjoyed a bachelor existence for a number of years
and might have continued in single blessedness were it not for an
intimation, which appeared in the matrimonial columns of his weekly
paper, that a deserving spinster was on the look-out for a husband.
There was a bit of a rush for " Kate," notwithstanding the
absence of any reference to her age, appearance, or disposition.

However, Bob hustled a bit more than the others, and secured
the lady.
Kate arrived, looking decidedly cheap, after her long
voyage from India and subsequent experiences in the Irish Sea,
with drooping wings and closing eyes, and she needed considerable
washing down, tonicking, and feeding with many cockroaches and
other delicacies, before she was in a condition to be presented to her
future husband.
Up to this he was enjoying an open-air life, with plenty
of room, hut he manifested no objection to transferring his quarters
to quite a small villa next Kate's dwelling.
Bob's first call was rather a violent affair, and resolved itself
into a sort of rough-and-tumble on her doorstep, with the door
closed. " Rotten form of sport this kind of canoodling," I imagine
I heard him say.
Proceedings subsequently quieted down somewhat, and he
divided his attention between wrestling with the Demon beetle-trap,
in a vain endeavour to extract some of the contents, and dashing on
to Kate's doorstep. He made himself look wonderfully attractive,
spreading his wings and displaying the beautiful white patch above
his tail, singing lustily all the time, in a more subdued and attractive
manner, however, than usual.
Kate seemed much gratified with all the attention, showing
her satisfaction by whistling her own little tune, and calling him
back whenever he wandered away to the counter-attraction of the
beetle-trap.
As regards their conversation, it seemed to partake of the
form of, " D'ye know, I'm getting very fond of you," answered from
the other side of the door by : "Noiv you're talking," " None of your
blarney," or other vulgar expressions picked up in the country of the
lady's adoption.
A horrid old cynic in the person of a Gold-fronted Fruitsucker
living opposite understood, I think, more of the conversation than I
did, as I observed him turning a more vivid green than usual--with
utter disgust, I take it; and I think I heard a murmur from the
Nightingale living next door, " I can stand a good deal, but this is a
hit thick." I am not prepared, however, to swear to this.

OBITUARY.
Bridgeman .--We greatly regret to record the death of another
of our members, who has passed over whilst serving his country in
the war. Commander the Honble. Richard Orlando B. Bridgeman,
D.S.O., R.N., was second son of the fourth Earl of Bradford and
brother of the present Peer. Immediately before the war he was
serving in the light cruiser H.M.S. " Hyacinth." On the 14th of
July, 1916, he was gazetted a Companion of the D.S.O. for the
following services : -- " Commander Bridgeman displayed great
" courage and coolness on August 19, 1915, in command of two
" whalers, which proceeded into Tanga Harbour. The manner in

Meeting of the Council.
" which the whalers endeavoured, though subjected to a heavy and
" accurate fire, to carry out their orders and board the s.s. ' Mark-
" graf,' was worthy of the best traditions of the Royal Navy."
Commander Bridgeman was a charming personality, as well
as a keen sportsman and naturalist. He had been a member of the
Avicultural Society since December, 1904.
" They shall grow 7 not old, as we that are left grow old :
" Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn.
" At the going down of the sun and in the morning
" We will remember them."
Jamrach. --Mr. Albert Edwai&apos;d Jamrach died in January. For
several generations his name has been known all over the world as a
dealer in animals and birds, his father and grandfather having
preceded him in the trade.
He was a cultured man, speaking several languages. The war
killed his business and also practically wore him out.

WHYDAHS.
By W. Shore Baily.
The Whydahs best known to our aviculturalists are the
Giant, Jackson, Crimson-ringed, Bed-collared, Bed-shouldered, Para-
dise, Queen, and Pintailed. Of these, as far as I know, only the
Giant, Jackson, Bed-collared, and Pintailed have been bred in this
country, and no details of the nesting of the last-named have been
published. They are all highly desirable aviary birds, as they are
so easy to cater for, and do not interfere with any other and smaller
birds that may be kept with them. The long tails of the males, when
these are in breeding plumage, are always a source of wonder and
delight to visitors.
My experience of the Giant Whydah ( C. procne ) is confined
to my occasional visits to the Zoo, where there are usually one or
two of these fine birds to be seen. The cock is quite a large bird,
and when in full colour, is black, the feathers on the wings being
edged with brown. A patch of scarlet on the wing-butts is very
conspicuous when the bird is in flight. Mr. Teschemaker gives a
very interesting account of the breeding of this bird in the ' Avicul-
tural Magazine ' for the year 1909. He describes the eggs as
dull greyish-white, clouded with blue, grey and purplish markings.
I hope one day to secure a pair of these Whydahs for my own
aviaries.
The Jackson Whydah (D. jacksoni) is the next largest of the
species. I got my three birds from our member, Mr. G. E. Low,

Mr. W. Shore Baily,
whose brother brought them over from East Africa. The cock in
breeding plumage is for the most part black, but some of the feathers
on the wing are edged with brown. A white shield at the base of
beak, and a peculiarly curved tail, are noticeable features of this
bird. When on the ground it carries itself very like a small black
Bantam Cock.
Jacksons are particularly interesting from the fact that they
have regular playing grounds. The one constructed by my bird was
about four feet in diameter. In the centre a tuft of grass about a
foot high was left; around this many times a day he went through a
course of dancing and jumping for the benefit of his two hens, who
watched the proceedings from the top of the surrounding grass. The
nest was a very neat one, constructed out of the growing grass, and
lined with the flowering heads of various grasses. I can't say
whether it was built by the cock, but in all probability it was. At
any rate, the hen lined it, as by seeing her carrying some grass in
her beak, I was led to discover her nest. Three eggs were laid,
greenish white, thickly spotted with brown and grey. Incubation
lasted twelve days, and the young were in the nest sixteen days.
No artificial food of any kind was supplied to them, and the young
ones were principally reared upon grass seeds, spray millet, and
canary seed. They are now quite as big as their female parent, and
I am afraid that when I catch them up shortly I shall have some
difficulty in identifying them. All five birds still keep together, and
spend a great deal of time upon the ground. The male's song is a
harsh wheeze. I have not heard the hen's call-note at all.
The Crimson-ringed Whydah (P. laticaucla) is another very
handsome bird. The cock when in full colour is black, the back and
wings being striated with brown. The crown of the head and a wide
ring around the neck, which forms a V at the throat, are crimson.
The hen is a good-sized bird, about one-third smaller than the
*Jackson hen. My birds were imported from East Africa by Mr.
E. W. Harper, from whom I got them. The cock only came into
colour at the end of July. He has built two or three nests, but
has failed to get either of his hens to take possession of them. When
he is displaying, the long tail feathers are spread to their full extent,
the wings are drooped as in the case of the common fowl and

pheasant, and the head is packed well into the shoulders, which
gives the bird an altogether curious appearance. His nests were
woven with long grass, one in a conifer, another in a bush, and the
third in a bunch of grass. This last nest was very like the Jackson's,
but instead of being on the ground was about two feet above it. I
had great hopes at one time that one of the hens was going to line
it, but she decided otherwise. It is possible that the natural time
for these birds to nest is in our winter. The song of the Crimson -
ringed Whydah is practically inaudible except for the last note, which
resembles the croaking of a frog.
The Red-collared Whydah (P. ardens) is a somewhat smaller
bird than P. laticauda, the hen markedly so. The body colour of
the cock in summer plumage is black; the back and wings being
striated with brown, but not so heavily as in the case of the last-
mentioned bird. The red collar is also narrower and does not
reach around to the back of the neck. This bird was bred in
1909 by Mrs. Annington, but no particulars of the event were
published.
Last year I also succeeded in breeding it. The nest was placed
in a laurel. It was a very flimsy structure of dried grass, probably
built by the cock. The first eggs laid were white, but these were
evidently abnormal, as the hen has since laid three other clutches,
all of which were pale bluish-green, mottled with brown. Two eggs
were laid on each occasion, and these were considerably smaller than
those of the Jackson's. The incubation period was about twelve days.
This year I turned her into the same aviary with the young cock,
her own mate having died. In the same aviary with her were some
Crimson-crowned Weaver Cocks, one of which she selected as a
husband in preference to her own offspring, and a fine hybrid has
been the result. The young Whydah born in 1915, although now
over a year old, shows no sign of colour, but sings inaudibly and
displays quite as freely as his male parent used to do. The hybrid,
a larger bird, already shows a pale buff collar on each side of the
neck, which does not, however, meet at the throat. It looks as if he
might make a very pretty bird, if he lives to come into full colour.
With the young Giant Whydahs, Mr. Teschemaker tells us, signs of
colour were visible when they were only a few months old. I find

these birds very keen on live food, and both gentles and mealworms
were very freely given to the young hy the hen.
The Red-shouldered Whydah ( U. axillaris ) is a heavier-built
bird than either P. arclens or P. laticauda, but the absence of the
long tail makes it look smaller. In breeding plumage the cock is
black. His wing feathers are edged with brown, and he has a bright
patch of scarlet on the shoulders. The beak, which is large and
powerful, is light bluish-grey. When displaying he spreads his
wings so as to show the red on the shoulders in just the same way
as do the Red-winged Blackbird and Troupial. The feathers around
the neck are also fluffed up and the tail feathers spread out fanwise.
Quite early in the year he built a nest in a low bush, and his hen
laid two eggs therein. These were white, thickly speckled with
small red spots. In my absence on holiday the Red-collared Whydah
hen took a fancy to the same nest, and on my return I found the
eggs of both birds in the nest, so I removed them for my collection.
Later on he built her another nest in a creeper and this time she was
undisturbed. Tw t o eggs only were laid. The incubation was twelve
days. One young one was hatched, but it only survived a short
time. The song of this bird is harsh and unmusical, hut not very
loud.
Of Paradise Whydahs ( S. paradisea ) I have seven, four cocks
and three hens. I have long wanted to breed this handsome little
bird, but it seems to be a difficult proposition. So far, none of my
males have shown the slightest sign of coming into colour this season,
and of course if they do so now it will be too late to attempt to breed
from them.* I fancy that to get success one will have to secure a
cock that comes into colour about April or May, which it is not
always possible to do. I shall keep on trying and one day may be
able to send an account of their successful rearing.
The Pintail Whydah (N. principalis) is another Whydah that
it does not seem easy to breed, although Mrs. Annington succeeded
in doing so in 1909, a year which must be described as a good
Whydah year. No account of this success was available for publica-
tion, so very little is known of this bird's nesting habits in captivity
In the case of my Pintails I lost my hen early in the year from

pneumonia, and was unable to replace her, so T had no chance of
breeding them. I consider this species to be a delicate one.
My Queen Whydahs ( N. regia) when out of colour very closely
resemble Pintails in the same stage of plumage. They have not
come into colour with me this year, and I am strongly inclined to
think that they are both hens, especially as my cock N. principalis
has shown them marked attention all the season. They have made
no attempt at nesting.
One other little Whydah I once had, the Long-tailed Com-
basson (V. hypocherina). They were delicate little things, and
although kept indoors, only lived a few months. I judge them to be
more fit for the indoor birdroom than for an outdoor aviary, although
no doubt they would do well enough outdoors with Waxbills and
other small fry during our few summer months.

By The Lady William Cecil.
[Baroness Amherst of Hackney.
Among the small birds that are peculiar to America there are
few more interesting than the Vireos, though their colour is in-
significant, and they are far oftener heard than seen ; still, to listen
to their soft sweet voices is indeed a joy, and they take no small part
in the endless chorus of the woodlands.
The Vireos do not, as a rule, live in the deep forests as do
most of the little warblers, but generally inhabit districts less densely
covered with trees.
Though they have the feet of the Oscines, Vireos may more
properly be classified as " very distant cousins " of the Shrikes; but
they are much smaller birds, only measuring from five to six inches.
Their bills are Shrike-like in form, hooked at the end and notched,
and in rare instances appear to be very slightly toothed behind the
notch. Their colouring, as a rule, is olivaceous and greyish, though,
of course, each species differs in shade and markings ; both sexes an d
the young birds are alike--they have ten primaries, but in some

cases one is quite rudimentary, or so hidden that only nine can be
counted.
All the Yireos are said to be entirely insectivorous, but I very
strongly suspect that they now and then indulge in a nice ripe berry !
They are not very shy birds, and probably would be easily tamed if
taken from the nest and given suitable food and plenty of space,
especially height, in an aviary.
The nests of the Yireos are beautifully made, and are probably
considered veritable works of art in the bird-world. They vary in
detail as to shape and material, though they all follow the same sort
of design. They are pendulous and, in nearly every case, are hung
from the farthest outside fork of a branch. They are generally
exquisitely woven of dry grass and fibre, and mosses, and sometimes
scraps of paper, wool, and hair are added, often all bound together
with caterpillar silk.
The commonest of this family is the Red-eyed Yireo or
Preacher (F. olivaceiLs). Its coat is greyish green, with a blue-
grey cap, and a black line below it, forming a very distinct eyebrow
to its bright red eye. Its feet are olive grey. It is entirely arboreal
in its habits, rarely deigning to descend to the ground.
The Cow-bird sometimes chooses this bird's nest in which to
lay its egg.
The voice of the Red-eyed Vireo is easily distinguished, as it
is curiously declamatory, and in shady woods even at midday its
song may be heard, voluble and decided, in short musical sentences
with a pause between each, hence its appropriate name of " Preacher."
The Black-whiskered Vireo, or " Whip-Tom-Kelly " ( V.barba -
tulu.s ) is very like the Red-eyed Vireo in colour, but it has a line of
dark spots on either side of the chin, and it has rather a longer bill.
I have only seen two specimens of this Yireo, both in the Pino del
Rio district of Cuba, though they come north to Florida. Both the
birds were presumably cocks, as both were singing lustily, a sweet
little song that sounded like " Twee-twee-tutti " many times repeated.
When disturbed both birds (they were about half a mile apart)
seemed very anxious and fussy, as if their little mates were near
by, sitting ; unfortunately we had not time to look for the nests, as
big clouds were gathering and a heavy thunderstorm was fast coming

up, so we had to hurry on to reach shelter, for a tropical thunder-
storm is no mean thing by which to be caught in the open !
The Warbling Vireo (V. gilvus) has the very sweetest of
melodious notes, which often may be heard early in the morning in
the trees in a village, or country town ; for though he builds in the
quiet woods, he is a sociable little person, and seems to like human
neighbours. It is easy enough to stand under a tree and listen to
him without in any way disturbing^his song, but it is very difficult to
catch sight of him, as he hides so cleverly among the leaves.
I listened a long time to one which was singing high up in a
maple tree, and though I was actually watching the branch on which
he was perched, it was some time before I could discover him, so
" protected " was he by his colouring of greyish-green, pale yellow,
and pearl-shaded white.
An apparently smaller and paler, and, according to some
ornithologists, a distinct variety, known as Swainson's Vireo ( V.
stoansonii ), takes the place of the Warbling Vireo in the Rocky
Mountains and westward. A pair of Swainsons, or what I believe to
be these, were building in a secluded corner of Beacon Park, British
Columbia, weaving a very elaborate nest, quite out of reach. These
birds certainly seemed decidedly smaller that the Warbling Vireos of
the Eastern States, though their colouring appeared much the same.
Perhaps they were rather lighter in general tone, and with even less
distinct shading. Their song had the same tender sweetness as that
of the Eastern variety. Both birds of this little couple helped very
energetically in nest building.
Bell's Vireo (V. bellii) is a still smaller bird, measuring well
under five inches ; it has a greenish-greyjhead shading to olive and
greenish-brown on the hack, rather brighter towards the tail; a
whitish throat and chin, and a rather bright yellow breast, and one
clear and one indistinct white bar on the wings. He is a cheery
little fellow, with a clear voice very loud for his size.
Bell's Vireos may be seen and heard almost any spring and
summer day in the open country and sparsely-w r ooded districts any-
where between " Kansas and the Rockies " ; I have never heard them
or seen them in thick or dark woods.
The Solitary Vireo ( V. solitarius), unlike the rest of th

family, usually inhabits rather swampy woods. It has a wonder-
fully sweet song full of musical notes. It builds a very curious nest
of fir-needles, leaves, and twigs, lined with lichen, and bound all
round with spiders' webs. It is generally placed in some inaccessible
place, and I have never been fortunate enough to get one myself, but
there are very perfect specimens in several ornithological collections
in America.
The Solitary Yireo is olive-green above with a bluish-grey
head, from which it is sometimes called the Blue-headed Yireo. It
has a broad white mark round the eyes and across the hill; the under
parts are white, with slight brownish-green on the sides, shading to
pale yellow.
The Plumbeous Vireos (V. plumbeus) take the place of the
Solitaries from the central plain to the Pacific coast. They can
hardly be mistaken, for the Plumbeous are much greyer, with a grey
back and head, rather brighter on the crown, the same white eye-
line as the Solitary, but a darkish loral stripe is added. They are
nearly white underneath, with a very little brownish-green shading ;
they have white wing-bars and white lines on the dark wings
and tail.
I do not know this bird's nest. Its voice is very much like
that of the Solitary. The Plumbeous Yireos are very common in
Colorado and Montana and in the southern Rockies. Some ornitho-
logists consider this bird only a local variety of the Solitary, but it
looks decidedly different, at least in colouring, as it appears so much
more " slatey " and grey.
One of the prettiest members of this family is the White-eyed
Yireo (V. noveboracensis). It is also olive-grey, but its colour is
much more distinct and brighter than most of its relations. It has
bright yellow " spectacles," and the dark feathers of its wings and
tail are edged with clear yellow. It may always be easily distin-
guished by its curious white eyes and almost black legs and feet.
Its song, though of course not nearly so loud, is much like that
of the Mocking-bird, as it imitates the notes of all sorts of other birds,
and mixes them up together with a peculiar and sweet little song of
its own. It also has an angry and most emphatic note when
frightened or disturbed, like that of an English Robin in a rage.

on the Vireos (or Greenlets) of North America. 137
The White-eyed Vireo sings in gardens, and among the bushes and
undergrowth of woods. The lazy Cow-bird often deposits its
" cuckoo " egg in the nest of these small birds, who patiently hatch
it out, and feed and rear the big greedy interloper at the expense of
their own nestlings.
Another more brightly coloured bird is the Yellow-throated
Vireo ( V. flavifrons ), with--as the name implies--a bright yellow
throat, and breast, fading to white below; and an olive bead and
back, gradually merging into bluish toward the tail. Bright yellow
rings round the eyes give it a very knowing look. It has two white
wing-bars, and some white-edged feathers in its dark tail. It is a
rather more heavily-built bird than the other Vireos, and its song is
somewhat monotonous--an often-repeated, persistent, rather melan-
choly note.
In the branch of some tree overhanging a stream or river, its
beautiful and elaborately-made hanging nest is placed, cleverly and
skilfully woven and slung from the outermost and quite inaccessible-
fork. It may be seen, but it cannot be reached; you may " look,
but you mustn't touch," so safely is it placed out of harm's way.
There ai'e several other members of this interesting group, but
unfortunately I have not had the time or the pleasure of watching
them carefully. Among them are the Brotherly-love Vireo ( V.phila -
delphicus), rather a rare bird ; and the Grey Vireo ( V. vicinior), which
is perhaps a local variety of Plumbeous, said to be only found in the
State of Arizona. It is much paler than the Plumbeous. Perhaps
this peculiarity may be owing to the arid nature of the district
it inhabits, as the Egyptian and other deserts seem to produce pale-
varieties of birds whose colouring is deeper and more defined and.
distinct in more fertile lands.
Hutton's Vireo (V. huttonii ), which I have not seen, is said to-
be peculiar to Southern California.
The Least Vireo, also I fear a stranger to me, is much the-
same size as Bell's Vireo; it is said to be found only in the south-
western States. I am told it has a much longer tail in proportion to-
its size than any others of the family.
Once, owing to a breakdown on the line, we were delayed for
some time many miles from any habitation on the borders of New

Mexico and Texas. The country on either hand was undulating and
rather treeless, but there was plenty of scrub, and big bushes which
might almost have ranked as trees. The ground, as far as the eye
could see, was carpeted with flowers--blue lupins, yellow esch-
scholtzias, crimson verbenas, and hundreds of others--and " among
the buds and blossoms " there were plenty of birds.
I fear most of our fellow-travellers were very much bored by
the delay, but I was delighted, for an hour or two in this paradise of
birds and flowers was a chance in a lifetime ! After a short stroll
along the track I sat in the shade of the " observation " platform,
and watched Scissor-tailed Tyrants, and many other delightful
" winged things," flitting about in the sunshine. One small bird was
flying from hush to bush so close to me that I could see every detail
of his form and colour quite distinctly. I watched him for several
minutes before he flew farther afield. I noted at the time the
following description : " Small bird (about five in.), I don't know him
at all; colour olive-green, white breast shaded with greyish-green on
the sides. Top and sides of head black, legs rather dark. Bill like
a Vireo or Shrike." It was not till many months later that I was
able to compare my note with any hook on birds. The only descrip-
tion I could find that tallied with it, and, in fact, gives every detail, is
Dr. Coue's description of the Black-headed Vireo (V. atricapillus), of
which he says only three specimens are known ! He gives the
locality as " south-west Texas." Perhaps it is within the range of
possibility that the small fellow I watched and noted from the train
that lovely April day was a fourth specimen of this extremely rare
bird ?
I only mention this little incident to show that any observation
of birds may he " worth while " ; there is always a chance that
something rare, or even something new, may be noted in such lucky
moments. A bird-lover must always go about with open eyes and
open mind ; we never know what delightful surprises may be in
store for us, or what little link we may add to the chain of bird
history and bird lore.

arranging their feathers, and only leaving their perch to fly to the
food-tray, from which they ate greedily and copiously of rice boiled
in sweetened milk, with bananas and other fruits cut into small
pieces. The birds very soon recovered from the effects of the
voyage, so that I was able to exhibit a pair at the show which we
organised in June, 1914, at the Jardin d'Acclimatation, in Paris.
Indeed, the Pigeons regained their health so much that I
found their aviary in a state of confusion one morning; one of the
male birds was hunting and knocking his companions about, who,
frightened, were crouching in the corners. This seemed to me
curious, considering that up till then the three males appeared to be
the best of friends and apparently attached to each other. I removed
the aggressor, but the two remaining Pigeons fought, so that I had
to place each one in a separate flight.
I then made an attempt to put the female with each of the
males in turn, but without success, for she would have been quickly
killed had I left her to the fury of their attack on her.
Each of the four birds was consequently put by itself at the
time that the war broke out.
For a year I saw them no more !
When I had my first leave home, in July, 1915, I found that
one of the Pigeons had died, whilst the others appeared to he in very
had health, their plumage and their bills soiled. I at once put them
in an open-air aviary communicating with a heated compartment,
and had the satisfaction of seeing them benefiting by the change
after a few days.
Since then the three Pigeons (two males and one female) have
l'emained in that aviary in perfect health ; from November to April
they lived in the heated compartment, the door of which was left
open, and I feel certain that fresh air and space is absolutely necessary
in order to keep them in good condition.
Unfortunately it has been impossible to leave the female
with one of the males, and consequently one has no hope of their
breeding.
These Pigeons are sluggish and remain sitting on the branches
of trees, which they leave only to feed or to hunt their companions
in the aviary.

Their characters are not attractive, although they are not
dangerous to other species of birds, for their wings are too feeble.
One never sees them on the ground.
The moult affects them but little in appearance, and .their
plumage is superb throughout the year ; amongst foliage they have
a fine effect with their blue bodies, pearl-grey tails, and red heads.
I have never heard them coo. I have now had them for over three
and a half years in captivity.

(Written for the ' Balkan News.')
The Bee-Eater is a beautiful bird and one that is new to
many of us. In July last I passed each day quite close to a nest
in the bank of a stream, with a large round hole for entrance. Just
beyond were some tents, hut the birds were never scared away.
They appear to he about the size of starlings. Their flight is graceful
and swallow-like. They fly high in the air and might easily be
mistaken for swallows, with their quick flutter of wings and gliding
motion.
The bill of this bird is black, very long, straight, and sharp-
pointed. The head is a fine bronze colour, the body green and blue,
the wings a light brown tinged with green. Watched from below
the wings and tail look almost transparent. I saw one newly-fledged
young bird at the entrance to the hole leading to the nest; with
head turned aside it awaited in eager expectation its parents seen
skimming the air high aloft. In their bills I have distinguished what
might be large moths or beetles.
The shallows and marshes of Lake Butkovo and its river
are favourite resorts of water-fowl. Great Herons can be easily
approached. They are very tame, as most of the birds of this country
are. They lack the blue-grey colouring and head plumes of our
British Heron, but the former are larger and taller. They are of a
whitish-grey colour with black wings and dark markings on the

breast. With the Herons are tall, wholly white birds--Egrets ;
their glittering pure white plumage makes them easily distinguish-
able a great way off.
The Storks.
In March last many of us had seen between Lake Langaza
and the ancient baths beyond, the great nests of the Storks reared
upon stunted elm trees or the chimney of a deserted cottage. It was
somewhat later that the birds themselves put in an appearance. At
first they used to be seen flying high over Lembet camp. In flight
the head and neck are extended, whereas in the case of the Heron
the neck is always retracted. In both cases the long legs trail
behind. A curious sight may he witnessed at Lozhishta, near Lake
Butkovo. Above the green slope upon which used to squat the
Turkish men-folk, are three ancient dwarfed elms. Upon the two
side ones are huge piles of sticks whereon sit or stand as many
Storks as can crowd together, quite tame, having never been molested,
it being likely they are held in some kind of awe by the natives.
In the middle of the group in the evening the priest stands aloft as
he calls on the faithful for prayer in shrill piping tones. The elm in
this remote village of the plain had been adopted for use as a minaret.
A ladder gave access to the " pulpit," around which was a rude pali-
sade. The men below appeared to smoke and dream, taking as little
notice as did the stork families.
In May we first used to see the blue birds which are about
the size of Jays, and often called Blue Jays. This is the Roller.
The first pair I came upon was perching on a fig tree down a gully--
the vivid colours harmonised to perfection with the green leaves of
the fig tree. Besides the general bluey-green hue about the wings
and back, the soft brown of the body makes a fine contrast. In
flight the blues of tail and wing are conspicuous.
The Hoopoe.
The Hoopoe is frequent in Macedonia. One I recollect seeing
in June along a high hill track on the grass. It immediately
lowered the remarkable head plumes till the feathers formed a point
behind, giving the bird the grotesque appearance of having a beak

fore and aft. These birds are evidently shy and prefer lonely and
deserted hamlets. One flew out from under the eaves of a house as I
passed, and later I disturbed one from the village close by from
which the inhabitants had just departed. Its general colour is a
bright chequered buff and grey.*
Following one day the stream which leads up from the
Butkovo plain I came upon a solitary dipper, sometimes known as
the Water Blackbird or Ouzel. Though by no means rare at home,
yet few people other than fishermen seem to be acquainted with it.
This specimen was sitting on a rock in the middle of the stream and
executed its comical bobbing bows before flying upstream. A puzzle
to naturalists is the power which the dipper has of running about
under water on the bed of a stream as it searches for its insect food.
One day a Weaver Bird's nest was handed to me.f This is
oval in shape, with the larger end upwards, where at one side is the
entrance 1 in. in diameter. It was made of the fluff of a species of
willow having the texture of thick, closely-woven felt. It had been
hanging from an outstretched bough only a foot or two above the
water.
The Black-headed Tern is common along the Struma plain.
It resembles a small sea-gull, from which, however, it is easily
distinguished by the long marked tail. If often dives from a height
upon its quarry, a small fish, imitating in miniature the great plunge
into the sea of the Gannet or Solent Goose.
At the time of writing several of the smaller birds were with
us about the low thorn bushes. The Wheatear, with its snow-white
feathers above the tail, and the Stone-Chat, with its jet-black head,
could be observed. The former dips down to hide when disturbed,
but the latter always chooses the topmost twig. Another larger bird
is of a general bronze colour, especially the male--a species of butcher
bird which feeds on the ubiquitous grasshopper.
Pelicans are quite common. Lately I made out a great flock
containing many hundreds. They were wheeling about leisurely as
if wishing to descend but were prevented by the sight of the military.

Mr. R. Colton,
Their flight formation is that of the letter V, but the limhs of the V
are not so long nor yet so regular as obtain with the Geese, to which
family the Pelicans belong.
Tamed specimens of the Kestrel, Little Owl, and even a great
Eagle have surprised me in several camps. In their changed state
they seemed to live contented lives, not far removed, as a rule, from
the camp cookhouse.

You must go a long way nowadays to find the birds, except
just here and there, where some sanctuary has been kept for them
almost by foroe, for the rifle and gun of the bird-hunter are ruthless,
and only fear of the arm of the law saves the wholesale destruction
of these soft-winged, soft-hued creatures, who, like the flowers, bring
a sweet touch of divine harmony into the restlessness of life.
Many of the smaller birds of the coast you will find close to
home, even in suburban gardens, the Jacky Winter, Coach Whip,
Peewee, tire Starling, the Yellow Robin, the Blue Wren, and others
*of varied species, but for a glimpse of the rarer larger birds at ease in
erowds you must travel far afield.
Bird life retreats farther from human outlook year by year.
Even on the Southern Road, near Picton, Thirlmere, and Mittagong,
where, two years ago, bird life was fairly abundant, you may travel
far and notice little. For there has been so much temporary settle-
ment round about. Hundreds of little homes and camps pitched
round deviation works have meant the loss of beauty spots, and with
these their bird life. On the hills round Bowral and Berrima you
may first notice the beautiful Rosellas and Lorys coming near less
timidly, crowds of Blue Martens, Goldfinches, and Dollar Birds, with
abundant Diamond Sparrows, Redheads, and other smaller varieties,

Magpies, Hawks, etc. Out from Goulburn, just now, on the road to
Lake Bathurst and Tarago, the fields and undulating plains are one
mass of shining green, and all the wealth of pasture land and bird
life lies close to view. Acre after acre and mile after mile of meadow,
sheltering thousands of sheep and soft new white lambs, wealthy
homesteads well back in the broad acres, and bird life full of sheen
and brightness--the big silvery Grey Crane, the Blue and Scarlet
Rosella, the Green Parakeet, the Dollar Bird, and Plover darting in
and under the hedges that are heavy with the sweet fragrance of
wild briar in October. As you come to the more thickly-wooded land
round Tarago and Braidwood, the flocks of larger birds increase,
White Cockatoos hover over the tall treetops. Braidwood is a pretty
little town of decadent glory and largely deserted, for gold and tin
mining no longer flourish as in the old days, new and more payable
centres having been discovered. But on the thickly-timbered roads
towards the coast the white, shining quartz lies in heaps by the
roadside, and you can still see the gold dredges at work and the races
made in the old-time days for sluicing the gold out of the hills. On
these hills the Parrots are glorious, King Parrots in scarlet and green,
flocks of Gang Gangs, scarlet crowned with bodies of slate grey,
Lorys, Parakeets, and Rosellas in colours of rich crimson and pale
blue, cerise, purple, turquoise, emerald, scarlet, yellow, or eau-de-nil,
flashing in and out of tall trees their beautiful sunlit glory, and
finding a beautiful setting in the long red road with the little white
bridges over streams fringed with drooping willows and backed by
big purple mountains.
Between the ranges and the coast you see the Bronzewing
Pigeon now and then, the Blue Pigeon growing scarcer each year,
and in the gullies you may hear the music of the Lyre Bird that has
escaped the prowling depredations of Master Reynard.
At Bateman's Bay, the Clyde River flows in a broad expanse
to meet the ocean, and a flock of black and wdfite Pelicans fly over
like miniature aeroplanes, while scarlet-footed, scarlet-beaked Seagulls
in utter fearlessness, ride triumphantly over surf and storm wrack.
Farther south, they tell us, you may come by chance on the little

Black-faced Ibises have always had a great charm for me,
and off and on I have kept one or more specimens of these beautiful
birds during the last fifteen or twenty years, but I only succeeded
in breeding them last season, 1916.
When I went to South America in 1911, I of course hoped to
see my favourites in their native country, and twice I had the good
fortune to come across them.
I was riding from Los Sauces to Puren, in Southern Chile, and
there, in a green meadow along a small stream some of these beautiful
grey birds with buff head, neck, and underside, and delicate pink
legs were walking amongst a small flock of Andean geese (Bernicla
melanoptera). The second time I saw some was more to the south,
between Puerto Octay and Puerto Montt.
I was riding along some enclosed fields over a road that wa3
more a series of holes than anything else, and there quite a large
flock of some forty blackfaced Ibises had alighted and were busy
probing the ground for grubs.
In Tierra del Fuego , on the Zente Grande estate, I did not
see the birds, but I saw deserted nests of this species.

They were built on poles that for some purpose or other had
been put on the margin of one of the lakes, and I was told that this
was a very favourite nesting site.
In Punta Arenas, on the Straits of Magellan, I saw a tame
bird of this species which was kept by a professional gardener in his
yard, who told me that he had reared it from the nest and was
keeping it for a monk in that same town, who wanted to stuff it
when it had acquired its full plumage, to put it into his museum.
As I chanced at the time to have one bird of this species alive
at home at Gooilust, I had an interview with the monk in question
and asked him to sell me the bird and not to stuff it! After some
talking, he kindly yielded to my petition, and I had it sent home to
me. It is this bird that bred with my other one last summer, as
fortunately my old bird was a female, and the newcomer a male.
I keep my pair in a large flight aviary with some water in it
and some bushes, and on one of those my birds built a nest of sticks
in which they laid eggs, which they incubated in turn.
After some weeks a young bird was hatched, but it grew very
slowly, and after a couple of weeks was found dead on the ground.
It was about the size of a plucked Pigeon, and almost as naked.
Not long after this the birds laid again, but eggs or young
ones completely disappeared.
This made me rather impatient, and I resolved to interfere if
the birds should lay again.
I was in luck; two eggs were laid in the same nest, and these
I took away and put under a bantam hen.
After an incubation of about twenty-eight days one of the
eggs hatched, the second one being clear.
We left the baby one day under the hen and then my bird-
keeper took charge of it, putting it into a basket with woollen
blankets and a hot-water bottle.
We fed the bird with mashed raw meat and bread and milk,
and when it grew bigger also with small fish.
The little creature was nearly naked when it hatched, with
only a very few bits of down. It had a short bill and little flesh-
coloured legs.
The black throat lappet of the adults was present from the first.

Red-shinmg and Tabuan Parrakeets.
As the little bird grew it became covered with down which
was grey on the body but yellowish-white on the head, neck, and
breast.
The legs now became of a grey colour with a slight purple
tinge.
The bill, which was bluish white, began to grow in length.
After three weeks the feathers commenced to appear, and at
the age of eight weeks the bird was fully feathered and could fly,
being almost the size of the adults.
The first feather dress is similar to that of the adults in the
breeding season, but the buff colour is not quite so brilliant and the
grey feathers of the upperside have buff edgings.
The naked skin of the face is not black but bluish, also the bill.
The legs and feet are grey with a purple tinge.
The bird is in splendid condition, and I think that I owe a
word of praise to my birdkeeper for the very perfect result he
attained.
At first the little bird had to be fed from the mouth, but as he
grew bigger he learnt to feed from the hand if it was held in a
certain way. At two months it would take worms from the ground,
but the meat and bread or fish had still to be given to it from the
hand.
The eggs are white with very few buff spots and are very long
in shape.
The third clutch consisted, as I mentioned above, of two eggs.
How many eggs there were in the two first clutches I cannot tell.
In the breeding season the old birds have rich buff heads and
necks, whilst in autumn, after the moult, these parts are nearly
white.

notes on the subject of three rare Parrakeets--two Red-shining and
one Tabuan--that he is expecting shortly to arrive in England. The

three birds were caught on a sugar plantation and brought to
Australia. The Tabuan is an adult bird and very lively, dancing
about the cage; this is contrary to the behaviour of most Tabuans,
who as a rule sit very still and quiet.
The two Red-shining Parrakeets are an old and a very young
bird. The latter (at the time of writing, November 23rd) was only
about eight weeks old, and was still on soft feed, soaked biscuit,
boiled rice, and beginning to crack canary-seed for itself. A letter,
dated a week later, says the bird is fully on seed ; its diet being
canary, hemp, sunflower, cracked maize, and dry biscuit. Though
so young, this Red-shining Parrakeet was as large and brightly-
coloured as the adult bird, but in the latter the beak and claws are
black and there is a bright orange ring round the eyes as in the King
Parrakeet. In the young bird the beak and claws are yellow and the
eyes a dull black.
A little boy of four, the son of Mr. Colton's friend, made a
great pet of the young bird, whom he called " Shine," and within a
few days of his arrival the Parrakeet would follow the child about
the yard for soaked bread, waddling in the quaint way these Parra-
keets do.
The Red-shining is a very large and handsome Parrakeet, with
a long broad tail. It differs from the Tabuan in being red (on the
head, neck, and underneath) where the Tabuan is maroon, and has a
bright blue band round the back of the neck that the Tabuan lacks.
I have not kept either of these birds, but I have kept the Masked
Parrakeet that is nearly allied, and a more beautiful or delightful pet
than " Dick " would have been hard to find, and he was also singu-
larly intelligent.
Faithfully yours,
Rosie Alderson.

from my hand from the first, was never the least flustered, used to
clean himself when I was close by the cage, and I let him out quite
well and happy when the frost broke."
I caught a cock Blackbird in a stable in the first week of
February which looked half-starved and put him in a cage, where he
at once began to eat and drink. The next morning his feathers were
tight and he looked as well as possible, in spite of having lost flesh.
When I put my hand in the cage he sat perfectly still in a composed
manner and pecked at my fingers. He has never once attempted to
flutter against the bars or show signs of wishing to get away, and on
the third day after being caged he had a bath.
The Duchess of Bedford also relates a very interesting fact of
her experience with a Storm Petrel. The Duchess writes: "My
sailors on the yacht always keep for me any birds which fly against
the lanterns at night. As has often happened, they saved for me a
Storm Petrel. As a rule I had released these birds at once by day-
light and they dropped into the sea, where they floated away, and I
expected were more or less injured. This one, however, I thought
I would keep till night to see what would happen. I took it out of
the basket that morning and offered it its liberty. The bird crept
on to my forefinger and started to clean itself; it lifted its wings to
preen underneath, scratched itself, and w T as absolutely at home. As
I could not feed it, and seeing that it was obviously quite well, I
held it out on my forefinger over the bulwarks, but every time I did
so it crawled back up my arm. So I kept it till dark and then tried
again. It was off like a shot! " H. D. A.

Unfortunately all but one died, but that one bird (a male) I still
possess in February of this year.
During 1915, after losing his breeding plumage, this little
bird remained in eclipse for two years--that is, for most of 1915
and throughout 1916--although he moulted his feathers. Before
Christmas-time of 1916 a very few blue feathers appeared on his
cheeks, so that I thought he was in for a change, hut there was a lull
of some six or seven weeks, during which period the Wren remained
as before. Then, suddenly, in the end of January a complete moult
began, the blue and black feathers appeared rapidly, the tail, etc.,
was moulted.
It has apparently required time for the bird to adjust itself to the
seasons on the other side of the earth to that on which he had been.
Nature could not change all in a moment; a bird who is a native of
Australia, where spring time is autumn in Europe, and vice versa,
cannot be affected at once in another hemisphere in the donning of
a breeding colouring ; hence this total eclipse for about two years,
after which it would seem that things are once again adjusted
according to the correct seasons. This may not, of course, always be
the case, but it certainly has been so in this one.
It is interesting matter for investigation, and perhaps other
members could write on the subject.

NOTES.
Mr. Allen Silver (London Regiment), who up till recently
was a member of the Society, an enthusiastic aviculturist, and
a contributor to the Magazine, has, we greatly regret to record,
been so seriously wounded that it has been necessary to amputate his
right leg. He has written to the Editor with that wonderful spirit
of cheeriness and pluck which possesses our soldiers, telling him of
birds he saw on the battlefields in France, and adding " All being
w T ell, I shall have to start aviculture again one day, and then I hope to
rejoin the Society." We are sure he will be warmly welcomed back.
Amongst many of the more ordinary species of birds which he saw
about the trenches, such as Robins, Wrens, Blackbirds, Woodlark,
Meadow-pipits, etc., he mentions Grey Wagtails, which " often ran
about on the ice in the shell-holes. There is also a dark little hawk,
probably a Merlin, not bigger than a Missel-thrush, that is always in
evidence, and sometimes comes over the top of a trench at such a
rate as to set men dodging, thinking it is some missile."
Messrs. Witherby &amp; Co. have been appointed European
Agents for the 'Journal of the Natural History Society of Siam.'
The work is illustrated with plates and figures, and deals with
all branches of the natural history of that country.

THE MANED GOOSE (ChenonetU Jabata).
By Hugh Wormald.
Our Editor has recently, on more than one occasion, mentioned
his Maned geese,and I can only enthusiastically concur with all the
eulogies he has heaped on them. Unfortunately, like all Australian
birds, they are very difficult to obtain now. Some six years ago I
received a pair from Holland, and though they throve well and were
given every inducement, they made no attempt to go to nest, and this
in spite of the fact that they were always devoted to each other and
exceedingly tame, I am induced to believe that they were too tame,
for in my experience, very tame birds do not breed so easily as less
tame ones. My pair always walked or swam to meet anybody who
went near them, and immediately on reaching one the gander always
drew himself up, threw his head back and uttered his rather feeble
note. Like all geese they are great grass eaters--an advantage over
most birds in these difficult times.
Apart from their very attractive ways, Maned geese, especially
ganders, are very beautiful birds, being a mixture of soft greys and
black, with deep brown head and brilliant green speculum, broadly
edged with white ; for eyes they have the best boot buttons. The
females remind one rather of those of the Summer duck, the jet black
abdomen and under tail coverts of the male give place to pure white
in the female.
I am not aware that Maned geese have ever bred in this
country, though in the spring of 1914 I watched with interest, not

unmixed with envy, a female continually going in and out of a nest-
box in Kew Gardens, but I never heard that there w r as any result.
In 1905 Mr. Blaauw successfully bred this goose, and states
that in their first plumage the young resemble the adult female, but
the dark markings are not so well defined. The goslings in " down "
must be singularly attractive little people
These birds, like Mandarins and Summer ducks, nest in hollow
trees in a wild state, so no doubt require artificial nest-boxes in
confinement.
I kept my pair with full wings for a year or more (and I
believe Mr. Astley's birds were also full winged), but eventually I
pinioned them in case of accidents ; they seldom seem to take the
trouble to fly, but I feared they might leave in the nesting season
or fall a prey to the ever-present lout with a gun. This fate befel a
pair of Carolina ducks which were brought up by their mother, and
I never troubled to catch or pinion them. However they stayed
about for two years; I missed the duck in the spring and was sure
the was incubating, but could not find the nest. After a time she
returned and I concluded she had lost her nest through some accident,
and then heard that she had been " bolted " by a ferret from a rabbit
hole at the foot of a tree and that the keeper had taken the eggs ;
this he denied, but I found out afterwards that he had taken the eggs
(eleven) and hatched them under a bantam, but all the young ones
died. Eventually the pair strayed away to a pond about four miles
away where a shepherd saw 7 them, went home and got a gun, shot
them both on the water, and took them home and ate them ! And
this in pre-war days
A very fine adult male straw-necked Ibis was shot near here
by a gamekeeper in July, 1916; it would be interesting to know where
this bird had escaped from. He was sitting in a hedge close to the
river when the keeper flushed him and was very wild, by the man's
account. I saw the bird after it had been " set up " by a local artist
in taxidermy, but it was not at all badly done.f

ROBINS, AND SOME OTHERS.

Those of us who have their aviary in a country garden have
almost invariably the chance of taming a wild robin, and thus
adding a charming addition to their pets.
It is wonderful how a robin always seems to appear in any
garden, though where he comes from it would be hard to say. In
that most interesting book, ' Memoirs of a Surrey Labourer,' old
Bettesworth, the gardener, thus gives his opinion on robins in
general: " And it's a funny thing, wherever a man's at work there's
sure to be a robin finds him out. I've noticed it often. If I bin at
work in the woods, a robin'd come, or in the harvest field, jest the
same. Hark at 'n twiddlin'! And by-'n-by, when his crop's full,
he'll get up in a tree and sing.&apos;" " The bird seemed to know him, and
he used to call it his ' mate,' because it worked with him wherever
he turned up the soil."
There are several legends about the Robin : here are two,
both very beautiful. The first, I think, comes from Wales, where
it is considered unlucky to cage a robin. It is said that the little
bird was sorry for the souls in purgatory, and petitioned that he
might be allowed to carry them water in his beak to assuage their
thirst. His request was granted ; and so strenuous were the Robin's
efforts that the flames scorched his breast, and ever since it has
been red.
The second legend is an old Breton one. It is said that
a robin followed Christ up the steps to Calvary, and that the bird's
breast became red in trying to extract a thorn from Our Lord's
crown, in the hope of lessening His sufferings. " As a reward for the
little bird's courageous sympathy, God apportioned to him for all time
the mission of attaching himself to those who labour and suffer ' ;

and that is why the Robin is always the companion of man when he
tills the ground " by the sweat of his brow."
It is many years now since we came to this old house, and
my earliest remembrance of a robin here is of one that made its
nest in a wall that was being built when the house was enlarged.
Possibly it was this same robin that was a special pet of the
gardener's, and used to spend much of his time in the greenhouse,
finally building a nest there. Later came the nicest robin we
have ever had. His name was " Bob," and, though small, he was
very bright and graceful; a great contrast to " Bess," his mate,
She was a big bird, very heavily built, with a thick neck and a
stolid toad-like demeanour. We did not much care for her, for she
was a selfish bird and bullied " Bob " very much, whilst he was
devoted to her, and was always most chivalrous when it came to
that severe test of self-sacrifice--a mealworm.
Our garden is divided by an old yew hedge into two parts,
and " Bob " was a top garden robin, for, as you will probably have
noticed, Robins have each their own area, and to trespass is against
etiquette and safety. Robins are hard fighters, but they generally
seem to respect each other's claims and so preserve peace.
In time " Bob " grew very tame. If my sister or I went in
the garden and held out a mealworm, simply calling " Bob," he
would come swinging down from some tall tree, and could take the
mealworm from our hand without alighting on the ground first.
"Bob" followed us all over the garden, and when w T e worked there
was always by us. In the nesting season he w T as very busy. I
forget how many meahvorms he could carry off in his beak at once,
but I think it was about six. He always held them by their heads,
and picked them up so that they stuck out alternately on each side of
his beak. He w T as always very particular hoiv he carried the meal-
worms, and generally had a hard struggle over picking up the last
one, for he dare not open his beak wide for fear of dropping the
other worms. This accident sometimes happened, and then he
would patiently begin to gather them all over again, and having at
last succeeded lie would fly off with his pretty swinging flight to the
nest.

the real work of nesting has begun. Many a time have " Bob " and
"Bess " stood by me, she, stolid and greedy, opening her beak wide
to be fed, and " Bob," looking so pretty and eager, picking up meal-
worm after mealworm and dropping them down her throat. He
was such a generous little bird, and often, to test him, we would
put down an odd number of worms, and it was always " Bess " who
got the largest shai&apos;e.
I shall never forget a tragic little scene that happened one
day as I was feeding the Robins. " Bess " had consumed a
large number of worms, each one brought to her by " Bob," and at
last she was quite satisfied. There was one worm left, and twice
" Bob " offered it to her, holding it to her beak in a very coaxing
way. But " Bess " was obstinate, she kept her beak close shut; she
did not even seem to say " Thank you." It was a nice worm, and
" Bob " evidently thought it a pity to waste it, so he ate it himself
Just as the worm was partly down his throat, "Bess " changed her
mind and solemnly opened her great beak for the worm to be put
down. But, alas ! it was too late, the dainty was just disappearing
and the look on "Bob's" face--evidently anticipating trouble to
come--would have been amusing if one had not felt so sorry for
him.
" Bob " came to a very sad end, after giving us all great
pleasure for several years, and the fault was mine, which made the
sorrow all the more bitter. We had been troubled with mice, and
I had put a break-back trap in the porch (between the double doors)
of an aviary near the house. On a shelf in the porch I kept the
food for my outside flight of Barbary Doves, who used to come at
meal-times to be fed. One day I took out the food and forgot, for
the moment, to close the outer door. It was only open a minute or
two, and suddenly remembering " Boh," who was playing about,
I turned to close it, but too late, our little friend had slipped inside
and was quite dead, caught by his beak in the trap. I am not
ashamed to say I cried bitterly, for I felt by my carelessness I had
murdered my pet. I missed him terribly, and for a long time took
no special interest in other Robins. I had a miserable feeling that
to tame another was only to court disaster.
But Robins will appear on the scene whether you want them

or not, and soon there was a pair in the lower garden that haunted
the aviary door for food. One bird was much more friendly than
the other, but the shy one was very intelligent, and when it saw me
about would call its mate to come, though it dare not approach too
near itself. I never knew what became of this pair, and our next
robin was a single bird who also came to the aviary to be fed. We
found out that he had a nest, built in an old can, in the wood that
runs at the bottom of the orchard. After coming alone for some
time this robin brought a young one, evidently just out of the nest,
and brought for my special inspection. It was pouring with rain,
and the poor little thing looked very draggled and miserable, but the
father bird seemed very proud of it. A day or so after, when I went
down to the aviary a most curious sight met my eyes, so curious that
I should not have believed it unless I had actually seen it. Round
the aviary door were a group of young Robins, five or seven--I forget
now which--but I think the latter number, and outside the ring
were the two old birds keeping the young ones in as a sheep dog does
a flock of sheep. The young ones had been brought to see me, and
to demand breakfast, but they did not understand, and were very
restless trying to break away, and the parents had as much as they
could do to keep the little group intact.
My first thought was for my camera, my second--what was
the use ! By the time I had gone back to the house and brought it
my little friends would be tired and have gone. No; the best plan
was to welcome and to feed them, and just to photograph the pretty
scene on my mind. It was very strange, but these young Robins,
and the parents too, all disappeared, and did not keep to the garden.
Another very nice robin was like " Bob," a top-garden bird.
We could always tell him, for his upper mandible was very badly
broken off, and this accident looked like causing his death, for the
poor little thing when first we noticed him could not pick up his
food off the ground. We did not know how to help him--but as
Charles Reade truly says, " there is a key to every lock," and I
discovered that if the mealworms were dropped on grass that loan
not quite short the robin could pick them up, whereas he was quite
helpless on a hard level surface.
I really think we saved the bird from starvation by helping

him over a critical time, and he rewarded us by becoming very tame.
He was always in and out of the dining-room, coming on the table
for crumbs, or perching on a tall screen.* If the window was not
open he would press his little red breast against the glass and beg to
be let in. Once on Christmas Day he settled on the dish of plum
pudding, looking for all the world like a Christmas card in real life,
and after he was fed it was sweet to listen to his little song of
thanks.
We had this robin about three years. I expect he came to a
tragic end, for he was friendly at the houses of our neighbours, one
of whom kept cats, and he was really too tame for his own safety.
My present robin lives down by the aviary. Every morning
when I go down " Zit " is waiting for me. His favourite perch is a
little apple tree by the door, and on New Year's Day he brought
Mrs. Zit there too. They are both pretty birds, and much alike in
looks. The hen has been several times since, but she is shyer than
the cock.
" Zit " is a hold, impudent little thing ; he slips into the aviary
porch if I leave the door open, and perches on the watering-can
outside waiting for me to come out. He follows me from one aviary
to another, and does not care how close I come to him. I give him
some ground pea-nut every morning, and what is very important
in severe weather, a pot of fresh water--for birds want drink as well
as food.
Besides " Zit " I have quite a little family of small birds who
come in the apple tree to be fed. A few mornings ago there were
altogether, besides the pair of Robins, a pair each of Great Tits, Cole,
Blue, and Marsh Tits, one Starling, and a hen Chaffinch. " Zit "
and the Great Tits have battles, and he sadly bullies my favourites,
the little Marsh Tits, driving them off when they come to feed ; but
they only fly a few feet away, and cling to the bark of a tree, waiting
their chance to try again. I find the Tits are very fond of sunflower
seed, and it is very interesting to see the four varieties feeding together
and to note the difference in each.
* [It is curious how superstitious many people are with regard to a robin coming
into a house. A lady we know is quite alarmed, feeling sure it presage
misfortune. Has this to do with the legendary connection of the robin and
the Crucifixion of Our Lord?--E d.]

An Old Australian Birdlover,
My brother is very fond of birds, and we have many interesting
kinds in the garden, for he always encourages them. Only a few
days ago (in January) a Great-spotted Woodpecker was in a tree close
to the house, and we have had at different times the Green Wood-
pecker, the Tree Creeper, Nut-hatch, Golden-crested Wren, Kestrel,
Pheasants, and Partridges, besides numbers of the more ordinary
garden birds. I once counted a flock of seventy Green Finches all
feeding together on summer rape-seed scattered on the lawn. Rape
is a very good seed to give (the summer variety) as the Sparrows do
not care for it.
On New Year's Day the Rooks were very busy in the wood,
coming and repairing their nests, making one feel the winter was
passing and that each day was bringing the welcome spring-time a
little nearer.
&apos;[ Note, March 19f/u--Since writing the above one of the Great Tits has become very
fearless and tame, following us all over the garden, and coming readily on
our hands for food.]
MY MOREPORKS.
By An Old Australian Birdlover.
The article by Dr. Renshaw on the Podargus in the October
number of the ' Avicultural Magazine ' has been very pleasant
reading to me. These birds, known in Australia as Moreporks or
Frogmouths, have been among my favourite pets for many years.
At the present moment four of them are enjoying my enforced
hospitality, greeting me each time I pass their cage. To see them
behind their wooden gratings stretching their necks and opening
their hugh mouths is a funny sight indeed. I feed them in the
morning just when I feed my other meat-eating birds, though being
nocturnal they ought to be fed at night I suppose. They know the
time and the plate, indicating their desire to be fed by low grunts.
There is no trouble in keeping these quaint birds in captivity.
When I open the door of the cage in which my birds are housed*
they open their huge mouths immediately, anxious to receive the
lump of meat which constitutes their daily meal. It is grabbed most
willingly and gulped down in jerks. Once in a way they are treated

to a sparrow from which I have removed the sharp part of the bill
and tail feathers. If not very hungry they pound the bird against
the branch or perch ; more often they just gulp it down like meat.
They are exceedingly fond of mice, and become quite excited when
they see one ; but what they like, above all, are the big Elephant
moths. Whenever I bring them one alive they will all try together
to tear it out of my fingers, yet if dropped on the floor they will not
pick it up. I don't quite see the necessity for soaking the meat
before feeding, as Dr. Renshaw suggests ; I have had my birds for
years and have never known them to have had a drink yet. The
only time they ever see water is when it rains, and that is extremely
seldom, and is out of their reach. When newly caught there is, of
course, as with most meat and insect-eating birds a little trouble to
induce them to take the food out of one's hands, but with a little
patience and perseverance this shyness or obstinacy is quickly over-
eome. This trouble may be the reason why these birds are not kept
even in the Zoos of Australia. Once quieted down, it just takes less
than a minute to feed a bird ; it takes me longer, because I talk and
play with my birds when I have time. Their mouth is very large
and their looks most awe-inspiring, yet they could hardly pinch one's
fingers, and are as peaceful as a dove. Their plumage has been
described by Dr. Renshaw, but not their eyes, which are their point
*of beauty. These are of an enormous size and perfectly round. In
the old birds the pupil is coal-black, the iris of a light old gold
colour and very wide; in the young birds the pupil is a dark blue
and the iris a mottled yellow. There seems to be no difference in
the plumage between the sexes ; the only way to distinguish them is
by the iris, which in the male birds is adorned by an orange-brown
ring round the edge of it, as with the Kagus. The eyes so motionless
and full of lustre give one the impression as if they were of glass and
certainly have neither the vicious or cruel impression one might
expect from the general appearance of these birds. Generally the
birds sit upright, owl-like, with the neck deeply set in the shoulders,
yet they will often rest stretched out upon the limb upon which they
sit, and in that attitude will close the upper eyelid, only giving the
impression that they had just half an eye. When asleep they close
both lids which are heavily coated with down. I love to see my

birds when in a temper or a fright, which I can always create by
showing them a stuffed cat or dog. They sit then like a cat, with
hunched backs, ready one might think for a spring, and with a
terrifying expression--Mephistopheles is not in it.
They are no longer plentiful, but it is still possible to get then)
as they are most trusting birds, allowing one to come right up to
them. Their call is a kind of booming noise emitted in quick succes-
sion. Years ago they were very plentiful in the district in which I
am living. One would meet them any evening and anywhere on
post or branch to which one was directed by their call. Now they
are gone. The last of them probably joined the happy land last year.
The long dry spell caused food for birds and animals to become very
scarce, and as a consequence a pest of Flying Foxes visited the
orchards and gardens in this and other districts. Guns and pea-
rifles destroyed all on the wing, and the Moreporks went with the
rest! Since then I have not seen one, although few know the bush
as well as I do. A few years ago a pair of Moreporks, which had
been about my home for a long time, made their nest in a tree close
to my fence in the adjoining paddock. Built about 30 feet from the
ground it consisted of a few sticks across the horizontal fork of a
branch. When the bird was sitting on the nest it was quite impos-
sible to distinguish her from the nest itself. The young in their first
stages were covered with the most delicate creamy down one would
wish to see--tiny balls of fluff. Watching them grow I had made up
my mind to experiment with them and teach them to pick up their
food from the ground, as I do with my Bee-eaters. To my inexpres-
sible disgust coming home one afternoon I saw some boys standing
at the bottom of the tree, and I overheard one saying, " look at its
bunged-up eye." The rascals had climbed the adjoining tree, hit the
old bird which was covering the young, and destroyed the babies. I
was able to save the old bird, but I suppose I shall never get a chance
again to observe these interesting birds so close to my home. I don't
see why these birds should not breed in captivity like the Jackasses,
etc., if given a flight to themselves, and it is a pity that zoological
gardens will not trouble to procure and keep such an interesting
species, which, although nocturnal, seem to be always awake, seldom
even dozing in the daytime.

The Editor of ' The Emu ' very kindly gave permission to us
to use articles, etc., from that most interesting periodical, and we
take the opportunity of reproducing a beautiful photograph of a
group of Chestnut-breasted Finches coming to drink at a fountain.
Are the days gone by when aviculturists had the great
pleasure of seeing in the dealers' collections quantities of these
pretty little Finches, along with Diamond, Parson, Cherry, Long-
tailed, Pectoral, Gouldian Finches and others?
The Parson Finches were merry little birds, jumping up and
down and swelling out their velvet black gorgets, proudly carrying a
hay stalk to show to a mate.
There cannot be many in England now.
It seems such ages ago since the days of peace and plenty,
those days when one journeyed down past the Tower of London to
St. George's Street, past the great docks where the ships came in
and out with no fear of submarines and mines and terrors of war
waged at sea bv a cruelly ruthless and unscrupulous enemy; past
folk of all nations, many of whom were of unprepossessing appear-
ance, past frowsy women sitting on their doorsteps or indulging in
fierce altercations and intemperance, until one's cab drew up at
Jamrach's and Abraham's shops, where the grimy windows were
filled within by piled up cages of parrots and many other birds.
Those days when, on entering, one sometimes saw a cage full of New
Zealand Tu&apos;i birds, uttering water-bubble notes, as well as such gems
as Turquoisine, Paradise, and elegant Parrakeets; days when
one ruined oneself in succumbing to these irresistible temptations,
when one drove away surrounded by travelling-cages containing
birds which one may never see again.
There were blue-eved Satin Bower birds, there were red
Cardinals and American Bluebirds, Nonpareils and Indigo birds and
all the rest.
And now " by Babylon's waters." . . .!

THE CELEBEAN MALEO.
By Graham Renshaw, M.D., F.R.S.E.
One of the outstanding features of aviculture is the erratic
and irregular supply of specimens. A bird may be imported for
years, so cheap does it become that it is almost despised, then
suddenly it cannot be obtained at any price, and its place is taken
by some other species. Rarity in the market does not postulate
rarity in the native habitat, the catchers may have no inquiry for the
particular bird, so they limit themselves to those which they know
to be in request. One may instance many South American forms,
common enough in their tropical home, yet never seen alive in this
country; in fact, this paradox obtains in every quarter of the globe.
There are some species which are not only abundant in their own
country, but are of great zoological interest; they are easy to keep,
for they can stand a long sea voyage and the climate of Europe
afterwards. Yet so little are they known in captivity that the
arrival of one of them, even in the largest collections, is hailed almost
as a return of the phoenix ; the curious Maleo birds which swarm on
the coast of Northern Celebes are cases in point.
The Celebean Maleo is quaint yet very handsome. About
the size of a large Guinea-fowl, it has the head hare and the neck
nearly so; the wings are ample, the tail is carried raised and slightly
folded like a Silver Pheasant's, the broad, powerful feet are partly
webbed. The bare head is decorated with a curious rounded casque
composed of spongy honeycombed bone like the helmet of a Hornbill,
and there is a smaller projection in front of each eye. The colora-
tion of the Maleo is pleasing; the head and throat are dark brown,
the wings are brownish-black, and the tail is black glossed with green.
The underparts are lovely pinkish salmon-colour during life, but in
museum skins this gradually fades till the specimen is quite bleached.
The bill is pea green, with a red culmen ; the legs and feet are

grey, and the claws yellow. The Maleo has well been called a noble
bird, but only those who have seen it alive can appreciate its true
beauty.
The writer would call attention to an error which has hitherto
disfigured every description of the Celebean Maleo. The casque on
the occult is bright blue during life , not black as always stated -
The black colour seen in museum skins is due to drying, and is not
found during life ; it is unfortunate that ornithologists have not
noted this in drawing up their descriptions, which should always be
done from live or at most recently shot birds. Taxidermists in
setting up this species have followed the ornithologists, and the
writer is unacquainted with any museum in which the Maleo is cor-
rectly represented ; one finds the occiput daubed over with black
paint, which is devoutly supposed to reproduce the tint of the live
bird. The Maleo is, in fact, similar to the Wilson Bird of Paradise,
in which the bare blue skin of the head fades to leaden colour after
death. Other instances are the bright wattles of Paradigalla
carunculata and the gorgeous neck patterns of many Cassowaries.
The only satisfactory method of representing these hues in museum
specimens is to excise the blackened skin, replacing it with wax
correctly tinted after a water-colour sketch made during life.
Some years ago, by the kind permission of Dr. Kerbert, the
writer photographed a Maleo which was living in the Zoological
Gardens at Amsterdam. The bird was kept in a roomy aviary, with
an outdoor flight and plenty of branches to perch on ; it was in first-
class condition, and seemed as hardy as any Pheasant. " The Maleo
sits with its head drawn in," wrote Dr. Meyer many years ago ; and
this Amsterdam specimen looked very fine as it sat dozing on its
perch, the pink breast being beautifully displayed. The flight was
roofed entirely with wire netting, so that the bird could enjoy
every ray of sunshine ; perhaps this accounted for its fine condition.
Only a few examples have been brought alive to England.
The first Maleo was received at the Zoological Gardens in 1848, but
nothing seems to have been recorded about it, though perhaps it was
sent over with some Brush Turkeys which were received the same
year. The next was a private gift from Captain Parish, R.N. He
had acquired it by a happy accident, having obtained it when at St.

Helena from a ship which had come from Java. On November 6th,
1871, this most desirable addition was safely unpacked at the Zoo.
On July 5th, 1876, a third Maleo was purchased for the same collec-
tion, and a fourth was bought on May 24th of the following year.
These later specimens were probably those which were studied by
Prof. Garrod; for, in a paper on avian anatomy, published in 1878,
he states that he had dissected three examples of the Maleo.
Although the Maleos turned out by one of the rajahs on the
Sanghir Islands multiplied exceedingly, the present species does not
appear to have bred when brought to Europe ; too few have as yet
been imported to give the species a chance. Perhaps this interesting
event will some day take place in a Dutch Zoological Garden, for the
visitor to the collections of Amsterdam and Rotterdam will notice
many rarities from the East Indies exhibited therein. Probably the
Dutch colonists have many opportunities of sending home these
rarities, which live, as it were, before their very eyes. In 1909 the
writer observed at Amsterdam several examples of a rare form of
Anoa (dwarf Antelope-buffalo), a Rhinoceros Hornbill from Sumatra,
a lesser Bird of Paradise from New Guinea, and a fine specimen of
that almost unknown beast--the Sumatran Elephant. All these are
distinctively East Indian forms, and it seems a pity that the
collector of the Anoas did not send some Maleos as well. Since the
chicks are left untended by their parents they would not require to
be fed bn any specially prepared diet, so that they would be easy to
keep ; youngsters that can fly strongly on the very day of hatching
would be well able to fend for themselves. It seems that an enter-
prising collector, by persevering digging in the hot sand of the
Maleo-pits, might make a good haul of almost hatched eggs, or even
take the chicks just hatched; these in Europe would be great
rarities, and would command a ready sale in the avicultural market.
A Maleo egg now before me is much elongated in shape, and of a pale
reddish buff colour.

<bodyText confidence="0.999082542857143" page_id="9411827"  page_num="Page 171" year="" vol="">
By Dr. Arthur G. Butler.
The fact that different groups of birds exhibit enormous
variations of ability in their artistic efforts must be patent to all who
*compare the perfect work of a Long-tailed Tit with that of a Wood-
pigeon ; but it seems to me that in cases where one sex only acts as
architect there is no evidence to prove that the opposite sex is not
equally gifted with the capability of nest-construction.
Then again, in the case of birds which do not build, but lay
their eggs in the nests of other birds, it is more than probable that
other reasons than incapacity are the cause of this behaviour.
Although many of the Cuckoos are parasitical in their habits, the
Ground-cuckoos and other groups build nests and rear their own
young ; therefore it has been suggested that, being polyandrous
birds, the hens of our Cuckoo " are obliged to wander in search of
birds of the opposite sex " (Seebohm, ' British Birds,' vol. ii, p. 382).
The fact that I have seen a hen Cuckoo pursued by three cocks does not
seem to support this conclusion, but seems rather to argue in favour
of the view that the hen Cuckoo is so constantly pestered by the
attentions of numerous suitors that she has no time to spare for
nest-construction.
This polyandry in the Cuckoo does not appear to interfere
with the abundance of the species, since, as Darwin argues (' Descent
of Man,' 2nd ed., p. 904), where the number of males greatly exceeds
that of females it is evident that none of the latter will lack
husbands. In the case of insects we may notice that where the
males are far more numerous than the females (as, for instance, in the
case of our common Vapourer-moth (Orgyia a?itiqua) the species is
very abundant.
As we are all aware, in many groups of birds only one sex
busies itself in nidification; while the other sex often calmly looks
on, or at most pays only casual visits of inspection during the
progress of the work, which it sometimes even hinders by officious
meddling. In other groups both sexes are engaged upon part or the
whole of the building.
Now, in cases where only one sex does the work, we must not

Dr. Arthur G. Butler,
conclude that both sexes are not equally capable ; for I have had
definite evidence that they are so; thus, as stated in my ' Foreign
Birds for Cage and Aviary ' (vol. i, p. 196), owing to the ill-health of
the male of a pair of Orange Weavers (Pyromclana franciscana)
which I purchased in 1885, the hen started to build a nest for herself
which she had almost completed when both sexes died, and I had the
pair mounted with the hen at the entrance of the nest as I had seen
her when occupied in building it.
Then, again, in 1895, as recorded in 1 British Birds with their
Nests and Eggs' (vol. ii, p. 68), the hen of a pair of Goldfinches in
one of my aviaries built a nest in a Hartz cage, laying and hatching
out four eggs, of which three left the nest; but before this occurred
the male built a second nest which the hen inspected, approved of,,
and, immediately after the flight of her first family, started laying
again in the second nest, leaving her husband to complete the
bringing up of the newly-fledged youngsters.
Although many male birds provide the materials with which
their wives build, two hens associated in a cage will collect their own
material and together build a very satisfactory nest, as was the case
with my two Rock-sparrows. On the other hand, where it is the
habit of the group to which they belong for both sexes to unite their
labours in the construction of their home, the absence of one sex
appears to be fatal; thus in the genus Icterus (typical hang-nests), as
with the somewhat similar Weavers of the genus Ploceus, both sexes
appear to contribute to the plaiting of the remarkable pensile nests.
It is therefore not surprising that my female Hangnest, although
she made repeated attempts to do so, utterly failed to build a
receptacle for her eggs and eventually deposited the material in a
nest-box and dropped her eggs on the floor. I was afraid to intro-
duce my male bird into her tiny aviary lest they might kill each
other; for though the height of her compartment measured about
9 ft. in the centre, the floor-space covered only about 3 |ft. square.
Now 7 , we know that in the Fringillidce and some other groups
the male only, or both sexes conjointly, collect nesting materials, and
the hen only utilises them in nest-construction ; then again, in the
case of the Fire-weavers ( Pyromelana ) and some others, the males
normally both collect the materials and build the nest; in the

Ploccine Weavers the males also collect and build, until only the
cup to contain the eggs is lacking to complete the structure; then
the offices of the hen are requisitioned, and she, sitting inside upon the
transverse bar which divides the double opening of the uncompleted
nest and her husband on the outside at the back, they pass the
grasses backwards and forwards to each other, weaving them into a
firm receptacle.
Whether both sexes of the Hangnests collect the materials as
well as working together on the construction of the nest I do not
know, but from what we know of other sociable birds it seems
probable: it is certainly the case with the Waxbills, and I think
also with the Grassfinches and Mannikins.
It appears to me that the explanations for these varied
methods must differ in the case of each group ; thus the hens of
the typical Finches and perhaps of most of the small European
perching birds, are impelled to build because they feel the need for
a suitable cradle for their eggs; whereas the cock birds are not
conscious of any such need, though they may be so far interested as
to be willing to choose a site for the nest and prepare the where-
withal to build it.
In the case of the more impetuous, amorous, and often poly-
gamous Weavers, the males build as an inducement to the females
to start housekeeping, and frequently produce far more nests than
are required ; perhaps in order to give the future bride a choice of
residences. The habit of multiplying nests appears in this way to
have become so ingrained in their nature that a supply of building
material will start many Weavers nest-building when no hen birds
are present to make use of the structures ; consequently the nests
built by Ploccine Weavers, when unpaired are always imperfect, in
my experience, the assistance of the hen bird being required to
enable the cock to complete the cup.
I have seen it authoritatively asserted (so far as I remember,
in an article published in the ' Transactions ' of the Linnean or
Zoological Society by an Indian Civil Servant*), that cock Weavers
are in the habit of purposely building these unfinished nests as
* I am afraid this is very vague; but it is many years since I saw the statement,

Winter in Holland.
shelters in which to roost; doubtless they might prove useful during
a tropical thunderstorm ; but I do not, for one moment, think that
the birds have that object in view when they weave them. I feel
certain that if equal numbers of both sexes were available to do the
work none of these nests would be imperfect.
It is easy to understand why sociable and mutually affectionate
birds like Waxbills should share the labour of nest-building and one
can quite understand that the complicated plaiting in the pensile
nests of Hangnests could only be produced by the two sexes working
in unison.
I have pointed out elsewhere that although the different
groups of birds have the character of their typical nests impressed
upon their brains, and therefore instinctively build the same types
after the lapse of centuries ; nevertheless, they are perfectly capable
of altering the whole character of their architecture to accommodate
it to changed conditions ; moreover, in the case of our House-sparrow
we know that two totally dissimilar types are common, the well-
formed bag-like nest built in trees being utterly dissimilar in character
from the almost shapeless collection of rubbish which it piles up when
it builds in holes.*
I think, therefore, that we may safely conclude that different
circumstances decide the constructional impulses in birds, and not
the presence or absence of capacity in either sex ; although it is
probable that inexperience in the selection of the most suitable
materials by young birds may account for the flimsy and faulty char-
acter of some of the nests which one meets with from time to time.
WINTER IN HOLLAND.
Mr. Blaauw writes :
You have no idea what I have gone through during this cold
spell. All the more delicate South American and South African and
Australian Waterfowl had to be taken indoors. The bird houses and
houses of the antelopes and zebras had all to be heated, and there
was hardly any coal to be got. We pulled through, however, some-
how, and now the thaw has happily set in. Here also many wild

birds died, and the wild fowl suffered most of all, all the water being
frozen over with a thick layer of ice (autos over the Zuiderzee !). I
hear lots of wild duck of many species were picked up dead or
dying. Any amount of Blackbirds died here in my park, although
they were fed when possible. The poor Waterhens were seen every-
where the picture of misery.
My redbreasted Goose that I told you had been operated on, has
recovered, I am glad to say.
There is a plague of Starlings; thousands upon thousands go
to sleep in my bamboos and in the shrubbery, spoiling everything.
So far I have not been able to get rid of them. I wonder what they
find to feed on. Those that were killed are-fat! I picked up a
dead Kingfisher that always frequented my pond near the house ;
very sad ! The pair of them had a sad mishap last summer. They
had a nest with eggs (quite a lot) in a bank a little above waters mark,
and then the waters rose abnormally (result of the war) and swamped
the poor Kingfishers. They were not drowned, but the eggs were lost!

This appallingly severe winter must have been the means
of destroying countless birds of many species, but probably none
have suffered more than the lovely little Long-tailed Titmice.
Mr. Galloway wrote to say that he believed, as far as he could
judge, that they are all done for in the neighbourhood of Reading, the
long frost, with the piercing easterly gales, having been too much
for such frail little bodies. It is now that they should have been
building their wonderful nests, certainly structures to excite one's
admiration in any case, but that admiration is enhanced when one
thinks of the minute bills which carry the materials and shape them
so compactly. Nature and mankind seem to have gathered themselves
up of late for a universal crusade of destruction ; as for the birds, it
will be some time before they can recover their normal numbers.
The middle of March! I have not heard a Missel-Thrush
tune up yet, and not until the 13th did I catch the sound of a Song-
Thrush's notes. The snowdrops were in full bloom at that date where,
in other winters, they are nearly over, and hardly a crocus to be seen,

Dr. E. Hopkinson,
With Woodpeckers and others starving, and no doubt dying,
it was curious to see a pair of Australian Crested Doves, which, of
course, were fed, go through that bitter weather unscathed. They
are practically wild birds, having been loose for three years.
The Blackbirds besieged one every time one appeared with
food for them. Wagtails must have suffered.
Most winters the ploughmen are at work in February, which
enables many birds to obtain insect food, but this year the land was
frost-bound.
I suppose that fruit-growers will rejoice at the decimation in
the birds' ranks.
Will they continue to do so when they find an increase in
insects, though no doubt the latter have been also largely destroyed.
Golden-crested Wrens ! What has happened to &apos;them 7^ Surely
they have met with the same fate as the Long-tailed Titmice!
The whole creation seems to have groaned and travailed in pain !
[Note. --Mr. Galloway has sent an article on Long-tailed Titmice, which was unfor-
tunately too late for publication; it will, we hope, appear [in the May
magazine.--E d.]

On a blue-grey variety of the Hook.
A BLUE-GREY VARIETY OF THE ROOK.
By E. W. H. Blagg.
On May 18th last I obtained a very remarkable variety of
the Book. It was a young bird which was not quite old enough to
be able to fly, and I found it perched on a bush close to the Rookery
here, it having evidently just flopped down from the nest. In its
colouring this bird is very similar to a blue Andalusian fowl. I sent
it off at once to Messrs. Rowland Ward, Ltd., to be set up, and
while in their possession Mr. F. W. Frohawk has made a most
admirable drawing of the bird, which is very effectively reproduced in
the ' Field ' of September 2nd, to which I would refer your readers
who are interested in this very rare and striking variety, and I
cannot do better than quote Mr. Frohawk's detailed description of
the bird : " The head and neck, which are the darkest parts, are dull
purplish-brown with faint dusky bars; back and rump drab-grey;
wings and tail light ashen-grey transversely barred w T ith purplish-
brown, forming broad submarginal bands on the primaries and
secondaries as well as on the primary and secondary coverts. There
are also indistinct narrow median bars on all these feathers and on
the mantle and scapulars also; the tail and upper tail coverts are
conspicuously barred; the rump is less distinctly marked. The
ashy-grey ground colour of the under parts is also mottled with
dusky bars. The bill is deep horn brown, the legs and feet are black
and the irides hazel."
On May 20th a second young bird, precisely similar in colour
and markings, also flopped down from the nest. This bird I tried to
keep alive, with the intention of sending it to the London " Zoo/&apos;
but it was very thin and weak and did not long survive. I have
presented it to the North Staffordshire Natural History Museum.
I strongly suspect that the parent birds ceased to feed these
two youngsters, owing to their peculiar appearance, and that starva-
tion was the cause of their flopping down from the nest, for this
year we had no youngsters of ordinary colouring tumbling down
from the trees at perching time. If there are rough winds a good
many young birds generally get sent down, but this season the
weather was fairly calm at the time the youngsters left their nests.

It is practically certain that both the parents of these two young
grey Kooks were normal coloured birds, for had they been otherwise
I should have been sure to notice the birds, for their nests are only a
short distance from the windows of this house, and we had only about
thirty nests this year ; and, though I have no actual proof of the
fact, it is a moral certainty that both young birds came from the
same nest.
I have a strong suspicion that a mysterious bird which I saw
in the early summer of last year was a similarly coloured grey Rook ;
it was the size and had the dight of a young Kook, but in the distance
looked a very strange colour; I followed it for some little time,[but
could never get very near to it, and finally lost all trace of it.&apos;^ Need-
less to say, I shall keep a sharp look out for young grey Rooks next
breeding season !
Since I met with these two young birds I have been in corre-
spondence with several ornithologists, and have searched all the bird
books I have access to, and apparently there is a record of a some-
what similarly coloured bird which was obtained in 1816 (see
Stevenson's 'Birds of Norfolk,' i, p. 277) ; this bird is described as
being mottled over with black; I should describe my bird as being
mottled over with dark grey rather than black. Mr. Whitaker, of
Rainworth, Notts, has a lavender-grey Rook in his collection,&apos; but it
is without the very distinct mottled and barred appearance of my bird.
Of course, albino and pied Rooks are fairly common, and there is a
well-known variety of varying shades of brown, of which latter phase
of variation there is a very nice living specimen at the " Zoo " at the
present time.

This is what our Editor wrote to me during the long frost in
January and February, and I hope all our members had similar kind
thoughts respecting our feathered friends, but sympathy should be
shown in deeds as well as in words, and therefore it is well to con-
sider, when severe winter weather covers the earth with snow, how
to keep at least some of the birds in our neighbourhood from
starving.

On the poor wild birds.
During one hard winter, when every scrap of food was fought
for in my garden and the Starlings seemed likely to secure almost
every scrap while the weaker but more pleasing birds could scarcely
obtain a morsel, I set a caravan-trap and speedily caught thirteen
Starlings, which I turned into a large cage and fed during the winter,
releasing all but one (a remarkably well-formed cock bird) in the
spring ; that gave my other garden visitants a better chance of survival.
At the present time we are ordered to be economical in the
matter of food, and if I had not always been a small eater (excepting
when on a steamer crossing to the Continent) the present price of
food would alone he sufficient to make me so ; but, with all care in
the consumption of edibles, there must always be a certain amount
of refuse--fat, skin, bones, burnt crusts, and odds and ends of
vegetables, all of which are eagerly welcomed by the fowls of the
air, and which, if placed in a pan, need not disfigure one's garden.
Perhaps bones and half cocoanuts suspended below branches
and pergolas are not particularly ornamental, but they are a great
boon to Titmice and are easily removed at the end of the winter;
moreover, it is a pleasure to watch the little acrobats feeding. By
the w T ay, when the two halves of a cocoanut have been cleaned out
by the birds, they can be taken down, filled with melted fat, and
replaced ; the Tits are equally pleased with the latter, and I suspect
that it is more sustaining than the nut.
If one has many insectivorous birds there is always quite a
lot of yesterday's food left in the various food-receptacles ; and this,
if placed in a pan out of doors is eagerly pounced upon by the wild
birds and devoured to the last crumb. One winter I caught far more
cockroaches than I needed for my insectivorous birds; so, after
taking the few I required, I put the beetle-traps outside and they also
were soon cleared of their contents.
Excepting when snow has fallen very heavily, there are always
some seeds to be obtained from dead weeds, grass-panicles, etc.,
which rise above the surface; nevertheless, all seeds for wffiich one
has no use are welcome to our winter visitors. At one time I used to
have many seed-samples sent to me, some of which I should hesitate
to give to aviary birds, but they were gratefully accepted by their
wild brethren. I am rather shy of giving niger-seed (of which I still

have a good deal), as I believe it to be positively'^injurious to Finches ;
I have tried it several times, but my birds have always sickened and
died shortly afterwards.
Now, it may be asked why I give to birds in freedom food
which I refuse to those in aviaries. A wild bird has to work hard
for its living and must be constantly on the alert to avoid predaceous
foes, so that it is constantly taking violent exercise, thus its
digestion is more active than that of the aviary bird ; moreover, in
winter it is exposed to intense cold and therefore can assimilate fatty
food which might prove too heating in a warmed enclosure ; an
Esquimaux transplanted even to our apology for a climate would prob-
ably be no longer able to digest whale blubber, tallow, and lamp-oil.
There are generally plenty of berries about here ; in the front
of the house I have crimson may, mountain ash, holly, and pyra-
canthus ; and in the back garden crimson may, hawthorn, and ivy;
so I think probably Redwings, Fieldfares, and other Thrushes do
pretty well on my premises during the winter. I don't know whether
snowberries are eaten, but there are always some in the garden ;
I don't much care for them in the rockery, where they have grown.
In severe, cold weather I expect that Woodpeckers obtain a
meagre subsistence from stray acorns, nuts, and berries, but how the
unfortunate Kingfishers manage to survive a long frost I cannot
imagine ; the question is--Do they ? Whenever rivers are frozen
over, how are these birds able to secure fish ? If one could but do it,
what a kindness it would be to domesticate all our wild Kingfishers
during the winter months, turning them loose again in the spring !
But just think of the size of the aviary and aquarium which would
be needed, and the thousands of minnows and other small fish ! I
fear we shall have to be content to let the poor things die; they
ought all to migrate at the approach of winter ; I would if I could.

Letters of regret for non-attendance were received from
Dr. Butler, Dr. Amsler, and Mr. Trevor-Battye.

were read and approved.
Mr. Meade-Waldo read a letter from the publishers, Messrs.

the Council.
The Hon. Secretary reported that all medals owing to members
had been duly engraved, sent out, and acknowledged
A letter was received from Mr. Astley tendering his resigna-
tion as Editor after next October, but at the urgent request of the
Council Mr. Astley kindly consented to remain in office for the
duration of the War, should it be prolonged over October. He has
now acted as editor for over four years.
Mr. Astley announced that the Duchess of Bedford had
kindly given permission for a water-colour drawing of Red-breasted
Geese to be used as a plate for the ' Magazine.' The offer was
accepted with thanks.
The date of the Summer Meeting was then considered,
Mr. Trevor-Battye (in his letter of regret for non-attendance)
suggested that the date of future meetings might be arranged for a
Tuesday, that day being the day before the meetings of the Zoological
Society, so that for anyone who was a member of both Societies, one
journey only might he needed for both attendances. Owing, however,
to the few days when the Offices can be lent for the meetings of the
Avicultural Society, it was decided that this proposition was probably
not feasible.
It was decided to hold the Summer Meeting, with garden
party and tea as usual, some time during the first week in July, the
date to be arranged and announced later, July 6th being suggested.

CORRESPONDENCE.
ULTRAMARINE FINCH, ETC., OR COMBASOU.
Sir, --May I point out that my notes on this bird * should have been headed
Ultramarine Finch or Combasou, and not Long-tailed Combasou. Readers must
have noticed that H. ultramarina was the incorrect scientific term for Vidua
hypocherina, only casually referred to in the article. Whether this was my fault
or not I cannot say, because I have not my old MSS. by me. In any case, it is
as well to call notice to the error.
The notes on American Warblers, by Lady William Cecil, were a source of
interest to me. I have seen skins of many of them, and in an American bird book
I have, many are figured and talked about in a popular fashion, and I had often
thought how charming it would be to see or have them alive. I am delighted at
Miss Chawner's success with Y.W. Sugar-birds, because, although not quite
absolute, to have gone so far is really "great." Allen Silver.
THE EARLY HISTORY OF THE CANARY.
Sir,--I am much indebted to one of our French members (who, however,
does not favour me with his name), for a cutting from ' Le Cheml, Le Ponlailler et
I/Echo de L'Elevage Reunis ' of June 26th, 1913, giving a short account of the
early history of the Canary, and referring in particular to a very early French
work on the subject by Hervieux de Chanteloup. My anonymous correspondent
has added a marginal note to the effect that the second edition of this old work,
entitled ' Nouveau Traite des Serins de Canarie,' was published in 1713, and, if
this date is correct, it is evident that the ' Fancyer's Delight,' which was published
in 1711, the author of which claims priority over any other English work in
aviculture, was anticipated by an earlier French bird-book. On this our allies are
to be heartily congratulated.
Hervieux de Chanteloup seems to have been the first to suggest the some-
what fanciful derivation of " serin " from " siren," on the ground of the fascination
of the song of the Canary, and Prof. Newton, in his ' Dictionary of Birds,'
accepts this derivation. I hardly think, however, that the majority of classical
scholars would follow Newton and Hervieux without further evidence, and the
' Oxford Dictionary ' describes the etymology of the word as " doubtful." Besides,
the original Canary did not sing well. [The ivild canary has a charming song.-- Ed.]
I must try to find a copy of this old work in the British Museum, for it
seems to be most interesting. There is, for instance, a delightful description
(quoted by " Le Chenil") of the arrival every spring and autumn of the Swiss
dealers, bringing consignments of Canaries from the Tyrol to Paris. They used

I must tender my very best thanks to my correspondent.

hear that the survivor of my Red-throated Tree Partridges (Arboricola rufigularis)
died on February 2nd.
I got the birds from India nearly nine years ago, and when imported they
were fully adult, so this bird has had a long life.
About their limited nesting operations I wrote to the Magazine some years
ago, and would now only add that these Tree Partridges are quite as easy to keep
as any other kinds I have had, and are amongst the most interesting of birds.
They are great nesters, and the bird that died the other day--although
alone--nested and laid every year. Yours faithfully,
Woodlands, Retford. C. Barnly Smith.

AN EFFICACIOUS MOUSE-TRAP.

<bodyText confidence="0.998598882352941" page_id="9411842"  page_num="Page 184" year="" vol="">
I am sending a very humble but useful suggestion for mouse-traps which I
have found most excellent in my aviaries, and into which no birds, whether flying or
ground ones, can get in. I find mice such scourges, besides being very wasteful,
especially in these bad times.
Take a fairly substantial wooden box and cut in each of the four sides
a small hole an inch square, for this is not large enough for any birds to get
in, but amply so for mice, which run into the dark on every occasion.
Place this box upside down with the holes on the level of the ground,
having previously set four traps to go under it.
Use metal break-back traps of the common type, for these are preferable
to the wooden ones, as the mice gnaw the latter.
Use butter or lard smeared on the spring-wires, not lumps of cheese, which
the mice can carry off without springing the traps. If the wire is smeared with
the bait mentioned, they cannot do this, and are more certain to spring the traps.
We often catch twenty-nine or thirty mice a night in this way. The box which
covers the traps is about a foot square.

THE COMING OF THE NIGHTINGALE.

By W. E. Teschemaker.
Our Editor having asked me to postpone the completion of
my recent article, in view of his wish to secure some " copy " to
accompany two most excellent photographs of our greatest song-
bird, I have as a matter of course acceded to his request. He has
not confided to me the particular object he had in view, but the
moment is certainly appropriate, for "spring is y- cumen in," and
the Nightingale is presumably just reaching our shores. In any
ordinary season we should be quite certain to see him by April 20th,
but this is no ordinary season. All the earlier migrants are a month
late. I saw the first Chiff-chaff on the 17th near Exeter, and I have
not yet seen a Wheatear. The later migrants seem to be keeping to
their usual time schedule, but, alas! how few and far between they
are. As yet I have only seen five Swallows and one Sand Martin,
and have only heard two Cuckoos.
The alarming decrease of our summer migrants, which has
been noted for years past, has been greatly accentuated this season,
and I fear that a great disaster has overwhelmed the leading battal-
ions of the great army. We have it on the authority of Seebohm
that the leaders of the Snowbuntings and Geese, which nest in
Northern Russia, turn back and fly southward again if they find the
conditions unsuitable upon arrival at their nesting quarters, but there
is no evidence, I think, that any migrants recross the Mediterranean.
Many no doubt linger on the Cote d'Azur, but those ardent spirits,
who decide to press forward and stake their all upon the chance, are

Mr. W. F. Teschemakek,
most surely doomed should they find Central Europe frost-bound or
swept by blizzards, as has been the case in this memorable and
untoward spring.
Nothing perhaps is more saddening for a bird-lover than to
revisit the well-known haunt of some particular species season after
season and to listen in vain for a voice that is still, This has been
the writer's lot for some seasons past in the case of the Nightingale.
Only a few years since I described in a contemporary a flourishing
colony of our renowned minstrel in East Devon but, if I revisit the
spot now, it is but to find the " barren choirs where late the sweet
bird sang."
This once favoured spot is close to Chudleigh Knighton--a
little village lying between Chudleigh and Newton Abbot. There
was once a great lake here, the ancient bottom of which is now
known as Bovey Heath, and consists for the most part of a deposit
of " china clay," washed down from the surrounding hills by the
moorland streams. Men, whose names have long since been forgotten,
dug out the clay, forming large pits, and these in course of time were
filled up with water and became covered with trees and dense
undergrowth, forming a secluded and almost impenetrable retreat,
which the nightingale colony, above referred to, regarded as their
very ow r n. They had divided up their kingdom into five sections,
using the ancient paths as boundaries, and each section was occupied
by a pair.
But, both for birds and men, life is sure to be full of trouble.
One spring the Nightingales returned to find that a quantity of the
undergrowth had been cut down for firewood. There was consterna-
tion among the colonists and much fighting and a re-division of the
land. The next spring witnessed the final disruption of the colony
and the abandonment of the site. Only two or three pairs returned,
and they found that their enemies, the human race, with the latter's
customary greed of gain and complete disregard of the feelings and
vested interests of birds, had opened a new clay-pit and erected a
hideous and noisy pump in nightingale-pond. This was the unkindest
act of all and so outraged the feelings of the Nightingales that they
abandoned the locality and have not been seen in the neighbourhood
from that day.

I have ever since lived in hope that I should some day find
this colony again, in new and less troubled surroundings, but its fate
has remained an unsolved problem. I fancy that what usually
happens in such cases is that the outcasts endeavour to establish
themselves in the territory of the nearest settlement of their race,
with resulting warfare and disaster to both communities.
Another sad memory connected with this spot is that I brought
my friend, the late-T. H. Nelson (author of ' The Birds of Yorkshire '),
here on the occasion of our last ramble. He had never heard the
Nightingale sing, and I had promised him this treat if he would
come as far south as Devonshire. Another friend, who lived in the
Midlands, had made him the same promise, but this friend was
(as T. H. N. himself) a collector, and all that he had been able to
show Nelson was some empty nests, which he had looted of their
contents. Naturally the unfortunate Nightingales in the district
were too grieved to oblige by a song or even a single note. So
Nelson came to Devon, and one beautiful afternoon in May I was able
to present to him five Nightingales singing at one and the same time.
I was curious to see what effect such an experience would
have on a collector, because a collector is a unique type. What
Nelson may have thought I know not, but all that he said was
"Why did the Owl 'owl? Because the Woodpecker w r ould peck
her." He also lost no time in suggesting that we should try to
obtain a " clutch," but, somehow or other, as on many other occasions
when I assisted (?) him in nesting expeditions, there was no loot.
I w T ell recollect that on another occasion Nelson came to
lunch with me, and saw a w T ell-marked Sparrow-Hawk's egg taken
from the nest that morning. During lunch he skilfully introduced
a discussion on the damage Sparrow-Hawks did to game and
poultry, and was much elated when I told him that the nest was in
a most accessible position, and that he could take the entire clutch
if he wished. After lunch, therefore, we made our way to the nest
which was, as I had described it, only some fifteen feet from the
ground ; but just a small portion of the trunk was bare of branches,
and had to be " swarmed."
Now T. H. N., though an ardent collector, was no climber;
the eggs, as I well knew, were absolutely safe. Having vainly

Mr. W. F. Teschemaker,
endeavoured to obtain any assistance, he addressed himself to the
third member of our party, who was a first-rate climber. But the
latter, quite entering into the humour of the situation, approached
the tree in the Charlie Chaplin manner, and, with grotesque
contortions and exaggerated effort, wriggled up a short distance
only to slip back again. Nelson, who had not quite grasped the
true inwardness of the situation, made desperate but unavailing
attempts to push him up from below, in the midst of which the climber
suddenly released his hold, and down they both came, Nelson under-
neath, and getting much the worst of the deal. But Nelson was a
most amiable and charming personality, and, though he had to return
without the Sparrow-Hawk's eggs, he was not in the very least
ruffled.
One of the first principles of successful bird-preservation is
that one should never assist a collector in any way whatever, so,
although T. H. N. was very anxious to know 7 the exact locality of this
nightingale colony, he was only told that it was "near Chudleigh."
Nevertheless, so incorrigible is the collector's habit of passing on
information that even the above vague description very shortly
afterwards found its w 7 ay into print. I think T. H. N. must have
mentioned it to Mr. H. F. Witherby, for this remote spot was sub-
sequently described in 1 British Birds ' as the best locality in
Devonshire for Nightingales.
Alas, both T. H. Nelson and the friend w 7 ho did not succeed in
reaching the Sparrow-Hawk's nest, were ferried across the dark river
last year. Fuit Ilium : fuimus Troes.
I do not, however, need to go as far as Chudleigh to hear the
Nightingale sing : almost every spring morning for the past seven
years I have been awakened by the most beautiful of all bird-music.
It is a w T onderful thing that such a romantic and artistic tempera-
ment as the Nightingale's should consent to sing in a bird-room, but
it does consent---very frequently, for not all Nightingales will make
the attempt, nor will the Nightingale sing for every aviculturist.
Those w'ho regard birds as automata, only requiring to be placed in
a cage of regulation size and shape, and fed on the regulation diet,
will never have any great success with Philomel. The Philomel has
the true musical temperament--imaginative and a little fitful.

Let me give you an illustration of what I mean. Frequently I am
away from home. The morning after I return, it has not infrequently
happened that there has been silence in the bird-room. The Nightin-
gales had been fed in my absence--and, I doubt not, carefully fed--but
only mechanically fed. Something had gone out of their lives. Their
friend, the only person in the house who valued them at their true
value, had deserted them. On these occasions I have only needed to
slip on a dressing-gown, just a few words of greeting to each of
my musicians and a few mealworms, as a token of affection, and
back to bed again. Mark the result. In less than ten minutes first
one and then the other pipes a few notes, and in half an hour I have
my full orchestra.
Let us also note that the best situation for a bird-room is
next to one s bedroom. We are all of us pretty busy nowadays, and
practically the only time that most of us have for enjoying the songs
of the caged Nightingale is the hour between waking and dressing.
It follows that we should regard it as a virtue of the caged
Nightingale that he sings best in the early morning. But you can
also turn him on at night if you wish ; that is to say, if you are fortu-
nate enough to have electric light in your house. Just switch on the
light in the bird-room for twenty minutes at any hour of the night,
and mark the result I am so far from civilisation that I have no
such convenience. But where there is a will there is a way. I have
a 4-volt damp hanging from the ceiling and an accumulator in the
attic above the bird-room. The apparatus is cheap and quite
effective.
I do not for one moment suggest that a bird-room fitted with
electric light is a really appropriate environment for the song of the
Nightingale; it should be heard beneath the silent stars and in the
hush of an early summer night. But those who cannot hear it
under these ideal conditions, can still hear it, if they have a real love
for music and a real sympathy for birds. Those, on the other hand,
who think that birds have no minds, and that the only necessary
conditions of success in aviculture are the purchase of a book of
directions and some patent foods, should give a wide berth to the
Nightingale and devote themselves to the homely parrot and the
vociferous Class III Roller--" made in Germany."

Directly below the hill on which this house stands--some
40 ft. below it--is a piece of boggy and rank grass land through
which runs a stream varying from some 10 to 20 yards in width.
About half of this spot may be looked upon from the windows, and
the remainder from certain points in the garden. Because the
stream is fed by many springs from the base of the chalk escarpment,
it is here clear as crystal, but lower down it passes into the Tertiary
system to become the muddy Bother. The stream is shallow, with
here and there little islands and promontories of weed and silt; and
its bed is stony. It runs southward away from the house, so that
one sees it lengthways. On its left bank there is in summer a
stretch of coarse grass, hog, and forget-me-not, a "carrier " lined with
willow-herb, and a jungle of bramble, sallow-hushes, and water mints.
On the right hank is a- " forest," one might almost say, of the
beautiful, feathered, " barren " stems of the Great Horntail ( Equise -
turn telmateid), in places higher than one's head, though at this date,
March 15th, all is flat and brown. I ought to have said that at one
point a small side stream enters, which makes its own little muddy
delta. The width of the main stream proper is doubled by a line of
flat beds, separated by low waterfalls, and filled with water-weeds and
water-cress. From this it will he clear that here we have an excellent
feeding-ground for water-fowl and waders, although all on a small
scale. These details were needed in order to explain how it comes
about that birds so shy as Snipe and Water Bails may be studied
without difficulty from our windows.
This rough, damp ground is, of course, visited by various birds
from the wood that touches it; Pheasants come (they are always
lovers of damp ground), and Wrens; Wood-Pigeons, also, are con-
stantly flying down to drink. But its usual residents have been
Wild-duck, Moorhen, Dabchicks, and Grey Wagtails. (The Grey
Wagtails are there now, though our Field Wagtails disappeared when
the hard weather came and have not been seen since).
I have never seen Coots up so high as this, though there are
Coots on the broader water just below. As their usual feeding-

grounds were frozen hard we were visited this winter by Snipe and
Water Rails.
There were seven Snipe; each morning my dressing was
delayed through watching them. There they were, two, perhaps, on
one little island, three on the delta, a single one here and another
there, probing like little truffle-hunters. I do not know when Snipe
sleep, for they seem to feed by day and fly about at night; perhaps
they snatch a wink just before daylight. When one came up-stream
upon these Snipe they would rise in a wisp and come right over one's
head in the easiest of driving shots. They never headed up the
stream, for that would lead into the hills. I hoped that one pair
might stay and nest, but the feeding is very limited, the herbage in
summer would be much too rank, and at any rate as soon as ever the
frost broke they were off. So much for the Snipe ; we set out to
speak of Water Rails.
Before coming to Ashford I had lived in a Water Rail country
for some years--in the Test Valley, on the other side of this
county, and that district I repeatedly visit in the winter for shooting
and in the summer for fishing. The valleys of the river Test and of
the river Anton are great breeding grounds for Snipe and for Water-
Rails ; the dogs often put up rails when we are snipe or duck
shooting, and in the summer when fishing one sees and hears them in
the reeds and on the weed-beds, but both those rivers are too deep
for them to wade in. It has therefore been rather a surprise to
find how regularly they feed in water in which they can just wade
with the water up to their bodies, and how frequently they swim
across those places that are a little too deep for this. Another small
point that is new to me, a point which one would hardly perhaps
suspect from the soft feathering of a Water Rail's head, is this: that
for long periods together they will feed with their heads below water.
It is quite unusual to see a Moorhen putting its head below the
water, though Coots of course often do it. But a Water Rail will
work its way inch by inch up the bed of the stream feeding entirely
on something--probably Gammarus--it finds among the stones at the
bottom. I thought I knew all the Water Rail's notes ; but never until
now have I heard its most remarkable breeding-call. No book but
one that 1 have makes any attempt to convey this accurately or.

indeed, even refers to it. Prof. Alfred Newton in his ' Dictionary of
Birds' says: "Besides this" (its sudden, loud, harsh cry), "which
is peculiar to the cock bird, it has a croaking call that is frog-like."
Heard at a little distance this breeding call would well convey that
impression ; but here we are too close to the birds, for as it gets dark
they come right up into the garden (the stream runs through the
garden) so that one can hear the whole quality and timbre of the note ;
and it has a musical suggestion that is wanting in the croak of the
common English frog. (To my ear the voice of the Turtle Dove is
more like that of a frog than is that of any other British bird).
Without meaning to suggest that this call of the Water Rail is, like
that of the Corncrake, ventriloquistic, I have found it rather difficult
to locate ; indeed, when I first heard it, it seemed to me to be in
the air. It is prolonged for just about the same duration as the
" bleating " of the Snipe; and also there is just about the same
interval between its repetitions. It is deep, is full in volume, is
tremulous, rises slightly in the scale, and also increases in loudness
from beginning to end. It is surprisingly powerful; we usually find
it difficult to hear birds distinctly here because of the noise of the
waterfalls, but this particular call is clear and distinct above every-
thing, being as easily heard as the hooting of the Owl.
The call begins just as it is growing dusk and the spells last
sometimes for perhaps half-an hour. I have not heard it in the daylight
(nor as yet at night), so I have never been able to see the bird when
calling. Saunders' ' Manual of British Birds,' 2nd Ed., p. 516, says :
"During the breeding season Water Rails are very noisy, uttering a
loud Cro-o-o-an, called ' sharming ' in Norfolk." But this would seem
to refer not to this, but to another--the well-known " explosive " call of
the Water Rail. The term " explosive " comes from Stevenson, who in
turn took it from Lubbock's ' Fauna,' which he quotes. Stevenson
says ' Birds of Norfolk,' II, p. 407 : " On the 17th of July, 1869,
between twelve and one in the morning, I listened to the cry of this
bird at intervals for more than an hour on Surlingham Broad, and
with a thick, white fog enveloping the reed-beds and marshes ; the
sound struck me as far more resonant or explosive than I had ever
noticed before." But no writer whose works I have here, excepting
Prof. Newton, gives any hint that he is referring to the particular

note we are trying to describe. I think there is no doubt that the
ordinary loud and sufficiently startling call of the Water Rail is the
sound they mean. The attempt to syllable the voices of birds is
seldom very successful, and certainly this prolonged, deep, and some-
what musical note could not possibly be so conveyed. This letter is
not written in the belief that it is describing anything new, for
certainly this most remarkable sound must be perfectly well known
not only to many field naturalists but to all those who frequent the
marshes, and known as the voice of the Water-Rail. But in the case
of so secretive a bird it cannot often, I think, be heard so close at
hand. Among all the sounds of spring or summer it might well
pass at a little distance for the croaking of frogs, as doubtless I
myself must often in other days have taken it to be. I do not know
how many pairs of these birds there are here; I have seen three at
once. In conclusion, I will only add that if any ornithologist who
does not know this singular call and has a night to spare would care
to come down, I should be delighted. Although things seldom come
off just when they are particularly wanted to do so, I think it is
safe to say that he would certainly see the bird feeding, and with
any luck at all would hear as evening fell the strange call of the

Greylag Geese have been fairly numerous during the hard
weather in the Brest marshes, and the smaller white-fronted geese
less frequently.
The Tree Duck closely resembled " Dendrocygna viduata "
and were stray birds from Africa, it is presumed. Their sharp claws
were typical of their kind.
The paragraph relating to the Harriers was obviously mis-
printed and " Berserk " rightly interpreted the true meaning.
With regard to the Cormorants on Lake Doiran, the Pigmy
Cormorant is the commonest, then the true Cormorant, and rarest
the Shag. The Little Bustard is not so often seen in our plain as the
Great Bustard ; both birds are most wary and cannot be approached

by ordinary means. On the wing the Little Bustard appears to me
more like a great grouse or black game.
To the previous list must now be added as inhabiting the
environs of Doiran Lake :
Cirl Bunting, Meadow Bunting, Common Sparrow, Tree
Sparrow, Spanish Sparrow, Quail, Water Rail, Spotted Crake, Sand-
piper, Curlew, Whimbrel, Common Starling, Purple Starling, and
Jay.
The vernal migration has begun, Geese are Hying north in
great numbers, no longer halting by the Lake, but crossing the
Belasitza mountains, and Green Plover, Crows, Jackdaws, and
Starlings are following in their wake. Quite a number of Bitterns
have arrived and apparently are preparing to nest, as are also the
Black Vultures. Partridges have paired everywhere, also Cormo-
rants, Owls, and Harriers. The shotgun will have to cede its place
to the blowpipe! W. D. M. (" X. )
THE LONG-TAILED TIT l Acred ala caudate).
By P. F. M. Galloway.
This species is fairly plentiful and can be seen during any
country walk.
These birds keep in flocks during the autumn and winter
months, sometimes as many as fifteen to twenty in a flock, but by
the middle of March they break off into pairs and begin to build
almost at once.
I have often found the nest commenced by the 25th of the
month.
They do not select any particular building site for the nest;
sometimes it is built in a hawthorn bush, or a hedge, a holly bush,
wild honeysuckle, in the fork of a tall ash or oak tree, or in a furze
bush.
* The nest is the most beautiful I think of any of our native
birds.
Last year I stood only six feet from a nest which was being
built in a branch of furze on a common near here and watched the

Mr. P. F. M. Galloway,
birds come every few minutes with building material; they took no
notice of me. I had a splendid view of them at work. (See photo,
facing p. 175, April number.)
These little architects brought small pieces of sheep's wool
and fine moss, at other times they brought the empty hags that had
at some time contained spider's eggs.
The birds hop into the bottom of the nest, place the material
in the bottom and fix it there ; then they pull it up from this point
and weave it over the edge, the bird stretching its neck well over
the outside of the nest; this they continue to do until it is built up
to the entrance hole at the top. A great number of small pieces of
lichen are brought and fixed on the outside, and when the structure
is completed the whole of the outside is covered with it.
The lining is composed of small feathers of various kinds--
Fowls, Ducks, Pheasants, etc. Such a great quantity are used, that
if a nest has been torn out and the feathers strewn about any one
who did not know it was a nest would think that someone had been
busy plucking a fowl.
The eggs number as many as ten, but more often I find the
nests contain eight.
The young as a rule are ready to fly by the third week in May.
They are fed upon small green and other hairless caterpillars
principally, but occasionally the parent birds will bring them spiders
and small winged insects.
On two or three occasions I have seen four adults visit the
same nest at one time with food for the young, and I feel sure that
the nest, only containing eight young, belonged to one pair ; the
others might have been unmated, probably two cocks or two hens,
and hearing the call of the others joined them. I have never seen
any other species do this.
Another curious thing sometimes occurs with the hen bird
whilst incubating ; the long straight tail becomes bent. I have seen
them when off the nest, with their tails bent, forming quite a half
circle, which looks very odd when the bird is flying.
They are very hardy birds, although small, and can stand the
cold well, being extremely active; but the slaughter of this species
this winter has been very great; in fact, never in my life have I seen

such a winter of destruction. The winter of 1881 cannot be compared
to it.
I think it was in 1895 that we had quite six weeks' frost, and
skating was enjoyed on the Thames for a long time, the destruction
to vegetation and bird life was not to be compared to that of this,
winter.
The cause this winter was through the very strong easterly
gales accompanied by thirty degrees of frost; it penetrated every-
thing.
I have seen in this neighbourhood since the weather has been
milder whole commons even of furze turned brown and the bigger
part of it dead, holly trees and laurels killed or withered up on the
easterly side.
Blackberry leaves that are mostly green during the winter
are everywhere on hedges or in woods, hanging limp and of a sickly
brown shade, as if they had had a poisonous gas blown over them.
During March I have been many miles round this neigh-
bourhood (Beading) both in Berks and Oxon. I have visited scores-
of places where in ordinary times it was a common thing for me to
see flocks of Long-tailed Tits, but I have not heard nor seen any, and
I don't know anyone about here that has ; they all tell me they
have not.
It is not a case of a few being killed, but I am convinced that
every Long-tailed Tit has been killed, at any rate, in this neighbour-
hood.
These birds do not roost in holes or old nests like Jenny
Wrens, or other species of tits, but always on an open bough.
They search for food from daylight to dusk. I once saw a
flock shoot down when nearly dark into a leafless hazel-nut bush in
winter time. I was standing within a short distance of them, and it
was very interesting to watch them go to roost.
They were on various parts of the bush and were busy for a
short time preening their feathers; then a few settled side by side on
the bough, and one by one the others joined them ; the outside ones
kept jumping on the centre ones and wriggling down between them
for the warmest place until darkness set in.
It will be easily seen how the intense cold easterly gale killed

Mr. H. Stuart Dove,
them this winter, probably blowing them off their exposed roosting-
place during the night.
In spite of the bitter cold this winter, all my Long-tailed Tits
*are in fine condition, as they can always rely on a supply of suitable
food.
I feed them on my soft food (" Life ") to which is added a little
York cheese chopped finely and a few mealworms killed and cut into
"mall pieces, and a few gentles, and live fresh ant cocoons in summer
in place of mealworms.
My Gold-crested Wrens, seven in number, which I have had
since the middle of October last, are fed in the same way, and are in
splendid trim, and the cocks are singing one against the other nearly
all day.
The Long-tailed Tits become very tame in captivity, but they
require a large cage for exercise, and two or three birds should be
kept together, as it is their nature to associate in little flocks.

By H. Stuart Dove, B.A.O.U., West Devonport (Tas.).
Birds' nests may, for convenience, be classed under several
heads--the pensile, swung by the rim of the nest, in which the eggs,
and later the nestlings, are rocked by the winds; the suspended , in
which the structure is held at the sides only, without support from
below ; the common or supported type, in which the nest is placed
on a branch or in a fork or niche; and the ground nest.
A good example of the pensile style of building is the nest of
the White-eye {Zosterops dorsalis). These smart little birds are
familiar to all in gardens and orchards, or among the patches of
scrub by the beach, in their greenish and buff colouring, and with
their sharp, ringing call-note, as they dash in small companies
through the bushes. In New Zealand a common name for this
species is " Blight-Bird," on account of its beneficial habit of
patrolling the orchards in winter time and picking off the woolly
aphis and other pests. The swinging type of nest, such as is built
by this bird, is not common in temperate climes, being specially

adapted to puzzle those inhabitants of tropical countries, such as
monkeys and tree-climbing snakes, which have an irrepressible
craving for eggs and nestlings. Except the nest of this species and
those of the Strong-billed Honey-eater ( Melithreptus validirostris)
and Black-headed Honey-eater ( M. melanocephalus), I know of no
other in Tasmania whose structure is truly pensile-- i. e., sewed by
the rim to supports, otherwise swinging clear like a hammock.
The Spinebill Honey-eater ( Acanthorhynchus dubius ), however, will
occasionally adopt a similar form. In a scrub near Launceston
(Tas.) the nest of a pair of these elegant little Honey-eaters was
swung by the edge from slender twigs of tea-tree ( Melaleuca ), but
there was also a small twig at the back which gave some support,
and another ran horizontally beneath.
The two nests of the White-eye here briefly described were
found while I was living among the scrubs near Table Cape, North-
West Tasmania, (a) Swung by the rim from a very frail fork of
the Melaleuca or Swamp Tea-tree, the supports being barely one-
sixteenth of an inch in thickness, so that the total weight of nest,
young, and parent must be very slight. The opening of the little
cup was almost elliptical in form, the measurement of the egg cavity,
2 |in. by If in., 2 in. deep, swelling out under the rim like an inflated
ladle, and with rounded bottom. The material was very fine shreds
of stringybark from the eucalyptus of that name (E. obliqua, L'Her),
with somewhat thicker strips underneath, the rim being sewed to
the twigs by threads of bark fibre and spider-web ; a few spider-
cocoons were stuck on the outside of the nest, and the lining was of
horsehair. The contents were three eggs, of a delicate blue tint.
( b) Bound to two very slender Melaleuca twigs in the same way
as (a), the ends of the twigs swinging quite freely ; nest rounder
at top and more open, not so deep ; measured 2J in. by 2 in. across
top outside, 1 |in. inside; formed of coarse, dry grass, lined with
fine grass, a little green moss worked in, and many white spider-
cocoons stuck on outside ; bound to twigs with grass-blades and
spider-web. A very loose structure, not nearly so neat as the bark
cradle ; but both were so frail that they could be seen through at
almost any part. Neither had the slightest sign of any support
other than the very frail horizontal swinging twigs.

Mr. H. Stuart Dove,
A beautiful example of the pensile type of nest was found
while Mr. H. C. Thompson and myself were exploring the slopes of
Mount Arthur, in North-East Tasmania. There, in the head of a
dogwood tree ( Pomaderris copetala, Lab.), 30 ft. from the ground,
was found the nest of a pair of Strong-hilled Honey-eaters (M. validi-
rostris), a species peculiar to Tasmania and its adjacent islands.
The nest was hanging from dogwood twigs, to which it was hound
by fine strips of stringybark. It was formed entirely of the same
bark, and lined with soft brown material from the crown of the
Dicksonia tree-fern, which grows in those forests. The nest con-
tained three beautiful eggs of a pinkish tint, spotted with dark red,
mostly at the larger end. The ground colour of one egg was much
browner than that of the others. Curiously enough, a pair of the
shade-loving Pink-breasted Robins ( Erythrodryas rhodinogaster ) had
built in a fork of the same tree, 13 ft. from the ground, a very
beautiful home of green moss, covered on the outside with grey
lichens.
The other pensile nest-builder, called the Black-headed Honey-
eater, also peculiar to our island and adjacent islets, generally uses
wool as material, with some moss and spider-cocoons ; they may
line with fur or with feathers. The nest is suspended among the
pendulous twigs at the extremity of a gum-branch--the white gum
(Eucalyptus viminalis ) being the one usually selected--and is so
buffeted by the winds that it is often topsy-turvy, hut the brave
little mother bird " sits tight," so that the eggs or young are not
thrown out. A nest of this species found in North-West Tasmania
by Dr. Holden was composed of green moss and spiders' web, the
lining being of fluffy seeds. The dimensions of one nest were:
Egg cavity--width, If in.; depth, If in. ; outside dimensions--
depth, 4 ins. ; width, 3 in. Both this species and the Strong-
billed Honey-eater usually lay three eggs to a clutch. The eggs are
of a delicate flesh tint, marked (chiefly about the apex) with rich
reddish-brown spots; those of the latter are somewhat the larger,
about '88 by -66, while an average egg of the Black-headed Honey-
eater measures &apos;78 by *57.
Of those structures which are suspended among vegetation,
one of the best examples is that of the Reed-Warbler ( Acrocephalus

australis), a migrant, which usually comes to us in September.
The nest is generally placed in reeds, about 2 ft. above the water,
and is bound to three or four stems, which pass through the sides
of the structure ; the material is stems and leaves of aquatic plants,
or coarse grass. The lining is sometimes fine grass, sometimes the
soft down from seed-vessels of the " bulrush " or reed-mace. These
migrants are plentiful near Launceston, and build in the reeds
which line the North Esk River. The railway sheds are close to
the river, and the Reed-Warblers which nest in that vicinity avail
themselves freely of the cotton-waste used for cleaning engines,
quantities of which are strewed about outside the sheds. Mr.
H. C. Thompson showed me a nest composed almost entirely of
this soft, warm material. When in Victoria I was somewhat
surprised to find a nest of the Reed-Warbler at a height of eight
feet from thq ground, bound to two stout upright twigs of the
exotic shrub Sparmannia africana, Linn., close to the edge of a
lake. The nest was formed of grasses and lined with the seed
" wool " of the reed-mace ( Typha ). Another nest was found in
a clump of bamboo, 5 ft. above the water-line, where two smaller
shoots forked out from the main stem, and was tied to all three.
A third example was 4 ft. above the water, in a bamboo, and was
most unsymmetrical, one side being much bulged with a large knot
of fine grass which had been teasled out and then stuck there. The
structure was tied to four small stems, but not to the main one, and
contained two young birds, blind, and devoid of down, but with tiny
quills just beginning to sprout.
An interesting example of the supported nest was that of a
pair of Flame-breasted Robins ( Petroica phcenicea), found in the
second week of November while I was on a trip to Mount Arthur,
mentioned previously in connection with a pensile nest. The
Robins' nursery occupied a niche, about 5 ft. from the earth, in the
trunk of a giant gum-tree, and was formed of fine bark strips and
lined with small feathers. We admired the manner in which the
architects (which were young birds, for the male was grey, like
the female) had brought tiny fragments of charcoal from the
interior of a burnt-out tree near by, and bound these round the out-
side of their nest with cobweb. This caused the nest to harmonise

with the charred surface at the back of the niche above it, thus
making it appear but a portion of the tree-trunk.
In the course of the same trip a nest of the Large-hilled
Ground-Thrush ( Geocichla macrorhyncha ) was found, placed upon
the top of a large gum-tree stump, at a height of about 5 ft., and
screened by a copse of young dogwoods ( Pomaderris ). It was com-
posed of dry grass and green moss, and contained two eggs. From
my journal, kept while living in the bush within a few miles of Table
Cape, is culled the following : " Nest of the Ground-Thrush ( Geo-
cichla) discovered to-day (October 10th) in the fork of a large dog-
wood ( Pomaderris apetala, Lab.), about 10 ft. up. A large,
beautifully-round structure, taking up the whole space within the
fork, and composed of green moss and fibres plucked from the trunks
of Dicksonia tree-ferns. Within were two fine eggs, of a greenish
tint, blotched all over with dark red." This Thrush is fond of the
site of an old nest, and will sometimes build on the same foundation
season after season until the structure outside becomes of a great
size, although the egg cavity itself may be under 3 in. in width
and 2 in. in depth ; the eggs are usually either two or three in
number, rarely four, and an average measurement would be l - 35 in.
by -92 in.
On the occasion of a trip along the banks of Distillery Creek,
near Launceston, on October 21st, a nest of the Ground-Thrush was
noted in the scrub above our heads, on the top of an old home of the
Ring-tailed Possum (Phalanger) . Upon the mass of sticks which
had been brought together in a former season by the marsupial, the
Thrush had constructed a large, circular nest of grass, and lined it
with soft green grass, but so far no eggs had been deposited. Another
nest was found only 4 ft. from the ground, built on dry gum-twigs
which had fallen on to a bush ; a dirt base had been placed upon the
twigs, then a nest of grass with a little moss intermixed, and lined
with grass, Where moss is easily obtainable, the Ground-Thrush is
fond of using it in profusion, giving a most pleasing appearance to
the nest.
While exploring a hill not far from Launceston, a friend and
myself found a patch of the scrub sometimes known as Pinkwood
(Beyeria viscosa, Miq.), belonging to the Euphorbias. Some of the

bushes had been killed by a running fire, and when scorched in that
way the Beyeria has the habit of curling and twisting together at the
apex, so as to form a thick mass, much in the same manner as the
Jamwood Acacia of Western Australia is described as doing. About
10 ft. from the ground, in one of these twisted shrubs, a pair of
Brown-rumped Tit-Warblers ( Acanthiza diemenensis ) had built a
domed nest, with side entrance. It was woven of grass and moss,
the lining being mainly composed of feathers of the Rosella ( Platy -
cercus eximius). In another bush of the same kind, near by, was the
little cup-like nest of a pair of Fantail Flycatchers ( Bhipidura
diemenensis ), known to boys as " Crazy Fans," from their erratic
aerial evolutions when capturing insects. The nest, which was about
5 ft. from the ground, was made of small fragments of white decayed
wood, very light and delicate, a little moss, and bound, as usual, with
spider-web. A small branch of the shrub passed through the bottom
of the nest, and on this and around it the structure was placed--the
tiny cup above, the irregular tail, about 3 in. in length, below. This
peculiar appendage, the use of which can be only guessed at, is also
formed by the mainland White-shafted Fantail ( Bhipidura albi-
scapa, Gld.), but in our island species, known as the " Dusky Fan-
tail from its darker tint, it sometimes reaches a great length, nests
with a " tail " of 6 in. having been found ; I have heard of one even
7 in. in length. The egg cavity is not usually more than 1J in.
across, and less in depth. It is often lined with the reddish fruiting-
stalks of moss. The " Crazy Fan " may sometimes be touched, even
stroked, on the nest; perhaps the most confident of our small birds,
fluttering about a pedestrian on the bush-track or by the wayside
in order to capture the flies, small moths, and so on, which are
disturbed.

Mr. Herbert Bright,
pointed with their colour, as they were described to me as Red-headed
Bullfinches. The cock was yellowish-green on the head and the hen
only very drab and dingy in colour. Still, they were a novelty and
very attractive, so I thought I would do all I could to get them in
good condition with the hope of inducing them to nest out of doors
later on. I have not been successful in rearing any young, but they
have nested several times, and once hatched and fed young for several
days.
I have had them out of doors two summers, and their mode of
procedure has been much the same each year. In May, 1915, when
I first put them out, they seemed as though they were going to
build right away, and at once made a nest on the hough of an apple-
tree nailed against the back wall of the aviary. I did not notice the
starting of this nest, which was composed of coarse twigs at the
bottom and finer ones on top. This was never completed, though
the birds used to fly to it and visit it for a long time.
Both cock and hen then began a slight moult about the head
and face, but the new feathers were much the same as before, probably
because they had not been out long enough to affect the plumage.
I had hoped they would brighten up considerably. Nothing happened
for some time after this though they appeared in the pink of con-
dition, till one evening I noticed the hen fighting hard to break off a
rather stout apple-twig, which she eventually succeeded in doing, and
flew off with it to the top of a privet, where she placed it and flew
away in search of another.
The cock was in attendance all theiime, but she would not
allow him to come very near, and though he was greatly interested
he did not assist in the work of building the nest. The hen pro-
ceeded to collect more strong twigs for a foundation, and though she
worked hard till dusk there was very little to be seen beyond a few
insecure-looking twigs at the top of the privet. In the morning,
however, on going to inspect I found she had built quite a nice nest
much after the style of our own " Bullies," using finer rootlets for the
upper portion, and she was sitting inside the nest shaping it round
to her liking. Throughout the day she was busy adding to it, and
then proceeded to line it with some fine white fibre I had put in
for general use.

on nesting of the Red-headed Bullfinch. 205
She made an excellent nest, and the interior looked as though
turned out of white wood ; it was so smoothly arranged in place.
They had selected the most exposed spot in the whole aviary,
right in the open and close under the top wire-netting, so I was not
nearly so satisfied as the birds evidently were. Eventually I got my
man to climb on top and fix a square of glass right over the nest to
pi&apos;otect it from cats and weather. They did not seem to mind in the
least.
The hen did not lay for a day or two after this and then
deposited four eggs in the nest, the last being laid about a week
after the nest was apparently complete. She used to fly off about
the same time every morning for a few minutes, so we could see into
the nest by climbing a ladder at the back of the aviary. The cock
was most attentive all the time they were sitting, and would feed the
hen whenever she permitted him to do so.
One morning on returning to the nest I noticed the hen
feeding, and this continued for three days, but on returning to the
nest on the fourth day she only remained a minute and then flew
off again, but returned again. Expecting that something had gone
wrong I got my man to inspect, and he found the nest empty except
for one fertile but crushed egg, so this was the end of this attempt.
I thought they were going to resume operations, but both
went into a thorough moult and I was glad they did. The weather
was warm and sunny and they had a most satisfactory moult,
emerging many shades richer and brighter in colour, and not like the
same birds, more particularly the cock. He was now a real Orange-
headed Bullfinch.
I took them indoors for the winter and put them out again
last May, when they made a beginning at nesting as before, but were
some months before they started properly. This time they built in a
holly, and I never thought the nest would be built, as most of the
material fell several inches below the desired spot, but eventually a
large pile of material was collected and gradually a foundation was
formed and the nest built. Three eggs were laid this time, all fertile,
but they failed to hatch out, and the birds built a fresh nest and sat
again with the same result.
It was now late in the year, and as they had not attempted

to moult I took them in and they fell into moult, but from the
effects of being indoors they have lost a great deal of the bright
golden colour they had last year. They are at present flying in a
large cold room, and I am hoping presently to put them out and try
once again if they will succeed in rearing a brood of young ones.
They used to live most* on privet buds and sunflower, but
would take toll of almost all the green food that was about. They
are very tame, and would always come for a bite of an~ r jjreen food
from one's hand though the aviary was full of all kind? wing
food. If I have better success this summer I hope to it
later.
THE DISPLAY OF THE BLUE WREN
(Malarus cyaneus).
By Hubert D. Astley.
Since writing in the March Magazine on the subject of the
moult of my male Australian Blue Wren, I have had the pleasure of
witnessing his display in full breeding plumage, since the Zoological
Society of London has kindly sent me a female, the only individual of
the species at the Gardens.
When this little bird arrived, I let her out of the travelling-box
into the cage occupied by her future mate.
Hardly had he set eyes on her than he commenced a display
evincing extreme joy and passionate love.
Tightening up the body feathers, so that he looked half his
usual size, the blue cheek feathers became whiskers which stuck out
at right angles from the face ; whilst, dancing round the female, he
twisted his upright tail from one side to the other, his legs at the
same time appearing longer and more slender owing to the compres-
sion of the body feathers. And this he did for ten minutes or more,
as I stood close to the cage, when he had hitherto evinced great
shyness and even timidity.
Throughout the first afternoon he repeatedly chased the hen
about the cage, so much so that I began to think I should have to
remove her, but the next day his first intense excitement had abated,

and singing his little tinkling song the little couple roosted side hy
side in the evening. A very charming sight.
Bve-the-hye ! the so-called hlack areas of the male are not

bluish lights on black ; at any rate on the breast.

By An Old Australian Birdlover.
Amongst the many treasures which Mr. Ward recently
brought from New Guinea were some little Finches, which, along
with four species of Birds of Paradise, New Guinea Minahs, and
Starlings, I was able to acquire. Looking through such records as
are available to me, I cannot find mention of this particular Finch,
and for this reason propose to give a description of it in the
' Avicultural Magazine.' Those collectors of New Guinea birds,
who have introduced the various species of Birds of Paradise into
England, may also have brought home this pretty and interesting
little Finch ; on the other hand, not being so gorgeous as the New
Guinea birds generally are, it may have been overlooked by them,
and this may be the first time the species has been introduced as
living specimens in captivity. Undoubtedly the bird is a " nun ;
it certainly has all the characteristics of that species. In the aviary
they are peacefid and keep to themselves ; they love to balance
themselves to and fro on the slender shoots of the small bamboo,
off which they strip the tiny leaves, probably because the juice
contains a good deal of sugar. Mr. Ward tells me that he has seen
them in flocks between a dozen and a thousand. They would enter
the cages of his Birds of Paradise and be duly killed by them.
They inhabit the flat grass country not far from the coast, living on
the grass seeds. They nest in small trees on the edge of the scrub
not more than twenty yards from the clearing. Mr. Ward tells me
that this is the only Finch plentiful in British New Guinea, though
he says he knows of another very gorgeous one, which is scarlet
with large white spots at the sides, the size of the Australian

Diamond Sparrow. * However, to come back to my Finches ; the
is the description :
Head, back of head and throat light silver-grey, shading
along the throat towards the abdomen from a dark grey to a sooty-
black. Wings and back dark brown ; the two outer tail feathers
sooty-black ; the three next ones sooty-black one side only, edged
with old gold, the two middle tail feathers edged on both sides with
very bright old gold. Vent feathers sooty-black, tail coverts a
beautiful bright old gold, almost yellow. Bill and feet dark leaden-
grey. Underside of wing very light grey, shading down under wing
to light fawn. Size of bird 3 |in. from tip of bill to tip of tail
feathers, measurement round body, taken over wings, 2f in. The eyes
are coal-black. The hen just like the male, except that the grey is
more ashen, not so silvery.f
This reminds me to mention some new Quail I received from
the same source, quite distinct from any I have had or seen. The
colour is absolutely ash-grey, the male bird only showing the fine
pencilling of the feathers usual in the plumage of Quail; the size is
a trifle larger than the King-Quail.
OBITUARY.
Perreau .--We very greatly regret that the war has claimed
another of our members as a victim. Major G. A. Perreau has
been killed. There was no one more enthusiastic and painstaking
in aviculture. On more than one occasion he brought from India
many insectiverous birds rarely seen in captivity, and which he had
himself caught in the hills, some species being new to aviculture
We can ill afford to lose one who was not only a keen aviculturist,
contributing to our Magazine from time to time, but who also
impressed those who knew him with the courtesy of his manner
and the diffidence with which he imparted his knowledge of the
Indian birds that he so delighted in.

INDIAN PARRAKEETS.

<bodyText confidence="0.998962533333333" page_id="9411869"  page_num="Page 209" year="" vol="">
Sir, --In reference to Mr. Ezra&apos;s lutino Indian Parrakeets, it may be of
interest to call attention to the fact that such rarities were known to and described
by some of the earlier writers. Latham's " Jonquil Parrakeet " was a yellow
Blossomhead (P. cyanocephalus), while Shaw, under the name of " Sulphur Parra-
keet," described a similar variety of the Rose-ringed Parrakeet (P. torquata).
The " Blue-headed Parrakeet" (Edwards) and " Azure-headed Parrakeet"
(Latham) referred to the same bird, a partial lutino Blossomhead, that is, one with
yellow spots on the wings.
Mr. Brook, I also see, has a yellow Amazon in his collection. I have seen,
especially at the Canary Islands, many Amazons nearly all yellow, but of course
without pink eyes or other lutino attributes. The yellow extends over more or less
of the body, with the proper green showing in an irregular patch here and there.
These I have always understood were fakes, the result of rubbing some kind of
juice into the body of the young bird. Is that the case ?

CAPACITY IN NEST-CONSTRUCTION.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.932659782608696" page_id="9411869"  page_num="Page 209" year="" vol="">
Dear Sir, --In Dr. Butler's interesting article on ' Capacity in Nest-Con-
struction " he states that with the Ploccine Weavers the male is unable to finish
the nest without the assistance of the hen. This is certainly not the case with
those of the Hyphantornine group, as with all those that I have kept, including
cucullatus, abbysinnicus, olivaceus, velatus, and others, the male is able to weave
a very perfect nest, without any assistance from the hen whatever. In fact, in my
experience, it is only very rarely that the females take any interest in the nest until
they are about ready to lay. In some cases they line the nest with a few feathers
but quite as frequently accept it just as it is. Some of these nests are most enduring-
I remember one, built by my large wbite-eyed Olivaceous Weaver--now alas ! no
more--that hung from the unsheltered roof of the aviary for over eighteen months,
and when it at last collapsed it was still quite waterproof. Most of my Weavers of
this type build duplicate nests, which they use for sleeping in at night, and I don't
think that there is any doubt but that they are built for this purpose.
With reference to Mrs. Lee's mousetrap, I would warn your readers that the
1 in. holes in the box covering the breakback traps are two large. Small birds,
like Zebra Finches could easily find their way in, and would quickly share the fate
of Miss Alderson's pet robin. In other respects the plan is a good one, and one
that I have used for several years. l'ours etc.,
Boyers Home, Westbury. Wili.iam Shore Baily.
Sir, -- I note Mr. Shore Baily's letter in this' number (vide supra) and
it only shows how important it is for none of us to be too dogmatic. In the
case of Ploceus I had males of both P. baya and P. many ah, but no females: a

good many nests were built at different times by these birds, but not one of them
was ever completed, all were deficient in the cup and entrance tube. In the case of
Hyphantornis I had a male of H. cucullatus, both sexes of II. melanocephalus,
H. capitalis, and II vitellinus, and in all cases where nests were completed in my
aviaries both sexes (not, however, always of the same species) were present. A. C.
Stark, in the ' Birds of South Africa,' distinctly states that both sexes of II. velatvs
combine in building the nest, the male sitting outside and the female inside; and I
am sure that I have seen pairs of my birds engaged in constructing the cup. But
it is interesting to know from Mr. Shore Bailey's observations that males of Hyphan-
tornis are capable of completing the work without the assistance of their wives.

THE MANED GOOSE.
Sir, --I was much interested in Mr. Wormald's account of his Maned
Geese and congratulate him on his most excellent drawing of this charming little
goose, one of the most attractive species of waterfowl that I know. Mr. Wormald
says he is not aware that the Maned Goose has ever bred in this country. If he looks
up his back volumes of The Avicultural Magazine he will find in the volume for
1910, on p. 335, a note on the waterfowl bred in the Zoological Gardens that year,
and amongst a number of youngsters mentioned are two young Maned Geese. At
that time it evidently did not occur to me to give a fuller account of this interesting
event which I hoped would be repeated, but I will try and make up for the omission
now.
In 1908 I brought home two pairs of these little geese from Australia, where
it is known as the "Wood Duck," and as they seemed, unlike most of their tribe
to be quite inoffensive and could be safely trusted with ducks, a pair was turned
loose on the Three-island-pond when I took charge of the bird department in the
following year. In the spring of 1910 the female was seen to visit in turn nearly all
of the nesting boxes that were fixed at a height from the ground.
It is our custom to periodically visit the islands and collect any full clutches
of eggs or eggs that appear to have been forsaken by the birds with a view to
incubating them under hens, and on one such visit in May we discovered in a box
fixed about 3 ft. from the ground with a tree-trunk forming a ladder thereto
three eggs which looked like small gooses' eggs and which we thought must belong
to Chenonetla jubata. They were of a creamy white colour with a glossy surface
but as they did not look particularly fresh we thought it best to take them in case
the bird had no intention of returning and laying more. We placed them under a
small hen which duly hatched all three. One was a weakling and died on leaving
the shell, and I have its skin before me as I write. It is of a mouse-brown on the
upper surface, darker on the head. The throat, cheeks, and under-surface generally&apos;
are yellowish white. A whitish line passes from the base of the bill over the eye
and another below the eye, passing to the back of the cheek, where it joins the
white of the lower part of the cheek. There is also a whitish patch on the inner
edge of the wing and another at the side of the base of the tail.
The other two goslings were successfully reared without difficulty. They
commenced to graze at an early age and grew very rapidly, both proving to be
males.

The parent birds never bred again, though each spring they made a round
of inspection of the nest-boxes. Now, alas ! the stock lias died out.
Zoological Society, Regent&apos;s Park. D. Seth-Smith.
Sir,-- Those of our readers who are fond of wild birds may be interested to
hear that others besides " Billy," the Great Tit, will now perch on our hands to be
fed. " Zit," the cock Robin, comes regularly, and stays for quite a long time.
He seems to prefer feeding from my hand if I have gloves on. A few days ago,
after eating what he wanted, he still sat on, and broke into the sweetest whisper of
a song, very low and clear, by way of thanking me. It was so pretty to watch
the quivering of his small throat as he sang. Twice "Zit" and "Billy" have
had a fight on my hand, one bird being already there and the other coming to
&amp;lt;lrive him off. Of course it ended that both went, as a human hand is no
platform for a boxing match. "Billy" follows us all over the garden; we have
only just to call him on, and he flits from tree to tree. Besides "Billy," another
Great Tit (who is lame on one foot) will come readily to feed from our hands.
This bird has not come so much lately, and we think it is "Billy's mate, and
that she is sitting.
Four other Great Tits and one little Marsh Tit are getting very tame, and
want to come badly. They make efforts that so far fall just short of their object,
but I do not think the Marsh &apos;1 it will be long in coming.
Of the pair of Blue Tits, only one comes on our hands, and it is tamer
with my brother than with me. The hen Robin lingers about, but is very shy.
Practically all the food I tame the birds with is some pieces of ground pea-nut,
old and mouldy, and not good enough for the aviary birds. If we had only more
time to spare we could get the wild birds much tamer, but we can only give them
a minute or two now and then. I think the severe and long winter has made
the birds more fearless. It is April 10th to-day, and the ground was white this
morning with last night&apos;s snowfall. Faithfully yours,
R. Aj.derson.

Sir, -- I find that my anonymous correspondent, who most kindly sent me
some particulars about a very early and very interesting French work on Canaries,
is our member Monsieur P. A. Pichot. He has since been good enough to write
me further particulars which are well worth recording, and, I may add, has also
procured for me a copy of the 1706 edition, thereby putting me under an obligation
for which I have tendered my grateful thanks.
As I surmised, this old work antedates the ' Fancyer's Delight ' by several
years, and Mr. Pichot mentions two treatises of an even earlier date. The fact
that the German name for an aviary is a French word (" voli&amp;re ") suggests that
the Germans were not the first aviarists in Western Europe, and IJervieux claims
that Paris originally received the Canary direct from the Canary Islands and
acclimatised it. Nevertheless, Hervieux fully supports the statement, which I
quoted from the English work, that the Germans supplied trained singing Canaries
to a great part of Europe. To quote his own words : " Thus it comes about that

they are called ' Serins de Canarie,' although we obtain a supply of them from
Inspruk (Innsbruck), the capital of the (Austrian) Tyrol, and from many other
towns in Germany, which some Swiss (dealers) bring us twice a year."
M. Pichot has also kindly sent me an article he wrote for ' Le Chenil ' on
the trade in Canaries, in which he mentions that the prices obtained in Paris at the
beginning of the eighteenth century ranged from #2 10s. for a " serin gris
commun " to #45 for a " serin plein et parfait." No wonder that Gesner and
Aldrovandus have recorded that in the sixteenth century the Canary was only to be
found in the houses of the wealthy !
M. Pichot writes as follows: " I thought you might be interested to hear of
Hervieux's ancient work on Canary-culture. We have some books more ancient
still, such as an anonymous work published in 1074 on cage-birds, how to breed,
feed, train, and heal them--84 pages, published by Charles de Sercy in Paris.
From the same editor there is a treatise on the Nightingale published in 1697.
" I think the first edition of Hervieux's work on Canaries was published in
1709. So says l)r. Loisel in his ' History of the Menageries,' vol. ii, p. 212.
Hervieux styled himself ' Governor of the Princesse de Conde's Canaries.' I wonder
if he had some official uniform or Court-dress--yellow, I should say! The book
has had numerous editions up to 1802, and has been translated in Dutch (Amster-
dam, 1762), in Italian (Venice, 1724), and, I think, also in German, but, as bird-
fanciers are not always book-lovers, the work is very scarce and seldom met with.
It is a very able work and very pleasant to read. My copy is the second edition,
1713.
''I have again quoted from Hervieux in the copy of ' Le Chenil,'which I
enclose. You will find in the book that bird-rooms were already appropriated for
Canaries and styled ' cabinets.' "

" Aviculture has always been a favourite pursuit in France, though specialists
have been long without writing about it. Pet animals were quite common in the
middle ages, as one may judge from Alexander Neckam's ' De Naturis rerum libri
duo ' (1211), and there is a very pleasant story in Gaces de la Bigne's ' Roman des
Oiseuax' of a trained Sparrow-Hawk catching and bringing back alive to its mistress
a tame Starling, a very good talker, which had escaped from its cage :
" ' La Dame eut grande joie et le prist
Qui en sa cage le remist
Mais j' ai depuis oui raconter
Qu'il fut bien un mois sans parler.'
"Gaces de la Bigne was Chaplain to King John during his captivity in
England (1396)."
The history of cage-birds is probably as old as the history of man. The little
feathered " drawer of water " looks modern enough as we see him hauling up his
bucket in Sclater Street, but he is mentioned by Pliny in the first century.

This goose, which may be said to be the most handsome of
the genus, is only known as a rare straggler in Europe, except in the
extreme east, but it breeds in Northern Siberia. Several individuals
have been killed in Great Britain from time to time. It is of rare
occurrence, even in Sweden.
It breeds in Northern Asia, but not much seems to be known
about it in a wild state. Mr. Seebohm records (' Ibis,' 1879, p. 159),
in his notes on the ornithology of Siberia, that two mates belonging
to Capt. Schwanenberg's wrecked schooner, whom he had chartered
to collect eggs, were fortunate enough to come suddenly upon a Red-
breasted goose on her nest on an island in the Yen-e-say on July 1st,
which bird they shot before she flew off, and " unfortunately broke
one of the two eggs upon which she was sitting." (Collectors seem
to have no mercy. To shoot a brooding bird seems to us ignoble.--
Ed.) Mr. Seebohm saw several of these handsome geese on
July 28th of the same year, which were on the banks of the river
Yen-e-say, in lat. 70#*, accompanied by their young broods. That
was a few miles south of where the goose was shot on her nest.

imported one alone first, and then ten others two or three years

dition. They never associated entirely with the first bird, and a
week ago (April 7th) I should have said did nothing whatever but
walk and swim about in a closely packed flock, showing no desire to
pair or breed. Last Sunday, however, for the first time we found
several of them very obviously paired, the males, with their neck
feathers swelled out, warning off rival suitors "*

By Dr. Arthur G. Butler.
Although this is the smallest of our British birds, it is also one
of the most hardy. In the winter those of its species which remain
with us go about in flocks, and in frosty and snowy weather cluster
together like bees under yew or pine boughs. Cold alone would
probably not kill them, but a long frost, by depriving them of food,
would doubtless seriously affect them.
In the summer one sees the Gold-crest in pairs; I have
occasionally noticed it in my own garden, although it is more
frequently met with in woods, plantations and shrubberies where
conifers are plentiful, or in the foliage of yew-trees in cemeteries. It
is a charming, lively little bird, with a rather shrill, oft-repeated call-
note, and a short, low, but pleasing little song. When excited it
expands, but does not erect, the crest on its crown; indeed, I believe
it is not capable of erecting it as the Buntings of the genus Corypho-
spingus do their somewhat similarly placed carmine crests.
It is a strange thing that many bird artists do not take the
trouble to inquire into the habits of birds which they are asked to
depict; consequently, if they only have skins to draw from, they use
their own judgments often quite wrongly. As I have elsewhere
noted, the South American Grey Cardinals ( Pctroarm) are all repre-

cucullata is the only species which possesses that character ; and the
Crested Mynah (Acridotheres cristcitellus ) in vol. xiii, p. 93, of the
Museum Catalogue, has been supplied with a solid, unbroken crest
from the middle of its bill to the back of its crown, whereas in the
live bird the crest is tripartite, commences at the terminal fourth of
its bill, where it is densest, and finishes at the back of the forehead.
However, to return to the Gold-crest, it is by no means a
nervous bird, and will permit one to get quite near to it before taking
flight, and it is a delightful little creature to watch as it examines the
twigs and branches of trees, shrubs, and creepers, in tit-like fashion,
when searching for insect food. I have at times stood within a foot
or two of it without disturbing it, so that one may consider it even
more confiding than the majority of Titmice, and almost as much so
as our friend the Robin.
The beautiful, soft little nest is usually suspended under a
branch of yew or fir, but sometimes in the middle of a furze-bush, or
against the sides of ivy-covered trees, in which case it is said to be
much less compact. The eggs, according to Lord Lilford, " vary in
number from six or seven to ten or more ; I once found twelve in a
nest." * Is it not possible that where so many eggs are found two
hens may have been concerned in their production ? I feel certain
that such is the case where more than six eggs are found in the nest
of the Great Tit, but then that bird is quite capable of murdering one
wife and taking on another.
The eggs of the Gold-crest are charming because of their small
size. In colour they are creamy-white, more or less densely dusted
with rust-red, often most densely at the larger end. They lie in the
nest on a bed of small, soft feathers. I do not know the period of
incubation, but should guess it to last about eleven days as a general
rule.
J. I. S. Whitaker, in his ' Birds of Tunisia,' vol. i, p. 100,
says : " The Gold-crest is said to be met with in Tunisia. Malherbe
and Locho both record it as occurring in Algeria, and a specimen of
it obtained by Loche in that country certainly exists in the Turati
* I should expect a full clutch to consist of ten eggs, as with the smaller Titmice.

Collection of the Milan Museum under the number 17,630. Although
recent travellers in North-West Africa do not appear to have met
with the species, but only with the Fire-crest, it seems, nevertheless,
probable that the Gold-crest also occurs throughout the country
north of the Atlas, if not as a resident, or even as a regular winter
migrant, at any rate as an occasional visitor in severe winters. In
Sicily and Malta, so near the African continent, the species occurs
regularly as a winter migrant, and in the former of these islands it is
said to be partially resident."
Speaking of it as observed in Great Britain, Dr. Ticehurst
says (' History of the Birds of Kent,' p. 44) : " It is generally looked
upon as a resident species, and, I think, in some localities, where
there are plenty of firs affording warm shelter and a sufficient winter
food supply, that it may be so. In others which are more exposed to
the cold winds, or where other conditions are perhaps less favourable,
a great deal of local migration takes place, and probably a good many
of these birds leave us and go to the Continent in autumn. Several
of my correspondents have remarked on this, and have noted that
the birds generally leave in November or December and return in
February or March.
" On the other hand, there is very little evidence at present of
any extensive autumn migration past the Kent light stations, such as
takes place on the western half of the south coast. Not only are
there these movements among our local residents, but a considerable
influx of birds from northern counties takes place at different times;
but the movements appear to be irregular, and dependent on weather
conditions and food supply in the places whence they come. These
visitors leave by the beginning of April.
" In the county generally the numbers are greater in winter
than in summer."
I have always believed that the migratory instinct was greatly
influenced by the food supply; indeed, I do not see how otherwise
one could explain the tardy migration of some of our British birds
when the autumn and early winter months have been mild. The
only puzzle is why, when many birds of a species travel to the
Continent at the approach of winter, a considerable number should
stay behind to struggle for existence against our climate. If birds

By Dr. Maurice Amsler.
There is a shortage of potatoes, sugar, wheat, and mealworms.
Now the Editor tells us he has come to the end of his copy. This
must be my excuse for inflicting my fellow-members with a few
notes of very doubtful interest. Last year some derogatory remarks
by secretaries on the gentle as a bird-food caused me to take up my
pen with the idea of vindicating this gentle larva (no pun intended);
the note was written, but was not deemed worthy of a penny stamp.
Now that mealworms are as scarce as ever, their importation from
Holland having been stopped (they were really Huns I am sure),
the lowly gentle must be the chief stand-by of those who keep
insectivorous birds or who wish to breed almost any of the seed-
eaters.
A gentle, when in a fit state for bird consumption, is prac-
tically free from smell, and is neither slimy nor in any other sense
" loathsome."
I have reduced the breeding of gentles to an almost automatic
science, and as the methods employed are extremely simple, I propose
to describe them for the use of anyone who cares to follow them.
In the first place I prefer gentles grown on feathered media_
i. e. giblets and other poultry offal; also young sparrows, which can
be caught by the dozen in a Wyatt's trap.
Fish is extremely smelly, and meat is inclined to dry up,
causing the death of the gentles.
Insects are not necessarily killed by intense cold, as all beetle-collectors know ;
when they dig up frozen turf in hard winter, thaw it in front of a fire and
bottle the insects as they run out. I have also picked up butterflies (lured
out by a warm winter's day) lying frozen hard on the snow, and they have
recovered speedily indoors.

Dr. Maurice Amsler,
Having obtained your bait, merely place it in a large earthen-
ware pan in an exposed situation out of the reach of rain. As soon
as it is sufficiently blown, as evidenced by numbers of small white
grains (the eggs of the blow-fly), cover up your vessel with some fly-
proof fabric such as canvas or muslin ; the gentles or larvas appear
in from one to three days according to the temperature, and their
growth can be retarded or accelerated by keeping them in the shade
or sun. I often use an old garden frame to hurry things up when
getting short of gentles. A few handsful of sawdust thrown on top
of the blown meat gives the larvae a welcome cover and obviates
much of the smell; at the end of four to seven days the gentles will
be large enough to use, but must first be scoured.
All one has to do is to put a piece of fine wire-netting or a
^-in. sieve on top of the pan, which is next inverted over a tray
containing meal, bran, or " toppings " ; in a very short time you
will have thousands of gentles free from all obnoxious or putrid
meat, many, however, remaining in the meat which can be allowed
to grow to a large size.
The gentles and meat can be left in the tray or tipped into a
tin box to scour for a day or two, after which they should be sifted
out and given a fresh supply of clean meat. Their .fitness for bird-
food is evidenced by the absence of any central dark line and the
almost complete absence of smell.
The scoured gentles will not keep indefinitely, but if placed
without any meal in a glass jar, which in its turn stands in 2 or 3 in.
of water in a cool place, they will remain in their larval state for
some ten days in summer and for several weeks in winter; even
when they change into pupse (the small brown chrysalis), most birds
will eat them and also use them for feeding their young.
Another larva which I have also occasionally used is the
" blood-worm," an aquatic, and, I believe, the larva of the gnat.*
My Malachite Sun-birds would eat them although they would not
look at mealworms. The minuteness of these insects is perhaps a
drawback to their use.

them difficult to use in an aviary, and I have, moreover, had some
trouble in keeping my stock. They are only useful for Sun-birds
and suchlike mites. Next to the gentle the " black-beetle " is perhaps
the most useful and easily procurable insect, and makes a welcome
tit-bit for a Jay or a Waxbill, some of the small, immature insects
being smaller than a house-fly.
The cocoons of the wood ant I now collect myself. A coal
scoop, a fine wire sieve in.), and a canvas bag are all the necessary
implements for the sport, which is almost as exciting as deer stalking
and more dangerous than salmon fishing.
The " eggs " are usually to be found in a large mass, some-
times a pint or more, and almost free from sticks, leaves, etc. ; but to
obtain them in this clean state it is necessary to open the ant hill
circumspectly and carefully, until the nest of eggs is found, when it
can be shovelled into the sieve. The bulk of dust and earth can now
be riddled away and the eggs and many ants tipped into the bag.
Several ant hills can be so treated, all the eggs going into one bag.
On arriving home I empty the contents of the bag into large
cardboard boxes--ladies' dress boxes do well, if the eggs and ants are
swept to one end of the box--and a few smaller cardboard boxes or
inverted flower pots are placed at the other end, the ants will quickly
carry their cocoons into them, leaving all the debris behind. It is
not necessary to cover the boxes into which the ants and eggs are
placed ; in fact, I think light is the incentive which causes the ants
to carry the eggs away into whatever receptacle is provided.
I feed the cocoons and ants as they come to my birds. Some
of the larger birds, Quails and Partridges, will take the full-blown
insect as well as the cocoon.
In feeding live-bait to a mixed collection it is inevitable that
the larger birds should get more than their share of good things, and
I have lately fitted up a very simple contrivance which equalises
matters considerably, and which I have not seen elsewhere.
Most of my aviaries have feeding-boxes in the outer flights as
well as the food-trays in the shelter. I have covered these boxes
with 1-in. wire-netting and place some of the live food or other
tit-bit therein, the result being that the smallest birds can feed in
comfort unagressed by their larger and stronger companions. The

Dr. Maurice Amsler :
idea is probably as old as the hills, but one or two bird-keepers to
whom I have mentioned it had not heard or thought of it.
Mice for many years have robbed us of a goodly number of
nests either by disturbing the sitting birds or by actually devouring
the young birds. I have tried various methods of destruction--traps,
poison, and virus--all more or less successfully, but with the con-
stantly recurring experience that they reappeared. This season I
can boast of having only seen one mouse, and that one was dead.
My method is to keep in each aviary a box of canary-seed
which has been soaked in a saturated solution of strychnine and then
dried. One seed is probably sufficient to kill a barn-door fowl, and
there is an obvious risk of poisoning one's birds if one is not careful.
I have been using this method for the past year, and have also given
poisoned seed to three friends and know of no accident.
The secret of success depends on placing the poison in a box so
constructed that birds cannot get into it and that mice are not likely
to carry seed out. The above sketch depicts a box about 18 in. long,
with a |-in. hole at each end. There are two partitions inside the
box reaching almost up to the lid, which is on top. The pan of
poisoned seed is in the middle. Any mouse entering the box has to
climb over the partition in order to get at the seed, does not trouble
to climb back after taking a seed, and dies on the spot; in fact, I
have often found them in the pan itself, so quick is the death.
I have found as many as twelve in one night, and a friend
who used it in an empty aviary killed fourteen, most of which were
in the saucer containing the seed.
I make it a rule never to open the box inside the aviary and
to burn all dead mice.
As these notes appear to deal exclusively with my methods

of doing things, a short record of the goings on in my aviaries last
year may not be out of place.
A pair of Peach-faced Love-birds laid some ten or twelve
clutches of eggs, but the young were never fed beyond a couple of
days. Finally the eggs were transferred to budgerigars, who hatched
and reared their foster-children to the age of three weeks and then
struck work. This occurred on two occasions and the young had to
be hand-reared ; five were fully reared and are now full-grown and
healthy.
" Joey," a veteran cockatiel and an old friend of the Editor's,
was mated to a young hen ; several nests of eggs were laid. All the
eggs were clear until last Septsmber, when one chick was hatched
and reared to the age of ten days.
Five pairs of Zebra finches were given nest-boxes in early
spring; they only reared fifteen young, although they had a large
aviary, were not inbred, and were not interfered with in any way.
At the present price of 12s. Qd. a pair I had hoped to earn my
income-tax.
A pair of green cardinals bought from Mr. Allen Silver went
to nest at once. I transferred the eggs to a pair of Orchard finches,
who were a few days later in their nesting arrangements. These
hatched and fully reared two cardinals ; the third died at the age
of a week, although well nourished. I suspect that he came from
an egg which I had at the time almost thrown away thinking it
must be malformed ; it was more like a sausage than an oval, more
than twice as long as it was broad.
Some of my readers may remember my breeding the*Great
tit and giving the parents semi-liberty by opening the aviary door
for a few hours daily.
As Orchard finches appear to be a drug on the market, I put
my breeding pair in the aviary I used for the Tits (only 9 ft. x 4 ft.),
and allowed them their freedom as soon as the young cardinals were
hatched.
The cock Orchard finch, as is usual on these occasions,
became very tame, and would meet me in a field at the back of my
gai&apos;den quite 80 yards away from the young birds.
I have also seen him sitting on a telephone-wire over the

Dr. Maurice Amsler,
crowded High Street of Eton singing his monotonous song, but no
one but myself seemed to realise that he was an alien.
The liberty of the parents had, of course, to cease before the
young Cardinals left their nest.
I intend to repeat my experiment this year.
A pair of Diamond doves reared three young from their
nests, but only two of these reached maturity.
Finally, my pair of Malachite Sun-birds, from which I had
hoped the impossible, very naturally disappointed me. They built
a nest in a Plumbago cagiensis covering one end of my greenhouse,
after which the cock chose to go out of colour.
The mixture of condensed milk, honey, etc., may turn out
show-birds, but I do not think it is enough to get the birds into
breeding condition. I tried supplementing the routine food with
custard and fruit-juice twice a week, and occasionally a little meat-
juice or " Virol," all of which the birds seemed to enjoy.
The last-named food, I feel sure, saved their lives on one
occasion in November, 1915. When they had been improperly
fed, and were so perished with cold and hunger that I was able to
pick up the pair of little sufferers in one hand with never a flutter
or movement on their part, they reminded me very forcibly of
hibernating dormice. A little Virol and hot water, administered
drop by drop with a fountain-pen filler, put them on their feet in
no time, and the following day, after a good feed, they were as well
as ever.
These honey-eating birds--by which I mean Sun-birds,
Sugar-birds, and Humming-birds--appear to become somnolent
when suffering from cold or want of food. Most of us know the
story of Mr. Ezra's late-lamented Humming-bii'd, which looked
absolutely dead on arrival, but which recovered with food and
warmth to delight the heart of almost every bird-lover in England.
I have hopes of doing better this year in spite of the terrible
winter we have had; indeed, how few of us would persist in bird-
breeding if but buoyed up by this perennial resolution--to do better
in the coming year, and what an example to the rest of the world.
Are we aviculturists ?

Easter. Black-cheekecl and pearl-faced Lovebirds and Zebra finches
are incubating; the Green cardinals are building and a pair of
Swainson's lorikeets have begun to lay; the Redrumps and Rosellas
are inspecting nest-boxes just provided.
My old orange-headed ground thrush is just coming into
song and has stopped trying to peck his hen in the next aviary--sure
sign that he will shortly be feeding her through the wires, when he
will have his usual reward; the door of the nuptial chamber will be
opened and he will pop through. Joey, the old Cockatiel, will be
given one more chance, but if the first clutch of eggs is clear, off he
goes to his rightful owner.
My piece de resistance for this year is a pair of Yucatan blue
and black Jays --{if they breed, Mr. Editor, I shall expect a gold
medal, for you had a pair and failed).* At present they are still caged,
and are waiting for the weather to improve before going out; the
small aviary where the Blue Pie bred two years ago is spick and span,
and I have provided a very artistic and attractive nesting place.
If anyone has already bred these birds will they please write
to me at once. I don't think I could again survive the shock Lord
Lilford gave me by breeding the Blue Pie and not publishing his
notes within a reasonable time.
Apart from being very handsome birds, these Jays are
extremely tame and amusing. I don't think, however, that my male
bird quite realises his duties. The female, who is the tamer bird,
usually gets the mealworm, carries it to the male, who promptly
takes it, and as often as not forgets that his gaping spouse expects
the morsel to be returned to her.
I am not an ornithologist, and I hesitate to interfere with the
already complicated nomenclature of birds; but can anyone tell me
why these birds are Jays ? Would not Blue and Black Magpie be a
much more suitable description of this species ? They have not the
long tail of a Magpie, it is true!; but apart from this their outline is
practically identical, and they have no crest to speak of. Perhaps
some reader who is a frequenter of the South Kensington Museum
will kindly enlighten me.
* [The Editor still has a most beautiful and true pair, but they are in a cage.]

Dr. Maurice Amsler,
Several years ago I determined to breed the Gold-fronted
fruitsucker. I may as well admit that I have failed; but I nearly
succeeded, as two little chicks in spirit will prove. One was two days
old&apos; and the other, alas, fourteen days. The latter was already
beginning to show the green in his plumage. I look at him occa-
sionally, and mourn the hen, now dead, who on four different occasions
did her best to satisfy me. She would have succeeded but for the
ardour of her mate.
It was in 1910 that I took two of these Fruitsuckers from a
dealer in exchange for a pair of Green cardinals I had bred (my first
success in foreign birds). These Fruitsuckers were described as
finger tame; they were, for the simple reason that their feathers
were so matted with sugar and dirt that they could not fly an inch.
Shortly after their arrival I attacked them with a shaving
brush, hot water, and soap. The resultant water would have been
an improvement on the ink we get in these war times ; but both
birds very nearly died as the consequence of my ministrations. A
couple of hours in a small cage near the fire and a little brandy in
their sop improved matters considerably, and next day they had
recovered. The male is still alive, and the hen lived with me for five
years.
About the same time I bought for 20s. another specimen
described as out of feather. She arrived safely and in fairly good
condition, but was as bald as a vulture, which, as it turned out, was
lucky for me ; for in about a fortnight, as the quills came on the head
and neck, I began to realise that she was not quite like my own
birds, and soon after I recognised her as a female Jerdon's Fruit-
sucker. She lived happily with the other two for a time, but finally
I parted with her, and she later appeared on the show bench, I
believe as the property of Mr. Maxwell.
My original pair spent the summer out of doors, 1910, when
the hen amused herself with bits of straw and hay, but did nothing
really encouraging in the way of nest-building. In November I
brought them in for the winter.
In April, 1911, the birds were again put out into a small
aviary, 14 ft. x 6 ft., having a brick shelter. The hen at once began
to carry nesting material, but she seemed difficult to satisfy, both as

regards the quality of the material and the site of her nest. On
June 1st I gave her an old blackbird's nest, which 1 fixed upon a
privet bush. This she immediately appropriated, trying it as one
does a new arm-chair : first she carefully inspected it from every
quarter ; then she sat in it, twisting round and round to find the
most comfortable position. Four days later she had lined the nest
with cocoanut fibre (this material was used each subsequent year, to
the exclusion of all else).
On June 11th the hen was on the nest most of the day. On
the 12th, the nest contained two eggs. The full clutch, they were
small, considering the size of the bird, and of a pale stone colour,
with reddish-brown spots at the thick end.
To quote from my notes:
June 13th : Hen very steady. Cock does not sit or feed
hen.
June 18th : Cock very excited if hen comes off to feed and
utters a new note, but does not attempt to sit himself.
June 25th : Very wet for three days. Not hatched.
June 26th: Half egg-shell found on food shelf inside shelter.
Both birds very insistent for insects, and will not touch fruit or sop.
Mealworms very thoroughly " chewed up," and the skins rejected.
A few small gentles taken; fresh ants' eggs disregarded. Pouring
with rain ; temp. 50* F.
June 27th, a.m.: Hen on nest. Cock feeds her for the first
time with mealworms and green caterpillars (cabbage butterfly).
Later hen off nest, so I inspected nest by means of a looking-glass.
One egg unhatched, and one young chick, naked and flesh-coloured.
Hen returned to nest in my presence, and gave chick a poke with her
bill before settling down. About dusk hen looking very mopey and
is off nest. After a good search, chick found"three yards away from
nest. Looks well nourished. Small bruise on side of head. Age
about 36 hours.
A day or two later both birds began again to eat fruit freely.
I will now curtail my notes, which are somewhat lengthy.
On July 16tli both birds were again searching for some
nesting material, which I had not supplied. So I gave them
numerous spiders' webs, which they are said to use. These they

Dr. Maurice Amsler,
obviously did not want, so making the best of a bad job, two more
eggs were laid in the old nest on July 20th and 21st. The hen sat as
before, and again I found a half shell in the shelter on August 3rd.
On this occasion both birds, but especially the hen, fed the only
youngster hatched, and they used mealworms, gentles, small cock-
roaches, ants' eggs, and undiluted honey. The insects used were
swallowed after much ado and then regurgitated, and their method
of feeding was different to any that I have ever witnessed: it was
suggestive of a baby and a feeding-bottle. The masticated insect,
after having presumably been partly digested, was brought up and
offered to the chick, who gaped lustily, but instead of being crammed
in the usual way, the insect was repeatedly withdrawn from the
chick's bill, from which I infer that he merely sucked the morsel and
obtained from it what liquid nourishment he could. It is possible
that the parents did not approve of the tough covering of the insects
I supplied, and that in their wild state they are able to find some less
pachydermatous insect than a mealworm or gentle; certain I am
that the young bird in my presence never received the outer covering
of any insect. On August 17th the chick was very restless, and
possibly committed suicide by jumping out of the nest. I found him
on the ground, and again a small bruise could be seen near the left
ear. He was a fortnight old and well quilled, with the green colour
quite evident on the back.
August 29th: Again two eggs, one of which disappeared
before September 8th, when another chick was hatched, which only
survived until the 17th. This last youngster showed no sign of
violence--in fact the male, who I feel sure killed the first two, was
twice found brooding the third chick, which the hen bathed and
dried herself. This may have been the result of remorse, but 1 rather
think it was due to the lateness of the season, and the fact that he
was no longer anxious to send his hen to nest again. I can therefore
bear him no ill-will, and must look upon the loss of the third chick as
a piece of ill-luck and nothing more.
The summer of 1911 was exceptionally hot, and to this was
due my partial success. The following year I moved to a new house
and aviaries and nothing happened. In July, 1913, two more eggs
were laid, which both proved to be clear, and thus ended another

season. The following year both birds were in rather poor feather in
the spring, and could not fly well till late in the breeding season, and
again nothing happened. During the winter of that year the old hen
departed this life, in spite of careful nursing. Her tongue had
protruded for some months--always a bad sign with this type of
bird--and with her death ended my hopes of breeding a species
which has seldom even attempted to build, and which I believe has
never before produced eggs in this country.
In 1915 I introduced a very nice young hen, which I obtained
from Mr. Frostick, to the old cock, but he was never much taken
with her, and occasionally bullied her shamefully, though she did her
best to line a nest during the summer. The following winter,
however, she turned the tables on her late tormenter, and very
nearly killed him the first day they were caged for the winter. This
necessitated finding a temporary home elsewhere for her, which I
was fortunate enough to be able to do.
In 1916 we had endless squabbles and no nesting, so I parted
with the hen, and also another pair of Fruitsuckers which I had
bought early in the year. The latter had, before coming into my
possession, built a nest during the winter in an outdoor aviary, but
did nothing after coming into my possession.
Thus ends the history of my attempt to breed what I still
consider one of the most attractive of " soft-bills." Someone
(possibly it will be myself) will doubtless succeed one day, but it will,
I feel sure, not be until we get another hot summer like that of 1911.
My advice for this season is to try King Penguins, or Arctic blue-
throats.
I have by dint of great self-control re-read these notes, and
have come to the conclusion that the title of my article is by far the
most brilliant feature of a very lengthy and tiresome rigmarole.*

By Allen Silver.
In more remote times, before the Metropolis had spread out
its octopus-like arms and had included so many places that were
quite within recent times more or less villages on its outskirts, the
area just outside London proper must have been a very good bird
district, at any rate in as far as perching birds were concerned, and
we know well from our elderly aviculturist friends whose lives have
been spent near its precincts that many species were regular
breeders.
Necessary alteration of conditions and town planning have, of
course, made permanent quarters impossible; but even now an
observant person can see that they are not driven so far from their
old lines of flight, except where factories and chimney-pots are so
numerous as to cause them to " scurry " by until a convenient
halting spot or garden presents itself. In one or two old-world spots
even to-day surprises occur, but here I propose to deal with incidents
that have occurred to my knowledge during the last ten years. One
must, of course, eliminate such species as the House Sparrow,
Starling, Redbreast, Chaffinch, Greenfinch, Wood Pigeon, Blackbird,
Thrush, Rook, and Hedge Accentor, which present themselves on all
possible occasions in inner suburbia, and, of course, exclude places
like Wimbledon Common, where the Nightingale comes regularly and
the Lesser redpoll breeds, or places like Highgate Woods, but
rather keep to those places where bustle is not infrequent and where
tram-cars and motor-buses and a fairly thick population may be
common features, and yet where a few old houses with large gardens
still exist, and perhaps a decent open space or two. It would not be
fair to include outlying places on the District or Bakerloo Railways,
where so many open spots still abound, but confine oneself well within
the suburban mark proper, eliminating all spots down the river below
Richmond or Isleworth. One need not mention Black-headed gulls,
which are as frequent in winter on Clapham and Wandsworth
Commons near water as to be outside the scope, or Mallard or
Water-hens, which thrive on municipal waters, but confine oneself
rather to small and less conspicuous species. I am not going to

tabulate a list of species or supply dates, because I am unfortunately
so placed that I am well away from any notes of reference ; but as
they occur to mind I will mention birds that have mostly been first
discovered by ear in the course of my daily business walks in the
suburbs, or before breakfast, or at night in my garden, or in the
course of an evening stroll.
The Cuckoo on commons as a passing migrant has occurred
almost every spring, and the Kingfisher rarely as an autumn quick
passage migrant on ponds, ornamental lakes, or streams. The Swift,
of course, is quite common, and in one place where a filthy paint mill
lies next a little stream in a thickly populated district where train
lines rush tearing by day and night, large flocks of these weird birds
can be watched at close quarters dashing almost in one's face when
watched from a foot bridge near by. Tawny Owls are much more
common in certain parts of suburbia than one imagines, and I have
watched their gradually pushing out further afield. In an old place
on the edge of Tooting Bee Common a number of these birds were
most conspicuous o' nights. I have seen them also in an asylum
garden at Peckham on a late winter afternoon, and over and in my
own garden at Forest Hill, which is only twenty minutes by train
from London Bridge Station. On Tooting Bee Common at night I
have seen a Barn and a Long-eared Owl, and a Long-eared Owl in a
copse near my own home. A Barn Owl once fluttered round the
bandstand one night at the White City, and a Nightjar almost hit me
in the face there the next season. A bird of this species caused me
nearly to be knocked down one early summer's evening in Tooting
High Road, and a friend of mine who rode a bicycle said he also saw
the bird hawking moths in front of his light. Herons frequently
pass over, and one is almost by instinct compelled to look up when a
heron is passing. These, except in the case of passing migrants, are
often young birds from Richmond Park, and for years I have passed
a spot near Mortlake at the same time as a heron or herons came
over and alighted on the mud on the opposite bank. Barnes Common
always has its two pairs or more of Carrion crows, a bird which I
have seen in pairs, breeding or otherwise, in several suburban spots
and near my own garden. Jackdaws come over with the rooks, and
a large colony breeds still not so many minutes from London Bridge

Mr. Allen Silver
Station, although in a district I consider slightly outside the pale.
It is only a few years ago that jays visited regularly the gardens of
the Firs in the vicinity of Clapham Park. I have never seen a wild
magpie (as apart from an escape) in London. Kestrels, especially in
the southern suburbia, I have noticed on a number of occasions
twirling and shimmering golden brown in the autumn sunlight,
mostly young birds on passage. The Missel thrush is not over
common, although I have met with it frequently on Clapham and
Tooting Bee and Peckham Rye Commons and in my own garden,
but it seems to disperse quickly after breeding, or altogether in some
districts before so doing. Redwings come in the hawthorn berry
season, and can be heard passing over at night often during their
proper season. I have seen fieldfares high up, but not perched or
frequenting any suburban garden. The skylark appears here and
there, and on all suitable spots sings and occasionally breeds close
in. This bird I have seen gradually driven in the south out to
Mitcham by the bricklayer, although it still hangs closely in at
Southfields and in the Garratt Lane district.
In winter the Meadow pipit occurs frequently, and I can
always find one or two to order and probably in company with
a Grey wagtail. I once saw two breeding cocks (Meadow pipits)
in full song on some waste land surrounded more or less by a small-
house residential area, and they remained on, and I could only
conclude the hens were sitting. The Tree pipit occurs occasionally
near a railway cutting in its season. Curiously enough, a Richards
pipit was offered for sale to me--unfortunately just dead--that had
been caught in some bird-nets in a field quite close in. The man
who first bought it treated it like a Skylark and lost it, for which
I was sorry, because it was a species I much wanted to keep alive.
Meadow, Tree, and Rock pipits I have found hardy and excellent
cage-birds, always neat and lively and long-lived. Pied wagtails
are not uncommon, but Greys in winter crop up in the most
unexpected spots provided there's an old ditch or a little water.*
Willow-wrens breed on many of the commons and regularly pass
through the gardens in the autumn, often trying hard to get in the

aviary and fight the birds, and Chiff-chaffs come with them, although
early in the year they can occasionally be seen calling from tall
tree-tops on commons. I have not seen or heard a Wood-wren
nearer than Wimbledon Common. The common wren is not rare,
and can be seen and heard in many suitable spots. Last year a
large brood successfully were reared in my own garden. The Gold-
crest comes through the suburbs and visits most gardens with small
shrubberies. It has often passed through my own, and I have often
heard it when I have not seen it in yews, etc., in churchyards and
cemeteries where conifers abound. I have seen Tree-creepers in
odd spots and in my own garden, but not a nuthatch nearer than
Mitcham district. No woodpeckers have I seen nearer than
Wimbledon, although the lesser spotted breed was seen by a friend
of mine in his grounds in my district about two years ago. His
father owned a spacious place, of course. Greater and Blue tits
are not rare and breed, but Marsh and Cole tits I have only observed
as passing birds, and have in winter along the railway line seen at
regular hours flocks of Long-tailed tits in South London. The
Greater and Lesser whitethroat visit most gardens where there is
fruit, and both species " hung round " my raspberries and currants
and soft pears this and last season. Both species I have seen well
in breeding along railway cuttings. The Blackcap warbler passes
through quickly in the spring, and usually comes back through the
outlying gardens when the small fruit crops are on. In 1915 and
1916 a pair evidently nested near a copse beside the line about
200 yards from my garden and twenty minutes from London Bridge
Station. I heard a cock singing both years throughout the season
of song, and in 1916 the bird would dash across to my garden and
compete with my old Pekin robin in a musical tournament. He
ate most of the riper raspberries in 1916 and occasionally perched
on the aviary wire. I tried to catch him, but had no time to
"rig up'' a water-trap. Blackcaps usually ignore mealworms and
fruit as a bait, but will drink from a small, inconspicuous vessel
rather than search for water. Concerning small thrushes (eliminating
the Redbreast, which follows one like a dog and perches on one's
heel or spade or seed or food pan, and is a general nuisance to guard
against when entering a flight or small greenhouse, where it may do

Mr. Allen Silver,
some considerable damage), the only occasions upon which I have
met with nightingales close in have been a case of a very wild
passing bird in April on the shady side of a common, and an
instance in which some few years ago (three) a friend of mine (an
old insectivorous bird-keeper who lived in a suburb with small
gardens running down to the line) caught two. Much to his
surprise he heard a migrant nightingale's notes, and in a half-
hearted way set an old nightingale-trap under the hedge, and in
due course caught both. One turned out an excellent songster next
season. This, of course, was an accident, hut in former years the
spot may have been good ground for the species. I have seen
autumn Common redstart and also a Black redstart within the
Sydenham district. In fact, a male in winter plumage in 1915
could be seen in a certain spot for weeks, and was known not only
to myself, but to a fellow bird-keeper who discovered it apart from
myself. Tw t o bird-catchers tried to catch it, but one made it trap-
shy,* and it moved on in due course. The Spotted flycatcher
I have noticed in May, and an old garden wall only recently pulled
down was evidently a site for the breeding pair, for later in that
season I saw the young being fed by parents there. I have never
seen a passing Pied flycatcher myself, but I saw alive and doing
well two immature birds that some years ago were caught with a
mealworm by a youth not far from Vincent Square, Westminster.
They were noticed at once by him, his father being a bird-
keeper, and he had no difficulty in attracting their attention to
the line.
Swallows, House martins, and Sand martins occur regularly
as passing migrants, and especially in autumn will feed over the
ponds, lakes, and streams in the suburbs. The former species,
however, seems to go out well as a breeder as does the latter, but
the House martin, like the swift, clings occasionally to eaves fairly
well in. These sites, however, are fast disappearing. Just a little
way out I have seen a passing Red-backed shrike alight on railway
wires. Turtle doves have made a quickly moving passage over
commons with trees to my knowledge, but I have never seen them
* Two other instances of this under review have also occurred.

permanently settled nearer than Mitcham. I have seen the whin-
chat feeding young at Finchley within quite recent times, and the
stonechat, both sexes and young, alongside tram lines and where
plenty of people go and pass. Wheatears as passage birds I have
heard pass over the same ground, but I have not seen them. With
regard to Finches, I have seen Goldfinches, single birds and flocks
of birds, on the move and settled near where tram lines, motor 'buses,
factories, and a squalid, thickly-populated neighbourhood existed, and
they were not only noticed by myself, but by old fanciers who lived
in these parts.
Linnets pass over quickly but not rarely, and redpolls, singly
and with young, come into the trees in season on a common
I know, and in winter I could always fetch one down in my garden,
and have heard breeding males singing over the garden. I noticed
a hen goldfinch in the spring of 1916 on my aviary, which dropped
to the singing of my own birds. The song of the chaffinch and
greenfinch in the breeding season is not rare in the old suburbs and
outer suburbs, but I have never heard of hawfinches nearer than
Epping. Bullfinches I have seen in South London coming up the
railway cuttings in winter and migrant birds passing over high up
after an evening feed somewhere near. During snow I have known
of bramblings on Clapham Common. At night I have heard Green
and Golden plover pass over high up, and also Curlew and other
invaders whose cries were unfamiliar to me. Geese have evidently
in mid-winter been also flying high up above the flocks, because
their cry intermingled at times. Whilst walking through South-
East and South-West London, when the flying ants are about, both
starlings and sparrows are made more conspicuous by reason of
their continuous pursuit of them.
This, roughly, constitutes an account of species that have (as
before pointed out) come under notice during the last ten years, and
which have in most instances been discovered by ear. Their presence
has not been made obvious in the course of leisurely strolls, but
during the course of quickly conducted business journeys on foot
or 'bus or occasionally in the course of a morning or night walk.
It serves to an extent to show how birds are gradually pushed out
by alterations. In these ten years I have seen immense estates

lark singing or see it feeding its young, and could always in winter
find a Meadow pipit or Grey wagtail.

(Continued from p. 203).
While pushing through the belt of thick tea-tree ( Lepto-
spermum ) which adorns much of the banks of a large creek in the
Launceston district, excluding the sunlight and keeping the ground
almost devoid of undergrowth, we noticed one of those fine Honey-
eaters formerly called the " New Holland," but now the White-
bearded (Meliornis novce-hollcindice ), upon her nest, about 8 ft. from
the ground, in a fork of the scrub. She hopped to a twig which
projected at an angle from the nest, and stayed there, without a note
or a movement, for about twelve minutes, until cameras had been
erected and pictures taken. As soon as one of the party went close,
the female bird left and the male appeared, dashing about and
uttering angry cries. The nest was roughly cup-shaped, composed
of small twigs and wool, and lined with the soft downy seed-pods of
the " cotton-bush " (Pimelea nivea, Lab.), which grows plentifully
hereabouts and is commonly used by this Honey-eater. The nest
contained two good-sized young birds and an infertile egg. It is
interesting to note that this lively and handsome species is partial
to a similar nest-lining on the mainland of Australia, for an observer
records a case at Upper Werribee, Victoria, where the lining was
entirely of soft, yellowish-white seed-casings derived from a particular
shrub there.
Towards the end of September I discovered the nest of a
Brown Scrub-Wren ( Sericornis humilis) within a few yards of a
public road daily traversed by carts, cyclists, pedestrians, and
occasionally by motor-cars. The nest was within 50 yards of the
sea, placed in a tangle of the prickly-leaved ( Stellaria pungens, Bron.),
\0x25A0 and bracken fern, and was shaded by a small varnish wattle ( Acacia

verniciflua, Cunn.). It was composed of grasses and portions of dry
fern, and lined with feathers; placed at a height of 2# ft. from the
ground, and so well concealed in the tangle that only the entrance
was visible when one stooped to peer into the. thicket. Had the
bird not flown as I made a thrust with my stick among the ferns,
her secret would probably have remained undiscovered. In the
afternoon of the same day I paid another visit, and was rewarded by
finding the female upon the nest, where she remained and gazed
quietly at me.
To quote a few instances of birds that select the ground for
their nurseries, or get so close thereto that they may be considered
as ground-builders, I will describe a ramble along the side of a white
gum-tree hill in Northern Tasmania. Here, under shelter of the fine,
straight, young trees, and amid the profusion of Lepidosperma
tussocks with which the long slope is covered, numbers of beautiful
Yellow-throated Honey-eaters ( Ptilotis flaviqularis ) were occupied
with domestic cares. The first nursery was easily seen, no attempt
having been made at concealment; it was situated only a foot from
the soil, in a small Lepidosperma tussock, and was cup-shaped, deep,
formed of strips of gum bark and grass, and lined with about equal
parts of cowhair and wool. The dimensions were : 5 in. across the
top over all, 2J in. across inside, and about the same inside depth.
Two eggs reposed on the warm liuing, one being white, the other of
the usual pinkish hue, with many red spots at the apex, sparsely
spotted over remainder of shell.
Another nest was placed in a larger tussock, and was fairly
well hidden under loose strips of fallen gum-tree bark. It was con-
structed of grass, with some of the Lepidosperma blades passing
*diagonally through the sides and woven in ; spider cocoons were
also woven into the exterior, and the nest was situated close to a
large, strong web, having a vertical shaft in which the obese arachnid
lay hid. The cup-shaped nest was very deep, so much so that the
female Honey-eater was almost concealed as she sat, only her head
and pretty primrose throat showing at one side and her tail at the
other, the body being packed well down, giving the impressiou of
great depth and warmth. She sat without a movement while we
watched, and a few days before, when visited by Mr. H. C. Thompson

had had the lens of a camera within a yard without betraying any
fear, still cleaving to the eggs, which reposed on cowhair and a little
wool.
A third nest was found in a similar situation, and contained
three eggs just chipping on October 28th, and on November 2nd
there were three young with eyes closed, the bodies partly covered
with a blackish down. The eggs of this fine bird measure about
*9 x '7 in. The Striated Field-Wren (Calamanthus fuliginosus )
sings sweetly his wild little ditty from the top of a tall tussock, stem
of tea-tree, or fence-post, all through the cold, often wet, months of
winter and spring. He loves the swampy plains near the beach,
where abound the great " saggs " or tussocks amid w T hich he passes
a large part of his existence. Our species was formerly considered
identical with that of similar habitat on the mainland of Australia,
but was separated by Mr. G. M. Mathews in his " Hand-list " of
1908, the Tasmanian form retaining the name of " fuliginosus " or
" sooty," while the Victorian is distinguished as " albiloris.&quot;
By making my way through the swamps I have discovered a
number of Calamanthus nests, several not being new, but well pre-
served, owing to their being packed away in snug positions. It has
been stated that this songster builds under the overhanging tussocks
and in the midst of small bushes ; it may do so in some parts of the
country, but in this district my experience has been that the domiciles
are packed away right down in the tussocks, and usually towards
he south-east side of the bunch of drooping blades, so as to be
sheltered from the prevailing north-west winds, which sweep at
times with much severity across Bass Strait. The structure is large
and domed, with side entrance, made principally of dry grass mixed
with a quantity of green moss, the sides thick and massive, so as to
render it warm and cosy inside, this effect being considerably
enhanced by the plentiful lining of feathers with which it is provided.
A quantity of vegetable matter, such as portions of dry tussock-
blades, is first put down into the clump where the blades converge
towards the base, and this forms a foundation to keep the super-
structure in position. In one of those found, an old nest seemed to
form the base for the new one, to raise it well up from the wet,
marshy plain. In many cases the top front of the nest appears to

overhang and form a sort of eave to cast off rain or hail and keep all
within dry and snug. In some cases, however, the lower lip of the
entrance projects and the upper recedes, so that one can look down
into the egg-chamber; in these instances the structure appears
midway between a covered and an open nest.
The Spotted Diamond-Bird ( Pardalotus punctatus), or, in
ordinary parlance, the " Ground Diamond," may well be termed an
underground builder, for it burrows horizontally or in a very slightly
upward direction into the solid ground, and at the termination of
this burrow excavates an incubation chamber in which to rear its
brood. During the month of November Mr. H. C. Thompson and
myself explored the recesses of one of these miniature tunnels made
in the side of a hollow from which a gum-tree stump had been
removed, the soil being a fine white grit. The hole which marked
the entrance was about 6 in. below the general ground level, and the
tunnel went back about 12 in.--no light contract for a pair of tiny birds
measuring each very little more than 3# in. total length, to excavate
so far in hard grit, with no tools but those of Nature's providing.
At the end the burrow was enlarged to form a chamber, in which was
placed the spherical nest with small side entrance, formed of fine
strips of inner gum bark intermixed with a few very fine rootlets. In
this soft cradle reposed no fewer than five pure white eggs (the usual
clutch is four) of a somewhat rounded shape, heavily incubated; we
replaced them, and covered in the chamber as we had found it. The
male bird had left the burrow as we approached, showing that he
takes some part, at any rate, in the incubation.

We all know of the Cuckoo in the Old Country, writes a
Queensland correspondent, and even those of us who have not been
there have read of that bird's lazy habits as regards nest-building--
how it takes advantage of another's industry. But how many of us
know that we have a bird with us here which has similar habits ?

The Coo-ee Bird we call him, though his correct name is Koel, and
that he belongs to the Cuckoo family. He is a black bird and his
wife dresses quietly in grey. These birds go away for part of the
year, but just now round outside Brisbane the male bird is persistent
in his cry. " Coo-ea! " he seems to call, and his wife answers
" Quick ! quick ! quick! " It is nesting-time, but it is not that
they are in a hurry to build. They do not find pieces of twigs and
leaves, and soft feathers to line little warm nests--not they ! The
male bird also calls " Warra, warra, warra," and one often hears
this cry through the night.
As I write there is a picture before me and the sound of a
multitude of bird voices. Dozens of those quaint-looking and
quaint-voiced birds, the Leather-heads, are rioting amidst the
yellow bloom on a tall, silky oak tree. The golden glow on the
tree is beautiful against the sky, but one hardly knows how lovely
these silky oak flowers are until one gathers a spray and looks into
the heart of it. As the flowers mature, little spikes of yellow are
released and stand up, tipped with the palest of green, tiny nobs.
At the base of these spikes there are stripes of red, and here in the
wee cups is the honey. One has only to put one's finger on
the moisture and taste it to realise what a harvest the birds reap
with their wondrous busy tongues--a harvest of honey. No wonder
there are birds galore, for all the thousands of little cups are filled.
Birds of all sorts which love honey collect there, and they know that
their lives are protected in these grounds, no boy, big or little, being
allowed to hurt or frighten them.

To the Editor of the Avicultural Magazine.
It may interest you to hear that last week I walked over part of the ground
of the battlefield of the past few days, and was staggered to see quite a number of
partridges running about between the shell craters (I must have seen at least thirty
or forty within a few hours), larks singing, magpies all over the place, and a hare
lopping along as if nothing were happening, with big guns roaring all round and
from every side ! One would have expected that the intense bombardment and the
tens of thousands of troops who had fought over the ground only a few hours before
would have driven away every form of animal life : the birds, of course, could fly
back again if disturbed, but how did the hare get there ? I also saw the first swallow
flying over a pond near the battlefield on the 13th of April. What awful weather we
are having, but our men are doing splendidly in spite of it. With kind regards.
Yours very sincerely,
Albert Pam.

Dear Sir, --Mr. Trevor-Battye's article on Water Rails must have given great
pleasure to many readers.
May I, at the risk of being deemed tiresome, again refer to my old question
as to why some members of the Society do not get a pair or two of Water Rails and
turn them down in a suitable enclosure for nesting? Much of intense interest
could then be learned, both as to the calling and also as to the nesting habits of
the bird. The experiment would only necessitate a little energetic and combined
action by a few members interested in such birds, and I feel sure it would succeed
sooner or later. Nearly allied Rails do well and breed in captivity, and my expe-
rience of Water Rails (and I have had several) is that they are quite easy to keep
and very adaptable.
It is interesting to note that in Iceland the Water Rail is known as Keldu-
Svin (Swamp-Swine) from its cry. I have been informed by an Icelandic farmer
that it creeps into outhouses about the farms in winter. How it gets food is a
mystery.
In suggesting that efforts should be made to get Water Rails to breed in
captivity I am not writing selfishly. My own birds of many kinds have almost all
gone since the war commenced, including one Blue Bird, which has flown to

Sir, --In the current * Avicultural ' Dr. Hopkinson asks if the yellow
coloration often seen in Amazons is due to faking by rubbing some juice into the
body of the bird. In Brazil the making of these " contrafeitos " is a regular busi-
ness, so it is not surprising that one sees, even over here, so many "home-made "
lutinos. The feathers are plucked out over a selected area, and the cutaneous
secretion of a small frog is rubbed into the denuded space ; or the frog itself may
be used in the same way. Dendrobates tinctorius is the species employed : it is a
pretty little creature, about the size of the European tree-frog, and is widely dis-
tributed in South America, from Panama to Ecuador. The cutaneous glands are
but small, but their secretion is very poisonous, and is probably allied to the toxin
which has been isolated from similar glands in the spotted salamander (Salamandra
maculosa). Yours, etc.,

SUPPOSED FALCATED DUCKS BRED AT KEW.

</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.99238475" page_id="9411904"  page_num="Page 240" year="" vol="">
of the supposed Falcated Ducks bred last year at Kew (see the January 'Avicul-
tural Magazine,' p. 96), and found that they were Falcated-Gadwall hybrids, as I
expected, having last year seen a Falcated drake in company with a Gadwall
female on the lake, and no female Falcated in evidence, at breeding-time.
At the same time, I must admit that the Falcated species is very dominant
in the colour of the hybrid drake, which, however, has no buff on the lower tail-
coverts, and has the throat buff instead of white, this colour extending over the
cheeks nearly up to the eyes, and passing narrowly up along the base of the bill
to end in a spot on the forehead. In structural characters, however, the Falcated
is recessive, the hybrid having neither crests, elongated wing-feathers, nor long
tail-coverts developed to any noticeable extent.
The female shows the Gadwall blood in having the underside of the bill
orange, which colour extends indistinctly over the sides of the beak also ; her
speculum is also only smoky, not so intensely black as it should be, and she has
not the slight development of crest that even a female Falcated shows.
The male's note is a whistle, much like the Falcated drake's, and not at
all like the strong coarse quack of the Gadwall drake. F. Finn.

-- e. g. the Great Titmouse; but it seems advisable not to make use of capitals
otherwise-- e. g. " By a stream I observed a pair of grey wagtails."-- Ed.]

THE NEST OF A CHAFFINCH.
(.A Tale of Romance ancl Resource.)
By Alexander Goodall.
The Auld Kirk Manse, or The Manse, as it is usually called, is
a long rambling, two-storied building situated at the top of one of the
many feeders of our exceedingly busy main street. Surrounded by
tall trees, in which there is occasionally a colony of rooks, and
ornamented by shrubs and evergreens, it has the appearance, and I
know it possesses, all the peaceful felicity and calm serenity generally
attributed to the rural minister's residence, although standing almost
in the heart of a manufacturing town. There is one green sward
suitable for such like pastimes as bowls, croquet, etc., and another
which is put to more utilitarian purposes, besides a large garden, where
many of the various fruits and vegetables necessary for the comfort
and the well-being of the inner man are grown. Nor must I forget
the reverend doctor's bees (his only hobby), nor his good lady's hens,
both of which colonies, by their products, help to sweeten the life
and fill with vigour the numerous members of The Manse household.
I could relate many incidents connected with the history of The
Manse, but am afraid they would be rather out of place in this
article. There are meetings--rejoicings--partings--weepings--
marrying and giving in marriage; for the couples are many
who come to The Manse to be bound together in the bonds of
matrimony. And it is in connection with the latter that I have

been constrained to mention The Manse at all. It was after one of
these rejoicings, when a loving couple had taken each other " for
richer, for poorer, for better, for worse," that the following charming
incident occurred. After receiving the blessing of the worthy pastor,
they were further gladdened by a glorious send-off at The Manse
gate, from which they took their departure in a smothering shower
of confetti. A pair of chaffinches which had been sitting in one of
the trees near by, introducing themselves to one another, were
amazed at the manner in which human beings could conduct them-
selves after a wedding, and, until the cab had driven off, and the
newly-wedded ones were far away from the scene, they sat perfectly
speechless to see men and women--who were supposed to belong to
the higher grades of the animal kingdom--carrying on in such a way
as to proclaim to all right-thinking birds, that they had taken leave
of their senses for the time being. The hen was the first to regain
her composure (a faculty, by the way, not altogether unpeculiar to
the female sex), and she said ; Pink ! pink ! pink ! pink! By the
tone of her voice one could easily interpret it to mean, " These folks
are mad!" But the cock, who had spent a year or two in The
Manse grounds, and knew all about it, corrected her, and said : Pink !
pink ! Tra la la la, Hu hu hu hu, He he he he, hooie," which, being
freely translated, means, " No ! no ! no ! no ! Not at all, dear !
That's just how they wish them joy ! " It were needless for me to
enter into the many conversations they had together for long, long
after the bride and bridegroom had departed. Suffice it to say, that
after a great deal of persuasion, much cajolery and flattery, not to
speak of a continual and liberal display of his beautiful new spring
suit, he overcame the lady's coquetry, and obtained her consent to do
as the humans had done, without any of the fuss and noise with
which they had accompanied their ceremony. They were married--
without the consent of the reverend doctor, I must say--but they
built their house, and lived and reared their family within the
sacred precincts of The Manse grounds. The building of their house
was a great affair, for it was a unique bit of architecture. It was
started in the orthodox way, with small twigs and grass interwoven
and interlaced, and the inside was beautifully lined with feathers.
But the outside, which is generally formed of lichen or moss, pre-

sentecl a wonderful aspect. Whether moss or lichen was not
procurable I cannot say, but, knowing that the outside was incom-
plete without a decoration of some kind wherewith to adorn or make
it less conspicuous, the worthy couple laid their heads together, and
after a long and serious confab resolved to again follow the
example of the humans 'and utilise the confetti which had been
thrown at them for good luck, and see whether there was any truth
in the popular superstition. Accordingly they hied them to The
Manse gate, and carefully collected as much of the confetti as was
still to the fore, and decorated the outside walls of their prospective
residence in the most skilful manner imaginable, after which he
gallantly led her to her bridal home, where they proved that the so-
called superstition must have been no superstition at all, for it
brought them much happiness and a wedded life in which there were
no family jars, and any troubles they did have were exceedingly
" little ones " ; but it served to make the nest more, instead of less,
*conspicuous, and this ultimately led to its discovery.

members ; but it is rather a far cry from the editorial chair of the

He who wrote " a small thing, but mine own," sounded a very
true note in human nature, for is it not often the case that we prize
a bird just because its love seems specially to centre on ourselves,
and parrots and parrakeets seem particularly capable of giving
affection to their owner and often to no one else.
There is something very delightful in gaining the loving con-
fidence of a timid or savage bird so that it ends by looking upon you
as its greatest friend, and it is my firm belief that it is possible to
.accomplish this with every wild creature, whether animal or bird.

How, then, should we start with a parrot that comes straight
from a dealer's and may be savage or timid, or possibly both
combined ?
First, let us consider the point from the parrot's side. Even
with merciful treatment it has suffered greatly. It has been deprived
of its freedom to come and go, to fly or settle at will, and when one
thinks of the joy it must be to a bird to fly where it lists, in the pure
air and sunshine, to light on a swinging bough, and to exchange
this for a small barred cage--possibly with other captives--and a
hard straight perch, it is no wonder if many birds physically suffer
from strain and heart-break, and get out of health from inaction
after a life of liberty. Then, again, there is the terrible shock to
the bird's system in being caught , the unknown dread of what it all
means, the terrified helplessness. In highly-strung birds one would
almost wonder if they were ever quite the same again, for birds have
" hearts " like human beings. I once had a little whydah that used
to faint in my hand if it was ever necessary to catch it.
Another strain on a parrot is the change of climate, and this
change is made worse by the bird not being able to move about in
its cage sufficiently to keep its circulation properly going. Added
to this is the change of food, the lack of fresh food, and the infinite
variety of it, in the bird's free life, the healthy appetite gained from
having to search for that food : all this exchanged for an artificial
diet, which being always before the bird must take away much of its
desire for it.
There is just one point more: if you look at a parrot's feet
you may sometimes notice they are more or less imperfect. A nail
may be gone, perhaps a toe, in some very bad cases several. What
does it mean ? Simply a record of a man's cruelty when he trapped
the bird, for black people know no pity with live creatures. Can we
wonder at any parrot's hatred or terror of the whole human race ?
Many a parrot put down as bad tempered is simply nerve-racked
when any human being makes advances towards it. It is a repeti-
tion of the case of the poor little terror-stricken dauphin in his cry
to Marie Antoinette, " Mamma, is it yesterday over again ? "
How, then, shall we treat our parrot to make it forget tho
past ? It goes without saying that the cage must be all ready before-

band--sanded, with fresh food and water, and one or two tit-bits,
apple or biscuit, put on the seed. The parrot will probably arrive in
a wooden box. To transfer it just loosen the lid, turn the box gently
on its side, and slide the lid off while holding the box to the open
cage door. If it is a sliding door to the cage tie it up with string
first. Let the bird come out quietly, it will not keep you waiting
long.
When the parrot is inside the cage do not trouble it with too
much attention all at once. It is tired and strange, and to have
many people round it makes a bad start. Just speak to the bird a
little yourself, put it where it can be quiet and yet see to eat and
\0x25A0drink, and cover its cage over at night, for your room or aviary
will not be as warm as a dealer's shop.
Next day you may begin the work of taming. Four things
are needed on your part--gentleness, patience, and perseverance,
and the sense to " go slow " ; affection is a thing that cannot be
hurried. One more point: if possible wear the same dress when
attending to your birds, or what can the parrot think but that you
have changed your plumage, a fact that in the bird-world might well
arouse grave suspicion. Most of us have an old "aviary coat " ; it
is as well to keep such a garment, not only for the bird's sake, but
*on the score of cleanliness. Birds notice more than we imagine. I
\0x25A0once had a pair of partridges that only loved their former owner when
he wore a certain blue jacket.
For the first day or two after your parrot's arrival don't
worry him with too much clearing out of his cage or trying to force
him to be tame, just talk to him when you go near the cage and
put a bit of biscuit between the wires. My own parrots were
especially fond of a square biscuit (flavoured with vanilla) named
" Nice," and made, I think, by Huntley and Palmer. When the bird
has found out how good the biscuit is, cease to put it between the
wires and offer it at the same place held in your fingers. If the
bird will not come, take the biscuit away, and try again a little later.
Be sure and give up the biscuit the moment the bird seizes it, for it
will be an effort on his part, just as it is a trial of patience on yours.
After the parrot has learnt to take biscuit freely from your fingers
he must start to learn to come out of his cage. Be sure your door

and window is shut, and that there is a guard over the fireplace ;
then open the cage door wide, and put one arm across the opening,
not above the bottom of the door. Hold the piece of biscuit on the
other side of your arm in the other hand so that the bird must come
on your arm if he wants to take the food. Talk to the parrot and
encourage him, and call him by his name, so that it may be the first
sound that strikes his notice when he knows he is being offered
something nice to eat. You must hold your arm very still and may
have to keep it out for some time. Your sleeve, not your bare wrist,
should be in front of the opening, and when the parrot comes on to
it move your arm very gently from the cage, and of course give the
bird the biscuit. If he will not come take the biscuit away. From
the first the parrot must understand that if you ai&apos;e his friend you
are also his master. By the same rule, if a parrot tries to bite
you, don't leave the cage at once, letting him think he has won a
complete victory, stay for a little, and show him you are not afraid
of him, but are determined to do what you intended to do; a bird
respects an owner that it knows is master of it. Most parrot bites
come from nervousness and the instinct of self-defence, not from
real viciousness, and so should not be condemned too harshly.
When the parrot will come out readily, and will almost ask
you to let him out, you have nearly won him. He has yet to learn
the greatest test of a tame parrot--to allow you to stroke him down
the back without flinching. Most parrots have an intense fear of
this, so be sure and begin your " stroke " by starting round the
sides of the bird's neck and face, then very gradually as you feel
the bird will bear it, teach it to trust your hand behind it, but
remember your teaching must be gradual, for you cannot remove fear
or establish love by force and alone, the effort must come from the
bird's side as well as yours. Don't give all the affection yourself*
let the bird give you some of his. Love is such a delicately adjusted
scale, if one side begins to love too much, the other will assuredly
start to love too little. A healthy sense of proportion on each
side makes a "just balance." Among all the tame parrots I have-
kept I have never found two with characters quite alike. In this,
respect they are like dogs. At the present time I have only two,
both blue-fronted Amazons. " Rollo " the older bird is very fine.

rich and clear in colour, but he has one toe missing. He used to
live in the house and was soon very tame. His delight was to sit
on my shoulder whilst I wrote my letters and amuse himself by
abstracting my hairpins. I used to hear them dropping behind
me one by one as I wrote. " Hollo " had also a naughty habit of
biting my linen collar, a proceeding that gave him much interest;
he was very fond of giving me little friendly rubs and pecks in the
neck, or biting my ear very gently. He is a bird that continually
talks to himself with a mixture of curious little noises and words.
Every night " Rollo's " cage was carried up and put on a
stool on the staircase landing, so as to allow the maid to open
the room windows well in the morning. If you do not take this
precaution with a parrot it will probably take cold and die, for the
maid may never think of the bird getting chilled, and the early
morning air is so cold in a room.
My little fox-terrier had always been jealous of " Rollo," and
one day an accident happened. His cage got upset and the bird
was frightened. Soon after this a little blister appeared on bne eye,
and the sight on that side entirely went, t&apos;hough the eye itself looks
almost normal. But the worst of it was the bird's whole character
began to change. I had put him loose in one of the aviaries and
he took to flying at my face. I am not generally frightened of
birds but I began to get nervous, and almost wished the bird had
died, for he seemed so fierce and unhappy, and I thought his brain
was affected. We caught him and put him back in his cage, for
he was really unsafe, and I attended to him nearly always myself,,
for whenever anyone came near he would strike out with his beak.
After a long time " Rollo " quieted down and I ventured to let
him loose again, and gradually trusted him on my hand. I had
to go very slowly, for my own sake as well as the bird's, and for
long I never ventured to pet him. But I think his reformation is
now lasting and complete, and the real love he had for me has
returned. The other day on offering him a tit-bit he distinctly
showed me it was not that he wanted but just to come on my
hand to be talked to and petted. He is just a little nervous, if
stroked on his blind side, but in no way fierce, and what is very
curious he seems to have entirely forgotten how to fly, though his

-wings are very strong and perfect. I take " Rollo " often out in
the garden on my hand, or put him on the ground whilst I work.
He is very happy walking about near me, picking up bits of soil
and green, and talking continually to himself the whole time. He
will let me put both hands under him and pick him up, and a parrot
must he very tame to let you do this without biting. I do not
know if the bird would let anyone else touch him, as I look after
him entirely myself. He is very happy with me, and we shall look
forward to many pleasant hours gardening together, for he is quite
a little companion in my work. " Rollo " lives almost entirely on
sunflower and a little hemp, besides nuts, apple, and biscuit. It
seems to suit him, for his plumage is very " tight " and so glossy
and clear coloured as to almost shine in the sun. He never tries to
bite me now, but is just as friendly as he was before the accident,
though at the time I thought his case was hopeless and that he
\0x25A0would never again be anything but fierce.

BREEDING NOTES OF 1916.
By W. H. St. Quintin.
I should be grateful if a little space may be allowed for some
long delayed notes upon certain breeding operations which took
place amongst my birds last summer (1916).
A pair of Stone-curlews, hand-reared by a friend in the eastern
counties in 1914, and which afterwards came into my possession,
\0x25A0showed signs of breeding in the middle of May. The larger and darker
coloured bird which had been reared from the egg in an incubator,
though always very tame, was on May 14th extremely pugnacious,
fighting with my hand, spreading her tail and wings, and uttering
shrieks of passionate excitement. The other, which is the male
is smaller and paler, with clearer markings, and is tame enough,
but always wary. It was picked up half grown, and reared with
the &amp;lt;5ther. I am not sure if this difference in size is typical of the
sexes, but I should think it is largely due to the different manner
in which these two birds were reared. On May loth there was

a "rubbing" in the gravelly sand of the aviary floor, and later a
few small flat chalk stones were lying in the hollow evidently placed
there by the birds. However, nothing came of it, and I have a
\0x25A0note that on June 5th the Stone-curlews had left their rubbing,
though they still seemed wary and suspicious.
On June 6th they had an egg in another place, and on the
7th the clutch was complete, the nest being in a good position, just
within the protection of a lean-to shed; and one bird was sitting
\0x25A0at 7 p.m. Both birds incubated, and the eggs were seldom uncovered
*for more than a minute or two, though in spite of their real tameness,
the birds' natural caution led them to slip off the eggs, if they
\0x25A0heard approaching footsteps. However, after sitting fifteen days,
the birds gave it up, the eggs proving unfertile. Though the Stone-
curlews are looked upon as a link between the Bustards and the
Plovers, besides several of the more obvious points of difference,
\0x25A0such as the assumption of a breeding dress in the case of the Bustards,
the aviculturist notices that, unlike the Bustards, but resembling the
Plovers, the Stone-curlews are fond of bathing, while the male shares
in the duties of incubation.
On June 7th a Falcated duck was accidentally put off her
\0x25A0nest in a nettlebed under a pine tree, some thirty yards from the
water. The nest and eggs, of which there were five, closely
resembled those of the common Wigeon, or Gadwall. On the 12th
the nest was disturbed and three of the eggs were broken, possibly
by others of the species, as they were seen quarrelling together.
The two remaining eggs, which appeared quite cold, were put under
\0x25A0a hen, and they hatched on July 3rd. The ducklings closely
resembled young Wigeons, the most striking points of difference
being that in the young Falcated ducklings, the sides of the head
were reddish, and the bill altogether longer and stouter than in
the case of a Wigeon of similar age. While there was a line through
the eye it was not very well defined. There was no spot on the
ear, and no line from the angle of the mouth backwards. These
notes were made when the birds were about a week old. As they
grew, the reddish patches on the sides of the head vanished, and
they might pass for young Mallard ducklings. The walk of the
duckling is clumsy like that of the adult. Altogether there do not

Breeding notes of 1916.
seem to be obvious grounds for including this bird in the genus
Querquedula (Teal). In many ways it constantly reminds one of the
Gadwall. The young were easily reared, and began to feather when
three weeks old. At two months it was evident that they were
a pair. Both birds greatly resembled an adult female, but the male
duckling exceeded the other in size considerably, with a more
conspicuous wing-bar, the whole wing being brighter in colour in
his case, when the wing was spread.
On December 1st a few adult feathers were visible in the
male, down the sides of the throat and chest. A gradual assumption
of the adult plumage went on during the winter, and now, at the
beginning of March, the birds' smart dress is practically complete,
including the wonderful curved inner secondaries, a few brown
feathers only remaining between the shoulders, and on the belly.
A pair of the charming Bed-headed Bullfinch, described by
our Editor in the Magazine for April, 1915, given to me two years
earlier by our much-lamented fellow member, Major B. Horsbrugh r
bred in a yew bush, making a typical Bullfinch's nest, and laid
three eggs slightly less round, and more sparingly marked than
those of the European species usually are. Incubation began on
July 21st, and three young were hatched on August 4th (fourteenth
day). One young nestling died, but. the other two had left the
nest on the 21st, and were able to fly a few yards. The parents
\0x25A0were delightfully confiding, and would fly up and perch on a bundle
of seeding weeds held out to them. The young were partially fed
on ripening seeds of groundsel, shepherds-purse, and dock; but the
parents collected a great deal of small insect food, probably aphis,
and searched foliage and branches diligently, as well as catching
a good deal on the wing, in which performance they showed a good
deal of agility. The young, which turned out to be a pair when
first fledged, showed no colour, yellow or green, and their beaks
\0x25A0were yellowish, instead of black as in the parents.
By Christmas they had almost assumed the adult plumage,
and now (March) they are indistinguishable from the old birds, so
that I am glad that I separated them in good time.&quot;&apos;
* [This is, we believe, the hist time that this species of Bullfinch has successfully
reared young in the British Isles, as is also perhaps the case with the Pink-
browed Rose Finch.--E d.]

A pair of the Pink-browed Rose Finch (Carpodacus rhodopelus )
nested only 4 ft. away from the Bullfinches, in the same yew-bush,
though there were an abundance of vacant sites in other parts of
the large aviary. The Bullfinches were the first-comers, but they
raised no opposition, and five young Rose-finches left the nest on
August 25th. The nest was like that of a Greenfinch, perhaps
rather smaller and with more of a cup. Unfortunately the young
were hatched before the nest was located, and the eggs were
not seen.
The parents fed chiefly on insects, and hunted bushes and
ground industriously. Probably they fed also on half-digested
birdseed, but they paid no attention to the "trusses" of seeding
weeds, supplied at short intervals for the bullfinches.
The male parent showed plenty of " colour " last summer, but
the young family finally reared (three, for two disappeared) greatly
resembled the adult female, though one seems to me to have the
eye stripe more clearly defined, and may turn out to be a cock.
These Rose-finches are shy and most reclusive, and are not
particularly interesting birds to keep.
We had one Eider's nest last spring, a duck selecting the
same (to our eyes very unsuitable) site, as she had used for several
previous seasons. But this time she laid five eggs, the largest
clutch which I have ever known here in an experience of thirty
years with these birds. Five strong ducklings were hatched under
a hen--one died suddenly on one of the few hot days of last summer
(August 4th) probably sunstroke, to which eider ducklings are very
prone; but the other four were successfully reared. Curiously all
five turned out to be male birds.
DEVOTION.
(The True Story of a Pair of Pigeons.)
By Aubyn Trevor-Battye.
In the sea-caves of the coasts of Britain and in the rocks^
of many European countries live certain pigeons which, because of
their colouring and of their haunts, are known as Blue Rock-pigeons.

Mr. Aubyn Trevor-Battye,
Indeed, there are races of the same bird in almost every country of
the Old World. All these races are very much alike--blue, with
two black bars across the wings, and a black bar on the tail; but
whereas our bird has white feathers above the tail, this character
becomes less distinct as we go East, until, in Lower India, it is
lost altogether. From their rocky abodes these birds have spread
to cities; they are equally at home about St. Paul's Cathedral,
St. Mark's in Venice, San Sophia in Constantinople, or the mosques
of Delhi, but, as cave-dwellers by origin, have never really taken
to the habit of perching in trees. Although so common, "Blue
Kocks" are birds of great interest because they are the ancestors
of all domestic pigeons. Just as all breeds of poultry are sprung
from jungle-fowl (and this is why poultry do so well in a wood),
so each variety of fancy pigeon--Pouter, Fantail, or what not--is a
development from the Blue Kock-pigeon.
Now, excepting under the specialised form known as
"homers," the birds are not very often found in dove-cotes; fancy
pigeons are more popular, and, further, although Blue Pocks adapt
themselves to a half-wild life in the towns, where parapets of
buildings supply the place of ledges in caves, they are not very
\0x25A0easy to establish in the ordinary dove-cote. The only place, indeed,
in our neighbourhood in which the writer happens to know for
</bodyText>

We were therefore overjoyed when Miss Mary Bonham-Carter
(whose life was kindnesses) presented us with three little pigeons.
Two had just reached the "squeaker" stage, one was barely out
\0x25A0 of " squabhood," and though it lived to become the pet of the
schoolroom, it signalised its first day of liberty by fatally falling
down a chimney. The other two--they proved to be a pair--grew
up quite happily in the dove-cote. Unfortunately, just about the
time when they had their first nest, they were ejected by a pair
*of Barn Owls. There was no excuse for the owls; out of several
boxes up in the trees they had chosen the one they liked best, in
this they had reared at least one family, and they could not wish for
Letter quarters. ^luch as we love our owls we did not want them
in the dove-cote; however, in they went, there they are still, and
.there, it seems, they propose to remain. It mattered little to the

pigeons; an open window gave them access to a loft, and here they
nested again; indeed, at one time, things really seemed to he shaping
well for a little *tiock of Blue Rock-pigeons. But it happened that
we were away from home&apos;for rather more than a year, and during our
absence the loft was visited by a poaching cat. The last tragedy
took place just as we returned home in May, 1915, when the cat
finished its ravages by killing the Adhurst pair; nothing was left
but their one surviving orphan. It was all too sad ; we had to start
again from the very beginning, or worse--with one pigeon instead
of two.
The best chance of starting these pigeons is to begin with
a nestling pair; yet it seemed just possible that a new pigeon might
be induced by the one already here to stay, and since a flock of
tame pigeons (usually sprung from a single pair) become much bred
"in and in," it was best to try and get "fresh blood." Before the
war these pigeons could be bought almost anywhere for a shilling
apiece, for they were constantly being netted for pigeon-shoots, but
now not a Blue Rock was to be found. Every likely place--Leadenhall
Market, the slums of Bristol, the dealers in Liverpool, the columns
of the 'Exchange and Mart'--was tried, but tried in vain. The
answer was always the same, " The Government regard them as
' homers,' so we are not keeping them." Our little foundling, then,
had to remain companionless, and for the present the idea of keeping
Blue Rocks had to go. In this strait some kind friends gave us two
pairs of Modena pigeons, very beautiful birds, in which the black
wing-bars are curiously reproduced in chestnut on a blue ground.
They were put into a place which we will call the aviary.
The tragedies of his childhood had made the young Blue Rock
(it turned out to be a male bird) very wild and shy; for some time,
if feeding, he would start oft on the wing at the slightest sound or
sudden movement; but he became tamer and tamer, until at last
he would feed from the hand. We became very fond of this bird,
and somehow he took the name of Tweetie. All through that
summer and the winter following Tweetie remained about the place
alone; not literally always quite alone, for, from time to time,
parti-coloured pigeons would appear from somewhere else to visit
him, but they never stayed long. Spring came, and then we felt

<bodyText confidence="0.984880105263158" page_id="9411922"  page_num="Page 254" year="" vol="">
Mr. Aubyn Trevor-Battye,
sure that Tweetie would soon leave us to take up his quarters
in some neighbour's dove-cote. The parti-coloured pigeons came
more often with the spring; one in particular, a reddish hen with
white patches, played up to Tweetie a good deal, but to no
purpose--Tweetie was an aristocrat, and he knew it, and would
have nothing to say to a mongrel bird. And then be began to
lly round in ever-widening circles, and then to disappear for
hours at a time. He always flew south ; one could see him flying
round wider and farther and over the trees, until suddenly he was
off like an arrow, winging his way past church and village to be lost
to sight. But he was always home by roosting time. The loft
where he was hatched seemed to hold memories too sad for Tweetie;
from time to time he flew in at the window, but always hurried out
again, and the dove-cote was held by the Barn Owls; he had therefore
made his quarters away up in the cornices of an old barn, whose
timbers, even in the worst weather, gave him plenty of chance for
playing about.
Summer wore to autumn and nesting-time had passed; and
then there fell a day when the bird went off on one of diis long,
straight flights, and that day he did not come back ; the sun went
dowm, the dew fell, and the old barn was empty. The sun was high
on the third day when a shadow passed across the grass, and on
fanned wings down over the tree-tops came gliding a pair of pigeons
and settled on the house ; Tweetie had brought home a wife! But
for the absence of the white spot she was like him to a feather.
Now, Adhurst St. Mary is by the map two miles off as a pigeon
flies, so the pair had made a pretty fair flight. Tweetie went on in
a rather ridiculous way with this new possession ; he puffed out his
chest, trailed his wings and made circles round her, cooing, while
constant bowing must have made his back quite stiff. He took her
to see everything he could think of ; they flashed into the loft and
out again, and settled on the dove-cote, peeping over to see about
the Barn Owls whom they judged to be asleep at that time of day.
But their great haunt was the old barn where much cooing went on
among the beams. The new bird, rather shy at first, soon grew
tame, though never quite so confiding as her mate. In the depth of
last winter they began collecting straws for a nest, till the cold

weather stopped it. But, nesting or no, the old barn was still their
favourite retreat, and always, after feeding was finished, they would
fly back there and disappear in its recesses. And here we may
explain that all our birds have been on war rations ; that is to say,
the feeding is done most carefully and not in the liberal way of
better days. Only just so much food is given as a careful estimate
shows will provide each bird with a cropful at each feeding, and the
birds have been in perfect health, as indeed birds always are on this
system.
In the opening days of March the Blue Bocks began again to
nest. The nest, of course, was somewhere up near the roof of the
old barn, but in those dim recesses no one could say exactly where
it was. The weather of that time we all remember, and it seemed
very doubtful whether this second venture would meet with any
better success. The birds evidently sat for a time (pigeons sit
alternately), but as both were seen off the nest together now and
then, they seemed to have given it up, though as the keeper of the
pigeons was absent from home for some days, they were not very
carefully watched. On his return the pigeons were about as usual,
taking their food and flying back to the barn just in their accustomed
way. On the last day of March, a Saturday, they were to be seen
sitting side by side on a window-sill looking much bunched up and
unhappy with the cold, for it was a bitter day with showers of driven
snow. On Palm Sunday morning, April 1st, they took their food as
usual, flew back to their barn, and--were never seen again. Sunday
passed and Monday, Tuesday came, and yet the calls to feeding
brought no Blue Rocks; Tweetie and his mate were missing, and
things were very sad.
That day the snow lay thick upon the ground. In the course
\0x25A0of the morning someone looking from a window suddenly cried that
Tweetie had come back ! So indeed it really seemed, for there,
sitting in the snow, close to the aviary, was a Blue Rock-pigeon !
The Modena pigeons in the aviary were in a state of great excite-
ment, flying about and cooing all the time. But it was not Tweetie
.and what do you think it was ? It was a young Blue Rock, perfect
in feathering, but the yellow down still upon its head. More
strange still, inside the aviary was a second youngster, who had

evidently managed to get in through a small opening underneath a
board. The first bird was the bigger and was all blue like the hen
we had lost; but the smaller bird was the absolute image of
Tweetie down to the white tail-spot. So, after all, everyone had
been wrong, the nest had been deserted, but aw 7 ay up in the shadows
of the old barn, in spite of all the frost and snow, the eggs has
been hatched and the little ones brought up. But was it not
wonderful that these young pigeons, only able to fly so very feebly,
had not only lived so long without being fed, but had actually
managed unaided to leave the barn and find their way in the snow
round to the aviary in answer to the cooing of the Modena birds!
They are now 7 doing well in a new pigeon-room, and the hopes for
the future rest on them, the children of Tweetie and his Adhurst
mate.
^ s{c
You already see the point of the story. Young pigeons-
are not fed like other young birds, they actually feed them-
selves from the parents' crop ; for at that time the food in a
pigeon's crop changes its character to that state known as " pigeon&apos;s-
milk," though this soon gives place to solid food still taken from
the crop. At this time, therefore, the old birds need at least a
double allowance of food, part for their young and part for them-
selves. But no one had known of the nestlings' existence, and
so these poor, devoted birds had brought up their young on a
single allowance of food, and in doing this had starved themselves.
They might have given up long before, have allowed the young to
starve, and have kept the food for their own w 7 ants. But, with a
wonderful practice of devotion and self-sacrifice, they had carried
their task of affection through ; and it was not until that day
came when their full-grown young being able to fly, they judged
them able to fend for themselves, that they at last took wing for
some more hospitable home where at least they could get enough
to eat.
" Well, that is not much of a story ! "
It is not much of a story ; but I think perhaps it was ju&amp;fc
worth telling in war-time, don't you ? "

Last winter was certainly the coldest I ever experienced
at Villers-Bretonneux (Somme) since I have kept birds. Up to
January 20th the weather was soft and rainy; afterwards a little
snow fell, and it froze hard until the middle of February ; about
every night the thermometer indicated --15* C. and more.
The ice in the pond exceeded 45 cm., and all the birds kept
out of doors had only ice or snow to slake their thirst.
All that time the sun shone and the wind blew only the last
week; and the war prevented the cold from being mitigated on
account of want of coal, etc.
The following birds bore the cold weather outdoor without
any shelter and are in good health:
Grey Rheas, Emus (their clutch being stopped by the frost),
common, black, and Bewick's swans.
Geese. --Coreopsis, Indian, Upland, Maned, etc.
Ducks and Teal (even ringed Teal), Peafowls (common, black-
winged, white, and even six young " spicifer ' recently imported,
which were displaying on the ice).
</bodyText>
<reference confidence="0.954879357142857">
Pheasants. --Monauls, Tragopans, Peacock, Elliott, Mikado,
Soemerring, etc.
Crossoptilons, lineated, white-crested, purple, black-backed
Kaleeges, Siamese Fireback, Californian, Cuban, Montezuma Colins.
Pigeons and Doves. --Bleeding-heart, bronze-winged, grey-
headed ; triangular spotted, white-backed, crested, white-spotted,
and fair Pigeons (and their hybrids) ; tigrini, palm, ruddy, blue-
spotted, bar-shouldered, zebra, diamond, scaly, etc.
Goffin's, Leadbeater's, and rosy-breasted Cockatoos ; Swainson
Lorrikeets; black-headed Conures; Senegalese Parrots; pileated
Parrot ( Peonopsittacus piliatus) ; Adelaide, Pennant s, etc. Parra-

(Molutkrus bonariensis) ; and numerous Weavers (Madagascar,

Mr. H. Stuart Dove
The cranes, storks, etc., were out of doors during the day, but
driven into an unheated house for the night. The ostriches and
white rheas remained in their unheated shed, whose windows were
opened in the morning. The macaws and other parrots and parra-
keets lived well in an unheated room and bore the frost every night
without harm. The other birds remained in the heated house
when indeed the thermometer indicated sometimes only 4* C. In
spite of this low temperature, sun and sugar-birds, tanagers, etc.,
never had any disease ; two birds only died of pulmonary illness,
but perhaps the most valuable--they were both the Wilson's Paradise
birds. It is a great pity, for they were in such good condition. The
great Paradise bird did not suffer.
Other losses are the following :
Some great egrets, stupidly kept out of doors during the first
days, and though sheltered afterwards, soon died, as well as some
pochards and tufted ducks, which had no water to swim in ; the
black-necked swans, variegated sheldrakes, black-backed geese, and
all the tree-ducks, kept indoors only at night-time and out of doors
by daylight, died also. The American black-backed geese lived well.
On the ice some crows killed about twenty teals and small
ducks, as well as some black-headed gulls. One splendid cock
Borneo fireback and one hen Germain's peacock pheasant were
found dead, although sheltered by night.
Nevertheless, one may consider that the exotic bird's endur-
ance of the cold is quite wonderful. I hope these observations will
be of some interest for the bird-lovers, and that my failures will
assist them in avoiding losses such as mine during future winters.

During the last week of October a tunnel of the Spotted
Pardalote was investigated near the Devil's Punchbowl, Northern
Tasmania. A nest was found ready for eggs in the terminal chamber,
and was, as before, a sphere of fine gum bark, with side entrance.

On another occasion, while exploring the vicinity of Distillery Creek,
in the Launceston district, we encountered a large tree which had
fallen during a gale, and which still had a quantity of soil packed
into&apos; the hollow of the butt. Into this mass of earth a Pardalote had
burrowed, and in the chamber at the end had formed a nest of dry
grass, which was vacant. The bore was in just such a situation as
depicted in Campbell's 1 Nests and Eggs of Australian Birds ' as the
breeding-place in Queensland of the Black-headed Pardalote, where
the tunnel is driven into the soil still adhering to the butt of an
overturned forest giant. It is contrary to the usual practice of the
Spotted Diamond-Bird in Tasmania to construct its nest of grass,
therefore the example cited above may possibly have been that of
the Yellow-tipped Pardalote (P. affinis), or, in vernacular, the " Tree
Diamond," because it generally utilises a hole in a tree-trunk or
branch, often at a considerable height, in which to place its grass
nest. But it is said occasionally to make an earth bore, therefore it
is possible that the tunnel among the upturned roots may have been
the work of that species. As there were no eggs, nor could we see
any birds about the trunk, it was not possible to make certain. The
Yellow-tipped Pardalote is the lively little bird which appears in
numbers in the springtime among the big eucalypts, calling inces-
santly " Pick-it-up ! pick-it-up ! ' or, as some interpret the notes,
" Wit-e-chu." While living in the forest near Table Cape, North-
West Tasmania, I used to notice about the same time each spring
this familiar call resounding among the trees where it had not been
heard all through the winter months, and from this fact, and not
seeing any of the birds themselves, I believe the Yellow-tipped species
to be a migrant, although the Spotted Pardalote (P. punctatus ) stays
with us all the year. The Pipit (Anthus australis), popularly known
as the " Ground-Lark," certainly does leave us in autumn, and
reappears just about the same time in spring as the " Tree-Diamond,
which is strong presumptive evidence in favour of the latter s
migration. The Pipit is another of our ground builders, constructing
its cup-shaped nest of grass in a depression of the earth, usually
under a tuft. This species has a curious sibilant note, something
like " Sssssiou," and its song, delivered during a short ascending
flight, partakes of the same sibilant character; the descent is

accomplished by a slanting glide with wings outspread. It is one
of our most familiar birds ; every paddock of short grass, racecourse,
recreation ground, or similar enclosure has its one or more pairs of
Pipits through the spring and summer.
Seaweed as a Nesting Material. --Some of the Sordid
Wood-Swallows ( Artamus sordidus), which visit us every year for
nesting purposes from the mainland, did not go inland as usual this
year (1915), but remained in the vicinity of Mersey Bluff to breed in
the small white gums which are native there, and in the imported
Monterey pines. During December, 1915, one of their nests was
blown down from a tree close to the beach, and was found to be
perfectly new and clean. The builders had made a new departure
for Wood-Swallows (as far as my experience goes) by forming an
outer nest or substantial foundation of dry seaweed from the beach,
and then placing a light, ornamental, inner nest of fibres upon the
weed. The foundation was mainly stems of hard, dry, black seaweed,
with one or two small dry gum-twigs interwoven; on the sides were
a piece or two of the weed with narrow blades, but stems formed by
far the larger part. The upper nest was formed of very long, light-
brown fibres (one measured 15 in in length), curved into a shallow
cup upon (and mostly within) the black outer nest. The measure-
ments were: Outer nest--width, 6 in.; height, 2 in.; inner nest--
width outside, 4 in.; width inside, 2^ in. ; depth, 1J in.
Mr. II. C. Thompson, of Launceston, has supplied me with
details of nests which he and his son, Mr. P. C. Thompson, found in
December, 1910, near Kelso, Northern Tasmania. The first was that
of the Dusky Pobin ( Amaurodryas vittata), built in a niche in a
gum-tree some 50 yards from the beach, and about 5 ft. from the
ground. The foundation was composed of black, narrow, dry sea-
weed, also a few pieces of green weed with velvety surface; sides of
nest were of usual material--grass, pieces of bark, and a little
spider-web--with a few pieces of seaweed interwoven. Measurements
not taken, but about usual size. In the same district several pairs
of Tree-Martins ( Petrochelidon nigricans ) were observed going in and
out of an aperture, about 15 ft. from the ground, in a very large
gum-tree. Some of the birds were carrying pieces of seaweed 3 in.
or 4 in. in length. Mr. Thompson and son obtained a ladder, and,

having enlarged the opening, found that there were three nests
some distance above the aperture. The birds had made a run from
the aperture to the nests by placing seaweed upon the decayed wood.
The nests were shallow&apos; depressions scraped in the wood-dust, with
a few gum leaves and bits of seaweed for lining. Another nest w'as
in the small hollow spout of a large gum, about 40 ft. from the
ground, and had to be reached with the aid of a rope. In the spout
about 9 in., a few pieces of grass and leaves and seaweed had been
placed, and on this were three young Martins. All the nests were
within 200 yards of the beach. Some of the weed used was green,
hut most of it was dry.
CORRESPONDENCE.
Dear Sir, --It was with much interest that I read Mr. Teschemaker's article
in the May number of the ' Avicultural Magazine.' I have kept hand-reared
nightingales for some years, and they make the most charming and intelligent
of all bird pets, and under proper conditions, the happiest. I find that nightin-
gales do best in a large cage in a sunny room, where they can get at least an hour s
liberty every day.
My present beauty always picks out the hottest corner and suns himself,
spread out like a butterfly. He is a fine specimen, well coloured, and a wonderful
songster; he has always been much petted and his tameness amounts to positive
cheek. The first nightingale I had was a much smaller and greyer bird, and only
on rare occasions made the slighcest approach to a song.
Bechstein mentions two varieties, and some fanciers recognise two distinct
British species--the small, greyish bird, and the large brown one, both of which
types were well marked in my two birds, both undoubted cocks.
Only those who are willing to spend a certain amount of time and trouble
on their pets should attempt to keep'nightingales, or any of the soft bills. If one
must keep a bird in captivity the least one can do is to look after its health and
comfort.
Absolute cleanliness is essential, and, of course, suitable food. Cecto,
powdered biscuit, an occasional meal of bread and milk, finely minced cooked meat
used with caution in cold weather and when insect food is scarce, cooked potatoes
and cabbage, chopped lettuce and chick-weed, grated carrot, cheese, chopped
currants, grapes, apple, meal-worms, and every spider, ear-wig, or blue-bottle one
can lay hands on--all find a place on my bird's menu. Nightingales certainly
require a certain amount of grit, and when insect food is not available, something
is wanted to take the place of beetles' wings, etc., which help the formation of the
little pellets of undigested matter which the bird ejects.

If a caged nightingale looks puffed out and mopy, let it loose in the room for
a time. I have seen mine devour seed-husk, and even small feathers, which seem
to act much as coarse grass on a dog.
All soft-bills require great care with regard to the feet. Damp cocoa-nut
fibre with a small heap of sand in a corner makes an excellent floor, and there
should be a good supply of clean water for bathing. I have seen my bird sitting
in his bath fairly shouting out his song.
As Mr. Teschemaker remarks, nightingales have an artistic temperament
and are very touchy about their talents.
Mr. Lund, of Burnham, to whom I owe most of my success in bird-keeping,
once sent one of his birds as a pupil to mine, who was in full song. I looked
forward to a glorious duet, but to my sorrow not one note would my rascal utter.
For a week he kept up a sulky silence with intervals of most shocking bad language.
When I sent Mr. Lund's bird home my Philomel nearly burst himself with song.
On one occasion only I had a serious row with my pet. It was all about a
fearsome-looking insect he was trying to swallow. I was sure the thing looked
unwholesome and tried to grab it. Of course he was much annoyed and with a
tremendous gulp he bolted the wriggling victim and then turned and deliberately
hit me with his two little fists, like a diminutive and very angry game cock.

To the Editor of the Avicultural Magazine.
You will, I think, be interested to hear that I have a nest of the large black
tanagers with sulphur rumps (Rhamphoccdus icteronotus). They laid two eggs, both
of which hatched, but one young bird disappeared on the fifth day, the other is
doing well so far. I have also a pair of purple-headed glossy starlings wanting to
nest, but they do not settle down to any one spot. If the starlings are successful
the feeding may be a difficulty, but I am glad to say I have heaps of mealworms
and stick insects. By the way; the mealworms never did really well with me till
I used straw bottle-covers in the breeding boxes, with only two layers of sacking on
the top. 1 am inclined to think the sacking was apt to heat and kill the eggs, I
have now almost endless worms from two breeding boxes.
Well; you will remember that I had rather a bad time with the tanagers
Goodfellow brought from Ecuador. You will also remember they were fed largely
on rice, and, that as he had imported on rice, I stuck to it. Some time ago I was
talking to Sir George Watt., who is perhaps the greatest authority living on rice, he
is also a medical man. In our discussion I got Sir George on to my birds, and
managed to interest him ; I told him the symptoms, and he at once said that they
were the symptoms of feeding on a starchy rice such as the large Burmah rices,

which, except tor making puddings, were not fit for human food, and would almost
certainly be fatal to birds. I stopped giving rice to the tanagers, but alas, a bit
too late. Since I stopped rice as a food, those birds that showed the bad
symptoms, viz., a much distended bowel, have recovered.

The springtime having at length arrived, my Shamas, with
immense satisfaction, found themselves free of all bars and cages in
their summer quarters--a small aviary, of which they are the sole
tenants.
Owing to unseemly bullying tactics on the part of Bob, which
his wife did not appear to appreciate, also in consequence of a rather
sudden drop in temperature, I considered it wise to remove her
indoors again for a week. During this period I gave her plenty of
live food, and when she rejoined her husband she seemed in much
better form.
Almost immediately building operations started, in the house
provided for the purpose--a good-sized oak box, covered in front with
virgin cork to resemble a tree trunk, with an entrance bearing a
somewhat remote resemblance to a woodpecker's hole.
Attached to their compartment is a glazed shelter, for sitting
in, one end of which is formed by the wire-netting of their aviary.
This wire-netting is fitted with a small door, through which the
birds can be admitted into the shelter, if desired, and I am in the
habit of sitting there with one or both occupying any portion of my
anatomy they may fancy.

Mr. G. E. Low,
the small communication door was left open, the omission not being
observed when the outer door was opened to air the shelter in the
afternoon.
On returning from a short walk I was horrified to find the
aviary empty, and at the same time to distinguish Bob's song of
triumph in the distance, floating on the breeze over fields and hedges,
the attraction of spending their honeymoon abroad with travelling so
cheap being altogether too much for them.
Anyone who has had an experience such as this will he able
to appreciate in a measure my feelings of blank despair and dis-
appointment at that moment. A great piece of luck, however,
supplied me with the key to the situation, the bride being discovei'ed
sitting on a crossbar--unseemly attitude--in the greenhouse, looking
in no way discomposed, with door and windows wide open.
She consented to be transferred to a cage, and having fully
explained to her the situation we proceeded to search for the sporting
bridegroom.
I eventually marked him down in a thick thorn hedge in
rather a public locality, singing lustily at intervals, the quality of the
song being considerably ahead of his usual performances. He made
a very attractive picture, flitting about through the bright green
foliage, always at a discreet distance.
I deposited Kate on the gi'ass with an empty cage on the
top of hers, baited with mealworms and cockroaches, a wire being
attached to the door, which was propped open.
Making myself as scarce as possible I thought my sporting
friend would quickly come down, as he is usually so very tame.
Having tasted freedom, however, he was as wild as possible, and I
could see him regarding me from the middle of the hedge with a look
in his eye which seemed to convey : " If you hadn't got my un-
fortunate little wife boxed up there, don't flatter yourself I should
long remain hanging around in your neighbourhood." However, the
attractions of cockroaches and mealworms, rather more I think than
those of Kate, were his undoing, and after over three hours' patient
waiting he hopped into the unoccupied cage at just 7 p.m., and the
door was rapidly closed on a very disgusted bird--need I say with
what satisfaction to his owner ?

on further episodes in the life of a pair of Shamas. 267
Both the honevmooners very soon found themselves back in
their old quarters. Building operations were almost at once resumed,
and on the following Thursday (May 17th) the first egg was laid.
Five completed the clutch, and four young birds hatched out on
June 1st and 2nd. On June 12th the first baby left the nest, being
put back in the evening, and on the following day all left the family
roof.
It was very interesting to watch the parent birds' efforts to
induce the young ones to come out, going to the entrance with food
and withdrawing without giving it.
After the house was empty the cock entered and had a good
look round, singing to himself, sotto voce, all the time, with an
occasional chuckle suggesting the inquiry, " Any more for the
shore?" He spent a good deal of time inside the box at this
juncture, constantly exhorting his wife to hurry up and settle the old
nest for a new family.
On June 18th the young birds were pretty strong on the wing,
although not yet inclined to feed themselves, and the first egg of the
second batch was laid.
For a day or two before the young left the nest I noticed the
hen sitting, often for quite a long time, on the edge, making occa-
sional dives into the nest with her beak. I cannot decide what this
was for, as it had nothing to do with sanitary arrangements, but
suggest she may have been stripping the quills from the wing
feathers. The parents constantly carried grit by itself to the young,
and often fed them when quite young with large cockroaches, which
they preferred to the other items of their menu--mealworms, gentles,
and live ants' eggs.
When the hen was adding to the first nest, she occasionally
forgot whether she was feeding young or building the nest, and the
look of disgust on the face of the baby who had his mouth filled with
hay was quite worth going a distance to see.
I noticed one of the young babies preening his feathers on the
day after, and another actually taking a bath three days after leaving
the nest, stooping and flapping his wings in the approved style, while
five days after leaving home I saw and heard one make an attempt
to imitate the singing of an avadavat in the adjoining compartment.

Lorikeets breeding at the Zoological Gardens.
Altogether the family is a very precocious one. I have been
able to observe them pretty closely whenever I have had leisure, and
the occupation has been an exceedingly fascinating one.
As I write the hen is sitting on four eggs after laying, five--*
the last one being deposited on the ground. Seeing her laying it, I
immediately transferred it to the nest in a spoon, but I noticed it was
thrown out next day.
From the results of my experiment others may be tempted to
try the effect of allowing their birds to honeymoon in the open, but I
don't recommend it as a pastime.

It was recently decided to renovate the interior of the old
Parrot House, and in order to do this it was necessary to remove all
of the birds. The Society's motor van was requisitioned and the birds
conveyed in their cages to the Sanatorium on the other side of the
Gardens. After eleven journeys had been made the house was empty
with the exception of the large cages arranged along the north side,
which are mostly given up to lories and lorikeets. The occupants of
these were transferred to small cages to be carried over by hand, their
cages being left to be cleaned and painted. The last of these large
cages contained a pair of lorikeets, of which the male was a Swainson
and the female a Red-collared. These were caught and taken off in
a small cage as the others had been, but no sooner had they been
removed than a faint squeaking was heard proceeding from a box
hanging up in their cage. An investigation revealed two baby
lorikeets, thinly covered with whitish down. Here was a difficulty.
The work in the house had already commenced and could not be
stopped, but to remove these newly-hatched chicks seemed risky. It
was decided to fetch back the old birds at once and then on the

following day to remove birds, cage and all, to a warm room in the
Sanatorium. On their return the old birds promptly went into
the box to satisfy themselves that their chicks were still there and
flourishing.
The following morning, when the keeper climbed into their
large cage, the two parent birds immediately disappeared into the
nesting-box, which was just what we wanted them to do. A cloth
was clapped over the entrance hole and the box taken down and
carried carefully away. The cage, which is about six feet high, was
then transferred with its stand to the motor and conveyed to the
Sanatorium. The nest-box with its contents was then hung in its
usual position in the cage and the cloth removed. The birds did not
seem to resent the shifting about in the least, hut went on feeding
their young, which emerged from the nest five weeks later, in perfect
plumage and condition, their colour almost as bright as those of the
adults, but with blackish bills. They are two beauties, taking rather
more after the Red-collared than Swainson's lorikeet.
They are now back in the Parrot House, none the worse for
their travels.*

I have never been a parrot keeper, but in 1906 my son brought
home from Singapore two of the above-named hanging parrots. They
were then quite similar in plumage, but one was considerably smaller
than the other and had flesh-coloured feet; both were apparently
young birds, and the smaller one was evidently so. They were

roomy aviary with abundant shelter if they chose to avail themselves
of it; this, however, they never did, but persisted in roosting and
hanging on to the wires of the most exposed part of the aviary. I
eventually managed to fix a slate over their favourite roost, and that
was all the shelter they ever had. They both moulted out that
autumn, and, as I expected, the small bird proved to be a male, the
base of the feathers on the throat showing scarlet, also the feathers
on the rump became intensified in colour. We took them in that
autumn and they spent the winter in the house. In the spring
they were again let loose in the aviary and in the autumn moulted
out, the young cock now assuming full adult plumage. The follow-
ing spring they paired, and the hen built a nest in a deep hole in
an old apple tree. I have before described the display of the cock,
and how the female carried long strips of green aucuba leaves into
the hole, the strips of leaves being inserted into the feathers of the
upper tail coverts.
Although the hen sat practically the whole summer, and the
eggs were fertile, no young were hatched. These proceedings went on
year after year until the late autumn of 1915, when in a terrific storm
the door of the aviary was burst open and the little cock was whirled
away and never seen again. The hen was left in the open aviary all
that winter and is there still, having survived these dreadful freezing
gales, and is apparently in perfect health. I notice a few things in
connection with this, viz. that in very cold weather she does not
hang up, but roosts in the ordinary way ; also that as her sop quickly
freezes she only has a good fill of it twice a day, and makes up with
plenty of seed ; the seed is not shelled, but is nibbled up and eaten,
only a little dust remaining.
It is evident that these parrots are easily kept and much
hardier than is usually supposed, but they must be acclimatised.
I think them unsuited for a cage ; they are extremely dirty
birds and also seem to like a great deal of exercise. They have
pleasant gentle voices, but ours never became really tame.

BIRD-CAGE.
By Wallace Craig.
One who keeps birds should have facilities for isolating any
individual bird when it is sick, when it bullies others, or is bullied by
others, or when various other causes make isolation desirable. This
means that anyone who keeps many birds should have a considerable
number of cages or pens, which, if bought, are very expensive, and
often unsuited to one's needs, but which may very well be made at
home at little cost. In my own early years of bird-keeping I
struggled along with home-made wooden cages, but they were heavy,
fragile, dirty, unsanitary, inconvenient in the matter of opening
doors and changing perches, and so unsightly that they were not fit
to be seen in the house, and their clumsy wooden bars obscured the
bird from view. At last I set to work to see if I could make a metal
cage, and after trying and discarding a few other types I developed
the type of cage shown in the accompanying photograph, which has
proved so satisfactory that I am sure others will be glad to know how
to make a cage like it.
The first thing to be said about making an all-metal cage is
that it is perfectly easy. In fact, the making of these cages requires
no skill, only a certain amount of labour. The tools needed are a
pair of flat-nose pliers, a pair of wire-cutting pliers, a file, a mallet
(mine is home-made), a stick of wood cut into the shape of a chisel,
a punch (any sharpened steel rod will do), a wooden block on which
to place the galvanised sheet iron when holes are punched through
it, two straight wooden beams about 3 |ft. long, a similar piece about
12^ in. long, and two stout clamps, such as shown in Fig. 7.
The construction of the cage is shown in the accompanying
figures. Fig. 0 and Figs. 1-5 sIlow pieces of a certain type of elec-
trically welded " fencing " made by the Pittsburg Steel Co., Pittsburg,
Pa., U.S.A. This comes in rolls containing a length of 150 ft. The
width is 17 in., and in this width there are seventeen longitudinal
wires or strands, as shown in Fig. 2, so that the distance from the
centre of one strand to the centre of the next is l T y in. The distance

Mr. Wallace Craig,
between the cross wires or stays is 6 in. Unfortunately for our
purpose, each strand has a " tension curve " in it every six inches, as
shown in Fig. 0; this is to give the fabric elasticity when used as
fencing, but it is undesirable in a bird-cage, so the first thing to do
(after cutting the pieces from the roll) is to straighten every curve--
a task which, though it takes considerable time, is easily done w T ith

sides of cage, the top being 13 in. wide.
The bottom is made of a piece of thin galvanised iron (weight
about 7 |lb. per sq. yd.), cut as shown in Fig. 6. On this three
lines are drawn, kl, Im, mn, and holes are punched along two sides

wire is now bent back and clinched as shown in Fig. 9, and thus the
side is securely fastened to the bottom. Now, as shown in Fig. 7,
two straight beams of wood are laid longitudinally and fastened by
clamps at each end, the edges of the beams following the line mn.

line kl. The result is shown in Fig. 10. Figs. 7-10 are all end-
views. The back end of the cage, Fig. 3, is fastened to the bottom in
the same way, the projecting ends of the wires being thrust through
the holes, a straight beam of wood 124 in. long laid along the line Im
and clamped, and the bottom bent up. It is at this time that the
piece Fig. 1 is fastened to the piece Fig. 2 by means of the projecting
ends j, j ; similarly, the back, Fig. 3, is fastened to the sides. But
when it comes to fastening the back to the top, I insert a connected
piece, as op, Fig. 3, behind the first strand of the top, and bend the
whole over, bending along the line ef ; an end-view of the result is
shown in Fig. 13.
The front piece, Fig. 5, cannot be fastened to the bottom,
because the whole space qrst, Fig. 12, must be left open, for pulling
out the drawer or inner floor. For this reason, take a stout wire
(No. 12, American gauge; diameter, 2 - 8 mm.), place it in the position
qr, and bend each end around the first wire of side of cage. Then
take the front, Fig. 5, and bend each of its projecting wire-ends i, i
around this stout wire as shown in Fig. 14. This front is then
fastened to the sides and top in the same manner as the back was.
There are three doors--one in the front end and one in each
side. Each of these is closed by a piece of the welded wire fabric cut
as shown in Fig. 4. The four projecting wire ends are bent around
the upright wires on either side of the doorway (see photograph) ;
the door is opened by raising it, and it closes by its own weight.
Drinking-water, as is seen in the photograph, can be kept in a
glass outside the cage, which keeps it clean, the glass being held to
the cage by a single loop of fine wire. The bird puts his head out
between the wires to drink. In some cases one must see that the
bird learns to do this in order that he may not die of thirst. The
quickest way for him to learn is to see another bird drink, and then
have a chance to get a drink himself from the same glass. Once he
has learned to put his head out between the bars to drink, he never
fails to do this, and even seems to take a certain pleasure in it.

wide enough for the bird to put his head out between the wires, but
I know of no reason for so absolute a statement. No harm has ever
come to my doves from putting their heads out.
One of these cages complete costs me less than three shillings
(about 70 cents) and one day's labour; yet it is better for my
purposes than any cage made by the manufacturers, at least in this
country.* It is so strong as to be practically indestructible. No
solder is used in the cage anywhere. One of these cages which went
through the fire when my aviary burned two years ago is still in use;
probably all would have been usable after the fire had not the roof of
the building fallen on them. Although so strong, the cage is light,
weighing only about 5f lb. without the drawer. The galvanised iron
drawer weighs about 2 |lb.; a zinc drawer would be much lighter,
but during the present war zinc is too expensive. The doors are
easily opened, and the vertical wiring renders it easy to open the
doors and to place and remove perches. The wires are all galvanised,

and the cage has such a light, dainty appearance that my wife is
glad to have one in the parlour. Still more important, the cage
offers almost no obstruction to viewing the bird.
The reason I put three doors in the cage is this : I can put any
number of such cages in a row, side by side, and can have one, two,
or more rows stacked on the top of the first. From the front,
without disturbing the stack, I can give the birds all the attention
needed, removing the drawer, placing perches and nests, giving seed,
water, etc. The side doors are used to allow a bird, when so desired,
to pass from one cage into the next, which is useful in many ways :
as, for matching and mating : for allowing a timid bird to go into the
next cage while his own is being cleaned ; for allowing a pair of
birds to occupy two cages, or more than two ; and for performing
many experiments on the social behaviour of birds, this being the
subject in which I am especially interested.
Of course the cage here described, having spaces about 1 in.
wide between wires, is suitable only for such birds as doves, not for
small birds. For smaller birds one would need an electrically welded
fabric with narrower spaces and thinner wires. No such fabric is on
the market, and the manufacturers do not like to make one, because
of the difficulty of welding small wdres ; but it can be done, for The
Toledo Electric Welder Co., of Cincinnati, Ohio, made samples for
me, consisting of wires less than IT mm. in diameter welded to cross
wires 2 mm. in diameter, at distances of about half an inch. If some
firm would weld such a fabric regularly and put it on the market it
would be a boon to aviculturists. An electrically welded fabric is
wonderfully convenient for making cages : one can cut it into pieces
of any size and shape, and even the smallest of these pieces will hold
its shape, because wherever two wires cross they are welded solidly
to one another.
SPARROW CLUBS.

It is to be hoped that everybody read the admirable article
which appeared in the ' Daily Chronicle ' of May 30th, written by Lady
Warwick, dealing with the share which children are taking in the
wholesale destruction of sparrows.

At this time of all times, when the whole world is teeming
with horrors, which children of course are bound to hear about and
read of, surely it is spreading the fearful disease of cruelty among
children to allow them to have a hand in this wholesale murder of
birds, for that is what, without doubt, it will end in if children, with-
out judgment, knowledge, and, I'm sorry to say, mercy, are allowed
to join in this pitiful task with people who can, if they choose, use
judgment and knowledge.
Encouraging children to kill the birds will be the sure
undoing of all the good results gained in the last few years from the
admirable lessons in natural history and kindness to animals, given in
so many country schools. The teachers in some places have an up-
hill task, for undoubtedly there is an instinct of cruelty in a great
many children, an hereditary instinct it may be, and its development
or otherwise is almost entirely dependent on parents and others
responsible for their bringing up; but as a rule we find that part of
their responsibility deplorably neglected. " He was too young to
know better " is often the futile excuse of a parent for a child of five
or six, or even older, who has committed some hideous piece of
cruelty to a defenceless little bit of furred or feathered life !
Surely nothing can be written too strongly on this subject, for
we, bird and animal lovers all, know that where there is a free hand
given to the destruction of living creatures (sometimes necessary,
unfortunately, as in this case of thinning out the sparrows) the
human mind is in most cases so constructed that it loses all feeling,
discrimination, and mercy when it sees the word " kill " standing out
in large letters.
It would be terrible if our dear old England, with its tradi-
tions of humanity and its bird-protecting laws, were to be now bereft
of its bird life ; the charm of the country would be gone, and what
has happened on the Continent might be our fate, namely, gardens
ruined by insect pests, and then poisoning sprays used on the plants
and vegetables, as they do on the vines in Italy and Switzerland, to
destroy the blight caused there by the hordes of destructive insects,
because the small insectivorous birds have been so wantonly and
cruelly killed without restriction. Happily the Swiss are wiser now,
as is proved by the many little next-boxes nailed up in the trees to
encourage the birds to build in the gardens and round about.

An Elopement.
Good authorities on natural history, who have studied the
subject scientifically and with observation, tell us that the common
house sparrow always feeds its young on insects, and not grain or
vegetable matter, and that the adults are champions (proved by eye-
witnesses) at clearing off blight. So, even for that reason alone, to try
and exterminate him would be an act of short-sighted stupidity, to
express it mildly, and this applies also to many other kinds of birds
which are victimised in many a garden where they are doing much
more good than harm. Their reward is death ; not, as it should be, a
little share of the fruit they have helped to save.*
AN ELOPEMENT.
By Hubert D. Astley.
Mrs. Goddard, a member of the Society, tells me of an
interesting episode in connection with a hen bullfinch, which she
had kept in a cage since its childhood and which was extremely
tame, showing great affection to its mistress. In May a wild male
bird appeared one day and sat on the cage, which w r as near the open
window, and Mrs. Goddard, thinking it would be kind to allow her
favourite to mate and rear a brood, opened the cage door.
The hen bird came out as usual, and presently, beguiled by the
vociferous calling of the wild bullfinch in the bushes outside, flew out
to join him, but after a little while returned and came into the room
on to a shoulder of her mistress. But her wooer was not going to
permit any attraction other than himself, and once more returned
to the sill of the window, summoning her and beseeching her to
come away with him. For a moment it looked as if the little hen

too, to give an instance, adult humans do not know the difference between
a House sparrow and the so-called Hedge sparrow, which is an Accentor

she went.
Mrs. Goddard hoped the bullfinches would build their nest in
the garden, but she has not seen them since. The male bird evidently
thought that too close a proximity to the attractions of the home,

he took her away.
Perhaps she will return with joy later on, " bringing her

NUTHATCH.
By Henry S. Shaw, June.
[With acknowledgments and thanks to the Editor of ' Bird-Lore.']
In the fall of 1914 I began feeding the birds at my home in
Dover, Massachusetts. There was nothing elaborate or unusual in
the apparatus employed, which consisted chiefly of a window-shelf,
a weather-cock feeding-house, several wire suet-baskets and a shallow
pan for water. The feeding-house and suet-baskets were obtained
from the Dover bird-warden. After some months I discontinued the
use of the weather-cock house (except during snowstorms), preferring
to have the birds come to the shelf, where they could be more easily
observed. The suet-holders were put where they could be readily
seen from our windows, and three out of four were placed on pitch
pines, whose rough bark seemed attractive to Nuthatches and Wood-
peckers.
During the winter the shelf was visited most regularly by
Chickadees and Red-breasted Nuthatches, with an occasional White-
breasted Nuthatch and Junco. In the early spring a number of Purple
Finches appeared, and later on Chipping Sparrows were occasionally
seen. But the most unexpected visitor was a female Pine Warbler,

which came to the shelf many times each day for two or three
weeks. She kept busy while on the shelf picking up small particles
of seeds, etc., especially bits of sunflower seeds left by the Purple
Finches.
There is nothing of particular interest about the shelf itself
except, perhaps, the fact that it is easily removed for cleaning, and
has rather high sides, to lessen the likelihood of the contents blowing
off. I used sunflower seeds, hemp seeds, crumbs, and sometimes
chopped nuts.
At the present time the bark of a pitch pine which stands
near the shelf is quite thickly studded with the shells of sunflow T er
seeds which have been wedged into the crevices by White-breasted
Nuthatches. It is interesting to watch one of these birds take a sun-
flower seed from the shelf, fly with it to the tree, and then climb up
and down the trunk until a crack in the hark is found which will
hold the seed securely. Then the bird, generally head downward,
hammers the seed vigorously with its bill and easily extracts the
kernel. The little Chickadees also open the sunflower seeds by
hammering on them with their bills, and they are able to deliver
blows of considerable strength, the seed being held between the bird's
feet, either on a small branch or on the edge of the shelf. In the
latter case the noise of the pounding can easily be heard in the house,
even in an upstairs room. The Purple Finches, on the other hand,
can readily crush the seeds with their powerful bills and do not have
to resort to any hammering.
The pan of water proved an attraction even in winter, and
although the water often froze at night, it was an easy matter to
knock out the ice in the morning and refill the pan with water, which
would generally remain unfrozen during the day.
Little need be said of the suet, except that of the twelve
species of birds seen eating it the Chickadees, Nuthatches, and
Downy Woodpeckers were the most plentiful. But it is interesting
to note that, for a time in the spring, Pine Warblers, both male and
female, came to the suet quite regularly.
The birds which interested me most, I think, were the Red-
breasted Nuthatches, not only because of their tameness and quaint
-manners, but also because I associated them with the New Hamp-

shire forests where I had first become acquainted with this species.
These little birds were among my most regular visitors and seemed
to be nearly as numerous as the Chickadees. They preferred hemp
seeds and chopped nuts at the shelf and seemed especially fond of
the suet. They also drank the water frequently, and in general
appeared to be so much at home that I often thought how nice it
would be if they would stay to nest, instead of leaving for the north
in the spring. However, I hardly expected that my wish would
come true, because I knew that they were birds of the Canadian
zone, and that there were but few records of the species having bred
in eastern Massachusetts.
Therefore I was delighted when, on April 10th, I noticed a
female Red-breast carrying nesting material into one of my bird-
boxes. This is a Berlepsch box, size No. 2, made by the Audubon
Bird House Co., of Meriden, N.H. The entrance hole is 1^ in. in
diameter, and the box, which is made of yellow birch, is placed in a
white birch tree about 7 ft. from the ground. It was put up in the
hope of attracting Chickadees.
I did not see the male Nuthatch at work until April 16th,.
when I observed him carrying shreds of bark which he pulled from
the trunks and limbs of red cedars (Juniperus virginiana) growing
near by. Examination of the box after the nesting season showed
that the nest was composed exclusively of this material, the box being
filled to within an inch or two of the level of the entrance hole. The
male usually left his load at the hole without entering, and I suppose
that the material was put in place by the female inside.
On April 23rd, on my return home after a few days' absence,
I saw the male fly to the box and feed the female, who stuck her head
out of the hole. I supposed that the incubating period had com-
menced, but on April 27th I saw more nesting material being carried,
this time by the female. One of the photographs was taken with
the idea of showing the male in the act of feeding the female, but
unfortunately her head shows only indistinctly in the hole, while the
male moved his* head slightly so that the bill is somewhat blurred. I
noticed this feeding process quite often during the nesting period, and
observed that frequently the female would fly out of the box as soon
as she had received the food her mate had brought.

I had heard that the Red-breasted Nuthatch had the habit of
surrounding its nesting hole with pitch, so I was on the watch for it,
and one morning, when the light was right, I saw that there was a
thin layer of pitch close to the hole. At first this layer was so thin
and transparent that it was noticeable only when the sun was shining
on it at the right angle, but as the nesting season advanced more and
more pitch was added, so that before long it could be seen easily even
at a considerable distance. Some of the pitch was later melted by
the heat of the sun and ran down the front of the box in drops. The
pitch was placed at the lower right-hand side of the hole, but there
was in addition a thin layer which almost encircled the hole. There
was one place, however, at the lower left-hand side of the hole where
the pitch was absent, and it was always at this point that the birds
clung before entering the hole.
Natmrally I hoped I might find some clue to the birds' purpose
in putting on the pitch, but in this I was disappointed. Not only
did I fail to observe the actual process of applying the pitch, but I
was unable to see that its presence affected the movements of the
birds in any way, except that they always entered the hole at the
place where the pitch was absent. There was nothing to indicate
that the pitch would be effective in keeping out enemies or in catching
insects which might serve as food. I discussed this matter with
Mr. C. J. Maynard, the naturalist, and he suggested that it might be
a relic of some ancestral habit, when perhaps the female may have
been entirely sealed in during the nesting period. In this connection
he pointed out that at the present time there are certain species of
Hornbills in Asia and Africa in which the females are plastered up in
the nest by the males and are fed by the latter through a small hole.
But whatever is the explanation in the case of the Red-breasted
Nuthatch, it is a habit on which it would be well to have more
information.
Naturally, I w T as very desirous that the birds should not be
in any way disturbed, at least until they had become thoroughly
established in their new home. Therefore I made no attempt to see
the eggs. But on May 22nd I felt quite sure that the young had
hatched, so I cautiously lifted the lid of the box, and looking in, saw
a downy blackish mass, in which I could count seven yellow bills.

on the nesting of a Red-breasted Nuthatch. 283
I was careful to stay near the nest only for a moment, but I
discovered afterwards that I need not have been so particular, for the
old birds, especially the male, seemed to be quite unconcerned when
I approached even to within 10 ft. or so of it.
The parents were now kept busy feeding their young, and I
saw them bring winged insects, small green caterpillars, and suet.
I was interested to find that the suet apparently formed a considerable
proportion of the young birds' diet, and I saw the parents make many
trips from the suet-holders to the nest, a distance of some fifty yards.
The birds would generally make two or three trips to the suet and
then go off for something else.
On June 2nd, Mr. E. H. Forbush, State Ornithologist of
Massachusetts, came out to take some photographs. He looked into
the nest and could see at least six young birds which seemed to be
about ready to fly. They were still in the nest on June 4th, but on
the morning of June 5th the box was empty. We discovered some
of the young birds in pine trees not far away, and found that they
were active and could fly well. In fact they closely resembled the
adults except for being lighter in colour.
Several times during the next few days I saw some of the
young birds perched close to the suet, being fed with it by one of
their parents ; and in less than ten days after the young had left the
nest I saw two of them picking at it unaided.
The Nuthatches remained in the vicinity until some time in
August, but I have not seen them at all during the last six months.
It will be interesting to see whether or not any of them return in the
spring to nest.
As far as I have yet been able to ascertain, this is the first
record of the Red-breasted Nuthatch having nested in a bird-box, and
I would be glad to know if any other cases have ever been reported.
I never heard the Nuthatches give any " song " other than
their usual nasal notes, but during the breeding season they frequently
indulged in low conversational twitterings, which were both pleasing
and expressive.

[With acknowledgments to the Editor of ' Bird-Lore.']
The following story told me by Mrs. William Derby, of
Garibaldi, Oregon, of a pet Sandhill Crane that she had in Nebraska
in 1879, is interesting not only as a realistic picture of the bird's
habits in domestication, but for the hints it gives of the play
instinct, sense of humour, and general Crane psychology.-- Florence
Merriam Bailey.
" They ketched him when they was out on the prairie--they'd
been out at Swan Lake elk hunting. He was hid in the high grass,
and the old crane, he skulked off. They got out and picked him up
--he w T as nothin' but a downy feller. They ketched frogs and
cut up and give him. When they got home we'd ben off on a
clam hunt, and w 7 e fed him on clams till the corn w T as ripe in
the fall.
" He had peeped for four days under a box, and then I took
him down fishin'. He just jumped up and down and hollered--
seemed as if he laughed. He jumped up and down in the water
to w&apos;ash himself, and then, when he was through, he was ready to
leave the country--he went just as hard as he could go toward the
corn-field, and me after him. He ran onto a turkey hen, and she
knocked him into a bunch of cactus. He turned right 'round and
come for me then, peeping as hard as he could peep. I took him
up in my arms and carried him back to the house and laid him
down on the grass, and he come and sat by me. He never offered
to run again--would foller just like a dog.
" That was June. In August we built our sod-house. It took me
about five weeks to haul the sod--we had a pair of steers I was
breakin'--I was fifteen then. I'd get my sod loaded and Dick
would walk along with me. I'd say, ' Dick, let's run, have a race ;
and he'd hustle around to get him a grasshopper--native grass-
hoppers, big fellers. I'd say, ' Now Dick, you ready ? ' And he'd
say, Peep. Sometimes he'd kind o' help himself with his wings,
tiptoe along, and he'd beat me to the team. Then he'd stick up his
head, straight up, and laugh --sounded more like a person than any-

thing else--you could hear him laugh for a mile. But, if I beat him,
he didn't have nothin' to say ! "
By this time he had grown about five feet, so tall that, as
Mrs. Derby explained, " he could stretch up and feel of my face. Go
and lay down on the ground and pretend we was asleep, and he'd
feel 'round and then come and poke 'round in our heads, as if pickin'
himself, and take hold of our eyelids, to make us open our eyes--he
never would hurt--and all the time kept up a low talkin'. Then he'd
go to sleep--fold up his legs and sit down flat and put his head on
his shoulders.
" Along in the summer, a hawk or eagle or something
swooped down at him or a chicken, and Dick screamed and the old
man went out with a gun, and Dick went right up into the air and
sailed 'round, and when the bird dropped he dropped and picked him
up and throwed him 'round and laughed and peeped and made all
sorts of crane noises.
" He loved a gun--loved to go with the old man a'hunting.
If the old man would kill a goose, he'd act as if he was tickled to
death. When it began to get cold and there was snow on the ground,
he couldn't foller huntin', for they're a tender bird, and we'd have to
shut him up. He knew just as well as we did when some of us was
gettin' ready to go huntin', and he'd get uneasy." He got so that
he would go off before it was time to shut him up. " Then," as she
said, " he'd fly up in the air and sail round till he'd find us. If there
was snow on the ground, he'd stand on a hill first on one foot and
then on the other till he got off a ways, and then he'd fly and light
down by us and laugh."
In the fall he had roosted between the creek and the pond,
"But," she went on, "when it got too cold for him to do that, I'd
ketch him and put him in behind the cows. One cold night I
wanted to get him in, bad--I knew it was goin' to freeze--but he
said Peep, and Keet, keet, and got away from me. In the morning he
didn't come. I went up with my heart in my mouth--I expected to
find him dead. I got up there and he was standing on one leg, the
other one froze in the ice. I thought his leg was froze, and I says,
' Dick ! ' and he says, Peep, as pitiful. I broke the ice for him and
took him under my arm and hiked for home and stood him in a tub

of snow-water. His leg wasn&apos;t froze at all, but it was a long time
before he wanted to go to the creek again--he was a willin' barn
chicken after that.
" In the spring, when the old man went down to the town, Dick
went with me to my traps--I had traps settin' for muskrat, mink,
skunk, and wolves. Dick heerd a gun, and thought it was the old
man and flew after him. I called him and he answered me-- Peep --
but wouldn't come back. I heerd him light and laugh, and then
heerd another shot and didn't hear him laugh no more. It was
about a week we didn't see nor hear nothin' of Dick--I'd give him
up for dead. Then the old man went up to the pond fishin' one
day, and Dick was there, covered with dried blood, and weak. But
he wouldn't let him ketch him, so he come home and tell me about
it. Of course, I went up as tight as my legs would carry me. He
wouldn't let me ketch him, but he followed me home. He was pretty
near starved, but he began to pick up, to fat up.
" In about three weeks we moved away, and they wouldn't let me
take him--thought he was too weak to foller and we get him in the
fall. But after he was gone the feller who shot him before killed
him*--and we never saw no more of Dick."

On May 23rd my old hangnest (Icterus vulgaris), purchased early in 1899,
died. The cold of last winter affected many of my birds and destroyed many
flowers, as I was unable to obtain any cote for the last month or two of the snowy
weather. The hangnest had been ailing for about two months, being unable to fly
up to his perch ; but he always welcomed me with the usual sounds of clucking,
followed by a rattling b-r-r-r-r. He was not a young bird when I bought him, as
the scales on the tarsi showed, and to have kept him in a flight cage for eighteen
years is not bad I think.
On June 3rd my last remaining cock Napoleon weaver went the way of all
flesh ; he had been out of sorts for about a week. He had been in summer plumage
all the winter, but at the beginning of May began to moult into the winter plumage,
which he had partly assumed when he died. I sent him to the Natural History
Museum, as the plumage seemed to me interesting and worth preservation. I
believe this is a bird which I purchased in 1900; two or three purchased in 1907
were, I am pretty certain, placed in another aviary, where they eventually died. I
still have two females. One, I think, may be P. franciscana, but I should have to
catch it to be sure ; it is rapidiy turning black through vigorous old age.

WHYDAHS.
Sir, --I was greatly interested in Mr. Shore-Baily's article on the whvdahs
in the ' Avicultural Magazine' for March, 1917, especially so as I have all the
whydahs mentioned, or at least their East African representatives, in my aviaries
out here.
There are other whydahs in this country which Mr. Baily ought to try and
obtain, such as Pyromelana xahthomelana, the yellow-rumped whydah, Penthetria
eques, the white-winged whydah, P. hartlaubi, Coliuspasser concolor, and C. dela-
merei, etc., all of which are easily caught and travel well.
These birds have nested in my runs, but owing to overcrowding have not
been able to incubate or rear their young.
On p. 132 Mr. Baily states that Mrs. Annington succeeded in breeding the
pintail whydah, V. principalis. This is interesting, for in this country V. princi-
palis is parasitic--that is, the female lays her eggs in other finches' nests, either one
or two eggs in the nest of each host. I have never come across more than two eggs.
The eggs are pure white when blown. The most common bird to be victimised is
the small waxbill, Estrilda estrilda 7iiassaica, but I have also taken the eggs or
young from the nests of E. paludicolor, E. dclamcrei, E. rliodopyga, and from the
small fire-finch, Lagonosticta ruberrima. At this very moment there are two young
Pintails being fed just outside my aviaries by a pair of waxbills. In my aviaries
these birds have deposited their eggs in a nest of the African sparrow, Passer rufo-
cinctus, but this is no doubt due to the fact that no other birds except the sparrow
and the pintails were nesting at the same time.

Did Mrs. Annington's birds build a nest of their own, were the eggs laid in
another bird&apos;s nest, or did Mrs. Annington find them on the floor of the cage and
put them under another bird to be incubated ?
The young of V. principalis do not resemble the adults in any way. They
are a uniform hair-brown above, buff below, and with blaclush-brown bills.

THE NIGHTINGALE IN DEVONSHIRE.
Dear Sir,-- My attention has been directed to a remark by Mr. W. E.
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.978211181818182" page_id="9411963"  page_num="Page 289" year="" vol="">
Teschemaker in his recent article on the nightingale ('Avicultural Magazine,'
p. 188). In describing some local haunt of the nightingale in Devonshire, Mr.
Teschemaker suggests that the late T. H. Nelson must have mentioned it to me,
"for this remote spot was subsequently described in 'British Birds' as the best
locality in Devonshire for nightingales." No reference is given by Mr. Tesche-
maker, and I can only suppose that he refers to some statement in the article on
the " Distribution of the Nightingale," by Dr. N. F. Ticehurst and the Rev. F. C. R.
Jourdain (' British Birds,' vol. v, pp. 2-21). Dr. Ticehurst, who was responsible for
the distribution in Devon, writes me that he cannot now trace the sources of his
information (a large number of correspondents contributed notes on the subject),
but, as stated in the article, the paragraph under Devon was submitted to Mr.
D&apos;Urban, who could not have been ignorant of the facts as stated. In any case,
Nelson never mentioned the subject to me.
I do not collect eggs myself, but if anyone gathers from Mr. Teschemaker's
statement that I was anxious to journey all the way to Devonshire to collect
nightingales at the extreme limit of their range, I do not in the least mind. But, if
I may be allowed to say so, I think to put such an uncorroborated story into print
when the man concerned is no longer here to defend himself is, to say the least,
unfair. I note that the article was written to fill space, but would it not be more
fitting to lessen the number of pages rather than to publish what some consider an
aspersion on a friend now dead.
Yours faithfully,
H. F. WlTHERBY.
826, High Holborn,
London, IV.C. 1;
July 9th, 1917.
The above letter has been submitted to me by our Editor, and I have asked
him not to withhold it from publication. I am afraid, however, that most of our
members will not be able to understand what it is all about, and I am to some
extent in the same difficulty myself.
I note that Mr. Witherby suggests that our magazine should be reduced to a
smaller compass, but surely the Avicultural Society may be allowed to decide for
itself how many pages shall be included in its magazine. Again, if I have written

and our Editor has published a valueless article, surely we are severally responsible
to the Soc : ety--not to Mr. Witherby. In this connection, however, I note that one
of our members claims, in the July number of the ' Magazine,&apos; to have read the
article "with interest."
The article in question was written in great haste on a journey, so it would
not have been surprising if it had contained some small inaccuracies, but, after
reading it again, I can definitely say that, to the best of my recollection, the
reminiscences it contains relating to the nightingale are accurate except in one
small particular. It might be inferred from one sentence that the late T. H.
Nelson came to Devon in quest of nightingale&apos;s eggs, but, as a matter of fact, he
came for a change of climate.
I see that Mr. Witherby describes my "story" as " uncorroborated," but
may I ask, on what grounds ? It is true that I only introduced two dramatis
pcrsonce in it, but there was a third person, and if Mr. Witherby will tell us exactly
what statements he considers require corroboration, I will ask that third person to
say that they are correct.
Mr. Witherby lays stress on the fact that he does not collect eggs, and would
not be likely to come to Devonshire to shoot nightingales. These may, of course,
be matters of interest to himself, but possibly they may not interest our readers,
and in any case they were not referred to in any way whatever in my recent
article.
The only allusion of any kind to Mr. Witherby was my remark that I
thought Nelson must have mentioned the locality of the nightingale's nesting site
to him. Here also I was not speaking at random. Nelson went on from Devon to
London, and I asked him to convey a message to Mr. Witherby relating to the
annual looting of the eggs of certain very rare species by a certain collector, in the
hope that something might be done to stop it. Nelson subsequently wrote to me
that he had given the message, and at the same time asked if I would contribute
any data to an article on the distribution of the nightingale, which was to appear
shortly in ' British Birds.' In the interests of our Devonshire nightingales I did not
accept the invitation. If Nelson did not mention the locality to Mr. Witherby he
probably did so to Dr. Ticehurst; in any case I feel nearly sure that the information
came from him, because the very words I used in describing the locality to him
were subsequently reproduced in 'British Birds.' There was, of course, no reason
why he should not have done so, because I have no recollection of having asked him
to regard the information as privileged, and I had been careful to describe the
locality only vaguely. As I mentioned, I now never give definite information to any
collector, having had some very bitter experiences, including the almost complete
destruction of a once flourishing colony of choughs.
One of the oddest statements in an odd letter is that " Mr. D'Urban could
not have been ignorant of the locality." When our readers recollect that one often
has no knowledge of the nesting of uncommon species in one&apos;s own immediate
vicinity, and then consider the size of Devonshire, they will be able to appraise this
suggestion at its proper value. The nightingale is dispersed over a large area of
Devon County, but it occurs only sporadically. If Mr. D&apos;Urban had known of this
colony of five pairs nesting in a very small area, obviously he would have mentioned
it in his book, ' The Birds of Devonshire,' but Chudleigh is only mentioned in the
latter as one among many sporadic instances of occurrence. If the information

came from Mr. D'Urban, the simple and obvious course was for Mr. Witherby to
obtain a statement from Mr. D Urban to that effect, and I suggest that he might
with advantage have done so before penning his letter.
For the past twenty years I have done my best for the cause of our vanishing
birds, and I shall continue to do so until the end of the chapter. I have always
endeavoured to avoid giving offence, but there seems to be a very sensitive spot in
most ornithologists--can it be their consciences ?
It is important for us all to remember that our life-work lives after us, and
that we must so build that the house we leave remains strong and firm. If we
have devoted our lives to the destruction of bird-life, posterity will not forget the
fact.
There are scientific ornithologists and Mr. Witherby is one of them, but I
have no hesitation in saying that the great majority of his followers are bird-slayers
simply and solely for their own amusement: if they are not wise enough to see the
writing on the wall now, they probably very soon will do so, for I have talked with
many persons on this subject, and am convinced that there is a growing feeling in
this country that this senseless, purposeless, and cruel slaughter of our rare birds
shall be put an end to.

UPLAND GEESE DYING OFF.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.973355958333333" page_id="9411965"  page_num="Page 291" year="" vol="">
Dear Sir,-- I wonder whether any of your readers can tell me why it is I am
unable to rear my young Upland geese. They die off every year from apparently
acute diarrhoea. Their bowels literally turn to water, which pour from them when
one handles their still warm, dead bodies. They will eat nothing but grass and
weeds, and I thought that it is possible that they may be eating something poisonous.
I ought to say that they have no shelter whatever, and one day when they were
about a week old we had three and a half inches of rain. This may have chilled
them. I shall be very much obliged for any information on this subject.
Truly yours,
Wm. Shore-Bailey.
[The following is, in part, an answer.]
I rear hybrid Upland + ruddy-headed geese every year, and also pure
ruddy-headed, keeping them in a coop on a grass run, and giving them duck meal
and. later on, a little grain. They run about and eat grass,dandelion leaves, and
plantain, etc., and also lawn-mowings. They need fresh supplies of clean water
for drinking. When they are about a month old I confine them in a wire run, as
they are apt to stray and be lost in long grass or taken by vermin. As a rule they
prosper. I never pinion them now, as they remain at home, only flying from one
meadow to another in the close proximity of the house.
H. D. Astley.
The Editor has shown me Mr. W. Shore-Bailey's letter, but I am afraid I
cannot definitely explain the reason for the goslings dying in this manner. As a
rule Upland geese rear their young without any difficulty provided they have an
ample supply of short, tender grass, and this, I believe, is about all they require,

although at the Zoological Gardens we provide them with a certain amount of soft
food, such as soaked biscuit meal.
I am inclined to think Mr. Shore-Bailey's suggestion that they have access
to some poisonous weed must be the correct explanation of the trouble.
I have known these goslings to die from being choked by eating long grass,
and I do not at all like cut grass for them, but where they have an opportunity of
grazing on short, young grass they should be reared with no difficulty, and their
own parents should be allowed to look after them.

Dear Sir, --I have just caught a fully fledged young cuckoo under the nets
over the currant bushes. I do not know if it was eating the fruit or the caterpillars,
of which we have a plague. Would you kindly let me know if it is possible to keep
this bird in captivity, and, if so, what sort of food I ought to give ? Do the young
cuckoos stay with us all the winter, and only feed on eggs in the spring ?

The following reply has been sent to Mrs. Staveley-Hill:
No doubt the cuckoo was after the caterpillars; it is by nature an insectivorous
bird. All young birds, after they have left the nest, are difficult to feed at first;
but possibly, with a greedy bird like the cuckoo, a few lively caterpillars or meal-
worms mixed in with moistened " Cekto " might induce it to accept the mixture,
and then the only trouble would be to satisfy its rapacious appetite. My experience
of a young cuckoo was that it was not an interesting pet; it ate to repletion, then
went to sleep, and started eating again directly it woke ijp. Of course a bird like
that is most difficult to keep clean in a large cage; it should have a fair-sized
aviary to itself, then perhaps it would be morejactive and eat less. The supposition
that cuckoos suck eggs doubtless arose from the fact that the bird lays her eggs on
the ground and carries them in her mouth to the nests of the proposed foster-
parents ; she may also have been seen to remove an egg from a nest in order to
make room for her own, but she is not an egg-eater.

By Dr. A. G. Butler.
The illustrations of these beautiful birds have been made
from living examples obtained by Mr. Walter Goodfellow and in the
splendid collection of our member, Mr. E. J. Brook. Although I
have never had the pleasure of seeing them in the flesh, and probably
have never more than glanced at their skins when looking over the
British Museum series some eleven or twelve years ago, our harassed
and much overworked editor has asked me to write an article about
them to accompany the plate; and he generously gives me permis-
sion to make it as lengthy as I like, which is very nice of him,
considering how much I know about these two species !
In his very interesting article, " A Naturalist's Notes in
Ecuador," published in our Magazine in 1900 (First Series, vol. vi.),
Mr. Goodfellow, speaking of the Tanagers he met with, observes:
" They are not frequenters of the dense forests ; I do not remember
that I found any of the Tanager family to be so, although many of
them like to hide about in bushes and some of them always keep
near the ground. They all delight in the more open country on the
mountain slopes, or in sunny clearings near the forests, and pass
their time in the fruit-trees near human dwellings."
Oddly enough, Stolzmann speaks of the species of Calliste, or

Dr. A. G. Butler,
at any rate most of them, as restricting themselves to the crowns of
trees, passing from one tree to another; but he admits that some
species prefer the outskirts of the forest and the less lofty scrub.
Calliste cyanopygia was first distinguished from C. cyaneicollis
by the late Dr. Sclater, who separated it under the MS. name in
his collection. It was subsequently described by Berlepsch and
Taczanowski, in the 'Proceedings' of the Zoological Society of London
for 1883, as a north-western related form of C. cyaneicollis ; and
these authors state that they have seen a fine series in the posses-
sion of M. Yerreaux of Paris, which proves that the characters are
constant and that the bird deserves to be kept separate.
Dr. Sclater (' Cat. Birds, B.M.,' vol. xi, p. 128) remarks that it
seems to be sufficiently distinct to be specifically separated, the
rump being blue like the head, instead of green. As both species
occur in Ecuador, and as I have shown ('Avic. Mag.,' New Series,
vol. vi, p. 31) how marvellously the metallic blue-green of females
and young males of C. fastuosa is replaced in more fully adult males
by golden green, that character alone would not have seemed very
convincing to me had I been called upon to distinguish the species.
Mr. W. Goodfellow (' Ibis,' 1901, p. 464) says of C. cyanopygia
that he obtained nine adult males, three young males, and three
females at altitudes of from 6000 to 8000 feet. " Found in high
trees on the more open parts of the mountain slopes. The females
are much duller than the males, and have the under tail-coverts dark
green edged with pale greenish-yellow, and, in one skin, with light
fawn ; they have also less gold on the shoulders. Young males
resemble the females, but have brighter golden shoulders."
Does the expression " much duller," applied to the females
arid young males, mean much bluer, as undoubtedly Dr. Sclater's
" less brilliant " does in the case of C. fastuosa ? If so, while I have
no doubt that the Museum authorities are satisfied of the distinct-
nesss of C. cyanopygia from C. cyaneicollis , I think a more satisfac-
tory comparative description of the two forms ought to be published.
Stolzmann, in Taczanowski's 1 Ornithology of Peru,' vol. ii,
p. 473, describes the eggs of C. cyaneicollis, and as they would
probably differ little, if at all, from those of C. cyanopygia, I here-
with append a free translation :

" The eggs are ovate, moderately elongate, with smooth shell,
white or slightly yellowish-white, sprinkled with rather numerous
violaceous spots, either almost evenly distributed all over ; or, more
often, few and small on the larger terminal half, but crowded and
forming a wide belt close round the broad end, which is sprinkled
with tiny spots, but less numerous than at the apex. Length, 19-20;
width, 13, 3-14, 1 millimetres."
From the fact that Stolzmann neither describes the nest nor
its site, it would seem likely that he did not himself take these eggs.
Unhappily, there do not seem to have been many collectors
of the birds of Ecuador who, like Walter Goodfellow, have taken the
trouble to record the habits of the birds which they have obtained.
I imagine that this deplorable fact is due to the belief that Museum
students, some of whom have stigmatized the study of bird life as
unscientific, are not interested in obtaining information on the
subject; yet I have noticed that these same men never fail to
publish with pleasure all facts dealing with the life-history of birds
which their collectors send home, so that it is evident that they
take some interest in the birds themselves, and not in their
skins alone.
Are the species of Compsocoma rarer than those of the species
of Calliste, or are they more solitary in their habits ? From what
Stolzmann says, it would appear that the forms of Calliste move
about in small flocks, so that a collector of skins would be able to
secure several of any species he might come across, whereas if he
came across a single example of Compsocoma he might fail to bring
it down ; yet there might be many examples skulking in the
neighbourhood.
Mr. Walter Goodfellow says (' Avic. Mag.,' t.c., p. 90): " We
secured one specimen only of the rare Compsocoma notabilis. This
is a very close ally to the Blue-shouldered Tanager. The arrange-
ment of the colours is exactly the same, but of an altogether richer
and intenser hue, and it is also a little longer. Its stomach con-
tained nothing but berries of a hard (and what one would have
thought unnourishing) kind."
According to Dr. Sclater, who places these two species at
*opposite ends of the genus, they differ in colouring as follows :

Compsocoma notabilis.
Above yellowish-olive ; lesser wing-coverts olive ; large nuchal
spot yellow ; body below orange-yellow. Western Ecuador.
These differences seem quite satisfactory, but Dr. Sclater
emphasizes the black chin of C. notabilis as its distinctive character !
I should have thought the description " head black " included the
chin. I believe it generally does.
All that Mr. Goodfellow tells us in ' The Ibis ' for 1901 about
C. notabilis is : " One male, apparently of this species, was obtained
on the lower part of the western side of Pichincha, at an altitude of
about 7000 feet."
I am afraid that next to nothing is known about the wild life
of the species of Compsocoma ; so that, with the best intentions, I
fear that I cannot make this a lengthy article, as our Editor desires.*
THE STORY OF A BLACK KITE.
By Ethel F. Chawner.
Many years ago I spent some weeks at S. Jean de Luz in the
Pyrenees, and towards the end of my stay I was told that someone
in the town was very anxious to find a home for a pair of hand-reared,
large hawks, and in a weak moment consented to see them. The
butcher-boy, who was the go-between, came next morning with the
meat for the pension, driving two big, brown birds along the pave-
ment before him, and summoned me from dejeuner to inspect them
and decide if they should come with me to England the following
week.
* [The turquoise blue of the head of the Purple-bellied Tanager is most beautiful,
and unfortunately appears too greenish in the coloured plate. The under-
parts of the Black-chinned Mountain Tanager are also much more brilliant
in the living bird.-- Ed.]

I must own that my first impulse was to refuse them, though
fifty centimes apiece could not be called a high price, for they looked
the most unprepossessing and deplorable objects imaginable. About
the bigness of barn-door fowls and still in immature plumage, dirty,
bedraggled, with tail and flight feathers broken to mere stumps, what
would be said at home when I sprung them on my family ? My
acquaintance with hawks was of the slightest; milan royal sounded
merely ludicrous when applied to these scarecrows, and conveyed
nothing to me.
But the butcher-boy was urgent and persistent; doubtless his
&apos;pourboire was at stake, and his orders were to get rid of the birds
somehow. He vowed that if I did not take pity on them their
death-warrant was signed, that they were gentitles, and would be jolies
betes when more soignees (they were far from being one or the other
at that moment!), and at last I yielded, with many misgivings.
Accordingly, they and I started on our journey a week later.
They were packed in a hamper, and I had also eight green tree
frogs, two Pyrenean wasps with their nests, various caterpillars, and
a praying mantis. The people on the platform glared and scowled
at me, for it was the time of the Boer War when the English were
unpopular in France; but this had its advantages, as I was left in
sole possession of a compartment until just before the train started,
when a lady with a small lap-dog took one of the vacant seats.
That was a memorable night! The weather was very hot,
and soon the tree-frogs began to croak ; this set the dog off, and he
barked incessantly, while the hawks screamed and fought in their
hamper. My fellow-passenger and I perforce made a compact that
if I did not complain of her dog she would turn a deaf ear to my
creatures, but it was not surprising that we kept the compartment
to ourselves all the way to Paris. By this time I had made up my
mind that two hawks were more than I could endure, so to the Jardin
des Plantes I went as soon as I thought it would be open, and
handed over one screamer to the keeper of the birds, who seemed
quite pleased to have it. The remaining bird calmed down, and the
rest of the journey was performed in silence.
I will pass over the reception my people gave us, merely
remarking that their comments were exactly what I had anticipated.

The story of a Black Kite.
My first care was to encourage my kite to free himself from
the swarming vermin which infested him, and I was delighted to see
how diligently he bathed and preened himself. The Falconer of the
Old Hawking Club came to my help, showed me how to fasten jesses,
provided a block, and encouraged me to believe that my " ugly
duckling " would presently turn into a " swan." I am afraid that he
was the only person who thought so.
The moult--that blessed provision of Nature for righting
wrongs done to plumage--was not long in coming, and little by
little produced a change for the better. He assumed adult plumage,
and one day, after being away from home for a fortnight, coming
suddenly round a corner I saw him spread two splendid wings and a
broad, slightly forked tail, and realised that I was looking at a
beautiful creature. " Taffy," so called from his characteristic habit
of "borrowing" handkerchiefs, dusters, and the like ("where the
kite breeds, look out for lesser linen "), became a charming pet.
Tame and fearless, he could safely be handled, and his poses and
attitudes w 7 ere a joy to see. A very favourite one was "the Church
lectern," when he stood on his block with wings half spread, gener-
ally after his bath ; or he would lie flat on the grass, his wings fully
spread, sunning himself until he panted with open beak. He roosted
on a low branch of a large ilex, and after jumping off on the wrong
side and being left dangling a few times, he learnt how to avoid
that most unpleasant experience. He even made a game of it, w T ould
let himself go and swing head dowmvard seemingly helpless, some-
how 7 right himself with a back somersault, and fly back to the bough.
His wild, " shivering " cry w r as most musical, and as he grew in age
he grew in beauty, and acquired that exquisite bloom which is only
seen w 7 hen birds are in the pink of health and condition.
Now and again he escaped through mischance or carelessness
in fastening the leash, but he never went far, and everybody knew
him, and either brought him home or told his friends where to find
him. Probably he could have been trained to fly to hack, but the
forest is too thickly wooded to make the experiment worth trying
with a valued bird, and " Taffy's " excursions were not encouraged.
The only time he was really upset was when someone took
him to see my Eagle Owls. One look was enough for " Taffy," and

he fled screaming. He disdained cats, and dogs usually gave him a
wide berth, though I doubt if he would have stood up to one, Kites
not being remarkable for courage.
Alas that I should have to write of him in the past tense!
He lived six or seven years with us, happy and contented and grow-
ing in beauty with every moult. One morning he could not be
found, and though a hue-and-cry was raised and diligent search
made, it was not until a week later that his mangled remains were
found under a thick rhododendron bush. A mangy fox was the
murderer, and it was some small comfort to learn that he met his fate
the same day from an irate poultry-keeper, among whose birds he was
found. "Taffy" has never been replaced, but his memory is still
green and held dear by many friends who sincerely mourn the
beautiful, gentle creature and miss his engaging ways.
DR. RUSS ON SUNDRY WARBLERS AND
OTHER BIRDS.
By Dr. E. Hopkinson, D.S.O.
The following is a translation of a small portion of the
' Lehrbuch der Stuben Vogelpflege, etc.,' which forms the fourth
volume (published in 1888) of Dr. Karl Russ' great work on Foreign
Birds, ' Die Fremdlandischen Stubenvogel,' which remains to date
the Encyclopaedia of all things avicultural.
The other three volumes deal exhaustively with different
groups of birds, vol. i (1879) containing the " Hard-bills ; ii (1881),
the Parrots; and iii, the last published (1899), the "Soft-bills";
while in the fourth the author covers the entire field of bird-keeping.
The extract here given is a translation of a few (commencing
on p. 470) of the 900 odd closely-printed pages the volume contains.
As far as I know they have never previously appeared in English, and
as they give an interesting, though perhaps rather idealised, picture
of the groups concerned, I do not think that the fact that they are
of enemy origin, need even to-day, debar us from any pleasure or
information they can give us.

Dr. E. Hopkinson,
The translation closely follows the original as a whole, though
a few verbal alterations have been necessary and a few gaps left,
where occur references to other pages of the book or to species which
I cannot definitely identify, and I have also, in order to suit the
account to English readers, altered the names, giving instead of the
German and Latin names of the original, the ordinary English and
modern scientific names of the species concerned.
"The Willow Wren, whose pretty, gentle, and long-drawn-
out song, with falling cadence towards the end, we so often hear in
the open in summer, is frequently kept in captivity, and is not so
very difficult to meat off or keep in health, . . . especially
if allowed to fly loose in the room, but otherwise it has no
great value, as it cannot be given rank among the mocking or
imitative birds. The Wood Wren gives us a simple song, opening
with a strain which reminds us of that of the Willow Wren, and then
ringing out in louder tinkling notes with a low humming accompani-
ment. . . . The Chiffchaff is our smallest European bird'
except the Goldcrest and Wren, but in spite of this is not difficult to
meat off and fairly easy to keep, especially loose in a room ; its song
is a simple but pleasing one, particularly when heard ringing forth
in some gloomy wood. Bonelli's Warbler (P. bonellii), essen-
tially a bird of the mountains, is of but little interest to the bird-
fancier; its song is similar to the Wood Wren, but shorter and of
low T er pitch. Becently the Bohemian bird-dealers have again and
again been offering for sale as great rarities specimens of the
Yellow-browed Warbler (P. stcperciliosus), tiny little birds, not
much larger than our Goldcrests, which they also somewhat resemble
in colour and markings. Their home is in Asia, but they have many
times wandered as far a3 Germany. This little feathered visitor tc
us is only mentioned here incidentally, as it can have but little
interest from the bird-keepers' point of view, being on the one hand
but accidentally and very rarely come by, and on the other difficult
to keep. The Melodious Warbler (Hypolais polyglotta ) is a native
of Southern Europe and North-West Africa, which from time to
time comes into the bird market from Dalmatia. It is, however, so
uncommon that one knows but little of its song and other charac-
teristics. Two other species from the South, the Olivaceous

Warbler {Hypolais pallida) and the Olivetree Warbler ( H. olive-
torum), have, as far as I know, never yet been imported alive; and
I suppose we may assume that none of their other allies from
Southern Europe or foreign countries would be of any great value as
cage-birds, even if by any chance specimens should ever be imported.
" The Sedge and Reed Warblers are plainly coloured, and to
most people but little known birds, which vary in size from that of
a Willow Wren to nearly as large as a Thrush. Their song, a simple
one, can be described as in most cases a pleasing prattling, most
industriously delivered, and for this cheery, if inartistic, performance
and for their lively and attractive little ways, they will always be
beloved, while one species ranks high both as a singer and mocker.
. . . The largest of them all is the Great Reed Warbler ( Aero-
cephalus turdoides), also known as the " Reed-Thrush," and again by
the particularly inapt name of " Reed-Sparrow." It is a ceaseless
and untiring singer, but is not often seen in captivity, as it can only
occasionally be obtained and is difficult to keep. Others are the
much smaller Reed Warbler (A. streperus), whose continuous
prattling--one can hardly call it singing--one may hear all day
long ; the similarly coloured Sedge Warbler, whose song consists
of a succession of rising and falling whistling notes ; the Aquatic
Warbler (*4. aquaticus), smallest of all, with a medley of chirps,
rattling sounds and agreeable trills for a song ; the scarce Grass-
hopper Warbler ( Locustella ncevia), whose monotonous long-
sustained strain is so uncommonly like the whirr of the large green
grasshoppers; and the River Warbler ( L. fluviatilis ), which has
scarcely any song at all, nothing except similar grasshopper-like
sounds. None of these can he properly classed as cage-birds, and
they therefore can only appeal to a limited class of fanciers. The
bird I mentioned above as such a fine singer is the Marsh-
Warbler (A. palustris ); he is a most desirable cage-bird, as in
captivity, when he has got through the winter, he commonly sings
from March onwards, but alas ! he is most difficult to meat off and
get safely through the moult. . . . His song consists of delight-
fully clear, flute-like notes, similar to those of some of the Willow
Warblers, particularly the Icterine, but more melodious and softer
and intermingled with strains, which he has annexed from other

singers, for he is a wonderful mocker. Some foreign species,
namely, Blyth's Beed Warbler (A. dumetorum), of North-East
Russia and Asia, Savi's Warbler, from Southern Europe and also
Holland, and others occasionally appear in the bird-market, but are
of but little actual interest to the ordinary bird-keeper. There are
also many other species hitherto entirely unknown as cage-birds,
which I can pass over, more particularly as there is little likelihood
of any of them being, like the Marsh Warbler, valuable for their
song.
The Flycatchers can only be of interest as cage-birds to a few
exceptional fanciers, as they are mostly plainly coloured, or, at any
rate, not particularly beautiful, although in freedom they are cer-
tainly among the most useful of our birds. If one wishes to keep a
Flycatcher flying loose in a room to destroy the flies or merely to
enjoy its charming ways, its manners will be found excellent, as it
will select a stake stuck in a flower-pot or some plant as a perch,
whence it will take flights all over the room, but make no mess at all
except at this spot. They are, however, in general, frail and delicate,
and so come but rarely into the market, while most species are prac-
tically impossible to obtain at all. I know no instance of their
breeding in confinement, though, of course, it is a common thing for
people to entertain and attract these visitors by hanging up nest-
boxes for them. Our Common or Spotted Flycatcher is a little
bird of unassuming plumage, with no song beyond a few feeble
chirps. The Pied Flycatcher is, however, quite a pretty bird, and
quite as lively as the last, which is easily tamed and becomes quite
confiding, and which sings diligently a song very like that of the
Redstart. The White-collared Flycatcher (ill. collans), w'hich is
more especially a native of the south-east, is a prettily marked bird
with a loud, changeful tune like the Bluethroat's. As an extra-
ordinary rarity, we are very occasionally offered by the Bohemian
bird-dealers the dear little Red-breasted Flycatcher (M. parva),
so like the Robin but smaller, whose song consists of a gentle
twittering suggestive of the sound of little bells.
Although the Wagtails in a state of nature will always be
admired and beloved by all for their grace and charm, as cage-birds
they have comparatively little value, as they can scarcely be called

singers, and most of them are difficult to keep for any length of
time. It is true that they are not difficult to meat off, but after-
wards, being such active and excitable little things, they soon pine
away even in a really large cage. Many fanciers, for this reason, let
them run about the living-room with clipped wings, but here they
practically always come to a miserable end; the best plan un-
doubtedly would be to allow them to fly loose in a bird-room, where
they will be found to do fairly well. The Pied or Common Wagtail
is a diligent singer, hut its notes are feeble, irregular, and intermixed
with its shrill, oft-repeated call; although so common, it is only
occasionally offered for sale, being not greatly esteemed as a cage-
bird. The more beautiful Blue-Headed Wagtail (ill. flava), one of
the yellow species, would be much more interesting, but it is delicate
and very difficult to meat off, requiring the most constant attention
to keep it in health ; its song is a little louder and more melodious
than that of the foregoing. Of similar habits, etc., to the two already
mentioned is the Yellow Wagtail, which is nearly as pretty as the
last-named, and whose song resembles the Common Wagtail's.
Elsewhere the Large Pied Wagtail (M. maderas patensis ) of India
and Ceylon is referred to as not being likely to have much value as a
cage-bird, even if it were by any chance imported, and of the many
other foreign species known, none have hitherto ever been imported
alive.
The Chats are of comparatively little value as cage-birds,
though there is at least one excellent singer among them. They are
among the most difficult birds to meat off, so that they are but rarely
offered for sale; and even when accustomed to their food, require
constant and most careful attention to keep them in health. An old-
caught Wheatear, for instance, nearly always dies. To give such a
bird the best chance, he should be lodged in a large, roomy thrush-
cage furnished with moss and stones. When free, he is a lovely
little bird, hut in confinement usually presents but a pitiable spec-
tacle. His song is tolerable, though it consists of only a short little
strain and a single, disagreeable croak. . . . The Stone-Chat
has but an unpretending song, similar to that of the Wheatear.
Of all the numerous foreign species allied to our Chats, there is not
one of any interest from our point of view, nor is there the least

likelihood of the fancier obtaining an example of any of them. One
of the nearest allies of the Chats, according to most ornithologists,
is the Dipper, which when wild is such a lovely sight in his haunts
in some mountain valley, where, especially in the early mornings,
the varied chirping and whistling notes of his delightful song, first
low then loud, ring out nearly the whole year round. In captivity,
on the other hand, unless kept loose in the bird-room, or, better still,
in a room by itself, it usually has but a miserable appearance, and,
moreover, every Dipper, on account of its unsociability, has to be
kept alone ; it is therefore distinctly a bird which is best allowed to
retain its freedom, the more so, as it is extremely difficult to meat off,
and can only be kept alive with the most constant care. Decently
there have, on several occasions, been exhibited Dippers which have
been taken from the nest and hand-reared ; but these show none of
the cheery, lively ways of the wild birds, and have no song, or, at
any rate, nothing more than a bungling attempt at one. Another
species inhabits the Swiss Alps, the mountains of Southern Europe
and Lebanon, and others are found in the mountainous parts of Asia
and America; but these we may pass over, as they can be of but
little interest as cage-birds."
CORDON BLEU--ST. HELENA WAXBILL
HYBRIDS.
By A. C. Drelincourt Campbell.
Knowing how hard it is for our Editor to keep the magazine
going now for want of " material," I am writing a short account of
my success in rearing the above hybrids this year after several
failures last season, and trust it will prove of interest to some
of the members at least.
Last season I had in my small aviary, which is, roughly
speaking, about 10 x 8 x 4 ft. in size, several pairs of birds and an
odd hen Cordon Bleu (this bird, by the way, was bred in the same
aviary two years before); in my large aviary I had an odd cock
St. Helena Waxbill, so, just as an experiment, I took him out and
put him in the small aviary with the Cordon. A few weeks after

they paired off, and, altogether, had two nests of eggs, all of which
hatched; but they would feed the young on nothing but seed, and so
killed each brood.
This season I turned these two birds into the same small
aviary, but put with them only a pair of Zebra Finches and a pair of
Diamond Doves, and they started to nest at once. My calculation
that the eggs should hatch on June 5th was not far out, as I found
them with young on the 6th. I was unable to obtain any live ants'
eggs (cocoons) then, only the grubs, which the birds would not touch,
and could obtain no meal-worms until Mr. Sanders, of Peckham,
came to my rescue, and I am sure that my success is, in a great
measure, due to his promptness in sending me some worms at
express speed.
On obtaining these meal-worms, I supplied soft food of the
usual kind mixed with a plentiful supply of chopped " worms," given
fresh twice and frequently three times a day when the weather was
very hot; seeding grass was constantly supplied also, but not eaten
very much, but used up for enlarging the nest, which was built in a
cocoanut shell high up in the peak of the roof.
On June 8th the hen started screeching badly and seemed
very restless, so I felt certain that some or all of the young were
dead, as she did this the year before when they died ; so I searched
and found a dead bird on the edge of the nest, which the St. Helena
was trying to brick up with small stones and mortar. Is this sense
a provision of Nature or what, I wonder? for this same bird has
always done this. I found it the same each time with a young dead
bird last year. Some birds forsake when the effluvium gets too bad,
others simply throw out the dead youngsters at once, but this Wax-
bill seems to have his own ideas of a fitting burial. Have any other
members noticed this peculiarity with St. Helenas or any other
species ?
I examined the defunct, and the reason of death was appar-
ently the old tale again--stuffed with hard, undigested seeds till his
poor little life was simply choked out of him. The nest then con-
tained three healthy-looking youngsters, and two eggs which looked
fertile.
The next day all seemed quiet, and being a really hot day I

Mr. A. C. Drelincourt Campbell.
decided to try again for ants' cocoons, and this time was very fortu-
nate in obtaining quite a good supply of both large and small kinds.
I hurried back so as to get some into the aviary before roosting-
time, and within a few minutes of putting the dish inside the aviary
both parents were greedily devouring the eggs, particularly the
smaller ones.
The same tale now continues for several days, diet being varied
with spiders, blight fly (not much relished), chopped meal-worms,
ants' eggs, seeding grass, and, in fact, any likely insect or smooth
grub that came along, also soaked Indian millet.
On the evening of the 12th both parents were off together for
the first time since sitting commenced, and were feeding quietly on
Indian millet, with a few ants' eggs picked up every now and again,
and it was now for the first time that I began to hope for success.
All seemed to be going on well, so on the 16th I decided to
have another look at the nest, as both parents were often off together
for long periods, and found it contained four fine youngsters and one
egg. The latter I removed with a teaspoon. When the youngsters
opened their mouths to be fed, which they did whilst I had the
shell in my hand, they showed flesh of the most brilliant light blue
on the sides of the mouth.
On the 21st I examined the nest again and found the young
getting well feathered; the parents never sit on the nest now.
On the 25th I had the great pleasure of seeing a strange bird
in my aviary and great commotion among the rest of the inmates,
and the next day there appeared three young birds, whose plumage
was chiefly composed of reddish-brown; cheeks, throat, and under
breast tinged with blue; beak black; flesh at root of beak brilliant
blue; legs flesh colour; eye looked black, but birds too shy for me to
get a long enough peep, to be sure, and one bird had a large spot of
bright red just over the eye, as if the St. Helena's red eye-streak
would develop later. All three birds very strong on the wing, and
well feathered all over.
On the 27th the fourth bird appeared, looked like a hen, all red-
brown, no other tinge of colour anywhere, also quite strong on the
wing, in fact these four birds are the strongest and best feathered
young birds I have ever reared.

on Cordon Bleu -- St. Helena Waxbill hybrids. 307
My meal-worms had now given out, but as ants' cocoons were
plentiful I obtained no more.
By July 1st these birds had come along splendidly, one bird
in particular, probably the one which appeared out first, having
developed the tail motions of his father, started a strong song of his
own, quite unlike either of the parents, and took upon himself the
responsibility of general sentinel to the aviary, giving warning in a
vigorous call very like his father's upon any appearance of danger
or sudden noise.
When these four youngsters are asking to be fed it is just like
the sound of a lot of our young Titmice asking the same thing, the
sound is almost identical; when I found it was my birds making the
noise I was very astonished, as I had heard it several days before,
but thought it was young Titmice in the orchard trees around, where
there are several nests every year : it is slightly ventriloquial and hard
to locate.
On July 5th I separated these birds from their parents as they
were all feeding themselves well and the old birds seemed to want to
commence nesting again.
The hybrids are now all safe and feeding like old birds, all of
them have the flirty action of the tail like the St. Helena's ; their
feathering is the loveliest I have yet seen on young birds, so lace-like
and such quantities of it they look simply like balls of fluff, with the
exception of the tail being too long and not carried at the same
angle, they much resemble our common Wren.
Their flight is rapid and graceful, tail jerking from side to side
all the time, and they are bright-eyed and most inquisitive and quite
tame if no sudden movement is made, coming right up to the wires
to see you and altogether delightful in their demureness.
Should any fellow-member after reading this feel they would
like to purchase some of these birds, I should like to add that I have
sold two and will not part with the other two, but should I be
successful again and rear another nest this season I might be able to
spare one or two.
In addition to these hybrids I have been very successful
with Diamond Doves, Zebra Finches, and Long-tailed Grass Finches,
but my Ruficandas have failed altogether so far.

I am hoping that this dry yarn of mine will be of some
assistance to a fellow-member who may have a few odd birds and a
small aviary to spare and so help him or her to the success which
has at last attended my efforts.
P.S.--These birds have now a second brood of three flying,
and are nesting again for the third time.

Under this heading I would like to mention a few instances
that have come under my notice, showing how certain forms of bird-
life can be driven away from, or exterminated in, certain districts
during times of severe drought, and also showing how birds can
become a medium of conveying seeds of plants, or grasses, possibly
of an injurious nature, from one district to another, in other ways
than by the usually acc^ :cd one of eating and evacuating.
Referring particularly to the district round about Coomooboo-
laroo, Central Queensland, I can mention the case of the Beautiful
Parrot (Psephotus pule her rimus). Previous to the terrible drought of
1902 it was not very uncommon to see a pair of these birds when
out mustering on the run, and on two occasions nests were found,
but since that year not a single specimen has been seen.
About the year 1882, when on a collecting trip to Fairfield, a
station about seventy miles south of Coomooboolaroo, many of these
birds were seen, and several sets of eggs taken.
Since 1902 I have frequently asked the people living at Fair-
field to keep a look-out for the birds, but they report that none have
been seen. I have also been in the vicinity myself, but saw no
birds. The reason of their disappearance is not hard to discover.
For three years previous to the climax of the drought in 1902 there
had been no wet season, and very little grass grew, consequently
there was little seed ; then the worst year came on, in which no
grass grew, so that the birds could not find a living, and either
perished or migrated. As there was more grass on the coastal
country, the latter is possible, but if so, it is strange that they have
not found their way back to their original haunts.
Then we have the case of the Scarlet-backed Malurus
(M. melanocephalus ). These little birds were always numerous in
the long grass, but after that drought not one was seen on the run
for at least three years, but since then an odd little flock has been
seen. It is possible that as the grass became scarce inland they
worked their way towards the coast, where the grass was longer.

Mr. A. R. Williams,
The year after the drought I had occasion to be on the coast country,
and noticed numbers of Malurus in the long grass.
During the year of drought many of the far-western birds
came into our district, notably the Ground Graucalus (Pteropodocys
phasianella ), Western Miner (Myzantha flavigula ), and Cockatoo-
Parrot.
The Bustard, or Plain Turkey, is rarely seen in our district,
but when a bad season occurs in the West, they work in towards the
coast, and last winter I shot a female weighing 17 lb. When
plucking the feathers off I was surprised to find spear grass seed
sticking thickly into the skin, principally round the base of the
neck, but more or less all over the body, many of the " spears "
being completely embedded in the flesh. Now, hundreds of these
birds would find their way back to the Western plains, and eventually
drop the dreaded spear grass in the sheep country.
In 1903 I was up towards the Gulf country, and was told
that the Bustards were driven in towards the Gulf by the drought the
previous year, and that hundreds died from drinking the salt water
in the salt-pans.
The poor Laughing Jackass (Dacelo gigas) had a bad time in
that year, and numbers died. Several times three or four were seen
lying under the night-roost, and for some years after the drought it
was rare to hear a " corrobboree " in the early morning. Now, how-
ever. they have become plentiful again, and the " bushman's clock "
chimes regularly every morning. Magpies became so weak that
they could not fly, and no doubt many died. Also many of the
smaller birds died.
PHEASANTS.

I.
At six o'clock on a fine August morning I opened my
bedroom window and looked out. The sun was not yet clear of the
trees on top of the Downs, but was rapidly changing the sky from
blue to white, increasingly gold and red eastward. There was a
sharp touch in the air, summer though it was. A cock pheasant

stepped across the road from our front hedge, right before the
window, with his back towards me. The road was too much in
shadow to reveal the brilliance of his burnished head and rich tawny
body colouring, though the white ring round his neck was plainly
visible. He walked slowly, with a gait like a miniature peacock,
but more daintily. As if conscious of pre-eminence among birds,
he turned his head proudly to left and right with a graceful arch of
the neck. At the hedge he inclined his head, there was a wave of
the long-barred brown tail feathers, and the pheasant disappeared
into the shadows and growths of the hedge-bottom. I withdrew
from the window to finish dressing.
Hearing footsteps a few minutes later I went to the window
again. Coming along the road was the farmer's son, Master Robert,
carrying a gun on his arm, his alert wire-haired terrier trotting a
couple of yards in front, both keenly searching for game. Across
the top of the sixty-acre field a dark speck ran quickly into the
hedge. Mr. Robert stood for a moment, looked round, then struck
straight across the field to the top corner. I listened, but heard
no report of a gun. Half an hour later Robert came back empty-
handed.
II.
Late in the afternoon of a bright October day I came through
the rye-field with a cart. Swinging open the gate leading into
the dairy meadow, I stood for a moment looking across its broad
expanse of sward. The level rays of the setting sun cast long
shadows reaching halfway across the mead. On the far hedge, under
the great elms, scarlet haws shone in the sunlight, the maples were
golden, and the hedgerows purple and brown. Away to my left a
cock-pheasant ran quickly towards the corner. His bluish-glossy
head looked black, his body was the darkest brown, and the white
ring round his neck was all but indistinguishable, but the plump,
yet handsome, wedge-shaped body was unmistakable. I hurried
back through the gateway in time to see the bird disappear between
two wheat-ricks.

The seventy-acre field, recently under barley, now full of
clover, adjoined the Downs for the greater part of its distance across

Mr. A. R. Williams,
the top, the stretch being completed by a plantation of larch and
ash and hazel saplings. Going up under the hedge with a load
of hurdles to get to the adjacent sheep-field, we surprised three
pheasants, a cock and two hens. We did not see them for long.
They were in the top corner. When they heard the waggon the
two hens scuttled away through a gap in the hedge. The cock stood
for a moment with his back towards us, his head turned to the right,
the embodiment of watchful caution, then he followed his wives.
On our return journey we saw several pheasants feeding close to
the top hedge, but a long way from us, only near enough to he
recognised as pheasants.
At the second journey up we saw a cock pheasant and three
hens wandering along in front of us near to the hedge. They had
not yet noticed us, and I jumped through a gap in the hedge, intend-
ing to get ahead of them, and then come through the gateway
to meet them. I walked quickly and as quietly as I could, and
reckoned that I should be level with them at the group of ash poles.
I got to the ash saplings, and was about to make a cUtour out into
the field for the purpose of not startling the birds, when a sandy-
brown patch of feathers crept through the hedge immediately ahead.
She turned her head, caught sight of me, darted back, and disap-
peared through the gap whence she had come. A moment later I
heard the beat of strong wings forcing heavy bodies upwards, and
four pheasants soared high over the hedge and away to the planta-
tion. It is an interesting speculation whether the hen pheasant
gave warning to the others or not, or they may have heard me, or
more likely, have been alarmed by the oncoming waggon and team.
During a subsequent journey in the afternoon we were more
fortunate. A cock and hen pheasant were feeding in the clover a
short distance to our left. They ignored our presence, and went on
searching in the long clover. By the light of the afternoon sun
we could see the cock bird in all his glory, resplendent in sheen of
bluish-green glossy head and neck, bounded by a pure white ring
below, chestnut-brown plumage, almost bright enough under the
wings to be called red, and the graceful, tremulous tail barred black
on a reddish ground. Such vivid colouring gives the bird an exotic
appearance, yet fits in well with an autumnal landscape.

IV.
The end of November, and winter has laid its first touches
on the countryside. A keen hoarfrost during the night was followed
by a bright morning, turning later to snow as the north-east wind
brought up the grey clouds. As we drove along the high road it
was snowing heavily from a leaden sky. In the village doors and
windows were closed, scarcely anyone was about, and the few whose
work compelled them to be outdoors were muffled up to the eyes-
the farm-hands in plentiful sacks. Hedges were bare, trees stood
out gaunt black skeletons against the sky. Blackbirds and sparrows
with puffed-out feathers hopped disconsolately about the roadway.
The generally numerous rooks were represented by a few individuals
flying swiftly through the air, not turning, pausing, nor calling.
Only the plovers uttered their melancholy cries from the wet
pastures, as they always do. The landscape faded away into
invisibility behind a curtain of snow and mist, and the dark weed-
bedded river flowed past with silent speed. We drew our coats
round us and urged the horse on faster. Rounding the bend beyond
the village we saw ahead a water-meadow containing the dead and
blackened remains of a plentiful crop of thistles and docks. On our
left, across the river, were some huge elms at the bottom of a sloping
meadow. Suddenly abreast of us sounded the beat of strong pinions,
a dark shape rose high between two closely growing trees, and a
cock pheasant flew nearly overhead at tremendous speed, neck out-
stretched, long tapering tail trailing straight and smooth behind him,
wings meeting above and below his body in his eager and strenuous
effort. The wing-beats were incredibly quick for such a big bird, as
was his flight. In the diffused light and his elevated position the
colouring was reduced to one dead level, almost black. He sped
away and disappeared across the meadows towards a copse.
V.
It was not completely dark as I came across the meadow
and made for the gap under the big elm-tree, but the light was so
diminished that objects looked dark and huge and shapeless out of
space. Against the skyline on the headland a cow looked as large
as an elephant, and the tops of distant trees were great cones and

Mr. A. R. Williams,
pyramids. In the rapidly gathering darkness everything was eerie-
and illusive. Plovers swept in long curves overhead and skimmed
across the surface of the marshy land, crying plaintively. A black-
bird flew out of the hedge as I approached, and went off calling
" ching, ching," as if annoyed. Going through the gap, I trod on
a rotten stick, which cracked loudly underfoot. A quick rustling,
brushing noise sounded in the branches, there was a clap of wings
and the rush and beat of a cock pheasant's powerful vanes forcing
the bird along at top speed. The sound of a pheasant's wing-action
is unmistakable, even though the bird is invisible. It rapidly died
away through a lessening vibration to silence, broken only by the
whisper of the stream and the cries of the peewits.
VI.
The powerful wing-action of the pheasant is marvellous
Approaching the plantation, we hear the resonant crow of the cock
bird, and perhaps see brown bodies vanish into the undergrowth.
Going along the cart-track, whose ruts are filled with blackening
beech-leaves, we surprise an occasional rabbit, which sits a moment,
then slips away A squirrel darts with quick jerks from branch to
branch, and various small birds flit across the way. Brown withered
leaves still hang on beech and oak saplings, berries gleam here aud
there, larches are golden-brown, evergreens shine with a richer
green, coarse grasses and ground-ivy flourish, and fungi are plentiful.
Ahead rises a little close-growing group of beeches. At their foot
busy among the carpet of leaves, is a cock pheasant, his ruddy black-
barred tail vibrating jerkily with his slight movements. We stand
still, but too late ; the rustle of leaves is detected by the bird. He
raises his handsome head, turns his neck, his eyes gleam like a jewel.
Next moment he utters a loud warning call, gives a sudden jerk, and
rises vertically--"rockets"--through the bare branches. The output
of energy to rise thus such a distance must be enormous. The
hitherto almost silent wood echoes to the dash and flap of wings
meeting above and below his body at a speed too fast for eyes to
follow. As a display of flying ability, the rocketing of the pheasant
is equalled only by the long-distance gliding of gulls, the autumnal
evolutions of rooks, or the day-long busyness of swallows. But the

wonderful, and the wing-feats of migrants must not be forgotten.
The cock pheasant's upward rush is over in a few seconds &amp;gt;
he is out of sight above the tree-tops, and the wood resumes its
normal quietness, broken at intervals by slight sounds which are
magnified among the trees.
VII.
A chill biting wind blows from the east, penetrating the
thickest clothing, and making one shiver even when wearing winter
garments, overcoat, and gloves. The sky is a uniform leaden grey.
From it falls a drizzling rain with flakes of snow. It is cold enough
for frost, but the atmosphere is too damp to allow of freezing,
Across fifty acres of swedes the sleet drives with soaking persistence,
and the big leaves throw water on legs and feet. From the planta-
tion beyond the swede-field a small column of smoke arises, indi-
dicating that the woodman too feels the cold, and is trying to warm
himself and boil a kettleful of water for breakfast.
Disturbed by the bang of the gate and the noise of the horse
and cart, a huge flock of rooks and jackdaws, with the inevitable
retinue of starlings, rose from the middle of the field, wheeled to the
left, described a long curve towards the copse, then away with loud
caws and cries to the right, scattering into the next field. A moment
later a dark object darted out of the wood and flew straight as
an arrow towards me, calling loudly on one note as if alarmed or
annoyed. The wings vibrated with great force and rapidity, the
bird was within twenty yards of me, then swerved to my left.
Stopping the quick pulsing wing-beats, and holding them out-
stretched stiff and still, it glided swiftly in a downward slant
towards the hedge. For a few seconds I had a perfect silhouette
of him, as with head craned forward, neck straight, boat-shaped
body balanced by the legs and taut wings, and long tapering tail
sloping slightly upwards he steered for the hedge. He ceased
calling, seemed to slacken his rigid frame, drew himself together,
and alighted at the foot of the hedgerow. It was a cock pheasant.
In the poor light His head appeared black, neck-ring grey, and body
dark brown. He stood motionless, the model of alertness. Then
my horse tossed his head and stamped with a hind foot. The

pheasant lowered his head, made a sudden little run forward, and
vanished through the hedge.
VIII.
In rural districts with plenty of cover pheasants are common,
yet elusive. No matter how numerous they are, one does not see
many at a time, nor for long. They pass quickly across the scene,
and for the moment are the most notable feature in it, beautiful in
shape and colouring, alert in their movements, swift and graceful
when I&apos;unning, powerful on the wing. They run with more ease
than most birds, excelled only by the landrail. They run at top
speed through the stubbles or across meadows, feed slowly and
deliberately in the clover, step through gaps with a whisk of their
long tails, or fly low in a slanting direction into the coverts. One
surprises them picking up corn round the ricks, and they sail with
long, sweeping flight into the woods. Early in the morning they
walk leisurely across the high road with a glance right and left, or
wander along the waggon-track, examining the remains dropped
from loaded carts and waggons. They rocket violently up and over
the tops of the highest trees, or slip across the woodland tracks and
out of sight. Working about a farm or strolling in the woods, one
sees pheasants, the cock pheasants so much more prominent than
the hens ; sees them for a few seconds or perhaps minutes, and then
they are gone. When invisible they can he heard, uttering loud,
metallic crows, warning, defiant, or triumphant; at other times
softer and deeper notes, expressive of contentment or well-fed
satisfaction.

For the last two or three seasons we have carried out our
modest observations with the comfort of a house at Upper Fern-tree

in an endeavour to secure photographs and reliable information of

the local birds in their natural surroundings. We always make
it our aim to refrain from injuring our subjects in any way, and,
probably for that reason, know very little of sub-species. We are
more bent on obtaining photographs such as that of the Yellow
Robin than on seeking new forms. It appears to us that the bird in
question would far rather be recorded by photography than have the
honour of position as a type specimen.
Our experience has satisfied us that results can be obtained
even with an inexpensive outfit. Some of our first photographs
w T ere obtained with an ordinary box camera of the cheapest variety.
Much time and energy, however, we have always found it necessary
to spend. During the season 1915-16 practically every week-end
from June to January was spent at Fern-tree Gully. For the early
part of this time our attention was confined almost entirely to the
Lyre-Bird (Menura victories ), with which we were, and are, anxious
to try conclusions. Several week-ends of strenuous hunting through
damp gullies failed to disclose a nest. The time was not wasted,
however, as on two or three occasions we were able to observe from
very close quarters. The first occasion was at Belgrave, when we
located a pair feeding a few yards from a tourist track. By carefully
stepping from log to log we approached close enough to obtain a
glimpse of the male as he paraded to and fro on a fallen tree-fern.
For some time he treated us to imitations of various bird-calls,
including those of the Laughing Jackass, Coachwhip-Bird, and many
others. Eventually our presence became known, and the pair began
to work slowly down the gully. A silent chase on hands and knees
brought us more than once to within a few feet of them when they
paused to feed.
A few weeks later we spent the whole of one damp, foggy
morning watching a male bird we had often heard in the Fern-tree
Gully Reserve. We had located a fresh dancing-mound the week
beiore, and made our way carefully to this spot. Unfortunately for
our proposed attempt at photography, the bird was already on the
mound when we arrived. We were fully compensated, however, by
a fine performance lasting about half an hour, and at a distance of
about six feet. We approached by crawling slowly forward while
the bird was occupied with his performance, and lying motionless

immediately he paused to listen for signs of possible danger. This
he did frequently, and our progress became slow and tedious.
Eventually we reached a position separated from the mound only by
a thin screen of bracken. Then, although uncomfortably wet and
cramped, we spent one of the most interesting half-hours of observa-
tion in our experience. Almost perfect imitations of many bird-calls
followed each other in quick succession, that of the Jackass being
most oft repeated and perhaps least perfect--slightly faulty always
towards the finish. After this lengthy performance the bird walked
slowly into the dense bracken at the far side of the mound, and, to
our delight, turned again in our direction, passing unconcernedly
within four feet of where we lay, unconcealed and almost afraid to
breathe. He then disappeared again into the bracken. The move-
ment of the fern marked his course until he presently reappeared on
a fallen tree about 30 feet distant. Here he proceeded to preen him-
self and dry his plumage in the morning sunshine, now struggling
through the thick fog. His toilet performed, he glided silently down
the hill and out of sight. We had now little hope of his returning in
a reasonable time, but remained on the off-chance for an hour or two
with the camera carefully concealed and focussed on the mound.
At the end of that time we gave it up, but are still confident that a
picture could, with patience, be obtained in this way.
In a gully at Ferny Creek, a little further afield, we located
a pair of Pink-breasted Robins ( Erythrodryas rhodmog aster), but,
owing to being occupied at the nest of a Pilot-Bird {Pycnoptilus
Jloccosus), we were unable to spend sufficient time to discover the
nest, which was undoubtedly somewhere in the vicinity. In the
same gully, on another occasion, we were photographing under diffi-
culties at the nest of a Rufous Fantail ( Bhipidura rufifrons), when
the appearance of a male Leaden Flycatcher ( Myiagra plumbea), a
bird new to us, drove all thought of the Fantail out of our minds.
A long search, however, failed to disclose any nest.
In the more open country towards Lower Fern-tree Gully
we have given considerable attention to the Rufous and Yellow
Whistlers, and have succeeded in securing photographs of both
species. We have also, on one occasion, come across the rarer
Olivaceous Whistler, but were not fortunate enough to find a nest.

However, we are often quite content to spend considerable
time with some of the birds which are more common, and therefore
give more opportunities for choosing suitable circumstances for
photography. Probably the most frequent victim of our enthusiasm
is the Yellow-breasted Robin (Eopsaltria australis), and our nega-
tives of this bird number thirty or more. One of our chief aims,
when time and circumstances allow, is to demonstrate the remarkable
trustfulness exhibited by many of the subjects. The nest contained
newly-hatched young, and the parent bird took little notice when
disturbed, or even placed by hand in a suitable position. Several
other species, including the Jackass, Pilot-Bird, Flame-breasted
Robin, Mistletoe-Bird, Rufous and Yellow Whistlers, Buff-rumped
and Striated Tits, Blue Wren, White-shafted and Rufous Fantails,
and Pardalotes, we have found quite as trustful after a little coaxing.
Unfortunately, we have not been able to make a record of every case.

The summer Council Meeting was held on July 5th by the kind
permission of the Zoological Society at their offices in Regent's Park.
There were present: Mr. Trevor-Battye (chairman), the Hon.
Mrs. Bourke, Miss Chawner, the Marquis of Tavistock, Mr. Astley,
Mr. Ezra, Mr. D. Seth-Smith, Mr. Pocock, Dr. Amsler, Miss
Alderson (Hon. Sec.).
Letters of regret for non-attendance were received from Canon
Dutton, Dr. Butler, and Mr. Willford.
The minutes of the last meeting were read and confirmed.
Mr. Astley having sent in his resignation as Editor, and Mr.
Thomasset (on joining the Army) as Treasurer, Dr. Graham Renshaw
was elected to fill the former post.
It was proposed that the posts of Editor and Treasurer be
combined and filled by one member. Dr. Renshaw, however,
declined to act as treasurer, and Mr. Ezra was appointed to fill
the vacancy.
The Hon. Treasurer's report was found to be quite satisfac-
tory, there being a balance in hand.

Correspondence.
Mr. Sclater and Mr. St. Quintin retired as members of the
Council (see Rule 8), and were appointed Auditor and Scrutineer.
Mr. Astley and Mr. Thom asset were elected as members of the
Council, and a vote of thanks was passed to both for their valuable
services rendered.
The date of the winter meeting was fixed for the end of
February, the exact date to be given later.
A vote of regret was passed on the death--in action--of
Major Perreau. The deceased officer had been a valued member for
nearly fourteen years.
The meeting closed with the usual votes of thanks.
Note.-- Mr. Astley, to whom the very grateful thanks of the
Society are due for continuing the Editorship through a very trying
time, retires at the end of the present year (October). Dr. Graham
Renshaw, who will then become Editor, is the author of several
works on Natural History, an extensive lecturer on Zoology in the
University of Manchester, and reviewer in Zoology for the ' Medical
Chronicle,' and has been a member of the Avicultural Society for
seven years.
We are sure all members will give Dr. Renshaw their good
wishes on his appointment to the post of Editor.
CORRESPONDENCE.
THE NIGHTINGALE IN DEVONSHIRE.
Dear Sir, --I hope I may be allowed to thank Mr. Teschemaker for having
now made it clear that he did not accuse Nelson of having betrayed a confidence.
Mr. Teschemaker also gives the corroboration which, as I stated in my "odd"
letter, was lacking in the article. I have no recollection of the conversation with
Nelson, but I have no reason to doubt that Mr. Teschemaker's present statement
(p. 290) is correct.
In his original article, after explaining how carefully he kept this locality
secret, Mr. Teschemaker said (p. 188) " nevertheless, so incorrigible is the col-
lector's habit of passing on information that even the above vague description

very shortly afterwards found its way into print." The meaning conveyed to me
and others was that Nelson, having received this information in confidence, had
put it into print through me. This was the whole point of my letter, and the other
questions raised by Mr. Teschemaker, who has misunderstood me as I misunder-
stood him, are not worth pursuing, except that I might point out that the last
sentence* in my letter has qualifications which seem to have been overlooked by Mr.
Teschemaker.

Mr. Brook writes from Hoddam Castle :
I have had no luck with the Tanagers (Rhamphoccelus icteronotus) that were
nesting. The young disappeared, and I am sure the old birds ate them. The nests
built were made of fine grass and had a slight lining of cow-hair and were deep
and substantial. The eggs were sky blue, blotched with dark brown on the larger
end, and were elongated in shape.

MY EGRETS.
By Hubert D. Astley.
They arrived in July, 1910, looking decidedly the worse for
wear, their wing feathers broken, their mien dejected. Two Lesser
white egrets from South America (Ardea gazetta, I presume); and
with them were two small dark grey egrets, one of which was a
corpse when the box was opened, and the other one following suit
a few hours afterwards. Horrible ! The little white ones were
allowed to walk out on the verge of the ponds, for seeing they were
very tame, I felt they would not leave the water's edge.
They rapidly improved, putting on flesh and washing off
some of the dirt with which their feathers were stained. They
managed to reach a small island situated in the centre of a small
and shallow pond, where they roosted on willow houghs overhanging
the water, and about a foot from the surface. And thus, until cold
autumnal days, when I caught them to put them of a night in an
inner apartment of the aviary, which is used as a hospital, where
hot pipes warm the air in the winter. On mild days--there were
not many--I turned the egrets out for a few hours, hut before dusk
they always came back, and if the outer door of the aviary was
closed, they stood outside at the top of a flight of four steps, waiting
to he let in. Then they walked sedately down the passage, past two
other compartments, and into their own bedroom. All the summer
they had fish--dace caught in the moat and ponds--hut with the
winter the supply ceased, and I had to give them raw rabbit.

For some hours they absolutely refused to touch it, hungry
as they were, but on finding no fish was forthcoming, they
reluctantly took to the rabbit flesh, and in a day or two seemed to
have forgotten the taste of fish.
As the winter wore on, abating nothing of its severity and
bitter cold, the egrets began to show signs of a lack of robustness,
so that I was glad indeed when I was able in the middle of April
to give them their liberty. Yet still for a week or so they returned
to their winter quarters for the night, having to walk along a paved
path, through a wicket oak gate, and across a bit of lawn to the
aviary door.
Then came an evening when they were not there. Fine
weather had come. They were hack on the willow boughs above
the water, side by side; and how they rejoiced when a fish diet was
once more set before them.
Then in May they moulted, and by the middle of June not
only was their plumage glistening in snowy whiteness, " aigrettes,"
crest, and all, hut their feet became bright yellow, as well as the
skin about the nostrils and as far as the eyes. The legs are greenish.
And then they could fly ! Would they fly far? was my somewhat
anxious thought.
Their tameness is wonderful, and sometimes they have
perched on a window-sill of an open window, peering into the room
if they discovered I was there.
Every morning at 7.30 they stand outside the front door,
awaiting me for their breakfast. If I look out to tell them I will
fetch it, and then go indoors to a bath-room on the ground-floor,
where I keep a supply of live fish, the egrets immediately run ofl&apos;
and take up their position just under the window of the bath-room.
If they see me on a stone bridge which spans the moat with
a fishing-rod in my hand, they fly on to the parapet and sit close to
me, eagerly watching for a catch of fish.
When I pull out the line they both stretch out their necks.
If I have missed the fish, they stand quiet; but if they see a fish on
the hook, they are immediately excited, and, rushing forward, seize
it directly I have it free. Dace of five inches in length they can
swallow whole if their appetite is keen, after which bulky mouthful

they stand with stiffened neck, the fish bulging out the skin, until
after a few minutes it slides into their interiors !
On a stone wall which encloses a pool of water-lilies there
are vases in which grow ancient dwarf Japanese trees (one is two
hundred years old), and on these the egrets often perch. Anyone
might well take them at such moments for Japanese carved ivory.
There are two things they object to. If they see me with a fish-net
in my hand they fly off, although I have never used it for catching
them ; and if my black retriever walks near them they immediately
take wing ; yet several Pekingese dogs can go right up to them.
Up to the middle of August they never flew much, hut after
that they sometimes perched upon the ridge of the barn roofs, from
which elevation they would at once descend with light and silent
wings when they heard my whistle. I wonder whether they were
searching for me when I was absent from home for six days in the
beginning of September, for on my return I was told that on three
consecutive mornings they had taken long flights over the surround-
ing wooded hills, and had soared up and up until they looked " no
larger than bumble-bees." This they had done on the morning of
my return, yet they ceased these charming flights directly they
found me home again. Alarming, because it was thought they were
meditating migration. Certainly they seemed delighted to see me,
so let us hope they will not he so foolish as to leave their happy
home.
I have never had pets more fascinating or more intelligent,
and I may well believe that egrets at full liberty in an English
garden are not to be met with elsewhere in the British Isles.
I have stood and watched them as they waded, sometimes
with the water touching their breasts, when they have a peculiar
mode of stirring up aquatic insects or small fish. One foot is
stretched out in front, the whole leg and foot rapidly trembling,
whilst the bird looks eagerly to see whether anything has stirred
from the mud. Then the other leg is used. The tremolo movement
is very quaint and graceful.
I have seen these little herons, as they waded, reach a spot
where a periwinkle plant hung into the water. One of the egrets,
instead of skirting round it, stretched out its leg, trembled its foot

Mr. Hubert D. Astley,
beneath the leaves, at the same time with outstretched neck peering
eagerly over the foliage to see if any prey broke cover on the other
side. It was as if you or I rattled a stick under some hushes and
leaned over the hush to watch for a bolting rabbit !
Perhaps two of the most beautiful pictures I have stored in
my memory are when one day the two egrets stood at the foot of a
group of gorgeous purple irises, the snow-white birds, the purple
flowers, and the green, sword-like leaves reflected in the water (a
combination of colours which would have appealed to the suffra-
gettes !) ; and when, on an afternoon in June, one of the egrets
performed his tremolo foot movement in shallow water, whilst just
above him, and all but touching him, there showered down great
sprays of a Dorothy Perkins rose, and all this again reflected in
the water--the little snow-white egret and the rose-pink blossoms.
Most beautiful! And amongst the flamingos, they look smaller
than usual in comparison with those tall, long-legged, and long-
necked birds.
I have seen them dance, with crest erected like the head-
dress of a Red Indian, pirouetting amongst the ducks on the shore,
and playfully dabbing at them with stiletto bills.
I have sat down on a stone by the pond's verge, and the two
egrets have come so close to me that I could have touched them--
close, not for food, but evidently for companionship. As Bravan
has written of Arclea helios in Brazil, which he says walks about in
nearly every house, they are " the dearest little things imaginable."
When one knows that innumerable numbers of these
beautiful birds have been sacrificed for their " aigrettes " or
" ospreys," in order to gratify the heartless vanity of Christian (!)
women, I feel almost Hun-like in lack of mercy towards such
females, who deliberately continue to purchase these plumes for
their hats. People plead ignorance on their part. This is not true
in many cases, for I have had women shrug their shoulders at
me in a devil-may-care manner when I have told them that the
" aigrettes " represent the shooting of parent birds and the starva-
tion of nestlings deprived of their source of food. And then we talk
of the inhumanity of the Germans ! In many things our houses are
still built of glass.

The Little Egret has occurred in England. One, for in-
stance, was shot at Penzance in 1824 ; one at Cork in 1792 ; one at
Christchurch in 1822; three at Ai&apos;ley in 183G. There are people
who say the " egrets," written of as common in England in former
days, were lapwings, and it is recorded that Archbishop Nevil had a
thousand "egrets" at his famous feast; and more shame to him,
even if they ivere lapwings !
At any rate, these Little Egrets were common enough in
Europe, and would be still if it were not for the abominable fashion
of wearing their dorsal plumes in human females' head-gear.
One would like to make those women who, knowing the facts,
insist on wearing "aigrettes," stand by to see the egrets slaughtered
--stand by, too, to hear the nestlings calling for food which can no
longer be supplied them ; and remain standing there until the stench
of corpses rose in their nostrils.
I must add that on the morning of September 12th, which
was clear and brilliant, both egrets flew very high at 6.30 a.m.
(summer-time), and to my dismay, when I wont to give them their
breakfast, the male was nowhere to be seen. I searched for him by
three small ponds which lie in different parts, but without avail.
The day passed, leaving me saddened. Seven o'clock arrived, and I
had just remarked to someone that I was afraid the bird had really
started on a migration and would be shot, when, hearing a commo-
tion of swallows' twitterings and cries--for large numbers were
wheeling over the ponds--I looked up, expecting the presence of a
hawk, and there was the lost egret sailing lightly down (a bolt from
the blue!), lie wheeled round me and settled at my feet. I think
lie must have passed the day by a reedy pond on a neighbouring
estate, for he came from that direction, and was not particularly
hungry. However, he could not resist a dace thrown in to the
entrance hall, so that I was able, very reluctantly, to catch him and
clip some feathers of one wing.

such an assemblage of rainbow colours--was there ever such a dis-
tracting din ! We should have thought it indescribable, had not

" Mark that elegant Parrakeet with pure golden plumage. It
is a variety of Palceornis torquatus which is placed beside it.
Observe it on the hand of its favourite keeper, expressing its fond-
ness by a thousand winning ways. It is formed to be the delicice of
some beauty. Its delicate shape and hue would well grace her fair
hand, and the murmuring caresses of its coral beak would be better
lavished on her sweet lip than our worthy friend's bristly chin."
Might not this have been written yesterday, and not, as is
really the case, in 1836 ? For it is taken from an article on the
Zoological Society and its Gardens in ' The Quarterly Review ' for
June of that year, which has for its titular raison d&apos;etre the first
published List of the Animals in the Gardens and the Proceedings
and Transactions for 1836. The writer, from the amount of space
he devotes to birds and the special interest he appears to take in
them, one likes to think of as a " birdy " man himself. After a typical
Quarterly prelude of some pages, thickly set with classical and his-
torical allusion, on zoology from the times of the Caesars, or rather
what stood for zoology then, up to the then quite recent foundation
of the establishment, he asks us to accompany him and " take a
cursory view " of the Gardens. He commences on " the terrace
commanding one of the finest suburban views to be anywhere seen "
where he pauses to enjoy " ' the sweet south ' wafted over the flowery
bank musical with bees, whose hum is mingled with the distant roar
of the great city."
In this particular paragraph the extract may no doubt show
its age, for views' epithet is hardly a fir one to-day, as NAY. 17 can

hardly call itself a suburb in this year of grace (+ war), nor now-
adays in this era of tubes and petrol do we feel very distant from the
great city. But these are details which detract but little from the
wonderful youthfulness of the whole. The mention of epithets
reminds me that the present representative of the yellow parrakeet
of 1836 by no means merits those its predecessor's character received,
although its beauty can be no less than the subject of the eulogy
quoted above. The present lutino, the property of one of our
members, is, I believe, a temporary inmate at the Zoo for reforma-
tory purposes, or perhaps one had better say Borstal treatment; at
any rate, I should prefer not to be the beauty whose lips this one's
beak got anywhere near.
But we must get away from the Parrots and follow our guide
to see the other birds to " the lawn where the black swan, no longer
a rara avis, has twice made her nest, and now rejoices in her two
c yS ne ts, and where the New Holland Goose has hatched and brought
up her young."
We are then taken to the aviary which at that time fronted
the lawn ; is this the present eastern aviary ? Here we are intro-
duced to Crowned, Demoiselle, and Stanley Cranes, "comely"
Curassows, " melancholy-looking Herons and Bitterns that seem to
pine for the whispering of reeds," Spoonbills, Storks, among which
is the Marabou " with its adjutant-like stalk," and lastly, the " Secre-
tary," whose snake-killing deeds receive half a page of picturesque
description. The Marabou, too, has a special paragraph to himself,
which I must quote here, as it might have been written about a bird
I had during my first tour in West Africa, that is, if for " hall " one
reads " hut."
"But just look a moment," we read, "at that ancient, the
Marabou Stork, and only fancy him standing behind his master's
chair at the dining table, expectant of his share of the feast. In
such a situation Smeathman saw one in Africa, which had been quite
domesticated. From his high roost on the silk-cotton trees, he would,
even at the distance of two or three miles, descry the servants
carrying the dishes across the yard, and as they entered the hall
down would he dash among them and take his place at the head of
the table. They had some dilliculty in making our friend the

Dr. E. Hopkinson,
Marabou respect the dishes before the arrival of the guests ; and in
spite of their surveillance and their switches, which they carried m
terrorem, a boiled fowl or two would suddenly disappear every now
and then ; one snatch of that enormous beak, one gulp of that
barathrum of a throat, and the pullet was gone."
The last sentence is perfect in its cinematographic descriptive-
ness. As did this bird of the early days of West Africa, so did ours
of the early days of this century, except that I do not think he ever
managed to collar such valuable dishes as even African fowls are
now that one does not pick up handfuls of gold even on the Gold
Coast, and I know that he never got boiled ones, for these are
anathema maranatha to his owner. He, too, however far away he
might have been at other times, was always about the compound at
" chop-time," and never had two or three miles to cover at the last
moment.
Pelicans, Emus, and other large birds are noticed, but nothing
is said about small birds, so that we may presume that they were
entirely absent from the collection or in very small numbers and
hidden away somewhere, probably in the Parrot-house, and perhaps
in those little glass-topped boxes, which are now no more than a
hideous memory. Certainly there was nothing at all resembling the
large aviaries of the present, the Western, the Waders, and best of
all, the Summer aviary, where visitors can walk practically among the
birds. The Eagles at this time were kept, I suppose, in the range of
aviaries, the base and back of which now stand derelict alongside the
tea-place and forming a place for any overflow from that table-dotted
area. The Eagle-house, the Quarterly Keviewer confesses, he never
passes without a pang : many still feel the same. Eagles never look
happy in captivity, though I expect that it is more a matter of looks
than anything else, for birds must be like people--among both are
some who cannot possibly look happy even in the midst of happiness.
His pity is also excited by a Blackcock, for which there was only " a
coop instead of the wide-spreading moor, and the soiled and trampled
turf instead of the fresh wild heather ! Better, far better (he muses)
" for him to roam, with the chance of being
' Whistled down with a slug in his wing,'
than to linger out a cheerless unnatural life thus."

These are the only sad notes struck during the tour, if one
excepts the reference to the inevitable " hills of mortality." Here
the London clay receives its due share of blame for the frequent
length of these; the same is as true to-day as then. However, it is
noted that the sick beasts have the benefit of the service of " a learned
and experienced medical attendant," who, however, we are told often
had to contend with great difficulties in " administering remedies
and performing operations, bleeding for instance." Here in these
last three words is a true and certain index to the age of the article,
even if it had been put before us undated and without any external
evidence of its origin. But otherwise, and as a whole, it is remark-
ably modern and even apropos to the present, not only as regards
things actually pertinent to its subject, hut generally speaking, for it
includes, in fact, begins with, that time-honoured British institution
a " grouse," and one, too, at the British Government, a form of
grouser, which I suppose has always been one of our special
privileges from time immemorial, and will remain so until the end.
This is where I ought to end also, hut I cannot help throw-
ing out the suggestion that the Zoological Society should reprint the
whole article, so interesting is it, not only to a casual reader, but
also historically. The Society could from its records add notes on
the persons and incidents mentioned in the review itself and on the
many changes in the geography of the Gardens between then and
now. If this idea commends itself to those who sit at the zoological
helm, I would suggest that those old woodcuts of scenes and build-
ings in the Gardens some of which appear as tailpieces in the two
volumes of ' The Gardens and Menagerie Delineated,' should he used
to illustate the review itself, as they were no doubt well known to
the writer thereof and are certainly most suitable companions to his
account, both in character and period, for the volumes mentioned
appeared in 1830, while photographs would do the same for the
modern notes which 1 hope wiH accompany and amplify it.
Where was the Lion house of those days, and where were
Monkeys? Presumably not far from the lawn, for our reviewer
calls that " monkey green," and wonders that any can he found to
gaze at apes when it (the green) " is crowded with England's richest
beauty."

These and hosts of other such questions ask for answers
before it is too late, and how better can they be answered than by
such a union of past and present as that I suggest.
A few of the 1836 visitors' stopping places still are recog-
nisable, but to most change has come, no doubt, nearly always for
the better, for he laments the large number of temporary wooden
buildings which disfigured the Gardens in his time and which were
a necessity owing to some rule or regulation forbidding the raising
of any building above a certain height. I seem to recognise little
beyond the Terrace, the Tunnel, and that " apartment where lived
. the most amiable of Quasimodos, the Chimpanzee." The
last, with its smell compounded of ape, ant-eater, and hot-water
pipes, is now a thing of the past, or more accurately, part of the
present palatial offices, but the two first are still with us, and one on
its way to have a twin brother. Heaven preserve us from any danger
of the other being similarly favoured. Our writer, it is true, was a
great admirer of the Terrace, and regrets that a proposal by the
architect to continue it " along the southern (!) line " was rejected
(Gratias Deo. EH.) on account of the health of the animals. How
he would have loved the Mappin Terraces !

A lot of people say I have influence over birds. I think it is
the other way about; birds have influence over me and have
captured my affections, and since taking up the hobby have added a
lot of pleasure to me, both indoors and out. Indoors, by their lovely
song during the dull winter months, and their many different ways
of showing their acknowledgment for kindness shown in captivity.
Out. of doors, what is more beautiful when the hawthorn is in
bloom and all the birds in full song, than to sit in the meadows and
listen to all their varied notes in Nature's fulness?
The caroling of the Lark, the shrill and varied song of the
Thrush, the flute-like notes of the Blackbird, and many others, all
seem to blend together in lovely harmony and make one marvel at

the wonders of Nature. All this I did not understand till I took up
the hobby, and for that reason alone I would advise all who can to
keep a few birds.
The first bird I ever had was a greenfinch. This bird became
so tame that he would follow me from room to room and fly on my
shoulder, then from picture to picture, and when a saucer of water
was placed on the table would soon be down and have a bath, then
back on the pictures again and finish his toilet.
Next bird I had was a linnet. This bird became very tame
also; he would fly on a boot whilst I was repairing it and take a
seed from my tongue, then fly back on to the shop clock and sing
away ; also, when my wife washed the children he would tly on edge
of bath and dip his little head in and have a little bath by throwing
the water over himself, needless to say to the delight of the children
and us all.
Next bird I had was a thrush. This I also tamed to sit on
my finger, and at night when I and my wife were having supper he
would fly from my shoulder to hers and share our meal, then a fly
round on the pictures. A stray cat finished this lovely songster's
career, by clawing him through the cage bars, mauling him so much
that he died next day.
I tried to procure another nest the following year, but arrived
on holiday in Bishop Stortford too late in the season, and ail I could
find was a nest with two Blackbirds. These I took home and
reared ; one I sold, the other I kept and trained to whistle four
tunes, viz. : " If you want to know the time ask a Policeman,"
chorus of " The Old Folks at Home," " Are you Working," and a little
dancing ditty.
All these he would whistle to me at any time and never kept
me waiting more than two minutes morning, noon, or night; even
at 12 midnight he has obliged me, no matter how many strangers
near.
Th ree photos of this bird were taken by a ' Daily Sketch '
representative and were reproduced in that journal, June 11th, 1912.
I foolishly sold him for #8 and regretted it ever since, for I
have failed to train another since then.
Last year I reared several Blackies; two of them had very

opposite temperaments. One would unfasten his cage-door and open
it, but not fly out. The other, if I opened his cage-door wide would
close it himself, first by hopping on to ledge, stand there and reach
door-bar with his beak, close it as far as possible, then step back on
to cage bottom and finish closing it with quite a bang. Tins was
witnessed scores of times by some officers billeted here, and they
used to say he shut the door to keep the draught out !
I could mention several other occurrences with different birds,
but time will not permit.
I maintain that any bird or animal can be tamed and trained,
and its confidence gained by kindness and general good friendly
treatment, and my advice to all bird-keepers is : Study your captive
pets' different ways and whims, feed them as naturally as possible,
never grudge the time taken to attend them, for you get amply repaid
by health and song and their beautiful appearance. :
THE SECRETARY BIRD.
By Graham Renshaw, M.D., F.R.S.E.
" Clad in the parish uniform of grey jacket and black breeches, observe
how ceremoniously the pompous villain struts along with his quill jauntily stuck
behind his ear, like a lawyer's clerk." -- Sir William Harris on the Secretary Bird.
Those who have read Sir William Cornwallis Harris's fasci-
nating ' Portraits of the Game and Wild Animals of Southern Africa
will recall many apt descriptive phrases which occur in that valuable
work. lie writes, for instance, of the i; peacock necks" of a troop of
giraffe, of the " magpie flanks " of a gemsbok, of the "round goose-
berry eyes " of a lion ; but his happiest touch seems to be his com-
parison of the stately, striding Secretary Bird to some old-fashioned,
dignified parish clerk. Harris's work includes a South African land-
scape drawing, with antelopes and a couple of Secretaries. One bird
is shown perched on a small ant-hill, turning its plumed head as it
surveys the landscape, while its mate sails on high over the parched

valley, carrying a snake in its beak. Although somewhat amateurish
in execution, the truthfulness of the picture is self-evident, and gives
a most interesting glimpse of bird life. It is a drawing which gives
a more realistic conception of wild creatures at home than many
lines of letterpress.
The Secretary Bird differs widely from most of the species
known to aviculture; for these are often rare and delicate, whereas
the Secretary has been easily kept in captivity, time after time, ever
since there lias existed any study which by tbe widest interpretation
could be called aviculture. Even in tbe prehistoric days of the
Dutch rule at the Cape the " Sagittarius " was well known, for it
occurred everywhere, even in the extreme south, and its striding
walk, as it paced the Hats, caused it to be likened to an archer
marching to attack. The earliest living example in Europe was a
bird sent to Holland by Heer Hemmy, a member of the Board of
Justice at the Cape. It was a present to the Prince of Orange, who
placed it in his menagerie--at that time almost the finest (if not the
finest) zoological collection in existence. The menagerie was in-
stalled at the Hague, and was described by Arnaut Vosmaer in a
quarto work, entitled ' Regnum Animale '--a lengthy production in
thirty-one parts, which took several years to publish. He also
published in 17G9 a special notice of the new bird, " Bescbryving van
eenen Africanschen Roofvogel." Thus was tbe Secretary Bird intro-
duced to European aviculture, under the direct patronage of royalty
and the learned benediction of science.
The first examples seen in England were a pair owned by
Mr. Raymond, of Ilford--at least a pair were originally sent home--
one bird died, possibly before it reached Mr. Raymond. The survivor
was seen by George Edwards, who described it in the ' Philosophical
Transactions' for 1771. Further importations followed; thus, in
1780, Buffon remarked that the Secretary was to be seen in " some
English menageries," and a year later it was figured by Latham
from three which he had seen alive in England. These early impor-
tations reflect the greatest credit on all concerned--undertaken, and
successfully undertaken, in the days when the voyage from the Cape
was of an utterly wearisome length, and when aviculture was in its
early infancy.

The Tower of London is famous for its list of illustrious
victims, though block and axe have long been idle. About 1828,
however, it witnessed a novel tragedy. The famous Tower menagerie
at that time included a Secretary Bird, together with several other
African animals, such as a lion, cheetahs, spotted hyaenas, a hyaena
dog, baboons, and so forth. The Secretary being one day let out for
an airing, thrust an inquiring head into the cage of a hyaena, who
promptly bit it off. Tims the unfortunate bird, like many other
better known characters, was in deed and truth " beheaded in the
Tower."
Probably the most earnest student of the Secretary Bird was
M. Jules Verreaux. In his day he was a well-known collector, and
with his brother established the firm of Verreaux Freres, naturalists
and taxidermists. The trophies of Sir Alexander Smith and Sir
William Harris were mounted by Verreaux's, and specimens of their
art are still to be seen at the Natural History Museum at South
Kensington. Long resident at the Cape, Jules Verreaux had many
opportunities of natural history study ; he kept a large collection of
living animals, which included many Secretary Birds. He was
apparently the first aviculturist to breed them in captivity, though
the experiment got no further than the egg stage. Three eggs were
laid and partly incubated, but the crowded state of the menagerie
precluded complete success. Firmly convinced of the great value of
the Secretary as a vermin-destroyer, Verreaux advocated its intro-
duction into the French colonies, and when M. Freycinet went in
1826 to govern Cayenne he took with him several pairs on Verreaux's
recommendation. Unfortunately, the colonists took so little interest
in the experiment that it proved a failure; perhaps, also, the climate
of Cayenne was unfavourable to the new importations. A whole-
hearted aviculturist, Verreaux also advised the introduction of the
Secretary into Algeria and even India ; from what the present writer
has seen of the former country the wide, sandy, reptile-haunted
wastes of the Sahara would seem excellently adapted to its habits.
Northern Africa, indeed, curiously parallels Southern Africa in many
of its characters; in Sahara and Karroo alike there occur arid sandy
flats, with appropriate desert fauna. In the North, for instance, we
find various gazelles, in the South the springbok : in the North the

jerboa rats, in the South the leaping hare ; in both, ostriches,
bustards, and sand-grouse. In spite of Verreaux's efforts, no further
efforts to acclimatise the Secretary seem to have been made, either in
Algeria or anywhere else.
The writer has studied some eight of these birds in captivity ;
they are a fine ornament to any collection, especially if they can be
allowed a considerable amount of freedom. Elegant and dignified,
the Secretary is remarkable for the pen-like plumes which decorate
the occiput and wave gracefully with every movement of the head ;
these plumes can be erected under sudden excitement, like the
dorsal crest of the springbok. When in good health Secretaries are
very playful, running along with wings outspi'ead in flamingo fashion,
or leaping high in the air like a game-cock. In more serious mood
they slowly patrol the ground, gaze directed sideways, carefully
inspecting grass and herbage for mouse or rat or lizard. When prey
is sighted the bird runs quickly up, striking rapid and repeated
blows with a small but powerful foot until it is subdued ; in devouring
it the Secretary holds it with the foot and tears off morsels with the
heak. These birds are amusingly expert flycatchers, portly and
heedless bluebottles being suddenly stamped flat, and carefully eaten
as diet accessories. Then the stately walk is resumed, the long tail
swaying up and down (and often from side to side) as the bird paces
the grass. When standing still the tail almost touches the ground ;
a favourite attitude is a resting position supported on one leg and
the foot of the other, the tarsus being flexed and all the toes con-
tracted. The Secretary often rests squatted on the ground like
a game-bird, especially during the hottest part of the day. The
writer would call attention to a character apparently hitherto un-
noticed--namely, the large beautiful eye of this species, liquid and
lustrous as that of a giraffe, the resemblance being heightened by the
"eyelashes," composed of altered feathers.
Verreaux states the egg of the Secretary Bird to be white,
unspotted, but one now before me is cream colour, faintly marked all
over with dull rust red. In consideration of the wide range of the
species there is probably wide variation in the egg also.

" We have here an illustration of the value of possessing living examples of
rare and little-known animals."-- Mr. A. D. Bartlett on a species of Apteryx.
The first aviculturist to keep Mantell's Apteryx appears to
have been the Bev. Mr. Yate, of Waimate, New Zealand. In
January, 1834, he received a single specimen, which he kept alive,
and probably intended to send to London--a live Apteryx, or even a
dead one, being then much desired at the Zoo. The only example
then in England was one in the museum of Lord Derby; so little
was the bird known that on the Continent its very existence was
questioned. Lord Derby set all doubt at rest by forwarding his
unique specimen to London ; it was unstuffed, and exhibited before
the Zoological Society on February 12th, 1833. Mr. Yarrell then
described the bird, and appealed for more specimens on behalf of the
Society ; and Mr. Macleay, the Colonial Secretary for New South
Wales, asked Mr. Yate to try and get one. A second individual was
duly procured, as we have seen ; unfortunately, in Mr. Yate's absence
from home, it died. The bird had lived for nearly a fortnight; alive
or dead it was worth preserving, and one of Mr. Yate's boys managed
to skin it. The legs, however, rotted off, and this mangled relic w ? as
all that reached Mr. Macleay. He sent it to England to the
Zoological Society; imperfect as it was, it had scientific value as
the second knowm specimen of a very rare bird.
The first Mantell's Apteryx to reach Europe alive was a
female, received at the Zoo in 1851. She was a gift from Lieut.-
Governor Eyre, and had travelled in state by H.M.S. " Havannah,"
under the care of Admiral Erskine. She became somewhat of a
celebrity ; her portrait appeared in the illustrated papers, and various
descriptions in the press noted her habits and appearance. An
excellent figure, for example, appeared in the ' Illustrated LondQn
News ' for December 27th, 1851. The bird is shown in a character-
istic attitude, standing huddled up, the tip of her bill resting on the
iloor ; so excellent is the portraiture that she must have been sketched
from life--no artist drawing from a skin (or from imagination) could
have rendered a pose at once so singular and so truthful. The bird

was kept in the " new ostrich house," then recently built in the
north-east corner of the Gardens. The writer well remembers this
structure; it contained five loose boxes and was paved with brick,
and was used for housing the Society's Cassowaries. In later years
it also contained a good series of Apteryxes -- Apteryx oiveni and
A. australis, as well as A. mantelli. This interesting little building
was eventually pulled down to make way for the new zebra house,
which was completed in 1899.
The public flocked to see the Apteryx. In the daytime she
slept in a square deal box, one side of which was hinged to allow
easy inspection of the inmate; there was also a back exit covered
with a curtain of sacking. The bird was fed on earthworms, for
which she used to probe in a heap of soil placed in the stall; she
never stamped her feet " to bring the worms to the surface "--thus
exploding one more zoological myth. She was bad-tempered, and
no wonder, for she had been teased on board ship, and being
frequently disturbed for inspection would not tend to improve
matters. Fresh bands of visitors were admitted to the little house;
London came to view the Apteryx as it had come to see the hippo-
potamus the year before, and in the year after would come to see the
great Anteater. Apparently the public expected to see a bird at least
as big as a Cassowary, and was frankly disappointed. " What a
little thing it is" was the constant remark of visitors, for the
distinguished stranger was no bigger than a large fowl. This, or
another individual, is excellently figured in two positions in the Rev.
J. G. Wood's ' Illustrated Natural History,' standing by a pool in the
moonlight, with fern scrub, which gives a good idea of the size of the
bird. In figuring any animal, and especially one that is new or little
known, such accessories should always be introduced to indicate the
comparative size of the subject portrayed. Unfortunately, in the old
natural histories this point was too often neglected, the so-called
" illustration " frequently giving a totally erroneous impression of
size.
The Apteryx throve, and lived many years in the Zoo, under
the successive (and successful) care of three superintendents--
Messrs. Miller, Thompson, and A. D. Bartlett. On June 9th, 1859,
she laid an egg, and another in February, 1860. After this she

began to lay regularly, there being two eggs every year. In September,
1863, Major E. Ruck Keane obtained a second Apteryx from a Maori,
who had taken it in a swamp ; this was safely brought to England,
and the Major presented it to the Zoo. In spite of the other bird's
peevish temper the two agreed well together after a few days. In
1865, a male bird, which had been presented by Surgeon Henry
Slade; R.N., showed a wish to pair with the original bird of 1851--
now some fourteen years in the collection, and like a famous whiskey,
" still going strong." Two eggs were laid, and the male incubated
them constantly for more than three months, but without result.
At last he gave up exhausted; the eggs were found to be clear.
Apteryxes subsequently became fairly well known to Conti-
nental aviculture. In 1870, the German Consul at Wellington
received from Sir W. L. Buller several Mantelli for transmission to
Berlin. At that time they were still common in parts of New
Zealand ; in 1871, two more were added to the London Zoo--one
purchased, and the other as a gift from Mr. A. Lafone. In 1902, the
writer saw both Mantell's and Owen's species in the great zoological
garden at Amsterdam. In 1902, there was an Apteryx at Cologne ;
it was kept in the ostrich-house, a curious structure built like a
mosque, lighted from above, and heated in winter by two stoves. In
the same year an Apteryx mantelli was received at the Berlin Zoo-
logical Gardens.
During the past sixteen years the writer has had the good
fortune to see some five individuals of Mantell's Apteryx. These
birds spend the entire day in profound sleep, never stirring till all is
dark ; if several are kept they huddle together in a heap. In slumber
the bird lies with the feet bent under the body, and the head directed
backwards ; the bill is pressed close to the side, and lies above the
wing and not beneath it, whereas in certain flightless birds, such as
penguins, the bill lies belonv the wing. On being lifted out of its
straw the Apteryx usually remains passive in the observer's grasp,
though some individuals struggle and kick. The brown hairy plumage
and whisker-like vibrissse of Mantell's species suggest a mammal
rather than a bird ; the legend of the kaureke, a rat-like mammal
formerly supposed to inhabit New Zealand, was probably founded on
some hasty glimpse of a running Apteryx. The eye of this bird is

black (not red or green, as shown in the old books, according to the
imagination of the artist!) Apteryxes do not seem to be at all
incommoded by daylight, although they are so strictly nocturnal ;
the eyes are of a diurnal type, being quite small, as in the Owl
Parrot (also nocturnal)--one would have expected to find large
globular eyes in both birds. The beak in life is dead white, but
in museum specimens may be dark brown--when this occurs it is
due to careless collecting, for if the dead bird is carried head down-
wards in the usual fashion the delicate capillaries of the beak
become congested with blood, thus imparting a dusky tint to the
beak.
Apteryxes vary in temper, some being quite placid under
examination, others struggle and growl if picked up. When really
angry the bird rears up like a Cassowary, lengthening the head and
neck ; it then kicks savagely forward, raising the foot right up to the
body, and growls--once heard, the curious rough growl of an Apteryx
is never forgotten. The various species may be fed on worms, but
minced meat is a more convenient diet in captivity. In conclusion,
the writer would call attention to the excellent photographs of
Apteryxes, by Gam bier Bolton and others, which have been published
in recent years--especially the " portrait of a gentleman " ; i. e.

THE GREAT BIRD OF PARADISE ON THE
ISLAND OF LITTLE TOBAGO (Paradisea
apoda).
By Sir William Ingram (with Caretaker&apos;s Diary).
I introduced the Great Bird of Paradise on the Island of
Little Tobago eight or nine years ago. The birds were collected in
the Aru Islands, New Guinea.

Sir William Ingram,
Birds are about as far as possible from their native land, but that
their proximity to the Equator is very nearly the same.
A watcher is always left in charge of the birds, the first man
engaged for this job having been a very intelligent sailor, who gave
out that he was a Swiss ; but when he was dying he disclosed the
fact that he was a runaway son of a Bohemian Professor.
His successor was a black man who somewhat objected to a
lonely life on the Island, and who took with him a dusky woman
who was already married, and whose lawful husband invaded the
peaceful home of the Paradise Birds, murdered his former wife and
the son of the watcher, leaving the latter with very little breath in
his body !
Now an ex-policeman, a negro, looks after the Island and
seems fairly intelligent. It is his reports which I send, in the form
of a diary, since they may interest the members of the Avicultural
Society.
As to the success of the experiment of acclimatising the
Great Bird of Paradise there seems little doubt, and their numbers
having apparently increased, there is a hope that they will become
naturalised.

a part of the Island; seen and heard the birds as usual.
I notice they are keeping more in the high woods, being much
cooler, than in the front part of the Island, all the same they are
seen and heard all over the Island. I also notice that they feed
on the Parasol Tree berries, which are plentiful on the Island,
especially in this season. Left in the afternoon and patrolled as
above, plenty of high winds day and night. We had a slight
shower of rain at about 7 p.m., but did not continue for any time.

Saturday. 5/5/17.
Left Camp in the morning; watered the birds, and patrolled
a part of the Island ; seen and heard the birds as usual, nothing
unusual among them as far as I can see, there is a great increase
among them to when I took charge of the Island 13 months ago,
and they all appear quite homely and about the Island, their popularity
is no difference with them and the real native birds. Left in the
afternoon, and patrolled as above; plenty of high winds all the time
day and night, no rain ; sea very rough ; bay impassable; all correct.

wherever I go. Shot one Hawk. Very warm day, rain threatening
all the time, the birds seem very happy all the time, and very
pretty to look at, and to hear their curious way of crying is
something amusing. Left in the afternoon and patrolled as above;

Tuesday. 8/5/17.
Left Camp in the morning, watered the birds, and patrolled

flying about from point; all through the day they are seen and
heard, the same as the common birds, they are all over the Island ;
very warm day, no rain, high winds as usual. Left in the afternoon,
and patrolled as above. Shot one Hawk. Can't find any nest of
the P. Birds as yet which is a puzzle to me, as there are a great
many young birds I see daily, furthermore there is a great increase
in the P. birds to a year ago, when I took charge all of the same,
I have not given up looking ; any one visiting the Island, there will
be no difficulty in seeing the birds, as they are all over the place,
all correct.

the Hawks, and as fast as I can get within reach of them they
are shot; no rain, and not very high winds, weather very hot and
calm seas; took a slight patrol in the afternoon; seen and heard
the birds which there are no difficulty in, they are always Hying and
alighting in front of the house, they are looking beautiful in bright
plumage; all correct.

Monday. 14/5/17.
Left Camp in the morning; watered the P. B., and patrolled
a part of the Island, as I usually do; seen and heard them in their
happy style. Shot one Hawk. Weather continues to be very warm,
no rain; I notice the P. B. keep more in the thickest parts of the
land or wooded parts where they gets more cover from the sun,
than on the front part of the Island. Left in the afternoon, and
patrolled as above. Shot another Hawk. These hawks are very
much dreaded by the other birds; no rain as yet, the sun continues
to be very hot; high winds during the night; sea ordinary; all
correct.

Tuesday. 15/5/17.
Left Camp in the morning with gun ; watered the birds and
patrolled a part of the Island; seen and heard the P. B. as usual
flying about from point to point; no rain during the right, but slight
drizzling in the morning, and high winds all the time. The Island
is very much more drier this year than last year, everything is
parched. Left in the afternoon, and patrolled as above; seen the
birds quite happy flying about from point to point. Shot one Hawk:
all correct.
J. H. Hamilton.
Wednesday. 16/5/17.
Left in the morning, watered the birds, and patrolled a part

more than when I took charge last year, there are plenty of young
ones, which has made the number greater, it is a pretty sight, to
sit under a tree where they assemble on, and to hear their peculiar
crying calling the others, it is something amusing. Whilst I was
under a panoll apple tree, looking at them, the female bird stood

there and cried, cried for about ten minutes, then I saw six younger
ones come and joined her, then the male bird came also, in fact,
several male birds came, and there was such a noise among them,
it was something amusing. Left Camp in the afternoon, and
patrolled as above. Shot three (3) Hawks. I believe every bird
in the Forest are afraid of them. No rain, very warm day, and
dry; sea very calm ; all correct.
Jno. H. Hamilton.
Thursday. 17/5/17.
Left Camp in the morning, watered the birds, and patrolled
a part of the Island; seen and heard them as usual. Shot two (2)
Hawks, they are plentiful in this season, they are the greatest
enemies to other birds. Very warm day, plenty of hot sun; it is
a pleasure to see and hear the P. Birds, especially the male birds
with their heavy plumage, looking so pretty, there is a good many
young ones, as I notice to-day. Left in afternoon, and patrolled
as above. Shot two (2) more Hawks, they are raging on the Island,
I am at them morning and afternoon, all the same it seems that
the P. Birds are not afraid of them, for I notice when the hawks
cry the other birds keep still, or fly off from where they were, but
the P. Birds remains and go on in their usual way crying and
jumping about from limb to limb; no rain, and very sultry day
and very hot; sea very calm ; all correct.
Jno. H. Hamilton.
Friday. 18/5/17.
Left Camp in the morning and watered the birds, also
patrolled a part of the Island ; seen and beard the P. B. in their
usual style. I believe in the next two years, the Island will be all
over Birds of Paradise, for in any part you go they are seen in parties
of least six or seven, flying from point to point, they are increasing
splendidly. No rain. Left in the afternoon, and patrolled as above;
seen and heard the birds as usual ; weather continues to be very
warm ; sea calm ; all correct.

Sir William Ingram,
they are plentiful on the Island at this time of the year, although it
seems to me that the large P. B. or the old ones does not seem afraid
of the hawks. Weather continues to be very hot, no rain, every-
thing dry. I must say the birds are encourageing to look at, their
beauty alone is something to look at, they are increasing rapidly
as can be seen. Left Camp in the afternoon, and patrolled as above ;
nothing unusual. Shot another Hawk. The Island is so warm,
especially on the borders of the land, that the P. B. keeps more in
the centre parts of the land or forest, not until in the afternoon
between four and five they comes in nearer, I noticed that they do-
not like heat, they are fond of a large tree well cornered, and rain ;
all correct.
Jno. H. Hamilton.
Sunday. 20/5/17.
Left Camp in the morning and watered the birds, also made
a short patrol; seen and heard the birds as usual; in fact, whilst
writing this there are four of them alight just 20 yds. in front of
the house, one male, one female, and two young ones, feeding on
parasol berries; we had two short showers of rain during the day,
and strong winds all the time, to the delight of the P. B., they fly
about and cry more; can't find any nest as yet, but still looking
daily; all correct.

Monday. 21/5/17.
Left Camp in the morning and watered the birds, and
patrolled a part of the Island as usual; seen and heard the birds
all the time; fair shower of rain in the morning whilst I was on
patrol, its just what the birds like; I have seen a good many young
ones this morning. Shot a Hawk. Left Camp in the morning,
and patrolled as above; seen and heard the birds as usual; high
winds all the time and calm seas ; nothing unusual on the Island,
only it is very dry this year, and windy; the birds are all looking
in the pink of condition, as to their plumage nothing looks more
beautiful, as to their young ones, they can be seen all over the
place ; all correct.

as above, could not do much patrol on account of raining, all the
same I saw the birds and heard them, it is their delight when
the rain is falling, as I have afore mentioned, there is no trouble in
seeing or hearing them whatever as they are about the Island as
the native common birds, they eats the same berries as the native
birds, comes down to the water pots and drinks their water the same
way, no difference whatever ; all correct.

Wednesday. 23/5/17.

Returned to Island at about 7.30 a.m., found all correct. Left
Camp in the afternoon and patrolled a part of the Island; seen
and heard the P. Birds flying about from point to point, looking
beautifully. We have been getting frequent showers for the last
three days, everything looking green again, also the birds seem
happier when it is raining, than otherwise; very high winds all
the time, all the same, the weather seems delightful to the birds
as they seem not to like the hot sun, they prefer rain and wind,
as you will see and hear them more often ; sea calm and smooth ;
all correct.

Sunday. 27/5/17.

Tuesday. 29/5/17.
Left Camp in the morning and patrolled a part of the Island ;
seen and heard the P. Birds all the time; high winds continuously
all the time; the P. Birds seem much happier than in the hot
weather, as I have noticed in the hot weather they do not fly
about from place to place so often as since the rain begin to fall:
there is a good many young birds now, they can be seen at any time
as they are all over the place, you would scarcely see a Paradise
Bird on the ground, sometime you may see them one or two at
the waterpot, they are high flown birds, and like plenty of cover,
that is thick shaded trees. Shot one Hawk this morning, there are
plenty on the Island, and not very easy to get at, all the same I am
at them daily. Left Camp in the afternoon and patrolled as above;
slight drizzling of rain and very high winds in the afternoon and
during the night, all through the high winds and rains you can
hear the P. Birds crying and flying about, the weather makes no
difference with them, they seem happier; heavy seas all the time:
all correct.

Left Camp in the morning and patrolled a part of the Island
as usual; seen and heard the birds; no rain for the day only plenty
of high winds; I cannot find the nests of the P. Birds, its a difficult
task, as they are high flown,* the only time they may be seen on the
ground is when per chance, they are at the waterpot drinking water,
even to-day going through some of the wooded parts of the Island,

you can see them more than in the clearer parts of the Island, and
on the highest trees, and always by themselves, you will never find
them among the native birds. Left in the afternoon and patrolled
as above ; nothing unusual; found all correct.

Thursday. 31/5/17.
Left Camp in the morning, patrolled a part of the Island and
watered the birds; seen and heard the birds as usual; they come
all near the house, whilst I am now writing they are not more than
100 yds. off crying and flying from tree to tree; no rain for the day
but plenty of high winds; all the same, the Island is looking green
again, which seems a happier time for the Paradise Birds, especially
as they are very fond of covered trees, in my opinion, the Island
will be nothing but Paradise Birds, as they are increasing rapidly,
they are seen in groups wherever you go. Left in the afternoon,
watered the birds, and patrolled as above; all regular; the Bay
starting to be rough again ; all correct.*

Bridgeman. --We regret to announce the sudden death, at the
age of 71, of General the Hon. Francis C. Bridgeman, a son of the
3rd Earl of Bradford, and uncle of Commander the Hon. Richard
O. B. Bridgeman, whose death has already been recorded in our
Magazine. Both were members of the Society.
CORRESPONDENCE.
A THIRD BROOD OF SHAMAHS.
Dear Sir,-- You will be interested to learn that the last brood of young
Shamahs has been a success, and the five youngsters are strong on the wing and
nearly " weaned."
Eleven for the season, which is rather lucky after nearly losing both the
present birds at the start.
[Certainly a most glowing account. It seems curious that no nest has been
found. Is there not a Mocking Bird on the island ? Some account of
the native birds would be interesting._ Ed.]

Sixteen eggs laid, one unfertile, two failed to hatch, two casualties.
The parents were most anxious to nest for the fourth time, but notwithstand-
ing their fine condition, I judged it wiser to remove the cock indoors. There was
great lamentation at this, and every time I appeared he commenced singing, and
sidled up to me on his perch, asking in the plainest possible way to be allowed to
rejoin his wife.
Little food was consumed by either at first, and I was afraid the youngsters
might be neglected. However, nothing of the kind happened. In the absence of
the nesting-box, the hen collected fragments of hay about the length of a match,
and dumped them into odd corners (when she was not pushing them down hex-
children's throats !). The makers of bricks without straw were not in it with her,
for she tried to build a house without materials or suitable foundation, being quite
assured, poor little thing, that her lord and master, whom she heai&apos;d singing con-
stantly, would return very shortly.
I think there are two hens and three cocks in the third brood.

UVCEAN PARRAKEETS.
In case anyone is able to profit by my sad experience with Uvoean Parrakeets,
I may as well give it. Early in the spring I received three in fair order, which
did well for some time, being fed on the usual parrakeet diet. During the hot
weather in May, they were turned into an outdoor aviary, and a few weeks later
died, one after the other, after a few days' sudden and severe illness. Post-mortem
examinations revealed in every case some enteritis, extreme ansemia, and brittleness
of bones. The last bird had no hemp seed for about a week befoi-e it fell ill.
I am told that the secret of keeping these birds is fresh air and no hemp.
Mine had the fresh air, and I cannot quite see why hemp should cause anasmia.
Would Parrish's chemical food have saved them ?
Yours, etc., Tavistock.
Perhaps Monsieur Delacour can give some information, as I believe he still
has a Uvoean Parrakeet in good health. W'ould mealworms and leather-jackets be
eaten ? My Queen Alexandra Parrakeets eat them greedily, and they must be very
nutritious. H. D. A.
Sib,--S hould not the title of the paper on p. 304 of the September number
more correctly read, " St. Helena Waxbill--Cordon Bleu Hybrid," seeing that the
Cordon w r as the female parent ?
Dr. Butler, ' Avicultural Magazine,' New Series, iv, p. 350, recorded
11 Cordon--St. Helena Hybrids " (apparently obtained abroad); but is not Mr.
Drelincourt Campbell's the first success this way--" St. Helena x Cordon "?

Dear Sir, --Is there any distinctive marking between the sexes of Red
Collared Lorikeets?
I bought a cock and then a pair (supposed to have started nesting, but
the box fell before the eggs were laid). The pair seem exactly alike, are smaller
and more lightly built, collar orange, not red, and not so much red nor so bright

about the chest and under the wings, and the black of the belly is not so intense--
more of a deep green in most lights (the cocks are black, with green or purple
shine according to the light).
They have all been together for two days only and not fought, though I
think the old cock has a preference for one of the pair, which the other does
not seem to resent, as you would expect a cock to. The pair keep together
very closely, but the cock is always very near, displays, and sometimes kisses
one or perhaps both; I cannot tell which is which.
Would our cock be likely to take on two hens, like budgrigars some-
times will, and is it too late to let them nest, as he evidently wishes to, but there
is no box ?
lou were kind enough to write me interesting letters before, so I am
venturing to bother you again.

When examining the skins of the parrots in the Natural History Museum
about the year 1906, in order to note external sexual differences for my little
book, " How to Sex Cage-Birds," I failed to discover any constant colour
characters by which to distinguish the sexes ; but I noted that the beak of the
female was narrower beyond the middle than in the male and tapered more
towards the tip.
I have kept very few of the Prittacidce and no Lorikeets, so that I cannot
offer any opinion as to their bigamous tendencies; but perhaps our good friend
Mr. Seth-Smith could enlighten you. It is rather late for nesting this year.

EDITORIAL.
I take my editorial pen for the last time to express my
thanks to all the members for their help and courtesy to me during
the period that I have acted as Editor--a period of four years and
nine months, and I am especially grateful to Dr. Butler for his
valuable co-operation.
I regret that I am yielding up my pen to another, not because
I think for a moment that Dr. Renshaw will not fill my post far more
ably than I have done, but because the members of the Council and
of the Avicultural Society have been very kind in expressing their

regrets that I should do so. This regret is very gratifying, but at
the same time it leaves me with a feeling that I have not really
deserved it and also that my resignation was not justified before
men. It had been my wish and intention to at least hold the reins
until the black calamity of the great war was overpast, but the fact
that peace still seems far away on the horizon gives me little time
for the work, since other labours have come into one's daily life, and
other duties insistently call. I can but once more express my
thanks, with a wish that Dr. Renshaw may be able to steer our ship,
as I feel sure he will, with all success, ever lading it with valuable
cargoes and bringing it happily into port month by month.
