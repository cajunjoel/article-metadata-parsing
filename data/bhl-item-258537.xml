As avicultural subjects, the lories are among the most beautiful and
interesting of all birds. They comprise 11 genera, of which the most dis-
tinctive are, perhaps, the tiny Vini species. Found on islands of the South
Pacific, none has ever been exported on a commercial basis and all are very
rare or unknown in aviculture.
Of the five species, two are unusual in having the plumage blue and
white - the Ultramarine V. ultramarina , which is light blue and exquisitely
patterned, and the Tahiti Blue Lory V. peruviana which is dark violet blue.
The plumage is set off by the white 'bib' and orange-red bill and feet. It
measures 14 cm (SVi In) and weighs 31 g to 34 g, males being heavier.My
measurements are from live birds held in the hand; Forshaw's length of
18 cm is incorrect.
The plumage is identical in male and female except for the white bib
which may be marginally deeper in the male. Males have the head and bill
slightly larger, also the feet, which may be deeper orange than the female's.
Sexual differences are not obvious in some of the young we have reared.
At San Diego Zoo surgical sexing is used to determine sex, the instrument
employed being a 2.7 mm Wolf Laparoscope. The anaesthetic used is 4 mg
of Ketamine which does not induce complete relaxation but is apparently
adequate for the procedure. The birds are not allowed to feed for at least
one hour before surgery. John Mitchell, senior keeper, informed me: 'Tahi-
tians tend to remain sleepy for three to five hours post surgery and are
given supplemental heat during recovery. They stay at the hospital for
48 hours' observation and are then returned to their enclosures.'

A vicultural History
In 1936 Eastham Guild, an American resident on Tahiti, took a number
of Tahiti Blue Lories to England. This would appear to be the first record
of this species in aviculture. The birds were acquired for the Duke of Bed-
ford (Lord Tavistock). After several months most of them died and it was
believed that the diet was at fault. All but one pair of the eight survivors
were then sent to Dr. Derscheid in Belgium. The remaining pair bred on at
least two occasions, despite the vicious behaviour of the male towards the
female. Tavistock (1938) recorded that on the first occasion &amp;apos;about eight
weeks' elapsed from the time of the laying of the eggs to the emergence of
the youngster from the nest. This was incorrect as young speed about nine
weeks in the nest.
At about the same era, in the USA, Mrs. Gilbert Lee also kept this
species and hatched chicks which were not reared.
The captive history of this species would have ended at this point had
it not been for the activities of smugglers in 1977.
Distribution and Status
The Tahiti Blue Lory is found only In the Society Islands, the most
western of the Tuamotu Islands and on Aitutaki in the Cook Islands. On
Tahiti, the principal Society Island, it Is believed to have become extinct
during the early years of the present century. It is rare on all accessible
islands within Its range and apparently is common only on isolated small
atolls in the Tuamotu group.
Forshaw (1978) describes this species as "seriously endangered". This
view is not shared by David Holy oak who studied the birds of French
Polynesia during the 1970s. In his opinion neither this species nor the
Ultramarine "seem imminently threatened." His belief is that the main
long-term threat is "from forest loss" but as these species are not con-
fined to undisturbed forest, "they may survive in gardens" (Holyoak, pers.
comm. 1983).
These contrasting views make one point clear: field work is urgently
needed to establish the status of this very vulnerable species. Its range
has contracted; it was formerly much more widespread in the Society Is-
lands and in the Tuamotu Archipelago. It probably is not endemic to the
Cook Islands but perhaps was introduced there. In 1976 Neville Gare
stated that Tahiti Blue Lories occurred there in gardens near habitation
but were not conspicuous and total numbers appeared to be low (Forshaw,
1978).
Reportedly, it is common only on small atolls, thus nowhere is its
population likely to be large. Forshaw believed that rats were responsible
for its extirpation from Bora Bora; he searched intensively and unsuccess-

fully for it there in 1971 and found rats to be prevalent. These tiny birds
have no chance of survival against rats which nest in palms and other trees
in the tropics. Coconut palms are &amp;apos;the usual nesting site of Blue Lories, thus
rats could be a serious threat to their existence. Other reasons suggested
for their decline and disappearance are the introduction of the Harrier
Circus aemginosus which may or may not have preyed on this species and
the introduction of a mosquito (Culinoides) which is a vector of avian
malaria.
Re-introduction to Aviculture
On 2nd October 1977, Dr. Art Risser, Curator of Ornithology at San
Diego Zoo, met two men who visited the Zoo. One was from Tahiti and
the other from New Caledonia. They said they were interested in acquir-
ing birds and asked to be put in touch with aviculturists in southern Calif-
ornia. Next day Dr. Risser was informed by several aviculturists that the
men were offering pairs of Vini peruviana. Customs agents were notified.
The men were arrested on 7th October, tried on 25th October, found
guilty and sentenced.
Meanwhile, the birds "became entangled in red tape" (Risser, 1979). At
that time birds not quarantined for the minimum 30 days were destroyed.
Because of their rarity, customs officials who legally had custody of the
confiscated birds, sought an exemption to the destruction rule. While their
fate was decided, the birds were in quarantine at San Diego Wild Animal
Park. Their fortunes were followed by thousands of interested bird lovers
and aroused national interest. I still have a file of newspaper cuttings and
copies of letters to senators and various officials who literally pleaded for
their lives.
I received a call from Dr. James Dolan, general curator of San Diego
Wild Animal Park. One way to overcome the problem might be to quaran-
tine them overseas. If this was permitted, would we take them, he asked?
The Ministry of Agriculture responded to the emergency and issued a
licence to import them in record time. (Fortunately, in those days no.
other licence was required.)
Thus it was on a frosty morning in early November that my husband
and I anxiously awaited the arrival of a very precious consignment at
London Airport. We carried the box out into the wintry sunshine and lift-
ed the protective sacking to reveal the most exquisite birds imaginable. My
first reaction was how tiny they were and my second was wonder at the
glossy depth of their midnight blue plumage. No picture can prepare one
for their beauty and animation.
They were placed together in one flight in the quarantine room and
were soon feeding and exploring. It occurred to me how like tits were their

actions and call notes; they have a rasping contact note reminiscent of that
of the Blue Tit Parus caeruleus. I can visualise small groups of them work-
ing their way through coconut palms when feeding, rather like tits moving
through trees in search of insects. Presumably they do not need to move
far in search of food and have no need for rapid and sustained flight.
Forty years previously the Duke of Bedford had recorded sudden and
unexplained losses in his group of Tahiti Blue Lories. Within the next few
weeks we were to have the same problem. Nothing significant could be
found on post mortem. In desperation I spoke to the late John Yealland,
who was curator of the Duke of Bedford's birds when the Blue Lories
(both species) were included in the collection. He told me everything he
could remember but we remained mystified concerning the losses. With
hindsight and several years' experience of breeding these birds which, in
temperament are totally unlike any other lory I have kept, I have little
doubt that the losses were due to stress induced by other birds. Tahiti
Blue Lories can be extremely aggressive. I do not mean that they inflict
physical injuries on each other but they can quite literally stress a com-
panion to death.
A recent occurrence is a typical instance. Two year old birds, siblings,
had lived together in a 6 ft (1.8 m) flight all their lives. Late one evening,
when I turned out the birdroom light and switched on the blue 15 w
nightlight, one was chasing the other. At 6.45 am next morning one bird
was missing. When it appeared from behind the nest-box it was severely
distressed. Guessing that its companion had been chasing it, I immediately
caught up the aggressor and put a heat-lamp above the other. It sat on the
nectar pot with eyes half closed and wings hanging down. I knew that the
next half an hour would be crucial and that it would either lapse into a
coma from which it would never recover, or it would gradually improve.
Fortunately, the latter occurred. This bird had no injuries but had been
frightened almost to death by its companion. I never dared to reunite the
two birds but after one week I introduced an unmated bird into the flight
of the one which had been so near to death. I was surprised and delighted
to find that they were compatible.
Fighting between siblings can occur before they are weaned at 12 weeks
and separation has sometimes been necessary at this early age. On another
occasion, when introducing two young birds, one hand-reared and the
other parent-reared, in a flight which was neutral territory, the hand-reared
bird behaved so aggressively that the two had to be separated after a few
minutes.
The Duke of Bedford recorded of his breeding pair that although the
male was most affectionate towards the female at times, on other occasions
he would turn on her viciously without warning. At San Diego Zoo the

same problem has been experienced. One morning John Mitchell arrived
just in time to rescue the hen from being killed by the male. At the time
the pair were rearing a chick. The female was removed and the male reared
the chick on his own.
In my experience Tahiti Blue Lories can be greatly stressed by removal
to new surroundings, even if only a few feet from the former accommoda-
tion. On-one occasion a pair was moved a few feet from a cage to a flight
in the same birdroom. One turned on the other and gave it a severe beating.
On another occasion four young birds were removed a few feet from small
holding cages to a small planted heated flight. One died within three hours
of being placed inside (no aggressive behaviour had occurred) and another
showed signs of stress and had to be moved back to the cage.
This aspect of keeping and breeding Tahiti Blue Lories is extremely dis-
couraging. Most of our youngsters are hand-reared, and hours of work go
into the rearing of each one. Yet so often a totally healthy bird will die
within minutes as a result of stress from, a situation which would not cause
any other lory to bat an eye.
After the 90-day quarantine period of the original group, arrangements
were made to return them. Within two hours of placing them within their
travelling cage two were dead and a third so severely stressed it never re-
covered. The attempt to return them was, therefore, abandoned. However,
San Diego Zoo already had Tahiti Blue Lories in its collection. A second
group of smuggled birds had been confiscated on 25th January, 1978.
Precedent had been set for exemption from destruction and, after being
quarantined in Honolulu, they went to San Diego Zoo, where they were
placed on exhibit in May of that year.
Meanwhile, we had been left with three birds, two females and one !
male. The male was paired to a female who was in nest feather on arrival,
ie, she was less than six months old. She celebrated her ability to produce
by laying an egg from the perch in May 1979 (just before she was two
years old). The next clutch consisted of two infertile eggs which were in-
cubated by male and female (Low, 1980). A third clutch was laid that year.
When the nest was inspected on 26th November it contained a dead newly
hatched chick and one live chick which was probably one or two days old.
It was removed for hand-rearing.
Since that time the pair has bred continuously. Infertile eggs have been
rare and dead-in-shell unknown. Incubation is shared, as has been men-
tioned, but the male appears to do more than his fair share. The same
applies to the feeding of young chicks.
The incubation period would appear to be 25 days. Eggs measure ap-
proximately 17 mm x 15 mm. Incubation normally starts with the laying
of the first egg. On a single occasion the two chicks hatched four days

apart, instead of the usual two days apart. On one occasion only, both
hatched on the same day. The chick hatched four days after its sibling
would have stood little chance of survival so both were removed for hand-
rearing when the youngest was two days old.
The pair has never reared young beyond the age of four weeks and is
not normally allowed to feed the chicks after they are two weeks old. I
greatly dislike continually removing chicks, thus on two occasions they
were allowed to keep their young. Each time one was killed in the fourth
week so the other chick had to be removed. The risk of loss is too high,
thus chicks are now invariably removed before two weeks. Experience has
taught me that when chicks become noisy they must be removed; when
fed adequately they are quiet. The parents seem to be poor feeders and
the chicks' crops are never bulging.
This is in complete contrast to a sibling pair hatched on 26th and 28th
February, 1982. They are kept in a small planted house, thermostatically
maintained at 65*F (18*C). The first clutch, a single egg, was laid on 11th
February, 1984. It was broken halfway through the incubation period.
The next egg was laid on about 6th April. It hatched on 1st May. It was
exceptionally well-fed and cared for. In this case hand-reared birds proved
to be far superior parents than their wild-caught parents. I would empha-
sise this point because there are still people who believe the myth that
hand-reared birds are useless for breeding purposes.
The reverse is usually true. Being tame and steady they are not stressed
by nest inspection. We usually change the nest litter every week when
lories have chicks. When I removed the chick for this purpose and held it
in my hand, its mother would perch on my hand and preen it or feed it.
The moments when I held two generations of Tahiti Blue Lories in one
hand were unforgettable.
The chick left the nest on 30th June, aged 61 days. It was a joy to see
it with its parents. Within two weeks it could do everything they could do.
A male, it was removed on 9th September and a few weeks later a hand-
reared female, just weaned, was placed with it in a small flight. The two
birds were immediately compatible. The young pair made no further at-
tempt to nest that year.
This is in complete contrast to the imported female who recycles usu-
ally within three weeks, sometimes four. The year from November 1983 is
typical of their breeding activity. Two eggs were laid by 28th November;
one hatched on 22nd December and the chick was removed for hand-feed-
ing on 28th December.
The female laid on 26th and 28th January 1984. The first chick
hatched on 18th February and two chicks were removed for hand-feeding
on 26th February.

There were two eggs by 2nd April, one of which had hatched by the
26th. The chick was removed on 6th May.
The female laid about 25th May. By 24th June two chicks had hatched.
They were removed on 1st July.
Two eggs were laid by 3rd September. A chick seen on 28th September
was about four days old. It was removed on 7th October.
The first egg of the next clutch was laid on 6th November.
Of the seven chicks hatched by the pair in this period, two died during
the weaning period, one is currently six weeks old and the other four were
reared.
Chicks
Newly hatched chicks weigh 2 g or less. They are covered in longish
white down. This is not dense, as in some lories. At 10 days the feather
tracts appear as rows of tiny black dots. The eyes start to slit at about two
weeks but may not be fully open until 18 to 21 days. At five weeks the
wing feathers are erupting and, a few days later, the feathers on top of the
head. As the feathers open, the chick assumes a distinctive appearance,
shared only by (some or all?) Charmosyna lorikeets. The cheeks, lores,
throat and upper breast are bare when the surrounding areas are feathered.
At this stage the narrow, elongated, partly bare head reminds me of a Pes-
quet's Parrot.
Birds in nest feather are very dull coloured. The underparts are the first
area to be covered in feathers and these are dull blue-grey. The upper parts
are dull bluish, brighter blue on the head. There are a few grey or greyish-
white feathers at the side of the beak. The feet and bill are black. The
first white feathers appear at about five months and full adult plumage by
about six months. It takes longer for the feet and beak to take on the
orange-red coloration of the adult.
A spoon - no other implement - is used for feeding chicks of all ages,
including newly hatched ones. A Tahiti Blue Lory of a few hours old,
weighing only 2 g, will feed readily from a spoon. I have never had a young
parrot chick of any species which did not immediately accept spoon-
feeding and would attribute non-acceptance of the spoon, to the food or
both not being hot enough.
Chicks are fed at periods varying from every one and a half hours (for
the first two to three days), every two hours (up to about two weeks),
then every two to two and a half hours. Feeding is carried out between
6.15 a.m. and 11.15 p.m. Chicks up to about eight days receive a 3 a.m.
feed: this is extended to 4 a.m., 5 a.m., and 6 a.m. by the time they are

Crops are never filled grossly and the crop is usually empty for a period
of about half an hour between each feed. It is then quickly apparent if a
chick's crop is not emptying normally - the first indication that something
is wrong.
Newly hatched chicks are kept at a temperature of 92-95*F. This is
gradually reduced until by the time chicks are fully feathered at about
eight weeks old, or earlier in the summer, heat is discontinued.

consists of two types of Heinz tinned baby foods in equal parts: 'Pure

from the nest. This additional protein is to replace the small insects which
I believe these birds would feed to their young, were they available.
Diet
Every day these birds receive 'nectar', sponge cake and nectar, a little
sweet corn (maize) and fruit. The latter includes apple and pear; pome-
granates and grapes are more highly favoured. A little greenfood, such as
spinach and lettuce, is given occasionally. Tiny insects are eaten by birds
in planted enclosures. Mealworms are ignored; presumably they are too
large.
The nectar mixture used is made up fresh two or three times daily as
follows: one heaped dessertspoonful of malt extract is dissolved in boiling
water. Two dessertspoonfuls of glucose or one of honey is added, then
three of a fruit-flavoured Milupa baby cereal. Water is added to give about

35 fl oz (1 litre) of mixture, then about half a dessertspoonful of Fussell's
condensed milk. The condensed milk can be omitted in hot weather.
Some items of food are treated like playthings and are provided mainly
for this purpose. For example, the younger ones react to a small leafy sprig
of celery or a grape by laying on their backs and playing with it held in the
feet.
Playful characteristics
Young birds are especially playful and will be seen every day rolling to-
gether on the floor. A two and a half year old pair still use the flat surface
of the nest-box for this purpose. Almost any small item will be used in
play. They delight in swinging, especially from a twig suspended loosely
from the roof of the flight. They work up a speed as they swing it like a
pendulum.
I have often observed young birds swinging from the wing or foot of
another youngster as it swung from beneath the perch by one foot. The
most favoured preening position of one young male is to hang beneath the
perch by one foot.
Accommodation
Tahiti Blue Lories cannot easily tolerate temperatures below 50*F
(10*C). Even though they are housed indoors permanently, and therefore
protected from the elements, a room heater or infra-red heat lamp (Sala-
mander, with a shatter-proof ceramic element, made by Infrared Inter-
nationale Ltd. of Salisbury, Wilts.) is used when the birds look uncom-
fortable. If they roost in their nest-box a heater at night is not necessary,
but not all my birds use their nest-box for roosting. Nest-boxes measure
about 5 in 2 (13 cm 2 ) and 9 in (23 cm) high.
Given a choice between a bark-covered oblong nest-box and a natural
log, a young hand-reared pair chose the latter. The internal dimensions
were 3 in 2 (8 cm 2 ) and 12 in (31 cm) high. Nesting material consists of
pet litter obtained in compressed packs (Petcraft). The behaviour of the
above-mentioned pair was interesting. When their single chick was about
six weeks old, they ceased to brood it at night and roosted elsewhere, in
the nest-box.
This pair is kept in a small planted house measuring 4 ft 2 (1.2 m 2 ) and
6 ft (1.8 m) high. (This size is adequate for this small species which has a
weak flight.) The house is thermostatically controlled at 65*F (18*C). A
sprinkler system is installed for the benefit of birds and plants. The lories
delight in bathing in a Kentia palm when the sprinkler is turned on. In a
small space they are quite destructive to vegetation, having totally des-
troyed a passion flower vine and severely damaged a Ficus. Nevertheless,

I wish it were possible to keep all of them in this way. They derive such
pleasure from climbing and bathing in the plants and in sliding down ver-
tical stems. Once one has kept small lories in this way, bare, sterile flights
seem totally unsatisfactory.
The pair In the planted house provides more enjoyment than possibly
any other birds in the collection. The house adjoins the kitchen, whose
large window forms one side of their house. Delightfully inquisitive, they
often fly on to the ledge beneath the window to observe what is happening
in the kitchen. If nectar is being made, they demand a share. Like all
lories, they prefer it still warm.
Avicultuml future
In December 1984 two young birds were taken to the Bronx Zoo in
New York. They will join some bred by San Diego Zoo. To safeguard the
future of this exquisite little bird in aviculture, it is vitally important that
other breeding groups are established. Its vulnerability in the wild makes
it imperative that it is established in aviculture.

THE WOODHENS OF LORD HOWE ISLAND

By 1979 the Woodhens Tricholimnas sylvestris, Slater 1869, of Lord
Howe Island were in grave peril. Few of these endemic forest-dwelling
rails remained on their small subtropical oceanic island in the south-west
Pacific and they were obviously on the brink of extinction. However,
much has happened in the last five years and today we can look at the
prospects for survival of Woodhens with much greater confidence.
The Woodhen story has been one of co-operation between research and
management. Research was needed to provide a basic understanding of
their biology. Management had to cope with restoration of habitat and the
urgent need to increase Woodhen numbers.
Research has ranged in many directions. It has involved the study of
all sorts of material held in museum, library and private collections;
labelled specimens, early photographs, paintings, manuscripts and many
published reports. All of these sources had to be carefully examined in
the hope of throwing some new light on the plight of the Woodhen. Much
field work had to be done to determine exactly how many Woodhens
there were and what was their present distribution. Information was
needed urgently on many aspects of the life history of the Woodhen to
define broadly its environmental requirements. We had to establish why
it had declined and determine whether anything could be done to save it.
Management involved the consideration of a captive breeding pro-
gramme. Eventually, this was set up and it achieved great success but, at
the same time, efforts had to be made to remove predators and ensure
that as much as possible of the former habitat of the Woodhen was avail-
able for it to populate, either by release of captive-reared birds, or by a
natural colonisation from what remained of the wild population. But first
a little more about Lord Howe Island, its flora, fauna and history.
Flora , fauna and history of Lord Howe Island
Lord Howe is a volcanic island on a submarine ridge in the North
Tasman Sea at latitude 31*32 South and longitude 159*05 East. This
is about 700 km in an ENE direction from Sydney, New South Wales,
Australia.
The main island is roughly crescent-shaped and about 12 km long
by less than 3 km at its widest (fig. 1). Clustered about it are several
smaller islands and rocky stacks, including a group known as the Admir-

alty Islands, Mutton-bird Island and the spectacular Ball's Pyramid, a
massive rock pinnacle rising sheer to 550 m, about 30 km south of the
main island.
At the northern end of the main island are hills rising to 150 m with
extensive sea cliffs. Much of the centre of the island is low lying, edging
a shallow lagoon and coral reef to the west. The southern half consists of
two imposing mountains, Mt. Lidgbird, 777 m, which has steep sloping
sides and no plateau; and Mt. Gower, 852 m, almost surrounded by verti-
cal cliffs with a summit plateau of 26 hectares. The tops of the moun-
tains are frequently in cloud and are covered by moss forest.
There is no evidence that Lord Howe Island was visited by man until
its discovery in 1788. Since then much has changed (Hindwood, 1940).
No native land mammals occurred on the island but several have been
introduced. Several species of land birds have become extinct. Two nat-
ive land reptiles, a skink Leiolopisma lichenigera and a gecko Phyllo-
dactylus guentheri, are rare; the land fauna of invertebrates has been
greatly reduced, certainly in numbers and, to some extent, in richness of
species (Recher &amp; Clark, 1974a and b). The flora has been modified
considerably (Pickard, 1983).
Human settlement, which has been continuous since 1834, has resul-
ted in extensive clearing of lowland forests; but over much of the island,
especially the mountains, the native vegetation would appear to remain
unaltered. Generally it is dominated by subtropical rain forest, much of
it including one of four endemic palms. However, these forests are prob-
ably much altered in composition and structure as a result of grazing and
foraging by feral populations of pig, goat and the accidentally-introduced
Black Rat. Only the sparse vegetation of the offshore islands is likely to
have remained little changed by man. Today there are about 250 people
resident on Lord Howe Island, augmented by a similar number of tourists
during the height of the summer season. There is an all-weather airstrip
providing easy access by light aircraft.
More than 130 species of birds have been listed for Lord Howe Island
(Fullagar et al, 1974). Many of these are vagrants and today only 28
species are known to breed regularly on the islands. Most indigenous
land birds are now extinct (Table 1). Altogether, a dozen or so species
have been introduced to Lord Howe Island, but only the Masked Owl Tyto
novaehollandiae and the Peewee Grallina cyanoleuca seem to have become
established (Recher, 1974). Masked Owls were deliberately introduced in
the late 1920s, together with several other owls, in the erroneous belief
that they might have some benefit in rat control. A small population of
the Masked Owl has persisted since then and has been a serious predator of
seabirds locally on the main island. At least eight species of land birds have

reached Lord Howe unaided since 1869 and then colonised (Table 2). No
species of breeding seabird is certainly known to have become extinct
during the recorded history of Lord Howe Island. Today, at least 13 spe-
cies of seabird breed on the islands (Table 3).
The Woodhen
The Woodhen is a flightless rail of medium size, having a body weight
of about 450 g. It is of a general olive-brown colour, but the wings are
boldly marked with chestnut and black bars. Woodhens have rather long,
slightly down-curved bills. The New Zealand Weka Gallirallus australis is
larger, but similar in colour in some of its plumage types, but the bill of
the Weka is much stronger and more wedge-shaped (see Fullagar et al,
1982).
From all accounts the Woodhen was once common and distributed over
most of the main island (Hindwood, 1940; van Twets &amp; Fullagar, 1974).
There is no evidence that it ever occurred on any of the offlying islands
and this is not surprising since none of them supports a forest vegetation.
The Woodhen is listed amongst the 21 endangered genera of birds by
the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. The only other
member of the genus, Tricholimnas lafresneyanus of New Caledonia, seems
now to be extinct (Stokes, 1979; Fullagar et al, 1982). It is generally
agreed that the closest living relatives of the Woodhens are the Banded
Landrails Gallirallus philippensis and the Wekas (Ripley, 1977; Fullagar
et al, 1982).
The plight of the Woodhen was not fully appreciated until as recently
as 1969, by which time the remnant population was, for all intents and
purposes, confined to the top of Mt. Gower (A.B.C., 1974); Disney,
1974a &amp; b; Disney &amp; Fullagar, 1981; Fullagar &amp; Disney, 1975). From the
time that Lord Howe Island was discovered it is probable that various
factors have led to a rapid decline in the numbers of Woodhen.
In the early 19th century the island was visited regularly by the crews
of sailing ships calling for food and fresh water. There is little doubt that
they would have taken any Woodhens they could find. The island was
permanently settled from 1834 and by 1853 the Woodhens were recorded
as only inhabiting the mountainous parts. Although small numbers were
known to persist in a few lowland areas well into the present century,
there is no doubt that the decline had been very rapid. With people came
dogs and cats (before 1845), pigs (before 1839), goats (before 1851) and
eventually the Black Rat (in 1918) (Fullagar and Disney, 1975;Recher
&amp; Clark, 1974b; Recher and Ponder, 1981).

P.J. FULLAGAR - LORD HOWE ISLAND WOODHENS
Mt. Gower Study, 1971-1982
An environmental study of Lord Howe Island in 1971 (Recher &amp; Clark,
1974a) led to an intensive study of the biology of the Woodhens remaining
on Mt. Gower. For most of the time nearly all birds were marked. At first
celluloid colour-bands were used to recognise individuals when resighted,
but latterly-we preferred to use the numbered aluminium bands anodised
in various colours. Woodhens are relatively easy to catch. After some
refinements we found that with a little cunning we could shepherd birds
into a short length (10 m) of wader net. We used the upper shelf of a
twin-shelf net. Sometimes the loud territorial or other calls of the Wood-
hen played from a cassette player were helpful in retaining the birds close
to the netting site, but not always. Non-territorial birds often react un-
favourably to replay of Woodhen calls of any kind. However, in certain
circumstances replay may be useful in drawing Woodhens directly into the
net.
Woodhens on Mt. Gower feed on a wide variety of invertebrates includ-
ing molluscs, earthworms, amphipods and isopods (Miller &amp; Kingston,
1980). They always forage with the bill and do not use the feet to dig for
prey in the forest litter.
Woodhen males are larger than females and first year birds are dis-
tinguishable by their pointed primary feathers (Fullagar &amp; Disney, 1981).
Brown eyes are characteristic of young birds, but territory-holding Wood-
hens have bright crimson eyes.
The number of Woodhens on Mt. Gower, including those using the
Little and Thatch Pocket areas below the southern razorback (to be men-
tioned later), has probably remained reasonably steady at 20-25 birds for
some time, perhaps the last 50 years. From our observations this number
would include no more than 8-10 territorial pairs (Disney, 1974a &amp; b;
Disney and Fullagar, 1981; Fullagar &amp; Disney, 1975). Between 1978 and
1981 the number of pairs fell below this level and for some of that time
fewer than six pairs were known to be present. This was further compli-
cated by removal of three pairs in May 1980 to set up the captive breed-
ing colony. By 1982 we reckoned that a reasonable recovery had occurred
when nine pairs were found during a comprehensive survey; and in 1983 at
least seven pairs were known to be present on top of Mt. Gower (not in-
cluding the Pockets).
Annual recruitment of young is often very poor. In most years five or
fewer chicks survive the breeding season and we have strong suspicions
that in some seasons none has been reared. Our best year was 1982/83
when no less than 10 chicks were banded.
At least one male Woodhen has survived for 13 years on Mt. Gower.
Overall, 25% of marked Woodhens are not seen again four months after
banding; 50% disappear within 18 months and 75% before three years.

Half of the chicks banded have not survived to one year old (Disney &amp;
Fullagar, 1981).
Generally, pairs remain together for life and use the same territorial
area of about 2-3 ha throughout that time. This territory is defended by
vigorous territorial calling for much of the year and, if necessary, this is
reinforced by aggressive pursuits in which intruders are driven off merci-
lessly on being detected.
It is clear that most eggs are laid between August and December. How-
ever, very few nests have been found because it is probable that most of
them are concealed down burrows made by Providence Petrels Pterodroma
solandri, which are abundant on Mt. Gower (Fullagar and Disney, 1975).
We have no evidence of broods of more than two and many are singles.
Rarely does it seem to be possible for Woodhens on Mt. Gower to be
double brooded. The season 1982/83 was an exception in that at least
one pair was certainly double brooded.
The juveniles usually remain with the adults until April or May and
they seem to disperse in June and July. The annual moult in adults occurs
after breeding in February and March. It includes the simultaneous moult
of'flight' feathers typical of rails.
Setting up the Woodhen Project
Between 1971 and 1975, all work on the Woodhen was organised by
John Disney, then Curator of Birds at the Australian Museum, Sydney.
Various specialists were involved from time to time, in short but intensive
periods of field work on the island. However, much of the effort expended
during these years was given voluntarily, with the logistic support being
made possible by funds provided by the Lord Howe Island Board, the Aus-
tralian Museum Trustees and the Australian Commonwealth Department
of the Environment. Our studies during these five years led to publicity on
the precarious status of the Woodhen (e.g. A.B.C., 1974). In 1976 we
prepared a submission outlining our views at that time about further work
on the Woodhen and suggesting what might be done to prevent what then
seemed to be its imminent extinction (Disney, 1977; Disney et al, 1976).
In 1978 Dr Ben Miller was appointed by the National Parks and
Wildlife Service, New South Wales, to start a two year full-time study of
the Woodhen, based on our recommendations. Ben Miller was to be resi-
dent on the island and an important part of his study was to be a careful
evaluation of the options for captive breeding and recolonisation. The
work was now being funded as a special project supported by public dona-
tion collected by the National Parks and Wildlife Foundation of New
South Wales.

P.J. FULLAGAR - LORD HOWE ISLAND WOODHENS
Ben Miller was able to corroborate our earlier findings. He checked all
parts of the island for Woodhens and notably some small hanging valleys
or 'pockets' below the southern ridge of Mt.Gower, which had remained
unexplored until that time (see fig. 1). These pockets proved to be the
only significant new localities for Woodhens, but because of their size it
seems that they can support at the most only two pairs (Miller &amp; Mullette,
in prep.).
In Ben Miller's assessment the pig was the major drawback to successful
recolonisation by Woodhens. He initiated work on its eradication and this
was eventually taken up by the Lord Howe Island Board with great suc-
cess. Pigs have almost certainly been brought close to elimination from the
island by a vigorous campaign of shooting with the help of dogs to track
and bail-up the animals.
The Black Rat does not seem to present as serious a problem for
Woodhens as might be supposed. Early reports suggest that Woodhens
were capable rat catchers (see Fullagar et al, 1982) and our own observa-
tions would bear this out. Indeed, rat densities were found to be much
higher on Mt. Gower than anywhere else on the island (Miller &amp; Kingston,
1980).
Cats have been controlled by trapping since 1976, but do not seem
nowadays to stray far from the settlement areas. Possession, breeding and
further importation of cats is now strictly controlled.
It is to be hoped that eventually the Masked Owl will be eradicated; but
so far the necessary effort required to track down and shoot the remaining
population has not been forthcoming. However, some useful reduction in
numbers is being achieved locally in sensitive areas.
A most important contribution by Ben Miller, in collaboration with Dr.
Tim Kingston of the Australian Museum, was a detailed study of soil fauna
throughout the main island. This was done to obtain some idea of the food
resources available in different parts of the island and especially to identify
potential sites for re-introductions of Woodhens where food would not be
a limiting factor.
Captive breeding and relocation of Woodhens
In 1980, following recommendations by Ben Miller, a Captive Breeding
Centre was established on the island and a New Zealand aviculturist,
Glenn Fraser, was appointed with the responsibility of breeding as many
Woodhens as possible for recolonisation by release of the captive-reared
young birds. This centre was located in Steven's Reserve, a lowland forest
area within the Settlement, and consisted of several large closed pens
surrounded by a high cat-proof perimeter fence. Incorporated on the site
were laboratory and food preparation areas and also incubator and rearing

rooms (Fraser, 1983).
By June 1980, three pairs of Woodhen had been established in capti-
vity. These Woodhens had been selected as territory-holding birds in the
wild. Thirteen chicks were reared in the first season and 19 in the second,
by which time the breeding stock had been raised to five pairs. In the third
season a further 34 were reared and 12 more before the captive breeding
programme was wound up in December 1983.
At the foot of Mt. Gower on the south-west side of the island there is a
steep scree, partly stabilised by lowland forest, known as Little Slope (fig.
1). It was clear that this site was particularly suitable for the first attempts
at re-introduction of Woodhens. Ben Miller and Tim Kingston put it thus:
"Little Slope is a particularly attractive prospect for re-introduction.
Apart from the absence of pigs and the availability of a rich food resource,
it is isolated from the rest of the island by a cliffline and is inaccessible to
pigs, goats and dogs.......Feral cats have not been sighted there for 30
years ..The Woodhen was abundant on Little Slope early this century.
Its disappearance was probably due to habitat damage by goats which,
when put there in the late 1920s, multiplied rapidly and seriously reduced
the ground vegetation. In 1955, 300 goats were shot and the population
exterminated. The ground cover is once again thick, especially in the
gullies, and it appears that habitat recovery has been sufficient to permit
re-occupation by the woodhen" (Miller &amp; Kingston, 1980).
The first four captive-bred Woodhens were liberated on Little Slope in
May 1981. A further three were released in December followed by seven
more in February 1982 and a final group of eight birds in June 1982. By
that date the total release of captive-bred Woodhens had reached 22 indi-
viduals (11 males and 11 females). Woodhens proved to be difficult to
locate on Little Slope, but no signs of breeding were evident during the
first 18 months.
Shortly before dark on Friday, 18th February, 1983, John Disney,
Chris Davey and I made up a reconnaissance party which located and
then captured the first two chicks known to have been reared by captive-
reared Woodhens after release back into the wild.
Eventually it was established by us that four pairs of Woodhens were
holding territories on Little Slope, two of which had bred successfully and
for the second pair it was evident that two broods had been reared. Three
other males were holding territories, which in total gave a known survival
to that date of at least half of the Woodhens released in this area.

some excitement, because he was found near Salmon Beach, a lowlands
area at the extreme south end of the settlement (fig. 1). A Woodhen on
the lowlands was exceptional, not to mention the mystery of where he had
come from. However, as time passed he became well established and de-
fended a territory centred on a rambling garden with the ran of adjoining
paddocks, a small reed swamp and some nearby lowland forest. In Novem-
ber 1981 a captive-reared female Woodhen was successfully introduced to
his territory to form a pair. This was achieved despite an earlier failure
with this male when he had been brought into captivity, but had proved to
be too aggressive and was, therefore, released back in his chosen territory.
Dubbed the 'Back Garden Approach', this combination of wild and
captive-reared Woodhens, occupying a garden area and being provided with
supplementary food, began to produce an incredible output of broods.
Nine clutches were laid in the first year and by June 1983 (18 months)
this female had laid her 11th clutch (a total of 29 eggs) from which 16
chicks were reared. Multiple broods were observed in which young birds
from one brood assisted in defence and feeding of chicks of a subsequent

brood (Fraser, in prep.). Woodhens from this source have now established
several territories at the southern end of the lowlands area on the island.
By June 1984 it was becoming difficult to obtain accurate figures on their
numbers. An estimated 10 to 20 pairs were present. Several of them had
been assisted by translocation to favourable sites.
Final liberations
Erskine Valley, between the two mountains, was the next most im-
portant site for liberations after Little Slope, especially with the know-
ledge that Woodhens were spreading well in the settled lowlands. In Ers-
kine Valley the first group of 17 birds was released in January 1983, fol-
lowed by eight more in February and a further nine in June. Some more
birds were liberated at Boat Harbour, east of Mt. Lidgbird and at the 'Goat
House 5 high on the north-eastern side of Mt. Lidgbird. In all, 74 captive-
bred Woodhens were released by the end of 1983 (Table 4).
By June 1984 the number of Woodhens at large on Lord Howe Island
must certainly have exceeded 200 compared with less than 30 only five
years before. It Is still, of course, early days to judge the success of the
project and the next few years are most important if the Woodhen is to
become well-established.

P i. FULLAGAR - LORD HOWE ISLAND WOODMENS
What has it cost and what has been achieved?
Converted to 1984 values the entire field programme, which concen-
trated on the Mt. Gower Woodhen study and involved 15 visits to Lord
Howe Island between 1971 and 1983, cost about 70,000 dollars (Austra-
lian). The Captive Breeding Project, including the two years of full-time
study by Ben Miller, cost the Foundation 268,000 dollars. Some addition-
al costs cannot be assessed accurately as, for example, work done as part
of the Woodhen studies, by Rangers employed by the Board. Control of
goats and pigs has probably cost an additional 20,000 dollars.
If asked why the Woodhens should be conserved, we can no doubt
provide some moral justification based on years of neglect. The avifauna
of Lord Howe Island is also a major biological resource and the Woodhen
could well be a symbol of conservation and enlightened management, if
not for all of Australia, then certainly for Lord Howe Island (Recher,
1981). In conserving the Woodhen it must be accepted that it has not been
a difficult species to manage. It is flightless, confiding and can be observed
readily in the wild even though it so often chooses to live in the densest of
vegetation. Captive breeding has been rewarding, and this critical part of
the project has run without serious complications. Success in captive
breeding must be attributed to good planning, close attention to detail and
above all the exceptional skill and patience of Glenn Fraser. The gradual
build-up in our knowledge about the Woodhen has meant that a logical
plan of action has been possible at each step.
One of the most striking features of the study has been the clear
demonstration that the residual population of Woodhens on Mt. Gower
survived in desperately marginal habitat. Endangered species should not
necessarily be assumed to occupy remnant prime habitat. Mt. Gower was
free of a critical predator, but ecologically the population was delicately
balanced with little room for error. Mt. Gower could not support a very
large population and the capacity for increase was severely restricted for
those birds that did manage to hold territories. It is remarkable that a
small population persisted at this site for so long - probably 50 years.
In contrast, Woodhens on the lowlands show much greater rates of
increase and reveal social behaviours within the breeding groups that are
more or less impossible for Mt. Gower Woodhens Too much attention to
detail on Mt. Gower might have led to concepts about behaviour and
population dynamics that would be irrelevant for an understanding of
Woodhens on the lowlands.
Captive-bred Woodhens have been re-introduced successfully into
their natural environment, have survived and have been shown to breed
and rear young. I believe there is no other example of this course of
action yet demonstrated in the conservation of any species of endangered
bird.

BREEDING LEAR'S MACAW
Anodorhynchus leari
AT THE BUSCH GARDENS (Tampa, Florida)
By ED BISH (Curator of Psittacines)

The first hatching of a Lear's or Indigo Macaw occurred at Busch Gar-
dens in July 1982. The Lear's Macaw is very similar in appearance to the
Hyacinth but smaller in size and greenish-blue in plumage. This species was
known only from captive birds which reached collectors and zoos in the
mid-19th century. It is kept in fewer than half a dozen collections outside
its native Brazil and had never previously nested in captivity.
The male of the Busch Gardens pair was on breeding loan from another
well-known Florida collection, Parrot Jungle in Miami. On the same day it
hatched, the chick was taken to Miami, where it was successfully hand-
reared by Mr. and Mrs. Jerome Scherr, owners of Parrot Jungle.
On 22nd September, 1982, a second chick was hatched at Busch Gar-
dens, and it was being reared by the parents but did not survive. Two
chicks were hatched in 1983, but did not survive. This year, the first
clutch of three eggs was infertile. Two chicks hatched from the second
clutch of three eggs on 27th and 29th June and are now being hand-reared
by Mr. and Mrs. Scherr.
The birds which make up our breeding pair are quite old, the male
having been in the Parrot Jungle collection for over 25 years, and the
female in the Busch Gardens collection for over 20 years.

At Busch Gardens they are housed in a cage measuring 3 ft (0,92 m) sq
and 7 ft (2.14m) high. The nesting area is behind a concrete block wall,
with an opening large enough for a macaw to enter the nesting area, which
measures 3 ft sq. and 4 ft (1.22m) high. The nesting facilities inside the
nesting area consist of two metal wash tubs, wired together at their open
end, with a small opening cut in the top tub. Wood shavings are used for
nesting material. The tubs and nesting area are thoroughly cleaned and
disinfected twice a year, and all precautions are taken to insure a healthy
environment for this pair of birds. They have been laying three to four
clutches of eggs every year, so quite a lot of time is spent in the nesting
area.
Their diet consists of peanuts, sunflower seed, safflower seed, small
dog biscuits, wheat germ oil, carrots, celery, Chinese cabbage, apples, beets
and vitamins.
Breeding Lear&amp;apos;s Macaw is a most notable achievement as this species
is the rarest and most endangered of all parrots. It has often been des-
cribed as one of the greatest mysteries in South American ornithology
for, until 1978, all that was known about it was that it came from Brazil.
The location of this species had never been found in the wild by natural-
ists, although it was thought to exist in north-eastern Brazil, in the state
of Bahia. Then in 1978, Helmut Sick, a Brazilian ornithologist, discovered
the Lear's Macaw in an inaccessible wilderness area on the Bahia plateau,
previously thought to be an unlikely habitat for any macaw species. A
flock of 20 birds was seen, but the range of this species is apparently very
limited and the total population small It Is a fortunate coincidence that
part of this Macaw's habitat lies within a reserve.
For many years this species was thought to be a hybrid of the
Hyacinth A. hyacinthinm and the Glaucous Macaw A. glaucus , but this
theory has now been discounted since the discovery of a viable wild
population which is ecologically isolated from the other two species.
Concern has already been expressed that collectors and dealers might seek
out these birds due to their enormous commercial value, and measures
are now being taken to protect this area.
Meanwhile, breeding Lear's Macaw in captivity is of very great impor-
tance. At this time, there are not many Lear's Macaws in captivity - two in
Brazil, one in England, one in Paris, and two in the United States other
than the breeding pair at Busch Gardens.

Drepanoptila holosericea
By Dr. HENRY QUINQUE
(Bondy, France)
The Cloven-feathered Dove is fascinating for its exceptional beauty, its
secretive habits and the almost complete ignorance that has prevailed
about its way of life and breeding behaviour.
It was first described in 1811 by Temminck and represented in Plate 32
of his sumptuous monograph Les Pigeons, which was brilliantly illustrated
by Pauline de Courcelles, Madame Knip. It was therein given also the amu-
sing popular name of 'Vlouvlou'.
The scientific name aptly expresses its two principal morphological
characters: the divided ends of the wing feathers and its overall silky ap-
pearance.
It is a fruit-eating pigeon of the family Treronidae, endemic to the island
of New Caledonia and the unique species of its genus.
Although in theory completely protected by the law, its insular habitat
renders its survival in the long term unlikely, and its extinction would be a
grievous loss. To preserve it, captive breeding is an essential supplement to
its protection in the wild.
Dr Jean Delacour's excellent Guide to the Birds of New Caledonia (in
French) has been widely read on the island and has had a decisive influence
in making the public aware of this exceptional and fragile jewel which has
been entrusted to their care and which they must preserve for posterity.
I am constantly asked for this book, which is now scarce and a reprint is
urgently required.
It has been my good fortune to achieve repeated success in breeding the
Cloven-feathered Dove in captivity and I wish to lay before you my exper-
iences. The account of the bird in the wild which I shall give is, for the
main part, due to information supplied to me by Monsieur H. Bregulla,
a very competent ornithologist whose speciality is the Pacific avifauna.
Description
The genus Drepanoptila can be defined by the following three special
characters:
1) The crest formed by the dense silky green feathers of the forehead
making a rounded bulge which gives the head a typically elongated
profile.
2) The primary feathers of the wings, shaped like an italic 'S' are divi-

ded at the ends, a feature unique among birds. The posterior part of
the division is rounded, but the anterior part is very slender, sickle-
shaped and forming a hook at the tip. This unique formation produces
a peculiar musical whistle at each beat of the wings.
3) The silvery dorsal bars - the back is marked by transverse bars on the
wings and the tail. These vague and misty marks are like a fine silver
powder sprinkled over the green of the plumage. The minute grains
resemble the scales of butterfly wings and give the impression that if
touched they would stick to the fingers, or if blown upon they would
fly away. They seem like a deposit on the feathers, an impression
heightened by the fact that their shade is not uniform but deeper at
the middle than at the edges of the bars.
The adult male is a magnificent bird, fairly large, well-formed and
powerful without being bulky. The average length is 32 cm (\2Vi in) and
the weight 220 g (7% oz). The head, neck, breast, back and thighs are a
brilliant emerald green with gold reflections, varying according to the
incidence of the light. An elongated pure white stripe extends from the
base of the bill and tapers to a point in the centre of the breast.
The eye is reddish-brown, the bill small and thin, bluish-green at the
base and black at the tip.
The belly is yellow with green reflections and the under-tail coverts,
which are as long as the 14 tail feathers, are golden yellow. The division
between the emerald green of the breast and the yellow of the lower
parts is clearly marked by two regular upward curving semicircles. The
pure white line of the upper semicircle is emphasised by the pure black
semicircle, twice as wide, below it.
The feet are dark red, large and powerful, the toes enlarged by exten-
sions of the skin below. They are partly concealed by wide silky tufts
which completely cover the tarsi.
The adult female is smaller, less brilliant and much more slender than
the male. Its length averages 28 cm (11 in) and its weight 160 g (just over
5 Vz oz). It has all the characteristics of the male but in a lesser and duller
form, although the prevailing green is also very beautiful. The belly is
greenish, thinly spotted with yellow; the yellow of the under-tail coverts is
much less brilliant. The semi-circles of the breast occur in some females
but are indistinct, in others they are practically absent. The tips of the
flight feathers and the bill are black.
Behaviour

nervous and very sensitive to its environment. During the period of accli-
matisation I kept several pairs without any problems for several months in
a small tropical house of 10 yd^ (9.10 nr*). Serious problems began with
efforts to isolate the pairs. Each time that a pair was put in an aviary by
itself it refused all food. Curiously, the birds remaining in the group be-
haved in the same way. After several attempts we were obliged to put the
birds back together. They then began to eat immediately.
When the pairs were finally separated for breeding, we suffered the loss
of one female, which was killed almost immediately by the male. This
period was a severe trial from which we drew the conclusion that this bird
is sedentary, sensitive to its social environment, and that it is essential to
respect the compatability of pairs.
Habitat
The Green Pigeon, which is its local name, is strictly endemic to the
island of New Caledonia.
Although never numerous, it is found in those parts of the island where
there are humid forests or groves which provide the fruits on which it
feeds. A friend informed me that he had found several individuals in an
abandoned coffee plantation.
Silent when feeding, it is practically invisible when motionless in the
foliage. Only a very keen ear can detect the peculiar whistling of the wings
as it moves from one branch to another. It always perches as high as pos-
sible when feeding and only descends to the lower branches when the
fruits above are exhausted. When it drinks it is seldom on the ground but
almost always perched on a low branch overhanging the water. Although a
number of birds come together to feed, they are not gregarious and the
pairs separate when they have fed. The bird is sedentary but groups move
to different localities determined by the availability of ripened fruit. In
captivity they never bathe or dust themselves.
Food
Like the Ptilopidae, they are fruit-eaters and are especially attracted by
fruits of the fig family. These fruits when ripe are frequently parasitised by
insects and their eggs and larvae, which provide an indirect supplement of
animal protein to the diet.
In captivity, a balanced diet is essential to keep the bird in good health
and prevent too much gain in weight as well as the production of infertile
eggs. We give fruit cut in pieces, which are swallowed whole, even when
quite large - grapes or raisins, apples, pears, currants, blueberries and wild
berries such as those of cotoneaster and hawthorn.Cubes of tomato and
boiled carrot are much appreciated. In the aviaries pieces of leaf and buds

are often eaten. However, an addition of protein is essential, and we use a
softbill mixture spread on the fruit. It is thanks to this mixture that we
obtained our first fertile eggs but the paste is never accepted on its own
and must be mixed with fruit. Insects are always refused.
Breeding
Breeding is only possible from a pair which is perfectly compatible,
otherwise the life of the female is at risk or the male completely indif-
ferent. Pairs have been kept in two sorts of accommodation: either in a
large parrot aviary with a heated shelter of 10 yd 3 (9.10 rn 3 ) and access to
an. external wire mesh enclosure 13 yd (11.83 m) in length. One corridor
gives access to the shelter and there is another on the outside; alternatively
we use a humid tropical house of 10 yd 3 (9.10 rn &amp;apos; ^ without access to the
open air. The latter system seems best to avoid accidents, because where
there is access to the open air a bird can panic at the appearance of an owl
or rat and kill itself against the wire mesh. The nests we offer are of three
kinds: either a box with a wooden base or a mesh base, or a wicker basket
15 cm (6 in) in diameter and 5 cm (2 in) deep.
The baskets are usually chosen provided that they contain a few twigs
and are hidden in the foliage.
Song
Normally sparing in voice, the Cloven-feathered Dove becomes noisy in
courtship. In any case the song cannot be confused with that of any other
species.
The underlying theme of the male's song is a plaintive wavering sound,
something like a ship's siren heard through the fog, but it can be imitated
by the human voice with a disyllabic whoo-oo , of which the first syllable is
long, deep and vibrant and the second, short, much higher and decrescendo.
The first syllable lasts for two or three seconds and the other for only a
fraction of a second. The musical phrase contains five themes (rarely four)
at intervals of five or six seconds. The repetition of this phrase of five
themes constitutes the song which may last for three to five minutes.
During the song the bird is normally perched in a resting position, the beak
is closed and only a slight rhythmic swelling of the throat is to be seen.
This normal song is especially heard in the morning and evening, but
some birds perform it only rarely. At the time of courtship it is another
matter. Though the melody of the song is identical, its tone is much
deeper and its strength much greater, so that it can be heard at a distance
of 200 yd (182 m).
For a period of eight to ten days the male sings for sessions of half
an hour to an hour long, sometimes repeated during the day, sometimes

even at the beginning of the night.
The attitude of the bird is then surprising: clutching tightly to the
perch, it appears from the front to have the shape of the heart on a play-
ing card. The head is no longer visible, pressed right down on the breast
by a complete bending of the neck. The beak is in the area of the black
and white semicircles. Only a slight movement of expansion of the body
accompanies each theme of the song. During the first two or three days
the male appears to sing only for himself, sometimes at a considerable
distance from the female, who remains indifferent.
Towards the third or fourth day, she comes very close to the male and,
beside him on the same branch, makes rapid jerky movements. Almost
at once the male begins to move in the same way, but for the purpose of
choosing a nest. He inspects and explores all of the branches that are
available several times a day. Then he perches on the edge of the nest he
has chosen or on a neighbouring branch.
I have noticed a curious action for which I have at present no explana-
tion, but it is regular. For two or three days before the laying of the eggs
the male descends to the ground on several occasions and remains there
for quite a long time.
The association of the special courting song and the descent of the male
to the ground are two signs which confirm that the eggs are about to be
laid. The femaie then settles on the nest and the male's song ceases.

The Egg
Since Layard's paper in 1882, it has been thought that the clutch con-

sisted of two eggs, in contrast to other species of Treronidae.
We can confirm that this is untrue, and in this case at least our extra-
ordinary pigeon conforms with the other members of its family in laying
only a single egg.
Indeed, before arriving at suitable accommodation and food for our
birds, we obtained about 30 eggs, all infertile or broken. In each case the
clutch consisted of a single egg which is white and very elongated, averag-
ing 36.5 x 25.5 mm in size and 12 g in weight
Incubation
Incubation takes 21 days. During this period the female only leaves the
nest for a few minutes three or four times a day to defecate and rapidly
consume a large quantity of food.
The male never takes part in the incubation, but keeps very close to
the nest to protect it while the female is away.
If the egg is infertile or damaged, a replacement is laid, generally within
three weeks, the shortest delay recorded being 10 days. If a young is

reared, the next egg is laid about two months after it becomes independent.
The Young
Twenty-one days after the egg is laid, the two halves of the shell are to
be found on the ground as far away as possible from the nest. The female
stays on the nest without feeding for the first 24 hours.
The newly-hatched chick is tiny and covered with silky white down. Its
skin is greyish pink. The eyes, which are closed, open on the fifth day, and
are black. The feet are pink; the bill soft and bluish, swollen at the tip
which is black. Both eyes and feet appear at this stage abnormally large.
We were extremely surprised by the rapid growth of feathers. While the
chick is still very small, green wing and tail feathers appear. By the 13th
day it perches on the rim of the nest, completely covered with feathers,
except on the crown of the head, where they are sparse and downy, and in
the area of the sternum. The general colour of the body is already a
beautiful grass green, clearly separated from the abdomen which is mouse
grey. The under-tail coverts are already yellow.
The upper parts have a peculiar characteristic. Many of the green feath-
ers of the neck and back are edged with yellow. Three continuous scal-
loped bars of beautiful golden yellow extend across the back at the places
where the silver bars will later appear. Similarly green feathers edged with
yellow are, in fact, found in small numbers on the back of the thighs of
the adult.
On the 14th day the young bird leaves the nest, but flies badly, hence
the importance of the protective mesh below the nest.
On the 21st day the young bird flies off, with vigour and confidence
and does not return to the nest. It does not produce in flight the charac-
teristic whistling of its parents. The swollen appearance of the forehead is
already visible as well as the white stripe on the throat. Its size is about
half that of the female. It does not feed itself until the 25th day, but the
mother continues to feed it until the end of the fifth week. The male takes
no part in feeding the young. The female, after feeding herself, perches
on the rim of the nest while the young cheeps softly. It puts its beak into
its mother's beak to make her regurgitate. The young flutters its wings
while the mother spreads hers, letting them droop at the moment of
regurgitation.
Though the male does not seem to take any part in rearing the young,
it is clear that lie takes an interest in everything and that his role is
essentially that of guardian. He stays continually in the neighbourhood of
the nest and follows the young at a distance of a few feet when it begins
to move about in the branches. At such a time the normally timid male
is not likely to retreat when the door of the aviary is opened, but to spread

his wings in a threatening attitude while emitting a muffled monosyllabic
whoo.
The female, when disturbed, can make a sound of the same kind, scarcely
audible beyond a distance of four or five yards.
Unfortunately this idyllic period does not last, and without warning the
protective father can brutally attack his young and kill it in a few minutes.
For this reason, we remove the young pigeon on the 21st day and keep
it in a small cage to be fed by hand. When it is able to feed itself on the
25th day, we move it to a cage 2 yd (1.83 m) long where it can fly. Birds
reared in this way are calm and trusting.
From the third month the sexes are distinguishable by the appearance
in the male of the golden yellow under-tail coverts and the first appearance
of the two semicircles on the breast. They begin to appear near the wings
and extend gradually inwards to join at the centre of the body. At three
and a half months, the female attains her final size, while the male con-
tinues to grow until six months.
At nine months the silver dust seems to settle gradually on the wings.
At one year the male assumes his complete adult plumage with the
unique branching of the tips of the primaries; at the same age these appear
also in the female.
The Moult
The moulting of the Cloven-feathered Dove is something of a mystery.
There is no post-juvenile moult. The feathers gradually change their tex-
ture and colour without being shed.
In the adult, we have noticed a more marked shedding of feathers in
June and July. For the remainder of the year we find, from time to time,
a single feather on the ground, so that the sexual activity of these birds is
uninterrupted and makes possible three broods in one year.

Young reared in captivity are as brilliant in plumage and as robust as
their parents. Some males are even larger.
At the time of writing, we have established second generation pairs
which are perfectly compatible, and one of the males has begun a court-
ing song.
Among accidents suffered by the young, we have had a dislocation of
the hips, complicated later by a nodular arthritis involving salmonella. We
believe this was because the base of the nest was too smooth. One chick
was crushed on the fourth day by the mother panicking when the door of
the aviary was roughly thrown open. It is, therefore, essential to warn the
birds before opening the aviary. A third bird was lost through our mistake
in leaving it in the cage too long before releasing it into the aviary.

Although this wonderful species is completely protected in New Cale-
donia, it is under a serious threat of extinction.
Its principal enemy is still man, who stupidly kills this remarkable bird
for the sake of a few ounces of meat.
It is also the victim of animal predators such as the Sparrow Hawk
Accipiter haplochrous and rats and feral cats. Forest fires, which are often
extensive and beyond control, destroy nests and young. Finally, the pro-
gressive felling of the forests aggravates a situation that does not encourage
optimism. To deal with these threats, there have arisen two opposing atti-
tudes among conservationists on the island. Some pig-headed conserva-
tionists vigorously oppose any taking of birds from the wild, mainly on the
grounds that there is no hope of breeding this species in captivity. In fact,
so far as we know, not a single Drepanoptila has ever been reared in cap-
tivity in New Caledonia. Fortunately there are a small number of more
enlightened people who understand that the only real chances of survival
for this species lie in serious study of the bird in captivity leading to
attempts at breeding.
Special acknowledgement is due to the heads of the Department of
Water and Forests, led by Monsieur Cherrier, and the Noumea Forest Park,
which has been developed by the efforts of Monsieur J. Begaud, an en-
lightened aviculturist, and Monsieur H. Bregulla. These gentlemen have
untiringly resisted the fierce attacks of their opponents and carried on
their work amid difficulties only matched by their selfless determination.
Thanks to their efforts a limited programme of taking birds from the
wild has been carried out under proper controls. I have had the honour of
benefitting from this, thanks to the quality of my establishment and my
long experience in aviculture, and so the Government of New Caledonia
entrusted to my care a group of birds, officially and without charge.
During the course of my life I have reared many rare or difficult species of
birds, but a very few of my successes have given me as much satisfaction
as that of contributing towards the survival of the Cloven-feathered Dove.
I hope that my great friend, Dr. Jean Delacour, the President of the Avi-
cultural Society, will allow me to dedicate to him this successful breeding
programme as a token of my affectionate regard.
However, the achievement is not final and continual efforts must be
made. There is always the possibility that the 14 birds so far reared could
suffer an accident which would put the whole scheme in jeopardy. Yet we
have gained valuable new experience, and above all have proved that the
Cloven-feathered Dove can be reared in captivity, even in our climate. This
encourages a hope for the future of this wonderful bird.

Postscript
Unfortunately the Cloven-feathered Dove is not the only threatened
bird in New Caledonia, and I have been occupied for several years in the
breeding of other species in danger of extinction which belong to this
zoologically isolated island.
I have reared another pigeon, very beautiful and imposing as well as
interesting for being endemic and never bred in captivity in New Cale-
donia. It has been gradually decimated by intensive hunting. The White-
throated Pigeon Columba vitiensis hypoenochroa is a seedeater. It lays
only one egg, like Drepanoptila, but frequently lays on the ground. On the
other hand, both parents share equally in the incubation and rearing of the
young, which is pure black, speckled with abundant gold down. We intend
to publish our observations in due course, showing that this species also
can be saved by aviculture.
The Horned Parrot Eunymphicus c. cornutus is a magnificent bird with
a supple crest 2 in (5 cm) long, formed by two spatulate feathers of vermi-
lion red. Its young, sometimes reared in burrows in the ground, are insecti-
vorous during the first two weeks of their life, and have on the head a re-
markable round white spot, which disappears by the end of the third week.
A related form, even rarer, inhabits the island of Ouvea in the Loyalty
Island group. This very beautiful and extremely rare Ouvea Parrot E.c.
uvaensis has a crown composed of six rigid green feathers curved forward.
I published a detailed account of the breeding of these birds in the Avi-
cultural Magazine (1980). It brought me some violent reproaches, when I
was naive enough to expect only encouragement.
It is only by constant efforts that we can reach success in these ven-
tures, which only recently would have appeared impossible. Threatened
species are as precious as the ancient manuscripts and historical monu-
ments left by our ancestors. We are their trustees for future generations
and for this it is well worth making sacrifices.

GENETIC AND DEMOGRAPHIC MANAGEMENT OF
CAPTIVE RED-CROWNED CRANES Grus japonensis

(Aviculturist, International Crane Foundation, Baraboo, Wisconsin, USA)
The Red-crowned (Manchurian) Crane is an endangered species that has
only become well established in captivity within the last decade. The wild
population is approximately 1,000, consisting of: 350 on Hokkaido, Japan
(von Treuenfels, 1984), roughly 500 breeding in north-eastern China (Yi-
ching and Long-rong, in press), and about 200 breeding in the eastern
USSR (Shibaev, 1982). Both the USSR and China have established nature
preserves within the Red-crowned Crane's breeding range, so we can begin
to consider restocking the mainland Asia population if it continues to dec-
line. Maintaining a genetically diverse captive population is, therefore, an
important part of the conservation programme for this beautiful bird.
Although the Red-crowned Crane has a long history in captivity, few
zoos had consistently bred it until the late 1970s. The establishment of
the Red-crowned Crane Studbook by Dr. Shigeharu Asakura of the Tokyo
Ueno Zoo in 1973 created an increased awareness of the need to breed this
species.

Prior to 1975 deaths among captive Red-crowned Cranes exceeded the
number bred, so wild birds were continually needed to keep the popula-
tion stable. The captive population began to increase in 1975 due to
improved breeding success, and it has grown in every year since then
(Table 1). Excluding emigrations to, and immigrations from, the popula-
tion, the number of captive Red-crowned Cranes grows annually by about
7.5%.
There are approximately 120 registered Red-crowned Cranes in cap-
tivity, but a number of zoos have not registered their birds. The total
captive population is probably about 160.

Although the Red-crowned Crane is increasing its number in captivity,
the population is plagued by a low genetic diversity. Most of the chicks
hatched during the last 15 years were produced by only three males and
four females. This swamping of the gene pool by a few individuals has
caused the effective population size to be less than one-half that of a
similar population where the offspring are distributed randomly among
the breeding pairs (Swengel, in press). The optimal distribution of off-
spring is one in which each pair has the same number of progeny.
Only half of the 55-60 genetically unrelated lines of Red-crowned
Cranes in captivity have bred. If zoos were to co-operate and breed each
pair equally, by allowing them to have only three to four offspring, the
genetic diversity within the population would increase dramatically.
The disproportionate number of progeny produced by a few pairs
has also made inbreeding more difficult to avoid. Most breeding centres
have only one breeding pair, so all the offspring produced at these sites
will be inter-related. In order to avoid inbreeding, these zoos must trans-
fer some of their captive-bred birds to other places and/or acquire mates
for those that remain.
The International Crane Foundation (ICF) has sent six Red-crowned
Cranes to Walsrode Bird Park, Germany, three to Tokyo Zoo, Japan,
and one to San Diego Zoo, USA, during the past two years because the
birds were all related. These zoos are locating unrelated mates for the
cranes they have received. Several other breeding centres have made
exchanges of Red-crowned Cranes in recent years.
Inbreeding probably decreases the fertility and hatchability rates of
Red-crowned Crane eggs. Inbreeding does not inherently lower the gene-
tic variability within a population. However, inbreeding does decrease
the genetic diversity in a population when it slows the population's
growth rate, as it appears to do in Red-crowned Cranes. For this reason,
Red-crowned Cranes should not be inbred. I have proposed a mating

scheme that minimises inbreeding in captive Red-crowned Cranes
(Swengel, in press).
Table 2 shows that, over the period 1976-1981, the fertility and
hatchability rates of inbred matings were much lower than those of
non-inbred matings. These data are not statistically significant because of
the small sample of fertile eggs from inbred matings (Oliver Ryder, pers.
comm.), but they show that, during the period sampled, non-inbred
matings produced one hatch per 3.0 eggs while inbred matings produced
only one hatch per 9.0 eggs.
The latest Studbook for Red-crowned Cranes (Asakura and Ito, 1983)
shows that five of the 17 pairs that had eggs were inbreeding and that
nine of the approximately 30 pairs in captivity are composed of related
birds.
Since several pairs of Red-crowned Cranes have already produced
eight to 30 offspring, the future breeding of their progeny needs to be
limited. In this way we could limit the number of descendants of these
overproductive pairs so that the pairs with few offspring could even-
tually equal them in reproductive success. The breeding centres should
concentrate on breeding those genetic lines that are under-represented
in the population. The variation in the number of offspring among the
pairs has a large effect on the genetic diversity of populations (Dennis-
ton, 1977).

Demographic Management

Several endangered species, such as the Siberian Tiger, have captive
populations that exceed the space that zoos are either able or willing
to allot to these species. This will soon be true for the Red-crowned
Crane unless we agree on a demographic plan for this species. A demo-
graphic plan prescribes a desired age and/or sex distribution for a popu-
lation and strives to maintain an optimum population size.
Before captive Red-crowned Cranes exceed their optimum popula-
tion, or K, the Carrying Capacity, we need to solve the population's
genetic problems. Otherwise, needless effort will be expended to pro-
duce chicks that are genetic liabilities to the population. We can accom-
plish this by slowing the population's growth long before it reaches K.
Genetically expendable birds could be used for display at zoos that do
not breed Red-crowned Cranes.
In captivity, a newly hatched Red-crowned Crane chick has a 70%
chance of surviving one year and a one year-old crane has a 91.5% chance
of living to age two. After that, the annual survivorship rate is nearly
constant at about 95% (Fig. 1). Such high survivorship allows the cap-
tive population to grow despite its low reproductive rate.

An annual reproductive rate of only 8.54 chicks hatched per 100
adults (four or more years old) is enough to maintain a constant pop-
ulation for captive Red-crowned Cranes when the age structure of the
population is stable. The growing captive population has an annual
reproductive rate of 31 chicks per 100 adults. The population also has
an expanding age structure, with many individuals in the youngest age
classes and relatively few in the older ones (Fig. 2).
Fig. 2 compares the age structure of captive Red-crowned Cranes to
those of three hypothetical populations: 1. a stable age distribution -
one whose age structure remains unchanged from year to year as long
as the population does not change; 2. the projected age distribution of
the present population 15 years from now; and 3. the age distribution
of the population in 15 years if its productivity were stabilised to 8.54
chicks per 100 adults per year.
If the present population were adjusted to 100 individuals, its
population would rise to 374 in 15 years and it would still have an ex-
panding age structure (many young individuals). If the population were
limited to an annual productivity of 8.54 chicks per 100 adults, the
population and age structure would become stable within about 15
years. This population numbers 104 and its age distribution is nearly
stable (Fig. 2).
The survivorship data show that, to maintain a constant population
size, pairs must average 3.4 offspring during their lifetimes. The op-
timum number of chicks per pair is, therefore, three to four.
Summary
The Red-crowned Crane is an endangered species that has only re-
cently begun to breed well in captivity. The captive population grows
7.5% per year and numbers about 160. The genetic diversity of the pop-
ulation is severely depressed because a very few breeders have produced
most of the offspring. This has also made inbreeding more difficult to
avoid. The genetic diversity could be greatly increased by concentrating
on breeding the genetic lines that are under-represented in captivity and
by limiting the productivity of the offspring of the most prolific breeders.
A demographic plan would benefit captive Red-crowned Cranes by
stabilising the population at its optimum level. Its high survivorship
enables this species to maintain a stable population with an annual re-
productive rate of only 8.54 chicks per 100 adults. This rate would sta-
bilise the currently growing population, and its age structure, in about
15 years. The population may soon exceed the space allotted to it if we
do not limit its growth rate. In a stable population, pairs of captive Red-

so three to four progeny is the optimum number for maximising the

The National Wildlife Centre (as we are now known) is a government
funded institution established in 1962 and operated by the New Zealand
Wildlife Service with the prime objective of holding and breeding in cap-
tivity endangered species of native birds. The ultimate aim of this opera-
tion is to provide birds to boost dwindling wild populations or for estab-
lishing new wild populations in other areas. For some species these goals
are unattainable and it is far more effective to rely on other conservation
methods, i.e. transfers from island to island, as with the Saddleback Phile-
sturnus carunculatus and the Stitchbird Notiomystis cincta , or egg transfer
and cross fostering within an existing population, as with the Chatham
Island Black Robin Petroica traversi.
In addition to its conservation role, the centre also provides for wildlife
research and education. In recent years the centre's responsibilities have
been extended to include native reptiles, bats and frogs.
The following species of threatened or endangered native birds are
either currently held or have been held in the past at the National Wildlife
Centre.

LITTLE SPOTTED KIWI Apteryx owenl
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999306285714286" page_id="56953512"  page_num="48" year="" vol="">
Status: None currently held here although birds were at the centre
until 1979.
Suitability: As with all species of kiwi, these birds adapt well to cap-
tivity and have been successfully bred.
Potential: Good, although in the short term translocation of wild-
caught birds appears to be the best conservation option.
Formerly widespread in both the North and South Islands, the Little
Spotted Kiwi was, until recently, thought to be confined to the west coast
of the South Island and to Kapiti Island where a small number of birds was
released around 1900. However, recent surveys have shown that the Kapiti
Island population of around 500-600 birds may be all that remains. Why
this species should have disappeared from the mainland (where other spe-
cies of kiwi remain) and yet has flourished on Kapiti Island is uncertain
although it is possibly because of the bird's small size and inability to cope

In 1983 several birds were moved to another island in an effort to es-

Status: Four males and one female are currently held.
Suitability: As for A oweni.
Potential: Very good although not a priority species.
Still fairly common (although localised) in the North Island, this sub-
species of Brown Kiwi has had a chequered career. Although suffering
from the onslaught of introduced predators (Mustelids, pigs, etc.), drastic
habitat modification, and possum trapping, the Kiwi is now re-establishing
itself in some areas where predator numbers have been reduced as well as
colonising rough farm land and exotic pine forests as opposed to the trad-
itional habitat of native bush.

Status: Two pairs are currently held.
Suitability: Although adapting well to captivity, this species has yet
to be successfully bred.
Potential: As for A a. mantelli
Fairly abundant in western and north-western areas of the South
Island, this species does not seem to have suffered greatly from human
settlement of New Zealand and, in fact, appears to be extending its range.
BROWN Anas aucklandica chlorotis
Status: Ten breeding pairs.
Suitability: As with most waterfowl, this species is well suited to cap-
tivity and breeds well. Up to 60 young birds are available for release
annually into suitable coastal lagoons.
Potential: Because this species breeds so well it can be classified as
'self-sustaining' in captivity.
The current wild population (discounting those liberated around the
country) numbers no more than 1500 and is confined mainly to Great
Barrier Island and Northland. Once common on both main islands of New

CAMPBELL ISLAND TEAL Anas aucklandica nesiotis
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999032285714286" page_id="56953552"  page_num="50" year="" vol="">
Status: Three males and one female are currently held.
Suitability: These birds were captured in 1984 and have settled in very
well. This small flightless form of brown teal should do as well as its larger,
more mobile cousin.
Potential: I can see no reason why this species should not breed as
freely as the Brown Teal.
Until recently only a dozen or so individuals had ever been seen and
only three specimens are known to be in museum collections (one col-
lected in 1886 and two in 1944).
Despite its name, there seem to be no records of this bird ever having
occurred on Campbell Island, although it is possible that they were ex-
terminated by an invasion of rats around 1810. The bird is known to
occur only on the nearby islet of Dent.
A 1975 estimate put the population of teal on this small island at
between 30 and 50 birds. A 1984 expedition to the island reported only
four positive sightings of birds and were unable to make an estimate of
the total population. The most alarming fact to come from this visit was
that several very recent landslides had occurred on the island affecting
what appear to be the principle habitats. Because of this, a special ex-
pedition was mounted in June 1984 to capture birds for a captive breed-
ing programme.

Status: Four adult pairs.
Suitability: As with the Campbell Island form, I can see no reason
why this species should not adapt well to captivity.
Potential: As for Campbell Island Teal.
Although apparently eliminated from Auckland Island itself (by
feral cats, pigs and rats), this small, flightless duck survives in stable,
although low, numbers on several surrounding islands (1974 estimate
1200-1500 birds). During the 1984 expedition to capture Campbell Island
Teal a number of this race were collected also for captive breeding pur-
poses.

Status: Fifteen males and ten females.
Suitability: Although taking longer than most waterfowl, this species
adapts well and thrives on a completely artificial diet. In the wild these
birds exist almost solely on the aquatic invertebrates which occur in swift
mountain streams. As it is not possible to duplicate this situation in cap-
tivity, the birds are weaned on to a pelleted food containing the same
basic nutrients.
Potential: Although problems have been experienced in the past, this
species is now breeding well in captivity.

the population at around 2000 birds. For a variety of reasons this species
is considered to be in a vulnerable position. As mentioned earlier, these
birds occur in fast flowing mountain streams and it is here that the prob-
lem lies. In some cases hydro-electric dams are slowing the flow of water
to the detriment of the aquatic insect life and in other areas land erosion
(brought on by forest clearance or grazing animals) deposits large quanti-
ties of silt with the same effect.
TAKAHE Notornis mantelli
Status: Two adult pairs and two birds of unknown sex.
Suitability: Adapts well to captivity and a supplementary artificial diet
although requiring large enclosures to provide adequate grazing area (ap-
proximately one hectare).
Potential: As a 'self-sustaining' captive population, the potential is
fairly good but as a species which could (by captive breeding) make a
significant contribution to the wild stock potential, it is very low. Only
five chicks have been successfully reared since the inception of the breed-
ing programme some 20 years ago.

About 120 Takahe still exist in the wild. In one particular study area
the population dropped from 50 birds to 12 between 1963 and 1980. Al-
though this appears to be a dramatic drop it is probable that the birds
have simply moved to other areas following a loss of winter habitat and
competition for food from Red Deer Census elaphus. Predation by Stoats
and Wekas Gallimllus australis is also an influencing factor.
Current conservation methods being used include aerial top dressing
with fertiliser to enrich poorer habitats, deer and predator control and
extending the range by relocating birds to other suitable areas, including
predator-free islands.

SHORE PLOVER Thinomis novaeseelandiae
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997259071428572" page_id="56953555"  page_num="53" year="" vol="">
Status: None currently held but a further attempt to establish a
captive colony is to be made within the next year or so.
Suitability: Birds which have been kept here were reared from eggs
taken from the wild. They proved to be an adaptable, easy to cater for
species.
Potential: Probably very good, as other small plover species have
been bred outside New Zealand.
Having been exterminated on the mainland by introduced predators
in the 1880s, the Shore Plover is now restricted to South-east Island
in the Chatham group. The species is currently safe, but the accidental
introduction of any mammalian predator to the island could spell dis-
aster. This is why a captive breeding programme is to be established in
order that the offspring produced may be used to colonise other suit-
able islands.

BLACK STILT Himantopus novaezealandiae
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9988783" page_id="56953555"  page_num="53" year="" vol="">
Status: Sixteen birds (eight adults and eight juveniles).
Suitability: Well suited to captivity provided the aviaries contain
suitable habitat. The adult birds were hand-reared from eggs collected
from the wild in 1979/80 as this is preferable to capturing wild birds
which do not adjust well to confinement.
Potential: As a captive species their potential is excellent and al-
though only one pair have bred so far, I am confident that this is purely
a spatial problem which can be overcome. This one pair has already
contributed to the wild population by producing 11 eggs in the last
season for transfer to wild foster parents.

Less than 50 birds survive in the wild and although the numbers are
increasing slowly (due largely to egg manipulation within the wild popu-
lation) the birds still face the ever present threats of predation by feral
cats, ferrets and rats, and the loss of habitat through drainage operations
and hydro-electric developments.
This species hybridises with the Common Pied Stilt Himantopus
leucocephalus and it is these cross pairings or the hybrids they pro-
duce which are being used as foster parents either for the eggs from the
National Wildlife Centre or eggs rescued from nests under threat in the
wild.

plex breeding system (based around lek displays) captive breeding would
be extremely difficult, although not impossible.
Until recently the Kakapo was known to survive only in remote areas
of Fiordland, in the South Island, and all birds handled (about 20) have
been males. However, a major breakthrough was made in February 1977
when a colony was discovered in an isolated area of Stewart Island. In this
population of up to an estimated 30 birds, 11 have been confirmed as
females. As this colony is under constant pressure from feral cats, 21 birds
have so far been moved to predator-free Little Barrier Island.

ANTIPODES ISLAND PARRAKEET Cyanoramphus unicolor
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999212076923077" page_id="56953557"  page_num="55" year="" vol="">
Status: One male and two females are held here although there are up
to 30 birds scattered around New Zealand in zoos and private collections.
Suitability: An extremely suitable captive species although some prob-
lems have been encountered when this long-isolated bird comes into con-
tact with mainland avian diseases to which it has no immunity.
Potential: As with other New Zealand parrakeets, this species breeds
freely and has become 'self-sustaining' in captivity.
This, the largest of the New Zealand parrakeets, inhabits the sub-Ant-
arctic Antipodes Island group where, at the moment, it is quite secure and
numbers several thousand. However, should the habitat be altered or
should predators become established, the chances of these ground-nesting
birds surviving are very slim. For this reason alone, captive populations
have been established as an insurance against extinction.

Cyanoramphus auriceps forbesi
Status: Three males (the only captive female died recently).
Suitability: Although generally well suited to captivity, this species
has proved difficult to breed. This is mainly due to the fact that the
birds are poor parents and foster parents (if available) must be used. A
further problem with this species is the birds' extreme nervousness when
nesting. They will not tolerate disturbance of any kind and will readily
destroy their eggs. Even feeding the birds while they are nesting can have
a disturbing effect.
Potential: Probably fairly good provided more stock can be obtained
and foster parents are available at the appropriate time.
This large subspecies of the mainland Yellow-crowned Parrakeet
occurs only on two small islands in the Chatham group. Although cur-
rently secure, this species faces the same problems confronting the birds
of the Antipodes Islands.
STICHBIRD Notiomystis cincta
Status: Three juvenile pairs of Stitch birds were received in April this
year. This species has been bred here previously.
Suitability:Appears well suited to captivity although the birds show
a preference for large, well planted aviaries.
Potential: Stitchbirds probably present a reasonable potential as a
&amp;apos;self-sustaining' captive species although captive breeding Is not a current
conservation strategy.
Until recently, Stitchbirds occurred only on Little Barrier Island having
been exterminated by introduced predators from the mainland by 1900.
Unfortunately this island sanctuary was (until 1931),overrun with feral
cats which we now know were having a drastic effect on the Stitchbird
population. Since these cats were exterminated by the Wildlife Service
the Stitchbirds have Increased dramatically and birds are now being
translocated to other secure islands.

Potential: Probably poor, although wild-caught birds survive well,
most living for many years. Although young are occasionally hatched in
captivity their survival is very poor. This is due largely to ineffectual
parental care and in some cases, I suspect, dietary deficiencies.
Once distributed over most of the North Island and many small off-
shore islands, the North Island Saddleback was known to survive on
only one small island when, in 1964, the Wildlife Service began a series
of experimental introductions to other suitable islands. These island
transfers have been most successful and the species now thrives in good
numbers on at least ten islands.
The survival of this species seems assured and captive breeding as a
conservation measure is not really necessary.

Suitability: As for the North Island subspecies.
Potential: As for the North Island subspecies.
As with the North Island Saddleback, these birds cannot survive in
the presence of introduced rats Rattus norvegicus and 11 rattus and
other mammalian predators. Because of this, they have been exter-
minated from most of their original range and are now restricted to a
handful of small islands off New Zealand&amp;apos;s south coast. Successful
island transfers have been used to establish further populations.
NORTH ISLAND KOKAKO Cailaeas cinerea wilsoni
Status: Three males and two females.
Suitability: Adapts well, although the aviaries need to be large and
well planted. j
Potential: As Kokako are only a recent acquisition of the Centre
their breeding potential is unknown although one pair was seen carry-
ing nest material around last summer.
Although originally found in forests throughout the island, it is prob-
able that this species underwent a reduction in numbers before the im-
pact of European settlement.
It now survives in a number of widely distributed pockets. The main
current threat to the survival of this species is the continual logging of

THE NEW ZEALAND KIWIS
Apteryx sp.
By B.E. ROWE
(Otorohanga Zoological Society, New Zealand)
The New Zealand Kiwis form a remarkable genus whose species have
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.9728995" page_id="56953561"  page_num="59" year="" vol="">
unfortunately diminished in numbers dramatically in recent years.
Of the three species, the Little Spotted Kiwi Apteryx owenii appears
to have disappeared completely from the mainland. The final demise was
probably caused by the introduced mustelids. A chance liberation at the
turn of the century has left a population of around 400 pairs on a small
island off the coast and all these birds probably originated from just two
pairs.
The Large Spotted Kiwi A. haastii is still secure in the South Island but
subjected to continued habitat destruction.
Of the Brown Kiwi A. australis , the Steward Island subspecies A.a.
lawryi is plentiful within its limited range whereas the South Island sub-
species A.a. australis is at high risk with only 20 odd individuals having
been sighted in recent years. The North Island subspecies A.a. mantelli
was numerous until very recently but is now diminishing rapidly under a
land development scheme whereby developers recover 45% of all costs of
development from the government. Therefore, what was formerly marginal
land has now become viable development under the new subsidy scheme,
to the detriment of kiwis and indeed other species.

B.E. ROWE - NEW ZEALAND KIWIS
The burrowing and nocturnal activities of kiwis have made study diffi-
cult, and much work remains to be done particularly in areas of popula-
tion dynamics and territory sizes. Despite the fact that the kiwi is the
national emblem, there is only one researcher working on the species.
The Otorohanga Zoological Society started work on the aviculture of
the kiwi around 12 years ago. The keen senses of smell and hearing, fac-
tors not normally attributed to birds, caused a few early problems. The
birds tended to associate the smell of a regular keeper with feeding and
would frequently refuse to eat if another keeper handled their food. The
current diet, which has been developed over the years, consists of (per
adult bird):
Sliced ox-heart 200 gms
Cooked rolled oats 180 gms
Soya bean oil 2.5 gms
Wheat germ flakes 2 gms
T.V.L. special premix No. 178 2 gms
The ox-hearts are trimmed of most of the fat and hard material and
sliced into 'Julienne' strips of about 5 cm long. The premix, wheat germ,
and oil are mixed with the meat, and the rolled oats, which have been
previously cooked and cooled, are stirred in. The rolled oats are cooked
to produce a heavy viscous solution which is used to prevent the meat
from drying out and also provides vegetable matter in the diet.
In the wild, a wide variety of insects and worms is eaten, along with
various berries and seeds. The stomach contents of one bird even pro-
duced a freshwater crayfish.
Wild birds handed in are offered only the artificial diet and although
no bird has yet refused to eat it to the point of death by starvation, the
specimen that refused to eat for 43 days must have got very close to it.
This particular bird returned to reception weight within three weeks.
As kiwis are territorial and can be extremely aggressive in the breeding
season, it has been the practice to keep only one pair in an enclosure.
Space is not a limiting factor at Otorohanga, so outside breeding enclo-
sures are around 250 m 2 each in area. An enclosure of this dimension
ensures an element of natural foraging and shows no sign of fouling.
Burrowing activity seems confined to nesting so perimeter fencing is
taken only half a metre below ground level. To prevent bill damage
through wire, solid fencing is taken up to a metre high and a further
metre is added with wire and electrified outriggers to prevent access by
predators.

be quite adequate. A well drained base of rich loam and leaf litter is pro-
vided and kept damp at all times to prevent lung infections which can
occur with inhalation of dust. Good ventilation is essential to avoid fungus
growth. Temperatures above 20*C tend to cause lethargy in kiwis.
Burrows are provided for the birds in outside and nocturnal enclosures.
These consist of a tunnel 70 cm long and 19 cm^, linking on to a box 24 x
35 x 29 cm high. These measurements can be varied slightly but happen to
coincide with standard timber sizes.
Kiwis breed at two to four years old and require up to six months to
settle into a new enclosure as a pair, before breeding. Eggs can be laid any
month of the year but peak production is midwinter to early spring. One
to three eggs are laid, the usual clutch being two. These are produced at
around 21-day intervals with incubation commencing after development
of the extensive brood patch - about a week after the first egg is laid. Egg
weight represents approximately 20% of the hen's weight and the X-Ray
photograph shown here graphically demonstrates the space occupied by
the egg inside the hen.
The incubation period is 71-80 days. The air cell lies eccentric at the
large end of the egg and must lie uppermost throughout incubation. The
egg is not turned at all during incubation.
Telemetry methods used at Otorohanga gave incubation temperatures
of 36*C at the top of the egg and 26*C on the bottom. Currently incu-
bation is done in still-air incubators where temperature layering approxi-
mates actual determined gradients. Forced draught or even temperature
development has not been attempted at this stage.
Kiwi chicks lack an egg tooth and first break the shell with a single
puncture at the air cell end. High humidities are required from this point
to prevent the extremely tough shell membrane from drying out and
hardening. One to two days later, pressure is exerted using the already
massive feet and the end of the shell (which is somewhat thinner) breaks
open to release the chick.
The chick is fully feathered at hatching but unable to stand and the
legs strengthen over several days. Chicks are kept in the incubator for six
days, on rough surface towelling to prevent splayed legs. On the seventh
day they are placed in a brooder where, on the seventh and eighth night
they venture out and eat pieces of twig and small stone to prepare the
crop for food. Feeding proper starts on the ninth night. Handling during
the first few weeks, if not done with extreme care, is generally fatal. The
brooders used have a darkened controlled heat area with an access to a
dirt-filled run approximately 1 m x 1.5 m long. The adult food mix is
offered from the start although the meat is sliced a little thinner. No chick
has yet refused food. The chicks do not actively imprint and can be reared

in isolation. They dislike being stroked or handled.
Several escapees have proved that captive-reared kiwis are quite capable
of survival in the wild.
Financial constraints limit aviculture as a means of building up or re-
introducing this species into the wild. The costs of maintaining enough
pairs for breeding and rearing large quantities of chicks to six months, old
enough for liberation, are prohibitive when all feeding and housing costs
are considered. The survival of this species in New Zealand will depend on
active habitat preservation which currently is sadly lacking.

DECLINE OF THE GREATER PATAGONIAN CONURE
Cyanoliseus patagonus byroni

(Illinois, USA)
The decline of the Greater Patagonian Conure is well known, yet it was
not until recently that its truly precarious status was reported. Jurgen
Rohmann was quoted in Chile Forestal (August, 1982) to the effect that
total aggregates are 1,000. This alarming decrease can be imputed to the
removal of young by local people for pets or food. Although protected,
the law is apparently not enforced - a most disconcerting case for unless
stringent measures are taken, its existence in the next century will only be
in text books and possibly confinement.
This parrot is rare in aviculture, although it is held by collections in
England, Italy and Chile. Breeding successes have been reported in these
three countries. The total number of young produced is very small, so
better management of the birds is pertinent; pairs must be used to their
full capacity so that as many young as possible can be reared.
Up until the present time, no serious breeding scheme was in operation
in Chile but this is chancing, for Guillermo Moreno of Chilian has plans
that call for the establishment of a breeding centre for this and other
endangered species.
Colony breeding, which is usually the rule with the nominate subspecies
patagonus , is not to be recommended for this subspecies, which is much
more aggressive. Therefore, only a single pair should be kept in an aviary.
Trading between the collections that have specimens and the inception
of a Studbook should be given priority. If captive birds are properly
managed and young dispersed to other collections with the goal of estab-
lishing pairs, there is no reason why the Greater Patagonian Conure cannot
become established in captivity.

Assessing the status of any species of bird in captivity without a general
census is most difficult. I shall give a broad opinion, based on my observa-
tions and the general trends that occur from time to time with bird species
held in captivity in Australia, with additional information from South Aus-
tralia. Individual state fauna laws have played quite a significant role in the
keeping of at least two of the species under discussion .
The species to be described in this paper are the Golden-shouldered
Parrot Psephotus chrysopterygius, the Hooded Parrot P. dissimilis, the
Turquoise Parrot Neophema pulchella, and the Scarlet-chested Parrot
N. splendida.
Their captive status in Australia will be described as follows: increasing-
ly productive populations; steadily increasing rather than decreasing; quite
plentiful without being abundant; and moderately common. These classifi-
cations are based on the overall bird collections held by aviculturists in
Australia and bearing in mind the greatly increased interest in Psittaci-
formes during the past 15 years. The improved husbandry in aviculture in
Australia has minimised many of the problems that were experienced by
bird keepers several decades ago and the accumulated knowledge and ex-
perience available today should ensure the future of these four species in
Australian aviculture.
If a general understanding and good working liaison is adopted between
the various government fauna bodies and the various avicultural societies,
the future of our rare birds will be preserved. Although published records
of the world status of birds held for avicultural purposes is either sketchy
or unavailable, the Red Data Book, compiled by the International Union
for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, provides statistics on
the status of threatened species throughout their world range. This should
not be confused with birds held in captivity as there are many species
listed as rare in the wild that are quite common in aviculture. I have often
thought how interesting and exciting it would be to have a general census
held, say, every three years, of all birds kept in captivity so as to draw
comparisons with the status of wild populations.

History and status in captivity in Australia
To trace the introduction of the Golden-shouldered Parrot into Austra-
lian aviculture, we must turn the clock back to 1922. According to Alan
Lendon (1960), a collector called McLennan obtained and hand-reared
some young birds, of which ten were presented to Taronga Park Zoo in
Sydney. No breeding reports were recorded for these birds and they
lived on for several years.
There appears to be no further record of Golden--shouldered Parrots
being obtained for aviculture in Australia until 1952 when Sir Edward
Hallstrom acquired two adult males, one of which he mated to a female
Hooded Parrot. After two expeditions to Cape York Peninsula in 1955,
his collection of Golden-shouldered Parrots had increased to about 20
birds (Lendon, 1960). With these additional birds, Sir Edward was able
to select pairs and by 1956 he was breeding pure-bred young.
When Alan Lendon visited Sir Edward Hallstrom in August 1959, his
flock had grown to about 40 birds. It was during this visit that Sir Edward
offered Lendon a pair that had been bred in 1958. Alan Lendon brought
the young Golden--shouldered Parrots back to his aviaries in Adelaide
and early in 1960 the late Fred Lewitzka and I were invited to view them.
Both birds were in full adult plumage and excellent condition. In mid-
September the same year the pair were nesting and four eggs were laid,
three young were seen on 12th October, but unfortunately all were dead
a week later. The birds were housed in an aviary measuring 6 x 3 x 6 ft
(1.83 x 0.92 x 1.83m) with a shelter section at the rear measuring
3 x 3 x 714ft (0.92 x 0.92 x 2.29m). The Golden-shouldered Parrots were
the sole occupants of the aviary. A nest-box was placed in the shelter
section 6 ft from the ground; the inside measurements of the box were
10 x 6 x 6in (0.25 x 0.15 x 0.15m) with a spout entrance 4in (0.10m)
long and 2 x 2in (0.05 x 0.05m) inside. Decayed wood dirt was placed
in the bottom of the box. In August 1961 breeding was in progress again
and the first egg was laid on the 29th, followed by four others on alter-
nate days. By 24th September all five eggs had hatched and the first
young left the nesting box on 25th October. Approximately 14 days
later the birds were independent. By November the following year (1962)
the young were fully coloured and were all males.
The Avicultural Society of South Australia awarded their bronze
medal to Alan Lendon for the first official breeding of this species in
captivity in South Australia.
By this time the well-known aviculturist Joseph Mattinson, of New
South Wales, had become very interested in the Golden-shouldered Parrot

and during a journey to Cairns, Queensland, in 1960 he spoke to an offi-
cial in the Department of Agriculture regarding the birds and was assured
of a permit if he could obtain any. Eventually he was successful and
secured four males and one female (Mattinson, 1975).
Those five birds became the nucleus of Joseph Mattinson's stock and
in his article (1975) he wrote: "We have 20 pairs of Golden-shoulders, not
all of which are of course in breeding condition and this year raised about
60. There is still a significant deathrate in Golden-shoulders and we should
be raising well over a hundred each year but are limited to the number
which we can hand-rear as this is very time consuming".
During the breeding season of 1974 I observed the Golden-shouldered
Parrots in Joseph Mattinson's collection and was amazed at the young
birds being reared, clutches of four and five being quite common.
From the stock of both these aviculturists it was not long before Gol-
den-shouldered Parrots appeared in collections around Australia. This is
one of a number of species included on the eighth schedule (Rare Species)
of the South Australian National Parks and Wildlife Act, 1972-74.
Under Section 51(a) of the Act, in part, in order to have such animals
in your possession it is necessary to have a Rare Species permit (Section
55). This Section provides for the Minister for the Environment to grant
such a permit where he is satisfied that:
a) It is in the interests of scientific research, or
b) It is desirable for the sake of conserving animals of a rare species to
do so.
By June 1975 there were eight people in South Australia keeping 37
Golden-shouldered Parrots in captivity. All were held under permit with
the expiry date 30th June 1975. After that date it was necessary for re-
newal of their permit.
By now Golden-shouldered Parrots were increasing in captivity in all
states of Australia. It was during that time that the Queensland Parlia-
ment passed legislation affording stringent protection to the Golden-
shouldered Parrot in the wild, their reason being that numbers in the wild
appeared to be decreasing and the possibility of birds being smuggled out
of Australia was a further threat so that every effort was needed to pro-
tect the species.
The original idea was that all Golden-shouldered Parrots that were
held in captivity in Queensland should be forfeited to the government for
scientific research, if suitable facilities to house them could be found.
Naturally unrest was evident among aviculturists throughout Australia
when they were advised of this plan. Ministers of Conservation in each
State and Territory became involved and by then the numbers of birds
held by aviculturists in Australia were fast increasing.

BARRY R. HUTCHINS - FOUR RARE AUSTRALIAN PARROTS
Although the authorities held discussions no uniform decision could
be agreed upon and, therefore, it was left to each State to formulate its
own regulations. Up until that time (1975) Golden-shouldered Parrots
were purchased within and from most States in Australia. As mentioned,
breeding results were greatly improving.
From 1st July 1975, persons with Golden-shouldered Parrots in South
Australia were not permitted to dispose of their birds to other avicul-
turists within that State. Permits would be issued to send Golden-shoul-
dered Parrots to other States if permission was granted from their autho-
rities. Although there was an outcry from South Australian aviculturists,
a number of breeders eventually disposed of their birds interstate and by
1980 three persons still held a total of approximately 16 birds in their
collections.
During the breeding season of 1980, one of these aviculturists decided
to make a concerted effort with the birds still in his possession as he was
very worried by the decline of this rare species within South Australia. He
reared 19 young to independence. It is pleasing to note that in New South
Wales and Victoria there was a steady increase in breeding from 1975 to
1980 and in 1984 permits were once again being issued in South Australia.
It is to be hoped that, through the experience gained during the past 20
years, in a short time this very rare and beautiful species will increase its
status in aviaries throughout Australia.

During the early 1840s the celebrated ornithologist John Gilbert was
exploring an area north-east of Darwin, near Port Essington, which is loca-
ted on the Coburg Peninsula and apparently he failed to record the Hooded
Parrot. In 1845 the Leichhardt expedition passed through the country
now inhabited by the species with no sightings recorded, and in 1846
Elsey, a collector with the Gregory expedition, failed to record the parrot
while passing through what is now known to be the heart of the Hooded
Parrot's range.
In 1863, while travelling northwards from Newcastle Waters, Stuart's
expedition also appears to have missed sighting the Hooded Parrot. It was
not until 1894, during a collecting expedition by Professor Knut Dahl in
tropical northern Australia, that specimens of the Hooded Parrot were
taken near the Mary River in the Northern Territory (Barrett, 1949).
These specimens were sent to Norway (incredible as that may seem!)
and were described by Collet in 1898 (Condon, 1975).
From those findings it would appear that the Hooded Parrot was not
abundant at the time of European settlement and it is quite possible that
their numbers have actually increased in the wild since those early times.
Their appearance in captivity in South Australia occurred in the late
1920s. W. Hamilton was the first aviculturist to be recorded officially as
having bred them, in 1930 and subsequently he was awarded the Avic-
ultural Society of South Australia's Bronze Medal for his achievement.
The Hooded Parrot has, for many years, been subjected to numerous
rumours regarding possible stringent fauna regulations regarding captive
birds in Australia. These possible threats have left an uneasy feeling among
many aviculturists and the thought of perhaps, one day, a ban being placed
on the species in captivity has disuaded many breeders, both new and
experienced, from keeping more than one or two pairs. This has prevented
the development of the Hooded Parrot to its fullest potential.
The numbers in captivity in Australia should be far greater than they
are today (mid-1984). During the 1970s the total captive population in
South Australia was probably between 450 to 500. The approximate
numbers in captivity throughout the whole of Australia (1984) could be
in the vicinity of 2000.

It would surely be a sad day if stringent regulations were introduced
to prevent the Hooded Parrot from further development as a captive spe-
cies because the knowledge gained about the species during the past 50
years, plus the improved husbandry&amp;apos; of today, can only enhance the
species' existence for generations to come.
In my opinion the Hooded Parrot is full of character and certainly one
of the more unique and distinct species of Australian avifauna.
It should also be remembered that the field studies of the Hooded
Parrot would not be able to compare with the captive studies that have
been carried out by aviculturists in Australia.
The Hooded Parrot is on the official list of Australian Endangered Birds
and while their numbers at present are not critical, either in the wild or
in captivity, every effort should be made for continuous, careful and
selective breeding by aviculturists, together with a close watch by wild-
life authorities on the natural habitat of the species.

THE TURQUOISE PARROT Neophema pulchella
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996507075" page_id="56953575"  page_num="71" year="" vol="">
The Turquoise Parrot was first described in 1792 by Shaw in The
Naturalist&amp;apos;s Miscellany , Vol. 3, plate 96 (Condon, 1975). It is interesting
to read the early history of this species. Prior to 1900 the Turquoise Parrot
was quite common in areas of south-eastern Australia. John Gould (1865)
wrote, "All those who have traversed the 'bush' in New South Wales will
recognise in this lovely species an old favourite, for it must have often
come under their notice".
At the turn of this century a dramatic decline in the existence of the
species was noted. It would seem that the clearing of land, the expansion
of European settlement, severe drought conditions and possibly disease
were the major factors (Immelmann, 1968).
By 1917 many ornithologists feared that the Turquoise Parrot was
extinct. In 1973, in a most comprehensive article on this species, H.E.A.
Jarman wrote: "An old trapper informed G.A. Heuman, of Sydney, (1927),
that the Turquoise Parrot had been the commonest parrot in his district
30 to 40 years previously. He would catch two or three dozen before
breakfast and sell them from 2/- to 2/6 per pair. Heuman ruefully com-
mented that he had recently paid 30 dollars for a male bird that was acci-
dentally netted with some finches".
Unfortunately we have no records of the success rate in captivity of
birds trapped in those early years. We can only surmise that at least a
percentage did survive. From 1920 onwards, sightings of the Turquoise
Parrot became more frequent with reports from New South Wales, Vic-
toria and Queensland. In December 1926, Simon Harvey of Adelaide,
South Australia, bred four Turquoisine Parrots in captivity, and during
the breeding season of 1927, a young male from the first breeding of the
previous year (12 months old) fathered a nest of four, all were reared to
maturity. Shortly after the Avicultural Society of South Australia was
founded in 1928, Simon Harvey submitted a breeding report for the first
official breeding of the Turqoise Parrot in South Australia and was duly
awarded the Society's bronze medal.
It would seem that, from those first breedings, the Turqoise Parrot
would soon become abundant in aviaries but this was not the case.
During those early years of aviculture the keeping and breeding of finches
far surpassed the number of parrots kept, and the few people keeping
Turquoise Parrots found that infertile eggs were common. Alan Lendon
(1973) relates his early experiences with the species and although a num-
ber of young were reared the problem of clear eggs was also encountered.
From about 1956 Turquoise Parrots became more popular with avicul-
turists and by 1976 most parrot collections throughout Australia housed

from one to ten pairs, or more, I would estimate their numbers in cap-
tivity in Australia today (1984) to be approximately 8000. Their numbers
in the wild have increased considerably and at this stage they are not a
threatened species. However, I would hasten to add that, although the
Turquoise Parrot appears to be safe at present, I believe that it is one
species that should never be neglected, either by aviculturists or orni-
thologists.

THE SCARLET-CHESTED PARROT Neophema splendida

<bodyText confidence="0.99896925" page_id="56953577"  page_num="73" year="" vol="">
The Scarlet-chested Parrot was first described by John Gould in 1840
from a specimen that was sent to him with no information other than it
was a native of Swan River Western Australian. It was not until 1845 that
Gould received further specimens which were collected by Johnson Drum-
mond near Moore's River in Western Australia (Gould, 1972). Although
this species was observed on a number of occasions after that period, it
was not until 1914 that a sighting by the late Hermann B. Scholz was to
have a major effect in the development of the Scarlet-chested Parrot in
captivity in Australia.
In 1914 Hermann Scholz was working with a survey gang, which was
associated with the construction of the East-West Railway line, situated
near Lake Hart, in South Australia. It was near that location that Scholz
observed his first adult male Scarlet-chested Parrot. Although at that
time the bird was unfamiliar to him, its striking beauty remained in his
mind. Scholz saw the Scarlet-chested Parrot again in 1931, when a
female was rescued from a hawk on his farm at Yaninee on the west
coast of South Australia (Scholz, 1965). This was the beginning of a long
and dedicated era for a man and his love for one of Australia's rare parrots.
By 1937 Scholz had sufficient birds to start a line breeding programme.
He carefully selected the best of his young ones and eventually was breed-
ing from no less than 12 adult pairs. This pattern of breeding continued
until his death in the 1970s. During 1930, the late Simon Harvey, a prom-
inent aviculturist in South Australia, stayed with Hermann Scholz on his
property at Yaninee in the hope of finding the Scarlet-chested Parrot.
"Needless to say, we did not sight any" (Scholz, 1965). However, in 1932
several birds arrived in Adelaide and by June that year Simon Harvey had
in his possession the very beautiful Scarlet-chested Parrot.
Within ten months of living in an aviary, one pair showed an interest in
nesting, eventually rearing five young; another pair went to nest on 24th
August 1932, and five more young were reared. This breeding was record-
ed as the "first official breeding" in South Australia and Simon Harvey
was awarded the Avicultural Society of South Australia's bronze medal for
the first breeding and the silver medal for the most outstanding breeding of
the year.
In South Australia during 1972 the Fauna Conservation Act 1964-65
was repealed and replaced by the National Parks and Wildlife Act, 1972.
As the Scarlet-chested Parrot was a rare species in the wild, it was listed
on the Eighth Schedule (Rare Species) and certain restrictions were there-
fore imposted upon keeping the species in captivity. The new Act was not
received favourably by aviculturists, as a ten dollar annual permit fee was

required, plus a rare species record book giving details of breedings, sales
and deaths. Dealers were not permitted to trade with the species thereby
restricting the movement of surplus stock out of South Australia.
During that particular time (1972) there were approximately 2457
Scarlet-chested Parrots held by aviculturists in South Australia.
The legislation had a depressing effect on the overall status of the
Scarlet-chested Parrot throughout Australia and, owing to the build up
of surplus birds within South Australia, many breeders refrained from
placing nesting logs or boxes in their aviaries, and the situation became
serious. After discussions between prominent aviculturists and members
of Parliament (over a period of two years), the Scarlet-chested Parrot was
again allowed freedom of trade. On 31st February 1980, South Australian
aviculturists had in their possession 3558 Scarlet-chested Parrots and this
number at the time of writing (mid 1984) would be at least three fold
throughout the whole of Australia. Readers might infer from this article
that the Scarlet-chested Parrot is a common bird in captivity but I would
suggest that any species which has a captive population of 10,000 or less
is not common and we should ensure that we do not become complacent.

Conclusion:
In Australia the captive populations of the four parrots mentioned are
probably greater today than at any other time.
There is no potential risk at the moment of gene damage with any of
the four species. Many breeders have developed their own genetic families
and as long as this scientific approach is adopted, each generation that is
produced enhances the survival rate of each species. If a numerical ranking
system could be adopted, this would be beneficial in assessing the status of
birds in captivity; this in turn would monitor any declines, thus allowing
for concerted breeding efforts to eliminate the threat to the species' sur-
vival.

THE LAYSAN TEAL - RECENT HISTORY AND FUTURE?

have been called in recent monographs on waterfowl (Phillips, 1923;
Delacour, 1956, 1964), had not been kept in captivity by 1956, the time
of the appearance of Delacour $ second volume of his major work dealing
with the waterfowl of the world. By the time of the final volume, however,
much had been learned of this remote, isolated island and its diminutive
duck. Laysan is a narrow islet of raised coral reef, scarcely three miles long
with a central, brackish pond that periodically varies in size, with dunes
reaching less than 40 ft above the sea and with little vegetation and sus-
tenance. The birds appear to be adapted to living on insect larvae of lepi-
doptera, flies and beetles with occasional brine shrimp in the brackish
pools. The island lies in the Leeward chain of old, eroded volcanic sea
mounts, some 485 miles WNW of Honolulu, Hawaiian Islands. In 1957, a
government census disclosed that the population of Teal, poorly surveyed
in previous years, had increased greatly to a presumed near-saturation
point of some 400-600 individuals. From my then post at Yale University,
I joined with others in writing to the U.S. Department of the Interior's
Sport, Fisheries and Wildlife Bureau to suggest that such an overpopula-
tion might produce a 'crash' in numbers, and that some capture and cap-
tive rearing might be attempted. This opinion fortunately coincided with
that of the Bureau and of the Hawaiian Board of Agriculture and Forestry,
and two sets of birds were caught, in 1957 eight duck, and in 1958, some
36. These birds were distributed among five zoological parks interested in
captive breeding, the Wildfowl Trust, and private collections including
Dr. Delacour* and mine in Litchfield, Connecticut. Young began to be
reared in Connecticut in 1959 and in a number of the major collections
successfully in following years and a stable, but small population has been
maintained ever since. Laysan Teal have been described in their natural
habitat as relatively tame, inclined to scuttle away from intruders into
the vegetation without flying (in truth they can fly but, like isolated, insu-
lar bird populations in general, seem to tend to avoid doing so), and to be
aggressive among themselves, keeping in small groups or pairs. The same
behaviour has been noted in captivity. First efforts at rearing them pro-
duced evidence of aggression, difficulty in getting young to feed and a
penchant for live food. However, the resulting captive population now
seems easy enough to rear and to keep. Subsequently the status of Lay-

san Island has been extensively described and the remarkable fluctuation
in number of the Teal discussed. A comprehensive summary and recent
history and ecology of the Lay san Teal, including notes on the first cap-
ture of these birds in the late 1950s, was published by R.E. Warner (1961).
Berger (1981) published an historical account of the bird's existence on
Laysan, noting, as had Warner, the fluctuations in the island population
over the known years of record.
Until recently the lowest estimate of the population of Laysan Teal
was that of Bailey (1956), who estimated that when he visited in 1912,
only some seven individuals were extant. More recently still, a record pub-
lished by Ely and Clapp (1973, Table LT3), is perhaps the most striking
record of a species' survival ever alleged. It appears to be a fact that in
1930 a surviving pair existed on Laysan, of which the male and the then
existing nest were destroyed in a storm. The remaining female proved to
be gravid, laid again in a new nest, and produced living young! Survival
could be described as existing on a razor's edge.
The future of the Laysan Duck or Teal thus depends on two factors: a
responsible and conscientious effort to maintain captive stock in the face
of natural fluctuations on Laysan in recent years of between 400 and 600
individuals (King, 1977), and the constant danger of predator introduction
or natural disasters. This responsibility, however, presents an added prob-
lem as most aviculturists will admit. Who is to be responsible? The little
Laysan Duck is inconspicuous, "not pretty", as one might say. Most pub-
lic collections of waterfowl do not include it, and those among us avicul-
turists who care are subject to mortality, errors of judgment and natural
disasters, just as are the natural inhabitants of Laysan. Our U.S. Govern-
ment has no consistent policy in regard to aviculture at present, witness
the ups and downs of Pohakaloa in Hawaii, and some of the reserves on
the mainland where experimental programmes are carried on. In all con-
science, our Government should help bear such an international respon-
sibility.
Finally, why is the Laysan Teal (as I prefer to call it) so important?
I have written twice about the bird in this journal (1943, 1959), point-
ing out how interesting small island populations are. In 1960 I wrote
about the duck on Laysan and maintained that it should be considered an
endemic species, a monotypic one within the genus Anas for several
reasons which I might quote here again herewith, after giving measure-
ments and a drawing of the downy plumage (Ripley, 1960):
'The size of the eggs of the Laysan Teal, and the size of the ducklings
are both extraordinarily large in proportion to the adult birds which are
the size of teal. There is apparently an allometric rate of growth which
differs markedly from the Mallard, involving not only initial size of the

egg and young but also body proportions. There must be an adaptive
value for this isolated, reef-inhabiting duck in having an egg and duckling
at hatching age so large in proportion to the adult. In addition, the bill
size and shape suggest an adaptation to insectivorous diet.
'Delacour and Mayr (1945) have emphasized the conservative nature
and taxonomic value of downy plumages of waterfowl. On the basis of
the rather striking downy plumage differences, proportionate growth
differences, bill shape, small size and coarse plumage, I would be inclined
to keep Anas laysanensis as a monotypic species within the Mallard Anas
platyrhynchos superspecies. 5
One additional point might be mentioned. In the 26 years that this
species has been kept at Litchfield, we have never had a hybrid between
this duck and other species, including the slightly larger Hawaiian Duck
Anas platyrhynchos wyvillliana . The latter is a difficult form to keep in
captivity, as unless isolated, it may hybridize with forms of the Mallard,
including a variety of species such as the Australian and Spot-billed Mal-
lards. Such an indication, as well as the rather aggressive nature of these
little creatures, would seem to indicate that on balance the Laysan Teal
prefers to be &amp;apos;itself. Under the circumstances, I would be inclined to
respect that suggestion and treat the species in a similar manner.

In 1970 The Peregrine Fund, a private, non-profit-making organization
affiliated with Cornell University, undertook a long-term project to develop
and refine methods for the captive propagation of falcons. The ultimate
goal was to utilize captive-bred progeny to replace the extirpated Peregrine
Falco peregrinus population in the eastern United States, as well as to
augment the much reduced wild populations in western states (Cade,
1974).
Today (1984) the Peregrine Fund consists of breeding facilities located
at Ithaca, New York, Fort Collins in Colorado, and at the University of
California, Santa Cruz. In addition, construction has begun at Boise, Ida-
ho, for a new programme - The World Center for Birds of Prey.
Our Cornell breeding colony consists of peregrines obtained from di-
verse geographic sources - including birds from Arctic and boreal North
America, the Pacific Northwest, Scotland, Spain, Australia, South Ameri-
ca, as well as various crosses between individuals from the above popula-
tions.
The first young Peregrines were reared at our Cornell facility in 1973,
when four laying females produced 20 young. Table 1 illustrates our total
eastern production to date. Numbers produced have steadily increased
over the years, peaking in 1982. Our initial four laying females have been
increased to 24, and the 20 young produced in 1973 have risen to 93 in
1982. By 1983 the total production at our three research facilities since
our work started had reached 1011 Peregrine chicks.
While we are pleased with our accomplishments to date, we have en-
countered some problems that have prevented full realization of the
maximum reproductive potential of our adult females. The most serious
problem has been associated with the fertilization process. Currently we
are achieving an overall fertilization rate of nearly 60%, essentially the
same as in our early years.

This comparatively low rate, despite improved semen collecting and
inseminating techniques, can be attributed to: 1) decreased fertility in
many of our older breeding pairs; 2) a general, deterioration In egg quali-
ty associated primarily with our older birds; and 3) allowing falcons
requiring artificial insemination to lay the first egg of a clutch before
initiating insemination, thereby losing the possibility of fertilizing the
first, and frequently the second, egg.
Inseminations were initially carried out by depositing semen from a
capillary tube approximately 5-10 mm into the cloaca of the female.
The results from this technique were poor, yielding fertility rates of
approximately 10%. Currently an insemination syringe is used to depo-
sit semen 25-50 mm directly into the manually everted oviduct. Ferti-
lization rates of nearly 75% are achieved using this technique (Weaver
and Cade, 1983).
An additional important consideration in the management of a
breeding facility is the availability of sufficient quantities of high quality
semen. Semen must be readily available to inseminate non-copulating,
as well as human-imprinted, laying females at the appropriate time.
Initially we employed the standard manipulative technique for obtain-
ing semen utilized by the poultry industry similar to that described by
Lake and Stewart (1978). We found, however, that in addition to the
considerable stress on the male involved, the quantities of semen ob-
tained are small and irregularly produced, ranging from. 10-50 micro
litres per collection, and frequently are contaminated with urates. Now
we use a technique employing sexually mature males imprinted on
humans and trained to copulate voluntarily on a special hat worn by the
human companion (Boyd, et al 1977). A male so socialized and con-
ditioned can be expected to yield copious quantities of fresh, high
quality semen on a daily basis for an extended period. Table 2 illus-
trates the seasonal semen production in 1983 of four imprinted males
conditioned to copulate on a mating hat (see also Cade and Fyfe, 1978).
In conjunction with this need for semen, a project is currently under
way at The Peregrine Fund to perfect cryo-preservation of raptor semen.
The availability of viable frozen semen will allow for the extended
storage of desirable genes, and eventually will aid in their preservation,
exchange and transfer.
Our falcons are hatched .in forced air incubators following the para-
meters of incubation worked out by Rahn and Ar (1974), Rahn et al
(1977), and in general we have achieved a consistent hatch rate of from
70-80% of our fertile eggs (see Weaver and Cade, 1983, for further de-
tails on propagation).
To maintain long-term production in captivity, it is important that re-

productive capacity should not diminish in succeeding generations of
breeders. Table 3 indicates that at our Cornell facility in the years 1973
to 1983, the productivity of the F |generation has been comparable to
that of the original wild-caught parent generation. Any apparent dif-
ferences noted in the percentage of fertile hatched and the percentage
reared can be attributed to our manipulation of incubation parameters,
with little, if any, biological significance. Some birds of the F 2 gene-
ration are also breeding now, but it is too soon to draw conclusions
about their reproductive performance.
We have encountered few problems associated with the growth and
behavioural development of our chicks. The young falcons reared at our
facilities appear indistinguishable from wild birds (see, also, Sherrod,
1983).
In order to establish captive-reared Peregrines in the wild, we have used
three release techniques: hacking, fostering, and cross-fostering. These
techniques have been described in detail by Sherrod and Cade (1978),
Cade (1980), Sherrod et al (1982). The technique of 'hacking' is actually a
modification of the falconer's method of the traditional hack (Michell,
1900), the major difference being that, whenever possible, we allow all
falcons to return to the wild. Briefly, the hacking process involves placing
three to ten nestling Peregrines approximately 30 days old in an enclosed
artificial eyrie, a 'hack' box, where they are fed and cared for by on-site
attendants. After about two weeks in this enclosure, when the birds are
nearly capable of flight, the hack-box is opened allowing the birds to fly
when they are ready. Following their release, the birds return to this
artificial eyrie for food until such time (about five to six weeks) as they
become independent and leave the hack area. Hack-boxes have been
placed on natural sites (cliffs) as well as on man-made sites (towers and
city buildings).
Fostering involves placing young Peregrines in the established eyrie
of a nesting pair of Peregrines, thus increasing natural production and
supplementing depleted local populations.
Cross-fostering has been accomplished by placing Peregrine chicks in
the active eyries of Prairie Falcons Falco mexicanus in the western states.
In Germany it has been done using pairs of Goshawks Accipiter gentilis
(Saar et al, 1982).
Our first experimental attempts at releasing captive-bred Peregrine
Falcons to the wild occurred in 1974 when we fostered two downy
chicks into a wild Peregrine eyrie in Colorado and hacked a second set
of two from the roof of a building overlooking a university campus in
New York State (Cade, 1974). It was not until 1975, however, that

experiments to begin. In that year we released 16 young at five sites (two
in cliffs and three on towers) in the East. Since 1974, the Peregrine Fund
has released a total of 1011 captive-bred Peregrines in the continental
United States. During 1983, 511 young have been released at 22 hacking
stations in nine eastern states, and an estimated 402 of these have sur-
vived to independence (Barclay and Cade, 1983). A total of 500 captive-
bred young have been released in 12 western states, and an estimated 375
have survived through the first four weeks after release and dispersed nor-
mally.
The first encouraging results from our hacking efforts occurred in 1976
when a male released in 1975 at a coastal tower in New Jersey returned to
the very same hack-box where he had been originally released and fed with
the young currently being hacked there that season (Cade and Dague,

Table 4 shows the number of adult birds recorded as returning to
release sites each year in our eastern programme. Each year as the number
of young being released in the east increased, the population of returning
adults has slowly built up. With the increase in the wild population, a
sufficient density of falcons had apparently been reached in 1979 to allow
pair formation and maintenance with some stability. The first reproduc-
dive attempt in the eastern U.S. that we are aware of by a captive-bred
falcon occurred in 1979 when a lone female, 'Scarlett', released in 1977,
established a territory on the United States Fidelity and Guaranty building
in Baltimore, Maryland. 'Scarletf accepted an artificial nest-box filled with
gravel and laid three infertile eggs. Following full-term incubation, four
downy chicks hatched at our breeding facility at Cornell were subsequent-
ly fostered to this dedicated female and successfully reared by her. Also in
1979, four pairs were formed at previous hack-sites, and one pair laid two
fertile eggs. Unfortunately, these eggs disappeared late in incubation, and
predation by crows is suspected to have been the reason.

In 1980, two pairs of Peregrines nested in the eastern US,, producing
four young. This milestone, the first known successful nesting of Pere-
grines east of the Mississippi River in more than 20 years, demonstrated
conclusively the suitability of the hacking process as a means of success-
fully establishing a population of Peregrines in the wild.
Table 5 summarizes the nesting attempts and the production of wild-
produced young as a result of our efforts in the eastern U.S. Following
our initial success in 1980, the number of adult pairs formed and young
produced has steadily increased. With this build-up of the wild population,
pairs have started occupying new and diverse territories. In addition to
the coastal tower sites, a pair used a traditional cliff site successfully for
the first time in 1981 (Cade and Hague, 1981), and in 1983 the first of
our birds bred on bridges in a busy metropolitan area (New York City)
(Cade and Hague, 1983).

Table 6 shows the eastern hacking results according to type of site
used. As can be noted from the data, the best release sites for hacking
young falcons have been coastal towers, A total of 238 young have been
released from the tower sites with an average of 81% of the young dis-
persing successfully. Inland cliffs are the second most utilized hack-
sites, where about 75% of the 216 young survived to become indepen-
dent. Urban areas have been used as release areas for only 57 young.
In 1983 there were at least 16 pairs of adults established in the mid-
Atlantic region of the East Coast. Nine of these pairs laid eggs and pro-
duced 23 young, an average of nearly 2.6 young per successful pair. We
anticipate continued growth and expansion of this founding population,
and we believe that a self-sustaining wild population will be established
in the next few years,

In our western programmes, where remnant populations of anatum
Peregrines still exist, re-introduction (Table 7) has emphasised the direct
fostering of young and cliff-site hacking, with 199 and 209 young res-
pectively, being released by each of these methods. Hack towers are less
frequently constructed because of the preponderance of natural cliff
sites in suitable habitat, so only 51 young falcons have been released from
such towers, while cross-fostering to Prairie Falcon eyries has been used
for 35 young. Six chicks were released in urban areas. The above data
include 59 young hatched from wild eggs.

We have often been asked, 'What happens to young falcons once they
are released?' In a wild population the mortality rate for young Peregrines
has been calculated to be nearly 67% for the first year birds and about
20% for subadults (Young, 1969) (see also Lindberg, 1977). Mortality
rates for our hacked birds have been determined to be about 26%, with an
overall first year mortality of 66.7% (Barclay and Cade, 1983). Causes
for these losses during the hacking period are shown in Table 8. As can be
noted in the East, the three primary causes for losses of young Peregrines
at release sites are: premature dispersal, predation by Great Horned Owls
Bubo virginianus, and adult Peregrine harassment. During recent years,
whenever possible, we have endeavoured to avoid as potential hack sites
those areas which have demonstrated a high likelihood of owl predation
or possible harassment by adult Peregrines. In so doing, we have achieved
a survival rate for our hacked birds of nearly 90%. By continuing to be
selective in our choice of release sites, we believe we can maintain this
favourable survival rate in the future.
In the West, predation by Golden Eagles Aquila chrysaetos, as well as
Great Horned Owls, has accounted for the greatest losses of both adult
and juvenile Peregrines. Even though we try to avoid areas inhabited by
these two species, they continue to pose a serious threat to our release
efforts in the West.
In the Rocky Mountains and adjacent areas, thanks in large measure
to the production and release of large numbers of Peregrines over the
past eight years by our Fort Collins programme, many banded Peregrines
have been seen at natural eyries and release sites. In 1983, in Colorado
alone, there were 13 locations where adult or subadult Peregrines def-
ended territories, and for the first time in many years two historical
eyrie sites were re-occupied (W. Burnham, 1983). We are also pleased to
report additional encouraging data from the Pacific Coast. Historically,
a population of approximately 17 nesting pairs of Peregrines occupied
cliffs on the central coast of California. By the early 1970s this number
had dwindled to one or two non-producing pairs. Following intensive fos-
tering efforts by the Predatory Bird Research Group at Santa Cruz, over
10 pairs and four single birds could be found in this same area by 1982
(Cade and Dague, 1982).
We believe that the Peregrine Fund and its co-operators have con-
tributed significantly towards arresting the decline in Peregrine popula-
tions in the continental U.S. We have already witnessed an increase in
breeding pairs and in the production of wild young. It appears that this
population build-up, increased production and re-occupation of tradi-
tional eyrie sites, as well as colonization of new areas, may parallel the
initial phases of recovery observed in Peregrine populations in Great

Britain and Europe (Ratcliffe, 1980).
Cade (1980) has summarized the basic biological requirements neces-
sary to establish captive-produced Peregrines in the wild. Released birds
must possess: 1) behavioural patterns allowing social interaction and
reproduction to occur in the wild; 2) strong site specific attachment to
areas where they are released; 3) migratory habits allowing them to breed
successfully in release areas; and 4) a survival potential comparable to a
wild falcon. Finally, 5) the environment must be sufficiently free of
pollutants and harmful chemicals to allow released Peregrines to live and
breed successfully. Based upon our re-introduction results, it is reasonable
to assume that the first four requirements have been attained. There is
still serious concern, however, that chemical residues in the environment
may continue to interfere with reproduction, particularly in the western
regions of the United States.
Early reports indicate that 1984 has been exceptionally productive
both in the breeding chambers and in the wild. Preliminary production
data indicate that during this past season approximately 266 captive-
bred Peregrines were reared at our combined facilities. To this figure must
be added 71 young produced from wild eggs incubated in our laboratories
making a grand total of 337 young Peregrines - more than in any previous
year. Of this number 333 were added to the wild population, the remain-
der being held for breeding stock.
Additional encouraging news has reached us from the field. In the
East, where our founding population has continued to increase since our
first success in 1980, we have reports of 27 established pairs of Peregrines
in addition to 11 single birds on territory, for a total of 65 birds seen.
Sixteen of these pairs attempted to breed in 1984, and 12 were successful.
Thirty wild young were produced for an average of 2.5 young per success-
ful nesting attempt.

The Eastern White Stork (Fig. 1) is considered to be one of the most
endangered members of the stork family, Ciconiidae. Although once ab-
undant in Japan and Korea, the species has been extirpated from both
countries. The main breeding area for the stork is south-eastern Siberia,
where Russian scientists estimate the population to be 400-500 nesting
pairs (S. Smirenskii, pers. comm.). Chinese scientists undertook a heli-
copter survey in the northern province of Heilongjong, China, in spring
1984, and counted over 100 of the Eastern White Storks. Several nests
were also located (D. Parish, pers. comm.). The Chinese have also found a
major wintering area - Shengjin Lake in Anhui Province - where approxi-
mately 270 birds were counted in the winters of 1982-83 and 1983-84
(Wang Qishan, pers. comm.).
The last wild bird in Japan was captured in 1971. In Korea in the same
year a breeding pair was discovered in Umsung. Prior to this discovery,
the stork was presumed extinct in that country. According to the local
people, the pair had been nesting there for forty years! Unfortunately,
three days after the historic discovery, the male was killed by a local
hunter.
Although breeding storks no longer occur in Japan and Korea, winter
migrants are often reported from several locations. Some storks winter
further south, along the south-eastern coast of mainland China. One bird

Eastern White Storks in captivity
Two birds from the original population in Japan are still maintained
in captivity. Ten additional storks in Japanese zoos and aviaries were
either caught as wintering birds or were imported from China. The female
stork whose mate was killed in 1971 was caught in 1983 and has been

kept at the Grand Park Zoo (Kim, pers. comm.). Three storks were seen
in the Peking Zoo in the spring of 1984 (Luthin, pers. comm.), but no
more information is available. San Diego Zoo received four storks from
China in 1982, of which three survive (A. Risser, pers. comm.).
The species has never bred in captivity, despite earnest efforts, parti-
cularly by the Japanese. Following a drastic population decline in the
1950s and 1960s due to injury and sickness caused by pesticides, the
Japanese began an intensive propagation programme in 1963. Sadly, the
birds captured in these two decades have had numerous health problems,
undoubtedly related to heavy mercury contamination, and thus have
not been healthy enough for pairing and breeding. A hybrid was produced,
however, between an Eastern White Stork and a European White Stork.
With the exception of the storks in Japan and China, the captive birds
in other countries have been too young for breeding, as the storks in East
and West Germany and the Soviet Union were brought to the zoos as
young birds.
The storks at the Vogelpark Walsrode were provided by the Soviet
Government for initiation of a captive propagation programme for con-
servation purposes. A conservation plan was developed between the Soviet
Government and the International Crane Foundation (USA) in summer,
1979. Two pre-fledged chicks arrived at the Vogelpark in July 1980, and
an additional ten (two adults, eight chicks) arrived in June 1981. The
chicks were collected from separate nests along the Lower Amur River
(Wennrich, 1982).
Sex determination
Bill length can in some, but not all, cases be used for sex differentiation;
i.e. males have longer bills than females. However, 42% of the sample (four
males, four females) had culmens of intermediate length, and culmen
length alone was insufficient for determining sex. An even greater indivi-
dual variability is noted in the length of the tarsus. Fifty percent (six
males, six females) of the total sample fell within the intermediate range;
there was some separation by sex, however (see Fig. 2). Both male and
female of the confirmed pair at Vogelpark had culmens and tarsi of nearly
equal length, and this character alone is insufficient to distinguish the two.
There exists a slight sexual difference in bill-clattering behaviour. The
female of a known pair, as well as two unpaired females were observed ex-
tending their necks forward towards males and clattering very quietly and
slowly (fig. 3). Data are being analysed to determine quantitative beha-
vioural differences between sexes.
Sex determination from analysis of the droppings has been perfected
for the Eastern White Stork, and this technique would undoubtedly work

is a greater risk to the birds, especially in light of the fact that the birds
are quite nervous by nature.

The eleven storks at Vogelpark Walsrode range in age from three to
eight years. Since February 1983, when an individual was killed by its
supposed mate, the birds have been partitioned into individual cages to
avoid further aggressive interactions. Prior to that time, the young birds
had been maintained together in small groups and presumed pairs.
Although the European White Stork is known to pair at two years and
lay eggs at three, the age of first-breeding of the larger Eastern White Stork
is unknown, although a slower maturation is suspected for this large
northern ciconiiform. Believing that at three years old, the birds may be
able to pair, the Vogelpark initiated an intensive research/management
plan for the storks in the winter of 1984.
Cages
The storks are held in individual enclosures isolated from public view-
ing, measuring 14 x 4 x 3.8 m. A wooden shelter 4 x 3 x 2.2 m is common
to two adjacent pens, and can be subdivided to accommodate a pair. Adja-
cent pens have three doors in common: one outside the shelter and two
inside. This arrangement makes it easy to bring the pair together for care-
ful observations. Within the entire enclosure unit, storks and cranes are
placed alternately to avoid intra-specific fighting and to allow establish-
ment of individual territories.

Perches

<bodyText confidence="0.999035545454545" page_id="56953601"  page_num="97" year="" vol="">
A perch was provided for each stork. A log approximately 5-6 cm in
diameter and 4 m long was placed parallel to the back fence. Six of 11
birds quickly accepted the perch, and they preferred to roost on the perch
instead of the ground. The other five never used the perches at all. Perhaps
a stork is not so adept at using a narrow perch, but rather needs a flatter,
broader surface. The Eastern White Stork often perches on rooftops and
electric power lines, where flat surfaces are provided. One small advantage
to the use of a perch is that those birds accustomed to using a perch were
also quick to utlise a nest when provided, but birds which did not perch
took much longer to become used to using a nest platform. The perching
birds also seemed more calm than those which did not perch.

Nest Platforms
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992263423076923" page_id="56953601"  page_num="97" year="" vol="">
Nest platforms appear to be of critical important for storks to develop
pair-bonds. Males of the European White Stork return to their nests prior
to the arrival of the females in the spring. A week or two later the females
arrive. The female is believed to select the male based on the nest alone!
At first, males tend to chase females away, but persistent females even-
tually are accepted, and copulation on the nest ensues (B. Schmitt, pers.
comm.).
The nest platforms of the Eastern White Stork at Vogelpark are larger
than those usually used for the European storks, measuring 2 m in dia-
meter, and placed approximately 1.3 m above the ground, allowing at
least 2.5 m 'head room' for copulation. The base is slotted for drainage.
The nests were 'started' for each pair early in the season, and placed in
the cage of the male. Long branches of 2-3 cm diameter were weaved
through vertical sticks nailed to the side of the nest. Smaller twigs and
straw were placed inside the fabricated nests. After the bird accepted a
nest, twigs and straw were provided regularly from late March to early
May. In addition to the twigs, storks often took evergreen branches,
fresh grass and feathers to the nests.
Diet
The young storks were fed minced fish, one-day old chicks from which
heads, feathers and legs were removed, beef hearts and live worms.
Supplementary vitamins and calcium were provided. As adults, the birds
receive whole fish and day-old chicks. At the start of the breeding season,
additional calcium powder and multi-vitamins are provided. Birds are
fed daily at midday. More fish and chicks are eaten during the peak of
the breeding season, after which the intake falls to normal.

Observations of pairing activities
The Eastern White Stork seems very particular in its mate selection.
During spring 1984, despite numerous attempt to establish pairs, only
one certain pair was formed from the 11 individuals. The sequence of
events was as follows:
(a) Originally, the two birds were maintained in distant pens within the
facility. The distant male, however, responded to the female's bill-clat-
tering with his own clattering. The date was 20th January.
(b) On 24th February, the male and female were moved closer to each
other, where one corner of their pens touched. The birds often met at
this corner and frequently bill-clattered together. Due to their nearly
identical appearance, it was then still difficult to discern what sex they
were. In fact, since the female was much more active than the male, it
was presumed that she was a male, and vice versa! The male clattered by
himself on 28th February, and the female followed suit.
(c) On 6th March the birds were moved to adjacent pens and a nest
platform was placed in the male's enclosure. He came up on to the nest
almost immediately and started nest-building. The two birds often stood
beside each other at the fence, still regularly clattering together and at
this time they allo-preened through the fence. What appeared to be a
'frustrated copulation' by the male (I shall refer to this as 'intentional
copulation') was performed in front of the female on 8th March (see
fig. 3). The male, although at first rather inactive, became increasingly
aggressive and active with nest ownership.
(d) On 9th March, the door between the pens was opened. Despite good
compatibility through the fence, the male was at first aggressive towards
the female, and the female fearful, when put together. The storks were
separated during the nights, and allowed to be together during the days.
On 12th March the female was exchanged with the male, to test her
reaction to the nest. She perched near the nest, but never landed on it.
Until early May, the male and female were allowed to interact during
the day, but were separated at night. The female never seemed interested
in nesting, and the male appeared 'frustrated'.
(e) On 7th May, two artificial eggs were placed on the nest. The male
immediately started incubating. Simultaneously his aggression disappeared,
and the female tended to approach him more often. Finally, the door
was allowed to be kept continuously open between the pens.
(f) On 15th May the female came to the nest for the first time, and again
on 18th May. Her clattering was answered by the male. From that day
on, the female roosted on the nest; however, she seemed uninterested in
the eggs.
(g) On 23rd May, a hatching egg of the European White Stork was put in

the nest. The male incubated the egg through the night, but abandoned it
in the morning.
(h) The egg was removed, and later the male attempted to copulate with
the female. By that time, the female was completely comfortable at the
nest. The pair nest-built, allo-preened, and bill-clattered together. The male
mounted the female several times on 25th May, but the female was un-
receptive. However, the pair-bond has persisted through the summer.
Since the male is six and the female three years old, it is presumed that
the female is still too young to begin breeding, and hence, despite good
pairing, did not respond to the male's initiatives. Nonetheless, we are quite
hopeful for next year.
In the European Stork, the female seems to select her mate (B. Schmitt
pers. comm.). Two Eastern White Stork females at the Vogelpark also
respond to particular males with mutual clattering. Perhaps, as with its
close cousin the European White Stork, females of this species also select
their mates. We hope to learn more in the coming season at Vogelpark.
Summary of management recommendations
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99691625" page_id="56953603"  page_num="99" year="" vol="">
(1) Whereas the European White Stork is somewhat colonial, the Eastern
White Stork appears to be a solitary nester (although there are reports of
semi-colonial nesting (Y. Shibaev, pers. comm.)). The storks seem to do
better and are less aggressive if separated from their own kind.
(2) Careful observation of the storks is important for proper pair-forma-
tion. Observations should be made from a blind (hide), as the species is
quite shy and behaves unnaturally in the presence of humans.
(3) There is a good chance that a high level of aggression may be demon-
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.934495125" page_id="56953603"  page_num="99" year="" vol="">
strated prior to the formation of a good pair. Extreme caution should be
exercised to ensure adequate time for the birds to become comfortable
with each other, and ample space should be provided when birds are in-
troduced together, to allow for 'escape' room if aggression is initially
demonstrated. It has been observed that there is no aggression in the
European White Stork once a pair is formed. The only incident of 'mate-
killing' was when a female, behaving abnormally due to a brain tumour,
was killed by her mate. It is suggested that this abnormal behaviour may
have suggested an intruder to the male (B. Schmitt, pers. comm.).
Aggression is known between individuals of the same sex in the Euro-
pean White Stork, and two incidents of same-sex killings have been
reported from Japan (K. Vos, pers. comm.; Komiya, 1982).
(4) Perches may serve some useful function for the Eastern White Stork.
The perches were used by some and not by others. The individuals that
used the perches seemed to adjust to the presence of a nest much sooner
than those that used no perch. Perhaps a flat surface could serve a better

perch than a thin log. Perches are not necessary if a nest is present.
(5) A nest is probably very important for pair-bonding. The nest helps
promote the development of the pair, and stimulates territoriality and
the brooding urge. Since copulation occurs on the nest, at least 2.5 m
should be allowed overhead. Nest diameter can be between 1.5 and 2.0 m.
Nest materials should be provided continuously.
(6) An abundance of food should be provided to the storks at the onset
of the breeding season, as they consume more food at this time. At the
Strasbourg Zoo in France, one of the most successful stork centres of
Europe, the White Stork diet includes fish, one-day old chicks, cooked
pork liver, chicken feet, necks and heads, vitamins and calcium (B. Schmitt,
pers. comm.).
(7) A studbook for the storks is being developed at the Vogelpark Wals-
rode. Based on information from questionnaires that I sent to zoos and
from known locations of these birds, I have located a minimum of 38
Eastern White Storks in captivity (see Table 1). If a successful re-introduc-
tion programme is developed for the species, those organisations which
hold storks must co-operate to ensure careful and responsible genetic
management to produce a population for release.

(8) Continuous research on seasonal activity patterns, courtship and
breeding behaviour should be promoted for both captive and wild
Eastern White Storks in order to increase chances for successful breeding
in captivity, and to further develop a careful conservation programme for
the species.
Summary
Proper management techniques should result in successful captive
breeding. The ultimate goal of a propagation programme for the Eastern
White Stork is for future release into suitable habitat where it once oc-
curred, including Japan and Korea. As part of its comprehensive plan for
the species, Vogelpark Walsrode has begun developing captive management
techniques, is working closely with Soviet and Chinese scientists to learn
more about the wild stork populations, and has already contacted organi-
sations, scientists and zoos in Korea and Japan to initiate steps for the
future re-introduction of the rare storks into these countries. Protected,
pesticide-free habitat needs to be located, and the mechanisms of the
re-introduction programme are being worked out. Much can be learned
from the experience of the European Stork stations, which have had a
high degree of success with stork release projects (K. Vos, B. Schmitt,
pers. comm.).
We are hopeful that our understanding of this formerly little-known
species will help to build a good breeding programme in captivity, and that our
efforts will benefit this endangered species.

THE HAWAIIAN GOOSE Branta sandvicensis IN THE 1980s
By JANET KEAR

(The Wildfowl Trust, Martin Mere, Lancashire)
The success of attempts to breed the Hawaiian Goose or Nene in
captivity in England at Slimbridge and in Hawaii at Pohakuloa is probably
well known (Kear and Berger, 1980). From a low point, reached during
the 1940s, of less than 50 individuals in the world, the population has
risen to something over 2500. Hawaiian Geese are now fairly common in
zoos and avicultural collections and appear to be doing well there. In the
wild, however, the situation is not so encouraging.
Between 1949 and 1982, 1779 birds were reared in captivity in Hawaii
and 1071 by the Wildfowl Trust. Since 1960, 1808 of these geese have
been released into the wild, 1319 on the big island of Hawaii and 489 on
the nearby island of Maui. On Maui, a substantial proportion of the birds
came from England, reared either at Slimbridge or in Norfolk by Jack
Williams with whom some of the Wildfowl Trust birds had been placed on
loan. In addition, many hundreds of Hawaiian Geese have been bred by
private aviculturists since the early 1970s when the species became gener-
ally available.
The release of captive-bred birds into sanctuary areas in the uplands of
Maui and Hawaii was successful at first in increasing the estimated wild
population on Hawaii to 450 in 1972 and to 650 by 1977. On Maui, esti-
mations suggested that there were 150-200 in 1975, and between 225 and
325 in 1977 (all the Maui birds had been reared in captivity or were the
offspring of such birds, whereas some truly wild stock had still remained
on the island of Hawaii). Because of the apparent breeding success of the
birds that had been set free, and the increase in population size, releases
of captive-reared Nene slowed down after 1976.
Then in the late 1970s, numbers on both islands declined; by
1980 only 300 geese were estimated to be present on Hawaii and 100-
150 on Maui (Devick, 1982). Investigations suggested that this was
because half the adults were failing to breed every year, the goslings were
suffering high mortality perhaps during adverse weather conditions, and
there was heavy predation on eggs and incubating females (Stone et al,
1983). The Hawaiian Goose population now breeds almost exclusively in
the highlands where there is relatively little clement weather compared
with the lowlands, to which the birds used to move to breed in the old
days, and where the food supply may be deficient. Poor nutrition may be
the reason why only a small proportion of the potential population nests

every year, and could also contribute to the low gosling survival.
A recovery plan has been formulated (US Fish and Wildlife Service,
1983) and includes the recommendation that a predator control pro-
gramme, to reduce the numbers of mongooses, should be introduced.
Nutritional requirements of young and old geese need to be known, release
sites at lower elevations should be sought, release techniques need to be
improved and, most importantly, captive-reared Nene must continue to be

A BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE STATUS OF ENDANGERED
PHEASANTS IN CAPTIVITY
By KEITH HOWMAN
(Shepperton, Middlesex)
BLYTH'S TRAGOPAN Tragopan blythii
The Blyth's Tragopan pheasant comes from the thick, leech-infested

forests of Nagaland and neighbouring Manipur, in north-eastern India on
the border with Burma. The reasons for its endangered category are princi-
pally based on its limited distribution in a politically sensitive area. Al-
though reasonably well distributed in captivity on the Continent prior to
World War II, they died out, to all intents and purposes, during that period
though the last cock bird survived for a further 20 years or so. In 1983
two pairs were sent to Britain from Kohima in Nagaland where they have
around 15 in captivity. They bred in 1984. Due to small egg clutches of
4-5 eggs, building up large numbers in captivity will be difficult and slow.
At present there would be no grounds or necessity for reintroduction.

CABOT'S TRAGOPAN T caboti
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.987696696969697" page_id="56953608"  page_num="104" year="" vol="">
From south-eastern China in the mountain forests of Fokien, the
Cabot's Tragopan is the most easterly in distribution of the group. Like
the Blyth's Tragopan, they almost died out in captivity during World
War II.
A small group was maintained at the Pheasant Trust based on birds
sent over from Hong Kong by Dr. K.C. Searle. This group was distribu-
ted in 1977/78 to America, Germany and Belgium. Those in America
have been very successfully propagated, partly by artificial insemination,
and good numbers have been reared during the past two years.
Whilst the 1979 World Pheasant Association's Census showed just
12 Cabot's Tragopans in captivity, this number increased to 50 by 1982
and there must now be double that number, which is encouraging.
The status of the Cabot's Tragopan in China is at present uncertain.
WESTERN TRAGOPAN T. melanocephalus
This is certainly the rarest of the Tragopans and is now principally
located along the cease-fire line between India and Pakistan in Kashmir,
and in Himachal Pradesh where, fortunately, it is included within the
area recommended for a new National Park.
It is the only Tragopan to have proved really difficult in captivity.
A few were bred in France in the period from 1864-1893 but they died
out completely from around then onwards. Since that time only three
specimens have reached Europe alive. A pair was sent to the Pheasant
Trust in the 1960s, but the cock died soon after arrival. The hen sur-
vived for several years, laid eggs and even produced chicks when crossed
with a Temminck's Tragopan. One further cock bird reached Antwerp in
1981 but only survived for a few months.
Two years of field studies were carried out for the World Pheasant
Association in 1982 and 1983 by Kamal Islam who recorded over 100
sightings.
A project is in hand to make a further attempt to establish them in
captivity during the next few years. However, breeding them in really
large numbers will never be possible since, like all the Tragopans, egg
production is limited.

It was first reared in captivity in 1913 but became scarce princi-
pally as a result of two world wars. In the 1950s a small importation of
new stock, by the Pheasant Trust, led to a major revival in their num-
bers which continue to hold up well though they declined by over 100
between 1979 and 1982. Five hundred and thirty-two were recorded
at the 1982 World Pheasant Association's Census and the same comments
on the rearing of large numbers apply as for the Hume's and Elliot's
Pheasants (see below).
ELLIOT'S PHEASANT S. ellioti
The Elliot's Pheasant is found only in China, in evergreen, broad-
leaved forest in the south-east. Little of the original forest remains and
it is undoubtedly under pressure though it may be within some of the
newer forest reserves but this is unconfirmed.
The last pheasant census in 1982 recorded 847 in captivity, a drop of
300 since 1979. The majority relate back to birds imported before
World War II though two cock birds were imported in 1974 to the Pheas-
ant Trust and produced many offspring, and more recently two cocks and
a hen were imported by San Diego Zoo. Good fertility resulted from the
new importations but fertility generally is low - around 55% compared
to the norm of 90% in the wild. Chicks tend to be very wild and active
on hatching but usually rear quite easily.
This is a hardy species and easily kept in captivity. Like many other
pheasant species, it suffers from inbreeding though this could easily be
overcome by aviculturists taking more trouble in making up pairs. The
breeding of viable numbers for a re-introduction project would be per-
fectly feasible.

HUME'S BAR-TAILED PHEASANT Syrmaticus humiae
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996716583333333" page_id="56953609"  page_num="105" year="" vol="">
Hume's Bar-tailed Pheasant is the third of the pheasants in this genus
to be listed as endangered. Though first found in Manipur just over 100
years ago, Burma forms the largest part of its distribution and for this
reason there is little recent information on it.
In 1962 the late F.E.B. Johnson imported a few pairs to his Stagsden
Bird Gardens in Bedfordshire; he was successful with them immediately
and at the last census there were 527 birds distributed between over 10
countries.
Hume's Bar-tailed Pheasant belongs to the same group of pheasants as
Elliot's and is very similar in behaviour in captivity. So long as existing
stocks are maintained in a sound genetic manner, then breeding viable
numbers for re-introduction should not be a problem.

<bodyText confidence="0.999407590909091" page_id="56953610"  page_num="106" year="" vol="">
The distribution of the Cheer Pheasant through Pakistan, at the western
end of its range, through north-west India to central Nepal at the eastern
end, has probably always been patchy and non-contiguous.
This is the only pheasant of its genus and it is unusual in that the cock
bird plays a major part in brooding and rearing the chicks and the family
behave very much as a covey. They keep well below the snowline and
appear to be attracted to the grass cutting and cultivation of man, making
them rather vulnerable to hunters. Their patchy distribution has not helped
them in their fight to survive man's ever upward move into the mountains
and there are now only a few pockets of them left in northern India, with
probably the best and safest population being in western Nepal. Fortunately
they do well in captivity and are the subject of a most encouraging re-in-
troduction project in the Margalla Hill, north of Islamabad, Pakistan. Over
50 poults were released in 1983 and a similar number is hoped for in 1984.
There were frequent sightings of small coveys of Cheer Pheasants in the
release area from August 1983 through to April 1984.
It is hoped that a full field study of them in Uttar Pradesh, In northern
India,will get underway in 1985. At present the World Pheasant Associ-
ation maintains a flock of around 60 birds for the production of eggs for
the Margalla Hills project. In 1982 the numbers in captivity were around
460, and an excess of 300 eggs per annum have been despatched to Pakis-
tan for some eight years.

These magnificent birds come from western China in the area from the
province of Szechuan through to Tibet at the eastern end of their range
where they were unmolested by the Buddist population.
The first recorded pair in captivity goes back to 1891 but they did not
become firmly established in captivity until the 1970s when Jersey Zoo
played a major role in establishing them.
They are reasonably prolific layers, but fertility does seem to be variable
and it could be that pairing them in aviaries throughout the year is not
good practice.
With 434 recorded at the last World Pheasant Association census (a
25% increase in three years), there is little doubt that it would be possible
to obtain good numbers of fertile eggs if the need and opportunity for a
re-introduction project arose.

survived for over a century from a gene base of three birds in 1865 and
one further cock bird in 1890.
Undoubtedly the Brown Eared became very tame and imprinted on
man and fertility was poor. However, in 1976 the World Pheasant Associ-
ation initiated a project to use artificial insemination with them. This was
extremely successful and showed that this technique could be used at any
time to boost numbers and ensure mixed bloodlines. Numbers in captivity
are now around 564.

CHINESE MONAL Lophophorus chuysi
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.985162238095238" page_id="56953611"  page_num="107" year="" vol="">
The Chinese Monal has a smallish distribution area in the mountains of
south-east Kokonar and western Szechuan at around 12-16,000 ft, over
2,000 ft above the White Eared Pheasants in the same area.
Very few specimens have ever come into captivity in the West, but in
1983 a pair were imported by San Diego Zoo and four chicks were hatched
in 1984. These represent the only known captive stock of this large and
endangered game bird though presumably others are in captivity in China.
However, there is probably no reason why numbers should not be built up
in a similar fashion to the Himalayan Monal of which there are over 1,300
in captivity, but it will take time and some additional stock will be neces-
sary to prevent inbreeding.
SCLATER'S MONAL L. sclateri
The Sclater's Monal takes over in distribution where the Himalayan
Monal ceases in northern Assam, and then eastwards across the Indian
border into China. Whilst it has been well recorded in the wild, only one
cock bird has been recorded in captivity although a report was received
some years ago of a pair in the Rangoon Zoo.
As with the Chinese Monal, there is no known reason why Sclater's
should not do well in captivity and the failure to do so is probably due
only to the fact that this species lives in an inaccessible area and its
comparatively sparse distribution has not provided the opportunity.

The Bulwer's Pheasant is one of the most recent additions to the en-

In captivity it is proving to be one of the more difficult species. Al-

and the first recorded captive breeding was only in 1973 by Dr. Estu-
dillo Lopez in Mexico. They were also bred by Charles Sivelle in America
in 1975 but since then there has been little real breeding success though

they have survived reasonably well and numbers increased from 36 in
1979 to 59 in 1982.
We need to learn far more about this species before it would be prac-
tical to set up a re-introduction project. In the meantime, protection of
their forest habitat is of prime importance.
EDWARDS' PHEASANT L. edwardsi
Though discovered in 1895 it was not until 1923 that this species
was first brought into captivity in the West when Dr. Jean Delacour
shipped 15 birds to Cleres and bred from four cocks and three hens
which he retained in 1925.
The stock today is all derived from those original birds. Genetic
degeneration began to show up seriously in the 1970s and a Stud Book
was started by the World Pheasant Association. The resulting attention
to genetics created an immediate increase in numbers which was still
continuing at the time of the 1982 census when 690 were recorded in
captivity. There is little doubt that if a good number of pairs was
collected together, considerable numbers could be reared and further
improvement would be made to the stock.
IMPERIAL PHEASANT L. imperials
This species was discovered and named by Dr. Jean Delacour in 1923.
Only one pair was captured and they bred successfully at Cleres in 1924.
The original cock bird was lost, along with the entire collection, in 1939
after the outbreak of war.
Sadly, there are now no pure survivors of this species in captivity
though specimens that look identical, produced from crossing cock birds
with a Silver Hen, still survive. Twenty-four of these reconstituted birds
remained alive in 1982.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991506631578947" page_id="56953613"  page_num="109" year="" vol="">
This species is found only on the island of Palawan at the southern
end of the Philippines where logging is being carried out at a very intensive
level at present, stopping only for hurricanes to go by. None of this bodes
well for the survival of the Palawan Peacock Pheasant, nor does its appar-
ently unrestricted export.
There are reasonable numbers (around 500) in captivity and their survi-
val is, therefore, reasonably assured. However, a species that lays only 1-2
eggs in a clutch can never be captive-bred in very large numbers, and it is
to be hoped that steps to ensure its protection in Palawan will be taken
before it is too late.
CRESTED ARGUS Rheinartia o. ocellata
Rheinard's Crested Argus is the nominate race of the two pheasants
in this group, the other subspecies being the Malayan Crested Argus R.o.
nigrescens, on which Geoffrey Davison did some excellent fieldwork.
Neither subspecies is at present represented in captivity. It is likely
that, as with the Great Argus, clutch size is restricted to two and that the
birds take three years to mature. Captive breeding of large numbers would,
therefore, never be practical and this is another species whose long-term
survival is really dependent on the survival of their habitat.

THE CAPTIVE PROGRAMME FOR THE ENDANGERED
PUERTO RICAN PARROT Amazona vittata
By JAMES W. WILEY

(US Fish and Wildlife Service, Palmer, Puerto Rico)
The Puerto Rican Parrot is one of the world's most critically endan-
gered birds. When Columbus arrived in 1493, the species was abundant
throughout Puerto Rico and three offshore islands (Mona, Culebra, Vie-
ques); however, parrot populations declined precipitously when European
colonists began cutting forests to cultivate the land. Habitat destruction
was undoubtedly the primary cause of the parrot's decline, but many other
factors (e.g. natural and introduced predators and competitors, as well as
pet-taking) figured importantly in the near loss of the species (Snyder,
1978; Wiley, 1980). By 1975 only 13 parrots survived in the wild and were
confined to the 11,000 hectare Caribbean National Forest in eastern
Puerto Rico. This population has slowly responded to intensive research
and management, and it now numbers about 30 birds. Still, this extremely
small population could suffer 'overnight' extinction from disease or a
hurricane. This vulnerability has made the captive propagation programme
crucial to recovery of the species.
The captive programme
The current conservation programme was started in 1968. It is a co-op-
erative effort of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), the US
Forest Service and the Department of Natural Resources of the Common-
wealth of Puerto Rico. A captive propagation project was initiated in 1971
as security against the complete loss of the species in the wild and to pro-
vide an additional source of young birds to augment production of the
wild population. The first captive efforts were conducted at the FWS Patu-
xent Wildlife Research Center in Maryland, USA, where two females dona-
ted by the Puerto Rico Zoo (Mayaguez) and one wild-caught adult male
were housed. In 1973, the emphasis of the programme was redirected from
capture of wild birds to more intensive efforts to rehabilitate the wild
population. At that time, the site of the captive programme was shifted to
Puerto Rico, and an aviary was established in the heart of their remaining
range in the Luquillo rain forest. The aviary's location was critical for
co-ordinating egg and chick transfers between captive and wild pairs. Many
of the chick and egg transfers must be made immediately and unless the
aviary support is close to the wild nest, such transfers would be impossible.

J.W. WILEY - PUERTO RICAN PARROT
The Puerto Rican Parrots are held within a concrete two-storey build-
ing as a precaution against vandalism and the frequent and severe tropical
storms. The building also houses a food preparation room, facilities for
incubating eggs and brooding chicks, a shop, and living quarters for staff.
Another aviary within the station compound, but isolated from the Puerto
Rican Parrot facility, contains a flock of Hispaniolan Parrots A. ventralis.
All parrots are kept under an artificial photoperiod system that can be
adjusted to stimulate breeding activities and thereby achieve egg-laying
synchrony with the wild parrots and between the captive Puerto Rican and
Hispaniolan flocks. The captives are fed foods consisting primarily of
fruits, vegetables, grains, and seeds. The captive parrots' diet is augmented
by seasonal wild foods (e.g. Sierra Palm Prestoea montand) from the rain
forest. Vitamin and mineral supplements are added to the diet daily.
The two surviving birds (the wild-caught male and one female) at Patu-
xent Wildlife Research Center were transferred to the Puerto Rico aviary
in 1977. Since that time, the captive flock has grown to 27 birds through
harvesting wild eggs and chicks, and retention of some captive-produced
chicks when they could not be fostered into wild nests. Acquisitions from
the wild are used to maximise genetic diversity or to save eggs or chicks in
situations where survival was judged hopeless (e.g. nest desertion). To
minimise impact on the wild population, no additional adult wild birds
have been taken into captivity.
During the recovery programme's early years, many parrot eggs were
transferred from wild nests to the aviary to safeguard the eggs against loss
to Pearly-eyed Thrasher Margarops fuscatus and Black Rat Rattus rattus
predation as well as to avoid egg-fouling in nests with moisture problems.
Dummy eggs were substituted in the nests to maintain incubation beha-
viour in the adult birds until chicks were returned to the nest cavity. The
parrot eggs were incubated in artificial incubators, and chicks were hand-
reared for about one week or until they showed good vigour and health.
Most predation and leaky nest problems have now been solved (Snyder &amp;
Taapken, 1978; Wiley, 1980; Wiley, in press). Eggs are normally left in
the cavities, although nests are checked frequently and watched as often
as possible from nearby hides.
Captive production
Production by the captive flock of Puerto Rican Parrots has been disap-
pointingly low. All mature females have produced eggs, but only two have
formed successful pair bonds that resulted in fertile eggs. Several problems
have plagued the captive programme, including a biased sex ratio (many
more females than males), poor pair bonding, and incorrectly sexed birds.
Accurate and safe sexing techniques have now been developed (Erb and

Bercovitz, 1980). Also, the addition of birds has improved the sex ratio of
adults (3+ years) to a more favourable nine females to six males. However,
adult behavioural problems continue to impede the captive breeding effort.
Since 1978 when the first fertile eggs were produced, a total of 46 eggs
have now been laid by two females. Of these, 61% (n = 28) have hatched
and 82% of the chicks (n= 23) have survived to fledge. Because a main ob-
jective of the captive programme is to augment wild production, ideally all
captive-produced chicks would be fostered in wild nests. A total of 13
captive-produced chicks have fledged from wild nests. However, only two
to four wild nests are active each year and normally one or two chicks can
be fostered into each nest. When foster nests in the wild were not available,
captive-produced chicks (n = 11) have been retained in captivity as pros-
pective breeders. In the future, free-flying juveniles will be released into
the forest under controlled conditions so that they are gradually 'weaned'
from human care and integrated into the wild. Experiment results using
captive-reared Hispaniolan Parrots released in the Dominican Republic
suggest that similar techniques could be applicable for the Puerto Rican
Parrot (Wiley, 1983). Development of such techniques is also critical to
future re-introductions of Puerto Rican Parrots in restored parts of its
former range.
Use of substitute species
Ironically,^we have had much better success with breeding the closely-
related Hispaniolan Parrots. New pairs have formed easily and we have had
to partially limit their production at times. The Hispaniolan Parrot flock
consists of six breeding pairs and 22 non-breeding young. These parrots
are used to test the safety, reliability and effectiveness of new procedures
and techniques prior to their application to the endangered Puerto Rican
Parrots. This includes determining proper doses of medications, developing
sexing techniques, refining nutritional regimes, developing artificial incuba-
tion temperatures, and experiments to mount radio telemetry packages
and training birds to accept them (Wiley and Gee, 1981).
Hispaniolan Parrots have also been used in experiments to determine
methods of increasing Puerto Rican Parrot egg and chick production. Two
types of replacement clutches have been induced in captive parrots:

(1) 'Double clutching', where the entire clutch is removed soon after it is
completed and the bird replaces it with a second set of eggs, and
(2) 'Sequential clutching' (Wiley, 1983). At least some Amazona parrots

are indeterminate layers, so that if each egg is taken as it is laid, the female
will lay a replacement egg. The average size of unmanipulated clutches of
the captive Hispaniolan Parrots is 3.7 +/- 0.2 (S.E.) eggs (range 2-5; n = 19
clutches). Double-clutching resulted in an average increase of 111% more

eggs (mean 7.8 +/- 0.5; min-max 6-9; n = 6) than in unmanipulated clutches.
Sequential removal experiments produced an average of 222% more eggs
(mean 11.9 +/- 2.3; min-max 4-21; n = 8) than control clutches.
After these experiments, comparable trials were performed on captive
Puerto Rican Parrots with similar results. Whole-clutch removal resulted in
an average increase of 90% more eggs (mean 5.7 +/- 0.4 eggs/clutch; min-
max 4-7; n = 13) over unmanipulated clutches (mean 3.0 +/- 0.3; min-max
1-5; n = 14). An average increase of 170% more eggs (mean 8.1 +/- 0.9;
min-max, 5-12; n = 9) than in normal clutches were produced by sequen-
tial removal of eggs. Replacement clutching manipulations are now also
done when needed at wild parrot nests, because of these successes.
Captive Hispaniolan Parrots serve as foster parents for both wild and
captive Puerto Rican Parrot eggs and chicks (Wiley, 1983). Although we
have techniques for artificial incubation of eggs, using foster birds for that
task is more reliable because artificial incubators are subject to egg-damag-
ing temperature changes caused by fluctuations in electrical power at the
remote aviary. Hispaniolan Parrots are used as foster parents because they
do a better job than human handlers in rearing Puerto Rican chicks. His-
paniolan Parrot eggs and chicks in turn are given to inexperienced Puerto
Rican Parrot pairs so that they can practice and improve their parental
techniques. However, it is still necessary to hand-rear some chicks that
require attention to injuries, parasites, or that cannot be placed into a
nest either because they are are not of the right age or ne#t space is un-
available.
Perhaps the most important use of the Hispaniolan Parrots has been
to provide captive-produced chicks for temporary replacement of Puerto
Rican Parrot chicks at wild nests. Each wild nest is critical to the growth
of the wild population. If a problem at a wild nest endangers the eggs or
chicks, the Puerto Rican Parrot eggs or young are transferred to the
aviary for care. During this period, less valuable Hispaniolan Parrot eggs
(or artificial 'dummies' if the eggs are not close to hatching) or nestlings
are substituted in the nest until the problem is solved.
The Future
Captive propagation will continue to be a vital part of the recovery
programme for the Puerto Rican Parrot (Wiley and Gee, 1981). Artificial
insemination techniques are being developed at the Patuxent Wildlife
Research Center (using Senegal Parrots Poicephalus senegalus ) and at the
Puerto Rico Field Station aviary. Once perfected, this technique is expec-
ted to improve egg fertility among some pairs and among egg-laying, but
mateless females.

Rican Parrots will be made in the Luquillo Forest late in the 1985 breed-
ing season. We plan to follow these birds with radio telemetry. When the
wild population shows a very substantial growth (perhaps 200 pairs)
within the Luquillo Forest, a second aviary with a release facility will be
established in a distant forest in order to re-introduce a second wild popu-
lation.
The Puerto Rican Parrot has made slow, but promising progress toward
recovery. However, because the population has had fewer than 60 individ-
uals for at least 17 years, genetic diversity has become extremely restric-
ted. Rapid population growth is needed to reduce the probability that
genetic problems (e.g. decreased egg fertility, poor vitality of offspring)
will affect species fitness. At the same time, the conservation programme
must proceed with extreme caution to minimise mistakes that would limit
the parrot's recovery. With such a small population, the slightest error
could have long-lasting effects.

THE AVICULTURAL SOCIETY REGISTER OF BIRDS BRED
IN THE BRITISH ISLES BY AVICULTURAL SOCIETY MEMBERS

The above survey was first attempted for the 1973 breeding season.
Published in the July-August 1974 issue of the Magazine, it covered
312 forms bred by 60 contributors. This was an encouraging start, and the
compiler, Peter Brown, expressed the hope that more members would
report their breeding results for 1974. This second effort listed 360 forms
bred by 86 contributors. These first two Breeding Registers had been in-
cluded in ordinary numbers of the Magazine; the 1976 Register was a slim
volume in its own right, with well over 500 forms bred by nearly 300 avi-
culturists.
At this stage four collators were involved in its production. If the
Register had continued to grow at this rate, it would eventually have
become a fairly complete survey of all non-domesticated birds bred under
controlled conditions in the British Isles. As such, it might have helped to
moderate some of the restrictive legislation that has appeared in recent
years, affecting the keeper of European species. The more birds that are
seen to be bred, the more aviculture will be seen as a force for conserva-
tion rather than a consumer of wildlife. Unfortunately, the novelty of
having one's breeding results published seems to have worn off, for a
great many people. Only 35 breeders have contributed to the 1983 Reg-
ister which I am collating at present. Many people may be afraid of having
their birds stolen if their names and addresses are published. However, re-
quests for anonymity are always honoured, and even a long list of anony-
mous breeders would be better than nothing.
If even fewer breeding returns are submitted for 1984, it will not be
worth producing the Register, and an interesting and valuable exercise
will have come to an unnecessary end. So please , British members, if you
bred any birds in 1984, send details either to the Hon. Secretary or
directly to me. Thank you.

CAPTIVE BREEDING PROGRAMME FOR THE MOST
ENDANGERED IBIS IN THE WORLD
By CHARLES LUTHIN
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994999617647059" page_id="56953621"  page_num="117" year="" vol="">
(Conservation Director, Vogelpark Walsrode, Germany)
With a known population of no more than 21 individuals, the Oriental
Crested Ibis Nipponia nippon is one of the most endangered avian species
in the world. In a major effort to safeguard the species from extinction,
the Chinese Government has developed a comprehensive research/manage-
ment/captive breeding programme for the species. This programme has res-
ulted from an historic meeting of government officials, scientists and zoo
personnel at the Peking Zoo during May 1984, in an attempt to assist the
last population of these birds.
The only known wild birds are found in Shaanxi Province, nesting at
1200 m in the Qinling Mountains. There, 17 birds have been located by
the Chinese scientists. One individual in the Peking Zoo and three at an
ibis breeding facility ('Toki Center') in Japan constitute the other known
individuals. Sadly, there has been no breeding success at the Japanese cen-
tre.
The ibis breeding facility has been designed and will be constructed at
the Peking Zoo in 1985. One or several eggs and/or chicks from the last
remaining nests of the ibis will be brought to the facility to supplement
the solitary bird already there. The Chinese Government has asked the
W.W. Brehm Fund for International Bird Conservation, West Germany, to
assist with this important undertaking. The Fund has developed an agree-
ment with the government whereby design and construction of the facility
will be financed in part by the Fund. Since the Vogelpark Walsrode (which
created the Fund) has had many years of breeding experience with numerous
species of ibises and spoonbills, it was an obvious choice to be asked for
assistance. Once the facility is constructed, the Fund will further help pro-
vide all necessary equipment and supplies for its operation. Additionally,
field researchers working on the Crested Ibis in its natural habitat have been
provided with research equipment and materials for their work in 1985.
The forthcoming breeding programme for the species may be a signifi-
cant step in the conservation of this extremely rare species, as its situation
in the wild is, at best, precarious. A conscientious captive programme can
supplement the very low numbers in the wild, and could in the future be
used in a release programme into suitable habitat.

When we appealed for contributions to this special issue, we could not
have foreseen that so many authors would respond so splendidly, from all
over the world, and we soon realised that it would be invidious to make a
selection for only a normal sized issue. The obvious solution was a double
issue, covering January-March and April-June, and in the course of prepa-
ration, two members offered to donate coloured plates which add greatly
to the importance of this issue.
We thank you for your patience and hope that you will feel that this
double issue was worth waiting for. We are sure that it will help to draw
attention to the very real contribution that aviculture is now making to
the conservation of rare species and that copies will also be bought by
many non-members.
We are indebted to many people for its realisation, above all, David
Coles whose enthusiasm and persistence have persuaded and encouraged
authors to write. Richard Daniels has sacrificed many hours of precious
painting time to read the proofs and has made valuable suggestions to
improve the text. The colour plates, which have been made possible by
the generosity of Dr. Henry Quinque and an anonymous member, have
greatly enhanced this issue. Most of all, we thank the authors, all busy
people, who have spent a lot of time working to contribute so much
original material.
In recent years, the populations of many avian species have declined
alarmingly in the wild and this issue illustrates a few of the successes
which are occurring in breeding captive stocks of endangered species. As
has been seen so often, the main cause for the decrease in numbers is the
destruction of the birds' natural habitat, due to deforestation and building
new roads and towns with accompanying industries. This trend is further
accentuated in the case of island species which have no possibility of
moving into a new environment - the plight of the Amazona island species
amply illustrates this point. Captive breeding must, in many cases, prove
to be the only form of survival and even the most ardent nature conserva-
tionists must concede that it is better for a species to continue under good
captive management than to die out altogether. There is always the
possibility of re-introduction to the original wild habitat, should the
circumstances become favourable, though this may be a forlorn hope in
many cases where the 'wild' no longer exists. So often the aims of avicul-
turists and conservationists have seemed to be at variance and we must
now hope that the two parties become reconciled and that captive manage-
ment and nature conservation work together for the same end.

Aviculturists would wish for a more flexible attitude on the part of
governments so that requests to import precious breeding stock can be
sympathetically received. No responsible aviculturist now would want to
see a return to large importations of rare species for unknown destination,
but if adequate captive breeding stock is to be established, and then main-
tained by periodic introduction of new genes, it is essential that dedica-
ted breeders are able to maintain the minimum number of birds neces-
sary. They, in turn, must, of course, be prepared to be accountable for
their birds and to co-operate with others in exchanging stock and making
up breeding pairs. The maintenance of studbooks will become increasingly
important.
An essential element in successful captive management is the exchange
of information and it is vital that all experience gained from keeping and
breeding rare species, particularly those of genera which have not been
bred previously, should be made available to all and we are determined
that the Avicultural Magazine should be a very important means of this
communication. To this end, we do hope that we can rely on the con-
tinued support of our members by providing more articles, financial help
and, that vital element of any endeavour, encouragement.

A SUCCESSFUL BREEDING OF THE
WHITE-BELLIED TOURACO Corythaixoides leucogaster
AT THE HOUSTON ZOO

By WILLIAM TODD, DAVID C. GRUBBS &amp; HUGO LAHERA
(Bird Section Staff, Houston Zoo)
Of the Musophagidae, the White-bellied Grey Touraco (Go-Away
Bird) must rank among the handsomest, its sharply delineated grey and
white plumage, elegantly appointed with black, and its slim proportions
presenting a stately, almost formal appearance. It is unique in the family
in displaying the sole example of readily-apparent sexual dichromatism:
the beak of the male is jet black, that of the female grey-green. The species
is native to eastern equatorial Africa, from Ethiopia and Somaliland
southward into Kenya, and, like its congeners, frequents acacia woodland;
it is reputed to inhabit drier country than any other touraco and to be
largely dependent on acacias for food (Moreau, 1958). Two or three pale
blue eggs (the colour is also unique in the family) are laid in a flimsy nest
typical of touracos and are incubated by both parents.
The New York Zoological Park was first successful in breeding this
species in 1975. A single chick was hatched on 6th September and, at the
age of two weeks, was removed from the nest and hand-reared, reaching
independence and surviving until 26th September, 1976. During 1976 and
1977, 16 chicks were hatched but none survived for more than four days,
approximately seven suffering congenital deformities (Donald Bruning, in
litt.). In 1982 the breeding pair was generously offered on loan to the
Houston Zoo.
A concise survey of our touraco breeding programme has appeared
previously in this magazine (Berry &amp; Todd, 1982). Following a routine
quarantine period ending on 24th August, the White-bellied Grey Touracos
were housed alongside other species in a similar flight measuring 7 x 15 x
7 ft (2.14 x 4.58 x 1.14 m) with a 10 ft (3.05m) high wooden shelter in

which the nest platform is located out of public view. At this time only a
standard diet was provided consisting of mixed fruit (chopped papaya,
apple, grapes and soaked rasins), moistened dog and cat kibble, and
chopped spinach and endive, the fruit being provided twice daily. Addi-
tionally, game bird breeder crumbs and dry mynah pellets were provided
ad lib., and the birds were occasionally observed to eat these items. This
diet, with the supplements noted below, continues to be supplied.
Although the birds displayed some interest in the nest provided, no
serious breeding activity occurred until April 1983, when both sexes were
observed alternately sitting in the nest. On 30th April it was confirmed
that two eggs were present, one hatching on 18th May after an undeter-
mined incubation period. Unfortunately this chick was found dead six
days later. Necropsy indicated an impaction of leaves from a Crepe Myrtle
Lagerstroemia indica tree in the flight. No further nesting activity took
place before the male's death on 2nd August of acute hepatitis.
In the meantime, a second male had been lent by the Pittsburgh Aviary;
this bird and the lone female established a pair-bond after an initial period
of adjacent introductory housing.
As no breeding activity was apparent by early spring 1984 (many
touraco species breed year around in Houston), the birds were moved to
another flight of similar design in which a small acacia Acacia radii had
been planted. This proved attractive and the birds began eating any leaves
that could be reached. In addition, as the unsuccessful attempt had indica-
ted a strong inclination for the parents to feed greenfood, an entire head
of Romaine (Cos) lettuce was attached daily to a perch from which they
could easily tear bits of leaves. Finally, honeysuckle Lonicera japonica
stems with leaves and blossoms, when available, were attached to the
perch. The birds consumed all plant material provided, and we believe
this was crucial to their successfully rearing chicks. As an additional en-
couragement, a second smaller nest platform containing a handwoven
framework of dried vines over straw was fixed on the shelter wall a short
distance below the older nest which contained only straw. On 11th April
eggs were observed in the upper nest, and on 5th May, the first chick
hatched, followed by a second two days later. The incubation period is
approximately 25 days, though reluctance to disturb the birds has made
exact calculation impossible.
One chick was found dead on the cage floor on 11th May, but the
other appeared to thrive and was on the point of fledging when it died
suddenly of undetermined causes. At this stage, it was feathered like an
adult, including white belly and black accents on crest, wings and tail,
and had a black beak.
The birds renested quickly: by 25th June the male was observed incu-

bating on the lower nest (possibly to escape the heat of the tin roof
above the upper box), thus confirming the presence of eggs. The first of
three eggs hatched on 16th July, and although one of the nestlings was
discovered dead on the cage floor, the remaining two survived to fledge
on 7th and 13th August. The second to leave the nest was markedly
smaller, indicating that the chick that died may have been the second to
hatch.
At fledging both were feathered like an adult, though with propor-
tionately shorter crests and tails, and both had black beaks. (At the time
of writing [8th October] both their beaks remain black, and we are as
yet uncertain if beak colour is a reliable indicator of sex at fledging.) The
white bellies of both young were very soiled with faecal material in the
nest which had not been as sanitarily maintained as those of other toura-
cos.
On 20th August, the larger fledgling was observed eating honeysuckle
buds, though both continued to be fed by their parents until at least
11th September when the adults were again visiting the nest-box and
appeared to be ignoring the juveniles. The latter began to consume large
quantities of greenfood, anxiously awaiting their keeper's placement of
fresh lettuce and honeysuckle.
At the time of writing, the first egg of another clutch has been laid,
and we look forward to continued success with this species.

Note added at proof stage
By late Spring 1985, one of the above-mentioned chick's beaks had turned grey-
green, thus indicating that it is a female. This distinction is apparently acquired with
approaching sexual maturity.
By August 1985, two more chicks had been successfully reared to independence.

Included amongst the large family of tanagers are the 24
species of Euphonia which occur southward from Mexico where
they are found in pairs or groups at the edges of forests, search-
ing for insects, berries and small fruits. They are dumpy little birds gener-
ally about 4 in (10 cm) in length with short tails and stubby bills.
In September 1983 we purchased a pair of Golden-breasted Euphonia
which was to live in our Tropical House together with pairs of Black-
capped Zosterops, Purple Sugar Birds, Black-chinned Yuhinas and Blue-
chinned Sapphire Hummingbirds. The male is bright yellow on the fore-
head and forecrown and all underparts from upper chest. The remaining
plumage, including the throat from chin to upper chest is black with
purple and blue glosses: the tail has white patches on the underneath; the
beak is black with grey at the base. The female bears no resemblance,
being a dull olive green which is brighter above and pale below.
After keeping them in a cage for a week to make sure that they were
healthy, as we do with all newly-acquired birds, the Euphonias were
released into the tropical house where, to our disappointment, they dis-
appeared amongst the dense foliage, only to be seen on occasions at
the feeding trays.
To ensure a varied diet is received, they are given chopped pears and
grape daily, chopped banana, of which they are very fond, three times a
week, half an orange once a week and half an apple twice a week. Other
fruits are given when in season. Mealworms are given daily in moderation.
Dishes of Claus insectivorous mixture and drinking tubes with
Biotropic Nectar are always available. I find that all the birds are
very fond of both these products.
Both birds remained very shy until April 1984, when the male was seen
taking a leaf bath after I had sprayed the plants; after watching him for a
while, the female began doing the same and they enjoyed it so much that
it became a daily event. During the next few weeks they became very ac-
tive and wherever the female went, the male was never far behind. Each
time I passed or entered the tropical house, they could be heard calling to
each other. All the hanging baskets, which contained large Boston Ferns,
were thoroughly investigated and then, on 10th June, the female was seen
carrying strands of coconut fibres to one basket. Within five days she had
constructed a dome-shaped nest from the fibres, the male helping occa-

sionally. On 17th June the first of three eggs was laid - it was pinkish white
with brown spots which were heavier at the broad end. Incubation did not
start until the last egg was laid and the female then sat tight, leaving the
nest only to feed. The male, who sat close by most of the day, produced
a sound which can only be described as similar to a squeaky wheelbarrow.
On 1st July, after an incubation period of 12 days, the first egg
hatched, followed by the second the next day; the third turned out.to be
clear. Rather than cause any disturbance, no attempt was made to look at
the chicks.
To ensure that an adequate supply of live food was available for the
parents to rear the chicks, in addition to white mealworms, fruit fly mag-
gots and buffalo worms, we collected insects, green caterpillars and spiders
in a bucket at two-hourly intervals. Preference was given to the caterpillars
and spiders, which were first eaten by the parents and then fed regurgita-
ted to the chicks. The male was first to feed; when he finished, the female
took her turn and then remained in the nest until the next feed.
When the chicks were nine days old, I had the chance to take a quick
look in the nest. Their eyes were open, they had dark skin and were begin-
ning to grow flight feathers, but apart from this they were completely
bald. It was not until they were 15 days old that pin feathers started to
appear, and by this time they had doubled in. size and were being fed vast
amounts of caterpillars and spiders, still regurgitated. I noticed that the
parents were also adding pieces of pear and grape to the chicks' diet. The
male would now feed them by clinging to the front of the hanging basket
and just poking his head inside the nest.
In the days that followed, their growth rate was rapid and when they
left the nest on 23rd July, at 23 days old, they were fully feathered and
able to fly. Whilst one resembled the hen, it was obvious that the other
was a male by the underneath of the tail feathers which, although short,
had white patches appearing. He also had some black feathers in his
wings.
Both parents continued to feed the chicks until 31st July and it was at
this time that I noticed the female was missing. On checking the nest,
thinking that she might have returned to lay some eggs, I was surprised to
find she had built another nest round the other side of the hanging basket.
Unfortunately there were no eggs and no sign of the female. With a sink-
ing feeling I began to search amongst the plants and, as expected, I found
her dead. At the time we could find no apparent reason for her death, but
later wondered if the spiders and caterpillars collected the day before had
any connection. Having depleted the supply near to home, they were col-
lected from bushes near to a cornfield some distance away. As a male
Black-chinned Yuhina, who had also been eating them, fell ill and we had
bad rashes appear on our hands and necks, it occurred to us that the field

may have been sprayed with an insecticide.
The male continued to feed the young for a further week and they
were then left to fend for themselves. Neither made any further attempt to
beg food from him.
From then on the male was to surprise us by singing a delightful song
that we had not heard before. We hope we shall be able to obtain another
wife for him to sing it to.
As described above, the Golden-breasted Euphonia Euphonia xantho-
gaster has been bred by Mrs. Lloyd-Roberts and this is believed to be the
first success in this country. Anyone knowing of a previous breeding in
Great Britain or Northern Ireland, or of any other reason that would
disqualify this claim, is asked to inform the Hon. Secretary.

BREEDING THE GROSBEAK STARLING
Scissirostrum dubium
By BRYAN PECK

The Grosbeak Starling is indigenous to the Celebes (Salawesi), and from
the notes available, it would appear to be quite numerous in the south part
of the island, although the subspecies S.d.pelingense appears on a few
islands around the north-east peninsula. I would guess that the race I own
is the nominate race.
The whole of the body and head are slate grey, the primaries and tail
feathers black, the rump and sometimes thighs and flanks are streaked
with orange and shining red. The feet, legs and beak are lemon yellow. The
beak is quite large, as the name suggests. The eye is grey, and the bare skin
is grey/black. The tail is graduated and quite long. From beak tip to tail
tip the bird is about 8 in. long.
For many years I had wanted to own this species since I first encoun-
tered it when visiting Mr. M. Sherbourne of Bristol in the late Sixties. I
have two pairs which were obtained from a dealer some three years ago
and both pairs have produced eggs and young but failed to rear them until
this year.
One pair (A) was housed in an inside flight 8 x 3 x 6 ft high (2.44 x

Adult pair of Grosbeak Starlings with chick that was successfully reared
0.92 x 1.83 m) and they laid and hatched eggs from the first few months
that I had them. They are now housed outside in an aviary 3 x 5 x 6 ft
high (0.92 x 1.53 x 1.83 m) and are in full moult at the time of writing.
The other pair (B) were housed over winter in a 4 x 1.6 x 1.6 ft (1.22 x
0.46 x 0.46 m) cage. Being an optimist where my birds are concerned,
I supplied them with a nest-box 6 x 6 x 10 in high, of the same design as
a garden tit box but larger (both pairs like this type of box). The box was
placed at the back end of the cage; two perches were placed across the
depth (1.6 ft) of the cage, one about V 2 in diameter at the nest-box end
and at the other end a largish, rotting log was used as a perch. The birds
chipped at this log in the fashion of barbets but never took any of the
chips into the nest. From past experience, I had learned to leave the nest-
box empty of nesting material, also I did not supply any nest material in
the cage. The box was lined with newspaper which was also used to cover
the floor of the cage. The birds tore it into thin strips which they used on
the floor of the nest-box. The paper is not made into a cup but just
scattered and only about 15 strips are used which seems a very small
amount.
The normal clutch is two eggs, light blue speckled with shades of brown
at one end, and varying in shape from oval to triangular. The eggs hatch at

variable periods, from 18 to 22 days, and are perfectly chipped about two-
thirds up the egg. On hatching the chicks have tufts of light-coloured down
which turns grey after a few days. Up until about 10 days old, they look
like young thrushes, but then the beak starts to take shape. To me, they
seem to take a long time fledging.
From pair B there were two eggs, both hatched but one chick died at
about 20 days old. The remaining chick left the nest on 14th May 1985
and was self-feeding about six days after leaving the nest.
I have had two chicks leave the nest. The first chick was from pair A
but it died the day after leaving the nest. This chick was unusual in that
it had no markings on the rump or thighs. The chick from p air B took
about 35 days to leave the nest but did not subsequently return and the
parents started nesting again. This chick had very faint pink/orange streaks
on the rump and flanks.
The diet for the chick's parents was very ordinary. I had tried all forms
of food - stick insects, wax moths, crickets, buffalo worms, mealworms,
beetles, figs, avocados - but nothing worked. The pair in the cage (pairB)
were given only a few extra mealworms. Their diet consisted of diced
apple, tomato, carrots, grape, peas, sweetcorn, cabbage and currants -
this was mixed together and Claus Pekin Robin Softfood added. Claus
Flycatcher food was also fed but in a separate dish. Claus Pekin Robin
food is the fatty type, not the one with honey, and has a high rice paper
content which all my softbills like. About 20 mealworms and five wax
moth worms were also given daily. All dishes were washed and the news-
papers on the floor changed daily. Brown bread and nectar (mashed) was
also given. All the food was eaten except the mealworms - often a few
were left next morning. It was noticed from the start that the chick was
reared on the fruit and Claus Insectivorous Mixture. By sound I would say
that it was regurgitated.
On leaving the nest the chick was complete in plumage, being a lighter
grey and orange than the parents. The legs were pinkish and three weeks
after leaving the nest they started to turn yellow. The beak was yellow
and about half the size of the parents' beaks. The chick grew up to be a
perfect specimen and my fears that it might have had rickets, as some
starlings do, proved groundless.
In my opinion, apart from the Glossy Starlings, this species is one of
the most beautiful of all the Sturnidae. It adapts readily to cage, aviary
and food, and is eager to nest, but shy. It should make a good species for
both the experienced aviculturist and the beginner to breed.

BREEDING THE GOLDEN HEART DOVE
Gallicolumba rufigula
AT PADSTOW BIRD GARDENS, CORNWALL
By ANDREW OWEN

<bodyText confidence="0.997274583333333" page_id="56953639"  page_num="129" year="" vol="">
The Golden Heart is a small, attractive dove from New Guinea, measur-
ing about 8 in long, the upperparts a rich chestnut brown, throat and
breast golden-yellow, wings barred with pale grey and the legs and feet a
dull red.
A pair of these birds is housed in the indoor tropical flight where they
spend most of their time foraging on the ground, which is typical of their
behaviour in the wild.
During the year (1984) they built several nests, but were disturbed at
some point of the incubation period by a pair of Luzon Bleeding Heart
Doves Gallicolumba luzonica which was also trying to nest. These birds
were eventually removed to an outdoor aviary where they successfully
bred, leaving the Golden Hearts to settle down to some serious breeding
activities.
They were very industrious, building several nests from rootlets and
dead leaves. A single egg was laid on several occasions but the chick failed
to hatch; the first egg was infertile and the second nest fell off a Monstera
leaf, smashing the egg which revealed a well-developed embryo.
The Doves did not give up, however, and soon built a nest about 2 ft
from the ground on a large Crinum x powellii leaf, situated at the front of
the building, alongside the public viewing area. They sat tightly, alter-
nating during the day, totally undisturbed by the public.
On 18th June, after an incubation period of 17 days, the chick hatched
and was seen to be covered in fluffy, cream-coloured down. All went well
until the sixth day when the squab was found dead in the nest, still being

brooded by the female. We believe that it died from suffocation as it had
a full crop and had looked healthy the previous day. The nest, we feel, was
built too near to the public area and the adults were afraid to leave the
infant.
Even this setback did not deter them for long as they soon built again.
This time the nest was at the back of the tropical house where they laid
and began incubation within a couple of days. During the afternoons both
birds sat on the nest until the chick hatched on 22nd July. The squab grew
rapidly and by the 30th July, wing feathers had started to appear.
On one occasion, whilst I was cleaning the tropical house, the female
was startled from the nest. She flew to the ground, cooing and shaking
her wings vigorously but once I had left the nest-site, she returned to the
nest and resumed brooding. This broken wing display was seen several
times during the following weeks.
The squab fledged on 7th August and was seen to feed itself on the
23rd, on a dove seed mix and small pieces of fruit. Whenever the adults
approached, however, it still begged for food. By 30th August it was fully
independent, taking various seeds, diced fruit and livefood in the form of
maggots and, occasionally, small crickets and stick insects.
The Golden Heart Doves enjoy taking a shower and, whenever the hose
pipe is used in the tropical house, they lie on one side with a wing out-
stretched. Once completely soaked, they turn over and repeat the process.
The young dove took its first shower on 7th September. It had acquired
full adult plumage within three months of leaving the nest, and the adults
have since built a new nest and are at present incubating another egg.

RANDOM NOTES ON BIRDS IN THE USSR
By JEFFERY BOSWALL
(Bristol)
Introduction
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.97969496969697" page_id="56953641"  page_num="131" year="" vol="">
I have been visiting the USSR and enquiring into the relationship be-
tween the Soviet people and their birds for over a quarter of a century.
Knowing of my frequent visits to behind the Iron Curtain, friends and
acquaintances often put to me such questions as: Do the city comrades
feed the birds? Do they put up nest-boxes? How popular is birdwatching?
What is the state of Soviet bird science? Is there a Soviet bird protection
society? How many bird reserves are there? What laws, if any, protect the
birds? Is there a 'Glorious Twelfth' when the proletariat take to the taiga
to shoot Willow Grouse Lagopus lagopus ? Do Soviet wildfowlers bring
down geese and ducks from the autumn skies? Are any birds regarded
as pests in the USSR? Which bird species are favoured by serious Soviet
aviculturists? And which cage birds find favour among Soviet families?
What of domestic birds - is the chicken supreme or the Muscovy Duck
Cairina moschatal
Some of these questions I have already dealt with either in the Avicul-
turalMagazine (Boswall, 1983, 1985a) or elsewhere (Boswall, 1984, 1985b
and 1985c; Boswall &amp; Wilson, in press; Boswall, Wilson &amp; Dickson, 1982).
The USSR
For a start, the USSR is so vast that answers are likely to vary. Further,
there are 270 million people of whom only half are Russians. The others
are Ukrainians, Uzbeks, Belorussians, Kazakhs, Tartars and so on, speaking
a variety of languages and perpetuating a diversity of cultures in which
birds could play very different roles.
Within this great country - easily the largest on earth - there are 15
republics (of which Russia, i.e. the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist
Republic, is only one, though easily the largest and the most influential).
Birds and the Proletariat
Just how interested in providing nest-boxes for birds is the average
Soviet citizen? Artificial nesting sites are provided as frequently as not for
the Starlings Sturnus vulgaris , a much-loved bird in Russia. A Starling nest-
box is called a skvorechnik and is a characteristic feature of village gardens
and country farms. In Leningrad the bird uses boxes on the balconies of
the upper storeys of high rise blocks. Nest-boxes are also put up for other

birds. Take Lithuania. There the Ministry of Forests instructs foresters to
make and site nest-boxes. Boxes with a 32 mm hole are for Great Tits
Pams major and Pied Flycatchers Ficedula hypoleuca , but may also
attract a few Coal P. ater and Crested Tits P. cristatus. Those with larger
entrances are for Rollers Coracias garmlus but may get used by Jackdaws
Corvus monedula, and the largest boxes of all are for Tawny Owls Strix
aluco. Even more interesting is the story of a Lithuanian bird of prey
fanatic called Shablevicius who was lucky enough to find the very first
nest of Tengmalm's Owl Aegolius funereus for the republic. But since the
birds nested in a natural hole in a tree, they were difficult to study. Over
the next few years, however, he persuaded ten or a dozen pairs to occupy
the boxes he had put up for them. Encouraged by this success he then
put up platforms for Lesser Spotted Eagle Aquila pomarina, Common
Buzzard Buteo huteo and Goshawk Accipiter gentilis in situations also
more suitable for observation than those the birds might have chosen for
themselves, and was rewarded with more than one pair of each moving in!
The arrival of spring is heralded also by the song of the Great Tit in
the towns and the Skylark Alauda argensis in the country; also by the
return of the Starling and the Rook Corvus fmgilegus. The Rook, not the
Swallow Himndo ms tic a, is the Russian harbinger of spring. Witness the
famous painting in the Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow which is entitled
'The Rooks are Back'. It is by the 19th century Russian painter Savrasov
and shows birds re-occupying the colony to repair nests. For only 40 p.
I was able to buy a poster-sized reproduction of this painting, one of a
print run of 200,000. Come autumn, both the Rook and the Starling
desert Russia for more hospitable climes to the west and south.
During a recent mid-winter visit to the extreme south of the USSR I
was amused and interested to catch up with the wintering Rooks. They
too had become commuters! In the ancient city of Samarkand, in the rep-
ublic of Uzbekistan, thousands of Rooks fly in steadily each winter even-
ing from the surrounding agricultural flatlands to use as a dormitory the
trees of Maxim Gorky Boulevard. At dusk, wave after wave of black shapes
flap steadily towards the city centre, like feathered bombers in a Hitch-
cock-style movie. The steadiness of their course, and their relentless num-
bers, are uncanny. After assembling on outlying trees the birds drop down
into the central roost as darkness falls. Next morning, below the trees
besides whitewash, pellets (castings) of indigestible grain husks, a few dead
birds are to be found. I can easily believe that as many as 10,000 birds
assemble nightly and that their catchment area has a radius of at least 15
miles (Boswall, in press).

bird photographs called In the World of Birds. It is the first of its kind and
was published in Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania, by Mokslas and com-
prises 280 pages, 382 colour stills and 160 distribution maps. It sells there
for 27 roubles and in Britain (Collets) for #35. The text and captions are
in English, Russian and Lithuanian. The driving force behind this publica-
tion, the like of which had never before been seen in the USSR, is a young
Lithuanian bird photographer called Algirdas Knystautas. Helped by
Arvydas Liutkus as co-author, and by photographers resident in the Soviet
Far East and in the Ukraine, "Al" Knystautas has brought together in an
attractive volume facts and photos from the length and breadth of the
largest country on earth. The very first photo is of the Relict Gull Larus
relictus, a species first discovered for science as recently as 1968 nesting on
a lake called Alakol in south-east Kazakhstan, near the border with
western China. After a series of double-spreads that act as an aperitif, the
book groups the photographs by six regions of the Soviet Union: the
northern seas and islands, the tundra, the temperate zone, the southern
seas and lakes, the mountains of Central Asia and Ussuriland (near Vladi-
vostok) in the Soviet Far East. Ten thousand copies are said to have been
initially printed;just how many were sold to Soviet citizens and how many
to tourists in the hard currency shops it is difficult to know. The book was
reprinted in 1984 (5000 copies) and 100 were imported for sale in the
UK. To any western ornithologist the volume is of immense interest. Here
on page after page are not only birds of his own (capitalist) garden, but
also species he never dared to hope to see even in a book. There is Radde's
Leaf Warbler Phylloscopus schwarzi and Gray's Grasshopper Warbler
Locustella fasciolata, both at the nest in the temperate zone; and in the
far north the Great Knot Calidris tenuirostris, the Red-breasted Goose
Branta mficollis and the Siberian White Crane Gms leucogeranus, a trio
of Soviet endemics.
Except for scientific treatises, few other popular books devoted to
birds can be found. A field guide, published in 1968, has not been reprin-
ted.
On the role of natural history in Soviet radio broadcasting, I know
a little. On Moscow radio, Igor D. Nikol'skiy, the State University researcher
in bioacoustics, has done about 75 five-minute pieces over the last 15
years under the generic title Native Nature. His little word picture for
January 1985, complete with a few bird voices, including that of Sabine's
Gull Lams sabini, was about the Chukotka peninsula on the 'home' side of
the Bering Strait, opposite Alaska.
In Estonia I have a friend called Fred Jussi who is a freelance wildlife
broadcaster. He has a weekly spot called ABC of Nature which is broadcast
on Tuesdays at 7.00 p.m. Fred not only broadcasts regularly about birds
for Estonian radio, but also tapes their voices in stereo and publishes them

on gramophone records.
Birdwatchers in the USSR
Now available in the west is an English translation of the afore-men-
tioned Field Guide to the Birds of the USSR (Flint and others, 1984).
Princeton University Press commissioned a translation from a Russian
emigre, resident in Massachusetts, Natalia Bourso-Leland. As long ago as
1967, this lady accompanied the first (?) group of Americans to go bird-
watching in the Soviet Union. Such trips are nowadays quite common and
depart from several countries. A fortnight's package holiday in June to Ir-
kutsk, the old capital of Siberia (only a 40-mile drive from Lake Baikal) is
by no means unheard of. To anyone taking such a trip the new book
(which sells in the UK for #59.10, a high price) would be invaluable. For
particularly perceptive and helpful reviews of this book see Redman (1984)
and Wilson (1985).
One enterprising Swedish birdwatcher, during a birding trip that em-
braced Moscow, Irkutsk in central Siberia, and Frunze, the capital of the
central Asian Soviet republic of Kirghizstan, produced a 90-minute cassette
sound tape of 30-odd Soviet passerine bird songs and calls to help with
field identification. His name is Lars Svensson and he sells the cassette for

Birdwatching by Soviets is almost unheard of. The major exception is
the three Baltic states where maybe 200-300 birdwatchers are active.
But this is not to say that children and young teenagers are not inter-
ested and active. The Young Biologists' Circle of the Moscow Zoo recently
celebrated its 60th anniversary. It is said to have set a number of young
persons on the path to professional ornithology. There is also the Moscow
Society of Naturalists, a young persons' organisation organised under the
aegis of the Department of Vertebrate Zoology at the State University.
One of the lecturers there, Nicolai Formosov, takes six children out twice
a month to visit forests and lakes.
Other Soviet ornithologists may have been influenced in their youth
when members of the Komsomol (the Communist Union of Youth), an
organisation which encourages the erection of nest-boxes.
Soviet bird science
What is the state of ornithology in the Soviet Union? How many pro-
fessional bird people are there? Those of us who attended the 18th Inter-
national Ornithological Congress in Moscow in August 1982 were surprised
to find several hundred Soviet ornithologists descending on the Lomono-

hyper-active Eerik Kumari; from Verkhoyansk in north-east Siberia came
the trim and bearded figure of Yuri V. Labutin, well-known to me for his
work on the Little Curlew Numenius minutus, a Soviet endemic; from
even further east came the zoosome twosome Yuri Shibaev and his wife
Natasha Litvinenko, he a bird of prey expert, she a student of the Black-
tailed Gull Lams crassirostris ; from Alma-Ata in Kazakhstan came Dr.
Anatoly Serna who has studied the song of the Starling. Moscow acquain-
tances of mine included the shy and gifted Igor D. Nikol'skiy of the
Department of Vertebrate Zoology at the University; Victor Zubakin, a
behaviourist with a particular interest in gulls, and the ebullient Vladimir
E. Flint, a leading government nature conservationist. The total attendance
from east and west was of perhaps 800 bird students, ably shepherded by
the Secretary-General, Valery D. Ilyichev.
There are believed to be at least a thousand professional ornithologists
in the Soviet Union (out of a population of 270 million persons). These
full-timers work in the academies of science (one 'all-union', and one in
each of the fifteen republics), in universities, teacher-training colleges
(usually translated as 'pedagogical institutes') and in nature reserves. Many
of the amateurs, particularly those east of the Baltic republics, are persons
whose profession is in one branch of biological or medical science who
have birds as a hobby. Of all these 'birdmen', one seems, by the common
consent of professional and amateur alike, to be of pre-eminent ability and
devotion. His name is Vladimir V. Leonovitch and he works as an art his-
torian in Moscow's Pushkin Museum of Art. For more than half a century
he has been active as a field ornithologist. Untrained in science, but innately
talented, this tall, distinguished-looking, French-speaking batchelor, now
just over 60, has such skill as a nest-finder that he is said to employ witch-
craft (!). He was long ago granted special dispensation under Soviet law to
build a scientific collection of eggs and birds' nests, provided he bequeathed
them to the Zoological Museum in Moscow. He is said to have one clutch,
at least, and often a series of clutches, of more than 500 Soviet nesters, all
beautifully preserved and painstakingly labelled. All have been taken per-
sonally. Leonovitch acquires none by exchange or purchase. His contri-
butions to the literature can be matched by no other amateur and (dare it
be said?) by few professionals. Among his major contributions is a paper
on the Red-breasted Goose, the symbol of the 1982 Moscow ornithologi-
cal Congress and, now, of the newly-formed USSR Ornithological Society
(Krechmar and Leonovitch, 1967). Also he has compared the origins of
the bird communities of the Kyzylkum (Red Sand) and Karakum (Black
Sand) Deserts of the south.
Valery Ilyichev and Vladimir Flint had intended to have ready by
August, 1982, for sale to delegates the first volume of their new, ambitious

work The Birds of the USSR (1982) but it was not to appear until later in
the year. A near miss. However, by dint of great personal effort, my long-
standing friend Boris Veprintsev did have available the gramophone
records (Veprintsev, 1982) designed to accompany the Ilyichev-Flint
volume. Thereby hangs a story. One of the many fascinating facts of
Soviet society concerns the distribution of goods. Take books on ornith-
ology. Each day at the Congress two or three different ladies would appear
each with boxes of new books and a portable table, and would set up shop
for as long as stocks lasted. Each lady would then disappear never to be
seen again, having sold buyers Volume 2 of this work but knowing nothing
of Volume 1, etc. The only way to cope with this problem is to keep a
day-long lookout and at each opportunity rush in, flood whichever woman
with roubles and grab two of everything you know, or suspect you don't
already have in your hotel bedroom. Later you can compare 'overlaps' and
'holes' with other collectors.
Boris's discs were on sale, but 10 minutes' walk from the site of the
Congress! The word soon got round and delegates hurried across to pur-
chase. I was tempted to buy 100 copies of each of the discs, set up my
own shop by the Congress noticeboard and sell at 10% profit. But I
allowed my Russian friends to dissuade me. There had been others who
had tried to introduce capitalist ideas.

son (in press).

A question that is often put to me enquires about a possible Soviet
society for the protection of birds. The answer has to be that in the USSR
there are, of course, no charities. The state tries to look after everything.
No organisation independent of the government could purchase land as a
nature reserve. There is, however, in each of the 15 republics a quasi-gov-
ernmental nature protection society. In Russia (i.e. the Russian Soviet
Federated Socialist Republic and easily the largest of the 15) 34 million
people pay 30 kopecs (about 30 p.) per year to the Russian Society for
the Defence of Nature.Quite a lot of money! Some is spent on education
and publicity; posters are produced for schools, bookmarks for adults.
Russians are avid readers so thousands of bookmarks are produced by the
society, each picturing an endangered bird. Other roubles go towards the
planting of trees and putting up of nest-boxes. Certain members are
trained as voluntary hunting inspectors who check licences, and try to
prevent poaching.
Article 18 of the Soviet Constitution reads: 'In the interests of the
present and future generations, the necessary steps are taken in the USSR

to protect and make scientific, rational use of the land and its mineral
and water resources, and the plant and animal kingdoms, to preserve the
purity of the air and water, ensure the reproduction of natural wealth,
and improve the human environment'. The extent to which the Soviet
government achieves this is not easy to assess. The current five-year plan
(1981-1985) set aside 10.3 billion roubles (roughly #10b) for nature
conservation (Sinyakov, 1983). It would be interesting to know how
it is spent, No doubt some is expended on endangered birds, though
much is said to go on water purification installations.
Endangered birds
The idea of Red Data Books, that list endangered species has really
caught on in the Soviet Union. Several republics have produced them,
including White Russia and the Ukraine, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan.
The fully revised second edition of the overall 'all-union' work appeared
in March 1984, and treats (text, map and colour-painting) 80 birds, inclu-
ding exotic, surprising and mysterious species. One exotic bird is the Bar-
headed Goose Anser indicus that nests on high mountain lakes usually
under the protection of a colony of gulls - Brown-headed Gulls Larus
bmnnicephalus in the Pamir mountains, for example. A surprising rarity
is the Shag Phalacrocorax aristotelis, a bird difficult for us to think of
as threatened. The most mysterious bird has to be the Slender-billed
Curlew Numenius tenuirostris. No nest has been found for about 50-60
years, but 800 birds were seen wintering in Morocco in 1964 and 123 in
1975. Migrants have been seen at irregular intervals over 40 years, the
largest group being 48 in the Crimea in 1975. The world population is
probably no more than a few dozen pairs.
The most famous rare bird in the USSR, as in the USA, is a kind of
crane. In the USA it is the Whooping Crane Gms americana, in the USSR
the Siberian White Crane Gms leucogeranus. The Soviet summer popula-
tion of the Siberian White Crane is 90 territorial pairs (not all necessarily
old enough to be breeding; cranes may not reproduce until seven years
old); including younger, non-territorial non-breeders the world total
comes to 300. And yet, on 15th FEbruary 1984, at Lake Poyang on the
Middle Yangtze, the Chinese claim to have counted 840 birds (Anon,
1984).
The International Council for Bird Preservation lists the following 14
Soviet birds as endangered (the Soviets themselves list 80 in the 1984
2nd edition of their All-Union Red Data Book).-

In 1982 I was invited to visit a bird show in Moscow and was taken
around by an English-speaking member of the Moscow Avicultural Soci-
ety, Irene Yershova. This experience I described earlier in the Avicultural
Magazine (Boswall, 1983).
Pigeons wild , pigeons tame
In the mountains outside Dushanbe, the capital of the Tadzhikistan
republic on the border with Afghanistan, I was lucky enough to see truly
wild Rock Doves Columba livia. A party of birds flew into a great cave in
the hillside where, according to my companion, Islom Abdusalyamov, they
nest alongside a pair of Eagle Owls Bubo bubol The Rock Dove is, of
course, the wild progenitor of the feral Street Pigeon, a bird which is
found in Soviet cities as it is in most of the cities of the world. In Alma-
Ata, the capital of Kazakhstan (next door to Tadzhikistan) on a very cold
mid-winter day, I saw scores of these birds fighting for crumbs with the
local Hooded Crows Corvus corone comix in the courtyards of old-style
wooden houses. In Samarkand, the legendary city conquered in turn by
Alexander the Great and by Genghis Khan, I visited the Sunday morning
ornamental pigeon market. Twelve or 15 sellers were there, the earliest by
7.30 a.m. Some were older Uzbek men wearing traditional ornamented

square skull caps and quilted, florally-decorated coats; others were younger
men wearing the drab clothes of the current generation. The pigeons were
of three main ornamental breeds: 'straight' Rock Doves but with orna-
mentally feathered feet; the brown breed known as the Jacobin, and a
strikingly black and white strain.
In certain cities in the USSR the sporting use of these birds is a well-
established feature of life in the Soviet Union. Moscow birds are taken by
train to such release points as Kiev (800 km) and Lvov (1,200 km). An
impressive route newly pioneered by the homing pigeon fraternity in
Odessa, the port on the Black Sea, is to transport the birds to Archangel,
the Arctic port on the White Sea! The flight home is over 2,000 km.
Using wild birds
Of the 700 plus wild bird species in the USSR, about 150 are of econo-
mic importance as objects of food and sport and as sources of material for
clothing. Willow Grouse, Black Grouse Tetrao tetrix and Quail Coturnix
coturnix are among the traditional game birds that are hunted for subsis-
tence or sport, as are less familiar species like the Rock Partridge Alectoris
graeca and the Black-billed Capercaillie Tetrao parvirostris. Swans are
protected at all times but five kinds of geese are commonly shot including
the Brent Branta bemida, the Whitefront Anser albifrons and the Lesser
Whitefront A. erythropus. Many kinds of duck may lawfully be taken, in-
cluding the Baikal Teal Anas formosa where it is numerous; so too may
various waders including three kinds of curlew and even the Collared
Pratincole Glareola pratincola. Pigeons, sandgrouse and rails (Coots Fulica
atra, Moorhen Gallinula chloropus and Corncrake Crex crex) are also
killed. In the Mediterranean tradition Blackbirds Turdus merula and
Fieldfares T pilaris are trapped in Georgia. The eggs of Guillemots Uria
aalge may be taken under licence, and Eiders Somateria mollissima are
farmed for their down on the shores of the Baltic, White and Barents seas.
Grebes, divers and cormorants are taken for their 'fur'. This information is
summarised from Bannikov and Uspenskiy (1973).
In 1980, Soviet law in respect of wild nature was fully revised. A little
booklet (made of awful newsprint, as are most books in the USSR) sets
out the whole scheme in 24 pages.
Let us take the case of a man who wishes to shoot a Capercaillie Tetrao
urogallus. He can legally do this in only one of two open seasons, autumn
or spring. If he chooses spring then he has to find out which ten days this
spring are 'open'. Game biologists advise the authorities according to
whether the season is early, late or normal (normal = 21st-30th April).
Secondly, he may shoot only a male and thirdly his bag limit is one bird in
ten days. Fourthly, he has to have a licence for that bird (and for up to

three Woodcock Scolopax rusticola a day or whatever), as well as his
personal hunter's licence. Lastly, he cannot shoot his Capercaillie cock
just anywhere - only in a specified area. For example, a nature reserve in
Kalininskaya oblast (county) 300 km from Moscow is surrounded by a
buffer zone in which Capers may be shot.
On arrival, the hunter has to report to an official and show his licence;
on departure he has to show his 'bag'. One hunter I met takes the sport so
seriously that he has rules for himself of almost self-flagellatory character.
He takes only a gun and axe and matches, makes himself a bivouac from
natural materials and sleeps rough!
Duck hunting is a real delight to - among others - the Politburo's highly
durable Foreign Minister, Andrei Gromyko, who is known to go shooting
while at his dacha (small country villa) at Vnukovo.
A brief mention of falconry is made in another article in this Magazine
(Boswall, 1985a).
Birds as pests
As in other countries, some birds are economically disadvantageous.
Most notably those that assemble on airport runways and give rise to bird
strikes. One method tried in the Soviet Union (as elsewhere) to reduce the
incidence of these mishaps is the local broadcasting of the distress cries of
the relevant species. The Soviet Ministry of Defence was involved in the
production of a gramophone record that includes recordings of the distress
cries of the Black-headed Lams ridibundus and Common Gulls L. canus.
Tellingly, it also includes the alarm call of the Starling and of four
members of the crow family, including the Rook. The record also includes
the agitated cries of the Bee-eater Merops apiaster. This bird is apparently
a nuisance to commercial bee-keepers! The USSR is the world's premier
honey producer. In the Ukraine, for example, the local apiarists hold that
the birds take too many bees. In Kazakhstan a detailed investigation was
undertaken in 1956 when 500 Bee-eaters were shot in order to assess their
diet. The birds were also consuming 'harmful' Eastern Hornets and the in-
vestigators concluded that on balance the birds were economically valuable
and should be afforded protection! The use of sound recordings to scare
them away from hives seems a sensible compromise (assuming it works,
which the record sleeve doesn't say!).
Conclusion
To sum up: in the Soviet Union birds have acquired roles, as they seem
to have everywhere else, in art and science, culture and economics, gas-
tronomy and sport, and in the giving of companionship and simple pleasure.

Postscript
Coincidentally, in the journal Falke in 1985 (32:166) there is a note
by Altaju Shatkanbatjew under the heading "Burkutschi - the falconer'
about falconry in Kazakhstan. The full text, translated by Michael G.
Wilson, to whom I am indebted for permission to reproduce his work, is as
follows:
'Falcpnry is one of the oldest forms of hunting. It was still widespread
in Kazakhstan at the beginning of the 20th century. The most important
of the falconer's birds is the Golden ('Royal') Eagle Aquila chrysaetos .
The Kazakhs call the falconers 'Burkutschi' which comes from their word
for A. chrysaetos -'Burkut'.
The Golden Eagle is flown mainly at foxes Vulpes vulpes, V. corsac ,
gazelles Gazella subgutturosa , antelopes Saiga tatarica and even wolves
Canis lupus. Experienced 'Burkutschi' can catch 20 to 30 foxes during
the course of a winter. The number of 'Burkutschi' has declined signifi-
cantly in recent years. In each of the 19 regions of Kazakhstan (2717.3 ha)
there are now scarcely more than two to three. Golden Eagles are found
throughout Kazakhstan, apart from the treeless deserts and steppes, but
have become rare in recent years and are in need of special protection. In
our country, considerable attention is now being devoted to the question
of conserving rare and disappearing animals and increasing their numbers.
It is to be hoped that the Golden Eagle will not disappear from Kazakh-
stan, allowing the national and noble art of falconry to be forgotten; far
better that new and genuine lovers of the sport, people with a profound
knowledge of the hunting birds, should continue the dying tradition.'

As some of the more 'mature' among my readers may recall, a pair of
Bullfinches Pyrrhula purrhula were almost the first birds that I kept as a
small child (Goodwin, 1952). As those were the only Bullfinches I have
kept, I feel some diffidence in writing an article on the species and its con-
geners. My excuse must be that the Bullfinch is a favourite bird of mine
and one I have watched a certain amount in the wild. I have seen other
species of bullfinches only as museum skins but the genus as a whole,
although small, is so distinct from other finches, so little known and above
all so beautiful that I thought I would touch on them all.
The line sketches that I have done in order to make the descriptions
more easily envisaged have no pretensions to art or to a minutely detailed
accuracy.
Description and distribution of the Bullfinch
The Bullfinch Pyrrhula pyrrhula is found throughout much of tem-
perate and northern Europe, from the Iberian Peninsula, Ireland and Scan-
dinavia to Manchuria, northern China and Japan. Many different subspe-
cies or geographical races have been described. Here, to save space and
tedium, I will only describe those races found in western Europe and the
more distinct among the races found elsewhere. Of these, the grey-breasted
P.p. cinerea and the Azorean Bullfinch P.p. murina may have reached
specific status although they are currently treated as races of P. pyrrhula
by those who consider themselves authorities on such matters.
The race of the Bullfinch found in Britain, P. pyrrhula pileata (formerly
P.p . nesa), is a shade smaller than a British or European House Sparrow
Passer d. domesticus, a little plumpish in usual outline but almost always
looking sleek and elegant. The cock has the back a slightly bluish grey, the
cheeks, breast and most of the underparts a soft pinkish red or pink. There
is much individual variation, from dull brick pink to a bright rosy red but
most often of a delicate salmon-pink hue. The hen has the back greyish
brown to chocolate brown, the cheeks, breast and most of the underparts
a light chocolate brown, often with a slight pinkish tinge. I have seen two
or three hens that had these parts brownish pink in colour. In both
sexes the cap and very small bib are black, the rump is white, and the
upper tail coverts, tail and most of the wings black, richly glossed with
blue and purple. The wings are crossed with a pale grey bar.

D. GOODWIN - BULLFINCHES
To save time, in describing other races of this species, the term 'breast'
will be used to include all those areas (see above and sketches) that are
pink in the British cock Bullfinch, when describing forms in which these
areas are concolourous.
In their first (juvenile) plumage young Bullfinches have the parts that
are grey, brown or pink in adults of a general light buffish brown tinge,
without any sign of the streaking that the young of most finches of other
genera show in their juvenile plumages. Their wings and tail are similar to
the adults' but they completely lack the black cap. They acquire adult
plumage in their first summer or autumn (depending on how early or late
they were hatched).
The nominate race of the Bullfinch P.p. pynhula from northern and
eastern Europe is appreciably larger than the British race. The cock has the
grey and pink parts of his plumage paler but usually also brighter than
cock British Bullfinches. The hen is also much paler, greyer above and
usually more tinged with pinkish on the breast. Up until the mid-1930s
these large, bright Bullfinches were imported into Britain in large numbers
for sale as 'Siberian Bullfinches'. Many of them may well have come from
Siberia.
The Bullfinch from central and western Europe, P.p. europoea, is simi-
lar to the British race but usually slightly brighter. In the Iberian peninsula
a rather small race, P. p. iberiae , occurs whose breast (the cock's) is much
brighter and redder than in other forms.
Bullfinches P.p. griseiventris, from parts of Japan, Korea, Sakhalin
Island and Ussuri, differ in the cock having the cheeks a very bright pink
but the breast and those parts of the underparts that are pink or red in
other races are grey, more or less tinged with pink. In P.p. kurilensis, from
the Kurile Archipelago and northern Japan, the breast is clear grey, contras-
ting strongly with the pink cheeks.
Most distinct is P.p. cineracea from the Northern Altai, parts of Mon-
golia, Amur and Manchuria. It is sometimes stated (e.g. Nielsen, 1981) that
in cineracea the sexes are alike but this is not the case. The cock has the
breast a clear pale grey; the breast of the hen is pale pinkish brown. In the
cock the back is grey without any trace of brown. The hen, though rather
grey above, like the hen of the nominate race, is tinged strongly with
brown on back and scapulars.
The Bullfinch P.p. murinae from the Azores, long thought extinct, and
probably not far off that unhappy state, ought probably to be given speci-
fic rank. Although it no doubt derived either from P. pynhula or some
form ancestral to them both, it shows the common (though not invariable)
comparative dullness and coarseness of island forms to a marked degree.
It has a proportionately larger bill and a dull greyish rump. In general

coloration it much resembles the hen of the British Bullfinch. It is usually
said that the sexes are identical in colour but this, once again, is not so.
Cocks have their breasts, underparts and flanks suffused with a reddish
tawny tinge that is lacking in the hens.
Descriptions and distributions of other species of bullfinches
In all species the wings, rump and tail are very similar in colour and
pattern to those of our Bullfinch and I shall not describe them except
where they differ appreciably.
These other bullfinches fall into two groups, which might be descrip-
tively termed the 'brown bullfinches' and the 'masked bullfinches'.
In the first group are two closely related forms, the Brown Bullfinch,
Pyrrhula nipalensis and the Philippine or White-cheeked Bullfinch P. leu-
cotis.
The Brown Bullfinch is found in the sub-Himalayan regions of Pakistan,
North India and Tibet east to North Vietnam and Taiwan and south to
Burma and Malaya.
At a first glance it looks like a rather obscurely marked hen Bullfinch.
The body colour is dull greyish brown. The cap and bib feathers are
blackish with greyish brown edges, giving a speckled effect. Behind the
eye is a small whitish area. As if to make up for the lack of any large
areas of red, pink or orange, the wing and tail quills show an intense
development of the wonderful bluish purple lustre common to the genus.
The visible (when wings and tail are folded) parts of the tail and primaries
are vivid purple, fringed with velvety black. The tail is proportionately
longer and more strongly forked than in other species. The rump is strik-
ingly patterned with a white band 'sandwiched' between two jet black
areas (see sketch).

The Malaysian race P. nipalensis waterstradti has a paler and greyer
cap and bib, the individual feathers of these areas being grey with only
slightly darker central streaks.
The Brown Bullfinch is often written of as if it were sexually mono-
morphic. However, the sexes do differ. The small innermost secondary
has a red stripe on it in the male and a straw yellow one in the female.
Close up this is quite conspicuous to the human eye and no doubt much
more so to the pyrrhuline eye when its owner is in sexual mood. A cor-
responding but duller red mark is found on the same feather of the cocks
of those races ofP. pyrrhula which have pink or red on the breast.
1 Bif Innerm *st secondary (visible part) of Brown Bullfinch. The
\ unshaded part of the inner web is red in the male, straw yellow
in the female.
The Philippine Bullfinch is sometimes treated as a race of the Brown
Bullfinch but I concur with those who think it best given specific rank.
It is, as its name suggests, found in the Philippine Islands. It differs from
the Brown Bullfinch in having the entire cap and bib glossy black, exten-
sive white cheeks, yellowish drab underparts, buff undertail coverts and
less highly ornamented wing and tail quills. The stripe on the innermost
secondary is red in the cock and pale orange in the hen.
In his important paper on the behaviour of the European Bullfinch,
Nicolai held the opinion that these brown species are more primitive than,
and ancestral to, the species that have large areas of pink, red or orange
plumage. I think, however, that in view of their common possession of a
'capped' head pattern and (to varying degrees) a tendency to conspicu-
ously differentiated cheeks in the cock, nipalensis and leucogenys are
more closely related to pyrrhula than are the masked species.
The Red-breasted or Beavan's Bullfinch is found from the Himalayas
to China and Taiwan. The cock has a black face mask narrowly outlined
in white. The rest of his head, mantle, upper breast and back are dull
grey. His lower breast is bright orange-red. The wings, rump and tail are
very similar to, and somewhat intermediate between those of the Bull-
finch and the Brown Bullfinch.
The hen has grey crown and cheeks, coffee brown mantle and back,
and paler coffee brown breast and underparts, except for the white ven-
tral regions and undertail coverts.
The Red-headed Bullfinch Pyrrhula erythrocephala is found only in
parts of the Himalayas and south-eastern Tibet. The cock has a black

face mask, orange-red crown and nape, the cheeks, breast and most of the
underparts vary individually from orange suffused with grey to rich
orange-pink. The back and mantle are grey. Otherwise the bird is very
likeP. erythaca.
The hen has a drab area on the forecrown, immediately behind the
black face mask. The rest of her crown and nape are a delicate yellowish
green, a unique colour among bullfinches. She is pale drab on the under-
parts and dark drab on the mantle and back.
While the foregoing species are all roughly about the size of the British
race of the Bullfinch, the beautiful Orange or Golden Bullfinch Pyrrhula
auranfiaca, from parts of northern Pakistan and the north-western Hima-
layas, is smaller.
The cock Orange Bullfinch has the usual black face mask (see sketches).
His wings, tail and ventral regions are very like those of the other masked
bullfinches except that his wing bars are pale orange and his long upper
tail coverts partly white. His body is a lovely golden-orange, slightly
darker on the head and back and slightly paler and brighter on the cheeks
and underparts.
The hen has a dull grey head (the black mask excepted), yellowish
fawn back and pinkish buff breast shading to light dull yellow on the
lower breast and flanks.
In order to save space I have not described the juvenile plumages of
these other bullfinch species. In all of them the juveniles show differences
from the adults comparable to those inP. pyrrhula and specific differences
are less marked than in the adults.

Remarks on presumed relationships of bullfinches
The three capped species, the Bullfinch, Brown Bullfinch and Philip-
pine Bullfinch, are completely allopatric. In some plumage characters
the Philippine Bullfinch is intermediate between the other two and I
favour treating all three as members of the same superspecies. The Azores
Bullfinch might best be raised to specific rank within this same superspe-
cies.
The range maps given by our fellow member, Dr. Colin Harrison, in his
stimulating book on bird distribution (1982) show apparent areas of over-
lap between the Orange and Red-headed Bullfinches, the Red-headed and
Red-breasted Bullfinches and between both of these latter and the Brown
Bullfinch.
These maps are, however, necessarily small scale and it seems uncertain
whether any two bullfinch species actually breed in the same place. If
they do, one would expect to find differences of voice, behaviour or habi-
tat (or all three). So far as I know, such have not been recorded but that
means little as I know of no detailed study of any of these species.
Ecology and behaviour ofP. pyrrhula
These notes refer only to the Bullfinch in Britain and Germany, where
it has been much studied and where I have (Britain only) observed it. They
are not intended to be comprehensive and are biased towards what I have
myself seen. Anyone requiring fuller information, indeed anyone seriously
interested in this lovely bird, should also read Nicolai's important paper on
it and the relevant sections of Newton's excellent book on the European
finches.
The Bullfinch is a bird of deciduous, mixed and coniferous forest, prob-
ably under natural conditions in or near the forest edge or other areas
where there are bushes, shrubs, young trees and small open areas as well as
fully mature trees. In Britain it is found widely on the mainland, occurring
in most places where there is a combination of suitable bush and tree
cover for nesting, roosting and resting and where food is available. It often
breeds in churchyards, young conifer plantations, large tree- and bush-
grown gardens, and even in hedges in partially open country. It is often
said that it has increased greatly in recent decades and is now common in
towns and open farmland as well as in its former haunts. Well, although
the Bullfinch occurs in small numbers in some large town gardens or
parks with plenty of cover, it certainly cannot (in Britain) be thought of as
a town or park bird in the sense that Blue Tits and Blackbirds, let alone
feral pigeons and House Sparrows, are. As for the open farmland, I have
yet to see a Bullfinch (other than one passing in flight overhead from one
wood to another) more than 50 yards (and very seldom more than five)

from the nearest bush or tree, or a Bullfinch's nest in a farmland hedge
more than 100 yards from the nearest wood, coppice or orchard.
In captivity, and probably also in a wild state, Bullfinches pair for life
in their first winter or spring although earlier they may form temporary
pair bonds with a bird of either sex (Nicolai). In spring and summer wild
Bullfinches are usually seen in pairs, except for cocks whose mates are
sitting, pairs with flying young and recently bereaved individuals. In
autumn and winter one often sees presumed pairs, sometimes two birds
of the same sex, keeping company, and very often small parties of from
three to ten individuals. Such parties often show a preponderence of one
sex and this is not necessarily related to the general sex ratio in the area.
One may come upon a feeding group of, say, five hens and one cock and
then a half mile or less away another of, say, six cocks and two hens. The
largest party of Bullfinches I have ever seen was about 20 birds together.
The hen Bullfinch takes the initiative in pair formation by a symbolic
threatening of the cock, to which he, if sexually responsive, responds by
fluffing out his pink flanks, angling his glossy tail towards the hen, and
flying short distances from her in a peculiar manner. This display serves,
Nicolai discovered, to establish the cock's dominance over the hen; after
this, further courtship, which involves mutual bill-touching and later the
cock feeding the hen, can follow. If the cock is not interested, he flies
right away at the hen's first overtures but in captivity, where he cannot
do this, he is likely to be chased and beaten up by the infuriated hen. 'Hell
hath no fury .'. Nicolai found that a healthy cock Bullfinch has an
absolute inhibition against attacking or even defending himself against a
hen. This, of course, does not apply to Bullfinches that have been imprinted
on humans and are not reacting socially to their own kind. These may
actually kill hen Bullfinches misguidedly imprisoned with them, as did the
late Frances Pitt's famous 'Bully' (Pitt).
The Bullfinch nests in bushes, hedges, shrubs, young conifers and
climbers such as Honeysuckle. The nest is most often near the periphery of
the tree, bush or etc. and well screened by vegetation. This position makes
it rather difficult for a person to find although when in deciduous growth
it is easy to see once the leaves have fallen. The nest consists of two parts,
a shallow platform and surround of small twigs, and an inner cup of fine
roots and occasionally root-like fibres and horsehairs. The roots are often
collected from the ground on woodland paths and one can often see the
hen tugging at them while her mate, who accompanies her, appears only
to 'lend moral support'. In reality, his alert, not pre-occupied presence
probably lessens the risk of her being surprised by some predator when
busy collecting nesting material.

other finches, the cock Bullfinch takes the lead in searching for a nest
site and calling his mate's attention to it but she alone builds the nest.
The contrary has sometimes been thought owing to the facts that the cock
has a sexual display in which he shows or presents symbolic nest material
to his mate and that he sometimes briefly sits and 'nest-calls' in a partly
built nest. The eggs, usually four or five, are pale blue with small dark
reddish markings which are usually concentrated in a zone round the
larger end of the egg. The hen alone incubates and broods the young, fed
by the cock. Both sexes collect food for the young when they are old
enough for the hen to leave them unbrooded by day.
The Bullfinch feeds primarily on seeds. Here, as elsewhere, I use the
term 'seed', 'fruit' and 'berry' in their everyday meanings regardless of
whether or not they would be technically so termed by the professional
botanist. Among other reasons for so-doing is that birds agree with the
'ignorant' non-botanist; seed-eating and fruit-eating birds, respectively,
take what the layman would call seeds or fruits regardless of, and some-
times contrary to, their botanical classifications. The Bullfinch eats a
variety of seeds from many species of herbaceous plants, shrubs, bushes,
trees and creepers. These include the seeds of some fruits and berries such
as those of the Honeysuckle, Rowan and Bramble. Captive Bullfinches
will sometimes eat fruit pulp but I have not seen any evidence of wild
birds doing so, though they may ingest some juice in the course of separa-
ting out and dealing with the seeds. I have not seen a wild Bullfinch
show any interest in a fruit, such as that of the Yew, whose seed was
clearly 'impossible' for it and Bramble seeds are not usually fed on until
winter when the 'blackberries' that contained them have dried and shri-
velled. Among plants and trees whose seeds are, at any rate in Kent and
Surrey, taken in quantity by the Bullfinch are the Dandelion, Sow Thistle,
Stinging Nettle, Meadowsweet, wild violets Viola spp., some docks (I am
afraid I do not know which species these are), Honeysuckle, Silver Birch
and Ash. Very hard seeds, such as those of the Hornbeam, so beloved by
the Greenfinch and the Hawfinch, do not appear to be taken by the
Bullfinch.
In late winter and early spring, the Bullfinch also eats buds, chiefly
flowerbuds of which the outer parts are discarded and only the embryonic
centres swallowed. Under natural conditions wild Pear, Hawthorn, Black-
thorn and Crab Apple seem among the most favoured and, unfortunately
for the Bullfinch, the often more nutritious buds of many of our cultiva-
ted fruit trees are preferred by it when available. Newton found that the
damage done in orchards depended largely on the supplies of Ash seed
available in late winter and early spring and that, in general, the failure
of the Ash to produce a good crop every second year resulted in a cor-

respondingly greater amount of bud-eating in such years.
Bullfinches prefer to feed perching on the tree or plant but will often
come onto the ground, especially on a path in or alongside a wood or cop-
pice, to feed from very low or prostrate plants or to search for fallen seeds.
They do not hold catkins, seed-heads and the like under one or both feet
when feeding, as Redpolls, Siskins and Goldfinches do, nor can they hang
upside down like the Blue Tit. They are, however, able to stretch upwards,
downwards or to either side to seize food with the bill to a remarkable
degree while still keeping firm hold of their perch. Very frequently one
can watch Bullfinches, Redpolls and a pair of Blue Tits all feeding in the
same seeding Birch, each species using different techniques and consequently
different movements and postures.
Dandelion seeds are often a major food, especially where these plants
are growing at the outskirts of a wood or along a woodland path. Unlike
the Goldfinch which prefers the ripe seeds of the fully opened Dandelion
'clock', the Bullfinch prefers them when they are already brown but
before the seed head has opened of itself. The bird bites through the
covering near the base of the (former) flower head to get at the seeds.
When feeding on Sow Thistle, especially if this is growing in a place a bit
too open for the bird's peace of mind, the Bullfinch often hovers prettily
to pluck a billful of vegetable down and seeds and carries them off to a
perch to deal with. I have also seen the Bullfinch hover in order to pick
(presumed) insects or other small invertebrates from the undersides of
leaves. So far as I know the Bullfinch and the Goldcrest (presumably also
the rare Firecrest but I have only once ever seen this species feeding and
then it did not) are the only British species to use this hummingbird-like
tactic.
Nicolai found that in his study area Bullfinches took no animal food
even when rearing young. This is, however, not everywhere the case. I
have seen Bullfinches in southern England that were undoubtedly collect-
ing small invertebrates though I was not able to be certain what. Newton
records caterpillars, small spiders and small snails as fed to the nestlings.
Rather surprisingly, the snails were de-shelled. I suspect that they would
not be so treated at the period of maximum bone growth of the young.
The Bullfinch and Man
Man must have affected the Bullfinch, and all other birds, by his altera-
tions of the environment. Little or nothing is, however, known about the
Bullfinch in primaeval Europe, certainly nothing of its status in Britain
before man started messing around with things. I shall, therefore, here
confine myself to some brief notes on the interactions of the Bullfinch
with man in his role of bird keeper and 'vermin' destroyer.

D. GOODWIN - BULLFINCHES
Its beauty, comparative 'steadiness' even when wild-caught, and the
ability of at least some hand-reared cocks to learn to pipe tunes, formerly
made the Bullfinch a popular cage and aviary bird. In the middle of the
last century, Mayhew found that it was a favourite pet bird with London-
ers. A good young Bullfinch then fetched from 2 shillings and 6d. to
3 shillings (more than many people then earned for a day's work) and a
piping bird 3 guineas. In my childhood in the late 1920s and early 1930s,
the price had only risen to 5 or 6 shillings for cocks and about half that
for hens.
Mayhew estimated that about 30,000 Bullfinches were brought yearly
to London for sale, many from the immediately surrounding country but
some from further afield. These figures seem rather dreadful but it is
doubtful if the worst excesses of the cage bird trade involved (in Britain)
more, if as many, Bullfinches as are now killed as 'vermin'. Newton (writ-
ing, or at least publishing, in 1972) states that on 'the average fruit farm' a
few hundred are killed annually but over a thousand on any Targe farm in
well-wooded country'.
Needless to say, any aviculturist who takes even a couple of young Bull-
finches would render himself liable to prosecution unless he has a licence
permitting him to do so. Which licence I do not think he would easily get
unless he had 'friends at court'. As I have no personal post-childhood ex-
periences of Bullfinch-keeping, I will say no more on the subject except to
hope that some of our members who do keep and breed this bird will tell
us of their observations on it, and to refer other to Nicolai's work.
Trapping in cage traps baited with seeding docks is the officially recom-
mended method of destroying Bullfinches (Newton) but the bird has been
much shot at in the past (and probably still is) and I think it is shooting
rather than trapping that has made the Bullfinch in Britain usually more
afraid of man than other finches (except the Hawfinch). Up until the very
recent past the Goldfinch was trapped at least as much as the Bullfinch
and it (the Goldfinch) is usually the least timid of our finches except for
the Redpoll and Siskin.
The Bullfinch is, apparently, much less afraid of man in Germany
(Lohrl, Nicolai). Lohrl indeed compares it with the Siskin for its trustful-
ness (Vertrautheit) and fearlessness (Furchtlosigkeit) towards man, a com-
parison that would certainly not be apt in any part of Britain where I have
observed these two species.
The Bullfinch, although timid, is not wary or suspicious. It is easy to
stalk and it often fails to notice the watcher if he or she is still. If, how-
ever, it does notice a human approaching, it will usually flee sooner than
would a Chaffinch, Greenfinch or Linnet and much sooner than would a
Goldfinch, Redpoll or Siskin. This is especially the case if it is on or near

the ground or in some open space. If it is feeding well up in a tree, it will
(at least in areas where it is seldom shot at) often allow the watcher to
approach more closely.
Bishop Mant (though he seems to have seen an unusually brilliant cock
Bullfinch) perfectly describes the bird's usual reactions to man in a verse
I cannot resist quoting:
Deep in the thorn's entangled maze,
Or where the fruit-trees thick'ning sprays
Yield a secure and close retreat
The dusky Bullfinch plans her seat:
There, where you see the clustered boughs
Put forth the opening bud, her spouse
With mantle grey and jet-like head,
And flaming breast of crimson red,
Is perched with hard and hawk-like beak,
Intent the embryo fruit to seek,
Nor ceases from his pleasing toil
The orchard's budding hope to spoil,
Unless with quick and timid glance
Of his dark eye, your dread advance
He notice, and your search evade
Hid in the thicket's pathless shade.
Bishop Mant's bird poems are 'spot on' for accurate observations as
here where he knew that the frightened Bullfinch nearly always flees
into thick cover. Other finches when disturbed by man either fly up
and away, or up into some tree.
Voice
Partly because of my ignorance of modern techniques of voice study
and partly to keep this article within what I hope are reasonable limits, I
shall not deal with this aspect of the Bullfinch except to say that most of
its calls are low pitched, often audible at a surprising distance in view of
their softness, and entirely pleasing. The same is true of its short song.
Nicolai (1956) deals in detail with the Bullfinch's voice.
The Bullfinch and the Jay: some intriguing parallels
The Jay Garrulus glandarius is one of many nest predators on the eggs
and young of the Bullfinch. The two species are well apart in their feeding
habits. Apart from the fact that, at least in many parts of Britain, both
have man as their most potent and destructive enemy, they have in com-

mon that they frequent rather similar habitat. Indeed, if one made allow-
ances for size and mentally 'scaled down' (or up) the habitat when com-
paring, then one might say very similar habitat.
The Bullfinch shows four intriguing resemblances to the Jay which, if
they are not mere coincidence, must be adaptations to habitat in a broad
sense (certainly not to feeding behaviour or foods within that habitat),
and, if they are mere coincidence, are still more surprising. These are:

(1) The nest is built of the same materials and although not exactly a
miniature version of a Jay's nest (the twig portion is more plat-
form-like as a rule) is very near it.
(2) Both species have a white rump patch and a blackish tail, a com-
bination of features possessed by few other species of finch and by
no other species of jay.
(3) Both species have a bi-coloured ornamental innermost secondary;
black and dull red in the Bullfinch, black and chestnut in the Jay.
(4) Both species differ from most other members of their family in
that they usually flee from man into cover, not 'up and away'.

As the contrary is so often stated, it seems pertinent here to emphasise
that all races and all species of bullfinches are sexually dichromatic, even
if, to human eyes, some are more obviously so than others.

RECHERCHE ISLAND GEESE
Cereopsis novaehollandiae griseus
By DAVID CROMPTON
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.987737055555555" page_id="56953667"  page_num="157" year="" vol="">
(The Wildfowl Trust, Martin Mere, Lancashire)
Although only comparatively recently 'rediscovered' as a separate sub-
species, the Cape Barren Geese from the islands off Western Australia were
given the scientific name Anser griseus Vieillot as early as 1818 (Vieillot,
1818). Frith (1982) suggests that the population of geese in the Recherche
Archipelago is no more than 500; thus it is one of the world's rarest wild-
fowl.
On a visit to the Australian Agriculture Department's Poultry Research
Station at Wembley in 1979, members of the Western Australian Wildlife
Authority Bird Committee viewed adjacent pens containing Cereopsis
stock from Tasmania, South Australia, and the Recherche Islands. The lat-
ter birds were readily distinguishable by coloration: their most noticeable
features were the greater extent of white on the crown and neck, the paler
pink of the legs, and the fact that the black of the feet extended up the
front of the leg as far as the 'knee'. An impression that the birds were
sturdier was verified by their heavier weights (Storr, 1980).
Of the eight birds in question (five males and three females) two pairs
were offered to the Wildfowl Trust and were received into quarantine late
in the autumn of 1982. A further pair was retained by Perth Zoo. Shortly
after release from quarantine, the pairs were divided between the Trust's
Slimbridge and Martin Mere reserves. During March both pairs nested, the
first eggs being laid at Martin Mere on the 15th and at Slimbridge on the
19th. At Martin Mere subsequent eggs were laid on the 17th, 19th, 21st,
24th and 25th when incubation commenced. At candling two weeks later,
all the Martin Mere eggs were found to be fertile but, sadly, the Slimbridge
ones were clear.
At the end of 35 days' incubation, the eggs were again examined and
although two had addled, four were still viable and on 2nd May, 39 days
after incubation commenced, there were four newly-hatched young in the
nest. These goslins were left with their parents for rearing and no problems
were encountered. In general they seemed stockier and darker, particularly
on the back, than 'normal' Cereopsis goslings. Sexing revealed that we had
two pairs. Growth rate and time to fledging were normal for the species;
however, as juveniles the voices of the Recherche birds seemed to be of a
higher pitch and remained so until they reached adolescence.
The youngsters were separated from their parents in September and

were sent to Slim bridge, one pair remaining there, the other going on
breeding loan to a private collection. The adult Slimbridge birds were
removed to Martin Mere. This pair started nesting again on 19th Novem-
ber, five eggs being laid up to 28th November, but again all were infertile.
On 11th December, the original Martin Mere pair laid once more and
started incubating on the 21st. Sadly, these goslings did not survive due to
inclement weather at the time.
A small experiment was carried out on the Slimbridge pair after their
second failure, involving feather clipping around the cloaca of both birds.
Obligingly this pair re-nested at 14 days, three eggs were clear but the
other two seemed viable, and one hatched on 5th March.
Of 20 eggs laid by two geese, the average weight has been 124.5 g and
the linear dimensions 78.3 x 53.7 mm. These measurements are not sig-
nificantly different from those of eggs laid by South Australian birds; a
larger sample produced by many more females is required.
Recherche Cereopsis seem to require no different management tech-
niques from the nominate race, but observations suggest that they are
less aggressive towards humans, even during the breeding season and at
the nest site, although other geese and ducks provoke territorial behaviour.
Apart from an incubation period four days longer than expected, the only
other peculiarity of the two imported pairs appears to be a reluctance to
moult; none has so far shed any flight feathers, although some body moult
has occurred.*

CONSERVING THE ALEUTIAN CANADA GOOSE AND THE
WHITE-WINGED WOOD DUCK AT THE WILDFOWL TRUST
By RALPH HODGSON

<bodyText confidence="0.969215" page_id="56953670"  page_num="160" year="" vol="">
(Wildfowl Trust, Slimbridge, Gloucestershire)
The Aleutian Canada Goose cannot now be classed as endangered but it
is certainly a rare species, particularly in captivity. Its sole habitat was the
1100-mile chain of Aleutian Islands stretching south and west of Alaska
where, in the early 1900s, they could be found breeding in thousands. In
attempts to develop fur farming, residents in Alaska released Arctic Foxes
on almost all these islands with the result that after World War II just a
handful of these geese could be found surviving precariously only on the
4000-acre island of Buldir near the Asian end of the chain. This island,
isolated, and with no harbour, had escaped the fur farming venture and the
US Fish and Wildlife Service decided that a fully-fledged endangered spe-
cies recovery programme was justified. A plan was formulated to clear the
major islands of Arctic Foxes and so increase the natural habitat and it was
decided to rear goslings in captivity in the USA for restocking the cleared
islands.
The first 18 goslings were taken on Buldir in 1963 and in 1966 the first
generation of captive Aleutian Geese hatched successfully. To reduce the
risk of disease and to spread the gene pool, several other breeders joined
the production efforts but the return of captive-bred geese to native nest-
ing grounds presented problems, one of which involved their winter migra-
tion, as no one knew where they spent the winter months. It was not until
1974 that this secret was resolved - they went to the northern coastal areas
of California.
Since then several hundred Aleutian Geese have been bred and reared in
North America and the programme of re-introduction on fox-free islands
has continued, together with interim protection on their wintering
grounds. In 1967 the US Fish and Wildlife Service sent a pair of Aleutians
to the Wildfowl Trust on breeding loan and subsequently a further male
and two females were received from America. As far as we know, these are
the only Aleutian Geese to come to Europe.
The first pair bred at Slimbridge in 1973 and have bred every year since
then, a total of 82 reared over 12 years . There are now (January 1985)
over 50 Aleutian Geese alive in Europe and of those originating in the
United States, only the original pair still survive, now 18 years old. The
remainder are held in the various trust centres and by a limited number
o f recognised breeders.

R. HODGSON - ALEUTIANCANADA GOOSE&amp;WHITE-WINGED WOOD DUCK 161
The White-winged Wood Duck is in rather a different category. Its
natural habitat is the rain forests of Asia, in particular Assam, East Pakis-
tan and Thailand. This habitat is being gradually destroyed and the prob-
lem is to ensure the permanent protection of sufficient natural habitat to
justify survival and possibly re-introduction from captive-bred stock.
The first White-winged Wood Ducks to arrive at Slimbridge were wild-
caught in Thailand in 1955 and consisted of six males and four females.
In those days our aviary accommodation was limited and we also had con-
siderable difficulty in finding the right food. The birds survived but we had
no success in breeding and the last one died in 1961. Then, under the aus-
pices of the World Wildlife Fund, we received two consignments from
Assam in 1969 and 1970, which gave us four pairs of these very rare birds
from which are descended all the present population in Europe and the
USA.
To reduce the risk of disease, young birds have been distributed on
breeding loan to other Trust centres and recognised breeders, including
the Jersey Wildlife Trust. This latter Trust has been very successful and has
already sent back to the Wildfowl Trust a number of young birds. We now
have over 100 of this species registered in our Stud Book and within the
next year or so we should be in a position to plan a programme for re-in-
t reduction to a suitable habitat in its natural homeland. We have also
been able to send about four pairs on breeding loan to the United States,
where they have already had considerable breeding success. In 1984 we
were able to send birds to Hongkong and Thailand and thus establish a
breeding nucleus close to their natural habitat.

THE FEEDING AND BREEDING OF THREE POICEPHAL US
PARROTS IN CAPTIVITY AND IN THE WILD

I wish to list some findings by aviculturists on nesting, and by ornitho-
logists on feeding, in the hope that it may fill some gaps in Forshaw's
splendidly lavish work, Parrots of the World.
Blancou suspected that the Niam Niam Parrot P. crassus nests during
the August-September rains. Nothing is known of its breeding habits in its
natural state. In Mozambique three recently caught adult birds were placed
in an aviary measuring 2.4 m (8 ft) high, 1.5 m (5 ft) wide and 3.6 m
(12 ft) long. Banana leaves were fastened to the wire netting on the sides
of the aviary to give the birds as much privacy as possible until they had
become accustomed to their new home. The birds were not disturbed,
except to place the food and water just inside the door. After two months
the spare bird, which was being mercilessly pecked by the other two, was
removed and placed in a flight with a Brown-headed Parrot.
Nest-boxes and natural logs, which contained observation holes at the
back, were hung up at the far end of the flight. There was no activity from
the birds, which were assumed to be a pair, for three weeks. They were
then seen to enter the natural logs four or five times a day. A single egg
soon appeared, with three others being laid at daily intervals. Only the
female incubated. The male spent long periods in the nest during the day.
Only three chicks hatched^ the first hatched at 27 days and was covered
in a fine greyish white down. Both adults fed the chicks, which left the
nest at 13 weeks after hatching. They were strong on the wing within a
few days but were dependent mostly on the male for food for the next
two weeks, returning to the nest each night with the female to roost.
These parrots feed on a variety of seeds. Stomach contents revealed
partly digested millet and pale yellow seeds. Nothing further seems to
have been recorded in the wild. In captivity they accepted a basic diet
of two parts sunflower seed and one part mixed canary seed. Fruit given
consisted of apple and orange, with no interest shown in guava and plum.
Greens eaten were beans, peas (in the pod) and cabbage stalks as well as
corn-on-the-cob (maize). The young were reared on putu, a favourite
food of the local Africans which is made by boiling maize meal in water
until the water evaporates causing it to form into lumps similar to that
of dry porridge. They also had hand-baked bread dampened with water
or goat's milk.

N. BRICKELL - THREE POICEPHALUS PARROTS
Though the Ruppell's Parrot Poicephalus rueppellii is common, little
is known of its nesting in the natural state, except for three records,
namely: in the nest-hole of a Baobab Adansonia digitata ; the dead branch
of a Brachystegia tree and in an Acacia in what appeared to be an old
woodpecker's hole. Breeding has been recorded in February (three eggs),
May (chicks in nest) and June and September (juveniles collected) and
August (chicks in nest). Further information was gathered from a success-
ful aviary breeding. Four eggs were laid on a layer of decayed willow pulp
in a standard-type parrot nesting box. Incubation, which lasted 30 days,
started when the last egg was laid. Only the female brooded though the
male sat in the nest-box with her during the day; both parents fed the
chicks. The young left the nest at five weeks but did not fly for some
time, only roosting above the box (pers. comm. Coetzee). This early
departure may be due to a disturbance at the nest. The duration of a
second nesting period was 58 days (Nelson, 1974). Adult plumage is
acquired approximately 14 weeks after leaving the nest (pers. comm.
Abrey, 1980).
This parrot feeds on seeds, fruit and buds and shoots. It has been
recorded feeding on the seeds of Leadwood Combretum imberbe, Blue-
thorn Acacia erubescem , Ana tree A. albida and Sweet-thorn A. karoo
as well as its golden-yellow blossoms, and shoots and seeds of Ele-
phant's Foot Elephantorrhiza. Fruit in the form of wild figs Ficus and
seeds of wild melons. In captivity, the daily diet may include spinach,
peas in their pods, stalks of cabbage, young lettuce, thistle and Brus-
sel sprouts; also the green shoots of Blue Gum and Silver Oak. Fruit
such as apple, orange, peaches, soft pear, figs, plums, soaked raisins and
currants; also shelled ground nuts and corn-on-the-cob.
Many nests of the Meyer's Parrot P. meyeri have been recorded in
recent years, giving information on nest measurements, clutch sizes and
growth of chicks but the incubation and nestling periods have not been
acurately measured in the wild. Aviculturists have indicated the incuba-
tion period at 29-31 days and nestling period at eight to nine weeks.
Recorded feeding on the pods, fruits or nuts of Narrow-leaved Mahoboho-
bo Uapaca nitida , Pale-fruited Monotes Monotes glaber, Russet Bush
Willow Combretum hereroense, Rough-leaved Rasin Grewia flavescens,
Manila Sclerocarya caffra, Kudu-berry Pseudolachnostylis maprouneifolia,
Buffalo-thorn Ziziphus mucronata, Syringa Melia azedarach, Cross-berry
Grewia occidentals, flowers of Weeping-boer-bean Schotia brachypetala,
seeds of Brachystegia and other leguminous trees and it is suspected that
the seed pods of Black monkey-thorn Acacia burkei are eaten. Occasion-
ally troublesome in cultivation, feeding on maize, sorghum and millet.
They also raid orchards as they are fond of oranges and Figs.

GRASS-CARRYING DISPLAY IN THE BICHENO FINCH
Poephila hichenovii
By A.J. MOBBS
(West Midlands)
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.999401527777778" page_id="56953676"  page_num="166" year="" vol="">
Nowhere in the literature can I find a description of grass-carrying in
the sexual display of the Bicheno Finch.
Having recently observed two cocks in my collection carrying out this
procedure, I felt it should be recorded.
Both cocks had been housed with a hen in their respective breeding
cages for two weeks and the hens had already begun to lay their first
clutch of the season. In each case, a nest-box had been provided, first
being filled with a mixture of soft hay and coconut fibre hollowed out
to form a nest-hole. Also a small amount of nesting material had been
placed on the floor of each breeding cage.
The courting display was as described by various authors (Cayley, 1932;
Morris, 1958; Goodwin, 1982; Immelmann, 1982), except that the exces-
sive bill-wiping (described by Morris) has yet to be observed, although
this behaviour, in a more subdued form, has been seen from time to time.
The courtship display of one cock bird when the hen was introduced
can only be described as perfunctory as the cock was seen to bill-wipe
no more than six times in approximately 60 seconds, after which he
mounted the hen and copulation took place. The cock was silent through-
out.
Mating has not been observed in the second pair; however, the cock is
extremely vocal (for a Bicheno Finch) and can be heard and seen singing
many times throughout the day.
When the grass-carrying sequence was observed, in both cases the cock
bird was displaying from a perch opposite to that of its respective hen,
the latter appearing to take little interest in the performance.
Both cocks chose a piece of dried grass some 200 mm in length and
it was noticeable that the grass selected was unlike that which would be
used for nest-building in that it was somewhat thick and not in the least
pliable. The cocks were not observed taking up the grass, but were first
encountered when the grass was already being held in the beak. Through-
out the sequence, both cocks faced their respective hens. Both cocks were
seen to give a series of bows with the beak held in a horizontal position
at all times. As the birds became upright after each bow, the legs were
stretched to their utmost and the feet appeared (on occasions) to leave the
perch slightly (no more than 3 mm). The grass-carrying sequence, as I ob-
served it, lasted for approximately two minutes in both cases, after which

the birds released the grass allowing it to fall to the cage floor. Because I
entered the birdroom when the sequence was "already underway, I feel
that both birds may have ceased the activity described through distur-
bance rather than because the sequence had been completed. As both
cocks were already carrying out the grass-carrying sequence when I entered
the birdroom, it is impossible to estimate the length of time the sequence
may be carried out.
Perhaps it should be mentioned that throughout the grass-carrying pro-
cedure, both, cocks were silent.

LONDON ZOO - 1984

Despite a rather cold and wet start to 1984, the number of species and
individuals bred was approximately the same as in the previous year. The
majority of birds in the collection are now captive-bred, being either
hatched here or in other collections.
Almost all of those species which breed in colonies are in groups which
are entirely or mainly composed of captive-bred individuals. For example,
the colony of Black-footed (Jackass) Penguins now numbers 19, and of
these 13 were bred here, nine being handreared. One bird, 'Cherry&amp;apos;,
hatched in 1977 and our first successful handrearing, has herself paired
and laid. These eggs have been artificially incubated and the chicks subse-
quently handreared. Thus our worry that a handreared bird might not
breed has been dispelled. For this species the main advantages in taking
away the eggs are that egg-stealers are defeated, and there can be greater

control over incubation and the diets of the chicks. Although hand-feeding
is hard work and involves the careful preparation of food, it is still worth-
while. Four birds were reared in this way in 1984.
Of those species breeding in colonies which rear their own young, the
most noteworthy are the Abdim's Storks and Chilean Flamingos. The Ab-
dim's Storks nest on platforms 7 ft (2.14 m) from the ground in an en-
closed aviary, and the Chilean Flamingos nest on the Three Island Pond on
an area where the nest sites are separated from the public by a series of
waterways and small islands. In both cases it is enjoyable and educational
for visitors to watch the birds caring for their young. Of the Abdim's Stork
group, all 20 birds were captive-bred, 14 of them at London, including
four this year. The Chilean Flamingo colony is now composed of 41 birds
of which at least 20 are captive-bred, and of these 18 were bred here, in-
cluding five this year.
A success of particular interest was the handrearing of a Bateleur Eagle.
On a bitterly cold day in January the Bateleur Eagle laid her egg in an
untidy nest of twigs which was balanced precariously on a platform in the
back of the aviary. By 20th January, because of the nervousness of the
female and the weather conditions, it was decided to take the egg away to
the safety of an incubator. Here it was kept at a temperature of 36.5-
37.5*C with a relative humidity of 50-55%, and turned manually five
times daily. On 29th February the first signs of hatching were seen when a
minute crack appeared at the blunt end of the egg. The egg, still in the
incubator^ was placed on damp towelling in a wire box and the humidity
raised to 60-70%. By then the chick could be heard faintly calling from
within the egg, but little movement could be detected. The chick was in an
abnormal position inside the egg, and so on 1st March a few pieces of
shell around the crack were gently removed. On the following day at 12.00
a fragile looking chick was helped out of the shell. The total incubation
period had been 55 days. On 3rd March the tiny chick, weighing only
109.9 g, was put into a human incubator at a temperature of 34.6*C. At
14.10 on the same day the chick, still weak and incapable of holding its
head up, received its first meal - selected pieces of freshly killed mice
dusted with a vitamin/mineral supplement. Over the following weeks the
chick grew slowly but steadily. At its last weighing, when nearly 10 weeks
old, it weighed 1990 g, not much less than its father. The plumage of the
young bird is mainly a golden brown and it will probably be at least six
years and repeated moults before the black, white and chestnut plumage
of the adult develops.
Other noteworthy breeding successes included the artificial incubation
and handrearing of a Stone Curlew (parents captive-bred at the Norfolk
Wildlife Park and kindly presented to the Zoo in 1982), four Crowned

of owl, including, for the first time in this collection and very rarely else-
where, the White-faced Scops Owl.
By the end of 1984 it was obvious that the Bird of Prey aviaries, built
in 1910 from a design by the architect-trained Curator of Birds, David
Seth-Smith, had come to the end of their life, and would need to be demo-
lished.
The aviaries had lasted, virtually unchanged in shape and size, for
nearly 75 years. There is some sadness at losing the aviaries, which have
been such a prominent feature of the Zoo for a long time, but their
removal was inevitable.
Of the birds housed in these aviaries and elsewhere, we aim to keep at
least seven potential breeding pairs - Egyptian Vulture, Black Kite, Brah-
miny Kite, Long-legged Buzzard, Bateleur Eagle, Harrier Hawk and Com-
mon Buzzard - and a small number of individuals. Most will be kept, at
least for a while, in the Eastern Aviary and Sothern Aviary. Altogether
we still have 11 species of raptor.
By the end of 1984, potential homes for the birds of prey of which we
would need to dispose, had been found. These included other zoos and
private collections, and in some cases single birds had the opportunity of
joining other single birds of the same species.
More and more co-operative schemes for the management and breeding
of various species are being put into effect and as part of these schemes
a number of birds were sent to other collections, or were taken in on loan.
Examples of such movements included the despatch of 12 Grey-headed
Gulls to Berlin Zoo, and the receipt of breeding pairs of Congo Peafowl
from Antwerp Zoo.

A NOTE FROM EAST BERLIN ZOO
Pair of Harpy Eagles with young in East Berlin Zoo
In a letter dated 27th February 1985, Dieter Minneman of the Tierpark
Berlin writes: 'This year we have had in Berlin a very hard winter. The
temperature was for a long time minus 20 degrees Celsius. It gave some
problems with my birds of prey. Some kinds, e.g. condor, vultures and
eagles, I had to put into heated accommodation. Some of my species
from cold areas, e.g. Himalayan Griffon Gyps himalayensis , Bearded Vul-
ture Gypaetus barbatus and Bald Eagle Haliaeetus leucocephalus are be-
ginning to breed. My pair of Harpy Eagles Harpia harpyia hatched a young
one on 17th January. One week before a young African Fish Eagle Hal-
iaeetus vocifer hatched in an incubator. This I believe may be a world

NEW YEAR'S DAY AT ALMA-ATA ZOO

Despite the fact that New Year's Eve is celebrated in the grand manner
in the Soviet Union, and alcohol there is not entirely unknown, two orni-
thologists (Anatoly Gistsov and Ernar Auezov) turned up promptly, as
promised, at 11.00 a.m. at my hotel on 1st January, 1985, to escort me
on foot to the Alma-Ata Zoo. Alma-Ata is the capital city of the Soviet
Republic of Kazakhstan, and lies only 200 km from the border with the
Sinkiang province of the People's Republic of China.
January temperatures average -8* Celsius here but December 1984 had
seen days with -30* and New Year's Day was -20*. Mixed flocks of Car-
rion Crows of the "Hooded" race Corvus corone comix and feral Rock
Pigeons Columba livia hustled in the yards of the wooden houses for
breadcrumbs sprinkled on the snow there by housewives.
In the grounds of the Zoo itself, scroungers were commoner. It was
feeding time for the hardier waterfowl, kept outside. Three species of Old
World Swan, Cygnus olor, C columbianus and C cygnus, White-fronted
Geese Anser albifrons , Bar-headed Geese Anser indicus, Mallard Anas
platyrhynchos and so on were crowded into a small area of open water
surrounded by ice. But much of the grain thrown down for them must
have ended up in the crops of 50 Hoodies, a hundred House Sparrows
Passer domesticus and at least a score of Laughing Doves Streptopelia
senegalensis and the one Collared Dove S. decaocto.
Other water birds were confined in heated houses. In one such house
were assembled Cormorants Phalacrocorax carbo, Spoonbills Platalea leuco-
rodia, Grey Herons Ardea cinerea , Cattle and Little Egrets Bubulcus ibis
and Egretta garzetta, Black Storks Ciconia nigra and White and Dalmatian
Pelicans Pelecanus onocrotalus andP. crispus.
The gulls that shared the house were of particular interest to me. Not
only was there a Lesser Black-backed Lams fuscus (a long way from its
wild home for so indistinctive a bird!), and its more easily explained
cousin the Herring Gull L. argentatus, there were two adult Great Black-
headed Gulls L. ichthyaetus , one in apparently full summer plumage
and both 12 years old. This species I had previously seen in winter plu-
mage in Abu Dhabi, but the memory in no way lessened the pleasure
of the resplendent New Year's Day bird. Even more exciting was to set
eyes on a living Relict Gull L. relictus (another of the so-called "hooded"
gulls) with a Black-headed Gull L. ridibundus standing right next to it

for easy comparison. Both were in winter plumage. The bird was pointed
out to me, appropriately enough, by Ernar Auezov Ernar is a truly local
ornithologist, an ethnic Kazakh, a shy man with immense knowledge of
Kazakh birds. It was he who in 1968 discovered the Relict Gull, a
species new to science, having found a colony of them on a tiny island in
Lake Alakol, a salt lake about 340 m above sea level.
By now (13.00 hours) Valery Khrokov, a professional wader enthu-
siast, had joined the party as had the Curator of Birds at the Zoo, Ikar
Borodikhin. With justifiable pride Ikar showed me the Zoo's birds of
prey. An egg was expected to appear that day or the next in the "nest"
of a pair of Lammergeiers Gypaetus barhatus. In 1983 the female had
laid on 27th December. Since 1972 this pair has reared a total of nine
young. Himalayan Griffon Vultures Gyps himalayensis numbered four,
Black Vultures Aegypius monachus also four. The Zoo's falcons included
a trio of beautiful Lanners Falco biarmicus and several Sakers F. cherrug.
The four Gyr Falcons (F. gyrfalco of Soviet taxonomy) had been taken by
Borodikhin as eyasses from an eyrie on the Yamal Peninsula in the Arctic
Ocean. Two Central Asian Peregrines (F. pelegrinoides of Soviet taxo-
nomy) completed the quartet of handsome long-wings.
Two Steller's Sea Eagles Haliaeetus pelagicus were present and four
White-tailed Eagles H. albicilla. The largest flight cage held five Imperial
Aquila heliaca and eight Steppe Eagles A rapax.
One of the four Golden Eagles A. chrysaetos was a bird trained for
falconry (a form of aviculture, of course), by one of the Zoo's keepers,
Abilkhak Turlibaev. During his one month's vacation in the previous
(1983-4) winter, at a location about 150 km from Alma-Ata, he had flown
the bird daily while himself mounted on horseback! The quarry? Red
Foxes Vulpes vulpes , of which, during four weeks, his bird caught 13.
Abilkhak's father was both shepherd and falconer - and a commercial fal-
coner in the sense that he sold the fox skins to supplement his winter in-
come. With the passing of the older generation this practice is dying out,
though Albilkhak guesses that there may be a hundred such shepherds left
in the Kazakhstan and maybe twice that number next door in the neigh-
bouring Kirghizstan Soviet Socialist Republic. As recently as the 1950s a
thousand such birds were involved in this remarkable example of com-
mercial falconry. The record-holding eagle captured 300 foxes in one
year. A few birds are flown at mountain wolves Canis lupus.
Meanwhile back at the Zoo it was 15.00 hours and I was now joined by
the Assistant Director of the Zoo (a lady) and by an interpreter. After
looking at parrots, pheasants, cranes and ratites, we were served with
coffee, biscuits and syrupy cherry jam and many of my questions were
painstakingly answered. Ikar Borodikhin, who is also a student of wild

birds, presented me with a copy of his (1968) paperback book on the
birds of Alma-Ata. A helpful chart appended to the usual systematic
textual treatment of species allowed me to tot up 46 species normally
present in January. Of these, I had seen, by 17.00 hours, only 10 and of
these only the Laughing Dove was a "new" bird. Given more days' resi-
dence in the city than three, I would have gone in search of the Red-
fronted Serin Serinus pusillus , the Brown Dipper Cinclus pallasii, the
Brown Accentor Prunella fulvescens, the White-winged Spotted Wood-
pecker Picoides leucopterns and others. Next time, perhaps.
Next time also I would like to establish closer contact with the orni-
thologists at the Kazakh Academy of Sciences' Institute of Zoology where
the bird work is directed by Edward Gavrilov. He has at least ten pro-
fessional bird people working under him. Besides the three already men-
tioned there is Anatoly Serna whom I had met at the 18th International
Ornithological Congress in Moscow in 1982. To him and other workers
in the bird section I presented the first three volumes of the Birds of the
Western Palearctic (paid for partly by the sale in the U.K. of Soviet bird
song gramophone records given to me on previous visits to Moscow), and
I received in return no less than 25 volumes on Soviet, mainly Kazakh,
birds. These are now in the Edward Grey Institute Library at Oxford,
where some of them will be used by Michael G. Wilson (a Russian-speaking
British ornithologist) in compiling certain species accounts for Volume 5
et seq. of the Birds of the Western Palearctic. It would appear that I was
the first Western ornithologist to visit Alma-Ata within living memory and
to contact these scientists on their home ground. With so much work going
on, Alma-Ata must surely rank as one of the more active ornithological
centres in the USSR? To judge from the references sections of their papers
they have a better knowledge of our literature than we of theirs.
At 18.00 hours each of us went our separate ways. It was the end of a
freezing but enlightening day.
Except that ............ In bed I flicked through the Kazakh Red Data
Book they had given me. It was Volume 1 on vertebrates. It included 43
birds, starting with two pelicans, two herons, two storks, a spoonbill, an
ibis and a flamingo. Threatened Steppe birds included the Demoiselle
Crane Anthropoides virgo, the Great Bustard Otis tarda, the Little Bustard
Tetrax tetrax and the Houbara Chlamydotis undulata. Rare All-Union
endemics for which responsibility falls largely on Kazakhstan are the
Sociable Plover Chettusia gregaria, the Relict Gull and Pander's Ground
Jay Podoces panderi. The endangered Kazakh bird that I would most like
to see is the Ibisbill Ibidorhyncha struthersii, a strange bird of the pebbly
mountain river beds that is so unusual it is in a family all its own. The

closest I have so far come is to see a film of the species made by a resi-
dent of Alma-Ata, Vyacheslav Belyalov. This species was also ingrained
in the memory of my interpreter-guide. She had once served a party of
British birdwatchers who had not only got her to search for the Ibisbill
through pretty unforgettable terrain, but had got her up before dawn
three mornings in a row!
Time to close the book; but I won't be getting up before dawn!

In the past few years, mention has been made in this column of new
discoveries in the bird world. Yet another has been discovered, this time
on a remote coral atoll off the coast of Sudan. The species concerned has
been christened Red Sea Cliff Swallow Hirundo perdita but a great deal
still remains a mystery for the type specimen was found as a corpse on the
atoll. A thorough search of skins at the British Museum (Natural History)
failed to find the bird and it was duly given the specific name of perdita
(meaning lost) which refers to the fact that the bird was either a migrant
or a vagrant. Speculation now surrounds the locality where the bird will
eventually be found to be resident but top of the list is the hills of Ethio-
pia where a number of new species have been discovered in the last 15
years or so {BBC Wildlife Magazine).

A natural spin-off from the avicultural aspect of birds is observing them
in their natural habitat. It is a pastime I enjoy for, besides learning more
about birds, it is also very relaxing. Having watched birds on four contin-
ents, I have always been happy with whatever happened to be in the local-
ity at the time. I must admit that a record is kept of the species seen but
in no way do I consider myself a 'twitcher'. Many people are, however,
and for those that are obsessive over such pastimes and resident in America

Blakiston's Fish Owl Ketupa blakistoni is the subject of an excellent
feature article in the March 1985 issue of BBC Wildlife Magazine. The
account, written by Dr. Mark Brazil contains valuable facts about this
endangered owl but depressing facts about its status. It is pleasing, how-
ever, to see a scientist advocate the initiation of a captive breeding pro-
gramme using the few captive specimens in one central facility.

Malcolm Ellis writes about the November-December 1984 issue of
Swara, the magazine of the East Africa Wildlife Society, which has the
cover adorned by a beautiful coloured photograph of a Great Blue Tour-
aco. Inside are more photographs, illustrating an article by Mhorag Candy,
about her study of this, the largest of the touracos, until now little-studied
in the wild.
According to the brief biolgraphical notes about the author, a full
account of her study has been published in the Journal of the East Africa
Natural History Society and National Museum and currently Mhorag
Candy is writing up her study of Ross's Touraco.
In the previous issue of Swara, in an article about the traditional head-
dresses worn by Masai and Samburu youths, following their circumcision
ceremony, Daniel Stiles estimated that in the period from 1980 to the
end of the century, 2,400,000 small birds may be killed in Kenya and
used to make these head-dresses.

Dispensed with at the end of the youth's healing period, some three
months or so after the ceremony, each head-dress may be made from the
skins of as many as 40 birds. Species used include the Superb Starling,
kingfishers, orioles, the Rufous-crowned Roller, Black-headed Bush
Shrike, Red and Yellow Barbet and different weavers.
The dead birds of various species, mixed together, seemingly without
any set patterns and all with their wings closed, are laid side-by-side,
around a halo-like wooden frame. Then, as a finishing touch, some Ostrich
feathers, which have been picked up on the plains, may be added to com-

band. In the intervening years the population has risen to approximately
30, but, sad to say, Old Blue is now dead. Aged 14, she was commemora-
ted in the New Zealand Parliament, the first such honour accorded to an
individual bird by any government anywhere.

A perfect example for the argument of keeping species pure and not
culturing for abnormal forms, either by mutation or hybridisation, is high-
lighted perfectly in horticulture. The familiar 'African Violet' Saintpaulia
ionantha, so often propagated as a house plant in many forms, is con-
sidered by some to be extinct in its native Tanzania. This obviously raises
the point of how pure some of the cultured stock is. Horticulture is noto-
rious for its ability to come up with new varieties of almost any plant in a
very short time but are we, as aviculturists, capable of the same thought-
lessness. Birds present more difficulties but we seem to have done a per-
fect demolition job on the Budgerigar's form and colour. A lot is preached
about captive breeding as an aid to conservation and justifiably so,as it is
an indispensable tool but I just wonder how pure species like the Splendid
Parrakeet, and for that matter, other species where breeding of colour mu-
tations is on the increase, will be in 20 years' time in relation to their ori-
ginal wild form and colour. Are Cockatiels and several lovebirds due to
follow the Budgerigar?

VISIT TO CHESTNUT LODGE, COBHAM,
</sectionHeader>

On 1st June 1985, some 70 visiting members and guests enjoyed the
generous hospitality of Miss Ruth Ezra and Mr. Raymond Sawyer at their
beautiful home in Surrey. The weather was warm and sunny and Raymond
escorted us around the aviaries - a continuous scattering of mealworms
gave us closer views of his avian favourites. Although early in the season,
the impressive breeding results at Chestnut Lodge were already enough for
us to appreciate the care and expertise needed for their achievement.
A superb pair of Violaceous Touracos, successfully bred last year for
the first time in Britain, again had two well-grown young. Other species
with young included Kookaburras, Emerald and Amethyst Starlings and
Rothschild's Grackles. Previous successes with waders had been repeated,
and three species - Avocets, Black-winged Stilts and Ringed Plovers - had
young. Hopes were high for Stanley, Crowned and Demoiselle Cranes, all
of which had eggs. An elegant pair of Golden-breasted Ground Doves,
which had successfully bred last season, were incubating.
The number of interesting and unusual species to be seen included
Malayan Black-crested Jays, Bhutan Long-tailed Mynahs, Long-tailed
Sibias and a Timor Sparrow. Keas which had bred last year were nesting
and other psittacines nesting were Dusky and Stella Lories. In the garden
aviaries, Toco Toucans, a Scarlet Cock-of-the-Rock and some delightful
Egyptian Plovers were much admired. On the lake a pair of Pacific Brent
Geese had repeated their annual success with six goslings. Cuban Flamin-
goes, in brilliant colour, made a wonderful contrast for the geese as they
paraded on the lawn bordering the lake.
A really marvellous afternoon ended with tea on the lawn, and the
visitors sat for a long time chatting in the sunshine and watching the full-
winged cranes displaying.
Jeffrey Trollope
On behalf of everyone present, we would like to thank Miss Ezra
and Mr. Sawyer very much for working so hard to give us all such an
enjoyable afternoon. It was also particularly generous of Miss Ezra to
donate the proceeds (#164 including donations) to the Society's funds.
The loyal support and interest of these two Vice-Presidents is very much
appreciated by all members of the Society.

BIRDS OF THE CAYMAN ISLANDS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996023447368421" page_id="56953689"  page_num="179" year="" vol="">
By Patricia Bradley. Published by the author, Cayman Is., 1985.
245 pages. 72 colour photographs. ISBN 0903826 763.
Distributed in U.K. by Law Reports Int., Trinity College, Oxford
Everyone interested in birds, be they aviculturist or ornithologist, will
eventually purchase a field guide to the birds of a certain geographic
region. One soon realises that almost without exception these contain no
photographs, but paintings. One exclusion will be reviewed here, for I was
so impressed with Patricia Bradley's Birds of the Cayman Islands that I
decided to take a pen to hand and give my opinion - something that I
rarely do for a book.
Published by the author this year, the book consists of 245 pages. The
foreword is by HRH the Duke of Edinburgh, with a preface by Dr. Oscar
Owre, MaytagProfessor of Ornithology Emeritus and Professor of Biology
at the University of Miami, Florida. That these two distinguished gentle-
men would permit their names to appear in the book alone elucidates its
extolled nature.
Indubitably the most unique aspect of the book is the photographic
portfolio of all the breeding birds of the islands. Each of the 72 colour
photographs is equally superb; indeed, placing one above the other would
be an almost impossible task. My favourites are of the Bananaquit Coereba
flaveola, which I have watched several times in the Caribbean, and of the
Cayman Island Amazon Amazona leucocephala caymanensis , for which I
travelled there specifically to observe last year.
Most of the photographs were taken by Yves-Jacques Rey-Millet,
though 11 are by the author.
The first 20 pages of actual text describe the islands, conservation, a
list of endemic and nonbreeding birds, etc. This area contains a glossary
and the topography of a bird - a pertinent point for a person unaquainted
with field ornithology.
The aforementioned is followed by 162 pages describing all of the birds
on the Cayman Islands. Particulars are divided into several headings, des-
cribing such details as field characters, status and habitat. This is certainly
the most valuable area.
The remaining pages consist of two appendices and an index.
This IVi x 4% in. hardcover book is not only a must for a visitor intent
on bird-watching in the Cayman Islands but is so outstanding in its con-
tents that it deserves a place on every bookshelf. Certainly it has one on
mine.

Australian dollars, including packing and posting by surface mail to any-
where in the world.
During the past decade several books have been published dealing with
parrots endemic to Australia. The most recent work by Barry Hutchins
and the late Bob Lovell, is undoubtedly the most useful to aviculturists,
although ornithologists will find it equally applicable in the in-depth cover-
age.
The book sets itself apart from predecessors in more than one way. It
deals with 36 species and 22 subspecies of Australian parrots, of which the
authors have kept 33 and nine respectively. Of these, 25 species and seven
subspecies have bred in their aviaries, making them uniquely qualified to
write on their subject. Between them they have observed every psittacine
discussed, save for the Paradise Parrot Psephotus pulcherrimus and a race
of the Northern Rosella Platycercus venustus hilli.
This treatise excludes cockatoos, Fig Parrots, Eclectus and a few other
genera but their absence does not detract even a modicum, for these are
either not common in aviculture or have been the subject of other books.
The space that would need to be devoted to those few species has been
converted to a comprehensive coverage of parrots that are better known
in aviculture (save for certain cockatoos and Eclectus).
This softcover book contains no colour plates; the co-authors wanted
to place pertinent details in the pages that these would consume.Ergo, the
185-page work is full of very valuable details on each of the species in
field and aviary. In addition, particulars on management, housing, aviaries,
feeding and diseases are included.
Some may consider the absence of plates a debit, but I cannot concur
with such an observation. There are numerous books that contain excel-
lent colour photographs or illustrations of the birds - and these books
could be used as a reference by those unfamiliar with the appearance of
Australia's parrots.
Maps are provided for every species and several subspecies.
This book was launched on 17th May 1985 by Graham Shotter, direc-
tor of the Royal Melbourne Zoological Gardens, during the opening cere-
mony of the 3rd National Avicultural Convention, in Melbourne. In the
course of his address, Shotter described the book as '.quite clearly a

shrieked out the knowledge of the authors. Certainly, the last paragraph
in Ron Hasting's foreword bore testimony. He wrote the most fitting
accolade: 'This excellent book will undoubtedly become a standard
reference on the parrots of Australia and I highly recommend it to all
bird-lovers, whether their particular interest be aviculture - or the wider
field of ornithology'.
I thoroughly agree with Hastings.

THE DICTIONARY OF AVICULTURE - Keeping and breeding Birds
By Richard Mark Martin. Published by Batsford, London, 1983
240 pages; 93 line drawings. Price - #7.95. ISBN 0713441569
Richard Mark Martin is an experienced professional aviculturist who
obviously researched a great deal when compiling this book - an alpha-
betically arranged reference work giving details of breeding, rearing, and
general care of birds in captivity - 'pure' aviculture, to quote the author's
own words.
Although many species of birds are included, it is impossible to in-
clude every known species, so for this reason only those known in avi-
culture are documented.
The dictionary commences with Accipitridae and ends with Zygo-
dactyl and most 'terms' used in aviculture are to be found between these
entries. General entries include: management, accommodation, diet,
breeding, disease, etc., and is illustrated with the author's own excellent
line drawings.
Cross referencing is used throughout which I personally found un-
necessary, but those inexperienced in avicultural jargon - the beginner
particularly - will find this useful, and glean much information from its
pages. This book, however, will undoubtedly find a niche on the book-
shelf of both the beginner and the experienced aviculturist alike.

Race of Amazon Parrot new to Aviculture
In 1984 a previously unknown subspecies of a very well-known
Amazon Parrot was introduced to aviculture. The Marajo race of the
Yellow-fronted Amazon was virtually a myth, being known only from
two skins. Its validity was doubted by some.
In August of last year, when I was in Florida, Ramon Noegel
showed me a photograph of two birds supposedly of this race, Amazona
ochrocephala xantholaema. It had been given to him by a Brazilian
aviculturist who had visited him a few days previously and depicted
two captive birds. Never having seen skins or photographs I was in-
trigued and obtained a photograph of the photo.
A couple of weeks later a well-known British aviculturist telephoned
me with the news that he had been offered birds of this race which were
then on the Continent.
The following month I received a letter from a well-known animal
collector in the Netherlands containing absorbing news. He wrote: 'On
my recent expedition to Brazil I found a good number of xantholaema in
the Paru river area. I observed several flocks, some of them containing
about 25 birds, and obtained some of them.
'This is a large bird about the size of a Double Yellow-head. Its wing
measurement is 235 mm and the tail 123 mm. Weight is 530 g. It has the
crown, lores and cheeks yellow and some birds also have yellow extend-
ing to the nape and with red feathers over the yellow areas. The bend of
the wing is blood-red. The bill is larger than in the Yellow-fronted Ama-
zon.
'They have a green band on the forehead, like the blue band of the
Blue-fronted Amazon but smaller - from about Vi cm up to 1 cm (the
wing speculum is red).'
The photograph from the Netherlands depicts the beak as being
larger than that of the Yellow-fronted; the upper mandible is horn-col-
oured and dark grey and the lower mandible is dark grey. The thighs are
green, yellow nearest the foot.
Its appearance is more reminiscent of the Blue-fronted Amazon
aestiva from the photograph. Perhaps this race can be used as evidence
that ochrocephala and aestiva form a superspecies.
Taxonomy aside, the introduction of xantholaema into Europe is a
most interesting event. There are now three birds in the UK so hopefully
this race will be breeding here within the next few years.
Culmhead, Somerset Rosemary Low
P.S. Since writing the above, I have seen xantholaema in two collections and have been
informed that this subspecies was in a private collection in Europe several years
before 1984.

The Lemon-breasted Canary
I read with interest the letter by Eric A. Clewlow on the Lemon-
breasted Canary Serinus citrinipectrus in Vol. 90, No. 3, of the Avicul-
tural Magazine. In Durban Museum Novitates , Vol. 6, Part 4, 1960,
P.A. Clancey and W.J. Lawson state that 'in October, 1959, Mr. C.H.
'Jack' Scheepers, of Bela Vista, Maputo, southern Portuguese East Africa,
trapped about 40 examples of an unknown species of canary of the
genus Serinus Koch during the course of a big-game collecting safari to
Manguyane, near Panda, in the Inhambane district of Sul do Save. Most
of the canaries remained in Mr. Scheeper's aviaries until late August,
1960, when many of them were studied at close quarters by members of
the Durban Museum staff during the course of our recent ornithological
expedition to southern Portuguese East Africa. While the duty of describ-
ing the new species to science has fallen to us, full credit for the initial
discovery of the species must be given to Mr. Scheepers.'

Trichoglossus and Glossopsitta lorikeets wanted
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.958775857142857" page_id="56953693"  page_num="183" year="" vol="">
I intend to do a taxonomic revision of the two lorikeet genera Tri-
choglossus and Glossopsitta. To be able to make the revision I must
have access to living specimens of the birds. I am interested in all the
species and subspecies of the two genera except: T.h. haematodus, T.h.
mitchellii, T.h. forsteni, T.h. capistratus, T.h. moluccanus, T. euteles,
T.omatus and T. (G.) goldiei.
The birds will not be killed or harmed during or after the investiga-
tion. I am a breeder of lories and lorikeets myself so the birds will be
taken good care of. All importations will be handled separately by
commercial quarantines. The revision is supported by the Zoological
Institution of Lund, Sweden, and has a non-commercial status with
possibilities to make importations direct from Australia.
I hope that Avicultural Magazine readers may help me to get the
birds I need.

A general note on rearing exotic pheasant chicks and ducklings
and how their down patterns affect this
The article on this subject by my old friend and colleague, Derek
Goodwin (Vol. 90, 1984, No. 2, p. 112) stimulates a reply.
As a breeder of a wide variety of pheasants and exotic waterfowl over
many years, reared by both natural mothers and by foster-parent Bantam
hens, I should like to quote a few of my own observations and exper-
iences.
The fact that the young of every species of waterfowl and pheasant
has its own patterning could suggest a case for either identification or
camouflage. Identification seems to be stronger by the parents when the
chicks are more grown, for broods mix easily when first hatched but not
when the young are over a week old. Obviously camouflage plays a part
in the first few weeks of life when the chick is weak and vulnerable.
Instinctive behaviour activity on hatching being acceptable to both
parent and young determines the strength of the relationship more than
the patterning, and vocal communication develops and strengthens the
bond as the chick develops. If the chick is of a different colour, it is
accepted if it conforms actively and vocally. For example, pheasant
chicks, as soon as they are strong enough, need to leave the nesting site,
for on dispersal they are less vulnerable to predators, and the pheasant
hen follows and vocally intercommunicates with the chicks to keep the
group loosely together and they can rejoin her for brooding. This is the
time when most chicks are lost from wandering out of hearing range of
the mother, and it is also the time when foster parent broody hens have
problems brooding their foster pheasant chicks, unless they are confined
to a small coop, where the chicks cannot wander far from the broody
hen. After a few days, a bond is formed, or a routine is entered into that
is acceptable to both foster parent and chick. Sometimes foster parents
have a hard time, for on the other hand there are pea-chicks who await
the every move of their foster mother and even will not feed without her
encouragement, regardless of the choice of food. These two extreme
cases emphasise the need for steady, reliable, proven foster hens, and I
find Pekin Bantams are of the all round best. Even the most reliable
little Pekin hen will not accept new alien chicks after the 4th/5th day
from hatching, if they are not identical in shape and colour to her own,
of whatever species.
The young of each species has its own behaviour pattern fixed. Thus
if one species of, say, du ck hatches another's ducklings and their actions
after hatching differ, then confusions arise and this weakens any prelimi-
nary relationship, until after a few days they drift apart and the duck-

lings die without the protection and brooding of the mother duck. Some
ducks lead their broods and other species follow their ducklings and keep
contact by frequent vocal calls. Instinctive behaviour is a survival kit
dictated by the environment in which they live and it cannot be changed.
Abnormally coloured chicks would not suffer to the same extent
except that they may be more visible to predators.
The Muscovy duck mentioned by Derek Goodwin is an example.
Although extremely tolerant, through its long association with man, it
cannot adapt to the set behaviour patterns and voices of the ducklings it
hatches, and although they are first-class incubators, they make very in-
different mothers and resent being moved or confined. I have had them
hatch and, for the first day or two, tolerate pea-chicks, guinea fowl
chicks, Black Swan cygnets, geese, etc., and rear domestic ducks but I
would never risk valuable ducklings with them unless they could be con-
fined and controlled, and they are too casual for me.
I too, as Derek Goodwin mentions, have had a Red Jungle Fowl hen
hatch partridge Silkie chicks, and kill all of them with a peck on the head
because of the bump where the future crest would be, although vocally,
actively and in patterning they would be the same as her own chicks. An
extreme case of intolerance occurred this year.A full-winged pair of
Moluccan Rajah Shelduck hatched 11 ducklings which I thought was
rather a lot for her to brood, for the nights were chilly at the time and
this was her first brood. So I decided to remove six ducklings and give
them to a reliable Pekin hen who had been sitting for two weeks on
dummy eggs. I put them under her in the late afternoon and shut her up
in a coop so that the inside was dark and she could hear but not see the
ducklings, so enacting the hatching process. The following morning,
when opened up for feeding, she had fully accepted her strange brood of
heavily marked ducklings, but what was as important, they had accepted
her. Since they were hatched under their natural mother and paraded
round the enclosure subject to her vocal commands, this goes to prove
that identification between mother and duckling in the first few days
after hatching is not too strong but is much stronger when the bond has
been formed after four or five days of association.
I am glad to report that all 11 were reared safely, both made excellent
parents and the ducklings were grouped together again at three to four
months old.
I do not recommend the mixing of broods although in the early stages
it is possible, but if left too long together, there is the danger of bonds
being formed, sometimes very difficult to break, and subsequent hybridi-
sation. Hybridisation between any species can be attempted if the young
are reared together. I believe in keeping the species pure and maintaining

When I appealed in the Avicultural Magazine (Vol. 90, 1984, No. 1) for
help in obtaining a complete set of Avicultural Magazines, I could not have
foreseen such a magnificent response from one of our greatest supporters.
Dr. Lee Lenz wrote promptly from California, offering to donate a com-
plete set of bound volumes, to be placed in the library held by the Avicul-
tural Society in the Linnean Society's Library at Burlington House, Picca-
dilly, London. The books have now arrived and as soon as a special book-
plate has been stuck in all of them, they will be placed in the Library
where they will be available for reference by all members of the Society
who have Library tickets (#2 per year, available from this office).
I know I can speak on behalf of the President, Council and all members
of the Society in expressing our deep gratitude to Dr. Lenz for such a
valuable gift which will be appreciated and used by many of our members,
both now and in the years to come.
May I renew our plea for Magazines to make up the second set of
Avicultural Magazines held here at Ascot, which is used continually by
the Editor? The missing issues were listed in my original appeal.
If anyone has bound volumes of any year that they wish to dispose of,
either by sale or gift, I would be very glad to hear from them.

THE FOREIGN BIRD FEDERATION (BRITAIN)
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993443153846154" page_id="56953697"  page_num="187" year="" vol="">
The Foreign Bird Federation was formed in 1984 to represent British
national and area societies specialising in the keeping of foreign birds. Its
aim is to involve itself in subjects of mutual concern and interest to keepers
of this group of birds, and in aspects which probably no individual society
could undertake alone, particularly with regard to future legislation.
The response has been very good and nearly all area and national
societies, including the Avicultural Society, are now affiliated to the Fed-
eration. Its Council is elected at an Annual Delegates' Meeting and its
members are chosen to be as broadly based as possible. Two members of
the Avicultural Society's Council are currently serving on the Federation's
Council - Mr. R. Oxley (Chairman) and Mr. David Coles.
In addition to putting aviculture's case to the Ministry of Agriculture
and the Department of the Environment, the Federation is establishing a
central record of birds bred in Britain. The member societies will con-
tribute their members' breeding returns for collation in a main register
which will not only be a very interesting record, but a valuable reference
when talking to the government about measures which might seek to limit
the importing and keeping of foreign birds in this country. The breeding
register is being collated by Mr. D. Bardgett, 216 Skipton Road, Keighley,
West Yorkshire.
As an aid to breeding, an 'Exchange and Mart' scheme has been started
through which breeders can obtain mates for odd birds and this is already
proving very successful. The object of the scheme is to assist private avi-
culturists and owners of public collections in disposing of or obtaining odd
birds to make up potential breeding pairs. It does not apply to British
birds or any of the domesticated foreign species. Further details of the
scheme may be obtained from Mr. B.C. Rawson, 6 Elm Grove, Old Arley,
Coventry CV7 8NT.
The Council of the Foreign Bird Federation believes that the first steps
towards strength through unity have been taken but only time will tell
whether or not the current format is the correct one and, no doubt, indi-
vidual aviculturists will hold different views on the matter. Any thoughts
ideas or even constructive criticism are always welcome and can be put
forward to any Council Member or direct to the Secretary, Mr. C. Stevens,
Monks Cottage, 58 Preston Crowmarsh, Benson, Oxfordshire. Mr. Ste-
vens will also supply copies of the constitution, mandate and general
rules (a stamped, self-addressed envelope would be appreciated).

June 1982. On completion of their quarantine period, the birds arrived in
the Zoo in mid-August, to be housed in an aviary which had been specially
built for them. This aviary measures 50 ft x 20 ft x 10 ft high (15.25 m x
6.10 m x 3.05 m high) , is south facing and gives the birds as much privacy
as possible without actually taking them off show.
Three weeks after receiving the birds in the Zoo, one was sadly lost to
a stoat; steps were then taken to prevent this happening again. Although
nest-boxes were present during the 1983-1984 seasons, only slight interest
was shown in the boxes by our three remaining birds. The aviary was
broken into overnight on the 11th November 1984 and one of the females
was stolen never to be recovered. It was then decided to contact the
supplier again and he sent us two males and one female in exchange for
surplus parrots from Chester. Finally we purchased a female from a dealer
in England to make our stock up to three pairs.
The new birds completed their quarantine period on 4th April 1985,
after which all six birds were housed together in their purpose-built aviary.
No aggression has been observed in keeping these birds in a colony system.
From the day they were all introduced into the aviary there has been a
lot of display in the group, with the females chasing the males around and
appearing to be the dominant sex.
We first noticed that a female was missing in the morning on 29th July
1985, and she remained in the box all that morning. She disappeared again
for the morning on 31st July. During her time out of the nest-box there

P. JAMES - LESSER VASA PARROT
was a lot of activity in the aviary with all six birds. The first mating that
we saw took place on 4th August and, from staff observations, the hen
started sitting properly on 8th August. During the time that she was sitting
we did not go near the nest-box but fed the birds at the other end of the
aviary. When the female came out to feed there was a lot of display, chas-
ing and feeding with the female calling continuously. On 26th August, I
inspected the nest-box and observed two chicks and two unhatched eggs;
the chicks appeared to be about two days old. From laying the first egg
on 29th July, until the chicks were seen was 28 days; from the day when
she started incubating properly, on 8th August, was only 18 days so I am
not sure of the true incubation period, although I think it could be about
24 days.
Of the four nest-boxes the birds were given, they chose a 'grandfather
clock' style of box which measured 8 ft high x 1 ft 2 in deep x 1 ft 2 in
wide (2.44 m x 30.10 m x 30.10 m). This was filled with peat and wood
chippings on a 50/50 ratio to about 4 in (0.11 m) below the entrance hole.
The first chick fledged on 30th September and the second on 1st
October. On fledging, the young parrots resembled the adult birds, except
that they had horn-coloured bills, a very pale grey ring around the eye and
a pale grey tip on the tail feathers. The youngsters were fed exclusively by
the female with the male showing little interest in them at all.
We believe that this is the first breeding of this species in the United
Kingdom.
As described above, the Lesser Vasa Parrot or Black Parrot Coracopsis nigra has
been bred at Chester Zoo and this is believed to be the first success in this country.
Anyone knowing of a previous breeding in Great Britain or Northern Ireland, or of
any other reason that would disqualify this claim, is asked to inform the Hon. Sec-
retary.

Corvus imparatus
IN CAPTIVITY

In late January 1985 we received a letter from Mr. William D. Toone,
Assistant Curator in Ornithology at the San Diego Wild Animal Park
(California), stating that he wished to find a new home for the park's six
"Mexican Crows" Corvus imparatus. Our work on jays (e.g. Hardy, Webber^
and Raitt, 1981) had prompted Dr. Amadeo Rea, Curator of Birds at the
San Diego Natural History Museum, to suggest to Mr. Toone that we might
be interested in keeping these crows in captivity to study their behaviour.
We were indeed interested and had, in fact, been making plans to study
birds of the two populations of so-called Mexican Crows, both in captivity
and in the wild.
These two populations are isolated from each other by at least 300 km.
One, the "Tamaulipas Crow", inhabits the eastern coastal plain of Mexico
from northern Tamaulipas south to Veracruz and San Luis Potosi, while
the other, the "Sinaloa Crow", inhabits the Pacific coastal plain from
southern Sonora south to Nayarit. Anatomically, the two forms are vir-
tually indistinguishable, except for possible statistical differences in the
lengths of their tails (Johnston, 1961), and for this reason have usually
been considered to be a single species. Davis (1958) first recognised the
remarkable difference in the voices of the two forms: that of the Sinaloa
Crow is a gentle falsetto ceow (Fig. le), while that of the Tamaulipas Crow
is a gravelly low-pitched croak (Fig la-d), likened by many people to that
of a frog. Because of this difference in their voices, Davis (ibid.) con-
sidered the two forms to be separate species, the eastern population re-
maining C. imparatus , and tire western population becoming C. sinaloae.
Ornithologists (see for instance A.O.U., 1983) have tended to disagree
with Davis's declaration. An exception is Goodwin (1976) who treats
the two forms, with some hedging, as separate species. Field students
familiar with both forms are likely to be impressed by the difference in
their voices, and enjoying the addition of a species to their life list, to
think of them as distinct species.
Since little is known about the behaviour and breeding of Mexican
Crows, we eagerly accepted Mr. Toone's offer.

History of the Captive Flock
Dr. Rea informed us that US Government officials had confiscated
these six crows and 13 others in 1977 at the US-Mexican border, from
persons attempting to import them and claiming that they were "fruit
crows" or cotingas, hence not protected! There is no record of where
they were caught or how old they were at the time. The authorities
turned them over to Dr. Rea, who kept them in a cage on the roof of
the San Diego Natural History Museum. While they lived there one of the
birds escaped through a small hole in the cage and lingered nearby where
it could often be heard calling. Dr. Rea found that the escapee got at
least part of its food by coming to the cage, where the birds inside passed
food to it through the mesh. He also found that the escaped bird roosted
in the cage at night, coming and going by the hole through which it had
escaped. He recaptured it one night by closing the hole when it was inside
the cage.
In the early 1980's, Dr. Rea gave the birds to the San Diego Wild Ani-
mal Park, where they lived in a small cage out of the public's view. Thir-
teen of the 19 birds died between 1977 and 28th February, 1985, when
the survivors came to us.
Only three were of known sex when they arrived, but two of the others
formed a pair and bred the same spring. Dr. George V. Kollias, of the
University of Florida College of Veterinary Medicine, laparotomised the
sixth and found it to be a female.

We colour-flagged the crows on both tarsi as follows: males - Blue-Blue
(Bl-Bl), Green-Green (G-G), and Orange-Orange (0-0); females - White-
White (W-W), Pumpkin-Pumpkin (P-P), and Yellow-Yellow (Y-Y).
Our aviary was designed by and constructed for the late Dr. Franz
Sauer in the 1960's. It is 12 m long x 5 m wide x 4 m high (3914 ft x 1614
x 1314 ft approx.) and is covered with 14 in mesh hardware cloth. It is divi-
ded roughly in two across its width by a hardware cloth partition with a
gate in it. In three upper corners of the aviary we placed shelters, each
with a roof about 1 m , walls on two sides, and two perches. We placed a
hardware cloth nest platform, 45 cm with a 5 cm-high parapet, in one of
the shelters in the east chamber, where it was about 3.5 m (1114 ft) above
the ground. Each chamber had a water basin with a water drip, and a
metal box about 1 x 1 x 1 m , open on one side, for a food shelter. We
left open the gate between the two chambers until the crows began to nest.
The San Diego Wild Animal Park had kept the birds on a diet of coarse-
ly chopped apples and slightly moistened high-protein dog chow.We gave
them dry dog chow instead, as we had done with our captive Scrub Jays
Aphelocoma coerulescens and they quickly accepted it. The crows often

wasted the apples that had been cut into quarters; they wasted less if we
cut the apples into eighths or smaller pieces. For the first month after
their arrival, we gave them raw peanuts in the shell but these proved to be
of little interest to them, a surprise to us because peanuts were the favourite
food of our captive Scrub Jays. We found that the crows preferred grapes
and oranges to apples.
Our captive Scrub Jays would feed only live food to their nestlings, so
we expected that the crows would do likewise. We hoped to keep the
parent crows from eating most of the expensive live food we provided by
giving them an abundance of their other favourite foods while they were
feeding young. Therefore, about midway through incubation, we began
daily to provide red and white grapes and quartered oranges. In the last
week before hatching we began to give the breeders live mealworms (larvae
of Tenebrio beetles) and crickets. We gave the mealworms paper towels
soaked in a multi-vitamin and mineral solution as a source of moisture. We
offered waxworms to the crows but they would not eat them or feed them
to the young.
Throughout the nestling period and for about two weeks after the
young left the nest, we continued to provide live food twice a day, as well
as oranges, apples and grapes once a day. We then began to reduce grad-
ually the amount of live food and to substitute for it canned dog food as
a source of protein for the young. At about four weeks after fledging, all
the birds' diets consisted largely of apples and dog chow, with the occasional
addition of watermelon or other fruit.

As soon as they arrived in Gainesville, the birds showed by their deep
froggy voices that they are Tamaulipas Crows. The adults produce at least
four major variations on their basic call. One of them (Fig. la) is apparently
the same as the call that Sutton (1951) phoneticised as " gar-lic ". Fig. lb
shows a call that is essentially the first part, or " gar ", of the " gar-lic "
These two are by far the commonest calls given by the adults. Fig. 1c
shows a call that can be phoneticised as "forwoo", and Id shows a quiet,
muttering call that is probably impossible to render in words. The crows
tend to give the two former calls when they mob us; the latter two when
they are calmer or undisturbed. We have twice heard a crow give a rattling
call, similar to the rattle given by so many other corvids (Goodwin, 1976),
but we have not been able to record it.
When a relatively calm Tamaulipas Crow gives any of the calls shown in
Fig. la-d, it extends its head forward, fluffs the feathers of its throat, and
lifts the tips of its wings about 10 cm off its back. All of this is done simul-
taneously just as the crow utters the call; its posture returns to normal at

the end of the call.
Breeding
We first saw signs of what we thought might be pair formation on 9th
March, when we noticed that 0-0 and W-W spent much time perched to-
gether in the west chamber, while the other crows stayed in the east
chamber. On 10thMarch, we first saw either 0-0 or W-W feed and preen the
other.
We were not certain that this behaviour meant that these two were
forming a pair; as early as 2nd March we also noticed G-G persistently
following Y-Y around the aviary, preening it and feeding it, yet both were
male!
Preening in these two "pairs" usually started when one crow approached
another with its foreparts lowered, its bill pointed down, and the feathers
of its nape fluffed. The crow that it approached either retreated, ignored
it, or preened it. The crows usually preened others around the eye, the
base of the bill, and on the nape. We occasionally saw mutual allopreening
between 0-0 and W-W. When a crow retreated from another that approached
it in the head-down posture, the approaching bird often followed or pur-
sued it. Since the crows that invited preening often,in effect, supplanted
the preeners, it is hard to consider the preeners to have been "dominant".
Nest-building
On 9th March we placed an armful of sticks, each about 5-10 mm in
diameter and about 30 cm long, in the east chamber, because we expected
that any breeding pair would build on the platform we provided there.
Instead, on 13th March we found several of these sticks laid on the perch
and even stuck into the mesh in the shelter in the west chamber. Appar-
ently 0-0 and W-W were attempting to nest in that compartment, and to
isolate themselves at least partially from the other crows. Therefore, on
14th March we put a nest platform, identical to the one in the east cham-
ber, in the shelter where 0-0 and W-W had placed the sticks. By the 15th
they had already piled many sticks on this new platform. Early on 16th
March we provided more nest material, including fibres from the leaves
of the Cabbage Palm Sabal palmetto. We thought that the crows would
use the fibres in the final formation of the nest lining, as Florida Scrub
Jays A. a coemlescens use the fibres of Scrub Cabbage Palm Sabal etonia.
On the 17th we noted that the crows had woven the palm fibres into the
foundation rather than reserving them for the cup. On 20th March we saw
0-0 adding material and forming the cup-shaped lining with typical corvid
shaping movements (Goodwin, 1976).
0-0 and W-W stayed in the west chamber most of the time after they

started their nest, and the other crows stayed in the east chamber. Several
times on 20th March 0-0 flew into the east chamber, where W-W followed
it immediately. Once when they did so, they both landed on a ledge where
they performed a mutual display in which they extended their necks,
pointed their bills down, and drooped their wings with their wrists held
out from their bodies. In this posture they walked slowly, about 15 cm
apart, sometimes in the same general direction, sometimes just milling
about near one another. This display is similar to those performed by
several other species of Corvus, as summarised by Goodwin (1976). As
they performed this display one of the other crows tried to approach
them to within less than 30 cm; one of the displaying crows made it back
away by jabbing at it with its open bill.
The nest seemed to be complete by 21st March, the last day we saw a
bird (0-0) add material. The foundation, of sticks and palm fibres, was
about 16 cm high and about 45 cm in diameter. The inner cup, of palm
fibres and a few leaves, was about 7 cm deep and about 20 cm in diameter.
We then closed the gate in the partition between the two chambers,
separating the breeders from the other crows. We realised that these crows
might be co-operative breeders (i.e. that in nature other flock members
might be allowed to feed the young), yet we were also wary that in con-
finement, otherwise normally attentive helpers might disrupt a pair's
breeding and possibly even prey on eggs or nestlings. Dr. Scott Winter-
stein, who has seen Sinaloa Crows nesting in the wild, told us that they
appeared to be loosely colonial but not co-operative breeders. Therefore,
we decided to give the nest builders maximum privacy and security, in the
hope that we could see them carry out the first successful nesting of this
species in captivity.
Egg-laying
Our assistant, Lisa Reinert, found the first egg on 3rd April. Previously
W-W had flown from the nest whenever Ms Re inert entered the aviary, but
this day W-W remained perched on the rim of the nest until she climbed up
to it. Both parents were unusually tame and devoured newborn mice while
she stood in the enclosure.
On the morning of 4th April there was a second egg in the nest. The
next day was dark and rainy and the nest was not checked. By late after-
noon on 6th April the nest contained four eggs. Thus, it appears that the
female laid one egg per day, beginning on 3rd April and ending on 6th
April, though possibly beginning on 2nd April and ending on 5th April.
Incubation and Hatching
Although it was difficult to watch the birds, we think that the female,

W W, performed all of the incubation. On 20th April there were still four
eggs in the nest. On the morning of 22nd April there were only three, with
no trace of the fourth. Late on the afternoon of 22nd April, we found two
hatchlings and an egg in the nest. On 25th April the third egg had still not
hatched, so we removed it and prepared it as a specimen for the Florida
State Museum. It proved to have been infertile. The salvaged egg's shell
(UF 13132) is pale blue, delicately streaked lengthwise with pale olive
buff. It measures 23.9 mm x 32.7 mm. We found no remains of the other
egg shells.
The Nestlings
At hatching the young were completely naked and had greyish green
skin. We handled and photographed them for the first time on 28th April.
Their eyes at this time were barely open and they were still completely
without feathers; even the feather tracts were difficult to see. By slightly
over one week of age, the nestlings were fully twice their size at hatching.
On 3rd May their feather tracts were clearly visible, but the quills were
merely bumps on the skin. By 6th May the birds were in full quill. On
9th May the young were fully feathered on the dorsal tract, but otherwise
the sheaths had not broken. By 13 th May almost all of their feathers had
emerged from their sheaths and their eyes were fully open. Their plumage
was dull black, their irides dark, and their bills and legs dark dull grey. On
14th May one nestling perched on the rim of the nest. Each day from then
until fledging the young spent more time perched on the rim. On 17th
May we banded the two young P-G and G-P.

On 20th May, when we removed a nestling to be examined and photo-
graphed, the other jumped from the nest and fluttered to the ground. We
put it back in the nest where it settled down. On the morning of 24th May
we found one of the young, G-P, on the edge of the nest and the other,
P-G, just a few centimetres away from the nest. Later the same day we
found P-G perched on a limb 1 m (3 l A ft) below the nest. When ap-
proached, the bird flew up to the mesh of the aviary, then hopped back
onto the nest.
On 26th May we found both young out of the nest; both could flutter
about and even fly upward for a few metres. Yet most of the time they
remained in or near the nest.
On 27th May we found both on a perch 4 m (1314 ft) from the nest.
They had left the nest permanently. At fledging, both young had half-
grown tails. By mid-June their tails were full length, and at a distance the
young were hard to tell from the adults.

After the young left the nest, they called when they begged for food
from their parents and when they joined the adults in mobbing people
who came near the aviary. The calls they used in these two situations
sound, and appear in sonograms, remarkably like calls that we have heard
in spring and summer from wild adult-sized Fish Crows Corvus ossifragus
that may, however, have been young-of-the-year. We recorded the call in
Fig. lg from one of a group of wild Fish Crows that alighted on the aviary
to look at and call to the Tamaulipas Crows.
By 10th June, though still begging from their parents, both young fed
themselves most of the time. By 18th June the juveniles still occasionally
begged for food but they seemed strong, full grown, and able to take care
of themselves.
We then opened the door between the two chambers. At first the birds
acted as though they were unaware that the door was open. By 23rd June
the breeders and their young began to make brief forays through the gate,
but the parent birds still seemed to exclude the other adults from the west
chamber. By late July all of the birds travelled throughout the aviary. At
the time of writing (early November) the young birds' voices are still
distinctively different from those of the adults.

Introduction
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.969228866666667" page_id="56953717"  page_num="199" year="" vol="">
Native to open woodland regions of south-eastern Brazil, Uruguay, and
eastern Argentina, the Yellow (or Green) Cardinal is a species of New
World seedeater which is uncommonly kept in U.S. zoos. Of the seven
existing South American cardinal species, previously only the Red-crested
Cardinal Paroaria coronata and the Red-capped Cardinal P. gularis have
been commonly kept in captivity for avicultural purposes.
Description
The male's pronounced black crest, crown and throat, lemon-yellow
eyebrow and moustache streaks, and its olive-green back and olive-yellow
breast and flanks make it one of the most distinctive and unusual birds of
the Cardinal group. The female is similarly marked but duller, with white
replacing the yellow moustache and eyebrow.
Housing
One adult wild-caught pair of Yellow Cardinals has been housed at the
National Aquarium in Baltimore in a 5,500 cubic metre Neotropical
Aviary exhibit since January 1983. Opened in 1981, the glass-covered
exhibit is a pyramid, with a base measuring 25 x 25 x 35 m (82 x 82 x
114% ft) and 21 m (68% ft) high at the peak. The exhibit has been
planted to represent a naturalistic stratification of Neotropical ecological
zones (emergent, canopy, understory, ground, field and marsh) The 4m
(13 ft) high 'gunnite' walls, covered with vines and epiphytes, surround
the large central planted area, providing cliffs and outcroppings for
additional habitat availability. Several pools, waterfalls and a 12 m (39% ft)
stream are also present.
Inhabitants of this exhibit include over 35 species of Neotropical wad-
ers, waterfowl, psittacines, softbills and seedeaters, three species of turtles,
four species of iguanid lizards, tropical freshwater fish and a pair of Two-
toed Sloths. Nearly all species are free-ranging throughout the exhibit. In
general, all species co-exist well, although some minor territorial disputes
do occur during the nesting season.

S.H. AMOS - YELLOW CARDINAL
Climate varies slightly with the seasons, but generally a 24-28*C tem-
perature range is maintained. Relative humidity runs between 60 and 70%.
Photoperiod is difficult to control, due to late night openings throughout
the year. Twelve to 14 hours of light are received on these weekend days,
while a normal mid-Atlantic photoperiod is maintained on the remaining
days.
Diet
Food pans are distributed to all animals in the exhibit twice daily at six
feeding stations. The Yellow Cardinals feed most readily from a seed dish
comprising canary, millet and sunflower seeds, dried peas and corn, but
also feed from pans intended for softbilled birds containing ground fruit,
egg, meat with a dry crumble base, plus multivitamins. They also feed
from the live insect drop (crickets, mealworms and waxworms) which is
performed at 0730 hours daily.
Reproduction
Limited information exists regarding this species, but, like other New
World members of the family Fringillidae, Yellow Cardinals have appeared
to be fairly opportunistic in their breeding habits, providing proper envir-
onmental requirements have been met.
The pair of Yellow Cardinals was introduced to the exhibit in January
1983. The first signs of nesting activity were in April of that year. Half-
hearted attempts were made to construct a nest using tree fern bark, Ficus
sp. leaves and stripped palm fronds, but the birds quickly abandoned the
nest. In the following months the male continued to court the female
actively and in July a second attempt at nest construction was made,
again to no avail.
In May 1984, a nest was found in a Cecropia sp. tree, 3 m (9% ft) above
the ground, similar in materials used to those nests built the previous year.
Three eggs were present. The eggs were a pale greenish-blue, heavily
mottled with brown at the larger end, and less so at the small end. The
nest was extremely flimsy, and had to be artificially supported with wire.
Two chicks hatched on 14th May 1984, the third egg proving infertile.
The parents were fierce defenders, chasing away birds several times their
size which came within several meters of the nest area. By 14 days, the
chicks had become extremely active, exercising growing wings and perch-
ing at times on the edge of the nest. Becoming an easier target for other
potentially predaceous species and because the nest at this point consis-
ted primarily of only support wire, the chicks were removed to off-show
quarters.
The chicks weighed 23 and 28 gms, and were fed a combination of live
insects and a formula nestling food. By 28 days the chicks were flying

strongly, and by 35 days were eating the adult diet on their own.
After the chicks were removed, the parents soon began constructing a
new nest 6.5 m (21% ft) up in a stand of thorny bamboo. Again, primarily
tree fern bark and leaves were used, but the branching stalks of the bam-
boo growing into the exhibit perimeter wire allowed the nest greater stabil-
ity. Due to the location of the nest and the protection it received from the
thorny bamboo, nest checks were not made. Both female and male were
readily observed incubating until 28th June 1984 when both were seen
carrying live insects to the nest. Using a mirror attached to a long pole and
binoculars, it was determined that two chicks were present. At 10 days
both chicks were found at the base of the bamboo, one in shock, the
second scared but unharmed. The first expired within several hours, but
the other was reared with no mishaps using similar techniques as with the
first clutch.
In 1985 the parents built again in the bamboo, but even higher. Two
chicks from two clutches hatched on 12th June and 9th July, 1985, were
reared. This brings the number of chicks reared to five in the 1984 and
1985 seasons - two males and three females.
Conservation
In Uruguay the Yellow Cardinal is considered to be in the Appendix III
category, according to the Convention on the International Trade of En-
dangered Species (C.I.T.E.S.). This makes importation of future specimens
of this species unlikely.
As no Yellow Cardinals have been reared in U.S. zoological collections
between 1980 and our successes in 1984-1985 (according to the Inter-
national Species Inventory System, or I.S.I.S.), the National Aquarium in
Baltimore is initiating a co-operative breeding programme with other insti-
tutions, including the Vancouver Aquarium, Philadelphia Zoo and the
Burnet Park Zoo, which currently maintain individuals of this species. It is
hoped that with the introduction of additional blood lines and our contin-
ued breeding successes, this bird's future in captivity can be assured.

SOME RARE INSECTIVOROUS SOFTBILLS BRED IN 1984

(Bonn, W. Germany)
The genus Prinia comprises 13 species which live in the tropical and
subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. They are generally grouped in the
subfamily Sylvinae but recent examinations by Sibley have persuaded
Wolters (1983) to assign the genus Prinia to a new family, the Cisticolidae.
The two subspecies of the Bar-winged Prinia Prinia familiaris live on the
islands of Sumatra, Java and Bali, where they are common birds on cultiva-
ted land, living in dense, low vegetation in the damper areas. The West
Java birds breed during all months of the year while the Bar-winged Prinias
of East Java only breed from January to May at the start of the rainy
season. Outside the breeding season they rove about in small groups in
search of insects.
The Bar-winged Prinia is the size of a small warbler with a long, greyish
tail ending in a broad, white-bordered band. The body is mainly grey
above with some bright white spots on the wings and white on the under-
parts. In the breeding season the male has a small grey band across the
breast. The eyes are brown, the bill is black (more horn-coloured in young
birds).
The pair in my collection were put into an aviary measuring 2.00 x 3.5
x 2.5 m high ( 6 V 2 x 1IV 2 x 814 ft) containing some large plants in tubs. In
the thick shrubs the birds soon built a globular nest out of fine fibres and
two pale green eggs, flecked with brown, were laid. Only the female sat on
the eggs. After a fortnight the nest was empty and only the eggshells were
to be found on the ground of the aviary. Some days later, a further three
eggs were laid. After an incubation period of 12-13 days, the chicks
hatched but were put out of the nest within hours. A month later a new
nest was built in a dead broom bush but once again the hatched chicks
were put out of the nest - we could see the female carrying the chicks
in her beak and beating them on a branch, like worms. However, the next
breeding attempts were successful. The birds now accepted all different
living insects such as small mealworms, crickets, 'ant eggs', and preferred
the maggots of the wax-moth and spiders. Both Prinias fed their chicks
well and after 13 days, two small, short-tailed Bar-winged Prinias left their
nest and were soon independent from their parents. The pair made two
more successful breedings producing two young birds from each.
The Bar-winged Prinia showed a very interesting display though their
song was unremarkable. I am sure that in the breeding season they should
not be kept with more than one pair of the same species because my birds

were very aggressive towards their own or closely-related species.
The family Cisticolidae also contains the genus Orthotomus, whose
members are found extensively through South-east Asia and its islands.
The eight species prefer moist, tropical lowlands where they live hidden in
the undergrowth.
Two species came to my aviary: the Common or Long-tailed Tailorbird
Orthotomus sutorius and the Ashy Tailorbird O. ruficeps. Like the Prinia,
the Tailorbirds also belong to the well-known biologist, Dr. K.L. Schuch-
mann(Bonn) who placed these birds with me to attempt first breedings.
Because the two species of Tailorbirds fought, they had to be kept in
separate aviaries. The Common Tailorbird is one of the best-known birds
in his own country although only a few people have seen him in the wild.
The nine subspecies are spread from the North-west Himalayas and South-
west China to Malaysia and Java. Different from the normal description,
my male Long-tailed Tailorbird is not olive on the back but only grey
and is also rufous on the cheek (like the male Ashy Tailorbird). During
the breeding season he has two elongated tail feathers. The underparts
are white. The female lacks the long tail feathers and is more grey-olive
above.
Soon this pair sewed a loop out of fibres on the underside of a broad
leaf of a Hymenocallis plant, which was to be used as the basis for a
further nest-cup. Two pale green eggs with large brownish spots (17 x
12 mm) were laid but unfortunately the female died so there was no
result.
The six subspecies of the Ashy Tailorbird live in the bush and wood-
lands of western Burma and southern Thailand, southward to the Sunda
Islands. The male bird looks similar to the Common Tailorbird but lacks
the elongated tail feathers and is ashy-grey on the breast. The female
is also similar but is only grey above.
The male Ashy Tailorbird sewed several nesting pouches out of the
large leaves of Hibiscus rosa-sinensis , or Piperaceae plants, and these
were made into finished nests but unfortunately the leaves dried up very
soon so that they had to be tied up with a wire.
Later they built a nest in a closed nesting basked from fibres as are
usually used by estrildid finches. They laid two white, brown-flecked
eggs which were incubated by the female only. After 13 days one bird
hatched but was abandoned after five days. In a new attempt, two chicks
hatched and were brought up by the adults who preferred to feed small
spiders and maggots of wax-moths. At 14 days one young Tailorbird left
the nest. It looked like the female without the long tail feathers and the
rufous colour on the head. While the male provided for this chick, the
female started a new clutch from which one young bird was reared also.

The last insectivorous bird that I bred in 1984 was the Red-faced
Crombec Sylvietta whytii which lives in eastern Africa from southern
Ethiopia southward to Rhodesia and Mozambique. All the members of
this genus are very short-tailed and have a slightly curved bill. Like the
titmice, they hop through the bushes hunting small insects. They build
a deep, bag-like cup nest at the end of a thin twig. In my aviary they
always have great difficulty in building such a nest and although I tried
to give very different nesting materials, they needed a long time to com-
plete the nest and sometimes it was bound to fall to bits before the
breeding season was over. Both sexes sat on the whitish, reddish-brown
freckled eggs and after 13-14 days one chick hatched. The parents fed
the little Crombec very well but after ten days the male was mating
again and I had to take him out of the aviary. Four days later the chick
left the nest and continued to be fed by the female for a further three
weeks until I separated it. At once the young bird fed itself but did avoid
coming down to the floor of the cage. At four months old it changed to
adult plumage with silvery grey above and extensive rufous on the under-
parts.
These successful breedings are a great encouragement to me as I now
hope to breed other rare insectivorous birds in the future, such as the
Paradise Flycatcher and Wattle-eyes.

ELECTRIFIED FENCING FOR AVIARIES
AND ENCLOSURES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997905027027027" page_id="56953726"  page_num="208" year="" vol="">
By R.G. and D.M. NASH
Electrified wires and fences are frequently used to prevent domestic
livestock from entering areas of crops or valuable land, and also around
enclosures to prevent predators. In recent years wildfowl breeders have
developed a system of electrified wires around their enclosures and pens
as added protection against intruders. These systems can easily be adapted
for use with aviaries where predation, or worrying by potential predators,
is a problem.
The equipment for running an electric wire or fence is available from
farm suppliers or direct from manufacturers, as listed at the end. It con-
sists of an energy supply, either mains or battery, an energiser which
transmits pulses of current at high volts, but at low amps so that it is not
dangerous to humans, galvanised wire and various insulators and fixings
to suit a variety of situations. The energiser costs approximately #60-#80
and the smallest size is capable of electrifying three miles of wire. They
do seem very reliable and if one calculates the loss of a few rare or expen-
sive birds, it is perhaps worth the investment.
To set up a system of electric wires or fence is quite straightforward
as long as one bears in mind the basic principle behind it. The intruder
has to touch the live wire and be earthed in order to get a shock. There-
fore a sparrow perching on the live wire is unaffected, but the cat that
touches the galvanised mesh of the fence and the live wire is perfectly
earthed and gets a shock. The predators of wildfowl and aviary birds
are many and varied and this has to be borne in mind when designing the
system. An electric fence obviously offers no protection against preda-
tory birds. When dealing with foxes, dogs and cats, the enclosure fence
of an open pen must be high enough to prevent them clearing it without
touching it. A 6 ft (1.83 m) fence with a short 45* overhang at the top
has proved effective in London suburbs when an electric wire has been
placed along the top of the overhang (see diagram). Some waterfowl
breeders prefer to have a higher fence, say 8 ft (2.44 m), with an electric
wire running round around it at the 6 ft mark, so that predators get a
shock whilst clambering up and consequently fall back. If the fencing
material itself is not a good conductor of electricity, for example plastic-
coated fencing, wooden panels, etc., then the addition of galvanised
earthing wires running alongside, but not touching, the live wire is
necessary to make sure the intruder is still earthed, even if its feet are not

on the ground.
Rats and foxes are good diggers and it is wise to dig the fence in at
least 1 ft (0.31 m) below ground level unless the aviary has a concrete
base. Even more effective is to bury the fence 1 ft down and then turn it
1 ft out as well. If digging-in presents a problem, it is sometimes possible
to lay Vi in (0.012m) mesh 18 in (0.46 m) out along the ground, pegging it
firmly every six inches (0.152 m). It is fairly obvious from observing rats
and foxes, that they will try to climb into the enclosures before they
expend great energy digging. When dealing with rats, mink, stoats, etc.,
Vi in mesh is necessary from the ground up to the point of the electric
wire so that they cannot squeeze through the mesh and hence avoid the
electric wire. This also prevents your own birds from putting their heads
through the mesh and touching the electric wire themselves. We have
found that to run an electric wire at about 9-12 in (0.23--0.305 m) off the
ground close to the fence is ideal. If the Vi in mesh is turned out 3--4 in
(0.076 - 0.10 m) over the electric wire (see diagram), it means that the rat
has to touch the electric wire while trying to negotiate the turn-out. Above
the electric wire the fence mesh can be larger, depending on your own bird
size, of course, which is usually cheaper and more pleasing on the eye.
Assuming your fencing is fixed to the outside of the posts, there should
be no easy way in for climbing rodents.
From our personal experience with an enclosure for ducks and geese,
we have found that the bottom electric wire also deters cats, dogs and
foxes because they tend to be inquisitive and often touch the live wire
with their nose or paws and a small shock is enough to send them running.
In a roofed-in aviary the problem is often that these animals scare the
birds rather than actually getting into the aviary and this, of course,
can lead to birds damaging themselves or dying of shock. In such cases,
a little ingenuity must be used to place the electric wires in such a way as
to stop them. A single or double strand could be mounted around the roof
of the aviary on short posts to deter animals clambering on the roof. The
system is very adaptable as the electric wire runs out from the energiser
and does not have to return to it. It can also branch off from the main
wire or you can run two parallel electric wires from the energiser. It is
worth noting, however, that if the electric wire is touched by wet foliage
or grass, there will be a leakage to earth, which will reduce the power
going along the wire. Some models have a warning mechanism (visible or
audible) when the wire is being earthed and it is a good idea to place the
energiser where you can frequently check it, i.e. your bird-shed, garage,
porch, etc.
Although the initial outlay of such a system is quite high, maybe #120,
we feel we owe it to the birds in our care to give them the best protection

possible. An electric wire system does not negate the need for secure
fencing, but it does act as an effective back-up.

BIRDS IN MOSCOW ZOO AND OTHER SOVIET ZOOS
By JEFFERY BOSWALL
(Bristol)
On 5th November 1985 I spent a few hours at Moscow Zoo and was
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.9724655" page_id="56953729"  page_num="211" year="" vol="">
shown round by the Director, Vladimir V. Spitsin, and the Scientific
Secretary, Natalia I. Istratova. The Zoo was created as long ago as 1864
when it was only the twentieth such establishment anywhere in the world.
Today it occupies 17 hectares.
In the short time I was there it was not possible to gain a comprehensive
view of the Zoo's feathered population but such facts as were obtained
may be set down.
I asked particularly about cranes and was shown, to my delight, nine
species. It was gratifying to set eyes on a Siberian Crane Gras leucogeranus,
albeit a bird with a deformed beak. There were seven Red-crowned Cranes
G. japonensis (three pairs, plus one) and five White-naped Cranes G. vipio
These last included a breeding pair - one bird from nature brought in as a
casualty and one bird imported from Baraboo, Wisconsin - and a
younger, non-breeding pair. One Sandhill Crane G. canadensis pratensis,
two Common Cranes G. grus and half a dozen Demoiselles Anthropoides
virgo completed the Palearctic cranes, to which have to be added two
Afro-tropical species: the South African Crowned Crane Balearica regu-
lomm (three birds) and the Sudan Crowned Crane B. pavonina cecilae
(two birds), and an Oriental species, the Sarus Crane Grus antigone (two
birds).

It was also a pleasure to see four White Storks of the black-billed east-
ern form Ciconia ciconia boyciana. There was one pair and two 'spare'
males.
I was taken to the incubator room, a very clean, neat and tidy place.
There, in 1985, 603 eggs of 71 species had been hatched including those of
waterfowl, pheasants and birds of prey. To give just one example at ran-
dom: two eggs of the Tawny Eagle Aquila rapax orientalis were success-
fully hatched. Two years earlier nine eggs of Ross's Gull Rhodostethia
rosea, taken from nests in the wild (presumably in north-eastern Siberia)
had been incubated. Of the nine, only seven hatched out, and of these
seven young ones, five died of aspergillosis within a year. A further bird
died at two years and three months old, but one surviving Ross's Gull
was there to be admired.
Of course, many birds are allowed to keep and to hatch out their
own eggs in the Zoo grounds, particularly species of waterfowl. One of
the problems these birds face is the depredations of their eggs and young
ones by Hooded Crows Corvus corone comix. Not only are these crows a
nuisance to other birds in this way, they also steal food. The crows even
empty the litter bins in their search for titbits. In consequence, between
three and four thousand crows are trapped and killed every year by the
Zoo authorities and their bodies are fed to appropriate Zoo residents.
Feral pigeons Columba livia and House Sparrows Passer domesticus are
also fellow-travellers, but apparently no action is taken against them.
Among the larger birds of prey the pair of Steller's Sea Eagles Haliae-
etus pelagicus was particularly impressive. The couple were housed along-
side five Golden Eagles Aquila chrysaetos, a breeding pair of Lammer-
geyers Gypaetus barbatus , a breeding pair of Himalayan Griffons Gyps
himalayensis, and two Bald Eagles Haliaeetus leucocephalus.
I was told that the Zoo's total bird population was over 2,000 indi-
viduals, of over 300 species, and was handed a booklet giving the results
of an earlier census taken on 1st January 1983. An analysis of this list
gives 2,058 individuals of 289 races of 268 species (Anon. 1984). Else-
where (Spitsin, 1984) the figures given are 1,672 individuals of 312
species.
On the day of my visit, darkness had fallen before I could see all the
birds of prey so I turned at once to the pages of the booklet that would
tell me what I might have missed. Among the larger species, the Zoo
held (on that date, at least) seven White-tailed Eagles Haliaeetus albieilla,
a pair of Old World Black Vultures Aegypius monachus and six Imperial
Eagles Aquila heliaca.
By turning to another book (Spitsin, 1984) the Soviet equivalent of
the International Zoo Yearbook, it was possible to determine the num-

bers and distribution of rare birds among 37 Soviet zoos. Apparently
all these establishments had also undertaken censuses on 1st January 1983.
By a coincidence, the number of species listed as 'rare' is also 37. Five of
the species are cranes. No less than 13 Siberian Cranes, nine males and
four females, are listed for the Oka State Nature Reserve. Only Moscow
Zoo held Eastern White Storks (two males and two females on that date),
but 14 zoos held 28 Black Storks Ciconia nigra. Other rare species include
two pelicans, a flamingo, eight Anatiform birds, five pheasants, two
parrots and a dozen Falconiform birds. To give now some example num-
ners of rare raptors: on 1st January 1983, 90 Tawny Eagles were held in
27 zoos, 46 Imperial Eagles in 23 zoos, 44 Golden Eagles in 21 zoos, 41
White-tailed Eagles in 16 zoos, 18 Lammergeyers in 10 zoos, five Steller's
Sea Eagles in three zoos, three Short-toed Eagles Circaetus gallicus in two
zoos, three Bald Eagles in two zoos and three Pallas's Sea Eagles Haliaeetus
leucoryphus in two zoos.
It is clear from another section of the book that of these rare raptors
only three species were bred in captivity in Soviet zoos in 1982: the White-
tailed Eagle (one zoo), the Lammergeyer (two zoos) and the Tawny Eagle
(one zoo).
In conclusion it is worth mentioning that 79 bird species are listed in
the second (1984) edition of the Red Data Book of the USSR (Borodin,
1984).

THE FEEDING AND BREEDING OF THREE SOUTHERN
AFRICAN SERINS IN CAPTIVITY AND IN THE WILD

After first reading C.J. Skead's book in 1960, The Canaries,
Seedeaters and Buntings of Southern Africa , I decided that in the years
to follow I would try to fill some of the gaps listed as 4 No Data' in his
work. Milewski (1978) also seemed to have had a similar idea as his efforts
and patience have paid off with his survey on the feeding habits of serins
in the south-western Cape Province, South Africa.
As seeds play the major part in the eating habits of the so-called can-
aries, it is important that the correct mixtures are available in the aviary at
all times. Pre-packed seed usually contains four parts yellow manna, one
part red manna, two parts canary and one part white millet. The more ex-
perienced aviculturists tend to make up their own mixtures. This must be
supplemented with soft, green achenes which are the small seeds of Com-
posite flowers, such as Senecio and Ursinia. The so-called seedeaters,
in fact, eat much less seed than might be supposed and feed on wild berries
and fruit as it comes into season. As a substitute, grated apple, sliced
orange, half-peeled grape, pear, guava, banana and fig can be given. Fresh
washed greenfood should be supplied regularly as it provides the vitamins
and minerals needed to complete a good staple diet, and limited quantities
should be given at a time, with the stale greens being removed daily. The
dark greens such as watercress, spinach, carrot tops, thistle and chick-
weed have a high vitamin content. It is not easy to provide a regular
varied supply from the local pet store. The termite has had to become the
major feeding item in many parts of Africa. Winged termites can be caught
as they emerge from the ground just before a rain storm is due. These can
be stored in a container in the refrigerator for many months. Mound ter-
mites are the most popular and these great earth castles are broken up and
kept in potato sacks which will give a supply of ants for at least a month.
All the serins swallow small coarse sand known as grit to assist in the diges-
tion of seeds which is evident in the faeces. In the aviary, crushed oyster
shell or cuttlefish 'bone' will act as a valuable adjunct to grit. Water has
been left until last but it is no less important to food. Newly-acquired
birds will prefer rain water to that from a reservoir but will soon accept
the latter in a few days.
The White-throated Canary Serinus albogularis is also known as the
White-throated Seedeater. In the wild it has been observed feeding at the

seedheads of aloes, buds of euphorbias and achenes of Composite flowers.
Milewski (1978) recorded that small seeds were also important in their
diet, in addition to the larger seed types and a wide range of soft plant
parts as well as taking kernels and large seed.
Percentage figures of food genera revealed: 11% Polycarena, 6%
Zygophyllum, Erodium, Acacia, Olea, 4% KLeinia, Othonna, Euryops,
Chrysanthemoides, 2% Emex, Microloma, Relhania, Sonchus, Protea
(possibly partly insects), Stoebe, Eriocephalus, 13% Salsola, 8% Raphanus,
10% Chenopodium ; additionally the succulent leaf-pulp from Asteraccae
and Mesembryanthemaceae. In the aviary, they have been recorded feeding
on the unripe seedheads of the Blackjack Bideris pilosa and wild Sunflower
Helianthus annuus and ripe seeds of Pepperweed Lepidium africanum,
Klein Geelbossie Senecio polyanthemoides, Smeltersbossie Flaveria biden-
tis and Khaki Weed Alternanthera pungens. Ripe and green seeds of
Guinea Grass Panicum maximum. Blue Panic Panicum laevigatum, Garden
Setaria Setaria pallide fusca , Hay Chloris virgata, Natal Redtop Rhynchely-
trum repens, Thatchgrass Hyparrhenia hirta. Giant Paspalum Paspalum
urvillei, Ostrich Grass Erigeron canadensis and Broad-leaved Panic Panicum
deustrum. Petals are eaten from Dwarf Marigold Schkuhria pinnata, Red
Salvia Salvia africana and the fruit of Oestrum Cestrum laevigatum (Black
Inkberry), African Mulberry Moms mesozygia and Wild Plum Harpe-
phyllum caffrum (Kaffir apple).
The Bully Canary Serinus sulphuratus is more commonly known out-
side Africa as the Sulphury Seedeater or Brimstone Canary. It takes seeds
on growing plants including those of pine cones and wild mustard. It has
been recorded feeding on the green or dry seeds of the Candelabra Tree
Euphorbia ingens, Red Salvia Salvia africana and Blue Lupin Lupinus
angustifolius. The fruit and seeds of wild Grenadilla Passiflora edvlis, wild
Fig Ficus burtt-davyi, Cat-thorn Scutia myrtina and pulpy berries of the
Australian Privet Ligustmm sp. and African Mulberry Moms mesozygia.
Milewski (1978) records the Bully as frequently feeding on relatively
large seed types, chiefly seed kernels in developing fleshy fruit. The per-
centage figures of food genera were: 6% Diospyros, 8 % Pelargonium, 2%
Pinus, Cassytha, 1% Cononeaster, Psoralea, Stellaria, Eriocephalus, 5%
Raphanus, Chrysanthemoides, 43% Olea, 3% Chenopodium and 3% unid-
entified. Aviary birds will readily accept the seeds of the Paw Paw Carica
papaya but usually discard the fruit, also the seeds of plants and of grasses
listed for the White-throated Seedeater in addition to Swaziland grass
Digitaria horizois, Canary Creeper Senecio tamoides and Parrot Leaf Al-
ternanthera ficoidea . My thirty-year survey has revealed that the Bully
will accept the following fruits: Nana-berry Rhus dentata, African Cran-
berry Vaccinium exul. Common Forest Grape Rhoicissus tomentosa.

All three species feed live food to nestlings in small quantities, namely
mealworms, termites, aphids, small earthworms and ants' eggs and pupae.
The Bully has been recorded on two occasions feeding small maggots to
nestlings and once small slugs when no other live food was available in
the aviary.
The White-throated Canary constructs a loosely made, shallow cup of
stems and rootlets lined with vegetable down, placed 1-3 m up in the fork
of a bush. It breeds from August to April and three or four, sometimes
two, eggs are laid. The eggs are white, pale greenish, bluish or pinkish
cream, usually immaculate but occasionally spotted and scrolled with
purple, brown and black at the large end. Egg measurements average (50)
19.8 x 14.6 (17.2 - 22.1 x 13.5 - 16.6). Both sexes incubate. The incuba-
tion and nestling periods are not recorded for the wild, but in aviary birds
incubation is recorded as 13 days (1), nestling period 17 days (1).
The Bully Canary builds an open shallow cup which may be strong
and compact or untidy and loosely constructed. The lining may consist of
soft fine grass fibres, woolly down, string, rags or pappi of Composite
plants. The nest may be situated in the fork of a low bush, in a bunch of
bananas or in tall euphorbias. Breeds from July to November in the Cape
Province, South Africa, and with records for all months, except April, in
Zimbabwe. Two to four eggs are laid. They are white, pale green or blue,
spotted and streaked with purple, brown and black. Egg measurements
average (28) 19.5 x 14.2 (17.8 - 20.8 x 13.4 - 14.8). Incubation is by the
female, and lasts 12&amp; - 17 days (4); the nestling period is 15-21 days (2).
The Yellow Canary constructs an open shallow cup consisting of grass
stems, rootlets, tendrils and soft weeds which may be neat and compact
but is sometimes ragged and rather loose. The lining is of fine grass and
other soft materials. Nests are built in a low bush or small tree 30 cm to

3m up from the ground. There are records of nests on the ground. The
breeding season is from December to March in the Transvaal, July to Octo-
ber in the Cape Province, South Africa, and August to January in South
West Africa (Namibia). Three to four eggs are laid which are usually white,
sometimes pale green or blue, plain or sparsely spotted and lined with
purple, brown and black. Egg measurements average (80) 18,0 x 13.2
(16.1 - 20.6 x 12.5 - 14.6). Incubation is by the female and lasts for
12-14 days (2); the nestling period has been recorded as 14 days in the
wild, 15-19 days (2) in aviary birds.
To encourage all three species to breed, branches can be fixed to the
battens of the aviary in the hope that the birds will construct their own
nests. Nesting receptacles such as the wicker canary cup and half-open
nest-boxes should also be available. Nest lining material in the form of
coconut fibre, soft grassheads, moss, cow or horse tail hair, wool, cat
fur, feathers, string, fragments of cloth and partly dried weeds will be
adequate.

The Black-faced Swee Estrilda melanotis is more commonly known
outside Africa as the Dufresne's Waxbill. A common species, usually found
in pairs or small family parties. They are generally very quiet and therefore
easily overlooked, unless disturbed when the alarm call, an explosive tzwee
is heard. It frequents low undergrowth on the edges of evergreen forest
where it spends a lot of the time feeding on seeding grassheads.
The male of the nominate race has the forehead, crown, nape and
upper mantle grey; lores, ear-coverts, sides of face, chin and upper throat
black; mantle and wing-coverts olivaceous green; rump and upper tail-
coverts red; tail blackish; lower throat, breast and flanks pale grey; belly
and under tail-coverts grey, washed with pale yellow; eye red; bill, upper
mandible black, lower red; legs and feet blackish. The female lacks the
black face being pale grey instead. Young birds resemble the female but
the rump and upper tail-coverts are dull rusty orange; bill blackish. E.m.
bocagei differs in being more distinctly barred on the mantle, scapulars
and wing-coverts; belly and under tail-coverts are lemon yellow.
The East African Swee or Yellow-bellied Waxbill are the common
names reserved for three races from East Africa. E.m. quartinia has no
sexual dimorphism. Forehead, crown, nape and sides of face grey; chin
and throat pale grey; rump and upper tail-coverts scarlet; underparts
greenish yellow, deeper on centre of belly. E.m. kilimensis differs from the
proceeding race in being slightly more olivaceous on the mantle. E.m.
stuartwini is similar to E.m. kilimensis but crown, nape and hindneck are
markedly paler and more bluish grey; mantle and wing-coverts pale green
rather than olive-brown; rump and upper tail-coverts less crimson; flanks
less dusky. The names Neisna dufresneyi nyansae Neumann, 1905, and
Neisna minima Ogilvie-Grant, 1906, are synonyms of E.m. kilimensis
(Clancey, 1969).
E.m. melanotis occurs in the South African provinces of the south-

pia, and south-eastern Sudan. E.m. kilimensis is from northern Tanzania
(Pare Mts), highlands of Kenya, Uganda and eastern Zaire. E.m. stuartir-

This species feeds largely on grass seeds, including Natal Red Top Rhyn-
chelytrum repens , Blue Finger Grass Digitaria stentiana and Guinea Grass
Panicum maximum , also Thistle seeds ( Compositae ), unripe seeds of the
Black jack Bidens pilosa and probably seeds of other plants. It feeds on

air, or eaten on the ground. In captivity it has been recorded feeding on
small earthworms, moths, spiders, aphids, thrips, mealworms, ants' eggs
and pupae and mound termites while feeding young. Greenfood in the
form of chickweed, watercress, lettuce or sprouted seed must be given at
least once a fortnight. Softfood can be supplied in the form of the pro-
prietary breakfast cereal 'Pro Nutro', hard-boiled egg, wholewheat bread
or moistened dog biscuits.
In its natural state it constructs a rather flimsy, pear-shaped nest of
dry grass with the entrance hole at one point, and thickly lined with
grass seedheads and feathers. The nest may be sited in the fork of a tree
or shrub, often in a conspicuous location in the garden around houses.
E.m. melanotis breeds from November to March but is also recorded in
June and July. In the aviary it will readily accept the standard finch type
nesting-boxes or utilise any old vacant nest of weavers. The egg colour
is pure white and the measurements are average (50) 13.9 x 10.5 (12.8 -
14.6 x 9.8 - 11.1) mm for E.m. melanotis. A clutch may consist of four
to ten eggs, the large numbers probably being due to two females laying
in the same nest. Aviary clutches average four to seven eggs (six pairs).
The nesting success of six nests was four to five fledgings per nest. Addled
or infertile eggs were left in the nest until the fledglings had ventured out
for the first time. Priest (1971) gives incubation as 11-16 days in the wild.
Aviary birds average 12-13 days (six pairs). Both sexes incubate. The
nesting period is for 19-22 days (six pairs). Both adults feed the young.
The young return to the nest for the first few nights and are independent
at 15-19 days (12 birds).
The Pin-tailed Whydah Vidua macroura has been recorded parasitising
E.m. melanotis in the Cape Province, South Africa.

THE SOUTHERN AFRICAN POPULATION OF THE
GREY WAXBILL Estrilda perreini

This bird is also known as Perrein's Waxbill, Black-tailed Grey Waxbill,
Black-tailed Lavender and Vinegar-tail. It is a shy species which darts into
the nearest thicket when disturbed while uttering a thin, slightly explosive
pseeu, pseeu ; it is usually found singly, in pairs or in a small family group
and is extremely active when seeking food both on the ground and among
the foliage of bushes and creepers. The sexes are alike.
The identification of the nominate race has been described by a num-
ber of researchers and therefore further comment is not necessary. Clancey
(1974) states that E.p. perreini is darker above than E.p. torrida and still
darker than the darkest specimens of E.p. incana, and the rump and upper
tail-coverts are still darker carmine than in the latter. Adults occasionally
have white spots, or white spots on carmine feathers on flanks. E.p. incana
is to be found in the coastal regions and lower midlands of Natal, Zulu-
land, eastern Transvaal, provinces of South Africa as well as Swaziland, Sul
do Save district of Mozambique and eastern Zimbabwe. E.p. torrida in the
Sofala district of southern Mozambique, extending to the littoral of
northern Mozambique and in the south of Malawi along the Shire River.
The species inhabits dune forest, riparian thickets and open woodland.
It feeds by perching on or clinging to seeding grassheads, using the feet to
hold down the food. Besides grass seed which seems to be the major food
source recorded for the wild, Little (1963) observed the birds taking the
seeds of Casuarina, an exotic belonging to the beefwood family and eating
at blossoms of Marula Scterocarya caffra. In the aviary it has been obser-
ved feeding on Goose grass Elusine indica, Catstail Dropseed Sporobolus
pyramidalis, Giant Paspalum Paspalum urvillei , Natal Redtop Rhynchely-
trum repens and Garden Setaria Setaria pallide-fusca. Besides the various
kinds of commercial seeds, they must be supplied with live food regularly
when breeding, namely ant pupae, spiders, aphids, small or cut-up meal-
worms and mound termites. They are partial to nectar which can be
prepared by mixing caramel and brown sugar to form a syrup which can be
placed in a canary tube feeder and fixed to a branch. They have been
noted feeding on the very small ants which are attracted to the syrup.
Breeding takes place from October to March in Natal; there is also a
record for December from Zululand. In the courtship display the male
picks up a long grass stem in its bill and hops around the female singing

and, at the same time, moving the grass from side to side. Copulation does
not occur immediately after the ceremony, but during allo-preening when
the female crouches and performs a rapid vibrating tail movement. Nests
are placed 3-5 m from the ground in a tree, bush or bamboo stand. The
roughly constructed, retort-shaped nest is composed of dried grasses and
seedheads and lined with fine grasses and feathers. A short entrance tun-
nel protrudes from the top of the nest. In southern Africa it has been
recorded utilising and relining the nests of waxbills and weavers, for
example, the Forest Weaver Symplectes bicolor. In captivity I found they
always adopted and relined old nests of Blue Waxbills, namely Blue-
breasted Waxbill Uraeginthus angolensis, Red-cheeked Cordon-bleu U.
bengalus and Blue-capped Waxbill U. cyanocephala. Little interest was

shown in a wide variety of nest-boxes and wicker-type globular baskets
which I purchased from my local pet store. I did find that the old grass
nests of the Thick-billed Weaver Amhlyospiza albifrons, Spotted-backed
Weaver Ploceus cucullatus, Yellow Weaver P. subaureus and Masked
Weaver P velatus were used for roosting only. Four to eight white eggs
were laid. The average measurements for 30 eggs recorded in the wild
were 14.6 x 11.4 (13.7 - 15.4 x 10.5 - 11.5). Both sexes incubated for
12 days with the young fledging at 19-21 days. Immature birds returned
to roost each night for a further 6-8 days in the breeding nest. The nest-
ing success of six nests was four to five fledglings per nest. Young birds
lack the black line through the eye and have duller red over the rump and
upper tail-coverts.

STRAY NOTES ON THE EUROPEAN TURTLE DOVE
By PHILIP G. SCHOFIELD
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.935992648648649" page_id="56953746"  page_num="228" year="" vol="">
(Dorchester, Dorset)
Since seeing my first wild Turtle Doves Streptopelia turtur on a Suffolk
heath in my childhood, the species has been a favourite of mine. A locally
common breeding bird where conditions are suitable, its purring note can
be heard continuously from May to August in favoured areas, never
grating on the ear as can the trisyllabic hooting of the ubiquitous Collared
Dove S. decaocto. The Turtle Doves of my teens were relatively abundant
on the heathland to the east of my native Ipswich, nesting in scattered
hawthorns on the local golf courses, and feeding on the adjacent farmland.
Every nest I found was in a hawthorn, between five and eight feet (1.5 -
2.5 m) from the ground.
Young Turtle Doves, like most Passerine species but in contrast to the
domestic pigeon, have an unfortunate tendency to vacate the nest prema-
turely if disturbed. This must have happened to a somewhat bedraggled
youngster brought to me with a smashed wing in early June, 1971, having
been found with no visible means of support. I hand-reared this bird on
soaked British Finch mixture with a little soaked wheat, and it became
quite tame while caged indoors. Unfortunately the broken wing failed to
knit, and the damaged portion ultimately fell off, leaving an effectively
pinioned bird. This being so, (it was and is a hen) she could not be returned
to the wild, and is, in fact, still with me in robust health. The following
year I was able to obtain an aviary-bred male, and until his death last year
the pair reared many young. Their first few seasons were unsuccessful
until I realised that it is the male that selects the nest site, 'nest-calling'
(crouching and cooing with twitching wing tips) until the hen joins him
there. This behaviour is interrupted by spells of the cock 'driving' his mate,
often pecking at her head and neck; such pursuit stops when the female
is actually on the nest. Only then does nest construction begin. The hen
remains at the nest site while her mate collects short lengths of twig and
presents them to her; she then arranges them to her satisfaction. The
secret of breeding from my flightless female Turtle Dove lay in arranging
a sufficiently seductive nest site to attract the male, near enough to the
ground for the female to reach it without difficulty.
European Turtle Doves are easily sexed, the cock having a naked reddish
purple eye-ring which is lacking in the hen. This feature is already evident
when the young are still in juvenile plumage. Adult feather is assumed in
the spring of the year following that in which the bird was hatched. Adult

birds also become appreciably brighter at this season, apparently by the
same process of feather abrasion that brings the male Brambling Fringilla
montifringilla into summer plumage.
Although two nests appear to be usual in the wild, my captive Turtle
Doves have managed to rear three broods in a season. Even in a small
aviary some 6 ft 2 (1.83 m sq), I found that young of successive broods
could safely remain with the parents until the following spring when they
had to be removed. I once lost a beautiful yearling hen by failing to re-
move her from the breeding aviary when the old male showed signs of
resenting her continued presence in spring. Presumably it is the assumption
of adult plumage that makes the difference between acceptance and aggres-
sion. I found the closely related Senegal, Palm or Laughing Dove S. sene-
galensis far less tolerant, young birds having to be removed from the
parents for their own safety as soon as they could feed themselves.
The two young in a nest are not necessarily the traditional 'pigeon pair'
of opposite sexes. Four young reared in two rounds in 1981 all laid eggs
the following spring.
My Turtle Doves have proved very amiable with other species, although
they will not agree with other Streptopelia species. I have seen them kept
under very crowded conditions with the domestic Barbary Dove S. ' risoria'
but only the latter bred, and not very successfully, under such conditions.
Turtles in my aviaries have lived peacefully with both Indian Green-winged
Chalcophaps indica and Stock Doves Columha oenas, these distantly rela-
ted birds ignoring each other's existence most of the time.
Turtle x Barbary hybrids are easily produced, and favour the Turtle in
the F 1 generation, having fewer bars on the neck and a long drawn-out di-
syllabic coo , very different from the single purring note of the Turtle or
the cuck-roocoo of the Barbary. I had a hybrid male for several years, but
only bred one young, which was to all intents and purposes a grey Bar-
bary - a reversion to the dominant colouring of the latter's wild ancestor,
the African Collared Dove S. roseogrisea. Having sold this F 2 young to a
dealer, together with a batch of young Barbaries, I never managed to rear
another. Both with the original Barbary hen, and later with a female
Collared Dove, fertility was excellent but few eggs actually hatched. Of
those that did, all the old hybrid's subsequent offspring died in the nest,
often as they were feathering. I have read of grey Barbary strains being
established from hybrids, so evidently not all Turtle hybrids are of limited
productive capabilities. However, a female hybrid which a friend kept at
liberty mated to a Barbary cock, never hatched an egg. Turtle Doves
would presumably cross with other Streptopelia as readily as with the
Barbary. A rarer hybrid is that with the domestic pigeon, which has been
achieved on a number of occasions, using a small Tippler or a Tumbler

pigeon.
I have referred to a female Barbary x Turtle hybrid kept at liberty. My
old hybrid cock was often allowed to fly free, but I always tried to ensure
that he roosted in the aviary, as Tawny Owls Strix aluco were abundant in
the area, and these birds are partial to dove suppers. An aggressive indivi-
dual, he would pursue local Collared Doves far over the horizon, but
never lost his way, always returning to his Barbary mate. The latter could
not be left free unsupervised, being of a naively trusting disposition where
cats and dogs were concerned. Not all these hybrids are such reliable
homers. A friend in Devon had four young of the year, grandchildren of
my old pair on their mother's side, flying free last autumn. Having deligh-
ted their breeder with much spectacular fast flying, they all disappeared on
the same day, and were presumed to have migrated.
While on the subject of migration, an odd thing happened to my old
pair of Turtles in 1978. At that time they were still in the care of my
parents at the family home in Ipswich. The male escaped at Easter of that
year, and although seen and heard in the gardens nearby, defied attempts
at recapture. However, towards the end of October, when the last of his
wild conspecifics had left for Africa, this aviary-bred bird returned home
and demanded access to the aviary, which needless to say was hastily
granted.
Although not normally found wild in these islands in winter, my Turtle
Doves have always proved extremely hardy, wintering in comfort with
only an open-fronted shelter which they always have the sense to use. A
wild bird in Dorset in the 1960's showed considerable enterprise. Having
decided (or been compelled by circumstances beyond its control) to spend
the winter in this country, it joined up with a free-flying flock of Barbaries
then kept at Portland Bird Observatory, eating their food and roosting
indoors with them at night!
My thirteen-year old hen Turtle Dove may with reasonable luck be with
me for some time to come. In the Avicultural Magazine for May 1936,
Dr. C.H Macklin refers to a Turtle Dove in his possession still in good
health at the age of 29!

Colius striatus
By SUSAN L. BERMAN
(Dept, of Biology, College of the Holy Cross, Worcester, Mass., USA)
Mousebirds (Coliiformes) have been the subject of natural history
accounts (Van Someren, 1956; Rowan, 1967), as well as systematic and
anatomical investigations (Murie, 1872; Garrod, 1896; Sclater, 1903;
Pycraft, 1907; Lowe, 1948; Verheyen, 1956; Berman and Raikow, 1982),
but behavioural studies of the group have been limited to isolated and
often conflicting reports. The following observations are a by-product of a
morphological study of the hindlimb musculature of the order (Berman &amp;
Raikow, 1982). In confirming our functional interpretation of peculiarities
of the hindlimb, I observed two small colonies of captive Colius striatus ,
the Speckled Mousebird, for 14 months. The purpose of this paper is to
report findings that are in conflict with previous studies, as well as those
not previously recorded, and to confirm observations of uncertain validity.
All of the birds were acquired from the Pittsburgh Aviary. They were
trapped out of a very large indoor area from a flock that had been breed-
ing freely for five years. They had not been banded, hence age and rela-
tionships were uncertain. I was unable to sex them using Gibson's method
(1980) or any other external characters. Individuals were distinguished
from one another by notches in their rectrices. One eventually revealed
itself to be a female by copulation and egg-laying.
The first colony initially consisted of five, and later eight birds. They
were housed indoors in a wire mesh cage 5 x 3 x 6 ft high (1.53 x 0.92 x
1.83 m high), containing a network of dead branches along with fresh
pine brances suspended from the roof. The birds were maintained on a
diet of fresh fruit and vegetables placed in a container hung 3 ft (0.92 m)
above the floor. Water was provided in a shallow bowl on the floor. A tray
12 x 16 x 2 in (0.35 x 0.97 x 0.05 m) containing fine sand was placed in
one corner of the cage to permit dust-bathing. This colony was observed
from September 1980 to August 1981.
A second colony of six individuals (one of the original colony and five
new birds) was kept in a large outdoor aviary measuring 25 x 10 x 7 ft
high (7.75 x 3.10 x 2.17 m), half of which was completely enclosed. A
diet that was identical to that of the first colony was provided, but as the
mousebirds shared the aviary with six peafowl, commercial turkey feed
was available on the ground. This colony was observed from mid-August
1982 to late October 1982.

SUSAN L. BERMAN - SPECKLED MOUSEBIRD
Use of water
There have been some questions concerning the use of water by mouse-
birds. Gibson (1979) never observed the C macrouris in his aviary drinking
water. Rowan (1967) observed the three South African species (C colius,
C indicus and C. striatus) drinking water in the wild, but only C. striatus
took water in his aviary. Moreover, the birds drank using suction, as in the
Columbiformes. Shifter (1972) observed captive C. indicus, C. macrouris
and C striatus drinking a mixture of honey and water. Each of the C. stri-
atus in my aviaries were observed drinking in this manner at least once.
Observations were made for varying periods at different times of the day,
and records of the frequency of each individual's trips to the water were
not kept. But, as the total number of instances recorded each week
throughout the 14 months was from three to five, drinking seems to be
reasonably common behaviour in C striatus. It is likely that relative
humidity and moisture content of their diet determine the quantity of
water consumed.
Rowan (1967) observed water bathing in pet mousebirds, but never
in his aviary birds. Schifter (1972) observed captive C indicus, C. mac-
rouris and C striatus bathing against wet leaves. Gibson (1980) records
captive C macrouris bathing against wet flower heads. On three occasions
in the small indoor aviary (twice in September and once in January) I
observed different individuals of C striatus bathing in the water dish on
the floor. The baths lasted from three to five minutes and the birds got
little more than their breast and abdomen wet. On another occasion, in
late September, three of the birds in the indoor colony were induced to
bathe from branches when misted with a hand sprayer. Bathing behaviour
was not observed in the outdoor aviary, but it is likely that the birds took
advantage of the rain, rather than using the water dish.
Food-sharing
Whereas Rowan (1967) reports only occasional food-sharing between
captive adult C colius, C. striatus and C. indicus, this was a very common
activity among the birds in both of my colonies. Food items were often
carried to a waiting individual clear at the opposite end of the cage. Three
of the birds engaged in this activity among themselves more often than
with the others, and two of these three later proved to be a pair. Food-
sharing, however, was never observed in connection with courtship or cop-
ulation, as described by Schifter (1967).
In addition, a teasing behaviour with some preferred food item was
common. Typically a bird would carry the item to the vicinity of some
individual at a distance from the food dish. Holding the item in the bill,
the bird would point it first toward and then away from the other bird

with short, upward jerks of the head. This usually resulted in the item
being stolen, and in eight observed instances this theft was accomplished
with the foot, rather than the bill.
Courtship and nesting behaviour
There are only a few accounts of courtship behaviour in mousebirds.
James (1948) described a display followed by copulation in C. indicus.
In this case it was the female that carried out the display. Rowan (1967)
described the same display in a tame C. indicus. As it was not followed
by copulation, the sex of the bird was not determined. Schifter (1967)
gives a description of breeding behaviour in C. indicus, C. macrouris and
C. striatus.
From November 1980 onwards, I frequently observed courtship and
copulation in one pair of C. striatus kept in the indoor aviary. The display
was similar to that given by the previous descriptions with one exception.
Whereas Schiften (1967) observed his C striatus bouncing only 1 cm
above the branch, mine consistently bounced a full 4 cm, like that des-
cribed for other species. In each case only the male displayed. Typically
after about five minutes of the 'bouncing and hooing' behaviour, the fe-
male would land next to him and copulation, lasting from 3-4 s, would
take place immediately. The same pair constructed nests on four occasions
(Table 1). The nests were as described by Rowan (1967). Pieces of string,
twigs, and dried grass were the main constituents. Overgrown broccoli, a
favourite food, was often supplied in July. The nest constructed at that
time was regularly 'decorated' with yellow broccoli flowers. The stems had
been poked into the substance of the nest, and the flowers hung down
below. Rowan (1967) has also observed this habit in C. striatus.
Both parents took turns incubating. Rowan (1967) suggests that at
least in the South African species more than two birds may participate in
construction of a nest, and that a nest may contain the eggs of more than
one hen. I never observed any interest in a nest on the part of birds other
than the parents. None of the eggs hatched, and each nest was abandoned

after three weeks. Examination of the eggs in the April clutch revealed
embryos in a very early stage of development. I suspect that failure of the
first three attempts may have been due to low temperatures in the room
where the birds were kept.
Rowan (1967) compiled data indicating that South African mouse-
birds are capable of breeding any time of the year, but do so most fre-
quently during the warmer months, and at times when vegetation is put-
ting on new growth. Schifter (1967) concluded that mousebirds were
opportunistic, breeding at any time of the year when conditions were
favourable. I found no correlation between temperature and breeding
behaviour, but almost all my observations of courtship and copulation
took place following two or three days of rain, such as might promote
rapid plant growth given the proper temperatures.
Agonistic behaviour
Gibson (1979) and Rowan (1967) comment on the gregarious and
non-aggressive nature of mousebirds. Rowan actually relates incidents
in which different flocks of the same species were drawn together, ap-
parently fully accepting one another. Likewise, Schifter (1972) kept three
species (C. indicus, C. macrouris and C striatus ) in the same aviary and
never observed any conflicts. My observations were quite the opposite.
Each group of birds had been caught in the same trap, hence it seems
likely that they were foraging together and were members of the same
family group. In any case, there was no aggression among the first five
birds, which had been trapped together and introduced into the cage with
the original five. Fighting broke out immediately. The original group
banded together and chased the new birds, biting them on the feet and
the back of the head. At one point one of the aggressors used his foot
to seize one of the new birds by the tail, pull him off a branch, and dangle
him upside down momentarily.
After 45 minutes the fighting began to diminish and the two groups
retired to opposite sides of the cage. Eight hours after the introduction of
the new birds, individuals of the two groups were feeding quietly from the
same dish. When they all roosted in the same clump, it seemed that inte-
gration had taken place, confirming previous reports of the peaceful
nature of these birds. No further aggression was observed during the next
14 days.
On the morning of the fifteenth day, after hearing an unusual amount
of vocalisation from the aviary, I found the three new birds dead. They
had all been killed in the same manner: the feathers on the back of the
head had been pulled off, the skull opened, and part of the brain removed.
One of the original five was still occupied with a victim as I approached
the cage, hence the possibility of rodents can be discounted.

The same sequence of events took place in the larger aviary. After
three seemingly peaceful weeks, the bird from the original flock was
killed in the same manner, presumably by the five new birds, which had
been trapped together.
It can certainly be argued that, both being captive, and thus unnatural
situations, this is not normal behaviour. However, as the four birds were
killed in the same manner, and by birds of another group, it is possible
that this is part of their behavioural repertoire. At the very least, these
observations shed doubt on previous reports of the consistently peaceful
nature of these birds.
Digit configurations
Mousebirds have long been of interest morphologically because of
their ability to rotate both the hallux and the fourth digit cranially and
caudally, producing zygodactyly, anisodactyly, or pamprodactyly. Digit
configurations are often associated with certain postures or activities in
the groups possessing them, so it seemed possible that in mousebirds
certain arrangements could be correlated with particular activities. Initial
observations (Berman and Raikow, 1982) as well as these subsequent
studies indicate that this is not the case in at least one species. C striatus
is entirely opportunistic in its digit configurations. Opposability of the
first and fourth digits enables the foot to conform to or grasp any surface
with which it comes into contact.

A QUESTION OF IDENTITY
By TONY SILVA
(Illinois, USA)
Correct identification of certain subspecies of parrots is a problem that
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.99591105" page_id="56953754"  page_num="236" year="" vol="">
everyone eventually faces. Normally their correct identity is irrelevant,
except when pairing for breeding but there are two parrots whose misid-
entification can prove costly - to the extent of several hundred dollars.
Allow me to explain.
Almost monthly I receive calls from aviculturists having one problem
or another with the Tres Marias Amazon Amazona ochrocephala tres-
mariae, (subspecies of the Yellow-crowned Amazon), an insular parrot
found on four islands off Nayarit, western Mexico. The scientific and
common names are derived from three of these islands - Maria Madre,
Maria Magdalena and Maria Cleofas. The fourth island, the smallest in the
group, is called San Juanico.
Confusion arises because Yellow-crowned Amazons of the subspecies
magna , from the Atlantic lowlands in Tamaulipas to Tabasco, or older
Double Yellow-crowned Amazons (subspecies oratrix) are frequently,
but incorrectly, called 'Tres Marias Amazons'.
Until 1981 I accepted birds heavily endowed in yellow as tresmariae,
but that year a visit to the Los Angeles County Museum started to cast a
doubt. In the upper archives were several specimens collected by K.S.
Stager in 1956 on Maria Madre. They certainly differed from what avicul-
turists were calling 'Tres Marias Amazons'.

Sometime later I met Walt Hansen, an aviculturist in San Diego, who
told me of his interest in tresmariae and in visiting the island to see what
the lineament was of live birds. I encouraged him to travel there. After
some difficulty - visits to the island are controlled by the Mexican Depart-
ment of Prevention and Social Re-adaptation, given that the whole of
Maria Madre is a penal colony - he received permission from the Director
General, Licenciado Antonio Garcia Orozco. In the second week of April
1983 he arrived on Maria Madre via a Mexican navy vessel.
His return to the US disclosed some interesting and (for me) unsur-
prising information: the true tresmariae is very much unlike those that
have been referred to as such in the trade. His evidence is backed by a
number of photographs of adults and young - a move that should quell
those that impugned his findings, doing so presumably because they
would be unable to procure the very large sums obtained from tresmariae
for magna or old oratrix.
Walt Hansen published his findings in the February/March 1984 issue
of Watch bird. Details can be summarised as follows:
Immature birds have far more yellow than typical oratrix , approximat-
ing that of magna ; it extends to the terminus of cheeks, or is about equal
to that found in four year old oratrix. The head of adult tresmariae is
covered in an 'indefinable' colour of yellow, which is noticeable in skins; it
lacks the intensity of that found in magna. The bend of wing of the insular
birds has very little yellow and red, the extent being identical to typical
oratrix. Yellow on the thighs is reduced to a minimum, not nearly
covering the complete area as in some magna. Prominent in tresmariae and
not in other Yellow-crowned (including belizensis , the Belize Yellow-
crowned) is a bluish wash to underparts - a characteristic prominent even
in study skins.
Why did confusion arise? My opinion is that it can be attributed to the
absence of magna from Forshaw's Parrots of the World (Lansdowne Press,
Australia); he amalgamated magna with oratrix. Virtually everyone dealing
with parrots uses this mongraph as the standard, but given the absence of
magna thinks that the birds heavily endowed with yellow belong to
tresmariae.
The Atlantic magna was described by B.L. Monroe and T.R. Howell in
a paper published by the Museum of Zoology, Louisiana State University,
in 1966. Characteristics are noted in this subspecies as follows: size Is large
(from whence the scientific name is derived - in this respect it exceeds
both oratrix and tresmariae ), and head is entirely yellow, a colour that is
extensive on thighs and bend of wings (which also contain red). A linea-
ment often obvious but not noted by Monroe and Howell is the presence
of reddish edged or tinged feathers in the nape of male magna and tres-

mariae.
Using the above criteria, there are no tresmariae in confinement in the
US to my knowledge, but there are a number of oratrix and magna, the
last having arrived (legally and illegally) in any quantity since the late
1970's.
The other enigma is the Triton Cockatoo Cacatua galerita triton from
Indonesia, New Guinea and certain small islands. It can be separated from
the other races of galerita by the broader crest feathers, blue orbital ring,
longer nape feathers and (in many) heavier bill. Tritons are often confused
with Medium Sulphur-crested Cockatoos C.s. eleonora, which has a
smaller, slimmer bill, narrower crest feathers, smaller size and white
orbital ring, though immatures may have a blueish tinge to the perio-
phthalmic ring; this area thickens with age, when it turns white.
Using measurements in Parrots of the World one gets the impression
that differences between triton and eleonora are not substantial - but they
are. Living birds, side by side, show the aforementioned features.
As with tresmariae, the prices fetched by triton are far greater than for
Mediums, often called Eleonora Cockatoos, after the scientific name.
Correct identification of these two parrots on both the part of the seller
and buyer is therefore imperative.

Whilst we would never wish to cramp an author's style in any way, even
less to discourage members from writing at all, we are sometimes asked for
guidelines as to what is needed, and it may well be that valuable informa-
tion is going unrecorded because authors did not realise that it was of in-
terest. Therefore the following notes are offered as suggestions, but not
rules, for contributors to the AviculturalMagazine&amp;apos;.
Articles should be preferably typed (in double spacing), but neatly
hand-written articles are perfectly acceptable. They must not have been
published elsewhere in the same form. The scientific names of birds
should be given as well as the vernacular and alternate vernacular names.
We prefer not to include long and complicated tables but can add a note
saying that copies of these are available from the Editor, on request.
The maximum length of articles is usually 5,000 words but longer
articles can be published in separate instalments; there is no minimum
length and indeed short notes or letters for inclusion in the Correspon-
dence Column are always welcome.

The following guidelines may be of help when making notes and later
in writing them up. It must be emphasised that these are ideal requirements
and that the lack of some of this information should in no way discourage
authors. Less fully comprehensive accounts, provided they give accurate
information, are always welcome.
However, in the case of a presumed first breeding in the British Isles,
where the author is claiming the Society's Medal, it should be pointed out
that the Society's Rules require that: 'The account of the breeding must
be reasonably full so as to afford information to our Members, and must
appear in the Avicultural Magazine before it is published elsewhere. It
should describe the plumage of the young, and be of value as a permanent
record of the nesting and general habits of the species. These points will
have great weight when the question of awarding the Medal is under con-
sideration.'
Ideally a breeding report should try to give the following information:
A brief description of the species, its distribution and habitat, its
status in the wild and in aviculture. Longevity, if known. Whether a
good avicultural subject.
History of breeding pair - ages, how long kept, whether captive bred,
any previous breeding attempts.
Description of accommodation - sizes of indoor and outdoor aviaries,
layout, how furnished, whether and how heated, whether shared,
other birds in adjoining aviaries.
Diet, including vitamin and mineral additives; how many meals a day
and when given.
Veterinary and hygiene notes.
Breeding:
Nest-box - description and when put in. Nesting material.

In reference to Dr. Quincfie's paper on breeding the
Cloven-feathered Dove (Drepanoptila holosericea)
In common, I presume, with all other readers of our magazine who
have any interest in either doves or bird behaviour, I read with great
interest and pleasure Dr. Henry Quinque's article (in Vol. 91, Nos. 1 and 2
of our magazine) on his breeding of the Cloven-feathered Dove.
Considered only from an avicultural point of view (and I do not write
'only' in any deprecatory sense, far from it), the repeated successes that
have justly crowned his painstaking and no doubt costly efforts must be a
source of great satisfaction to himself and should arouse the commenda-
tion and admiration of others.
From the point of view of bird behaviour, his article brings us the first
proof that in at least one species of pigeon only the hen incubates, broods
and feeds the young. This proof comes at a most timely moment, as some
recent observations in the wild on three other fruit doves have suggested,
though not with certainty proved, that in them also only the females
build, incubate, brood and feed young.
These three species are the Orange Dove Ptilinopus victor , the Golden
Dove P. luteovirens and the Green or Velvet Dove P. layardi . They are
sometimes put in a separate genus Chrysoena, and although in my pigeon
book, I gave Chrysoena only subgeneric rank, I may well have been wrong
to do so.
These three species all occur in the Fiji Islands, no two occurring
together on any one island. Although much smaller than the Cloven-
feathered Dove and quite distinct from it, their shape and plumage texture
suggest (at least to me) that they and Drepanoptila are more closely
related to each other than any of them is to the more typical species of
Ptilinopus. None of them shows comparable differences in the size of the
sexes to those of the Cloven-feathered Dove but two of them show marked
sexual differences in colour, that in the Orange Dove being perhaps the
greatest in any pigeon as the adult cock is almost all brilliant orange and
the hen almost all dark green in colour.
A nest of the Orange Dove and a nest of the Green Dove, found in the
wild, were each visited on several occasions at different times of day and
only the hens found on them. A female of the Golden Dove was seen
carrying a twig to its nest site (usually the male's 'job' in the pigeon
family) and then building with it. A few years ago, William N. Beckon
wrote a most stimulating paper on these three odd Fijian doves, pointing
out that the above observations, and some others not involving nests, all
strongly suggested even though they did not conclusively prove that these
three doves might be polygynous, with successful males holding territory

in which more than one female nested and reared her young. Dr Beckon
kindly sent me a pre-publication copy of his paper (which I still have) but,
unfortunately, I do not now recall whether, or if so where, it was pub-
lished.
One of Dr. Quinque's most intriguing observations is that the male
Clovenfeathered Dove, in the days prior to the hen's laying, 'descends to
the ground ..and remains there quite a long time' at intervals. Is it
possible that in the wild display and copulation take place on or near the
ground? Or even that the Cloven-feathered Dove may, like some other
mainly arboreal tropical forest birds, be a 'lek' bird that has its display or
mating places on the forest floor?.
Such a question as the last may sound absurd but not more absurd,
surely, than it would have been ten years or so ago to ask the same ques-
tion about any parrot? Yet we now know (see, inter alia, p. 55 of the same
issue of our magazine) that one parrot does do this. And a flightless one at
that!
As he does not describe it, I presume that, at the time of his writing the
article, Dr. Quinque had not actually seen copulation by his Cloven-
feathered Doves. If he now has, I hope he will describe it in our magazine
together, of course, with any other new observations he makes on these
birds.
It is to be hoped that Dr. Quinque, and later others, will be able to
perpetuate this unique and beautiful dove in captivity. Also that adequate
protection from sportsmen (or are French bird protectionists, like their
British counterparts, legally bound not to oppose 'legitimate sport'?) and
adequate reserves of suitable habitat can and will be maintained for it in its
native island.
Indeed, at risk of annoying conventional conservationists, and first
assuring them that our fair editor is not responsible for the opinions of her
correspondents, I would suggest that if numbers of Cloven-feathered Doves
can be bred, and if an island (or better still two or three islands) can be
found where it would seem likely to thrive and unlikely to incommode
any bird as rare, unique and beautiful as itself, there would be a very good
case for introducing and trying to establish it elsewhere.

Sulking in Parrots
Two unusual events occurred recently in our collection of parrots, that
I have not come across before, and both occurred during the same week
and in two individuals of the same species.
Placing unmated birds in outdoor enclosures amongst suitable com-
panions is always a problem, and involves consideration of many factors
including the strength, temperament, flying ability and food accessibility
of and for all the inmates - but is always easier if none of them have been
resident in the aviary for too long.
I have a small range of six aviaries, too public to be suitable for breed-
ing pairs, that I have been using for new introductions to the Park, mixed
with unmated birds, and I consider four birds of a parrot size to be suffic-
ient for each.
In one flight I had two cock Thick-billed Parrots Rhynchopsitta pachy-
rhyncha, cage-cramped and unable to fly very well, and one adult hen
Zimbabwean Cape Parrot Poicephalus suahelicus which was fit and active
and they had been together for two months or so. Next door I had a
newly-introduced cock and hen South African Cape Parrots P. r. robustus
still a little cage-cramped, but becoming active and vocal and beginning to
take an interest in each other and they had been out of doors for six weeks
or so. Further on, I had two cock Slender-billed Cockatoos Cacatua e. pas-
tinator.
I had a spare cock Bare-eyed Cockatoo Cacatua sanguinea for which I
had to find an aviary so I put it in the first aviary. The Thick-billed Parrots
showed aggression to it but since it was a good flyer, it could quietly
move out of the way and by the end of the day, things had settled down
with the Cape Parrot hen and cockatoo cock showing not the slightest
interest in each other. Incidentally, my experience with Cape Parrots is
that they can show unprovoked aggression towards other birds and are
generally not good mixers.
The next morning the Zimbabwean Cape hen was sitting in the sun, on
the ground below the feeding table, surrounded by sunflower seed, and I
thought nothing of it until in the afternoon she was still sitting in the same
place and I became suspicious. I got one of the staff to move her as she
was so obviously weak. We took her inside to the bird room, put her in
a cage with heat and gave her antibiotics in the drinking water as a pre-
caution but by the evening she could barely lift her head. She obviously
was too weak to feed herself and so was force-fed with moistened Pro-
Nutro.
But to cut a long story short, she survived and within the week was
100% fit again. One explanation for this could be that she had to change

her night roosting place because of the new inmate, and got a chill as a
consequence but since the nights here at that time were very mild, I do
not think this would apply. Anyhow, I had my doubts until the second
incident occurred.
A few days later I put a single hen Lesser Sulphur-crested Cockatoo
Cacatua sulphurea in with the pair of South African Cape Parrots and
this time I was watching the reactions more carefully. There was abso-
lutely no interest of any kind shown between the three birds and one
could have concluded that they had been together for years.
However, there was one small difference in the activity of the Cape
Parrots - the hen was flitting about, calling as usual, but the cock bird
was sitting against the back wall as if he was roosting for the night. I
checked on him at least six times a day and always he was in the same
position. Bearing in mind the incident in the next door aviary, I removed
the cockatoo and immediately the cock Cape Parrot flew over to the
clip-on food dish and started to feed. I dsitribute many feeding sites
when I mix birds, or first introduce them to new quarters, and he had
easy access to two, and was, in fact, sitting above one seed tray, so food
was no problem. By the following day he was his old self again.
I can only conclude from these two unusual happenings that the
Poicephalus parrots, including Jardine's P. gulielmi which is a poor travel-
ler, are uncommon in captivity because possibly their stress factor is not
fully understood. There is no doubt that they were distressed by the
introductions of a new bird and showed this, not by aggression, but by
sulking. They were fully used to seeing the white cockatoos next door.
Finally, I have at least got a pair of Zimbabwean Cape Parrots sitting
on eggs (June 1965) but they are winter breeders here and we now have
two pairs of each variety in the collection, and the pair of South African
Cape Parrots mentioned above are looking in their box and taking an
interest in each other.

It came as a great sadness to members of the Avicultural Society to
learn that our President died on 5th November, 1985, in Los Angeles. He
had been in failing health for some time, but retained his perceptiveness
and sense of humour to the last.
For most of this century Jean Delacour played a unique role by being a
prominent ornithologist, aviculturist and, latterly, conservationist, and he
made a brilliant and sustained contribution to all the fields in which he
participated.
He was bom in Paris of a wealthy family who always encouraged his
interests and he began collecting birds at the age of ten. By the time he
was 15 he had one of the largest collections then in existence, established
at his family's country house at Villers-Bretonneux. Following its destruc-
tion in the 1914-18 war, the collection was very soon recreated at Cleres
in Normandy in the grounds of the chateau which was to become his
permanent base, Geres became world famous particularly for the
collection of waterfowl which was one of the best and most extensive ever
assembled. During World War II Jean Delacour again experienced the
misery of losing his collection, which again he rebuilt with his charac-
teristic enthusiasm when he was able to return to France from America
where he had spent the war. He had by then become an American citizen
and for the rest of his life he continued to spend most of the year in
America, returning to Normandy each summer.
Between the wars Jean Delacour made many expeditions all over the
world, studying and collecting birds and was appointed by the French
Government to organise the zoological exploration of French Indo-China
from 1923 to 1940.
In America he was appointed research associate at the American
Museum of Natural History and Director of the Department of History,
Science and Art at the Los Angeles County Museum.
He was a very prolific author, contributing many hundreds of articles

to various journals, including our own, and from 1920 to 1940 was editor
of the French journal L'Oiseau. His books included: Les Oiseaux de
rindochine Francaise (with P. Jabouille), Birds of the Philippines (with
E. Mayr), Birds of Malaya, Pheasants of the World, Guide des Oiseaux de
Nouvelle Caledonie et de ses Dependances, Curassows and Related Birds
(with D. Amadon), Birds of Malaysia, his autobiography The Living Air,
and the work for which he is probably best known, the monumental
Waterfowl of the World, a complete survey of the family in four volumes.
He was President of many important organisations, in particular the
International Committee for Bird Preservation from 1938 to 1958 where
his twin roles of ornithologist and aviculturist enabled him to combine
these interests with those of conservation.
Jean Delacour was always a great supporter of the Avicultural Society
which he joined in 1916 (surely his must be the longest membership?) and
contributed regularly to the Avicultural Magazine for the best part of 70
years. When he was elected President in 1972, he took a keen interest in
the affairs of the Society and although he was unable to attend many
Council Meetings, he always read the minutes that were sent to him and
often undertook commissions for the Society on his travels. He was also a
generous benefactor. In all, the Society was extremely privileged to have
had such a distinguished friend as its President. Any time spent with Jean
Delacour was always stimulating and enjoyable. We were honoured to have
known him and will remember him with love and respect.

The Council has decided to dedicate a special issue of the Avicultural
Magazine to Jean Delacour and contributions will be very welcome. We
have already received some appreciations and no doubt more will be
forthcoming, so in order to avoid inevitable repetition, it is proposed to
assemble a compilation of extracts from all of them. In addition, we would
particularly like to receive articles about various aspects of Jean Delacour's
work and the birds and/or areas in which he was especially interested,
possibly reviewing and bringing up to date his researches and writings. The
Editor will be very glad to hear from anyone who feels that they can
contribute or can suggest possible contributors.

MISS RUTH EZRA - PRESIDENT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98938125" page_id="56953785"  page_num="3" year="" vol="">
At its meeting on 23rd February 1986, the Council unanimously
elected Miss Ruth Ezra as our new President and we are very honoured
that she has accepted this post as she has been one of the Society&amp;apos;s greatest
supporters and benefactors for many years.
Her father, Alfred Ezra, QBE, was one of the legendary names in avi-
culture and his collection at Foxwarren Park in Surrey was renowned
throughout the world, many first breeding successes having been achieved
there. Miss Ezra's connections with the Avicultural Society go right back
to her early years at Foxwarren Park where her father invited members
each year to visit the collection. She has continued this tradition at Chest-
nut Lodge, Cobham, where she entertains members each summer to see
the magnificent collection of birds which she owns with Mr. Raymond
Sawyer.
Mr. Alfred Ezra was President of this Society from 1926 to 1955 ; it is
particularly appropriate that his daughter should now occupy this position
and we welcome her as an old friend.

REARING THE BROWN FISH OWL Ketupa zeylonensis
AT THE PAIGNTON ZOO (Devon)
By MISS JO GREGSON (Head Birdkeeper)
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9949575" page_id="56953786"  page_num="4" year="" vol="">
There are four species of the genus Ketupa distributed from the Middle
to the Far East but the Brown Fish Owl is by far the most widespread,
four subspecies occupying a range from Israel in the west through India,
Burma and Ceylon to China in the east.
It inhabits wooded country, seeking out overgrown ravines and steep
banks near rivers and streams in which it catches the fish and crabs that
form the main part of its diet, though small mammals and birds are also
taken.
This very handsome owl is 22 in (0.55 m) long. The sexes are alike in
plumage which is generally a reddish brown above, with black streaks and
beige and white spots; underneath it is whitish with brown streaks and
bars. Its feet and claws are especially adapted to catch and hold its slip-
pery prey and resemble those of the Osprey.
In the wild, the breeding season is from December to March, generally
in February.
This Fish-Owl was kept quite commonly in aviaries but the numbers
have dwindled in recent years, probably due to the restrictions on import-
ing and keeping birds of prey. This species has laid eggs in several collec-
tions but we believe that it has never before been reared successfully in
Britain, though the closely related Javan Fish Owl Ketupa ketupu was bred
at London Zoo in 1967 (Aviculturai Magazine, 1968, pp. 17-18).
A male Brown Fish Owl had been in the collection here since 1967; in
April 1981 it was paired with a seven-year old female received in exchange
from 'Birdworld', Surrey.
The pair live in an unheated outdoor flight, constructed of 1 in (2.5
cm) chain link, laced on to a tubular metal framework, measuring 20 x
10 Vi x lOVz ft high (6.00 x 3.20 x 3.20 m). Aviary furniture includes
natural perching, natural tree stumps, a large Bay shrub Laurus nobilis , and
a raised feeding ledge. At the base of the shrub is a large water tray. A
roofed, wood-partitioned area as wide as the aviary extends 5 ft (1.52 m)
beyond the back of the flight. The roofing also projects forward some 5 ft
in order to provode outdoor shelter. The nest-box 6Yi ft (1.97 m) above
the floor is positioned inside the partitioned area aligned with an access
hole (for the owls) measuring IVz x 1 ft high (0.45 x 0.30 m). Keeper
access is by means of lower small hinged door. Since the aviary is sand-
wiched between other similar owl flights, there are two entrance/exit

doors in either side as well as a seldom-used door in the front of the aviary.
In January 1982 the pair began to use an open-fronted nest-box
measuring 30 x 16 x 24 in high (0.75 x 0.40 x 0.60) with a 6 in (1.82 m)
upstand. A few days later one thin-shelled broken egg was found on the
aviary floor. Despite constant improvements to the birds' diet, the clutches
laid in 1983 and 1984 were both thin-shelled and broken. The nest-box
proved unsuitable for the purposes of removing eggs undamaged and at
the end of 1984 a newly-designed nest-box was fitted in the hope that we
would be able to remove an egg before it was broken. The new box was
open-topped and measured 24 in x 24 in x 12 in high (0.60 x 0.60 x 0.30
m), with a 12 in square front drop flap allowing easier access to the
eggs. The floor of the box (drilled in places for drainage) was layered with
peat and scattered with old pellets!
On 9th January 1985 one egg was removed for artificial incubation; a

It refused food offered by hand on day 33 and fed independently on day 42.
second egg had already been cracked and failed to hatch. The incubator
was run dry until the chick had moved into the air space on 7th February.
The next morning the chick had hatched. It was very strong with eyes
partially open, but its navel had not yet healed. The chick may have
escaped too soon from its thin shell and not had sufficient time for the
yolk sac to be completely withdrawn into the abdomen. Fortunately
after swabbing it with antiseptic, it healed over without any developing
infection.
The chick took its first feed at midday. It comprised trout and soft
pieces of mouse. Thereafter it was fed approximately every two hours
from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. each day and tweezers were used to hold the food;
SA37, a vitamin supplement, was dusted onto one feed every fourth day.
For the first two days the chick was kept in the incubator, after which
it was placed in a brooder. Two 60-watt light bulbs supplied ample heat.
The first small pieces of mouse bone were fed on the fourth day. Fur
and feather were fed from the eighth day and fish were filleted before
feeding. By day 15, the chick was covered in quills and therefore one

60-watt light bulb was exchanged for a 25-watt bulb. At 20 days it was
beak clicking and hissing when disturbed, as a means of defence.
Much to everyone's surprise, the first pellet was not regurgitated until
day 26 after which a pellet was produced almost every other day. Once
we were sure it could pass pellets regularly, whole mice were fed.
Food was refused on the 33rd day and the chick became very excited,
jumping out of its box, head bobbing, wings flapping and using its feet
to hold food and tear up paper on the cage floor. It fed of its own accord
for the first time on day 42. A few days later a large water bowl was
placed on the cage floor into which it leaped almost immediately. There-
after it remained in or around the bowl most of the time.
By day 48 the chick required no further heat. When it could perch
confidently, it was moved to a large flight on day 81.
The juvenile bird sported yellow, turning to grey, down until it was
replaced by the adult plumage.
As described above, the Brown Fish Owl Ketupa zeylonensis has been bred by
Paignton Zoological and Botanical Gardens and this is believed to be the first success
in this country. Anyone knowing of a previous breeding in Great Britain or Northern
Ireland or of any other reason that would disqualify this claim, is asked to write to
the Hon. Secretary.

BREEDING THE BANK MYNAH Acridotheres ginginianus
AND THE COLETO OR BALD STARLING Sarcops calvus
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.876475722222222" page_id="56953790"  page_num="8" year="" vol="">
By R.F, RAYNER (London)
My collection consists chiefly of starlings though in the past I have
kept lovebirds, seedeaters, small softbills, tanagers, etc., but as I work
seven days a week I find that it is easier to keep the larger softbills with
the limited time I have available.
I have been very successful with this specialised collection having
reared the Spreo Starling, Coleto or Bald Starling, Rothschild's Mynah,
Pagoda Mynah and Bank Mynah. Blyth's Mynahs, Pied Mynahs and
Purple Glossy Starlings have hatched but deserted after one to 10 days.
I have hopes for future success with Royal Starlings, Long-tailed Star-
lings, White-winged Starlings, Malabar Starlings, Dumonti's Mynahs, and
Amethyst Starlings.
I no longer use artificial light or heat and my new flights have only
a covered roof at one end with a drop of about 2 ft (0.61 m). Water
is pumped through all the flights from a pond 8 ft (2.44 m) in diameter
and 3 ft (0.91 m) deep. This saves work and ensures that the birds always
have water, even in freezing weather. All the birds survived last winter
which was very severe (except a sick Coleto) with no ill effects and indeed
this year (1985) I have had my best breeding season.
Breeding the Bank Mynah
This bird comes from the plains of Northern India and looks very
much like the Common Mynah and indeed the two species are often
found together, though the Bank Mynah is more a bird of the open
countryside and spends less time scavenging around human habitation than
the Common Mynah. It chooses to live near rivers and nests in colonies in
banks and cliffs over running water.
It is 9 in (0.22 m) long and the sexes are alike. The top and the sides of
the head are black and the entire body plumage is slaty grey except for a
pinky beige patch on the abdomen. The wing is black with a pinkish
beige patch at the base of the outer flight feathers, and a similar patch is
at the tip of the black tail.
My pair of Bank Mynahs were obtained in 1981 from a dealer who
assured me that they were an 'unknown species' and that a well-known avi-
culturist had seen them and could not identify them. I travelled 150
miles to his establishment to be presented with two completely plucked
birds, only their wing feathers and a few body feathers being present. I had

a strong suspicion that they were Bank Mynahs but was assured that the
aforesaid aviculturist would have recognised that species. However, several
months later and after a lot of care, I had two beautiful Bank Mynahs!
They were housed in a flight 8 x 8 x 3 ft (2.44 x 2.44 x 0.91 m) with a
nest-box measuring 18 x 8 x 8 in (0.45 x 0.20 x 0.20 m) placed lengthwise
at one end of the flight which was well planted. Their diet consisted of
fruit, mynah pellets, mealworms and a homemade softfood mixture.
Although in the wild these birds nest several feet underground in
river banks, I was unable to duplicate this although the entrance to the
nest-box is through a 4 x 2 in (0.10 x 0.05 m) pipe. The birds laid their
first eggs in 1982 but removed them and placed them undamaged on the
floor at the opposite end of the flight. I placed these eggs under Spreo
Starlings but did not succeed in hatching them, or the eggs of subsequent
years until this year. Two eggs were again removed whole from the nest

eaten. The other was placed under a pair of Spreo Starlings. This pair
consisted of a known hen that was at least 10 years old and a bird that I
had bred in 1984 that I had hoped was a cock. There were already three
eggs in the nest and on 17th July the parent birds were seen feeding. On
18th July the nest-box was checked and two chicks were seen. Obviously
I had a pair. On 21st July one chick was thrown out. As the other chick
had not fledged by 9th August ( 22 days) and my Spreos fledge between
16 and 20 days, I checked the box and saw that the chick was a Bank
Mynah. Two days later it had still not come out, so I checked the box
again and it came out (24 days).
The chick was very much duller than its parents, looking 'dusty'; the
orange skin on the eye was hardly visible and the pink wing flash very
insipid.
Mynah parents seem to feed only mealworms and crickets which I
cover in a calcium-based supplement, and on the seventh day I worm the
chicks by dusting the crickets with an anthelmintic powder. Since follow-
ing these procedures, my success rate with softbills has greatly improved.
The foster parents of the Bank Mynahs had another round and reared
two young of their own with the young Bank Mynah still in their flight.
It seems no reverse imprinting had taken place as they had no trouble
in rearing their own young. I have obtained another Bank Mynah which
I hope to pair with my home-bred bird.
I have only found one record of a previous breeding of this species and
that was at London Zoo in 1909.
Breeding the Coleto or Bald Starling Sarcops calvus
This species comes from the Philippine Islands and I understand that
there is a slight variation in size from one island to another. As with most
starlings the sexes are alike. There is an excellent plate of this species by
H. Gronvold in the Avicultural Magazine of 1906 (pp. 191-192) showing
the very characteristic ruff raised.
I obtained a pair that had been surgically sexed from a dealer in the
winter of 1983/4 but the hen, which had never been a healthy bird, died
in the following winter; no attempt at nesting had been made during 1984.
In March 1985 I was fortunate enough to be present when two hens
belonging to Mr. Raymond Sawyer were surgically sexed, and he kindly
let me have one. He had had it for several years and it seemed to be
different from my cock bird, being larger with slightly more silver on the
neck.
The two birds were placed together in a flight 12 x 3 x 8 ft (3.66 x
0.91 x 2.44 m), covered at one end where there is a nest-box 16 x 8 x 8 in
(0.40 x 0.20 x 0.20 m) with a 2 in (0.05 m) entrance hole. The floor is

of earth, covered with grass,- and there is a small conifer at one end.
Knowing the aggressive reputation of these birds, I was slightly appre-
hensive at the introduction but no attacks were seen. The cock bird
immediately began to strip the conifer of all its leaves which, in fact, killed
it. Both birds then began to tear the grass from the ground, pulling it out
by the roots, ignoring hay and canary nesting material. The cock seemed
to do most of the nest building and the box was filled to the entrance
hole. I saw no mating take place but after about two weeks the cock bird
remained in the nest box for hours at a time and during the following 10
days I only saw the hen enter the box once. From their behaviour, I came
to the conclusion that perhaps I had two hens. On 21st April I checked the
box and there were three eggs which were blue speckled at one end.
Though I was convinced that both birds were hens, two days later two of
the eggs were ejected and both were fertile.
On 24th May, eggshells were seen in the flight and the cock bird was
seen taking mealworms into the nest. The hen rarely went into the box,
and I estimate that the cock did 90% of the feeding. I gave the birds

mealworms, crickets, fruit, softfood mix and mynah pellets but only
live food was fed to the chicks during the first week. I had several nests
of softbills at the time and on 30th May a handful of well-cleaned maggots
was added to about 2 lbs of mealworms and fed to all my birds with
young. The following day a dead Coleto chick was found on the aviary
floor. As this is quite a common occurrence with softbills, no significance
was placed on this. The cock bird continued feeding so I knew that there
were chicks still in the nest. The following day the hen was on the floor
unable to fly with no control over her head or wings. I realised then that
the cause was probaby botulitis which I had heard about but not pre-
viously encountered. The cock bird seemed unaffected, although he
showed signs later, and I decided to remove the chick and the hen. The
hen remained incapable of feeding itself or even moving for seven days.
Although there is an antitoxin, which I managed to trace three days
later, I was told that it must be given within 24 hours of the symptoms
appearing. I had treated the hen with aluminium hydroxide which was
supposed to 'mop up' the toxin and I was assured that the toxin would
leave the system provided that I could keep the bird alive. I force-fed it for
seven days and on the eighth day it recovered completely.
In the meantime, the chick that I estimated to be about six to seven
days old showed no signs of poisoning but as a precaution I started dosing
it with aluminium hydroxide. I could find no guidance as to dosage but
after three days the chick's droppings were very loose and I stayed up all
night worrying. I stopped giving the aluminium hydroxide. The chick was
fed crickets and mealworms covered in the calcium-based supplement. It
would not gape but I found out accidentally that sneezing caused it to
gape, so I faked sneezing for two days before discovering that whistling
gave the same result! The crickets had to be completely dewinged and
delegged before feeding. I fed on demand, which seemed continuous,
starting at about 6 a.m. and finishing at midnight. The bird was kept in the
house in the airing cupboard at a temperature of about 70*F, transported
to work surrounded by tissue and with a hot water bottle, and placed in a
hospital cage set at 80*F during working hours.
At seven days old the chick was naked but the pink head could be seen
clearly; growth was rapid and the wing feathers were beginning to show at
11 days; by 21 days the bird was fully feathered. I introduced minced
beef and apple at 15 days. As I have lost several chicks with gape worm, I
dosed the bird at 15 days with a suitable anthelmintic. Although the chick
seemed to be developing very well, I was slightly concerned that at 20 days
it still remained on its hocks. I ground up two calcium lactate tablets
which I mixed with its food. At 22 days it was perching perfectly, and at
28 days it was feeding itself. I continued to offer it mealworms which it

took from my hand with no fear but about three weeks later it refused
them and stayed away from me, becoming increasingly timid; it is now
completely wild when approached. This is in complete contrast to the
other softbills that I have bred which seem to get tamer the more contact
is made. Since then, two further Coleto chicks have reacted in the same
manner and although I have kept them in 2 x 2 x 4 ft (0.61 x 0.61 x 1.22
m) cages, they remain completely wild.
After the hen had recovered, I replaced her with the male and on 28th
July the cock bird was seen feeding. This time the parents successfully
reared two chicks which left the nest on 25th August. The young are the
same colour as the parents and although slightly smaller, and the silver ruff
less pronounced, the feathering does not look very juvenile. The chicks
were removed on 11th September. On 18th September the nest-box was
checked and two eggs were seen. On 3rd October, the behaviour of the
parents aroused my suspicions and on checking the nest-box I found two
dead chicks.
It seems that if compatible, these birds will nest several times a year
and should be readily established in captivity. Because of their aggressive
nature, I would recommend that they are best kept in a flight by them-
selves. The young Coletos began to fight at about two months old and are
now housed singly.

BREEDING THE CRESTED WOOD PARTRIDGE
or ROULROUL Rollulus roulroul
AT THE PADSTOW BIRD GARDENS, CORNWALL
By ANDREW OWEN AND RICHARD HUGHES
</sectionHeader>

The Crested Wood Partridge, also known as the Roulroul Partridge, is
probably the most attractive member of its family. The male is dark blue
on the breast merging to green on the back and its most outstanding fea-
ture is its white crown and upright red crest. The female's plumage is
mainly green with grey head and rich chestnut wings. The legs and feet of
both sexes are reddish. Both sexes are about 10 in long (25.4 cm).
It is found in tropical forests and bamboo thickets up to 3,000 ft
(914 m) throughout Sumatra, Bornea, Thailand peninsular and Malaya
(King and Dickinson, 1975).
A pair of these birds is housed in the Tropical House here at Padstow
Bird Gardens. Other ground-dwelling birds in the Tropical House include a
pair of Northern Jacanas, Black-winged Stilts, Golden Heart Doves and a
Spur-winged Plover.
The diet for the Crested Wood Partridges consists of insectile food,
chopped fruit, cress and live food (maggots, mealworms, crickets); they are
also given Haith's Java Dove Mix. They spend most of the time foraging
among the leaf litter for insects and other invertebrates, and are particu-
larly fond of large house spiders. Constantly calling in a soft mellow
whistle, they are seldom apart.
During the spring (1985) the Plover and Stilts were removed from the
Tropical House to an outside flight as they were showing signs of aggres-
tion towards the other ground birds. Shortly afterwards the Partridges
began to nest.
The female dug a scrape under a low fern. The male would carry root-
lets and leaves towards the scrape, turn, and throw them over his shoulder
where the awaiting female would place them around her, forming a dome-
shaped nest (a characteristic of this species). The nest was finished within
two days. Mating was observed once prior to nest-building.
The female began to sit once the nest was complete. Once inside the
nest she would place dead leaves and plant fibres over the entrance to con-
ceal herself and to make the nest less conspicuous. It was not until six days
later that the clutch of three white, almost round eggs were seen. On the
rare occasions that the female left the nest to feed she would replace the
plant matter over the entrance, quickly returning at the slightest distur-
bance in the Tropical House. The male apparently took no part in the in-

cubation of the eggs.
After a further six days the female deserted the nest due to some un-
known disturbance. The eggs were left in the nest for several hours, but as
the female did not return they were removed and placed in a small Cur-
few incubator at a temperature of 99-100*F.
The eggs hatched after a total incubation period of 17 days. The eggs
began pipping at approximately 8.0 a.m. and hatched at 3.15 p.m.,
7.15 p.m. and 2.30 a.m. respectively. Upon hatching the chicks seemed
uncomfortable at the above temperature so it was lowered to 97*F.
The chicks were covered in chocolate-coloured down and were ex-
tremely vocal, continually calling to one another. They dried out after
about four hours and by this time were very active, therefore a cardboard
wall was put around the incubator to prevent them from escaping.
The chicks were given their first feed 12 hours after hatching. This con-
sisted of tiny stick insects and very small pinky maggots. These were fed
from a pair of tweezers gently tapped on the ground in front of the birds.
We had to persevere before they finally accepted the food. A shallow con-
tainer of water was placed in with the chicks which they drank from
readily.

For the first day they were fed at hourly intervals as very little food
was taken at each feed.
The youngest chick died within a day of hatching due to unknown
causes.
The two remaining chicks progressed well and began to accept food
more readily and the distance between feeding times was, therefore,
lengthened to two hours. At this stage a shallow dish containing chopped
cress, hard-boiled egg and maggots was provided, though very little interest
was shown in this.
The temperature in the incubator was now reduced by a few degrees
each day.
All went well for the next two days until the legs of one chick started
to splay. We tried to correct this by covering the floor with a damp cloth
in the hope that this would improve its condition. Unfortunately, it deter-
iorated and at five days old was very weak and unable to stand and sup-
port its head; it was, therefore, destroyed.
The remaining chick continued to thrive and at seven days old the wing
feathers started to appear. At night the chick was very restless and was
constantly calling so a cardboard box was provided for it to roost in. This
did not completely solve the problem so we tried putting a small furry toy
(of similar size) into the box. This seemed to do the trick as the chick was
much quieter and more contented.
By 11 days old its wings were larger, it had the beginnings of a tail and
was growing rapidly. At this stage it was removed to a box cage measuring
3 ft x 1 ft x 1 ft (0.92 x 0.31 x 0.31 m).
A week later the chick was still growing well, measuring about 6 in
(0.15 m) and was a reasonable flier, capable of flying die length of the
room. By this time it was feeding on its own although still accepting
maggots from the tweezers.
At 20 days some green feathers began to appear on its rump and back,
and some silvery green feathers were also seen on the breast, thus we had
the first indication of its sex (a female).
After a few more weeks, the chick became too large and active for the
cage, so it was then removed to a larger indoor holding flight.
During the next three months she gradually attained adult plumage. By
this time she was feeding on an adult diet. Although remaining tame, the
young Partridge has not become imprinted as we first feared.
This was the first breeding of this species in the Gardens and we hope
for more success in the future.

BREEDING BEHAVIOUR OF CRESTED WOOD PARTRIDGES
IN CAPTIVITY
By G.W.H. DAVISON

The wariness of tropical rainforest pheasants and partridges, as well as
their densely vegetated habitat, has greatly restricted studies of the wild
birds. Observations in captivity have correspondingly had more importance
in understanding their behaviour. The Crested Wood Partridge Rollulus
roulroul is one such species, being one of the few partridges of tropical
evergreen forest to breed rather freely in captivity. Data presented here,
from observations of captive birds, show that this species has unique
behavioural adaptations, notably in relation to breeding. These adapta-
tions are in strong contrast to the behaviour of similar-sized temperate
game birds.
Crested Wood Partridges are patchily common in lowland and hill
evergreen dipterocarp forest, in the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra and Borneo.
The sexes are highly dimorphic in plumage (Robinson and Chasen, 1936)
but not in size, both weighing around 280g. Nesting in the wild has been
described by Ogilvie (1949) and by Coomans de Ruiter (1946); other
details of the species' behaviour are given by Robinson and Chasen (1936)
and by Medway and Wells (1976).

The following observations were made on 10 pairs, variously accom-
panied by their offspring, at the National Zoo, Kuala Lumpur. Each pair
was kept in visual, but not vocal, isolation, in cages ranging from 4 m 2 to
90 m 2 . Behaviour of individual birds within larger flocks was observed in
captive groups of up to 12; wild birds were also observed ranging from
solitary individuals to large flocks.
Pair bonding
Mean group size in the wild was 2.67 (average of 60 sightings), ranging
from one to 13 birds. The commonest sighting (27 times) was of an adult
pair, followed by sightings of singletons. All birds in wild flocks keep in
contact through continual soft chirping, but normally distinct pairs are
discernible within the larger group. This is evident when flocks are dis-
turbed and split up into their constituent pairs, or when on occasion a
flock cautiously crosses a forest trail pair by pair, or when in a foraging
group each pair feeds slightly apart from the remainder. Most often simi-

lar numbers of males and females make up the flock, but occasionally
there is a strong bias: once a flock of 12 males was seen.
Pair formation within a flock takes place when a male begins courting
a particular female. A large part of this activity consists not of displays, in
the sense of postures having a special visual impact, but of 'cutting-out'
movements, by which the male attempts to isolate a female from the rest
of the group. In particular he continually interposes his body, with lowered
head, whenever the female approaches another male, walking parallel
by her side and sometimes touching.
Throughout pair formation and the subsequent bond, much play is
made of the rapidly vibrated tail which in this bird is short and down-
wardly directed. Once the pair is formed, the male generally follows
wherever the female leads, and it is she who performs the majority of tail
shaking.
Displays
Through pair formation and thereafter, the male and female spend
their time in close proximity, whether moving about or resting. Much of
the time not spent in foraging is devoted to preening. In the male, active
and jerky movements of the head while preening the upper and under sur-
faces of the body and wings, switching rapidly from one part of the body
to another, make the deep red crest very conspicuous. Whether these
preening movements are ritualised to a point at which they have display
function is an arguable point.
Much more typical of partridge displays is a stretched lateral posture.
The male, standing usually alongside the female and parallel to her,
straightens his legs so that his body is raised up. There is little accompany-
ing change in feather posture, but a major effect of the display is to em-
phasise the red legs.
Courtship feeding or tidbitting is very common, when the male picks
up any piece of food, especially animal food, and twitters until the female
comes and takes it from his bill. Sometimes he twitters and adopts the
head-forwards posture without holding anything, and if the female res-
ponds she pecks preferentially at the red patch on the male's bill.
Two other displays bear no parallel amongst game birds. On occasion
the male will run just behind or alongside the female and, as soon as she
pauses, will put his head under her breast, abdomen, or under tail-coverts
and press upwards. This can only be understood in relation to the beha-
viour of the chicks described later. Sometimes too, while running along-
side, the male will crouch, lower his head and beg with open bill while
twittering. Although all males performed this display, no female was ever
seen to respond by giving the male food.

G.W.H. DAVISON - CRESTED WOOD PARTRIDGES
Nest-building
Both sexes participate in building the nest, using sideways-throwing
and sideways-building techniques. One bird will enter the chosen nest
space and sit there while pulling in leaves from within reach, tucking them
down the sides of the body. It will, after a time, emerge and walk away
from the nest throwing leaves or twigs backwards over its back. As this
bird emerges, its partner enters the nest and begins sideways-building. Thus
in periods of intense activity there is a continuous cycle with one bird in
the nest and one walking away, only to switch places as the nest occupant
emerges. Entry into the nest and turning within it form the central nest
chamber, while the high level of activity results in a large mass of leaves
forming a complete dome.
This system should encourage similar levels of participation from the
two sexes, but in fact males generally expend more time building than
their mates. Females cease sideways-throwing sooner while walking away,
and more often miss out their turn to enter the nest. On average males
put about twice as much time into nest building as females do, as the
following figures show.

Chick behaviour

The most noticeable feature after hatching is the great care paid by
both parents to the chicks. This is manifested in various ways.
After hatching the brood splits between the parents. If only one
chick hatches from a clutch it is tended by both parents (not always to
an equal degree), but in larger broods about half go to each, and each
parent restricts its care very largely to its own set of young.
The chicks take food mainly from the attendant parent's bill for the
first few days; the parent picks up a fragment, and may call, whereupon
one or more chicks peck at the held food. This behaviour gradually
declines in favour of the chicks picking up food for themselves at scrapes
made by the parents. At the same time chicks learn to scrape for their own
food, beginning within the first week of life, and at least by the eighth
week most food comes by this means. Nevertheless, depending on the
behavioural state of the parent, odd items may still be obtained from the

parent's bill even up to six months old, when the young are full-sized and
in adult-like plumage.
Gaping for food occurs, and this exposes the skin within the mouth
which is bright yellow in the chick (but pink in the adult). A gaping chick
crouches slightly and lifts up its widely open bill while cheeping. Although
this behaviour was seen many times, on no occasion did either parent place
food within the chick's mouth. But it seems logical to suppose this does
sometimes happen, otherwise the behaviour seems pointless and is difficult
to account for. It would be difficult too to explain the evolution of the
colour signal within the chick's gape. Gaping is not a common behaviour,
though every chick performs it, and it becomes positively rare after the
fifth week.
Chicks in less active periods solicit brooding from their attendant
parent; the female responds more often than the male. Brooding is soli-
cited by a chick walking under the parent and pressing upwards with its
head, back and lifted wings, exerting pressure by straightening the legs as
well as wing lifting. This pressure seems to induce the brooding response
(crouching) in the parent. As the chick grows it is less able to burrow
beneath its parent and upward pressing is done mainly with the head,
inserted under the parent's breast, abdomen or tad-coverts.

These observations raise some general points about the reproductive
behaviour of the species. Chick care is multifaceted, and exceeds that
known for any other galliform. The male parent takes an equal share in
the breeding cycle as a whole; although he does not incubate he expends
time and energy in courtship feeding, which is a direct input of nutrients
to the female and hence to the eggs she will lay.
Gaping by chicks is quite unknown in other galliforms. It is worth
further observations to see whether this ever does stimulate the parent to
place food within the chick's mouth. Stable division of the brood between
the two parents has also not been reported for other species. The amount
of food-finding by the male, and the amount of brooding he performs, are
unusual features. So too is his heavy role in nest building.
The level and type of chick care are of interest again in relation to the
displays of the adult male. Tidbitting is widespread, perhaps universal
among galliforms, and is thought to be a ritualisation of parental feeding
(Stokes and Williams, 1971). But in the Crested Wood Partridge two other
displays are related to a similar phenomenon. Gaping by the male, and his
insertion of the head beneath the female, are almost identical to gaping
and brooding-solicitation by the chicks. Though ritualisation of parental
behaviour to form displays is a common occurrence, the ritualisation of

chick behaviour into courtship is unique to the present species.
These observations have some relevance to the captive breeding of
tropical galliforms. It is common practice to increase output by removing
and artificially incubating first clutches or all clutches. This process is
very effective when applied to temperate zone species. But the Crested
Wood Partridge is an extreme example of the general truth that tropical
game birds have more elaborate chick care. Artificial incubation deprives
the chicks of this care, and a long term strategy for their captive breeding
might be to leave eggs with the parents. This would result in lower produc-
tion rates but better care of chicks, and chicks with broad social ex-
perience. Such parent-reared chicks are themselves more likely to be com-
petent breeders in future.

I apologise for putting a &amp;apos;Latin 5 name in the title but, unfortunately any
possible English name for the group is also the specific name of one of its
members.
Introduction
The partridges of the genus Alectoris are perhaps best typified by the
Chukar A. chukar and the Red-legged Partridge A. rufa , one or other of
which is likely to be familiar to most of my readers. To those to whom
they are not, Fd better say that they are a shade larger and more robust in
build than the Common Partridge Perdu perdu or Indian Grey Partridge
Francolinus pondicerianus and about a third larger than a Bob white Coii-
nus virginianus.
They are all extremely beautiful birds, characterised by having red bills
and legs, red or pink orbital skin around the eye, a distinctive face, neck
and throat pattern in white or cream and black or (one species only) grey
and chestnut, strikingly barred flanks and the upperparts some shade of
brown, fawn or grey without any markings other than, in some species, a
broadly laced pattern on the scapulars. Most have chestnut outer tail
feathers. The sexes are alike except that the males are rather larger and
usually have wart-like 'spurs' on their legs, although it is said that some
hens have these and certainly in A. rufa some cocks do not. The juvenile
birds are very different in colour and pattern, being much more like
Perdu .
They are all closely related and similar and under natural conditions are
either completely allopatric or, where two forms do appear to overlap 'on
the map' they are usually known or believed to be separated by living at
different altitudes.
Some authorities have treated the Chukar, the Rock Partridge Alectoris
graeca and the Large Rock Partridge or Przewalskf s Partridge A, magna as
members of a single species. However, Watson (1962) gave what seem to
be valid reasons for treating them as separate species, although he perhaps
over-emphasised some of the slight plumage differences. In any case most
writers now treat these as three species and it is preferable to do so unless
proof to the contrary turns up.
The Black-throated Chukar or Philby's Partridge A. phi! by i is also
sometimes treated as a race of A. chukar but, like Harrison (1982) I con-

sider it best given specific rank.
The three remaining species are the Arabian Partridge or Arabian Red-
legged Partridge A. melanocephala , the Barbary Partridge A. barbara and,
perhaps most beautiful of all these exquisite birds, the Red-legged Part-
ridge, long (but perhaps not to be much longer!) familiar as a successfully
introduced species in central-eastern and south-eastern England.
Alectoris is a very distinct genus. Its nearest relatives are probably the
sand partridges of the genus Ammoperdix and, more distantly, the much
larger and duller snowcocks Tetraogallus.
The Alectoris partridges inhabit rocky, rather arid, and usually hilly or
mountainous areas, with a preference for warm, south-facing slopes. Some-
times in places with bush or tree cover but not in dense woodland or flat
open country far from any cover. Like most other gamebirds that live on
hills or mountains, they tend to walk or run uphill away from man or
other predators but in emergency to fly downhill. Their flight, like that of
most gamebirds (and ground-living pigeons) consists of alternate periods
of violent wing beating, interspersed with long glides. They are not so
completely terrestial as the Common Partridge Perdix perdix as they often
perch on rocks, walls, dead trees, buildings, etc.
Some, and perhaps all of these partridges have the habit, unique among
gamebirds so far as is known, of both cock and hen of the pair sometimes
or usually incubating a nest of eggs. If feeding and other conditions per-
mit, the hen lays two 'clutches' of eggs or, to be more precise, she lays
about half of one large clutch of 15, 20, 28 or more eggs in one nest and
the others in a second nest. She starts to incubate on the second nest when
it is full and, when she does so but not before, her mate returns to the
first nest and starts to incubate the eggs there, if they have not, in the
meantime, been discovered and eaten by some predator. If they have been,
or if the hen lays only one nestful of eggs before beginning to sit, the cock
joins up with other males who also have no eggs to sit on. In some cases, at
least for some species, cocks are said sometimes to re-join their mate and
her chicks when the latter are partly grown. In other cases, and usually
with the Red-legged Partridge at least, a brood of chicks is reared by
mother or father alone
This behaviour is well documented for the Red-legged Partridge in
England, both in captivity (Goodwin, 1953) and in the wild (Green, 1981
and 1984; Jenkins, 1957). It is said (Cramp et al, 1980) sometimes to
occur in the Rock Partridge, although Menzdorf (1983) says there is no
evidence for it in this species. Cock Chukars have also been known to
incubate nests of eggs and rear chicks in captivity (Portal, 1924) and a
cock with a brood patch has been shot in the wild in the Aegean Islands
(Wettstein, 1938). Menzdorf dismisses male incubation in this species with

the statement that possibly occasional males may incubate deserted
clutches (verwaiste Gelege). This seems to be unlikely because, on 'selfish
gene' principles, such behaviour could hardly be selected for unless he
incubated only clutches deserted by his own mate. Even if he did, it
would be a risky business as the commonest cause of nest desertion is
because the sitting bird has had a narrow escape from a predator, who
might well have 'better luck next time' if the deserter's mate took over.
I think those who, like Menzdorf, doubt the occurrence of male incuba-
tion in these partridges under natural conditions, may be unduly influ-
enced by having had captive males that did not incubate when given the
chance. However, it is well known that female ground nesting gamebirds
(and also ground nesting pigeons!) very often nest and lay but refuse to
incubate under captive conditions. So it should cause no surprise if under
captive conditions some male Alectoris partridges fail to incubate their
mates' first nests. That any do so argues cogently, in my opinion, that the
habit is (under appropriate conditions) normal to them. As the Heinroths,
with their incomparable experience of bird keeping, pointed out (I think
in their classic book Die Vogel Mitteleuropas but am not sure of this),
when speaking of nest site selection by drakes, the fact that a bird does
not perform some piece of behaviour in captivity is no proof that it never
does so in the wild but the performance of any complex piece of repro-
ductive behaviour in captivity is proof that it is part of the species' reper-
toire in its wild state.
My own opinion is that it will ultimately be found that, where feeding
conditions and other circumstances are favourable, the hens of most or all
Alectoris lay two nests full of eggs, one of which the cock incubates when
the hen has begun incubation on the second, but that in many circum-
stances the food available, the amount of time available before incubation
must begin if the young are to be reared successfully, or other factors, pre-
clude the hen from laying more than one 'clutch'. Possibly (but this is a
mere guess) if the hen is killed when she has laid several eggs but before
she has begun to incubate, the cock will then incubate these eggs, at least
if there is not an unmated hen around to distract him from them.
So far as I am aware, there is little or no evidence for male incubation
or, for that matter, any detailed studies on breeding behaviour in the other
species. A cock Barbary Partridge (Debeno, 1933) incubated the only nest
of eggs that his mate produced but as she took a surprisingly long time
about this, perhaps he realised that the eggs would not keep much longer
if not sat upon. After incubating for some time, he attacked his mate
fiercely but when she was removed sat peacefully again and was a model
father to his chicks.

on this interesting subject.
Notes on the species
The Chukar
This is the most widespread and almost certainly the most abundant
species. It is also more easily, or perhaps one should say even more easily
kept and bred in captivity than its congeners, in which state it has almost
certainly been kept as early as the Bronze age (Watson, 1962). It is found
from eastern Greece (Thrace) and Crete through Turkey, Syria, Lebanon,
Sinai, Iraq and Iran, Afghanistan, northern India and nearby areas through
much of central Asia to north-eastern China. It has been introduced as a
'sporting bird', for the pleasure of those who enjoy killing beautiful, sen-
tient creatures (unfortunately a much larger and hence more powerful
number of people than those who enjoy watching birds or keeping them),
to many countries and appears to be well established in parts of the
western United States and in New Zealand. It has also been introduced
into various parts of England, about which I shall say more further on in
this article.

The Chukar inhabits a wide, or at least fairly wide range of habitats,
typically on or near rocky hillsides, mountain slopes or valleys, ranging
from the snow line, or just below it, down to hot deserts. Sometimes in
clearings in forest or in open, grazed woodlands with some rocks or
boulders. It is said (Cramp et at) also to inhabit open plains and flat
desert but I suspect it only does so where there is some rocky ground or
scrub fairly near.
In describing this and the other species I shall here give only the main
features and not attempt a detailed description. When describing feathers
I shall ignore the fluffy basal portion of the feather that is not normally
visible and not repeat the description of the bill, legs and orbital skin
which have already been given. As with many other birds, especially those
that have subtle pastel shades, no words and few paintings or photographs
can give an adequate impression of the extreme beauty of these birds. The
fit and living bird must be seen at close quarters for this to be fully appre-
ciated. This is not always easy as, because more people shoot partridges
than want to look at them, they are almost everywhere much afraid of
man in their wild, or feral state.
The Chukar 5 s upper parts are predominantly olive brown to pale
pinkish fawn, more or less shading to pale grey on the crown, neck and
rump. The sides of the breast and the scapulars are pale bluish grey with
broad pinkish fawn, mauvish pink or salmon pink borders to the feathers.
The front of the breast is pale grey, the belly and under tail covert huffish.
The face and throat pattern (see sketch) is black surrounding dull cream or
dingy off-white, often with a dusky smudging or speckling in the cream
colour at the lowest point (the pale part) of the bib. There is a tuft of
hairy reddish brown feathers over the ear openings and a conspicuous
white or greyish white stripe above and extending beyond the eye. The
outer tail feathers are pale chestnut. The barred feathers on the flanks are
pale bluish grey at the base, then come two rather narrow black bands
with a wider buff or cream band between them (see sketches) then a final
and narrow fringe of dark chestnut.
The above is a generalised description. Many geographical races of this
species have been named on usually rather small differences of shade of
the upper parts and the width of the buff band on the flank feathers. In
general, Chukars from hot, arid regions are paler and pinker in colour (and
in my eyes, therefore, more beautiful) than those from less arid regions.
They also bleach even more quickly and the differences due to plumage
wear can be very striking Indeed. I have handled and examined many
museum specimens, collected when moulting, in which the new feathers
on the back are deep olive brown and the old ones that they are replacing
are a very pale dusty cream colour. Every British bird watcher who takes

note of the common birds (and that is far from every BBW, I fear) knows
how our Mistle Thrush Turdus viscivorus, when in fresh plumage in early
autumn, has dark olive brown upperparts (slightly paler and more greenish
on the rump) and a deep golden (dark-spotted) breast which, by the fol-
lowing May, have usually become, respectively, pale dingy greyish and
white. The Chukar's usual colour changes are similar and just as great.
There are two very nice colour pictures of the Chukar in Jonsson (1982)
a good colour photograph in Nicolai (1982) and some excellent 'action
photos' of captive birds performing various displays in Stoke's paper on
the species' behaviour.
From what I have read, the voice and displays of this species would
appear to be very similar but not identical to those of the Red-legged
Partridge (Goodwin, 1953,). A most noticeable possible difference is that in
the threat or sexual display in which the Red-legged Partridge 'twists its
face round' in a remarkable way, the Chukar would appear to do so to a
relatively very slight extent, if at all. At least so it seems from Stokes's
pictures and descriptions and so it was on the only two occasions that I
have seen this display from a Chukar. In one of these the bird was dis-
playing at and being displayed back to 'in kind' by a Red-legged Part-
ridge and I had both birds 'in my binoculars' at once. Presumably the more
elaborate throat and upper breast pattern of the Redleg is relevant here.
The only calls I have heard from Chukars (feral birds in Kent) were the
rally call and the 'steam engine' call and both of these sounded to my ears
similar to but more husky and guttural than the 'same' calls of the Redleg
(which I heard the same day).
The Rock Partridge
In appearance this bird is very similar to the Chukar, differing only in
minor point of face pattern (see sketch), in having a pure white or greyish
white (not creamy) throat and more prevailingly grey upper parts. The
bars on its flanks look finer and a little brighter, the cream or buff band
between the two black bands is narrower and the chestnut tip broader
than on the corresponding feathers of most Chukars. The bill is propor-
tionately a little smaller and, although I have not seen a live Rock Part-
ridge, I think it might appear a little more delicate in shape.
The calls of the two are said by some authorities (e.g. Watson) to differ
greatly but by others (e.g. Menzdorf, Cramp et al) to be similar. Not
having heard Rock Partridges I will not venture a personal opinion on the
matter but hope that some of our readers will have kept both and can
enlighten us.

the Red-legged Partridge in the south-western Alps but the two appear

normally or always to inhabit different areas, the Rock Partridge breeding
at higher elevations. Watson found evidence of similar altitudinal separa-
tion where the Rock Partridge and the Chukar appear to overlap geogra-
phically in Thrace and in eastern Bulgaria. He found no evidence of inter-
breeding and no hybrids or intergrades among the many specimens he col-
lected. On the other hand Nicolai states definitely that the two hybridise
in this region and treats the Chukar as a race of the Rock Partridge 'weil es
(the Chukar) . mit ihn (the Rock Partridge) bastardiert .' Menzdorf
quotes Russian sources that claim a hybrid zone exists at some eastern
fringes of A graeca's range and that captive-bred hybrids are fertile.
The Rock Partridge is found in mountainous regions from the western
Alps east to Thrace and Bulgaria and south through Italy and Sicily. It
mainly inhabits dry, rocky areas between tree-line and snow-line, mainly
in fairly open areas which include heathland, open sparse woodland, scrub
and pastureland. It prefers south-facing slopes and sunny places generally.
It is a permanent resident where found. In hard weather it may enter barns
or other buildings in search of food (Menzdorf). It appears to have de-
creased and/or to be (or still be) declining over most of its range. The de-
terioration of the climate in the more northerly and western parts of its
distribution, the decrease of old farming methods (in the Alps), and the
ever increasing predation on it by sportsmen have all been suggested as
possible factors. I will discuss further in this article the widespread intro-
duction of the Chukar into parts of its range.
According to Watson the Rock Partridge is less easy to keep in captivity
than is the Chukar. Two aviculturists quoted by Raethel et al (pp. 268 and
269) both state that the Rock Partridge is less lively (lebhaft) in captivity
than the Chukar but one of them implies that it is equally easy to keep.
Both make the point that whereas the Chukar is widely imported, sold and
bred on the Continent, the Rock Partridge is rarely available from dealers.
Taking a long term view I don't think the future looks over bright for the
Rock Partridge although perhaps not so black as that for the Red-leg.
The Large Rock Partridge
This species has a relatively restricted range in eastern Asia, being found
in parts of eastern Tibet and western Kansu. Its range appears to overlap in
places with that of the Chukar (Harrison, Watson) but they are believed to
be altitudinally separated with the present species normally found only
above 1.500 m (Harrison).
It is slightly larger than the Chukar and the details (fine details!) of its
face pattern are closer to those of the Rock Partridge. The dark band
around the pale parts of its throat and face is dark reddish brown, margined

with black along its Inner edge.
Watson thinks, probably correctly, that it is most closely allied to the
Rock Partridge, which must (if this is the case) formerly have had a much
more extensive range. Watson suggests that the Chukar must have origina-
ted from a population of Rock Partridges which became isolated some-
where in the Himalayas or the Middle East and developed qualities that
enabled it later to spread and supplant its parent form, the Rock Partridge,
throughout most of the latter's former range.
In view of the obvious political, geographical and other obstacles, it
seems unlikely that any readers of this article, even those living in 'the
USA, so vast, so friendly and so rich 5 (as the poet W.H. Auden justly des-
cribed their country) will have had any personal experience with A, magria
but if any have, I hope they will inform us in the pages of our magazine.
Philby $ s Partridge
This species is very similar to the Chukar and Rock Partridges but a
shade smaller and with a more tawny tinge to the greyish brown parts of
its plumage. Its most striking difference is the entirely black face and
throat (see sketch). It also lacks the laced pattern on the scapulars which
are uniform greyish drab like the back. When the Chukar and the Rock
Partridge were generally thought to be conspecific, this bird was often put
as a race of A. graeca. However, this is not feasible (at least not in our
present state of knowledge, or lack of knowledge about it). If A. philbyi
ever came into contact with A. graeca or A. chukar , its very different facial
pattern might, as in all probability it does between A , philbyi and the
Arabian Partridge A. melanocphala, act as an isolating mechanism.
Philby's Partridge is found only in south-western Arabia, from Taif
south to the Asir mountains. It overhaps geographically with the Arabian
Partridge but is said usually to occur on more densely bushy slopes and at
higher altitudes. However, much more study needs to be done on these
two species in the wild (and hopefully, for details of voice and behaviour,
on tame birds in aviaries). I have not read of Philby 5 s Partridge having been
imported into other countries. Perhaps it's being less beautiful than the
Chukar, and less strikingly different from the latter species than is the
Arabian Partridge, has been In part the reason for this.
The Arabian Partridge
This species is appreciably larger and proportionately longer-tailed
than other members of the genus. The difference In size between the sexes
also appears, so far as one can judge from museum skins (I have not seen
the living bird), greater than in other Alectoris.
The top of its head Is black, merging into dark reddish brown on the

give, at least if slightly erected, a crested and 'bearded&amp;apos; impression in life.
There is a beautiful colour plate of the Arabian Partridge, by our late
member Mr. David Reid Henry in Meinertzhagen's Birds of Arabia, The
general coloration is a very pale brown and pale grey. The scapular feathers,
and to a lesser extent many on the mantle, back and sides of the breast are
pale bluish grey, bordered with pale fawn. The flank feathers are pale
bluish grey banded with cream bands which are bordered by narrow black
bands (see sketch). The black top to the head makes the white stripe over
the eye, a striking feature of all but one of the Alectoris species, perhaps
even more conspicuous in this bird.
The Arabian Partridge is found, in suitable habitat, from near Mecca in
western Arabia south to Aden and east to Oman. The populations in the
northern and eastern Hadramaut average a little paler in colour and are
usually given subspecific rank under the name A. melanocephala guichardi.
Like its congeners, this species frequents rocky hills, valleys (wadis)
and, it is said, also upland plains. Little seems to have been recorded of
its behaviour. Meinertzhagen says it is 'probably polygamous' but gives no
evidence for this opinion. It was bred with some (but not very much) suc-
cess in captivity in Devon in 1927 and the fact recorded in our magazine
(Seth-Smith, 1928). I have seen the skin of a captive-bred hybrid between
this species and the Chukar. It is a relatively dull bird, lacking the full
beauty of either parent and with (surprisingly) a dull greyish throat and
lower face.

The Red-legged Partridge
I consider this bird even more handsome than its congeners, with the
possible exception of the very pale and pinkish desert race of the Chukar
which is found in parts of Syria and Sinai. Perhaps I am biased because as
a very small child I was enchanted by a description, and later an excel-
lently coloured toy model, of the North American Robin Moth, which has
rather similar rich but harmonious colour combinations, and because I
later kept Red-legged Partridges myself. I described my experiences with
this most beautiful and endearing bird in an earlier issue of our magazine
(Goodwin, 1954).
The Redleg is a warm olive brown on the upperparts (but can bleach to
a light dusty greyish brown in worn plumage) with a wine-red tinge on the
neck and upper breast. The lower face and throat are pure white, encircled
with black, this black surround 'running into 3 the lower throat and sides of
neck in a kind of beautiful necklace-like effect. The lower breast is rich
bluish grey, the belly deep reddish buff. The barred flank feathers are
more richly coloured than, and differ from those of all other Alectoris in
having only one black cross band. Each feather shows bright bluish grey,
then a pale cream band, bordered only on the outer edge with black, then
a wide terminal band of deep, bright chestnut.

Partridge A. rufa, and (c) Arabian Partridge A. melanocephala.
Key: Shaded areas black; lined areas bluish grey; stippled areas chestnut; unshaded
areas cream or buff. See text for full description and specific differences in shades of
these colours.
The Redleg occurs naturally in southern France, the Iberian Peninsula,
and a limited area of northern Italy, possibly also in Corsica, though it is
just possible that it may have been introduced there as in Madeira and
some of the Canary Islands. As recently as the 16th century it occurred
further north, breeding in southern Germany (Nicolai). Around 200 years
ago it was successfully introduced into England and is now (but see com-
ments further on) widely if rather patchily distributed in eastern and

southern England. Though preferring, when available, the sort of habitats
already described for its congeners, It also breeds successfully in more or
less flat agricultural country although, unlike the Common Partridge, sel-
dom in extensive fields or meadows unless these are diversified with some
small hills, old quarries, raised banks, heaps of stones or gravel or similar
features.
Varying numbers of geographical subspecies have been recognised by
various authors, mostly on minor differences. In general, the populations
from southern Iberia are darker than those from further north.
The Barbary Partridge
This species differs considerably from the others in the colour and.
pattern of its head and neck. A broad, chestnut brown, blackish edged
stripe runs along the top of its head from the base of the bill to the hind
neck. The broad stripe over the eyes, the lower face and the throat are
light grey, and there is a large patch of dark or light (according to race)
chestnut, spotted with white, on each side of the neck. The flank barring
is very like that of the Chukar and Rock Partridges.
The rather elongated head feathers and the head pattern both suggest
that this form may be more closely related to the Arabian Partridge than
it Is to the other species.

There are photographs, and delightful sketches illustrating its displays
and some other postures, in the paper on its behaviour by de Reyna and
Alvarez, and there are good colour drawings in Jonsson.
The Barbary Partridge is found from north-western Africa east to
coastal eastern Libya (see Harrison for distribution map) and has been
introduced to some of the Canary Islands, Gibraltar, and probably also
to Sardinia and to Porto Santo.
Some comments on the Chukar in Britain and Europe
People and organisations concerned with bird conservation in Britain
appear to regard gamebirds (pheasants, partridges and grouse) as outside
their field of interest. There are good, or at any rate expedient reasons
for this, which I do not propose to discuss here. Not surprisingly perhaps,
most 'rank and file' birdwatchers have taken the cue from 'their betters'
and subscribe to the view that these beautiful creatures are not, and
should not be , of any concern except to those who enjoy killing them.
Hence, although those in authority in such matters are now generally
'dead against' the introduction of any foreign species of bird or beast (to
such an extent that a most eminent person has felt it necessary to write
apologetically because he has enriched our avifauna and our lives by intro-
ducing a harmless and beautiful bird) no hint of criticism has been voiced
against the extensive introduction of the Chukar. It, of course, was not
introduced for aesthetic, sentimental or other such despicable reasons but
for the improvement of 'legitimate sport', a most commendable aim in the
view of our masters.
Both Chukars and Chukar x Redleg hybrids are said to have been
widely introduced but all the references I have seen have given little or no
detailed information. One writer (Lever, 1977) states that the Chukar is
established on part of the South Downs and that the Rock Partridge is
established in Scotland. This latter I find hard to believe and wonder (in
view of Continental statements about the rarity of the Rock Partridge in
trade) if there has not been misidentification.
My own personal knowledge of the Chukar here has been mainly of the
species in a part of Kent. Here both I and others have seen numbers in the
past three years. A birdwatcher friend of mine, not knowing of the Chu-
kar's introduction, had not separated the species from the Redleg and was
astonished, after I had told him how to do so, at finding it the more
abundant of the two in some (but not most) parts of the places he visits.
I saw two pairs of Chukars in the spring of 1984 and no Redlegs (in the
limited area I covered) although there were apparently pure Redlegs there
in the following autumn. This spring, on 5th March (1985), I saw mutual
threat display and other interactions that gave me the impression that the

birds were regarding each other as conspecifics. This appeared to be con-
firmed on a later visit, on 2nd May, when I saw in all four pairs of Alec-
toris, two of which were two Redlegs, and the other two pairs each of a
Chukar paired to a Redleg.
About eight years ago an ornithologist who then lived in Andorra told
me that there, and in adjacent parts of northern Spain, the long-continued
releasing of Chukars by the sporting fraternity had resulted in extensive
interbreeding and (my informant was a bird artist) he found it impossible
to obtain phenotypically pure Redlegs locally for his illustrative work.
As early as the 1950s I was told that Chukars and Chukar x Redleg hy-
brids had been widely introduced in southern France.
Thus it looks as if the Redleg may well be threatened in Britain and in
its native haunts as well. Since the Chukar will either interbreed with or
compete with it. On present, but so far very scanty, evidence, it seems that
interbreeding is more likely.
I am not one of those who are against all introductions and if we did
not have the Redleg here already, I would have no objections to the intro-
duction of the Chukar. As it is, however, the Redleg having so much smaller
a world range and being already fairly well established here, I do not think
it was justifiable to introduce the Chukar, and deliberately to introduce it
into precisely those areas where the Redleg was established and moderately
common.
It appears (Menzdorf, Nicolai) that the Chukar has also been widely
introduced into the native range of the Rock Partridge. It is perhaps even
more likely to interbreed with or supplant this species, though from an
aesthetic point of view the loss would be less, as the Rock and Chukar
Partridges are so similar in appearance whereas the Redleg differs in many
features. However, the sportsmen will do what they want and if they fi-
nally decide that the Chukar really is a 'better sporting bird', the Rock
Partridge and the Redleg, and perhaps later the Barbary, Philby's, Arabian
and Large Rock Partridges, will be deliberately replaced by it.
It is to be hoped, but not expected, that some aviculturists will be
able to conserve pure stocks of the other Alectoris species if and when this
happens, or rather in anticipation before it does.
I would, incidentally, be most grateful if any knowledgeable reader can
give us a description of the Chukar x Redleg hybrids. All I have seen in
the wild have appeared 'pure' Redleg or pure Chukar 'in the binoculars'
but I have not, of course, been able to examine them critically in the hand.

The Cape Siskin Serinus totta is also known as the Totta Siskin , Siskin
Canary and Rock Canary. It is a shy and unobtrusive species and usually
occurs in pairs or small groups of up to 15 birds.
The canary-like song is soft and pleasant with a similar flight call to
that of the Yellow-eyed Canary Serinus mozambicus. The male has the
crown and nape light brown streaked darker brown; mantle, scapulars and
wing-coverts slightly russet earth-brown; rump olivaceous yellow; sides of
face and ear-coverts yellowish brown; underparts dull olivaceous yellow;
white tips to wing and tail feathers diagnostic for both sexes; eye brown;
bill brownish, paler below; legs and feet pale brown. The female differs
from the male in having the underparts lime green; throat and breast
olivaceous yellow, throat streaked brown. Juveniles have the chin to chest
and upper flanks streaked with dusky.
This siskin is found in the western Cape Province of South Africa in
the northern Cedarberg to the Great Kei River. It lives in bushes and scrub
in mountainous regions, in exotic pine plantations and sometimes occurs
along the coast.
The diet includes graminoid seed, archenes, foliage buds, fresh floral
parts, nectar and animal matter. A summary of food genera recorded in
the diet of this species: Urticaceae (nettle family); Chenopodium

matter was unidentified (Milewski, 1978). Barnicoat (1983) reports that in

captivity it will take a seed diet supplemented by green food; egg food
and soaked seed is suitable for rearing with a daily supply of spinach beet,
endive, chickweed and seeding grass heads, and it is extremely partial to
niger seed. Aviary observations have revealed the taking of termite alates
during nesting, also Khaki weed Alternanthera pungens , Canary creeper
Senecio tamoides and Pepperweed Lepidium africanum.
During nesting three to five plain white eggs are laid in a shallow cup
which is fairly well-built of fine dry grass and rootlets, lined with finer
grass, maidenhair fern, wool or some hair. The furry down of protea has
also been recorded as a nest lining. The nest, the cup of which has a
diameter of 5.1 cm and a depth of 2 cm, is placed on a rock ledge, or in a
hollow rock, often concealed by low shrubs growing out of the cliff face.

Steyn and Myburgh (1980) record a nest in the hole in the trunk of a large
tree at 3.6 m from the ground. In captivity it prefers to utilise a nest-box
and may use dried lettuce, watercress and chickweed as nesting materials
and coir or seedheads as lining. The nest building is carried out by the
female with the male accompanying her on collecting trips. Only the
female incubates, for 16-17 days, with the male feeding her at the nest.
Both adults remove faeces from the nest during the whole nestling period.
The young leave the nest at 20-24 days, and are fed by both parents by
regurgitation.
When they leave the nest, immature birds can be sexed with a fair
degree of certainty as males are more yellowish on the throat and breast.
Adult plumage is acquired some three months later. One parasite egg,
which was found to be infertile, belonged to the Red-chested Cuckoo

Cuculus solitarius. It has been suggested that the cuckoo may have mis-
taken its host's nest as being that of the Dusky Flycatcher Muscicapa
adusta.
Hybrids between this species and a male Oriental Greenfinch Carduelis
sinica, Cape Canary Serinus canicollis and Black-throated Canary Serinus
atrogularis have been recorded.
The Drakenberg Siskin Serinus totta symonsi, or, to give it its alterna-
tive names, Mountain Siskin or Brown Canary, is a less attractive subspecies
that differs from the typical totta mainly in respect of its basic colouring.
Males lack the white-tipped secondary and tail feathers of the Cape Siskin.
The female is duller and browner below by comparison with S. t. totta. It
occurs in western Natal, Orange Free State and north-eastern Cape, pro-
vinces of South Africa, Transkei and the mountains of Lesotho. Little is
known of its feeding habits in the wild except that seeds, buds, insects and
the soft bases of Erythrina flowers form the diet. In captivity the birds will
accept the same basic diet as S.t. totta with the addition of Black-jack
Bidens pilosa, Bird grass Poa trivialis , Small Canary grass Phalaris minor
and the buds of Smeltersbossie Flaveria bidentis. Egg colouring differs
from totta being white to pale greenish blue, sparingly spotted with grey
and brown mainly at the large end. The incubation and nestling periods
for the wild and in captivity are unrecorded.

TAKING CARE OF A VISUALLY IMPAIRED BLACKBIRD

Turdus merula
By Dr. M.A. SCHLEE
(Museum of Natural History, Paris, France)
A male Blackbird was found as a fledgling in the French department of
Hauts-de-Seine in June 1975, hand-reared and named 'Koko'. The bird was
given to me when he was about 45 days old, and was then used in a study
on the development of prey-attack behaviour in Blackbirds (Schlee, 1983).
From the second year on, Koko was free-ranging in the Insectary green-
house (7.5 x 3.5 x 3.5 m) which he claimed as his territory; he also made
frequent excursions into the adjoining rooms of the Insectary in search of
insects and spiders. At the age of seven years, Koko had a traumatic
experience which terminated in total blindness. This paper will recount
how he was able to adapt to his infirmity and be successfully maintained
in his usual environment for several months before being caught by a
stray cat on 10th October 1982.
Events leading to blindness
Blackbirds are known to be highly territorial and aggressive (Snow,
1958; Hambly, 1966), but until the end of December 1981, the garden
birds had never engaged my Blackbirds in territorial combat. At that time,
however, a juvenile male had just established himself in the garden sur-
rounding the Insectary. The two birds fought nearly every day, pecking at
each other across the glass panels and roof of the greenhouse. In doing so,
Koko was apparently rubbing and hitting his eyes against the glass, the
impact of which was sufficient to provoke the formation of a cataract in
each eye.
During the last week in February 1982, Koko's flight and feeding
behaviour had become noticeably abnormal. After a violent fight on 3rd
March, Koko showed signs of cerebral trauma and received veterinary
attention; I then learned that a cataract had formed in the right eye which
had been so damaged that it was no longer functional. By 22nd March a
cataract had formed in the left eye, but some peripheral vision still re-
mained: Koko was able to visually follow side-to-side hand movements
executed at a maximum distance of 0.72 m, but only in the lower half of
the frontal visual field. Since the left eye was stHl functional, visual capa-
bilities were able to be increased by applying eye-drops for dilating the
pupil. It is difficult to say when Koko lost all sight, for there were no
major changes in behaviour. A routine check of the peripheral visual field

carried out during August revealed that Koko was completely blind at
that time.
Phase 1/Loss of sight in right eye
Some of Koko's abnormal behaviour patterns were probably due both
to brain damage and to the progressive formation of a cataract in the left
eye. During this period, Koko was highly unco-ordinated and often went
through bouts of stereotyped pecking movements directed into the bowl
of commercial feed, but none of the food was touched. Other abnormal
behaviour, such as flying in a circle around a point before trying to land
or walking into obstacles, was also noted. In addition, there was a clear
lack of accuracy in seizing insects regardless of their mobility, and Koko
always gave several initial pecks to either side into the void. The typical,
alternated monocular fixation movements were retained, but as soon as
the insect came into the visual field of the right eye, Koko either walked
on it or left. There was also a sharp drop in foraging behaviour: Koko
spent most of the day perched in the same place with his good eye direc-
ted toward the entrance; he no longer went into the Insectary in search
of insects, nor did he dig in the compost pile on the far side of the green-
house. In fact, his movements were restricted to about one-fourth of the
space available. During this time Koko seldom sang and seemed tired and
listless. He also started becoming highly fearful and aggressive; when
approached, he backed up a few steps and then launched a defensive
attack.
Phase 2: Peripheral vision in left eye
The first striking change in behaviour was the abrupt loss of all acti-
vity, including feeding. Koko spent four days at a veterinary clinic where
an energetic treatment was undertaken to try to favour the resorption of
the cataract. During his stay, he succeeded in locating half a hard-boiled
egg and half an apple placed in his cage, but no attempts were made to
eat either insects or commercial feed. Since Koko did not eat enough to
maintain correct body weight, I force-fed him with meat, insects, a
vitamin supplement and Glucidic Trophysan (Laboratory EGIC, Montar-
gis, France). The latter substance, containing all necessary amino acids,
had to be diluted in order to avoid the bird choking on it. Whenever I
manipulated Koko, he would suddenly go limp and play dead (head
falling forward, eyes closed); but as soon as I released my grip, he at-
tacked my hand or retreated. Since the tail feathers were fanned and
depressed in a typical threatening posture, Koko generally walked on
them and had difficulty maintaining his balance while backing up; at
that point he always attacked. The same behaviour was shown when

Koko was entirely blind.
When Koko was brought back to the greenhouse, he was placed in a
small cage (0.58 x 0.26 x 0.37 m) equipped with a median horizontal
perch and a diagonal one extending from It. The cage was installed next
to the usual feeding site. Koko was caged for safety reasons: the sudden
loss of sight provoked uncontrolled, unoriented escape behaviour and
general signs of panic. Koko acted as if the sudden darkness was due to
external factors which could be overcome through escape manoeuvres.
It is interesting to note that the same type of behaviour was always
elicited when Koko was enclosed in a box for transportation purposes;
there was a very close correlation between the waning of this behaviour
and the resumption of self-feeding.
The first step was to teach Koko to locate food in his cage. Half a
hard-boiled egg and half an apple were always available and were placed
in the same spot; these items were quickly discovered. But prey items
(mealworms, crickets and cockroaches) had to be small enough to be
able to be swallowed with a minimum of handling. To make, it easier
for Koko to find them, I used a small pottery bowl that had an opening
of 4 cm and a depth of 2 cm and attracted Koko's attention by tapping
on it with my finger. Since Koko always vigorously pecked at my hand,
it was quite easy to deflect his pecking movements to the dish of insects.
If Koko dropped an insect on the ground, he relocated it by tilting his
head in such a way as to use his peripheral visual field; but even so, he
could only determine the approximate direction and always gave several
haphazard pecks before finding the insect. I was also able to train Koko
to take mealworms directly from my hand: I had to hold the insect in
such a way that a forward pecking movement would immediately estab-
lish contact with it, and I always first called Koko by name.
By 29th March 1982 Koko's general behaviour and his weight were
returning to normal and I started letting him out of his cage for a few
hours every day. At that time he occasionally bathed, sang, flew to the
opposite side of the greenhouse and even sunbathed under the rafters.
From 7th April on, Koko was once again free-ranging in the greenhouse.
The next step was to teach Koko to locate food placed at his usual
feeding site. Two half apples impaled on wooden spikes and half a hard-
boiled egg were lined up next to each other; Koko had no apparent
difficulty locating them. The small pottery bowl was also aligned and
firmly fastened into the ground; I attracted Koko s attention by tapping
on the bowl. At this signal Koko always rushed to the dish site, tapped
from side to side with his beak until he located the bowl, then tapped
the rim before pecking into it. By 13th April, Koko no longer tried to
fixate the insects by cocking his head from side to side. However, it

took until 16th May for Koko to learn how to eat his usual commercial
feed (Sluis' feed for insectivorous birds) and this seemed to have been
facilitated by changing the type of dish.
Before Koko became visually impaired, he always ate from a heavy
glass receptacle (11 cm diam., 4.4 cm deep) by perching on the rim and
then leaning forward to seize the feed. After losing his eyesight, Koko
continued this behaviour but with one basic difference: the distance
that he leaned forward was fixed and was insufficient to allow him to
touch the feed even if the dish was full; apparently he never tried to
eat from a standing position. I finally found a dish that allowed Koko to
touch the bottom when leaning forward from a standing position. (In
this case he never tried to perch on the rim.) The receptacle was oval in
shape (12.4 x 5 cm), had a total height of 4 cm, but because of its raised
bottom, was only 2.7 cm deep. Within one week Koko had perfected his
feeding techniques, but he always remained incapable of seizing the
morsels - his beak was used as a shovel and whatever feed entered it was
swallowed.
Spatial orientation was probably facilitated by the layout of the green-
house: along the front (divided into two equal parts by the entrance and a
cement passage leading to the back rooms) and along the sides, there is a
built-in, cement shelf, 96 cm wide, located at about 74 cm from the
ground. This structure is filled with dirt and contains tropical plants.
Nearly all of Koko's manoeuvres took place on this platform in an L-shaped
area approximately 2.86 m across the front and 1.76 m along the side,
which included the usual feeding and bathing sites. Koko's itineraries
followed the walls of the greenhouse and the ledge of the platform, and
included several cross routes and precise stopping points. When Koko
accidentally stepped over the ledge, he generally flew back to his starting
point; however, if he landed on the ground, he often retreated into a
corner and I was obliged to recover him. Koko also used the space between
the platform and the roof and had several precise perching sites: the main
one was an overhanging branch located about 2 m from the ground and
out about 57 cm from the ledge. In order to orient himself, Koko darted
from one side of his feeding site to the other, touching the plants and the
flower pots, toward the back where he came into contact with a small
wooden footstool, then out to the edge of the platform. Flight-intention
movements were shown at each stopping point. When the direction of the
branch seemed to be located, Koko flew forward; if he missed it, he
immediately returned to the platform and repeated the orientation move-
ments.

Phase 3: Total loss of sight
Blindness did not modify the behaviour that had developed during the
period of peripheral vision in only one eye; however, Koko's level of
activity always remained low. Body weight was maintained throughout
this period, and moulting was carried out correctly. In order to get Koko
to eat insects, I continued to put them in the small pottery bowl or to give
them to him direct. In the latter instance, I always called Koko by name
and continued talking to him while quietly approaching; any sudden noise
provoked intense panic. I then gently touched the tip of his beak with the
insect and held it in front of him; Koko only pecked straight ahead even if
he missed the insect. During this phase Koko never dropped a prey item on
the ground. All insects were slightly mandibulated and, if necessary, re-
oriented in the beak for swallowing. When locating the drinking bowl, Koko
stopped at a short distance from it and tapped with his beak; as soon as he
struck the rim, he slipped his beak along the inner side until he touched
the water.
Orientation from the ground improved with time: when Koko was in
the middle of his half of the greenhouse, he gave many flight-intention
movements in the direction of the platform while running back and forth
between the steps near the entrance and his starting point. In this way he
was apparently able to determine his position, and when he finally flew
up, he landed on or near the wooden footstool behind the bathing recep-
tacle; nonetheless, his occasional excursions to other parts of the green-
house were not so well-oriented.
Koko spent a lot of time at one of the screen windows where he could
'survey' the garden, as he did every year before becoming blind. Inside the
greenhouse a piece of glass had been leaned against the screen, leaving a
space of about 15 cm. Koko was well-acquainted with the route leading to
and from the window. At that time I did not realise the potential danger
of such a set-up. A stray cat must have noticed that Koko did not react to
its presence and took advantage of the situation by tearing off part of the
screen. No feathers were found near the window, so I assume that Koko
played dead as he usually did when I picked him up. The first trace of
contour feathers was found at more that 15 m from the greenhouse. Koko
had managed to escape from the cat and was found several metres further
away, but he was too seriously injured to survive. Judging from the cut
marks around the beak, Koko must have become panic-stricken (probably
by the sound of the screen being ripped off), and, instead of leaving the
window by his usual route, must have persistently jumped against the
screen (1cm wire mesh).

<bodyText confidence="0.999760780487805" page_id="56953831"  page_num="45" year="" vol="">
The only effective way of stopping the fights with the garden Blackbird
would have been to cut off visual contact. Wire netting on the outside of
the greenhouse was not sufficient, for the captive bird continued tapping
against the glass during its attacks and, therefore, considerable portions
of the glass panels were whitewashed. In a similar situation, it is vital that
these measures are taken at the first sign of agonistic behaviour. The
comers under the rafters are particularly dangerous if there is a support on
which the captive bird can perch, for from this position the bird can rub
its eyes against the glass when turning in circles trying to peck at the feet
of its adversary.
When I first released Koko in the greenhouse during phase two, I
thought there would be no more problems with the garden male since
Koko could not see him. However, as soon as the young male landed on a
narrow ledge located at the level of the cement platform, Koko mshed to
the spot and resumed fighting. Auditory cues probably alerted him to the
presence of his rival, for the young male gave the strangled song while ag-
gressively displaying. These panels were also whitewashed and, in addi-
tion, a wire grating was placed on the outside in such a way as to prevent
the young male from landing on or near the ledge. The garden male also
fought with the sbc-year-old, hand-reared male whose breeding success in
captivity was previously reported in this magazine (Schlee, 1981 and
1982). Their fights also took place across the glass panels of the green-
house which, in turn, had to be whitewashed. In addition^these two birds
fought at the screen window and across the netting of the aviary when the
roof of the greenhouse was open; but the garden bird never fought with
the adult male offspring of the established nesting pair although they were
housed in adjacent aviaries.
Several points concerning the care of a blind bird should be empha-
sised. First, the bird should be left in Its usual environmental setting and
all objects should be maintained in their respective positions. This allows
the bird to use locational information that was acquired before going
blind. In the case of Koko, general topographical orientation was probably
aided by the presence in the greenhouse of a number of smaller avian
species whose behaviour could have provided additional locational infor-
mation. Secondly, it is rather difficult to get the bird to eat correctly once
the initial traumatic reaction has been overcome. Although apples and
hard-boiled eggs seem to be easy to discover during haphazard movements,
special steps must be taken to train the blind bird to locate dishes of food
and to associate the receptacle with a particular food item. Koko was easy
to train since he already had the habit of attacking my hand; his attacks
could, therefore, be directed toward a dish in which he could discover

something to eat. Once this discovery has been made, the bird can be
trained to approach at a given signal (e.g. tapping the container). The size
and the shape of the feeding dish are also very important. Thirdly, long
distance orientation improves with time and partly depends on auditory
cues. Koko was finally able to move about in a little less than half of the
greenhouse and quite visibly listened to sounds coming from the open
windows, the door, the sink, etc. All major routes were quite stereotyped,
and Koko was able to go rapidly to his feeding site from any point in his
restricted territory. However, objects at close range were always located
and identified by systematic tapping with the beak.
Koko's successful re-adaptation clearly shows that the Blackbird is
capable of topographically orienting itself by using sensory modalities
other than vision and of forming a cognitive map of its spatial environ-
ment.

THE BIRDS OF CHENGDU ZOO
PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA

On 25th September and again on 8th October 1985, I was escorted
round the zoo in Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province in China. The
zoo is in the suburbs of the city (of 1.4 million people, with another seven
million around). It moved there from a downtown site in 1976. At its
earlier location, the zoo dated back, however, only to 1953. I was twice
shown round by the assistant director Madame Song Yunfang, and met the
director Mr. He Guangzin, The total zoo staff is 260 persons. On the
second visit I was accompanied also by Zheng Junfan, an ornithologist from
the Biology Department of Sichuan University. Apparently the zoo
receives two million visitors a year, each one paying 20 feng, le. about 7
U.S. cents.
I was told there were about 100 species of birds kept at the zoo. The
following, is my attempt to outline the establishment&amp;apos;s bird population,
with special attention to the pheasant and crane families.
No less than six species of crane were present. There were four Sudan
Crowned Cranes Balearica pavonina from Africa, and five east Asiatic
species. These were: six White-naped Cranes Gms vipio , four Hooded
Cranes G. monacha , three Demoiselles Anthropoides virgo, five Red-
crowned Cranes Gms japonensis , and four Common Cranes G. gms . The
zoo had sent its two Black-necked Cranes G. nigricollis elsewhere; one to
Beijing zoo, the other to the zoo at Sining (the capital of Tsinghai pro-
vince).
I specially asked about Phasianids and was told that the following
species were present at the zoo; most of them I saw myself:

There were only a few individuals of each species.
On or by the zoo's large lake were two Mute Swans Cygnus olor, and
21 adult Whooper Swans C. cygnus , plus seven young Whoopers hatched
earlier in the year at the zoo. There were half a dozen Eastern Greylags
Anser anser mbrirostris, two White-fronted Geese A. albifrons , six Swan
Geese A. cygnoides , one Bar-headed Goose A. indicus, two Shelducks
Tadoma tadoma and one Ruddy Shelduck T. ferruginea, a dozen Man-
darins Aix galericulata, a few Mallards Anas platyrhynchos, a few Wigeon
A. penelope , a Pochard Ay thy a ferina and at least one presumed Scaup
A. marila. There was one Coot fulica atra and three Black-tailed Gulls
Lams crassirostris. Two Oriental White Storks, birds of an eastern form
held by some to be a separate species, Ciconia boyciana, were a pleasure
to behold. An albino Cormorant Phalacrocorax carbo was preening itself
alongside three Dalmatian Pelicans Pelecanus crispus.
In a large cage for water and waterside birds were three Black Swans
Cygnus atratus, four Spoonbills (sadly Platalea alba and not minor , the
scarce Black-faced species), three Sacred Ibises Threskiomis aethiopica no
doubt of the local race melanocephalus, three Little Egrets Egretta gar-
zetta, a Black-crowned Night Heron Nycticorax nycticorax and four Black
Storks Ciconia nigra. There were also six Black-headed Gulls Lams ridi-
bundus.
A flight cage for raptors housed a Golden Eagle Aquila chrysaetos, a
Pallas's Fish Eagle Haliaeetus leucoryphus , a Lammergeyer Gypaetus
barbatus, two Black Vultures Aegypius monachus and five Himalayan
Griffons Gyps himalayensis. Nearby were two large owls; I suspect they
were Eagle Owl Bubo bubo and Tawny Fish Owl Ketupa flavipes but am
not sure.
We come now to the more terrestrial and arboreal species. Exotic
parrots included one Rainbow Lory Trichoglossus haematodus , four

species of Amazona (one of each), and four Fischer's Lovebirds Agapomis
fischeri, and two species of macaw, the Blue and Gold Ara ararauna and
(probably) the Military A. militaris. There were two Lord Derby's Parra-
keets Psittacula derbiana. This species is indigenous to Sichuan and China.
Two ratites were the Emu Dromaius novaehollandiae and the Ostrich
Stmthio camelm.
Indigenous Chinese passerines on display included one Grey or Hima-
layan Tree Pie Dendrocitta formosae (a beautiful bird), two White-throated
and four Greater Necklaced Laughingthrushes Garrulax albogularis and
G. pectoralis , one Oriental Greenfinch Carduelis sinica, one White-rumped
Munia Lonchura striata , four Black-headed Hawfinches Coccothraustes
migratorius and two 'straight' Hawfinches C coccothraustes - half-a-dozen
Pekin Robins Leiothrix lutea, and 50-100 Zosterops, some at least being
Chestnut-flanked Whiteyes Z. erythropleura. There was a Rook Corvus
frugilegus , a Magpie Pica pica , three Red-billed Blue Magpies Urocissa
erythrorhyncha, ten White-cheeked Starlings Stumus cineraceus, and one
Crested Mynah Acridotheres fuscus javanicus. Thrushes included one
Magpie Robin Copsychus saularis, one Dusky Thrush Turdus naumanni
and one (apparently) Eye-browed Thrush T. obscurus.
I enquired about the three Sichuan endemics, the Szechwan Hill Part-
ridge Arborophila rufipectus , the Omei Shan Liocichla Leiocichla omeien-
sis and the Crested Parrotbill Paradoxornis zappeyi, but none was held in
the zoo.
The last bird I'll mention is the local Quail Coturnix cotumix japonica.
There were two or three at the zoo. This species had been domesticated in
China. I visited one Quail 'farm' where there were 80,000 birds, five
females to every two males. The males are used for breeding and sold for
meat. The females produce about 300 eggs in their first year and are then
killed for meat. The farm's output was 30,000 eggs a day or well over ten
million eggs a year. But the domestication of birds is another story, as is
the current role of wild birds-of-prey in Chinese traditional medicine.
Some of their avian stock the zoo no doubt get from the wild-bird
markets of the city and smaller outlying towns, several of which I visited.
To sum up. There were at least 86 different bird species in Chengdu
zoo in September-October 1985. I probably missed another 10%. Of these
86, 82 were positively identified; and of these no less than 28 (33%) are
on the list of wild birds for Chengdu and its environs (Zhang Junfan,
1985) and 60 (71%) are on the list for the province of Sichuan (Shi
Bain an and Zhao Ermi, 1982). By comparison with many western zoos
this must surely be a high percentage of 'locals'?
As a tailpiece let me mention the Turkey Meleagris gallopavo. Its

picture appears in the zoo guide and until early November 1983 there were
four birds. Two of these I am reliably told by a local American succumbed
to Thanksgiving! In 1985 I could find not two but none; but, of course,
there had been another giving of thanks in November 1984!

NEWS FROM LEEDS CASTLE

The late Hon. Lady Olive Baillie, who was a member of the Avicultural
Society, established world-famous aviaries at Leeds Castle some 30 years
ago and her enthusiasm brought many rare and varied species to the Castle,
and in particular she loved the Rosellas and Ring-necked Parrakeets. Since
her death the collection has been maintained and still includes many
interesting colour mutations.
The Leeds Castle Foundation, a registered charity, is now constructing
a modern and very extensive facility, next to the Culpeper Garden, to be
ready later this year, which we hope will establish Leeds Castle as the
home of one of the outstanding collections in this country and give as
much pleasure to our visitors as it did to Lady Baillie.
The aviaries are being built of stainless steel frames which will be
enclosed by removable panels of wire that will have no edges showing. The
frames are quite an architectural masterpiece with a Victorian style roof.
Each aviary will have a small pool of water in the front that can be
drained from the outside and will blend in well with the natural perches
and nest-boxes. The strings of rectangular aviaries between the hexagonal
flights will have slanted concrete floors with a drain at the back and will

be covered with rock and gravel. This will allow cleaning to be done from
the outside and provide proper drainage in inclement weather. Each
flight will also have an area at the rear that will serve as winter quarters,
should the birds require additional shelter. We feel that the design will be
clean and easy to maintain and should offer all the security necessary for
breeding as well as providing an attractive exhibition for the public.
A modern hospital, incubator room (with back-up power source),
proper food stores and kitchen are attached to the main block of flights.
The kitchen will be on public display so that food preparation and hand-
feeding may be observed.
We are designing educational tours for school groups and special
interest groups that will be centred around behind-the-scenes activities.
The centrepiece of the Lady Baillie Memorial Aviary will be the Aus-
tralian species that Lady Baillie was so fond of, but it will also include
many other types of birds, including macaws, Amazon parrots, cockatoos
and many softbills, as well as finches.
We have had much valued advice from the avicultural world, and in
particular Raymond Sawyer, Rosemary Low and Dr. James Dolan (Gen-
eral Curator for the San Diego Zoo).Everyone at Leeds Castle including
Peter Taylor, who has taken care of the birds at Leeds Castle for the
last 30 years, staff and the architects and engineers are very excited
about this project and are looking forward to its completion. We would
like to invite members of the Avicultural Society to visit us and hope

Having searched unsuccessfully for a mate for our single male Hyacin-
thine Macaw, in the spring of 1984 Bristol Zoo kindly offered to lend us
two females to see which took his fancy. When the weather grew warmer, I
introduced the new females but for 10 weeks our efforts looked in vain for
he took no notice of either female. We decided to send one female back to
Bristol Zoo, leaving us with a pair.
During that summer the pair sometimes sat next to each other but no
signs of breeding were seen. I was not too worried about this as it was their
first year together. Several other macaws were successfully bred, some of
them hand-reared. By the autumn we thought all breeding had finished
The day arrived when all the birds were to be dusted with Cooper's Louse
Powder to keep at bay any parasites picked up during the summer and by
midday the Hyacinthine Macaws had been reached. Both were dusted and
then I looked quickly (because these two were never the friendliest of
creatures) into the nest-box and to my amazement a two-week old chick
was sitting there! It was decided that, because we had disturbed the
parents and as the chick did not look too healthy, we would hand-rear it.
We managed to rear 'Golly' and also 'George' in 1985; now we have high
hopes for another success in 1986.
This was only made possible by co-operation between our zoos and I
would like to thank Geoffrey Greed, Director of Bristol Zoo, for the loan
of the Hyacinthine Macaw hen.
We have also had an example of co-operation between our birds here.
Five years ago we had four breeding pairs of Quaker Parrakeets in a flight
about 12 x 20 x 10 ft (3.66 x 6.10 x 3.05 m). One night a hole appeared
in the roof and one of the pairs was missing.
Traps were put out immediately but the parrakeets took no notice
mainly because our macaws are kept on barrels outside so the parrakeets
just stole their food.
Later on that year, after pruning a few twigs off the many trees
in the park, a nest 6 ft (1.83 m) in diameter appeared at the top of a pine
tree. Not only did the Quaker Parrakeets nest here, but squirrels, starlings,
sparrows and Bluetits also. Unfortunately this wildlife commune came to
a sad end because the weight of the nest after a storm pulled the tree
over to a 45* angle and we had to take it all away for safety reasons.
After that winter I was looking for some good nesting platforms for my

spoonbills when I had an idea. I put all the remaining Quaker Parrakeets,
plus great quantities of hawthorn twigs into the large spoonbill aviary. My
luck was in for that year the parrakeets built four massive nests and bred
prolifically. As hoped, these nests made perfect platforms for the spoon-
bills and the two pairs produced four young between them.
As the entrance hole of the parrakeets is always under the mass of
twigs, the two very different birds did not squabble at all!

The most popular aviary at Birdworld must be the Seashore Walk. This
aviary is about 60 x 120 x 20 ft (18.28 x 36.57 x 6.10 m) and in it is a
wave machine which was specially built for us and works by displacement
of water with a wooden wedge, driven by an electric motor. This produces
a wave about every three seconds. There are many tons of rocks and sand
to produce the effect of a beach with an old rotten boat to add the finish(TM)
ing touch. The birds housed here are Shags, Oyster-catchers, Inca Terns,
Curlew, Tufted Duck, Goldeneye, Spur-winged Plovers, Eider Duck and,of
course, gulls.
Our visitors seem to be mesmerised by the waves. We once made a sur-
vey at the exit of the Seashore Walk, asking people what birds they had
seen. Most of them could not remember two birds! The public are seen
just gazing into the moving water. Last year the Shags, plovers, all of the
ducks and gulls laid eggs so perhaps the waves help to make an environ-
ment as close as possible to their natural surroundings which is what every
aviculturist wants to achieve.

The Cape Parrot
Further to my letter on 'Sulking in Parrots, in the last issue (VoL 91,
No. 4), the pair of Cape Parrots Poicephalus robustus suahelicus (the
Central African subspecies) that I mentioned were sitting on four very
large, round eggs, have successfully reared four healthy young which are
now independent.
Several points have arisen that I find very interesting; firstly, all four
young have left the nest with a 1 in (2.5 cm) wide orange/pink band
across the crown of the head and with a pink blush through the other-
wise grey cheeks. They differ from the adults in not having the orange
colouring on their thighs and wing butts and otherwise resemble the
adult hen. The adult cocks have no colouring on the crown.
1 have read Rosemary Low's excellent article in our magazine in
Volume 88 (1982) No. 1, in which she gives a very detailed description of
the young of this species. I could find no reference anywhere to confirm
whether the young of both sexes leave their nest with identical colouring
(like that of the adult hen) but it would be too much of a coincidence that
these birds should all be hens.
11 find P.r. suahelicus to be a particularly pretty parrot and while some
have a very nervous disposition, this pair and their four young are all very
steady (possibly because the adults are tamed pet birds, and the young
follow their example). A second interesting behaviour pattern of the four
young birds was that all of them, or half at a time, would return to their
nest log sometimes for the whole day, for up to 10 days after leaving their
nest - unlike most South American parrots with which I have experience.
Thirdly, they nested in a log on the ground and were not at all interes-
ted in a natural log that was hung up. The pair tunnelled at ground level
into the log and continued to use this entrance until the young hatched
and with usage this entrance became blocked and they would then enter
from the partly open top.
Fourthly, I have a pair of P. suahelicus from Angola and they seem
generally duller thanP suahelicus from Zimbabwe where my breeding pair
come from and the hen from Angola has a much smaller patch of orange/
pink on the crown. They are not so attractive as their Zimbabwean
cousins.
Then finally, I have experienced, percentage wise, far more stress
sickness in Cape Parrots, more so in the South African form P.r. robustus
than in the Central African race P.r. suahelicus , than I have amongst any
other parrots that I have kept. All were cured except for one hen P.r. rob-
ustus, a tame pet bird that I lost. Of nine Cape Parrots in the collection,

five have been sick at one time or another.
I would suggest to anyone keeping these parrots that once they have
settled down, they should not be moved.
I find them very attractive, lively and most interesting parrots, and the
yellowish neck and darker back contrasting with the orange thighs and
wing butts of the South African race most attractive and very different
from the pinkish/orange crown and silver neck and light green back of the
Central African race.
25th February, 1986.
P.S. It is interesting to note that now the four young parrots reared are
over four months old and into their first moult, they have all lost the
orange cap on their heads and the flush through their cheeks that they had
when they left the nest, but two of them (presumed hens) are now grow-
ing a new batch of stronger coloured orange/red feathers on the crown of
their heads above the top mandible, similar to the adult female. The other
two (presumed cocks) have retained the plain silver head and neck of the
adult male.
I could find no reference in any book to the fact that the young of
both sexes leave the nest with this crown of orange which both sexes lose
after their first moult - when the young hens regrow the orange cap and
the young cocks retain a plain silver head and neck.
Breeding from hand-reared birds
As a breeder over many years of a whole range of birds, including lories,
I believe a statement by Rosemary Low in her most interesting article on
the breeding of the Tahiti Blue Lory (Vol. 91, Nos. 1 &amp; 2) that 'there
are still people who believe the myth that hand-reared birds are useless for
breeding purposes&amp;apos; needs to be analysed.
In my experience this would all depend upon the reasons for the
parents refusing to care for, or feed their young.
It is no myth and any serious breeder of domestic stock, whether it
be pigeons, bantams, budgerigars, canaries, cockatiels, etc., will confirm
that the young reared by indifferent parents or even if they are taken away
and reared by foster-parents, will, when mature, will make indifferent
parents themselves, thus confirming that such traits can be inherited.
Unfortunately these traits are continually passed on from one generation
to another because the parents may possess qualities essential for the show
ring. Poor parental characteristics include light-sitting hens, poor brooding
hens, erratic feeding of young and after flight care. This, however, would
not apply to the wild stock where their very survival depends upon good
rearing qualities and any imperfections would have been eliminated.
Birds in the wild select their own mates, but under captive conditions

incompatible pairs are often thrown together, inducing a weak pair-bond.
Incompatibility is not an inherited trait, and young hand-reared from such
a pair would have all the normal characteristics expected of them. The in-
compatible pair can be broken up and offered other mates and subse-
quently become perfect parents.
Again, many wild birds, after hatching their young, change their diet
completely and unless this stimulant to feed was provided under captive
conditions, you would get poor parental and feeding reactions. This is also
not an inherited trait, for with a change of diet, or presentation of the
food, this could be altered, and therefore young hand-reared from such a
pairing could be expected to have normal parental qualities.
The preference of some hand-reared birds for human company rather
than their own kind does sometimes pose further problems but this bond
can be eradicated or weakened by placing weaned young together, or with
their own kind, at an early age.
If the human contact continues through to maturity, then many more

Hardiness of a Twenty-eight Parakeet

In the first week of November 1985 my cock Twenty-eight Parrakeet
Bamadius zonarius semitorquatus ate his way out of his aviary and I did
not see him again until 19th February when I heard him calling in a tree
above a hen Port Lincoln Parrakeet B.z. zonarius. He disappeared for the
rest of the day and then reappeared in the evening of the next day. He was
around the aviaries all the afternoon of 21st February and on the morning
of 22nd February he went through the opening which I had made at the
top of the aviary next to the Port Lincoln hen and he went straight away
and fed her through the wire.
This bird was at liberty for approximately three months, latterly during
one of the coldest periods for many years, the temperature remaining
below freezing point for over two weeks.
As a postscript to this story, a fellow builder who lives a mile away
from me recently told me that he had been feeding a green and yellow
parrakeet on his bird table from November onwards but that it had now
disappeared. I had to tell him that it was my bird and I had caught it up.

A very large Indian collection
I recently heard from a friend in India, Dr. Mohan Patel, a member of
this Society, who sent a cutting from a newspaper, Gujarat Samachar,
dated 27th December 1985, recalling that the Indian Congress (now Indira
Congress), recently celebrating its centenary in Bombay, was founded by a
British citizen, Sir Allan Hume. The newspaper related that Sir Allan
Hume was a lover of birds and in the extensive garden of his house in
Simla he collected some 62,000 birds from different countries. I won-
dered whether any of our readers knows more about what must rate as one
of the largest avicultural collections ever?
Parklands, Shoulton, K. Dolton
Hallow, nr Worcester.
Ed. History books reveal that Allan Octavian Hume (1829-1912) worked in the
Indian Civil Service for some 30 years and on his retirement took up the cause of
Indian nationalism and founded the Congress which became and remained the chief
political party of the Hindus. They elected him their first Secretary, a post he held
until shortly before his death. He was an ornithologist with an international repu-
tation; he organised bird observation all over the country and wrote the first book
on Indian birds. I can find no mention of this enormous collection of birds at Simla.
Can anyone tell us more? And was this the Hume for whom the Bar-tailed Pheasant
was named?

BREEDING THE LITTLE BLACK BUSTARD
Eupodotis a fra

The Little Black, or White-quilled, Bustard, also known as the Black
Korhaan, is found in open grassland and amongst scattered trees and
bushes, thoughout the central, southern and western regions of Southern
Africa. Our pair of Little Black Bustards were acquired in February 1979
from a dealer and were adult on arrival. During the following three years,
spent in the 'Square' aviaries, they failed to nest and at the end of 1983
it was decided to rehouse the birds in a planted aviary, approximately
13mx4mx3m high, at the Tropical House.
On 13 th April, 1984, one egg was laid in a shallow scrape, no nesting
material had been used. This egg was removed to be artificially incubated
but was soon found to be addled.
A second single egg was laid on the same scrape on 8th May and left
for the female to incubate. The chick hatched on 28th May, but again,
since there was a real risk that it might drown in a small pool in the
aviary, the chick was taken for hand-rearing. Initially it was fed on crickets,
small locusts, white mealworms, chopped lettuce, egg and grit; water was
given in drops from a hypodermic syringe. Calcium/magnesium was given
daily to prevent bone deficiencies. All food items had to be offered by
means of tweezers as the chick made no effort to feed itself.
On the third day the chick became lethargic and failed to defaecate, a
problem not uncommon in hand-reared bustards. One ml. of liquid paraf-
fin was administered and a day-old Lady Amherst's Pheasant Chrysolophus
amherstiae was caged with the chick in order to improve its feeding and
exercise. The Bustard improved over the ensuing 24 hours and soon began
to feed from the dish. The pheasant chick was removed after a few days.
At six days the wing quills were growing fast and by the fifteenth day
the chick was quite well covered. It was able to spend some time outside
on warm days. Small pieces of cooked, minced chicken and liver heart, and
lumps of mice were now added to the diet.

<bodyText confidence="0.99498419047619" page_id="56953856"  page_num="62" year="" vol="">
On the 19th day the chick began refusing food from the dish and
would only take an occasional cricket from the tweezers. This continued
for six days, after which it was completely independent of the tweezers
and feeding well once again from the dish. The young bird became unex-
pectedly nervous and on day 59 was moved to a planted aviary at the
Tropical House. At six months old it still bore immature plumage though
it was 'barking' like a male.
A third egg was laid on 13th June in a scrape barely a metre from the
original. This egg hatched on 2nd July, the chick was again removed for
hand-rearing but died at 16 days. A post mortem examination revealed
an acute enteritis.
A fourth egg was laid in the same scrape on 23rd July and hatched on
13th August. It was decided on this occasion to allow the adults an oppor-
tunity to rear their own young. The chick was brooded and fed by the
female and appeared to be doing well until 12th September when it was
found dead in its roosting place. The cause of death was inconclusive.
In each case the incubation period was 21 days. The first egg weighed
43 g and measured 41 x 52 mm. All three chicks began developing a
slipped wing at about six days but this corrected itself after approximately
14 days.
Subsequently, clutches have been hand-reared and parent-reared during
1985.
The down of the chicks is grey speckled with brown and black. The
bill and feet are grey. The juvenile plumage in most respects is similar to
that of the adult hen. It would appear that immature cocks begin to colour
black on the neck at around seven months when they also develop the
characteristic bark of the adult male. Interestingly, the first bird to be
hatched in May 1984, though now in full male plumage, still retains the
eye coloration of the hen. The last chick to be hatched, now five months
old (January 1986) is showing pale dorsal streaks and we believe it to be
a hen, with which it agrees in all other respects. This being so, it is the first
of its sex thus far reared.
Two cock birds are now housed in an adjacent enclosure which is
especially spacious and heated and planted. Though they do not actually
come to blows, each remains constantly away from the other. The young-
est bird is still with the adult pair while the remaining hand-reared off-
spring is caged elsewhere in the collection.
Other than the inclusion of many more insects (collected by means of a
sweep net) and mealworms, crickets and small locusts, the diet remained
unchanged during the breeding season. In order to 'protect' her young, the
hen often feigns injury and on occasions even attacks! At such times, the
cock runs off barking loudly and incessantly. The hen alone broods her

young and initially feeds it while the cock stands guard, again barking If
alarmed. As the chick grows it will follow the cock as often as the hen
though this may represent greed since the male is often the first to the
feed bowl! Nevertheless the chick always retreats to the company of its
mother when alarmed.

The Pale-headed Mannikin, or Pale-headed Munia, or Pale-headed Nun,
is, according to Goodwin (1982) &gt; found in south-west and central Sulawesi
(Celebes) and neighbouring islands of Lombok, Sumbawa, Flores, Alor,
Savu, Kisar, Sermattu, Babar, Kalaota and Madu.
In shape and size it is similar to the commoner White-headed Mannikin
Lonchura maja except that the head is more of an off-white colour, and
the breast is a pale pinkish grey. The rest of the body is chocolate brown
to reddish chestnut, and the latter colour, especially over the flanks, glows
in bright sunlight and makes this a most attractive finch.
Four birds were purchased from a dealer in September 1983 and were
wintered together in an indoor room without heat, though the tempera-
ture did not fall below freezing.
In the spring of 1984 they were all placed in an open sheltered aviary
8 ft long x 6 ft high x 3 ft wide (2.43 x 1.82 x 0.91 m), the floor being of
slate slabs, a bucketful of farmyard manure and a bucketful of leaf mould
was placed in the front of the aviary, and kept moist. This is a practice
carried out for all the smaller finches that are likely to breed. White-
worms were provided at first but were discontinued as they were not
taken. In fact, livefood is unnecessary as subsequent chicks were reared
without.
A variety of nesting sites were provided inside the shelter and outside,
these included lovebird boxes and open finch boxes but the nest first used
was a hollow tube of wire netting filled with hay and a nest cavity made
inside. This was in the shelter.
Five eggs were laid in June and it was my intention to foster them
under some Bengalese but the latter chicks hatched before the transfer
could be made, so the Mannikins were allowed to continue their duties.
Three chicks hatched and subsequently left the nest but unfortunately
one was picked up dead after a downpour a week later.
The pair went to nest again in an open-fronted finch nest-box under
shelter and reared a further two to independence.
All eight birds were brought in to a birdroom in September 1984 and
heat was provided from November onwards until the following spring.
Unfortunately two of the young died during the winter before coming in
to adult colour, which the other two did before being replaced in the

outdoor aviary.
The juvenile Pale-headed Mannikin has a brownish buff head and
breast; the wings and tail are light chocolate, and the beak is similar to
adults but perhaps a little more grey, and the legs are dark brown.
The remaining six birds shared the same aviary and although the
adult birds had been rung with split rings the previous autumn, these
had disappeared during the winter. Nesting started late but subsequently
two chicks left the nest in late September. Unfortunately these were
found dead on my return from being away for a few days.
The six birds were brought indoors at the end of September 1985 and
I tried to split them into pairs by appearance. Each pair was similarly
housed in cages 3 ft long x 114 ft wide x 2 ft high (0.91 x 0.45 x 0.60 m);
open-ended finch nest-boxes were provided which faced the length of the
cages, and were filled with hay which was hollowed out to make a nest
chamber. More hay and coconut fibre were provided as well as heat from
November onwards.
One pair threw out all the nesting material, the other just sat in the
box, but the third pair laid five eggs, three of which hatched on 2nd
January. The chicks left the nest on 19th January and were feeding inde-
pendently by 5th February.
The diet consists of a mixture of 50% white millet and 50% canary
seed, to which I add Japanese and red millet, plus a little niger and maw
seed. In addition, the above mixture is provided soaked, plus some soaked
paddy rice and Ce De. Millet sprays, both dry and soaked, were offered
but were not popular. During the summer, meadow grasses were provided
and ornamental grasses such as Miscanthus sinensis .
Cuttle fish 'bone' and grit were always provided and when the birds
were indoors, a few drops of Abedec were occasionally added to the
drinking water.
At the time of writing (6th March 1986) the same pair have now laid
another clutch. The other 'pairs' are still not doing anything.

By L. GIBSON
(Burnaby, British Columbia)
The general habits, etc., of this species have been described earlier
(Avicultural Magazine, 1981, p. 34). The birds nested in the conservatory
as described for Cyanerpes (Avicultural Magazine , 1979, p. 6). As men-
tioned previously they can be sexed by the blue on the throat; the female
has two stripes, joined only at the top, while the male has a solid patch
of blue.
Courtship was rather hectic and consisted of chasing then sitting
screeching at each other. The cock seemed to like hanging upside down
below the hen, on the same twig. The breeding pair picked one another
from a group of five and, apart from mild quarrelling on occasions, they
were still quite friendly almost a year later. This shows the importance of
natural selection. It was fortunate that they had a few to pick from for
most of the time we stick two birds together and that is that, and I have
consistently had trouble doing this with Shamas, for example.
The aviary was shared with a pair of Silver-beaked Tanagers Rampho-
celus carbo which nested first. They were taken out later when the
Chloropsis nested. General breeding procedure was identical to C. hard-
wickei and only additional information is given here.

Four nests were built and all were constructed of grass and horse, or
cow, hair only. A wide range of materials was made available. Three were
reconstructed hardwickei nests, and one was a new nest. The latter was
used twice, and was the only successful nest. Eggs were laid in only one of
the other nests. The dimensions were identical to the hardwickei nests.
The first nest was a reconstruction of the old hardwickei nest, in bam-
boo. It was started on 6th April, 1980. The horse hair lining was taken
out and replaced. The sides were partly dismantled and reconstructed,
giving them a slightly more open weave than the original and the lining
was also sparse. The nest was completed but not used. On 1st May, the hen
began to reconstruct the second hardwickei nest in the creeping fig, against
the wall. This time it had a thicker lining. It took only two days to refur-
bish, and the first egg was laid on the third day. The cock was seen to
carry a piece of grass at this time but he did not do any work and was not
seen to do this again. The third nest was yet another reconstruction of the

first. Each time the lining was taken out completely and replaced. This
was still not used and a fourth was started. This nest was completely new
and situated in the creeping fig, but at the same height at the opposite end
of the wall from the other. It could not be seen except from a step ladder
which was immediately installed.
All the nests were firmly fixed and lined only with black or red hair,
white hair being ignored. When the new nest was finished, the pad of
horse hair lining the base was found standing on end. It had probably been
pulled up by the birds' claws when leaving. This was stitched back in using
black thread and at the same time, some loops were sewn around the rim.
This turned out to be a good idea, for by the time a chick left the nest, it
was still as good as new. There was previously some trouble with nest rims
unravelling a lot. As a further precaution, a twig was wired in place just in
front of the nest. Previously there had been nothing to land on except the
nest rim.
Eggs and incubation
Prior to laying, the hen began to consume increased quantities of food.
This consisted of insects mostly and when these were put in, the cock
immediately called the hen down to them (and still does). In contrast to
the hardwickei , he fed her regularly. However, no food was taken to her
while she was on the nest.
The clutch consists of two eggs. Three clutches were laid: the first
was started on 3rd May and the last on 16th August. The eggs were slightly
smaller than those of the hardwickei , being 20 x 16 mm. All had a pale
reddish brown wash except for one which was white. They had large
reddish-brown spots sparsely concentrated at the big end, with a very few
smaller spots petering out around the middle. Some eggs had pretty mauve
spots interspersed among the brown ones.
As with hardwickei there was some delayed hatching. The first egg was
chipped open by me when it was 15 days old, possibly 16, depending on
whether it was the first or second laid. A live chick, more or less ready for
hatching, tumbled out and the parents fed it within five hours. The other
egg in the clutch was fertile but had died at about the 5th-6th day period.
Both chicks in the second nest had hatched by 10.00 a.m. on the same
day, after 14 and 15 days' incubation. When the hen was incubating, the
cock sat at the opposite end of the aviary and, in contrast to the silent
vigil of the cock hardwickei , he occasionally sang quietly. When the hen
left the nest he flew close by her but never went near the nest while there
were still eggs in it. Temperatures ranged from a low of 52*F (11*C) at
night, to a daytime high of 80*F (27*C) for the clutches which hatched.

Chicks
These were just the same as the hardwickei , being rather small and very
slow to develop for the first three or four days. Both parents fed actively
from the first day. Only insects were used at first, being mostly wasp
pupae and larvae, spiders, grasshoppers and termites. The latter were con-
veniently obtained by sawing up lengths of my sundeck - about two years
before, a toucan upset a jar of these insects in the sundeck and apparently
some escaped and settled underneath it!
On the seventh day the hen fed some rice to a chick, but it could have
been getting it earlier. The chicks opened their eyes at six days, one
opening and closing its eyes on the fifth day. This was the main difference
from the hardwickei chicks which were much later. The Golden-fronted
Chloropsis chicks were difficult to induce to beg but nevertheless were
easier than the hardwickei. They sometimes sprang up at the first tap.
All were fed from the second day onwards with egg/butter/milk.
The sole chick to hatch in the clutch grew well and was very fat by the
13th day, in fact it weight 27 g, which was too much. In spite of growing
well, its primaries had not come out until the 10th day in comparison
with the seventh day for the other chicks. The feathers were all well
formed in spite of this. The chick was very quiet and did not object at all
to being lifted out. Its parents hopped about angrily nearby, uttering
explosive whistles whenever the chick was handled.
At 16 days the chick flopped from the nest and was obviously not
normal. It could only flap its wings a little and sat holding its feet up,
resting on the first joint. It seemed incapable of stretching its neck out
fully and squeaked, possibly in pain, when this was done by hand. It
was placed on a concrete block and the parents continued to feed it. It
jumped off the block several times but could not move from where it
landed. It had very little grip in its feet and two swellings were apparent
on its legs. These grew progressively larger by the day. The legs began to
bend at the swellings, which became inflamed. The parents tried des-
perately to get it to fly. They were carrying nesting material by this time.
The chick was taken indoors at 18 days, started on antibiotics, and hand-
fed.
The next day it was seen eating and drinking without trouble, but had
difficulty moving to and from the food. It was given aspirin and this made
it much brighter. It had been squeaking in pain quite often whenever it
moved. Swelling was also noted in a wing joint. The chick died the follow-
ing day in great distress. A post-mortem examination showed that both
legs seemed to have been broken and there was much recalcification going
on. It also had problems with its neck and wings. It had been hand-fed
with what should have been plenty of calcium and vitamin D. It did not

mobile) and was otherwise plump and well-developed. It was more likely
that this chick had a malabsorption syndrome for calcium or vitamin D,
and nothing would have saved it. Rickets can usually be corrected fairly
well by simply supplying vitamin D, but this chick got rapidly and pro-
gressively worse.
The second clutch to hatch was laid on the 15th and 16th August and
both chicks appeared on the 31st. Everything went smoothly until one
chick died suddenly at almost 10 days old, with no previous signs of dis-
tress. The cause of death was easily established. Its little stomach was more
than three-quarters filled with six pieces of pumice stone. Pumice is, of
course, very light and the largest piece weighed 115.5 mg, but it measured
7 x 5.5 x 3 mm. Total weight of the six pieces was 205 mg. A flower pot
with potting soil containing pumice fragments had been put In some time
during this nesting and was removed two days before the chick died. It is
not known whether the stones were fed as grit or, more probably, as
minerals. The first chick had no grit at all in the stomach. It would be a
good thing to feed grit and/or eggshell to all birds to avoid this, as I have
had at least one previous chick killed by getting relatively large stones fed
to it.
The other chick probably got fed pumice fragments also, but it was the
larger of the two and as each day went by, it became safer. It developed
uneventfully, leaving the nest at 13 days and thereafter followed the
Hardwick's chick in development. As previously postulated, it was indeed
green all over; the only difference from the hardwickei chick being the top
of its head. It had a lighter green patch where its orange crown would be.
It gradually moulted into adult plumage at three to four months old, and
proved to be a male.
The parents started to moult when the chick was about three weeks
old and they were very quiet and friendly. They remain so to this day. An
interesting thing happened with their feeding habits. They did not go over
to Insects quite as much as the Marwick's, although they obviously pre-
ferred them. They were also much less fussy, eating even mealworm
beetles, although they did pick out only the softest larvae and pupae for
the chicks. They did not take any nectar during the nesting period,
scarcely bothered with it thereafter and have hardly taken it since. It is
offered every month or so, just to check, but is usually ignored. They have
settled to a staple diet of rice pudding and orange, with a little banana and
as many mealworms as can be spared.

BOW LEG SYNDROME IN RATITE BIRDS
By Dr. P. GUITTIN

From 1981 to 1985, various changes were made in the hand-rearing of
Ostrich, rhea and Emu chicks at the Paris Zoological Park to determine
environmental and nutritional factors involved in the excessive growth and
low survival of chicks with bow legs.
Introduction
Leg deformities occur in ratites in many zoological parks (Guittin,
1985). Variously known as perosis, leg disorders, musculo-skeletal disease,
slipped tendon, and spread leg (Wallach, 1970; Walser et al, 1982; Reece &amp;
Butler, 1984), bow leg syndrome may best describe the leg deformities
commonly found in several ratite birds. Leg bone deformities have been
reported in the Ostrich Struthio camelus, the Greater Rhea Rhea ameri-
cana , Darwin's Rhea Pterocnemia pennata , the Emu Dromaius novaehol-
landiae, and cassowaries Casuarius spp. (Bruning, 1973; Cordonnier, 1977;
Reece &amp; Butler, 1984). At Paris Zoological Park, the usual history of birds
with bow leg syndrome is that the eggs were artificially incubated and the
newly hatched chicks were overfed, grew rapidly for the first month and
developed leg deformities by two to eight weeks old. The purpose of the
present study was to show nutritional and behavioural causes of the dis-
ease.

At the Paris Zoological Park, eggs of three species of ratite birds (Stru-
thio camelus, Rhea americana, Dromaius novaehollandiae) were artificially
incubated (36.7*C and a relative humidity of 65%) and were automatically
turned every two hours. Seventy-eight Ostrich, 87 Rhea and 51 Emu
chicks had been hand-reared after hatching: 12 Ostriches, 20 Rheas and
five Emus were weighed and measured every day for the first two months
after hatching, then every week thereafter. Chicks of less than 5 kg were
weighed in a high box, using baby scales (1% standard error). Heavier
chicks were double-weighed, using converted bathroom scales (4% stan-
dard error). The height of each chick was determined by use of a measur-
ing apparatus (5% standard error), without disturbing the chicks. Four
heights were evaluated: the head height, measured at the top of the
cranium; the back height, at the first dorsal vertebra; the hip height, at

During the first two months, the low survival might be attributed to the
lack of appropriate husbandry techniques. Also, the lack of attention
normally provided by the male adult in natural rearing, made the chicks
more inactive. If chicks have no encouragement to develop their muscles,
they do not use their leg joints sufficiently. This in turn can lead to gener-
alised weakness and deformities becoming apparent.
To encourage activity, several techniques were devised. It was impor-
tant not to keep a chick alone as the presence of other chicks, and Indeed
adult birds, encouraged ratite chicks to move about. The floor surface also
influenced the chicks' behaviour. Early on we found that an edible surface,
such as litter or grass was not suitable because young chicks would eat it
and suffer impactions. On the other hand, a ground that was too hard
became painful for the chicks to walk on, leading to inactivity. We decided
that a floor of jute or straw was a good compromise for younger chicks as
these materials were not eaten by chicks, and provided adequate traction
with satisfactory firmness.For two-month old birds, a short area of grass
gave the optimal results. It was also necessary to consider the size of the
enclosure to encourage movement. About 2 m 2 for young chicks up
to two months old was satisfactory. Then we gave midges and flies which
kept chicks busy looking for and catching these insects and other inver-
tebrates.
Yet exercise is not considered the only factor responsible for streng-
thening legs. We found that restrictions on food intake prevented bow legs
and that a nutritionally adequate diet improved the survival rate. Also
when we had quantitatively reduced daily food intake, the bone pathology
had largely decreased (Table 1). We had understood that this syndrome
was correlated with overfeeding. Studies of diet had shown a reduction in
food Intake corresponded to a specific reduction in metabolizable energy
requirement. Energy nutrients such as cereals or pellets for carnivores or
poultry induced risk; also it might be important to raise the calcium
level of the diet since chicks developed a calcium deficiency. During the
first two months, ratite chicks had a rationed diet (Table 1). Then from
two to 12 months old, ratite birds had a diet which was given ad lib. but
was qualitatively restricted (Table 2).

We made a retrospective investigation with rhea chicks. The chicks
were divided into three groups: group 1 was composed of five chicks
that developed bow legs between 23 and 31 days old; group 2 was com-
posed of five chicks that developed bow legs between eight and 11 days
old; group 3 was composed of 10 control chicks that showed a normal
growth.
During the first week, group 2 had been heavier than the controls
(group 3) from the fourth day (Fig. 1). But a significant difference
(p&lt;0.05) only became apparent at the ninth day, with the first onset of
symptoms. During the first month comparison between groups 1 and 2
showed a significant difference (p-^0.02) at 17 days old, before lame-
ness was seen (Fig. 2). So it was possible to identify a presymptomatic
period of this disease, from three to six days before the first clinical
symptoms appeared.

Dr. P. GUITTIN - BOW LEG SYNDROME IN RATITE BIRDS
By daily analysis of the chicks' weights, we were able to note a pattern
of growth preceding bowing of the tarsometatarsus. Measurements showed
that a rapid weight increase preceded a spurt of tarsometatarsal growth
just before the lameness appeared. These chicks might be growing so
rapidly that they were unable to metabolise enough calcium and their legs
started bowing (Guittin, 1983). The weight of the chicks which were kept
with the male did not increase so rapidly since they were too busy chasing
flies to eat the food prepared for them (Bruning, 1973). Their growth was
correspondingly slower and they did not develop leg bowing. These results
suggested a way to prevent this syndrome by reducing the food intake to
slow down early growth.
Growth Findings
Signs of lameness were more frequently seen in rheas than Ostriches or
Emus. The earliest leg deformities were apparent in eight-day old rheas.
The second week after hatching was the first of the two critical periods. At
this stage leg growth was rapid, and abnormal lateral twisting and inflam-
mation of the tiobiometatarsal joint could be detected. Initially, twisting
would develop, without lateral rotation of the tarsometatarsus. Three days
after onset of lameness, rheas with a tibiometatarsal twisting up to a 70*
angle. Ostriches and rheas could also develop a bowing of the tarso-
metatarsus. Eventually chicks developed lateral rotation of the distal
third of the tibia, which progressed until the gastrocnemius tendon luxated
off the medial condyle and the chick was unable to stand or walk normally
as a result.
Generally, Ostriches and Emus began to show clinical signs of bowing
at four weeks old; rheas developed the bow leg syndrome during the
second critical period, between six and 12 weeks old. Younger ratite birds
showed the most severe bowing deformities. Several one- to two-month
old ratite chicks began to develop bowing of the tarsometatarsus, a
bulbous and Inflammatory enlargement of the proximal tarsometatarsus,
and persistent lameness. Inflammation of the tibiometatarsal joint was
constant with bow leg syndrome. In rheas, during the second critical
period, development of bow leg was always associated with deformities of
the leg bone. Tibiotarsal and tarsometatarsal deformities were seen most
commonly in the heaviest ratite birds.
The tarsometatarsus was often twisted with an inflammatory proximal
third and the tibiometatarsal joint was highly congested. The distal tibio-
metatarsal and proximal tarsometatarsal bones were poorly vascularised.
The periphery of apex of these bones was severely eroded. Deformities of
the tibiotarsus were frequently associated with tarsometatarsal dyschon-
droplasia.

Two-week old and eight-week old ratite birds, especially rheas, some-
times had tibiometatarsal joint inflammation. Macroscopic examinations
systematically indicated congestion of the tibiometatarsal joint, inflamma-
tion of the proximal tarsometatarsal bone, and abrasion of the distal
tibiotarsal and proximal tarsometatarsal articular surfaces.

If no corrective or preventive measures were taken, the bowing became
so bad that the ratite chicks were unable to stand up, but it was very diffi-
cult to stop the bowing if symptoms were too severe. The only treatment
was to give concomitantly easily assimilable calcium and injections of
multi-vitamins, including from 20 to 40 micrograms of vitamin D3 a
week. But for these corrective measures to be successful it was necessary
to begin very early, 24 hours after the first symptoms appeared and to
continue for two months.
Bone and plastic surgery, to reduce overstretched ligament of the tibio-
metatarsal joint did not satisfactorily improve stability of legs and so we
always saw a recurrence of the disease. Sometimes fixing an elastic band
around and between the legs was successful in keeping joints in position if
this treatment was applied just after the first symptoms appeared during
the first critical period.
Prevention
In the first instance, manipulation of the diet in two ways is considered
essential: the energy content of the food should be decreased by limiting
cereals and pellets to the absolute minimum and offering alfalfa, carrots
and apples; secondly, mineral and vitamin supplements including especially
calcium and Vitamin D3 should be increased. But chicks were very selec-
tive eaters, and they could leave the supplement but eat relatively greater
quantities of pellets. These birds grew rapidly and developed bowing.
However, to give the chicks repeated injections was not very good for
them because they had to be caught and showed signs of stress. Our ex-
periments showed that supplementation in the form of pulverised eggshell
which would adhere closely to fresh food would be eaten. Chicks should
be kept on a calcium supplement until they are approximately six months
old. If this was discontinued too early, bow-leg syndrome could still occur
with enlargement of the joint.
It was also necessary to reduce the food intake in order to slow down
early growth and to improve environmental factors. Five zootechnic

measures might follow on the nutritional prophylaxis:
1. At the Paris Zoological Park we gave several meals a day, i.e. one-
month old chicks had six daily meals and six-month, old chicks had
four.
2. The influence of exercise was very important. Chicks should be en-
couraged to move and walk to develop their leg joints and bones. A
chick which did not move, was unstable and fell down often had a
higher risk of developing bow legs. A large area was necessary to allow
chicks to be always on the move.
3. We have found that a floor covering of jute or straw decreases the risks
of slipping and bow legs.
4. During the first weeks, provision of livefood kept the chicks busy and
helped to prevent a rapid weight gain.
5. A ratite chick should not be left alone because it will tend to be less
active and its legs become fragile. Ratite chicks kept in groups num-

bering between 10 and 12 young birds of the same species all together
was preferable, taking care not to have too great a difference of age
between them. Three weeks between the youngest and the oldest in
the same group constituted the maximum safe range.
To limit development of bowing during the first critical period, we
provided support for the legs from hatching onwards. We put an elastic
bandage with a compress between the two legs in the midst of tibiae
and, sometimes, tarsometatarsae. Chicks could rest and move without
running excessively. One week afterwards, the rubber bandage was taken
off. This slack restraining apparatus led to a decrease in the incidence
of bow legs syndrome on all three studied species of ratite birds.

Our experience has shown that the bow legs syndrome is often an
indication of malnutrition. Due to the chicks 5 inactivity in certain con-
ditions, environmental hazards and inadequate food intake, optimum
survival rates are not obtained. With the male-reared chicks, the bow
legs syndrome is unknown (Bruning, 1973; BTuning, 1974). Wild birds
have to hunt for a varied diet and greater activity results in natural
growth without rapid weight increases.
The results indicate that the bow legs syndrome is due essentially to
an imbalance in calcium metabolism. Deficiencies of manganese and zinc
with heavy supplementation of calcium, probably do not cause this syn-
drome, but may interfere with the absorption of calcium (Wallach, 1970).
The aetiology may be the association between a deficiency of calcium and

a too rapid weight gain. So, an excessive high energy ration can be a con-
tributory factor to the bow legs syndrome (Ullrey, 1982). Therefore, food
intake, especially of cereals and pellets, should be reduced to slow down
early growth.
Nutrition is not the only cause, however, as bone problems can develop
during the first week after hatching when chicks begin eating. Stability of
legs is an important point. Legs of chicks that do not move early become
fragile and generally become bowed. Activity and movement that streng-
then the bones, are also preventative measures.

INVERTED RESTING IN PIONUS PARROTS

By WERNER LANTERMANN &amp; SUSANNE WOZNIAK
(Aus dem Privatinstitut fur Papageienforschung, Oberhausen, Germany)
With the exception of Asian Hanging Parrots Loriculus sp., which
usually rest and sleep upside down (Buckley, 1968), this habit is hardly
known in other members of the Psittaciformes. However, inverted resting
is more common within this group than suggested in literature.
The neotropical Barred Parrakeet Bolborhynchus lineola was first
recorded as sleeping upside down by Prestwich (1954). Dilger (1960)
observed Agapornis pullaria resting and sleeping upside down and some-
times saw Agapornis taranta resting this way during the day. The South
American Green-rumped Parrotlet Forpus passerinus has been observed
resting and preening in the same way (Buckley and Buckley, 1968).
During our studies on the neotropical parrot genus Pionus, some
preliminary results of which have been presented in a previous article
(Lantermann, 1983), we observed two further species of parrots resting
upside down.
Two young Blue-headed Parrots Pionus menstruus, which were bred in
our Institute in the summer of 1982, were first seen resting in that posi-
tion at the age of four months. The parrots chose a perch of about 25 mm
in diameter, turned their bodies upside down and hung by both feet after
shuffling their feet around to find the most suitable foothold. They have
never been observed with one foot tucked under the body feathers and
the head turned over the shoulder. Seven months after hatching, these
birds stopped hanging upside down and two other young parrots from the
same 1982 brood never showed this behaviour pattern.
The Scaly-headed Parrots Pionus maximiliani , two of which we keep in our
aviaries, sporadically rested in the same way when they were obviously
very young birds. This habit stopped after the birds had lived in our
Institute for six months but unfortunately we did not know
the exact age of the parrots at the time we bought them from a dealer.
According to Dilger's definition (loc. cit.), the behaviour pattern of
resting and sleeping includes slightly fluffed body feathers and closed or
partly closed eyes, sometimes with the head turned over the shoulder.
None of our birds ever showed these characteristics, but the frequency
of this way of hanging upside down, which was usually performed several
times a day for sometimes more than 30 minutes, makes us believe that
this was not play behaviour but a form of resting.
The origin of this habit is not exactly known. Dilger suggests that it

must have evolved in a common ancestor of the paleaotropical Loriculus
and Agapornis parrots 'in response to nocturnal predators from which
safety was achieved by sleeping amid leaves at the slender ends of twigs'
(p. 660).
We assume that this element is a behavioural rudiment without any
function for a 'modern' parrot group like the highly developed Pionus
parrots. Behavioural rudiments are occasionally found in young birds,
which perform 'extinct' behaviour patterns and in certain circumstances
allow one to draw conclusions on the behaviour and ecological adaptations
of their ancestors (Immelmann, 1983).
It is conceivable that the ancestors of Old World parrots (i.e. Loriculus
and Agapornis) and New World parrots (i.e. Bolborhynchus, Forpus and
Pionus) independently of each other evolved the same methods of pro-
tecting against nocturnal predators. But the relatively heavy weight of
Pionus parrots (+/- 220 g) is noteworthy and seems to be unsuitable for
that way of protecting against predators, suggested by Dilger for the
much smaller Loriculus (+/- 30 g) and Agapornis (+/- 45 g) parrots. It
might be supposed that former relations of Pionus parrots were of smaller
size than recent forms of that group.
For adult Pionus menstruus and P. maximiliani inverted resting is
not recorded in freedom or captivity. We have never seen this behaviour
pattern in any other Pionus species, some of which we keep in our aviaries.

My partner, Albert Holmes, and I bought two pairs of these birds in
1982 and although we had a relatively poor start in breeding them, this
has now been resolved. We are at present working with eight breeding
pairs, plus two or three odd cock birds. We have built up our stock from
Dutch, German and English strains, using birds as unrelated as possible.
Unlike some people, we do not keep compatible pairs together producing
great quantities of similar genetic material. We allow pairs to rear one to
three rounds, swap them round, rest them for a period and start again. We
feel this is essential in order to produce as much unrelated stock for the
future of aviculture in this country.
Anyone with any knowledge of these birds will agree that they are a
little unpredictable, to say the least. Compatibility is really the key to
success, as a compatible pair will produce many young with little or no
trouble. However, this is surely not the aim of a genuine aviculturist
whose task should be to ensure a strong nucleus of unrelated birds for
the future. Therefore, in the long term, one chick reared by a pair which
is not completely compatible must be of more use genetically than a
dozen produced from a compatible pair. As I say, some birds are no
trouble, others will rear one round and lose the next. Some birds will
learn by their mistakes and get the chicks a few days older each time
until they finally succeed. Some birds will not have your chosen partner
at any price! Sometimes, if the cock is removed, the hen will rear the
chicks on her own. So you can see that Cuban Finches are unpredictable
but nevertheless very interesting.
They can also be quite pugnacious - two breeders with whom I am
working have had cocks kill hens.I had a hen kill two cocks, accept my
third offering and rear two rounds of four and three young respectively.
Cuban Finches can be bred in flights or cages. In my experience,
cages measuring 15 x 15 x 36 in long (0.38 x 0.38 x 0.91 m) are best
but this is a personal observation. Chicks can leave the nest at 12/14
days and at this size/age they would probably perish outside in bad
weather. I find that flask-type baskets are preferred, and if these are
hung at a slight incline, it does help to keep chicks inside a few days
longer. The neat nests are lined with feathers stripped from the hen
(usually). My birds use hay and coconut fibre for nesting material.

The chicks moult into adult plumage and mature very fast. In fact,
it is not unusual to breed from them at three to four months old and
I see no reason to discourage them if they are fit and want to reproduce.
There is no evidence to suggest that inferior young are produced and, in
fact, another breeder has stated that, in his experience, to stop them from
breeding at an early age is detrimental and actually gives poorer results.
When the hens are in breeding condition, they have a most peculiar
&quot;musky' odour which will almost 'knock you over' if they are held in
the hand. I remove young from their parents at approximately three
weeks old. Very occasionally adult cocks will kill young cocks if they
are left with their parents until they start to 'colour up'. Young birds
sometimes leave the nest plucked, but their feathers soon grow back.
One or other of the parents is usually plucked to a varying degree for
lining the nest, but the feathers are allowed to grow back once nesting has
stopped.
With regard to feeding and general husbandry, all my seedeaters
receive similar treatment. The birdroom, which is made of wood, is well
insulated and has a large amount of double glazing used in its construc-
tion. It is thermostatically controlled at 60*F minimum. Newspaper is
used as a floor covering (I once had a friend remark, 'No wonder he breeds
so many with all those pinups to look at!'). Canary seed, pannicum and
mixed millet are fed in separate pots to reduce wastage. Spray millet is
always available as are various greenstuffs and seeding weeds in season.
Once a week a half handful of the following mixture is thrown on the
floor: British wild seed, Haith's Tonic Grains (or a mixture of maw,
gold of pleasure, niger, lettuce and rape), yeast, Haith's Mineralised Grit,
limestone grit, oystershell grit, grated iodine block, Haith's Pink Minerals,
charcoal, Kirkpatrick's Pigeon Minerals, kelp powder and sand. Water is
always available, the same container being used for drinking and bathing,
(I do not use clip-on water fountains). A small dish of softbill food is
provided and changed weekly.
At 7.0 a.m. each pair gets a half teaspoon of dry eggfood. I use an
equal mix of 'Ce-De' and 'Ce-De Mix'. Heaped on this dry food I provide
approximately one teaspoon of soaked, sprouted seed. I find a salad
sprouter is more efficient for sprouting than other methods, and I take
equal parts of paddy rice, oats, groats, hemp, and mung beans and mix
one cup of this dry seed mixture with one cup of plain canary and one
cup of mixed millet. This mixture is soaked and sprouted for approxi-
mately three days.
When birds have chicks in the nest, naturally I increase the amount of
soaked seed given each morning. I also give them some more soaked seed
in the evening, but no more eggfood. Some birds will eat a little wholemeal

bread and milk with soaked seed on top. A slice of pear, or orange sprink-
led with sugar, is provided about twice a week. Mealworms, small or cut
up, are given when rearing (about four to six), morning and evening.
Sometimes bushes are beaten for insects in the summer. A vitamin prepa-
ration is occasionally added to the water, usually Vitaflight or Vitality
Plus (same product, different name). Occasionally other products are used.
I do not use a vitamin preparation on a regular basis. I may use It twice
one week and then miss a week so perhaps it would be fairer to say that I
use it as and when I think of it. I do not use vitamin preparations when
chicks are less than a week old as I have sometimes found that this results
in chicks being ejected.
1 hope that this article will encourage others to continue to build up a
strain of these birds and other small unusual seedeaters before any future
legislation in various countries prevents us from doing so.

fwo races of the Bicheno Finch are recognised (see Blakers, M. et al,
1984, for the most up-to-date distribution details).
P. b. bichenovii has a white rump and is often referred to as the Banded
Finch and P.b. annuiosa, which has a black rump, is given the name Black-
ringed Finch. It is reported that where the range between the two races
overlaps, not only are there white-ramped and black-ramped specimens
but also individuals showing variable amounts of white feathering on an
otherwise black ramp (Keast, 1958; Mathews, 1926). In captivity, the
black, rumped race has proved to be recessive to the white-rumped and
when mated together, only white-rumped birds are produced (which are,
of course, split for black-rumped).
The black-rumped race is very rare in captivity. There are a certain
number about, however, and in October 1985 I purchased a hen from, of
all places, the Parrot Society Show at Luton. Two months later, at the
National Exhibition of Cage Birds (held at the N.E.C., Birmingham) I saw
another on a dealer&amp;apos;s stand. Much as I would have liked to purchase this
bird, upon inspection it was found to have a severe vent disorder so I left
well alone. However, someone did purchase the bird as, about half an hour
later, I noticed it was missing from the dealer's cage.
Housing
Although Bichenos can be of a somewhat nervous disposition, they will
settle well to cage life and under such conditions can prove extremely
prolific. My breeding pairs are housed in box cages measuring 0.91 x 0.41
x 0.41 m. Young and resting adults are housed in cages 1.8 m x 0.41 x
0.41 m, with no more than 10 birds per cage.
Breeding
A nest-box is placed ready in a rear corner of the cage immediately
before the breeding pair is introduced. The design I use is a 0.13 m cube
with a 0.04 in opening. A hinged lid is fitted, thus making nest inspection
a simple matter. To the nest-box is added a layer of clean, white sawdust
(or shavings) and the box is then filled with a mixture of coconut fibre
and soft hay, after which a hollow is made by placing the ball of one's fist
into the material. A small amount of nesting material is placed on the floor

of the cage (under the nest-box so that it does not become soiled with
droppings). Rarely do the birds use this extra material, although cock birds
will take up pieces of the hay for display purposes (see later).
A breeding pair will usually enter the nest-box almost immediately they
are released into the breeding cage. Even those which prove a little shy of
the box will most certainly enter for the night period and from then on
use it regularly.
Unlike certain species of Australian finch such as the Gouldian Chloe-
bia gouldiae (see Mobbs, 1985a), Bichenos do not appear to have a set
pattern when breeding. Because of this, I can only describe the average
breeding cycle taken from details kept on a number of pairs.
Usually a pair will start to incubate before the final egg of the clutch
is laid. Chicks always hatch within a two to three day period of each other,
so I presume most pairs do not start to incubate in earnest until at least
the second or third egg has been laid. The average clutch is four, and
chicks begin to hatch after 12 days. They are minute at first and it is very
difficult to discern how many chicks there are in a nest if one takes only
a perfunctory glance. Upon hatching the chicks are flesh-coloured and
covered in white down. The down is lost and the flesh darkens within
three to six days of hatching. At this time the quills of the primaries begin
to appear.
When the chicks are seven days old, the parent birds appear, during the
day, to brood only spasmodically and by the ninth day, brooding ceases
altogether although both parent birds will sleep in the nest-box at night.
Both parents feed the chicks, often entering the nest at the same time.
When the chicks are 10 days old, it is possible to close-ring them. One
certainly should not attempt to do so before this age and it is often pos-
sible to close-ring chicks of up to 13-14 days of age.
Chicks begin to leave the nest from about 28 days. At first they may
leave the nest-box for only a matter of minutes, after which they will
return. As they become more mature, they will leave the nest for longer
periods, but always return to roost.
Chicks can be removed from their parents at approximately six weeks
old; left longer, the parent birds are likely to attack them.
With Gouldian Finches, I always remove the nest-box from the breed-
ing cage when the chicks are one month old (Mobbs, 1985a). Bichenos
become so attached to their nest-box that to remove it would no doubt
cause stress both to the parent birds and the chicks. Indeed, for the first
few days after the chicks are moved from the breeding cage to a growing-
on cage (see above), they will, in the late evening, search around the cage
in obvious distress, until eventually they settle down on a perch to roost.
Some breeders supply young birds with a nest-box in which to sleep, but

A.J. MOBBS - OBSERVATIONS ON THE BICHENO FINCH
I am totally against this practice as not only may it induce young birds to
attempt nesting long before they should, it also encourages the birds to
remain timid, hiding away in the box whenever anyone enters the bird-
room.
The moment the chicks are removed from their parents, the breeding
cage should be thoroughly cleaned, the nest-box emptied of its contents,
washed, refilled with nesting material and placed into position. It is im-
perative that this is carried out immediately the chicks are removed as the
hen will almost certainly start to lay a further clutch within a matter of
days. Indeed, I have known hens lay eggs when the chicks they are rearing
are only four weeks old. One pair which did this actually reared the chicks
already with them and carried on to successfully hatch the second clutch
and rear the chicks to independence.
Bichenos can prove prolific breeders but, as with all the birds that I
keep, 1 only allow each pair to rear two clutches each season. This means
that when the breeding season is over and the pairs are split up, the hens
always carry on laying eggs for a week or so after being placed in the rest-
ing cages. Such eggs should be collected up the moment they are found
and either discarded or, if one is not against the use of foster parents, put
under Bengalese Finches, as these eggs almost invariably prove fertile.
Growth of chicks
Bichenos, when first they leave the nest are only half the size of an
adult. Many have pin feathers on and around the head and the tail
feathers are at the most only half grown.
Well-fed chicks have the same feather pattern as an adult but the
colours are much subdued, the face mask and the breast band being
greyish white, with the black and white markings on the wings much less
defined than in an adult bird.
Chicks which have not received a sufficiently nutritious diet often
have only the top black breast bar, others may have no breast bars at all,
the whole of the upper chest and breast being greyish white. Chicks
marked thus always moult out normally, attaining the usual adult plu-
mage with the first moult.
Bichenos begin the first moult into adult plumage at approximately
six weeks old and well-fed chicks attain full adult plumage within eight
to nine weeks. Although not a particularly vocal species, young cocks
often begin to sing at six weeks old.
Because Bichenos attain full adult plumage at a relatively early age,
many aviculturists put young birds down to nest far too early. Many hens
can be lost because of this, due mainly to egg-binding. Although a
young Bicheno appears fully adult at approximately eight weeks old, if

such birds are compared with adult birds of, say, seven months or more
it will be noticed that the young birds are usually smaller. I have found
that young Bichenos will continue to mature until they are at least six
to seven months old. Therefore I never use a Bicheno for breeding pur-
poses until it is at least nine months old.
Many young hens will begin to lay eggs at this age. If they do, it is a
good sign that they are ready for breeding.
Adult hens housed in resting cages will begin to lay eggs soon after
the annual moult is completed. Indeed many will become so keen to
breed that they will lay in the seed bowls and often continue to sit in
the bowls after the eggs have been removed. I remember one hen in
particular who did this. When eventually I paired her up and placed her
in the breeding cage, she laid eggs in the nest-box but when it was the
cock's turn to incubate, the hen, after taking food, could be found
sitting in the seed pot until it was her turn to incubate again.
Diet
The staple diet supplied to my Bichenos consists of pearl white millet,
pannicum millet and plain canary seed. All are supplied in separate dishes.
Spray millet is available permanently as is oyster shell, limestone and min-
eralised grit. A piece of cuttlefish 'bone' is attached to the cage front per-
manently and flaked cuttlefish 'bone' is given at least three times a week.
A dish of soaked seeds (consisting of one part budgerigar mixture to one
part plain canary seed) is given daily. Non-breeding birds take only small
amounts, but pairs with chicks and young birds take these seeds avidly
and are offered as much as they will consume.
Thoroughly washed lettuce is given to breeding pairs three times daily;
non-breeding birds and young birds are offered lettuce every other day.
Once or twice a week a teaspoonful of Kilpatrick's Iodised Minerals
(for pigeons) is placed on the floor of the cage. This is taken avidly and is
eaten so quickly it is not on the cage floor long enough to become soiled
with droppings.
No livefood is offered, but pairs with young will take a good proprietary
brand of egg food, especially when their chicks are between one to ten
days old. When the chicks are weaned, egg food is offered until they com-
plete their first moult. Hen eggshell is also offered about twice a week to
both breeding and non-breeding birds. The shells should first be placed in
nearly boiling water for approximately three minutes, then left to dry
before being offered, or if not required immediately, should be stored in a
clean screw-top jar ready for use. As with most Australian finches,
Bichenos seem to prefer the egg shell to be offered in large pieces.

Sexing
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9993155" page_id="56953884"  page_num="90" year="" vol="">
It is extremely difficult to sex Bichenos by visual means. Cocks sup-
posedly have brighter masks and chest bands than hens, and the black
chest bars on the former are supposedly wider. This may prove correct in
certain cases, but what does one do when one is confronted with an ex-
ceptionally well marked hen or a poorly marked cock?
For the past year I have used the following method of sexing and to
date, it has proved the ideal way in which to deal with this problem. To
use this method one requires at least two birds and preferably they should
have been housed together for at least a couple of weeks. Then, if one
considers that they may not be a true pair, remove one to a cage on its
own. If either bird is a cock, then within seconds (yes, that is all it will
take), the bird will start singing. It is noticeable that a cock bird will,
the moment it is caged on its own, stand in an alert position on the perch,
hardly moving at all. It may call for a moment or so but will then begin
to sing.
If the bird is a hen, it will prove extremely restless, moving from perch
to perch continually and although it may call, it obviously will not sing.
As mentioned, a cock bird caged on its own will sing almost immediately
but to ensure that a non-singing bird is, in fact, a hen, it is prudent to
leave the bird caged on its own for at least two or three minutes as,
although I have yet to encounter a cock which did not sing within seconds
of being placed on its own, to be completely sure that a non-singing bird
is a hen, one should at least give it the opportunity to prove otherwise.
So accurate have I found this method of sexing that I can now sex a
cage of, say, ten birds within half an hour. It is preferable if the birds that
are about to be sexed are in full adult plumage, although I have known
young cock birds which were not in full adult plumage, which, when
placed on their own, at least attempted to sing.
All my young stock is housed in cages which can be divided down the
centre and the birds are easily segregated when one wishes to sex them.
Perhaps I should mention that the divider must be solid (mine are made
of plywood) as the bird placed on its own must not be able to see others
of its kind.
Song and display
Bicheno cocks are not often heard to sing unless caged on their own,
out of sight of other Bichenos (see above). Some young cocks from
approximately eight weeks old will sing even when in the company of
others (of either sex), but as they mature, the song is heard less frequently
until eventually many appear never to sing at all.
Some cocks, whilst the hen is incubating, will sing for lengthy periods,

however as soon as the hen appears, these cocks always cease to sing im-
mediately. Overall the species is not vocally inclined and those cocks
which are appear to be the exception.
The species is certainly active and between rest periods, non-breeding
birds are almost always on the move. At such times both sexes will call
continually. Morris (1958) describes the two call-notes thus: 'Lost-calling
is a plaintive twoooo-twoooo, social-calling (is) similar to that of the
Zebra Finch Poephila guttata .' The 'lost-calling' (or locating call) is loud
for such a small bird and when 30-40 Bichenos all give this call in the close
confines of a birdroom, the volume of sound can be quite considerable.
'Social-calling' (or contact-call) is much more subdued and as Morris
(loc cit) mentions, is similar to that of the Zebra Finch but quieter.
I have not witnessed the mating display as described by Morris (loc cit)
to its full extent. As mentioned in earlier notes on this species (Mobbs,
1985b), I have not witnessed the excessive bill-wiping described by Morris
and only occasionally have I witnessed cock birds taking up the courting
postures described. Never have I observed a cock bird singing while dis-
playing and from the many birds 1 have studied, I find it difficult to
believe that the song is used during courtship, but believe it is used only
for 'advertising'.
For those who do not have access to the paper by Morris, I include, in
its entirety, his description of the display of the cock Bicheno: 'The male
assumes a courting posture in which the plumage is fully fluffed, so that
the body appears spheroid, with no special differential erection of the
feathers of the type found in most other species. The bird crouches over
the perch, parallel to the female, with his head twisted towards her. In
this position he sings and beak-wipes; in order to perform the latter, he
does not have to move as far as he would if his courting posture was
similar to his more generalised stance. It seems as if the posture is itself
part of the beak-wiping; the bird performs the action so many times, that
he never, so to speak, quite straightens up again, until after the whole
courting phase is over.
'No dance movements were seen in this species...'.
Since my notes appeared on the grass-carrying sequence (Mobbs,
1985b), I have witnessed other cock birds in my collection carrying out
the procedure, so obviously it is part of the display of the Bicheno Finch

that I could find no reference in the literature to this procedure. Since
the notes appeared, I have, in fact, located one reference (Rutgers and
Norris, 1977), the details of which, although questionable, are quoted
here: 'The nuptial dance of the male takes place on the ground; he dances
around the female carrying a long blade of grass in his raised beak. He

Of the two races of Bicheno Finch, only the white-rumped is bred in
sufficient numbers for it to be secure in aviculture. Specimens of the
black-rumped race are in existence (in aviculture) but numbers appear to
be very limited and unless a concerted effort is made to breed from these
birds, the race could eventually be lost completely as it is doubtful if wild-
caught specimens will ever again be allowed out of Australia. It is possible
that there are black-rumped specimens in the possession of bird keepers
who do not even know they have what is obviously a rare subspecies. If
you keep Bichenos, take a look at their rump colour and if you find you
have a black-rumped bird, either attempt to breed from it or release it to
someone who will.
The Bicheno can prove extremely prolific and is easily bred in a roomy
box-type cage. Sexing can prove difficult but if the method described
above is used, the sex of one's birds should easily be determined.
A varied and substantial diet is essential, especially when chicks are
being reared; at such times, soaked seeds and egg food will be taken avidly
by the parent birds. Failure to supply an adequate diet may result in weak
undersized chicks and can also affect the plumage, i.e. lack of the black
breast bars.
To date there appears to be no colour mutation in the Bicheno Finch
even though fairly substantial numbers are bred each year in Europe.

Serinus scotops
By NEVILLE BRICKELL &amp; ANDREW GREEN
(Avicultural Research Unit, South Africa)
Alternative names for this species are the Natal Linnet, Striped Canary,
Sundevall's Seedeater and Grass Shelly. It is an active bird usually found in
pairs or small parties, keeping to the forest canopy and adjacent scrub and
exotic vegetation.
The population of the Forest Canary is arranged into three subspecies:
the male of the nominate race S. s. scotops has the forehead, crown, nape,
mantle and back bright olive green, heavily streaked with blackish green;
the rump and upper tail-coverts are olive green as is the tail which is edged
with black; the stripe over the eye is yellow, the ear-coverts green and chin
blackish; greater and lesser wing-coverts are blackish brown, edged with
yellow; the throat is yellow; the breast and belly green streaked with
blackish green; the under tail-coverts are yellow, the eye brown, the bill
horn and the legs and feet brownish. S. s. umbrosus is similar to S. s. sco-
tops but the upper parts are darker green, the rump olive green streaked
with blackish green. S. s. transvaalensis is also similar to S. s. scotops but
the lower throat and breast are darker and the flanks more heavily
streaked. The female of the nominate race resembles the male but differs
in having the underparts duller and more heavily streaked. Immature birds
resemble females but are duller.
The Forest Canary is restricted to South Africa. The nominate race is
to be found in the eastern Cape Province, Transkei and Natal (coastal and
lower midlands); S.s. umbrosus in southern Cape Province (coastal reg-
ions), Griqualand East, Natal, western Zululand and south-eastern Trans-
vaal; S. s. transvaalensis in the eastern and northern Transvaal (highlands),
and probably also western Swaziland.
The song of the male is a brisk warbling, interspersed with trills, being
similar to the Cape Canary Serinus canicollis but weaker and more high-
pitched. Normal call is a low tsik.
The Forest Canary feeds on the green seeds of weeds, berries and fruit.
It has been recorded eating the leaf petioles of the Sneezewood Tree
Praeroxylon obliquum and the fruits of Rubiaceae (gardenia family). In
the aviary they will take readily to a finch mixture (four parts yellow
manna, one part red manna, two parts canary and one part white millet&quot;
and insects, namely aphids and Black Mound Termite workers. Sweei
apple was supplied by Neville Brickell as a substitute for indigenous fruit

Greenfood in the form of chickweed and thistle must be given at least
once a week. Neville Bricked found that they were extremely partial to the
unripe seed of the Blackjack Bidens pilosa and will always appreciate
extras such as Khaki-weed Altemanthera pungens, Canary Creeper Senecio
tamoides, unripe sunflower seed, germinating seed, spray millet and seed-
ing wild grass heads. Andrew Green regularly fed the small yellow seed
heads of the Klein Geelbossie Senecio polyanthemoides which was relished
by the birds. When his birds were nesting Neville Bricked supplied insect-
ile and egg food daily. A great many aviculturists today use only the pro-
prietary breakfast cereal 'Pro Nutro' as a soft food with excellent results.
This species nests during the summer months, constructing a cup-
shaped nest in bushes or small trees, 1-5 m from the ground, in dense
cover. Both sexes carry material which consists of moss and various sorts
of vegetable down. The cup is lined with stringy lichen. An average clutch
comprises two to four, usuady three, white to bluish white eggs, spotted
with greys and browns, mainly at the thick end. The first recorded breed-
ing in captivity was registered with the society in 1952, followed by a
second in 1955 and a third in 1959, No data was made available. Neville
Bricked's aviary breeding in 1969 revealed that three eggs were laid. They
were incubated solely by the female for a period of 14 days. During incu-
bation the male fed the female, usually on the nest, but also away from
it when she left to bathe. The young were fed by both parents and re-
mained in the nest for 15 days after which they were not seen for seven
days as they had concealed themselves in an adjacent bush. A wicker
canary cup was used as a nest-site which had been thickly lined with
stringy pieces of coir. In September 1984 Andrew Green was successful
in rearing one chick which was hatched in a naturally built cup nest, situa-
ted under cover in the sleeping quarters. In a second attempt, which was
unsuccessful, a jam tin was utilised as a nest-site. In 1955 Mr. C.H. Russell
produced a hybrid between Serinus scotops and S. mozambicus.

NOTES ON THE RED HEADED FINCH Amadina ery throeephala
AND THE CUT-THROAT FINCH A. fasciata
By NEVILLE BRICKELL
(Avicultural Research Unit, South Africa)
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989821514285714" page_id="56953890"  page_num="96" year="" vol="">
Hall and Moreau (1970) consider these small seed-eating birds of the
weaver-finch family as belonging to the mannikin family. The above spe-
cies form the first of three logical species-groups: the African Silverbill
Lonchura malabarica and the Pearl-headed Silverbill L. grisecapilla form
another; the Bronze Mannikin L. cuculata , Red-backed Mannikin L. bi-
color and Pied Mannikin L. fringilloides form the third. The Red-headed
Finch has been given alternative names such as the Paradise Sparrow, Red-
headed Amadina and Red-headed Weaver-Finch and the Cut-Throat Finch
has also been called the Cut-throat Weaver, Cut-throat Amadina, Ribbon
Finch and Ribbon Weaver-finch.
These are common, highly gregarious species, living in pairs or small
flocks but outside the breeding season they gather into large flocks. The
typical mannikins favour moist, riparian fringing forests and dense thickets
whereas Cut-throats live mostly in dry acacia savanna and disused cultiva-
tion. They are very partial to dust bathing in the aviary and in the wild.
The identification of the nominate races has been described by a
number of researchers and therefore further comment is not necessary.
The race of Red-headed Finch A.e. dissita differs from the nominate race
in having the head a darker, more crimson red; the white spots on the ven-
tral surface larger and whiter; the black barring and fringing broader; wings
and tail darker and greyer. The female's upper parts are darker and greyer,
less warm brown; the crown feathers are more purplish, less reddish. The
race of Cut-throat Finch A.f alexanderi differs from the nominate race in
having broader barring both above and below. A.f meridionalis is similar
to A.f alexanderi and has a smaller bill. A.f contigua differs from A.f mer-
idionalis in being warmer and redder brown above; little or no buff on
the chin; breast and flanks more washed with russet buff. Females lack the
buff chin and red throat band; centre of belly white or cinnamon. Young
birds resemble the female, but males have a pale red band across the
throat.
The Red-headed Finch ranges from the Cape, Natal, Orange Free State
and Transvaal provinces of South Africa, South West Africa, Botswana,
western Zimbabwe to Angola. The Cut-throat Finch occurs in north-wes-
tern Orange Free State, eastern Swaziland, Natal, Zululand, southern Moz-
ambique, Zimbabwe, northern and north-eastern Botswana, northern

South West Africa and the Caprivi Strip, Malawi, Kenya, eastern Tanzania,
Uganda, Somalia, Ethiopia, south-eastern Sudan, northern Nigeria to
Senegal.
Cut-throats spend much of their time foraging on the ground feeding
mainly on seeds, but some insects are taken, especially flying termites. In
the aviary, besides the various kinds of seeds, they must be supplied
regularly with insects when nesting, namely mealworms, thrips larvae and
nymphs, bristle-tails, spring-tails or fish moths. Little interest may be
shown in green food except freshly cut lucerne and grass seedheads. It is
advisable to supply softfood such as hard-boiled egg, wholewheat bread or
moistened dog biscuit.
Cut-throats do not often build nests of their own, but are perfectly
capable of constructing an untidy ball of dry grass with a short tunnel
entrance at the side when choosing a tree, shrub or bush, or in a hole in a
building, the latter preferred by Red-headed Finches. The nest chamber is
lined with feathers, wool and other available soft materials. More often
they utilise the nests of other species. The Red-headed Finch is recorded
nesting in the deserted nests of the Little Swift Apus affinis, Buffalo
Weaver Bubalomis albirostris niger , Social Weaver Philetairus socius,
Masked Weaver Ploceus velatus inustus and Cape Sparrow Passer melanurus.
In captivity they are notorious for evicting other birds from their nest
chambers, regardless of whether they contain eggs or very young nestlings.
There is one record in the wild of a pair of breeding Social Weavers being
evicted and the Red-heads laying themselves. The Cut-throat Finch has
been recorded robbing the lining from one Buffalo Weaver's nest and
taking it into another; also a female repeatedly trying to enter the nest of
an incubating weaver. They also commonly use the abandoned nests of
species listed above with the addition of the Spotted-backed Weaver Plo-
ceus cucullatus, Red-billed Quelea Quelea quelea and a record in a wood-
pecker's hole. In the aviary they may be supplied with standard finch-type
nesting boxes containing some nesting material to entice the birds to use
them. They will introduce extra material themselves as well as adding more
throughout the incubation period. Both birds build, the male carrying and
the female arranging it in position. The Red-headed Finch lays 3-8,
usually 4-6 white eggs; incubation is shared by both sexes and lasts for 12-
14 days. The young are fed by both parents, remaining in the nest for 20-
23 days. Unfortunately the Cut-throat Finch is far more prone to egg-
binding than the Red-heads and it is, therefore, advisable, to encourage the
birds to breed during the warmer months. Aviary birds will quite readily
breed three times in a season, laying replacement clutches if robbed. Cut-
throat Finches lay four to six, nine on record, white eggs - the high figure

might, of course, be due to two females laying in the same nest; both
sexes incubate for 12-13 days, the young remain in the nest for 22-24
days. Adult plumage is attained at 70-75 days and they commence
breeding at eight to nine months old.
It is reported that captive Red-heads have been taught to talk, though
not as well as parrots. The crossing of the Red-headed Finch with the
Cut-throat Finch produces male hybrids which are fertile. The Red-headed
Finch has also been crossed with the Java Sparrow Padda oryzivora, the
Cut-throat Finch with Parson Finch Poephila cincta, African Silverbill
Euodice cantans, Indian Silverbill Euodice malabarica and Java Sparrow
Padda oryzivora. The most attractive crossing is the male Cut-throat
Finch and a female white Java Sparrow.

Following concern over the status of the Hooded Siskin Carduelis
cucullata in its native Venezuela, an attempt at surveying the captive
population of this delightful species was undertaken. Although a fairly
ambitious project, details of the proposed census were circulated, via
four regional collators, to many journals and individuals throughout the
world in the hope of obtaining as much publicity as possible for the
project.
Problems encountered were many, the most restrictive being the
language barrier but despite this, some valuable information has been
forthcoming, a summary of which is set out below.
For convenience the data has been divided into two sections:
CAPTIVE STATUS - attempts to summarise the populations for each
country from which information was received and is applicable to 1984,
data being requested for 1st January 1985; HUSBANDRY - attempts
to analyse the methods adopted by the various aviculturists who for-
warded details.

1984 proved to be four cocks and one hen from one pair. Total number
of birds is now three pairs and two odd males.
NORWAY. Does not seem to be represented. Enquires by H.R. Grastveit
to the country's eight bird societies proved negative.
DENMARK. On hearsay, represented in several collections with breeding
reported in one. Many letters written but practically no replies.
SWEDEN. Represented in at least one collection, that of U. Magnusson
who has several birds.
BRITAIN. Very few birds with a total population of less than a dozen.
Most are males in the hands of canary breeders but a pair owned by
H. Bfierie/y bred for the first time in 1984, rearing four (3/1).
WEST GERMANY. Details of the census were printed in several magazines
but only one reply was obtained, and that from an aviculturist who had
just obtained his pair. However, Dr. Joachim Steinbacher, editor of
Die Gefiederte Welt, states: T am now quite sure that we have in
Germany many hundreds of successful breeders.
ITALY. Through the co-operation of the Federazione Ornicoltori Italian!
who initially sent a list of 14 keepers/breeders, we were able to obtain
the only documented evidence provided by our returns, that the
Hooded Siskin is bred in quite substantial numbers, confirming a
generalisation made by Bruno Mancini in Cage and Aviary Birds (ref-
erence unknown).
Of the 14, replies from only three materialised but they do provide
an insight into how prolific the species can be with the correct manage-
ment techniques. One can only surmise that the species is well estab-
lished in Italy. Their achievements for 1984 are as follows:-

SPAIN. The only reply was received from Juliana Miralles Vila, via the
Federacion Ornitologica Venezolana. Success being achieved for the
previous 16 years with the 1984 season yielding 29 independent
young from six pairs. Although impossible to ascertain numbers, it
would appear from the above success, and various breeding accounts
which unfortunately lack numerical data, that its existence is well
established in Spain.
BELGIUM. No helpful replies but on hearsay it is believed to be exten-
sively bred.
HOLLAND. As for Belgium.
No replies were received from New Zealand, Japan, Malaya, Singa-
pore, Switzerland, Portugal, Hungary, Austria, East Germany or France.
However, in fairness, it must be said that in most cases the language
problem and lack of contacts were a considerable barrier. Despite the
problems, it is possible to get an idea of how the captive population stands.
Unlike the situation in the wild, numbers of the Hooded Siskin in captivity
seem to be on an upward trend, even if only in a limited number of
countries, and it is more than probable that the number held in captivity
exceeds the wild population.
The unsavoury practice of smuggling continues to be a threat to the
wild population and it is a situation that must not be condoned, but one
cannot help wondering whether the practice could be completely stamped
out if the Venezuelan authorities allowed the export of captive-bred, close-
rung birds, especially males, of which there seems to be a surplus and for
which there is most demand. Captive breeding could also, in time, satisfy
a local demand.
In response to our efforts, three Venezueland aviculturists sent in their
returns: between them they have 78 years' experience in keeping, and 53
years of breeding the Hooded Siskin, rearing 53 young in 1984. To ignore
this depth of experience in an endangered species' homeland, while trying
to save it from extinction seems shortsighted indeed.

To make the task of compilation simpler and information easier to pin-
point, material is placed under separate headings, roughly along the lines
of the questionnaire, but with additional data included where necessary.
History of stock. Where details have been divulged, it seems that most
owners obtained their breeding stock from established breeders. Certainly
in European countries at least the vast majority of birds, if not all, are now
captive-bred.
Identification. Many birds are close-rung, but it appears that in Italy,
breeders of the Hooded Siskin (and others?) are registered with the Feder-
azione Ornicoltori Italiani and given their own coded rings. Lattanzi was
the only one to give details on rings, his being put on during the sixth day.
Accommodation. The method favoured by ALL breeders was an indoor
environment, although Barnicoat did experiment with a completely cov-
ered outdoor aviary with some success. Indoor accommodation allows a
means of controlling temperature, if necessary, and eliminates problems
caused by dramatic changes of climate, and predators.
Cage sizes seemed unimportant as results were not proportionate to
space provided. Bertolini bred his birds in cages measuring 60 cm x 30 cm
x 30 cm which were presumably of the box type with a wire front. Only
Barnicoat and Brierley kept their birds in what could be considered flight
cages, and which had a minimum length of 180 cm; both have bred
young.
All others housed their birds in presumably box-type cages, the length
of which varied between 60 and 80 cm with height and depth roughly half
the length size. Only Lattanzi gave extra depth in proportion to length.
Most breeders keep their birds in a quiet, tranquil area to avoid dis-
turbance but Conde never found it necessary and kept his birds in the
kitchen, with all the accompanying noise and '...my birds still reproduce in
a most healthy manner'.
The subject of artificial light is only mentioned by Pontiggia who ex-
tends day length by about half an hour before dawn, starting at the
beginning of March to arrive at a maximum of an hour by the end of
April. This regime is kept up until the end of July.
Where heat is controlled, a range between 15-21*C seems to be pre-
ferred but several breeders allow it to drop much lower. Although fit birds
seem able to cope, as Pontiggia notes, health problems may be encoun-
tered, particularly in elderly birds.

which several authors give very detailed information. Pontiggia, who goes
into it very thoroughly, gives the following:

All give additional food during the breeding season, several provide it
just prior, as the birds approach breeding condition. Rivero suggests a
mixture of 65% bird seed, 10% rape, 10% niger and 5% each of turnip
seed, linseed and hemp. Conde feeds a mixture of one pound of rape, one
pound of oats and half a pound each of hemp and wheat germ, blended
in a liquidiser. Brierley gives a quarter of a teaspoon of a mixture of
linseed, hemp, teazle and a few groats, half a teaspoon of niger and rape
ad lib .
The provision of a soft food is practised by most, although Brierley
states that although his young were reared by canaries, they would not
touch egg food. Several formulae are given below:
Serine: 2 litres of milk mixed with 1 kilo of cornmeal and two eggs.
Vila: A paste with a base of breadcrumbs, soya flour and some seeds
such as niger and rape. Additional to this, Vitamin E, calcium and
Terramycin (oxytetracycline - an antibiotic) are included in the
breeding season. Extra water is added, if necessary to ensure the
mixture is not compacted.
Other items offered during breeding are: hard-boiled egg, chickweed,
lettuce (of which they seem to be extremely fond), watercress, dandelion,
green pepper, apple plus the usual cuttlefish 'bone' and mineralised grit.
Only Rivera mentions livefood - '. small portions of insects, such as
mealworms, are indispensable'.
Out of the breeding season, many feed 'standard' canary mixture, plus
greenfood and fruit. Lattanzi, however, feeds a mixture of six parts plain
canary, four parts niger, one part small hemp, one part linseed and half
a part each of teazle, chicory and lettuce seed.
Nest Receptacle. The most favoured receptacle seems to be a 'typical'
canary nest pan but the material from which this is made seems to differ
from country to country and is either of plastic, wood or wicker. Only
Pontiggia mentions the use of half open-fronted boxes; these he placed
high up, three to a cage.
Nesting material. The type used for canaries seems to be the most
favoured but moss, fine dried grass, plumber's hemp and horsehair are
also offered. Serino offers 'strings of jute which is usually enough to bring
females into breeding condition'.
Nest Construction. Carried out mainly by the female but behaviour is
variable with some males assisting.

Pairing. Rivero reports males to be polygamous and very active sex-
ually, both in the wild and in captivity. Most breeders keep their birds in
pairs but Pontiggia had one Very restless' male which he used to introduce
to a female when about to lay. In this way, he could get four hens to lay
almost together. Bertolini reports using 12 males with 15 breeding females.
Clutch Size. Ranges from three to five whitish eggs. Approximate size
15.8 mm by 12.2 mm (Rivero).
Number of Broods. Rivero gives the number of broods in the wild as
one or two. Captive pairs can have as many as four but three seems to be
the most usual for prolific pairs in an average breeding season of about five
months. Less prolific pairs may only have one or two. Generally it seems
that pairs kept as canaries are the most prolific in terms of broods, and
consequently numbers, reared.
Incubation. By female alone and lasts from 12-14 days.
Fertility. Only two breeders give statistics. Bertolini says 'in the region
of 80% while Pontiggia gives 'hatch percentage' as 85-95%. However,
where fertile eggs have been laid with others, percentage hatching seems to
have been very good. At present there seems little degeneration of stock.
Bertolini gives dead-in-shell as 3% but this must surely be an acceptable
level.
Progress of Chicks from Hatching. (Rivero) 'Young are born with
dark reddish skin, covered with fine grey down. For the first three to five
days, only the female feeds the young but after approximately the fifth
day the male helps with the feeding. When the male brings food to the
young, he gives a soft "call". The young, recognising this call, immediately
raise their heads and open their beaks to be fed. After the sixth day, the
young give small chirps or peeps in a tone that seems to be characteristic
of the species of the genus Carduelis.
'It is the female that cleans the nest from the first to approximately the
seventh or eighth day. After each feeding, the young face the centre of
the nest, depositing small faecal sacs on the edge of the nest. These are
picked up by the female and thrown out From about the eighth day
the young have grown sufficiently to expel the faecal sacs over the edge
of the nest'.
Some breeders found males to be excitable and removed them when
young were in the nest. Their eyes open at six days old and they fledge
at about 15 days, although Barnicoat gives 21 days for his birds.

Independence. This is achieved in 32-40 days but, as with most birds,
the young may continue to be fed for a time afterwards.
Sex Ratio of Young . Bias seems to favour males, with all except Pon-
tiggia having bred a surplus. However, in his return he states: 'After many
years of breeding, I have noticed that the youngsters are more hens than
males, approximately one male to three hens'.
Hand-rearing. Pat Demko was the only breeder to report hand-rearing,
and then only if necessary. In such cases she used Abba 92 nestling food,
finely sifted, adding hot water and a little hard-boiled egg yolk. A split
plastic band expander was used to feed with. Babies being hand-fed are
kept in a hospital cage at 90*F if unfeathered, gradually lowering the
temperature as they feather.
Fostering . Three breeders, Serino, Brierley and Barnicoat, use fosters
for both incubation and rearing while others have potential foster parents
on hand in case the need arises. Canaries are the most favoured, but Pon-
tiggia has also used Redpolls, siskins and, in 1983, even a rosefinch hen.
Conde likewise fostered when necessary and found Andean Siskins Car-
duelis spinescens the best mothers and Yellow-bellied Siskins C. xantho-
gastra the best fathers. Pontiggia remarks on the subject, 'In my opinion,
the true mother gives the chicks all the antibodies they need to grow
perfectly, therefore I try, if at all possible, to parent-rear and to keep in
the youngsters the feeding instinct'.
Hybrids. The crossing of male siskins with the canary to obtain the
much sought-after 'red factor' is well known but other hybrids are on re-
cord. Rivero believes that hybrids with the Andean Siskin occur naturally
where the ranges overlap. This cross has also been achieved by Serino while
Pontiggia in Italy crossed it with Goldfinch, Redpoll, Mexican Rosefinch and
Siskin, presumably using the Hooded Siskin as male parent. A male from
the Redpoll cross proved fertile when mated back to a female Redpoll.
Longevity. On average Pontiggia gives a five or six year life span and is
of the opinion that a diet of canary, pannicum and sunflower seeds give
the longest life. A ten-year old male, still very fertile, is cited by Bertolini.
An eight-year old hen is still in the collection of Pat Demko.
Ailments. Rivero devotes a whole chapter to the subject but most of
the illnesses mentioned seem to occur in newly caught specimens and for

the most part must be attributed to capture stress and resultant problems.
Only two returns touched on the subject of health: Pontiggia, with his
usual thoroughness, reports, 'Deaths usually happen, as with most birds, in
the very delicate period of the moult. It is well known that for specimens
not in good condition it is difficult to pass this vital period. A bad and
long moult is a symptom of not very good general condition and therefore
I do not use these specimens for future reproduction. It is generally three
to four year old birds that find the moult a trial.
'It can also happen that some youngsters show abdominal swelling. Any
birds showing symptoms are isolated and given only canary seed and let-
tuce. I think that it is possibly caused by an excessive preference for oily
seed, in particular niger and sunflower. Normally in this way, after about
20 days, specimens come back to normality. However, they are kept under
examination and if possible not used for breeding.
'Some deaths in winter are due to difficulty with respiration (usually
in old birds). 1 think this is due to a cold temperature of 2-3*C and also to
sudden changes in temperature. In these cases, I try to intervene, bringing
it up to about 10-11*C.
'However, I consider losses of 9-10% normal and therefore do not give
medicines'.
Rivero cites 'abdominal inflammation' as a cause of death, giving it as
'the most common and typical illness of Red Siskins', but gives no solution
other than antibiotics.
Vila relates that deaths are attributed to no specific illness and that
they generally appear to be stronger than canaries. Lack of notes by
others would suggest a relatively trouble-free species, if managed properly.
Precautionary Treatments. Only Pontiggia mentions giving a preventa-
tive prior to the breeding season. At about the end of February/early
March, a two-week course of Bimixim antibiotic is given and to avoid the
use of anti-acari insecticide powder, Tabar stripe insecticide is used in the
birdroom, changed on average once a month.

On 1st June 1986, members and their guests were again welcomed by
Miss Ruth Ezra and Mr. Raymond Sawyer, in the beautiful grounds of
Chestnut Lodge. The weather was overcast, but remained dry and warm as
Raymond escorted us around the superbly landscaped gardens and aviaries.
The wide spectrum of bird families represented ensures that there is
interest for everyone, however specialised their avicultural tastes. The
species breeding included Violet Touracos for the third year, Stella Lory
and Satyr Tragopans. A delightful pair of White-breasted Rail was es-
corting a brood of chicks, three pairs of Avocets were incubating as well
as Black-winged Stilts.
In the range of garden aviaries, hopes were high to repeat previous
successes with Rothschild's Myna, Emerald and Amethyst Starlings. A
pair of Double-toothed Barbets in immaculate condition was much ad-
mired, and another interesting and unusual species to be seen was the Kea,
young having been bred in 1984 and 1985. The variety of species exten-
ded from a Cock-of-the-Rock to sunbirds, Mot-mots, Long-tailed Sibias
and Malayan Crested Jays. A pair of Golden Heart Doves was incubating,
Stanley and Demoiselle Cranes had eggs and the Brent Geese had produced
their annual six goslings. They parade by the pool they share with a
magnificent flock of flamingos.

Once again we are deeply grateful to Miss Ezra, our President, and
to Raymond Sawyer, for inviting members to what has become our most
popular social event. As always the gardens were looking immaculate and
with each year, the landscaping becomes even more attractive as shrubs,
trees and herbaceous borders mature. After our tour round the birds,
during which members saw much to admire and photograph, Miss Ezra
entertained us to a most delicious and lavish tea. Members enjoyed the
opportunity to sit on in the garden talking and it was very pleasant to
meet some new members and members who had travelled great distances
to be with us, the furthest coming from Scotland. Even the weather was
kind to us and the rain that had threatened all the afternoon, did not start
to fall until the last guest was leaving. Miss Ezra most generously donated
the proceeds from the ticket sales to our funds and the total raised,
including donations, was #148 for which we are particularly grateful as
the Society's finances are always in a parlous state. Our thanks again to

LONDON ZOO - 1985
By PETER OLNEY
Curator of Birds
1985 was in many ways a difficult year and this was reflected in a
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.998185032258065" page_id="56953904"  page_num="110" year="" vol="">
reduction in number of species and individuals bred compared with pre-
vious years. There was considerable disturbance in the Zoo during the
breeding season because of demolitions and other essential work. This
caused some necessary moving of birds within the collection, and indeed
out of the collection. Disturbance and movements, coupled with an un-
usually long, cold spring with its relatively short days and low tempera-
tures, produced an overall reduction in breeding.
However, among the 149 individuals and 35 species successfully bred,
there were some of particular interest and value. Perhaps the most signifi-
cant was the hand-rearing of three Congo Peafowl This shy, &amp;apos;ground-
haunting pheasant which occurs in the rainforests of eastern Zaire is a
close relative of the Asiatic Peafowl, and is the only true pheasant in
Africa. Most remarkably, it was not discovered until 1936 when J.P. Chapin
found two mounted specimens in the Congo Museum in Tervueren, Bel-
gium. They had been wrongly identified as the Blue Peafowl and were
assumed to be birds escaped from captivity, but Chapin realised that they
were a species new to science for which he, on the evidence of one feather,
had been searching for 23 years.
At present there are only 60-70 of these birds in 12 zoos and collec-
tions, and ours are the only ones on public display in Britain. All Congo
Peafowl in captivity belong to Antwerp Zoo who, as part of a co-operative
breeding programme, generously lent birds to a number of selected zoos
and collections. The parents of the three bred here arrived in November
1984, and had laid their first clutch by May 1985. As the birds will re-lay,
eggs were taken away and artificially incubated. Four hatched, and three
were successfully reared. The incubation period was 28, 27, 27 and 30
days. The last egg was in a different incubator and the 30 days' incubation
period may be abnormal - the chick had to be assisted out of the egg and
was never a strong bird, eventually dying after 29 days.
Other noteworthy breeding successes included the artificial incubation
and hand-rearing of eight Black-footed Penguins (our best year yet), two

There has been a good crop recently of books dealing with particular
groups of what I can only describe as water birds, though I think there
must be a better definition, and most of them are from the publishing
house of Croom Helm who continue to produce books of a very high
standard at what are reasonable prices today.
SEABIRDS: An Identification Guide
Text and illustrations by Peter Harrison. Croom Helm (first published
1983, revised edition 1985). ISBN 0-7099-3787-3, Price: #19.95. 448
pages. 88 colour plates. 324 distribution maps? line drawings.
This book is a wonderful example of what one-track mindedness can
achieve. Peter Harrison has been interested in seabirds for over 20 years
and has been planning this comprehensive guide for almost as long. In
1973 he set out on a seven-year expedition to gather material, visiting all
the major seabird areas of the world, and spent several years as a deckhand
aboard trawlers and crayfishing boats where seabirds could be more easily
studied and sketched.
The result is a very impressive and important book which has already
become the standard work on seabirds. The original edition won the
Best Bird Book of the Year award in 1983 and this revised edition includes
much new information.
The 88 coloured plates depict almost 300 species and nearly every
major colour and plumage phase is shown in the 1600 paintings. Of neces-
sity the plates are rather crowded, averaging 20 and in some nearly 30

drawings. One can see that to have allowed more space would have greatly
increased the number of colour plates and therefore the price and, in fact,
one's eye soon gets used to selecting a particular bird from the rest on the
page.
The families covered comprise: Penguins, Divers/Loons, Grebes, Alba-
trosses, Petrels and Shearwaters, Storm-petrels, Diving-petrels, Tropicbirds,
Pelicans, Gannets and Boobies, Cormorants, Frigatebirds, Phalaropes,
Sheathbills, Skuas, Gulls, Terns and Noddies, Skimmers, Auks and Sea-
ducks. Each species is described in detail and has a two-colour distribution
map indicating breeding, non-breeding and migratory distribution. There is
a very comprehensive bibliography..
As Roger Tory Peterson sums up in his introduction to this work: 'It
is doubtful whether any other ornithologist or birder can match the num-
ber of seabirds that Harrison has actually seen in life. Of the approximate
312 species, he has had field experience with all but 30. We salute him for
his industry and artistry in producing this book which will give us much
information and pleasure.'
This masterly and attractively produced summary of such a diverse and
often elusive group cannot be too highly recommended.

knowledge of this great group of birds. The author, who is a founding
member of the Center for the Study of Whales and Dolphins, has com-
bined his extensive field observations (which include ten years in the
merchant navy) with a deep concern for the environmental problems and
an awareness of the latest discoveries in the study of ocean birds. The
interesting and very readable text is grouped under the following chapter
headings: Evolution and classification; Properties of Ocean Birds; Sea-

The auks, or Alcidae (Great Auk, Razorbill, Dovekie, Common and
Thick-billed Murre, Black Guillemot and Atlantic Puffin), comprise one of
the most specialised but also extremely diverse groups of seabirds, exhibit-
ing a fascinating range of form and ecological adaptations. Moreover they
are the seabirds most vulnerable to man&amp;apos;s activities, especially oil pollu-
tion, and hence are of great concern to conservationists. The last 10-15
years have seen an enormous amount of work on the auks, including a
number of long-term field studies. This book summarises for the first time
the information gained on breeding biology, population ecology, evolution
and conservation of this group. As the authors point out, as well as being
interesting in their own right, the auks have proved useful as model species
with which to explore many themes and problems in ecology and evolu-
tion.

SHOREBIRDS: An Identification Guide to the Waders of the World
By Peter Dayman, John Mar chant and Tony Prater. Groom Helm. 416
pages, 88 colour plates, distribution maps and line drawings. ISBN 0-
7099-2034-2. Price: #19.95.
We are told that birdwatching is now one of the most popular leisure
activities in Britain, over one million people being estimated to be involved.
Very large numbers also watch birds in North America and western Europe
and substantial numbers elsewhere in the world. Wetlands are a major hab-
itat to which birdwatchers are drawn because a greater variety and number
of birds congregate there and of these waders form a substantial number
of species present. This group of birds is probably more international than
any other, for many waders undertake enormous migrations and vagrants
can occur almost anywhere in the world. It is, therefore, one of the most
confusing groups of birds and there has long been a need for a really com-
prehensive identification guide. This book has been produced in the same
format as Peter Harrison's Seabirds: An Identification Guide (reviewed
above) and as there is some overlap in the species, the two books together
cover all the Charadriiformes. Herons, cranes and ibises are not included.
The text by John Marchant and Tony Prater is thorough and well-
researched, and four-colour maps clearly show breeding and non-breeding
distribution areas. Over 1800 paintings are included in the 88 colour plates

by Peter Hay man and whilst overcrowding could again be a criticism, the
additional identification information -that accompanies each plate is in-
valuable and by using this book, wader watchers will not only be able to
identify species easily, but also the birds' sex, age and racial origin. There
are also many attractive line drawings.
In its scope and detail this book is unique, tremendous value for money
and again, like its companion volume, highly recommended. I just wish
that the publishers had put a weather-proof cover on both volumes since
they will obviously spend most of their lives in and out of bird watchers'
pockets.

THE HERONS HANDBOOK
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99721125" page_id="56953908"  page_num="114" year="" vol="">
By James Hancock and James Kushlan. Groom Helm. ISBN 0-7099-3716-4.
Price #16.95. 288 pages. 65 colour plates painted by Robert Gillmor and
Peter Hayman; 21 line drawings; 61 distribution maps.
This is based on The Herons of the World, published in 1978, but the
text has been completely revised and enlarged and there are four extra
plates. It has been produced in a more popular, less expensive form (its
predecessor cost #46.00 eight years ago!) without loss of quality.
The book is worth buying just for the coloured plates, one of each
species, which are outstanding and a feast for Robert Gillmor's many
admirers, and Peter Hayman's work here too is excellent. The four plates
extra to the original are by Robert Gillmor and depict 60 white herons
and egrets of 11 species, showing subspecies, seasonal plumages and bare-
parts coloration, which it is hoped may help to sort out the problems of
Identifying white birds in the field.
The 60 species of herons, egrets and bitterns that make up the family
Ardeidae are represented on every continent and many quite closely
related and similar-looking species are spread throughout the world. The
Herons Handbook will be an invaluable aid to identification as well as
summarising all that is currently known about this elegant and interesting
group.
As well as general chapters on classification, courtship, feeding and
identification, each species is described in detail under the headings of
identification, distribution and population (with a map showing range),
migration, habitat, behaviour, nest, eggs and young, and there is a
superb bibliography which must be the most comprehensive ever pre-
pared on this family.
This is a really excellent and superbly illustrated book, and amazing
value for money.

species. The information given on individual species is very full and
really must contain everything that anyone would need to know about
each crane. The many line drawings that illustrate the book, including the
individual species accounts, are very delicate and most attractive -1 assume
the artist is the author but cannot find any attribution. The bibliography
contains more than 400 references to articles and books about cranes and
it was gratifying to find a liberal sprinkling from the AviculturalMagazine.
Any publication that increases the sum of our knowledge of these
curious, beautiful and awe-inspiring birds can only help to ensure their
survival which at the moment is extremely precarious. The International
Crane Foundation, based in Baraboo, Wisconsin, USA, has quite rightly
endorsed this book.
RIVER BIRDS: Bird Life from Mountain Stream to Estuary.
By Roger Lovegrove and Philip Snow. Columbus Books. ISBN 0-86287-
093-3. #10.95; 128 pages; 48 watercolour and 60 line drawings.
This is a completely different book from any of the previous works
reviewed here, being a part-lyrical, but factual account of the progress of
the River Severn from source to sea, describing the birdlife encountered in
the many different habitats along its length. The many scenes are brought
to life through the very skilful illustrations. It is an ingenious idea, attrac-
tively realised by an harmonious partnership of author Roger Lovegrove,
who is RSPB officer for Wales and a regular contributor to radio and tele-
vision, and young artist Philip Snow whose work has already become well-
known through successful exhibitions.
This book would make a most welcome gift for anyone the least bit

Major Work in German

<bodyText confidence="0.993065666666667" page_id="56953910"  page_num="116" year="" vol="">
Those able to read German will find a feast of valuable information in
the long-awaited Lexikon der Vogelhaltung. Its 678 pages are packed with
hundreds of excellent coloured photographs and line drawings of a large
proportion of the birds likely to be found in aviculture.
Arranged in dictionary form, as the title suggests, the entries cover
dozens of genera with details of representative forms; for example, that
for Amazona Parrots covers eight pages with four coloured photographs
and one line drawing. Avicultural information is not confined to Germany
but covers many other countries, including the U.K.
There are also entries for aviculturists and ornithologists, alive and
dead, also for general subjects such as feather-plucking. Forty-eight special-
ists contributed to the Lexikon ; most are German writers, exceptions
being Dr. George Archibald, Otto Bernasek, Dr. R. Burkard and Rosemary
Low.
Produced in East Germany and edited by Dr. Franz Robiller, this au-
thoritative and absorbing work costs 98 marks, plus postage, or 40 US dol-
kars, from Buchexeport der DDR, VE Aussenhandelsbetrieb, Leninstrasse
16, Leipzig, DDR 7010.
It is hoped to find an English publisher so that the vast amount of
knowledge accumulated within its pages will have a wider readership.

Malcolm Ellis, who has a special interest in African birds, writes:
Many members must have wondered who was Fischer! It must be
doubtful that there are any members who are unfamiliar with Fischer's
Lovebird and Fischer's Whydah is quite well-known among aviculturists.
Less well-known are Fischer's Touraco, Fischer's Greenbul, Fischer's
Starling and Fischer's Sparrow Lark.
All of these bear the name of their discoverer Gustav Adolf Fischer.
Born in Barmen, in March 1848, Fischer studied medicine and natural
sciences at the Universities of Bonn, Berlin and Wurzburg, joined the
medical corps of the German Army and in 1876 obtained indefinite leave
to devote himself to African exploration.
Fischer made several expeditions in East Africa and collected on the
island of Zanzibar, where for four years he worked as a medical prac-
titioner. Fischer was the first white man to reach Lake Naivasha, in what
is now Kenya, and wrote that flocks of Egyptian Geese, about 50 strong,
were commonly met with on the marshy shores and described hearing the
loud joyous call of the Fish Eagle. Young Maasai warriors prevented that
expedition continuing northwards and on the return journey to the coast,
Fischer found Lake Natron where he saw Black Terns (there seems to be
no modern record of Black Terns occurring at Lake Natron), herons,
flamingos and pelicans, and he collected the first specimens of the Chest-
nut-banded Sand Plover.
Of the birds collected during that expedition, 36 species were described
as new and Reichenow named several of them after Fischer. Fischer's
Lovebird was described first from Ussure, in what is now Tanzania.
Although it does not bear his name, the Golden-winged Sunbird is another
of Fischer's discoveries.
Fischer died 11th November 1886, shortly after returning from another
expedition to Africa.
Opened in 1969 as a game-viewing lodge, Ngulia Lodge in Tsavo West
National Park, Kenya, has become unique in Africa as a site for the study
of the spectacular southward passage of northern migrants. It was the
game-viewing lights at Ngulia which first revealed that this lodge is on the
route used by vast numbers of southbound migrants.
On misty nights, between late October and January, when the moon
has yet to rise or has already set, the lights of this lodge attract down
thousands of migrants and these settle on trees, on and in the buildings,
the garden and sometimes even carpet the ground itself.

By 1981, 52,000 Palaearctic migrants had been ringed at Ngulia.
Almost 82% comprised Marsh Warblers, Whitethroats and Sprossers
(Thrush Nightingales). Others had included Little Bitterns, an Eleonora's
Falcon, Corncrakes, Eurasian Nightjars, Rufous Bush Chats, Iranias (White-
throated Robins), Nightingales, River Warblers, Spotted Flycatchers and
Red-backed Shrikes.
In the East Africa Natural History Society's Bulletin (November/Dec-
ember, 1985), a correspondent reported how, at dusk on 20th November,
a ringer arrived to join the ringing group at Ngulia, having just seen a flock
of up to 400 Eastern Red-footed Falcons going to roost on trees along a
nearby road.
The following day a flock of several hundred, with many European
Rollers, was watched hawking insects, possibly termites. The next day
several parties of eagles, mainly Lesser Spotted with a few Steppe Eagles
among them, were observed feeding on termites as these emerged from
their holes. Twenty-nine eagles were counted in one group and the total
was probably near 40.
Who holds the world record for the most bird species seen in a single
day? In 'News and Views' (Vol. 90,No. 4), Malcolm Ellis reported that
three ornithologists had claimed this record for Kenya, with their tally
of 290 species seen there in one day. This claim was challenged by Greg-
ory S. Toffic in this column (Vol. 91, No. 3), who stated that this record
belongs to Ted Parker and Scott Robinson, who identified 331 species in
a day's birding at the Cocha Cashu Biological Station in south-eastern
Peru.
Malcolm Ellis has relayed this information to Terry Stevenson in Kenya
in the hope that either he or Don Turner will respond to this challenge to
their claim. One which they bettered later in a sponsored count for
charity; on that occasion a team led by Terry Stevenson counted 308
species, but failed to check in on time and the first team to reach Nairobi's
famous Norfolk Hotel, the team led by Don Turner, logged 304 species.

BREEDING PALLAS'S SANDGROUSE

By ROGER WILKINSON (Curator of Birds)
and NICK MANNING (Senior Keeper)
In an article in the Avicultural Magazine in 1929, David Seth-Smith
described the Sandgrouse thus: The Sandgrouse (Pteroclidae), form a
very distinct family of game-birds, showing certain affinities to the Pig-
eons. They are purely terrestrial, possessing very short legs and long
pointed wings, and inhabiting desert countries where they feed upon the
seeds of various grasses and other plants. Their plumage is mostly of a
sandy or buff colour, harmonizing with the surroundings in which they
occur. The tarsi and, in some cases, the toes also, are feathered, They are
mostly migratory and their flight is extremely rapid and powerful. They
nest on the ground, the nest consisting as a rule of a mere scrape in the
sand, and the eggs, three to a clutch, are smooth and glossy, rounded at
both ends, with brownish surface spots overlying pale purplish markings
beneath the surface of the shell. Both sexes undertake the duties of
incubation, the female sitting by day and the male at night, and the
young, which are covered with down and beautifully marked, are reared
on small seeds.
'Pallas's Sandgrouse is one of two species distinguished by the absence
of a hind toe. It occurs in Central Asia and is subject, for some unknown
reason to occasional migrations to Western Europe such as occurred in
1863 and again in 1888 when great numbers spread over Europe and
reached the western coasts of the British Isles.
'The plumage of the male is sandy with rusty-red throat, a white
band flecked with black across the breast, and a large black patch on
the abdomen. The female has the sides of the neck spotted with black,
a black line below the reddish-buff throat, and no band across the breast.'

In April 1985 Chester Zoo received five Pallas's Sandgrouse from Rot-
terdam Zoo, Holland. Although imported as unsexed birds it was evident
soon after arrival that these were four males and one female. Following
quarantine, these were housed in an outside aviary 4.5 x 4.5 x 2.2 m,
shared with a pair of Maroon-tailed Conures Pyrrhura melanura. The birds
were provided with a diet of large millet, wheat, poultry breeder/grower
pellets, insectivorous mixture, finely chopped salad and fruit.
Only 16 days after being placed in their new quarters, a Sandgrouse egg
was found on the ground in a corner of the aviary. A slight depression in
the sand indicated a nest scrape but this remained unlined. Two days later,
a second egg and on the following day a third egg were found. The first egg
had been removed immediately for artificial incubation but we awaited
completion of the clutch before removing together the second and third
eggs. The adults showed little interest in the eggs and no attempt at incu-
bation.
A second clutch was laid in early July and the eggs were again removed
for artificial incubation. At that time we decided that, should a third
clutch be laid, we would leave these in situ in the hope that the parents
would show more attention than with the first clutch. However, after the
first two eggs were soaked following a torrential downpour of rain, we
reversed our decision and removed both eggs to the incubator, the third
was also removed on the day after laying. The eggs were greenish-grey in
colour, blotched with brown and the five measured ranged from 43-45 mm
x 32-34 mm.
The subsequent fate of these artificially incubated eggs is tabulated
overleaf; two of three eggs in the first clutch were hatched and successfully
reared, two of the second clutch hatched but failed to survive and all three
eggs in the third clutch were found to be addled.
The eggs were set (unwashed) in a still air incubator (Brinsea Polyhatch)
at a temperature of 39-39.25*C and a humidity similar to that for incuba-
ting pheasant eggs. The eggs were turned (automatically) hourly until the
21st day of incubation when they were removed to a dry hatcher at 38.5*C.
Once the eggs pipped or broke into the air-space, the humidity was in-
creased to a minimum of 60%. Those eggs that hatched did so very rapidly,
the process of hatching taking only a few hours.
The calculated incubation period of 25-26 days is less than that of 28
days reported for Pallas's Sandgrouse in the wild (Cramp, 1985) or pre-
viously in an incubator (Witherby et al, 1940).
The newly-hatched chicks were allowed to remain in the hatcher for
24 hours before being removed to a brooder box. The temperature was
maintained at 35*C for the first three days in the brooder then gradually
lowered over the next few weeks.

The chicks were fed chick mash (dampened then mixed to form fine
crumbs), finely diced carrot and apple, chopped lettuce and grated hard-
boiled egg; small mealworms were also relished. Chick grit was mixed with
the food from the second day and water supplied In a shallow trough. At
four weeks old millet was introduced into the diet, followed by wheat at
six weeks.
The facial markings of the young male were distinct before he reached
three months. The second chick proved to be a female which, when
paired with an adult male in 1986, laid eggs from which two chicks were
hatched. One of these, a female, was successfully reared and, with the
loss of one adult male last winter, we now have a group of four males and
three females.
Our stock was captive bred at Rotterdam Zoo where Pallas's Sand-
grouse have been bred since 1980. The International Zoo Yearbooks
report an earlier success in 1979 at East Berlin Zoo but we have been
unable to find any previous records of Pallas's Sandgrouse being bred in
the United Kingdom.

BREEDING THE COBALT-WINGED PARRAKEET
Brotogeris cyan op ter a

Early last year we purchased two of these South American parrakeets,
each from different sources. The cock bird was in very good condition,
but the hen, having been kept on seed only, looked very poorly. Her
feathers were dull, she was very thin and her beak and claws were over-
grown. After veterinary treatment and the correct diet of mainly fruit,
with Parrot Mix, Budgerigar seed, boiled egg yolk and vegetables, she
soon recovered.
We considered ourselves very lucky to have purchased a pair of these
birds, as it is almost impossible to tell their sex by sight, the coloration and
size appearing identical although the yellow on the cock's forehead is per-
haps a little brighter. Our birds got on well from the beginning and were
soon feeding each other.
As we believe in keeping our birds indoors, rather than exposed to all
weathers, we installed the Cobalt-winged Parrakeets in the spare bedroom,
along with a pair of African Greys and a pair of Jardine's Parrots. Their

cage measures 2 ft x 1 Vi ft x \Vi ft (0.60 x 0.46 x 0.46 m)with a nest-box
attached to the outside measuring internally 5 x 5 x 8 in (0.13 x 0.13 x
0.20 m). The nest-box is not upright but angled at 45*. Peat is used to
line the bottom and a trap door is cut into the front for inspection.
We were soon rewarded with four eggs and after 30 days, when we
thought that they had gone over their time and all was lost, the first chick
hatched on 18th July (1985). We could not believe our luck when the
other three hatched during the next few days.
Although the hen appeared to be feeding the chicks well(we added
more fruit and egg yolk to the diet) we were worried that the last pair
harched would eventually be neglected as these were quite a bit smaller.
We decided, therefore, to take all the chicks and hand-rear them.
They grew very quickly, their eyes opening at about 10 days, and
the quills soon appeared under the skin. The rearing food consisted of
baby food (Milupa Winter Vegetables), Heinze baby pure fruit, shelled
sunflower seeds, and calcium tablets with vitamin D. All this is put in
the liquidiser with boiled water and mixed to a not-too-runny consis-
tency.
They had been kept in a temperature of 80* F, which was lowered
gradually over a few days when they were fully feathered. They began
to eat fruit on their own and managed to demolish whole apples, which
had been sliced, leaving just the skin. They eventually ate seed as well
but still preferred the fruit.
Since then we have had a few failures with clear eggs, or fertile eggs
not hatching, but another chick was hatched on 13th October 1985,
which was hand-reared and at the moment (July 1986) we have three
more chicks who have just left the brooder and are flying but refuse
to eat on their own, so we are quite pleased with the number we have
reared and hope that our pair of Cobalt-winged Parrakeets will go on
laying and producing such delightful little birds.
As described above, the Cobalt-winged Parrakeet Brotogeris cyanoptera has
been bred by Mr. and Mrs. Clarke and this is believed to be the first success in
this country. Anyone knowing of a previous breeding in Great Britain or Northern
Ireland, or of any other reason that would disqualify this claim, is asked to inform
the Hon. Secretary.

SOME NOTES ON BIRD MARKETS, PIGEON KEEPING
AND OTHER BIRD/MAN RELATIONS IN CHINA

These notes are concerned mainly with bird markets in the People's
Republic of China, but will embrace one or two other aspects of man
bringing birds into captivity: pigeon racing, the pigeon fancy, pigeon
whistles, cormorant fishing, and birds in traditional medicine.
In an earlier issue of the AviculturalMagazine I published an article on
birds in Chengdu Zoo (Boswall, 1986).
The only recently published article that I know of which deals with
Chinese aviculture as such is that of Travnicek (1986), a United States
aviculturist who toured five major cities in mainland China and visited
bird markets, pet shops and zoos. He presents much interesting infor-
mation.
The bird names in this paper are mainly those of Meyer de Schauensee
(1984).
Bird markets in Beijing
So many earlier writers on Chinese ornithology (notably Wilder and
Hubbard, 1924) quote from their visits to Chinese bird markets that in
1983 I sought out the largest of the three markets known to be in Bei-
jing. It was at Guan Yuan. Unfortunately I could spend only 10 minutes
there on 2nd May, but was able to identify Budgerigar Melopsittacus
undulatus, Canary Serinus canaria, Red-billed Leiothrix or Peking Robin

Woodcock Scolopax rusticola. There was also a species of tit, probab-
ly Marsh Tit Pams palustris and a small Accipiter , possibly nisus. The
Red-billed Magpies were half-grown nestlings.
On 21st May 1983 I returned to the market and attempted a complete

census. Thirty-seven Budgerigars and six Canaries were for sale. With the
possible exception of the Quails, of which there were five adults and five
halfgrown young ones, and perhaps the 11 Peking Robins, all the other
birds were almost certainly wild-taken.

1951), plus the fact that there were none in the market on 2nd May, can
be taken as indicating that a number of species are not only wild caught
but recently caught. It also seems probable that most are locally caught,
positive exceptions being only the Hwamei (or Brown Laughingthrush)
Garmlax canorus (two birds), the Mongolian Lark (17 adults, c. 40 nest-
lings) and (if wild caught) the Peking Robins. These species do not occur
naturally in the vicinity of Beijing.
The number of other species were: four Coal Tits Pams ater six prob-
able Marsh Tits, one possible Willow Tit P. montanus, one Great Tit
R major , 29 Eurasian Siskins, 18 Yellow-billed Hawfinches (also known as
Black-tailed Hawfinches) Eophona migratoria, 23 Hawfinches, two Shore
Larks Eremophila alpestris , one Common Skylark Alauda arvensis, two
Crested Larks Galerida cristata, two possible Asian Short-toed Larks
Calandrella cheleensis , two Brown Shrikes Lanius cristatus, one Blue-
throat Erithacus secicus , one possible Thick-billed Reed Warbler Acro-
cephalus aedon, one Tree Sparrow, one male and two female Black-faced
Buntings Emberiza spodocephala, one female Yellow-browed Bunting
E. chrysophrys, two male Yellow-throated Buntings E. elegans , five un-
identified buntings (Emberizidae), five Mealy Redpolls Carduelis flammea ,
seven unidentified Fringillids, and one other unidentified passerine.
Anthony Galsworthy, on a visit to the same market the next day,
22nd May, recorded the following less usual species: White-throated
Rock Thrush Monticola gularis , Blue Rock Thrush ML solitarius philip-
pensis , Pere David's Laughingthrush (or Peking Hill Babbler) Garmlax
davidi , Chinese Sparrowhawk Acdpiter soloensis , Eagle Owl Bubo bubo ,
Thick-billed Shrike Lanius tigrinus , Tristram's Bunting Emberiza tristrami
and Japanese (or Masked) Hawfinch Eophona per sonata, in addition
to several of the species I recorded above. His visit was on a Sunday when
apparently more cage bird enthusiasts appear than on the other days of
the week.
On 21st May, 30 yuan (then about #10) was asked for a Hwamei, and
20 yuan for a Mongolian Lark. These two species are the first and second
most popular native cage birds in China. A Yellow-billed Hawfinch cost
3 yuan and a Brown Shrike or a bunting Vi yuan.
Most birds were displayed in cages, usually rather small, sometimes
overcrowded. A few individuals (often hawfinches) had string halters
and were tethered to a stick. One stall-holder had tied together with a
piece of string the wings of each of his birds. The knot was across the tips
of the primaries. Another had taped the beaks of several hawfinches.
Three years later, on Sunday, 16th June 1986, starting at 10.30, I

Cages at Guan Yuan bird market, Beijing, 2nd May 1983. The lower cage contains
two Accipiters,
spent an hour counting the birds in the same market. Setting aside the
domestic Common Quail, there were 431 birds of 39 species (33 of which
were specifically identified). Sixty-five (15%) were Budgerigars, 57 (13%)
were Zebra Finches Taeniophgia guttata, 51 (12%) were Hwameis, 47
(11%) were Mongolian Larks, 28 (6%) 'other' larks, and 38 (9%) were
Canaries. There were only 11 (2.5%) Chestnut-flanked White-eyes Zos-
terops erythropleura , 11 (2.5%) Peking Robins and 6 (1.5%) parrots.
Such a market as this merits a detailed study, since data of seasonal
occurrence and breeding season can be inferred - see McClure and Chai-
yaphun (1971) who undertook systematic censuses at the Bangkok bird
market in Thailand.
The two smaller bird markets in Beijing are at Longtang Hu and
Qiaoyang Men.
The only other recent observations I know of are those of Travnicek
(1986), Fiebig (1983) who lists 36 species in a Beijing bird market, and
Beecroft (in press) who visited three or four bird markets in China. Earlier
Wilder and Hubbard (1924) often cited records of birds in markets to help
assess passage periods and relative abundance.
I am indebted to Anthony Galsworthy for the following note on the
effects of the Cultural Revolution on bird markets. He writes: 'So far as

Seller with Azure-winged Magpie Cyanopica cyana
I know the bird markets in Peking disappeared in about 1966, and only
restarted in the mid-seventies. During the Cultural Revolution any hobby
or other activity which detracted from a rigid attention to politics was
frowned on. I can recall newspaper criticism of 'the evil wind of goldfish
rearing 5 and 'the evil wind of pigeon fancying 5 . It seems unlikely that the
rearing of cage birds fared any better, although some people must have
continued in what little privacy then remained in their own homes. At the
same time the habit of attaching whistles to domestic pigeons disap-
peared - from 1968 to 1972 I never heard pigeon whistles in Peking. They
are now common again: a flight of pigeons with whistles, sounding like
an attacking Stuka, often causes consternation as it passes over the British
Embassy tennis courts! Pigeon whistles can now be bought again at bird
markets, and are being manufactured again in the traditional way.' Pigeon
whistles are dealt with later in this article.
Chengdu , Sichuan , bird markets
On Sunday, 18th May 1986, I went to the larger of two Chengdu bird
markets - the one at Qingyanggong. With the aid of William W. Thomas I
attempted a census of all the birds present.
Of the 22 species on offer, one was presumably for food - the domestic

Quail. So too may have been the single pigeon Columba livid* (There is a
quite separate and equally crowded pigeon market in Chengdu at which
both fancy birds and racers are sold). The young Northern Goshawk
Accipiter gentilis was unlikely to be on sale for falconry purposes; more
likely it was on offer as a source of traditional medicine. My enquiries
about falconry in Sichuan proved negative. Elsewhere in China, e.g. in
Inner Mongolia and Sinkiang, there is reason to believe that this practice is
extant. See also under 'Bird Trapping' below.
The remaining 19 species were traditional 'cagebirds', i.e. musical song-
sters, likely talkers and those of ornamental appearance.
Among those valued for their song, the Hwamei or Brown Laughing-
thrush was easily the most common, 186 individuals being on display,
comprising 38% of the total of 487 individuals of 19 species of'cagebird'.
The species has a loud and tuneful song. So does the Mongolian Lark, but
only three individuals of this non-local species were on offer. However, of
the Oriental Skylark Alauda gulgula, which nests, for example, on the
Chengdu airport, there were for sale two adults and 20 nearly full-grown
nestlings.
Of species likely to copy human speech, there were only two, both
parrots. There were two Slaty-headed Parrakeets Psittacula himalayana
fischii and 44 Earl of Derby's Parrakeets Psittacula derbiana. Thus, parrots
were 9% of the total.
Certain species are pleasing to both ear and eye, like the Red-spotted
Bluethroat (an adult and two apparent youngsters were present) and
others to the eye like the Peking Robin (71 birds, 15%).
Seedeaters included 17 Grey-capped Greenfinches Carduelis sinica
(3%), one Black-headed Greenfinch Carduelis amhigua, two nestling Eura-
sian Tree Sparrows, one Russett Sparrow Passer rutilans, two Yellow-
billed Hawfinches and four Rosefinches (including one cock) not cer-
tainly identified as to species but probably Common Rosefinches Carpo-
dacus erythrinus.
This leaves, among the indigenous birds only a Brown Shrike Lanius
cristatus , two Striated Munias Munia striata , 29 Chestnut-flanked White-
eyes (6%) and an unidentified nestling, probably a Magpie Robin Copsy-
chus saularis.
Exotics were 62 Canaries (13%) (all yellow or yellowish apart from two
reddish ones and a dozen white ones), and 34 Budgerigars (7%) (two
white, seven blue, seven green and 18 yellow).
To sum up, there were 487 birds of 19 'cage bird' species at this
Chengdu market, plus 102 birds of three other species ( Coturnix , Colum-
ba , Accipiter ). The most common cage birds were the Hwamei, 38%, the
Peking Robin, 15%; the Canary, 13%; the two larger parrots, 9% together;

The smaller bird market in Chengdu is at QInchengshan. During the
same winter, 1985-86, William W. Thomas saw there about 10 species
additional to those at the larger market.
A paperback volume on aviculture (Yi, 1982) was one of only two

Changchun. It is called The Breeding of Fancy Birds , and 54,000 copies

Breeding of Cage Birds by Lu Jiechuan and others (1984), 29,000 copies.
Birds trained to do tricks
Anthony Galsworthy observed birds at the main Beijing market being
used to perform tricks (1983, pers. comm.). He writes: 'On 22nd May
1983, Ken Searle and I watched a Chinese doing tricks with hawfinches
as described in Hemmingsen (1951). He had about three of the Japanese
(or Masked) Hawfinches, all males, tied with strings round their breasts,
with clips. He released one bird onto his hand, then with the other hand
threw a small white ball high in the air, simultaneously throwing the bird
in the air. As the bird flew up to catch the first ball he threw the second
after it. The bird on each occasion I watched, caught both and returned
to his hand, depositing the balls in his palm. It was rewarded with a seed.
A second man had a male Brambling which was similarly trained; but on
this occasion it caught a seed thrown in the air, rather than a ball, and
returned to the hand.'

Bird trapping
To supply the markets birds must be trapped or otherwise 'taken' in
the wild. Hemmingsen (1951) deals with trapping in the 1940s and more
recently Beecroft (in press) gives a valuable account of trapping over two
and a half months in 1985 at a locality on the Yellow Sea coast.
I can add only the following:

William W, Thomas (1983, pers. comm.) writes of his stay in Beijing in
the late 1970s: 'There were a number of bird-trappers who worked the
brush around the Ming Tombs Reservoir, usually with mist nets. Their
usual game included several species of Pams and Emberiza, Phylloscopus
and Aegithalos. The nets were tended very carefully, and some of the
trappers wanted their birds alive. Others killed them as soon as they were
free of the net, presumably for food. There were also hunters using air
guns and even ancient muzzle-loaders, but they were after ducks and
shorebirds. I once saw a peasant carrying a large female Northern Goshawk
Accipiter gentilis which he used against quail and thrushes.' (Hemmingsen,
1951, mentions the netting of Northern Goshawks for use against hares).
In the grounds of my hotel at Qiqihar, Heilongjiang province, on 8th
May 1983, I (J.B.) found a local bird-catcher with six traps slung from a
tree. In a bottom compartment each contained a decoy Eurasian Siskin.
A supply of millet was positioned so as to be available not only to the call
bird but also to potential victims, four of which could be caught in separate
traps above. See Caroline Weaver's photograph.
Cormorant fishing
As recently as 1982 the use of Great Cormorants Phalacrocorax carbo
for fishing was observed near Beijing; on at least two occasions Anthony
Galsworthy saw one or two boats, each with one or two fishermen, opera-
ting on the canal that runs alongside the 'back' road to the Summer Palace.
The site was 1-2 kms before the Palace. In May 1985, D.S. Melville saw
several rafts with captive Cormorants near Guangzhou (Canton). In May
and June 1986, I saw Cormorant fishing in progress at two widely separa-
ted localities, each about an hour's drive from Chengdu. Maryse Addison
(pers. comm. 1986) saw a recent film about Cormorant fishing shot on
Hainan Island. It would seem from these instances alone that Cormorant
fishing, despite rumours to the contrary, is still widespread in China. A
recent account of this behaviour in Guilin in China is that of Egremont
and Rothschild (1979). One feature is a possible example of counting
ability in birds. After a bird has brought seven fish to its owner, the bird
Is allowed to eat the eighth. The bird apparently 'goes on strike', refusing
to move, unless it is fed every eighth fish.
Cheng (1937) traces Cormorant fishing in China back to 317 BC, earlier
than the earliest dates given by Campbell and Lack (1985), i.e. the Sung
dynasty (960-1298 AD). But Zhang (1985) is surely mistaken in stating
that Cormorants trained in China to catch fish 'are not bred in captivity .
At a location in Sichuan I was told by a Cormorant fisherman that the eggs
laid by his birds were hatched out under hens and the resulting young
raised by human hand. The widespread incidence of albino and semi-

albino birds is also highly suggestive of domestication. For example, of the
15 birds owned by my interviewee, one was a complete albino and two
more were partly white. Of course, it is no doubt also true that from time
to time new stock is trapped in the wild and brought into captivity. I was
told that Cormorants live for 20 years, and that mature birds sell for
400-500 yuan (#90 - #115 in October 1985), and young birds for 100-
200 yuan (#23 - #45).

The only large Chinese cities in which I have spent significant periods
of time are Beijing and Chengdu. The most conspicuous birds by far are
Rock Doves Columba livid, but they are birds from owners 5 lofts and not
feral 'street 5 pigeons. Not once did I see, in either city, a pigeon on the
ground in park or town square, garden or roadside patch. And yet high
above, flocks of birds are continually on the move.
The racing of pigeons is a common sport, and pigeons are also bred for
eggs and meat.
On 1st October 1985, I visited a pigeon market in Chengdu, the capital
city of Sichuan province. The majority of the hundred or so boxes or
cages that had been brought contained homers. I was told that in Sichuan,
one of 26 Chinese provinces, albeit the second largest, there were 8,000
members of the pigeon association, with 2,000 in Chengdu alone.
'Ordinary' pigeons were selling for 6 yuan (about #1.25), those with
experience over 500 km courses for 10-20 yuan (about #2-#4), 1,000 km
birds for 200-500 yuan (about #40-#100) and 2,000 km birds (that, for
example, home 1,400 km from Inner Mongolia to Chengdu in two days)
for 500-2,000 yuan (about #100-#400). In fact, there was only one bird in
Chengdu worth 2,000 yuan.
At the other extreme, pigeons to eat cost 2-3 yuan each!
Also for sale were three different pigeon magazines, each a monthly,
and five different pigeon paperbacks; also serially numbered rings, of
course, and magnifying glasses for inspecting pigeons' eyes.
Of particular interest were the pigeon whistles. These are attached in
an upright position to the tail of a pigeon, and when the bird takes off
air passes into the forward facing orifice and a pleasing note is struck.
Nowadays only a few whistles are made of bamboo and gourds - in Cheng-
du, at least. Instead they are fashioned from nut husks or plastic. One
common design employs a table tennis ball! Before selling a whistle the
stall holder insists on a demonstration of the instrument's musicality. He
attaches the whistle to one end of a specially designed stick nearly a metre
in length and then spins the stick from the other end.
A whistle may be a single sound producer, or more likely a combina-

'When the pigeons wheel overhead their sound rises even to the clouds, containing
within it all five notes (of the Chinese scale). Truly it gives joy, and a release to the
emotions!' (Tun Li-ch'en, 1936, Annual Customs and Festivals in Peking , p. 22).

tion of up to 19 'pipes'. Laufer (1934) wrote about, and illustrated, the
collection of Chinese bird whistles held in the Field Museum of Natural
History in Chicago. It is clear that some of the compound whistles are of
intricate and beautiful design, and no doubt produce a pleasing combina-
tion of notes. Imagine a flock taking off each bird carrying a compound
whistle! In fact, I have heard these flying orchestras at two widely separa-
ted locations in Sichuan province and in Beijing.
A Beijing collector of these whistles has written about their history and
craftsmanship (Wang, 1963). He had over 300 examples, including many
contemporary ones, but also some from the Qing dynasty (1644-1912).
But he had none from the time of the Song dynasty (1127-1279) when the
craft was already thriving. The custom is said to have originated in the
Tang dynasty (618-907).
Tun Li-ch'en wrote in 1900 about pigeon whistles in Peking and illus-
trated two of them (see figures) (Tun, 1965).
Yu (1956) has written about the fancy breeds of pigeon favoured in
Beijing in the early 1950s. Earlier, in 1900, Tun Li-ch'en had listed 13
'ordinary varieties' of pigeon by name (e.g. 'Phoenix-headed white' and
'Taoist priest hat') and 23 of 'valuable varieties' (e.g. 'Wild duck of the
Great Dipper' and 'Striped sandals').

and mammalian items, avian 'parts' appeared to be in very little demand.
Even so, there could be a deleterious effect on wild populations.

It appears that the heads and toes of raptors are boiled in water and the
resulting soup is drunk. As to the ailments supposedly cured or relieved,
the claims are so wide-ranging as to create suspicion about their validity.
The Northern Goshawk, Tawny Eagle and Black Kite for sale alive in
the Chengdu bird market (see earlier) are believed to have been on sale for
their medicinal value.

Introduction
The Crimson Finch Neochmia phaeton is one of the most beautiful of
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.9987882" page_id="56953945"  page_num="143" year="" vol="">
the Australian estrildid finches. The male is predominantly blood red to
crimson in colour and, although the female is browner and less bright, she
too is an attractive bird. It is certainly a desirable species for aviculture
but has a reputation of being difficult to keep and breed. Not surprisingly
perhaps, it is scarce in Europe and relatively expensive to buy. A pair of
Crimson Finches was worth about #135 in the U.K. in 1982, compared
with #30 for a pair of Longtail Finches Poephila acuticauda and #35 for a
pair of Gouldian Finches Chloebia gouldiae (Evans and Fidler, 1986).
Crimson Finches are much less expensive in Australia, however, where in
1982 prices varied from about #16 to #20 per pair (Evans and Fidler, loc.
cii). This difference can, however, be attributed to the availability of wild-
caught Crimson Finches in that country. The Australian Government
banned the export of finches, and all other native fauna, to other parts of
the world under its Prohibited Exports Regulations in the early 1960s.
Consequently, only domestically-bred birds are now available outside
Australia. Some licenced finch-trapping continues nevertheless for the
Australian cage bird market which is centred on the town of Wyndham,
in the Kimberley region of north-west Australia. The trade is a dying one
because the Western Australia wildlife authority, which controls it, has
adopted a policy whereby it will renew licences for existing trappers, but
will not issue them to new applicants. The numbers of trappers have,
therefore, dwindled from 55 operating in the Kimberley in 1958 (Immel-
mann, 1965) to nine by 1982 (Evans and Fidler, loc. cii).
Difficulties in establishing the Crimson Finch in captivity are usually
attributed to its aggressiveness. Immelmann (1965) describes how trucu-
lent encounters frequently occur between individuals which come close
to one another under natural conditions, and Blewett &amp; Kroyer-Pedersen
(1978) suggest that members of this species are so aggressive in captivity
that successful breeding can be achieved only by isolating pairs in separate
flights. Even then, there may be problems. Some males repeatedly chase

their mates, driving them from the nest, and, in extreme cases, they may
actually kill them (Immelmann, 1965). We believe, however, that the case
against the Crimson Finch has been overstated. It is undoubtedly aggres-
sive in some circumstances, but we present evidence from two sources
which suggest that this is less of a problem than is usually supposed. The
first arises from field observations of wild birds made by the authors in
the Kimberley. The second comes from discussions with Mr and Mrs Hugo
Austla who use the colony system for breeding Crimson Finches in aviaries
at Wyndham (W.A.).
Field observations
The Crimson Finch occurs across most of northern Australia and also
inhabits southern parts of New Guinea (Blakers, Davies and Reilly, 1984).
It is usually seen near surface water where there are groups of the palm
Pandanus odoratissimus . Observations described in this paper were made at
pools of these kinds along otherwise dry creeks in areas adjacent to the
Wyndharm-Kununurra and Wyndham-Gibb River roads in the eastern and
central Kimberley. The study was made in July and August 1985.
Crimson Finches were almost always seen in groups and each of these
evidently lived in more-or-less permanent association with a particular pool
and its pandanus. What were almost certainly the same birds could be ob-
served regularly at, or close to, the 'home' site. These birds had probably
nested in the pandanus during the previous wet season because we found
'used' Crimson Finch nests at several of the study sites. They were usually
positioned near the bases of the pandanus leaves. Overall, observations
were made of 15 groups of Crimson Finches; their mean size was 13.2
(standard deviation, 6.4). Each group included some adult males in full
nuptial plumage, some adult females and some immature birds; the latter
were either still in juvenile plumage or in the process of moulting out of it.
Members of the groups roosted in the pandanus at night and also spent
much of the day perched in them. They foraged together in the adjacent
areas (i.e. usually within about 200-400 m).
Most feeding activity was confined to dense, long grass and individual
birds were difficult to observe in it for longer than a few minutes. It was
evident, nevertheless, that they foraged together as a flock, moving in the
same general direction and maintaining individual distances of about 1 m.
Crimson Finches are extremely agile climbers, using long tails as balancing
organs, and perching confidently on either vertical or horizontal stems, in
order to take seeds from grass panicles. According to Immelmann (1965),
members of this species do not normally feed on the ground but they were
often observed doing so during the present study; they were apparently
searching for fallen seeds in the soil between tussocks of grass. They also

foraged on the ground in recently burnt areas. There was little aggression
between members of foraging groups. Supplanting attacks were sometimes
observed, usually by adult males towards other birds, but they were mild
and never resulted in prolonged chases. Males in full nuptial plumage often
perched or foraged close to one another (i.e. about 0.5 m apart) without
eliciting hostile reactions.
Members of foraging groups responded to a sudden disturbance, such as
that caused by the approach of the observer, by flying-up from the
ground. If they were close to the pandanus (i.e. within approximately
50 m), they flew back to them, retreating deep into the palms, and usually
remaining out of sight for several minutes. Members of groups, which were
more distant from the pandanus when they were disturbed, flew into
nearby trees, often flying in different directions and thereby becoming
separated from one another. They subsequently regrouped by flying down
to start foraging together as a flock. Loud contact calls were made by
finches flying from one place to another, including flying down to forage,
and probably function in keeping members of the group together.
Aviary notes
Hugo and Bev. Austla breed finches in semi-enclosed outdoor aviaries.
They concentrate their efforts on Gouldian Finches Chloebia gouldiae but
keep several other Australian estrildid finches, including the Crimson
Finch. Since their captive birds are subjected to similar climatic regimes of
temperature, humidity and day length as those living under natural con-
ditions, it is not surprising that they show the same seasonal patterns of
activity. Crimson Finches, for instance, come into breeding condition
during the wet season (January-February) both in the Austlas' aviaries and
in the wild. They stop breeding from the middle of the dry season onwards
(about June).
Mr and Mrs Austla provide Crimson Finches with a standard feed mix,
consisting of pannicum millet (3 parts), canary seed (1 part), white millet
(1 part) and Japanese millet (1 part). They also receive regular supplies of
green grass leaves, and when in season, seeding grasses. A complex soft
food mix, which is made from the following ingredients, is provided on a
daily basis throughout the year:
12 boiled eggs, including their shells
Two dessertspoons of a commercial vitamin/mineral salts preparation
Two ounces of another commercial vitamin preparation
Four dessertspoons of skimmed powder milk
One tablespoon of table salt
Four dessertspoons of honey

Eight ounces of apple juice

One cup of water
This mixture is homogenised in a food processor and then mixed with
equal quantities of commercial biscuit mix and boiled seed mix.
Birds are bred in communal aviaries and, in the case of Crimson Finches,
as many as 15 pairs are caged together in flights measuring 4 (long) x 2
(wide) x 2 (high) m. They are provided with standard woven-baskets and
open-fronted wooden (15 x 15 x 15 cm) nest-boxes. Some nesting materials,
such as grass stems and coconut fibre, are placed in each box but the birds
carry further materials to the nest, often preferring green grass. Individuals
become aggressive as breeding activities commence but not enough to
cause serious problems. They are relatively placid once nesting is underway.
Young remain in the same flight as the parents until they are no longer fed
by them.
Good pairs of Crimson Finches rear three broods in succession but
never rear more than four per nest. Overall, the Austlas expect to rear
about 80-100 young from 30 pairs caged in the two flights (averaging
about three young per pair).
Mr. and Mrs. Austla carried out an experiment in 1984 which empha-
sises the success of colony breeding and even suggests that Crimson Fin-
ches breed more effectively when they are caged in groups than when they
are kept as isolated pairs.
Three flights, each measuring 2 x 1 x 2 m, were stocked with one, two
and three pairs of adult Crimson Finches respectively, and the birds were
left in them for the entire breeding season. The total numbers of young
reared in each flight were as follows:

Crimson Finches are undoubtedly less aggressive than has been reported
in previous studies, at least under the circumstances described in the
present account. They occur in social groups in the non-breeding season
and the behaviour within them is similar to that described in flocks of
other estrildid finches by Evans (1970, 1972) and Evans and Patterson
(1971); the movements of individuals in groups are co-ordinated and they
are relatively unaggressive towards one another. Similarly, Crimson
Finches can be caged together in groups in captivity and will even breed

successfully in colonies which are confined in relatively small aviaries.
Further studies are needed to explain the discrepancies between the
present findings and previous accounts. One possibility is that the groups
observed by us were kin groups (i.e. consisted of closely related indi-
viduals). Indeed, this certainly is true to at least some extent. Groups
almost certainly consisted of birds (and their young) which had bred in
the 'home' pandanus during the previous wet season. One would expect
relatively little hostility between members of kin groups but much more
aggression between unrelated and unfamiliar individuals. It may be,
therefore, that high levels of aggression occur in the wild and in captivity
when unfamiliar birds encounter one another, and that previous accounts
are based on observations of such interactions.

INCREASED REPRODUCTION IN A PAIR OF BARN OWLS
Tyto alba
AT THE CINCINNATI ZOOLOGICAL GARDENS
(Ohio, USA)

(Head Keeper, Nocturnal Animal House)
Early in 1980, a new display was completed in the Cincinnati Zoo's
Nocturnal House that was to be a permanent enclosure for the exhibition
of an avian species. Since its remodelling in the mid-1960s, the Nocturnal
House has displayed only mammals. A room 8 ft wide by 12 ft long and
12 ft high (2.44 x 3.66 x 3.66 m) was converted to resemble the inside of
an old barn. It was constructed of authentic barn wood and furnished
with a hay loft area, bales of straw, old farming tools, as well as some
horse tack, the intention being to display Barn Owls in a natural setting.
The exhibit was housed indoors only, allowing greater control of such
variables as temperature and photo-period. The exhibit temperature
fluctuated between 65-75*F (18-24*C) and the birds were kept under a
year-round 12-hour day/12-hour night cycle. From about 10:00 hours to
22:00, the display was illuminated by a 4 ft (1.28 m) blue fluorescent
strip light. In the remaining hours, the birds were under the lighting of a
4 ft white fluorescent strip light.
Though the Barn Owl is considered to be one of the most widely
spread species of owls found today (with subspecies found on all con-
tinents except Antarctica), there was more difficulty in procuring these
birds than was anticipated. Even though they are distributed over such
an enormous area, in many geographical regions they are rare. Much of
this rarity is caused by the destruction of many man-made structures such
as barns, old churches, derelict buildings, etc. which, over the centuries,
the owls have adopted as prime nesting sites. Also, due to modernised
farming methods, many owl species find it increasingly difficult to locate
food in the form of rodents which were once numerous among the far-
mers' field and grain storage bins.
In the wild, Barn Owls are reported to have a single clutch of eggs
annually with a second clutch occurring during times of food abundance
(Sparks, et al, 1979). One to 13 eggs have been reported, with the average
brood size being four to five. Incubation lasts 30-32 days and the eggs,
which are laid on alternate days, also hatch on this two-day pattern. This
may act as an evolutionary advantage for the species as a whole, for
should food supplies become scarce, cannibalism of the younger chicks

by the older ones will sometimes occur. This will result in the older
chick(s) surviving longer and will also reduce the total amount of food that
the parents need to bring back to the nest.
On 27th March, 1980, we obtained the first owl for the exhibit - a
wild-caught bird estimated to be about six months old. It came from
the Riverbanks Zoo, South Carolina, and was followed, on the next day,
by the arrival of two more owls. These were also wild-caught and were
sent from the Department of Wildlife in Louisiana who estimated their
ages at four months. All of these birds had adult plumage and were placed
together in the newly-completed exhibit on 5th April, 1980.
In early March 1981, two of the birds began a constant squabbling,
with the same bird always being the aggressor. The two problem birds
were the ones received from Louisiana. It was assumed that the problem
was related to an imbalance of sexes in the enclosure so the three birds
were surgically sexed.
Many individuals feel that Barn Owls can be correctly sexed by a
difference in coloration. However, it was felt that the surgical sexing
method was more reliable than colour variations for proper sexing of
these birds and it was therefore the chosen method.
The Louisiana birds were both males and were probably fighting over
the attentions of the South Carolina bird which was a female. Now that
proper sexing had been achieved, the female and the 'alpha' male were
returned to the exhibit. Approximately one month later, the female was
found to be sitting on her first egg. No real nest was made; it was merely
an indentation in a bale of straw located in the hay loft area several
feet above the exhibit floor. The female defended the nest readily by
spreading her wings and rocking back and forth while vocalising (a hissing,
screeching scream). Several more eggs were laid, each at two day intervals.
On the morning of 2nd August, 1981, 30 days after the discovery of
the first egg, broken egg shells were found on the floor directly below the
nest site. Though the mother guarded it fiercely, it was possible to catch
a glimpse of a newly-hatched chick. The male was not removed from the
exhibit but became excitable when the enclosure was entered. The pair
successfully reared two young. By the time they were one month old, the
young could only be distinguished from their parents by being slightly
smaller and lacking the identification leg bands worn by the adult birds.
Exactly 30 days after the hatching of her first chick, the female,
while still in the company of her month-old chicks, began to lay again.
Thirty days after laying had started, the first egg of her second clutch
hatched. It was known that her previous clutch had consisted of more than
two eggs and we wondered whether only two young were eventually
reared because of the quantity of food provided. As the second clutch

began hatching, the quantity and contents of the diet being offered to
the adults was increased. The diet (per bird) of two beef heart strips, two
chicken necks (skin removed) and three ounces of Nebraska Brand Bird of
Prey Diet was doubled. Freshly killed mice (2-10 per day, depending on
the previous day's consumption) were added to the diet. The mice were
the preferred food, followed by beef heart, chicken necks and bird of
prey diet.
Five young were successfully fledged this time and the cycle began to
repeat. To date, this single pair has produced young in February, July and
December 1982, April, August and December 1983, March, July and
October 1984, January, May, August and September of 1985, and May
and September of 1986 to add to the seven chicks produced in 1981. This
pair is currently sitting again with a clutch of eggs which should begin
hatching at the end of this month (November). In all, some 70 young
have been successfully hatched and reared by this pair with several of the
nesting sites occurring on the floor of the exhibit in plain view of the
public. The male has never been removed from the exhibit and on many
occasions has been observed bringing food to the nest site and, as the
young grew older, he would assist with their feeding.
Some of these Barn Owl progeny have been sent to various zoos and
nature centres for public display. The great majority, however, have been
released in south-western Ohio and south-eastern Indiana. There is hope
that the numbers of Barn Owls in the wild will begin to increase in areas
where these birds were once plentiful but are now scarce.
In conclusion, there are probably several factors involved in the reason
why our Barn Owls have been so reproductively active. Some of these may
include: an enclosure which is similar to the habitat that these birds
would seek in the wild; an abundance and variety of food; a temperature
range suitable to the animals and/or a lighting schedule in which the birds
cannot distinguish a seasonal change in the photo-period.

The Southern Lapwing Vanellus chilensis is 33 cm long and weighs
about 235 g. It has red eyes and a black forehead, breast and external
remiges. The back is iridescent greenish grey and the belly white. The
black tail is short, with white base and tip. The pink bill is tipped black
and the legs are long and reddish pink. Filiform feathers stick out behind
the head. There is a scapular spur.
This lapwing is a very aggressive bird, inhabiting open, surburban areas
where fields have been ploughed for agriculture and where there are ex-
tensive lawns or football fields. More rarely, they are found in sugar cane
fields soon after they have been ploughed or when cane is growing.
Although it is a bird that uses areas cleared by humans, it is wary. It is
expert at concealing its intentions, and while watching for intruders and
predators, it preens its feathers calmly and slowly, elegantly, stopping to
peck the ground once in a while, gradually and surely moving away from
any possible source of danger. In this way, it is very difficult to find its
nest except by watching the behaviour of the adults.
The observations here reported refer to five nests found between
23rd July 1982 and 18th November 1983. There is at least one breeding
pair on the University campus of Rio Claro, Sao Paulo State, Brazil, and
their breeding could be followed year by year.
Method of watching the nest
Because these birds are very wary of people, their nests and nesting
behaviour were studied from within a car parked 80 m from the nest. Birds
showed disturbance and left the nest if I sat outside the car or if someone
approached the car.
Breeding season
In the Rio Claro region, nests of Vanellus chilensis were found from
July to November. Belton (1984) reports nesting of the species from July
to December. Milleo-Costa (1985) reports nesting in Curitiba between
August to January with a peak in August-October. Observations of the
campus pair showed that they bred twice a year.

All nests were found in extensive open grassy fields such as a football
field, a ploughed area for rice plantation or in the open part of a sugar
cane field where plants were about 30 cm tall.
The nest is in a depression in the ground, with few grass stems or roots
for lining. Two nests had external diameters of 12.5 cm and 23.0 cm,
internal diameters of 9 cm and 11 cm; the depth was 1.5 cm.
Clutch size , eggs and incubation
Clutch size was four eggs for one nest and three eggs for four nests.
Average weight for 16 eggs was 23,1 g (range 22.1-25.0 g) and average egg
measurements were 44.6 x 32.6 mm (range 41.5-48.0; 31.5-34.0 mm).Eggs
were laid two days apart in one case, and had a grey-green background
with black spots scattered all over but concentrated at the large end. They
became rather dirty with reddish mud while incubation progressed, which
made them difficult to find. They are rather pointed at one end and all
eggs are placed with this end toward the centre of the nest during incuba-
tion.
Incubation sessions are very short, probably because of the wariness of
the adults and the number of people walking through the campus. I was
surprised that the pair was able to hatch all four eggs of the first clutch
even with the disturbance. The shortest incubation session was two minutes
and the longest 85 (average 22.4 min.). On 11th November 1982, from
14:10 to 18:10, the average incubation session was 12.5 minutes (range
2-45 minutes).
Just before sitting for a session, the arriving adult turns the eggs. At
intervals during incubation, the adult stands up on the nest and turns the
eggs with its bill, then sits down again. These movements are more com-
mon closer to hatching. Sometimes, the incubating bird half stands and
preens the breast, wings and back diligently.
In the nest on the football field, a worker said there had been two
eggs on 23rd July and four eggs on 26th July, If so, the incubation period
for this nest should have been 24 or so days. The first egg hatched at
about 10:07 on 17th August, and the last chick emerged on 18th August
Behaviour while nesting
Both adults are extremely aggressive during their nesting period. They
have the habit of rapidly lowering the body, as if incubating, in the middle
of grass. If their nest is located and one tries to get the eggs for measure-
ments, both adults call loudly, fly around the observer, and finally dive
past very rapidly and give a buzzy vocalisation just before striking the
observer with a wing spur.

When one approaches a nest with an incubating adult, it may stand
when one is about 10 m away and walk slowly away with large strides.
Adults at the nest in the sugar cane field were more wary, rising when I
was 150 m away. When far from the nest, the adult flies calling loudly and
bringing up its calling mate. At another nest, the sitting adult stood up and
flew toward us when we were 7 m away from the nest.
All the time the observer was handling eggs for weighing and measuring,
the adults flew around yelling loudly. Ten minutes or so after the observer
went away, the adult walked toward the nest, moved 8 m away and
preened the breast a little and walked back to the nest. Finally, it sat on
the nest, pecking the ground twice.
Changeover of adults on the nest was rather interesting, being syn-
chronised. One adult walked up slowly, the bird on the nest stood up,
pecked around the nest a lot as if foraging and moved away in the opposite
direction while the other approached from behind. The departing bird
never looked back and moved slowly away while the second approached
the nest, looked in the nest and sat Some 10 m from the nest, the depart-
ing bird stopped, pecked on the ground, preened the head with one food
and moved a little, stopped, looked and pecked the ground now and then.
It usually went to the edge of the hill below the nearby eucalyptus plan-
tation. There it preened its left wing with its bill, shook its wings a little
and moved downhill while the other remained immobile on the nest.
On 13th August 1982 at 17:23, one bird came flying down and its
mate, which had been sitting on the nest, stood up. The newly-arrived
bird gave faint uau, uau calls and had wings well open when it landed, but
the other had the wings half open. Soon both closed their wings. The
newcomer examined the nest and sat facing north while its mate departed
toward the south-east, pecking the ground and disappearing downhill.
Predation or losses caused by man
Since Vanellus chiiensis nests in proximity to man, humans easily rob
its young or destroy its nests and eggs by running them over with tractors
or other machines. At one of the five nests I studied, two ringed birds of
the four young of a clutch were taken by children and a tractor ran over
the nest in the sugar cane field.
Aggressiveness
While incubating, the bird is rather alert and looks all around moving
its head, and also above, turning its head up. It was especially alert and
somewhat disturbed when one or four Black Vultures Coragyps atratus
soared above the area and once at a soaring Crested Caracara Poly boms
plancus . On 14th August one bird was incubating and suddenly it stood

up and walked over to a pole half a metre from the nest and stayed
immobile there. Soon after, I saw the shadow of a vulture circling the
nest. The bird seemed disturbed for a moment and was immobile but
preened a little and three minutes later the vulture went away.
Once, on 14th August 1982 at 10:40, a bird flew off scaring away
two Campo Flickers Colaptes campestris. On 13th August 1982 at 16:45
when three foraging Guira Cuckoos Guira guira approached on the lawn,
an adult near the nest returned running toward the intruders which moved
away with tee tee tee calls. The adult lapwing returned to nest soon
afterwards.
The birds are aggressive all year long toward other birds and humans
passing by: this is evident by their loud calls and running movements
and a few displays toward intruders. This is especially so when they have
a nest or chicks which they defend fiercely,for instance when I was
measuring and weighing young, my husband was standing being attacked
by both adults in flight and diving toward him and actually hitting him
with a wing spur.
Whenever a bird is sitting on a nest or on a mound^if someone passes
it stands and resumes foraging and pecking the ground intently. 'Active
foraging' or 'diligent preening' may be types of aggressive behaviour
toward a predator. At the presence of two dogs 80 m from the nest,
a bird left the nest and stood preening at the edge of the hill
An immobile bird is hard to see in the middle of burnt stubble which
is also grey like the bird's back. Thus, the alternating immobility,
preening, walking slowly and cautiously may be a means of concealment
when they really have nests or chicks. However, this behaviour seems
more pronounced during their breeding season.

While incubating the birds preened a lot and often half stood to
preen the wings, back and breast; they seemed to be irritated and perhaps
they and the nest were infested with mites.
Foraging
On 16th August 1982 at 08:32 an incubating adult ran from the nest
to peck a flying moth. Most of the time they peck on the ground for
insects amongst the grass but sometimes one is observed inserting the bill
in the wet grassy ground and digging out worms.
Hatching young
On 17th August 1982 at 10:41, when I suspected there was a chick
in the nest, the adult was half standing in the nest; it turned the eggs and

sat. Its mate was 5 m north of the nest At 10:58 the sitting bird stood
again, turned the eggs and soon pecked the ground twice and went 40 cm
away from the nest and preened a lot. At this moment, the chick moved in
the nest. At 11:04 the adult returned to nest and sat with the chick under
its breast. Between 11:04 and 11:56 there was a change of adults on the
nest at 11:31 and 11:55; at 11:56 the sitting adult stood up and walked
straight ahead with half an eggshell. It dropped the shell 0.5 m from the
nest and, turning to face the nest, it picked the eggshell up and, half drop-
ping it, scattered fragments along as it walked to 15 m away, eating some
fragments in the process. The parent returned to the nest, picked up the
other half of the shell, and walked with large strides to about 18 m SW of
the nest. There it scattered and ate the pieces in four minutes. It was back
to the nest at 12:05. At 12:20 two eggs, which weighed 21.5 and 21.0 g,
were pipping at the large end. The newly-hatched young weighed 17.3 g; it
had black swollen feet and was mottled on its wet back and head; its eyes
were brown. It gave faint peeping calls, had a white eggtooth, and was
white on the belly and neck but had a black band across the chest. Its bill
measured 1.1 cm.
While we measured and weighed the young, another egg hatched and
the young weighed 19.2 g, peeping with eyes half open. The bill was 1 cm
long. At 14:30 the third young was hatching but the yolk was still stuck
to the shell and the young was wet. The first-hatched young was quite
dry and the second one rather dry. The fourth young hatched at 10:24 on
18th August, when the adults were downhill with three other chicks. At
10:36, after some commotion and screeching, one adult ran to the nest,
lifted an eggshell and carried it away, dropping it once in a while and
leaving it 30 m from the nest. It then returned to the nest and sat briefly.

The young crouch as soon as they hear the adult screeching at a pos-
sible danger. Their downy plumage is mottled in dark and light, incon-
spicuous in the middle of low vegetation. A few hours after hatching they
run out of the nest, hurrying back to the nest or hiding under the parents
as soon as there is any danger.
On 26th August 1982, at 18:09 chicks were still running to the centre
of the football field, between two parents. At 18:14, when it was rather
dark, one bird settled near the nest site and the chick ran to hide under
it. At 18:18 it was dark already; the other birds seemed to sit at the nest
site but it was too dark to be sure.
On 6th September 1982, the two remaining young were still tiny but
black-chested. They wandered up to 35 m away from adults and foraged
in the 'pause-run-peck-pause' fashion, but hid below the adult at a sign of

danger. With two young, each parent was caring for one young.
On 23rd September 1982, the chicks ran like adults on the field.
About one-third the size of the adults, they were getting some feathers.
On 1st October, young were about the size of a Semipalmated Plover
Charadrius semipalmatus and had black chests, white bellies, grey heads,
grizzled superciliaries with some black on the eyeline, and crest and brown
backs streaked with grey.
On 11th November 1982 the pair at a new nest had two juveniles with
them, probably young of the first nesting. Bills were shorter than those of
adults and the back feathers had a banded or scaled appearance. The
plume behind the head was short and the legs were light reddish or pink.
Those juveniles were sitting close together on a mound of sand and grass
cut by a tractor, but 7 m away from the new nest. They readily stood and
started a long preening session when people passed only 15 m or so from
the nest,
Milleo-Costa (1985) reports three individuals '.participating in the
nesting, using displays and stereotyped sounds which characterise inter-
specific agonistic behaviour by attack', but this was not seen in the Rio
Claro nests, except that two juveniles were sitting near a nesting pair.
On 19th August 1982, when I tried to weigh the four chicks, one bird
started to screech loudly and a pair flew after me, thus I presume the first
bird was part of that 'family'. This third member was only noticed when
the chicks were born.
After breeding ends, the Lapwings flock and can be seen in loud groups
of 8-10 flying over the city. Flocks of four can be seen even of nesting
pairs.

In my article on Alectoris partridges in a recent issue of our magazine
(Vol. 92: 1: 22-36) I touched on the introduction of the Chukar Alectoris
chukar into Britain and Europe and the disastrous effects this seems likely
to have on the future status of the Red-legged Partridge A. rufa , both in
England and in its native home in south-western Europe, and on the Rock
Partridge A. graeca in Europe. I mentioned that I had not myself seen
hybrid chukar x rufa partridges and therefore could not give a description
of them. I have since done so and also received further information on the
introduction of the Chukar in Europe. Hence this short article as a sort of
postscript to my former one.
Appearance of hybrids
In the past 12 months I have seen about 20+ hybrid Alectoris in two
different areas in Kent, In the same period and places I have seen only
three that were, in appearance , pure Red-legged Partridges, and two that
appeared to be pure Chukars. A few other Alectoris were seen at too great
a distance to ascertain their status.
Whether these hybrids had been bred in captivity and then released or
had been bred in the wild I do not know but, as the majority of them were
where I had seen mixed pairs in the spring of 1985 (Goodwin, 1986) the
latter seems likely.
Most of the hybrids seen appeared 'In the field' to be closer to one or
other parent form and, by the casual observer, could very easily have been
assumed to be pure rufa or pure chukar as the case might be. The inter-
mediate condition of the neck markings, however, at once revealed their
hybrid status to one looking out for this. All showed some trace of the
streaked 'necklace' of the Red-legged Partridge, varying in amount, never
as much as in pure rufa but always sufficient to tell them from pure
chukar.
It is, of course, quite likely that some hybrids, especially if they result
from back-crossing of a hybrid to one of the parent species or from
hybrids breeding inter se, may have the neck pattern identical or nearly
so to one of the parent species and that I (and others) may not recognise
such birds as hybrids when seen in the field.
Unless a very clear and close view is obtained, other specific differ-

Diagrammatic sketches to show differences in pattern of face and throat of: a) Red-
legged Partridge; b) Hybrid Chukar x Red-legged Partridge (drawn from photograph
taken in 1986 near Abberton, Norfolk),
ences are hard, perhaps impossible, to ascertain in the field. My friend
Mr Michael Cottrell took some colour photographs of a pair of Alectoris
(near Abberton, in Norfolk) that appeared in the field to be Red-legged
Partridges except for the lesser amount of streaking on the neck. When,
however, we looked at the resultant photographs in detail, we found
that in two characters - the distribution of white and black on the face
and the shape of the bib - they took after the Chukar. One of these birds
has one flank feather fully exposed and this feather (probably also the
others) has two black cross-bars, as on a Chukar, although, in the amount
of chestnut at the tip it (and all other flank feathers of both birds) more
resembles the Red-legged Partridge.
Pairing of hybrids in the wild
In the spring of 1986 I was able to see only three pairs near enough
to ascertain their status. Near Farningham, Kent, I saw (on two different
occasions but almost certainly the same two pairs) a pair consisting of two
very similar (and very 'intermediate') hybrids and another pair in which
the cock looked a pure Red-legged Partridge and the hen was a hybrid.
Near Cliffe I saw two hybrids paired together, one of which was nearer to
tufa and one to chukar in general appearance.

More on introductions
Thanks to Dr Jurgen Nicolai, who very kindly sent me copies of the
relevant literature, I have now learnt more about the introduction of the
Chukar in Europe. None of it comforting for those who, like myself, hope
for the continuation of the Red-legged and Rock Partridges in their pure
state. It would appear (Glotz von Blotzheiml973; Niethammer, 1963) that
the liberation of vast numbers of Chukars in southern France and else-
where in Europe was ( and I suppose still is) not or at least not only at
the whims of individual shooters and landowners but (so I deduce from
the information given by Niethammer) by or under the auspices of an
international shooting organisation, the 'Conseil Internationale de la
Chasse', with at least the tacit approval of the governments of the coun-
tries concerned. Readers may be glad to know that our late member Pro-
fessor Ghigi appears to be one of the few eminent ornithologists who was
courageous enough to speak out against these plans to introduce the
Chukar into the native haunts of other Alectoris species. As early as 1957
(or before) hybridisation between Cbukars and Red-legged Partridges was
taking place in France. A statement that the hybrids were also fertile
suggests that they were also then freely breeding there in the wild.
It thus seems likely that it is official, or at any rate quasi-official
policy to try to eliminate the Red-legged Partridge in France (possibly
also in Spain) in favour of the Chukar and/or hybrids between the two.
Even if not, there, as of course in England also, the combination of non-
selective shooting by sportsmen, coupled with continual 'topping up' with
fresh releases of Chukars could hardly fail to result in the ultimate dis-
appearance of pure Red-legged Partridges. Unless (1) more Alectoris
partridges were killed by other factors than by sportsmen and (2) these
other adverse factors caused strong selection for rufa and against chukar
and hybrids. Which seems unlikely. Rather similar circumstances (ap-
parently non-selective mortality factors coupled with 'topping up' by man)
have resulted in the racial mongrelisation of the Pheasant Phasianus col-
chicus in Britain and the replacement of wild Rock Pigeons by feral pig-
eons in much of Britain.
I had thought that the introduction of the Chukar and its hybrids into
Britain had been done by individuals at their own free will. Now, of
course, the suspicion occurs that there may have been official pressures
in response to orders from the EEC authorities in Brussels, That the latter
long ago decided that it should be illegal for people in member countries
to grow and market more than a relatively few, officially approved culti-
vars of fruits and vegetables is well known, for there were many published
protests from scientists involved in horticulture and agriculture. If, as

seems all too possible, our masters in Brussels are persuaded that all other
forms of Alectoris are 'inferior to' and 'poorer sporting birds' than the
Chukar and are to be eliminated in favour of it, then the outlook is bleak
indeed. Certainly the large scale introduction of the Chukar into Britain
seems to have coincided in time with our joining the EEC but whether it
is, as I fear, a case of Post hoc ergo propter hoc , I do not know.
If the EEC authorities are behind the Chukar introduction project
then, obviously there is no hope for the future of the Red-legged Part-
ridge now that Spain and Portugal, as well as ourselves, are subject to
their rulings. If not, then it seems to me that the best way to save pure
stocks of the Red-legged Partridge would be to ascertain if any of the
islands where it occurs (probably mostly as a result of past introduction
but that is unimportant), the Balearics, Corsica, Gran Canaria, Madeira
and the Azores, are as yet free of Chukars and/or hybrids. If, happily,
some or all of these islands were found to be free of Alectoris other than
rufa, then every effort should be made to make it illegal to introduce
any other Alectoris species into the wild on them.

REDUCING EXCESSIVE WEIGHT LOSS IN A WHOOPING
CRANE EGG BY REHYDRATION

Introduction
Assuring the proper rate of evaporative water loss is essential in the
artificial incubation of wild bird eggs. This article describes an example of
excessive water loss from a crane egg and successful attempts to correct
it.
A female Whooping Crane Grus americana (I.D. No. 13-01) laid one ees
at 15:00 h on 3rd May 1982 at the International Crane Foundation (I.C.F.)
at Baraboo, Wisconsin. The egg, weighing 207.11 g and measuring 108.4 x
60.2 mm, was immediately placed in the nest of a pair of Florida Sandhill
Cranes G. canadensis pratensis , in an open area of an outdoor enclosure.
On 14th May the egg was temporarily removed to be weighed and candled.
The fertile egg had shown a daily weight loss of 1.96 g/d which would have
resulted in a predicted weight loss of 27.5% over the entire 29-day incuba-
tion period (Fig. 1). Artificially incubated crane eggs that subsequently
hatch ordinarily lose 10-16% of initial weight during incubation (Rogers,
1982). The total weight loss of many bird eggs during natural incubation is
16-18% (Drent, 1975; Rahn and Ar, 1974). Snyder and Birchard (1982)
found that hatchability of chicken eggs is inversely proportional to final
weight loss above 15%. They also report that excessive rates of waterless
during the first half of incubation are more detrimental to hatchability
than the same rates of loss during the final half.

Several methods were employed attempting to slow the daily weight
loss of this egg. The egg was returned to the nest, which was artificially
moistened. The incubating birds were provided with a plastic wading
pool for bathing, and the nest was moistened with water each day. On
21st May the egg was weighed again and still showed excessive loss (1.94
g/d). The egg was then placed in a forced-air, automatic egg-turning,
incubator with a dry-bulb reading of 37.6*C and a wet-bulb reading of
30.2*C. The wet-bulb reading was increased to 33.3*C by 24th May and
then maintained between 33.3-34.4*C until 31st May. From 21st to 24th

May daily weight loss remained high (2JO g/d) despite increased ambient
humidity.
On 25th May the egg was removed from the incubator at a tempera-
ture of 37.6*C and completely _ submerged in a 0.9% saline solution con-
taining 3000 ppm of tylosin tartrate (trade name Tylan Soluble) at 4.4*C
for five minutes in an attempt to restore some of the lost water. This
method has been used widely in the poultry industry to introduce anti-
biotics into hatching eggs early in incubation since its demonstration by
Chalquest and Fabricant (1959). The egg was gently blotted with a towel,
allowed to dry and then weighed again. Five-minute submersions were
continued daily through 30th May using sterile tap water cooled to 10.0*C
in place of the Tylan solution. The high incubator humidity was main-
tained through the end of incubation.
On the morning of 30th May the egg was removed from the rotating
tray and set in a concave piece of foam rubber on the incubator floor. The
egg was candled, and the larger portion of the air cell was kept uppermost
By 22:00 h the chick could be heard scratching inside the shell. By 08:00 h
on 31st May, the chick had tom the inner shell membrane and was breath-
ing and peeping loudly. The egg was then transferred to a forced-air hatcher
set at 37.2*C with a wet-bulb reading of 34.4*C. Egg submersion was
discontinued so as not to drown the chick. The chick pipped the shell by
08:00 the next day. The hatching sequence did not progress beyond this,
and at 15:00 h an aviculturist opened the shell further. The chick freed
itself from the shell at 18:40 h . Ten measurements of shell thickness, in-
cluding the dried membranes, were taken around the midsection of the egg
with a micrometer.
Within a week of hatching the chick became lethargic. The bird was
treated with antibiotics and force-fed and soon recovered.

Our attempts to correct the excessive weight loss were unsuccessful
until we began submerging the egg. The weight loss was not only stabilised
by this treatment, but the egg actually gained weight (Fig. 1). Total weight
loss to the end of incubation was 21% as opposed to the estimate of 27.5%
(Fig. 1). Placing the warm egg in the cold solution produced a negative
pressure and drew the Tylan solution into the egg. Continued use of the
saline solution beyond the initial submersion might have resulted in toxic
build-up of salt inside the egg as 6-10 mg of salt may have entered the egg
with each submersion. The prophylactic Tylan treatment safeguarded
against bacterial infection. After the egg had dried, weighings indicated an
average gain of 0.885 +/- 0.199 g (x +/- SD, n = 6) from each submersion.
The weights recorded on Fig. 1 during the submersion treatment are those

recorded each morning before submersion. The corrective measures used
by Burnham (1983) for falcon eggs, such as covering parts of the shell sur-
face with paraffin or injecting Ringer's solution, were unknown to us at
the time.
After hatching, the eggshell thickness was found to be 0.485 +/-
0.050 mm (x +/- 95% CL, n= 10). Anderson and Kreitzer (1971) give
Whooping Crane eggshell thicknesses from eggs collected before 1910 as
0.604 +/- 0.14mm (not 0.064 +/- 0.014, as given in their Table 1 [D.W.
Anderson, pers. comm.]) and 0.612 +/- 0.057 mm (x +/- 95% CL) for eggs
collected from 1967-1969. These figures suggest our captive-produced egg
was relatively thin-shelled. This thinness may have been partially res-
ponsible for the excessive weight loss of the egg, since water vapour con-
ductance across eggshells is inversely proportional to shell thickness (Ar,
etal, 1974).
We feel that this method of repeatedly submerging eggs may be useful
in reducing excessive rates of weight loss in artificially incubated eggs.
From our limited experience it appears that this technique can be used in
later stages of incubation and on a daily basis.

Description
The Western Spinebill is found in the south-west region of Western
Australia; the only other member of the genus is the Eastern Spinebill
A. tenuirostris found in the eastern region of Australia from Queensland
to Victoria and on Tasmania and islands of the Bass Strait. Spinebills are
closely related to the honeyeaters.
The male Western Spinebill is dark olive grey above and has a broad
chestnut collar over the nape, extending to chestnut throat and breast.
There are white and then black bands across the breast; the abdomen is
buff. Length 13-16 cms. The female is smaller, duller with no chestnut on
the throat. It lives on heathland and woodlands where it feeds on Kanga-
roo Paw Anigozanthos manglesii and other flowers, Dryandras and Banksias
and insects on the wing.
History
Both the male and female were wild-caught birds, the male probably
arriving at Perth Zoo in early 1976 whilst the female arrived in December
1978. Both birds have had a history of recurring scaly feet which pre-
vented us from banding them.
They were originally housed in an aviary that contained a pair of Black-
tailed Native Hens Gallinus ventralis and a Little Bittern Ixobrychus minu-
tus. Two small shrubs covered by a creeper grew over a concrete pond
located in the middle of the aviary.
A small, cup-shaped nest was built in the creeper in November 1983
and one egg was laid. However, unseasonably bad weather caused the
female to lose both the nest and the egg a day after she began to incubate.
In August 1984 both birds were moved to another aviary which had
been relandscaped along with several surrounding aviaries under a general
theme of 'forests'. The aviary measures approximately 3m high x 4.5 m
inside and faces south-west. It has a sandy floor and is covered with tin
on its northern side. Vegetation in the aviary includes two types of
Bottlebrush Callistemon an Albizzia Albizzia lopantha and several types of
native grass, as well as a number of Kangaroo Paws Anigozanthos manglessi.
A sawn-off branch from Weeping Peppermint Tree Agonis flexuosa is
propped up in a corner of the aviary.

Birds, of Western Australia (Serventy and Whittel, 1976) states that
eggs and nests can be found from September to January, with early
nesting birds usually having only one egg and later nesting birds having
two. Eggs are buff with brown blotches, particularly at the larger end,
and they measure 18x13 mm.
Observations
In late August 1984, three weeks after being relocated in their new
aviary, the male was seen displaying to the female. He would approach
her from a lower point of the branch upon which she was sitting and take
a small hop towards her while fanning his tail exposing his conspicuous
white outer tail feathers. The female would then fly off being closely
followed by her mate who would chase her vigorously around the cage.
The roles were often reversed with the female doing the displaying and
chasing. During the displays the male in particular was very boisterous,
calling loudly all the time.
The female soon began constructing a nest,often carrying long strands
of grass around the aviary for several laps before alighting on a branch.
Construction took 4-5 days and was carried out by the female only. She
used Albizzia flowers and dried grasses, as well as camel hair, coconut
and palm fibres, and spiders' webs which were provided for her, hung
in the bottlebrushes. The nests of a Singing Honeyeater Melophaga
virescens and a Striped Palm Squirrel Funambulus pennanti were also
torn up and provided as nesting material. The nest was built about one
metre off the ground in the peppermint tree and was lined with feathers
and camel hair.
An egg was soon noted in the nest, and the female began sitting the
day after the egg was laid. The male was seen to fly to the tallest branches
where he would sing loudly; on occasions he was seen to feed the female
with insects that he had caught.
The diet fed to the birds consists of a nectar mix (2 parts Complan, 2
parts honey, 1 part mixed cereal, vitamin drops), minced and diced beef
heart, fruit and flowering plants and an egg mix as follows:

A lorikeet diet consisting of honey and mixed baby cereal, Complan
and fruit, blended together, was added soon after incubation began, being
offered in a small cup hung in the Albizzia. Mealworms were offered
initially but the birds showed no interest in them. One of the Bottle-
brushes began to flower when the birds went to nest, the profusion of
blossoms resulting in many winged insects flying into the cage which the
male hunted with vigour.
The female left the nest two to three times a day to feed and on one
occasion was seen to fly around the aviary with a white feather in her bill,
with the male following behind singing loudly.
Sixteen days after the egg was noticed a chick was observed in the nest
late in the afternoon as the female left to feed. She returned quickly to
the nest and continued to incubate.
The following morning she was off the nest and a quick inspection
revealed that the chick had died overnight.
The male was soon chasing the female around the aviary relentlessly.
Later in the day she was found in a weakened condition on the ground,
still being harrassed by the male. Some nectar mix was provided for her
behind a small tussock of grass and she drank from it with relish. A small
branch from a peppermint tree was provided for her in a corner to give
her some refuge from the male.
The next morning the female had fully recovered and the male was
returning to the nest and looking into the cup as if trying to feed the
dead chick. Because of the male's persistence in returning to the nest and
his aggressive behaviour towards the female, it was felt that the nest should
be torn up so that they would be encouraged to start nesting again.
Within a few days, construction of a new nest began in a similar posi-
tion to the old one. Late one afternoon the female was found in a lethar-
gic state on the aviary floor, after being harrassed by the male once again.
The nectar mix was again placed on the floor for her and she drank from
it readily.
Construction of the second nest took about six days and it was three to
four days before an egg was observed. The male did not mind nest inspec-
tions, but they were kept to a minimum and were only made after she had
left to feed. A second egg was noted four days later.
In early October, with the increase in evening temperatures, a moth
trap was set each night so that moths could be added to the diet. These
were fed in the morning and afternoon and were distributed in bushes and

grasses with the hope that they would remain and not fly straight out of
the aviary. The male quickly learnt this feeding routine and would wait
near the aviary door before each feed, hovering over the bag of moths like
a hummingbird.
The female added several large feathers to the rim of her nest which
made it very difficult to tell, from outside the cage, whether she was
sitting or not. However, she continued to leave the nest each time that
fresh food was available. The male would often feed moths to the female
after she left the nest.
On 15th October the nest was checked after 16 days' incubation and
revealed the presence of a chick. The following morning the male was seen
taking a small moth up to the nest while the female left to feed. The male
spent most of the day off the nest and the method of placing moths in the
bushes was proving successful with the male catching winged insects and
taking them to the nest throughout the day.
The male was seen to catch small moths and pound them on a branch
before flying to the nest to feed the chick; the female was observed to do
the same.
Eggshells were found on the aviary floor three days after the first chick
was observed and a quick inspection of the nest revealed a second chick.
The size of the moths being fed to the chicks was increasing and the
male was seen to remove the less palatable head and wings, leaving only
the soft abdomen. The chicks could be heard calling loudly as the female
spent less time on the nest because of the warmer weather. Faecal sacs
were deposited on the cage mesh by both birds, resulting in dozens of
white lumps on the black wire.
One morning, about 19 days after hatching, one chick left the nest for
about 15 minutes, returning to the nest for the rest of the day. The follow-
ing day the chick left the nest again and was followed by its nest mate in
the afternoon. As each day went by, both birds spent more and more time
out of the nest. They were fed by both adult birds who would dip moths
in the nectar prior to giving them to the chicks.
About six days after leaving the nest, in early November, one chick
was seen drinking the nectar mix by itself. At this stage It was noted that
the Albizzia plant was infested with aphids and lady bug larvae and adults.
Although it was not observed, these may have been used in rearing the
young Spinebills, along with the other winged insects offered.
By mid-November, both juveniles were independent of their parents.
The male, however, continued to feed them moths that he had caught. The
female was preoccupied with nest reconstruction. She was seen to add new
materials for several days, and it was decided to move the juveniles to an
adjoining aviary to prevent them from interfering with any further attempts

by the adults to nest.
Soon after the two juveniles were removed, the female went down to
nest again, sitting on two eggs. Fourteen days after the eggs were first seen,
eggshells were found on the aviary floor. One chick was successfully reared,
the second egg failing to hatch.
As soon as the chick from the second clutch was independent, it was
removed to another aviary with four juvenile Banded Wrens Malurus splen-
dens. By late December 1984 the female was again sitting on three eggs in
the same nest and after incubating for about 16 days, eggshells were found
in early January 1985 on the aviary floor.
The male was once again diligent in catching moths and taking them to
the nest where a chick could be heard calling. By late January the chick
was old enough to leave the nest, and soon after doing so, the nest collapsed.
It was then discovered that there were two dead chicks in the bottom of
the nest, about 1-2 days old.
By late January it was obvious that the first three juvenile birds were all
males, the black band across the breast becoming evident about 45-50 days
after the birds fledged. The band becomes evident at the shoulders first,
then spreads across the breast.
In early February all the juvenile birds were banded and the last ju-
venile, which was about 20 days old, was weighed (10 g).
On 11th February 1985 the breeding female disappeared. Her body was
found two days later, hidden amongst the many grass tussocks planted in
the enclosure. Because of decay, it was impossible to carry out a post mor-
tem and the cause of her death is unknown. It is felt, however, that she
died from exhaustion due to aggressiveness from the male. The female had
been almost continually involved in the breeding cycle for nearly six
months and must have been approaching exhaustion.
The male was relentless in his behaviour towards the female as he
chased and drove her back to the nest after each clutch had fledged. After
the nest collapsed, however, she could not return to it to escape the male's
attacks. As a result, it is thought that she became progressively weaker
over a short period of time and finally died.
In the future it is hoped that the experience gained with these birds will
prevent the future loss of such a prolific breeding bird, and that with clo-
ser observation, pairs can be separated before such tragic losses occur. We
hope to be able to obtain some new females prior to the next season's
start and have them settled in with their mates so that we can continue,
and establish a breeding programme for these attractive birds.

Neville Brickell writes from the Natal Avicultural Society, South
Africa to report on an excellent achievement by an Ashburton aviculturist,
Ken Arnold, who has recently bred the Cabanis's Bunting Emberiza
cabanisi. This is the first recorded breeding of this species by an avicul-
turist in Africa. The date previously unknown to ornithologists and
aviculturists alike is now given: incubation period 14 days; nestling
period 16 days; the male plays no part in nest-building or incubation;
the male fed the female on the nest; the preferred livefood was grass-
hoppers with the legs removed.

stronghold on the south-western peninsula - and from where it died out
earlier this century. This work will be carried out in liaison with all the
major conservation bodies.
His work will focus on remaining wild populations in Ireland and Wales,
where ecological requirements will be assessed and compared with avail-
able resources in Cornwall. Alongside comparative habitat and dietary
analyses, Richard will investigate the possibilities for a fully integrated
captive-breeding programme in which holders of this species will be en-
couraged to participate. The Padstow Bird Gardens on the North Cornish
coast already has three pairs, and these will form the nucleus of the cap-
tive-breeding experiments and ethological studies.
In connection with this work and preparations for possible reintro-
duction, Richard urgently asks all aviculturists with an interest in this
species (including past and present owners) to contact him either through
the Department of Zoology, the University, Glasgow G12 8QQ, or at his
home in Cornwall (Hillside Cottage, Hellandbridge, Bodmin, Cornwall

The Avicultural Federation of Australia has sent advance notification
of their 1st International Avicultural Convention which is being hosted by
the New South Wales Avicultural Council and will be held at The Central
Coast Leagues Club, Gosford, N.S.W. from 10th - 13th April 1987. The
theme of the Convention will be Conservation and the list of speakers
includes several well-known members of this Society such as Robin Res-
tall, Tony Silva and Charles Sivelle. The Council will be donating 80% of
the profits to the establishment of a captive breeding programme for en-
dangered avian species.
The Convention will be held in a beautiful setting and there are several
interesting entertainments planned including a bird display at Old Sydney
Town (a recreation of old Australia) that promises to be enormous inclu-
ding around 90% of all parrots kept in Australia.
We hope to include further information in a future issue but meanwhile
if any members are interested in taking part, they should write to Tom

The twenty-third International Zoo Yearbook will be of particular
interest to many of our members for the special section concerns birds
of prey and reflects the diverse means by which current problems of
breeding this group of birds, and their reintroduction to the wild are being
tackled. Internationally distinguished authors have written 28 papers on
this theme with subjects ranging from breeding the Andean Condor
(London, New York and West Berlin), the American Bald Eagle and other
species at East Berlin, and the first captive-bred Secretary Bird (Walsrode)
to guidelines for rehabilitation of injured raptors (P.J. Llewellyn and
P.E. Brain), discussion on the breeding and reintroduction of the Barn
Owl (Caroline Brown) and many other interesting topics.
Members will remember the special issue of the Avicultural Magazine
(1981, No. 4) devoted to birds of prey, which, for the first time in the
journal's history, had to be reprinted owing to unprecedented demand. It
is obvious that there is widespread interest and concern about the manage-
ment and future of birds of prey and it is gratifying to read J.E. Cooper, in
the opening article:.'The opportunities offered by captive breeding
must not be underestimated. As Cade (1982) has pointed out, the exper-
tise now available means that no raptor species need ever become extinct.
This is not the same as saving the free-living population but few, surely,
would argue that it is better for a species to disappear than to survive only
in a captive state'.
Section 2 contains 30 papers on new developments in the zoo world,
under the headings of Breeding, Husbandry, Hand-rearing and Buildings
and Exhibits. Only four of these concern birds - does this reflect lack of
interest in birds in the zoo world, or inertia on the part of Curators of
Birds in writing about their subjects? This inertia is not unknown to the
Editor of the Avicultural Magazine\
Section 3 is a Reference Section covering species bred in 1981 and
multiple generation births, a census of rare animals in captivity in 1982
and studbooks and world registers for rare species of wild animals in cap-
tivity. Author and subject indices to Volumes 22 and 23 conclude the
section.
The standard of this publication is, as always, of the highest and
this is a particularly interesting volume.

I read with interest Mr. K. Dolton's letter (1986, 1:59), regarding Allan
Hume and his Indian collection.
As far as I was aware, Hume never kept any living birds in India,
and I believe that the reference to 62,000 birds refers to his collection of
skins which was the greatest collection of Indian birds ever assembled by a
private individual. In The History of the Collections in the British
Museum, Natural History , R. Bowdler Sharpe mentions that the Hume
collection was the largest private skin collection in the world at the time,
consisting of over 60,000 bird skins and 16,000 eggs.
Regarding the naming of Hume's Bar-tailed Pheasant, Allan Hume
noticed the tail feathers of the bird in the headdress of a native of Manipur
territory. After much effort Hume was able to obtain a skin from native
collectors, and a live specimen of the bird that was to be named Hume's
Bar-tailed Pheasant, the name humiae was actually given to the bird in
honour of Allan Hume's wife.
I hope the above might be of some interest to readers.

Further notes on immature coloration of the Cape Parrot (Poicephalus
robustus) and subspecies (P.r. suahelicus).
There seems to be a shortage of information available detailing the
coloration of young Cape Parrots leaving the nest, and I felt that the
following information gained through successful breedings in aviaries last
year (1985) and close observation of immature specimens of P.r. robustus
and P.r suahelicus should be kept for future reference - particularly since
there is one striking difference between the two on leaving the nest, apart
from the depth of green body colour, dark green/olive colour in robustus
and lime green with silver neck in suahelicus with a darker green back.
In my previous letter (1986, 1:56-57), I confirmed that, from a success-
ful breeding of four young suahelicus (the Zimbabwean Cape Parrot), all
the young of both sexes leave the nest with a large round crown of

orange/pink feathers, which are later moulted out in the first moult or at
around six to seven months old. At around eight to ten months old, one
can easily sex the young, for the hen birds then regrow their orange/pink
feathers starting at the base of the top mandible - meanwhile the crown of
orange/pink feathers on top of the head has disappeared. The young cock
birds do not regrow these orange/pink feathers but sometimes retain a few
orange/pink feathers on the crown of the head for a little longer. The adult
cock bird, of course, has no orange or pink feathers on the head, thus
making identification of the sexes very easy. The four young that were
bred at Mitchell Park last year have moulted out to be two cocks and two
hens.
Now the reverse is true of the South African Cape Parrot P. robustus. A
colleague from the Cape, Melvyn Reabow, who reared two young P. robus-
tus last year, advises me that both the young left the nest with no colora-
tion on their heads at all, but at approximately she months old one bird
grew orange feathers (as apart from the orange/pink crown of P. suahelicus)
starting from the top mandible; the other did not, thus confirming that
they are a cock and hen.
Thus, to summarise a strange deviation in the immature coloration of
the two subspecies, all immature P.r. robustus have no coloration on the
head on leaving the nest but all immature P.r. suahelicus have a large round
distinctive crown of orange/pink feathers.
It is fair to point out that the adult hen suahelicus has a far larger
coloration above the top mandible than the hen robustus , and it is orange/
pink (cerise) in colour, but a distinctive orange only, in robustus.

THE AVICULTURAL MAGAZINE welcomes original articles that have not been
published elsewhere and that essentially concern the aviculture of a particular bird or
group of birds, or that describe their natural history. Articles should be preferably
typewritten, with double spacing, and the scientific names as well as the vernacular
names of birds should be given. References cited in the text should be listed at the
end of the article. Line drawings should be in Indian ink on thick paper or card;
black and white photographs which illustrate a particular point in the article will be
used where possible and should be clearly captioned. If authors wish their eventual
return, they must say so when submitting the article and write their name on the
back of each photograph.

The Brown-bellied Amazilia is one of the most common humming birds
of the coastal area of Peru, from Huacho and Sayan in the north to Pesco
and lea in the south. It prefers shrubbery and wooded terrain on the coast
and low Andean slopes but can also be found in the parks and gardens of
Lima.
Description
The birds in my collection were probably collected within the depart-
ment of Lima and both male and female have glittering green throats.
Birds from the more southerly part of their range tend to have more of a
blue-green throat.
Male: upperparts bronze-green, throat and upper breast glittering
green, belly chestnut, under tail coverts white, tail rufous edged bronze
and white centre to breast, white thighs and ocular spot, bill flesh coloured
tipped black.
Female: same as male but with greatly reduced white centre to breast.
Housing and method employed in this breeding
The male Amazilia was housed hi a stock cage, 3 ft long (0.91 m) by
16 in (0.41 m) high and deep.
The female was housed in a mixed flight of mainly female humming
birds. The flight measured 14 ft (4.27 m) long, by 4 ft (1.22 m) wide by
6 ft (1.83 m) high, being well planted with potted house plants. The other
occupants of this flight were females of the following species: Fork-tailed
Woodnymph Thalurania furcata, Chestnut-breasted Coronet Boissonneaua
matthewsii , Tourmaline Sunangel Heliangelus exortis , Bronze-tailed Comet

Speckled Hummingbird Adelomyia melanogenys. Neither of these males
has been moulted in captivity, but once they have completed their first
moult they will have to be caged as both of these species can be rather
aggressive.
If pairs of hummingbirds are kept together continually, this usually has
a negative result on their breeding activities through continual aggression.
If only females are housed in the flight and a female becomes broody, a
male of her species can easily be introduced. I usually leave the male in for
only one hour in the morning before leaving for work, then again for one
hour in the evening before returning him to his stock cage. I usually try to
observe display and copulation. I carry on this procedure until the nest is
completed and the eggs have been laid.
Display
The female enters the male's territory in a slow, floating, butterfly-like
flight. She perches close to the male making a loud piping call. The male
approaches the female making a pendulum-like display before perching
next to her, touching her by her gape with the tip of his bill and uttering
a low bubbling song. He will open and close his wings at a 45 degrees
angle in very exaggerated movements almost like a man using his arms for
semaphore. The male then flies over the female and lands on the other side
of her and continues with this display. The female will then usually fly
over the male and land on the opposite side of him. Then the male will fly
over her and land on the other side of her. This display can carry on for
several seconds. To watch the birds making progress along the perch is like
watching children playing leapfrog. During this display the male usually
alights on the female's back and mating takes place. On some occasions the
female may land on the male's nape or back to stimulate mating and false
mating takes place.
Nest-building ; incubation and chick development
The genus Amazilia is probably one of the most successfully and easily
adaptable of hummingbirds in the wild. These birds will breed all year
round when conditions are suitable and only cease when moulting. The
female Amazilia in my collection can finish a complete nest in five days
preferring to use natural cotton wool as the base to the nest, bound with
fresh cobwebs. They will add small pieces of dried leaves and rootlets to
the exterior of the nest. The nest where the chicks were reared was built in
a Heptapleurum arboricola. During the nest-building the female was ob-

very stressful and she was visibly shaking.
After egg was laid she slumped forward still holding on to the rim of
the nest with bill pointing to the ground. She stayed in this position for
several minutes untd she composed herself, then flew off to feed.
Incubation proceeded with nothing out of order happening. On 20th
September I was getting concerned that the eggs had not started to hatch
but at 8.00 p.m. one chick hatched, 18 days from first egg being laid.

ELGAR -- BROWN-BELLIED AMAZILIA
Description of young Amazilia
Upperparts bronze-green, upper tail coverts rufous. All underparts
pale brown, vent and thigh white, ocular spot white, upper mandible
black, lower flesh coloured.
I believe this is the first time that this species has been bred in Britain,
and indeed in Europe.

The Five-coloured Mannikin is distributed on the Lesser Sunda and
Timor group of islands, being found on Lombok, Sumbawa, Flores, Alor,
Sumba, Timor, Sernatta and Balar.
Overall size and shape is about that of the Spice Finch. The forehead
and face are dark chestnut with pale feather shafts, most noticeable on
the ear coverts. Crown and nape are a darker, less bright chestnut with
obscure greyish subterminal bands or tips to the feathers. The throat is a
very dark chestnut brown. The mantle, back,w ing coverts and outer webs
of primaries and secondaries are a less dark chestnut brown. The under-
side of the wing coverts are buff. The rump, upper tail coverts and the
wide fringes of the pointed central tail feathers are a deep reddish yellow
to bright, light golden. The median line of central tail feathers and outer
web of others is chestnut brown, the rest of the tail being dull drab. The
tibial feathers and under tail coverts are black; the rest of the underparts
below the throat are white. The irides are dark brown, legs and feet grey.
The bill bluish grey. The sexes are alike. (Goodwin, 1982).
In the spring of 1981 I had the good fortune of being able to purchase
several different species of mannikins from the Lower Sunda Islands.
Unfortunately other than Pallid Mannikins, and four Five-coloured, all
the rest were single specimens of a species. Obviously I was rather hesi-
tant in purchasing odd birds, not knowing if any more would become
available but I purchased the four Five-coloured Mannikins. On closer
inspection the birds' flight feathers were seen to be in poor condition so
they were put in a 4 ft (1.22 m) flight cage. Unfortunately they were of a
very nervous disposition, so although they could not fly very well I put
them in an inside flight measuring 6x6x2 ft (1.83 x 1.83 x 0.60 m),
with some young Red-headed Parrot Finches and Star Finches. Here
they settled much better.
As summer approached, the birds started to moult and soon replaced
their flight and tail feathers and they were soon flying a lot better. The
four Five-coloured Mannikins were transferred to an aviary with an inside
flight into my birdroom, together with a pair of Red-headed Parrot
Finches and a pair of Star Finches. The overall enclosure was some 14 ft
long by 6 ft high and 5 ft wide (4.27 x 1,83 x 1.52 m). The aviary was
planted with kerria, honeysuckle, elderberry and blackthorn, not over-

grown but certainly covered from the top by the honeysuckle and some
adjacent tall conifers. Large bunches of seeding grasses were hung on the
wire for the birds to eat the seeding heads and the Parrot Finches to pick
off any insects.
The Five-coloured Mannikins settled in quickly and soon paired off.
It became noticeable that both the cock birds were slightly larger than
the hens and they had whiter underparts, though this could normally
only be seen in good natural light.
Both cock birds started to display. This consisted of the bird stretch-
ing upwards, looking straight ahead, raising the feathers around the back
of the neck and head, and singing an almost inaudible song. (In part
similar to Chestnut-breasted Finches, although with this species there is a
greater variety in the actual display).
One pair nested in a box inside the honeysuckle. Unfortunately after
laying two eggs the hen was found dead for no apparent reason. The eggs
were fostered by a pair of Bengalese Finches which successfully hatched
and reared the young. The young were fed on soaked seed (white millet
and canary seed), small maggots, a proprietary brand of eggfood and
greenfood, normally lettuce.
After the loss of the hen, I was expecting the two cock birds to start
bickering over the remaining hen but this did not happen. Instead, a nest
was built in amongst the bunches of seeding grasses, approximately 4 ft
(1.22 m) from the ground. The nest itself was completely made of dried
grasses and it measured some 7 in long by 4 in (0.17 x 0.10 m); it was
eliptical in shape and the actual nest chamber was approximately 3 in
(0.07 m) in diameter.
Six eggs were laid, clear white in colour . The birds sat alternately, the
hen only incubating the eggs at night. After approximately 14 days, the
young hatched, light pink in colour and covered in a small amount of
white down. They were reared on the same diet as the two reared by
the Bengalese Finches, with the addition of soaked millet sprays plus
any small insects caught by the adults in the aviary. The young were
brooded by the parents until they were approximately 10 days old.
The five young left the nest after 21 days at which time they were
basically a dull bufflsh-grey, with some dull white on the abdomen. The
feet and beak were a very dark brown in colour. They were extremely
nervous and special care was taken when feeding them. The parents were
very protective of the young, incessantly calling them to roost together
in a disused nest-box. The young were soon feeding themselves after
seven days but the parents continued to feed them for two weeks after
they left the nest.
At the end of the two weeks, the cock and hen built a new nest inside

the shelter in a 'ball of wire'. Five eggs were laid, of which four hatched
and were reared.
The five young from the first nest were left with the adults and
caused no problem to the new young or to any other birds in the aviary.
By now it was well into autumn and any further nesting activity was
stopped. The young took several months to moult fully into adult plu-
mage. Their moult was similar to that of aviary-bred Chestnut-breasted
and Yellow-rumped Mannikins in that normally a few dark feathers break
through after 12 weeks and then the feathers are gradually replaced, the
last being those on the face and head.
In general, when Five-coloured Mannikins are settled into their quar-
ters, they become hardy, peaceable and as long as they are not dis-
turbed, spend many hours sitting in one spot, normally sunning them-
selves.
Their behaviour is not at any time like some species of mannikins,
i.e. gregarious social preening, etc. The Five-oloured Mannikins always
keep a few inches' distance from each other except when the cock
displays.
Since the first year that I bred this species, they have bred with
varying success. After purchasing my original stock, I was offered some
fresh blood in 1984. There was a noticeable difference in so much that
the original birds had a bright orange/rust coloured rump, whereas the
new arrivals had an almost black rump, but otherwise they were
identical.

During the summer of 1984 I saw, for the first time, a small, chestnut
brown bird at a London dealer's shop in a consignment of birds which had
recently arrived from Tanzania. There were also two &amp;apos;birds&amp;apos; which looked
like miniature sparrows and were the same size and shape as the chestnut
bird. Although I could not then identify them, I thought that they must
be of the same species and bought all three.
The birds were installed in an aviary measuring l l A ft wide by 8 ft high
and 15 ft long (2.29 x 2.44 x 4.57 m), covered with a PVC roof, the plants
inside being watered by hose.
They seemed very wild and not really suitable to life in a cage. They
always cowered or flew madly round whenever approached and always
seemed to be at the back. I established their identity as Sorella eminibey
whose range extends from the Sudan to northern Tanzania. According to
the field guide, the cocks have an out-of-colour phase when they look like
hens but I have not found this and my adult males retain their chestnut
plumage throughout the year.
Unfortunately during the winter I lost the cock and it was not until
the beginning of May 1985 that I saw two for sale in a shop. I bought both
and moved one hen into an adjoining aviary of the same size and then put
one cock in with each hen. There was a lot of chattering, typical of English
sparrows and almost immediately interest was shown in the nest-boxes of
which there were three, measuring 6 x 4 x 4 in (0.15 x 0.10 x 0.10 m), in
each aviary, of the same shape as a Budgerigar nest-box. The birds quickly
filled all six boxes with very fine grasses and hundreds of feathers. Each
hen laid three eggs, which were bluish white covered with brown speckles,
and within three weeks of buying the cocks, one pair had two young but
the other pair's eggs were clear. The two chicks were reared and then
another three. The other pair eventually reared two young but they had
a lot of clear eggs. The incubation period was 18-19 days.
I feed these birds on a mixture of white millet, pannicum millet and
canary seeds. Millet sprays are given each day and enjoyed by all the birds,
also hard-boiled eggs mashed and mixed with chick crumbs. This is fed all
the year round. Mealworms are supplied during the spring and summer and
are probably taken by the Chestnut Sparrows though I have not actually
seen this. As the aviaries are planted, the birds doubtless find many

insects.
The plumage of the young on fledging is the same as that of the hen,
the only difference being a bright yellow, almost waxlike bill and white
gape flaps which are lost during the next two weeks. The young males
come into colour very slowly.
The Chestnut Sparrows live with a collection of waxbills and show no
aggression towards them except when breeding and they then guard the
top and perch of the nest-box.
As I had some young from each pair, I decided to keep them and try
to breed from them the following year (1986) so I put rings on them and
moved them together into another aviary so they could moult out. I was
thus able to select more pairs for breeding.
I believe that this is the first time that this species has been bred in this
country and it is a pity that the birds are too nervous to allow me to get
near enough to photograph them.
As described above the Chestnut Sparrow Sorella eminibey has been
bred by Mr. Alan Brooker and this is believed to be the first success in this
country. Anyone knowing of a previous breeding, or of any other reason
that would disqualify this claim, is asked to inform the Hon. Secretary.

By Dr. YOSHIKA ONIKI
(Dept, of Zoology, State University of Sao Paulo, Rio Claro, Brazil)
The Blue and White Swallow has a very wide range, occurring through
out South America from the highlands of Costa Rica right down to Tierra
del Fuego. It is a small bird (13 cm long; 11 g) with an iridescent dark blue
back and undertail coverts and white belly. The young is brownish grey
where the adult is blue. Although this is not a species regularly kept in
captivity, it is interesting to report on its habits and nesting as it is com-
monly seen in urban areas, flying around buildings, chirping now and then,
alone or in loose groups. They can also be seen flying graciously over the
large sugar cane fields, pastures, or the edges of woods not far from cities,
to which they may return to spend the night. Sometimes they perch on
telephone or electric wires to rest. At times, one perches on the ground
and picks up insects. This takes only a few seconds and soon they resume
their fast flight and soft chirps.
Nest and nesting material
On 12th January 1977 I was shown a nest with three young. It was
placed on top of a closet within an office at the University of Campinas
(UNICAMP), at a height of 2.7 m, where a burlap bag had been casually
left. The birds placed their nest inside the bag and the nest rim was shaped
according to the burlap opening. The nest dimensions were: external
diameter 0.13 x 0.075 m, internal diameter 0.07 x 0.06 m, external height
0.03 m and internal height 0.02 m. The nest weighed 3.4 g, of which 2.5 g
was of grass stems and the remainder was of 32 black feathers and white
down, and one long (12 cm) black body feather.
The body of the nest was mainly of yellow grass stems, roots and
rootlets, while dark pigeon feathers and white down formed the lining,
making it soft and fluffy. On 10 May, when the nest was collected, it was
full of white scales of feather sheaths. The nest was kept clean of faecal
sacs. Perhaps eggshells were left in the nest and crushed under the young,
but half an eggshell was found near the burlap bag on 17th January.
Young
Assuming the young were 0-1 days old when found on 12th January,
the nestling period was about 23 days, for on 3rd February 1977, at 14:00,
they were flying around the room while both parents were flying outside

and calling to them. Skutch (1952) reports 26 and 27 days as nestling
periods for Costa Rican birds, longer than I found. The young were quite
brownish, with short tails, and were peeping constantly. When the window
was opened they left the room. On 14th January, when the young were
3-4 days old, two large young were leaning on top of the third. On 17th
January (Fig. 1) two young were larger than the third but all were still
blind. They had swollen and light yellow gape angles, down projecting
from the head and back, and pinfeathers growing on the back and belly.
On 19th January, the eyes of the young were slightly open and at
14:00 they weighed 5, 10, and 12 g respectively. The next day they
weighed 4.5, 10 and 12 g at 13:35. At this time, the smallest young
peeped but the two larger ones moved over the sack to hide away from the
nest. On 19th January, wing quills of the two larger young were 0.4 and
0.5 mm long and tail pinfeathers measured 0.3 and 0.4 mm. The next day,
wing quill and tail were 0.1 to 0.2 mm larger but weight increase was nil.

minutes there were 15 and 19 feedings of the young. On 14th and 17th
January, 32 feeding intervals averaged 10.7 minutes (range = 2-46 minutes)
and feedings were slow at about 14:00 and 16:00, and rapid at about
15:00. On three occasions, a single adult fed all three young in one visit,
but on other visits it was not possible to ascertain how many young were
fed. At times, after a feeding or between two feedings of young, an adult
ate a faecal sac. If disturbed, the adult dropped the sac next to the nest
and flew out hurriedly. On 19th January, when young were weighed and
measured for the first time, there was only one feeding in a 100-minutes
observation, and the adult perched frequently in the square opening to the
room, gave 'peep' calls and flew about a lot, but fed only once after 16
minutes of watching immobile from the nest rim. After this, the adult left
silently.
Because of protection afforded by the buildings and cliffs in which
nests are placed, young Blue and White Swallows can remain in the nest
for a long time despite it being open and cup-shaped. As a result, they are
well plumaged and strong-flying and able to follow the adults, which are
fast-moving birds that depend on gathering food in the air.

When the young were 1-2 days old, mosquitoes were hovering above
them and trying to bite. Due to the long time young remained in the nest,
both they and it were infested with small mites, which caused them to
scratch a lot. When young are able to move around they even sit out of
the nest perhaps to avoid mites. This infestation by mites seems to be
common among birds that nest in protected areas such as under roofs
in buildings. This was also observed in a nest of a Rufous-collared Sparrow
Zonotrichia capensis at Rio Claro, placed on a large fern vase inside a
building (pers. obs.).
Behaviour of adult
On 14th January an adult sat on the nest for six minutes after one
feeding, but no other brooding was noted.
There were two holes, of about 0.25 m diameter, in the office wall,
one square and the other round, planned for a future ventilation system.
I was surprised with the consistency with which adults entered the building
from the square hole, sometimes perching briefly on it, and left from the
round hole. Once one started to enter through the round hole but turned
and entered through the square one. At times, both adults arrived together
and one entered to feed while the other circled around outside the build-
ing. Feeding of the young was rapid, and the adult picked up pieces
dropped, but young remained in the nest peeping loudly when the adults

Breeding season
Euler (1900:17) reports that the species has the 'same 5 nesting habits as
Progne chafybea, the Grey-breasted Martin, using roofs of houses in farms
and villages. He reports four white eggs in one nest. Ihering (1900: 207)
says it nests from mid-August in Sao Paulo City. Two fledglings, with pale
gape angles, were with an adult on the biology building at the Universidade
Estadual Paulista (UNESP), Rio Claro, on 26th October 1984. Two other
fledglings were with an adult there on 28th January 1985. At Rio Claro
and Campinas nests were mainly found in January and February. On 27th
January 1985 at UNICAMP, adults entered to feed noisy young in two
nests. Both nests were between the roof and a rectangular light bulb.
Weight and measurements
In the cool mornings of 4th and 5th August 1984, Blue and White
Swallows were mist-netted at the Agricultural Experiment Station in
Ubatuba, Sao Paulo State. Nineteen weights averaged 11.0 g and 18
cloacal temperatures averaged 38.7*C. Average measurements of 11
individuals were: bill - 5.2 mm; tarsus - 10.3 mm; tail - 50.3 mm; and
wing - 93.7 mm.

(Deputy Director and Curator of Birds)
Since the inception of Tierpark Berlin 29 years ago, we have systemati-
cally put together a collection consisting of breeding pairs or groups aimed
at maximum reproduction. This approach is based on modern zoological
principles, i.e. the captive reproduction of rare and endangered species and
subspecies, and I would now like to report on our experiences in this
regard with birds.
Naturally, we have not confined our programme to endangered species
alone and have also bred more common species as one does not know and
cannot predict which birds that are common today will be the endangered
species of tomorrow. Furthermore, it is important, as has often been
pointed out, to breed the more common species in order to gain insight
into the management needs of endangered forms. I would remind readers
that important bird of prey breeding programmes were begun with the
American Kestrel Falco sparverius and the Andean Condor Vultur gryphus
and in the case of cranes, with the Sandhill Crane Grus canadensis.
A good example is shown by the pelican colony at Tierpark Berlin. In
1958 the pelicans produced the first clutches and in 1961 (Dathe, 1961,
1962; Grummt, 1961) a chick was hatched by the European White Pelicans
Pelecanus onocrotalus. At that time no one was aware of a reduction in
the wild population, still less that the bird would become endangered. In
the interim there has been such a drastic reduction in the population of
the Dalmatian Pelican Pelecanus crispus . that the bird is now listed as
'vulnerable' in the Red Data Book and is listed on Appendix I of CITES.
In the report of the Council of Europe for 1981, entitled 'Birds in need
Special Protection in Europe', the Dalmatian Pelican is listed as 'endan-
gered', as is the European/Asiatic population of the European White Peli-
can.
Since our first breeding success we have systematically studied the
behaviour and breeding biology of these birds and to date have contin-
uously bred them for more than 23 years (Grummt, 1983, 1984).
Over the years 20 European White Pelicans have been hatched from
three different pairs, most of which have been successfully reared. Nine
of the pelicans hatched at Tierpark Berlin are of the full second genera-
tion. Furthermore, two chicks each of the following species have also been
bred: American White Pelican Pelecanus erythrorhynchos , Dalmatian

Pelican P. crispus and Brown Pelican P. occidentalis.
Based on our experiences, the following conditions should be pro-
vided for successful pelican breeding:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999584" page_id="56954005"  page_num="191" year="" vol="">
1. Large groups of birds to facilitate social stimulation and synchro-
nisation;
2. Optimum feeding on freshwater fish, if possible, because, except for
the Brown Pelican, all other species of pelicans feed almost exclu-
sively on freshwater fish;
3. Provision of adequate nesting sites and nesting material.

A species which deserves very close scrutiny is the Greater Bustard
Otis tarda. The north-west border of its distribution occurs in the German
Democratic Republic. While approximately 800 of these magnificent birds
ocurred in our country in 1975, its numbers have now shrunk to around
350 despite intensive protective measures. The first breeding success in
captivity was achieved by Dr. Gewalt (1965) at the West Berlin Zoo in
1964. Since 1958 we have kept Greater Bustards at Tierpark Berlin in an
enclosure of 2500m^. In 1972 a hen laid four fertile eggs, all of which
hatched and two of the young were successfully reared (Grummt, 1977).
Unfortunately, we lost the breeding birds which put an end to what
seemed to be an exciting beginning with the species. At the moment we
have 2:3 birds of this species. This year one of the hens laid but the eggs
were thin-shelled. The other hens should reach sexual maturity in 1985
so that our chances look a lot brighter for the future. One male was very
active this year and went into full display. He copulated numerous times
with one of the hens.
A 'first' for Tierpark Berlin, and one that has brought us great pleasure
was a breeding among our cranes. In 1980 we received a pair of Manchurian
or Red-crowned Cranes Grus japonensis from the Peking Zoo. In 1981 the
birds produced a clutch of two eggs, one of which was fertile but did not
hatch. During 1982 and 1983, due to disturbances, this pair did not lay. In
the period between 29th April and 28th May 1984, the Manchurian Cranes
produced six eggs, which were collected and placed in the incubator. All
six eggs were fertile and five of them subsequently hatched. Of the five
chicks, one was very weak upon hatching and died 12 days later. Another
chick died as a result of a yolk sac rupture. The remaining three chicks
were reared without any difficulty. It is our intention to build a special
breeding area where we shall try to put together additional breeding pairs
using the three birds hatched in Berlin and four additional specimens
received from the Pyongyang Zoo, North Korea, and one male on breeding
loan from Rotterdam Zoo.

In the case of storks and ibises, we have had excellent success with
certain species. In our Waldrapp Geronticus eremita colony, which consists
of 20 birds, we have reared 11 young since 1981. European Spoonbills
Phtalea leucorodia , Scarlet Ibis Eudocimus albas have been breeding
successfully for a number of years. Unfortunately the breeding success
achieved with the African Marabous Leptoptilos crumeniferus in 1979
was not repeated, as the breeding male was killed by the female. The two
remaining pairs, which consist of the original breeding female with a new
mate and the female hatched in Berlin paired with an imported male, both
displayed this year and showed nesting behaviour so that there appears to
be hope for the future with this species.
Black Storks Ciconia nigra have reared young on numerous occasions
and White Storks C. ciconia bred here consistently. In 1981 we received a
pair of Eastern White Storks C boyciana from the Moscow Zoo. This pair
is very compatible and we look to the future for successful reproduction.
As for the pheasants, I should like to mention our great success since
1968 with the White Eared Pheasant Crossoptilon crossoptilon (Grummt,
1980). At the moment we are expanding our pheasantry and six new
aviaries are already completed. This will give us the opportunity to keep
and breed other endangered galliformes.
A group that deserves our utmost attention is the parrot family, par-
ticularly several New World species whose numbers have been greatly
reduced due to traffic in live birds and the destruction of their natural
habitat. With the exception of three species, all parrots are protected
under CITES, which will curtail the acquisition of new birds from the
wild. Therefore the captive breeding of parrots has taken on greater im-
portance. Rosemary Low, the well-known parrot specialist and expert,
reported on this at the Jean Delacour/IFCB symposium in Los Angeles
(Low, 1983).
We have been highly successful in breeding the HaJmahera Eclectus
Eclectus roratus vosmaeri at Tierpark Berlin. One pair of birds has reared
a total of 32 chicks between 1965 and 1977 (Grummt, 1973b). The
Cuban Amazon Parrot Amazon leucocephala first bred successfully in
1981.
Although we have kept macaws since the foundation of Tierpark
Berlin, it was only at the beginning of the 1970s that we started to try
to breed with these parrots. The first breeding occurred in 1974. One
pair of Buffon's Macaw Ara ambigua and a pair of Military Macaws A,,
militaris were housed together in an 8 m^ aviary. AH four birds were
compatible. The Buffon's Macaws nested in a hollow tree trunk, while
the Military Macaws simply laid their eggs on the floor of the aviary.
The Buffon's Macaws hatched three young, of which two were reared.

This was the first captive breeding of this species. The Military Macaws
hatched a single chick which they reared and the following year reared
two chicks. The Buffon's Macaws reared a single chick in the years 1975,
1977 and 1979.
Due to the fact that the keepers were changed a number of times, the
macaw breeding came to a standstill. It was not until 1984 that attempts
were again made and fortunately these were successful. The breeding
pairs are now housed in indoor aviaries that are about 2=3m 2 ,
The pair of Buffon's Macaws which nested from 1974-1979 laid four
eggs between 29th May and 8th June 1984. The first egg was broken, but
the remaining three hatched. Unfortunately, two of the chicks died. The
remaining one was taken away from the parents when it was 34 days old
and hand-reared.
A pair of Scarlet Macaws A. macao laid a clutch of three eggs between
20th May and 25th May 1984 behind a board that was propped against
the aviary wall. A chick could be heard hatching on 17th June. This exci-
ted the pair of Green-winged Macaws A. chloroptera housed in the next
aviary to such an extent that their screaming drove the Scarlet Macaws
from the nest. The eggs were placed in the incubator, and although two
chicks hatched, they could not be reared.
On 6th July, 20 days after leaving the clutch, the first egg of the second
clutch was laid. After an incubation of 27 to 28 days, two chicks were
hatched and reared.
Of great joy to us was the nesting activity of our Red-fronted Macaws
A. rubrogenys which were imported in 1974. Three eggs were laid on the
floor of the aviary in March 1984. One chick hatched on 29th April, and
although well cared for, it died at four days old. On 20th May, 16 days
after the death of the chick, the hen laid again, this time in a nest-box. On
13th June, a few days before the eggs were due to hatch, all the eggs had
been expelled from the nest. All three eggs contained well-developed em-
bryos. On close inspection it was discovered that the macaws had gnawed a
hole through the 50 mm thick bottom of the nest-box. The box was
repaired and the first egg of the third clutch was laid 17 days later on
30th June. On 27th July, after an incubation of 27 days, a chick could
be heard in the box. A total of two chicks were hatched and reared.
Although our breeding record with swans, geese, ducks, flamingoes and
owls has been highly successful, I would like to devote the rest of this
article to our birds of prey breeding programme. This has been rather
long term due to the slow maturing of the birds.
In our large flight cage for birds of prey, which is 1200 m 2 (Dathe,
1967), we house principally vultures and Tawny Eagles Aquila nipalensis.
For breeding purposes, pairs should be housed in individual aviaries. The
majority of the breeding aviaries have a surface of 28 m 2 , but a few are

The Long-legged Buzzards Buteo rufinus bred for the first time in
1970 (Grummt, 1973c). By 1984 a total of 22 young had been reared
among which were the first of the second generation. Tawny Eagles first
began breeding in the large flight cage in 1972 and to date have reared 12
young. Young birds bred at Tierpark Berlin and sent to a small zoo in
the German Democratic Republic are now breeding in the second genera-
tion. The first Bald Eagle Haliaeetus leucocephalus was hatched in 1975.
Since the parents would not care for it, it was fostered out to the Long-
legged Buzzards who reared it without problems. Starting in 1976 the
Bald Eagles have cared for their young and to date have reared 16. It is
worth noting that on three occasions, in 1979, 1983 and 1984, three
chicks have been reared from each clutch.
Golden Eagles Aquila chrysaetos have bred successfully since 1980
with a total of 11 reared. The number of chicks per nest has varied. On
four occasions two young were reared and on one occasion, three chicks.
In the case of the Wedge-tailed Eagles Aquila audax it was a long time
before the birds nested successfully. We received the birds in 1957 direct
from Australia; they were almost fledged when removed from their nest
at the end of 1956. The female laid for the first time in 1969 at 13 years
old. The first young hatched in 1981 and by 1984, five had been reared.
The first Black Vulture Aegupius monachus was reared in 1980. This
bird was parent-reared and as far as we know this was the first time this
species had been bred successfully in captivity.
After many failures we were able to artificially rear a Secretary Bird
Sagittarius serpentarius in 1983.
In 1965 we acquired two Striated Caracaras Phalcoboenas australis ,
which proved to be a pair. After a number of infertile clutches, a chick
was hatched in 1983 which was hand-reared. In 1984 the Striated Cara-
caras have cared for their young and have reared two.
The greatest success at Tierpark Berlin with birds of prey has, without
any doubt, been the breeding of the Harpy Eagle Harpia harpyja. In 1972
and 1973 we imported two young Harpy Eagles direct from South
America. Both of these birds proved to be females as each laid eggs in
1979. In April 1981 we were able to obtain a male on breeding loan from
Adlerwarte Berlebeck in the Federal Republic of Germany. After care-
fully introducing the pair, it did not take long before the birds went to
nest. A young Harpy Eagle hatched on 4th September 1981 after an incu-
bation period of 56 days. The chick was reared by the parents without
difficulty. On 4th November 1982 and 18th January 1984 two more
chicks were hatched which were again reared by the adults. Observations
on the rearing-of the young provided a great deal of new information on

date.
Despite the successes described above, I am in full agreement that a
great deal of effort must be given to the establishment of self-sustaining
populations of as many species as possible in order to perpetuate the
growing number of endangered forms.

TWO-WATTLED CASSOWARY BRED AT
TARONGA PARK ZOO, SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA
By ROSEMARY LOW

(Taunton , Somerset)
A notable hatching occurred at Taronga Park Zoo, Sydney, on 1st
November 1986. 'Clawed' weighed in at a massive 393 g and is the first
recorded Two-wattled Cassowary Casuarius casuarius to be hatched
since 1934 when Taronga first displayed these powerful flightless birds
(capable of disembowelling a man with a single kick).
The parents have been at Taronga since 1978. In September the female
laid four eggs which, as is usual in cassowaries, was incubated by the male.
Towards the end of the incubation period (as long as 55 days) he abandoned
the eggs. They were placed in an incubator but three failed to hatch.
At first 'Clawed' was kept in a brooder with a chicken for company
and fed on finely chopped, soft tropical fruits, sweet potato and tomato,
with added calcium and vitamins. On sunny days he was exercised out of
doors by the keepers and soon demonstrated incredible running ability.
The Two-wattled Cassowary is found in northern Queensland, being
one of the rainforest's shyest and wariest inhabitants. Ever alert to danger,
it keeps to the most dense areas of forest and uses its helmet to force
a path through thick vegetation. Remaining hidden during the day, it
emerges at night to feed on fruit, seeds and berries.
Two other species, the Single-wattled and Bennett's Cassowary, occur
in New Guinea. All three are threatened by habitat destruction and the
New Guinea species are hunted. Young ones are kept by the natives in
enclosures until they are large enough to be eaten.
'Clawed' will be recorded in the Australasian Cassowary Studbook.
Eventually he will be sent to another zoo in Australia as part of a care-
fully monitored breeding programme. Captive breeding may prove vital
for the survival of cassowaries although to date few successes have
occurred. In Britain the first - of Bennett's Cassowary - took place as long
ago as 1864 at London Zoo. The Double-wattled Cassowary was bred in
this country for the first time at Edinburgh Zoo in 1967 where the success
was repeated in 1968 and 1969. This species was also bred at San Diego
Zoo in 1957 and four young were hand-reared in 1977 at the Villars-les-

THE PROTEA CANARY
Serinus leucopterus
By NEVILLE BRICKELL
(Avicultural Research Unit, South Africa)
The Protea Canary Serinus leucopterus is also known as Layard's Seed-

eater, Dusky-faced Seedeater and White-winged Seedeater. Clancey (1963)
suggested that to call it by its popular name White-winged Seedeater,
which was coined by Sharpe, is misleading as the bird is not white-winged,
having no more than off-white or buffish white terminal spotting to the
medium and secondary coverts; the Protea Canary is most closely allied to
the Thick-billed Seedeater Serinus burtoni. The South African Red Data
Book lists it as protected by provincial laws but a survey of the species'
distributional and numerical status is required (Siegfried et al, 1976).
This is a rare species, usually found solitary, in pairs or in small flocks
of up to 10 birds. They are difficult to observe as they generally keep
within the confines of dense vegetation. Flight is fast and direct at no
great height. The call has been described as short phrases of mellow notes
interspersed with nasal, wheezy jeeer notes (Maclean, 1985). The sexes
are alike. Forehead, crown, nape and mantle sooty brown, centres to
feathers darker and tinged with olive; rump and upper tail coverts tinged
olive yellow; tail earth brown, the outer webs edged paler; ear coverts
blackish; chin and mid-forethroat white;breast and belly buff, tinged
olive, streaking on breast darker buff and centre of belly white; wing
coverts and flight feathers earth brown; axilliaries and under wing coverts
yellowish; iris brown; bill pinkish to whitish, the culmen-ridge and tip
darker; legs and feet blackish brown to greyish brown. Immatures have
not been described.
The Protea Canary frequents mature Protea fynbos on mountain
slopes, also penetrating stands of exotic pines and evergreen forest in some
parts of its range. Occurs in the Cape Province of South Africa from
Pakhuis Pass in the northern Cedarberg, south to Caledon and eastwards to
Cockscomb in the Grootwinterhoekberge. An extensive survey on feeding
was undertaken by Milewski (1978) which revealed that the Protea Canary
ate a wide variety of food items from 77 plant species and about five
invertebrate species; the diet consists mainly of the seeds of the Protea,
supplemented with soft plant parts (foliage, flowers, fruit and nectar) and
insects; food genera recorded in the diet of this species, namely Graminoid

Breeding takes place from August to October when a cup measuring 5,
3-5, 8 cm diameter and 3,5-4, 7 cm depth is constructed of dry plant
stems. Recorded are Kooigoed, an Afrikaans word for several scrambling
aromatic species of Helichrysum. Fine, wiry grass is used to hold the outer
shell together with fluff of Oleander-leaved Protea Protea neriifolia as a
lining. Nests are placed at 3-5 metres from the ground in the vertical fork
of a Protea bush or exotic pine. Two to four eggs are laid. The eggs are
ivory white to very pale blue, spotted and lined with brown, purple and
black, chiefly at the large end. Egg measurements average (6) 20,6 x 14, 6
(19-21, 7 x 14, 4-14, 9). Incubation period is recorded at 17 days with the
nestling period at least 14 days. The young are fed by both parents. I can
find no record of this species having been kept or bred in aviaries anywhere
in Africa, and no notes have previously been written about it in the Avicul-
tural Magazine.

In response to a hint from our fair editor that a little 'copy 9 for the
magazine might not come amiss, it occurred to me that the domestic
Canary Serinus canarius is one of the few species that I have kept which I
have not yet written about in our magazine. I propose here to rectify the
omission though I fear that those who read it may come to the conclusion
that &amp;apos;rectify 9 was a wrong word to use.
There will be nothing here of use to the Canary fancier. No advice on
how to breed bigger and more beetle-browed Norwich, longer and larger
Yorkshires or more distorted Scots Fancies, wherewith to obtain coveted
prizes. I propose merely to give an account of some of my experiences and
observations and throw in a question or two here and there in the hope
that some readers more knowledgeable on the point than I will be able to
answer them in a future issue. Inevitably any article dealing with the beha-
viour of this species must, to some extent, duplicate and overlap informa-
tion given in Nicolai&amp;apos;s detailed study of the behaviour of this and other
species in the genus Serinus. His work (see references) should be read in
full by anyone concerned seriously with the behaviour of the Canary and
its allies.
Canaries and I
Some readers may recall that the first birds I kept when a small child
were a pair of Bullfinches Pyrrhula pyrrhula (Goodwin, 1952 and 1985).
These were at first kept in a cage in the dining room but, for reasons that
I forget, were soon moved to my bedroom, perhaps marginally less suitable
a place. As I have narrated, this Bullfinch pair did actually regain their
freedom. Before doing so, however, they lived with me for about 18
months and in that time my stock was increased, first by a Goldfinch and
then by some Canaries. The Goldfinch I had seen and &amp;apos;fallen for' in the
pet department of a large London store. A very &amp;apos;posh' one too, that
charged 7 shillings and sixpence each for its Goldfinches, a third more than
the then average price of 5 shillings.
Someone had told my father, who then and for some years after, took
a rather fluctuating interest in my bird-keeping, that &amp;apos;Goldfinch Mules&amp;apos;
could be easily and plentifully bred just by putting a cock Goldfinch and
a hen Canary together and that such hybrids were of great monetary
value. Fired by these mistaken or mendacious statements, my father

bought a clear yellow (technically a 'buff in fanciers' terms) Norwich
Canary (the breed had not got so monstrous then, as it has since). Not
surprisingly, she and the Goldfinch regarded each other with indifference,
which changed to hostility when some mutually desired food or perching
place brought them close to each other. Both my father and I were disap-
pointed at this lack of reproductive impulses and soon the idea of Gold-
finch Mules was abandoned (perhaps my father had learnt of their true and
slight monetary value, in most cases, and of the difficulties of breeding
them) and a cock Norwich Canary was added to the collection. He was
what I believe is known as 'heavily variegated', that is, he had most of each
wing dark muddy brown and some of the same colour on his head, con-
trasting with his orange body. The orange and muddy brown hues were
due to colour feeding and he moulted out more or less the same lemony
yellow as the hen, already christened 'Sulphur' and with his dark areas
more or less of the olive grey tones found in the wild Canary.
A large box cage had been procured and fitted up with a nest-bowl.
The two Canaries wasted little time and soon, to my intense excitement,
Sulphur laid her first egg. My father had by now read up, and also read to
me, much of the then current wisdom about Canary keeping so the egg
was removed, placed on bran in a box, and a pot egg substituted for it.
Amazingly, considering the number of times I disobeyed my father and
covertly examined, handled and generally gloated over them, at least two
of the four eggs were not seriously damaged and in due course produced
two young, one much like his father and the other clear yellow ('buff)
like his mother.
When the next clutch of eggs was being incubated, we moved house,
from Surbiton to Virginia Water. I was much concerned about the Cana-
ries, in fact only concerned about them, and not the trauma which I
suppose my parents had over the move. Partly to pacify me, a car was
hired to take us and the Canaries to the new home and, which astonishes
me even now, Sulphur sat throughout the journey and did not desert
when the cage was set up in the new house. Perhaps as a result of the
journey only one young one was hatched and reared. It subsequently
proved to be a cock, had its entire back olive green with darker streaks
(much like a wild Canary's) and was called 'Greenback'.
Perhaps because none of them reacted socially to me, perhaps because I
subconsciously considered them as, in part, .my father's birds, my first
passionate involvement with the Norwich Canaries did not last. They, and
some Rollers that my father later got, bred for many years but tended to
do so less successfully as the years went on. Many were given away each
year, some escaped, some died (with hindsight I can see why!) and the sad
end result was that by 1937, barely 11 years after the stock had been star-

ted, there were no Canaries left.
Except for two hen Borders that I had for some months in 1958,1 did
not keep Canaries again until late in 1965 when I purchased some Red
Factors and bred from them, mainly because I was interested in one or
two aspects of Canary behaviour which I felt I ought to have remembered
from earlier days but to my irritation had not. Also, it had been stated in
at least one 'authoritative' work on bird behaviour that Canaries, and by
implication other cardueline finches, fed their young for the first few days
on crop milk comparable to that of pigeons. I felt sure that this was not
the case but had to admit, when I got embroiled in an argument over the
matter, that I had no proof. So I wanted to look again and more closely at
parental feeding in Canaries.
For the next ten years I always had some Canaries, all red factors,
usually two pairs, not the same two all the time, and often a few current
year's young ones. I gave away many young Canaries but to a large extent
was forced to curtail numbers by sterilising eggs before allowing the birds
to sit. I had chosen red factors partly for their attractive colours but even
more because most of them then were fairly near to the wild Canary in
general size and shape, certainly far more 'natural looking' than the (in
Britain) most popular fancy breeds.
Red factor Canaries and their colorations
As all who read this are likely to know, or at least, like myself, to have
been informed, red factor Canaries were produced by hybridisation with
the Red Siskin or Hooded Siskin Carduelis cucullatus. Back crossing
hybrids to Canaries and selective breeding enabled the 'red factor', that is
a gene or genes permitting the development of red pigment, to be trans-
ferred to what are now, in other respects, apparently pure Canaries. How-
ever, from what I have seen and the very little I have read on the matter,
it appears that although some red factor Canaries show delicate shades of
pale orange, pinkish yellow, ivory white and (when they have melanin
pigments also) rich reddish browns, orange browns, buffs and yellowish
green; red or orange-red colour can only be obtained by careful feeding,
prior to and during the moult, with foods containing red carotenoids and
lacking yellow carotenoids. The resultant reds tend too, to look very
'unnatural', not much like the lovely near-vermilion of the Red Siskin. I
bought at times two or three red factor Canaries that were a deep orange-
red or shrimp (boiled) red. All these birds, fed on abundant greenfood and
some eggfood besides seeds, moulted out pale orange yellow or pinkish
yellow.
Sexual differences and the (often great) differences of coloration be-
tween adults and young in red factor Canaries are sometimes attributed to

the Hooded Siskin ancestry and this may well be so. On the other hand, in
the wild Canary, and some other serins, the juvenile plumage is much paler
and browner than that of the adult. Also in the wild Canary the cock is
much brighter than the hen and less profusely marked on breast and flanks.
Of my young red factors that I kept to adulthood and made careful
notes on, a hen with wild Canary-type markings was basically a medium,
quite dull brown in juvenile plumage and moulted into a general orange
brown. Her face and breast became much brighter and more orange, presu-
mably through abrasive moult, in spring and summer. A hen, which in her
juvenile plumage was pale orange with a brown 'cap', moulted out a darker
orange with a still darker orange cap. A cock who was cinnamon brown
moulted out deep orange and a hen who was a clear, delicate ivory colour
in her first plumage, moulted out, rather to my disappointment, a pale
pinkish orange.
To what extent the many new and beautiful (if hardly red) colours
found in red factor Canaries are due to genes introduced via the Red Sis-
kin has always seemed to me 'unproven'. The original Norwich Canary had
a naturally rich golden yellow colour (Wallace, 1903); the much lamented
London Fancy was apparently golden with grizzled (in juvenile plumage
solidly dark) wings. These two types vanished without trace sometime in
the previous century but could their, or similar, genes have 're-surfaced' in
our present day red factors?
I will say no more on this topic, of which I know little, but appeal to
any reader with more knowledge of the subject to write an article giving us
information on it.
Nothing in the behaviour of my red factors suggested that they were
not in this aspect identical to 'pure' Canaries. On the other hand, I have
not kept Red Siskins so may have failed to recognise traits of this species.
Again, information from those with knowledge of the matter would be
welcome.
I did notice that my red factors were very unwilling to eat 'plain'
canary seed and left to their own choice ate, of seeds, mainly niger and
(when available) hemp, as well as large amounts of soft food and green
food. I think, however, that my own reluctance to force them on to a less
rich (and cheaper) diet, rather than Red Siskin genes, may have been
responsible for this. I was perhaps overconscious that the Canaries of my
boyhood had probably been, all unwittingly, kept on too meagre a diet.
General and feeding behaviour
Like most long-domesticated species, Canaries are usually very willing
to sample new foods. Such 'unnatural' foods as egg-food, milk sop and the
like, are always eaten eagerly, although some Canaries show little enthu-

siasm for some of the modern 'all purpose miracle' type ready made-up
rearing foods. Compared with other small seed-eating birds, Canaries usually
take, if given the chance, a lot more fruit and green vegetables. I can re-
member in my childhood giving such things as pineapple, and even straw-
berry jam to Sulphur and her mate. I did not give much in the way of fruit
to the red factors kept later but did establish that although they took
sweet eating apple eagerly (if cut across so they could get at the flesh
easily), sour cooking apples were invariably rejected after the first taste.
Like our Linnet, Goldfinch and Redpoll, the Canary regularly uses its
feet to hold greenfood, stems of seed heads and the like, down to a perch
while it feeds from them. In general Canaries seem uninterested in live
food. I did, however, have two hens for a time in a room with various
estrildids that became very fond of Blowfly pupae. I think they regarded
them in the light of 'soft-centred seeds'. Also one of my red factor cocks
ate Blowfly maggots readily and fed them to his nestlings.
Where birds of approximately equal age and condition are involved,
cock Canaries are normally dominant over hens, except during the breed-
ing period. When or before serious nest-building starts, the hen becomes
dominant over the cock. This presumably functions to give her 'a free
hand' at and around the nest without risk of interference from the cock.
The changeover period can, at least under domestic conditions, be fraught
with tension and flare-ups of aggression. Nicolai says, no doubt correctly,
that any appreciable lessening of the cock's reproductive impulses may
cause a cessation of his submissive attitude to his mate and he may then
attack her if she threatens him or if she solicits him too importunately.
Dominance reversal between the mates also gives the hen confidence to
assert herself over other cock Canaries, should she be pestered by them.
This dominance of the hen during the breeding period occurs in some
(possibly all) other cardueline finches also and may sometimes give the
hen confidence to assert herself over birds she would normally flee from.
I saw a nice example of this (I hope readers will forgive the digression) in
mid-April of 1982. This was a 'Siskin winter' in the Petts Wood area and
many Siskins Carduelis spinus had been coming for peanuts since February.
They were, however, only able to feed at a hanging peanut bag in heavy rain
or when somebody was standing close to it. At other times the peanut bags
were taken over completely by House Sparrows Passer domesticus and,
when these took shelter in moderate rain or because a human came too
near, by Great and Blue Tits Parras major and caeruleus. The latter showed
'vindictive' aggression towards the weaker Siskins as they do towards Coal
Tits P. ater. On this occasion I was standing within a couple of feet of the
peanut bag in order to allow a fine cock Siskin to feed from it. A hen

shortly appeared, he casually made threatening movements towards her
but she, who had evidently just developed the 'change of heart' in refer-
ence to feminine status, turned on him furiously, chased him off and re-
turned to the peanut bag. After she had fed a little, I moved away and in-
stantly a Blue Tit flew at the Siskin to drive her off. She, as if out of habit,
flew to a bough about 10 ft away but when the Blue Tit, instead of feed-
ing, flew at her again to drive her further away, she seemed to 'remember*
her new status., turned and fought back and finally chased off the Blue
Tit! Unfortunately for both, I then went indoors and the House Sparrows
moved back to the peanuts.
Reproductive behaviour
If a pair of Canaries are put together well ahead of their (subsequent)
nesting time or if the cock is put with the hen before she has selected a
nest-site, then it will be seen that the cock takes the initiative in nest-
site selection. He searches for suitable places, and having found one, turns
around in it, usually making movements similar to those of the hen when
'shaping' her nest. Sometimes he mandibulates potential nesting material
and carries it to the site he has selected but he does not, in my experience,
ever perform actual nest-budding with it.
All nest-building is done by the hen, once she has selected the nest-
site or, as it is more usually the case, 'approved of the site that her mate
has selected. Normally the nest is placed in some bowl, basket, or topless
or half frontless box supplied by the birdkeeper but if the aviary has
suitable bushes or shrubs and an abundance of suitably fresh, tough and
not too dry material, Canaries are usually quite capable of budding more
or less Greenfinch-like nests for themselves.
The eggs, usually three to five, and pale greenish blue with purplish
flecks and dots, are laid in the morning at dady intervals. Most domestic
Canary hens seem to incubate from the first day. The cock does not
normally incubate or brood young but he feeds the hen both on and off
the nest. Like the Goldfinch, the hen Canary is in no way inhibited from
noisiness at the nest-site. Even when incubating or brooding nestlings she
not only begs (or would feminists prefer the word 'demands'?) food loudly
when her mate comes to the nest but she also cads out loudly and often
when she hears him nearby. I, and I imagine many of our readers, have
often discovered Goldfinches' nests through this calling of the sitting hen
but, presumably, no common natural nest predator of this species or the
wdd Canary can use its ears to find nests, else natural selection would long
ago have forced the females of these species to be quieter than they are.
I paid detailed attention to parental feeding in my red factor Canaries
and confirmed what I had assumed from my boyhood observations, and

<bodyText confidence="0.99894443902439" page_id="56954020"  page_num="206" year="" vol="">
is implicit in most non-ornithological writings on the subject, that the Can-
ary does not produce crop milk or any substance analagous to it. It is, of
course, possible that saliva or similar liquid may (and probably does) mix
with the food fed to the young and this may contain some enzymes, trace
elements or whatever. My Canaries did not seem to discriminate between
animal and vegetable foods or to select foods of high protein content for
the young; so long as the food was palatable and soft it was fed readily
even to small nestlings. No doubt, under wild conditions, this would result
in the young being fed at first only with suitable foods, probably mainly
or entirely seeds still at or only a little beyond the 'milky' stage.
Both sexes feed the young but only the hen broods them. It is probable
that under natural conditions most of the food that she gives them for
the first week or so has been given her by the cock, although when the
birds are in a cage where the hen can see from the nest that some new and
much-liked food has been put in, she will come off to take food for
herself and her young more often than she would otherwise do. The
young are fed from the crop, the parent, as in other cardueline finches,
bringing up mouthful after mouthful and feeding each separately to a
young one. If not yet moulting, the hen usually starts a second nest (if
given the chance) before or very soon after the young fledge. She usually
ceases to feed the young as soon as, or shortly before she begins to lay
the second clutch and her mate is left with sole 'responsibility' for them.
In my boyhood days my father and I had some trouble with hen Canaries
plucking the body feathers from their young but, misled by the 'advice'
then published on such matters, did not draw the correct conclusions. I
now have no doubt that in most, probably all, such cases the root cause
is an insufficient diet, probably deficiency of salt and/or protein being
the major factor. Feather plucking in parrots is now known to be caused
by lack of salt in the diet.
Young Canaries, when begging, flutter their wings but at the moment
of actual contact, when the feeding parent inserts food into the young
bird's mouth the latter's fluttering wings instantly 'collapse' and fold
against its body, only to flutter again the moment physical contact be-
tween parent and young is broken.
Note on calls and song
Nicolai has dealt very fully with the vocalisations of the Canary and
other Serinus species and those of my readers who keep Canaries are likely
to be familiar with their calls so here I will touch on only one or two
points of interest.
The sweet or tsoo-eet that some naive keepers fondly think is the bird
answering their endearments in kind when they peer into its cage, is in

fact a note of alarm or anxiety. Most of our British finches have homo-
logous and very similar sounding alarm calls, that of the Greenfinch
Carduelis chloris being almost identical to the Canary's in sound, at least
to my ears.
I twice heard this sweet call given in a very harsh and emphatic manner
by a cock Canary (whose mate was sitting) when he saw, from the win-
dow, a tabby cat in the garden below. Neither he nor any of my other
Canaries showed any alarm at, or more than slight and superficial interest
in a stuffed Burrowing Owl Speotyto cunicularia (a species very like the
Eurasian Little Ow\ Athene noctud) which I showed them.
Everyone who has taken any interest at all in Canaries or read a little
about them knows that the Roller Canaries, which seem originally to have
been produced in the Hartz Mountain regions of Germany, have a much
softer and sweeter song than other breeds. Nicolai states that this has been
brought about not only by selection for the best singers but by the biologi-
cally bad conditions in which Roller Canaries are usually kept - in small,
dimly-lit cages; fed mainly on rape seed; inbred, etc. He states that this
causes those - to human ears harsher and less pleasant - parts of the
normal song which are particularly uttered by strong and fit cock Canaries,
to be suppressed in favour of the softer parts of the song. He says that if
Roller Canaries are kept for a few generations under good conditions, the
sweet soft song is transmuted into the louder, harsher song of an ordinary
Canary.
This is another aspect on which some of our readers may be able to give
opinions based on personal experience and I hope that they will do so. I
found the songs of my red factor Canaries, which appeared to have derived
from Rollers on the Canary side, to be quite harsh and loud. Indeed not at
all pleasant to my ears in the confines of a room.

Introduction
These notes relate to a group of unusually tame Wood Pigeons Columba
palumbus in St. James's Park, London, and describe how the colony arose,
the remarkable degree of tameness, and comment on related matters such
as recognition and memory.
Prior to the re-emergence of the Wood Pigeon as a hand-tame bird
there, I had been visiting St. James's Park regularly for two or three years,
as I was then taking a particular interest in wildfowl, and the fine collec-
tions there and at Regent's Park were a means of learning more about
them. In general, the closer the bird the more interesting, and if you feed
them they come closer still. One cannot, however, feed the pinioned birds
without feeding the wild ones as well, even if one wished to, for the latter,
like park birds everywhere, are adept at snatching food intended for others,
and I quickly settled down to feeding a fairly wide range of species. This
may be relevant to the ease with which personal relationships were later
established with certain wild birds, for, as discussed later, some birds can
readily recognise a particular human being, so that by the time the Wood
Pigeon story began I may already have become a familiar, and apparently
harmless, dispenser of food.
Development of the colony
By the bridge across the lake in St. James's Park, House Sparrows
Passer domesticus fly down readily onto the hands of those who feed
them. Similar groups of hand-tame birds of various species exist through-
out the world, but details of the birds' behaviour during the formation of
such groups is not usually recorded. Clearly each group must start with
one bird, more reckless than the rest, being coaxed onto someone's hand;
then others, enticed by the food and reassured by the first bird remaining
unharmed, follow its example.
The time between the first hesitant step of one bird and the creation of
a group for which this has become a regular method of obtaining food will
vary with the species, and the intensity with which the new behaviour is
deliberately encouraged. The behaviour will vary also for different species,
and according to the particular circumstances. Thus, in the case of the
Wood Pigeons a notable (and personally gratifying!) feature was that in the
early stages they could not be persuaded to fly to anyone but me, whereas

Wood Pigeon seemingly interested in the 'Crop Storage' issue of Farmers Weekly
Starlings Stumus vulgaris , that have been taught to stand on the hand to
feed, will from the outset go to other people using the same feeding tech-
nique.
Most birds in town parks are much tamer than their conspeciflcs in the
country, and the London Wood Pigeons are no exception. That they flew
onto the hand in Regent's Park in the 1920s is recorded by Grey (1927),
and from 1934, perhaps earlier, until the war started in 1939, there were
many Wood Pigeons in St. James's Park that would perch upon one's
hand, shoulder or head for food. These very tame birds were probably
killed off as pests as part of the Government's campaign to exterminate
the Wood Pigeon (Goodwin 1978).
During February and March 1982, two Wood Pigeons came to me at a
particular seat when I visited the park each weekend, and would take

biscuit from my outstretched hand. Later they would perch on my hand,
and one of them would let me run my fingers down its breast, stroke its
neck and, to a lesser extent, the top and back of its head, but would not
allow me to touch its wings. This behaviour was unusual, as at that time
Wood Pigeons in St. James's Park, though they would approach people
quite closely, were not tame. In March these two birds were joined by a
male with all the toes missing from the left foot, and which was promptly
named Stumpy. The naming of wild creatures as though they are pets
may seem to some unnecessarily sentimental, but it is easier to use names
in one's notes than to describe the distinguishing features each time.
Similarly if I speak to them, it is because I believe they may respond, like
horses, to a quiet tone of voice, and not because I expect a reply - not
even in pidgin English as someone once suggested. Anyway, during April
and May neither Stumpy nor his unnamed companions appeared for their
biscuits and I thought the episode closed.
In early June three birds, one of them Stumpy, again came to me on
the seat for food, readily flew onto my hand, and could be stroked. I was
now visiting the park daily, and events moved rapidly. Within a few days
it was clear that the birds, (a) had no difficulty recognising me, (b) were

prepared to fly onto my hand, but to no one else, and (c) would allow me
to handle them to a remarkable degree, extending or imprisoning their
wings, etc., in a way that even the feral pigeons Columba livid, var. would
not tolerate.
The number quickly doubled, and later reached a peak for that year
of about 10 birds, including two juveniles. When I entered the park and
neared the section occupied by the tame birds, they would fly from the
grass or from a tree up to 60 m away, landing confidently on my hand.
Although one or two of the people who regularly fed the birds in the park
tried hard to persuade these Wood Pigeons to fly to them, it was two and
a half months after their reappearance in June before they flew to anyone
else. However, in late August some started to do so, although in 1982 they
remained selective and would not fly to strangers.
That first summer I fed them daily, but could not continue to do so
indefinitely, and was concerned about stopping their regular meals, which
they had now come to expect. Fortunately the birds solved the problem
for me, as when that year's abundant crop of mast ripened on the copper
beeches they were no longer interested in the digestive biscuit or pigeon
mixture that they had taken so eagerly before. In any case, most London
Wood Pigeons leave their nesting territories in early autumn, and return to
them between the end of October and March; and tame individuals with an
assured food supply leave with the rest (Goodwin, 1978). The presence,
and absence, of a few ringed, and therefore individually recognisable birds
in St. James's Park was monitored for four years. Most of those birds, but
not all, left in the autumn, and all those that did so left in the second half
of September, or in October, and returned between late December and the
first week of April. However, birds with late broods are sometimes to be
seen feeding unfledged young in the first half of November, and some,
perhaps 10/15% of the number present in summer, were to be seen
throughout the autumn and winter.
The birds that leave the park in autumn do not apparently go far, but
probably move to a communal night-time roost, from which they disperse
daily to feeding places in or on the outskirts of Greater London; very
likely joining the large numbers feeding on beechnuts and acorns in such
places as Hampstead Heath and Richmond Park (Goodwin, 1978). That
some at least remain within easy range of the park was evidenced by the
temporary reappearance of two ringed birds, both males, during their
period of absence. One of them, 'absent' from 18th September 1983 until
7th April 1984, was present daily from 26th November to 11th December,
and was also seen on two isolated dates, on 24th December and 28th
January. The other, 'absent' from 12th October to 22nd December 1984,
was seen on three dates, 24th November, and 1st and 8th December.

There is also often a marked difference in the size of the meals taken
from the hand in winter. In summer, they will gorge themselves to capacity,
as will those birds that overwinter in the park, whereas those that leave in
autumn and return, say, at the turn of the year sometimes come briefly to
the hand and fly off after eating only a small amount. It seems that these
birds have a good supply of natural food elsewhere and, with the approach
of the breeding season, are making short visits to their territories, as des-
cribed by Murton, (1965).
Since that first summer I have made a point of feeding the Wood
Pigeons irregularly. Although it is usually recommended that food be put
out for garden birds regularly at bird tables, etc., regularity in the case of
hand-tame wild birds is, in my opinion, best avoided. To consistently pro-
vide a particular bird with daily meals may seem at first thought to be
solely beneficial, but it may cause too drastic a change in the bird's beha-
viour, turning it into a pet rather than a truly wild creature. If it believes
it can depend upon a meal at a particular time it is unlikely to seek its
natural food to the usual extent, and may become overfat and/or inactive,
especially if fed with food that is deficient in some way. Also, regular
feeding of a wild bird, perhaps several miles from one's home, cannot
always be maintained or carried out punctually, and the bird itself may
misjudge the time. Clearly any breakdown in a regular arrangement can
cause the bird distress. The occasional nourishing meal at odd times,
however, is beneficial without unduly affecting the bird's normal way of
life, and can be regarded as a bonus. This arrangement is also flexible; the
birds can be fed frequently when necessary, for example, in hard weather,
and special attention can be given to the needs of any bird that is sick,
injured or undernourished.
The tame birds remained tame and flew unhesitatingly to me on their
return in 1983. Others followed their example, and that summer 20 Wood
Pigeons were flying to the hand for food; fortunately not all at once,
though they can sometimes be rather overwhelming when I first arrive.
Incidentally, when counting the birds that fly to the hand, it is essential
to mark them as you count, otherwise you will include more than once
the birds that return for further helpings of food. Lipstick, being easily
applied, easily removed and non-toxic, is ideal for this purpose. Since
the dabbing of Wood Pigeons with lipstick seems to be regarded by any
onlookers as eccentric behaviour, however, these censuses have been in-
frequent.
The situation still existing at the time of writing (September 1986)
was established in that second year, although the number of hand-tame
birds has now settled down at around 30. The birds no longer discrimina-
ted to the same extent between strangers and those they knew and con-

sidered trustworthy, but there was, and still is, individual variation, some
birds going readily to strangers, others only after much coaxing, and some
not at all
Since they usually return to the same place in the park each year, the
tame birds have remained for the most part a localised colony, but there
are two or three in other parts of the park that now fly to the hand. These
perhaps were tamed originally in the main colony, possibly as juveniles,
and have chosen or been obliged to move elsewhere, but If you feed birds
year in and year out in a particular place, you will become a familiar figure
to many of them, and some may decide you are relatively harmless, and
become trusting without any premeditated effort on your part.
Degree of tameness
The trustfulness of Wood Pigeons that have become hand tame is quite
astonishing, particularly as this species is shot so extensively in other parts
of the country that it is usually extremely wary. Their tameness on the
hand (Gosling, 1985) far surpasses that of the feral pigeon, so that in com-
parison the feral pigeons in the park, and nearby Trafalgar Square, so well
known for their tameness, are noticeably 'jumpy 5 . The Wood Pigeon is
much more at ease. When it alights on the hand it will stand erect, waiting
patiently to be fed, and will let you stroke its beautiful pink breast. Any-
one doubting the loveliness of the Wood Pigeon should see It in this
upright pose, standing motionless with head held high and alert gaze. In
return for the food one can take surprising liberties with them: extend the
wings, fan the tail, examine the wing pits, and carry them about the park,
or out of the park. Stranger still, they will allow a cupped hand to be run
firmly down their back from head to tail, and they can be gripped quite
firmly over the closed wings, so that they are, in effect, imprisoned; also
one can encircle the throat with thumb and index finger, grasping them
quite tightly, yet they remain unperturbed by such handling. Such is their
trust that although physically aware of what is happening, they do not
feel imprisoned, any more than we feel imprisoned in a train or coach with
doors operated by the driver. If the 'doors', or in this case the hand, fail
to open when they wish to leave that Is a different matter, for they will
not willingly be held captive; yet those that have been held against their
will for some necessary purpose will usually return to the hand an hour
or so later.
In contrast the feral pigeon Is more nervous, and if you wish to place
your hand on it, it is usually necessary to do so when it is absorbed in
eating, as they tend to shy away when touched, readily flying off at a
touch or movement a 'Woodie 5 would ignore, though returning a moment
later. It is a matter of temperament, and long acquaintanceship makes

little difference, so that a Wood Pigeon fed half-a-dozen times will still
be more relaxed than a feral pigeon fed frequently for two or three years.
It has been suggested to me by Eric Gillham, who has been associated
with the birds of St. James's Park for many years, that the relative indif-
ferance of the tame Wood Pigeons to being 'manhandled' may be in part
linked to the manner in which they take from trees food that they cannot
easily reach, namely by hanging, often upside down, with wings spread
out among the branches for support. This I think is likely, for the Wood
Pigeon is a robust bird, with powerful wings, as illustrated by the well-
known 'wing-clap' used as a finale to its display flight and when disturbed.
I sometimes feed them on a weeping copper beech, or weeping willow, and
they will 'crash' noisily into the pendant branches, displaying in their
eagerness to reach the food offered to them an acrobatic skill quite out of
keeping with their portly appearance on the ground. Yet, notwithstanding
their rough and tumble antics at times, and the aggressiveness that forms a
necessary part of all birds' lives, they have a placid temperament, with a
gentle and endearing 'dove-like' quality much in evidence.
Any study of separately recognisable birds highlights how individual-
istic they are. In the few, but widely different species that I have observed
at close quarters it has always quickly become clear that the birds have
minds of their own. It is not surprising, therefore, that the tame birds have
their separate personalities and behave in different ways, nor that some
Wood Pigeons can never be persuaded to fly to the hand, however often
they see their conspecifics feeding there unharmed. Their sex is undoubt-
edly relevant to their character, but in the degree of tameness and willing-
ness to be tamed, I have noticed no difference between male and female.
Recognition and memory
It was found that Wood Pigeons can readily identify a particular person
even in a crowded park, and their ability to do so can be impressive when
they swoop down from a tree or fly across the grass to land unhesitatingly
on the hand.
Experiments showed that they recognise by sight the person , and not
what is worn or carried, presumably, as we do, by the features, aided by
other factors such as expression, stance and walk, which together make an
identifiable whole. Grey (1927) records how a pair of Swallows Hirundo
rustica recognised and attacked him when wearing the knickerbocker suit
he wore when they found him examining their nest, though not if he was
wearing a suit of similar colour but with trousers; and he found that his
tame Robins Erithacus rubecula would not go to him if he wore dark
clothing. The Wood Pigeons, I am pleased to say, do not seem to mind
what I wear. Recognition is not dependent upon what is worn or carried,

or the time of day, or the direction from which their area is approached.
A complete and simultaneous change of all these factors made no apparent
difference, and the birds undoubtedly recognise the person, though no
doubt if seen in unfamiliar clothing or unexpected circumstances they may
do so less swiftly. Howard (1952) found that her tame Blue Tits Pams
caemlem and Great Tits Pams major recognised her whatever she was
wearing, and that they also knew her voice. I do not know whether or
not the Wood Pigeons know my voice, but recognition was purely visual
during my experiments as I did not call or speak to them. That unfamiliar
clothing can cause alarm is well illustrated by an experience of Derek
Goodwin's (pers. comm.). Two young, very tame captive Wood Pigeons
that had always seen him in an open neck shirt, and flown onto him,
letting him handle them, went into a wild panic, fleeing from him and
battering the wire when he entered their aviary wearing a tie. When he
returned without a tie, they behaved with their customary tameness.
So far as recognising human beings is concerned, there is perhaps a
tendency to under-rate a wild bird's capabilities. Such commonly heard
remarks as 'feed the birds regularly and they will get to know you' give
the impression that they are slow learners, that recognition is a gradual
process requiring several encounters, preferably at a set time and place.
This is not necessarily the case, and a strong association of ideas can
override the need for repetition, so that recognition can be immediate.
Feed a Wood Pigeon, or feral pigeon, well one day and you will often
find it recognises you straight away the next. I imagine it is much as it
is with us; we do not, cannot, take note of everyone, but are selective,
remembering those who give us cause to do so, even though we have
seen them only once before.
It was found that other species, too, may be good at recognising
people, and a female Mallard Anas platyrhynchos would fly from the
lake and follow me across the grass, not because there was any food in
evidence but because she knew from past experience that it would be
produced, and she would be given a good feed of com and biscuit. In
many cases the bird has the advantage. A Carrion Crow Corvus corone ,
for example, would fly across the park, land buoyantly three or four
metres away, shout for food, and when it was produced walk up jauntily,
but warily, to take it from my fingers. As it did not do this with anyone
else it clearly knew me, yet apart from this unusual tameness, I could find
no feature that would enable me to distinguish it from the other eight or
nine Crows frequenting the park at that time.
Care is, of course, needed before concluding that a bird recognises
you. The fact that a bird hurries straight to you with every sign of recog-
nition does not mean necessarily that it knows you, as it may well do the

<bodyText confidence="0.997869219512195" page_id="56954030"  page_num="216" year="" vol="">
same to complete strangers. Many park birds rush eagerly to anyone they
think may have food, and are quick to note the slightest hint of a possible
'handout'. Consequently, proof of recognition is not always readily forth-
coming, and though I have fed certain Black-headed Gulls Lams ridi-
bundus for several years now, I still only 'think' they recognise me.
Lack (1965) refers to instances of Robins remembering a person
after an absence of six months, and cites the case of a Song Sparrow (Ru-
fous-collared Sparrow) Zonotrichia capensis that remembered an event
after 18 months (Nice, 1943). The Wood Pigeon's memory also seems to
be long lasting. Bearing in mind that when they return from an autumn/
winter absence, their memory would be 'jogged' by the sight of another
Wood Pigeon feeding from my hand, I have, nevertheless, had instances
indicating that they still recollect me on their return without being re-
minded. In one case, the first bird to fly to me as I entered the park was a
ringed, identifiable bird that I had not seen for four months, and there
was a similar occasion following an absence of just under three months.
Also, one afternoon in February when there were no other Wood Pigeons
near me, an identifiable bird, Stumpy, that had been absent for four
months, flew in from outside the park and straight towards me, landing
about three metres away,from where it hobbled up to feed from my hand.
Experiments with the closely related feral pigeon showed that they too
can often remember a person after only one encounter, and that once you
are firmly fixed in their memory they will remember you after an absence
of four months. Quite likely they can do so after a much longer period,
but I have no evidence as to this. Since the birds are subject to much the
same deficiencies that affect our memory and eyesight, it is not surprising
that much individual variation was noticeable - some birds obviously
recognise you as soon as they see you, while others are never able to do so,
and will peer at you doubtfully as you approach, even though you have
been feeding them on and off for years.
The relationship
'Make friends with the birds' urged a leaflet published by the Royal
Society for the Protection of Birds, and it catalogued nest-boxes, bird
feeders, etc. But can you? Clearly the exhortation was not meant to be
taken too literally, for you can give the birds every comfort - food, good
homes, drinking water and washing facilities, yet they remain suspicious
or indifferent. Wild birds that become tame may have different attitudes
to this risky behaviour, but one fact is indisputable - they come for the
food. Whether they come for any other reason is less easily answered, but
Leonora Howard (1952, 1956), who had a uniquely close relationship
with many wild birds, sharing her cottage with them as well as her garden,

records many instances of the birds going to her for help when they were
in trouble.
Leaving aside birds reacting socially to man because of 'imprinting' and
the unusual relationships arising sometimes from captivity, I do not believe
that a mutual friendship can exist between a truly wild bird and a human
being. Certainly a bird is not friendly because it feeds from your hand; in
most cases it merely takes the food and then clears off. It is not interested
in companionship, or in one's state of health, nor does one's generosity
prompt it to reciprocate - which is just as well, for I have no wish to have
avian delicacies deposited In my mouth. One can only befriend a bird, but
that to me is sufficient, for their mere presence is a delight. Indeed anyone
foolish enough to look for some sort of affection treads dangerous
ground, for the most likely emotion they will encounter is the bird's anger
or disappointment If offered pigeon mixture when it is hoping for peanuts!
Nevertheless, it would be unwise to conclude that tame birds always
regard their human associate solely as a food dispenser. A close and
trusting relationship can undoubtedly be created between a person and a
bird, of importance to the bird (albeit as a source of food), and of several
years' duration. Since one cannot enter a bird's mind, who can say
definitely that this long-standing and valuable association does not develop
in the bird some sort of feeling for the person who feeds it? Where trust is
created the relationship may well reflect more than mere 'cupboard love'
on the part of the bird, and it may respond to the person's behaviour; thus
Wood Pigeons agitated by the presence of a dog, for example, and about to
fly from the hand, often appear to be reassured by stroking and a quiet
tone of voice to which they have become accustomed, much as one
soothes a domestic animal (Gosling, 1985). Goodwin (1982) relates how
Wood and feral pigeons noted that his presence in the garden protected
them from cats. After being frightened by one, they would not, for a
time, come down into his garden for food if he was not present, but if
he went out and stood near the food they would at once do so, and would
feed near him, only to fly up again as soon as he went indoors.
There have been two examples of Wood Pigeons staying on my hand
other than for food. In one the bird remained there for 20 minutes after
it had finished eating, leaving the remaining food on my hand untouched,
while I stood talking to a companion. It was a warm, sunny evening,
drawing to its close, and I concluded that, like us, birds get tired at the
end of the day, and as it was at ease on my hand it was merely using it as a
convenient resting place before going to roost.
The other example concerns a male 'Woodie' found hanging from a
tree by nylon line caught around its leg, which was rescued by two friends
of mine; a somewhat hazardous operation, as to cut it free entailed one of

them crawling along a branch 10 m up. Two years later, though the bird is
permanently crippled, I am glad to say that it is still alive, and as far as I
can tell, reasonably healthy apart from its injured leg. However, its beha-
viour on the hand since that time is in marked contrast to the others, as
it will often remain on the hand for a few minutes after it has finished
eating, and before flying off to its territory on Duck Island. This interval
may well be just a matter of convenience, but its expression as it looks
steadily into my eyes differs from the equally steady gaze of the other
tame Wood Pigeons. It may well be that, following Its injuries, it has had
to live with pain, and that this is reflected in its expression but it seems
to be trying to communicate, or to interpret my own expression, as
though it is seeking sympathy or hoping for help - as is sometimes seen in
the expressions of sick domestic pets. I am fully alive to the pitfalls of
attributing human emotions to animals, yet the feeling is very strong that
this bird's attitude to me, and human beings generally, for it was not I
who rescued it, differs slightly from that of the other tame birds, and I
believe that to omit this observation because it may seem more senti-
mental than scientific would leave this section incomplete.
Having touched on the birds' feelings, or lack of feelings, what of the
person who has tamed them? Where does he stand in the relationship he
has created? I assume that he, or she, will feel much as I do, not only an
affection for the birds but also, having intervened in their lives, a measure
of responsibility for their welfare. If care is taken the additional risk to
which a tame bird may be exposed should be slight, especially when
compared with the many hazards to which all wild birds are subject.
However, the taming of wild birds is only excusable if one is satisfied
that, taking a broad view, the advantages to the birds well outweigh
any additional risks they may run. Fortunately if common sense is exer-
cised, this should be the case, as much help can be given to tame birds
if they are sick, injured or merely undernourished, and I know of several
birds that, but for their tameness, would not be alive and healthy as I
write.
Finally, I should be pleased to hear from any reader interested in
tame wild birds, and to learn of their experiences and views, whether or
not they agree with what has been said here.

WALTER GOODFELLOW - ONE OF THE GREAT
ORNITHOLOGICAL COLLECTORS
BY ALAN GIBBARD

(Reigate, Surrey)
In the days before air travel had reduced a distance of several thousand
miles to a few hours' flying time, the aviculturist depended on the efforts
of a small band of men to collect, and successfully bring back on long sea
voyages the rare birds that graced his aviaries. This small group of pro-
fessional collectors included Wilfrid Frost, Cecil S. Webb, F. Shaw Mayer,
and probably the most successful of all, Walter Goodfellow.
Walter Goodfellow was born in 1866 and started his career as an orni-
thological collector with an expedition to Colombia and Ecuador in 1898.
This expedition was largely aimed at collecting museum specimens of
which Goodfellow obtained 4,000 skins of over 500 species of birds.
By the turn of the century, Goodfellow was collecting on behalf of
a number of wealthy aviculturists who desired to add rare and beautiful
species to their collections.
One of Goodfellow's early patrons was Mrs. E. Johnstone who main-
tained a large collection of birds at Groombridge in Kent. In 1903, while
collecting on Mount Apo on the Philippine island of Mindanao, Good-
fellow obtained a species of lorikeet new to science. This was named
Trichoglossus johnstoniae, Johnstone's Lorikeet, in honour of Mrs. John-
stone. Two years later, Goodfellow was able to return to England with
three living examples of the new lorikeet for Mrs. Johnstone's aviaries.
Goodfellow wrote some notes about this lorikeet in the Avicultural
Magazine (January, 1906: 83-88) which were illustrated by a superb
colour plate by H. Gronvold. In the following year, Mrs. Johnson des-
cribed their successful breeding in her aviaries (1907: 44-46).
While collecting in Taiwan in 1906, Goodfellow noticed, in the head-
dress of a native, the tail feathers of a previously undescribed species of
pheasant. Goodfellow managed to obtain these feathers, and from them
the Mikado Pheasant Syrmaticus mikado was made known to science. In
1912 Goodfellow returned to Taiwan and collected 11 living Mikado
Pheasants. These birds were obtained by Mrs. Johnstone and the following
year she bred them for the first time in captivity ( Avicultural Magazine ,
1915: 265-266, including colour plate by H. Goodchild).
Another great aviculturist for whom Walter Goodfellow obtained
rare birds was E.J. Brook who kept a splendid collection of living birds
at his home, Hoddam Castle, Dumfries. In 1909 Goodfellow brought

home for Brook a superb collection of birds from New Guinea. This
collection included Greater, Magnificent, Blue, Princess Stephanie's,
Meyer's Sickle-billed and Superb Birds of Paradise, as well as Gardener
Bowerbirds and Wilhelmina's, Stella's and Fairy Lorikeets. To transport
such a collection on a long sea voyage at the turn of the century required
much care and skill.
Due to his great experience as a collector in the tropics, Goodfellow
was invited to lead the British Ornithologists' Union expedition to Dutch
New Guinea. The purpose of the expedition was to obtain skins for the
British Museum, and over 300 different species were collected, 25 of
which were new to science. Large collections were also made of mammals,
insects and plant life. Before the expedition was completed Goodfellow
was taken ill and had to return home. Another member of the expedition,
Claud Grant, gave an indication of the conditions the party had to endure.
The insect life was appalling, no sooner one species went to bed
another arose to annoy throughout the 24 hours. A sort of Bluebottle
fought with you for your food, and even tried to follow it down your
throat. Big brown leeches were everywhere - in the trees and on the forest
floor'.
For his efforts during the expedition Goodfellow was awarded the gold
medal of the British Ornithologists' Union.
During the 1920s Walter Goodfellow travelled and collected exten-
sively. In November 1925 he returned to Britain from the Far East with
27 birds of paradise, of six species, plus many fruit pigeons and parrots. In
1929 he brought to Britain the first Duivenbode's Lories and Bulwer's
Wattled Pheasants to be seen in this country. Many of the birds collected
by Goodfellow during this period went to the great private collections of
Alfred Ezra, Jean Delacour and Herbert Whitley, while other specimens
were acquired by London Zoo.
As well as a great collector, Goodfellow was also a great naturalist. He
wrote several articles in the Avicultural Magazine describing his expedi-
tions, and his detailed observations of the strange Standard-winged Bird of
Paradise Semioptera wallacei (1927: 57-65) are still the most important
yet on this species.
Walter Goodfellow died in 1953, 18 years after his last expedition.
Despite his highly important work, the only worthwhile obituary notice of
him appeared in the Avicultural Magazine written by David Seth-Smith
(1955: 33) even then two years after his death. However, he stands out as
one of the greatest collectors of live birds and without his pioneer efforts,
many species would never have reached the wonderful private collections
of the early decades of this century.

THE MOSCOW BIRD MARKET
BY JEFFERY BOSWAEL
(Bristol)
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989624771428571" page_id="56954036"  page_num="222" year="" vol="">
On Saturday, 25th October 1986,1 spent rather less than an hour at the
bird market in Moscow. It was enough, because the wildlife protection
laws introduced in 1980 preclude the sale of wild birds and all those for
sale were domesticated species. Except, that is, for a couple of Goldfinches
Carduelis carduelis and a Coal Tit Parus ater being offered from inside a
jacket!
The market's bird population was dominated by hundreds of ornamen-
tal pigeons, many of them in excellent condition. There were - at a guess -
a dozen or 20 breeds but I do not have enough knowledge to name them.
Among poultry, there were a dozen ornamental breeds, and a couple
more ordinary ones of chickens and bantams; a handful each of 'Greylag'
Anser anser and 'Chinese Swan' A. cygnoides Geese and a quartet of
'Mallards' Anas platyrhynchos and two Muscovy (appropriately enough)
Ducks Cairina moschata.
The number of canaries Serinus canaria was perhaps two or three hun-
dred. They varied quite widely in colour. Budgerigars Melopsittacus undu-
latus were about as common as canaries and there were a few Cockatiels
Nymphicus hollandicus and two individual brightly-coloured Australian
species, probably Rainbow Lorikeets Trichoglossus haematodus, and two
Ring-necked Parrakeets Psittacula krameri. The only other Psittacine was
a green parrot the size of a sparrow or a little larger, green with a delicate
peach colour all about the head.
To complete the list there were about 10 Zebra Finches Poephila
guttata .
It was 10.00 a.m. when I arrived, and the market was very crowded
with people (some buying and selling not birds but dogs, hamsters and
ornamental fish).
It was a grey, damp day and the market a somewhat drab place. But
we all walked on asphalt, rather than in mud, there was no unpleasant
smell and nothing at all untoward except for the very small transpor-
tation and display cages in which many of the smaller birds were con-
fined. It is difficult to understand my taxi-driver's surprise that I should
wish to visit such a 'dirty' place and to learn that Muscovites who might
otherwise take foreigners there refrain from doing so for fear of incur-
ring official displeasure.

HIGHLIGHT THE WILD: The Art of the Reid Henrys
</sectionHeader>

By Bruce Henry. Palaquin Publishing Ltd., Hulford&amp;apos;s Lane, Hartley
Witney, Hampshire RG27 SAG. ISBN 0.90681401 4. 152 pages. 40 full
page colour plates, 67 black and white illustrations. Available from the
publishers, price #20.00 plus #2.00 postage and packing.
The very first birds I ever kept were a pair of Black-headed Munias
Lonchura malacca and I've been passionately interested in the genus ever
since. Throughout the 1950s I bought every field guide I could find, as
long as it had a mueia in it. In 1955 I was delighted to discover a new
book Guide to the Birds of Ceylon by G.M. Henry, and will never forget
the plate illustrating the Ceylon Hill Munia L, kelmrti . The plates, painted
by the author, were in the classic field guide tradition epitomised by
Archibald Thorburn and Roland Green. They indicated a limit of habitat
and portrayed the birds in natural positions. I loved them then, and still
do. Then, in 1960 I received C.1. Skead&amp;apos;s The Canaries , Seedeaters and
Buntings of Southern Africa which is illustrated in part by D.M. Henry,
very much in the tradition of G.M. Henry, I had discovered the Henrys,
A few years later I joined the Society of Wildlife Artists and not only
became familiar with the work of D.M. Henry, or David Reid Henry as
he was known, but met him at one of the exhibitions and also at one of
the Avicultural Society evenings. On the latter occasion, if I remember
right, David was accompanied not by his celebrated African Crowned
Eagle, 'Tiara 9 , but by a Peregrine Falcon. He explained how the plumage
patterns of the breast of a bird of prey vary from neat and regular on a
recently-fed bird, to irregular and overlapping on a hungry bird with an
empty crop and demonstrated this by feeding the bird on hand. David was
one of my hero figures and I think I admired his bird paintings more than
those of any other .... certainly his style was the one I tried to emulate
most.
My job has me travelling about the globe a great deal, with timing that
Pm not always able to control I was, therefore, quite delighted to be
able to attend an exhibition of the art of the Reid Henrys held in London
in October, and - like all members of the Society - to have the opportunity
of buying a copy of the book Highlight the Wild at a pre-publication
price. To my surprise I learned that there were not two, but three Henrys.
George was the father, David and Bruce the two sons, and both painters
like their father. The book is written by Bruce Henry, the only surviving
member of the trio.
It is a fascinating book, unique in its content for it is simultaneously

biography and autobiography. Unlike most books of its kind, however,
the author not only writes the usual biographical data, and very interesting
too, about family history and personalities, but contributes chapters on
how the Henrys painted and how he himself paints. I found this totally
absorbing. The book is lavishly illustrated with over 40 colour plates
divided equally between the three, together with a large number of repro-
ductions of sketches from notebooks and field sketch pads.
Many readers will be familiar with the work of David Reid Henry,
whose superb bird portraits frequently illustrated the Avicultural Maga-
zine in the days when a colour plate was not beyond the editor's produc-
tion budget. And those who own George Henry's Ceylon book will know
him well. Bruce Henry, however, will be new to most readers. His style
reminds me of George Lodge. He paints pictures which contain birds (a
subtle but significant difference) and his scope is broader than that of
his father or brother, ranging from birds to animals, flowers and true
landscapes. Discovering him in this book was a surprise and a pleasure.
This is a book for lovers of bird artists, the many colour plates will be
a source of pleasure (and in some cases a useful reference) and the text
most enjoyable reading.

Eds. Greg and Linda Harrison. W.B. Saunders, West Washington Square,
Philadelphia, Pa. 19105, USA. 75 US dollars.
Thirty-three avian veterinary specialists, mostly American, have pooled
their knowledge to produce this much needed work. The editors are Greg
Harrison, Florida veterinarian, and his wife Linda.
This weighty volume of more than 700 pages will prove invaluable to
veterinarians and advanced aviculturists. An ambitious project, it covers
in detail all aspects of avian medicine and surgery. These include haema-
tology, microsurgery, microbiology, sex determination techniques, dis-
eases of imported birds, zoonotic diseases, virology, serology, diagnostic
tests, fractures, evaluation of droppings, aerosol therapy, radiology and
many other subjects.
Its scope and depth are perhaps unprecedented: it is a mine of practical
information. For example, five authors contribute to the chapter on diag-
nosis. Charts represent the most common clinical conditions, detailing
clinical signs, species affected, history and possible causes. The veterinarian
with but slight experience of birds should find this section of great value.
The chapter on therapeutics includes 20 pages of tables listing anti-

Chloromycetin palmitate (Parke-Davis) being useful in hand-feeding birds
in which food passage has slowed owing to bacterial infection.
The chapter on clinical anatomy contains numerous original line
drawings showing sections from a growing feather, skeleton, cranial oste-
ology, musculature, air sacs, internal structures, viscera; arterial supply,
major blood vessels, etc., etc.
There are more than 300 illustrations. Many of the photographs are
instructive - shaping a beak, weighing, handling, collecting blood, preparing
blood smears, endoscopy and the use of an orthopaedic stockingette as a
temporary protective device to prevent self-mutilation of sternal injuries
or surgery.
In his Foreword to this book, Murray Fowler wrote: Ten or 15 years
ago only a handful of pioneers devoted significant practice time to birds.
Now there are many full-time avian practices, some with three or more
clinicians and full laboratory support. Hundreds of practitioners devote a
major percentage of their time to birds.' He was writing of the situation
in the USA. Hopefully, during the next decade more specialist avian
practices will be developed in the UK. This volume will surely point the
way.
It is available from the publishers but no doubt a distributor will be
found in the U.K.

INTERNATIONAL ZOO YEARBOOK - VOLUME 24/25

<bodyText confidence="0.9917912" page_id="56954043"  page_num="229" year="" vol="">
Ed. P.J. Olney. Published by the Zoological Society of London, Regent's
Park, London NW1 4RY. IBSN 0074-9664. 651 pages, 30 b/w photo-
graphs, numerous line drawings and diagrams. Price: #46,00 hardback,

The International Zoo Yearbook is a unique publication and an essen-
tial addition to the library of all those seriously concerned with breeding
birds and animals of non-domesticated species.
Normally published annually, the recently published volume (24/25)
covers two years, 1982 and 1983. One of the most avidly read sections of
the Yearbook is that devoted to records of birds, mammals and reptiles
bred in zoos throughout the world. The giant task of collating data from
all the major zoos and countless smaller ones, inevitably means that the
records are two years behind publication date. Nevertheless, they provide
the world's only comprehensive reference to what is being bred and where.
Hatchings (and births) and the number of surviving young are recorded.

(One cannot help reflecting that the number of birds bred by zoos is
small in comparison with numbers reared by private aviculturists.)
The census of rare animals in captivity provides invaluable information
to breeders and zoo visitors interested in a particular species. As an ex-
ample, in 1983 there were eight Bulwer's Wattled Pheasants in zoos: two
in Antwerp, four in San Diego and two in Walsrode.
Each volume takes as its theme a subject which occupies a large pro-
portion of its pages. Breeding endangered species is the theme of the vol-
ume under review; in fact, it contains all the papers presented at the
Fourth World Convention in the Netherlands during 1984. The 219 pages
in this section include papers on diurnal raptors, breeding programmes for
waterfowl and flamingos, and breeding and reintroduction of pheasants.
In 'Captive management and the conservation of birds 5 , Alexandra
Dixon explains why captive breeding as a means of conservation is more
easily applied with birds than with mammals. He uses several case histories
to illustrate this point.
By 1980 it was believed that the population of the Lord Howe Island
Rail (a flightless species) had been reduced to under 20. After a two-year
study of the birds and their habitats, three pairs were taken into captivity
in 1980 and two more pairs the following year. In December 1983, when
the captive breeding programme ended, 78 had been reared, 74 of which
had been released. Some of these had themselves bred successfully by
February 1983.
A standard feature in the International Zoo Yearbook is that of new
developments in the zoo world. Breeding the Great Indian Hornbill at
Cotswold Wildlife Park and a unit for the transportation of developing
eggs are just two of the papers found here.
The reference section includes addresses, names of curators and
numbers of specimens kept of nearly all the zoos and aquaria of the
world. Attendance figures are also given.

the same title but was designated as Volume II. This volume was not
uniform in size to the first, also the dust wrapper was white (in the first
volume the dust wrapper was brown). Volumes IV and V are uniform to
Volume II in that they are of the same size and also have white dust
wrappers.
Although these two volumes are dated 1982, they have only recently
appeared in the UK (November 1986). Whether Volume III will appear is
debatable as the author is no longer alive.
The volumes are large format (1434 x 11 in - 36.8 cm x 27.9 cm). There
are some 452 pages (206 in Volume IV and 246 in Volume V). They are
illustrated throughout in colour with photographs by the author and
paintings by Etienne Demonte.
Some of the photographs are of poor quality; very few are of a pro-
fessional standard. However, as many depict species which have rarely if
ever been illustrated before and as many show behavioural activity (i.e.
nest-building, incubating, feeding of young, stretching, yawning, bathing,
etc.), they are of interest and add greatly to the usefulness of the volumes.
The colour paintings are excellent but few are captioned and as some
appear before, and others after, descriptions of the species depicted, con-
fusion may arise.
In both volumes, the text in Portuguese runs parallel down the page
with the English text. From pages 1-84 the Portuguese text takes up the
top half of each page with the English translation on the bottom half.
The translation is poor and parts of the text are extremely difficult to
follow. Pages 3-84 are taken up with general information on the Trochili-
dae including annual cycle, biological and ethological remarks, ecological
considerations related to hummingbirds, electrocardiographic tracings of
hummingbirds, sonographical analysis of the songs and calls of humming-
birds, and the study of ornithology in Brazil. Pages 77-426 give the clas-
sification and description of species and subspecies (found in Brazil).
Pages 427-430 give a list of types examined in certain museums and the
remaining pages are taken up with an extensive, although inadequate (as
so many well-known papers and other publications are missing) bibliog-
raphy and a general index.
The Trochilidae is a family about which one can rarely generalise. I
have learned over the years that should one state that hummingbirds
never do such-and-such a thing, eventually a species will surely prove
otherwise. Many authors fall into this trap and Ruschi is no exception.
On page 4 he states that hummingbirds are unable to walk on the
ground. Adelomyia melanogenys can and often does walk on the ground,
also Phlogophilus hemileucurus may not actually 'walk' but it certainly
can run along the ground. On page 14 Ruschi states that the song is

hereditary. Skutch (in many of his writings) gives proof that many, if
not all species learn rather than inherit their songs.
Ruschi, under the subheading 'Restocking and reproduction in cap-
tivity' (pp 34-35) mentions that more than 100 species have repro-
duced in the aviaries of the Museu de Biologia Prof. Mello Leitao. Due
(partly) to this success, hummingbirds were dispatched to zoos and in-
stitutions in many parts of the world. It appears that 50 specimens were
sent to London Zoo. As the birds were offered as the nucleus of a world-
wide breeding programme, the Brazilian authorities must have been
somewhat naive to say the least! Although Ruschi must have believed
that the birds would, in fact, reproduce as he writes: 'There is no diffi-
culty to make hummingbirds live and reproduce in captivity; the indis-
pensable requirements: water, tree, nectar flowers, food with water and
25% sugar (from sugar cane), protein, the raising of Dipteros of the genera
Drosophila, fed with banana, ananas Kept under almost natural
conditions in aviaries in Brazil, the above would no doubt prove correct,
but this is far from the case in more temperate climes where the birds have
to be housed in heated indoor accommodation.
The main section of the two volumes is taken up with the description
of species/subspecies, and for each the following data are given: geo-
graphical distribution, characteristics, habitat, migration and behaviour
such as nesting, bathing, song, resting attitudes, courtship and sleeping.
As with an earlier book, Hummingbirds of the State of Espirito Santo ,
(reviewed by me, Avicultural Magazine , 89: 242-243), Ruschi has again
generalised on certain aspects. As many of the species on which he writes
have been studied (by him) in captivity, one would have thought that he
would have recorded the sexual differences in such genera as Colibri
(males have a shorter and less curved bill than females), and Phaethomis
(length of tail and bill), yet he often writes 'sexes similar'.
Some observations made by the author are of particular interest and
provide details which, as far as I am aware, have not before been recorded
(in English). In the past, many authors (including myself) have believed
that 25% of females in Florisuga mellivora are dimorphic. Ruschi (p. 192)
informs us that all immature birds have plumage similar to that of an adult
male and it is only after the first moult that females acquire their distinc-
tive colour pattern.
In Hummingbirds of the State of Espirito Santo , Ruschi failed to des-
cribe the eclipse plumage of certain Brazilian species. This he rectifies in
the current volumes, although he does still generalise somewhat with the
descriptions. Heliomaster squamosus males do not 'become like the fe-
male', there are obvious plumage differences, and Calliphlox amethystina

loses its long tail feathers and iridescent throat patch when in eclipse
plumage. Of special interest is the description of the eclipse plumage phase
in Heliothryx aurita (p. 402). If it is correct, it would mean that there are
five species of hummingbird that have an eclipse plumage. However,
Ruschi does spoil this most interesting observation when he writes, This
bird possesses a peculiarity found only in its genera (sic) in the family
Trochilidae. The male has a post-nuptial molt (sic) in which he loses all
his iridescent feathers and looks entirely like the female adults'. As men-
tioned earlier, Ruschi describes the eclipse plumage phase in other spe-
cies (not from the genus Heliothryx). I can only presume he either wrote
on certain species at different times and then brought all his observations
together to form the volumes under review, or the translation is incorrect.
Whichever is the case, H. aurita males could not possibly '....become
like adult females', as the latter has a much longer tail than the male. The
species has proven almost impossible to keep alive for any length of time
in captivity (in Europe) and only someone like Ruschi (who kept hum-
mingbirds under near natural conditions) could have witnessed the eclipse
plumage phase.
Many of the descriptions of nuptial displays are extremely detailed and
it was most interesting to learn that Heliactin comuta does use its 'horns'
during the display; something I had never witnessed when I kept and
studied the species.
Many may feel that at #165.00 the two volumes are somewhat expen-
sive, but with such a wealth of detail, to my mind they are well worth the
money. If you are interested in the Trochilidae, then purchase the volumes,
you will not regret it.
For the more monetary minded, it is worth noting that all previous
volumes in this series have almost doubled in value the moment they have
gone out of print.

The Cloven-feathered Dove (Drepanoptila holosericea)
It was with interest and gratitude that I read the very interesting and
well-informed comments by Mr. Derek Goodwin (Vol. 91, p. 242-3), an
ornithologist of international repute, concerning my article (Vol 91, p.
32-41) on the captive rearing of the Cloven-feathered Dove, for which I
hope he will accept my deepest thanks.
Since my article was published I have made further observations which
exactly confirm Derek Goodwin&amp;apos;s hypotheses.
I have now reared birds of a third generation and the behaviour of
these young is exactly the same as that of their predecessors taken from
the wild.
The rule of only one egg and care by the female exclusively are exactly
confirmed but we have since observed matings, which was not the case at
the time of publication. Infrequent and brief pairing on branches of foliage
had been described, but generally successful coupling takes place on the
ground, as Mr. Derek Goodwin supposes.
Second generation males, like their fathers, come down to the ground
to mate. When my keeper tells me that he has seen a male on the ground,
we know that the female must lay in the days that follow. No particular
site on the ground has been recorded but this point needs further observa-
tion.
In New Caledonia efforts have been made to protect this unique and
splendid bird but these clash with material impossibilities. The &amp;apos;Green
Pigeon&amp;apos; continues to be shot at every opportunity.
I share Mr. Derek Goodwin's opinion on the possibility of releasing
birds reared in captivity on a suitable island. I am myself prepared to parti-
cipate in such a project but my experience of nature, and above all, human
nature makes me express many reservations. For every successful exper-
ience, such as that of Little Tobago and its birds of paradise, how many
failures!
As for New Caledonian birds, one interesting attempt to transplant the
splendid Homed Parrot Eunymphicus c. comutus was made several decades
ago in conditions apparently ideal. These birds, endemic to the mountains
of New Caledonia, were transported to the nearby island of Mare which
forms part of the Loyalty Islands, adjoining New Caledonia. Two years
later none of these birds was left on Mare. Optimists said that they had
returned to their place of origin, others thought that they had perished
either spontaneously or with the aid of the aboriginal natives. No habi-
tat could have resembled more closely that of these birds' origin.

One should reflect on this before dealing recklessly with such a prec-
ious capital but the hypothesis is attractive and should not be lost from
view.
In the meantime I persevere with breeding the Cloven-feathered Dove
with some success but also some failures and disappointments. Several
birds have died accidentally, surviving usually until the beginning of the
the breeding season. The statement about the compatibility of pairs
applies equally to wild birds as to their descendants. Some pairs are
incompatible and the female can sometimes be killed in a few minutes
with no warning of such aggression.. We have saved some in a very unfor-
tunate state, but unhappily we have equally lost some.
For two years I did not rear one bird: clear eggs, dead in shell, very
bad weather conditions. However, at the moment of writing, two young
are almost independent and a third is preparing to leave the nest. It is
at these moments that aviculturists have the temerity to think that their
efforts count for something.

Breeding the Moluccan Mannikin (Lonchura molucca vagans)
Readers might be interested to know that I was successful with the
Moluccan Mannikin this year. Two chicks left the nest on 11th September
and are now fully supporting (1st October). At first, the chicks were very
like an adult Bib-Finch Lepidopygia nana in appearance and size but they
are now almost as big as the parents and are just starting to show the head
colour.
Six established adults of unknown sex and each wearing a different
coloured split ring were released into a new aviary at the end of June.
The accommodation was shared with Narcissus Flycatchers and Variable
Sunbirds. At first, the Mannikins built the usual roosting nest in a standard
finch, open-fronted nest box, placed high up in the aviary and screened
with small branches of fir. All six shared this with no animosity. After a
short time, however, I noticed that one Mannikin appeared to be chasing
the others away from the nest-box. As I could not be sure which two of
the six had paired up, I decided to leave things as they were. I had pre-
viously bred the Bib-Finch with unmated birds being present and on this
occasion there was no actual fighting. I am still not certain, however,
whether the Moluccan Mannikins are better housed in pairs or in a group.
I was subsequently able to identify the breeding pair and to observe that

the chicks would beg for food from any of the six adults. The main

but believe it to have been approximately 15 days. The chicks left the nest

VISIT TO PARKLANDS

Members and their guests were priviiedged to be invited by Mr. and
Mrs. Ken Dolton to visit their home at Parklands, near Worcester, on
Sunday, 14th September, 1986.
After a pleasant lunch at the Crown Inn, Hallow, over 80 visitors
assembled at Parklands at 2.30 pm. and our hosts conducted us round
their very extensive collection of psittacines and waterfowl and what must
be one of the largest collection of tortoises in the country. All these were
contained within a series of beautifully landscaped gardens with many
rare specimen trees and shrubs. It was hard to believe that 20 years pre-
viously this magnificent park had been rough fields and that Ken Dolton
had created all this beauty and interest by himself.
Our hosts entertained us to a very lavish tea in the garden and it was
pleasant to sit in the warm autumn sun in such lovely surroundings. For
those of use who had not seen Parklands before the visit was a revelation
and the warm welcome from our hosts gave great pleasure to everyone and
a day to remember. It was particularly generous of our hosts to donate
the entrance money (#83.00) to the Society's funds. Ken Dolton is a very
active Council Member and the Society is most grateful to him and his
charming wife for all their interest and support.

OWL SYMPOSIUM AT LILFORD HALL
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.97630019047619" page_id="56954051"  page_num="237" year="" vol="">
A symposium on owls is to be held at Lilford Hall, nr. Oundle, Peter-
borough, on 10th May 1987 and the emphasis will be on the captive
maintenance and propagation of these interesting birds. Although a
number of papers are to be presented by aviculturists with long experience
in the care of owls it is intended that the symposium should be run in an
informal manner which will encourage comment and participation from
the audience.
Lilford Hall is situated in a beautiful park which is stocked with an ex-
tensive collection of birds including many species of owls. Large numbers
of owls have been bred in the aviaries at Lilford during the past decade and
the symposium has been arranged at a time when young owls of many spe-
cies should be in evidence.
The morning session is planned to run from 10.00 a.m. to 12.30 p.m,
and the afternoon session from 3.00 p.m. until 5.30 p.m. This programme
has been arranged so as to allow those attending the symposium to have
adequate time to tour the aviaries and a wildlife exhibition which is to be
held in the Hall on the same day.
The morning session of the programme will be under the chairmanship
of Peter Olney (Curator of Birds and Reptiles at London Zoo) and John
Ashbourne will chair the afternoon session. The following papers will be
included during the symposium:
