THE BLUE EARED PHEASANT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.94364984375" page_id="56311018"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
{Crossoptilon auritum )
By J. Delacour (Los Angeles, California, U.S.A.)
The three species of Eared Pheasants, the Brown, the Blue, and the
White (some sub-species of which have a great deal of bluish-grey),
range through the high plateaus and the slopes of the mountains of
northern China, Mongolia, and Tibet. Alone among pheasants, the
males and the females are exactly alike in shape and in colour, the
former being distinguished from their mates by a spur on the leg and
a slightly differently shaped velvety red patch on the face. The Tibetan
species, C. crossoptilon , has at least five sub-species, varying from almost
pure white to dark grey ; but all differ from the other two more
northern species in having the ear-tufts short, hardly noticeable as they
do not stand over the top of the nape, and a much flatter, thicker tail.
They are also decidedly larger.
The Brown Eared Pheasant (C. mantchuricum ) was long the only one
known in captivity. It arrived in Paris in 1864 and has been reared
in great numbers in France since 1866. The first importation consisted
of one male and two females and two more males reached London
in 1866. These five birds are the ancestors of the whole captive
population of the species as none has ever left China since. They
are perhaps extinct to-day in the wild state. For a long time common
in pheasantries they have become more difficult to rear during the
last twenty years, many birds proving infertile. But quite a few have
been raised lately in North America and in Europe, so that, with
care, it will probably be possible to save this very fine species from
extinction.
The White Eared Pheasant came to America in small numbers in
1935. They never bred very freely, but a small stock has been
maintained ever since.
The Blue Eared Pheasant is now the most abundant in captivity.
It is perhaps also the most beautiful of all, both in colour and more

particularly in shape, as its tail is highly ornamental, having all the
webs of the central feathers entirely separated and distinct, lace-like
in effect. It lives on the mountains of north-western China and
neighbouring countries : northern Kokonor, Kansu, and the Ala Shan
Range. It is found far in the interior and this explains why it had
never been sent out alive before 1929, when Mr. A. Hampe, then
a resident of Shanghai, whom I had commissioned for that purpose,
sent to Cleres some thirty birds which he had managed to collect
with great effort and difficulties. Some were reared during the
following years and more were sent to Germany and to the United
States in 1932. Now the species is well established throughout the
world and breeds successfully in many zoos and game farms. It is
one of the finest acquisitions of aviculture in recent times.

To enlarge on the preliminary note which appeared in the
November-December issue of the Magazine, the object of the Exchange
and Mart scheme is to provide a channel through which members
can, with as little delay and fuss as possible, exchange, buy, or sell
their surplus birds, primarily with a view to making up breeding pairs,
and thus bringing about an improvement in the breeding stock of
foreign birds.
It is not envisaged that the scheme should provide a market for
the disposal of birds in which the member has lost interest, but to
bring together specimens of the rarer species which are not in the
usual way available, or easily obtainable, from the dealers.
The scheme does not apply to British birds, nor to the commoner
foreign birds. It is available to all members of the Society and will
run from January to January in each year. The subscription is 5^.
per annum.
Members are entitled to send, as often as they think necessary, a list
of birds wanted and for disposal. If at all possible the member will
then be put in touch with others who either want the birds offered
or have for disposal birds which are required.
A few members have already availed themselves of the facilities,
and there are on offer many interesting species, but to make the
scheme absolutely worth-while, many new members must be enrolled.
The scheme, if it receives the co-operation of the members, should
prove most beneficial and will satisfy a long-felt want which cannot
be satisfied by any other means. Please therefore do your utmost to
make the scheme a success.
The Society will not enter into any negotiations with regard to
the birds--the members will be left to make such arrangements

ON THE DISPLAY OF THE SIX-PLUMED BIRD
OF PARADISE, PAROTIA SEFILATA (PENNANT)
By Sten Bergman (Ronninge per Stockholm, Sweden)
(Reprinted by kind permission from Nova Guinea, new ser., vol. 8,
Part i, July, 1957)

It is not only the magnificent colouring and wonderful adornments
of the Birds of Paradise that arouse our admiration. The displays of
the different species are so varied and so curious that it is sometimes
difficult to believe one's eyes on seeing them for the first time.
One of the most remarkable displays of any bird of this family is
the dance performed by the male Six-plumed Bird of Paradise
Parotia sejilata (Pennant). This bird lives only in the western parts of
Dutch New Guinea, where it occurs in the Tamrau, the Arfak, and
the Wandammen Mountains. According to Mayr {List of New Guinea
Birds , New York, 1941, p. 172), it lives at an elevation of between
1,200 and 1,800 m., which accords well with my own experience.
I have often observed this bird between 1,200 and 1,600 metres in
the Arfak Mountains, especially whilst camping for three weeks not
far from a place known as Bivouac October. There I also found
several display grounds, and I spent many hours in small hides of
leafy branches, which I had arranged a few metres from the display
clearings. These were always situated on the ground in dense forest
and were usually overshadowed by large trees.
The dancing-places were generally less than one square metre in
diameter and of indefinite shape. Sometimes they were more square,
sometimes more oblong. But one absolutely essential condition for
the choice of such a place was that there should be one or two horizontal
branches growing at a suitable height over the area. At the place
where I spent most of the time, these branches were approximately
60 cm. from the ground.
It is the habit of Parotia sefilata to give his dancing-place a daily
clean up. Every leaf or twig which falls down is thrown outside as

<bodyText confidence="0.999362911111111" page_id="56311015"  page_num="4" year="" vol="">
soon as it is observed by the bird. All vegetation is removed so that
Parotia has an earth floor to dance on.
When, under cover of darkness, I entered one of my hides, which
was placed at a distance of four metres from the display ground, I first
took a handful of leaves and threw them over the dance floor.
At 6.30 a.m., half an hour after daybreak, I heard a harsh cry,
very similar to that of the European Jay (Garrulus glandarius L.).
It was Parotia announcing its arrival. It was sitting in a tree about
20 m. away from me, to judge by the sound. From this position
its cry was repeated again and again, until suddenly I heard the beat
of wings immediately outside the hide. As I looked out through one
of my peep-holes I saw the velvet-black Bird of Paradise alight on
one of the horizontal branches above the display ground.
It caught sight of all the leaves that I had strewn about and instantly
flew down and began to remove them. It picked up the leaves, one
at a time, in its beak and flung them towards the outer edge of the
dancing-place. It then hopped nearer to the edge and with great
energy threw the leaves outside the clearing, where there already lay
a mass of dry leaves, twigs, and other rubbish.
The silver-white triangle on its forehead shone very vividly in the
dim light, and the six long wires on its head swayed with every move-
ment. Even the metallic sheen of the breastplate glistened now and
again. Not until the last leaf had been removed and the dancing- j
place was as smooth and neat as before, was it satisfied and flew away.
I did not see any dance that time. The Papuans said that " korangan ", j
as they call the bird, usually dances in the morning and in the afternoon.
The same display times apply to most Birds of Paradise.
Some days later, it was 8th August, I went to the place at 2.30 in
the afternoon. I took a Papuan with me merely for the purpose of
sending him home again as soon as I had entered the hide, in case
there might be any Bird of Paradise in the vicinity, who might observe
me going in. Before creeping into the hide, I again strewed a handful
of leaves over the display ground.
After I had waited ten minutes a young male, or a female--as they
have the same brown-striped plumage--arrived and flew down to
the dancing-place. It hopped about for a few minutes but did not
attempt to clear away any leaves, and then flew up on to a branch
barely two metres away from me. After that it flew off and disappeared |
into the forest.
Suddenly, at about 4 o'clock, a male bird flew down to the display ,
ground and began to clear away the leaves that I had thrown there.
When he had done this for a few minutes, he shook his feathers, flew
on to one of the branches above the ground and uttered his harsh
cry twice. He then flew down again and continued to pick up the
leaves.

S. BERGMAN-THE DISPLAY OF THE SIX-PLUMED BIRD OF PARADISE 5
After a while he again shook his feathers and then stood motionless
for a moment. He appeared to stiffen, stretched his head upwards
and extended his neck. Then the lower part of his body broadened
increasingly as he expanded the long, ornamental plumes growing
from the sides of the body. The three long wires on either side of
the head were swept out to the sides and then forwards and down-
wards. The feathers of the silver-white triangle on the forehead were
erected and curved forward towards the beak. All round his body
the long, velvet-black, ornamental plumes were formed like a ballet
skirt, completely circular and entirely covering the wings, which
were underneath the skirt.
The head was thrust forwards and downwards and was then
swayed from right to left with continuous rapid movements. This
made the small flags of the wires swing about all the time at a fast
tempo. The sight of the bird with its curious velvet-black dancing
skirt standing out almost horizontally from the body, and the extra-
ordinary motion of the head was so astonishing that I watched the
performance with breathless excitement.
Thereafter, like a prima ballerina on the stage of an opera house,
the bird began to dance from right to left and in semicircles. The
similarity to the dance of a human being was so amazing that I sat
spellbound.
Suddenly the bird stopped, lowered its dancing skirt and resumed
its normal appearance. After this it flew up on to a branch, uttered
its cry twice and then returned to the ground and continued to
remove all the remaining leaves. Thereafter it left the place, but
remained for some time in the vicinity, where its cry could be heard
occasionally.
It was fairly chilly in the afternoon at this place, which was situated
at approximately 1,500 metres. When I left it at 5 p.m., my ther-
mometer registered 16 degrees Centigrade.
At the various display grounds where I have made observations,
I never saw more than one male in full plumage. On the other hand,
I have sometimes seen a brown specimen, i.e. a female or a young
male. On each occasion, when I kept to my hide, Parotid's harsh
cry, uttered at fairly short intervals, was heard now and then in the
vicinity.
I got the impression that each display ground was owned by one
male in full plumage, who kept a more or less continuous watch on
the place all day, exactly in the same manner as Diphyllodes respublica
(Bonaparte) on the islands of Waigeu and Batana. The male of this
species of Bird of Paradise has a similar display ground and he has
precisely the same habit of removing all leaves and refuse which fall
on the clearing.

live specimens of Parotia sejilata to Sweden for the purpose of con-
tinuing my studies and observations of these birds. The photographs j
illustrating this article are all taken in my home at Ronninge, 30 kilo-
metres from Stockholm.
All my specimens of Parotia are, unfortunately, males, as I did not
succeed in getting hold of a single female, which of almost all Birds of
Paradise are extremely difficult to catch. Although the Papuans who
caught my Parotia insisted that the brown specimens were females,
it soon became apparent that they were young males. The plumage
of females and young males of many species of Birds of Paradise is j
almost identical and extremely difficult and sometimes even impossible
to distinguish.
The chief reason why females are so difficult to catch is probably
the fact that they do not regularly visit the display grounds or display
trees. The males, on the contrary, visit them every day but the females
only occasionally or perhaps only when they want to get mated.
All my specimens of Parotia have danced, the young males in their
brown plumage as well as the older males in their full black plumage.
They have danced all through the year, except during the moulting
season, which lasts for approximately four months. In Sweden, the
Parotia &amp;apos;s moult takes place, as a rule, during the summer, but it
may start at any date between March and June, or even later, and
continue until well into the autumn, or in exceptional cases it may
begin at the end of the summer.
My Six-plumed Birds of Paradise dance mostly in the morning
and in the afternoon, as they do in their native country. During the
whole year the birds have electric lighting for 12 hours per day, from
8 a.m. to 8 p.m., since in New Guinea they are accustomed to 12 hours
of daylight and 12 hours of darkness.
As already mentioned, the young males in their brown plumage
dance also, and some of my brown males have, month after month,
danced more zealously than the black males, and in certain cases
with greater variation in the dance.
When I had my Six-plumed Birds of Paradise in Sorong for two
months before leaving New Guinea, two young males danced every
day. One of them, in particular, was tireless and could dance more
than fifty times a day. But the young males have not a dancing-skirt
which envelops the body like the black ones, only the front is covered.
As they have no wires on their heads and have neither the gleaming
breastplate nor the silver-white triangle on the foreheads, their dance
is not so impressive. Otherwise the choreography is the same, except
that my young males were more inclined to wander about the floor
during the dance, and executed a number of leaps straight up into
the air, which I have not observed among the black ones (Plate I).
When one of my Parotia feels a desire to dance, it nearly always

begins by hopping on the lowest perch and flicking its wings, at the
same time rapidly spreading and contracting its tail feathers. It
may continue like this for a long or short period, and will then hop
down on to the ground again. It then adopts a curious attitude.
It points its head and beak obliquely upwards, stretches its body
in the same direction and stands motionless, as though transfixed,
for some seconds (Plate II). It then quickly changes its position so
that its head is pointed towards the ground and its tail pointed
upwards (Plate III, upper picture).
This position is retained for only a few seconds, after which the bird
slowly raises its head, lowers its tail and begins to spread out the
plumes of its dance skirt so that the skirt becomes absolutely circular.
The tail is bent sideways to prevent its getting in the way during the
dance (Plate III, lower picture).
Then it begins to dance, moving from side to side and in semi-
circles, swaying its head continuously from right to left so that all six
wires, with their small flags at the ends, quiver (Plate IV). Provided
no other bird comes to disturb the dancer, it will pause for a moment
in its dance after a little while, bend its legs, lower its dancing-skirt
and begin to sway its head still more laterally and still faster than
during the usual dance (Plate V).
From this second dance pose it may sometimes pass on to a third,
in which, with outspread skirt, it hops between two points at a couple
of decimetres distance from each other. It may then revert to dancing
in the usual manner. When the dance is finished, the bird nearly
always utters its harsh cry.
As a rule it will then fly up on to the lowest perch and hop nervously,
flicking its wings and expanding and contracting its tail feathers. It
then flies to the ground again, hops about on one spot with upstretched
body, ruffles its plumage, preens itself for a moment, returns to its
position with body stretched upwards and beak pointed obliquely
upwards until it suddenly lowers its head towards the ground and
stands motionless for some seconds, then raises its head and its whole
body, spreads out its skirt, and begins to dance again.
Sometimes, however, it begins the dance in quite a different way.
It will suddenly stand on the ground, with legs wide apart, and,
without more ado, raise its dancing-skirt, sweep its wires outwards
and forwards and begin to dance. When starting in this way, the
dance will usually be short and not so elaborate as when it starts in
the normal way.
Should any other Parotia in the same room fly on to the lowest perch
or down to the ground while another bird is dancing, the whole dance
is changed. The dancer will then turn his head and his dancing-skirt
in the other bird's direction, and whenever the latter makes the
slightest move the dancer readjusts his position so that he always

faces the other bird. If the newcomer sits quite still, the dancer
will stand rooted to the spot, with outspread skirt and head swaying
to and fro.
Even if there are several Six-plumed Birds of Paradise in the same
room, it is very seldom that two will dance at the same time. They
always prefer to dance solo. While one dances the others sit and
watch. When the dancer has finished his performance, one of the
onlookers will often fly down and dance. In this way they take it in
turns to dance solo. Only on very rare occasions has it happened
that two birds have danced together for a few moments.
At present I have six Parotia in a room which is divided into two
sections by wire netting, four birds in one section, and two in the
other. If one of the birds in each section wants to dance at the same
time and both begin to dance for a moment, they often get furiously
angry with each other and they both fly at the netting and try to peck
at each other.
If two birds in the same section fly down and prepare to dance,
they also get very annoyed with each other and both try to chase the
other off or start a fight. This is probably explained by the fact that,
as already mentioned, each male Six-plumed Bird of Paradise very
likely has its own dancing-place in the forest, where no other male
is allowed to dance and thereby attract a female. If two of my males
dance in the same section or in adjoining sections, they feel them-
selves to be rivals and each wants to chase away the other.
Occasionally, also, Parotia dances on a branch. In such case the
bird begins by taking up a similar attitude on the branch to that
adopted before the dance on the ground. Thus, after some hop
along the branch, it suddenly stands motionless with its body stretched
in an almost vertical position and its beak pointed obliquely upwards
(Plate VI). Thereafter with a quick movement it turns its body
horizontally, then rises, spreads its skirt, and takes up the dance
position shown in Plate VII. Of course, when it dances on a branch
it can only move along the branch. It usually remains in the same
place on the branch, but it always sways its head in the same manner
as when it dances on the ground.
Stresemann describes a type of dance performed by a male Parotia
sefilata in the London Zoo, and illustrates it by a drawing ( Orn .
Monatsberichte , 39, 1931, pp. 4-6). In this type of dance only the
front of the bird is covered by the long plumes which normally form
the circular dancing-skirt. In my opinion this type of dance, per-
formed by a male in full dress, is probably an exception, as I never
have seen it in my seven years' experience of keeping live Parotia.

By P. M. A. Harwood, M.R.C.V.S. (Darlington, Western Australia)
Some wonderful work has been done by modern ornithologists in
working out the whys and wherefores of bird behaviour. Unfortunately
the results of a major part of this work are of little value to avicul-
turists, partly because of the rather profuse use of technical terms which
make many reports barely intelligible to the average lay person, and
partly because very little is written dealing with the effects of captivity
on behaviour. In this article the author attempts to set out his facts
in simple terms, and a series of typical " case histories " are given as
examples throughout. Because the use of some scientific terms is
unavoidable a glossary is included, and as everything is reputed to
be upside down in Australia, this comes at the beginning instead of
the end.
Glossary
Behaviour. The normal reactions of a normal bird to its normal
circumstances of life.
Compensation. The adaption by a bird to abnormal or unusual
circumstances.
Equilibrium. A state of balance between cause and effect.
Psychological. Refers to the functions of the mind, i.e. perception,
sensation, memory, thought, etc., and more broadly to the behaviour
of the organism in relation to its environment.
Psychosis. An illness of mental origin.
Psycho-somatic. An effect on the physical part of the body, induced by
an effect of mental origin.
Stimulus. An outside agent or effect producing an exciting or irritating
effect on the organism.
Sublimation. The conversion of an instinctive reaction into some other
usually less violent response.
Trauma. An injury.
In considering the psychological effects that captivity has on a bird,
I shall only deal with those species which have yet to become truly
domesticated. Progressive generations of aviary breeding result in a
gradual loss of the instinctive reactions upon which a wild bird depends
to survive. As an example take the domestic duck which is descended
from Mallard stock, but which has virtually lost its powers of flight.
Before getting down to cases, I would like first, to make a
generalization. The more intelligent the bird is, the more serious are
the psychological effects of captivity. Only the highly intelligent
species will develop psychoses as a result of confinement.
Secondly, I must stress the importance of avoiding falling into the

trap of confusing physical effects with psychological effects. One often
hears of birds 4 4 pining away " in captivity, implying that loss of
freedom or the loss of a mate sets up a condition where the bird refuses
to eat due to a 44 deep melancholy In actual fact, the survival
instinct is so strong in virtually all birds that the so-called pining almost
invariably results from unsuitable feeding, unsuitable housing, disease,
or a combination of all three.
Example.
Some birds have the reputation of refusing food in captivity. These
species are usually specialized feeders, and do not recognize the
substitute foods offered. By the time they are willing to try a sub-
stitute, irreparable damage from starvation has already occurred.
Forcible feeding with the substitute until it is voluntarily accepted is
usually successful.
The Effects of Restricted Movement
(i) The Loss of Escape Routes.
Almost all birds have an instinctive fear of man, predatory mammals,
hawks, and snakes. Survival depends on these fears and the quickness
of the reactions to them. In its wild state, a bird is constantly reacting
to the presence of its hereditary enemies. Survival depends on an
immediate and maximal reaction to each stimulus. Thus a bird is
constantly on the look-out for enemies and almost always has a
preconceived plan of escape for any emergency that may arise. In the
case of man or animals, this usually means flying upwards and away ;
in the case of hawks--into cover and freezing.
Living as it does constantly on its guard against enemies, a bird is
well compensated psychologically. Fear is a normal reaction, and once
the cause is removed it is completely forgotten. Anxiety neurosis as a
result of living in a state of insecurity is unknown in birds ; or to put
it more simply, birds don't get ulcers.
When a bird is caged, it is automatically deprived of choice of escape
routes. This may result in the psychologically abnormal behaviour of
panicking. The cause is because when suddenly confronted with an
enemy, no satisfactory escape route (i.e. insufficient height or
insufficient distance) is available. The effect is that the bird, with its
normal escape instincts blocked loses its equilibrium between cause
and result and flies about wildly and uncontrolledly, often headlong
into the wire netting. From the point of view of the aviculturist,
panicking is very undesirable, but the dangers are physical, not mental.
Fatal injuries often result during panic, and prolonged panic may
result in complete exhaustion, even fainting. But provided physical
injuries are avoided, once the cause is removed and equilibrium is

<bodyText confidence="0.991001375" page_id="56311000"  page_num="11" year="" vol="">

restored, panic has no more permanent mental effects on a bird than
a normal fear reaction.
The wise aviculturist knows how to combat the effects of panic, and
it won't hurt to run over the main points here.
It is well known that birds soon come to tolerate human presence
when kept in small cages. This is because every escape route is blocked
by the nearness of the bars. The flying escape reaction soon becomes
sublimated, and when approached the bird merely runs up and down
the perch or hops from perch to perch. It will stop fluttering when
closely approached long before it loses its fear of man and approaches
him voluntarily.
Less well recognized are the effects of large, high aviaries and well-
planted garden aviaries. Here acceptable escape routes are provided
in terms of height, distance, or cover. Birds in such aviaries allow
closer approach than in small bare aviaries, and a much stronger
stimulus is required to start panicking. Where cost or other factors
preclude from building aviaries 8 feet or more high, a lot of panicking
can be avoided by providing an overhang behind which the birds can
hide. This will soon be accepted as an alternative escape route, and
the birds will be much steadier as a result.
In conclusion of this section, it must be stressed that birds which
have become thoroughly accustomed to, and lost all fear of, man,
will still panic when confronted with any powerful unusual stimulus.

Gaging a bird has the effect of reducing or eliminating the amount
of flying exercise it can take. In considering the psychological effects
of caging a bird it is important to avoid confusing physical deteriora-
tion due to lack of exercise, with mental damage, due to the inability
of the bird to give expression to its innate motor drives. Here again,
intelligence is what counts. Only some of the highest mentally developed
species possess the desire to fly for the sake of flying, in the way a frisky
horse gallops round his paddock, just for the sake of movement.

12 P. M. A. HARWOOD-BIRD PSYCHOLOGY AND AVICULTURE
I would say that any aviary large enough to allow its inmates
unrestricted flight allows them also to relieve their innate motor
drives. Psychological effects are only seen where highly intelligent
and active birds are kept in cages. Small finches, canaries, etc., suffer
little mental damage from caging, but cockatoos and parrots suffer i
greatly and can actually contract mental illnesses as a result of being
unable to fly.
In its mildest form, this type of mental upset makes the bird unable
to fly downwards. Progressively the bird becomes more reluctant to
fly at all, until it is psychologically incapable of making the decision
to take off when at liberty. More serious manifestations of mental
upset seen in caged parrots are : (a) weaving, bobbing, and screaming ;
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.924625545454545" page_id="56310999"  page_num="12" year="" vol="">
(b) feather plucking ; (c) self-mutilation.
None of these vices is seen in birds which have never been confined
in small cages, but most of them tend to persist even after the bird is &amp;apos;
given greater freedom.
Examples.
(&amp;lt; a ) An African Grey Parrot is crawling about on top of his cage
when he is suddenly startled and flies to the top of a tree. He spends
the rest of the day sitting there and screeching. Towards dusk he takes
off, but instead of flying down again, he disappears into the distance,
getting higher and higher.

feathers out of his breast, takes to chewing his foot, eventually biting
it off.
The Effects of Unrestricted Access to Food and Water and
Changed Feeding Habits
In the wild state, birds spend a considerable amount of time
collecting food. Each seed or insect is sought out separately. In
addition, wild birds, particularly finches, may travel considerable
distances daily to water.
In captivity, food and water are usually available at all times, and
the searching element is lost, particularly where in the interests of
hygiene birds are fed from dishes. Birds very rapidly lose the urge to
seek for food when it is readily available, even in the wild, so it is
reasonable to assume that there are no psychological ill-effects from
removing the necessity to search for food. Any surplus energy resulting
from the shortened feeding period can be used up in an aviary of
reasonable size, although in very small cages it is likely that restricted
feeding time contributes to the psychotic disturbances seen in parrots.
Physical ill-effects from unlimited food supply often occur in the
insectivorous species which are very liable to overeat in captivity.
More important to consider are the effects of change in feeding

habits. Some birds always feed at ground level, others at tree level,
yet others take their food on the wing. In every case a bird has to
adjust its feeding habits in captivity. In some cases, the instinctive
aversion to feeding on the ground or in an open space, or the lack of
instinct to search for food except at ground level may result in starva-
tion unless the aviculturist makes the necessary adjustment. In all
cases it is a wise precaution against the development of abnormal
behaviour to feed ground-feeding species at, or near, floor level, and
tree-feeding species some distance from the ground.
Example.
It is virtually impossible to break either hand-reared or wild-caught
White-tailed Black Cockatoos on to seed by offering food at floor level.
The difficulties encountered in getting this species to take seed is
greatly reduced when it is offered at some distance above the floor.
The Effects of Confinement on Breeding Behaviour
As in all aspects of bird psychology, the intelligence quotient bears
a direct ratio to the amount of abnormal breeding behaviour seen in
aviaries.
(i) Choice of Mate.
In the wild state, the selection of a mate is a matter of considerable
importance, and often takes place before puberty. One wonders when
one hears of this or that species which has been incited to commit
murder of an offending mate in an aviary how the observer would
react should he, by the whim of some Martian scientist intent on
studying the human race, become confined in a restricted space for an
indefinite period with an unattractive member of the opposite sex.
In fact, the remarkable thing about breeding psittacines by the
process of confining a male and female, usually adult, in the same
aviary is not the number of failures, but the number of successes.
Finches are far less discriminating in the selection of a breeding partner,
and it is also far more common for a choice of mates to be available.
Incompatible marriages are not at all uncommon in birds of the
parrot family, and account for a high percentage of breeding failures.
The value of a proven breeding pair is well known to all aviculturists,
and it is a well known fact that some pairs will produce progeny
under conditions of incredible adversity. Where there is a complete
harmony between the members of a pair, in fact where a true mating
can be said to have taken place, the entire reproductive cycle will be
adapted to the circumstances of aviary life, and provided a serious
attempt is made to study the needs of the parents breeding success
will follow. I feel quite certain that where a particular pair of birds
has earned a reputation for being prolific, a major part of their success
is due to matrimonial bliss.

(a) Abnormal aggression by one member of the pair towards
the other.
(b) A complete disinterest of the male in the female, which may
graduate into the stage where courtship displays are absent or rudi-
mentary and pairing does not occur.
(r) An abnormal fear of the female by the male, so that while he
may give normal courtship displays and feed the female, he does not
attempt to pair with her.
(d) Although normal pairing occurs, the male shows little or no
interest in feeding the female or progeny.
(e) The male actually interferes with the eggs or young.
(f) The female mutilates or plucks the young in the nest.
Examples.
(1) A female Indian Ring-neck attacks and kills the male.
(2) A pair of Barraband's Parrakeets fail to show the slightest interest
either in each other or in the nest-box, despite both being in perfect
condition.
(2) Selection of the Nest Site.

<bodyText confidence="0.972171615384615" page_id="56310997"  page_num="14" year="" vol="">
In the wild state, psittacine birds start investigating potential
nesting sites long before the onset of the actual breeding season.
During this phase of reproductive activity hundreds of sites, varying
from the possible to the wildly improbable, are inspected before a final
selection is made. There is no doubt at all that a thoroughly satis-
factory nest site is a powerful stimulus to further breeding activity.
Under aviary conditions, the nest sites made available often lack the
height and depth of those that would otherwise be selected. Un-
attractive nest sites frequently result in birds laying their eggs on the
ground or other unsuitable sites, with subsequent failure. In addition,
the risk of desertion of eggs or young is greatly enhanced when the nest
site does not give the birds the sense of security they require. In
general the main points to consider are :--
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.991565" page_id="56310997"  page_num="14" year="" vol="">
(. a ) Adequate height from the ground.
(b) An attractive opening facing away from the sun but not in too
dark a situation.
(e) The entry hole only large enough to allow the birds to enter.
(d) Nest site of sufficient depth to give a feeling of protection.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99677675" page_id="56310997"  page_num="14" year="" vol="">
In the case of finches, the selection of the nest site is also important.
In particular the risk of desertion is reduced if the nest sites offer
protection and, in the case of Gouldian finches in particular, are
rather dark.

(3) Selection of Nesting Materials.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.990015125" page_id="56310965"  page_num="15" year="" vol="">
The important business of nest-building in finches is aided by offering
nest-building materials which are attractive. White feathers are more
attractive than dark feathers, soft fine grass than coarse grass, etc.
It should also be borne in mind that many finches build sleeping
nests, and that nest-building activity is not entirely bound up in the
reproductive cycle. In some finches, the nest-building instinct is so
strong that if unlimited nesting material is available, new nests are
built, even during the reproductive phase, so that the eggs are built

(4) The Stimulating Effect of Other Birds of the Same Species.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.952852333333333" page_id="56310965"  page_num="15" year="" vol="">
With a number of the social species, the prime example being the
Budgerigar, the sight and even sound, of other birds of the same
species is a powerful stimulus to induce the onset of reproductive
activity. There are many reported cases of a single pair of Budgerigars,
although in good physical condition, making no attempt to reproduce.
On being placed within sight or sound of other Budgerigars, breeding
commences.
As a general guide to the avoidance of abnormal breeding behaviour,
the following procedures are recommended :--
(a) Where this is practicable, allow psittacine birds to select their
mates before the onset of puberty. Always be prepared to intervene in
cases where the partners appear incompatible.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.99591275" page_id="56310965"  page_num="15" year="" vol="">
(1 b) Provide a wide range of attractive nest sites.
(c) Provide attractive nesting material, but not in excessive
quantities.
(d) Keep gregarious birds in colonies, or within sight and sound
of others of the same species.
(e) Provide adequate and suitable food.
(f) Keep disturbances down to a minimum. Never inspect nests
unless you have a good reason for believing something has gone wrong,
otherwise you may induce in the parent a feeling of insecurity in an
otherwise satisfactory nest site.
Some other Sundry Effects Induced by Captivity
(1) Wire Netting.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.996306" page_id="56310965"  page_num="15" year="" vol="">
If a wild bird is confined in a wire netting aviary, it will continually
fly into the netting until it becomes exhausted or is injured, unless
very adequate cover is provided. The reason why wild birds attempt
to get through wire, whereas aviary birds only fly into the netting, in
moments of uncontrolled panic, is not because the former are anxiously
trying to regain their freedom. Birds have a fair ability to acquire
knowledge, and it does not take them long to learn that wire netting

is an impassable barrier. A wild bird is unable at first to realize
this, and treats the netting as it would a network of twigs--it attempts
to force its way through. By using small cages with only a small part
of the lower front wired in, wild-caught birds may be quickly educated
to accept wire-netting as impassable with a minimum of damage to
themselves. It is also worth mentioning at this point, that while birds
quickly learn that they cannot get out through wire, they also quickly
learn that it prevents the ingress of enemies. For this reason birds which
are habitually fed from the outside of the cage or aviary, and are very
steady and allow very close approach from the outside, are readily
induced to panic when a hand is put into the cage or a person enters
the aviary. I know of authentic instances where intelligent parrakeets
kept at partial liberty learn to associate the cage with protection from
foes. When confined, they pay scant attention to hawks and cats,
but treat the same creatures with extreme circumspection when at
liberty.
(2) Fear and Feeding
A curious sublimation of the escape reflex in many birds finds
expression in inducing feeding. Take a small finch out of an aviary
and put it in a small box cage. Although obviously worried, the
chances are that it will start husking seed immediately. This reaction
is of obvious value both with sick and with newly trapped birds.
Without any other treatment at all, sick birds stand a far greater
chance of recovery in a small cage where they are only moderately dis-
turbed, while the effects of the shock of capture are greatly lessened
in the same way.
(3) Roosting Behaviour.
Most finches normally roost in the heart of thick low bushes. They
have no instinctive aversion to entering dark places, and will normally
roost in the shelter provided. Most psittacine birds seek a high and
only partly protected roost (excluding those species which normally
roost in hollow trees).
Aviculturists often experience difficulty in inducing parrakeets to
roost in the shelter provided. This is because it usually entails the
bird having to enter a darker place and many shelters are lower than
the open part of the flight. Thus to enter the shelter the bird has to
overcome two instinctive aversions--it has to leave a lighter for a
darker place, and it has to leave a high for a lower perch. Birds can
be trained to do this, but this article is trying to stress the importance of
avoiding such measures because of the possibility of thereby influencing
the mental make-up of the bird. The answer is to have high roomy,
well-lit shelters with the roosting perch the highest available in the
aviary.

No animal can be classed as healthy unless all its processes, physical
and mental, function properly. Successful aviculture depends upon
healthy birds. By a full comprehension of the combination of
instinctive, acquired and reasoned reactions which make up the mental
processes of a bird, the aviculturist can then better understand how to
avoid those traumas or injuries to the nervous system which will
eventually lead to incomplete health.
Aviculture is more than putting birds in cages or aviaries, giving
them food and water and awaiting the results. It also entails a careful
study of all the needs of those birds and a careful training or adaptation
to the conditions that can be provided. One hopes for the day when
ornithologists will fully appreciate the value of aviary birds for detailed
studies in bird behaviour. This day can only come when, through a
full and complete study of his subject, the aviculturist can eliminate
those vices and abnormalities in behaviour which arise from conditions
from which no bird can adapt itself and still retain complete mental
and physical health.
Summary
Some aspects of the effects of confinement on the mental processes of
undomesticated birds are discussed.

COLLECTION AT BARDSDALE, CALIFORNIA
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.988596125" page_id="56310967"  page_num="17" year="" vol="">
By Sydney Porter (Derby, England)
In March, 1956, the late Mr. Francis H. Rudkin reached the ripe
old age of 95, and a month later he was with us no more.
In his obituary it was recorded that his death coincided with over
a hundred years of aviculture in the Rudkin family. The tradition
is still carried on by his son, Mr. Harold H. Rudkin.
Second and third generation aviculturists are rare, for the onerous
chores connected with bird keeping so often fall to the lot of the
unwilling boy who would sooner be out playing football than cleaning
out cages and aviaries. This in time develops into an anti-bird
complex on the part of the boy. However, I am sure no such thing
ever happened with the kind and amiable Mr. Rudkin, for his son
has one of the finest collections of psittacine birds to be seen anywhere.
Mr. Rudkin, senr., had a great zest for life, and was active with his
birds almost to the end. He was known far and wide not only as a
great aviculturist, but as a generous, sincere, and helpful friend.

1 8 S. PORTER-NOTES ON THE LATE MR. F. H. RUDKIN'S COLLECTION
Hardly a day passed but some one interested in birds dropped into
the ranch to see him. Mr. Rudkin must have been one of the Society's
earliest members, joining 56 years ago in 1902, when he lived in his
native Leicestershire before emigrating in 1912 to California, and
settling near Fillmore, about forty miles north of that now famous
suburb of Los Angeles, known as Hollywood.
Few townships have a more pleasant setting than Fillmore, situated
in the wide and fertile valley of the Santa Clara River amid vast
orange, lemon, and walnut orchards, and surrounded by high, green,
and picturesque mountains often snow covered in the winter. It
enjoys an almost perfect climate, and is ideally suited to the pursuit
of aviculture. It was here that the late Mr. Rudkin and his son had
their aviaries, and in 1948-49 during a stay in California, I had the
pleasure of meeting both father and son, and was hospitably enter-
tained by Mr. Harold Rudkin at his charming home near the centre
of the town.
When on a visit to that country in 1949, Mr. and Mrs. Harold
Rudkin persuaded me to come out again and make my home with
them during a prolonged visit in 1950-51. Only those who have
visited the glamorous " Golden West " for any length of time can
appreciate the great wealth of friendship, hospitality, and kindness
one meets out there.
One is used to superlatives in connection with many American
enterprises, and these are certainly applicable to the aviaries and their
inmates belonging to many Californian aviculturists, especially to
those of the late Mr. Rudkin, whose ranch was situated about a mile
or so out of Fillmore.
The main block consisted of a vast group of flights varying in size,
but mainly 14 feet by 16 feet, 14 feet by 6 feet, 14 feet by 3 feet, and all
10 feet high. In the main part there were about a hundred enclosures,
most of them being built around and opening into two large inner
flights. These were used to give the occupants of each aviary a few
days extra flying space and a chance to eat the growing green food,
the aviary door being left open and the birds finding their way out
and returning at will. In the course of time they all became used to
this arrangement. There was no trouble about catching the birds
to put them back in their own compartment again and nearly all
flew back there when one entered the large central aviary.
Mr. Rudkin, senr., lived on his own except that a friend tidied up
in the mornings and made the midday meal and someone provided
by his son helped for an hour or two a day with the birds. He never
felt he lived on his own, but rather that he was surrounded by friends
feathered and furred, for he had a faithful old Airedale and a number
of cats, which strangely enough never touched the birds.
Not content with looking after the birds he (during the season)

hatched in incubators and under hens vast numbers of turkeys,
pheasants, peafowl, and domestic poultry, a job which few men half
his age would care to tackle, as the eggs in the incubators had to be
turned at certain periods during the day and night.
Breeding lovebirds was one of Mr. Rudkin senr's specialities, and
it was a heartening sight to see, when the ranch was first visited, many
hundreds of these birds amongst which was not one hybrid. Great
pains were taken over the years not only to keep the stock pure, but
also free from poor or degenerate specimens.
The species represented were Nyasa, Fischer's, Peach-faced, Masked
green and blue. Black-cheeked and Abyssinian were kept and bred
for some years, but for some unknown reason gradually died out.
Perhaps these species are not so virile as the others.
The birds were kept and bred on the colony system, as it would
be quite impossible to give each pair a flight of its own.
The Peach-faced were the most numerous. Three pairs of these had
been obtained thirty-five years ago from Germany, as there were
none at that time in the U.S.A., and although no fresh blood had been
introduced, they were quite the largest and best examples of this
species I had ever seen. Of the lovebirds they were the most regular
and prolific breeders, producing three broods in a year. Mr. Rudkin
said that though he never counted them, he must have bred hundreds
in the course of a year.
The nest-boxes were fairly large, and bitten-up palm leaves were
used by the birds in the construction of their nests. Sometimes the
box was filled to capacity, while in other cases only meagre nests
were made, depending on the caprice of the individual pair.
The food of these, and also the other lovebirds, was canary, millet,
wheat, oats, and groats, and for green food an abundance of New
Zealand spinach.
Seven or eight pairs of the birds were kept in flights 16 feet by
6 feet and io feet high. There was no shelter to these, as this was
unnecessary owing to the mild climate, but part of the roof was
covered by wood, and this extended half-way down at the back to give
protection against driving winds which all, except sea-birds, hate.
As soon as the young could fend for themselves they were taken from
the aviary.
Six pairs of Nyasa Lovebirds were purchased over thirty years ago,
and none since added to the stock, yet the birds appeared to be fine
healthy specimens. However, these proved to be not such free
breeders as the others, but in spite of that many hundreds were
reared over the years, and distributed amongst other American
aviculturists. There must be few other people in the world to-day
who possess such a large, healthy, and pure stock of this species as
that at Fillmore.

Mr. Rudkin told me that some years ago he had sold some of the
birds to an amateur who later returned to say that the birds were
no good as they produced yellow young ones ! Now most aviculturists,
myself included, would have told the owner how sorry they were, and
have offered to exchange the pairs, but not so Mr. Rudkin, who told
him what a rare and wonderful thing it was for them to produce pure
lutinos, and offered to buy the parents and young back at an enhanced
price. No decision was reached, and the owner was never heard of
again. Since that day no single lutino ever appeared amongst all the
hundreds bred.
However, there was better luck with the Masked Lovebirds, of
which the original stock was only three. In spite of the inevitable
in-breeding the present stock are fine upstanding birds, this again is due
to all weakly or degenerate birds being removed. About twenty years
ago a blue young one was found in a nest with three greens. When
adult this bird, a male, was mated to a normal green female. These
eventually produced 25 per cent blue. Later a further blue appeared
in another nest, this time luckily a hen, and mated to the first blue
produced all blues. These were the source of the many thousands of
blue Masked Lovebirds in the U.S.A. to-day. These birds proved to
be better breeders than the normal Masked Lovebirds, and soon
numbers were distributed to aviculturists far and wide. Unfortunately,
it is quite a different story with these birds in Great Britain.
The blue Masked produced by Mr. Rudkin were fine, large birds
with the light areas a pure white. In Great Britain the birds soon
seem to degenerate, and become smaller with the colour less intense.
The price of these birds when I was first in California was $15 a
pair, at that time equal to 75 j.
Mr. Rudkin had a blue lovebird which was a great pet, it had been
born without wings, and had been hand-reared. It was quite without
fear, and had the run of the house with the Airedale, although it had a
cage in the living-room when it wished to retire there. The agility
with which this bird got about was amazing. If in its cage, of which
the door was always open, it wanted to get on to the dining-table, it
would gradually lever itself on to the floor, make for the dog, climbing
eventually on to its head, then on to Mr. Rudkin's knee, up the table-
cloth, and on to the table, where it always shared the breakfast, eating-
eggs, bacon, bread, and in fact anything in the food line. It was an
endearing little creature, and I wonder what has happened to it now.
Like the Nyasa, the Fischer's Lovebird did not seem as productive
as the other species, which is quite the reverse in Europe. This species
being the common and most easily raised lovebird and the most
frequently offered for sale.
The conditions under which some of the lovebirds are kept and
flourish in California would amaze the average British aviculturist.

At one place I saw vast numbers kept in large enclosed huts with
practically no light or ventilation, never cleaned out, the floor inches
deep in seed husks, droppings, and dead birds, yet the birds lived and
bred with the fecundity of mice. The secret of their survival being the
exceedingly dry atmosphere in which all moisture quickly evaporates,
the debris being soon reduced to dry dust in which bacteria cannot
exist.
Many people retire to California on modest incomes and look for
some hobby or pastime which will help them to eke out. Some take
up bird-breeding, knowing nothing whatever about it ; the sunny
climate is so conducive to fertility that often they are very successful, but
in time the supply exceeds the demand. This is especially applicable
to pheasants.
There is no doubt that the famous Californian sunshine is a great
factor in producing fine psittacine birds of all species and preventing
the degeneration which occurs in the more northernly lands. It
supplies something which no amount of stimulants or artificial foods
can substitute.

The Oxpeckers (Buphagus africanus and B. erythrorhynchus ).
Of all the birds I met with in South Africa, the Red-billed and the
Yellow-billed Oxpeckers stand out as the strangest. Supposed to be
allied to the Starlings, but singularly unlike them in looks and habits,
they are about as big as a medium-sized woodpecker and in demeanour
rather resemble those birds, insomuch as they use the bodies of the
large " Game " animals in the same way as a woodpecker does the
trunk of a tree.
Oxpeckers (Tick-birds, would be a much more appropriate name,
but this is applied without much justification to the Buff-backed
Egret) are more or less parasitic on the large herbivores such as
Antelopes, Giraffe, Rhinoceros, Buffalo, etc. ; living mainly on the
ticks which adhere to the hides of those animals. The movements of
the birds are strangely rapid and jerky, and the ease and speed with
which they move over the bodies of their hosts must be seen to be

believed ; sideways, forwards, backwards, all the time in a restless
effortless, and mechanical-like way.
The bird will just let itself drop off the head, say of a Giraffe, and
then automatically stick on again when it reaches the place it wants,
somewhere on the animal's body. It seems to do this without move-
ment of the wings or feet, or at least it gives that impression. I have
seen them run up the back legs of a Zebra, upside down along the
stomach, squeeze between the front legs, up on to the neck, over the
mouth and nostrils and finish up on the back in less time than it takes
to read this sentence. Every part of the host's body is gone over, and
no objection is made unless the bird puts its head into the animal's
ear. Sometimes a whole row of the birds will perch on the back of a
large mammal such as a Rhinoceros or up the neck of a Giraffe and
remain stiff and quiet for a long time ; at the slightest sign of danger,
however, they will fly into a tree and with loud harsh cries warn their
hosts of the impending peril. For this reason they were detested by
the old time . . . and the present day slaughterers of Africa's so-called
" Big Game ".
Oxpeckers, as their vernacular name implies, also give their atten-
tions to domestic cattle, or at least used to, which in keeping with the
wild animals seemed to appreciate their ministrations. But since the
compulsory dipping of cattle in South Africa and the use of arsenical
fluids, the birds have been largely exterminated over much of their
range and are not usually seen outside the Game Reserves, where of
course there are no cattle.
It is said that horses resent the activities of these birds and refuse
to allow them to perch on their bodies but donkeys on the other hand
apparently seem to enjoy being eaten alive by the Oxpeckers ! This,
I am sure, is not one of those fallacies such as the Kea eating sheep,
or eagles eating children, as it is vouched for by Captain Stevenson-
Hamilton, whose book, Wild Life in South Africa , is a masterpiece of
observation collected during a lifetime spent with wild animals.
On page 296 of the book he says, when speaking of these birds,
" Although they are certainly of benefit to cattle, and make no more
impression on their hides than they do on those of the wild ruminants,
it is otherwise with donkeys, to which they do more harm than good.
Not content with picking off the ticks, they proceed to enlarge the
little abrasion which the insect leaves behind it, until at last a yawning
cavity streaming with blood is formed . . .Not the least remarkable
point is that the donkeys habitually take no notice whatever of the
birds, however much they suffer, and make not the slightest effort to
get rid of them, being in this way quite different to horses, which will
not endure their presence for a minute. Therefore to keep donkeys
in good condition, where the tick birds abound, requires the most
constant watchfulness. In fact, at Sabi Bridge it has always been

necessary to employ a small boy whose sole duty consists in scaring
them from the donkeys, while at grass." However, that, no doubt, is a
thing of the past, for one sees very few donkeys in South Africa these days.
Whilst on the subject of birds eating mammals, the following episode
may be of some little amusement. In the days before I realized that
the quickest way to kill my birds was to send them to bird shows,
I used to take a good many to an exhibition held annually in
Nottingham and known as " The Foreign Bird Show ". It was to
support local charities and was held in one of the city's spacious
restaurants. Encountering at one of these shows an enthusiastic
reporter, I was asked if I could give any sensational details about a
pair of aviary-bred and rather flamboyant Occipital Blue Pies. I had
to admit that I couldn't, and in my innocence and general ignorance
of " news-hounds " I tried to explain about their habit of sometimes
harrying and mobbing large predatory mammals such as Tigers and
Leopards, thus warning off their prospective prey. Finally, unable to
stand the constant chivying of the birds, the carnivores moved away
from the immediate neighbourhood and took up residence elsewhere.
In the columns of one of the local evening papers appeared an article
headed " Birds at local show which kill and eat tigers " ! Since then
I have never given reporters any information on the habits of birds,
but it does seem true that Oxpeckers at least do eat donkeys !
In colour these birds are a uniform silky brown, yellowish on the
rump and lower breast, this more so in the Yellow-billed. Though
closely allied, the difference goes deeper than a matter of colour, in
fact the late Dr. Roberts, the well-known South African ornithologist,
gave each bird a different generic name.
Both species are very comical-looking birds, and remind one at
first sight of clowns. This is perhaps due to the fact that there is a
broad ring of bright yellow skin around the brilliant red eye (in
museum specimens this is hardly noticeable), and also to the fact that
in the one species, the sealing wax red bill is curiously rounded at the
end and is broader in the middle than at the base, which makes it
look like a bright red nose. The whole shape, stance, colouring, and
demeanour make it look more like a strange mechanical toy than a
bird, that is of course when seen in its natural habitat.
I once watched a flock of these birds on a herd of young Impalas,
perhaps one of Africa's most beautiful smaller antelopes. The reaction
of each individual animal to the birds was most interesting as it was
evident that they had only recently come in contact with the birds.
Some of the young buck declined to let the birds have anything to do
with them and violently refused to allow the birds to settle on their
bodies. Others took no notice whatever of the birds, and just let them
do what they wanted, and others turned their heads and affectionately
nuzzled them, as if welcoming old friends.

S. PORTER-NOTES ON BIRDS AT PRETORIOUSKOP
Sometimes the birds would almost disappear inside the animals' j
large ears ; at other times this inspection would be instantly and
furiously objected to. It was very amusing to watch the way the birds
slid up between the hind legs and lifted up the tail of the young 1
antelopes and looked underneath in their search for ticks. It was a !
strange sight to see the Oxpeckers clinging tightly on to the back of
the Impala as they galloped and sprang along through the Bush, for
their agility and ability to take flying leaps must be seen to be believed, j
The birds reminded one of budding jockeys going for their first
gallop, for the yellow ring round the eye, as well as giving them a j
comical look, also gives them a peculiar quizzical and frightened
appearance.
During the whole time I studied the birds I never saw one pass any
excrement while on an animal, and no matter how long I watched
them on the broad back of such a huge beast as a Rhinoceros did
I notice any trace of defecation. It is without doubt one of those
strange and wonderfully arranged associations between two very
dissimilar creatures assigned by Nature for the advantage of each
and about which we know so little.
The digestive juices of the Oxpeckers must be very powerful to be
able to dissolve the extremely tough and leathery skins of the detestable
ticks found in the tropics. It is practically impossible to kill them
if not fully gorged with blood, unless one puts them on the fire.
Though very seldom brought into this country two pairs of Oxpeckers
were, I think, imported at different times in 1954, and three Yellow-
billed were received by the London Zoo in 1955. A pair were shown
to me on arrival by their importer who got them from Natal, and who
called them " Blood Birds " as they were fed on nothing but liquid
blood. They were bought by an exhibitor who sent them round to
various shows, but they were never properly staged nor did they look
at ease. This pair I think eventually passed into the hands of a friend,
but one of them died shortly afterwards, due I suppose to their constitu-
tions being ruined by the initial diet of pure blood.
Exhibited in a large show-cage lined with padded ox-hide with the
hair left on, over which they could run about and feel at home, they
would have made a very attractive and rather sensational display.
Kept in an aviary with an indoor section partly covered with the
ox-hide, they would no doubt do well. They certainly never seem
very happy or comfortable on ordinary perches, any more than does
a woodpecker. They would need to be fed on chopped raw meat,
live insects, and a rich insectivorous food with the addition of perhaps,
a little blood, which would certainly put me off keeping them ; though
I suppose raw blood straight from an animal would be quite a different
substance to the digested fluid which was in a tick's body. The birds
must consume quite an amount of this during a day's feeding when one

thinks of the number of ticks they eat, most of which swell up from
the size of a round flat marrow seed to the size of a small cherry when
fully gorged with blood.
The thought of these repulsive insects makes one shiver ! Millias,
writing in his well-known book A Breath of the Veldt , says about the
birds, " To aid it in these forays after insects Nature has endowed the
rhinoceros bird with a tail of horny feathers for support and claws of
such extraordinary strength and sharpness that they can cling on
securely while performing acrobatics most amusing to witness. The
prehensile power of the claws is, as I have found out by experience, so
great that when a dead bird was thrown on to the back or sides of an
ox, so that the feet touched the animal's hide, the claws held fast at
once and could not easily be withdrawn."
The Buffalo Weaver (Textor erythrorhynchus ).
This bird gets its name from the habit of frequenting herds of
Buffaloes and perching on their backs in search of parasitical insects
which infest the hides of their hosts. But as this is only a side line as
it were, they do not have the highly specialized physical economy of the
Oxpeckers. This seems to be a strange habit for a weaver bird, but
then one gets surprised all the time by the seeming deviations from the
normal in the habits of animals.
This weaver is more omnivorous than most of the family, feeding
mainly on berries, fruit, and insects rather than seed, though this too
is eaten, when no doubt the former foods are not available. They
are most unweaverlike, nearly the size of the European Blackbird,
and similar in colour, but marked rather haphazardly with dirty
white, the male possessing a heavy red beak ; the female is a very
drab and rather nondescript-looking bird.
At the Skukuza camp in the Kruger Reserve are several large
trees, and in them are the huge nests of Buffalo Weavers, the largest of
all the weavers. The nests are extraordinary looking structures, the
smallest could be contained in an old-fashioned clothes basket, but the
largest are at least six times that size. Externally they are constructed of
twigs from the acacia thorns, about 12 to 24 inches long, and covered
with the most formidable spines of about 2 to 3 inches in length.
Quite how the birds break these off is a bit of a mystery, possibly
they find them on the ground under the trees, though one would
think they would be too brittle for weaving if the wood were dead.
Two or three pairs of birds share a single nest, but each has a
separate entrance to their chamber. Around the mouth of these
passages the twigs are very compactly woven. No doubt some other
type of material must be used for the lining of the nesting chamber.
Like most other weavers their lives are very public and noisy affairs,
the birds always very much in evidence, quarrelling, and generally

fussing around the nesting site. The male bird spends a great deal of
his time arranging and putting in place odd twigs that have become
loose, he works with amazing dexterity in handling and fitting the
thorn branches in place.
One would think that a nest which is a bristling mass of thorns
would be a very safe place and free from enemies, but this is not so,
for at the breeding season snakes, usually coral snakes, take up residence
in the nesting trees, actually living in the nests themselves and taking
a toll of about 50 per cent of the young birds. If the proportion gets
higher than this, the birds leave and set up a colony in another tree.
The young of these weavers are looked on as a delicacy by the
natives, and numbers are taken for eating, though how they get at
the birds is a mystery, as the nests appear almost impregnable.
On some of the trees containing the Buffalo Weavers' nests, were
immense colonies of the nests of Masked and allied weavers. These
were usually built on the very tips of slender branches, but I noticed
that often a dozen or so nests would be attached to the loose ends of
the twigs which composed the nests of the weavers under discussion.
These trees constituted veritable weaver cities, with many hundreds
of inhabitants. Consequently, they were the centre of a general
pandemonium, and the noise as the birds flew to and fro with material
for the nests, food for the young, displayed to sundry hens, quarrelled
and fought, was simply incredible.
The habits of most weavers, especially those of the Hyphantornis
group, are, during the breeding season, the very reverse to those of
most birds, which become shy and secretive during this period ; the
weavers then seem to be in a constant state of turmoil, extreme
volubility, and bustling activity. In one of the ranger's gardens at
Skukuza was a large bird bath which had a constant stream of visitors,
but no birds used it more than the Buffalo Weavers ; after one bath
each bird returned time and time again from a nearby branch until
it was absolutely soaked and could hardly fly.
The Cape and African Wagtails (Motacilla capensis and M. vidua).
South Africa possesses seven species of wagtails, but only two are
common, the others being locally distributed, or migrants from
Europe.
The commonest is the Cape Wagtail, a most charming and
endearing little bird, even tamer and more familiar than our own
Robin, which is to be seen about gardens, public parks, even streets,
and is known to everyone. In the hot weather they are to be seen
on the corrugated iron roofs which for some reason attract a great
number of flies ; here they have a wonderful time chasing after the
insects. Sometimes the birds run along the edges, now and then
peering underneath looking for spiders.

On the most remote and distant beaches seldom trodden by the
feet of man, on a busy railway station, running in and out of the
waiting rooms, between the railway trucks, or under the seats on the
platform, with waiting passengers on them, or in the city streets, these
engaging little birds can be seen always tame and friendly.
As well as the Cape Wagtail one also sees in the Kruger National
Park the African Pied Wagtail, a bird very little different from our
own European bird, but differing from its congener by being nearly
always found in the vicinity of water.
The Red-shouldered Whydah ( Coliuspasser axillaris).
The modern tendency to change birds 5 scientific names as often as
possible, thus rendering them of little use, has been extended of late
years to changing their vernacular names as well. The familiar
Green Singing Finch now becomes the Icterine Canary, the Yellow-
fronted Canary, the Yellow-eye, to mention only a few of its recently
designated names. On turning up the latest references to the well-
known Red-shouldered Whydah, I find that has become " the Fan-
tailed Widow Bird it seems that the prerogative of changing birds 5
vernacular names is no longer that of the bird dealers. This well-
known bird is a common and conspicuous inhabitant of the Low Veldt
in and around the Kruger Park, at least the males are, for search as
I would, I seldom saw a female during a stay of several months in the
Eastern Transvaal. These remain hidden in the dense marsh vegeta-
tion where the birds nest.
Like all the whydahs of the non-parasitic group, their plumage,
when seen in the birds 5 native haunts appears to be the most intense
velvety-black which makes a good background to show off the brilliant
red shoulder patches. All these whydahs have a strange nuptial
flight, which is basically a slow-motion display, each species 5 flight
differing slightly from the other. This bird has a slow, flopping
and meandering flight, exactly like that of a large tropical butterfly,
and by a newcomer to the district, might easily be taken for such ;
in fact it looks exactly like a giant " Red Admiral 55 . During this
flight the wings take on a peculiarly rounded appearance, and the
body feathers are puffed out until the bird looks almost twice its
normal size. This is, I think, accentuated by the intense blackness
of the plumage.
A company of these birds will take possession of a reedy vlei (small
patches of marshy ground found all over the Low Veldt), and there
they will construct their beautifully woven nests between the reed
stems, looking like miniature cradles hung upside down, the entrance
hole being underneath. The male takes up his stand on a reed or tall
grass stem, or sometimes on a wire fence, and when he sees a female
in the grass, he slowly sails up to her and hovers above like some

giant butterfly about to sip the nectar from a tropical blossom. If the
hen is on the ground itself, he will slowly circle round with the slow-
motion, flopping butterfly-like flight for quite a long time. It is
surprising how much larger he looks than his sombre-coloured spouse,
yet when he is out of colour he is the same size.
Following the course of a stream one comes across dozens of male
birds, each seeming to have his own special area, and attacking all
other males who intrude. Yet I have found that in an aviary this is
one of the most pacific of the whydahs. A few years ago I thought
how attractive a whydah aviary would be with all the males in full
colour, but I had to learn that with the exception of the Red-
shouldered it was next to impossible to keep two males of the same
species together when in nuptial plumage. The worst offenders are
the Red-collared (C. ardens) who not only fight their own species
but all other kinds of whydahs. This bird is also seen in the Kruger
Park, but only sparingly, and in quite different districts to the Red-
shouldered. It is seen amongst the tall reeds by the wide rivers and
pools, usually singly, and in breeding plumage is wild and difficult
to approach.
Some Boer farmers with whom I stayed for a time on the borders of
Portuguese East Africa used to shoot hundreds of whydahs and
weavers when they flocked in the non-breeding season and, after
baking them in a large oven, got the natives to pull their heads off
and pluck them, when they would be served up at a meal and eaten
whole. Needless to say, I never partook of the repast.
Both forms of the Paradise Whydah are to be seen in the Park,
the Broad-tailed and the Narrow-tailed (Steganura aucupun obtusa and
S. paradisea). They inhabit entirely different districts to the two
former ones, usually away from water on the dry acacia thorn
savannah where they can usually be seen feeding on the ground with
their long tails trailing after them. It is a wonderful provision of
Nature, or perhaps one should say evolution, that the bird is able to
keep its tail, which is not at all stiff and at least three or four times
as long as its body, right off the ground. This is accomplished by the
fact that it is slightly curved and balanced in such a way that only
the tips almost touch the earth.
The South Africa sub-species is a much larger and finer bird than
the well-known and frequently imported West African one. This was
known in the old days as the Yellow-naped or Verreaux's Whydah.
Like the rest of the Viduine Whydahs, this is parasitic, and as far as
is known its host is the Melba Finch. Several aviculturists in South
Africa who have had these waxbills nesting in the same aviary as the
Whydahs, have been lucky enough to rear both species in the one nest.
Another of the whydahs which brought back nostalgic memories
was the Pin-tailed (V. macroura), also an inhabitant of the dry veldt.

This species is perhaps the best known of all from its habit of
frequenting the gardens and yards around the farmsteads, especially
around the mealie sheds where he and his small flock of sombrely
coloured wives feed on the mealie meal which is the standard ration
for the native farm workers. It is also a familiar object on the wire
fences and telegraph wires by the roadsides.
The male's nuptial flight is higher than most of the whydahs except
the Giant. Besides making these high flights and dashing down to
earth like a meteor, he has a peculiar way of hanging in the air with
slowly beating wings, meanwhile jerking his body forwards as though
he were trying to use his long narrow tail as a switch. During this
time the five long tail feathers are widely separated.
The Pin-tailed Whydah is supposed to be parasitic on the smaller
waxbills, but I noticed that there was a very close association between
these birds and the Bronze-winged Mannikin (Spermestes cucullalus)
which like the whydahs are very commonly found around human
habitations. I rather think it might be found they are parasitic on
these birds.
The Bronze-winged Mannikin (Spermestes cucullalus).
This is an old favourite from childhood days, when one was able
to buy a pair for 2s. 6 d. It is a generally well known and endearing
little bird, very common over the dry bush veldt, but found most
prolifically around the farmstead and native huts and, when the
conditions are suitable, it is even more familiar and confiding than
the English Sparrow.
It has the habit of flying on to the tall fragile heads of flowering-
grasses and bearing them to the ground, where it feeds on the green
seeds. It can often be seen nipping off the soft downy heads of these
grasses and flying with them trailing behind into the thorn trees,
where it builds colonies of snug little rounded nests, with the hole at
one side, warmly lined with downy flowering grass heads.
The Sparrow-weaver (Plocepasser mahali).
This is a little noticed weaver because of its unobtrusive plumage
which rather resembles a clean edition of a female English Sparrow
with a conspicuous white eye streak. The birds live on the dry acacia
veldt and feed on the seeds of tall grasses which grow from five to
eight feet high. These seeds are one of the great discomforts of the
veldt, as they are needle-sharp at the ends, and penetrate one's clothes,
working their way in, until finally they get into one's flesh.
As single grass stems are not capable of supporting one of these
birds, they gather four or five stems together which are held by the
feet while the birds feed on the seeds. It is rather a strange sight to
see a flock of these birds each feeding on an arch of grasses.

S. PORTER-NOTES ON BIRDS AT PRETORIOUSKOP
Barbets.
When staying at Pretoriouskop one frequently heard a very loud
ringing and metallic " tong-tong " uttered over long periods and,
like some bird calls which are ventriloquial, difficult to locate. Usually
it was heard in the vicinity of thick trees or heavy bush. This was
in due time traced to the Red-fronted Tinker Barbet (.Barbatula pusilla)
one of the most beautiful of the smaller African birds, a diminutive
barbet about 4 inches in length. It is not much larger than a waxbill,
and is a most beautiful pale green below, with a red forehead band
and the upper parts a mixture of spots and stripes and a galaxy of
black, white, brown, sulphur-yellow, gold, etc.
Its call is quite out of proportion to its size, and can be heard for
at least half a mile on the open veldt. When once located one finds the
birds not at all shy, and one can watch them creeping about the
thick foliage of the trees in search of small berries on which they seem
to feed almost exclusively ; usually these are so large that the bird
finds a difficulty in swallowing them.
Though a good many species of these miniature barbets are known,
very few have ever been imported into this country. They
would make most desirable candidates for aviculture. Some years
ago there were some in the Small Bird House at the London Zoo
which appeared quite long-lived, besides being tame and intelligent,
and remained, all the time I saw them, in the most immaculate
plumage. It is necessary to give them a small hollow log or sleeping
box with a very tiny entrance hole, for they not only roost but spend
quite long periods during the day in it. The demeanour of these
little birds is quite different to that of their larger relatives.
Two of the ordinary barbets were to be seen on the wooded kopjes
or around the fruit gardens, the well-known Black-collared Barbet
(.Lybius torquatus ), a very much larger bird than the previously mentioned
bird, and one which is frequently imported into Great Britain. This
utters many resounding calls as it sits in the thick trees or feeds upon
the berries and fruit of the many species of veldt trees.
I became quite friendly with one of these birds when I used to go
and read or sunbathe on a certain kopje. Whenever I went the bird
was in a small berry-bearing shrub, and we had quite a mutual
interest in each other. The berries from this bush on which the bird
used to feed were, at least to me, woody and unripe, with a horrible
astringent taste.
The friendly barbet was possibly a young bird as its plumage had
not assumed the bright colours of the adult, and it was as yet un-
acquainted with the wicked ways of the human world where in
Africa, as in this country, half the children are armed with catapults
or shot guns out to kill or wound any living thing within sight. In
fact in Africa they are encouraged to do so by their parents.

Another common barbet in the Kruger National Park is the
Levaillant's (Trachyphonus cafer ), a very strikingly coloured bird in a
garb of sharply contrasting orange, black, white, red, yellow, etc. ;
with an upstanding crest on the middle of the head. This is quite
common in the Eastern Transvaal, where there is wooded country,
and is seen about the homestead and farm gardens, especially where
fruit is grown. Its loud ringing cries are much more frequently heard
than the bird is seen, as it keeps more or less to the thick foliage, as
though conscious of its brilliant coloration, and it moves about the
trees with a quiet and woodpecker-like demeanour.
In the early mornings it can often be seen drying or sunning itself
on the outside of the foliage. At one place I stayed near Johannes-
burg, there was a tennis court, and owing to presence of white ants
it was impossible to use wood for the net posts ; these were of iron
with an inside diameter of one inch. Into one of these came every
night a Levaillant's Barbet to roost, and each evening this bird,
the size of a starling, managed to work its way down to the bottom
of the post or hollow pipe, a distance of about 3 feet, sleep the night,
turn round and come up head first in the morning. I saw this done
every day for about two months or so, and even now I can't imagine
how the barbet did it. Whilst in Natal I met someone who had bred
this species, and I saw the parents and the young ones.

death of Mr. Sydney Porter on 9th January, 1958. An Obituary

Vinaceous Amazon, from Brazil, both now seldom seen in captivity.
The Quaker Parrakeets bred for the first time.
In my Los Angeles garden, a number of finches and doves have
been reared. Five pairs of Gouldians in a small aviary by themselves,
produced about forty young ; a pair of Bartlett's Doves, seven, and
a pair of Red Mountain Doves, nine. There were some young
Mountain Witches, Martinique Ruddies, Brush Bronze-wings, etc.
Grey-headed Doves ( G . caniceps) are nesting.
Lately a number of beautiful Tanagers and Sugar-birds have
arrived by air, in excellent condition, from Colombia and Costa
Rica. They all settled down outdoors very quickly despite our cool
winter nights. There is a particularly lovely pair of Red-thighed
Sugar-birds ( Dacnis venusta ), a beautiful and rare species seldom
seen in aviaries ; the male is black and brilliant blue, with scarlet
thighs, the female grey, blue, and green. The small Tanagers consist
of various Euphonias, Chlorophonias, and of the following species of
Callistes : chrysophrys , aurulenta, icterocephala, xanthocephala , parzudakii ,
nigro-cincta , ruficervi, gyrola, nigroviridis . I have now no difficulty in
keeping these birds in large, planted aviaries, among other birds.
I find that they do well as long as whole bananas are kept away from
them. They feed perfectly on pear, apple, grapes, and soaked raisins,
orange, and a mixture of banana and sponge cake crushed to a pulp ;
they also eat lettuce, hard-boiled egg and cake well mixed together,
and to my surprise, they pick up a good many seeds : millet, canary,
and cracked maize. Once established, they live for years. I also
have some very nice Amazonian Blue Tanagers ( Thraupis cana coelestis ),
far the prettiest of the sub-species, with vivid blue on the head and
wings, the latter boldly marked with white.
There are many aviculturists in the Los Angeles area : a multitude
of amateurs and quite a number of professionals who make a living
by the breeding of various parrots and parrakeets, doves, finches,
quails, pheasants, and waterfowl. The climate, free from rigorous
winter temperatures and of oppressive summer heat, is no doubt the
reason of their success, and the general use of houses set in small
gardens also helps to spread the hobby. But so far, we have had no
proper zoo, and those who wanted to visit a good one have had to go
to San Diego, 120 miles to the south. This unfortunate state of affairs
is luckily coming to an end. A Society, " The Friends of the Los
Angeles Zoo," has recently been organized under the presidency of
Mr. Maurice Machris and my Executive Vice-Presidency. We are
now negotiating a contract with the city, and the prospect is that,
within a few years, Los Angeles will have what we hope will be the
finest zoo in the world. Animals and birds will be displayed in very
large, barless enclosures, under near-natural conditions, surrounded
by the actual vegetation of their country of origin. The climate

their young. Whether they have been long in captivity I do not
know, but they are quite tame. This race is confined to Madeira ;
there is another (C. t. bollii) inhabiting the Canary Islands.
From the Parque Zoologico at Jerez de la Frontera two White
Storks, a Griffon Vulture, an Egyptian Vulture, two Marbled Teal,
and two African Cattle Egrets have been received in exchange.
One Black-footed Penguin has been hatched, and several eggs are
being incubated. The Cereopsis Geese are nesting.
The Grey-necked Picathartes collected in British Cameroons by
Mr. Webb during 1948 has died. Its age was not known, for it may
have been an adult bird at the time of its capture, but during the past
two years it has appeared to become short-sighted and, perhaps for
that reason, less active than formerly.

Members of the Club, 39 ; guests, 24 ; total, 63.
Before dining, at the request of the Chairman, members and guests
stood in silence for a few moments as a mark of respect to the memory
of Sydney Porter, a Founder Member, who died on 9th January.
The Chairman welcomed Dr. J. M. Winterbottom, Hon. Secretary
of the South African Ornithological Society, and Mrs. Winterbottom ;
and then introduced Walter Higham who, of course, really needed no
introduction as he is almost an institution with the Club, having shown
films on numerous previous occasions. Members were privileged to
see the premiere of " Highlights from my Nature Films ".
This film is the story of Higham's experiences as a nature photo-
grapher during the past thirty years. The film starts with monochrome
pictures of the days before the arrival of colour, and we see collecting
Guillemot eggs, in which the photographer demonstrates how it
should not be done ; and the Cuckoo actually laying its egg in a
Pipit's nest, and later, the newly hatched young Cuckoo ejecting eggs
and young from the nest.
With the advent of colour we are shown a Lapwing that is practic-
ally white ; a Water Rail carrying its chick ; a Black-throated Diver
killing the chick of a breeding pair, and finally the marauder being
driven away by the parents ; a Bittern eating its dead chick ; the
Golden Eagle at the nest. Some sequences have been chosen for their
beauty and include a close-up of the Kingfisher ; a Sheld-duck
feeding at a fresh-water pool amongst the sand dunes ; a number
of flying sequences.
In a visit to Hungary the Purple Heron, Little Bittern, and Avocet
are shown at the nest, whilst the nesting Spoonbills and White Storks
are pictured both with their young and in the air.

France is visited to see some of the breeding birds of the Camargue.
The highlight of this part of the film is undoubtedly the unique,
first cine-film record of the breeding Flamingos, which shows the
birds at close quarters, both on the ground and on the wing. We also
visit the Broads and see the Monatgu's Harrier ; the Fame Islands
with its Puffins, Arctic Terns and breeding seals ; and the Bass
Rock and the Gannets.
This film represents the life work of one of Britain's best known
natural history photographers. Members who failed to attend this
meeting missed seeing a really outstanding and entertaining film.
The next meeting of the Club is on Monday, 10th March, 1958 .

have just returned from a journey to the most uncivilized natives of
Dutch New Guinea, people not under government control. They are
still eager head-hunters and cannibals. In every hut there were
plenty of human skulls. All the men went completely naked, the
married women had a grass girdle, and the unmarried had nothing on.
The men use stone axes and they have knives of human bone (femur).
In the necklaces of both men and women I often saw human vertebrae,
especially from the neck (atlas)."

Parrot Finches must surely be amongst the very nicest birds that an
aviculturist can breed. Unfortunately, there are now but few in
captivity, but the few are in the hands of enthusiasts determined to
build up precious stocks. The most successful breeder in the annals
of aviculture is undoubtedly N. Nicholson, who this last season had
young Red-headed reared to the twenty-fifth generation ! Nicholson
has never had recourse to in-breeding, with the result that his strain
has improved with the years, the increase in size being an outstanding
feature. He is just as enthusiastic as ever, but stresses that but for the
understanding and encouragement given by his wife during the very
difficult war years, it is possible he might have lost the enthusiasm to
carry on. Another very successful breeder is C. af Enehjelm, of
Helsingfors. This past year he has bred sixteen Three-coloured, and
now has about thirty in all.

Members will be interested to hear how C. S. Webb and his wife
are faring. In a recent letter from Naro Moru, Kenya, " Webbie "
writes : " We are situated in a delightful spot at 7,000 feet on the
lower slopes of Mt. Kenya. Bird-life is varied and plentiful and we
have the advantage of being adjacent to mountain forests, open plains,
and the low scrub country which stretches up to the Abyssinian
border. On our own property we see daily such interesting things
as Giant Kingfishers, Hartlaub's Touracos, Silvery-cheeked and
Crowned Hornbills, Olive Pigeons, etc., to mention just a few of the
larger birds ; and on the plains nearby are Giant, Jackson's, and
Crimson-naped Whydahs, Crowned Cranes, and Ground Hornbills.
It is hard to think of an English winter when here we enjoy home-
grown fresh vegetables of every sort all the year round and, of course,
flowers galore. When the larder is low I have only to walk about
20 yards to our own delightful trout stream."

anxious waiting, I found egg-shells on the floor of the flight--but,
alas, upon investigation after a few days, there was no trace of any
young. Rock Pebblers laid three eggs, hatched two, reared one.
Barrabands were again successful and reared three lovely youngsters,
a fourth being lost when about ten days old. Two pairs of Bourkes
produced eleven excellent young, whilst a third pair deserted their

produced, and that died after a few days. Egg-binding lost us a very
good Splendid, since replaced. Stanleys were not given a nest-box
as they were considered too young ; Elegants and Turquoisines were
also young birds, and on these our hopes centre for next season.

Breeding Button Quail in California
My two pairs of Button Quail successfully reared more than seventy young between
them in 1957. The first clutches of eggs were laid in February, and the sixth clutches
hatched in September and October. The smallest number raised from one clutch
of eggs was four birds, and the largest was twelve.
The birds were, of course, kept in separate cages, but about six pairs of finches
were with them. In addition to canary seed, large white, and small yellow millet,
they always had available poppy or maw seed mixed with turkey starter (a high
protein mash for starting turkey chicks and pheasants). They were given some
fresh greens daily, but no mealworms or other live food was provided during the
entire year. A few chicks were lost but, as already stated, over seventy were reared.
In all cases the parent birds did all the rearing. The birds were given a large handful
of Bermuda grass or devil grass, placed on the sand floor of the shelter (no doors are
necessary in the shelters in Southern California), with a branch of evergreen conifer
in front of it to provide some privacy.
Normally, I try to limit the clutch of these birds to seven or nine eggs. During
the hottest part of our summer one of the hens laid some more eggs after I thought
she had started to sit ; she laid twelve eggs and raised the lot. She was not able
completely to cover all these eggs, and I am certain that the only reason they hatched
was the extremely high day and night temperatures that we were having during
this time. The young birds were left with their parents for about four or five weeks
(until the cock bird started fighting them).

BREEDING OF THE HILL MYNAH--A CORRECTION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996388875" page_id="56310988"  page_num="38" year="" vol="">
I am indebted to Mr. H. A. Fooks for pointing out to me that the parents of the
young Hill Mynah or Grackle we have recently bred here at the Keston Foreign
Bird Farm are not, as originally stated, the Southern Grackle E. religiosa, but the
Northern one, commonly known as the Indian Grackle, E. javana intermedia.
It is true that there is not a lot of difference between them, but, as it is a first
breeding, I think it is important that it should be got right. E. j. intermedia is a rather
larger bird than E. religiosa , and has a greater wattle development beneath the
eye and less on the nape.

The reasons we supposed that our birds were Southern Grackles were because
they were invoiced to us from India as E. religiosa, and also because both Aviculture,
vol. i, and Whistler's Popular Handbook of Indian Birds, state that religiosa is the most
frequently imported species and the Mynah of the Indian bird shops.
Mr. Fooks, however, who has an unrivalled first-hand knowledge of Indian birds,
tells me that this is quite incorrect, as by far the most frequently imported is the
Indian Grackle E. j. intermedia.
The information about the various Indian Hill Mynahs he gave me in his last
letter seems to me of such interest that I propose to quote it at the end of this letter.
Before doing so, however, I would like to mention a rather interesting fact that
I forgot to put in the breeding account--namely that both the male and female
of our pair of Mynahs took turns at incubating the eggs. Also that, judging by our
pair, there is a further way of sexing these birds : Immediately above the cock's
eye is a small area of bright greenish-yellow skin which is visible through its rather
sparse covering of tiny bristly black feathers, while the same area in the hen consists
entirely of smooth black feathers. This difference has remained constant after each
moult.
After saying in his letter to me that he had had, of course, to go entirely by the
photos (illustrating my article), Mr. Fooks went on to say that if our birds came
from Calcutta they " would in 999 cases out of a 1,000 be E. javana intermedia --the
Indian Grackle. If from Bombay, E. religiosa. The latter do not come further north
than North Kanara and the Northern Circars, where I have myself seen them. In
Ceylon, of course, they are the Grackle of the country. E. javana intermedia comes
from the Himalayas, and is common in Orissa (where the majority of exported birds
come from) its range then extends through Burma, Siam, to Cochin China--a huge
range and very common in suitable forests. The Southern Grackle is definitely smaller
than the Indian, and its bill is more or less one colour, whereas the Indian one pales
towards the tip. Almost all Grackles I've seen in England were E. javana intermedia.
I've only seen half a dozen E. religiosa and only about as many E. javana javana, which
is a very large bird compared to the others. Measurements are about : E.j. i. 300
to 310 mm., E. r. 250 mm., E.j.j . 390 mm. (total length).
If your exporter ships from Colombo, Madras, or Bombay, you are probably
right.
I looked up my Fauna of B.I., by Stuart Baker, and in vol. iii find that he confirms
that the Indian Grackle is the cage bird of India.
It doesn't really matter what your pair are, except as a first breeding in England,
I think we should be quite certain.
When I used to watch them in their wild state I noticed they were quite carnivorous.
I've seen them eat Geckos ! "
I was interested in Mr. Fook's statement that these birds would eat Geckos, and
can quite imagine that they would eat anything in the way of a lizard or mouse
that they could catch, particularly as a pair of Shamas we had at liberty at Keston
before the war were great mousers--although, of course, only capturing very small
ones.

CHOUGHS IN CAPTIVITY

I read the article by Mr. S. Porter relating to Choughs in the September-October
number of the Avicultural Magazine in which, on page 167, he refers to Choughs'
alleged eating of grain. In point of fact I did not know that there was any feeling
in this direction, so my statement now is in no sense born of prejudice. I am familiar
with the birds wild in Wales, and also keep captive specimens myself. I have never
seen any evidence of grain-eating by wild birds, but my captive specimens will
certainly eat wheat. This I've seen frequently, as at one time the Choughs shared
an aviary with Golden Pheasants. Whether this habit extends to birds at liberty
I rather doubt, but it is by no means impossible. With regard to Mr. Porter's
remarks on the paucity of literature on captive Choughs, this I feel is largely due to
the fact that Choughs are strictly protected by law, and since to the best of my
knowledge, they are seldom imported, it might be difficult for most aviculturists

to explain away their possession of these birds. Unless " close-ringed " such birds
are never likely to appear on sale publicly. My birds have attempted to breed, but
so far with no success, as they have never got further than a completed nest. I have j
prepared notes on the behaviour of Choughs which have been in the hands of the
Editors of British Birds for months, and notes on Ravens which they have had for
two years, still awaiting publication. My experience also extends to Choughs killing |
passerines which had access to their aviary, crossed bills, and odd aspects of behaviour. \
Unfortunately it is difficult to make known odd bits of information in the press, i
and a comprehensive paper needs years of study in preparation, since experience )
of necessity takes a long time to acquire.
I am always interested to hear of aviculturists' experiences with these fascinating j
birds, as this might help to collect and make it possible to collate experience gained j
by what I believe to be only a comparatively small number of people interested in
attempting to breed Choughs.

COMMON NAMES FOR RARE BIRDS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989196916666667" page_id="56310990"  page_num="40" year="" vol="">
The Editor asks why it is necessary to give common names to rare birds not already
possessing them. Why is it necessary to give common names at all ?
The existing ones must surely have been " invented " by someone at some time,
and their use can hardly cause confusion in other languages when the scientific
name accompanies them as it does in the Notes. It is the scientific name that is
internationally understood ; the vernacular name will naturally be different in
each country, and is not necessarily a translation of the English one.
At what point in rarity is the line to be drawn ?
Some modern authors of ornithological works give English names to species, but
not to sub-species. Bannerman in his great work on the birds of tropical West Africa
gives an English name to both species and sub-species, rare and common. I can
see no harm in this provided that the scientific name is also given.

The Medal may be awarded at the discretion of the Council to any
Member who shall succeed in breeding, in the United Kingdom, any species of
bird which shall not, in the opinion of the Council, be known to have been
previously bred in captivity in Great Britain or Northern Ireland. Any Member
wishing to obtain the Medal must send a detailed account for publication in the
Magazine within about eight weeks from the date of hatching of the young, and
furnish such evidence of the facts as the Council may require. The Medal will
be awarded only in cases where the young shall live to be old enough to feed
themselves, and to be wholly independent of their parents. The question of
awarding a Medal for the breeding of local races or sub-species of species that
have already been bred shall be at the discretion of the Council. No Medal can
be given for the breeding of hybrids.
The account of the breeding must be reasonably full so as to afford
instruction to our Members, and must appear in the Avicultural Magazine
before it is published or notified elsewhere. It should describe the plumage of
the young, and be of value as a permanent record of the nesting and general habits of the
species. These points will have great weight when the question of awarding the
Medal is under consideration.
In every case the decision of the Council shall be final.
The Medal will be forwarded to each Member as soon after it shall have
been awarded as possible.
The Medal is struck in bronze (but the Council reserve the right to issue
it in silver in very special cases) and measures inches in diameter. It bears on
the obverse a representation of two birds with a nest containing eggs, and the
words 64 The Avicultural Society--founded 1894 ". On the reverse is the following

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98444865625" page_id="56311077"  page_num="41" year="" vol="">
By Derek Goodwin (London, England)
The genus Garrulus --the typical jays--consists only of three species :
our " Common 55 Jay which is found, in various races which differ
a good deal in size and colouration, in suitable places throughout the
palearctic regions from Ireland to Japan, the striking Purple Jay,
Garrulus lidthi , of the Loo Choo Islands, and the present species,
Garrulus lanceolatus, which is confined to the western Himalayan regions.
Among a group of birds so beautiful in colour and so attractive in
their graceful forms and sprightly movements, it would be invidious
to make comparisons, but a glance at the coloured plate will show
that this species can compare with any of its relatives. To my mind
it is the most lovely of them all, but that is merely a personal bias
and no reflection on either glandarius or lidthi.
So far as one can glean from books on Indian birds, in which it is
usually given the most misleading vernacular name of Black-throated
Jay (in the living bird the throat appears more white than black, even
when the black-based, white-tipped, lanceolate throat feathers are
erected), the habits and ecology of this bird are very similar to those
of our own Jay. Since, however, both species occur together in parts
of north-west India, it seems unlikely that their requirements in the
wild can be identical, even though in captivity they will both thrive
under the same regime. The Lanceolated Jay frequents open forests
and scrub-covered hillsides where there are scattered trees and human
dwellings (Ali, 1949). The nest which is built of twigs lined with
roots and fibres, like that of our Jay except that grass stems are some-
times incorporated in it, is placed usually in a small tree standing
alone or with others in comparatively open country (Stuart Baker,
1932). It is said never to nest in conifers--even where these are in
a majority--or in dense forest. This may well be the case, but I think
there is room for doubt until such time as someone makes a thorough
study of the species in the wild. It may be the same as with our own
Jay. This latter also often nests conspicuously near the tops of

saplings, but it equally often builds well hidden in conifers, honey-
suckle or rhododendron, as becomes apparent if one takes an area
of woodland and searches it yard by yard to find every Jay's nest
therein. If, however, one merely seeks to find the greatest number of
Jays' nests in a given time, then, of course, one finds far more of the
conspicuous sapling nests.
Beyond the fact that it takes acorns, fruit, insects, and scraps of
human food from around houses, little has been recorded of the
Lanceolated Jay's feeding habits. In captivity its food preferences
are similar to those of our Jay (Goodwin, 1953). It has exactly the
same habit of burying and hiding acorns and other food, and it is
probable that in a wild state in winter it subsists largely on acorns
buried the previous autumn, as does our Jay. I have enthused in
previous articles on its attractiveness as an aviary bird, so will not
touch further on the subject except to say that few species can be
more recommended for a large, garden aviary. It is hardy (though
like other corvids liable to gape-worm infestation from which, how-
ever, some individuals seem immune), easily fed, lively, and beautiful.
Its only drawbacks are that it is as destructive to eggs and nestlings
as most captive corvids, though I have kept it with adult Barbary
Doves without the latter receiving any harm. In the early Spring of
1957, I liberated a pair, hoping that they would stay in the neighbour-
hood and enable me to study them at liberty. This they did not do,
but one of them survived for a further nine months until--some thirty
miles away--it was shot by a sportsman. The fate of most tame or
conspicuous birds that are allowed full liberty.

FLIGHTLESS MOORHENS {PORPHYRIORNIS C.
COMERI ) FROM GOUGH ISLAND BREED IN
CAPTIVITY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.952392076923077" page_id="56311079"  page_num="43" year="" vol="">
By A. E. Wilson and M. K. Swales (Cambridge University Depart-
ment of Zoology ; Field Station for the Study of Animal Behaviour,
Madingley. (Cambridge, England)
Flightless Moorhens (Porphyriornis c. comeri ) have recently been
bred for the first time in captivity. These birds, which occur only on
Gough Island in the South Atlantic, somewhat resemble British
Moorhens in appearance. Several live pairs of them were brought
back to this country in May, 1956, by the Gough Island Scientific
Survey in the hope that they would breed, because the eggs of the
species had never previously been seen. The species is extremely
shy and secretive in the wild state, and all attempts to find nests
containing eggs on Gough Island had failed.
One pair of those brought back to this country was sent to Madingley
where it was thought it would stand the best possible chance of
breeding in captivity. This particular pair had already been in
captivity about nine months by the time it reached Madingley, and
had already become remarkably tame. This in itself was interesting
in view of the bird's shyness in the wild. The two birds were kept in
an aviary measuring 8 feet by 20 feet by 8 feet, in which was plenty
of cover, made by sandwiching spruce and box leaves between wire
netting.
The birds were fed on an insectile mixture, supplemented with
boiled rice or boiled potatoes mixed with meat gravy. Mealworms
and gentles were also offered each day together with green food
(chickweed and lettuce).
In March, 1957, they started nest-building. The first nest was
built on the ground ; but this site was soon abandoned in favour of
one 2 ft. 6 in. above the ground. The two birds made a cup-shaped
nest measuring about seven inches in diameter and composed of straw
and dried grass. During building the female, while standing near the
nest site, would call to the male with a loud " krak-krrak ". The male
immediately searched for nesting material and, picking up two or
three straws, would run to the female. She would then back away
into cover, bowing to the male and appearing to indicate where the
material was to be placed. The male would then leave to collect
more material. If the male's attention was distracted (e.g. by meal-
worms being placed in the aviary) the female would become impatient
and call to the male more vigorously.
Copulation was observed on several occasions. When mealworms

or gentles were placed in the aviary, the male would call to the female
from cover and, collecting a number of insects in his bill, would feed
them to her. Both birds called with low clucking calls, and the female
would then walk slowly away. The male walked slowly alongside
her, brushing his body against hers. The female exposed her white
tail feathers, tilting her tail towards the male, and continued calling
with low clucking calls. The female would then bow away from the
male and place the point of her bill on the ground, then the male
would mount with wings outspread. After copulation, the male
fluttered off over the head of the female.
The first egg was laid on 4th April, 1957. There were two eggs in
this first clutch, but both were infertile. The second clutch contained
four eggs of which two hatched. The first chick died after two days ;
the second was hand-reared and lived for seven days. The two
remaining eggs were infertile. Six eggs were laid in the third clutch :
two were infertile, one chick hatched and was reared by the parents,
and the remaining three eggs were placed under a British Moorhen
(Gallinula chloropus ), two of them being hatched successfully.
One clutch was eventually discovered on Gough Island on 30th
September, 1956, by Mr. J. J. Van de Merwe, a member of the Gough
Island Scientific Survey who had remained on the Island to man the
meteorological station set up there. That clutch contained two eggs,
which fact supported deductions made from previous field observa-
tions on newly-hatched broods, that in the wild the normal clutch
size of this species is two. The larger and variable clutch size of the
Madingley pair may have been associated with a higher plane of
feeding.
The eggs resemble those of the British Moorhen but are rather
larger and less strikingly marked. They are a very pale buff colour
with a faint purplish ground. There are small purplish spots and
blotches, and some rather larger rich brown spots and blotches,
mostly concentrated round the wider end of the egg.
The incubation period was 21 days, and each of the last three
clutches (the birds went on to lay a total of twenty-three eggs altogether,
of which the last eleven did not hatch) was laid a day or two before
the previous one was due to hatch.
The plumage of the newly-hatched chick was as follows : Head
black down, silky. Bill crimson at base, blue-grey towards the tip,
with a white spot on top of upper mandible. A few long, silver silky
hairs as a fringe below the bill on the upper throat (rather like the
similar orange fringe on a young coot). Body down all black. Wings
fringed with down but upper surfaces bare, showing deep pink skin.
Legs and feet all black.
The down of the chick was replaced in the juvenile by brown
feathers over the whole body except for two dirty-cream bars in the

tip.
There is now a marked contrast in the degree of tameness between
the juvenile reared by its parents and those reared by wild British
Moorhens. This timidity on the part of the " wild " juveniles and
the nature of their habitat has made it difficult to observe them
regularly.

A VISIT TO SOUTHERN SPAIN
ByJ. J. Yealland (London, England)
" A good sherris-sack hath a two-fold operation in it," said Falstaff
in the course of his laudatory speech on this wine and his warning of
the deleterious effects, particularly upon young gentlemen, of " thin
potations ".
He was, of course, referring to the wine of Xeres, or Jerezdela
Frontera, as this ancient Spanish town is now known. But in addition
to being the home of the world's choicest sherries, Jerez happens to
be one of the best centres from which, particularly if he has the
assistance of kind friends, the ornithologist may see the fascinating
variety of birds of southern Spain. The mountains to the northward,
and the famous Marismas on either side of the lower Guadalquivir
River, are within reasonably easy reach of Jerez, while the town itself
possesses a zoological garden of considerable interest wherein a number
of the native birds may be seen.
In May, 1957, I paid a visit to Jerez at the kind invitation of Don
Alberto Duran and Mr. Hugh Ungricht, who created the zoo and are
honorary directors of it. May is a good time of year to visit this area,
for the weather is then not too hot as it is later, and the abundant wild
flowers are in bloom, while in the squares and the bodega gardens, the
jacaranda trees, magnolias, hibiscus, and many other plants are in full
blossom. The bougainvillea is flowering too, though of course, the
actual flower is insignificant, and in some of the streets there are
avenues of orange trees with, at that time of year, some ripe oranges
on them.
I went by air to Madrid, and had time for a short visit to the small
zoo there, which is situated in a beautiful park. Here I was interested
to see the Iberian race of the Eagle-Owl {Bubo bubo hispanus). Swifts
were common about the city as they were in many other parts, and
in the park there were also Goldfinches, House Martins, Swallows,
and House Sparrows. I looked out for the Spanish Sparrow in country
districts, but did not see it, and was told that it is now rare.

46 J. J. YEALLAND-A VISIT TO SOUTHERN SPAIN
The ten-hour train journey from Madrid to Jerez was enjoyable,
the more mountainous parts presenting some fine scenery. In the
mountains I saw two Azure-winged Magpies ; here and there along
the line Bee-eaters flew off from the telegraph wires. One or two
Hoopoes, a Roller, some Black-eared Wheatears, and Goldfinches
were also seen. At one place, close by the track, there were several
Black-winged Stilts in a shallow pool, and Turtle Doves were quite
common.
A feature of the Jerez zoological garden is the small flock of White
Storks that are quite tame and walk about the place. Various ducks
from the Marismas, including Marbled Teal ; the grey form of Tawny
Owl, a Black Stork, Golden Eagles, a Booted Eagle, Griffon, and
Egyptian Vultures, Purple Herons, Great Bustards, two Little Terns,
and a Black-winged Stilt were native birds that I especially remember.
There were, of course, many other birds, including Ostriches that
nest each year, but have not so far reared young.
There were more tame White Storks in the garden of the Sandeman
bodega, and a pair had a nest with young in it on the top of a chimney.
There were more nests about the town on church towers.
Dn. Duran took me to see a large breeding colony of Cattle Egrets
at a place some miles away. There were hundreds of pairs, some with
eggs and others busily engaged in nest-building. With them were
some Little Egrets, Night Herons, and White Storks, and as we
approached the trees many of the nearer birds rose and circled
round. It was a remarkable spectacle and one that only a colour
film complete with sound track could adequately describe.
In the bushes close by a Nightingale sang, and a little way off was
a Crested Lark. An Eagle and a Harrier were seen some distance off,
the latter flying low over a field of canary seed.
Another day we went to an area near Santa Maria where
Chameleons and Praying Mantids are to be found : we did not find
any then, but later two large Common Chameleons were collected
for me to bring back. Apart from the ubiquitous Goldfinch, we did
not see any birds, but we did collect three Ant-lions--rather foolishly
really, for I had to take them about with me and feed them on ants.
They did well, each in a small tin, but it was slightly difficult to search
for ants in hotel gardens without being seen and regarded with some
curiosity and suspicion. Even in their small tins of sand the Ant-lions
made their characteristic pits into which ants and other very small
creatures fall. At the slightest movement in the sand at the sides, the
Ant-lion concealed at the bottom, flicks grains of sand which help
to precipitate the victim to the bottom, where it is seized by a large
pair of jaws and drawn beneath. This sand-flicking reaction enables
one to see whether the Ant-lion is at home, for a gentle touch on the
side of the pit with a pine needle will evoke the response.

One afternoon I went to the ancient town of Arcos, some 30 km.
from Jerez, which is situated on a hill with a precipice of some 300 feet
on one side. The oldest part of the town with its white buildings and
narrow cobbled streets is well known to artists, but it was to see the
Griffon Vultures return to roost on ledges in the cliff face that I had
come. In front of the square, which is inlaid with dark and light-
coloured pebbles in characteristic Spanish style, is a balcony which
juts out over the precipice. Soaring before and above the balcony
were many Lesser Kestrels--some forty of them--and there were
nests of these birds on the cliff face. One passed close by, leisurely
eating a grasshopper held in its foot. Nearby was a pair of the Spotless
Starling that, I think, had a nest in a crevice. This is Sturms unicolor ,
and X saw one or two more of them at other places. After a time four
of the Vultures came circling out of the sky to settle for the night.
Only those who have seen a vulture soaring and gliding can appreciate
the real beauty of these fine (and very useful) birds. Sometimes, I was
told, twelve or more Griffon Vultures come here to roost, but if they
find food late in the day in the surrounding hills, they may remain
for the night somewhere close by.
I paid a visit of a day or two to Ronda, in the mountains between
Seville and Malaga, and the main purpose of this visit was to investigate
the following story in James Reynolds 5 Fabulous Spain.
" The cafe habitues were, I noticed, looking eagerly toward the
bridge. How well I knew why. The usual entertainment put on,
gratis, by the starlings was about ready to begin. I had sat spellbound
by this show before, and fully expected to again. No one knows for a
fact in what era it all started. Around five o'clock every afternoon,
except in rain or gales of wind, not too rare at this altitude, hundreds
of starlings appear from nests down among the rocks to dart through
paper or cardboard hoops made by small boys or # boys 5 of all ages.
The hoops are about ten inches in diameter, scarcely more than the
breadth of a starling's outspread wings. These hoops are skimmed
into the air above the bridge (the birds scorn to perform except at
the Puente Nuevo entrance to the bridge). At dragon-fly speed,
twittering in hysterical excitement, a starling darts through the
hoops. A bird almost never misses the hole ; sometimes two or three
birds may try for the same hoop, to fight it out in mid-air. Many a
paper hoop falls to earth torn to pieces. I skimmed some hoops
offered to me by a little boy whose eyes were popping with the exertion
of trying to be in three or four places at once. Action in the air is too
swift to tell how many bull's eyes I scored by proxy. The starlings
keep up this performance at high speed for perhaps half an hour, then,
as suddenly as the flock arrived, they were off again to rest and preen
their feathers on the roof tops. There will be no repeat performance
until next day at the same hour. I expect there is a sort of gymnasts'

guild to which the starlings belong, forbidding them to perform more
than once a day.
" The whole affair is taken very seriously, and the boys and men
argue over the weight of heavy paper or cardboard for skimming as
intently as crack tennis players discussing the weight of a racquet."
In the afternoon of my arrival I went to the bridge, but could see
no evidence of these strange happenings--in fact, the only birds there
at that time were Swifts, and a few dark-coloured Rock Pigeons.
I questioned two boys as best I could, and believe they understood,
but they seemed to know nothing of " the usual entertainment ",
and I could see no sign of paper hoops anywhere about. A man at
the hotel had a very vague idea that Starlings performed at the
bridge, and it may be that they do so at some other time of the year,
though Reynolds speaks of them coming from their nests.
What is so strange is that Starlings should find any pleasure in
flying through paper hoops--there seems no inducement for them to
do it, and in fact one would expect them to be frightened of the
hoops. The Puente Neuvo, of great architectural beauty and, I
believe, great age, spans a gorge that must be 200 feet deep. Below
the bridge the Swifts can be seen wheeling about.
I went again during the evening to the bridge, but there was still
no sign of Starlings. I was, however, rewarded, for flying over the
bridge among the Swifts were three or four Alpine Swifts, birds very
much larger and paler than the common Swift, and, of course, having
the underparts whitish with a dark band separating the white of the
throat from that of the belly. It was thrilling to see this handsome
bird, and I was reminded of the story told again by Dr. Lack in his
book, Swifts in a Tower.
Lord Rothschild was sitting with Dr. Hartert on a hotel terrace at
St. Moritz, when he exclaimed, " Ach, there's Melba ! " The
fashionable crowd turned, hoping to see Dame Nellie. " Are you
sure ? " asked Hartert. "Yes," replied Rothschild, " I recognized
her by her white belly." The Alpine Swift is, of course, Apus melba.
I saw two Choughs flying along the precipice at the end of the
hotel garden and an Egyptian Vulture soaring high over the valley.
There were one or two Chaffinches, a Blackcap, and one or two of
the Spotless Starlings about the garden.
From Ronda I went on to Malaga, the train passing through some
magnificent mountain scenery. The only bird of interest seen here
was a Rock Sparrow in a small aviary in the pretty public gardens
where a few Turtle Doves and a Red-legged Partridge also lived.
I noticed in various places that a few Goldfinches were kept in very
small cages hanging on the walls of houses. A stranger pet was the
Red-legged Partridge of which I saw several, all in extremely small
cages, but looking in good health.

I went on to Algeciras, but saw no birds of interest on the way.
The journey from Algeciras back to Jerez was, however, delightful,
the motor coach passing through some lovely scenery. Along the road
I noticed some Corn Buntings, a few Stonechats, a Great Grey Shrike,
two Woodchat-Shrikes, and three Pied Wheatears, as well as a large
number of the White Storks in one place. There were many cork
trees growing here, and, of course, in other places, the trees not
apparently suffering from having the cork bark stripped from the
trunks. This is regenerated in the course of time. It is a pity that
this fine tree is not more widely grown here ; it is, of course, rather
like the evergreen oak, and there are some in southern England that
are evidently unaffected by the coldest winters.
The next day I went to the Marismas, a vast flat area of marsh
and sand dunes. In the forested parts Mediterranean pines are
mostly grown, but there are cork trees, too. I stayed for two days
at a comfortable and well-furnished shooting lodge through the
kindness of the Marquis Santurce. To reach this place, called the
Palacio las Nuevas, it was necessary to go by motor-boat from Bonanza
at the mouth of the Guadalquivir for about a hour's journey (with
a favourable tide) to a point called Brenes where the caretaker of the
Palacio was waiting with a horse for me, the rest of the journey taking
about another hour. How this house and that of the caretaker,
together with stables, could ever have been built in this remote spot,
I cannot imagine, for all the materials must have been transported
across the three or four miles of mud-flats, presumably by pack horse
or horse-drawn sleigh, from the river bank where I landed.
On the way we passed close by several nests of Black-winged Stilts
which were common. Avocets were there in small numbers, and a few
Redshanks, Kentish Plovers, Little Egrets, and Common Herons.
Up to forty Spoonbills were seen and Pratincoles were very common,
while in the distance, like a pink haze, was a great flock of Flamingos
which must have numbered quite a thousand. They were not nesting
and were moving about the marsh, generally in the area between the
house and the river.
There were several nests of Swallows on the rafters of the stable
and, on this area of higher, and consequently dry, land were some
Blue-headed Wagtails and some Pipits that must, I think, have been
Tawny Pipits whose nests were built under canopies of dried blanket-
weed that had, when the water level was higher, become entangled
in the branches of a species of succulent plant.
There were a few Egyptian Vultures about ; the skeletons of cattle
here and there in the marsh were picked vefy clean. An occasional
Black Kite, a few Little, Black, and Sandwich Terns were also to be
seen.
The next morning the caretaker came with the horses and, pointing

to the westward horizon, said, 44 Coto." This was the only word that
we mutually understood, and from it I gathered that he wanted to
take me to the Coto Don ana, the area of the Marismas where some
excellent films of birds have been taken during the past three years.
Knowing that there were several ornithologists filming in that area
at the time, I was not very keen to go for fear of disturbing them and
the birds they were filming. In so vast an area, the chance of this
was not perhaps very great, and in any case it would have been
impossible to explain this to him. The ride took a good four hours ;
it was interesting to see how the vegetation varied with the type of
soil and the degree of moisture in it. At length we reached what he
wanted to show me, and I was relieved to find no sign of hides or
angry ornithologists. At this place, which I took to be the edge of the
Coto Donana, several cork trees grew amid a yellow-flowered cistus,
a tall kind of erica and various other plants, including brambles.
In the cork trees were nests of Cattle Egrets, White Storks, and a few
Little Egrets and Night Herons--the mixture as before, but with the
difference that in holes in the trees and in, so to speak, the basements
of the Storks' nests, there were Jackdaws breeding. A few Bee-eaters,
Magpies, and a Blackcap were also here, and in the distance several
deer watched us. Rabbits and some lizards were about this dry, sandy
place, and I was interested to see several of the wild gladiolus in bloom
amongst the bracken. These were dainty cerise flowers, and only a
small fraction of the size of the monstrous blooms we are accustomed
to see. On the way back I saw what must have been three or four
Sandgrouse which rose some distance in front of the horses. Some
ducks, probably Mallard, rose a long way off, but I was disappointed
in what I had most wanted to find--the White-headed Duck, the
only European representative of the Erismaturinae. There had been
a drought earlier in that region, and the White-headed Ducks had
evidently moved away. I did not see any place in that particular
fraction of the Marismas suitable for this duck, which is of skulking
habit and lives on waters where there are reeds and other vegetation.
Here the rushes and most of the other presumably palatable plants
are grazed short by the cattle and horses.
On the way back we called at a primitive house built of thatch and
having a bare earth floor, but even so it was kept very clean, and we
were made welcome with a cup of coffee. Here, as at the Palacio,
some Grey Lag type of domestic geese were kept, presumably as
decoys for the wild Grey Lags that come for the winter. Late the next
afternoon we set out for the river bank where the motor-boat was
waiting. There was a moderate breeze blowing against the down-
stream tide, making the water quite rough ; also making the rather
decayed motor-boat appear less inviting than on the tranquil waters
of two days before. Sure enough it was not long before the engine

coughed and stopped in the best traveller's tale tradition, but the
strong tide carried us on towards our destination, and it was not
long before the blocked petrol pipe was cleared.
On my last day at Jerez, Dn. Duran took me to the mountains to
the north-eastward. Here were many fine trees such as Spanish oak,
among which we saw Greater Spotted Woodpeckers, Jays, Long-
tailed Tits, and other birds. I had expected to hear Golden Orioles,
but did not happen to do so, but there were snatches of song from
Nightingales. On the road three or four Egyptian Vultures rose from
the carcase of a freshly killed pig. An eagle that might have been
Bonelli's, we thought, was flying along some great crags.
No new birds were seen on the train journey back to Madrid, and
very early the next morning I arrived back at London Airport with
my much-travelled Ant-lions, two Chameleons, and two Scorpions
that we had collected in the mountains--souvenirs of a most interesting
and enjoyable holiday.

BENGALESE FINCH x SILVERBILL HYBRIDS
By Erica Eisner (Oxford, England)

<bodyText confidence="0.997718083333333" page_id="56311087"  page_num="51" year="" vol="">
In a previous paper (Eisner, 1957) I gave reasons for believing the
Bengalese Finch to be a domesticated form of the Sharptailed Finch,
Lonchura striata , and said that I considered it most unlikely that the
Bengalese had a hybrid origin. The hybrid w r hich has been most often
suggested in this context is one of the Sharptail and the Silverbill,
Lonchura malabarica, but this seems especially unlikely because hybrids
between the Bengalese and the Silverbill are reported to be sterile.
During the spring of 1957, by the kindness of Dr. Holger Poulsen
and Dr. Desmond Morris, some Bengalese X Silverbill hybrids which
had been bred in the Copenhagen Zoo were made available to me.
These birds were two broods of a male brown and white Bengalese
with a female African Silverbill, and all six turned out to be males.
These hybrid males were put into outside aviaries together with
female Bengalese Finches. During the course of the season twelve
clutches were laid and properly incubated. Of the sixty-three eggs in
these clutches not a single one hatched. Thus, this confirms Stein-
bacher and Wolters' (1956) report that such hybrids are sterile.
I therefore believe that the evidence against a Sharptail X Silverbill
hybrid origin of the Bengalese is now so strong that this theory must
finally be abandoned.
It is interesting to observe how the characteristics of the two parent
species are assorted in the hybrid. In both appearance and behaviour
these six male hybrids are very uniform. I shall not discuss their
song because I believe this is largely learnt. In colour they resemble

E. EISNER-BENGALESE FINCH X SILVERBILL HYBRIDS
Sharptailed Finches or self-coloured Bengalese : the head, back,
and tail are of the same dark brown, and the belly is oatmeal-coloured.
In detail, the flank feathers bear the same type of marking--squama-
tions--as those of the Sharptail. However, the shading of the neck
and breast is quite different and considerably resembles that of the
Silverbill, except that there is a small, dark patch immediately below
the base of the beak. While in the Sharptail there is an abrupt transi-
tion from the dark breast to the pale belly, in the hybrids there is a
gradual shading from the dark feathers of the head and throat into
the light belly feathers. The under tail-coverts of the hybrids are
also pale coloured ; in the Sharptail they are dark brown. The rump
feathers of the hybrids are light coloured with darker markings, like
those of the Sharptail except that those nearest the base of the tail
are very heavily marked with black : this probably is an inheritance
from the African Silverbill whose upper tail-coverts are black. The
tail is long and pointed like that of the Bengalese and Sharptail.
As one might expect on genetical grounds, the hybrids have none of
the white feathers of the Bengalese. The upper mandible is nearly
black and the lower dark grey, again like the Sharptail--the Silverbill
has a pale silver-grey beak. The hybrids' feet and legs are brownish
like those of the Sharptail ; the Silverbill has pinkish feet. In build
the hybrids are intermediate between their parents : much heavier
built than the Silverbill, they are somewhat less sturdy than the
Bengalese.
In behaviour also they differ clearly from the Bengalese in ways
characteristic of the Silverbill. There is a photograph of Bengalese
courtship in my previous paper (Eisner, 1957) which may be used for
reference. A singing hybrid keeps its tail in line with the body, and
does not fan it ; the Bengalese raises and fans its tail. While the
Bengalese sings with large movements of the beak, the hybrids keep
their beaks almost shut, enabling them to hold a straw in their beaks
while they sing and especially during courtship ; the Bengalese never
carries a straw while singing but the Silverbill often does. In court-
ship the Bengalese pivots a great deal from side to side, but does not
move up and down much ; the hybrids pivot little but bounce a lot
up and down. All these differences in behaviour from the Bengalese
represent behaviour patterns of the Silverbill. In one obvious
character, though, the hybrids resemble the Bengalese and not the
Silverbill : when they sing their belly feathers are raised and fluffed
out, while the singing Silverbill keeps his belly feathers sleek.
The point of interest which emerges from these descriptions is that
though on the whole the appearance and behaviour of the hybrids
must be described as intermediate between those of the parent species,
when small components, such as for example the position of the tail
during courtship, are considered the hybrids are not intermediate,

but resemble either one or other of the parents. This suggests that
such small components act as genetic units and show dominance and
recessiveness in the usual way, in some instances the character of the
one parent being dominant, in others of the second. Such a suggestion
can only be confirmed by study of many different hybrids of related
species, and it is therefore well worth recording any available facts
about such birds. Also, although there is a list available of hybrids
which have been bred in captivity (Hopkinson, 1938-39) there is
very little published information, apart from that contained in
Steinbacher and Wolters' books, on whether such hybrids are fertile
or not ; this is a point of very considerable scientific interest regardless
of any special controversies such as that on the ancestry of the
Bengalese.

THE BREEDING OF DINEMELLFS WEAVER

The first pair of Dinemellia dinemelli was introduced into Pittsburgh's
Conservatory-Aviary on 15th August, 1954. The birds were purchased
from Louis Ruhe, Incorporated, of New York. Since their introduction
they have been the most energetic and industrious birds of our entire
collection.
Early in January, 1955, they began carrying nesting materials to
various sites in the aviary. This behaviour caused me to make regular
observations of the birds' activities. Countless hours were spent
observing them carrying twigs, small branches, and plant fibres to
various sites in the room. For months they carried sticks although
at no time did the semblance of a nest take shape. When the Weavers
would en masse a few bits of material the Scarlet Ibis or the Javan Hill
Myna would take apparent delight in scattering whatever accumula-
tion they had made. This activity continued for the remainder of the
year, yet at no time did the Weavers show any signs of frustration or
indication of abandoning their determined efforts.
During this period they were extremely cordial to each other and
chattered away incessantly. As it was impossible to separate the male

from the female on sight, I will presume it was the male who
demonstrated the courtship displays. The male would bow low over
his perch, flutter his outstretched wings while greeting the female
with an ardent chatter. The female would return his greetings with
a weaker fluttering of wings. This mild courtship display was effected
whenever the male rejoined the female even after the briefest of
separations. At every meeting both birds exchanged noisy greetings.
On rare occasions the male was observed carrying food to the female.
This general pattern continued with regularity until April, 1956, at
which time the Weavers moved into the next room to escape the
depredations of the Scarlet Ibis and Javan Hill Mynas. The
doors separating the rooms are fitted so that they do not completely
close. This small opening permits the smaller species free access to
either room while the larger birds are confined to a single room.
The new room apparently inspired the Weavers to continue their
nest building with still greater vigour, for within a week they were
busy carrying sticks to new locations. In their new territory they
found that the curtain vine (Cissus sicyoides) from tropical America
proved an ideal plant for providing them with excellent nesting sites.
The vine grows profusely all over the room and in its many entangle-
ments the Weavers revelled. Within a month three bulky nests
built side by side were completed under the conservatory roof on the
north side of the room. The nests were all supported by the curtain
vine, against the glass of the conservatory. The entrance holes to the
three nests were all made at the bottom with a slight tunnel projection.
Several times the Blue-cheeked Barbets (Cyanops asiatica) entered the
nests, at which time the Weavers would go in after them and quickly
drive them out. After one of these infrequent skirmishes with the
Barbets I observed the Weavers return to inspect their nests. I then
discovered the birds had several tunnel openings to each nest. A later
examination verified this observation. Each nest was found to have
three separate interior chambers all with their own entrances.
With their nests completed in mid-May the Weavers' activities
settled down to periodic trips in and out of the nests. At this time
I felt certain that it would be only a short time before the female
would be laying. By the end of June with the birds' activities showing
no new developments, I was beginning to assume that both Weavers
were males. This line of thought was further substantiated when no
acts of mating were observed other than the mild courtship displays.
By December the birds were not showing any interest in the nests,
a condition that remained until the middle of February, 1957.
Nesting activity started in earnest the first week of March, 1957,
with the Weavers building several new nests around the room. The
new nests were not as large structurally as the three nests completed
the previous year. In April they showed interest in the old nests and

were seen carrying sticks to effect repairs. Through April, May, and
June both birds were observed frequently visiting the old nests. By
this time my observations were only casual as I now firmly believed
both birds to be males.
On 15th August, 1957, while feeding mealworms, I was surprised
to see the Weavers display a belligerent attitude towards the other
birds in their eagerness to get the worms. Normally they shared the
worms with the other birds without fuss, content to receive an equal
share. Watching them closely I was soon rewarded, for both Weavers
were carrying the worms to the centre nest. After watching them
make several trips to the nest I felt certain in assuming they had
young.
Through the next two weeks the Weavers would not tolerate other
birds in the vicinity of the nest. Regardless of size they were all
quickly driven away from the nesting area.
On 29th August one young Weaver made its first appearance in
the room. The fledgling was discovered on the ground unable to fly.
I felt reasonably certain, from the example they had set in protecting
their nest, that the adults would give it ample protection. Much to my
surprise they showed complete indifference to the presence of other
birds near the baby. The parents proved good providers, however,
and the young bird never wanted for food. Besides mealworms the
adults fed the fledgling a variety of fruits along with some of our
insectivorous mixture. Both parents took turns in the feeding chore.
After stuffing the young bird the adults left, to busy themselves with
their own activities. When the baby cried for food they would feed
it again. The feeding periods averaged approximately one and a half
hours from the time the young Weaver left the nest. On the fourth
morning the White-crested Jay-Thrushes discovered the baby and
immediately set out to destroy it. Fortunately I was present and
able to intervene before serious damage was inflicted. This incident,
although observed by the adults, failed to incite them, behaviour
difficult to understand considering the strong defence previously
shown at the nest.
Witnessing this cool indifference shown by the parents I removed
the young bird to the kitchen. Within a week the young Weaver
had gained sufficient strength to sustain its powers of flight. On its
return to the room the adults, although recognizing their offspring,
displayed no excitement. They fed it, however, and in a few days
the young bird was following them everywhere. By 15th September
the young Weaver was feeding without assistance from the parents.
It is now January, 1958, and once again the adult birds are showing
an interest in the old nests. It will be interesting on their next nesting
to see if they raise more than one baby and whether the same nesting
chamber will be used.

With the passing away of Sydney Porter on 9th January, 1958, one
of the best known and most popular British bird enthusiasts has been
lost to aviculture. He joined the Society in 1920 at the age of twenty and
had since been one of its most active members. He was extremely
skilful at keeping rare and difficult birds of which he continually
maintained a fine collection in his aviaries at Derby. At the same
time he had an excellent general knowledge of ornithology, as well as
a gift for observation and for writing. His numerous articles have been
a great asset to the Avicultural Magazine throughout the years,
whether he related his avicultural experiences or gave a vivid account
of his numerous trips all over the world. He had travelled widely.
Plagued by asthma, he avoided the hard northern winters as often
as he could. He visited East and South Africa, Australia, New Zealand,
South-Eastern Asia, and California. He went twice to the last country,
in 1948 and 1952, and made many close friends among the local bird
men. We had hoped he would soon come again, but his health had
been getting worse during the last two years. The writer, along with
Mr. and Mrs. E. C. Kinsey and Mr. and Mrs. W. J. Sheffler, from
California, paid him a few days' visit at Derby in September, 1956,
and we found him far from well; but he still had many rare birds. He
became more and more of an invalid in the following months and
finally died at the early age of 58.
Sydney Porter was kind and unselfish, giving to his friends many
rare birds brought over from his expeditions abroad, or reared in his
aviaries. For instance, he sent to Cleres in 1934 a trio of New Zealand
Shovellers, a species which had never been imported before, nor has
come again since ; young were reared in 1935, the following year.
This is but one example of his friendly generosity.
There are now very few left of the aviculturists who made
bird keeping reach such a high level between the two world wars.
The disappearance of Sydney Porter creates a great void, and his
numerous friends will mourn him, but keep his memory vivid in their
hearts.

SUCCESSFUL BREEDING OF AFRICAN GREY
PARROTS IN DENMARK

By Walther Langberg (Copenhagen, Denmark)
When starting in the bird fancy about thirty years ago, Budgerigars
were my first birds. Later on I turned over to foreign finches,
starting with the more common African species and adding the rarer
Australian at a later date. After some time I also took up lovebirds,
and as my first parrakeets got Bourke's and Red-rumped, with which
I was quite successful. My interest in parrot-like birds grew, and later
I obtained several other species of parrakeets. About nine years ago
I decided to try my hand with the large talking parrots, mainly the
African Grey.
The first Grey Parrot I got was not a success in any way. The bird
was very shy and a bad screamer. I hoped it would become more tame
as time went on, but suddenly the bird died from food poisoning.
My next Grey was a wonderful bird. The bird dealer, from whom
I bought the bird, had obtained it when quite young. The bird
had spent a couple of years in his shop and was very tame and a
good talker. I suppose it was about three years old when I got it.
It soon became a highly esteemed member of the family, and gave
us much pleasure. Countless times I came running, when I believed
that my wife was calling for me, but it was the bird--we called it
"J aco " --which imitated my wife's voice perfectly. We presumed
that the bird was a hen, and I started to try to get a cock. As I had
expected, this was by no means an easy job. The choice was not
great, but every Grey Parrot, on which I could lay my hands, and
which could be presumed to be a cock, was tried. Usually the birds
would not agree. In order to accustom the birds to each other I had
a large cage made, divided by a removable wire slide. I put
"J aco " in one compartment and the latest arrival in the other,
and when the birds apparently were accustomed to each other
withdrew the slide. Usually the result was not encouraging ; the
birds fought or one chased the other.
Someone advised me to try with wild Grey Parrots, real screamers,
as there was no use in trying with tame birds. I should certainly
not recommend this method to any persons with weak nerves, as in
my experience, Grey Parrots caught as adult never become tame.
They do not lose their fear of people, but start screaming as soon as
one comes near their cage. This is rather terrible, the voice being
something between that of a pig and a cow, and continuing until
one leaves.
Young Greys have a grey iris, the adult bird's iris being whitish-
yellow. It is my experience that if a Grey with a whitish-yellow iris is

shy and starts screaming as soon as approached it will be next to
impossible to get such a bird tame. A young bird with a grey iris will,
however, in the course of time become tame and stop crying,
provided it is correctly treated.
After all these unsuccessful attempts, from which I, however,
fortunately learned something, I was one day able to make a choice
from a large consignment of Grey Parrots.
My choice was a big, dark grey bird, with strong beak and rather
big feet, as I had a theory that a cock should look like this. (The late
Duke of Bedford, in the first edition of Parrots and Parrot-like Birds , also
supports the theory that males are bigger than females.) For some
reason females are imported much more frequently than males. As to
colour, this may not be considered a guide in sexing, as the distribu-
tion of the species is wide, and birds from different parts of the territory
vary considerably both in size and colour. One sub-species, the
Timneh Parrot (Psittacus erithacus timneh ) from French Guiana, Sierra
Leone, and Liberia, is somewhat smaller, darker in colour, and has a
brownish-red tail. This bird is rarely imported, I have only seen one
at a dealer's here.
The new, presumed cock, was put in an ordinary parrot cage,
18 inches by 18 inches and 32 inches high. (This size is in common
use in Denmark for larger parrots, but is too small for permanent use.)
The new bird was a little shy, screamed sometimes, but as its iris was
still a bit greyish, I thought it was a young bird and would become
tamer as time went on. This actually happened, but it never became
as confiding as " Jaco ". We called the new bird " Coco ", and this
it learned to say, but its vocabulary has never been as large as that
of "Jaco".
"Jaco " was put in a cage, similar to that of " Coco ", and all the
winter the birds stood side by side. Early in the spring, 1954, I tried
putting the birds together in a large cage, and was very pleased to
find the birds agreed. I made a nest-box for them which was hung on
the outside of the cage, but they seemed to take no interest in it.
Unfortunately all my outside aviaries were in use, so the Grey Parrots
had to spend all the summer in the cage.
One of the presumed cocks--rejected by "Jaco", was given a
mate. When putting the two birds together, they agreed very well
immediately, and I now believed that I had two true pairs.
In the spring, 1955, I put all four parrots in an outside aviary
with an adjoining shelter. The flight was approximately 7 feet long,
4! feet wide, and 7 feet high, the shelter 4J feet by 4J feet and 7 feet
high. The floor of the flight and shelter was of creosoted wood, raised
about one foot from the ground. The entrance from flight to shelter
was almost the whole width of the aviary, and about 2 J feet high.
The four birds agreed tolerably, but kept in couples. As time went

on it was obvious that " Coco 55 and " Jaco " did not like company,
the others seemed to dominate them too much, so I took them out and
put them back in the large cage inside. They were busy in the nest-box
but nothing else happened.
In the course of the summer, the two birds in the aviary made
several attempts to mate, but nothing more happened, and in the
autumn they were taken inside and placed in a cage similar to the
other one, with a nesting-box.
At the end of the winter it seemed that "Coco" and "Jaco"
took more interest in each other, and "Jaco " was fed by " Coco "
every day. They also had mating dances with hanging wings, and
tried to mate. I therefore decided to put this pair in the outside
aviary as soon as the weather permitted. In the shelter I put two nest-
boxes, 12 inches by 12 inches by 20 inches high, hung on the wall
just under the ceiling, and on the floor I placed a small barrel without
a lid. In the outside flight also, a box of approximately the same size
as the others, but somewhat deeper, was hung. On the bottom of
the boxes and the barrel I put some shavings and a clod of peat
moss, in order to give the birds something to gnaw to pieces.
About the 1st May, 1956, " Coco " and "Jaco " were put in the
flight. They felt at home very quickly, knowing the place from the
previous year, and began to mate. At the beginning of June, "Jaco "
took great interest in the box, hung on the back wall of the shelter, had
a lot to do in it, and on Saturday, 16th June, she spent all day inside it.
On Sunday morning, when feeding the birds, I saw that "Jaco " was
outside the box. I took the opportunity of looking in the box and
saw the first egg of the Grey Parrot. My supposition was correct,
"Jaco " was certainly a hen. She went back into the box and sat
on the egg, which probably had been laid on the 16th. I inspected
the box every day, on the 19th there were two eggs, on the 25th three,
and on the 27th four eggs ; as far as I could judge there were intervals
of three days between the eggs. "Jaco " sat very tightly, and I was,
of course, very anxious to know whether the eggs were fertile, although
I did not really expect this, as the matings did not seem to be quite
successful.
On 14th July I examined the eggs, and they were all clear. Now I
was doubtful again ; maybe both were hens.
In the course of a few days the birds again started mating, but
again in the same scamped way as before. They ran up and down
the branches with hanging wings, and were obviously very excited.
The mating then took place, sideways, and it seemed to me that it
was not a true mating, only an attempt.
On 4th August, "Jaco " was again inside the box and had laid an
egg. This time also four eggs were laid, at intervals of three days.
She sat from the first egg, and on 21st August I tested the eggs ;

<bodyText confidence="0.999133044444445" page_id="56311100"  page_num="60" year="" vol="">
I hardly believed my eyes, they were all fertile. It seemed to me,
however, that the airsacs in all the eggs were rather large, and I was
afraid that the embryos were drying up. " Jaco," however, sat very
tightly, and obviously did not mind that I looked in the box now
and then.
Up to this time the food had consisted of spray millet, canary,
hemp, and sunflower (white and two kinds of striped) ; also sprouted
canary, hemp, oats, sunflower, and maize. Of soft food they had white
bread soaked in milk, with some vitamins and glucose added.
I thought that something extra was needed for feeding the young,
and as fresh, half-ripe maize-spikes, which make a natural food for
parrots, were obtainable at this time, I added these to their menu.
I also added monkey nuts, which are highly relished by the Grey
Parrots. They hardly touched any green food, but took apple, though
without great enthusiasm. The maize-spikes, however, seemed to be
the right rearing food, and more than 200 were taken before the
season ended. When night-frost comes, the maize-spikes are no longer
obtainable, but my wife had, at the end of the season, bought a large
supply and placed them in plastic bags in a refrigerator. In this way
we had this excellent food for a quite long time.
A catastrophe nearly occurred, just at the time the young should
hatch. The birds had gnawed the box so much, mainly on the lid,
that a large piece of it fell down, fortunately not into the box, but on
the floor of the shelter.
On Sunday, 2nd September, I examined the eggs and saw that the
airsacs in all the eggs were filled out, and to my amazement I saw small
marks in the shell of one of the eggs, showing that a young one had
picked the shell and was about to come out.
On 8th September, when " Jaco 55 was outside the box, I had a look
in the nest and saw two, apparently well-fed, young ones and a third
coming out of the egg. On 11 th September, I again looked in the box
and saw that the fourth young one was trying to come out from the shell.
As the young one apparently had difficulty in getting clear of the shell
I put in my hand to help it, but " Jaco " blew out her feathers and tried
to bite, so I had to take a spoon to take out the half-hatched young one.
It seemed rather weak, so I tried to help it by carefully breaking away
most of the shell. I put the young one back with the spoon and hoped
it would be saved, but when inspecting the nest in the afternoon, I
found it was dead, apparently bitten to death. Probably I had not
put the young one sufficiently deeply under the hen, and she had
obviously mistaken it for some other animal.
The newly-hatched young were flesh-coloured, with light beaks and
claws, covered with light down, looking like oversized young lovebirds.
The incubation takes approximately 30 days.
As long as the youngsters were small, the hen only left the box very

occasionally, and was fed by the cock, who went down to her in the
nest.
About 18th September the beaks of the young started to turn black.
The hen now left the box more often and took food herself, whereas
the cock went down into the box to feed the young. He also became
more aggressive towards me when I inspected the nest. When the
young were about one month old they started to grow grey down,
and the hen left the nest for longer periods than before.
About 6th October I noticed that the smallest of the young did
not develop like the others, and obviously did not get sufficient food.
On 8th October it lay in a corner of the nest-box and looked very
sick, the skin being quite flabby, there seemed to be no doubt that the
bird was underfed. I therefore decided to take it into the house and
try to feed it artificially. The young bird was placed in a nest-box
on a layer of peat moss and sawdust with a 50 watt Ellstein infra-red
lamp to keep it warm The bird was fed with a gruel consisting of
white bread soaked in milk (milk sop) mixed with glucose and a
preparation, very rich in proteins, called " Recoven ", various
vitamin preparations were also added. Later on mashed grapes,
bananas, and other soft fruits were added. The food was given luke-
warm by a syringe. It worked surprisingly well, and the young bird
very soon recovered and felt comfortable. As it grew older we had to
feed it more often, up to ten times a day. It was a hard job for my
wife, who had taken over the care of this bird, but it had to be done.
The bird, of course, became very tame and affectionate, and loved
to be handled.
At the time when the weak youngster was taken away, both the
others had started to grow feathers, and even the red tail-feathers
could be distinguished. The weaker youngster took considerably
longer to get the red tail-feathers, but later on they developed very
rapidly.
15th October was a black day. When my wife went to look at the
Grey Parrots in the aviary, one of the young lay dead on the floor.
The youngsters, at this time about six weeks old, were quite well-
developed. I believe that the bird in question had climbed up to
the nest hole, lost its balance, and fallen out. The post-mortem
examination showed no injuries, so I expect the young bird died of
cold, as the day was rather cold. Of course I became worried, and
decided to take the family inside ; the big cage was erected and
the nest-box hung inside. It deprived the old birds of a lot of room,
but they settled down nicely in the familiar surroundings, and a
little later the young one was fed by them.
There was now only one young one left with the parents, and on
17th November, when it was about 2 months old, I observed it feeding
itself on a maize-spike, which the old birds had dropped in the nest-box.

<bodyText confidence="0.990701533333334" page_id="56311102"  page_num="62" year="" vol="">
I now regularly put maize-spikes and sprouted sunflower in the box,
and these were taken by the young, which, of course, was also fed by
the parents.
On 23rd November the youngster climbed up and sat on the edge
of the nest-box, and on 25th November it left the box for the first
time, climbing around on the cage bars, but returning immediately
to the box when we approached, the old birds taking a defensive
position with blown-out feathers.
I noticed that the young one was of a lighter colour, had a light
tongue, and light nails, whereas the hand-fed young one was a darker
colour, with black tongue, and black nails.
After leaving the nest, to which it however returned, as soon as we
approached and always at night, it was mainly fed by the cock.
It also took food itself, mainly sprouted sunflower, and some small,
hard nuts, called Cembra nuts, but was still fed by the cock. As late
as 7th January, when the young one was four months old, I saw the
cock feeding it.
Of course I shall not part with these two youngsters ; I am interested
to learn how old Grey Parrots are when their iris becomes yellow,
and possibly also to ascertain at what age they become sexually
developed. The hand-fed young one I think is possibly hardly suitable
for breeding, being too disposed towards human beings ; still, it will
be interesting to get these problems solved.
As to the age of my old Grey Parrots, it is, of course, quite impossible
for me to state an exact age, but from the information I have obtained
I assume that the cock was 5-6 and the hen 10-11 years old when
they first bred.
" Jaco " and " Coco 55 spent all the winter 1956-57 in the house in
the large cage. In the spring their aviary was made ready and the
nest-box hung at the same place in the shelter as last time. First,
however, the box had to undergo a thorough repair, as all the front
was gnawed to pieces. On 7th April both the parent birds were
released in the aviary and immediately settled down in the well-known
surroundings.
After some time " Coco 55 started to feed " Jaco ", and we observed
occasional matings. At the beginning of June, "Jaco" sometimes
went down in the box, but never remained there for long. On
17th June, "Jaco" spent almost all day in the box, and the next
day I had a chance to have a look in the box and saw the first egg.
When inspecting the box on 20th June, I saw two eggs, and on
26th June, four eggs. On examining the eggs on 6th July I found
that at least one egg was fertile.
Contrary to the previous year, this time it was considerably more
difficult to inspect the nest, as "Jaco " was very aggressive and did
not allow me to look in the box. When she was outside and I

approached the aviary, she immediately returned to the shelter, so
that I only occasionally had time to open the door to the shelter
before she was inside the nest.
On 22nd July, however, I managed to have a look in the box
before she came inside, and saw that a young Grey was hatched. On
25th July I again had a chance to look in the nest, and now saw two
living young ones.
Up to now the cock had taken some milk-sop as well as the usual
dry and sprouted seed, so I hoped that milk-sop would prove a substi-
tute for the maize-spikes, unobtainable at this time. But as soon as the
young ones were hatched he stopped taking milk-sop, and neither of
the parents took any sunflower, hemp, or canary seed from the shelf
in the shelter. I then tried hanging some seed pots of canary and
hemp on the netting in the flight, which arrangement the birds
obviously approved, as they immediately started to feed on the seed.
During the time of feeding dry sunflower was hardly touched. The
birds mainly took dry hemp and canary and sprouted sunflower,
hemp, and canary seed, later on also milk-sop again. As far as I can
remember, I could not get any maize-spikes until the young were
about 3 weeks old.
The youngsters thrived well, and on 29th September one young one
sat on the edge of the nest, but not until 13th October did one of the
young sit on the perch in the shelter. The feathers, wings, and tail
were fully-developed, the bird was a bit slimmer than the parents, and,
of course, the iris was dark grey.
The following day both youngsters were outside the nest and sat
in the flight in the morning. They were quite alike, but in the course
of a few days it appeared that one of them apparently did not feel
quite well, and I observed that it was not fed as much as the other
one. They also started to feed themselves, but in this respect also
one of them seemed more advanced.
On 22nd October the weaker young one sat on the floor of the
shelter, apparently feeling cold. As the evening was rather cold, I con-
sidered it safer to take the bird inside the house, and placed it in a big
nest-box with a 50 watt Ellstein lamp to keep it warm. My wife fed the
bird with a syringe and it quickly recovered. When I took the young
bird inside, it was wild and shy, and screamed as soon as we
approached, but within three to four days it was quite tame, and in
the course of a fortnight it started to imitate the human voice. On
14th October I heard it say "Jaco" quite distinctly. The other
young bird is still in the aviary with the parents, and is still fed by
the cock.
I will try to let the parent birds stay in the aviary all the winter,
and shall only take them inside if the weather becomes very cold or
if they should appear to be uncomfortable. In the winter, 1956-57,

I kept two wild-caught Grey Parrots in a similar aviary all the winter,
and they apparently felt no discomfort. Of course, that winter was
unusually mild for our country.
At the moment I have nine Grey Parrots, and hope in the course of
time to breed a second generation. The nine birds consist of the
old breeding pair and their four youngsters, a supposedly somewhat
younger pair, and a newly imported bird, which I believe to be a cock.

By H. P. Van Heyst (Groenlo, Holland)
My male Pileated Parrakeet mated with my solitary Crimson
Rosella female in the spring of 1957. As far as I know this cross has
never been recorded before. At the start of the breeding season it was
rather difficult, as the hen was a little afraid of the big beak of her
partner, who tried to feed her out of his crop. But soon she ceased
flying away from her amorous mate, and responded to his advances,
and so breeding began.
One day the Crimson female disappeared into a hole in her tree
trunk, and remained there till evening, when she came out for a few
minutes to drink. During the day she was fed by her faithful husband,
who sat in front of the hole in the trunk looking in and whistling to her
several times to come for food, when he fed her out of his crop.
During the incubation period the male Pileated was in high spirits
and very active ; he made the most curious breakneck leaps during
flight or wallowed in the mud on the ground, calling " riririk " to
his mate.
Three weeks later she came out of the nest more frequently, several
times during the day, so I concluded there must be young, and I
found four beautiful chicks in the nest. Alas ! one night, perhaps a
fortnight later, the Crimson hen did not go back to her nest (probably
she had been disturbed), and I found the parents had stopped feeding
the young.
I took them out of the nest at once, and with the magnificent help
of my friend Dr. van Leeuwen, a veterinary surgeon, the experiment
of bringing them up artificially by hand was successfully accomplished,
and the four young grew up into adults. It is a pity that owing to the
carelessness of a member of my staff one of them escaped, but the
remaining three are now very fine birds. They become more colourful
every day, and enjoy the fresh Dutch air of my country, where they
are now acclimatized.

The colour of the young is predominantly green on the back, with
red spots on the head and on the rump, with little blue segments on
the flight feathers, and with the typical blue spots on the cheeks,
which only occur in Crimson Rosellas. The breast is dull violet-grey,
with a deep red spot on the abdomen. The beak is a typical Pileated
beak, and the whole shape resembles the Pileated more than the
Crimson Rosella. It would be interesting to know whether these
hybrids, which are already very beautiful, are fertile. I intend to con-
tinue breeding them, and I hope to report the results this year.

We are aware that many birds in addition to the above have been
bred in this country and abroad, but we are only concerned with our
own records. Many more species, some quite rare, have nested but
failed to rear young. These do not appear as records, but we do try
to help breeders to better success each year and we deal with cases
individually to provide the best advice available.
One most interesting event has been the breeding of rare-coloured
Blackbirds by Mr. S. Evans, of Port Talbot. Another has been the
first recorded breeding of Yellow X Pied Wagtail hybrids, by Mr. J.
Spinks, of Colchester. Medals for these two outstanding achievements
have been awarded.
We have placed our records for the past two years before Dr. T. G.
Taylor, for his consideration and information, and he has most

Will breeders of British birds help during the coming year by
sending records to us--it is very simple, and it is only by such informa-
tion that we can continue to be of service. In the meantime, if any
reader of this magazine is in need of information or advice on this
subject, will they please communicate with the British Bird Breeders'
Association, 7 Clieveden Road, Thorpe Bay, Essex. Stamped,

B.B.B.A. Breeding Records reviewed by T. G. Taylor, M.A., Ph.D.
To begin with I should like to offer my congratulations to members
of the B.B.B.A. on the large number of their breeding successes and
on the great variety of species, many of them rare, which they bred
in 1957. These notes, however, are concerned only with the feeding
systems used in the successful rearing of the common hardbills.
The over-riding impression with which I was left after reading the
record sheets was the trouble which breeders had taken to provide
their birds with as wide a variety of natural foods as possible. It was
obvious that their aim in housing and management as well as in
feeding, was to make conditions as much like nature as possible.
For example, virtually all breeders gave their birds soaked seed and
an abundance of green food in great variety. Some were in the
fortunate position of being able to give fresh supplies of green food
three times a day.
Green food .--It is interesting to note that the three varieties of green
food most favoured were the same for all species--chickweed, dandelion
heads, and sow-thistles. The order of preference, however, was
different for the three most popular species. With Bullfinches the
order was chickweed, dandelion, sow-thistle, with Goldfinches it was
dandelion, sow-thistle, chickweed, and with Greenfinches, dandelion,
chickweed, sow-thistle. Many other types of green food were used
as well--groundsel, seeding grasses, shepherd's purse, knotgrass,
cabbage, lettuce, knotweed, fat hen, and others.
Live food .--All breeders of Bullfinches and Chaffinches gave live
food when the young were in the nest, and most Siskins and Redpolls
were also given live food. Aphids (green and blackfly), ants eggs,
mealworms, gentles, and small caterpillars were the varieties most
commonly fed. Very few breeders of Goldfinches, Linnets, and Green-
finches (about 10 per cent of the total) gave their birds live food at all,
though a certain number of insects may have been caught in the
shrubs and on the grass growing in the aviaries.

<bodyText confidence="0.99551668292683" page_id="56311109"  page_num="67" year="" vol="">
Soft food .--Almost all breeders fed soft food of some sort, but there
was no indication that any one type was more widely used than any
other. Almost every breeder seemed to have his own special mixture,
though a fair number used the formula recommended by Mr. Hylton
Blythe. I was very interested in the soft food used by Mr. Alf Pritchard,
which consisted of a mixture of sausage rusk and egg custard--
1 cup rusk mixed with a custard made from i egg in J pint milk.
Theoretically, this is an excellent formula, and Mr. Pritchard used
it successfully in rearing Goldfinches, Bullfinches, Greenfinches,
Redpolls, and Linnets. Nutritionally, it is similar to red sponge cake,
which is also an excellent rearing food.
More than half the Goldfinch breeders fed hard boiled eggs, but
this was much less frequently fed to other species. Bread and milk
was not uncommonly offered to all species. A number of breeders
mentioned that they had to mix the soft food with maw and soaked
seed before they could get the birds to eat it.
Special notes on Greenfinches .--Although virtually all breeders fed
soaked seed, most of them fed hard seed as well. Many Greenfinch
breeders lost a high proportion of their youngsters before the moult,
but it is worthy of note that at least one breeder managed to get all
his young safely through the moult by withholding hard seed until
after the moult.
This loss of young Greenfinches at about 8 weeks of age through
" going light " is certainly a very serious problem, and I think it
would be a good thing if breeders experimented with various drugs
in an attempt to combat this type of enteritis. The antibiotics aureo-
mycin, penicillin, and terramycin are available in concentrated
form from agricultural chemists for adding to pig and poultry foods,
and I think it would be well worth while adding one or other of these
antibiotics to the soft food at three or four times the level recom-
mended by the makers right from hatching until the moult is over.
(I recommend the higher level of dosing because soft food is unlikely
to acount for more than J or J of the dry-matter intake of the birds).
Unfortunately it is not possible to buy these antibiotic supplements in
small amounts, and breeders may find that they have to buy enough
to mix a hundredweight or two of soft food !
An alternative suggestion I should like to make is that sulpha-
mezathine (used against coccidiosis and other poultry diseases) be
tried in the drinking water as soon as the young birds start going light.
A veterinary prescription is needed for this drug and for other sulpha
drugs which might be equally effective.

By J. J. Yealland
A Bittern picked up at Henham, Hertfordshire, was sent to the
Gardens early in February. It was uninjured and appears not to be
diseased, for it feeds readily and is so far doing well in the Waders'
Aviary. Two birds new to the Collection have been presented ;
one, a White-browed Bulbul (Pycnonotus luteolus) by Mr. G. H. Newmark, j
who also gave a Crimson Finch, a Yellow-cheeked Titmouse, and a
Golden-bellied Grosbeak, and the other, a Many-coloured Ground
Finch ('Saltatricula multicolor ), brought from Buenos Aires together
with a Black Tanager and another of the Golden-bellied Grosbeaks,
by Mr. N. H. D. Moore.
The Bulbul is what Whistler describes as " a quiet inconspicuous
bird, olive coloured above and paler below with a white eyebrow,
found singly in gardens and scrub jungle ". It is resident in Southern
India and Ceylon. The Ground Finch is a native of Western Argentina
and though it is many-coloured, the tints, even in the males, are very
subdued.
Mr. M. Harris has presented a Crimson Finch and two Goldfinches
that had been sent to him from Australia ; Mr. J. R. Newmark, a
pair of Rainbow Buntings and a Virginian Cardinal ; Mrs. E. B.
Hall-Smith, a Festive Tanager ; Mons. P. Staner, a pair of Black-
casqued Hornbills. A Cactus Conure, a White-winged and a Golden-
winged Parrakeet, from Mr. A. A. Prestwich, and two Baikal and three
Falcated Teal from Dr. K. C. Searle, complete the long list of recent
gifts.
While bird watching in Essex, Mr. D. Wood found a Short-eared
Owl unable to fly and covered in mud. He nursed it back to apparent
good health, but, as so often happens in such cases, it did not long
survive. This was a great disappointment, for this species would
have completed our collection of British nesting Owls for which a
range of new and palatial aviaries is nearing completion.
Three Grey-breasted Helmeted Guinea Fowl and three Common
Pheasants have been received in exchange, and five more Black-footed
Penguins have been hatched.
A Kagu presented by Mr. Ezra in 1941 has died and I wonder if we
shall ever see another. As far back as 1930 Mr. Frank Finn in a letter
to the Magazine, pointed out that this extremely interesting bird
(the only member of the Sub-order Rhinocheti and confined to New
Caledonia) was in danger of extinction because of the depredations
of feral dogs, and he suggested that a number might be released on
some safer island. Mr. Gerald Kirkham, who visited New Caledonia
a few years ago, told me that the Kagu still existed in more remote
parts, but that it was rapidly being exterminated by the dogs.

D. M. Reid-Henry, E. N. T. Vane and J. J. Yealland took part in
the discussion which followed.
Dr. Burton has kindly written the following summary of his discourse.
" Anting is now familiarly known to ornithologists as a trick of
behaviour that has been recorded in a hundred species of birds.
Typically, the anting attitude consists of the following : the bird picks
up an ant in its bill, brings the wings outward and forward, curved as if
shielding the front of the body, the tail is twisted to one side and
slightly under the body, and the head is moved rapidly up and down
inside one wing. This attitude varies slightly from time to time in the
same individual, it varies in detail from one species to another, but the
anting attitude is always recognizable as such, even if it has been on
occasion confused with the sunbathing posture and certain forms of
preening. It is possible to mistake sunbathing for anting, but once
anting has been seen it can always be recognized and there is never any
question of confusion with any other form of behaviour. Although, as
the name implies, the behaviour was first observed with ants providing
the stimulus, there are many records of other stimuli resulting in this
behaviour. The list of substances so used includes a number of pungent
and aromatic substances. Ant cocoons will induce anting, so will lemon

juice, apple peel, moth balls, wood ash, smoke from log fires or from
household chimneys. Some birds, especially those belonging to the
Corvidae, will ant with lighted cigarette-ends. This last has been
recorded on a number of occasions.
Although the habit of anting has been set on record in the literature
only within the last century or so, behaviour related to it has been
recorded in the early literature. For example, in the London Chronicle
it is stated that birds were seen carrying lighted coals in their beaks and
setting thatched roofs on fire in the City of London. Pliny records
the same thing for the thatched houses in Rome and in several books of
the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries we are told that choughs,
jackdaws and magpies were given to the same trick. Several birds in
my aviaries have been seen to ant, using ants or cocoons, and also
lighted cigarette-ends. One rook has this habit in an extreme form.
Before it came into our possession it was known to ant in the smoke of
an open log fire in the house of its owner, to perform similarly in front
of a lighted electric stove, in the hot water from the tap in the kitchen,
and in the steam from a teapot. It would try to turn on the hot-water
tap by pecking at it, it has been known to break a number of teapot lids
in its desire to use the steam from the contents of the teapot and it has
been known to switch on the electric fire in order to ant in front of it.
Like all members of the Corvidae, its insatiable curiosity combined
with its pecking habits caused it to peck open a box of self-striking
matches on one occasion and thereby to learn the trick of holding a
match in one foot, pecking at the head with its beak and, when the
match had been struck by this method, picking it up and go into
the anting posture holding the lighted match under one wing. Since
we have had this bird this trick has been demonstrated to visitors to
our garden on a large number of occasions. Subsequently I set light
to a heap of straw in the aviary to see whether the rook would carry
the glowing embers away, as the birds mentioned in the ancient
literature were said to have done. The rook did carry away burning
embers of straw. It did not, however, ant with them on that occasion.
At a later date, the same experiment was carried out with another rook
in another aviary and this one, as soon as the straw was set on fire,
danced to the burning heap and went into a vigorous anting posture,
pecking at the flames and then passing the beak rapidly up and down
inside one wing, or pecking at the smoke and behaving in the same way.
The stimulus of the burning straw was so strong that once the rook had
experience of anting in the flames the mere sight of a handful of straw
or a lighted match were sufficient to put it into an excited state and to
cause it to go into the anting posture. The appearance of the bird when
anting on the flames was most spectacular and every now and then in
the course of the performance it would hold a particular posture for a
brief moment, with the wings outspread and the head turned to one

side, the flames apparently licking around its body. In this position
it recalled very strongly the traditional picture of the phoenix.
Although this rook has anted on a heap of burning straw on a very
large number of occasions, the maximum injury sustained has been a
slight scorching of a patch of feathers on one side of the breast. During
the course of the first few tests with it a slight smell of scorched feathers
was noticeable but no scorching was perceptible to the eye. The
appearance of the bird in action on the burning straw is such that it
seems incredible that it does not suffer considerable harm from the
flames. This immunity to the effect of fire is explainable in all proba-
bility on the following grounds :--
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9075596" page_id="56311113"  page_num="71" year="" vol="">
1. The beak fills with saliva, so that although the bird bites at the
flames the moisture in the beak doubtless saves it from any harm ;
2. The nictitating membrane is drawn up over the eyes ; and
3. During the course of anting the forward vibrations of the wings
produces a fanning action which probably keeps the flames just away
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.983393705882353" page_id="56311113"  page_num="71" year="" vol="">
from the body.
It is impossible at the moment to suggest a biological function for
anting. There is some reason to suppose that the anting is an intensive
form of preening, for many of the postures and actions seen in the course
of anting closely resemble those seen in various forms of preening. It
may be taken for certain that anting has nothing to do with a desire to
be rid of parasites, as has been suggested on a number of occasions, nor
has it anything to do with picking ants off the body that have fortuitously
crawled on. Indeed, all the reasons given so far to account for anting
can be readily negatived by even a few observations of the birds
in action.
It has been suggested that anting may be the result of incarceration.
This is usually coupled with the suggestion that it may be a displace-
ment activity induced by boredom or loss of freedom and so on. That
such suggestions are groundless is readily demonstrated by the fact that
anting can be seen in wild birds."
The next meeting of the Club is on Monday, 12 th May, 1958 .

visits accounting for fourteen turkeys. Now I hear that a new menace
has arrived higher up the river--mink--escapees from the fur farms that
have bred wild. If any of our feminine members covet a coat, come to
Devon and catch it! We have three Buzzards and a pair of Kestrels
that visit us most days, Carrion Crows, Magpies, and Jays are legion,
yet the place swarms with small finches and softbills of all kinds, and
wild pheasants come and crow against our ornamentals."

Last year L. A. Hadlow bred two Stanley X Red-rumped Parrakeet
hybrids. This is an unusual cross, the previous records being E. J.
Boosey, 1943, a young male which died before moulting into adult
plumage : A. Gargan, of Dublin, 1944, five young, three males and
two females, left the nest at the end of July, but one of each died in
December ; 1945, five young were hatched but then, unfortunately,
the Red-rumped died so the young were transferred to a Rosella
with three young of her own. The young hybrids did well for a week,
but as the Rosellas grew larger they were gradually trampled and
only one survived. In 1950 D. G. Gibbs crossed a Stanley with a
yellow Red-rumped, which union produced a single male "a very

ZOOGEOGRAPHY. The Geographical Distribution of Animals.
By Philip J. Darlington, Jr. Illustrated. John Wiley and Sons,
Inc., New York ; Chapman and Hall, Ltd., London. 1957.
Price 1 20s.
This is a monographic study devoted to the geographical distribu-
tion of vertebrates with special emphasis on the faunas of South
America and Australia. Lists of families are given of existing land
and freshwater vertebrates with their distribution, relevant fossil
record, and other important information.
The geographical distribution of animals is of great importance
in the study of evolution, and both Darwin and Wallace considered
the pattern of distribution in undisturbed parts of the world as one
of the proofs of their theory. The difficulty of explaining the distribu-
tion of mammals on the old theory of creation, had puzzled many
of the earlier naturalists, and in the case of birds P. L. Sclater in 1857,
inclined to a belief in the existence of separate centres of creation in
different parts of the world.
AvicultUrists will be specially interested in the chapter devoted to
birds comprising 84 pages. Mayr and Amadon's classification is
adopted and in the list of families the details of distribution are taken
from Peters' (1931-1951) check list so far as it goes. It is obvious
that the great power of movement of birds introduces a special
difficulty in considering their ranges, but records of stragglers are
omitted. The migrations of land birds are mentioned when they
affect the limits or patterns of distribution in important ways, but
very many details have had to be left out. The author, who is
specially interested in birds, states that he finds their distribution
a puzzling problem. There is a clear though complex pattern, but
the processes that have produced this pattern--the evolution and
dispersal of birds--are very difficult to trace and understand. There
are few fossil birds and these are mostly fragmentary and of doubtful
relationships. It might be supposed that because birds can fly their
distribution would not be seriously affected by such easily crossed
barriers as water gaps. But the facts are by no means so simple. There
are several families of birds common in South and Central America
which have never reached the West Indies, a very moderate water
gap ; on the other hand other families have spread widely in these
islands. It is not possible to tell from a bird's physical characteristics
whether it is likely to cross water barriers. Rails seem to be very
reluctant fliers, yet these more than any other non-marine birds have
reached and populated the most remote oceanic islands. It is all the
more surprising, therefore, that in general birds can be divided into

six distinct regional faunas which correspond with the ordinary
geographical areas for other groups of vertebrates.
The geographical effects of bird migration are discussed in some
detail, but it is emphasized that it is mainly a back and forth move-
ment between summer breeding ranges in the north and wintering
ranges further south. But although migration extends and compli-
cates the distribution of many groups, the total effect of it is orderly,
and birds are not scattered at random over the world. The main
effect has been to increase relationships between tropical and north-
temperate birds in each half of the world and to decrease relation-
ships between the Old and New Worlds. In addition to the special
consideration of the various groups of animals there is a general
discussion of the climate and vegetation of the world, and an attempt
to interpret the facts of distribution. The final chapter comprises
an interesting survey of the probable history of the world during the
last 200 million years, and of the geographical origin and history
of man.

The National Show
The 14th National Exhibition of Gage Birds and Aquaria was held at Olympia on
9th, 10th, and nth January.
The variety of foreign birds was even better than in recent years and some of the
species had probably not been shown in London before. Mr. Whitmore's Violet-
eared Waxbills won in a good class of the rarer small seed-eaters and the Cardinal
and Grosbeak class, a particularly interesting one, was headed by Mr. Sawyer's
Black-throated Cardinals. It was pleasing to see Purple Grenadier Waxbills (P. and M.
Baines) again--albeit with some difficulty, for the light was poor.
Birds of Paradise were represented by the winning pair of Twelve-wired (Sawyer)
and a Red (Whitmore) that must have run them close. A fine Jamaican Streamer-
tailed was easily the best of the Humming Birds and there was an excellent class of
Sunbirds (won by Mrs. Draper's Tacazze) which included Golden-winged, Wedge-
tailed, and the rare La Touche's from eastern Asia. There were some lovely Tanagers,
both large and small, Mr. Anderdon's Blue-shouldered winning the one class and
Mr. Scamell's Blue-crowned the other. A White-headed Bulbul was an interesting
exhibit in the large Tanager, Shama, and Bulbul class.
</bodyText>
<reference confidence="0.741899">
A Loo Choo Robin (Sawyer) won the strongly supported class for Flycatchers,
Robins, etc., and the same exhibitor's Swinhoe's Rock Thrush headed the Fruit-
suckers, Thrushes, and Jay-Thrushes.
Rothschild's Grackle (Sawyer) was an easy winner in the Mynah class and some
Californian Quail made attractive exhibits in their class, which was won by D. A.
and J. E. Tack's Painted Quail.

COMMON NAMES FOR RARE BIRDS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.984907611111111" page_id="56311118"  page_num="76" year="" vol="">
Your annotation about common names at the end of " London Zoo Notes " in
the November-December Magazine raises an interesting point. Whatever the
practice of horticulturists, aviculturists usually use an English name for any bird in
their possession, and I do not think that I have ever heard a scientific name used
when being shown round any member's aviaries. Certainly one should always quote,
in brackets or italics, the scientific name of any bird one mentions in a scientific
paper, but in ordinary speech Epimachus meyeri bloodi means just nothing at all.
Rendered as the " Sickle-billed Bird of Paradise " we at least know it bears some
family resemblance to the other Birds of Paradise with which we are familiar.
I only keep a modest collection myself, mostly common species such as Psephotus
haematonotus, Psittacus erithacus, Cardinalis cardinalis , Euplectes franciscana, Lagonosticta
senegala, and Estrilda troglodytes (and I wonder how many people who read this will
know what I have?), but I am interested in a great number of birds that I can never
hope to possess, and I do like, when reading the list of new additions to the Zoo,
to have some idea of the kinds of birds they are, so that if there is anything that
particularly interests me, I can look out for it on my next visit to the Gardens. From
this point of view, the invention of English names would seem sensible and useful.

IN THE WASSENAAR ZOO
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9702798" page_id="56311125"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
By H. A. Gerrits (Manager of the Wassenaar Zoo, Holland)
The Brown Kingfisher, better known as the Laughing Jackass,
belongs to the genus Dacelo. This genus is a member of the subfamily
Daceloninae, which subfamily belongs to the Family Alcedinidae.
Although this bird, which is common in its native country Australia
where it is called Kookaburra will be known to many readers, I will,
nevertheless, give a short description of it.
Adult male .--Entire head, nape and sides of face umber-brown with
paler margins. Many white feathers on the nape. Cheeks and a
collar on back of neck isabelline, more or less marked with brown.
Mantle, upper wing-coverts earth-brown. Secondaries margined with
white, median and greater upper wing-coverts dark brown, slightly
tipped on the former and more broadly on the latter, with very pale
greenish blue. Bastard wing and primary coverts uniform dark brown.
Lower back, rump, upper tail-coverts and basal portion of tail chestnut
marked with dark brown, more boldly on the tail, the last white on
the terminal portion. Throat, breast, abdomen, under tail-coverts
and sides of the body greenish white with pale brown obsolete bars
on the last. Axillaries and under wing-coverts with pale brown bars.
Lower part of tail chestnut at the base with dark brown bars and
white at the tip. Eyes light greyish-brown, feet pale brown, upper
mandible black, lower dirty white, sides at the base brown. Total
length 395 mm., culmen 50 mm., wing 190 mm., tail 140 mm., tarsus
25 mm.
Adult female .--Similar to the adult male.

H. A. GERRITS-BREEDING OF THE BROWN KINGFISHER
In February, 1951, four specimens were imported straight from
Australia and at first the birds were put in our former birdhouse.
As soon as the weather grew a little bit milder and there was no more
frost during the night, the birds--meanwhile, having become
accustomed to their diet--were placed in an outer aviary. Towards
autumn their condition proved to be so good, and they had stood the
differences in temperature of our Dutch summer so well, that I
decided to keep the birds outside during the winter. Their aviary was
protected against the severe cold by rush-mats, but heated sleeping
shelters were not supplied. All four birds proved to be very hardy,
however, and even the coldest weather did not harm them. At first
there was no breeding activity and only after two of the birds had
been transferred to the Louise Hall (which was opened in 1953)
did the remaining couple become more friendly towards each other.
This does not imply that the birds were pugnacious when they were
all four together. On the contrary--with the exception of a small
quarrel about a much desired piece of food--I never witnessed a
fight between them. They were also very amiable towards birds of
the same size. (Incidentally, smaller birds are consumed by them
sooner or later.)
As I have already mentioned, the birds which were left in the
outside aviary sought each others company more and more, and
after I had seen them mating in the early spring of 1954 I had a
nesting-box placed in their 18 X 20 X 8 feet aviary. The "box"
is in reality a big, hollow log and is an enlarged replica of the well
known parrakeet box. The log has an outside diameter of 48 cm.
and a height of 55 cm. The round entrance is 13 cm. wide.
The first nesting attempts were not successful, however. During the
years 1954, 1955, and 1956 one, two, and again two eggs respectively
were laid, but none of these was hatched. I was never able to
ascertain what became of the eggs. They always mysteriously dis-
appeared, even when in 1956 one of the two eggs proved to be fertile.
Therefore when, on 24th April, 1957, one egg was found in the log,
our expectations were not very great. The second egg was found in
the morning of the 26th April and, just as in the preceeding years, the
female went to nest immediately. It was very obvious that the female
as well as the male took its turn in brooding. They also spent a couple
of hours daily together in the nest. When the nest was approached
by a human being the brooding bird pressed itself more closely on
the eggs while the other one--visibly disturbed--moved to and fro
through the aviary. On the whole their behaviour was, however,
very quiet and they were not upset when an inspection of the nest
was made. When I am speaking of the nest I must warn the reader
against an exaggerated impression of its composition. With the
exception of a thick layer of rotten wood (supplied by us) it did not

contain a single piece of nesting-material. The birds did not even
make a hollow in the layer ; the eggs were simply laid on the even
floor of the nest. We also noticed that they were moved about over
the floor.
As to the general behaviour of the Kingfishers, their remarkable
tameness decreased perceptibly during the breeding period. Formerly
they used to perch on the keeper's hand when he went into the aviary
with their food, but after they began nesting they withdrew when
anyone entered the aviary.
At last the day arrived when the eggs should hatch. According to
our calculations the first egg should hatch on 14th May thus giving
an incubation period of 21 days. Nothing happened, however, on
the 14th nor on the 15th of May. So when I entered the aviary on
16th May about 10 o'clock in the morning my expectations were high
and when I looked into the nest I was delighted to see a completely
naked, very helpless, young kingfisher. There were no traces of the
egg shell. The second egg was still in the nest, but the birds no
longer covered it.
The following day the second egg was gone. A thorough inspection
of the ground of the aviary proved fruitless so that we must assume
that the whole egg was eaten by the birds.
The change in the behaviour of the birds was now remarkable.
If they showed a dignified indifference towards anyone who entered
the aviary during incubation, now, after the hatching of their
youngster, they treated every intruder with hostility and even attacked
anybody who approached the nest too closely.
Observations through the entrance hole had now to be done with
the greatest care as the Kingfisher sitting in the nest aimed very
angry attacks at the eye of the observer. Therefore, for the first few
days I watched the birds from the outside with the greatest interest,
without disturbing them by an inspection of the nest. Fortunately they
immediately started dutifully to feed the young bird and I repeatedly
saw them enter the nest during the day with food in their beaks.
Food
During the first few days I supplied very finely cut raw meat,
mashed hard-boiled egg, rennet, young mice cut into small pieces,
finely cut raw and boiled fish, worms and an abundance of meal-
worms. The latter especially were consumed in great quantities,
although it was impossible to ascertain how many of these were eaten
by the young bird.
On 24th May--the young bird then being nine days old--I again
ventured to look into the nest. The old bird remained very quiet, so
that I decided to repeat my observations now that immediate danger
of losing the young bird by disturbing the parents no longer existed.

I therefore give below a short description of the appearance of the
young kingfisher on the succeeding days of my observations :--
24th May. --Young bird still totally naked with the exception of the
wings where pin-feathers begin to show.
28th May. --The wings are now almost entirely covered with pin-
feathers, while the first signs of the primaries are already clearly
visible. I also noticed light coloured pin-feathers on the other parts of
the body, namely on the forehead, the upper and the lower breast
and the belly. On the throat dark coloured pins are visible. The
pin-feathers on the wing are also dark-coloured. On the mantle two
rows of pin-feathers are showing so that the part in between still
remains uncovered. The pin-feathers are also beginning to show at
the ear-coverts. The greater part of the bird is still naked. The legs
are coloured bright pink. The eyes are tightly closed.
2nd June. --The young kingfisher is now almost entirely covered
with pin-feathers. Only the tibia and the centre area of the upper
breast are still bare. The rapid growth of the young bird is now very
remarkable in contrast with the first days when the slow progress
very often disquieted me.
4th June. --Witnessed that the young bird was fed with raw fish,
some egg, young mice (about two days old) and mealworms. The
total length of the bill is now 4 cm. The colour of the bill is dark
lead-grey and the upper- and lower-mandibles have a light green tip
at the end. The eyes have now opened slits.
yth June. --To-day the eyes of the young bird are fully opened.
6th June. --On the sides of the lower breast and upper belly the pins
have turned into feathers. Also the feathers on the head protrude
from the sheaths.
8th June. --Nape, mantle and wing butts are now also feathered.
gth June--Plate I. --Taken through the entrance hole. The young
bird was not in the least disturbed by the flash light. In this photograph
the young Kingfisher is sitting in the nest ; the layer of rotten wood
on the floor of the nest is clearly visible. The bare area on the
throat and chest can also still be seen.
nth June. --Head, with the exception of a small streak in the middle,
completely feathered. Wing-feathers now fully grown, except the
primaries. The feather design becomes apparent.
12th June.-- The rectrices and primaries are not yet developed.
The other feathers are nearly complete. Also the white wing
design is already showing. On the forehead the feathers are still
in their sheaths, but the brown band across the crown is already
clearly visible.
14th June. --The feathers on the breast are now fully closed, while
the feathers on the head are complete ; at the base of the bill only
the plumage is not yet developed. As soon as the primaries and the

rectrices have developed the whole plumage will be complete. The
colour of the bill is still lead-grey.
iyth June. ---The young bird has nearly an adult plumage. The
tail-feathers and the bill are still very short.
20th June. --Some photographs have been taken.
Plate II. --Shows how the young bird (now 36 days old) already
takes food from the parent at the entrance hole with so much force
that the old bird has to keep its balance by beating its wings.
Plate III. --Typical view of the watchful attitude of one of the
parents when somebody approaches the nest.
22nd June. --To-day the young Kingfisher left the nest for the first
time. In view of the chilly weather the bird was replaced in the nest
towards evening.
23rd June. --The youngster has again been outside the nest for the
whole day. Again replaced for the night.
24th , 25th , and 26th June. --The bird has been outside daily. Only
the bill and tail show the difference between the parents and the
young bird.
28th June. --To-day for the first time I did not replace the bird in
the nest and it also spent the night outside.
30th June--Plate IV. --The bird is now 46 days old. The picture
clearly shows that the dark bill and the tail are still very short.
Plate V. --One of the parents and the youngster sitting side by side,
showing the difference still existing between the birds remarkably well.
I hope in this article I have succeeded in giving the reader some
useful information regarding the breeding of the young kingfisher.
The young bird was able to look after itself immediately after leaving
the nest. The parents still took very good care of it, but except for
giving up a much favoured piece of food to it I did not see them
feeding again. The difference between the adults and the young bird
remained obvious for a long time even to an amateur.
Towards the end of August the length of the bill and the shape of
the tail were identical with those of the parents, and the birds were
now all alike in appearance except for the colour of the under mandible
which in the young bird was still dark grey.

By D. H. S. Risdon (Dudley, Worcs, England)
Waterfowl
Our old pair of Emperor Geese which have been at the Zoo to my
knowledge for nine years, laid two clutches of six eggs each, from
which eight very good goslings were reared by a friend. Four or
five eggs has been the usual clutch from this pair in the past. Three
Ghiloe Wigeon were reared in my garden under a bantam.
Although we reared nine Carolinas in 1956, they were a wash-out
last year. The ducklings that did hatch all died from what appeared
to be a form of pneumonia. They started breathing through the
open beak, which gradually got worse until they were literally
gasping for breath. We tried treating one of them in a heated place,
as one would a finch or a parrakeet with a chill. This kept the bird
alive, but it developed air pockets under the skin, which made it
blow up like a balloon before it eventually succumbed.
I think the cold, wet summer had something to do with it because
we lost a cock Plum-headed Parrakeet and a Grey-winged Trumpeter
with the same complaint.
Our Mandarin hopes were nipped in the bud by what I can only
imagine was a fox which bit off the female's head. The odd thing
about this occurrence was that the duck's body and its severed head
were both found inside the enclosure. Why the fox failed to carry
away the body, and moreover, did not attack the other waterfowl
in the enclosure, remains an unsolved mystery. The duck was in the
middle of laying at the time. What eggs she had laid were set under
a bantam, but proved to be clear.
For the first time I tried feeding poultry-layers' pellets to the
waterfowl during the laying period, in the hope that it might improve
fertility. This it did not do, but both Mandarins and Carolinas
started laying earlier than usual. There were plenty of eggs, but
both females suffered temporary lameness when laying, suggesting
over-stimulation of the ovaries. I wonder whether anyone else has
tried these pellets, and with what results ? The ducks did not seem
unduly keen on them, but they were eaten if scattered with the usual
corn at feeding time.
I keep a pair each of Mandarins, Carolinas and Baikal Teal in my
garden, these being my favourite ducks. I have noticed, both last
year and again this year (1958), how ready the Mandarins are to
cross-mate with the Carolinas, in spite of the fact that there is no
record of such a hybrid being produced. Last year the mated birds
actually unmated and reversed themselves, much to my annoyance,

and I had to remate them and separate them where the Mandarins
could not see the Garolinas, for several weeks, until they consented
to settle down with their rightful partners. Although the ducks bear
a superficial resemblance to each other, the drakes certainly do not,
nor are their displays or voices similar. This strange affinity therefore,
is all the more surprising since it does not produce off-spring, as for
instance, with other closely allied birds like Golden and Amherst
Pheasants.
Our Black Swans had four infertile eggs last year, but at the time
,of writing (February, 1958) the female has just started to incubate
another clutch of five.
Blue and Lesser Snow Geese laid, and some goslings were reared by a
friend, but we do not bother greatly with the eggs of these as we have
quite a flock of them, and they are very easy to rear. Ruddy Shelduck
laid, but all the eggs were infertile for the second year in succession.
Foxes continue to be an ever-present menace. They prowl the
Zoo Grounds at night, ever on the look-out for a hole in the wire-
netting fence where they can effect an entry. Last autumn they
killed a Demoiselle Crane which had been inadvertantly left loose in
the paddock overnight, a half-grown Wallaby and an adult Peahen
which was found early one morning being eaten by a vixen and two
grown cubs while its body was still warm. Normally our peafowl
roost high in the trees, out of harm's way, but the fox must have
caught this one when it flew down early in the half-light of dawn.
Because of the foxes we can never breed any Peafowl or Jungle Fowl
at liberty. They are safe enough while they roost in the trees, but
as soon as the hens start to lay or sit in the spring, the foxes get them,
and one by one they disappear. How bold these animals have become
was brought home to me recently when there had been a fall of snow
overnight. Their footprints were everywhere on the Zoo pathways,
and one set even led under the gate in the boundary wall into Castle
Hill, which is a main thoroughfare.

Our old pair of Pennant's, now nine years of age, once again
proved the importance of the right surroundings before they will
breed properly. Actually, we have had quite successful breeding
results with a number of parrakeets in the Zoo Aviaries. Such species
as Ring-necked, Rosella, Red-rumped Parrakeets and Cockatiels,
rearing quite good young. This particular pair of Pennant's, however,
have only twice reared young with us and on both occasions this has
been in my garden aviary. Other years, when for various reasons
they have been kept in one of the Zoo aviaries, they have never
produced more than infertile eggs. Three years ago in my garden
they reared two good young, and last year, back in the same situation

they reared three. The hen is probably a nervous sitter and does not
incubate properly unless she feels really secure. The interesting thing
to my mind is that this pair last year were only transferred to my
garden in April, and within a fortnight the hen was laying--a fact
which rather belies the general belief that birds need time to " settle
down " in new quarters.
I have a private theory that change, provided it is change in the
right direction, has a stimulating effect on some pairs of birds which
must get very bored with the same surroundings year in year out.
Just like a young married couple who have moved into a new house,
so this pair of Pennant's flew about the aviary which they had not
occupied for three years, excitedly examining everything, including
their old nest-box, in which they had bred before. Within days the
hen was inside the box, and as I have already stated, she began to
lay eggs soon afterwards.
We have a pair of the very lovely Barraband's X Princess of Wales's
hybrids, bred by Mrs. Clarke of Bromsgrove. Usually I do not admire
such crosses as they seldom equal in beauty either of the parent species.
In this case, however, they are really beautiful, and the cock at least
is quite distinct from either parent, being Barraband green, with
paler green shoulders, and having the whole of the underparts from
the forehead and face downwards bright orange-red. The hen looks
much more like one would expect--something midway between a
hen Barraband's and a hen Princess of Wales's.
I put this pair up to breed (a) as a matter of interest to see whether
they were fertile, and (b) if they were in the hopes of perpetuating
something worthwhile. Alas for my hopes ! They took absolutely
no notice of the nest-boxes which I offered them in various positions
about the aviary. True the hen occasionally showed fits of temper
and chased the cock about, which is supposed to be a good sign when
Barraband's intend to breed, but that is all that happened. At this
point I can hear shouts of " hooray " from the purists who abhor
fertile hybrids, very often with good reason. In self-defence, however,
I can only repeat that this one is so beautiful and so unlike any
parrakeet I know, that I feel it might be worthwhile trying to establish
it as a distinct variety.
Plum-heads did exactly the opposite to the Pennant's. For two
years they had produced infertile clutches of eggs in the Zoo aviaries,
so I thought I would give them the privacy of my garden, and see if,
like the Pennant's, they could do better. They didn't cotton-on at
all and made no effort to nest although the cock displayed quite a
bit. Incidentally, he was the one that picked up the same germ as the
Trumpeter and the Carolina ducklings. His breathing became
laborious and it was audible several yards away. Curiously enough,
he never looked ill (nor did the Trumpeter and the ducklings) and so

foolishly, I delayed catching him and putting him in hospital. I ought
to have known better--a sick bird practically never recovers of its own
accord in my experience, and so, of course, we lost him.
Redrumps produced two nice young ones--not a very good result
admittedly.
Gockatiels were a disappointment compared with previous years
when we have bred many. Last year we lost the hen of one pair and
the cock of the other just after breeding commenced, which seemed
to upset things. We mated the two survivors but they only laid a few
infertile eggs.
Our pair of Yellow-backed Lories at one time raised our hopes as
the cock became very savage after the hen had been sitting for some
time--in fact it was impossible to enter the aviary without being
attacked. When eventually both birds reappeared together we really
thought they must have young, but when we had a chance to look
in the nest-box we found to our disappointment--nothing. These
Lories are the most murderous parrots I have ever known. Several
years ago I had them in my large planted aviary which measures
about 50 feet by 15 feet. This was the year incidentally, in which
they actually hatched a youngster and then let it die, unless they ate
it, because it disappeared. The aviary at the time was occupied by
various other large and medium-sized birds ; among them was a
delightfully tame, hand-reared Mistle Thrush, which was a special
pet of mine. Imagine my horror when one day I found it terribly
mutilated with an eye gouged out, a broken wing and many feathers
missing. I blamed a pair of White-crested Jay-Thrushes as they
seemed the most likely culprits, although I had never seen them
attempt to hurt anything. Anyway, as a safety precaution, they were
removed, but a few weeks later I found an Indian Green-winged Dove
dead, and half torn to pieces. I was really perplexed now ; and then
I got a clue. The Dove's feet were literally shredded to the bone,
a thing which could only have been done by a rat's teeth or a parrot's
beak. There were no rats--of that I was sure, so I set a trap. Propping
up the remains of the Dove, in as life-like a posture as I could on a
perch, I retired and kept watch. Presently the Lories approached
the corpse, one on each side with sideways leaps and much bobbing
and tail wagging. Suddenly and without warning, they pounced
like a couple of hawks. Both birds and the corpse fell to the ground in
a heap where they proceeded to re-enact their " crime ". The sinister
aspect of the whole affair was that the Lories never attempted to
chase or bully the other birds so that one might have had warning
of their evil intentions. It was all done by stealth. The victims in
both cases must have been unaware of their danger until too late.
The Lories at best are heavy and clumsy fliers and the other birds
could easily have avoided them in such a large aviary.

Black-headed Conures did nothing beyond spending a good deal
of time in their nest-box. They are a noisy couple and scream the
place down whenever they see me or anyone they know, whilst
ignoring the public who throng past their aviary.
A cock green Indian Ring-neck mated to a hen lutino Ring-neck
produced two young ones, greens, of course.
Rosellas were infertile, possibly because the hen is a young bird.
Our old hen which bred so well has been pensioned off as she is showing
signs of decrepitude.
Among our macaws we have an obviously true pair of Blue and
Yellow which seemed anxious to breed. At any rate they laid a
couple of eggs during the winter in the corner of their cage in the
bird house. Ordinary wooden nest-boxes are hopeless for these
birds--they chew them up as fast as you like to build them. Hollow
tree trunks, large enough for macaws to nest in are hard to come by,
so I hit on the idea of building them a concrete tree trunk. At con-
siderable trouble a sort of brick chimney was built in one of the
outdoor aviaries, about 7 feet high, with a concrete lid and a hole in
the side. About half-way down a solid 2-inch thick slab of wood was
incorporated to form the bottom of the nest, and this was well covered
with a layer of rotten wood. The whole of the outside of the brick-
work was covered with cement and cleverly shaped to resemble a tree
trunk. The macaws have never even so much as looked at our efforts.
A mated pair of macaws live very much " in one another's pockets "
and these Blue and Yellow are no exception. They are forever
" necking " and preening one another, so much so that the hen has
more or less denuded the cock of feathers at the back of his head.
Other birds
Black-footed Penguins, at the time of writing (February, 1958) have
six youngsters in four different nests. They seem to be making a greater
success of it this winter than previously, even though we have had
one spell of frost and snow. These birds are like Gouldian Finches
in their persistence in starting to breed in November and going into
a moult in the spring, which means that the young ones usually hatch
in about the worst of the winter weather. Their courtship is even
more " human " than their general appearance. There is a good deal
of " slap and tickle " about it, one bird vibrating its flippers rapidly
against its mate's body producing a loud slapping noise. The mated
pairs walk about together with arched necks and often with one
flipper across its partner's back, for all the world like two portly lovers
walking " arm in arm ".
The clutch of eggs appears to be invariably two, and unlike the
antarctic species, they incubate in the normal manner, the birds
covering the eggs with their breasts. The sexes are alike so one cannot

be certain, but I think both cock and hen share the duties of
incubation.
Interesting species which we received in 1957 were Scarlet
Ibis, American Little Egrets and Buff-backed Herons. These all
share a large flight cage in the bird house containing a pond, where
they have done extremely well. The Egrets and Herons developed
their nuptial plumes and even made some attempt at nesting last
summer. I noticed them carrying twigs and trying to place them in
the forked branches and so I rigged up some platforms of wire-netting
and carefully lined them with twigs and coarse grass ; with avian
perversity all the birds did for my pains was to pull my beautiful
nests to pieces.
The Scarlet Ibis when they arrived were the most wonderful
geranium red with black tips to their wings. When they moulted the
new feathers inevitably began to come through pale pink, and so I
have tried colour feeding them by having all their food dipped in
colour food as used for canaries. This has had a marked effect and the
new feathers are undoubtedly growing much redder, but not, I think,
quite the brilliant shade of the plumage at the time they were imported.
At the same time we are trying this colour food on other species
which lose their red. An old Scarlet Tanager which we have had for
many years has moulted out as brilliant as when he first arrived.
Virginian Cardinals have shown some improvement as well as
Troupials. This colour food seems perfectly harmless and does not
affect the birds in any way except their colour. I am even trying it
with our pair of Hunting Cissas, one of which is still in the green
plumage at the time of importation. The other is blue, having moulted
with us several times. It is too early yet to say what effect it will have
on these. I do wish that some of our experts could really get down
to discovering what it is that causes birds to lose their red or orange
in captivity. One thing is fairly certain. It is the insectivorous, or
partially insectivorous, species which lose it. Red features largely in
the colouring of parrots and these certainly retain their brilliance.
So do Red-headed Gouldian Finches, but all these are vegetarians.
Oddly enough the breast of the Golden Pheasant loses none of its
vividness, and yet I would have said that pheasants were omnivorous--
eating a good deal of insectile food.
Flamingos lose their pink unless given plenty of fresh boiled
shrimps or prawns. Scarlet Ibises, Virginian Cardinals, Scarlet
Tanagers and Sunbirds all lose their red after a moult in captivity,
and these are all to a certain extent insectivorous. Why does the
captive cock Linnet never develop the vivid red flush on forehead and
breast of the wild bird during the spring, even though Linnets are
bred quite successfully in aviaries ? Possibly the Linnet is more
insectivorous in a wild state than is generally supposed.

D. WEST-SOUTH AMERICAN PARRAKEETS

One of our pairs of European Eagle-Owls reared a nice youngster
to maturity. This pair breed regularly every year, sometimes rearing
two, sometimes one, chick. When the youngster assumes adult
plumage in the autumn, the only way to distinguish it from its parents
is from the colour of its irides which remain yellow, and only darken
to deep orange with age. These owls seem easier to breed in captivity
than other birds of prey--at least they make more of a success of
rearing their off-spring on dead food.

SOME MISCELLANEOUS NOTES ON A
CINNAMON LINEOLATED PARRAKEET,
AND OTHER SOUTH AMERICAN PARRAKEETS

By David West (Montebello, Calif., U.S.A.)
Members may be interested to know of a rather pretty mutation
of the Lineolated Parrakeet now living in my collection. It is a
cinnamon variety, and has white bill and feet, and the black spots
and flecking seen in the normal is a soft and light shade of brown in
this particular bird. The green is of a much lighter shade than in
the normal coloured bird, and has a decidedly yellowish cast.
Altogether it is a very pretty bird, and appears to be a good, hardy
specimen of the Lineolated Parrakeet.
I obtained the bird from a friend, and its origin is not known.
It is mated to a normal male, and the two appear very kindly disposed
to each other. It will be most interesting to see what the young from
this mating might be.
At about the same time as the cinnamon was obtained four birds,
tentatively identified as Psilopsiagnon aurifrons rohertsi (from Peru)
were obtained. These are unusually charming birds, being the size
of a budgerigar, and having a green body with the forehead, edge of
cheeks and throat yellow, and a slight trace of blue in the primaries.
The females are solid green, with no traces of yellow, but with a slight
trace of blue in the primaries. They have an interesting little alarm
note, and appear to be quite hardy and will probably prove rather
pugnacious. Their small size, certainly that of a small budgerigar and
not that of an English exhibition budgerigar, makes them rather
interesting. They appear to be quite fond of fruit, and also crawl about
upside down a good deal. The two pairs I have tend to stay very close
together, and all sleep side by side.
Better known than the above is the Orange-flanked Parrakeet.
Like others of their genus they have a magnificent set of lungs, which
they tend to keep in full operation at all times. However, the pair

<bodyText confidence="0.998808375" page_id="56311139"  page_num="89" year="" vol="">
I have rather make up for this failing by their obvious affection
towards each other, their curiosity about all affairs going on in the
kitchen (where they are kept), and for the magnificent orange under
the wing-coverts. This is a really marvellous colour, and they are
quite lovely in flight. My pair are very affectionate, feed each other,
and I am in hopes that they might eventually breed.
Finally, some notes on the little Celestial Parrotlet might prove of some
interest. The Duke of Bedford is quite right when he refers to it as " A
lovely and distinct Parrotlet . . ." They are tiny beyond belief, and
the colours are very soft and warm, and a most unusual and beautiful
combination of greens and blues. Although very common in their
native land, they have not been readily available here, and so it was
very pleasing to be able to add some to the collection. Mr. Lyle
Wickline had a pair for many years, and found them to be very
prolific breeders, but with a failing for neglecting the young when
they left the box. The common Parrotlet seems always to go in for
large clutches, and Mr. Wickline raised a nest of six this last summer,
and Mr. Sheffler has raised them almost continuously since 1931.
Last, but not least, I recently saw a lovely specimen of the little
Red-bellied Macaw. This is quite a rare species, and like so many
of the dwarf macaws has considerable charm. Nice as it is, I have
heard that the little Yellow-naped Macaw is even prettier, but these
dwarf macaws appear to be rather shy breeders, even if one were
fortunate enough to secure a true pair.

For twenty-eight years I have had a cock Black-headed and a hen
White-bellied Caique ; they must be nearly thirty-four years old as
they lived in captivity for some time before I got them. At one time,
when I had them in a cage, I used to let them out, but they were very
destructive and ate all the backs of our library books bound in leather.
I then put them in an aviary with central heating and also electric
heat during the winter, as they could not stand a lot of cold. They
sleep in a nest-box on the wall.
They are a most devoted couple and I am always in dread that one
will die before the other, as I feel pretty sure the little hen would die if
she was alone, unless she could be made a pet and was allowed to fly
about the house.

The hen lays every winter, sometimes two clutches of eggs, but the
eggs are taken away at once, and only once I allowed them to rear a
brood, as the little hen nearly died when they reared the one survivor
of this brood. On this occasion two young hatched, but the second one
was much smaller and very soon died. The old birds fed them with
half-digested food from their crops, but this was too much for the little
hen and she became very weak, so I decided not to let her rear any
more. She never has any trouble in laying and she always lays in our
winter at home. The young bird, a cock, only lived two years. It was
like the cock bird, with a black head, but it had the white belly of its
mother. When it was adult I had to separate it from the old pair as it
tried to mate with its mother and this caused friction. I tried to get it
a mate but was unsuccessful.
My Hyacinthine Macaw had its aviary close to theirs but it died.
I had had it from a young bird for over thirty years. It was in lovely
plumage and appears to have had a stroke, as it had no previous illness
and only lived twenty-four hours.
We have a big garden here and a farm of nearly 8,000 acres ; our
garden is full of trees and it is really ideal for the birds, which are my
greatest pleasure. There are flowering trees all round the house and it
is so interesting to watch the birds sucking nectar from the flowers. The
house is surrounded by scarlet, flamboyant trees, Jacarandas and
masses of Bougainvillaeas of all colours. There are hundreds of Waxbills,
the Blue-breasted are the most numerous and as many as fifty feed on
my veranda in front of the house and come up on the steps for canary-
seed. The Crimson Waxbills are also very plentiful and Paradise Fly-
catchers fly backwards and forwards to the trees on each side of the
veranda close to the house. They are lovely birds, quite tiny, with
black heads and golden bodies, and the cock has two long golden
feathers in the tail during the breeding season. They are only here in
the summer and they had a nest in the wood adjoining the house and
I used to watch the cock bird sitting on the tiniest round nest with its
golden tail hanging over the edge. The Purple-crested Lourie nests
both up here near the house and also down at the farm, a mile away,
and we constantly see them flying across the garden and lands, with
their lovely scarlet and blue striped wings and purple crests. There are
a great many of the Purple-breasted Rollers--they are such a brilliant
blue when flying ; there are also Bee-eaters and Sunbirds of all kinds,
Bulbuls, Scarlet-headed Barbets, lovely thrushes, and all kinds of
weavers and finches, also a lot of Golden Orioles and Black-headed
Orioles. The Scarlet and Orange Weavers fly over the lands in large
flocks, but they usually do not come into colour till the rains start ;
the doves, too, are wonderful.

I now have at least two pairs of each species of Agapornis (except, of
course, swinderniana , which is not kept in captivity). Consequently, I
now have eight species (Peach-faced, Masked, Fischer's, Nyasa,
Black-cheeked, Abyssinian, Madagascar, and Red-faced). I managed
to obtain the first three species here in the States last February but
didn't get the others until August. Except for the first three men-
tioned and the Nyasas, all are wild-caught adults. All are fine, healthy
birds and I have so far bred the following: Peach-faced--n,
Masked--5, Nyasa--3, Fischer's--2, Abyssinian--4, Madagascar--5,
Black-cheeked--3, and 10 hybrid Fischer's X Peach-faced. I don't
expect much from the Red-faced until next summer when I can get
them outside. I will be fortunate indeed to breed this species at all.
Otherwise I feel that I have been rather lucky.
All have been bred in inside flight cages measuring 2 feet by 2 feet by
4 feet, or in cages measuring 2 feet by 4 feet by 4 feet. These I specially
designed to serve as combination hides and cages. The fronts are solid
plywood with peep holes and camera ports, the backs are also solid
plywood with a tree painted on along with sky, distant hills, etc. A hole
is bored in the " tree " and the nest-box affixed to the outside of the
back. I am not sure if the painted background is of any value in
encouraging the birds, but it makes the photographs more pleasing
without detracting from their scientific value.
The accompanying photograph of my pair of roseicollis with two of
their recently fledged young visible will give some idea of what the
breeding cages look like when viewed through my observation peep-
hole.
All the birds have been fed on French's Budgerigar Mixture,
French's Budgerigar Conditioning Food, cuttlebone, gravel (clean
quartz only), and once in awhile a little green food, such as celery
or lettuce. I also give them a little sunflower and hemp when they
are rearing young. The conditioning food and vitamin drops in the
drinking water when the females are laying I am sure contribute to
breeding success in helping to prevent " dead in shell ". I had a little
trouble with this before I began adding vitamin drops to the drinking
water while the females were laying. I think that once the birds are
in really tip-top shape the extra vitamins may be omitted.

W. G. DILGER-STUDIES IN AGAPORNIS
The first phase of the study is a comparative study of the behaviour
of the entire genus. The second phase will involve an attempt to study
the genetics of some of the behaviour by making careful crosses among
the species (including back crosses and F 2 generations) and observing
what happens to the various behaviour patterns. Another series of
experiments will be designed to get a deeper penetration into our
understanding of particularly significant phases of their behaviour.
We are interested in the causation, biological significance and
evolution of the behaviour we are observing.
We have the following adult birds in the aviary (not counting many
young which we have raised and are now mature) :
roseicollis i pair
fischeri i pair and an odd female
personata i pair and two unsexed adults
lilianae i pair and two unsexed adults
nigrigenis 2 pairs
cana 2 pairs
taranta 2 pairs
pullaria 4 males and 2 females
I hope to build six large outside flights next spring in which I will
attempt to breed pullaria and study pair formation in some of the
others.
Warm thanks are accorded to Mr. A. A. Prestwich, Hon. Secretary
of the Avicultural Society, for his help in locating the birds for this
study.

This cross came about more or less naturally. Two years ago, in
1955, my wife and I reared some pheasants from eggs with bantams
as foster-mothers. One of the chicks, a hen, broke a wing when about
eight weeks old and as a result was unable to join her brothers and
sisters when they were released into the cruel world of the woods
and coverts.
She remained with the bantams and has lived with them ever since.
Last spring she made a nest in a flower border in the garden and
laid eight eggs. As the nest was disturbed by the dogs we took the
eggs and put them under a broody bantam : only one hatched out--
in June. As a chick it looked like any other bantam chick but it evinced
pheasant-like qualities, being very active on its legs, elusive and
difficult to put to bed.
Now that it has grown up it is the size of a large cock pheasant.
Its colouring, however, is more like a bantam's. Its body and wing
coverings are a light creamy-buff turning to brown over the rump.
Its head and neck are black except for a buff patch on top and it has
the red wattle of a cock pheasant round the eye, though perhaps not
quite so large or pronounced as Ph. colchicus. Its head has no crest.
The primaries and secondaries are black and light buff, and show
black when in flight. The tail feathers are not long and pointed
like a pheasant's but resemble a rather exaggerated hen bantam's tail.
They are black and light buff and rounded at the ends.
The bird's habits--generally--tend to be more pheasant-ish than
bantam-ish. It roosts in the pine trees and spends a great deal of
the day--when not feeding--either on the branch of a tree or perched
on the high gate of the bantam run.
As it also spends a lot of time with its mother wandering round the
garden looking for insects and grubs in the grass, flower borders etc.,
I suspect that it tends to revert to its Phasianidae ancestors rather than
to its Javanese.
Up to date it has made no call so I cannot say if it emulates the
pheasant in this respect. It will be interesting to see if this cross can
be carried any further.

After about eighteen years I at last, in 1957, reared a Pink-footed
Goose from a gander (2) I picked up on the Wash in 1946 and a
goose (4) which came from the Wash in 1948. Both were thought to
have been young birds which had not paired off in the wild state. The
goose did lay in 1956 but through various disturbances we never got to
a hatch. The following are notes made during the 1957 season :--

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9405005" page_id="56311146"  page_num="94" year="" vol="">
gander. These were certainly old birds then and very much a pair.
The gander died in October, 1952, for no known reason. The goose
has a good deal of white above the bill and has been lame for some
years. On the death of the gander she attached herself to a pair of
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.954362444444444" page_id="56311146"  page_num="94" year="" vol="">
Grey Lag Geese until I got another gander in August, 1954.
(2) A gander caught on the Wash on 24th December, 1946, with
slight damage in one wing, it had probably hit a telephone wire ; it
was a bird of the year.
(3) A goose brought from New Grounds, Slimbridge, 29th Sep-
tember, 1947, thought to have been hatched in 1946 and was almost
certainly a bird which had never nested. It was known at first as
the little brown goose, but this is not so obvious now.
(4) A goose caught on the Wash, December, 1948, in a net. I was
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.938698947368421" page_id="56311146"  page_num="94" year="" vol="">
given it by the catcher. It was a bird of the year and had a little
white above the bill.
(5) A gander obtained in August, 1954 (see 1 above), not a yearling
bird but had probably never paired. It was possibly 2-3 years old
and by December it had paired up with goose No. 1.
For a year or so these geese have been going about as follows :--
Nos. 1 and 5 together as a pair and a trio of Nos. 2, 3, and 4. In 1956
goose No. 4 nested and laid, the first egg being presumed to have
been laid on 4th June. I think four eggs were laid and the goose sat
a few days but was then disturbed, I do not know the reason, and
left the nest for good. The measurements of the eggs averaged
50 mm. X 79 mm. One other egg was found that year measuring
56-5 mm. X 90 mm. This could only have been laid by goose No. 1
and it was just in the water on the edge of the pond. I have a feeling
that odd eggs picked up in the past may have been hers. I cannot
remember more than one being found in any year. She was not too
bright for a day or so after the egg was found which rather confirms
the matter. Up till now gander No. 2 had been the boss of the Pink-
feet and continued to be so.

yth June. --Pink-footed Goose No. 4 was on the old nest. This is
right in the open about two feet from a clump of periwinkle, not the
best of places to keep eggs safe from Magpies and Jays.
yth June. --Bird on nest in the morning till 12.30 p.m., off in the
afternoon ; I think another egg was laid at 7.15 p.m. ; still off the nest.
8 th June. --On nest all morning, left nest at 3.15 p.m. went back
very soon and left again at 3.40 p.m. For the first time I noticed
a very little down in nest. Still off nest at 4.15 p.m. and stayed off.
Goose seems to sit near nest when not laying.
gth June. --Goose believed to have been on nest all day.
10th June. --On all morning, believed on all day.
nth June. --Has five whole eggs and one broken egg in nest. The
goose was standing up and let me go to her but moved a little way
away. Nest hole very deep. I think a mole had been under it so I
put a piece of asbestos cement sheet in the bottom. I removed the
broken egg and stained grass and remade the nest, adding a bit more
dead grass and cleaned up all the eggs and covered them. The goose
went back as I moved away.
yth July. --Believed two baby goslings seen. When the goose was
sitting, if any one went too near, or if she saw any one, she would
stretch out her neck almost flat on the ground, but I could go quite
close to her, within about 9 feet, with reasonable safety.
8 th July. --Off with the two goslings. The three remaining eggs
measured 50-5 mm. X 76 mm., 51-5 mm. X 78 -5 mm., and 52 -5 mm.
X 80 mm. The old goose and goslings went down the gorge to the
water, up by a small bridge and back to the nest. They all three
spent the night at the top of the orchard with No. 1 old goose and
her mate No. 5.
nth July. --Found Pink-footed and young very disturbed and
divided up in the morning. One gosling with mother No. 4, one
gosling with old goose No. 1 whose mate, No. 5, was not far away.
Nos. 2 and 3 together on pond. 10.30 a.m. got Nos. 1,4, and 5 together
with goslings and drove them very, very slowly out of the orchard and
into a pen on the lawn. The goslings were in a very bad state and
could only move a few paces at a time, their legs were all over the
place. I had to help them up some steps. The pen is about 60 square
feet and as it rained hard in the afternoon and evening I put fish
netting over the pen which as it turned out did not help matters.
One little gosling, the bigger of the two, sat down beside the goose
and never went under her. I think if it had not been her first brood
the goose would have done more about it. I never discovered the
cause of the disturbance, but caught a Magpie later on.
12th July. --The gosling which did not go under the goose was dead
in the morning. The other was much better on its legs, but by no
means perfect.

hers on 6th July and No. 5 about 28th June.
24th July. --Pen again lengthened and is now about 20 yards long
and 2 yards wide. I think a long narrow pen is much better than a
square one as the birds can be fed at one end and they have more
room to run about and keep moving. I gave them one of my rearing
houses, 2 feet by 6 feet, as they had no other cover from rain.
I noticed this was not used a great deal but it probably helped.
28th July. --Whole pen moved sideways in order to provide 15/16
new ground without handling the geese. Gosling had been squeaking
for about five days and when running from disturbance it flaps its
wings.
30th July. --Caught stoat by reeds in orchard. This may have been
the cause of the disturbance and if so my Pink-footed Geese must be
quite good at protecting their young. I have never heard the goose
cluck or make any noise to call the gosling. The colour of the gosling
at birth was half-way between colour of the birds on the plate on the
cover of the 7th Annual Report of the Wildfowl Trust and that in the
plate in The Wildfowl of the World by Jean Delacour (Plate XX,
page 192). The gander used to bill the gosling when small, though it
never did any damage to it nor got hold of it. I could never make
up my mind whether this action of the gander's was affection or
because it did not want the gosling near. At three weeks the gosling
was half its mother's height.
31st July. --Feathers distinctly showing on gosling and feet turning
paler in colour.
21st August. --Gosling's primaries just showing beyond secondaries
when wing folded. In mother goose No. 4 approximately ij inches
of primaries showing. Grass consumption has gone down very much
over the last week.
22nd August. --Gosling's legs and feet dull yellow, bill showing dull
pink band. Plumage blue-grey (old birds brown) no light edges to
feathers but dark brown bar on back feathers ; down on lower neck
and legs. Approximately a head shorter than mother goose.
24th August. --Put geese and gosling back in orchard with the other
pair and all started with a good wash and under-water swimming.
Still fed lawn mowings.

31st August. --Gosling has very little down on lower neck and it has
lost its " plus-fours ".
2nd September. --Nos. 1, 2, and 3 wings longer than tails. No. 4 wing
and tail same length. No. 5 for some reason had been pinioned in
both wings. Gosling's wing 1 inch shorter than tail. It still squeaks.

intense in colour but dark on feathers and light edges much more
pronounced. General colour still blue-grey, browns lighter than

24th January , 195#.--Colour advanced still further, but still much as
above, though more white edges. Started to make a harsh noise.
White flanks at last plainly visible and gosling not very distinguishable
from old birds unless one knows it ; it is lanky compared with old birds.
About ten days ago it still had a very slight squeak but now no longer
squeaks. Bill has a great deal of pink on it. I had thought in my
other birds the pink increased with age, but the gosling now has as
much as any of them.
8th February. --The gosling is undoubtedly a gander, and it is now
by no means easy to tell from the others. The position in the orchard
is now as follows :--
Party No. 1. --Nos. 1, 4, 5, and gosling.
Party No. 2. ---Nos. 2 and 3.
No. 5 is now very much the boss gander. It is interesting to note
that up to the time of the hatching of the young gander No. 2 was
the master. Goose No. 4 was assisted with her brood by goose No. 1,

and her mate, No. 5, just followed her and immediately became the
master bird. In my opinion this is a very interesting point and I am
anxious to see what will happen this year.
With regard to food, I tried the gosling on mash but it would not
touch it. I then gave a mixture of half crushed oats and half wheat
frequently in small quantities. It would seem that the crushed oats
were preferred by the gosling but grass was the main feed. The
consumption was one box from a 20-inch mower per day. Water was
given in a bowl to start with and then by a water fountain which
was cleaned out at least once a day. Grit was put in a water bowl
and they frequently went to it.
The Pink-footed Geese share the orchard with a pair of Barnacle
Geese, one very old Grey Lag Goose (hatched 1935)5 ten Pintail and
eight Wigeon.

Birds new to the Collection received during the past two months
are a Red-breasted or Scutated Fruit Grow (Pyroderus scutatus ) presented
by Mr. G. H. Newmark, a pair of Ethiopian Yellow-bellied Waxbills
(Coccopygia melanotis quartinia) presented by Mr. J. R. Newmark, and a
pair of Golden-fronted Parrakeets ( Psilopsiagon a. aurifrons) received
in exchange.
The Fruit Grow is one of the larger of the Cotingidae and a native
of south-eastern Brazil and Paraguay. It is wholly black with a red
patch on the throat and upper breast.
The Yellow-bellied Waxbills are very different in appearance from
the well-known southern race--Dufresne's Waxbill--for there is no
black on the face and they are much more yellow underneath.
The Golden-fronted Parrakeets inhabit the temperate zone in the
Cordillera of central Peru. They are quite small and of frail appear-
ance. The male is yellow on the front of the head and down the
breast with green on the back and wings and bluish flights. The
female shows much less yellow and both have small orange-coloured
beaks.

It is to be hoped that members visiting Belgium for the great
Brussels Universal and International Exhibition will find time to visit
the Antwerp Zoo. They will be well rewarded by seeing the recent
collection of birds brought from the Belgian Congo by Charles Cordier
and his wife. The most important arrival is a male of the very rare
Congo Peacock (Afropavo congensis) . The only previous examples of this
species to leave Africa were the six males and one female collected by
Charles Cordier in 1949 for the New York Zoo. Included in the
collection were three other species imported into Europe probably for
the first time : 9 Black Guineafowl ( Phasidus niger ), 8 Schouteden's

A. W. Richards, East Hills, N.S.W., sends brief descriptions of
some rare colour varieties of local birds : " Painted Finch (Emblema
picta ), the yellow variety is in all respects similar to the normal bird
with the exception that the red is replaced by an amber colouring
similar to that found on the yellow-headed form of the Gouldian.
I know of only one aviculturist in Australia with this particular
aberration and he has been very fortunate with his breeding results,
having bred about twenty during the past season. Star or Red-tailed Finch
{Bathilda rujicauda ), the yellow variety is very similar to the ordinary
Star, but the general body colour is much richer and the head colouring
is a very rich yellow. These are owned by the same aviculturist as the
yellow Painted Finches. Gouldian Finch (Poephila gouldiae), the albino
variety is exceptionally beautiful, the general body colour being
yellow (very bright), the lilac breast is replaced with white, and a deep
yellow bar below. With a red head the bird is really outstanding, as the
red is also surrounded with a broad band of white. I have noticed
that in these albinos the central tail-feathers are exceptionally long.
As far as I know only one aviculturist has this mutation. His breeding
results are not very satisfactory. He manages to build up a stock of
about fifty birds and then they die out to about ten birds. This has
happened for several years

The author had a very happy idea in deciding to give biographies of
the persons whose names appear in the scientific nomenclature of five
genera and 173 species and sub-species of the Order Psittaciformes.
Most of these names belong to very real individuals whose lives reveal
an extraordinary range of activities. A number are named after kings,
queens, or princesses, others after famous explorers, yet others after
animal collectors, some as a compliment to a lady friend, and a few
after almost legendary characters. Three are named after former
secretaries of the Zoological Society of London and several are in
honour of distinguished ornithologists.

There is a widespread idea that the discoverer of a new species may
name it after himself, but it is doubtful whether anyone has ever been
quite so publicity minded, although persons have been known to get
over the difficulty by stating that he was naming the animal after
his wife !
This explains the omission in the scientific nomenclature of such
famous authorities as Banks, Bauer, Brown, Illiger, Levaillant, Pennant,
and others, although their memory is perpetuated in the vernacular
names.
The author is to be congratulated on the manner in which he has
traced innumerable obscure references ; aviculturists and others
will find this compilation most fascinating in its entertaining account
of many diverse characters.

OBSERVATIONS ON BIRDS OF SOUTH-EASTERN BRAZIL.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992581464285714" page_id="56311154"  page_num="102" year="" vol="">
By M. H. Mitchell. Published by University Press, Toronto,
and Oxford University Press, London, 1958. Price 45^. net.
This book is an account of the birds, and the habitats in which they
were observed, in the south-eastern coastal region of Brazil, in an area
traversed by the author during four years stay in Rio de Janeiro,
from August, 1950, to November, 1954. Though, as Mrs. Mitchell
states in her introduction, the city of Rio de Janeiro and its environs
offered great variety in types of territory, and it was here that she
lived for the greater part of four years, she also visited the Gabo Frio
region east of the city, Mount Itatiaia, Belo Horizonte, and Ouro
Preto in Minas Gerais, Sao Paulo and as far inland as southern Mato
Grosso and western Parana. The author was greatly assisted by that
well-known Brazilian ornithologist, Dr. Oliverio M. de O. Pinto,
whose great work Catalogo das Aves do Brasil is unfortunately only
published in Portuguese. Mrs. Mitchell fully acknowledges the great
amount of help, guidance, and advice she received from Dr. Pinto,
and in the foreword, he writes of the book " It is as if something more
than scientific investigation has served as inspiration for the pages
which follow, something .... in which is reflected the sweet memory
of the brilliance of our sunlight, and the welcoming shade of our
jungle . . ." This well sums the graphic way in which Mrs. Mitchell
presents her subject. During her stay she positively identified 289
species of birds but saw many more. She begins her book with
descriptions of the various localities she visited which are amplified
by four maps and ten photographic illustrations. She states that the
aspect of tropical avifauna which her observations impressed on her
most forcibly was its unpredictability. She quotes the City Park,
which was one of the areas she visited most frequently, and remarks

that though a few species seemed to be permanent residents there
and she might be reasonably sure of seeing or at least hearing them,
other species might be there or might not ; they might even be
present during one nesting season and then never appear there again.
Another aspect of her observations for which she never found a
plausible explanation was the fact that not once, but several times, she
saw a new species, perhaps saw it again almost immediately in more
or less the same locality, and then never found it subsequently any-
where, even though it was not an uncommon bird.
In the annotated list of the species observed the author has combined
several sources for the systematic listing and the English names.
Wherever possible she gives the Brazilian common name translated
as literally as possible into English ; as she points out these are usually
very apt, interesting from the point of view of the Indian origin, or
simply amusing. Such names as the " sleepy one " for the Yellow-
crowned Night Heron and the " little Peacock of Para 55 for the Sun
Bittern being typical examples. She describes the exact locality where
she observed each species, and also mentions the characteristics of
the bird which struck her on observing it, and gives full references
to any previous work. A glossary of Portuguese names, bibliography
and index complete this carefully prepared book.

DIE UNZERTRENNLICHEN (LOVEBIRDS). By Helmut
Hampe. 3rd Edition. Published by Verlag Gottfried Helene.
Pfungstadt/Darmstadt, 1957.
The second edition of this book which was published in 1953
(and reviewed in the Avicultural Magazine, May-June, 1954) proved
so popular that it was decided to publish a third edition, with additional
information contributed by C. af Enehjelm and J. Steinbacher.
The number of photographic plates has been increased to 54 and a
colour plate by R. A. Vowles of the most commonly kept species of
Agapornis , Red-faced, Masked, Fischer's, and Abyssinian or Black-
winged are included. Dr. Steinbacher adds a section on the breeding
of the Red-faced Lovebird (A. pullaria) and refers to the two near-
successes of Helmut Hampe described in 1937 and 1939. Dr. Stein-
bacher then refers to the successful breeding of this species by A. A.
Prestwich described in the Jan.-Feb., 1957, number of the Avicultural
Magazine. He says this was announced as a first breeding and adds
that the successful breeding of this species by E. Spille in Oldenburg
in 1900 was so long ago that even experts such as Edward Boosey
and A. A. Prestwich " did not remember it ". This statement was
undoubtedly made as a result of a misunderstanding and lack of
reference to the literature. The breeding of Agapornis pullaria by

A. A. Prestwich was claimed as a first for Great Britain and Northern
Ireland only (as is shown by the note at the end of the article) ;
in point of fact, from information available it would appear to be a
world first record. Far from having forgotten about Mr. Spille's
success Mr. Prestwich devotes considerable space to this in his book
Records of Parrots bred in Captivity (1950-52) page 186. There was
some doubt regarding the actual species bred by E. Spille and this
resulted in a correspondence between the late Dr. E. Hopkinson and
Helmut Hampe's namesake, Alex. Hampe. A summary of the
enquiries made is given in the Avicultural Magazine, 1947, page 144.
No doubt Dr. Steinbacher will include these references if another
edition of this book is prepared.
Mr. af Enehjelm contributes a most useful chapter on colour
varieties and gives an account of the mutations already achieved.
As yet only recessive and sex-linked mutations are known, but the
author states that as colour breeding of Agapornis is as yet in its infancy
dominant and intermediate mutations can be expected. He points
out that colour breeding in lovebirds presents many difficulties which
are not the case with Budgerigars. The determination of sex is not so
simple and lovebirds do not breed so readily as Budgerigars. The
question of ringing is also not so easy and the author describes the
system he uses of ringing male birds on the left leg and females on
the right. Strong nickel rings are used and as soon as he receives a
new bird it is ringed on both legs ; when he is sure of the sex he
removes the appropriate ring, so that the bird is not worried by
having to get used to a ring on its other leg.
This excellent book, written by a very great aviculturist and brought
up to date by two such well-known experts as Dr. Steinbacher and
Mr. af Enehjelm will undoubtedly be sold out as rapidly as its two
predecessors.

A COLOURED KEY TO THE WILDFOWL OF THE WORLD.
By Peter Scott. Published by The Wildfowl Trust, Slimbridge,
Glos., 1957.
As is stated at the beginning of this book, A Key to the Wildfowl of
the World , containing black and white drawings only, was first published
in the 2nd Annual Report of the Severn Wildfowl Trust, 1948-49.
It was reprinted as a separate book in 1950, revised and reprinted
again in 1951. This coloured version amounts to an entirely new
publication. Substantial additions have been made to the text and
there has been further extensive revision in the light of the most
recent taxonomic opinion,

This invaluable book by that great expert, Peter Scott, is of con-
venient size to be taken in the pocket anywhere, and will be received
with much satisfaction by that very large body of people interested
in wildfowl. An explanation of how to use the key is given and this
is followed by a quick guide to a number of basic characteristics--
size, shape, bill shape, colour, brightly coloured bills, voice, and
behaviour. A section gives advice on "if you are stuck ", and the
author explains names and classification in a clear and simple way.
There are 23 coloured plates depicting 247 kinds of ducks, geese, and
swans, every kind so far known to exist in the world, and are yet
another example of Peter Scott's unflagging energy and initiative.
No price is given.

BREEDING OF GREATER HILL MYNAH

In view of Mr. Prestwich's statement on page 71 of the last issue, I think that, in
order to avoid confusion, I ought perhaps to point out that, while he is technically
perfectly correct in stating that the bird we bred at Keston was the Northern or
Indian Grackle G. i. intermedia, it is, nevertheless, this bird that is the well-known Greater
Hill Mynah of the bird trade, and the one which is imported into this country in
considerable numbers every year.
" Greater Hill Mynah " is, in fact, one of those " popular " bird names that is also
applied to the Southern Grackle religiosa (which, according to Mr. Fooks, is very
seldom brought over) as weil as to the much larger j.javana from Malaya, which can
be recognized at once by its superior size alone, and is, also, by no means freely
imported.
Our mistake, therefore, lay in supposing that our birds were religiosa --though
actually this and i. intermedia are so alike that it takes an expert on Indian birds to

BREEDING OF " BUTTON QUAIL "

I certainly owe all readers an apology for not including the scientific name of this
species that I called "Button Quail". I fully intended to include it in the letter
published in the January-February number of the Magazine but simply neglected
to do so.
To make matters worse, I discovered, after verifying the scientific name, that
this species, which we in Southern California commonly call " Button Quail ", is not
of the same genus as those birds that are generally known as the Button Quails.
The true Button Quails are of the genus Turnix and Coturnix. My quail, which I
wrote about, would more correctly be called Pigmy Quail or Chinese Painted Quail
since they are the Excalfactoria chinensis.
It is little wonder that some readers got a headache trying to determine what
bird I was talking about. I certainly did my share towards confusing the nomen-

By D. M. Reid-Henry (Woodford Green, Essex, England)
The Family Pittidae is widely spread over Southern and South-
Eastern Asia, New Guinea, Borneo, China, Japan, Australia, the
Polynesian Islands, and in the case of two species, Central and Eastern
Africa. All the species are birds of striking beauty, and are mostly
adorned with shining blue rumps and wing-butts. They are all
birds of deep forested country where they spend most of their time on
the ground or amongst the tangled undergrowth in humid, warm
conditions. They are all migratory to some extent, although this may
be purely from a higher altitude of country to the warmer forests of
the foothills. All have stumpy tails and long, powerful legs and feet.
The common Bengal Pitta, Pitta brachyura (Linn.)--a picture of
which accompanies this article--is much more like the thrushes in
shape and physiology than others of the family, and for this reason
it is sometimes termed the Painted Thrush. It is a fairly common bird,
but is more often met with during its migration flights than at other
times. Its habit of staying within dense forest makes the visual recording
of the bird rather infrequent, but during the migrations in autumn
and spring they turn up in all sorts of odd places and may be observed
closely on occasion. In several instances where I have seen this bird,
it has come into dwelling houses and has been caught as a result.
I had one specimen brought to me in Calcutta by the gardener of a
friend who had found the bird hiding in a wood-shed. It lived in
my aviary amongst a very mixed collection of other species for four
months before I released it. During that time, it was rarely seen,
preferring to stay in a thicket of bushes around the bole of a mango
tree, and only coming into view very early in the morning before the
world of men began to stir. At such times I was able to approach
quietly and watch the bird busily turning up rubbish on the aviary
floor in search of grubs. The behaviour in this operation was very
like that of a common Song Thrush, Turdus ericetorum. The bird

cocked his head, listening ; then he would hop forward and stab
down in the dead leaves, throwing them to one side, and then take a
short hop backward, in order to get a full view of the resulting dis-
turbance of the ground. I used to pay a crippled man a few annas
to catch grasshoppers and other interesting items of bird food, and these
the pitta learned to expect. He was very agile in chasing a lively
insect, and would dash around with wings half spread until he caught
it. I never remembered his running or even walking at any other time :
his progress over the ground normally was by means of very long
jumps, interspersed with short periods of standing alert and upright,
with frequent bobbing of the tail.
Outside the breeding season these birds are very solitary in their
habits and they tolerate no intrusion upon their territories by other
pittas, but the two that I kept in Calcutta never seemed to pay the
slightest attention to any other bird in the aviaries except to try and
fight each other. The other one here mentioned was a Hooded Pitta,
Pitta cucullatus, which I bought in the market for five rupees, or about
seven shillings and sixpence ! I let him go because of this constant
desire to fight, and although they were kept separate, I feared their
condition would suffer if the temptation remained too long.
In captivity, pittas need a good supply of live food in addition to a
reliable insectivorous mixture. Clean water is essential at all times,
and the floor of the aviary or cage must consist of moist, dead leaves,
moss or some such matter, but never clay or any soil which will clog
when wet, or bake hard when dry. All writers who have kept these
birds have laboured this point, but it is well to mention it again,
because the feet are the most sensitive part of the bird, and if not
carefully watched, they are the starting point of a general degeneration
in the bird's condition, almost always resulting in death. A moss-
covered log on the ground is the best perch by day, but they roost
usually high up, often on some exposed branch, where, unfortunately,
they are easily disturbed by nocturnal raiders. It is well, therefore,
if a bird shows such a preference, either to move the perch under some
roof cover, or to replace it with an evergreen bush.
Mr. Boosey in his Foreign Bird Keeping says of this species that
it is by far the most commonly imported into Europe, but I only
remember seeing a few in England. Most of the pittas that I have seen
here have been the P. cucullatus.
Perhaps the best quality attaching to these birds is the philosophical
way they accept captivity. All my own experience--which is not very
much !--seems to indicate that whilst they certainly like to skulk
under dense cover, they do not appear to go wildly crashing at the wire
upon the slightest alarm, and if forced to live in close contact with
human beings they settle down remarkably quickly to a sane acceptance
of their lot.

The nest is a rather large ball of grasses, moss, dead leaves, and other
material, with an entrance hole in the side. It is placed in a hollow
amongst the vegetation in a bank side, or amongst the roots of a tree,
or even in a higher position. The eggs are nearly spherical in shape,
white with blotches and streaks of dark brown, maroon, and slate
with a glossy texture when freshly laid. Both adult birds take a share
of the tasks of nest-building, incubation, and brooding of the young,
but the latter are left to fend for themselves soon after leaving the nest.

BREEDING OF THE NEW ZEALAND KEA

The large Mountain Parrot of New Zealand is especially noted in
natural history books because of its reputation for killing sheep. Its
special dietary need for mutton fat appears to have been a good deal
exaggerated, as we have exhibited this species for a period of ten years
without a trace of mutton tallow in its diet and it has been in perfect
health.
The first successful breeding in captivity of this species in the
United States was achieved this year in the Zoological Gardens of
San Diego, California, when a chick was hatched on 20th February,
1958-
After a search we find only one other published record of captive
breeding in this species. Mr. Sydney Porter, F.Z.S., hatched and
reared a Kea in his private aviaries on his estate, The White Gates,
Stenson Road, Derby, England, in 1946.
The Kea was first discovered by Mr. Walter Mantell in 1856, in
the Murihiku district in South Island, New Zealand, according to
Gould, Proc. #ool. Soc., London , 1856, p. 94 (Nestor notabilis , Murihiku).
The haunts of the Kea, or Mountain Parrot, are the high, precipitous
craggy mountain ranges, glistening with perpetual snow and ice, in
the southern part of South Island.
The plumage of the Kea is a dull olive-green with dark edges to the
feathers. The rump and under wing-coverts are tinged with red. The
nose cere is partly covered with hairy feathers. The tongue has a
hair-like fringe at the tip.
Its natural food includes vegetables and small animals as well as
insects and their larvae, and worms. Of fruits, it eats the mountain

roots of mountain plants. The roots of ranunculus, aciphylla, celmisia,
and chrysobactron are especially sought out.
Sunflower seed, whole corn, whole wheat, peanuts, pine nuts, apples,
oranges, carrots, sweet potatoes, lettuce, cabbage, fresh corn on the
cob, and bread make up its captive diet. Cuttlefish bone is fed in the
breeding season as a source of calcium.
Characteristics of the Kea are its uncanny intelligence and its
playfulness. It is often so boisterous as to earn a mischievous and
destructive reputation. Its cry, generally heard in the early morning,
has been aptly compared to the mewing of a cat, but at other times
it utters a whistle, or a suppressed scream when alarmed. The mode
of locomotion on level ground is also interesting and differs from most
parrots in that it consists of a hopping rather than a walking movement.
In size, the Kea may be compared to a Raven, its total length being
16 inches, of which 2 inches is taken up by the narrow hawk-like
beak. The tail measures 6J inches in this species.
The normal clutch of eggs is three to four, white and granulated,
and the incubation period twenty-nine days. Our nestling was covered
with long, grey-coloured down. Its lower mandible is yellow with a
black tip ; the upper mandible and bare skin on face is yellow; the
feet dark grey with black claws.
The hatching of our chick follows ten years of continued effort to
induce our pair to breed.
The close brooding of hen Kea parrots makes observation of the
nesting activities most difficult, and we wish it were possible to give a
more detailed report.

By S. T. Johnstone (Slimbridge, Glos., England)
Among the more interesting recent arrivals at Slimbridge have
been three male and four female Australian White-eye (. Aythya australis)
which we believe are the first birds of this species to be imported into
Great Britain. In silhouette they resemble the Common White-eye
(.Aythya nyroca) , but are larger and coarser. Their colour is closely akin
to that of the female Rosybill (JVetta peposaca ). The male's eye is white
and there is a pronounced light bar across the tip of the rather long
bill; this is less apparent in the female. Both sexes have white under
tail-coverts. The birds were flown over and arrived in excellent
condition ; they will be out of quarantine in mid-May.
A further species new to Slimbridge is represented by a male of the
parasitic Black-headed Duck (. Heteronetta atricapilla) , kindly presented
to us by Dr. Lang, of Basle Zoo. This little bird does not closely resemble
any other species and does not appear to be at all like the Stifftails
to which it is nevertheless probably related. It is particularly aquatic
and when on land has a peculiar " down-at-the-bows " gait ; whether
this is characteristic of the species, or a condition of this particular
bird is not yet certain.
We have now obtained four male Scoter ( Melanitta n. nigra ) to
join the five females which have been at Slimbridge for more
than a year. The birds, although only recently wild-caught in Holland,
have settled down well and are already displaying.
The breeding season is some two or three weeks later than in 1957
and so far only fifty species have nested. These include Bewick's Swan
(&amp;lt;Cygnus columbianus bewickii ), Ne-ne ( Branta sandvicensis) , Ringed Teal
(Anas leucophrys ), and Common Goldeneye (Bucephala c. clangula).
Twenty-one Ne-ne goslings have been hatched and at present nineteen
of these are surviving. There are now fifty-three Ne-ne at Slimbridge
and twelve others in various collections outside Hawaii, all descended
from the three original birds sent to the Trust in 1952. The total
world population is believed to stand at about 150, of which about
forty are wild.

By Edward J. Boosey (Keston, Kent, England)
I had been meaning for some time to write an article on some
of the rarer birds we have at the Keston Foreign Bird Farm, and was
finally spurred on to do so by the recent arrival of no fewer than a
dozen Fire-tailed Finches (#onaeginthus bellus )--the first we have ever
had and certainly the most rarely-imported of all the Australian
Finches.
I did not realize quite how seldom they have been brought over
until I happened to mention their arrival to John Yealland, Curator
of Birds at the London Zoo, and he told me that he had not seen any
for quite thirty years, and that he believes ours may be the first
importation since then. The ones he was referring to had belonged to
the late Duke of Bedford, and Mr. Yealland tells me that although
they went to nest, they failed to rear any young ones.
Dr. Butler in his Foreign Finches in Captivity wrote of these
Finches : " The London Zoological Society purchased a pair of this
species on 24th May, 1870, and recorded them under the name of
Red-tailed Finches ; this was probably the first living pair kept in
confinement in Europe . . . ."
In the Avicultural Magazine, New Series, Vol. VIII (1908-9),
page 170, Mr. Seth-Smith in " Notes on the Crystal Palace Bird Show "
wrote : " Mr. Maxwell had yet another rare exhibit in a pair of
Fire-tailed Finches (#onaeginthus bellus ). These little birds are extremely
rare here, and these are the first I remember seeing at a Show." So
it would seem that this little Finch not only is, but always has been a
genuine avicultural rarity.
The Fire-tail is of much the same size and build as the Sydney
Waxbill, and I think it must be said at once that compared with other
Australian Grass Finches, it is not a very exciting little bird to look
at, which, in addition to its costliness, is probably one of the reasons
why it has so seldom been brought over. Its chief habitat is Tasmania,
although it also occurs in South Australia.
A very brief description is, that it is mouse-coloured, darkest on
the upper surface and tail--the latter being almost black--as is the
ventral area--and paler and greyer below, the feathers all being
minutely bordered with black, giving a wavy striped effect which can
only be appreciated if one sees the bird very close to. There is a narrow
frontal band of black, widening out on the side of the head and
surrounding the eye, which is narrowly encircled with bare skin of a pale
blue-grey colour. The scarlet upper tail-coverts provide the only touch
of bright colour, and the beak is dark red. They are not particularly
easy birds to sex, the only apparent difference being that the black
area round the eye is less extensive in some than in others, and we

have picked out what we hope to be three true pairs and have given
them one of our new range of planted breeding aviaries to themselves.
A very knowledgeable Australian aviculturist who recently visited our
Bird Farm, and who has had great experience in the keeping of their
native finches, gave me some first-hand information about Fire-tails.
He confirmed that they are mainly Tasmanian but are also found in
South Australia and said that over there they are considered difficult
and delicate birds in captivity, and he thought we were lucky to have
received our consignment mostly in such good condition, and to have
had only three losses among them. We showed him the three pairs
in their breeding aviary and he remarked upon their fitness and the
fact they were carrying nesting material.
He also told me about the other race of the Fire-tailed Finch
(Z- oculatus) which comes from his part of the country (Western
Australia) ; which he has kept ; and which he described as " even
more difficult " than #. bellus , but considerably more beautiful,
having a patch of red behind the ear with the lower breast and belly
white-spotted on a dark background, and being found always in the
vicinity of streams, and disliking arid country. Incidentally, Aviculture ,
Vol. i, gives the habitat of oculatus as South-east Australia, but my
Australian informant assures me that it is a native of Western Australia.
Another rarity of which we received about a dozen in faultless
condition, two pairs of which we are retaining for breeding purposes,
is the Red-faced Finch ( Pytelia afra ) from Eastern Africa. It is the
first time we have ever had them at Keston, and they are described in
Aviculture , Vol. i, as being " very rare
The male has the crown, nape, and throat grey, and the face mask
bright red. The mantle is bronze tinged with olive and the wings are
bronze merging into orange at the lower edge. The rump is bright red
and the tail dark red. The under parts are pale greenish-grey, the
white borders of the feathers giving a wavy white-striped effect, and
the area round the vent is white. The beak is red. The female is
altogether paler and greyer, lacks the red face mask, and the beak
instead of being red is dark grey, so they are very easy birds to sex.
There is a strong resemblance between this bird and the well-
known Melba Finch ( Pytelia melba ) and until about 1870 there was
considerable confusion between the two species, at which time they
were sorted out and the Red-faced Finch was given the additional
name of " Wiener's Astrild ", Pytelia wieneri.
Another rare species we have consists of a pair of Purple Grenadier
Waxbills (Granatina ianthinogaster roosevelti) from Kenya, which is
closely related to the well-known South African Violet-eared Waxbill,
from which, however, it differs in various respects, including its rather
larger size. In the male the chief differences are that the cheek patches
are small and cobalt-blue rather than mauve, and instead of the breast

<bodyText confidence="0.998000111111111" page_id="56311176"  page_num="114" year="" vol="">
being chestnut, it is of a rich purple-violet. Unfortunately, however,
the bird's appearance is somewhat marred by the fact that this rich
hue of the breast and abdomen is unevenly blotched with patches of
dark chestnut--which makes it, to my mind, rather less beautiful
than the Violet-ear.
The female is quite distinct, being various warm shades of brown
prettily speckled in places with buff and whitish, with the tail blackish
and the rump blue.
We have had our pair since last May and they have just been returned
to their aviary after having spent the winter in a flight cage in a warm
bird-room. The cock has been no trouble at all but the hen has given
us several anxious moments, so it would seem that--as is markedly
the case with Violet-ears--the males are hardier than the females.
Other rarely-imported Waxbills we have are Sundervall's ( Estrilda
rhodopyga rhodopyga) from Abyssinia and the Yellow-bellied ( Coccopygia
melanotis quartinia ) from Ethiopia.
Sundervall's Waxbill differs from the common Red-eared in being
of a rather warmer brownish hue and in having a black instead of a
red beak. Also there is a touch of red on the wings.
The male Yellow-bellied Waxbill, having no black on the face,
is hardly distinguishable from a female Dufresnes except for its quite
extensive patch of yellow on the belly. The female is a duller edition
of the male.
The Golden-bellied Grosbeak ( Pheucticus aureoventris ) from South
America is a species we have never had before, and is very striking.
The male is mainly black with the characteristic white spots and
markings on the wings and tail. This sombre garb, however, makes a
wonderful foil for the shoulders, lower breast, and belly, all of which are
brilliant yellow. The bill is gunmetal colour. The female is dark
blackish-brown above and yellowish below.
This very handsome bird is one of the largest of the Grosbeaks,
though not quite so big as the Yellow-mantled Grosbeak (P. chryso-
peplus) a single male of which we had at Keston before the war.
Our pair have just been put into our large pond aviary and I recently
noticed them carrying nesting material.
Other Grosbeaks we have and from which we hope to breed this
season are the Evening ( Hesperiphona vespertina) and that very handsome
bird and delicious songster the Rose-breasted Grosbeak (^amelodia
ludoviciana).
The Evening Grosbeaks went to nest and hatched a brood last
season but the young ones were removed from the nest and killed by,
I think, a pair of Shamas in the same enclosure.
We recently had a single specimen each of two different species
which should be included here, as I should think they have probably
never been imported before. They were here for some time, but there

was no point in keeping them as there did not seem the remotest
chance of ever getting a mate for either of them.
The Yellow-striped Anaplectes was rather like a small edition of a
Green Cardinal, but without a crest, and with a yellow stripe above
and below the eye. It was identified for us by the British Museum,
who informed us that they possess only a single skin of this species.
The Many-coloured Ground Finch or Ground Sparrow ( Saltatricula
multicolor ) rather resembled, on a much smaller scale, an Orange-
billed Saltator ( Saltator aurantiirostris) , being slate grey above, paler
and more buffish below, with a whitish streak above the eye, and with,
I think, some black on the sides of the head and throat. It was only
" many-coloured " in the sense that it was more colourful than a
House Sparrow. Both birds are South American--I believe from
Argentina.
A rarely-imported bird, of which we have a pair, is the Blue-headed
Pigeon (or Dove) Starnoenas cyanocephala from Cuba. This is more or
less a Ground Pigeon, and although I usually prefer the perching kinds,
I have always admired this bird because of its very striking and unusual
colouring. It is dark chocolate brown, the crown of the head being
rich cobalt blue bordered by a black line which passes through the
eye. There is a broad white band which passes from the chin, below
the eye to the back of the head. A large black patch on the throat
is bordered at the lower edge by a semi-circular white stripe and tipped
with blue at the sides. The crop area has a delicate mauve sheen upon
it. It is rather stockily-built with a shortish tail, and the female is
slightly smaller and slimmer than her mate.
The Blue-headed Pigeon has been bred in confinement on more than
one occasion, the first apparently being in London, in 1870. Its
numbers in a wild state would seem to be dwindling, for in Aviculture ,
Vol. Ill, we read : " With the cutting of the forests in Cuba and
planting of sugar-cane their natural habitat there is being gradually
eliminated and the birds are becoming more scarce each year, so this
is another case of trying to prolong the life of the species by breeding in
captivity. 55
Decoux states that, although hardy enough in themselves, it is
necessary give them slightly heated quarters in winter as their feet
are very apt to get frost-bitten. The Blue-headed Pigeon eats mainly
seeds and grain, but it is also partial to gentles, of which, however, a
limited quantity only should be given.
To turn now to Softbills : Perhaps the rarest, or at any rate most
rarely-imported, couple we have is a pair of Canadian Mountain Blue
Robins ( Sialia curricoides ) which we purchased from Kenneth Norris
who has had such remarkable breeding success with this species.
The male is a delicate shade of powder blue above, brightest on the
rump, tail, and wings, the under surface being pale bluish-grey,

faintly mottled with very light cafe-au-lait colour. The female is
slate grey merging into blue on the rump.
They are delightful birds in every way, being particularly graceful
on the wing and in all their movements. Despite their name there is
little of the Robin about them, and in both shape and carriage they
remind me much more of a Wheatear. Their staple diet consists of
gentles with a few mealworms and they eat a certain amount of in-
sectivorous mixture, so they are not difficult to cater for.
The White-capped Redstart ( Chaimarrhornis leucocephalus ) from
India is a most attractive aviary inhabitant, very active and constantly
bobbing its tail up and down Wagtail-fashion. It is a bird of the
Himalayan mountain streams and torrents and has much the same
habits as our Dipper, flying swiftly from boulder to boulder and
remaining always in the vicinity of running water. Consequently, to
breed them even in a large planted aviary would, I think, be a con-
siderable feat.
It is easily described, being black with snow-white crown and having
the rump, lower half of the breast and the abdomen rich chestnut,
the tail is chestnut, tipped with black. They are not always easy
birds to sex, although our pair are fairly obvious as the male is more
stockily built and rather larger than his mate, and has a considerably
wider and more extensive white crown.
The Silver-eared Mesia ( Mesia argentauris ) which also comes from
the Himalayas is in every respect so very much a glorified edition
of a Pekin Robin, that it seems odd that they should not both share
the same generic name of Liothrix. A brief description is that the head
is black with a yellow forehead and silvery grey cheeks and the back
is grey, the tail being black with red upper and under tail-coverts.
The throat is orange merging through yellow into olive green on the
breast and abdomen. The wings are marked with red and orange
and the beak is yellow. The female is rather less brightly-coloured than
the male. The Silver-eared Mesia is a delightful little bird with all
the charm and vivacity of a Pekin Robin and the same joyful liquid
song--only rather louder.
Two more of our new aviaries contain a single pair of birds each--\0x25A0
namely Superb Spreo Starlings and Amethyst Starlings. I always think
the Superb Spreo {Spreo superbus) in its glittering garb of metallic green
and blue set off by bright chestnut on the under parts is perhaps
the most beautiful of the Glossy Starlings with the exception of that
wonderful creature the Abyssinian Royal Starling, which we used
to have before the war, but which nowadays never seems to be brought
over.
Very beautiful too are the Amethyst Starlings ( Cinnyricinclus ) but
they always strike me as being very un-starling-like in their behaviour
and in some ways remind one more of the thrush family. The male

has a lovely colour combination, the head and the whole of the upper
surface being shining purplish-red with a high metallic gloss, while
the under parts are pure white. The female is totally different being
very like a small Song Thrush.
Our pair passed the winter in an aviary with a heated shelter,
and for some reason or other fell into a heavy second moult in March.
They are now (May) over the moult and are starting to come into
breeding condition.
We obtained several Malayan Black-headed Yellow Bulbuls
(Otocompsa flaviventris) and have kept what we hope to be a true pair
to breed from--they have apparently never been bred. They are
olive yellow-green with a black head and crest and both sexes are
alike. I cannot say I admire their colour scheme as to my mind they
would be much prettier birds if they were either yellow or green
instead of being neither one nor the other, but a dirty yellow colour
which the black of the head and crest does nothing to enliven. However,
I think any shortcomings in their appearance are made up for by their
very sweet voices. They seem rather quarrelsome both among them-
selves and with other birds.
We also have a pair of Japanese Blue Flycatchers (Cyanoptila cyano -
melana) which are found also in China but migrate for the winter
to Indo-China and Malaya. The male is dark blue with the sides of
the head, throat, and upper half of the breast black. The lower half
of the breast and the abdomen are pure white. The shoulders and tail
are rich blue and the crown is brilliant shining cobalt. Altogether
they are very like a Niltava in their shape and movements and are
about the same size as N. sundara. They are not easy birds to sex
but if our couple are a true pair--as they are supposed to be--the
only difference seems to be that the male has a rather larger, flatter
head and a slightly wider more extensive blue crown. They are most
delightful and beautiful aviary inhabitants, and are to my mind one
of the nicest of all the Flycatcher family.
I have purposely left to the last one of the most charming birds
we have ever had, and to my mind a creature of surpassing beauty--
namely a Mauve-breasted or Long-tailed Roller (Corarias caudata)
which was kindly sent to us by a friend in South Africa. I should say
it was obviously hand-reared as it is very tame and greets one's
appearance with much spreading of its glorious blue wings accompanied
by its loud chattering, barking cry. It will take food from one's
fingers and will occasionally let me stroke it but it has a rooted objection
to sitting on one's hand.
Our bird is said to be a male and a brief description is as follows :
The back is khaki-brown and the large, bushy head of a delicate shade
of greyish sage-green with some whitish round the beak and above the
eye. The throat and upper half of the breast are rich purplish-mauve,

the lower breast, abdomen, and under surface of the tail being pale
sky blue. The wings are deep sky blue merging into glossy purplish-
violet on the shoulders. Perhaps the bird's chief glory is its flight
feathers which are royal blue of a wonderful depth and richness.
The outermost tail feather on each side is much elongated which
gives the bird its name.
Beautiful as this Roller is in repose, it is even more so in flight,
and to see it on the wing is a quite unforgettable experience. It looks
for all the world like some huge tropical butterfly with azure and
purple wings bordered with dark blue ; and the butterfly illusion
is heightened by the nature of its flight and its complete soundlessness,
which doubtless, owl-fashion, enables it to pounce unheard upon its
prey. Our bird soon selected a favourite branch in the aviary and
delights the eye by frequently making circular flights round it before
returning to the same vantage point.
In a wild state Rollers live exclusively upon the larger insects.
Beetles are particular favourites and they doubtless eat small lizards,
etc. as well. Consequently, they must be classed as " difficult " birds in
confinement--particularly in the case of wild-caught specimens
which it must take some time to accustom to anything but a purely
live diet, and indeed I have been told that they are difficult at first
to get to feed at all.
Our Roller achieved a complete moult in heated quarters in the
depths of winter and is now in fine fettle on a diet which consists
mainly of gentles with a rationed allowance of mealworms, but it
is also fond of hard-boiled egg (the yolk only) and minced raw meat.
It will occasionally take a little bread and milk, but refuses to eat
insectivorous mixture. Delacour, who has probably had more
experience than any other aviculturist with Rollers in captivity,
recommends cheese with its high protein value as part of their diet,
but our bird unfortunately refuses to sample it.

(Oriolus xanthornus )
By the Rev. B. C. R. Henry (Orissa, India)
Sub-species of Black-headed Oriole occur in S.E. Asia, but they
differ only in detail. Habits and general appearance are similar.
In many parts of India these birds are common, and in some localities
occur much more frequently than the Golden Oriole.
The birds are found singly or in pairs in plains and low hills, but
always in localities where large, leafy trees abound, such as mango,
tamarind, and the various types of fig ; and they are resident. Unlike
the Golden Oriole, male and female of this species have similar
colouring, though on close inspection the latter is seen to be less brilliant.
The bright golden-yellow is effectively contrasted by a jet-black head,
giving these birds a gorgeous appearance. The beak is deep pink,
eyes are crimson-red, and the legs grey.
Black-headed Orioles are noisy and persistent in their calls. The
call is made at regular intervals from sunrise till sunset while in search
of food. One of the commonest sounds is a loud whistle like " kit to ",
descending in scale and lasting only half a second ; another is a
melodious rolling call of several syllables, " i-kew-kittew-kew" almost
monotonously uttered by mate to mate.
Food consists of caterpillars, insects, and small fruit such as figs
and tamarind. It is rare to see the birds resting for they always seem
to be preoccupied with the quest of food. I have never seen them on
the ground. When one tree is exhausted they fly to another with strong,
undulating flight, flashing their beautiful yellow against a green back-
ground of trees.
The breeding season is from April till about August. Nests are made
of fibres, small twigs, cobwebs, and lichen, slung deep between forked
twigs in a shady tree. About three eggs are laid, creamy or pale pink
in colour, with brown or purplish spots here and there.
Black-headed Orioles--like other Orioles--apparently do not take
to cages and are seldom kept successfully in confinement. As with
many birds their beauty is mainly reserved for those who can watch
them in their natural haunts, for whom the sunlit flash of gold among
the trees always brings a thrill of delight.

The breeding in captivity of the Gough Island Moorhen ( Porphy -
riornis comeri) has already been described in the Magazine (Vol. 64,
No. 2) by Messrs. Wilson and Swales. Of the birds sent to the Zoo-
logical Society by the Gough Island Scientific Survey in May, 1956,
one pair was sent on loan to the Department of Zoology at Cambridge,
another was put into the Great Aviary here, and a third into the large
Waders' Aviary. This last pair built a nest that autumn, making it
in a privet hedge at about five feet from the ground, but no eggs were
laid. No nesting took place during 1957, but this spring the Great
Aviary pair built a nest on the ground in a shelter and hatched two
chicks of which one survives and is growing well. The chick is exactly
as already described and the parents have been very attentive. The
only identifiable food that I have seen being offered to the chick is the
seeding heads of grass, and the chick has been seen to eat pieces of grass
blade. What appeared to be the small white petals of a Pyracantha
shrub have been picked up by one parent and taken from its bill by
the chick.
The other pair has built a nest some fifteen feet from the ground in
a willow, but because of the difficulty of looking into the nest, it is
not known what goes on.
The tameness of the Madingley birds has been mentioned : they
were, on arrival from Gough Island, noticeably unafraid of people.
Greater Black-backed Gulls and others, including Silver Gulls,
have young, and Swinhoe's Pheasant and Black-breasted Kalij
chicks are thriving. The two Cereopsis goslings are now almost fully
grown.
The Snowy Owls' first clutch of eggs failed to hatch and a second has
been or is being laid. Three King Penguin eggs have been laid and a
Superb Glossy Starling has been bred at the Bird House.
A pair of Southern White-breasted Crakes, Later alius ( Creciscus )
leucopyrrhus , a pair of Red-crested Finches and two Nonpareil Buntings
have been presented by Mr. G. H. Newmark. The Crake has been in
the Collection only once before when Mr. G. Durrell brought one from
South America. Another species exhibited here only once before is the
Varied Thrush, Hesperocichla ( Ixoreus) n. naevia, of which Mr. E. G.
Kinsey has given a pair. There are two races of this species, the other
(//. n. meruloides) having a more northerly range in western North
America.
Other presentations include four Black-footed Penguins (Mr. R. J. F.
Horsham), a White-crested Cockatoo (Miss D. B. Carsons), a pair of
Dufresne's Waxbills (Mr. J. R. Newmark), and a Common Babbler
(Gapt. R. S. de Q,. Quincey). Two Bar-headed Geese have been
received in exchange.

A Blue-crowned Hanging Parrakeet has died after ten years in the
Parrot House. No doubt there is nothing remarkable about this span
of life, though I suspect that few others have lived so long in this country,
but what is interesting is that this bird lived and remained in good
condition on a diet of canary seed, millet, and fruit. The seed kernel
was always carefully rendered almost to flour before being swallowed.
Possibly the kernels of fruit seeds are sometimes eaten by these birds.
There were a few grains of grit in the stomach.

The Annual Report, 1957, of the Royal Zoological Society of
Scotland, gives the 1957 breeding results for the Penguins. " Of the
Kings eleven pairs mated and eleven eggs were laid, but unfortunately
the majority proved to be sterile and only one chick was reared to
maturity. On the other hand, the Gentoos reared eight chicks from
ten eggs, which is a record for this species."

Eighty-five members and guests accepted the invitation of the
President and Council of the North of England Zoological Society
to visit the Zoological Gardens, Chester, on 19th June, 1958. The
President of the Society, Mr. G. B. Groundsell, presided at the lunch
and welcomed the visitors. Dr. Edward Hindle thanked the President
and Council on behalf of our members.
The weather was atrocious, but the Director-Secretary, Mr. G. S.
Mottershead, Mrs. Mottershead and, indeed the entire staff, were
tireless in their efforts to make the visitors as comfortable as possible.
The warmest thanks of all are accorded to them for a very enjoyable

Squadron-Leader C. Everitt reports concerning his Black-crested
Finches : " My first young one has now (29th May) been out of the
nest twelve days, and the parents are on more eggs. This is the earliest
I have ever had them breed for it was only three days after being
released in to the open flight that the hen laid the first egg. This egg
was clear but the second resulted in the young one I now have flying.
A curious fact has revealed itself in that the youngsters do not assume
adult plumage until their second moult. I thought I had retained a
hen I bred last June, so I obtained another cock so as to introduce
fresh blood. My ' hen 5 is now gradually changing colour--with no
signs of a moult--and is a cock. The changing is more or less identical
to that experienced in the British Pied Flycatcher. I shall definitely
not dispose of any of my youngsters this year but wait until I do know
for sure what sex they are. 53

THE USE OF ANTIBIOTICS IN THE TREATMENT OF
ENTERITIS IN GREENFINCHES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998968045454545" page_id="56311189"  page_num="123" year="" vol="">
Referring to the chapter, " Breeding records of British Birds for 1957," by Hylton
Blythe, in the March-April issue of the Magazine, I should like to make one or two
comments on the suggestions put forward in the Breeding Records Review, by T. G.
Taylor, on methods to combat losses in young Greenfinches.
Though I myself have kept and bred Greenfinches and other British birds I can
only claim to be very much a layman on this subject and such birds I have had have
been filling in space with the foreigners. It is, however, the subject of enteritis and
its extermination on which I wish to remark.
Dr. Taylor suggests the addition of certain antibiotics--terramycin, aureomycin,
etc., to the feed of Greenfinches and this would probably provide a solution in some
cases, but I am not too happy about his recommendation to add three or four times
the level advised by the makers. Admittedly a Greenfinch's intake of soft food is
probably only one-third or one-quarter of the total dry matter consumed but it
must be remembered that makers' recommendations for the feeding level of these
antibiotics vary with the type of animal concerned. For example, Aurofac 2A
(aureomycin) is fed at a rate of 3 lb. per ton of feed for table chickens (roasters,
boilers, etc.), whereas for turkeys (poults, fatteners, etc.) the feeding level is 5 lb.
per ton. A turkey therefore, the larger bird, requires a higher intake level in relation
to its size than does a chicken. May it not then be that a Greenfinch would require
a lower intake in relation to its size than does a chicken--in which case feeding
three to four times the amount recommended for a chicken would not necessarily bring
about the correct level of feeding for a Greenfinch. This, however, is a point which the
makers could probably clarify.
Dr. Taylor suggests sulphamezathine as an alternative to antibiotics for combatting
enteritis and here, I feel, is the better method. I am a little surprised at his remark
that a veterinary prescription is needed for this solution. Sulphamezathine is generally
used as a 16 per cent solution for poultry, etc., but is also made at a strength of
33 # per cent for use as an injection for all forms of bacterial enteritis in farm stock.
Sulphamezathine is a trade name for sulphadimidine--sodium solution--and though
a veterinary prescription may be required for sulphamezathine 33 # per cent, sulpha-
dimidine 33 1 per cent can be obtained without.
It is presumably the 16 per cent solution of sulphamezathine to which Dr. Taylor
refers in his remarks and this can be readily obtained in bottles of 4 oz., 20 oz., and
80 oz. from most chemists, without a veterinary surgeon's prescription, although a
signature should be given as the drug is a poison.
The 16 per cent solution has in the past proved effective for enteritis in Budgerigars,
parrakeets, and parrots, etc., and should prove to be so for Greenfinches.
Perhaps the best of any of the antibiotics and drugs for oral treatment in com-
batting enteritis is soluble terramycin and this, to the best of my knowledge, is obtain-
able only on prescription.
Dr. Taylor's efforts in this field should be welcomed by aviculturists generally
as there are probably few who escape enteritis in their stock at some time or another
and it will be interesting to hear reports on the results of his suggestions by those
breeders who follow his advice.

THE LOSS OF RED COLOUR BY BIRDS IN CAPTIVITY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9995026" page_id="56311189"  page_num="123" year="" vol="">
In his last article Mr. Risdon remarked : " I do wish that some of our experts
could really get down to discovering what it is that causes birds to lose their red
or orange in captivity "--and I could not agree with him more--it would be wonderful
indeed if the cure or, better still, the prevention of this could be discovered.
It certainly seems to affect insectivorous or partially insectivorous species chiefly,

but it is difficult to lay down any hard and fast rule, except that it never , so far as I
know, affects psittacine birds. Even gorgeous creatures like the Red and Yellow
and Blue and Red Macaws retain their brilliance quite undimmed on a frugal diet
of seeds, nuts, and fruit, as do the many parrots and parrakeets with red in their
plumage. The nectar-feeding Lories and Lorikeets retain their red and orange
perfectly, yet the Red Sunbird, and I rather fancy the Scarlet-breasted as well--
both also nectar-feeders--lose their red in confinement.
The Orange Weaver, a seed-eater, fades after a moult in captivity ; for, despite
its name, it is not, when newly-imported, orange and black at all, but the most vivid
geranium red and black, without a trace of yellow or orange. Another seed-eating
" fader " is the Pin-tailed Nonpareil--so beautiful with its crimson breast patch when
first imported, but such a dull travesty of itself when this has faded to straw-colour.
And the same, of course, applies to the Nonpareil Bunting.
Of the Cardinals, only the Virginian's colour fades in confinement, while the Pope,
the Red-creasted, and the Yellow-billed (also the Rose-breasted Grosbeak), retain
the red areas in their plumage.
Two of the most disappointing insectivorous species are the Scarlet and Short-
billed Minivets. In their importation plumage of blue-black and brilliant red, few
birds are lovelier, but after a moult when the scarlet has faded to salmon-pink, their
appearance is entirely spoilt. And the same is apt to apply to Scarlet Tanagers,
although I have found that soya flour in their insectivorous mixture tends to keep
their colour, and Mr. Risdon says he finds that colour feeding helps. Other prevent-
atives of colour-loss I have been recommended include beetroot mixed with the food
and a plentiful supply of blackberries when the birds are moulting. Red-eared and
Red-vented Bulbuls--both insectivorous--keep their red, as do the partially in-
sectivorous Military Starling and Red-breasted Marsh bird.
The puzzling thing seems to be that--with the total exception of the psittacines--
some species in each group or family of birds retain their red in captivity, while others,
for no apparent reason, lose it.
What a literally red letter day it would be if some brilliant scientist would
temporarily forsake his research for a bigger and better bomb large enough to blow
the entire Universe to pieces, and would concentrate instead upon the much more
worth-while problem of how to keep our Scarlet Minivets, Ibises, and Tanagers--
scarlet !

COCK GOLDEN PHEASANT BROODING EGGS AND YOUNG
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.982929611111111" page_id="56311190"  page_num="124" year="" vol="">
I have bred Golden Pheasants for a number of years, and something rather unusual
happened this year, so I wonder if the following notes will be of interest.
I keep a trio of Goldens (5 years old) in a large planted aviary and for 3 years
running one of the hens has hatched and reared a brood, together with the other hen
and cock. The same hen has done likewise this year, but owing to various accidents,
etc., she now has only three chicks left. During the time this hen was sitting the other
hen was laying, and as I was busy with my other birds I did not bother to collect the
eggs, as I have never had egg eating trouble with these Pheasants.
After feeding these birds for several days I noticed that the cock was missing,
so I went into the shelter to investigate. On doing so, I found him sitting on six of
the eggs I had left in the aviary. Although he was moulting he continued sitting for 26
days and only twice did I see him off the nest feeding. On the 26th day I knew the
eggs would not hatch so broke them and found five fully grown dead chicks in them
and the other egg not fertile.
It is now five days since I took the eggs away, and each night I find the cock brooding
either one or two of the three chicks just mentioned--and the hen the remainder--
has this been known of Golden Pheasants before ?

By J. G. Peters (Veterinary Surgeon, Blijdorp Zoo, Rotterdam,
Holland)
The translation of the following account which appeared in Blijdorp
Geluiden , December, 1957, has been made by J. P. G. van Wachem,
Dental Surgeon, Hilversum.
On nth September, 1957, my assistance was requested for an
African Ground Hornbill, a bird which lives mostly on the ground,
which had broken off part of its lower bill. Probably something had
frightened the bird and it had flown against the wire netting.
The part of the bill which had broken off was found in the cage ; it
was cracked longitudinally in several places. The horny bill forms a
sheath round the bony bill, something like the horn of a cow. Between
the bone and horn is a thin layer of cells, which produce the horn, and
it is evident that growth is impossible when this layer is missing. The
Hornbill which takes its prey (in the Zoo small pieces of meat) with
the point of its bill like a pair of pincers, and then throws it up and
catches it in its open bill, cannot feed itself when one of the pincers is
broken off. It would have been possible for it to feed if the upper
bill had been shortened to the same length but then the bird would
have been deformed and in the Zoo we wish to show animals in their
normal state. So I had to try to recover the original condition as far as
possible.
I succeeded in repairing the bill to the extent that the bird could
feed normally, but it was too weak to fulfil this function permanently.
The bill was provisionally strengthened with a metal splint on the
outside but this was not a satisfactory solution and I got in touch with
the Dental Laboratory " Halvax " at Schiedam. First a wax impression
of the lower bill was made and in this a hollow prosthesis of plastic
which was longer than the broken section and could be slipped over

the stump. We retained the stainless steel bone-screw which I had
screwed on the stump to act as a pin for the hollow end, and after a
short treatment of the stump, which first had to heal completely and
be free of infection, the prosthesis was placed on it.
First the hollow prosthesis was filled with fluid plastic and then
fixed in the right position on the stump. In a short time the fluid
plastic hardened and the artificial bill was joined on. The head of the
screw prevented it from slipping off but to be on the safe side two
stainless steel wires were fitted in grooves on both sides of the fracture.
Finally, the exterior was retouched with fluid plastic and polished.
The artificial bill was as firm as a rock and the bird could immediately
eat with it, to the great satisfaction of all concerned. The experiment
was entirely successful and up to the present the Hornbill is in good
health and no way deformed.

Aplopelia larvata larvata (Temminck)
By A. A. Prestwich (Southgate, England)
The specific name larvata , meaning bewitched or enchanted, is
perhaps reasonable : the alternative common names Cinnamon Dove
(not to be confused with the Talpacoti Dove) and Rufous-necked
Wood Dove are both appropriate ; but Lemon Dove is misleading
in the extreme, as it is neither lemon in colour nor, apparently, has it
any partiality to lemon trees. It has, however, been suggested that it is
a misapplication of the Afrikaans name Lemoen-Duifie for the
Laughing Dove.
Levaillant discovered " La Tourterelle a masque blanc 55 in the
Autiniquoi Country, now known as Knysna, Cape Province, about
1782 : and it was first named Columha larvata by Temminck in 1810.
It has an extensive distribution, given by Peters as " Mountain
forests of eastern Africa from the interior of Kenya Colony (north to
Mt. Elgon and Mt. Kenya), southward through Tanganyika Territory
and Nyasaland to Transvaal, Natal and Cape Province ".
Although quite common in the wild state it has been imported into
this country only at very infrequent intervals. The Zoological Society
of London received its first examples on 18th July, 1892, when two
were presented by W. M. Wormald. The Marquess of Tavistock,
writing in 1914, says a consignment reached Woburn about seven years
earlier. They were turned out, withstood a very severe winter without
injury, and the following summer successfully reared young. They
continued to breed and at the time of writing there were four or
five pairs at liberty in the garden. An attempt at aviary breeding
ended in disaster. Then in January, 1927, Cecil Webb brought over
a large and important collection of East African birds for Gamages,
included were some Lemon Doves. I believe Herbert Whitley had a
pair at Primley in 1932. Apart from these I know of no other arrivals,
but there must surely have been some.
This rarely imported South African dove is so little known to
aviculturists that it may be as well to give a brief description of its
appearance :--
" Forehead and front of the face white, becoming a metallic-pink
(or green in some lights) on the crown, occiput, hind neck and
upper portion of the mantle ; rest of the upper surface, including the
wings and two central tail-feathers dark earthy-brown ; lateral tail-
feathers with the basal two-thirds black, the apical third ashy ; below
the chin and cheeks are greyish-white, the breast is pink and slightly

metallic, changing to cinnamon on the lower breast, abdomen and
under tail-coverts ; under wing-coverts, axilliaries and sides of the
body dark-brown. Iris, inner circle dusky, outer pink; eyelids and
bare skin round the eye pink ; bill black ; legs and feet dark-pink "
(Sclater).
Length ioj-n inches.
The female is slightly smaller, duller in colour, has less white on the
face, and lacks much of the metallic sheen.
In the wild state, according to the various observers, this dove is
confined to the forest and thick bush, and is seldom if ever found
outside. It is shy and by no means easy to see in its gloomy surroundings,
but can often be heard rustling among the fallen leaves as it seeks its
food in the debris under trees.
C. F. M. Swynnerton had experience with this dove in captivity
in South Africa and writes : " I have kept as many as thirty of these
Doves in a large aviary at one time, and though they finally lose their
excessive fear of a human being, they remain extremely nervous, a
very slight alarm at night being sufficient to set the whole number in a
senseless flutter. This disturbance, once started, is repeated at frequent
intervals till morning, when two or three of the birds may be found
on the ground in an exhausted condition. They are unusually gentle
and sweet-tempered for Doves, and, were it not for this unfortunate
nervousness, would make excellent pets."
The pair that has now successfully reared two young ones was
imported by our member H. J. Indge. They arrived here on 12th June,
1958, and, as a temporary measure, were put in one of our Fruit
Pigeon wattle-built aviaries. They were both extraordinarily tame,
quite the tamest doves we have ever had, in fact the female was quite
content to sit on one's hand ! They were naturally somewhat travel-
stained and we had no thought of encouraging them to breed : but
they had other ideas. Hanging under the shelter roof was a large,
flat wire basket partially filled with hay and straw. To our surprise,
within a few days they had taken possession and improvised a nest.
Eggs were laid on 19th and 20th June, and sitting commenced from the
laying of the second egg. Both birds took part in the incubation.
Unfortunately this first attempt was not successful. It was noticed that
during 2nd July neither bird was on the nest and it soon became
apparent that they had deserted. To be on the safe side twenty-four
hours were allowed to elapse before the eggs were removed for
examination and measurement. The two creamy-white eggs measured
2 9&amp;apos;5 X 22-9 mm. and 29*4 X 23*5 mm. The former was addled,
but the latter contained a well-developed chick which was still alive.
As a very forlorn hope it was given to a pair of Barbary Doves with
eggs about due to hatch. They took to it at once and such is the will
to live it duly hatched. The chick appeared to be doing well, but during

the night of the third day it died. It is a little doubtful that any
attempt had been made to feed it.
In the meantime, actually within twenty-four hours of desertion,
the pair were prospecting an open-fronted box, 9 inches wide, 8 inches
deep, and 8 inches high, hanging in the open flight. A rough nest
was made and eggs were laid on 5th and 6th July : these hatched
on the 20th and 21st, giving an incubation period of about fifteen
days. There was a violent thunderstorm the night before the hatching
of the first egg, but fortunately it had no adverse effect. The weather
was cold and very wet, but both parents were assiduous and the two
squabs throve amazingly. One young one left the nest, perhaps some-
what prematurely, but in any event several days before we expected,
on 1 st August. No heap of straw had been placed in readiness, but
nevertheless it was not injured by the fall. The parents were very
attentive, and lest their loyalties should be divided between one young
one on the ground and one still in the nest, the latter was removed the
following day and placed on a bed of straw on the ground. The weather
continued to be cold and miserable, but the two young ones withstood
it and were successfully reared to independence. The female again laid
in the wire basket on 5th and 6th August.
The young bird has no white on the face, there is no metallic
sheen, and the general colour above and below is brown, with narrow,
rufous bars and tips to most of the feathers. In general it has a speckly
appearance which the Marquess of Tavistock has described as " rather
grouse-like ".
The Lemon Dove, in common with many other ground-feeding
doves, is partly insectivorous. As staple food we give a mixture of wheat,
kibbled maize, hemp, canary, white millet, and pannicum ; a good
British finch mixture is also provided. A proprietary brand of soft-
bill food and Fruit Pigeon fruit mixture are always available, but they
are only very occasionally pecked over. Gentles and mealworms
are given twice daily and are quickly eaten, with preference for the
former.

By Dr. H. D. Groen (Haren, Groningen, Holland)
With the prohibition of the importation into Holland of parrot-like
birds from Australia, probably the last channel through which broad-
tails came to Europe has been closed. Some species of the broadtail
family have been bred so freely that their survival is ensured for
years, but there are others which were only imported on a small
scale and bred on rare occasions. The Barraband's Parrakeet (Polytelis
swainsonii) certainly belongs to the last group and its survival will be
very difficult without the badly needed importation of fresh stock.
My birds did their bit towards this during the past season and they
would certainly have not been to blame if things had gone wrong,
as the following notes will show. The birds were imported from
Australia in almost adult plumage early in 1955. For nearly three
years they were in the possession of a friend of mine and were housed
in an aviary measuring 12 feet in length, but as nothing happened it
was thought that the aviary was too small. I therefore obtained the
birds and placed them in a large aviary measuring 20 feet by 40 feet
and 6 feet high in order to provide plenty of opportunity for flying
exercise. They shared this aviary with other psittacine birds, mainly
species of young Rosellas of the year, with which they lived in peace.
In February, 1958, the pair was placed in a separate aviary (5 feet
by 33 feet) on the far end of which there was a roof of plastic trans-
parent canvas. A natural hollow tree trunk 6 feet long was placed
slantwise at an angle of 60 degrees in this shelter ; no special entrance
hole was made but the birds could go in at the top where the trunk
was cut. The female went in almost immediately and after a few days
the first egg was laid. Control was possible through an inspection
door near the bottom of the tree. Incubation was started at once and
the bird sat so tightly that she did not move when I opened the
inspection door. No mating, not even feeding, was ever seen, so
I was not very hopeful, but in view of the fact that these birds are
single-brooded and that there would not be a second chance if the
first brood was unsuccessful I left her in peace. On looking through
the inspection door three weeks later I found only one (infertile) egg,
which I removed. The hen, however, appeared to be so broody that
she continued brooding on an empty nest. After closing the entrance
to the trunk with a board I found the hen sitting again the next day,
after having opened the entrance herself. The log was then firmly
closed by nailing the board over the entrance, and this obviously
worried the hen very much.
In the meantime misfortune had occurred in the other aviaries.

H. D. GROEN BREEDING BARRABAND's PARRAKEETS IN HOLLAND 13 I
Many Rosellas did not start brooding after laying their clutch of eggs.
I estimated that my Barraband's hen, being a larger bird, might take
care of at least ten Rosella eggs, and I wished I had let her continue
to sit on her infertile egg. The board was removed and she went
straight in. She stayed in the trunk for days, but unfortunately did
not accept the eggs provided which were buried or broken. Realizing
it was useless, the eggs were taken out and the log shut once more.
A week later a broken Barraband's egg was found on the ground,
obviously laid from the perch. The board was removed again at
once and the next egg was laid where it should be, in the log.
Incubation was started the same day and, expecting the same per-
formance all over again as no matings were observed, I entrusted her
with five Pennant's eggs. The next day four Golden-mantled Rosella
eggs were added, making a total of ten eggs. On making a control
observation a week later I found thirteen eggs and to my surprise
I could see that the first Barraband's egg, which was marked, was
fertile, so I thought it best to remove all the Rosella eggs again.
Those that were fertile were divided between two pairs of Pale-headed
Rosellas which had started breeding in the meantime. My Barraband's
hen did not seem to be upset by all this disturbance and continued
brooding, even laying a fifth egg. All five eggs proved fertile and
the youngsters hatched after an incubation period of exactly twenty
days. A month later the first young emerged from the nest, followed
by the others within a week, and all five birds were very steady flyers
from the moment they left the nest. Both male and female carried
on feeding their offspring for quite a while. A somewhat peculiar
habit, which has not been observed before, was that for at least a
fortnight the young returned to roost in the tree trunk every evening.
It is difficult to sex juvenile Barraband's ; young males may have
a yellowish wash on the cheeks or forehead, but in none of my birds
was this visible. They all have red feathers on the legs, however, as
in the old female, though I suppose in the males these will disappear
later, as I can hardly believe that all my five young birds are
females.
I think it is amazing that everything came out all right and that
this happy ending was brought about in spite of all the interference
and all the things I should not have done. It is gratifying to know
that, in addition to my own breeding pair, there are at least three
other breeders in Holland who possess healthy birds which every year
rear their young. Likewise there are some odd birds here and there,
and therefore with discretion and co-operation it might be possible to
secure a good stock of unrelated birds for future breeding and really
establish this very attractive species in our country.

The report in the East African Standard on 19th June, 1958, con-
cerning the condition of a consignment of about 700 birds held up
at Nairobi airport aroused a storm of indignation not only from all
over the Colony but also from South Africa, Great Britain, Sweden,
Denmark, and other countries of Europe. The birds were examined
by Mr. John G. Williams, ornithologist of the Goryndon Museum ;
he found many were already dead and estimated 50 per cent would
be dead before they reached their destination. The birds were packed
in tiered cages, each tier little more than 6 inches deep. Exact
information regarding the species concerned is not available but it is
known that there were weavers and waxbills and also a number of
lovebirds including Fischer's and Masked (Agapornis fischeri and A. per-
sonata ). Mr. Williams stated that the lovebirds removed from the
cages had died of starvation and that they were also in immediate
post-breeding condition and would have been feeding young at the
time they were captured. The birds originated from Tanganyika and
Northern Rhodesia and, it is stated, were destined for Birmingham,
Amsterdam, and Lisbon. Information has been requested as to whom
they were consigned but this has not yet come to hand. In view of
the fact that the import of psittacine birds is prohibited both in the
United Kingdom and Holland, it is presumed the lovebirds were
consigned to Lisbon.
Immediate steps have been taken in Kenya aimed at stopping the
mass exportation of indigenous birds and from the correspondence in
the local press it would appear that there is widespread support for
such measures.
The transport of birds under bad conditions cannot be too strongly
deplored and all aviculturists will be as one in condemning such
practices. Twenty years ago the International Committee for Bird
Preservation took up the question of the condition of transport of

Ducks must have no water inside their boxes. The water must be
placed outside the box in such a way as to allow the birds easily to
get their heads through the bars to drink.
Cranes and other Large Waders , and also Ostrich-like Birds must be
packed singly in cases made of full wood panels, except in front,
high enough for the birds to stand comfortably. They must have a
considerable amount of straw to stand on and this must always be

When transport by air became more common a further approach
was made to Lloyds with regard to the conditions under which birds
should be transported by air. These conditions were drawn up by
the same sub-committee and are as follows :--
Conditions Required for Live Birds Transported by Air
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.97790564" page_id="56311206"  page_num="134" year="" vol="">
(1) A veterinary certificate stating that the birds are healthy and
not suffering from disease before shipment and, if possible, that they
are feeding well.
(2) Live birds must not be left at airfields exposed to weather, or
in darkness. Pending travel by air they must be kept under cover,
but in the light. In case of delay of arrival, they must be fed and
watered properly.
(3) Assurance must be given that there is suitable accommodation
available on board the aircraft concerned. Birds, like all other live
animals, must be kept in an even temperature and have sufficient
light to feed. The cages must be tied securely to prevent sudden
movement and food and water vessels must be so fixed in the cages
as to prevent them falling out. If there is no pressure conditioning
flying at high altitudes must be avoided.
(4) All live birds transported must be suitably caged in box cages
made of light wood or cardboard. For pheasants, partridges, quails,
tinamous, and pigeons the roof of the cage must be carefully padded
inside.
(5) Perches must be sufficient in numbers to allow of each bird
having adequate space to perch comfortably. For smaller birds (such
as finches and waxbills) a space of 2 inches each must be allowed and
more for larger kinds according to size. Perches must never be placed
above one another.
(6) Curtains of canvas or other material must be provided to hang
when necessary over the wired opening of the cage, if any.

The Secretary of Lloyds Underwriters' Association expressed every
sympathy with the object but did not feel the insurance policies were
the best means of dealing with this matter and suggested that the
Ministry of Civil Aviation should be approached. The recommenda-
tions were therefore sent to the International Air Transport Association
and they brought them to the attention of their member airlines.
There is no doubt that for many years birds transported by air
were sent under good conditions and with proper care, and mortality
was low. But the case reported from Nairobi is evidence that there
has been great deterioration, and this brings up again not only the
question of the conditions of the transport of birds, but the whole
question of the trade.
The export of birds from tropical countries has grown to such
enormous proportions that most severe regulations have been intro-

duced, which have inevitably adversely affected the genuine, serious
aviculturist. Australia was the first country to introduce such legisla-
tion, principally in order to safeguard her parrots, and more recently
South Africa has brought in new regulations. In a paper on the
conservation of birds in the Province of the Cape of Good Hope,
read at the Pan-African Ornithological Congress in Livingstone, in
July, 1957, Dr. D. Hey, Director of Nature Conservation, stated :
" I consider the biggest single evil to be the under-cover trade in
wild birds which is far more extensive than is realized. A perusal of
the European avicultural magazines will give some indication of the
numbers of our birds which are sent to Europe each year. As long
as dealers in these countries pay high prices for our birds, so long will
the trade continue. The Cape, Transvaal, and Natal have banned
the importation of wild birds and if the same steps could be taken in
other countries it would strengthen our hand. One cannot overstress
the importance of this malpractice. For every bird which lands in
the cages of the aviculturist, twenty are killed, both directly and
indirectly as a result of trapping and transport operations."
The new law prohibits the keeping of birds in captivity except
under permit and regulates the conditions under which such birds
can be kept. It also prohibits the import and export of any wild
bird.
There are many people who strongly oppose the keeping of any
wild animal in captivity--mammal, bird, or reptile--but this is a
matter of opinion which I will not go into here. However, the fears
expressed that mass exportation of birds from the continent of Africa
will result in the loss of certain species cannot be gainsaid, and the
wastage of birdlife involved cannot be too strongly deprecated. On
the other hand, aviculture in the true sense is of aesthetic, scientific,
and educational value and brings pleasure to thousands of people.
It is true that one law for the rich and another for the poor is
manifestly unfair, but with regard to keeping birds in captivity the
reverse is the case and there should be one law for the rich (in
knowledge and the possibility of providing ideal conditions for their
birds) and another for the poor (in knowledge of keeping birds, a
proper attitude towards captive birds, and a lack of the sense of high
responsibility they owe towards them). Moreover, aviculture has a
valuable part to play in the conservation of vanishing species of birds
in the world to-day. That great aviculturist, the late Dr. J. M.
Derscheid, writing in 1939 of the numerous adverse factors endangering
the existence of many species, in an article entitled " The Preservation
of Waterfowl and Aviculture " (d.M., Vol. IV, Nos. 3 and 9), stated :
"It is a matter of stupefaction to me that in the face of these
unsolvable problems, so few interested people think of turning their
minds towards another way of preserving the various species of birds

threatened with extermination, viz. maintaining them and increasing their
numbers by methodical breeding in captivity ." He also expressed the hope
that adequate measures would be taken to ensure by artificial
propagation the future of the Hawaiian Goose. Dr. Derscheid's hope
was fulfilled by Peter Scott, who has demonstrated in a striking way
the value of aviculture in preserving a disappearing species from
complete destruction. Through Mr. Scott's efforts the world popula-
tion of the Nene, or Hawaiian Goose, has been increased by sixty-eight
birds bred in captivity, with the view of, in due course, reintroducing
them to their wild native habitat in Hawaii, and the future of this
species, which was on the verge of extinction, is now far more
hopeful.
No aviculturist wishes to see birds exploited for the benefit of
dealers, who only care for what financial gain they can get out of the
transaction, and unless steps are taken to stop this aviculture as a
whole will be seriously affected. The fact must be faced that control
of collection, export, transport, and import of birds is urgently
necessary. Those well-known collectors F. W. Shaw Mayer, C. S.
Webb, the late Tom Goodwin, and the late Walter Goodfellow
brought back their birds in perfect condition and the birds were
acquired by those who could give them the best conditions possible.
The day of the professional collector who could bring back his birds
personally has gone, but with good conditions of air travel there is
no reason why birds should not arrive as well as they did before.
One well-known collector told me that he makes a strict rule never
to dispatch a bird till it has settled down and learnt to feed properly,
and if it does not take to captivity it is released. The same collector
is a member of the Avicultural Society ; he sends his birds by an
airline, the Transport Manager of which is also a member of the
Society, to a dealer who is another member--the mortality is
practically nil. But for this the price of the birds is inevitably high.
I disagree with Dr. Hey when he deprecates the high prices paid by
dealers for South African birds--the prices are not nearly high
enough ; it is the quick turnover, with high mortality, of " cheap "
birds which is the great danger.

(Carpodacus purpureus purpureus )
By G. C. Lynch (Hounslow, Middlesex, England)
The following is a description of what I believe to be the first
breeding of the North American Purple Finch. The parent birds came
over about four years ago in a consignment which also included
various thrushes, Juncos, House Finches, Fox Sparrows, Evening
Grosbeaks, which I was lucky to obtain. As a matter of interest
it was one of the hen Evening Grosbeaks that reared a youngster
last year for which Mr. Claude Payne was awarded the Society's
Medal. The House Finches also bred last year.
Towards the end of April I noticed the hen Purple Finch taking
an interest in an open wooden box about 6 inches long and about
4 inches wide, hanging in the shelter of one of my outdoor aviaries.
This aviary is io feet long by 6 feet wide and 8 ft. 6 in. high, with a
shelter 3 feet from the ground that goes right across one end and
has a permanent opening about 3 feet square in the centre. A number
of privet bushes are squeezed in each side, making dense shelter and
nesting sites for the birds, but with the disadvantage that it is nearly
impossible to examine the nests without thoroughly disturbing the
birds. In this aviary there are about eight or nine pairs of birds,
including Juncos, House Finches, some British birds and a pair of
Norwich canaries, the last named have some importance as will be
seen later.
The box is situated at the back of the open part of the shelter, about
6 inches from the roof. The hen started gathering dried grasses, bents,
and also some tow that I had thrown into the aviaries, and constructed
a very cosy nest just over 3 inches in diameter right in the
centre of the box. It was surrounded by small pieces of thin privet
wood, but whether or not these were brought by the hen or were
brought by other birds before she started to nest I am not certain, as
I could not see into the box because of its position. The nest was very
similar to that of a Greenfinch and had a number of feathers in its
make-up but was not lined with them, and the hen finished it off with
very soft grasses. I did not observe the cock assisting the hen in making
the nest, but as I am away all day it is possible that he did help when
I was not there.
The hen started to sit and about a fortnight after completing the
nest she went off, so I quickly felt in it with my fingers and counted
five eggs. I hurriedly withdrew and after I left the aviary the hen
flew straight back. Twelve days later I saw the hen apparently feeding
the young, but directly she saw me she sat tight. I estimate that
hatching takes between twelve and fourteen days, but, of course, I might

still be a day out. The eggs were a greenish colour with coloured
specks. I only had a glance of one.
I then supplied soaked mixed seed, egg food consisting of butchers'
rusks, hard boiled egg and glucose D, and large quantities of chick-
weed, all of which I noticed the hen consuming. The cock did not
eat the soft food but fed the hen on chickweed when she was away from
the nest. I did not see him feed the young or the hen when on the nest.
Things appeared to be going quite well for over a week. Then we
experienced what I can only describe as torrential rain--this continued
for over forty-eight hours, and on the third morning when the rain had
stopped, I noticed a dead bird near the bird-bath, which is about 7
or 8 feet from the nest. Upon further investigation I found three
more birds around this bath. I then examined the nest and found
it quite empty. I do not know what happened to the fifth egg as there
was no trace of it or of another chick. How they came to be
7 feet from the nest I shall never know. The young birds were nine
or ten days old, and I should not have thought they could have made
their way all this distance on their own, especially in those weather
conditions. This, as can well be imagined, left me very despondent.
I left the nest alone hoping that perhaps the pair would have another
try. In the meantime two of the British hens went to nest and so did
the hen canary.
On 20th June I went to Switzerland for a holiday. The hen canary,
which had nested in a basket in the open part of the flight, had just
hatched some young, so I made arrangements for the rearing food
already described to be continued for their benefit.
On the first day back from my holiday I saw a fully fledged bird--
my attention was first drawn to it because of the two extremely large
tufts of white, hair-like feathers jutting out on each side of the head.
Whilst I was watching this in amazement the hen and cock Purple
Finch fed it. It appeared to be quite strong on the wing and flew to
different perches without hesitation. I entered the aviary and then
discovered--what I should have found about five weeks earlier--an
entirely new nest built in a very thick part of the privet only a few
inches from the top of the shelter. The main structure was built
woven round the twigs and the lining was similar to the nest in the box.
It was cleverly concealed, but had I not been watching the box nest
I think I should have seen it. My own hands were too large to force
in the nest from above so my wife did so. She informed me that the
nest was completely empty ; so how many eggs were laid and what
happened to them I cannot say.
The young bird is one of the most vigorous and confident young
birds I have ever bred and has been no trouble. When it first came
from the nest its back plumage and wings and tail were similar to those
of a Linnet, but the whole of the breast and under parts were like that

of a hen Siskin--very light in colour and studded with dark flecks. At
the time of writing the bird is about eight weeks old, is entirely indepen-
dent, and very vigorous. The pencilling on the back is of a rich, dark
hue, the under parts remind me very much of a hen Amethyst Starling
and the wing butts have a suggestion of a reddish colour on them. The
young bird is nearly the size of its parents and I believe it to be a cock.
At this stage it is, in my opinion, prettier than either of the parents.
The cock, by the way, seems to be less colourful every moult.
I have described the failure fully because I cannot give much detail
of the success.
There is little doubt that but for the fact that the rearing food was
placed in the aviary each day for the canary, the Purple Finch would
not have been reared by its parents.
As described above, G. C. Lynch has bred the Purple Finch
(Carpodacus purpurens purpureus). It is believed that this may be a first
success. Any member or reader knowing of a previous breeding of
this species in Great Britain or Northern Ireland is requested to
communicate at once with the Hon. Secretary.

(Concluded from p. 21)
With few exceptions, Mr. Rudkin and his son had examples of most
of the Australian cockatoos and parrakeets. At the Ranch were
seven pairs of Mealy Rosellas, and very fine birds they were, too.
This was a favourite species with Mr. Rudkin, Senr., and he had kept
them for many years in England before coming to the U.S.A. There
was a Mealy X Rosella hybrid, a most beautiful bird, mated to a
normal, the young differed very little from the pure bred Mealy.
Mr. Rudkin had a good stock of my favourite Australian parrakeet,
the Elegant, of which there were many breeding pairs. These cannot be
bred on the colony system ; if tried the result is that a good proportion
of the young are degenerate specimens. The Elegants at the Ranch
were a very good strain and prolific breeders ; one pair producing
nine young ones in the season. Nearly all the birds had either eggs or
young ones in the nest whilst I was there.
Another Neophema parakeet was the Turquoisine. I noticed a male
bird which had the whole of the breast a shade of deep, rich orange ;
I was told that this was a very old one. Besides this, were two fine
pairs which Mr. Rudkin had bred from birds originally sent out by
the late Duke of Bedford, then the Marquess of Tavistock, many

years before the Second World War when the species was threatened
by extinction and there seemed a chance to save it by breeding it
in a more favourable climate than that of these Islands.
During the first eight years many young ones were reared, but
unfortunately one of the fumigations of the surrounding orange
orchards killed eight or ten of the breeding birds, only one pair being
left. Since then the stock had never been made up again. The one
pair that were left reared young every other year.
Mr. Rudkin found that Turquoisine X Elegant hybrids were sterile ;
this is surprising considering how closely related the two species are.
Another Neophema I noticed was the Scarlet-chested, two young birds
which had been bred by Mr. Harold Rudkin. Of Bourkes, there were
several finely coloured pairs, but though they bred they could not be
classed as prolific.
One wonders why the exquisite little Neophema or Grass Parrakeets,
the most charming of the whole parrot family, should, like the equally
delightful Cyanorhamphus parrakeets from New Zealand, nearly always
give, when first acquired, the appearance of being very fecund,
only through the succeeding years gradually to die out. This is so even
in California, with one or two rare exceptions, which has ideal condi-
tions and climate for parrakeet breeding. Having kept five different
species myself, I have come to the conclusion that it requires something
more than good bird keeping to keep the birds going for a long period.
Maybe they are birds which outside Australia have some kind of
allergy to districts and soil. It is strange, considering they are so
closely related to the most prolific of all parrot-like birds, the ubiquitous
Budgerigar !
Another lovely Australian parrakeet possessed by Mr. Rudkin
was the Pileated or Red-capped, a gorgeous bird with strange and
lovely colouring, which has always fascinated me, but which I have
never been able to obtain. I am sure it would be worth a special trip
to Australia to get it ! Though, strange to say, I never saw one in
Australia when I went there, this, however, was made up for by seeing
quite a number in California. A good few aviculturists had them,
but the birds did not seem very prolific. Mr. Rudkin was a great
admirer of this species and was most successful in rearing them.
At one time he had no less than seven breeding pairs, but at the time
I was there he had only one pair and an odd hen ; the pair, however,
had a nest of young ones. The cock was a beauty and spoke quite a
few words of English, a rare accomplishment for this species.
If aviculturists were successful with parrot-like birds in California,
that was as nothing compared to their success with pheasants. So
prolific were pheasants in that favoured climate that the chief difficulty
of the pheasant breeders was to dispose of their surplus stock. Quite
a few owners of pheasant farms, lured to come out to the Golden West

and invest their capital in a breeding stock of these birds, had been
sadly disillusioned, and so saturated did the market become that
many breeders had literally to live off their products. I went to one
place where it seemed a matter of course to serve up roast Firebacks
for the mid-day meal !
The only pheasants which did not seem to flourish were Tragopans,
White Crossoptilons, and Argus.
Needless to say, pheasants thrived exceedingly on the Ranch and
one saw many old favourites there, including Swinhoe's, Germain's
Peacock, Elliott's, Reeves's, Impeyans, etc., but none seemed so
prolific as the white and melanistic Ringnecks. Whether the clearer
air and the more brilliant sunshine of California showed the plumage
of the latter up to better advantage or whether the birds were a very
fine strain, I do not know, but they struck me as being far finer than
any I had seen in Europe. They were truly beautiful and their body
feathers would have done credit to one of the more brilliant Glossy
Starlings. As easy to rear as domestic poultry, I was told that there
was little or no demand for the birds as ornamental inhabitants of
aviaries, so they were sold more or less as table birds. By what I
remember the hens were exceptionally light in colour.
The white strain of the Common Pheasant looked exceptionally
immaculate, again due to the dirt free air of that glamorous land.
These too, were hard to dispose of and suffered a similar fate to the
melanistic.

By J. Delacour (Los Angeles, California, U.S.A.)
Tanagers and Sugar Birds, those gorgeously coloured, fruit-eating
finches from the Western Hemisphere, have long been favourites
with aviculturists. A long established custom to consider them as
belonging to two separate families because Sugar Birds have a longer,
slenderer, more curved bill, has recently been proved wrong by
anatomical studies as well as by observation of their life habits. The
closely similar colour pattern of several species in both groups also
indicates their close relationship. I, personally consider the majority
of Sugar Birds are true Tanagers. A few are akin to the American
Warblers ( Parulidae ), which are themselves linked to the Tanagers
by a number of intermediates, so that the affinity of all these birds is
great indeed.
These beautiful birds are not difficult to care for if one remembers
that they are messy, like all fruit-eaters, and must be accommodated
accordingly. Also, bananas are poison to all the smaller and more
delicate species unless it is crushed and mixed with pound cake, which
then constitutes an excellent food. This applies equally to Manakins
and Flower-peckers. They do well in cages as long as they are kept
very clean, and it is a good precaution to have a grating at the bottom
of the cage, one or two inches above the tray, so that the birds cannot
pick up stale food or droppings, which some are prone to do. Most
Tanagers are not hardy in cold countries and must have heat during
the winter. In southern California, however, all species can stay out-
doors the year round and they stand perfectly well a few white frosts
which occasionally occur during the colder winters.
Many beautiful species which had never or seldom reached European
or American aviaries before have now come to us from Costa Rica and
Colombia. Air transportation enables them to arrive within a day.
They suffer little from the trip and losses are very slight. I keep these
birds in large, planted aviaries, with proper shelter from wind and rain.
I feed them as follows : crushed banana and pound cake ; crushed
pound cake and hard-boiled egg, including the shell ; a mixture of
soaked dry biscuit and shredded raw meat, which they little touch, and
various sweet fruit : pear, apple, grapes, soaked rasins, orange, and
papaya. A number of them relish lettuce, and to my surprise, many
eat a good deal of the millet and canary seed provided for finches
which share their aviaries. They live perfectly well on such a diet, as
also do some Manakins. Some would nest if they were not so over-
crowded, but so far, Yellow-winged Sugar Birds only have managed
to rear young.

Tanagers and Sugar Birds remain fairly well at peace with one
another, even while they are in breeding condition when, however,
some pairs are inclined to bully others. The larger Tanagers are more
inclined to fight, and it is sometimes difficult to keep together several
pairs of the same or of closely allied species. They never bother other
birds such as Waxbills, Finches, Buntings, Manakins, Fruit-Suckers,
Shamas, Loo-Choo and Japanese Robins, Pittas, Quails, and Doves
which share their flights. But care must be taken when new specimens
are introduced, and I have had to remove some saucy old birds to
avoid persecution of new inmates. All goes well, as a rule, after a few
days of seclusion of the bullies.
Up to the last war mostly east Brazilian Tanagers were readily
available, such as Superb, Festive, Tricoloured, and Scarlet. Others
came only exceptionally. Eastern South American species are among
the most beautiful, but Central America and the Pacific countries,
particularly the Andes in Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru, have
especially gorgeous and even more numerous species, which only
recently have been sent out.
The following species are now represented in my Los Angeles
collection :
Golden-browed Chlorophonia ( Chlorophonia callophrys )--A large,
short-tailed Tanager from the mountain forests of Costa Rica and
Panama. The adult male has golden yellow eyebrows and forehead,
metallic lilac-blue crown, nape and ring round the hind neck, a
blackish brown necklace on the upper breast, yellow breast and
abdomen ; the rest of the plumage is a rich green ; females, and young
males until two years old, lack most of the yellow. This bird is twice
as large as its better known South American relatives. It is extremely
beautiful and lives well if properly fed. Quite active, it utters almost
incessantly a soft trumpet-like note.
Scrub Euphonia ( Tanagra affinis) --Very small, with a yellow patch
on the forehead ; upper parts, neck and throat purplish black ; some
white in the tail ; underparts golden yellow ; female greenish olive.
Found from Mexico to Costa Rica.
Bonaparte's Euphonia ( Tanagra lauta) --Larger, the male with the
throat yellow as the rest of the underparts. Southern Mexico to
Panama.
The lovely Callistes are highly diversified :
Speckled Tanager ( Tangara chrysophrys) --A pretty species yellowish
green above and on the flanks, pale grey on the throat and breast,
spotted all over with black, the markings larger below than above ;
short yellow lines above and below the eyes ; lores black. Graceful in
shape and sexes alike as all Callistes. The Central American race is

the prettiest ; the species extends to Venezuela, Trinidad, Colombia,
and Ecuador.
Spangle-cheeked Tanager ( Tangara dowi) --A peculiar, dark species
proper to the high mountains of Costa Rica and western Panama.
Rather large. Head and throat black ; cheeks and neck black
spangled with light green ; mantle black ; rump silvery green ; a
small reddish spot on the middle of the crown ; wings and tail black,
the feathers bordered with rich dark blue ; breast mottled black and
pale green, rest of underparts tawny brown.
Black-eared Tanager ( Tangara pardusakii) --A large Calliste
from Colombia, extending to Peru ( lunigera ). Forehead and cheeks
orange red ; crown and nape golden yellow ; throat, chin, lores, a
ring round the eyes and large ear spots black, like the upper back,
mantle, wings, and tail ; lower back, rump and underparts pale
silvery green with lilac reflections, tinged with buff on the breast and
fawn on the belly and vent. A wonderful bird, which needs special care
when it first arrives, but does well later on.
Silver-throated Tanager ( Tangara icterocephala )--Crown and
cheeks yellow, the lores, chin, a line below the eye and a patch on the
ears black ; throat light grey ; mantle yellow with elongated black
spots ; back and underparts yellow ; wings and tail feathers black
with green margins. A beautiful bird from Costa Rica, Panama, and
north-western Colombia, closely allied to the following :
Golden Tanager ( Tangara arthus aurulenta) --Much like the Silver-
throated, but a much deeper, more golden yellow all over including the
throat ; wings and tail feathers margined with yellow. A subspecies of
T. arthus from Venezuela, which differs in its rich brown underparts.
It lives well in captivity and it has bred repeatedly in Mr. A. H,
Isenberg's greenhouse the last two years.
Yellow-crowned Tanager ( Tangara xanthocephala venusta) --A
rather small, very beautiful species found from Colombia to Bolivia.
Crown and cheeks golden yellow ; forehead, lores, a ring round the
eyes, chin, throat, and nuchal collar black ; mantle, wings, and tail
black, the feathers broadly bordered with bluish green ; back, rump,
breast, and sides silky bluish green ; belly and vent fawn.
Blue-necked Tanager ( Tangara cyanicollis coeruleucephala) --Another
small species. Head and neck brilliant blue, the lores and chin black ;
mantle and underparts black ; lower back, rump, and shoulders
light silvery green ; tail and wing feathers black bordered with light
green. A very pretty bird, which has bred successfully in Mrs. M.
Erlanger's aviaries in New Jersey.
Mrs. Wilson's Tanager ( Tangara nigro-cincta fanny) --The species
extends from Guatemala to Bolivia. Forehead, chin, and lores black,
face and forecrown violet blue passing to light blue ; rest of head and

neck metallic greenish buff, coppery on the throat ; breast and mantle
black ; shoulders shiny violet and sky blue ; lower back and rump
sky blue, sides indigo blue ; flanks sky blue ; belly white ; tail and
wing feathers black bordered with light green. A magnificent Calliste,
strong and easy to keep.
Black and Green Tanager ( Tangara nigroviridis) --A small, rather
weak, but pretty species. Velvety black, spotted and speckled all over
with shiny greenish blue, the forehead, chin, and face black ; wing and
tail feathers black bordered with blue ; the head and rump almost
solid blue.
Occurs from Colombia and Venezuela to Bolivia.
Bay-headed Tanager ( Tangara gyrola) --This species extends from
Costa Rica to the Amazon and Bolivia and is very variable. The
Costa Rican form ( bangsi ) is the prettiest. Contrary to the preceding
species, its plumage is neither shiny nor silky, but the colours are very
bright. Head rich chestnut ; a narrow yellow nuchal collar ; mantle,
wings, and tail bright green ; lower back and underparts peacock blue,
the vent green ; thighs light brown. It lives at low elevation.
Rufous-crowned Tanager ( Tangara cayana )--A rather dull-
plumaged, common Tanager, widespread from Colombia to Brazil
and Bolivia. Crown rufous ; face black ; mantle, back, and under-
parts greyish green, passing to buffy brown on the vent ; wing and
tail feathers broadly bordered with silvery green. A strong, hardy
species.
Of the larger species of Tanagers I have the Scarlet, the Crimson-
backed [R. dimidiatus), the Yellow-backed (R. icteronatus) and Red-
backed (R. passer ini) ; males will fight and are better kept separate ;
Blue Tanagers ( Thraupis verescens cana) which breed easily, and three
specimens of the far prettier form from the Western Amazon Valley
(T. v. coelestis ), which had not previously come ; it has the head, neck,
breast, and wings light, but bright mauvish blue and several large,
white bars on the wings ; also, the beautiful Blue-winged Mountain
Tanager ( Compsocoma flavinucha cyanoptera ) with golden yellow nape,
hind neck and lower parts, velvety black head and upper parts, the
shoulders and the borders of the tail and wing feathers silky, deep blue.
It is fairly insectivorous species, which also consumes a lot of lettuce
and some seeds as well as fruit.
Besides the well-known Yellow-winged, Purple, Blue, and Black-
headed Sugar Birds, I have two Scarlet-thighed Sugar Birds ( Dacnis
venusta). This fine species is found from Costa Rica to Ecuador. It
resembles the well-known Blue ( Dacnis cayana) in size and shape, but
the male is velvety black and blue, the latter colour, bright and silky,
extending to the crown, the ear-coverts, the back and sides of the neck,
the shoulders, the back and the rump ; the thighs are vermillion red ;

the female is dull green with a blue rump, a grey throat and an ochra-

plumage in the second year. My presumed female is now moulting
into a beautiful male dress !
All these Tanagers and Sugar Birds moving swiftly among the
tropical foliage, which I can watch from my sitting-room, are a
constant source of interest.

By J. J. Yealland
A collection of Humming Birds, presented by H.E. the Brazilian
Ambassador, was brought to London early in July by Dr. Augusto
Ruschi. The birds came from Dr. Ruschi's collection--some possibly
from his garden, for, as we saw in a film that he showed us, and as
Jean Delacour has already explained in the Magazine, very many
of these birds are about there, coming to feed from the hanging bottles
of sugar or honey and water that are placed around the veranda.
David Attenborough and Charles Lagus, now on their " Zoo Quest "
to Paraguay, hope to call at Santa Teresa in order to film this remark-
able sight.
Three of the species are new to the Collection ; they are the
Brazilian Ruby (Clytolaema rubricauda ), the Amethyst (Calliphlox
amethystinus) and the Brazilian Wood Nymph (Thalurania glaucopis ).
Pied Jacobin, Sombre, Short-billed Emerald, Frilled Coquette,
Swallow-tailed and White-throated were also among this fine collection.
A White-capped Redstart and a pair of Diamond Sparrows have been
presented by Mr. G. H. Newmark, and a lesser Short-toed Lark by
Mrs. C. M. Everitt.
A Greater Sulphur-crested Cockatoo has been hatched and there are
various young Gulls, including the Australian Silver Gull. Common
Peafowl, various pheasants, Peach-faced, and Masked Lovebirds,
Quaker Parrakeets, Crested Pigeons, and another Superb Glossy
Starling have also been bred.
Three eggs laid by the King Penguins were all infertile and so were
two laid by Sarus Cranes. A Red-breasted gosling did not survive
and the Snowy Owls produced nothing from their two clutches.

Guests of the Club : Dr. and Mrs. W. E. Hurlburt.
Members of the Club, 33 ; guests, 14 ; total, 47.
K. A. Norris showed a selection of his hand-coloured slides to
illustrate " British Birds at Home and Abroad A wide variety of
subjects was dealt with : an exceptionally tame pair of Robins in
Norris's own garden ; Bee-eaters which nested in Sussex last year ;
Avocets which have established a breeding colony after an absence of a
hundred years ; the use of light and shade in plumage to aid aggressive
and defensive action illustrated by a series of slides of the Short-eared
Owl ; the special adornment developed by males of polygamous
species, by photographs of Ruffs ona" display-ground " in Holland ;
use of special warning cry developed by Avocet on approach of
Black-headed Gulls ; temperature control during incubation by
Purple Heron ; and the modification in the structure of the primary
feathers of owls to ensure silent flight, this illustrated by a " self-
portrait " of a Barn Owl : altogether over thirty species were shown.
The slides were of the very high standard associated with Kenneth
Norris and members obviously appreciated the skill and patience
required to obtain these very exceptional results. The photographs
had been taken during the past twenty-five years, both in this country
and throughout Europe.
Further meetings and dinners during the 1958-59 session have been
arranged for the following dates :

in indoor aviaries, otherwise the weather would have prevented many
of the breeding attempts being brought to a successful conclusion in

Dr. K. G. Rothwell's results to date : five Stanleys, unfortunately
two died before it was discovered that they were not being fed by the
hen--double brooded this year ; four Elegants ; five Bourkes ;
four Turquoisines, from a pair imported into this country as recently
as May this year ; one Golden-mantled Rosella. A hen Pennant mated
to a cock Adelaide laid about twenty eggs. Two were placed under a
hen Golden-mantled and one young hybrid was hatched, but the
hen failed to feed it and it died. A cock Pennant X Golden-mantled
hybrid mated with a hen Golden-mantled produced one young one
exactly like a Golden-mantled. Dr. Rothwell says " the important
feature being that it retained the blue cheek patchings Mendelian
dormant of its father ". Kings very late to nest but sitting steadily.

I put her in the box two days later, same reason, again she laid,

Fearing the demands of the millinery trade would cause the total
extermination of the Greater Bird of Paradise, Sir William Ingram,
Bart., purchased the island of Little Tobago, in the British West
Indies, and commissioned the late W. J. C. Frost to collect live birds
in the Aru Islands, New Guinea. Forty-eight were set free on the
island at the end of September, 1909.
Now, some fifty years later, Dr. E. Thomas Gilliard, Associate
Curator of Birds, American Museum of Natural History, and Leader,

the first camera record of the courtship display of this bird. Dr. Gilliard

the maximum number the mile-long island can support. Readers

Lloyd B. Thompson, Vancouver, reports : " My birds have not
done too well this year, although the weather for the past twelve
months has been ideal. The winter was so mild we had no snow and
very little frost. The birds went to nest early, but there were a lot of
clear eggs, and with species that nest only once that means a zero for the
year. Plum-heads were one of the disappointments, laying clear eggs,
as did the lutino Ring-necked hen and her two-year-old daughter.
Pennants and Stanleys did not go to nest.
The Turquoisines had troubles, but raised five good young ones.
The Bourkes reared one and have two in the nest. The Lovebirds did
well and Masked, normal and blue, Peach-faced, Fischer's, Nyasa,

were reared. Zebra Finches in most of the rarer varieties were reared,
as well as Gouldians, Cut-throats, and Golden-breasted Waxbills,

There is a certain amount of prejudice against hybrids by some
individuals, as being against nature, and to those who believe in the
fixity of species it is disturbing to find the ease with which many birds
mate with a different species and even produce fertile offspring.
It has even become necessary to revise the common definition of a
species in view of the results of hybridization in such groups as ducks
and geese, pheasants and the finches. This annotated compilation is
primarily a work of reference and attempts to be a reliable guide to
the many bird hybrids recorded in the literature. Records of un-
successful attempts at hybridization are also included. The crosses
are grouped within families and are arranged alphabetically under the

scientific names of the species involved. Under each species is given a
full list of those with which it is said to have hybridized, or with which
it has been attempted. Whenever possible the direction of the cross
and the degree of fertility of the first generation hybrids are also
indicated.
The extent to which hybridization can take place is very surprising
to those unfamiliar with the subject. For example, the Mallard is said
to have been crossed with at least fifty different species of ducks and
geese and in many instances the cross is in both directions and fertile
hybrids are not uncommon. The domestic fowl, including both
Gallus gallus and G. domesticus , has been crossed with at least forty
other species including the turkey, but contrary to popular belief it
is stated that there are no authentic records of this particular hybrid
reaching the adult stage. In controlled experiments the embryos
invariably died before hatching.
The Blue-fronted Parrot, Amazona aestiva , the Crimson-winged
Parrakeet, Aprosmictus e. erythropterus, and Barnard's Parrakeet, Barnardius
zonarius barnardi , are all species with catholic tastes, and by a curious
coincidence each has been crossed with seven other species of parrot
or parrakeet.
The finches include several species which hybridize with other kinds
of birds, by far the best known example being the Canary, Serinus
canarius , which has been crossed with more than sixty different species,
but the hybrids are nearly always sterile.
The book ends with a bibliography containing well over 1,900
titles and there is an index of scientific and vernacular names. It is
unfortunate, however, that the author was not a little more critical,
for some of the records of crosses seem to have little more foundation
than the two birds being seen together. A much more serious defect
is the incompleteness of the bibliography which in spite of its 1,900
titles omits well-known publications dealing specifically with this
subject. For example there is no mention of Records of Parrots Bred
in Captivity, Parts V, VI, and VII, by A. A. Prestwich, published in
1952 and 1954, nor of the same author's Records of Birds of Prey Bred
in Captivity , 1950 and 1955, to mention only a few examples.

PUGNACITY IN SUNBIRDS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995566173913043" page_id="56311224"  page_num="152" year="" vol="">
I have never really gone in for sunbirds, much as I admire them, as I have always
been rather put off by the fact that their pugnacity renders it impossible to keep a
number--or even a pair, except just in the breeding season--together. I had not,
however, realized quite how pugnacious they can be.
Recently I obtained a pair of Malachite Sunbirds and thought I would try them
together in what was quite a large aviary for such small birds. But the cock chased
the hen about so badly that he had to be taken out at once.
He was then put into a considerably larger aviary where he looked very tiny
beside his companions--namely, a pair each of Ashy Doves, Scaly Doves, Yellow-
billed Cardinals, and Black-crested Yellow Bulbuls. In fact I was rather afraid the
latter might bully him.
I need not have worried, however, for he quickly proceeded to rule the roost himself.
If one of the Bulbuls has the audacity to come and sit near him it is instantly chased
away and round and round the aviary amid a volley of angry squeakings from its
diminutive pursuer. The other day one of the doves alighted beside the Sunbird
and was put to flight at once, nearly getting one of its tail feathers pulled out in the
process. I was afraid I should have to remove him, but he never molests anything so
long as the privacy of the perch he happens to be sitting on is respected, and his
companions are learning to do this.
Despite his being such a termagant, he is a most attractive and extremely intelligent
little bird, as well as an industrious songster, and I can quite imagine that a male
of this species in a cage would make a delightful pet, and quickly become tame.

THE LOSS OF RED COLOUR BY BIRDS IN CAPTIVITY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997487071428572" page_id="56311224"  page_num="152" year="" vol="">
Mr. Boosey's lament on the loss of red in captive birds is, I am sure, shared by
many. I think in some cases it is food. Mr. Boosey remarks that the Red-vented
Bulbul does not lose its red in captivity, but when it is fed largely on gram flour or
sattoo another change occurs ; the red feathers under the tail become edged with
black and indeed the whole plumage of the bird seems to become darker. Yet when
I have moulted a bird out on more natural foods, namely fruit, chopped-up lettuce,
and boiled carrot, of which it is very fond, the red moults through a pure colour and
the lovely mottling on the plumage reappears.
In the case of another Bulbul, the White-cheeked Bulbul of Sind, I have noticed
that when the bird is fed and moulted through on the usual food in captivity, namely
banana, boiled rice and boiled yam or sweet potato, the deep saffron of the wild
bird moults through as a lemon-yellow, but when I fed my bird largely on dates, the
deep saffron was retained. The same occurs with the White-cheeked Bulbul of
Kashmir, though another food must take the place of the date. White-cheeked Bulbuls
in Sind are particularly fond of the deep green leaves of the Tamarisk.
I really began this letter however, with the intention of drawing Mr. Boosey's
attention to a letter by J. Alastair Anderson in a back number of the Avicultural
Magazine, on page 63 of the 1938 volume. This letter refers to Vitamin A as restoring
the colour in a Nonpareil Bunting. Recently there was an article on the Red Cock of
the Rock (Avicultural Magazine, 1955, page 146) and so far as I remember the
writer described how he kept the colour by certain foods and when the bird was
looked after by another person the colour faded but was restored when the proper food
was given.
Many years ago I wrote a letter to our Magazine (1939, p. no) about the loss and
retention or restoration of colour in the Avadavat. In a book called Birds I have
Known by Arthur Beavan, published by Fisher Unwin in the year MCMV (work
that one out !) which I had as a boy, the author describes on page 252 how a pet
Linnet which he had reared, when three years old got the lovely rich red of the wild

cock. I believe also there was a letter in Cage Birds saying the red of the Redpoll could
be retained if the bird was kept in an outdoor aviary and was given the berries of the
Mountain Ash to eat.
I have noticed that with Purple Sunbirds the orange tuft of side feathers fades to a
yellow in captivity. Lord Tavistock wrote in our Magazine (1932, page 256) that
the red on a Sunbird was retained in a bird that escaped and fed on wild foods. I
wrote a letter to the Magazine (1928, page 96) asking how the Chinese retained the
red in the Rubythroat and Monsieur Delacour replied (1928, page 167) that the
Chinese fed raw minced meat and insects to the birds. Perhaps the Chinese have
this and other secrets ?
In Cage Birds (14th Aug., 1958) in "Answers to Correspondents" on a question of
the scarlet in the Virginian Cardinal, Allen Silver writes (page 159) that a Virginian
Cardinal moulted in captivity had retained its wild colour and was fed daily with
dates which it ate with avidity. So it does appear that food is one cause of the loss or
retention of colour, but there may be other causes.
Could not more members write letters to our Magazine ? It would, I am sure,
help other members and not least our devoted Editor. Members may hesitate or lack
the time or inclination, to write the more formal article but letters may give and,
in return evoke, most valuable information.

I was interested in a letter by Edward J. Boosey on the loss of red colours by birds
in captivity. Especially where he says the Red-eared and Red-vented Bulbuls both
keep their red. This is not so. I have both kinds and until last year they did keep their
red, but owing to a bad season and hedges ripped out and trees cut down the elder-
berries I had always relied on for colour feeding were in very short supply and both
birds had faded to a pink. This year I am colour feeding with the new colour food

CONFUSION CAUSED BY VERNACULAR NAMES USED BY
AVICULTURISTS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99441605" page_id="56311225"  page_num="153" year="" vol="">
British and American ornithologists have made much progress in recent years in
reaching agreement on uniform English names for birds found in both Check-lists.
For those birds which are merely casual visitors on one side of the Atlantic, the usual
standard name on both sides will be that by which the bird is known in its proper
home.
Aviculturists would not dream of inventing a series of names of their own for
British birds. Is it too much, then, to ask of British aviculturists that they refer to
American birds by the standard English names used in the American Ornithologists'
Union " Check-list " ? American ornithologists, particularly students of bird
behaviour, have learned that there is a wealth of information to be obtained from the
avicultural literature, but their task of mining for this wealth is doubled in difficulty,
thanks to the use of these unfamiliar names for familiar species.
This letter was prompted by Mr. Boosey's reference in the July-August number
to his pair of " Canadian Mountain Blue Robins ". " Despite their name," states
Mr. Boosey, " there is little of the Robin about them." But this is not their name in
the land of their origin (which is not necessarily Canada, as the breeding range of
this species extends almost to the Mexican border). Here the bird is officially known
by the simple and appropriate name of " Mountain Bluebird ". Is " Canadian
Mountain Blue Robin " an improvement ?

the following names used for North American birds ; with each I give the name used
in the A.O.U. Check-list (both English and scientific) :--
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.978966142857143" page_id="56311226"  page_num="154" year="" vol="">
" Nonpareil Bunting " = Painted Bunting ( Passerina ciris).
" Carolina " (not even " Carolina Duck " !) = Wood Duck (Aix sponsa).
" American Little Egret " ,== Snowy Egret ( Leucophoyx thula).
" Blue Robin "j = (presumably) Eastern Bluebird ( Sialia sialis).
" North American White-headed (or Bald) Eagle ", = Bald Eagle ( Haliaeetus
leucocephalus ).
" Virginian Cardinal " = Cardinal ( Richmondena cardinalis ).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.988647458333333" page_id="56311226"  page_num="154" year="" vol="">
There is, perhaps, more justification for this last name than for most, since there
are Cardinals other than the North American. However, " Virginian " is no more
appropriate for this species than would be, say, " Oxford Chaffinch " for Fringilla
coelebs. " North American Cardinal " would be more nearly suitable.
This problem, of course, is only one small portion of the general (and very vexing)
problem of English names for cage birds. The difficulties involved in trying to interpret
the avicultural literature are nowhere better illustrated than by Mr. Anderson's
letter in the May-June issue. Mr. Anderson apologizes for having called Excalfactoria
chinensis " Button Quail " in an earlier communication. But he then goes on to say
that " the true Button Quails are of the genus Turnix and Coturnix ." This, of course,
merely compounds the confusion, since Coturnix is the genus of the true Quail of the
Old World, and Excalfactoria is, by many authors, considered no more than a sub-
genus of Coturnix ! The true Button Quails, genus Turnix , are placed in their own
family Turnicidae, which is, on anatomical grounds, included in the order Gruiformes
or crane-like birds. The Chinese Painted Quail, which may be called either Coturnix
chinensis or Excalfactoria chinensis depending upon whether one is a " lumper " or a
" splitter ", is, of course, in the order Galliformes or fowl-like birds. The true Button
Quails ( Turnix) may be instantly distinguished from the true Quails by the fact that
the former lack and the latter possess a hind tee.
The literature of aviculture would be of far more value if aviculturists could
persuade themselves to adopt the English names used for birds in the ornithological
literature. Granted that the latter are by no means always consistent, but I believe
they are far less confusing in most cases than the alternative names employed by
aviculturists.

By S. C. Law (Calcutta, India)
Among many charming Indian birds the Dhyal, Copsychus saularis
(Linn.), is one which has all the qualities of a first-rate aviary bird.
The beauty of its form and plumage, its bold and confiding habits,
its fondness for human habitations, its sweet and varied notes--loud
and piercing, or sometimes mellowed, its pose and movement, either
at rest or in motion--all appeal to bird-lovers.
The Dhyal occurs in India, China, and some other parts of Asia.
It is extremely common and widely distributed throughout its native
habitat--mainly the plains and hill forests up to a certain altitude--
and its popularity with the local people can easily be guessed. But
as the old adage says, familiarity breeds contempt, and the bird is
not particularly appreciated by our countryfolk. Occasionally Dhyals,
mostly males, are kept in captivity as pets, and sometimes pairs are
found in the local zoos. The country's export trade in captive Dhyals
receives periodical impetus by outside demand, and on such occasions
many caged specimens are no doubt found in the bird market.
The Dhyal is attractive in colour, striking yet graceful, and has a
well-proportioned form--intermediate between the English Robin and
Blackbird. Its black and white plumage, closely resembling that of
the Magpie, is responsible for its English name of Indian Magpie-
Robin. The upper part of its body is black with a blue metallic gloss,
the white wing-coverts form a broad band and the under parts are
white from the chest downwards. The two centre pairs of tail-feathers
are black, the outer ones white, sometimes with a little black. The
beak is black, eyes hazel-brown, and legs dark plumbeous. The female
is similarly marked and is just as pretty, though her plumage is iron-
grey instead of black. The young birds resemble her and have buff
mottling on the breast and wings. This mottled character of the
juvenile plumage indicates the position of the species among robins
and thrushes. It has many traits in common with the English Robin.

S. C. LAW-THE DHYAL OR INDIAN MAGPIE-ROBIN
Fondly attached, like the Robin, to the proximity of man, it adjusts
itself remarkably to the changing circumstances and situations
resulting from human civilization. It is not a shy bird ; the male is
sometimes aggressively bold, but the female is retiring in her habits.
The pairs are not fondly attached to each other, and the two sexes
invariably keep at a distance from each other. This habit is not
unlike that of its pugnacious congener the Shama, Kittacincla mala -
barica (Scop.), which is a much more favourite bird for the cage.
Another characteristic common to both is the animated movement of
their tail-feathers. Watch the Dhyal feeding in its natural habitat
or in an aviary and you will not fail to notice its half-open, or almost
drooping, wing while it hops about in search of food, and at each hop
stops with a jerk of its tail spread out and turned upwards. Simul-
taneously it raises and depresses its body and flirts its tail. This tail-
play has been described as an affliction with a kind of St. Vitus's dance
in the mechanism of the tail. It consists of its expansion like a fan
so as to show the white outer feathers, then closing the tail and
jerking it up over its back.
The Dhyal readily takes to captive life. As in freedom, so in
captivity, its pugnacious habit is a warning that it is best kept either
singly or in separate pairs. Being unsociable in the wild and mainly
insectivorous, it is always wise to avoid keeping it in the company of
other birds of similar nature and habits, but it is easily managed in
a collection of seed-eaters and fruit-eaters. It is inordinately fond of
a bath, which must be provided, as its habit of bathing very early in
the morning as well as at dusk is so pronounced in its natural state.
It breeds in confinement, and quite freely in an aviary. A little
inducement such as throwing cockroaches or disabled insects in its
way makes it very tame in captivity. It is easily induced to breed
by supplying an earthen pot, or a little box, a small bamboo pole
with a convenient hole, or by devising a burrow or hole in the cage
wall, which the pair will not fail to accept for nest-making in the
breeding season. In the wild state, however, in the rural area of
Calcutta I have also found the Dhyal's nest in bushes and hedges
resting on a platform of twigs. Usually it lays five eggs, greenish with
rusty spots. But my experience with two or three aviary pairs some
years back showed three as the maximum complement of eggs laid in
their nests. However, perhaps one or two eggs laid outside the nest
may have escaped notice. As nest materials I have found coconut
fibres preferred to grass and roots. The eggs took fourteen days to
hatch out. The nesting time is usually from mid-April till July.
From an avicultural point of view the problem of breeding the
Dhyal is not so easily solved, especially with an unmated pair.
Introducing the cock to the hen, or vice versa, in the same compart-
ment has initial risks. At first what appears to be courting display

with loud outbursts of song tends more often than not to degenerate
into aggressiveness, furious chasing of one by the other, free fights,
etc., so that one bird is in danger of losing its life from damage and
extreme exhaustion. It is a case where only an aviculturist's ready
wit, forethought, and quick action can avert a serious mishap. As a
first step it is always prudent to keep the cock and hen separate in
adjacent compartments, in full view of each other, so as to allow
proper appraisal of their mutual behaviour and responsiveness in the
mating season. As soon as there are definite indications of their
wishing to mate they should be put together in the same aviary,
when the owner will find all his care and attention well repaid. Both
cock and hen not only take part in the construction of the nest but
also in the incubation of the eggs. As usual with insectivorous birds,
an adequate and constant supply of insect diet is indispensable at this
time to enable the pair to rear their young. One precaution, in my
experience, was found necessary ; namely, to segregate the cock bird
from its newly hatched young in a nearby compartment to avoid
over-attention.
As I have already mentioned, the Dhyal is often caged for its song,
also on account of its pugnacious qualities which are exploited by
indigenous people to capture wild ones.

The following comments have been received :--
Miss Barclay-Smith's account of the deplorable way in which a
consignment of African birds was treated by the exporters is a familiar
story. Years ago, there was the trade in West African birds between
Dakar and Marseilles, the grossly overcrowded cages travelling on the
decks of ships in all weathers, with the consequent tremendous loss of
life and great suffering of the unfortunate inmates.
In about 1930, when the ban on the importation, here and elsewhere,
of psittacine birds was imposed because of psittacosis, the conditions
under which the more common species of parrot were transported
were responsible. Had it not been for this, psittacosis might never
have been known among parrots.
This terrible cruelty and slaughter of bird-life has been going on for
a very long time. It occurs mainly among the common and easily
caught birds for which, presumably, the exporters pay very little to the
native catchers. Though the exporters are chiefly to blame, the importers
must also bear some responsibility, for they can surely stipulate that the
birds they are buying must be well cared for and properly packed.

Overcrowding at least should not be difficult to stop and this is
perhaps the greatest single cause of suffering and death.
In 1928 the Zoological Society set up a committee (on which our
President, Mr. David Seth-Smith served) and a booklet entitled
" Hints on the Transport of Animals " was published. This, of course,
dealt with mammals, reptiles, amphibians and the fishes as well as
birds, and it was revised a few years ago when the transport of the
smaller animals by air became the general practice. This publication
together with the recommendations of the International Committee
for Bird Preservation will prove a valuable guide in any action that
should now be taken, for aviculturists, through their various societies,
have a clear duty to perform here.

Although my experience of the transport of birds is very limited,
I can boast that of the few that I have consigned from abroad (to
myself), I have lost none. On the other hand a consignment of water-
fowl which was sent to me by an overseas zoo was so badly packed
that few survived. The greatest difficulties in the export of birds, how-
ever, lies not in the transport, but in the permit-getting and licence
hunting. During a stay in Australia, some years ago, I had some sad
moments and sore interviews with the officials concerned. The
Australian States each have their own laws regulating wild-life
protection and some of these States are extremely jealous of their
State-rights and their independence of the central authorities in the
federal capital of Canberra. I feel that if the federal authorities were
the only ones concerned in the export of fauna there might be an easier
flow of birds to aviculturists of any real competence ; instead, the
various States issue or forbid the issue of exit-permits for their fauna.
At the time of my visit, Tasmania, South Australia, and Western
Australia had sensible policies with limited numbers of licensed
trappers and exporters, and generally any properly accredited person
would be permitted to take out a limited number of individuals of
unendangered species trapped in the open season. I broke no teeth
in Victoria, but in New South Wales and to a lesser extent in Queens-
land it was excessively difficult to get out even the small numbers of
birds that I wanted : indeed there was a rather unpleasant attitude
in N.S.W.
In Queensland, personal caprice was also evident, for in this vast and
wonderful state the whole of wild-life protection was left to the part-
time duties of an official whose main duties (and interest) lay in
controlling honey-production and bee diseases ; his duty to the wild

fauna was a very minor one, but his interest in apiculture was evident
by the inclusion in the vermin list, of animals that might be destroyed
at any time of the year, of the superb little Australian Bee-eater !
I suppose that bee-eaters do kill some bees. I would emphasize that
all this happened years ago and things may have improved.
Of course the Australians are perfectly right in making the export of
their fauna as difficult as possible when one considers the appalling
conditions that some of the birds have to suffer during transit, and
in the trapping and holding periods. I remember my horror, years
ago, at London Airport when I went to collect some Sheld-Duck that
had been flown to me from Australia. In the same plane were some
dozens of boxes of finches and in the R.S.P.C.A. hostel receiving rooms,
an attendant was raking out dead bodies from these boxes till a sad
heap of Gouldians, Diamond Sparrows, and Bicheno's was piled
18 inches high on the floor. There must have been hundreds of
corpses. It is fair to say, however, that the plane had been delayed
in the heat of Bahrein. Incidently, we owe a great debt to the R.S.P.C.A.
for this hostel and I fear that few of us recognize this. Of the finches
that survived this ordeal of transport, and it can be an ordeal for
humans even with all the comforts, not a few would get their release
in crowded, noisy shops while the rest would soon succumb in some
miserable, dark bird-room or equally dreary back-yard " aviary ",
To those of us who have seen these wonderful little coloured finches
in their native habitats, and to the Australians whose wards they are,
this sunless prospect is appalling. Entrancing though the Gouldian
may be, I cherish particular memories of two, ordinary dull-coloured
species of Australian finches. The first was my first sight of the Long-
tailed Grassfinch : just a simple picture of twenty little birds under a
relentless sun and blue sky far out on the open plain, twenty birds
so gently moving through the bleached gold of the Mitchell Grass,
buzzing as they went, their tiny voices, that could never fill the vast
emptiness around me, only making the void more desolate. The other
was a typical water-hole scene where hundreds of finches came in the
early morning just before sun-up, mostly Cherry Finches, aptly
named Modest, to drink with the brilliant Pale-headed Rosellas and
Crimson-wings. Somewhere in the trees two Galahs were calling
" Cleecleeek ", a Maned Goose gave her snarling call in the distance,
and near at hand two Piping Crow-Shrikes (Magpies) chortled and
fluted tunefully. I still get a sharp pang of nostalgia when I hear these
sounds from captive birds at home.
Roseate Cockatoos, Swainson's Lorikeets, and Maned Geese are
abundant in Australia and immense numbers are destroyed each year
in the quite rightful protection of man's crops. It should be
remembered too, that many birds are a " crop " themselves and
that in default of harvest there is great wastage. Thousands of these

birds could be spared for export without any damage to the species,
and would bring great joy to people who would cherish them. After
all a given area can only support a certain number of birds ; the
excess is removed by predators, disease, drought, starvation, poison,
or the shot-gun. On the other hand it would be criminal to allow
the capture for export of species like the Orange-bellied Grass Parakeet,
whose numbers probably do not exceed 200 (but which I was privileged
to see). The Australians should remember too, that while they were
still careless of their fauna, aviculturists were maintaining some of their
endangered species. For a time it seemed as though the Cape Barren
Goose would soon join its related New Zealand Cnemiornis in extinction.
During this time I am sure there were more Cereopsis Geese breeding
in captivity than in Tasmania where hunters were still permitted to
shoot them. Happily the species has now been given full protection
since my return from Australia and is increasing again.
I hope that the export of fauna will be controlled strictly but not
entirely prohibited. I believe that no one should be permitted to
import the fauna of another country unless the accommodation
the importer can provide is suitable. I feel that only people accredited
by, and whose premises have been inspected by, say, the Nature
Conservancy, should be permitted to keep the wild fauna of any
country. This inspection would be costly but could be met by very
heavy dues on each import. One thing is quite certain that if a pair
of birds has cost him dear, the possessor will ensure that they get good
treatment and the incentive to breed them will be the greater. On
the other hand the suffering of a pair of waxbills at half-a-crown, is
likely to be mercifully short, and their loss will leave the buyer's
feelings but little moved and his pocket unwounded.
There is no denying that many field and museum ornithologists have
a strongly held antipathy to bird-keepers, quite forgetting that avicul-
turists can supply information about behaviour, plumage changes,
and reproduction much more readily and reliably than can field
studies and skin examinations. We must make quite certain, however,
that the conditions under which our birds are imported and main-
tained give these ornithologists no just cause for their dislike of us.

I read with interest our Editor's article on this subject and should
like to comment on it.
The trade in wild birds is condemned on the grounds of: (1)
Its cruelty and (2) Its (alleged) harmful effects on the species con-
cerned. On the first count it must be admitted that a great deal of
suffering is sometimes, indeed very often, entailed, not only in the

capture and transit of the birds, but also their fate after they reach
dealers, I imagine, and even after that. Dealers are usually willing
to sell to any buyer and often pretend that a bird is easier to keep in
health than is the case.. It is just those customers who are ignorant
of how to care for, shall we say (to take examples of species that I
have seen offered for sale in south-east London recently) a Hill Mynah,
a Pekin Robin or a Brambling, who are, quite reasonably, likely to take
the dealer's statements as entirely valid.
Very often the dealer is guilty of a great deal of unintentional
cruelty which a slight knowledge of bird behaviour on his part would
prevent. For example a " distance animal " such as, for example, a
Speckled Pigeon, unless it is very ill or in a state of intense fear, cannot
and will not allow another of its own kind, other than its mate or
young, to come very close to it. If one puts a dozen Speckled Pigeons
in a " nice big cage ", then injury to all the birds through fighting,
and very serious mutilation of the weakest ones is certain to result.
It is not only dealers who practise this sort of cruelty through ignorance,
some zoos are among the worst offenders. It is no comfort to a bird
to be in a large aviary if it is being harried about it all day long by a
mated pair of its own species, or half-starved because a stronger bird
keeps constant watch and guard over the food trays.
There is I think a very real need to campaign for the better and
wiser treatment of all captive birds, whether wild or domestic, but I
think this can best be done by precept and example rather than by
prosecutions, except, perhaps, in cases of flagrant and deliberate cruelty.
It is an unfortunate fact that many people who concern themselves
with the wrongs of animals, or rather with the wrongs of those animals
whose sufferings do not happen to benefit themselves, are ignorant
of the real needs of animals and, in some cases, are more concerned
with venting their own aggressive impulses by getting other people
into trouble than in alleviating animal suffering. Whilst those who
keep birds cannot justify any cruelties they commit on the grounds
that other people do worse, yet some of their detractors might well
and profitably whittle at the beams in their own eyes before they get
worked up about the motes in others ! Perhaps I can give an illustra-
tion of the sort of thing I mean, using examples that do not directly
affect us as aviculturists ?
Every so often there is an outcry in the popular press against stag-
hunting and in those instances where a stag has finally been killed
we read harrowing accounts of the cruelty of hunting, terrifying,
and finally killing such a " noble " beast. All true enough, except, of
course, that the stag is no more, if no less " noble 55 than a rat or a
cockroach. Yet let a bullock escape on its way to the slaughter-house
and the same newspapers label it as a " mad bull " and implicitly invite
us to revel in its terror, recapture, and slaughter. I hold no brief for

hunting (though in England such other methods of killing deer and
foxes as are commonly used are far more cruel) but for those who are
not strict vegetarians (foregoing milk, butter, woollen clothes, and
leather goods as well as meat) to condemn it on humanitarian grounds,
whilst doing nothing about the cruelties inflicted in their interests
on domestic animals, is sickening hypocrisy. The only difference
between the fate of the deer that is killed at the end of the hunt and
that of the cow, pig, or bullock in the slaughter-house is that the latter
has had no chance of escape at all. It has usually been subjected not
only to intense fear but to a considerable amount of physical pain,
and is often kept starving within sound and smell of the slaughter
for a day or so before being killed. This, of course, applies to those
instances where everything goes according to the official plan, if
(as slaughter-house workers whom I have had " off the record "
talks with have assured me is often the case) one or two sadistic
slaughter-house workers should decide to " have a bit of fun 55 the
agonies inflicted are infinitely greater and more prolonged.
Some " rabid 55 bird-protectionists may even try to prevent the
amelioration of suffering. As I go about London I usually carry a
pair of small scissors and if I see a pigeon or other bird with cotton
tangled round its leg try to catch the bird and remove it. Since
the cruel practice of placing tangles of black cotton over seed beds to
cripple or remove the feet of birds that try to walk about in them is
still legally permissible, a great many birds in London lose toes,
or even in some cases both feet in a slow and painful manner. (In
the country the victims are usually soon caught by some predator
so the results, though cruel, are not so long-drawn). The majority of
people are extremely sympathetic if I explain, as I always make a
point of doing, the reasons for my actions. But the more eager bird-
protectionists point out that, legally, I am not permitted to try to
help an injured bird, if this entails capturing it, since I am not a
qualified veterinary surgeon, and threaten to call the police. I invariably
tell them they can do what they like and so shall I, and members of
the crowd usually take my part and give them more emphatic and
less civil advice as to what they can do. So far their threats have not
been implemented, but I suppose if they were I should be fined or
imprisoned for an offence against the " Nation's Heritage of Wild
Life ".
On the question of the harm done to species--as distinct from the
suffering caused to individuals--I think there is very little positive
evidence against the bird trade. It does seem likely that unrestricted
trade in some of the Lovebirds ( Agapornis ) could have a disastrous
effect on them and it is possible that the bird trade was responsible for
the low numbers of the Goldfinch in Britain at the end of the last
century. Though the taking over of land by government and municipal

authorities and subsequent increased acreage of thistles probably
contributed more to the present happy abundance of Goldfinches
than the bird protection laws. Indeed, the bird trade and the practice
of bird-keeping has benefited many species (though often at a sorry
cost in terms of individuals) by distributing them widely throughout
the world. In cases such as the Spotted Dove, the Collared Dove,
and the Java Sparrow, one may perhaps question the benefits to man
and other forms of life. But at least one instance of this sort of thing,
the establishment of the Mandarin Duck in England, is in every way
to be welcomed, in view of its precarious position in its native haunts.
Now, if only the sportsmen refrain from persecuting it too much or
from over-filling all our waters with artifically reared Mallard, it
should be safe for a long time to come.
What good, if any, does the bird trade and bird-keeping serve to
offset its debit account ? Well it supplies the aviculturist who, at least
in some cases, is thereby enabled not only to get a great deal of
aesthetic pleasure which, if he looks after his birds properly is quite
an innocent pleasure that involves no cruelty, but also to make
significant contributions to our knowledge of bird behaviour. It
should be remembered also that those ornithologists who have con-
tributed most to the study of bird behaviour are, or were, in many
instances, people who first started keeping birds in early childhood
and thus early acquired an insight into their ways and sympathy with
them that so characterized and set its seal on their later scientific
works. So the suggestion sometimes made that only scientists
(already arrived at such eminence) or experienced aviculturists should
be allowed to keep birds is not so reasonable as it may at first seem.
So long as the interpretations of " rich " and " poor 55 which
she gives are honestly adhered to, none can gainsay our Editor
that there should be one law for the rich (favourable) and one law
for the poor (adverse) where the acquisition of birds is concerned.
But we should be careful to see that it is not applied according to
mere monetary wealth (by no means all rich people are knowledgeable
and humane, true though it is that poverty usually corrupts even
more quickly and certainly than wealth) and that every effort should be
made to instruct and encourage those poor in avicultural knowledge
but desirous to learn. At present our British bird protection laws are
decidedly biased in favour of the rich, in the usual, not in our
Editor's sense of the word. Compare the concessions made (quite
justifiably) to falconers and waterfowl keepers, who are usually either
wealthy and influential people or official bodies, with the lack of any
comparable concessions to those who wish to keep and study birds
that can be kept by a person of moderate means, such as finches,
thrushes or pigeons. Or again notice how the Goosander and Mer-
ganser can be legally killed as vermin on their breeding grounds

By Edward J. Boosey (Keston, Kent, England)
I write to record the breeding here at Keston this season of the
Purple Grenadier Waxbill ( Granatina ianthinogaster) , which is, I
(R) believe, the first time the species has been bred in this country.
Having for the past thirty-one years devoted most of my energies to
the breeding of parrakeets and parrots, I now find myself with an
ever-increasing interest in insectivorous birds and the rarer finches and
waxbills. And I am glad this should be so, because, even in these days
of endless bans and restrictions, one can still obtain such birds with
comparative ease, whereas the acquisition of the rarer parrakeets
has nowadays become what can only be described as a tiresome
obstacle race. I therefore decided to form a small collection of in-
sectivorous birds, etc., to be housed in a new range of planted aviaries
which I have had erected close to our terrace aviaries, and which are
ideal for insectivorous species as they each have a large heated shelter
with plenty of window space. These now house a pair each of Amethyst
Starlings, Superb Spreos, Japanese Blue Flycatchers, White-capped
Redstarts, etc.
In 1956 I purchased two pairs of Purple Grenadier Waxbills
(&amp;apos;Granatina ianthinogaster) and these seemed to settle down best in one
of the rather smaller terrace aviaries of the kind we use for housing
Grass Parrakeets. One of the hens died a month or two later, and we
sold the odd cock to one of our customers. I originally thought our
birds were G. ianthinogaster roosevelti, but after studying Messrs. Praed
and Grant's African Handbook of Birds , Series 1, Vol. 2, and noting the
slight differences, they mention between the two species, I have come to
the conclusion that they are the typical race G. ianthinogaster, whose
range is given as Eastern Africa : Central, Eastern, and Southern
Kenya Colony from the Tana River to Tanganyika Territory, as far south
as the Iringa area. The Purple Grenadier is of course closely related to
the well-known Violet-eared Waxbill ( Granatina granatina ) from South
Africa, but it is rather larger and of a more robust build. It is said

to be parasitized by Fischer's Whydah. The male has the head,
neck, and back chestnut brown, darker on the wings, and particularly
rich on the head and neck, and there is a small cobalt or violet blue
patch round the eye, narrower above and wider below it. The tail
is black and the rump cobalt blue. The breast and abdomen are rich
purple-violet rather unevenly marked with dark chestnut, and if only
this purple-violet colour was uniform over the whole breast and
abdomen, I think the Purple Grenadier would certainly be the most
beautiful of all the waxbills. The beak is red and the eye is ringed
with red. The female is quite distinct, being a warm brown above
and paler below, the breast being prettily speckled with buff and
whitish spots. The tail is dusky blackish and the rump is blue. The
patch round the eye is whitish, whereas in roosevelti it is said to be
more bluish. The upper mandible is blackish and the lower one
deep coral pink. When first fledged the young ones are little
earthy brown birds, paler below and darker on the wings, with
short dusky blackish tails and dull blue rumps. There are small
blue nodules at the base of the beak, which later disappear. Our pair
spent the later summer months of 1956 in an outdoor aviary of which
they were the sole occupants and were transferred for the winter to a
large cage in a heated birdroom. I was not actually looking after them
myself, but I paid them periodical visits, and about January I noticed
that the hen appeared to be somewhat bare about the head and had
difficulty in flying. I therefore had them given regular doses of artificial
sunlight, and myself gave them a constant supply of flowering poa
annua grass and millet sprays, after which they picked up in a remark-
able way--so much so that by the time that they were returned to their
aviary in the spring they were both in excellent fettle.
They were put into the same aviary as before with a fairly small
single-windowed shelter and a flight roughly 10 feet long by 5 ft. 6 in.
wide by 7 ft. 6 in. high. They soon went to nest in the shelter, but not
long afterwards seemed to lose interest and the nest was found to have
been taken possession of by mice. As the Grenadiers seemed to prefer
nesting in the shelter, we decided to move them into an entirely
mouse-free aviary with a larger double-windowed shelter, and as a
further precaution against mice, should any gain access to the aviary,
Mr. Cummings decided to fix up their nest-box, shielded with heather,
in the middle of a sheet of zinc which had previously been nailed to the
back of the shelter. They took to this at once, constructing a cosy little
spherical nest mainly of grass stems and lined with a few feathers, and
it was soon evident from their curved tails that they were sitting.
Of their seed mixture of brown Indian millet, white millet, and
canary, it was the latter that they always picked out, but what they
really like in the seed line is to live entirely on spray millet, and with
these we keep them constantly supplied. They are also very fond of such

greenfoods as flowering grass, chickweed, etc., and they were given an
assorted bundle to pick over every day. They were offered bread
soaked in sweetened milk, but were not particularly keen on it, and
they only ate a few of the gentles and mealworms with which they
were also supplied. What they really adored were live ant cocoons and
one of our aviary attendants was extremely good at finding and
supplying them with these.
We had not looked in the nest-box at all, but from the parents 5
behaviour it seemed fairly obvious that they had young ones. Eventu-
ally, when they seemed rather long in fledging, I decided to look in the
nest, because the aviary had become much overgrown with a tangle of
weeds and nettles, and as we were having the usual series of cloud-
bursts at the time, I was afraid they might fall into the weeds and get
drowned. A quick look in the nest showed that there were young ones,
but as I was hurriedly retreating they both jumped out of it--and
I have found that once that happens they will never stay in it, no
matter how many times one may put them back. One of them,
however, was quite ready to fledge and flew strongly, but the other
slightly younger one spent a day or two hopping about on low perches
that I fixed up for it close to the ground, but very soon gained its full
powers of flight, and meanwhile I had had the aviary flight cleared of
weeds.
The Grenadiers proved excellent parents, constantly fussing over
their young ones and uttering the little trilling policeman's whistle
note which is so exactly like that of a Red-headed Parrot Finch.
In addition, both sexes have a short but pleasing song which is like that
of the Violet-eared Waxbill, but rather weaker in volume. The
parents went to nest again, but a recent inspection of the nest before
taking it down disclosed only a single, apparently deserted, egg.
Although the young ones are now sufficiently grown-up to have
started singing, the old birds do not seem to resent their presence in the
least so, having ringed the young ones, we have decided to winter all
four together in the aviary, giving them heat in the shelter, instead of
transferring them to a cage in a heated birdroom.
I may add as a footnote that, despite the removal of their nest-box,
the parents, nothing daunted, are again sitting, having, painstakingly
constructed a new nest in a twiggy branch in a corner of the shelter.
As described above, E. J. Boosey has bred the Purple Grenadier
Waxbill (Granatina iathinogaster ). It is believed that this may be a first
success.
Any member or reader knowing of a previous breeding of this species
in Great Britain or Northern Ireland is requested to communicate at
once with the Hon. Secretary.

By D. H. S. Risdon (Dudley, Worcs., England)
When I reported this event to our Secretary I thought it might be a
first breeding for the U.K., but he tells me that Lorius garrulus --the
Chattering Lory--was bred by Lady Poltimore in 1913. As L. flavo-
palliatus is only a subspecies of L. garrulus there is, therefore, no particu-
lar honour and glory attached to what nevertheless I feel is an unusual
breeding worth recording. In any case, as the bird was bred at Dudley
Zoo we do not qualify for a medal, but when one considers the handi-
caps under which the parent birds reared their offspring, with screaming
multitudes milling round their aviary, and compares this with the
seclusion enjoyed by privately owned birds, I think all the more credit
is due both to the birds and their keepers !
I have written about this particular pair of birds in previous articles.
We have had them five or six years and every year they have nested
and laid without results until 1958. On one previous occasion they
did hatch a single young one which disappeared before it was a week
old. Their management has always been the same. They have spent
the winters in our heated bird house and the summers in a compart-
ment of an outdoor aviary provided with a nest-box. They are very
fond of the box and spend much time in it, even when not breeding.
Like most zoo birds they are tame and fearless. I think this factor
contributed largely to their success, as nervous birds would never
settle down to the constant comings and goings of humanity that are
inevitable in a place of this kind. The following account has been
compiled from the notes kept at the time by our senior bird keeper,
Mrs. E. Harris, to whom, by the way, all the credit should go, as she
and her staff had the care of the birds throughout the breeding period.
The birds were transferred to their outdoor aviary in May. The
size of this is approximately 6 feet wide by 12 feet long, with a shelter
at one end measuring 6 feet by 3 feet. The size of the nest-box, which
was of the standard pattern, was approximately 9 inches by 9 inches
by 24 inches high with the usual entrance hole high up in one side
near the top. A 4 in. layer of crumbled, rotten wood was put in the
bottom of the box. The Lories took to their box right away and as they
spent a good deal of time in it it was difficult to know exactly when
laying commenced. Throughout June, however, the hen was rarely
seen, so we presumed (rightly as it proved) that she was sitting. This
particular bird seems to lay a clutch of two eggs. This has been so in
previous years, when her eggs were infertile, as well as this year, when
an addled egg was found in the nest after the young one had fledged.
Early in July the hen began to reappear now and again and the cock

became more than usually aggressive. He is a demon at any time and
is always ready to nip the unwary finger, but as the young one began
to grow he became so savage that it was virtually impossible to enter
the aviary and all feeding had to be done from outside. Even so Mrs.
Harris did manage to get a peep into the nest-box on the yth July
and saw one youngster, which she estimated to be about a week old.
We were now somewhat concerned about suitable rearing food.
The parents are of course nectar and fruit eaters, but we felt that such
a diluted diet needed fortifying to supply the needs of a growing young
bird. We therefore concentrated the ingredients of the nectar mixture
by reducing the water content and offered every other conceivable
food we could think of. I had discovered in a previous year that these
Lories liked gentles and mealworms, so we offered these and they were
eaten with obvious relish. We tried such things as boiled potato,
boiled carrot, hard boiled egg, lettuce, and all kinds of fruit, but none
appealed like the gentles and mealworms. I think a great deal of our
success can be attributed to these.
On 19th July Mrs. Harris had another look in the nest-box and
reported that the young one was then covered with grey down.
Towards the end of July, as we all know, the mealworm famine
began, so we had thenceforth to rely entirely on gentles. Fortunately
these useful creatures were plentiful enough at that time of year. As
the young one grew the parents took to eating more fruit, particularly
apples and cherries and we now found it necessary to supply nectar
twice, instead of once, a day.
The young bird was seen poking its head out of the nesting hole on
26th August and it finally fledged on 3rd September--a perfect
specimen. We may, therefore, say that it took eight weeks to rear.
Its colouring was almost exactly the same as that of its parents, except
that it had a black beak instead of an orange one, and the iris of the
eye was black instead of light brown as in the adult. Surprisingly
enough its red colouring was as bright as that of its parents ; not as
one might have expected a duller shade. The baby became tame
almost at once and used to stick its little brush tongue through the
wire netting to " taste 55 ones fingers. Now in October the whole
family have been transferred to winter quarters in the bird house.
For those who do not know this Lory it is a bit bigger than a Senegal
Parrot. Its head and body are bright scarlet, wings dark green with
a vivid splash of yellow between the shoulders, tail dark green with a
dull red bar across it, seen only when the tail is expanded, tibia dark
green, feet black, and bill orange. The sexes are alike except that our
hen and the baby both have much more yellow on the back between
the wings than the cock. This may be a sexual difference or the cock
may belong to the race L. garrulus. The description in Aviculture is
somewhat confusing as it gives garrulus as having " a yellow band

across the shoulders " and fiavopalliatus as having " a bright yellow

from black to orange, but the iris remains dark.
This breeding of the Yellow-backed Lory is the only ray of light
in an otherwise gloomy breeding season with us this year. Apart from
a few Red-rumps and an odd young Rosella our parrakeets have
produced nothing but infertile eggs. Waterfowl have also been dis-
appointing. The Eagle-Owls have, however, again reared a nice young
one.

By J. O. D'eath (Hadley, Herts, England)
The following notes although not culminating in a complete success
story may prove of interest to fellow aviculturists who own waterfowl
collections and who have been under the impression that the sea-
ducks, including Eiders, are " difficult ". As a result, this most attrac-
tive species is rarely encountered in English collections and in my
opinion should be more widely represented.
It was not until the autumn of 1953 that I was able to fulfil my long
cherished ambition to re-establish Eiders in the collection here. This
particular species (Somateria mollisima) had long been a favourite of
mine since the pair I acquired in 1937 became casualties of the war.
Through the kindness of a friend I obtained, in 1953, two pairs
of hand-reared birds hatched from Icelandic eggs. Naturally, my
first thoughts turned to the feeding of the birds, which were released
in my general collection of some thirty species. My basic idea
was that the Eiders' diet would have to contain a high proportion of
fish in some form or another. Any doubts about selective feeding
were quickly dispelled when, in a short space of time, the birds became
remarkably tame and required little persuasion to feed from the hand.
It was, therefore, an easy matter to ensure that they received their
special diet without other species in the collection consuming it and
likewise to prevent the Eiders eating the grain put down for the other
birds.
I had carefully studied Dr. J. M. Derscheid's notes (Avicultural
Magazine, vol. 52, pp. 173-180) and decided that his recommenda-
tions, whilst undoubtedly the result of great experience and most
successful, were not practical for my purpose. Similar attention was
also given to advice on feeding Eiders by Laidlay (The Care and
Propagation of Waterfowl) and to other notes on the subject. Both
these authorities had advocated food which was either complicated

to prepare, or else likely to be in irregular supply. I therefore decided
that I would experiment with a mixture which has since proved most
successful. Initially I used medium grade, good quality, biscuit-meal
and having scalded the required amount added one-third boiled
cod's roe (which was obtainable regularly from local fishmongers).
It was later found that this could be mixed raw with unscalded meal.
The mixture was rolled into large pellets, about the size of a walnut,
and fed by hand to each individual bird (a minimum of six at each
feed). As an alternative, conger-eel, cut into adequate lengths, was
fed bi-weekly. Occasionally prawns and shrimps were fed as a
" cocktail ". After about twelve months, however, the preparation
of the aforementioned mixture became tedious and sometimes un-
pleasant in hot weather. I therefore decided to eliminate any natural
fish, and fed a mixture of two-thirds biscuit and one-third fish meal,
dried off with some growers' mash ; sometimes cod liver oil was
added. On occasion halibut oil was given for a brief period when
one of the birds appeared off colour. The Eiders in the collection
have now thrived on this feed for the last three years. It is, of course,
generally known that the Eiders, Sawbills, etc., at the Wildfowl Trust,
Slimbridge, are fed on raw eel, but high cost, uncertainty of supply,
etc., would, I think, defeat the average waterfowl enthusiast.
So much for feeding--now to turn to some observations on breeding
activities. I had not given any serious thought to the possibilities of
my Eiders breeding, consoling myself with the fact that keeping them
alive in good condition was an achievement in itself. Both pairs of
birds came successfully through the moult in 1956 and in the spring
of the year 1957 the drakes in full-dress were frequently displaying and
uttering their delightful AH-OOO. In spite of other aviculturists'
apparent difficulties in getting these birds through the moult, I have
never experienced any trouble in this respect. My only observation
on this supposedly difficult phase is that the Eiders feed more avidly
than usual. At no time did I observe mating and any wishful thinking
I had as to breeding was dispelled. Imagine my surprise and delight
when doing a routine round of the nest-boxes on May 7th. I turned
over the dead grass, etc., in a dog-kennel goose-box and there was an
ominous bump which I expected to prove a Barnacle egg, but in the
daylight left no doubt as to its identity--my first home-bred Eider egg.
Having overcome the initial excitement of this find, a careful watch
was kept on the box and my diary shows that a clutch of four eggs
was laid in the space of a week, i.e. on alternate days. The laying
bird was a dark-coloured duck, smaller in size than the other female
of the second pair.
At that time a friend of mine was setting a consignment of Icelandic
Eider eggs and I passed my clutch of four to him. My doubts expressed
previously as to fertility were endorsed when none of the eggs hatched,

but two of them had embryos inside. This concluded the Eider activity
for 1957.
Long before the birds had completed their moult which was
successfully achieved, my thoughts were already running ahead to the
ensuing season 1958. At the turn of the year two magnificent pairs of
four-year-old Eiders were a constant source of satisfaction to me and
the subject of much admiration from visitors to the collection. I was,
however, to suffer a serious blow when, in February, one of the drakes,
with little outward indication, suddenly died. A subsequent post-
mortem indicated a fatty condition of the heart. No replacement
for this bird could be found so I was left with a trio of Eiders. The drake
which died was the mate of the duck which laid in 1957.
I kept careful watch on the birds and on March 29th I noted mating
taking place between the laying duck and the drake of the other pair.
For the purpose of identification I will hereafter refer to this bird as
Female A and the other non-laying (1957) bird as Female B.
It was noticed that the drake had changed his affection to Female
A and showed definite animosity towards B. No other notes appear in
my diary until May 9th when Female B was recorded as missing from
feed. An intensive search on the 10th revealed her sitting on an
extremely well-concealed nest under a hollybush. This was indeed a
surprise, as the bird in question was the neglected female. I restrained
my curiosity to see what eggs there were until May 11 th when, on
lifting the duck, three eggs were revealed. A fourth egg was laid on
the 13th May and all four were removed and put under a bantam for
incubation. I thought it reasonable to assume that this would conclude
egg production for 1958. However, this was only a beginning, as a
brief account of subsequent events will show. On May 19th Female A
laid her first egg in a scrape against the perimeter wire fence and in due
course a clutch of four eggs was completed and removed for incubation.
We now had eight eggs from two ducks mated to one drake. I had
assumed that Eiders were monogamous and single-brooded as most
authorities indicate. I was away from home on the 27th-28th May
and on checking the collection on my return I immediately noticed
that Female B was missing. This caused me some alarm and I
wondered what tragedy had occurred in my forty-eight hour absence.
However, fears turned to incredulity when I located her sitting at the
base of a large Scotch pine in deep shade. I restrained my bursting
curiosity for a further two days and on June 1st I lifted the duck, to
reveal five eggs ! She had only laid four in the first clutch. I decided
to let her continue to incubate as I was not yet certain of the potential
fertility of her first clutch, still under a bantam.
At this stage I had thirteen eggs from the two ducks. The results
from the first clutches were disappointing ; in the case of Female A,
as the result of a terrific thunderstorm, the bantam let the eggs chill,

172 J. O. D'EATH - SOME EXPERIENCE WITH EIDERS IN A COLLECTION
after she had been incubating for twenty days. Two of these eggs
were fertile. The other clutch of four eggs from Female B were all
clear. However, I was not disappointed as I was inwardly delighted
that a precedent had been established by the two ducks laying. The
position, therefore, at the end of May was that Female B was sitting
contentedly on her second clutch of five eggs. My notes with regard to
laying activities are nearly concluded, but on June 7th the dark
Female A was acting suspiciously at the base of a young conifer
(.Picea excelsa) and by the evening of that day had laid an egg. By
June nth she had commenced to sit on her second clutch of three
eggs, having laid seven in all, making a grand total of sixteen eggs from
two ducks. Like any other aviculturist with experience of waterfowl
I did not give any serious thought to the possible fertility of the second
clutches, in view of the 25 per cent fertility in the first clutches.
However, I thought that by letting both ducks sit I might be able to
obtain data on incubation, etc. My notes show that the Eiders com-
menced to brood immediately the first egg was laid, and down was
added continuously. Unless the ducks came off at night, I never once,
in spite of close observation, saw them leave the nest. After four
or five days I attempted to feed both ducks on the nest and they
responded fitfully for the first fortnight, but would not feed at all after
that. As incubation proceeded it was noticeable that they became
decidedly weaker. It unfortunately did not occur to me until too late
that I could have acquired some interesting data by weighing the
ducks to compare their weight at the commencement and conclusion of
incubation.
With the two ducks sitting and Female B due to hatch on the
24th June, I decided on 13th June to remove her five eggs and com-
plete incubation under a bantam. Naturally I was not very sanguine of
any concrete results, but was delighted when two Eider ducklings
were hatched exactly on the twenty-fifth day of incubation. Both these
ducklings survived three days, but I have a special note in my diary
which reads " In my opinion, bantam hen too broody and did not
encourage ducklings to feed ". It may be of interest to note that shortly
after the removal of her eggs the duck referred to above found the
other sitting duck and sat beside her for the whole period of her
incubation !
On 6th July the dark Female A was due to hatch her three eggs.
So that the duck should not get on to the water with any ducklings she
might hatch I ran a small circle of wire-netting round the nesting-site.
On the morning of 7th July a sturdy Eider duckling was doing his best
to climb the wire. The duck was still sitting, but an immediate
examination of the two remaining eggs showed that they were addled.
On the spot I decided to make what to me was an interesting experi-
ment, i.e. to let the mother rear the duckling herself. An enclosure

some five yards square with rock-work at one end for the birds to rest on
was quickly constructed and the parent bird with duckling placed
inside. Having travelled so far my next dilemma was " how, and
what on earth I am going to feed the duckling on ? " The parent bird
did nothing to encourage her offspring to feed from a dish of food, and
the only alternative was floating food. I tried very fine biscuit-
meal in which the duckling showed interest, but this quickly became
saturated and sank. I then substituted ants' eggs being aware of their
better floating qualities. I envisaged following this up at the two
weeks stage with small particles of dried shrimp and prawn. I pinioned
the duckling at seven days and this caused no check. In the meantime,
the other duck got into the enclosure and shared the maternal duties.
This instinct, of course, has been recorded by several observers of
Eiders in the breeding colonies. All went well for eleven days, the
duckling visibly growing. But my increasing confidence in the success-
ful outcome of my experiment received a severe blow when on the
morning of 14th July I found the young Eider lying dead outside the
wire-netting. It looked as if one of numerous birds in the collection,
perhaps an Emperor Goose or Black Swan, had tried to enter the wire
enclosure and made a small gap through which the duckling escaped
and could not find its way back. This final stroke of misfortune rang
the curtain down on the interesting Eider activity of 1958.
To summarize what I have recorded here, it would appear that
Eiders can be kept in trios and that they will breed. Further, that they
will not only lay two clutches, but the second clutches will prove
fertile.
I mentioned at the beginning of these notes that I was not recording
a success story but only a partial one. However, like all aviculturists
armed with more experience, one looks forward to better luck and,
in conclusion, I hope we shall see this delightful species more strongly
represented in collections.

Zoo in the year 1957. Where once an immaculately kept lawn had
grown, there now stretched a swampy meadow. As soon as the lawn
had been flooded, the Flamingos themselves gave the final touches
to the new landscape. With mincing steps they walked lightly over
the wet ground, softening it with their webbed feet. At the same time
we added supplementary foodstuffs to ensure complete nourishment.
With the approach of the first warm spring days, some of the birds
perched upon elevated spots and, with their beaks, began arranging
small clumps of earth in layers around them ; within a few days these
had distinctly taken the shape of mud-nests. About nine birds were
busily engaged in building when a cold spell set in, putting an end to
the breeding inclinations of most of the builders. Work continued
on four nests, however, and, on 6th June, 1958, we saw the first egg,
which was carefully tended by the female Flamingo. She fondled
and moved it constantly with her beak and, when on the days following
three further eggs appeared in the other nests, the hatching business in
our colony was in full swing. The males regularly took turns in sitting
on the eggs and each pair defended its nest against the others.
Flamingos mostly lay only one egg which is guarded with the utmost
care. To allow the egg to cool from time to time, the parent bird
stands up and turns it with its beak.
We were almost ready to believe that the hatching attempts were
doomed to failure. It is known that these long-legged birds find
difficulty in courtship owing to one of their wings being clipped.
One egg that had unfortunately rolled out of the nest proved to be
infertile. Then, to our great astonishment and delight, on 12th July,
after twenty-nine days' incubation, a little ball of fluff with tiny pink
legs and a pink beak was hatched. At first the moist downy feathers
clung to the small, rapidly breathing body, but soon they unfolded
and the tiny bird crept from under its mother's sheltering wing and
peered curiously over the edge of the nest into the strange wide world.
A few hours after the birth the Flamingo father bent over the nest
and fed many drops of black juice from his stomach into the young
bird's beak. Five days elapsed before the newly born chick ventured
to leave its hill-nest, only to climb back into it again very soon. These
expeditions were to become a daily event, however, always being
prolonged, and before long the little Flamingo proved itself also able
to swim.
Both parents concern themselves with watching over their off-
spring who, ever again, returns to its nest to be warmed by its mother.

Now, in the middle of October, the young Flamingo in its brown
plumage is still being fed two or three times daily by its parents.
It displays such an abundance of life that there seems to be every
justification for the hope of seeing it grow up happily.
In the large aviary where the Red-cheeked Ibises, Comatibis eremita,
have already brought up two families, the Gough Moorhens have
successfully raised three chicks. They were hatched on 16th June,
and are now moulting, their first brown feathers being replaced by the
black plumage of the adult bird.
From a pair of Tasmanian Waterhens, Tribonyx mortieri, we have
reared seven chicks this year. The first three eggs were incubated
artificially. Afterwards the female took care of another clutch of
four eggs, but we had to remove them shortly before they were hatched.
Four young ones have already been raised. Some of these birds are
living in complete freedom in Basel Zoo and are so tame that they will
eat out of your hand.

MANED GEESE

By J. G. Laidlay (Perth, Scotland)
Undoubtedly one of the joys of Aviculture is the successful breeding
of one's birds. What is the cause of any success is so often difficult
to determine. Seven or eight years ago some wild caught Maned
Geese came into my possession, one male and two females. Four years
later five eggs were laid, one broke in the nest and four young were
reared, three females and one male. I kept two of these females and was
given a drake. Last year there were no eggs, this year the two old
ducks laid clutches of seven and eight respectively. The clutch of
seven all hatched and were all reared. None of the eight clutch hatched,
and though the drake was seen treading both ducks he went about with
one only, driving the other one away. I think, and of course it is only
a guess, that possibly this duck was a sister ; waterfowl usually do not
breed successfully when closely related and if the practice is continued
over a period of years complete infertility results. It is difficult and
dangerous I well know to lay down any law in Nature, but as far as I
can observe one or two conditions are needed in the spring to satisfy
the Maned as to nesting, i.e. mild, hot days, producing grass, is
obviously one and I should say that they certainly like, and may need,
a rather mixed diet and definitely prefer some rather strong scented and
tasty green food. Here, with me, anyway, thyme, mint, and dandelion
they love best of all, also all forms of campanula and pinks are hunted
for and eaten. With regard to nesting boxes they like them fairly high
up and well-screened. The drakes start the business of nest hunting,

going in and out of them before the ducks do. This year my two
young ducks with their drake went through all the motions of nesting,
treading, visiting nest boxes, etc., but did not lay. When are Maned
adult ? To go back to the seven young that did hatch, they all started
grazing on their third day and all were fully grown by seven weeks.
They were fed on " turkey starter " meal soaked to a mealy con-
sistency with milk and one hard-boiled egg grated fine, with chopped
lettuce. This was their diet when shut up at night in their coops. It
is interesting to hear that Heer D. G. Schuyl, of Rotterdam, has reared
four this year. Terry Jones had one young one. All these five birds
were females, five out of my seven are females, three of my previous
four were females, this seems to be a great predominance of females.
Does this apply in Nature ? Terry Jones has, I believe, a second
clutch, possibly sexes may then balance a bit. Since writing above
notes I hear the second clutch were females.

We finally came to the conclusion that we really had far too many
birds. Drastic reductions were made during the autumn and several
zoos were considerably enriched thereby. But such is the way of
aviculturists, other birds have gradually replaced them. Perhaps the
most interesting, at least from a sentimental point of view, are the
pair of Blue Crossoptilons, " Emma " and his mate, the rearing of
which was described by the late Sydney Porter in the Avicultural
Magazine, 1957, 52. Also from " The White Gates " we had a pair
of Sheld-Ducks. Our entry into the ranks of waterfowl keepers proved
a dismal failure. We put them out on the lawn and they gave us great
pleasure, but for how short a time ! During the very first night of
their liberation the duck disappeared without leaving trace. We
then decided waterfowl were not for us, so we sent the drake to " White-
abbey 55 to live in ideal surroundings with Sir Crawford McCullagh's
numerous ducks.
Breeding successes amongst the parrakeets were few and far be-
tween, so many of our birds are in the doubtful starter class--Pata-

gonian Conures, White-bellied and Black-headed Caiques, Green-
winged Kings (probably both males), etc. The small flocks of Lineo-
lated Parrakeets and Abyssinian Lovebirds did, however, manage to
increase their numbers.
The Red-faced Lovebird colony is now somewhat reduced, but still
numbers twenty-six. Once again they proved comparatively hardy.

The losses directly attributable to the weather were one male and one
female. Two females were brought in egg-bound during December ;
these responded to treatment and were eventually returned to the
colony. As far as we can at present tell there is only one young one in
evidence, but there may be more to come--we hope.
The Fruit Pigeons have not done well. The old breeding pair of
Green Imperials nested five times, but so far have succeeded in rearing
only one young one. The first egg failed to hatch although it con-
tained a fully developed chick : second nest, young reared : third
nest, young hatched but was crushed after two or three days : fourth
nest, young died after three days : fifth nest, young in process of being
reared. There was a rather remarkable occurrence with the young
one already reared. Two days after hatching it somehow fell or was
dragged from the nest and was found lying in the sand below, cold and
apparently lifeless. By means of much breathing on it our attendant
managed to revive it sufficiently to enable it to be returned to the nest,
when the female immediately brooded it. How it managed, when only
some forty-eight hours old, to survive a fall of about five feet is more
than we can explain. But survive it did and it is now perfect in every
way. Another pair made a half-hearted attempt, making little effort
to incubate their egg. Whereas last year the Pied Imperials laid four-
teen or fifteen eggs, this year they have not managed a single one.
This may possibly have been because we tried all six together as a
colony. At present we have thirteen of these voracious Imperials--it
is difficult to visualize just how much fruit they consume during the
course of a week !
The Lemon Doves, as described in the last number of the Magazine,
reared two young ones, but the smaller, never a particularly good bird,
died as a result of a chill after failing to shelter from a thunderstorm.
During the first week of August the female laid again : one egg hatched
on the 18th, the other being addled. After seven days she deserted
and the chick was given to a pair of Barbarys with one young one
about the same size. It throve amazingly as it received the sole
attention of its foster-parents, their own young one having fallen on
been pushed from the nest within a few days of the introduction of the
" cuckoo The young Lemon prematurely left the nest on 4th
September and, as it did not appear to be getting sufficient food, it
was taken for hand-feeding. This was successfully accomplished on
a mixture of fine biscuit meal, egg yolk, and " Stimulite No. 1 ",
moistened with milk. Another young one was hatched on 9th
September and was deserted almost immediately. It, too, was trans-
ferred to a pair of Barbarys, but on this occasion they failed to feed it.
From time to time we have had some extremely quarrelsome and
spiteful doves and pigeons, but certainly none more vicious than our
Black Bronze-winged Henicophaps alhifrons schlegeli. All four were housed

together for the winter and one unhappy day two or three set about
the fourth, possibly it was a little off-colour, and with their sabre-like
beaks literally tore it to pieces. Strangely, and most unfortunately,
it was the only female of the quartet. The three males have moulted
into really handsome birds.
Our most important recent arrivals are six Galapagos Doves
Nesopelia galapagoensis, bred byj. W. Steinbeck, of Concord, California.
We have only six species of the more common pheasants. We are
not very successful in breeding them, mainly because we do not keep
any of the breeds of bantams recognized for their fostering abilities.
We make do with our Araucanas and there never seems to be one
broody just when we need it. This year it has been even worse than
usual : the majority have not gone broody at all, and the few that have
have done so too late to be of much use. Owing to the excessively wet
weather we have not reared Chinese Painted Quail in our usual
numbers.
In the wilderness aviary losses during the winter were negligible.
Numerous Bronze-winged Mannikins, Zebra Finches, etc., have been
reared, but in general the results have been rather depressing. Starlings
and Mynahs hatched many young but only an occasional one was
fully reared--this in the main owing to the mealworm famine at
critical times. Almost unlimited quantities of gentles are not a
satisfactory substitute.
Our most regrettable loss during the year was " Jobo ", the East
African Brown-headed Parrot Poicephalus cryptoxanthus, which was the
subject of the coloured plate in the January-February, 1955, number
of the Magazine, and which had been with us well over ten years.

Most parrakeet keepers this year on the Continent have been bitter
about the weather during spring and summer, which upset many of the
breeding pairs. For me the breeding season this year has been a
moderately fair one. The majority of my parrakeets seemed reluctant
to come into early breeding condition, nevertheless all my pairs went
to nest except the Kings which refused to breed ; the 1956 imported
hen seemed to be too young, the cock started feeding his hen and was
very temperamental, but the hen took no interest in their nest-box.
My pair of Many-coloured of that brilliant, light green colour had
a clutch of five fertile eggs and five chicks hatched, but the cold May
nights must be the reason they have not been reared to maturity.
My pair of uncommon Green Rosellas, also called Tasmanian Rosellas,
has reared seventeen youngsters in three years and this year again
reared five youngsters, two cocks and three hens.
A pair of Pennant's, the hen of which was bred here in 1957, laid a
clutch of eight eggs, all proved fertile, but failed to hatch. This young
hen did not sit well enough. A second pair of Pennant's also laid a
clutch of eight eggs, seven chicks hatched but only two were reared to
maturity, the other five died, I believe on account of bad weather.
A third cock Pennant's mated to a Yellow Rosella (Platycercus flaveolus)
laid a clutch of five eggs and reared five healthy youngsters which,
I suppose, will resemble the Adelaide variety.
A fine pair of Crimson-winged, which every season rear a brood,
had three youngsters but only reared one to maturity.
My lutino Ring-necked this season reared only one chick, which
I believe to be a cock. I have had bad luck with my Princess of
Wales. The hen laid three clutches, eight chicks hatched, but all
perished in the nest-box. I believe the cock interfered and killed the
chicks.
A Turquoisine hen laid five eggs, but all proved clear ; the cock
came into breeding condition too late. Bourke's did not fail to rear
a few chicks as usual. All my Bourke's are that very rich colour, with
bright breast.
It would perhaps interest our parrakeet breeders to hear that
during the past few years a few cinnamon Bourke's have been bred
in Belgium. These cinnamon Bourke's look very nice, with pale
colours and rosy bellies.
My Splendids did very well. A pair imported from Australia
reared five chicks in two broods. A second pair, coming into breeding
condition somewhat later, laid four eggs and reared four chicks,
all very well sized and shaped. Young Splendids when in good

at that age their first red feathers on the chest.
So, as usual, 1958 had its successes and failures, and I believe I had
my share of both.

Results have been reasonably good at Littledean this year in spite
of the very damp and miserable summer.
Two pairs of Red-rumps produced nine youngsters.
Princess of Wales.--Two young from four eggs.
Bourke's Parrakeets had three nests. The first in March when five
young were frozen to death due to the hen being off the nest for a
very short period, the weather was bitterly cold. The second nest
produced three young from five eggs ; one youngster died just before
leaving the nest. From her last nest two young were fully reared.
Golden-mantled Rosella.--Nine fertile eggs laid, five hatched and
then the lot were deserted because I disturbed the hen by opening the
nesting box when she was sitting. There must be a moral here
somewhere.
Lineolated Parrakeet.--The hen vanished for weeks into a hole under
the concrete step that is in their aviary but whether she laid or not
we cannot tell, certainly she reared no young.
Abyssinian Lovebirds.--Four young dead in shell. Quite happy
about this, at least they did try this year.
Indian Ring-necks.--The pair that I've carefully cosseted for two
years moulted into two magnificent cocks.
Barrabands.--Hen too young to go to nest.
Rock Peplars.--I lost the cock bird in the spring and was unable
to replace him in time to give the pair a chance to breed.
Anderman Starlings.--A pair made a nest of sorts in an old parrakeet
nest-box but did not lay.
Chinese Painted Quail.--Reared four after losing their first three
by accident. They were drowned in the water dish. The hen laid
thirty-odd eggs.
Mistle Thrushes.--A pair of these very attractive birds reared two
nests of four until nine or ten days old before losing them : we just
could not supply enough live food. They are delightful aviary birds,
quite fearless and very confiding. The hen of my pair nested only
4 inches from the wire netting and nothing would disturb her.
From the Pheasants we had eggs of Goldens, Amhersts, Versicolor,
and Old English Black-necks then lost the lot, forty-seven, through
the incubator failing at almost hatching point. We are having the

incubator converted to electricity this autumn but it is rather like
locking the stable door after the horse has gone.
The breeding of the Princess of Wales is particularly gratifying. We
had them quite early in the spring and put into their aviary our usual
parrakeet nesting box. The hen would not look at it. We put another
type of box in, this time hanging it fairly high up, but to no avail she
would not even alight on it although we did see the cock give it a
cautious " once over ".
Through the help of a good friend we eventually got an enormous
" grandfather clock " nesting box over seven feet tall. We rammed it
hard with turves, threw in a few pieces of peat and waited to see if it
met with the hen's approval. She approved, and within a week was
sitting. She proved an exemplary mother and reared two fine young
ones ; she had a clutch of four eggs but two of them were clear.

A specimen of Mantell's or the North Island Kiwi (. Apteryx aus-
tralis mantelli ), presented by the Government of New Zealand, arrived
early in October. It is a bird that had been accidentally caught by the
foot in a trap and so successfully treated that, apart from having
lost the tip of one toe, it is in good condition.
Mantell's Kiwi has been kept at Regent's Park on a number of
previous occasions, the record of longevity in the Gardens being just
over nineteen years. Others have lived from ten to thirteen years and
several eggs have been laid.
Birds new to the Collection are a Uganda Green Pigeon ( Treron
australis granviki), presented by Mr. J. R. Newmark and a Himalayan
Ruby-throat ( Erithacus p. pectoralis) received in exchange.
Mr. E. H. Hawke has sent a gift of Sunbirds--South African Olive
(Cyanomitra o. olivacea), Eastern Little Purple-banded ( Cinnyris bifasciatus
microrhynchus) , White-bellied ( Cinnyris talatala anderssoni), Scarlet-
breasted ( Chalcomitra senegalensis gutturalis) i and Kirk's Amethyst
(Chalcomitra amethystina kirki).
Dr. K. C. Searle has presented a Great Barbet ( Megalaima v. virens),
a Mongolian Lark ( Melanocorypha mongolica ), a Grey Thrush ( Turdus
cardis ), and a Silky Starling (Spodiopsar sericeus).
A hawk which flew on board a ship some 500 miles westward of the
Azores during September was brought to London by Mr. E. H.
Burke, and proved to be the nominate race of Falco sparverius , known here
as the American Kestrel and in its native land as the Sparrow Hawk.

Two more Gough Island Moorhens have been bred. The older
chick helped the parents in the care of the younger ones, driving off
other birds that ventured near and sometimes giving assistance with
the feeding. Two Sonnerat's Jungle Fowl, a second Superb Starling,
and a Malayan Glossy Starling have been bred. The Greater Sulphur-
crested Cockatoo has now left the nest, though it goes back to roost.
It is still being fed by the parents.
An African Cattle Egret or Buff-backed Heron was hatched and
lived until it was about half-grown.
A Slender-billed Cockatoo that was said to be eighty-five years of
age when it was received in 1937 has died. This was the bird known
as " Old Bill 55 and was quite a talker. If it was as old as it was reputed
to be, this may be a record for the species. There are various records
of cockatoos living to great ages in captivity, one Greater Sulphur-
crested in Gloucestershire living to 120 years and another in Sydney
(described as " oldest inhabitant " of that city) about which an account
appeared in Country Life in 1916, and which was still living at 119 years.
It was, if I remember, the Rev. C. D. Farrar who told the story of the
parrot that was bequeathed together with a very generous annual
payment for its keep. This particular species was easily and cheaply
replaced in those days, so that particular bird " lived " for a remarkably
long time.
It is, of course, a popular belief that any parrot will live in captivity
for very many years, and this calls to mind Long John Silver's
pronouncement on longevity in these birds. " They lives for ever
mostly," he said.

Members of the Club, 69 ; guests, 58 ; total, 127.
Before introducing the speakers for the evening the Chairman
welcomed Professor Jacques Berlioz, the world-authority on Humming
Birds, and said she had great pleasure in announcing that at the
Council Meeting that afternoon Professor Berlioz had been elected
an Honorary Fellow of the Society. Professor Berlioz, in his usual
charming manner, expressed his thanks for the honour accorded.
The Chairman also welcomed the Marquis Fioravanti, of Florence.
Introducing Mr. and Mrs. R. E. Darnton the Chairman reminded
members that this was the fourth occasion on which they would have
shown some of their films. The first had been " From Hippos to
Sunbirds ", followed by " From Flamingos to Rhinos " and " Tobago
and Nesting Flamingos in the Caribbean " : and now " Birds, Beasts,
and Butterflies of Equatorial Africa ".
Needless to say, the present film is of the very high standard
associated with Mr. and Mrs. Darnton. Its variety may be judged
from the following short summary supplied by Mrs. Darnton :
" The film opens in the Belgian Congo with various roadside
scenes, a colourful native market, and the great rivers of lava which
have flowed over the years from a still active volcano, into the waters
of Lake Kivu.

At Kisenyi, the Resident, M. Weber, kindly arranged a Watutsi
dance for us to photograph. After a few days spent in the Parc Roi
Albert, we revisited the Queen Elizabeth Park in Uganda, and could
not resist taking some further pictures of the many water birds which
frequent the shores of Lake Edward.
We then drove on to Kenya, where we stayed in the various reserves,
including the Marsabit in the Northern Province. Here we found
the Uaso N-Yero in flood, our car fell into a flooded donga and we
were marooned in camp with only one tin of soup and one ounce of
cheese left ! However, we managed to film some birds and beasts in
spite of the weather. 55
The sustained applause at the end showed that the large audience
fully appreciated the skill and patience required for the taking of
such a film. The Chairman summed up the highlights and thanked
Mr. and Mrs. Darnton for giving the Club a memorable evening.
The next meeting of the Club is on Monday, 12th January, 1959 .

reared seven good young this year. He is a fine, big bird and in the
course of his life has reared between sixty-five and seventy young,

feather to grow on the head or neck of his hen and this gives her a
curious appearance, quite vulturine. Also she naturally feels the cold
in the winter. He does not pluck any other part of the hen or any other
birds. Whether in his avian mind he thinks that this makes her less
attractive to rivals I do not know, but I have never known her to
wander. In fact, I have always found them most affectionate to one
another."

THE LOSS OF RED COLOUR BY BIRDS IN CAPTIVITY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999277076923077" page_id="56311268"  page_num="186" year="" vol="">
Mr. John Yealland has kindly drawn my attention to the recent letters from
Mr. Edward J. Boosey, Sir Godfrey Davis, and Mrs. D. E. Bucksey on the loss of
red colour by birds in captivity.
Red colour in feathers is due to the presence of pigment, which may be one of at
least four different types. In touracos the red wing feathers are coloured by turacin,
a copper porphyrin pigment unknown elsewhere in the animal kingdom. Some red
feathers, usually the red-brown ones, owe their colour to melanins, a group of pigments
which also gives blacks, browns, greys, and even yellows. The third group of pigments
gives yellows and reds in the feathers of psittacine birds ; the chemical composition
of these pigments is still unknown, but their production does not appear to depend on
food. These parrot pigments are not found elsewhere among birds and the fact that
their production appears to be independent of the type of feeding explains the clear-
cut observation of your correspondents that psittacine plumage does not fade in
captivity.
The fourth group comprises yellow and red carotenoid pigments, which are
widespread among plants and animals, giving colour to carrots, capsicum, tomatoes,
yew berries, prawns, lobsters, starfishes and many other living organisms. There
are at least 60-70 naturally occurring carotenoid pigments, many of which are well-
known chemically. Among birds the feathers of canaries are coloured by a carotenoid
and there are many other species coloured by one or other of these pigments. Recent
research has shown that the dark red and violet feathers of some cotingids are coloured
by rhodoxanthin, a carotenoid occurring in the leaves and fruit of some plants. The
pink of flamingos is caused by the deposition of a reddish carotenoid, which is probably
identical with or very closely related to astaxanthin, the red pigment of prawns
and cooked lobsters. The pink colour fades in captive flamingos unless the food contains
substances such as cockles, shrimps and so on which contain either the right carotenoid
or one very closely related to it. I have less definite information on the feather pigments
of the numerous passerines kept in captivity in this country, but I would suggest that
many of the reds are actually carotenoid and not melanin and that their fading in
captivity is due to a lack of the correct carotenoid source in their food. In some
cases the bird may be able to take in a yellow carotenoid and change it, in the body,
to a red carotenoid. This is, however, by no means the rule, and certain carotenoids
such as lycopene (from tomatoes) or violaxanthin (from pansies) are not assimilated by
birds and therefore do not appear in the feathers.
In the Orange Weaver, Mr. Boosey says, that the vivid geranium red of newly
imported birds fades to orange, while in the Pin-tailed Nonpareil the crimson breast
patch fades to a straw colour. This suggests that the original pigment is a true red
carotenoid present in the natural diet, but lacking in that fed to captive birds, and that,
although the birds absorb yellow carotenoids, they are not able to change them to
red ones. More or less all vegetable foods contain yellow carotenoids and these would
be taken up by the bird and deposited to give the disappointing oranges and yellows.
There is no virtue in feeding red foods unless they are known to contain carotenoids.
Thus beetroot is not suitable, nor is cochineal which contains a red pigment totally
different from the carotenoids and which, as far as I know, has never been found in
birds. It might, however, be worth trying to feed with seeds or fruits known to contain
red carotenoids, for instance
Capsicums, which contain capsanthin, or
Yew berries, which contain rhodoxanthin
I can assure Mr. Boosey, that there are quite a few scientists who work on animal
pigments rather than atomic piles. The results of their work are spread throughout
thousands of scientific papers and at the moment Professor H. Munro Fox, F.R.S.,
and I are actively engaged in preparing a book on the nature of these colours.

In his article on the Bengal Pitta Mr. Reid Henry misquoted me as saying of this
species in my book Foreign Bird Keeping, " It is by far the most commonly imported
into Europe." Actually I should not have been likely to have said this, as much of
my book was written during that long sterile period just after the war when no foreign
birds of any kind were allowed to be imported.
What I actually wrote was : " It is the only member of the family that was ever at
all commonly imported into Europe." I was thus clearly referring to the past, and
my statement therefore remains true, no matter how many Hooded or how few Bengal
Pittas Mr. Reid Henry may since have seen in this country.

I note that Mrs. D. E. Bucksey flatly contradicts my statement that Red-vented and
Red-eared Bulbuls retain their red after a moult in captivity, saying : " This is
not the case." May I repeat, therefore, that, in my experience, it is so ?
Off and on over the years I, too, have kept both species, and at present I have a
pair of Red-eared Bulbuls which not only did not lose their red in captivity, but
actually gained it--without the help of elderberries or colour feeding.
Aviary-bred in this country, they came to me in juvenile plumage with light brown
ear patches. Since then they have moulted twice, and the ear patches are the same
bright scarlet-- not pink--as those of imported specimens.

JAPANESE BLUE FLYCATCHERS, COLOURS OF MALE AND FEMALE
WHITE-CAPPED REDSTART, LOSS OF RED COLOUR BY BIRDS IN
CAPTIVITY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996157258064516" page_id="56311269"  page_num="187" year="" vol="">
I very much enjoyed reading Edward Boosey's account of the rarer species in the
collection at Keston. I well remember the hospitality extended to me there when I
was last in England during the appalling January-February weather of 1956. How-
ever, I feel it is my sad duty to disabuse him of the idea that he possesses a true pair
of Japanese Blue Flycatchers ( Cyanoptila cyanomelana cyanomelana ). The adult female
of this species possesses neither blue nor black anywhere in the plumage ; the overall
impression is that of a pale, olive brown bird with some russet on the rump. The
centre of the throat is more or less whitish and the lower abdomen and under tail-
coverts very obviously so.
During the spring passage through South-East China, numbers of these birds are
trapped and then become available here in Hong Kong. As always, the females
are few in number ; largely, I suppose, because the trappers can see little value in
the dull coloured hens. In a consignment of fifty or sixty birds one is lucky to be able
to pick out one or two females. A few birds are sometimes caught on the return
migration during September and October and at this season immature males can
sometimes be obtained. In general, the plumage colour is that of the female, but here
and there bright blue patches appear to a lesser or greater extent. In some birds just
a few bright blue feathers on the crown can be seen while in others large patches
of blue coloration show on the head, wings, and back. The first time my Chinese
dealer friends brought me two immature males they were highly delighted at the
thought of having produced something new. Knowing my avidity for out-of-the-way
flycatchers the initial price quoted was very high !
Immature males that I have bought in the Autumn have not assumed the full blue
and black markings of the adult until the following July. At the time, I had supposed
this was delayed by the conditions of captivity. This March, however, having picked
out one brown bird from some fifty odd blue males I was disgusted, on closer examina-
tion, to find a few bright blue feathers on the crown and scapular region.
La Touche mentions two other races of this species-- Cyanoptila cyanomelana inter-
media which he calls the Siberian Blue Flycatcher and Cyanoptila cyanomelana cumatilis
of West China. In this respect the two males which I have at the present are quite
markedly different. One bird has been with me for two years during which time it

completely missed two moults, but has just undergone a complete and magnificent
moult. It completely lacks the purplish-blue mantle of the bird commonly available
here, neither are the black parts so black. The whole of the upper parts are of a lighter,
greener blue that the typical Japanese bird and this must be what La Touche describes
as the Siberian race. The difference is very obvious when one can compare it with
the much more striking Japanese male which I have had in the adjoining aviary for
the past eighteen months. I should very much like to see cumatilis which is described
as having verditer blue upper-parts and no black on the breast.
I certainly agree with Mr. Boosey that this bird makes a delightful and beautiful
aviary inhabitant. Compared with some other flycatchers, I find them easy to cater
for and hardy. They do have two drawbacks. One is a tendency to gorge food and
become fat and this can occur even in a large outdoor flight where they will sit over
the food trays for the greater part of the day and stuff themselves. The other fault
is that a percentage, housed and fed identically to their fellows, get " stuck in the
moult ". This cannot be blamed on the lack of humidity in Hong Kong as anyone
who has spent a summer here will assuredly tell you ! Another fault which cannot
be exactly blamed on the bird itself is that it is liable to persecution. I have noticed
that a pugnacious bird in a mixed collection always seems to single out for its spiteful
attentions any bright blue bird. A Golden-fronted Fruitsucker and a Singing Honey-
eater I possess will make a through nuisance of themselves towards anything which
has the misfortune to be blue, be it a Blue Flycatcher of whatever species, Indigo
Bunting, or White-capped Tanager. Flowerpeckers have the same nasty predilection
for singling out blue birds to persecute, and my old male Narcissus Flycatcher, which
tends to be aggressive to most things, is doubly so if the Japanese Blue in the same
aviary alights on his singing perch.
Although I have had several female Japanese Blue Flycatchers during the past
two-and-a-half years, I have not succeeded in keeping one for longer than a few months.
Some I have disposed of to fellow aviculturists in England, but those that have stayed
here always seem to come to an untimely end.
I wonder if Mr. Boosey is correct in his supposition that the male and female
White-capped Redstart are alike in colour. It would seem strange that this should
be so when other closely related species have such striking dissimilarities. La Touche
evades the issue by simply describing the male without mentioning the female.
Smythies in his Birds of Burma makes no mention of the female plumage either, but
hints that the plumage is the same. The coloured plate illustrating this bird is marked
simply " adult," while the Blue-throat, Ruby-throat, Shama, and Magpie-Robin
illustrated on the same page are all labelled " adult male ". I should appreciate some
definite information on this subject as the species does occur in South-East China
and, although I have not yet been successful in obtaining any, I continue to brandish
illustrations at my Chinese friends and hope that one day they will produce this
bird--or better still, a pair !
I can add two local examples to the puzzling loss of, and retention of red and
orange colouring on which Mr. Boosey comments in his letter. Why is it that the
Narcissus and Tricolour Flycatchers fade almost to whiteness, while the smaller
Japanese Robin-Flycatcher ( Siphia mujimaki ) fully retains the orange-russet breast ?
Scarlet-backed and Flame-breasted Flowerpeckers retain the lovely areas of colour
that give them their popular names. In the latter respect, I am watching with interest
the ruby throats of my La Touche's Sunbirds ( Aethopyga christinae latouchii) ; one
is housed in the same flight as a male Scarlet-backed and the other with a Flame-
breasted Flowerpecker. The sunbirds drink the same nectar and eat the same pulped
fruit (in quantity, strangely) as the flowerpeckers. Alas, I fear that after this their
first moult in captivity the brilliant ruby red feathers will become a dull orange red,
while the flowerpeckers will be as vivid as ever. Certainly the sunbirds are very
insectivorous and hawk tiny flies all day long while the flowerpeckers virtually ignore
the relative abundance of this food in their heavily planted aviaries. If insects are
the answer to this problem surely the sunbirds should remain bright and vivid and the

COMMENTS ON THE GENERIC NAME OF THE SILVER-EARED MESIA
AND THE LOSS OF RED COLOUR IN THE PIN-TAILED NONPAREIL
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993593541666666" page_id="56311271"  page_num="189" year="" vol="">
It is not often that I venture to criticize statements made by experienced avi-
culturists but, despite my comparative inexperience as measured against that of Mr.
Boosey, I feel I must comment on the reference made to the Silver-eared Mesia in his
article " Some Rarities at Keston " in the July-August issue of the Avicultural
Magazine.
First, the sharing of the generic name Leiothrix. All reference to this species of bird
made in the Bombay Natural History Society Journals refer to it as Leiothrix argentauris.
Bertram E. Smythies in his book Birds of Burma does likewise and even names three
sub-species, i.e. L.a. gertrudis , vernayi, and galhana. Who is correct, the Bombay N.H.S.
and Mr. Smythies or Mr. Boosey ? Since they are one of the species I used to specialize
in I should very much like to know.
The second point is the description given to identify the hen. Quote : " The female
is less brightly coloured than the male." This I must remark is no sure guide for the
brilliancy of the plumage is controlled by diet. The true means of identifying the sexes
is that whereas the male bird has a reddish rump, that of the female is a dull green.
Please do not think I am being supercritical but I would also like to comment on
Mr. Boosey's letter on " The Loss of Red Colour by Birds in Captivity " regarding the
passage on the seed-eating " fader ", the Pin-tailed Nonpareil. I must most emphati-
cally disagree here for specimens kept both by myself and fanciers known to me and
fed on nothing but plain, small canary seed have, if anything, intensified in colour
at each moult. I feel Mr. Boosey must be getting confused with a sub-species of the
Pin-tailed Nonpareil, of which quite a number have been imported during the past
two years, which has a dull orange breast patch in full colour and no dietary treatment
will cause it to develop the crimson breast of the generally known species.

THE USE OF ANTIBIOTICS IN THE TREATMENT OF ENTERITIS
I have just seen the correspondence in the Avicultural Magazine concerning
antibiotics in the treatment of enteritis. With respect to one avian enteritic disease,
readers might be interested in our work with streptomycin.
First, let me say that I know nothing about enteritis in small cage birds as all our
work was done with quail. However, there are three kinds of evidence that a weak
solution would not hurt finches or Budgerigars. One is that I have fed it repeatedly
to day-old Bobwhites with never any observable bad effects. We have also given it to
Budgerigars and Canaries with intestinal disorders with apparently beneficial effects.
In our work with ulcerative enteritis in Bobwhite Quail, we ran a preliminary test
with aureomycin which showed no benefits, but Chloromycetin was effective when
mixed in the feed. While it is possible that other antibiotics would be helpful in
quail enteritis, at least no other one has thus far been shown to be beneficial. The
effects of streptomycin in prevention and treatment of the disease are not short of
dramatic as several of our publications show.
Since all North American Quails, Puffed Grouse, wild Turkey, and Chukar are
susceptible to ulcerative enteritis (also known as Quail Disease), members of the
Avicultural Society handling these species might be interested in this treatment for an
important disease of captivity. Coturnix is not susceptible and neither is the Ringnecked
Pheasant, and immunity may extend to other Pheasants and Old World Gallinae.
If enough birds can be spared, perhaps of a common, prolific species, and a suitable
means discovered for manual transmission, a test of antibiotics including streptomycin
might be made for effect upon enteritis in small birds. Streptomycin Sulfate Merck
(for veterinary use) is probably available without prescription, and 3 grams of it

VERNACULAR NAMES USED BY AVICULTURISTS

I have read Dr. Parkes' indignant letter, and note that the correct name of Sialia
currucoides is Mountain Bluebird, and that it must not be called " Canadian " as its
range extends beyond Canada. So presumably the Japanese Blue Flycatcher must not
be called "Japanese " since it is also found in China and winters in Indo-China
and Malaya. I object to his suggestion that I " invented " the name Mountain
Blue Robin as " an improvement ". Actually I still have a letter from the breeder of
my pair saying : "I am so glad to know the Robins have settled down ..." and a
card from Mr. John Yealland, Curator of Birds at the London Zoo, giving me the
Latin name and referring to the species as " Mountain Bluebird or Mountain Blue
Robin ".
Dr. Parkes, having conveniently omitted to mention that I gave the bird's Latin
name, proceeds to complain about having to " mine " for information. Does he really
think he had to mine so very strenuously in order to discover the identity of a species
whose Latin name was clearly stated ? If so, may he never have a harder task ! As to
" the use of these unfamiliar names for familiar species ", I think Dr. Parkes might do
well to turn his attention to his fellow countrymen, who continue to mystify the rest of
the world by calling Melopsittacus undulatus " Parakeet " or " Keet," instead of its
official " simple and appropriate name " of Budgerigar.
Edward J. Boosey.
Brambletye,
Keston, Kent.
Dr. Kenneth C. Parkes raises an important point in his letter on the confusion
likely to be caused by the use of vernacular names of birds, for in a publication such
as the Avicultural Magazine which is read in many parts of the world, difficulty
of identification could occur unless the scientific name is also quoted.
For instance, Anas rubripes of North America, Anas sparsa of Africa, and Anas
superciliosa rogersi of Australia are all known as Black Duck in their respective countries.
The Maned Goose (Chenonetta jubata) is sometimes known in Australia as the Wood
Duck : the Sparrow Hawk of Europe is Accipiter n. nisus and that of North America is
Falco s. sparverius, known here as the American Kestrel.
When a plate and note appeared in the Avicultural Magazine during 1938,
Sialia currucoides was given the name Mountain Bluebird and when another appeared
during 1954, the bird was called the Mountain Blue Robin, but since the scientific
name was quoted in both instances, there could be no mistaking the identity of the
species.
Apart from being more cumbersome, the name North American White-headed
Eagle is, I submit, preferable to Bald Eagle. The bird is Haliaeetus leucocephalus after
all, and it is not bald, but has the head covered with white feathers.
Recently there were birds offered here as Butterfly Buntings. The only difference
between them and the Painted or Nonpareil Bunting was the price. A friend of
mine sent for a pair and received two males. His request for the scientific name was
not answered.

In the Magazine for September-October, p. 148, I am credited with having reared
three broods of Mountain Bluebirds. Unfortunately, I must correct this statement,
which should have read " three broods hatched " as, in fact, only one young bird was

successfully reared this year. This was no fault of the parent birds, all of which
brooded well, nor can I blame the weather, bad as it has been !
The trouble was due to the complete failure of the mealworm supply just at the
time when this form of live food was essential, as I have found that this species are
fed for the first week almost exclusively on broken up insects and are too frail to
digest whole gentles until they are about a week old. Mealworms are easily " killed "
and broken or squeezed out like a tube of toothpaste by the parents, but however
much they beat a gentle on the perch, the skin does not break. At three to four days
the young were thrown out of the nests and on examination every one was found to
be choked by whole gentles wedged in the gullet.
These losses might have been avoided had I been able to obtain adequate supplies of
small green caterpillars or even live ant cocoons, but from past experience they
would have required 2,000-3,000 of the former each day, and I doubt if the parents
would have accepted ant cocoons as they appear to refuse anything which does not
move for feeding young.
The Red-winged Blackbirds are altogether more hardy and robust, and the brood
was successfully reared on gentles alone.
It may be of interest to record that this species is far less insectivorous when once
independent of their parents and soon begin to consume large quantities of seed.
In fact, without access to a good seed mixture they are very inclined to die off
during the period of the " baby " moult.

THE SUCCULENT MAGGOT
When in India I had no trouble in getting large quantities of small, clean maggots
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.995719689655172" page_id="56311273"  page_num="191" year="" vol="">
of the house-fly. I used to put bran in a large clay chatti or water jar, well moisten
the bran with water, and put the chatti in an outhouse, and in seven or eight days,
when I put my hand in the bran was fermenting and hot and swarming with nice
clean maggots. When I came to England I found matters not so easy. The idea of
old fat hens or sheep's heads hanging in the attic or buried in the garden did not attract
me. An old Indian friend told me in his youth he used to bury bullocks' liver in the
compost heap. I found this effective but expensive ; then, quite by chance, as great
discoveries come, I found how to produce small, clean maggots in quantity.
We have a much beloved Yorkshire terrier named Susan, and as she was partly
responsible for this discovery I think her name should go on record. Now Susan is
particular about her food and she has horseflesh fit for human consumption at 2s. 6 d
a pound. This is cooked for her, her apportioned share is cut up into small pieces and
is put into a small flat enamel pie dish, and some broken dog biscuit called " Saval "
No. 2 is mixed with the meat, and some gravy from the cooked meat poured over this
delicious concoction. Susan often daintily picks out and eats the meat and leaves the
soaked biscuit and, when I am at hand, I put the dish away to keep off the flies which
are readily attracted by the delightful aroma. Sometimes the flies get there before me
and I view with disgust the flies' eggs scattered over this nourishing and delicious
food and I throw it away on the compost heap. One momentous day, however, the
fly-infected food was not thrown away but by chance I found the dish in a cupboard.
I looked at it, saw some movement, and moving the biscuit aside with a spoon I
found on the bottom of the dish a large number of small clean maggots evidently
feeding on the gravy-soaked biscuit. I gave these maggots to a cock Cuthroat which
ate the lot. To test this accidental production of maggots, I soaked some of this broken
dog biscuit with the meat gravy, exposed it to the flies, and then put the fly-infected
food into a cool, dark cupboard, and in about ten days the bottom of the dish was
moving with maggots. These were small, clean, without odour of any sort and, in
future I hope when I want maggots I shall get them, without the assistance of dead
hens or sheep's heads or bullocks' liver in the compost heap.

4. Fees are based on the amount of work done. The basic fee for a single post-
mortem examination is 10$., but bacteriological and other laboratory tests are charged
extra. Where more than one bird is sent at the same time the fee is not necessarily as
much as iol per bird.
5. No body or skin of any bird will be returned under any circumstances whatever.
