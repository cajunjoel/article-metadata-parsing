By Derek Washington (East Grin stead, Sussex, England)
In 1971 Miss Betty Locker Lampson successfully reared two young
:om a pair of Long-tailed Duck Clangula hyemalis in her waterfowl
ollection at Copthorne, Sussex.
The parents were obtained as young birds from Mike Kitching in
966. He had reared six that year from imported eggs. They were
*ansported from his collection at Louth when they were ten weeks
Id. It was a very hot day, and the birds were carried in a cardboard box
n a train crowded with holidaymakers from Skegness. However, they
semed unaffected by the journey and arrived safely in Sussex.
For two days they were kept in a pen at one corner of the lake. This
/as a fenced enclosure about 20 yards across, and included a small part
f the lake. The duck appeared to be very fit and active, and so were
eleased on the lake to join the rest of the collection, an act performed
/ith some trepidation by their owner. She need not have worried
aough, for the birds have thrived ever since. The male in particular
; an impressive bird. Not only does he have a series o f striking plumages
/hich change according to the time of year, but his lively nasal call is
lost dramatic. An observer with eyes closed might be excused for
ay-dreaming of far away places when hearing these notes together with
le " hooing " of Eiders also in the collection. Both male and female
ave become quite tame and will swim within a yard or so for pieces of
ish and other tit-bits.
For the majority of their life these have been the only Long-tails in the
ollection. In 1967 one male was raised from imported eggs (obtainable
ntil 1969 at a cost of about #1.50 each). This bird died nearly two
ears later, but during this period no interaction was ever observed
etween it and the pair.
I first became acquainted with the collection in 1968, and to start with
had some difficulty in distinguishing the one-year old male from the
wo-year female. In May however I noted that the female had a pale
tripe above the eye, whereas on the younger male this was more of a
ale patch. In August I noticed a variation of iris colour between the
hree birds, the younger male and the female both being a darker brown
nan the older male. Photographs taken in March 1969 show the older
lale in a plumage which he has attained each winter since. His head

was pure white except for sharply defined black cheek patches. He had
some long pointed white feathers spread over the black of his back, and
his long black tail was fully developed. The younger male differed in
having a short tail, smudgy cheek patches and mottled brown and black
back. The female was similar but more brown than black with smallei
cheek patches and brown on top of the head as well.
During May 1968 the older male was seen chasing his female, ofter
underwater. This male was quite vociferous at the time, but by earlj
June his calls became less frequent. In the first few days of May 196c
the pair were seen mating, but nothing came of it. We thus had higf
hopes for the 1970 season. However, the drake became so pre-occupiec
with a lone female Red-breasted Merganser, Mergus senator , that h&amp;lt;
completely ignored his own mate. To prevent this happening again th&amp;lt;
Merganser was removed from the lake before the 1971 season.
During 1971 some display was noticed, particularly in the first fev
days of June. Typically the male swims round the female with eiec
tail and neck, and bows the head whilst uttering his call. One day th&amp;lt;
pair were seen some way from the water, which was unusual. The]
appeared furtive after the manner of many breeding wateifowl ii
captivity (and possibly in the wild too). Two days later a scrape wa
discovered under some tall bamboos, several feet from the base of .
silver birch tree. This was an extremely dry site, well drained, wit]
plenty of dead bamboo leaves on the ground and a lot of cover overhead
The nest was slightly raised up on bamboo leaves.
The site was visited only infrequently to avoid disturbing the birde
Nothing happened for two weeks, but on 24th June one egg was found i:
the scrape, well covered with bamboo leaves. Subsequent eggs wer
laid on 26th, 27th, 29th June and 1st July five in all. The duck the:
started to sit, lining the nest with down.
When the rest of the collection were fed, twice a day, the duck cam
off to teed leaving her eggs well covered with down and bamboo leave:
She always had a good bathe after the afternoon feed.
One egg was removed from the nest on 27th June and a second 0
1 st July. These were put under a broody bantam and the duck w#
left to incubate 3 eggs herself. She sat very well throughout. Thj
drake appeared to take no interest after the first egg had been laid, an
was hardly ever near her even when she came off to feed. Durin
incubation the nest area was roped off to remind us and the occasion
visitor to keep well clear. Previously we had frequently used a pat
close to the nest to reach the far corner of the lake.
The two eggs under the bantam hatched on 27th July. The nest w;
then examined and contained two bad eggs and one chipping. When tl
nest was examined again, next day, this egg was missing. It wj
subsequently found some distance away with the duckling dead insid
It had presumably been carried there by either a Grey Squirrel or

doorhen, both of which were abundant (the latter especially have often
een seen raiding nests and entering nest barrels). Other active
redators were Jays, Magpies and Carrion Crows, but in our experience
aese seem to concentrate on more open sites. The duck had by then
eserted the site and was on the lake, seeming very disconsolate.
After hatching, one of the two chicks was smaller than the other and
as remained so ever since. They were transferred with the bantam
*om their sitting box to an enclosure in a concrete floored shed. The
nclosure measured 7 ft. x 5 ft. and was made from plastic netting on a
ght wooden framework. The concrete floor was painted with a green
lbberised paint to present a soft washable surface. An open-fronted
3 op was placed in the enclosure so that the hen could come out if she
lose. A 250 watt Philips infra-red lamp (a type with internal reflector
id red glass) was suspended two feet above the floor in front of the coop.
. foam plastic mat (from Woolworths) was put under the lamp, and a
&amp;gt;lded hessian sack laid on a board under the coop. The sack and the
lat were changed daily.
A shallow pool with a sloping side was built into the floor of the
lclosure, and fresh water was flowed through this daily. A flat tray
so contained water, about \ in. deep. In this was floated duckweed,
id numerous insect larvae, water fleas etc. gathered from local pools,
&amp;apos;his tray was also placed under the lamp.
The lamp was left running all day, but was turned off at night and the
irds were shut in the coop. At about mid-day, when the sun was
ghest, the lamp was raised an inch or two until it was about 4 feet above
le ground after two weeks. It was then turned off permanently.
No artificial food was given for 36 hours. Then a little hard boiled
yolk and some Turkey starter crumbs were sprinkled on the mat and
1 to the backs of the ducklings. The food was always given dry, and
lything uneaten was thrown away before the next feed. After the second
ly a few mealworms were pinched in half and thrown on to the mat and
the shallow water dish. These proved very popular; once the chicks
ere a week or so old the mealworms were given whole.
The birds remained in this enclosure for three weeks. They were then
ansferred to an outdoor pen approximately 12 ft. x 12 ft. in size. The
ire-netting walls were rendered opague at ground level by corrugated
)n panels and the like. The floor of the pen was grass and it contained
coop for shelter. There was also a pool about 3 ft. across by 15 ins. deep
d for a few hours daily by water pumped from a well. The incoming
iter was allowed to splash into the pool by feeding it to the top of some
me slabs piled at one side so that some of them overhang the surface,
bis splashing seemed to stimulate the ducklings to bathe, thus
couraging waterproofing at an early age. There was also a grass
vered hummock on which they liked to sit and several boards were
id on the ground as resting places.

The features considered important in rearing Long-tailed Duck to this
stage are warmth, feeding and seclusion in that order. It is finally!
necessary to ensure the birds are waterproof before transferring them to a
pond or lake. These birds (both males) remained in the outdoor penj
toaether for 5 weeks, by this time the larger duckling had become;
completely waterproof. He was taken to a deep pool upstream of the
main lake where he will remain all winter, whilst the other will remair
in the outdoor pen until it too is waterproof. The birds were fed or
growers pellets mixed with soaked puppy meal during this peroid
Chopped up Sprats were placed in a dish of water, and mealworms]
duckweed and grit were also given.
Long-tailed Duck are among the most difficult of the sea duck to rear
and great patience is needed with them. However the results can bj
very rewarding.
It is believed that this may be the first record of Long-tailed Duel
reared anywhere from captive laid eggs.

BREEDING THE MOLUCCAN
(Cacatua moluccensis)
COCKATOO

The original birds were purchased in February 1967, on the day the
arrived in*London from Hongkong. Both birds were very steady ar
although the cock did not welcome close approach he did not show sigij
of extreme resentment. The hen would readily accept tit-bits from rr
hand and I am of the opinion that she had been a pet bird prior to import
tion. She never seemed satisfied with her diet and always appeared
be searching for something which the seed mixture did not contain, ai
scattered the contents of the food pots with sideways flicks of her bea
She got very thin and, despite veterinary attention, died in June 196
She was the only bird which was positively identifiable as a hen in ti
consignment of six which the dealer received.
The cock was put in an outside aviary in June and another bird pc
chased during the same month. Although freshly imported, it was
enraged at being caged that it was transferred to the outside aviary ti
days after purchase. It immediately flew on to the perch and snuggl
up to the cock; both birds quite clearly enjoyed each other's presen.
The new arrival was truly a magnificent specimen possessed of a sava
splendour the like of which I have rarely seen. It also turned out to ha
a truly magnificent voice the like of which I have never heard. In Ap

)68 he--it was another cock--was transferred to a friend's aviary about
/e miles away, barely out of earshot.
Within a few days a replacement was found and this bird was quite
rviously a hen. She had been caged in a pet shop for some months
id was tame enough to offer her head for scratching. She was put
itside with the cock in mid-May 1968. She immediately snuggled up
&amp;lt; him and within seconds--when they were unaware of being observed--
mutual preening session commenced. This hen likes to exercise her
lice fairly frequently in the very early mornings and again in the evenings
it usually its intensity and duration are tolerable. When the noise
cceeds the allotted time it is put to an immediate stop by a device which
controlled from the house. The cock has never uttered a sound save
hen on a few occasions the hen put slightly too much beak pressure on
le of his toes.
The aviary is 15 ft. x 5 x 6 ft. high and is constructed of wood
rotected by metal strips. It is double-wired with 2 in. x 2 in. heavy
luge chain link on the inside and 1 in. x in. welded mesh on the
itside. The latter is primarily intended to keep sparrows out. The
lor is grass which is kept cut. The shelter is open-fronted and is
ft. long. This aviary is not one of a series of flights but stands on its
vn and the Moluccans cannot see the occupants of the other aviaries,
wo food pots are used, one containing sunflower seed and the other a
lixture of roughly 50% canary seed, the balance being made up in equal
roportions of white millet, paddy rice, buckwheat, hemp, wheat, oats,
&amp;apos;oats and maize. A few drops of Abidec multivitamin solution are put
l the drinking water once weekly if remembered and spinach beet,
andelion, apple and carrot are also provided. Cuttlefish bone is largely
not wholly wasted; I have never known them to sample the contents of
le grit pot and this has been removed--probably a mistake to do so.
A nest-box was provided in May 1968, soon after the acquisition of the
sn. It was hung high in the shelter, under cover but in line with the
Ige. No interest was displayed in the box.
In mid-January 1969, the hen was seen crouching and edging up to
le cock which merely made him move further along the perch until he
cached the wire when he stepped over her back only to be edged back to
le other side. Finally, he stepped on her back and made a half-hearted
Tempt at pairing, all the time looking coy and indignant at being
iveigled into performing an act in the flight which in the interests of
lodesty and decorum should be performed in the privacy of the shelter,
he was a good and persistent solicitor; his modesty and decorum have
&amp;gt;ng since vanished. Later that month, the hen was seen in the next-
ox, a visit which necessitated some fortification. More rotten wood
as placed in the box in May, much of which was promptly ejected,
airing was observed again in June and was frequently observed from

then on until October, always in the early morning. Much the same
ritual was observed during 1970.
The dimensions of the nest-box are 20 in. x 15 in. x 10 in. with a 5 in.I
diameter hole the top of which is 7 in. from the top of the box. Although
made to a specification suggested by a renowned aviculturist, I always
considered the hole to be too low bearing in mind the overall dimensions
of the box. Consequently, the box--which was taken down for the
winter months--was reversed, a fresh hole being put nearer to the top
and the original hole which was now in the back was blocked up. This;
afforded the birds a greater degree of privacy which was probably the;
main factor which induced them to go to nest. The box is covered both:
inside and outside with welded mesh; the edges and the entrance hole are-
protected with aluminium strips. It was re-hung in exactly the same 1
position in March 1971.
Pairing was observed in April and both birds were spending a lot oJ
time in the box. Sometimes the cock spent the whole day in the box
and slept there at night also. Some rotten wood was ejected. By early
May both birds were spending most of the day in the box; the cod
usually roosted in the shelter at night having emerged from the box at 01
after dusk. The birds never left the box unattended--one always remainec
inside. This pattern continued throughout May; the birds were rarel)
seen and when one or the other emerged it was for a quick visit to th&amp;lt;
food tray. The hen was rather threatening if the aviary was approachec
during one of her short periods out of the box. I might add that whils&amp;apos;
she was fairly tame when purchased, her tameness disappeared immedi-
ately on release in the aviary.
The sound of young was first heard on 8th June. Soaked sunflowe:
and soaked oats were offered, neither was touched nor was hard-boilet
egg. Peanuts were always fed sparingly or not at all but a fistful was nov
given each day and they disappeared rapidly. Plenty of carrot anc
spinach beet were given each day and these also disappeared rapidly
The birds continued to spend all day in the box. On 24th July a littli
maintenance became necessary in the aviary and the opportunity wa
taken to inspect the box. One chick was seen but as both adult bird
were inside the chick was partly hidden. Earlier, on the same day, botl
adult birds were seen out of the box together for the first time sine
incubation commenced.
On 26th July both birds were out of the box at 6 p.m. and anothe
inspection was made. Although within 4 ft. of me, they made no attemp
to attack but showed slightly more displeasure than usual when I entere&amp;lt;
the aviary. Only one chick was in the box, also showing his displeasurj
by swaying gently from side to side with beak open. Still in the pin
feather stage, the salmon colour of the crest was visible. The mos
striking thing about the young bird was its enormous legs and feet whic)
seemed out of proportion to its body.

At about this time--late July--the hen recommenced to herald the
awn, something we all had missed since incubation commenced. Both
irds were frequently seen in the flight together in the early mornings.
*n 7th and nth August, the box was again inspected and this revealed a
sry well-grown chick which gave a very loud shout when I put my hand
&amp;gt;0 close to it. Again, the parent birds made no attempt to attack.
On Sunday, 29th August, carrot fed earlier in the day was hardly
&amp;gt;uched at 5 p.m. Both birds were in the shelter and the box was again
ispected. The chick was well developed and fat; it has a very fine crest
id well-grown flights, the tail was very short--not more than ijin.;
was dead, 82 days after we first knew of its arrival. It was removed
om the box and--very surprisingly--both adult birds roosted in the box
tat night; the box was taken down on the following day.
Owing to the August Bank Holiday, it was not possible to despatch
te chick for post-mortem until Tuesday and although the package was
snt by express post to Wickham Laboratories it was not possible for
lem to reach a conclusion owing to the advanced state of decomposition.
The birds were again observed pairing on 8th September; perhaps
ieir efforts and mine will be more successful in 1972.

I was interested to note in the current issue of the A.M. that Raymond
ranklin had bred the Malabar Starling Sturnus malabaricus.
I would like to record that I bred one youngster in 1971. I purchased
le cock bird at least ten years ago, and the hen not long afterwards,
hey went through that very hard winter of 1962/63, in an aviary with
1 outdoor flight 12 ft. x 6 ft. and with a heated indoor flight attached
tto which they could go when cold, together with a lot of other softbills
iat made up my collection. In August 1969, I moved to a house
aving plenty of ground and I built an aviary with the flight 25 ft. x 8 ft.
7 ft. having a house attached 12 ft. x 8 ft. half of this being a wire
ight. The house is heated by tubular heaters controlled by Thermostat
ept at 45*-5o* F.
The Malabars are housed with my rather large collection of Softbills

Vented Bulbul, Rosy Pastor, Coppersmith Barbet, d'Arnaud's Barbet,
and a Pair of Gold Fronted Fruit-suckers. As the above collection
mainly consists of cock birds my interest in them is for their beauty in a
garden Aviary, although I have bred for two years some Zosterops.
Last May I hollowed a log of poplar, the finished box being 16 ins.
deep by about 7 ins. inside diameter with an entrance hole z\ ins. in
size. This I hung up at the far end of the flight which is heavily planted.
All the years that I have had the Malabars they have never shown any
interest in one another, and I was always in doubt if I did have a true I
pair, although the one was of much brighter colour than the other, as I
was'his vocal ability, he being a good mimic-imitating a cat, Jackdaw, I
and a lovely Wolf Whistle.
I did not observe any mating display or any nesting material being
carried to the nest by either bird, but one day in early June I saw the hen
come out of the log nest. This prompted me to unscrew the box off the
framework of the flight and as the top was firmly nailed on I had to look
inside with the aid of a small mirror. I could see two blue eggs in the
bottom of the box. The nest consisted of green leaves, small twigs and
grass, not much of a nest for a Starling. When these eggs were laid I
have no idea and as my habit is to shut my birds in every night, both&amp;gt;
Summer and Winter, I cannot imagine how these two eggs ever hatched;
for each evening as I went to the aviary she would go in with all the other
birds and the eggs would be left uncovered each night.
Not ever seeing the cock bird take any interest in the hen or the nest
box I thought the hen was just going through the motions of nesting and
that the eggs could not be fertile. However one day in late June I saw the
hen taking a beakful of mealworms into the box, so I had a look inside
and saw one young one that would be about two days old. The next
day I looked and there were two young. After this inspection I left
them alone for two weeks. Then on looking again I could only see one
large young one with eyes open and well feathered, and no sign of the
other one. j
The remaining young one grew well and left the nest on 27th July
After I found that there were young in the nest I would shut all the birds
in at night including the hen then open the shutter a few inches and the
hen would come out and go into the nest box and brood the young on&amp;lt;
for the night. The hen did all the feeding, the cock bird never once
going near the nest box. The young bird left the nest in good weathe:
and the hen still continued to feed him for quite a long while until hi
could feed himself. She reared him on mealworms, maggots, softfood
and any insects that could be found in the aviary. I disposed of him 11
October last. I regret that I cannot give any dates or more details as ti
this breeding but it was carried out in such a haphazard manner.

BUNTING AT CHESTER ZOO
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.939146902439025" page_id="58078017"  page_num="9" year="" vol="">
{Emberiza aureola)
By William H. Timmis, Curator of Birds and Mammals
The Yellow-Breasted Bunting is a very strikingly coloured bird. In
te adult male the forehead, ear-coverts, cheeks, surround of the eye
id throat are black; the rest of the crown and entire upper parts are
irk chestnut, with a narrow chestnut band across the breast, dividing
te bright yellow crop from the yellow breast and underparts. The
ings are dark brown with two broad white bands, and the whole of the
sser coverts and tips of the greater coverts are white. The tail is dark
rown with a white wedge on the outermost feathers; this is noticeable
nly in flight.
The female is plain yellow above, without any band across the breast;
hite wing-bars are present, as in the male; the outer tail feathers show
h amount of white during flight, the white wedge being concealed when
le tail is closed. Unlike so many of the Buntings which are on the
ritish list, the Yellow-Breasted has no white or yellow face stripes.
This interesting Bunting has a vast breeding range which extends
\0x25A0om northern Finland, where I understand it is comparatively scarce,
istwards through Russia and Siberia to the Kirghiz Steppes, east through
orth-west Mongolia and on to northern Japan. It winters in south-
astern Asia, Burma, Assam, Nepal, Northern Thailand, the Malay
tates and China, extending on to Formosa. As a vagrant it has occurred
i many European countries, reaching the Atlantic in France, Heligoland,
[olland and the British Isles. Two sub-species are recognised, the
&amp;apos;.astern or Ussuri White-Shouldered Bunting {Emberiza aureola ornata)
eing darker above and richer below.
Four pairs of Yellow-Breasted Buntings were purchased from a local
ealer on the 5th July 1971 and after two weeks' acclimatisation were
berated in our large Tropical House. This house is 240 feet long,
00 feet wide and 40 feet high and it contains fountains, waterfalls and
ools, and is very heavily planted with tropical vegetation. Plants
1 elude Banana and Palm Trees, Pineapples, Pomegranates, Lemons, a
irge collection of Hibiscus, over 200 varieties of Crotons, Clerodendrons,
Jougainvilleas, Passifloras, Gardenias, tree ferns and tropical climbers
1 profusion.
About one week later I noticed that one pair had established a territory,
tie boundaries of which could be defined by the location of song perches,
loundaries were defended by aggressive behaviour which ranged from
oft warning calls to furious attacks. Perches used for territorial
dvertising included Colocasia antiquorum , Cyperus alternafolius
(anthosoma volaceum , all of which are around a large pool; also used

were a very tall Dracaena lindemi End a small Dracaena kezvensis , both of
these being some distance away.
The only conflict noted was on 3rd August when a male tried to settle
in the occupied territory and after a great deal of aggression by both the
male and female the intruder finally left, leaving the original pair in
full possession. With other species that came into the area, such as
Hummingbirds, Laughing Thrushes, Magpie Starlings and Yellow-
shouldered Whydahs to name but a few, the Yellow-Breasted Bunting
was not particularly aggressive in defence of its territory. Only when
another bird came near to the nest did the pair show marked belligerence.
The male, or the female, or both together, would rush the intruder and
drive it away. There was a tendency for the male to advertise territory
while the female attacked the trespasser. The male tended to be
concerned with the entire territory while the female was concerned with
the nest proper. In most territorial disputes, aggressive displays often
were effective without physical contact. The territory was abandoned
after the last fledgling had been safely hidden at a considerable distance
from the nest.
The nest was built at ground level among a dense clump of Asparagus
spengerii with clusters of leaves concealing it from above, although it:
could be seen from the side and below. It was very close to a large pool
and a pathway used by visitors, and was little more than a scantily lined
hollow. Materials used included dead grasses, a few small leaves withj
finer grasses and a little hair which had been collected in our Mountain
Gorilla enclosure. Both male and female appeared to take part in nest
building, and the male, from my observations, took the initiative and did
most of the work for the first three days, then the female took over and&amp;apos;
completed the nest. The male accompanied her when she went after
materials and upon returning he sat on his advertising perch while the
hen worked below. It would seem that the male selects the site for the
nest and that the female, after much exploring both alone and accompanied
by the male, finally settles on the site originally selected by him.
On the 12th August one egg was observed in the nest. This was 2
broad oval shape with a great deal of gloss, greyish-green in colour,;
blotched and smeared with olive-brown, with some underlying light
grey and some spots and short lines of deep brown or black. The egg
measured 20.51 x 15.01 mm.
I was away from the zoo for about three days after the first egg hac
been laid and upon my return found four eggs in the nest and the mal&amp;lt;
sitting. The following day a fifth egg appeared and for the next 13 day;
I only saw the female incubating. On two occasions the female usee
injury-feigns when she was disturbed, running off along the groune
dragging both wings before flying up into the highest vegetation to watcl
the intruder.

Three eggs hatched after an incubation period of 13 days from the
lying of the fifth egg. It is now generally agreed that the incubation
eriod should be considered the time from the laying of the last egg to
he hatching of the last young when all eggs in the clutch hatch. Both
exes brooded and fed the young, chiefly on insects which had to be
ollected by the keepers. These included beetles, caterpillars, moths,
over-flies, craneflies, maggots, small earth-worms and locust hoppers
/hich are bred in the zoo, plus mealworms. From what I could observe,
small amount of regurgitated seed was fed. When feeding the young
he pair, in turn, poked from one gaping throat to the other in a fast and
egular rhythm. The nearer a chick was to a parent, the more feedings it
eceived. Faecal sacs were eaten by both parents during the first few
.ays but later were carried considerable distances and dropped.
The young left the nest after fifteen days and looked very much like
ie adult female, but paler feathered. The parents continued to feed
he three young for about two weeks, after which they appeared to lose
11 interest. At this stage the young were able to feed themselves. At
ae time of writing, 7th November 1971, one of the chicks has vanished
ut the remaining two can be seen at the feeding bays early in the
lornings and late afternoons.
As described above the Yellow-Breasted Bunting has been bred at
Chester Zoo. It is believed this may be a first success. Any member
r reader knowing of a previous breeding of this species in Great Britain
ir Northern Ireland is requested to communicate at once with the Hon.
ecretary.

THE BREEDING OF JERDON'S STARLING
(Sturnus burmanicus)
By Raymond Franklin (Chesham, Buckinghamshire, England)
Jerdon's Starlings range through central Burma. From Smythie in his
Birds of Burma " it is described as follows: " Length 10 in, head and
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.9914088" page_id="58078019"  page_num="11" year="" vol="">
*reast dirty white, upper parts dark grey, underparts purplish. The
lumage varies greatly with the seasons but the red tipped bill is usually
oticeable. The Jerdon's Starling is a typical dry zone bird of scrub
ingle country." I would say that my birds measure up to this description
ut the red tipped bill is absent.
I purchased a presumed pair of Jerdon's Starlings from a High Wycombe
.ealer in November, 1969. During the following winter they were
oused in my birdroom with other Starlings, in a 12 ft. flight. At the
nd of Maich, 1970 they were put outside into a flight 15 ft. x 6 ft. x 6 ft.
lanted with bamboo etc.; with a small pond for bathing and drinking.

On the 24th April I hung a log nest box high up at one end of the flight,
the log being a branch of black poplar rotten in the centre and leaving a
hole about 4 in. in diameter.
About a fortnight later the cock bird was seen carrying green grass and
dead leaves into the log. The hen did not seem to do any of the work
but occasionally peered into the log to see how things were progressing.
The only display I ever saw was a peculiar bobbing of the head in the
male and a spreading of the tail feathers for a few seconds followed by a
gurgling sound whereat the hen would rush up to him and put her beak to
his. On the 31st May as I had not seen the hen for a day or so I took a
torch and looked into the log. On seeing two fine pale blue eggs I noted
the date and waited for what I hoped would be a hatching. On the 21st
June what appeared to be three smashed and partially eaten eggs were seen
on the flight floor about 12 ft. from the log. I can only presume the
cock bird had brought the eggs out. I cannot say if they were fertile.
The birds seemed to lose interest after that, so during the first week of
July I took the old nest out of the log to see if they would start again.
Within a few days they started to stuff the log with more grass and dead
leaves again. They subsequently abandoned the effort; so that was the
end of attempts at breeding for 1970. At no time was copulation
observed.
To start the 1971 season--on the 3rd April I hung a larger hollow log
of poplar in the flight. Not much interest seemed to be shown but on
the 24th April I found two broken eggs in the flight. I suspect they
must have been carried out by the cock as they were not broken very
much. During the second week of May the hen was in the log for long
periods from which I surmized that she must have eggs. I was wrong.
She remained in the log on and off until the 8th June when I decided it
was time to take a look, as I thought that by now there should be young.
On turning out the mass of grass and feathers etc. there were no eggs, so
what had been happening I do not know.
After this I thought perhaps a change of house might do the trick so 1
replaced the log with a large parakeet nest box 30 inches long by 9 in. x
9 in., hung up almost horizontally, but slightly tilted so that the nest end
was a little lower than the entrance hole. The cock showed immediat(
interest by loud calls and repeatedly popping his head in and out of th&amp;lt;
hole. During the following fortnight he built what might be called i
nest but it was really only an untidy mess consisting of green grass, a fev
feathers and a few dead leaves. I would imagine the green grass provide;
heat and humidity. This time I saw very little display by the cock, bu
the hen was in the box on and off during the day. On the 25th June .
decided to take a look and I was pleased to find one pale blue egg of usua
starling size. Incidentally I frequently enter my flights and my bird
get used to me and do not panic unduly.

On the 12th July I heard faint squeaks from the box and the parents
vere agitatedly looking for extra food, so from then on I kept out of the
light for fear of disturbing them. Extra food was supplied of course,
he usual mealworms and maggots being supplemented with insects
jrought home from expeditions into the countryside with a large net. I
consider live food absolutely essential for at no time did I see the parents
eed any soft food at all to the young.
On the morning of the 31st July three young came out and flapped
eebly around. They were duller editions of the parents but one feature
noticed was that the inside of the mouth was a lemon yellow in colour
Lgainst the black mouth of the parents, (presumably to attract the parents
0 feed them). Unfortunately, one died on the first day, and one
ippeared to have rickets and after a week or so I decided to kill it. With
ess to feed the remaining baby progressed well. After a fortnight I
00k the young bird away as the cock was becoming aggressive towards
t. The young bird was beginning to feed itself so I decided it would be
afe.
On the 16th August the cock was seen adding new material to the old
test. I looked in the box again and found two eggs on the 18th August.
The weather was rather hot that week so I sprayed both the aviary and
he nest box with the garden hose.
On the 29th August I again heard squeaking from the box so it was
jack again to supplying insects and extras. After three weeks of hot
veather the young bird (it was only one this time) was just beginning to
jeep out of the hole and was continually being called to come out by the
&amp;gt;arents; but as it seemed very reluctant to put in an appearance and the
)ld nest was becoming rather unwholesome I decided to take the baby out
if the box on the 19th September. This time there was one baby and
,n addled egg. The baby perched well but was rather a weak flyer.
This time the cock was rather aggressive and I considered moving him
&amp;gt;ut decided against this as it might upset the sequence of feeding, etc.
The hen was doing all the feeding now and I had to stand by the food
lish until she had taken sufficient for her and the baby before allowing
he cock to feed. He became extremely agitated at this. On the 8th
)ctober I removed the baby as it seemed to be feeding itself, and also
&amp;gt;ecause of the cock's bad temper.
I now have two fine young Jerdon's Starlings which are coming along
juke nicely to date (mid-November 1971). To sum up, I think my
nain difficulty was, of course, supplying food, as I am at work all day;
&amp;gt;ut at midday my wife would put a quantity of mealworms and maggots
n the flight. I attribute this successful breeding to quite considerable
mounts of live flies, caterpillars and similar creatures, which I was able
o obtain with the use of a large entomologist's sweep net, and, of course,
0 the long warm days of this particular summer.

By S. B. Kendall (Chertsey, Surrey, England).
For some time I have restricted my small collection essentially to
five species, Roseate ( Elophus roseicapillus) and Citron-crested Cockatoos
(Cacatua citrinocristata ), Swainson's lorikeets ( Trichoglossus heamatodus
moluccanus ) Dwarf Turtle doves (Streptopelia tranquebarica) and Swinhoe s
pheasants ( Lophura swinhoei ), all of which have bred with fair success
for a number of years.
Of the Roseates, the old pair hatched and reared four after the initial
loss of a clutch of eggs, probably as the result of the intrusion of a grey
squirrel. The hen of the second pair laid six or seven eggs at intervals
in the shelter and showed no disposition to sit. Miraculously I was able
to foster five unbroken eggs with other cockatoos but none appeared to
be fertile.
Of three pairs of Citron-crests. One hatched and reared two young,
a second (including a cock that first bred here in 1955) reared one (I
believe there were originally two). The third pair comprised my
foundation hen (she also first bred for me in 1955) and one of her sons
(hatched in 1957). For the last two seasons she had laid but had been
attacked by the cock and been separated without incubating. This year
I was abroad at the critical time and she was found dead, probably
murdered. I happened to have a home-bred hen of the Timor race of
the Lesser Sulphur-crest ( Cacatua parvula) so paired her in April with
the young widower. They promptly went to nest and reared two beautiful
young which seem indistinguishable from one of the Lesser Sulphur-crest
races. They are bigger than the Timor, with long elegant sulphur
yellow crests. After the young emerged all four remained in the breeding
aviary in apparent amity until, due to the appearance of a predator in the
garden, I had to shut them into the small shelter. On the third night
the cock slew his second wife. The young were not of course self-
supporting but to my relief and amazement the father proved a model
I
parent and they continued to thrive.
Close confinement of a breeding pair of cockatoos can be dangerous
(I lost a hen Leadbeater's one December after shutting the pair inside
when cleaning the aviary) but it is certainly not always so and I regularly
have some pairs in large cages during the winter.
The Swainson's lorikeets comprise two separated pairs, and a colony
of six to ten birds, depending on disposals. The separated pairs breed
regularly throughout the year. The colony has produced a few young.
Whether the comparative lack of success is because more than one pair
is present or whether there are other reasons I am not sure.
My Dwarf Turtledoves (a very delightful species) have become reduced
in numbers and by 1970 I had only one hen about which I could feel

)timistic. Importation seems curiously erratic but in 1970 some
rived and were advertised as the Burmese race, which I understood
be darker and more richly coloured than the Indian which I believed
ine to be. I bought a pair and was interested to note that although
e cock didn't seem very different from those in my stock the hen was
lite dark (brown rather than grey). Twelve months and many rains
-er I am undecided whether I have a pale cock or an ancient hen. I
Duld not have believed it was possible to be confused about the sexes in
is species, the marked difference being one of its admirable character-
&amp;apos;s. However the imported cock justified the transaction and by the
d of next season (dare I say it?) my stock should be safe again.
I let the Swinhoe's pheasants incubate and rear on their own and they
ove excellent parents. Since one is under no compulsion with this
ecies to produce as many as possible, bantams can be excluded, as a
nsequence some of the diseases, particularly histomoniasis, which are
mmon to chickens and pheasants, can be avoided.
This has been a successful year for me, the main reason being, I am
re, that I do limit the number of birds and in particular the number of
ecies I keep. Self discipline in regard to new acquisitions can be very
rd at times but even with the very limited number of birds I keep I
:en have more than enough to do.

NOTES ON SOME AFRICAN STARLINGS
By P. Brown (The Bird Garden, Harewood, Leeds, England)
I was adding up the other day all the species of starling I have kept over
&amp;apos; past few years and came to the very surprising total of 23 species in
. All these I have kept either here at the Harewood Bird Garden or

lilst I was with W. R. Partridge at Evesham.
I thought perhaps readers might be interested in my briefly running
ough the African section of the list with a few comments on each
I will start with the one perhaps most aviculturalists are familiar with
i this is the Spreo Starling, Spreo superbus. Coming from East
rica, a very friendly confiding bird in the wild, a habit it retains well in
itivity. I have kept and bred this bird on a few occasions, most
ently this year at Harewood. I started with a group of nine birds in
: aviary, but over a period of eight or nine months several birds had to

laracter for whilst the Amethyst are shy and flighty, the Sharpe's has
very placid nature, never flying around in the agitated manner of many
eshly imported birds. When I received them the first thing I noticed
as the short broad beak, rather like a swallow's, this suggesting they are
uvkers of flying insects or very frugivorous. They certainly can
;molish a nice ripe pear. In size they are similar to Amethyst, quite a
nail Starling. The entire upper parts are black with a slight deep
uish iridescence whilst the under parts from the bill to vent are slightly
iffish white. The sexes are identical in colour but two of my birds
ive a bright yellow iris, whilst the other two have dark eyes. Whether
is difference is sexual or a sign of immaturity in the darker ones, we
nail have to wait and see.
Fischer's Starling, Spreo fischeri. I came across these by accident as
e dealer who imported them had no idea what they were and liked them
r en less. I must admit they are not a particularly exciting bird but
do consider them quite neat and attractive. Basically they are grey
&amp;gt;ove and from the chest downwards pure white. The head is lighter
ey than the wings and back. My birds remain fit and well but have
nown no interest, as yet, in going to nest. They are a little larger than
oreo Starlings, being more elongated in shape.
Glossy Starlings. Africa is the home of a good many species of Glossy
:arlings, and several are so very much alike that identification is a problem,
)t only in the field but also when the birds arrive in this country in
ptivity. Some years ago we received a pair of Glossy Starlings from
ist Africa and it was some time before they were eventually identified
r certain as Lesser Blue-Eared Glossy Starlings ,Lamprocoliuschloropterus.
hey were quite immaculate when received and like all this family
ayed in perfect condition with no effort but showed no interest in
jsting. They were quite slight birds, much slimmer in build than the
tmmonly imported Purple Glossy Starling, L. purpureus, being an over
l iridescent green with definite blue cheeks and ears.
The only West African species of this group I have kept are the common
irple Glossy Starling which I persevered with for three years before
ving them up. I had a group which always stayed together in the
r iary but, although in superb condition, they displayed no interest at
l in the boxes I provided.
The Wattled Starling, Creatophora carunculata , in many ways perhaps
e most interesting Starling, is for over half the year one of the most
dourless drab birds it is possible to imagine being an over all mouse

which will fill the top of a tree. Locusts form the bulk of their diet and
one of their habits is to follow locust swarms stopping to breed only
when the locusts breed. It would be interesting to find out how the
Wattled Starling fares now that the locusts are so much controlled by
man. I succeeded in breeding and rearing one youngster this year (1971),
having tried since 1963 with the same pair. (This must be some kind
of a record).
The African Starling group holds for me some strange fascination
and I have at the moment only scratched the surface. There is the
gorgeous Royal Starling, the beautiful burnished Splendid Glossy
Starling, a whole range of Red Winged Starlings, the unusual W hite- j
Crowned Starling, the slender long-tailed Ashy Starling of Tanzania oi
the delightful little Emerald Starling from West Africa and a good man)
more. None of these have I yet kept, all I would most certainly like to
Apart from their beauty these birds have many points to recommenc
them to aviculturalists. They are quite tough, being relatively easy t(
acclimatize and keep. Their food requirements present no difficulties
and as far as I am concerned, perhaps most important of all, they arij
amongst the most breedable of all soft-billed birds.

By R. A. Harper (for Peter Lowe, Curator. Newquay Zoo, Cornwal
England)
The parent birds represented in this breeding were two four year olj
Macaws; the cock being the Red and Yellow, Ara macao, the hen th
Green Winged (or Red and Blue) Macaw, A. chloroptera.
The birds first became friendly at the pets corner at Newquay Zcj
where several Macaws are kept with clipped wings and allowed to wand&amp;lt;
over a large area during the day, being taken indoors for the night. Til
cock is a completely tame specimen; the hen not tame enough to hand
but used to human company.
During the late spring of this year (1971), the two birds were seen \
be indulging in much mutual preening and feeding and were then presume|
to be a pair; however no nest box was provided for them and the nearlj
trees offered nothing in the way of nest sites so it seemed unlikely that tJ
pair could ever begin to breed.
After some weeks the birds discovered a cement cave at the rear of
run intended for rabbits and guinea pigs the entrance to which is
ground level. The Macaws soon ousted the rodents from this cave ai

:om then on this became their headquarters. A layer of peat was
laced on the floor of the cave and in this the birds dug a shallow nest
:rape. Surrounding the run is a fence and on the top rail of this the
vo Macaws spent much time, mating was observed on this rail several
mes.
An egg was laid on the 30th May and a second on the 3rd June. On
7th June the eggs were inspected and it was found that both were fertile,
ne had a chick dead in the shell, the other was hatching but the chick
ied shortly after emerging.
The pair were seen mating on the 29th June and the hen went to nest
gain three weeks later this time laying three eggs all of which hatched
t day intervals on the 14th, 15th and 16th of August.
One of the chicks was found dead and mutilated after two days, the
ther two appeared to be prospering and being fed by the parents. It
3on became obvious however that one chick was rapidly outgrowing the
ther and two weeks after hatching the smaller of the remaining two
kicks was found dead from causes which seemed to denote starvation,
&amp;apos;he remaining chick continued to prosper and whilst unfeathered it was
instantly under the protection of the parents; once the chick was
iathered however the parents spent long hours away from the nest. It
interesting to note in passing that both parents spent the night in the
ive although there are no perches and the cock must have slept on the
oor beside the brooding hen.
After one hundred and three days the young Macaw left the nest and
imbed onto the rail for the first time.
During the incubation period the adult Macaws were very aggressive
&amp;gt;wards human intruders and in particular towards people that they
new such as their keeper; the nest was inspected at infrequent intervals,
&amp;gt;r the most part the birds were left to their own devices and undisturbed.
The Macaws at Newquay receive a wide variety of foods including an
&amp;gt;sortment of fruit, nuts, sponge cake soaked in honey, minced raw meat
id a seed mixture containing sunflower, peanuts, canary seed and millet.
&amp;gt;uring the period that the breeding pair were feeding young they consumed
rge quantities of the honey soaked sponge cake and also took more meat
tan normal.
In nearly every detail the young bird resembles its father the Red and
ellow, it has however the body colour of the Red and Blue being a
Lther dark crimson; it also has the tail colour of the Red and Blue and the
nes of small feathers crossing the bare face patch. The yellow on the
ing coverts is perhaps a little greener than in those carried by most
ed and Yellows. Without the comparison of the parents one would
.ke the young Macaw for a Red and Yellow apart from the face lines.
The bird is the same size as its parents but of course has the grey eye of
young bird. The plumage is excellent with no signs of ' stress ' in any
P the flight feathers or in the tail.

On the third day out of the nest a sudden fright caused the young

around the Zoo calling to its parents who screamed in encouragement
Like most Parrots it did not take kindly to flying down, preferring t(

By R. McCluskey (Bedford, England)
This year, 1971, I have bred Grey Wagtails, Motacilla cinerea , witl
small fish as the staple diet. They were in a series of interconnectinj
aviaries around a bird-room, the aviaries being 6 feet wide and varyinj
through 11 6 ft. ins., 7 ft. 6 ins., 5 ft., and 3 ft. 3 ins. in length. The;
shared these aviaries with a pair each of Pied Wagtails Motacilla alba
Chaffinches Fringilla coelebs , Greenfinches Carduelis chloris , Ree&amp;lt;
Buntings Emberiza schoeniclus , Blackbirds Turdus merula , and Redwing
Turdus musicus. Instead of shutting the birds in particular aviaries
gave them the run of all during the winter and allowed them to choos
the one they wished to breed in, on the grounds that I could always shu
them off in it later if necessary.
The aviary which the wagtails chose was the largest. It had in it
small pond 2 ft. x 1 ft. and 4 ins. deep, which was fed with a constan
drip of fresh water from a series of six galvanised trays situated one t
each aviary, connected up with polythene tubing and gravity fed from on
to the next. It also had at one end of the aviary a small cotswold ston
wall almost hidden by nettles and tall grass in which the wagtails nestec
A hollow log was hung near the top of the aviary in a further corner fror
the nettle bed, with an elderberry bush occupying another.
The birds were fed on my own mixture of softfood, together wit.
maggots, mealworms and a few stick insects. Haith's "Robin Red
colour food was added to the softfood, and fed to maggots and mealworms
This preserved the yellow on wagtails but tended to give this an orang
tint. I found in the past that my softbills have lost colour if they ar
not given colour food in their diet.
In March I began to experiment by giving the birds small fish take
from the local river which flows at the foot of my garden. As far as

now these were mostly minnows, but a few sticklebacks were also
night and also, I think, the fry of some larger fish. They were all
Dout minnow size.
The Grey Wagtails were feeding on the fish. Both had black bibs and
thought I had two males but the one with the less black bib turned out
&amp;gt; be a female. I never knew they were nesting until I saw the female
ith a bill full of fish disappear into a clump of nettles. On checking I
iund a nest made of grass, rootlets, moss and horsehair, containing four
licks about three days old and also one clear egg. The nest was situated
1 the small stone wall, almost hidden by nettles and tall grass.
The young were close-ringed at approximately eight days old; and left
ie nest on 18th June. I never at any time saw the parents feed the
)ung on anything except minnows, although there was always a supply
&amp;apos; maggots and softfood available. My nightly walks along the river
ink armed with a two foot diameter net and bucket were not enough;
ith the Grey Wagtails emptying the large dish of water that I put in,
&amp;gt;ntaining not only minnows but water boatmen, dragonfly nymphs and a
&amp;gt;st of other aquatic insects that I couldn't identify. I also had to go
ihing early in the morning before work, then again at lunch time, and
so make two journeys in the evening. During my fishing expeditions
fell into the river on several occasions, much to the amusement and
sgust of my wife and family, my wife saying that it was about time we
rdie men grew up!
By now all the other birds sharing the aviaries were eating fish also,
he Reed Buntings nesting in the hollow log in the same aviary and
ired two young, while the Greenfinches reared three young in a nest in
e elderberry bush. Apart from occasional bill-snapping between the
ed and Grey Wagtails there was no trouble between the various species
On the first day of leaving the nest all four young wagtails ran about
2 aviary floor. The next day the largest of the youngsters was seen
fly a distance of three feet onto a branch of the elderberry bush. That
*ht all the youngsters roosted in the lower branches of the elderberry,
ter this they roosted higher up on perches scattered around the aviary,
tey were all flying well at about 15 days old.
They continued to flourish and at 17 days old I first noticed one of them
hing and taking fish out of the bowl. The others were not seen taking
h. for themselves for another week and in the meantime they were all
11 being fed, but by the male only. I had hoped that the female might
ve gone down to nest again, but she never did. Maybe its just as well,
I was having my work cut out looking after the one nest as it was. My
xt problem was persuading them to eat other food as they would only
fresh small fish etc. and my only solution was to catch them up and
t them into a large stock cage. On examining them I found that the
ly defect was that one had a back claw missing. I slowly weaned them
-r to maggots, mealworms, an occasional moth, and softfood. It was

minnows were gone.
All my birds still get minnows nearly every day, although not as mam
as they would like. The species eating minnows in my aviaries are a

In 1971 at Leckford we had the misfortune to get a family of stoal
into the main waterfowl enclosure. This was particularly serious as tb
whole place is enclosed in half-inch wire-netting topped by a rat guan
The first animal we caught was the old female who might have know
where she got in, but it took us about two months to catch the entii
family--eight in all--in that time they had of course killed a number &amp;lt;
birds, but though we poisoned all the corpses we found we only kille
some rats which were not the culprits; stoats unfortunately prefer the
meat warm.
We had pairs of White-winged Wood Duck and Hartlaub and brc
the latter. Literature on these species generally describe their soci
life as similar to the Muscovies.
In our experience the Hartlaub are very definitely monogamous wii
a very strong bond between the pair. In behaviour they are similar
the African Black Duck, Anas sparsa , they like cover, and are ve
intolerant of their own species when breeding. The female here wou
have killed a second female I tried to introduce if her mate had shov
any hesitation. Here the duck has always nested on the groun
generally in rank sedge and grass, once in a box on the ground placed i
a little side stream amongst rank plants. The incubation is 30 da]
The White-winged Wood Duck we had only for one season. T.
pair were very tame almost feeding from the hand when one filled th&amp;lt;
dishes in the morning, and, at the same time, secretive. They spent
lot of time resting under a low bridge which takes a road over thi
enclosure, but were active as soon as evening started. They called a 1
to each other, the female's voice is very similar to the buzzing voice of t
male New Zealand Shelduck and the male's a weak falsetto edition

They mated regularly and after mating displayed noisily to each
her throwing out their chests rather as do displaying Ruddy-headed
eese and showing off their pale blue-grey and white shoulders and wing
itches. They shared a pen with a pair of Radjah Shelduck and a trio
' Hottentot which they ignored.
As I was very intrigued to find out how close to the Muscovies they
ally are I acquired a female domestic Muscovy, a black bird with a
*eckled neck. They utterly ignored her though the poor Muscovy when
fing constantly solicited the male's attention.
There were four boxes in the enclosure, a Mandarin-size box for the
idjahs, a super-size Mandarin-type box for the White-wings, a large ground
&amp;gt;x and a little one for the Hottentots. The Muscovy demonstrated the
ct that the " hole is greater than the part ", and by some extraordinary
it laid two clutches in the Mandarin box, the Hottentots went up the
ider to the huge box and nested in one corner inside, the White-wings
ok over the big ground box and made a scrape. The drake often went
to the box rather as do the male Mandarin or the Ring Teal when
eir mates are house hunting. Actually the males of most waterfowl
lp choose the nest site except perhaps for the Muscovies and Comb
ucks.
We reared about 30 Black Swans from three pairs, our birds always
ir two broods, one in the Spring and one in the Autumn, only about
Black-neck as one of the females developed a throat infection in the
&amp;gt;ring and did not breed. We reared six Coscorobas--the most
lightful friendly youngsters and a good number of Ruddyheaded,
by-headed, Abyssinian, Ross, Cackling and Lesser White-fronted
iese. Red-Breasted were a disaster; 27 eggs from three females with
ly two fertile, one egg in each clutch from the same goose, the two
slings are both males.
\fye have a trio of African Pochard from which we have reared a few
nually. But in October 1970 they started laying and laid clutch after
itch right through the winter including 14 at Christmas time. We did
t set any of their eggs until February, finally we let the ducks sit in
ly to stop them. We reared over 70, when the ducklings started
thering their parents turned on them and the ducks started laying
tin in September. To stop them we caught them up and put them in
lolding pen with a lot of young birds and at last they have given up.
3 reared broods of all the Shelduck, about 60 Ring Teal, 36 Puna and
&amp;gt;st other more usual species.
Homosexual behaviour is common in waterfowl, particularly amongst
^ brown Shelduck even when the sexes are about equal, young males,
often seem attracted to each other and get " paired " before the young
nales are interested in anyone. If this catches the eye of any field
uralist in South Africa or Australia, I should be very interested to
ow whether it occurs in the wild.

J. DELACOUR--THE 1 97 1 SEASON AT CLERES
We have never had this happen amongst young European Shelduck
but in 1969 we kept back five pairs of young New Guinea Radjahs for
future stock, the five males were brothers and the five females sisters sr
from our point of view, it did not matter how they paired, or we though
it did not! As they do not breed until two years old, we left them all
plus a spare duck together in a large pen, four of the drakes pairet
homosexually and when put in their breeding pens simply stood on ti]^
toe and yelled to their boy-friends in other pens. The net result wa|
that only one of these young pairs bred. After a bit of moving friends tj
opposite ends of our establishment we have now got everyone properl
paired and hope to breed Radjahs in 1972 as freely as we bred Africa) 1
Pochard in 1971! As a commercially run concern we do try to estimat
the sort of numbers of each species we rear each year; we try, but th
birds have the final say.

It was an unusually dry and sunny summer in North-western Franc
which was favourable for bird raising. The spring, however, had
succession of warm and cold spells which caused a lot of clear eggs an
even a few species did not nest at all. As usual, there were some vei
good, as well as disappointing results. We had 27 young Emus fro)
two pairs, but only a few, late-hatched Rheas. Our Cassowaries no
adult, fight savagely and had to be separated. Surprisingly no cram
laid, nor did our old Screamers, but we now have two newly import*
pairs. Two pairs of Trumpeter Swans, now four and three years of
have not yet shown any sign of breeding condition. One pair of Blaci
necked Swans reared early five and later four young, while two oth
pairs produced infertile eggs only.
A pair of Nenes first laid early in March, and two young were rear&amp;lt;
under a bantam; the parents later reared four more. There were
Emperors and a few Giant Canadas, Cackling, Barnacle Blue and Sno
Chinese, Lesser White-fronted Geese, but no nests of Ross s or Re
breasted were found. Our Black Brants were unsuccessful. We ke
the last three years offspring, over twenty birds, and they proved mu
less colonial in their nesting habits than we expected; they fought bitter
three birds being killed, and even the parent pair failed to breed. Th
will have to be separated or moved into the larger park. There were al
five Ashy-headed and 10 Cereopsis as well as a number of Paradise a
South African Shelducks and six Moluccan Radjahs. The old fenr
Australian Radjah, over twenty-five years old, died after laying tj
clutches of clear eggs; we now possess only one pair of that subspeci
probably the last one in captivity.

We had been very successful last year with maned Geese, but in 1971,
ily one clutch of five was found and the young reared. There were
any young ducks, the best being Puna, Sharp-winged and Ringed Teal,
ustralian White-eyes are very prolific; a number of them are reared on
e lake and remain well full-winged.
Game-bird breeding was made difficult by the rebuilding of a twenty-
mpartments pheasantry. A number of Peafowl, including 6 Green,
;acock-Pheasants, Junglefowl and others could however be raised.
ie Brush-Turkeys in the park produced no young, as they usually do.

which Dr. P. Ciarpaglini will report in some detail.

They seem to have little true homing instinct. If they stray more thai
a mile away they are lost and have to be fetched back. On one occasioi
two years ago, five Blue and Yellows disappeared one afternoon. To m
surprise, these included the old breeding pair which had three young i:
the nest. They did not return and that night we had to bring the thre
babies indoors and keep them warm with a hot water bottle as they ha
not started to grow their feathers. All five birds were retrieved next da]
but they had split up and were widely scattered round the district.
This sudden dispersal is hard to explain unless they had been scare
away by the appearance of some bird of prey. They dislike the silhouetl
of a heron and, strangely, those of seagulls. Small hawks, like Kestre
and Sparrow Hawks, don't seem to worry them. They are fairly easy t
recapture as they are trained to fly to the rattle of the food tin and quick!
come down when hungry.
Only once have we actually lost any for good. That was a pair of Re
and Blues which took to feeding off the country. It was a particular]
fruitful Autumn with plenty of beechmast and berries about, and the
refused to come back to their aviary at feeding time. They stayed aboi
the grounds for several weeks and eventually disappeared. Normal
such conspicuous birds are quickly seen and reported to us.
Leadbeater's Cockatoos bred two nice young ones, as did the Roseate
The Umbrellas hatched a young one but let it die when quite youn
Derbyans reared two young which is about their usual quota. In son
years they have raised three. This year, for some extraordinary reaso
after they had fledged, the old cock and one of the young ones qui
suddenly bit off their wing and tail feathers, rendering themselv
flightless. The old hen, who can be a bit of a shrew at times, w
suspected of bullying them, so was removed to an adjoining aviary, b
it will take a moult before they can fly again.
All this happened within a day or so. The more I see of parrots t
more I become convinced that featherplucking (or biting) has nothing
do with diet but is a form of nervous frustration.
We have had a pair of Eclectus for many years. The hen is imprint
on human beings and will not allow the cock to mate with h
Consequently, her eggs are always infertile. Every year after his mo
the cock remains in perfect feather for about six months. Then in a mat
of days he strips off all the outer edges of his breast feathers leaving t
grey underflue.
If one stops at their aviary to pass the time of day, the hen invarial
comes up to talk. The cock's fury then knows no bounds. He lo;
his temper and lunges at the hen as well as the human visitor. He
obviously a very frustrated parrot and bites his feathers like a ch
biting its nails.
We have a Moluccan Cockatoo which has been with us for nine yes

gathers including the primaries and secondaries. What is worse, it
oes this to other cockatoos under the pretence of mutual preening until
le other is reduced to the same dilapidated condition. Yet we have five
ther Moluccans all in perfect feather receiving exactly the same diet
nd treatment.
It has not been a particularly good breeding year for parrakeets. Five
airs of Ringnecks produced seven young (two pairs didn't breed at all).
,ast year the same five pairs produced fifteen young ones. Six pairs of
losellas produced only fourteen young between them, (eighteen in 1970).
hree pairs of Stanleys raised four, (in 1970 there were twelve). Crimson-
dngs had four clear eggs. Pennant's did nothing.
Our colony of Peach faced Lovebirds have bred better than ever
efore, having reared sixteen young to fledging with young still in the
est at the time of writing (November). The species is generally reckoned
ot to be a good colony breeder but this group numbering seventeen
idividuals has been built up over the years from six originals without
Iding outsiders. Maybe this is the reason why they don't fight.
Waterfowl
The four Red-breasted Geese purchased several years ago have all
irned out males. Females seem to be at a premium.
We kept last year's three young Bar-headed Geese full-winged merely
ather clipping them for their first year. Now they have moulted out
id are flying well. We have tried full-winged Barnacles without success,
urs is not the best goose country. Too many tall trees, especially
ound the ponds, makes it difficult for geese to land--not so, however,
*r the perching ducks, especially Mandarins and Carolinas.
We now have a large flock of these mostly full-winged. Carolinas
e much better stayers than Mandarins, which have gradually dwindled
rer a period of years and need constantly replenishing with handreared
rds.
Competition between the species may have a bearing on this. We
arted with a preponderance of Mandarins but as the Carolinas have
creased in numbers so have the Mandarins decreased. We put up
rge numbers of barrels in the trees for them but these are nearly always
cupied by Carolinas. In fact our problem is to distinguish between
eir eggs. Mandarin eggs tend to be larger so we only set the larger ones
it it is surprising how many produce Carolina ducklings.
Nevertheless it is a great joy to see and hear them in the spring
rching like pigeons in the trees as they look for nesting sites.
There is a little pond in front of the bungalow where we live and every
ening I " seed " it with wheat to attract the ducks near the house. At
eakfast time it is quite common to count as many as ten or a dozen
irolinas and Mandarins on the water displaying to one another.
This summer a Carolina duck brought up a brood of eight ducklings

on this little pond. Normally the ducks try to take their broods down to
the big pool but they have to run the gauntlet of storks, pelicans and ,
wild herons, not to mention magpies and crows, so they seldom survive.
This time, however, the duck had the good sense to bring her family on
to the little pond and we hastily put a low wire fence right round it so
that they were confined to a safe area.

Pheasants

<bodyText confidence="0.998848135135135" page_id="58078038"  page_num="28" year="" vol="">
Twelve nice young Peacock-Pheasants ( bicalcaratum ,) were reared.
We must have bred and sold over sixty of these during the past seven or
eight years, mainly from the original pair. I wonder where they havei
all gone because I hardly ever hear of any and do not know of any
breeding reports.
Apart from the Peacock-Pheasants and Himalayan Monals, we don't
go in for rarities here, preferring the commoner species which cannot be
surpassed in beauty. After much trial and error we have found Goldens,
Reeves's and Blue Crossoptilons to be the best stayers at liberty, and
reasonably compatible. All these are gregarious except in the spring
when some do stray. But for the rest of the year they provide a feast of
grace and colour which are a never-ending source of delight.
Just now in the Autumn they look at their best. The Goldens in
particular perform a ritual display in which up to a dozen cocks take
part, running round each other in circles.
When this is performed in the half shade of the woods with sunlight
dappling through the branches the effect of brilliance is quite bewitching.
This display seems to have nothing to do with mating as hens are, more
often than not, absent.
Although so closely related to Amherst's it is curious how the twc
species differ in temperament. |
The Golden is a sociable bird and, except in the spring when cocks
are establishing territories, they seldom fight seriously. Amhersts or
the contrary are solitary by nature and aggressive at all times. We hav&amp;lt;
tried keeping the two species at liberty together without success. Eacl
Amherst cock demands several acres of territory and woe betide trespassers
We have one beautiful specimen on free range at present. It ii
astonishing how he covers the ground giving the impression of being ii
two places at once. Many is the time I have been convinced that then
is more than one bird around. The Amherst's display is no socia
affair like that of the Golden, but an aggressive warning to keep off.
Considering that Reeves's are about the best fliers among the ornamenta.
pheasants, they are excellent stayers. They are also not as aggressiv
either among themselves or towards other species as is generally stated
On the contrary they will quite deliberately break up fights among othe
pheasants, shouldering their way in between the combatants, for all th
world like policemen stopping a street fight.

This was particularly noticeable when we kept Silver Pheasants which
*re always picking quarrels with the peafowl.
We don't keep Silvers any more because they were such murderers
en at liberty. They were very handsome but a party of them would
stematically hunt other pheasants through the woods till they either
ove them away or, if they dared to square up to them, dug a spur into
eir heads.
I then thought of trying Swinhoe's in their place. Here again the
(Terence in character between two closely related species is remarkable,
tie Silver is gregarious and moves around in a loose flock. The
vinhoe's is solitary. The Silver is as tame and confiding as a domestic
icken. The Swinhoe's remains wild and shy. Unfortunately the
ecies has the same bloodthirsty habits.
Blue Crossoptilons get a bit barbary in the spring but generally mind
sir own business. They are good liberty birds as they hardly ever fly
d seem to prefer the vicinity of houses.
Other Birds
Our little colony of Cape Penguins continues to be self-supporting,
e started with eight birds in April 1962 and now (November 1971)
sre are thirteen. During this time four adult birds (presumably of the
iginal consignment) have died. Since they were adults when imported,
sir age was unknown. Nevertheless it is gratifying to be able to report
overall population increase.
The Sacred Ibis produced three young ones in 1971 making a total of
1 birds bred here during the past few years. In 1970 we handreared
/oung one and left him free as an experiment. He has stayed so well
it we released two more of last year's young. Now they make a
rilling sight gliding above the trees.
The Scarlet Ibis which did so well two years ago have failed to repeat
sir success. Eggs were laid in 1970 and some chicks hatched but they
:re not reared. This year they laid but did not hatch. The brilliance
their colouring varies at different times of the year. They are at their
st during the winter and spring. Then as their beaks turn dark and
sir breeding " wattles " develop the colouring on the head and neck
les to pink. At the end of the summer when moulting is imminent,
sir plumage fades all over to pink.
The Eagle-Owls did not attempt to breed this year for the first time
ce they became adult and started to lay. They have reared chicks in
; past.
We have a Lydth's Jay which must be qualifying for the old-age
asion. He has had a series of illustrious owners before coming here,
:luding Peter Paris, the late Reg. Partridge and, before that, Sidney
rter. Two years ago he had a difficult moult. He began to breathe

to shake off his complaint. He now looks as fit as a fiddle, and shares!
an aviary with a Hyacinthine Jay.
We have had four Occipital Blue Pies for a long time. They have
nested more than once in the past and have even hatched young, yeti
surprisingly, in spite of this, have always remained a compatible group.
This year one pair hatched and reared four fine young. All went well
till fledging time approached when the parents set about one of the others.
This was hastily removed. A close watch was kept on the third bird as
we expected this to be attacked but we were not quite certain which was
which of the pair. Then to my amazement I saw all three birds attend
the nest with food one after the other.
The four young duly fledged and grew into fine birds. Then tragedj
struck and two went down with gape worms. The remaining twc
started coughing but after prolonged treatment with first nilverm and
then Thiabendazole seem to be improving.
Our pair of African Casqued Hornbills raised our hopes for a tim&amp;lt;
by plastering up the entrance hole cut in the side of a barrel. As th&amp;lt;
summer waned, however, they lost interest. Perhaps we shall hav&amp;lt;
better luck next year. These Hornbills are extremely hardy. The]
scorn their shelter summer and winter and always roost outside.
We have a fairly representative collection of Touracos--White-cheeked
Pink-crested, Hartlaub's and Purple-crested. The White-cheeked ar
the hardiest and seem the most inclined to breed. One pair have neste&amp;lt;
regularly for some years. Usually they fail to sit properly but domesti
pigeons will hatch their eggs perfectly. The incubation period is th
same as that of pigeons (18 days) but the problem is how to rear th
young from such an early age. A fact which never seems to be mentione
in literature on the subject is that the young gape like young blackbirds
Also their eyes open within twenty-four hours of hatching and they ai
quite active in the nest, so obviously pigeons couldn't cope. We ha\
tried handrearing but so far without success.
Two years ago the old pair of White-cheeked did rear two youngstei
but neither survived to the first moult.
Two single wattled Cassowaries which were purchased two years ag
as half grown youngsters are now nearing maturity. Although they loc
different--one being considerably more heavily built than the other, the
are not compatible and we have never been able to run them togethr
for any length of time. One or the other eventually panics and rui
full tilt into the fence surrounding the enclosure.
They make ferocious woofing noises more like dogs than birds. 1 h&amp;lt;
have a spectacular threat display fluffing up their black hairy plumage t
they look twice their normal size, inflating their necks to show the re&amp;lt;
orange patches of skin, and stamping their feet.
For the first time in many years our Purple-Headed Glossy Starlin
failed to rear any young. We have quite a flock of home bred birds

is species but lack of room has prevented us from breeding to the next
neration.
Softbills need plenty of space to breed. In a place of this kind which
spends on public support for its maintenance, visitors expect to see
ore than one pair of birds in a large aviary which otherwise looks empty,
msequently, the birds have to share the accommodation with other
ecies. The resultant competition for nesting sites and live food means
at breeding successes are more by luck than judgement. Nevertheless
is surprising what can be achieved with careful management.
Of one thing I am certain; admission of the public does not inhibit the
rds from breeding. On the contrary it steadies them down till they
come indifferent to the presence of visitors, always provided of course
at people keep to their side of the wire-netting.

The publication of first accounts of breedings, or details of breedings

ten omit some of the more obvious information. We have listed below
e information which we would like to find in such contributions, and
&amp;gt;pe that by publishing this we will obviate the need to ask for further
-tail, and avoid delay in publication. We think contributions should
elude
The common and scientific name of the bird, the region where it
normally occurs, and enough information about its appearence to
enable the reader unfamiliar with the bird to visualise what is being
discussed.
Any information on earlier housing, including arrangements for
overwintering.
A description of the enclosure in which the birds are kept, giving
details of size; internal facilities such as perches and plants, shelter,
and temperature control if any; and other birds sharing the same
accommodation.
The food normally given to the birds, and any seasonal variation.
The nest site and nesting behaviour of the birds.
Any information on laying, hatching and fledging, with actual dates
where possible.
Food given to the young, and any special feeding behaviour, while

A remodelled and refurnished aviary in the Bird House at Regent's
Park has been completed with the addition of artificial earth banks and
a pool. The aviary has been designed primarily for bee-eaters, and the
first tennants, three Carmine Bee-eaters are now in residence.
The most important breeding events of 1971 have been the successful
rearing of five Snowy Owls, another Spectacled Owl (probably only the
third ever recorded in captivity), Black-footed and Humboldt's Penguins,
a Palawan Peacock Pheasant and four Malayan Glossy Starlings. The
number of species breeding in the Snowdon Aviary continues to increase
and this year included the Bristle-crowned Starling of East Africa whicl
has probably not been bred in captivity before. The pair of White-
cheeked Turacos in the Snowdon Aviary have been remarkably prolifie
and have produced four young from three different broods in only n
months. They built their nest some 10 ft. off the ground in a dead tre&amp;lt;
densely covered by a creeper. Both parents fed the young, mainly wit!
regurgitated fruit, dates, raisins, apples, pears, bananas, etc. The firs
youngster was still being occasionally fed by the parents three month:
after hatching. The last two young, hatched in September, were abou
three weeks old when the tree in which their nest had been built fel
during a storm. They were replaced in the nest, and the parents continuet
to feed them though by now the nest was close to the ground. It wa
decided finally to move, and hand-feed them.
There have been a number of species which have laid eggs but fo
various reasons (including regrettably vandalism) have not hatched them
Disappointments in this respect have included the Green-winged Macaw
Sarus Crane, Alpine Chough, Roulroul Partridge and Kookaburra
Fortunately, when collectable the eggs have not been wasted and hav
been used by Dr. Kennedy and Dr. Vevers for their research on she!
pigments.
One of the saddest losses in 1971 has been the death of our male Ostric!
at the age of seven years. It was particularly sad, not only because h
was a great character and had survived a long illness in the previous yeai
but also because his new young wife had produced her first eggs. Surpris
ingly the first egg was laid when she was only 18 months old, and perhap

3t surprisingly they were infertile. Now having established her sex
e hope to obtain another male for her. A death which was especially
d was the Steller's Sea Eagle. She died of old age having been in the
*flection since 1937. She was received in exchange from Moscow and
as thought to be about two years old when she arrived in London,
aking her 36 years old when she died.
Species or sub-species new to the collection have included two Curly-
ested Helmet Shrikes, three Abyssinian Ground Thrushes, two White-
dlied Blue Flycatchers, a Little Green Bee-eater, two Yellow-green
rosbeaks, a Yellow-streaked Lory, a Dusky Lory and the Congo Peafowl,
his latter species and a pair of Imperial Pheasants were deposited with
e Society by Antwerp Zoo, and we were particularly pleased and
moured to receive both these rare species. The Congo Peafowl was not
scovered until 1936 and still little is known of its biology in the wild,
he Imperial Pheasant from Central Vietnam is possibly even rarer and
likely to be on the verge of extinction. Those few in captivity all
iginate from one pair collected and described for the first time by
an Delacour in 1924.
A small group of ostriches was purchased at the beginning of the year
d later transferred to Whipsnade where they will join the White Rhino
rd. Also transferred to Whipsnade were five African hand-reared
ltures of three species. They now inhabit a large new aviary with
ittle Egrets and Sacred Ibis. P. J. Olney.

2 Blue and Yellow Macaws, 2 Red and Yellow Macaws and 2 Derbyan
Parrakeets. The Scarlet Ibis laid but failed to hatch this year. A wild
heronry seems to be establishing itself in the trees surrounding the lake.
Over the years young herons which have fallen from their nests prema-
turely and have been unable to fly have been brought to us. After
teaching them to feed themselves it has been our practice to turn them
loose down by the lake. By this time they have learnt where a living is
easy and seldom go far. Moreover, they have obviously told their wild
friends who now come in to share the pickings. This year we are pretty
sure there was a nest in the top of one of the tall conifers bordering
the lake. Now it is quite a common sight to see as many as six to
eight herons sitting around at penguin feeding time, waiting for the
sprats left over by the penguins. They also consume quantities of dead
day-old chicks put out to feed the Storks and Secretary Birds. On a
recent rough census we counted fifty Mandarin and Carolina Ducks on
the lawn, most of which are full-winged. Carolinas predominate .

Writing on the lifting of the ban on the importation of parrots our
esident stated in the Avicultural Magazine, January-February 1967,
It is up to importer and exporter alike to do everything possible to ensure
at birds are packed and transported under the best possible conditions.
)r remember, should this ban ever be reimposed it is very unlikely that it
3uld be on public health grounds, but almost certainly on humanitarian. "
ow, four years later, parrots and other birds are being imported in such
-palling conditions that it would not be surprising if an import ban were
iposed on animal health, human health or humanitarian grounds,
ost of us have a strange ambivalent attitude towards animal dealers
d we do nothing to try and improve the conditions in the frankly
sgusting trade in livestock. Veterinarian G. A. Smith writes, " I
onder just what proportion of freshly imported birds die before a
onth of their imprisoned existence is out? Annually I make a resolution
:ver to buy a bird through a dealer and I wish I could keep this pledge,
it I haven't the strength of will to resist buying a specially enticing
rd. During the past three years I have bought seven parrots from
talers. They were sent by rail, four were ill on arrival and died within
few days, two lived for a fortnight and one Red-capped Parrot for ten
seks despite the fact that its air sacs were practically solid with
pergillosis. At the time of writing (November 1971) so many parrots
om Singapore and South America are arriving with Newcastle disease,
hich kills the birds almost invariably, that I would strongly advise
lyone thinking of buying a parrot from a dealer to avoid doing so unless
rtificates of vaccination against this disease are forthcoming.

Berlin and Hamburg: Paul Parey 1971. 88 DM.
The title of this book, unless I and my German dictionary err, coulc
be translated as "An outline of bird migration "; a very modest title foi
a masterly and absorbing book. Professor Schiiz and his collaborators
Dr. Peter Berthold, Dr. Eberhard Gwinner and Dr. Hans Oelke have no
only given a comprehensive outline of the subject but have filled in mos
of the salient features with a wealth of interesting and (equally important
interestingly presented detail.
The headings of the main sections of the book are (my translation 0
attempts thereat ): (A) Bird migration--a form of animal travel; (B
Basic ideas and methods of migration study: (C) Pictures of migratioi
from different areas; (D) The migrations of some individual species
(E) Some aspects of the migration scene; (F) The migrations of som
non-European birds; (G) Eruptive migrants; (H) The influence 0
weather; (J) The physiology of bird migration; (K) Orientation; (L
The origins and significance of bird migration: and (M) Citation c
references.
I must own that migration is not a subject I have studied intensively
It is possible therefore that there may be a few " slips " as can usually b
found even in the best of books by reviewers of sufficient knowledge an
pernicketiness, but I doubt if there can be many such. The book i
written throughout in a clear, readable and interesting manner. It i
profusely illustrated with 142 pictures ranging from maps showing tb
migration routes and distributions of individual species (of which thei
are a great many) to copies of Ancient Egyptian portraits of bird-catchin
and crane-keeping. I found the sections on individual species of part
cular interest but I think few bird addicts will be able to read any chaptt
without stumbling on some intriguing or thought-provoking fact whic
they had either not known or had half-forgotten.
Exclusive of the index the book contains 375 pages. I heartily recon
mend it to all who are interested in birds and who can read Germa
whether they are especially interested in migration or not. I hope that
will soon be translated into English.

mbers on Cebu until 1929* at least. One presented to the London Zoo in 1936
s still living at the end of 1943 (1943, 161).
Thomas Brosset has kindly sent me a photostat copy of part of Rand and Rabor,
Birds of the Philippine Islands " (. Fieldiana : Zoology, vol. 35, no. 7) (i960). In
i section dealing with the birds of Siquijor Island it is suggested it may be that
fe race siquijorensis became extinct with the dwindling of the forest. As there
' no less than eleven recognized races it can be appreciated that it is a little
iicult to decide which have become extinct, especially as the Filipinos often
re specimens, especially the Central Island L. p. regulus , and carry them from
md to island.

BILL COLOUR IN GO-AWAY BIRDS; AND A ROOSTING
ASSOCIATION OF NEGRO FINCH AND PIGEON
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998449870967742" page_id="58078047"  page_num="37" year="" vol="">
Edere in Kenya I am staying with Tim and Jane Barnley, who have several
aries on their farm. Recently two things have come to my notice which I
,nk of special interest.
Firstly, in their description of the White-bellied Go-away Birds, Corythaixiodes
cogaster, in Volume 1 of "Birds of Eastern and North-eastern Africa",
ickworth-Praed and Grant state that the sexes are alike. Other books I have
lsulted mention no sex difference. However, on the slender evidence of two
rs caught not too far from here, I think there may be a difference. In both
tances one bird of the pair possessed a dark, virtually black bill and the other a
enish-yellow bill. Mackworth-Praed and Grant say that the bill is black, but
the same volume Roland Green's plate shows it yellow. I would be interested
nyone has the opportunity to check, to know if this is a sex difference. I hope
make further observations myself.
Secondly, Jane Barnley brought to my notice the fact that a solitary Grey-
wned Negro Finch, Nigrita canicapilla, in one of the aviaries roosts on the back
one of two Green Pigeons, Treron australis. The other birds in the aviary
a Golden-Rumped Tinker-Bird, Pogonhdus bilineatus, and a Blue-naped
msebird, Colius macrourus. This Negro Finch is a member of the waxbill
lily, about 5 in. long, grey and white above and black below and on the face,
eeds principally on fruit and insects.
Vlore recently a second Negro Finch has joined the other after a settling period
a few days in a cage, and I was most interested to know how it would roost,
1 managed to make observations on half-a-dozen occasions. I could not do so
its first night in the aviary, when I think it roosted alone on a branch, while the
er roosted on the back of one of the pigeons, but during the following six days
r as able to check on all but one night.
)n the first of these occasions the pigeons roosted side by side, so that they were
ching; and one Negro Finch slept sitting on the perch between then, while the
er roosted on the back of the right-hand pigeon. On the four remaining
hts on which I made observations the pigeons slept a little apart from each
er; and on three occasions one Negro Finch roosted on the back of each pigeon,

but once both roosted on the back of the right-hand pigeon, this being the on
that the single Negro Finch had usually used. Since making observations 0
roosting birds is difficult, and may frighten them, I have made no further check:

Aviculturists have always found it difficult to provide a suitable material
which species that excavate their own nest holes can burrow. In the Alay ai
October numbers of the British Trust for Ornithology News, Colin Brown h
described how he induced wild Willow Tits to breed by providing a nestbi
filled with expanded polystyrene, and subsequently had Lesser Spotted Woo
peckers breeding in a similar suitably-placed nestbox. These were typic
nestboxes, in the latter instance covered with bark, and each was filled with
block of polystyrene into which the birds excavated their normal nest-cavity,
occurred to me that this information might be of help and interest to aviculturis
faced with similar problems in providing nest-sites.

The Council is pleased to announce that the formation of a joint Avicultu
and Ornithological Reference Library has been made possible by an agreem&amp;lt;
with the Linnean Society. The arrangements are as follows:
The journals which the Avicultural Society receives from all over the world
exchange for the Avicultural Magazine, together with any books which it n
own now or in the future, will be housed in the Linnean Society Library,
Burlington House, Piccadilly, London W.i. All these works will bear our stai
and be catalogued as our property so that they may be recovered at any time. 1
Linnean Society will gather together all its own works on aviculture and ornitholc
(some 500 volumes) and place them with ours to make one joint collection
complete list of which may be obtained on request from this office.
The Avicultural Society will pay the Linnean Society a fee^of #40 per annu
for an initial trial period of one year and thereafter to be reviewed regular
in return, the Linnean Society will house and administer our library and all
our members to use the whole of the Linnean Society Library. The facilil
offered will be for reference only, as it is too costly and difficult to run a lc
scheme. If the demand made on their library staff by our members is grea
than expected, they may seek new terms, if the demand is very slight then we m
Avicultural Society Members' admission to the Linnean Society Library 3
be strictly by Reader's Ticket only, to be issued by this office at a charge of
per year (to be reviewed after the trial period). Foreign Members visiting 1
country for a shorter period than three months will be issued with a tempor
Reader's Ticket free of charge.

The Library will be open to Members from io a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday to
riday. In addition for an initial trial period, it will be open on the following
iturdays in 1972, from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 2 p.m. to 5 p.m.: 5th February,
h March, 1st April, 6th May, 3rd June, 1st July, 5th August, 2nd September,
h October, 4th November, 2nd December. The Library will be closed on the
Monday following each of these Saturdays. Saturday openings will become a
:rmanent feature if the demand proves great enough.
Burlington House is on the north side of Piccadilly, halfway between Green
irk and Piccadilly underground stations. As one enters Burlington House, the
nnean Society is on the left, under the arch.
The Linnean Society's Library is acknowledged to be one of the finest in the
Drld and Council hopes that Avicultural Society members will welcome having
cess to it. It owns many old and rare books on botany as well as the branches of
ire and applied zoology, and receives some 900 journals covering the whole
Id of biology including many of particular interest to aviculturists. The
nnean Society is keen to build up a really comprehensive set of general reference
&amp;gt;oks for indentification purposes as well as field guides, checklists, etc., and it
hoped that between us, our two Societies can make this a unique collection of
icultural and ornithological works. If any Members have suitable books
lich they could donate to the Avicultural Society, these will be most gratefully
cepted for our new Library and the gift duly recorded.
Members' suggestions and enquiries regarding this scheme, as well as applica-
&amp;gt;ns for Readers' Tickets, should be made to me. We hope that there will be
any applicants for tickets--one or two visits to this unique library and building
auld more than justify the expenditure. Hon. Secretary.

(Cyanoliseus patagonus patagonus )
By William H. Timmis (Curator of Birds and Mammals)
Conures have always been particular favourites of mine. They consist
seven genera: Aratinga, Nandayus, Leptosittaca, Pyrrhura, Cyanoliseus,
\0x25A1nuropsis and one aberrant American genus, Rhynchopsitta, and include
) species and subspecies. Their name is derived from the cuneate or
edged-shaped form of the tail--each feather decreasing in width
mmetrically toward the end and terminating in a rounded point.
The Lesser Patagonian Conure, {Cyanoliseus patagonus) (Vieillot, 1817)
*eeds in the south-central part of Argentina from southern Nanquen
erritory and southern Buenos Aires province to Chubut, migrating in
inter north to Mendoza and Buenos Aires, occasionally to Uruguay and
*parently in the mountains of Cordoba. It is some two inches smaller
an the Greater Patagonian Conure, {Cyanolisues patagonus byroni)
\0x25A0 E. Gray, 1831) which formerly inhabited central Chile from Aconcagua
Valdivia and is now confined to a few localites in the mountains of the
ntral provinces.
The basic colouring of Cyanoliseus patagonus is olive-green with a
ackish cast, darker on the upper parts, almost black on the forehead
d crown, and paler on the underparts. There is a very narrow white
nd across the upper chest which ends in white spots on the shoulders,
ae abdomen is yellowish with red flecks, with a reddish area in the
ntre; lower ends of the thighs are red. There is a very prominent
lite ring around the eye; the bill is black.
During the spring of 1967 a pair of Lesser Patagonian Conures were
Tchased from a local dealer and after a period of acclimatisation they
:re transferred to an outside aviary measuring 15 ft. x 17 ft.6 ins. x 7 ft.
lis aviary has a layer of washed river sand some 18 ins. deep on the
or. No signs of breeding were observed until late April 1970,

i not sleep in the box, many hours each day were spent inside. After
:eks passed and no eggs appeared, my optimism waned and I did not
en bother to peek for weeks at a time. Then, one day in August,
Hind the 20th if my memory serves me correctly, I happened to look
o the nest, and could see two eggs. I did not peek into the nest again,
t on 4th September an eggshell was thrown from the nest, and I could
ar the cry of a new arrival within. I managed to contain my curiositv
til 14th September when I could see two small grey balls of down
ngside the parent bird in the nest. On 25th September I went into
; nest to remove the babies for handfeeding, and was delighted to find
ee fat youngsters!
rhey responded well, indeed, to a diet of cooked wheathearts with a
le sunflower meal added. All three babies grew into fine strong birds,
ually a bit larger than their wild-caught parents. They started
\0x25BAbling at seeds when twelve weeks old, but I did not consider them
iependent until they were a full sixteen weeks old. They are now
&amp;gt;rable, gentle little birds and simply beg for attention. A very
ightful change from their very shy parents, to be sure. It may be a
of trouble to hand-feed baby parrots, but I feel that the end result of
h very tame and trusting birds is worth the extra effort, and besides
ou really love birds it is such fun\
Vhile the parent birds were feeding their babies, they ate heavily
safflower seed and sweet corn (on the cob) with, of course, the usual
flower and a few oats and millets. My Senegals seem not to like
ary seed, nor would they consume soaked sunflower and fruit which so

hungry kids. 1 he hen rarely left the nest, the male seemingly doing
st of the feeding.
would like to know of others who have raised these lovely little
rots in their aviaries. At the moment I am aware of only two other
ducing pairs in the U.S.A. I would be pleased to correspond with
one regarding breeding of these birds, and would endeavor to answer
and all questions. I have acquired several other imported Senegals,
plan to keep all that I can raise for a while, in hopes of eventually
ding up an aviary-bred strain of these beautiful and charming little

The female showed much interest in a large pile o twigs an &amp;apos;

similar to those of five eggs laid at Slimbndge by the bird s mod
(70 5 mm. x 106 mm.). Another four eggs followed on alternate d.
and on 17th May the female began her 30-day incubation. A point
interest was that only four yards away, in the adjacent pen, a pair
Trumpeter Swans were also nesting, yet no aggression was ever s.
between these four birds. ,
The female Bewick's sat very tightly and was seldom off the clut

as this, young goslings already out on the grass were getting chilled
then contracting pneumonia. With just four days to go before hate
there was serious flooding--water had already reached the Trumpet
nest--and there was little alternative but to bring the Bewick s egg
to safety. At this stage they were candled, and it was clear that &amp;apos;
one was going to hatch. Of the other four, three were addled and
was infertile. Fortunately the rain eased off a little and the fl

days left before hatching.
On 16th June a small downy white cygnet could be seen peering
from under the wing of a very proud mother. The male Bewick s
also obviously excited about the new arrival and spent much ot his
beside the nest. Then, just as everything seemed to be going well
weather took another turn for the worse. The female stayed on
nest for two days sheltering her young from the deluges of rain.

tnd water dishes were placed on the rim of the nest and from these the
'ygnet fed readily. On the third day after hatching, it was bright and
unny and for the first time the cygnet was led to the water by the mother
)ird. There was little problem in feeding the young one. It grazed
nthusiastically and adapted well to chick starter crumbs. An assortment
if pond and water weeds, such as duckweed, watercress and floatgrass
vas provided in the early stages. At seven weeks the cygnet was
&amp;gt;eginning to feather over the scapulars and by 13 weeks the last traces of
[own had gone. This bird was moved from Bentley to the Wildfowl
[rust in October 1971 where it can now be seen in the Rushy Pen
agether with other collection Bewick's and many wild ones also. On
elease (at four months old) it weighed 10 lb. 8 oz. and was sexed as a
.male. It is hoped that in a few years she will help to make up another,
luch needed, breeding pair at Slimbridge.
Also reared at Bentley in the 1971 season were another 43 species of
ucks, geese and swans. In addition, 16 species produced clear eggs. It
&amp;apos;5 hard to guess the cause of this disturbingly high infertility; it may be
ue to several factors such as incorrect pairings, interference by surplus
lales, old age, etc. Perhaps the most exciting young reared were seven
lack Brent, these being the first ever at Bentley. In all, four females

th June. An unusual feature was that the last two females were paired

It has long been my contention that the various birds considered as
1 ,f ,L Suvar-bird family ( Coerebidae) with the exception of those
^Ihreenus CoS Sy are Tanagers (Thraupidae). They have the
same general habhs and behavmur, and^them
L&quot;ed re as S Sugar:birds, actually differ from Tanagers&amp;gt; **e gen^a j
Pseudodacnis , Chlorochrysa and even Tangara only very slightly m th"
more or less longer, thinner and more curved bills, while their plumage is
nracticallvTdentical. My belief in their very close relationship as members
of the same family ( Thraupidae) has just been high y supporte y
recent production of hybrids between two species of Sugar-bird a
Tanagers, differing more from each other than a number of others, whic
&quot;DurWfit&amp;apos;several broods have been reared at the San Diego Zoc
from a pair consisting of a male Yellow winged Sugar-bird (Cyanerpa
cyaneus) and a female Mrs. Wilson's Tanager {Tangara mgrocincU
fanny) two species of fairly different shape, plumage and size,
sexes, in the Sugar-birds, are very different, the male brilliantly royal b
and black with an opalescent crown and yellow patches in the wing,
female dull olive and grey. Both sexes are alike in Mrs. Wilson s Tanager
mostly light blue and black, with a white belly. Yellow-winged Suga ji
birds have the longest bills in their group, while in Mrs. W ilson s Tanage ^
it is short and rather thick. i * j c a-v,
The hybrids are intermediate and generally resemble Sugar-birds of t
genus The males are a light blue with a white belly, the femak
resemble them but show much grey on the head an ^ nec ,&amp;apos; ,
It is interesting to note that there are many other Sugar-birds a
Tanagers in the farge planted aviary, through which visitors walk coi
tinually in the day. It is therefore not because of a lack of more a PP(TM)P r "
mates that those birds have paired up and bred together. Mr. K. C-LB
the Curator of Birds at the San Diego Zoo, wi&amp;apos;l soon publish d l
coloured photographs of these very significant hybrids. It would be
great value to have the proof of their possible fertility.

By C. J. O. Harrison (Berkhamsted, Herts, England)
To summarise the information for those who do not wish to read it in
11:- To avoid overcrowding or unduly confining birds some rules are
:eded for calculating a minimal space allowed for each pair. An
amination of the space allowed by various persons successfully
eping birds, suggests that for birds of finch size, in an indoor situation
aere space is very limited, 50+ or preferably 70+ cubic feet per pair
ould be allowed; and in outdoor aviaries 100+ to 350 cubic feet per
.ir, or more, should be allowed. The greatest dimension should be
e length.
I appreciate that discussion of this subject in this journal involves,
the majority of cases, preaching to the converted; but I think that we
ould take a lead in putting forward, and discussing, such ideas.
One of the failings of which bird-keepers tend to be guilty is that of
er-crowding birds, or of offering too little space in individual enclosures,
here are several reasons for this. Newcomers to birdkeeping are
fered the commercially available all-wire cages which are far too small,
breeding cages designed for canaries and budgerigars which can
apt themselves to extremely limited accommodation which most other
ecies will not tolerate. They may also see birds at shows in tiny show
ges and although they may know they cannot keep birds in these they
ad to assume that the birds will not need much more space at other times,
ore experienced bird keepers who have kept only canaries and budgeri-
rs and who come to keep other native species or foreign birds, appear
times unable to grasp that the requirements of these might be different,
esumably in time it might be possible with some species to produce
lerant strains like those of the domestic canary; but I doubt if our more
vilised age should tolerate the savage indifference to well-being that
is entails, and most people would prefer to try to give a bird the
nditions that it needs for its comfort.
It is difficult to discuss this subject because there are so few standards
ailable by which to measure space requirements. With most bird
ecies the problems are similar to those encountered when keeping fish,
that three dimensions of accommodation are involved. The fish-keepers
ercome their problem by adopting a rough rule-of-thumb which allows
much cubic space per inch of fish. I think we could try a similar
stem for birds, although it would be easier to use a few size categories
cher than precise units of length.
Now I am well aware that a number of other factors may be involved
successfully accommodating small birds, varying with the species
ncerned. I am also aware that although a size in cubic feet can be
yen, space may be more desirable in one direction than in the other.

C. J. O. HARRISON--THE SPACE REQUIREMENTS OF SMALL BIRDS
The greatest length is an important factor and a narrow, horizontal aviary
would be more desirable than a narrow vertical one. In spite of such con-
siderations I am convinced that we need some general figures to start with
Having calculated my own space allowances for various birds I made i
random check through publications such as the Avicultural M^agazint
and Cage and Aviary Birds, noting such measurements; and mor&amp;lt;
recently, at an A.S.P.E.B.A. A.G.M. I asked the members present tc
note down the space they allowed per pair of birds. The data that 1
have are mainly for finch-sized birds, both seed-eating and insectivorous
and for a few thrushes and small doves. The people questioned wen
concerned with keeping birds under conditions which would encourag(
them to breed.
It was interesting to discover that there was a general measure o
agreement. From the data the figures that I have given above emerged
Most people keeping birds inside birdrooms, where space was limited
would allow for finch-sized birds at least 50+ cubic feet per pair, ant
usually 70 +, although one had some success with 40 cubic feet, and thj
inevitable exception occurred. In that case Redstarts had bred in a cag&amp;lt;
8 ft. x 1 ft. 4 in. x 1 ft. 4 in. The cage length may have been relevant
I think such exceptions will continue, but I greatly doubt that they wil
lead to consistent and long-term success in either keeping or breedin;
of birds. For outside aviaries there was one at 96 cubic feet per paii
the others ranging evenly between 100 and 360 cubic feet. I think on
could take these figures and make reasonable proportional allowances fo
larger species. I do not suggest that the measurements given abov
represent the ideal situation. It is possible that they are minimal sizes
To most aviculturists the suggested space allowances quoted above ar
probably not novel, but it is of interest to compare these figures wit
those for the structures in which many birds are kept. Most commerce
bird cages have a capacity of 2--3 cubic feet; and rarely may rise to 4-
cubic feet. The various " breeding cages " offered also fall within thi
range, and none begin to approach the suggested dimensions. I thin
that these small structures have done much to discredit bird-keeping i
the eyes of outsiders. The birds they see; the birds in the shops, an
at the shows, and the wretched family Budgerigar, are in quarters s
confined that anyone who has seen a bird in its natural state, even if it
only a sparrow or a starling, is likely to feel some uneasiness.
I think it is up to us, as aviculturists, not merely to take a holier-thar
thou attitude and to say " But of course that isn't the way we keep them
but to take the more positive one of offering some elementary gener
guidance as to what we regard as the desirable minimal dimension
which (other factors being favourable) should not disappoint the hopef
novice bird-keeper, and might go some way towards meeting the objectioi
of those who believe that the sight of a bird deprived of the opportuni 1
for movement of the kind for which it was evolved is a discredit to tl
culture that permits it.

The article by Mr. Raymond Franklin on the breeding of Malabar
Starlings in the November/December issue of the Avicultural Magazine
prompts me to write about my own experiences.
I had a pair of Malabar Starlings and a pair of Pagoda Starlings and
during the course of a few years I lost one of each species.
The odd bird of each pair was flying with a mixture of birds--Pekin
Robins, weavers, whydahs, etc.--in an aviary approx. 18 ft. x 8 ft. x 6 ft.
5 in. in 1969 and in June of that year I noticed that when I put in the
asual ration of mealworms that the starlings were not eating them but
:arrying them away. A close watch revealed that they did in fact have
1 nest of three young in a nest-box larger than a finch nest-box but
similar with half of the front open. The box was in the shelter fully
6 ft. from the ground. Any movement at all brought the sitting bird off
:he nest and so I knew nothing about it till I saw the live food being
aken away.
The young survived for only about a week but the pair started again
n the same nest and laid four eggs. One egg was infertile but three
mung were fully reared on a diet of mealworms and maggots and whatever
fise the parents could find in the planted flight.
One of them had a black head like the Pagoda hen; one had a black
lead with a small white patch at the front; and the front half of the third
me's head was white with the back half black.
During the winter of 69-70 the old Pagoda hen and the black-headed
foung bird both died so that I was left with old cock Malabar and two
\0x25A0oung birds which were a cock and hen.
No breeding took place during 1970 but the old cock was always with
&amp;gt;ne of the young birds and kept chasing the other bird away from the
ood pots so in the spring of 1971 I placed the two of them in a smaller
iviary by themselves. Nest building, laying, incubating and hatching
00k place three or four times, but the young always died when about
0 leave the nest so in desperation I opened the aviary to allow the parents
0 fly outside because I thought that perhaps the live food supplied was
00 monotonous. For almost a week neither bird went outside and then
he hen came out and was never seen again. I can only suppose that
he got a fright and then could not find her way back to the aviary. The
ock bird never even attempted to feed the family who were now about
sn days old so this finished my breeding attempts.
The old Malabar cock died (how old I do not know but he certainly
)oked old) in the autumn of 1970 so that I was left with only one 1969
oungster. He is a tough healthy bird in very pink of condition and with

I am not at all keen on breeding hybrids but when " mistakes " like this
happen it is most interesting to see how the young turn out and also to
prove that they are fertile.

Trachyphonus darnaudii emini
By Bryan S. Ward (Heysham, Lancs., England)
D'Arnaud's Barbets are one of the Ground Barbets, and are slimmer and
more dainty than the better known members of this large colourful family.
There are five species of Trachyphonus , T. darnaudii being six inches
in length and the smallest of the genus.
The upperparts are brown, spotted and barred with white on the back,
wings and tail; underparts are yellow, spotted with black on the breast,
under tail coverts red. Forehead and crown black. The chin and throat
are black also, spreading down to the breast. The sexes are alike with the
male having a little more black on the crown and throat, and being slightly
larger.
We purchased a trio of T. darnaudii emini in 1970 and put them into one
of our glass fronted compartments with an odd bird of the T. darnaudii
species where they lived together amicably for several months. During
this time a number of holes were excavated in the soil, to varying
depths, always adjacent to either walls, rocks, or some solid object, but all
were ultimately abandoned or caved in.
Towards the latter end of 1971 our breeding pair objected to the other
two birds by chasing them around and generally harassing them, so we
removed them to another compartment for their own safety. The breeding
pair then continued excavating in various places, presumably looking for a
suitable site for nesting. They finally decided on one particular hole and
removed the soil to a depth of eighteen inches, they then made a nest
chamber to one side of the base of their hole. Until this was made the
birds had to back out of the hole tail first, as the nest chamber was enlarged
they managed to turn round and emerge head first.
It is difficult to ascertain the incubation period as the barbets continued
removing soil during this time, but to a lesser degree. The young birds
were first heard thirty days before they left the nest, but the parents were
not observed taking any food to them until almost a week later. There was
no apparent preference for live food as maggots and mealworms were fed
in more or less equal quantities by them. It was then noted that currants,

.ultanas and our soft food mixture were also fed in the latter two weeks,
is also were day old mice.
During the last week that the three youngsters were in the nest the
)arents again started removing soil, possibly to make more room for the
growing birds. The young birds are very similar to their parents, the only
lifference being their slightly smaller size and paler colouring.
\.s described above the d Arnaud's Barbet Trachyphonus darnaudii
mini has been bred at the Winged World. It is believed this may be a first
uccess.

Britain or Northern Ireland is requested to communicate at once with the

BREEDING AND BEHAVIOUR OF THE

Introduction
Long isolation from other lands has allowed the New Zealand native
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.984814714285714" page_id="58078071"  page_num="53" year="" vol="">
luna to develop almost entirely free from outside influence. The fauna
not remarkably rich in species, and some widespread groups are either
3 sent or but poorly represented. Nevertheless, no other country has
ich a wealth of endemic species or so many peculiar developments and
laptations.
The comparatively large number of flightless birds is resultant upon
le paucity of land mammals, for lack of competition and particularly
omunity from attack by mammals, has enabled certain birds to become
*ound foragers, which habit has led to heavier build and reduced wings.
The most remarkable flightless birds are the Kiwis, Apterygidae,
id the extinct Moas, Dinornis--two extremes in size--the former a
:tle larger than a domestic fowl and the latter up to ten feet or more in
dght. Both are related to that group of southern hemisphere flightless
*rds to which belong the modern Ostrich, Emu and Cassowary. The
esen.ee of birds of this group can be explained only by the assumption
.at New Zealand was once part of a great southern land mass.
A century of cultivation and acclimatisation has upset the balance of
imeval nature, causing immense changes in the native land fauna,
ime species have failed to survive altered conditions and others, once
*mmon, are now sadly reduced in numbers, one of the species being the

slightly smaller than the domestic hen; a tawny brownish and blackish
streaked bird with degenerate wings making it incapable of flight.
Sexing is very difficult indeed. Males tend to be heavier than females,
goo gms against 700 gms. for the female. The Weka can run with great
speed but is most inquisitive and will venture very close to human-
habitations with a stealthy gait and an enquiring demeanour In New
Zealand the breeding season is an extended one, with the peak occurring
in winter and early spring. Weka Rails are multi-brooded and pairs
have been known to nest four times in one year. Two to four eggs:
comprise the clutch, the nest being concealed in thick scrub.
The Weka that we have bred is the North Island (greyi) which has more
grey on the underparts and brown rather than reddish legs. There are
three other races which are as follows:- The Buff Weka (hector,); this
bird was found in low rainfall districts east of the main range in the South
Island. It became extinct in its old haunts but throve at Chatham Island,!
whence 16 were re-introduced in February 1962 to Arthur's Pass
National Park. _ , , r XT ,
The Weka of the western region of the South Island from Nelson tc
Fiordland (australis) has a streaked red-brown and black breast. Ir
South Westland and Fiordland it is dimorphic, the black form showing
much more black in the plumage. " Black " Wekas are not uncommor
along the Milford Track and range to the top of the Mackinnon Pass
(3,400 feet). !
Gallirallus australis from South Island, according to Mr. A. A
Prestwich, was bred at the London Zoo in 1912, two chicks hatching
of which one was reared.
The Stewart Island Weka (scotti) is slightly smaller. It also 1:
dimorphic, but the black phase is less black.
During visits to New Zealand in 1963 and 1966, I was able to observ&amp;lt;
several Wekas in the wild, and was told by an old bushman that they haw
a fascination for taking small shining objects such as spoons and th&amp;lt;
bushman complained that even watches had been taken.
The North Island Weka, once abundant everywhere, has now dis
appeared from most districts, largely due, I was told, to the depredation
of dogs, cats, stoats and weasels. In 1915, the Weka was most abundan
from Waimauku to the Muriwai Beach, west of Auckland. Their shril
calls could be heard any evening in considerable volume and female
with their chicks came fearlessly around camps, but today not a singl
bird remains. In other areas it is still a familiar bird, especially in th
vicinity of mountain huts and weekend houses. In such places, it ma
be extremely tame, even becoming a tourist attraction. I saw severs
Wekas in the Gisborn area of North Island; the birds have built up fror
very small numbers to high densities in the last fifty years, even feedin
and breeding in suburban gardens. Staff of the Wildlife Division hav
been trapping Wekas and releasing them into areas where they hav
become extinct in the hope of re-establishing them.

On the 4 th July 1971 a pair of North Island Weka Rails arrived from
2 Auckland Zoo. After a short period of quarantine and acclimatisation,
ly were liberated into a large mixed flight (106 ft. x 60 ft. x 20 ft. high)
the rear of the New Ape House, heavily planted with trees and shrubs
d two large pools. This flight contains Herons, Ibis, Egrets, Gallinules
d Waders, along with a single female Weka which has been in the
lection since April 1964. Several days after the introduction
irtship feeding was observed between the original female and the
vly arrived male. The female was seen to beg and to be fed by the

brought her food from as far as 60 feet, even though the female was not

11 circles with his head held high and his short tail widely spread and

ct her half-opened bill at him in a threatening manner. The male

Nest Building
The site of the nest was a small cave built out of sandstone measuring
ft. 2 in. x 2 ft. x 2 ft. 6 in. The nest was built in a corner of the cave

was lined with finer grasses and moss. The nest was in an ideal
isition for observation, facing a window in the New Ape House kitchen.
he Wekas could be watched without disturbing them at all, from a
stance of less than five feet.
Both male and female brought nest material and both sat on the nest
id shaped it prodding with the bill or stamping with the feet. On
le occasion the male, arriving with a new bundle of material, literally
ished the female off the nest. Towards the completion of the nest, I
&amp;gt;t the impression that the male brought most of the material, while the
male did most of the sitting and shaping. As with most birds, the nest

luently go directly to the nest and the female then often works for
unusually long time. During the later stages of nest building, the

Incubation
The first egg was laid within a few days of completion of the nest,
three eggs being laid within a period of five days. It was very difficult to
learn with any accuracy, the interval between the laying of each egg.
Incubation appeared to commence with the laying of the first egg. One
would assume that with Weka Rails being omnivorous eaters there would
be no eggs left if incubation began only when the clutch was complete.
Whether the adult birds sitting on the eggs for long periods of time
during the egg laying period means that the eggs are being subjected tc
full incubation heat, I am not sure. This obviously depends upon the
stage of development of the brood patch and how well it is formed at the

sitting would be unwilling to leave the nest, and did so only by bem|
shouldered and pushed off by its mate. .
They usually spend the time away from the nest in feeding, preemn
or occasionally in bathing. They would walk out into the shallow pat
of the pool, bowing forward and twisting their bodies so that their hea

throwing water on to the back. After a short while the wings are soakin
wet. Sometimes the bird only dips its head in and out of the water an
with a sideways movement of the head, throws water onto its bad
After bathing the Wekas usually shake themselves, fan out the win*
and shake their heads and bodies several times. They then spend
considerable time preening and drying their feathers by adopting
sunning posture; now and then there is vigorous flapping of the wing
The male often indulged in squabbles with other birds in the fligt
especially with a pair of Pond Herons who had a nest a short distan
from the Wekas' territory. The female spent more time in preening
quietly standing under the cover of shrubs, than did the male.
Swimming was observed only once, when the male swam across U
top pool. The body was held high out of the water, the head jerku;
rhythmically backwards and forwards and the short tail flicking up ai
down.
The eggs were turned by the sitting bird at varying times during t
day--1 was unable to record any observations at night. In most cases
was noted that after the eggs were turned--with the beak and legs t

incubation period was 26 days and when the eggs were about to hat.,
the bird turned them more frequently.

th male and female attacked and drove off Pond Herons, Glossy Ibis

rhe second chick hatched the following morning, almost twenty-four
irs after the first. I was able to watch the final stage of hatching
i saw the chick squirming and rotating slowly in the shell in such a

shell which was then chipped off with each outward push. With

In our large flight they hunt for insects among the long grass and low

area of the flight and after a few minutes the male found a snai and
examined it by turning it over and picking it up with his beak. Sevedl

an outcrop o S f sandstone and hit the snail on the solid surface sever*

The two chicks continued to thrive and at four weeks had lost mos

At seven weeks, they appeared almost independent; only very occasion; i

often the chick fell over backwards as the food item broke in two.
After the chicks had left the nest, two more nests were built, one

two Wattled Cranes Burger anus carunculatus ; three White-quilled Black

B. C. Sayers writes " My Barn owls have made a major contribution
this years' breeding results. The pair have reared io young in thr
nests (3, 2 and 5), the first egg of the third clutch being laid on 1
September. The same female laid a further clutch of six eggs durn
the early part of this month (December 1971). However, I removed tlj
eggs and nesting hide in the hopes that she would take a rest, but &amp;lt;
18th December I found that once again she had started to lay and w
incubating two eggs on the concrete floor of the aviary. In desperatii
I returned the nesting hide and today (20th December) she was contentec
incubating three eggs ".

white giving them the appearance of a Psittacme equivalent o e
Japanese Blue Flycatcher. This exquisite mutation is gradually being
established in some British aviaries, it is rumoured that there are a fev
specimens in Holland but, apparently, it has almost died out in Austrah,
where it originated about io years ago.
The Frankfurt Zoo was successful in 1966 in breeding the White-nec e&amp;lt;

remember as the authority on parrots, possessed a hen Salawati j

female of the Sula Island race (A. a. sulaensis) and a male Crimson-wing^
Parrakeet. According to Vane the species has been bred in captiv&amp;apos;
" once in 1940, when no observations were recorded ". Both 1 |
nominate race and the Salawati subspecies have been offered for s;J
recently and have been snapped up at enormous prices. Unfortunate,
like so many Parrots handled by dealers, some have been too disea*
ridden to survive but others appear to have been established successful
Some successful breedings might justify the removal of these majee-
creatures from their island habitat.

It is almost 25 years since a short article which I wrote on the birds of
Vew Zealand was published in the Avicultural Magazine. During the
/ear I lived in that lovely country I spent much of my spare time in
daces where the native bush had escaped destruction and where it was
*till possible to see many of the delightful species of birds like the Bell-bird
ind Tui which are found only in New Zealand. But I was very dis-
jointed by the Government's attitude to aviculturists for, at that time,
t was illegal to keep any species of New Zealand bird in captivity,
dowever, in the last decade or so the N.Z. Government, which has been
conservation conscious for a long time, has begun to recognize the part
hat aviculture may play in helping to conserve rare species. Licensing
iviculturists to keep the attractive Yellow-fronted and Red-fronted
3 arrakeets (Cyanoramphus auriceps and C. novae-zeelandiae) was a start
ind it was not long before both species were being bred in very large
lumbers in aviaries all over the country. In 1961, the Wildlife Branch
&amp;gt;f the Department of Internal Affairs established the Mount Bruce
dative Bird Reserve to provide facilities for the holding and breeding in
:aptivity of endangered species. I spent an enjoyable and interesting
lay there just over a year ago and was very impressed by the strides that
.re being made. Both the Blue Duck and the Brown Duck were breeding
veil as also was the very rare Eastern Weka. A range of aviaries had
&amp;gt;een constructed which houses pairs of uncommon passerine species
ncluding Stitch birds and Saddlebacks. The Saddleback (Creadion
arunculatus) is closely related to the probably extinct Huia and like it
las orange wattles on its cheeks. It is about the size of a Mistle Thrush.
Phe " saddle " is a patch of bright orange-red across the back and wings
vhile the rest of the plumage is glossy black. I had never before seen
iving examples of this beautiful species and I was surprised and delighted
0 learn that it was being successfully bred in the Reserve. If the Curator
5 still a member of this Society (he was at the time of my visit judging by
he prominence of a row of Avicultural Magazines on the bookshelves
a his office!) perhaps he would let us have some information on the
nteresting and important collection in his care.

Carolina I arrakeet Conuropsis carolinensis carolinensis in captivity died in the
Cincinnati Zoo in 1914: some authors have even given the date as 1st September
pparently confusing that of the death of the last Passenger Pigeon Ectopistes
ngratonus which also died in the Cincinnati Zoo. &amp;apos; * *
I n J 973 the Cincinnati Zoological Gardens celebrates its centenary and in
onnection with this event the eminent American bird artist John A. Ruthven
roposed making a painting of the Carolina Parakeet, using the last captive survivor
s a model. But where was the skin? To George Laycock fell the task of locating
. Easy enough one would have thought but, unfortunately, there are no records
f so early a date in existence at the Cincinnati Zoo. George Laycock has described
is very extensive search, in some detail, in Audubon , 1969, March, 21-25, with
olour Plate by John A. Ruthven. The account has been reproduced in South
arolina Wildlife, Summer, 1969: American Cage-Bird Magazine, 1970 December
9401197 1 , January, 29-30; February, 34-36: and in part in Foreign Birds
J 971 ' May--June, 102-108. The skm was not found but George Laycock
nearthed a very illuminating item, in the Cincinnati Times-Star, Friday, February
2nd, 1918. It is of sufficient interest to warrant reproduction in these pages:

tan mere physical structure, development and decay knows the bird died of grief
Incas , coveted by many zoological gardens, died Thursday night surrounded
f his genuinely sorrowing friends, Col. [sic] Stephan and the keepers. Late
^ summer, Lady Jane , the mate of Incas for 32 years, passed away, and after
iat the ancient survivor was a listless and mournful figure, indeed. In recent
&amp;apos; a xTJJStephan received many large offers for Incas and Ladv Jane and
e New York Zoo was especially eager to obtain the birds. After the death of the
male, various zoos renewed offers for the survivor, but Col. [sic] Stephan would

I1 &quot; age&amp;lt; J. when it: &amp;gt; wi th its mate, was obtained by the Zoo 32 years ago.
I he Carolina parrakeet family was the only real American parrot ", said Colonel
ephan, rriday. There was a time when the family was a numerous one. But
curious trait in the make-up of the family proved its undoing. The parrakeets
^uld Hy in thick flocks and, if a hunter fired into them, they would wheel and
me right back to the scene of the shooting as if curious to see what caused the
plosion and to learn why some of their number fell to the ground. So by their
olishness the Carolina parrakeets gradually were shot out of existence as a

Colonel Stephan will have the bird mounted and, in accordance with a promise
ade by him some years ago, will present the specimen to the Smithsonian
stitution.

In the September-October issue of Avicultural Magazine I invited Mr. G. A.
mith to comment further on his suggestion that there is a correlation between
:xual dimorphism and the inability to use the foot for feeding in parrots. His
cplanation in the November-December issue is both ingenious and convincing
ad 1 must both thank him and congratulate him.
On the matter of the relationship between Amazona xantholora and A. albifrons
am afraid that Mr. Smith is on shakier ground. What may or may not happen
sewhere when two or more Amazon parrots are sympatric is irrelevant to the
msidenmon of this case. Contrary to Mr. Smith's statement, A. xantholora and
. albifrons have indeed evolved differences in habitat preference in their area of
mpatry, although there is overlap. Paynter ("The ornithogeography of the
ucatan Peninsula", Peabody Mus. Nat. Hist. Yale Univ. Bull. 9, 1955: 125)
a J es: * It appears . . . that A. xantholora is more abundant in the deciduous forest
id A. albifrons in the rain forest. Although at times both species may occur in
ie same general area, I have never found them associated in a single flock (nor
d Paynter know of any other worker who had, but a mixed flock has subsequently
len reported at least once), and always one species is more abundant than the
her, depending on the nature of the habitat." This evidence certainly strongly
iggests a partial ecological separation. The occasional formation of mixed flocks
.as, Univ. Kansas Publ., Mus. Nat. Hist., 17, 1968: 591) argues for not
;ainst species status.
IVlr. Smith suggests that these two Amazons resemble such well-known cases as
u ? a T* n an , &amp;lt; l Hooded Crows Corvus c. cor one and C. c. cornix which form a
hybrid zone". This is precisely the kind of case that the Amazons do not
semble, as none of the many collectors that have worked on the Yucatan Peninsula
is ever, to my knowledge, taken an intermediate specimen. Further, both of the
ows have extensive ranges of their own, whereas the range of Amazona xantholora
almost entirely encompassed by that of A. albifrons (the exceptions being Isla
jzumel and probably the drier portions of the deciduous forest that dominates
e northern part of the peninsula). There is no doubt that the two are closely
at&amp;lt; /A-V anC * A&amp;apos; xan tholora probably is derived from a once-isolated population of
. albifrons , but they must now be considered sibling species rather than con-
eC }^ S u I a b etter comparison than the crows from the European avifauna
auld be the Red Crossbill Loxia curvirostra and the Parrot Crossbill
Pytyopsittacus. The breeding range of the latter is encompassed by that of the
rmer, there is a habitat preference but it is not complete; mixed flocks may occur
itside the breeding season but both species usually occur in pure flocks; and there
little doubt that, although now acting as a good species, the Parrot Crossbill
ust have evolved from a population of the Red Crossbill.

All members of the genus Lophornis are very beautiful, although some
&amp;gt;n perhaps, be considered a little bizarre due to their highly ornamental
athenng. It is rare indeed for any to reach Britain and the only species
have owned so far is the Frilled Coquette, L. magnified.
I purchased a male in September, 1968. At first this bird was housed
a large flight cage together with a male Wire-crested Thorntail
opelaina popelamt, and a male Raquet-tailed Coquette, Discosur 'a
ngicauda. All lived together amicably until the first moult had been
impleted, when the Thorntail although not actually becoming aggressive
d worry the Frilled somewhat by continually displaying to him!
icause of this, I decided to house the Frilled on its own and I transferred
to a cage 48 in. by 16 in. by 16 in. To allow plenty of flying space
e cage was only furnished with two perches, one at each end, and a
tall saucer (I use those taken from a coffee set for really tiny hummers)
water which was placed on a 1 lb jam jar near the centre of the cage.
1 have had this Coquette nearly 31 years at the time of writing and it is
ly during the last couple of months or so that I have seen it actually
nture far enough into the saucer of water to take a proper bath. Up
til then it had only sat on the edge and dipped its head into the water
m turned around and dipped its tail in. Because of this reluctance to
he, I have always sprayed the Coquette at least once a week, usually
lor to cleaning the cage out.
This reluctance to bathe in captivity is not common to the species, as
0 Coquettes I purchased a few months ago, took to the saucers at once
i both have taken a proper bath at least once a day since I have owned
The h rilled started its first moult in captivity during February, 1960-
s took 15 weeks to complete. As the bird was in poor feather at the
ie 0 purchase, I had allowed it to feed from a perch. As soon as it
completed the moult, however, I moved the nectar tube to the centre

moults have not taken quite so long to complete as the first and they hav,
^ fact the only sounds I hav,
heard my Coquette make is a weak " twitting " note uttered occasion 11 ;
when on the wing and a high pitched whining note, used only when h,
bird is disturbed^ night. This " whine " is not peculiar to the Frille.
Coquette as I have heafd a number of the smaller species of hummingbird
nop it when disturbed at night. _ ,. , ,
The Frilled does not appear to be highly insectivorous. y ir oe
take perhaps twenty fruit-flies each day, but compared to many specie,
this is relatively few. The Coquette does not hawk these flies,
prefers to pick' them from a surface, tossing them into the air an
swallowing them with gaping beak, all in one deft moment
characteristic of this species, is the tail-wagging which is kept up
tinuouslv while the bird is in flight. . ,
The display of this species is quite remarkable. The tail is fanned a
held forward under the body; the crest is also fanned and brougl
forward; the frills are extended to their utmost. The bi rd then commenc,
to display by moving its body up and down very rapidly The displ.
is terminated by the bird moving its body from side to side, again ve
rapidly. During the final movements, the bird's body moves so fast it
difficult for the eye to follow and it always amazes me that the bird
able to remain airborne. Perhaps I should emphasize it is the body
the bird which moves, the head being held directly in front of the o j&amp;lt;
of display throughout the procedure. . j
I believe this species includes aerobatics as part of its d,splay in t
wild. In the confines of a cage, it is of course, impossible foir mybird
attempt these. When in breeding condition my Coquette displ
many times throughout the day. Mostly the display is directed at
feeding tube, probably because of the red lip.
The outstanding features of the male Frilled Coquette are the fan-
frills on each side of the neck, which are white tipped with a crescent-si af
bar of glittering green, and the erectile crest which is rich chestnu &amp;apos;
the tail. Throat and forehead are glittering emerald green. As with
Lophornis, there is a conspicuous band across the rump, whic in
^ Very little space is given over to the descriptions of female hummingbj
in the books I have read and it is rare to find an illustration of a fema
other than some of the very old works. As most Lophornis fem.
seem to be very much alike, except for their different coloured
bands and beaks, it has been impossible to identify correctly th
female Coquettes I have seen, if indeed they were actually e (TM) a e
not immature males. A few months ago, I purchased two more Coque
but until I have moulted them both out, it is impossible to tell whe.

Though formerly treated as subspecies, the three forms of umbrellabirds
; now regarded by many ornithologists as distinct species. The
re-necked umbrellabird (Cephalopterus glabricollis) is restricted to
"ta Rica and northwestern Panama while the other two species enjoy

I he first umbrellabird known to science was collected in the Amazon

Geoffrey Samt-Hilaire. To this day, over 150 years later, the natural
tory of these intriguing cotingas is obscure.
Jmbrellabirds are extremely heavily muscled birds with very large
verful grasping feet. Their grasp is strong enough to break the skin.'
ey are not at all reluctant to bite and often snap their bills shut with a
chck. They lack the bright, gaudy coloration of many of the cotingas,
their fancy adornments more than compensates for this. These
is are named for their prominent crest that covers the head, somewhat
an umbrella. The crest of C. ornatus , the most developed of the
-e, may measure over 5 cm. in length. It is very thick, divided hair
a t e en s and curves laterally. The bird possesses considerable
scular control over the crest and can position it according to its mood,

ressed to the rear during flight. The wattle also is usually held

wattle may extend down an additional 7 cm. 1 he skin around the thro,

The Los Angeles Zoo has successfully maintained three pairs of loi
wattled umbrellabirds for four and a half years. Upon arrival
were extremely thin, with the sturnum plainly visible. One of our fi
major obstacles was to overcome their reluctance to eat, and most w
force fed for a period of time. In this respect we have seen that yoi
birds adapt more rapidly than the adults.
In January, 1969 the senior author travelled to Ecuador to familia

md their way in to captivity are caught by the natives with mist nets set
pproximately 18 metres from the ground. The set may be three nets or
1 metres tall. The birds are very elusive and difficult to net. Indian
rappers claim the males usually appear first, followed by one or more
miales. Most are netted during the early morning or evening hours
ffien feeding activity is greatest. They do, however, feed throughout
le day. The Indians also claim they are easier to catch when it is
lining as the rain apparently forces them to fly lower and they become
Although they are reported to be very rare, this may be due to the
usiveness and shyness of the species. In three days of netting, three
iult males were collected and there was evidence of others in the area.
Their call is extremely loud and has been discribed by Cordier
eferring to C. glabncollis ) as the growling of a distant jaguar, to the
r-away mooing of cattle. In Ecuador they are referred to by the
idians as " Vaca del Monte " or mountain cattle and in some cases the
bull-bird ".
Although they are strong fliers, their flight is slow and somewhat
umsy. Helmut Sick indicates he has observed them crossing the
tngu River where it was 800 metres wide. As to be expected of a
nopy dweller, the wings are relatively broad and short. They move
rough trees by a series of long springs or interrupted flying jumps,
hey are very noisy when they move and often they land on thin branches,
using them to sag considerably, rustling loudly.
The exact nesting season of these birds is unknown, but it is probably
the late spring or early summer. Nesting has been reported in both
2 wet and dry seasons and it is conceivable they nest twice a year,
iring this time their calling becomes more intense. The trachea is
; atly enlarged and a special resonance device has been developed.
Very little has been recorded concerning the nesting activity of
ibrellabirds, but Sick describes a nest of a loose accumulation of twigs,
ne 12 metres from the ground. The clutch comprised a single egg,
iong in shape and rather pointed at one end. It measured 56.0 x 35.8
n. and was khaki-coloured, with light chocolate and purplish brown
&amp;gt;ts and lightly stippled with dark brown. There was little gloss,
han stories indicate they lay two eggs but produce only one chick.
he skin of these birds is highly prized by local natives. We saw more
n one possessed by Indians. Interestingly, the crest of the umbrella-
!. an ^ hair style of many of the Indians in the area is strikingly
ular. According to Sick, "Some Jivaro Indian tribes see in
vialopterus the emblem of a successful warrior: the crest symbolized
enemy s scalp. Other tribes fear the umbrellabird and believe him
3e a demon. In the domain of C. penduliger the long wattle with its
roes is the part most appreciated. Several of these hung together are
sidered the rarest and most valuable of jewels ".

Acclimatizing umbrellabirds to captivity is often difficult and ma
req &quot;ntinual extensive hand-feeding. Their d.et m the wtld " *
completely known but does include various "
beetles caterpillars, grasshoppers and butterflies. The fruit appears to
dicotyledons ^ of various species. Cordier (personal commun.catio.
indicates they eat small palm nuts, cherry-l.ke fruit growing direct
on the bark ^of trees, berries and fruit of Ceaopra. Although he d,
not observe them catching insects, he is convinced they do. Fruit
swallowed whole and the pips regurgitated later. Stomach contents,
two adult males examined contained mainly semi-digested fruits w.
seeds and several elytra of Coleoptera.
Those birds in the Los Angeles Zoo are fed diced fruit (apples, orangt
arapes, bananas, papaya and melon), 1 in. meatballs composed of grou,
meat carnivore mix, geveral, mockingbird mix and ground carrot a,
Z mix,  |in. balls of dog food, mice (one per bird per day) day o
chicks mealworms, crickets, hard-boiled eggs and mynah bird pelle
When&amp;apos; they 3 first arrived, several had to be force fed but soon accept
new-born mice.
For several months, they were kept off exhibit in order to observe a

where they did well until some months later they were seen to catch a
consume small tanagers (genus Tangara). On one occasion the sen
author observed an adult male capture a house mouse (Mur muscul
and beat it against a perch like a kingfisher prior to swallowing it wh,
From these observations it would appear that these cotingas are qi
carnivorous. We then separated them into pairs and moved them 1
three large, heavily planted aviaries with bigger birds. In the spring
1060 one pair was moved to a large flight cage where they are thnvi
They remain aloof from other birds but appear to be compatible v
other species, if they are not too small.
Once acclimatized, they appear to be a relatively hardy species.

Their main predator appears to be man. Based on our observations,
anting and trapping them does not appear to be seriously affecting
ie population. However, habitat destruction is being conducted at an
arming rate and if this has not affected them yet, it probably will in the

BREEDING THE SILVER-EARED MESIA

donesia to south-western China. It is a bird of the scrub jungle with
lododendron and other bushes. It is a flock bird and the nest is
scribed as being made of dry bamboo, leaves, grass and moss and lined
th fine plant fibre; the eggs being small and pale blue with brown
:ches. Both birds share the incubation.
During August, 1970 I obtained a pair of these beautiful but rather
stable members of the diverse family of babblers. The rest of the
ir they were kept in an outside planted flight with a few Chinese
nted Quail. They were over-wintered in my birdroom as I do not
lsider it fair to expect this type of bird to put up with the English
iters. By all means give them access to an outdoor flight on fine days
- bring them into the birdroom at night.
Vbout the beginning of March, 1971 they were put outside in a flight
ft. x 12 ft. with a pair of Pagoda Mynahs (Sturnus pagodarum).
rmally the Pagoda Mynahs are fairly peaceful birds so I thought they
u d be fairly amicable in a large flight which contains a few small
ubs and a nice large clump of bamboo. All appeared to be going
y peaceably so I hung a box 18 in. x 6 in. x 6 in. high up at an angle
t e Pagodas, they began to show interest in the box about the second
k in April, 1971 (but their married life is another story.)

Around the second week of May the Mesias commenced to build
little nest in the middle of the bamboo clump with the exact materia,
described above--I even obtained some fibre from a Borassus Palm re
growing in a park! In an effort to stimulate the pair to nest I obtaine

(Poicephalus m. meyeri)
By Dr. William S. Hawkins (Sunland, California, U.S.A.)
The Poicephalus group of parrots consists of eight main species and
me twenty subspecies, all inhabiting the Ethiopian Region which in a
oad sense includes all of Africa south of the Sahara Desert. The
rious Senegal Parrots, Ruppell's Parrot and Meyer's Parrot are the
presentatives most commonly found in aviaries. The latter have never
en common in collections in the U.S.A., but with the changes in import
strictions, a few of these birds are now available.
Meyer s Parrot is variously referred to as the Brown Parrot or the
idan Brown Parrot. Seven subspecies of this bird are recognized,
labiting different areas and showing very slight differences in coloration.&amp;apos;
fferentiation would require an ornithological expert. In general, all
; called Meyer's Parrots, named in honour of Dr. Bernhard Meyer,
767-1836), a German dentist who contributed much to the fields of
tany and ornithology during his era. Although the bird was first
covered by Riippell, the name, Meyer, was dedicated in recognition
this man's work.
Broadly speaking, the Poicephalus parrots somewhat resemble larger
sions of the Lovebirds. Their range and behavior are also somewhat
lilar. Meyer's Parrots are widely distributed and are partially
oratory, following food and water supplies. They are found largely in
annah woodlands, along water-courses, and in acacia groves, but are
ient from the West African forest belt. They appear to be of a
garious nature.
Uthough not truly dimorphic, there does seem to be more sexual
erentiation than is visible in most psittacine birds. This is not as
&amp;gt;arent, however, as in the case of Ruppell's Parrot, in which the female
iefinitely more brightly colored than the male. Most authorities
e that the cock Meyer's is larger and more brightly colored than the
tale, the color being the gold on the head and the wing butts. In
case of the pair which I have this seems to be reversed so perhaps
!\0x25A0 " difference " is open to question,
hese birds are quiet and steady in the aviary and are said to make
silent caged pets if hand-raised. Mine imitate a pair of Indian
gnecks in an adjacent aviary to perfection, but I have no knowledge
ust how proficient their ability to mimic might be. They are not
&amp;gt;y or quarrelsome, either between themselves or with their aviary
;hbors. Certainly their diminutive size, beauty, and disposition
ild make them an ideal " pet " bird should they ever become readily
lable.

DR. W. S. HAWKINS--MEYER'S PARROT
The pair which I now keep were purchased in the late summer o
iq6q as immature and newly imported birds. They were kept in ai
indoor flight-cage without artificial heat until the following spring
approximately six months, and during this sojourn they proved to be ver
tractable. No undue stress was noted during this period of acclimatizatior
The usual seeds were furnished with no particular attention to green foo,
or fruits. Although not tame, these birds never exhibited undue fngh
during this confinement.
With the advent of spring the pair was placed in an outdoor aviar}
four by twenty-three feet, alone. A nest-box was provided, ten mchc
square by eighteen inches deep, containing about four inches of decaye
wood. During the summer they completed their adult moult and becara
much more colorful. Daily baths were provided by means of a sprinkl&amp;lt;
system, and this they enjoyed immensely. Green food and fruit wei
also provided which they were very fond of and always carried to the
drinking fountains in the fashion of many of the Asiatic parrakeets.
Late in the summer of 1970 the birds began to evince an interest 1
their nest-box and in early September three eggs were laid. The he
had made a small scrape in one corner and seemed to incubate alor
while the cock often perched on the ledge outside of the box. Th
coincided with the most extreme heat in this part of Southern Californ
and also with my own vacation, so that the birds were not watch*
carefully. All three eggs proved to be fertile, but none hatched whit
came as no surprise considering the extremely high temperatuies.
In 1971, near the first of February, the birds once again began to she
an interest in their nest-box. In the first week of February three eg
were laid. By this time the birds were even steadier, but both of the
always appeared at feeding time or during any disturbance in t
aviaries. On 9th February the severe earthquake struck this immedk
area of the state, and I felt sure their project would once again be ill-fate
This, however, was not the case. The hen did not leave the nest, ai
subsequently on or about the 21st February, all three eggs hatched, ti
hatchlings on the first day and the third two days later. Both parei
were extremely attentive, the cock in particular showing interest in t
activity. The same seeds were furnished, but in addition, a generc
supply of soaked oats was provided along with sweet apple, green foe
whole wheat bread, and a few peanuts every morning. These ext.
were consumed eargerly with a decided lessening of interest in the regu
seed mixture.
The young birds appeared similar to infant Lovebirds with patches
white down. They were checked once a week without causing 2
apparent alarm to the parents, and the infants always seemed fat a
well fed. The smallest, however, appeared to be lagging and on '
7th May, this bird was given to a friend for hand-feeding. Its j
feathers were well developed at this time. This bird was sucessfi

ised and developed perfectly, only to meet with disaster later on by
ay of an accident. The two remaining young were successfully reared
/ their parents and left the nest about three weeks later. On emergence
om the nest these youngsters, quite unlike their parents, proved to be
&amp;apos;sterical in confinement. Both, within twenty four hours, had broken
eir necks in dashing about the flight.
In October of the same year the adults once again went to nest and
oduced three fertile eggs. These hatched on the 12th November
td received the same exemplary care from both parents. However,
ice the weather was becoming very chilly and it appeared that the
ung would fledge during the rainy season, I decided to remove the
ree of them on the 9th December. At this time they were still covered
th down and were very fat and uniform in size. Through the expertize
Eleanor Cooley, all three were successfully hand-raised and were fully
dependent by the first week in February.
The juvenile birds are smaller and duller editions of their parents
I Ting the gold markings and of a more or less uniform grey shade!
le brilliant sea-green rump patch is present, however. They are very
ntle, but even having been hand-raised are inclined to panic very
;ily in strange situations. Their diet at four months of age is identical
th the parents'.
A.s of this writing, the 1st March 1972, the parents are once again
abating fertile eggs, this time, four in the clutch,
ive these birds been bred before in the United States? It would be
interest to me to find out the details if so, since they must still be
lsidered one of the rarer psittacines kept in captivity. I am now
lined to attempt to breed them in a colony since their behaviour seems
similar to that of the Lovebirds. Hybrids have been reported with
ppell's Parrot and are said to be very beautiful birds.
:ertainly Meyer's Parrots with their many attributes deserve a firmly
finished place in our avicultural endeavours.

By D. M. Holyoak and D. T. Holyoak (Weybridge, Surrey, Englanc
The behaviour of the eight species of the African parrot gem
Poicephalus is surprisingly little known considering the frequency wit
which some of the species are kept in captivity. However numeroi
other groups of parrots are similarly little known, although the oth
large genus of African parrots, the lovebirds Agapornis spp., has bet
closely studied by Dilger (i960, 1964). , , D
Poicephalus has two rather large species, the Brown-necked Parr
P. robustus and the Red-headed Parrot P. gulielmi, and six smaller one
of which we were able to watch the Yellow-bellied Parrot P. senegalu
Brown-headed Parrot P. cryptoxanthus , Brown Parrot P. meyeri , ar
Riippell's Parrot P. ruppellii. All of these are confined to various par
of Africa south of the Sahara. Mackworth-Praed and Grant (195
1962, 1970) give details of the ranges, subspecies, food and general habi
of these species in the wild and plates illustrating them.
Observations were made on the species listed above at the London Z&amp;lt;
between January 1970 and June 1971. Most of the observations were
three P. senegalus , three P. cryptoxanthus , two males of P. meyeri and t\
P. gulielmi, a few on singles of P. robustus and P. ruppellii . These lr
were housed indoors in large all-wire cages.
None of the birds bred during the period of observation and it was n
possible to be sure of the sex of several individuals. Because of this &amp;apos;
were unable to judge the function of many behaviour patterns and m
not have seen the full repertoire of display from any of the specu
Nevertheless it seems worthwhile publishing the information we ha
recorded as we are unable to make further regular observations and it m
be of value in comparative behaviour studies and in encouraging furtl
investigation. The behaviour patterns are compared throughout tl
paper with those of lovebirds, which have been described in detail
Dilger. Dilger's terminology of displays is followed.

These include behaviour concerned with maintenance of plumage, s
parts and skin; some of the motor patterns used in these behaviour pattei
appear to have been the precursors of ritualized agonistic and epigar
displays.
Bathing was only seen once, from P. senegalus , although splashes arou
the water dishes in the cages suggested it was fairly frequently perform

itering the water several times it flew to a perch, preened lightly and
ten rested. Lovebirds also bathe by quickly entering and leaving the
ater (Dilger i960, 1964) but hanging parrots Loriculus spp. stand in the
ater for longer periods (Buckley 1968).
Head-scratching was performed directly (foot under the wing) in all
the species studied, as previously recorded by Brereton and Immelmann
962).
Stretching movements were similar to those recorded in Loriculus and
vaporms. The commonest movements were stretching of one leg with
e ipsilateral wing and half of tail, followed by the same on the other
:ie of the body, stretching both wings upwards over the back, and
rious plumage fluffing and sleeking movements.
Preening and oiling were similar to these actions in Agapomis and
, &amp;gt;riculus.
Drinking is performed in the same way as in Agapomis in all species
itched, by dipping the bill into the water and sucking it up, without
I rowing the head back as some other parrots and most non-psittacines
i.
Feeding. The birds studied were fed on a diet of mixed small seeds
ist of which were picked up in the bill, husked and swallowed without
s of the feet. Larger food items were picked up in a foot or in the
1 and transferred to a foot, then held up in the foot while being chewed,
hen fed with long strips of carrot none of the six species held it down
th the foot as Budgerigars Melopsittacus undulatus and grass parakeets
ophema spp. were seen to do. None of the species was seen to scratch
the ground litter with a foot as seen in Psittacula and Cyanoramphus
).
Bill-wiping was frequently performed with a side to side stropping
*tion on perches after feeding. The bill was also scratched with
vements similar to those used in head-scratching. The legs and feet
re frequently nibbled gently with the bill tip using a similar action to
t often used when preening.
Agonistic displays and Fighting Behaviour
Threat displays and fighting behaviour are highly ritualized in
cephalus so that harmful fighting is rare or absent. The posturings used
similar to those in Agapomis , but with differences in intensity and
;ree.
&amp;apos;ig-threat displays are commonly used. At low intensity the carpal
its are held out from the body exposing bright patches of colour on the
de of the carpal joint (Fig. iA). With increasing aggression the
;&amp;gt;al joints are first flicked or shivered and at high intensity the whole
gs are held vertically over the back (Fig. iB, iC, iD). Carpal holding
iescribed was seen in gulielmi , cryptoxanthus , senegalus and ruppellii;
^al-flicking or shivering in the same four species, and wing-holding in

11 s), meyeri (only seen a few times, probably not highly ritualized in
is species), and ruppellii (seen to flap partly opened wings, but not to

loured plumage on the carpal joint and wing-linings, yellow in cryptoxan-
us &amp;gt; meyert, senegalus and ruppellii , red in gulielmi . The bright patches
plumage in the other species of the genus suggest they have similar
splays.
Cdh used in agonistic display include sharp, repeated clicking notes
gulielmi and senegalus. At first we thought these notes were produced
ichanically by bill-clicking, but later we saw a gulielmi giving them
th food in its bill so they must be vocally produced. P. cryptoxanthus
r es loud squeaks and a repeated swi swi call while giving carpals-held
d carpal-flicking displays and loud squeaks while wing-holding P
egalus was heard to give repeated loud, shrill squeaks as the usual
:ompaniment to wing-holding and sometimes a low, throatv grating
1 with this display. 5
Lunging and gaping movements were frequently directed at birds that
broached too close to the performing individual. Gaping in threat

gmg was seen in gulielmi and senegalus (Fig.zB). Gaping always
ompanied lunging.
Aggressive-walking towards an opponent resembling the rushing display
Lonculus and Agapornis was seen at high intensity in gulielmi and
pellii and at low intensity in cryptoxanthus , meyeri and senegalus

Igerigars (Brockway 1964 a) and some other parrots was never seen.

gaping, were seen to be used by all six species (Fig. 2D); the bright

Submission to aggressive display is indicated by the threatened bird

Various displays similar to those used in sexual displays by Loriculus
i Agaporms were seen. As breeding and copulation were not seen in
3 study it was impossible to be sure of the exact context in which these
plays are usually performed.
twitch-sidling displays were seen to be performed by gulielmi
ptoxanthus and meyen. P. meyeri was seen to give a highly-ritualized
tch-sidhng display in which a male bird made sudden complete spins
und on the perch as it ran backwards and forwards giving short twitters,
istles and a repeated loud nasal twar call, with carpal joints held out
n the body and occasionally shivered (Fig. 3 A). This display was
formed rapidly for several minutes at a time, with a mechanical
:kwork motion. P. gulielmi gave a less ritualized display, without calls,
with occasional deep bowing movements which were not present in
displays of meyeri (Fig. 3 B).
ryptoxanthm gave a similar display to that of gulielmi, but lacking the
ang movements which were reduced to a slight head-dipping action
giving squeaking calls.
t-lifting displays similar to those of some lovebirds were seen to

one foot as if about to head-scratch and then either lowers it again (Fig.
or head-scratches, the foot nearest the other bird being lifted most
This display may have originated from head-scratching used as a
lacement activity or from the movements of stepping on to the mates

ing-displays similar to those used in agonistic display (carpal-holding

By J. Delacour (Cleres, France)
In these days of astonishing and disorderly proliferation of zoos an
bird narks throughout the world, it is a rare pleasure to discover a red.
&quot;ood one But it is just what has happened to me and to my friend
Mr. and Mrs. Paul Jourde, when we stopped at the small town of 1 ar
les-Dombes on the 5th June 1971. T , r
It is not that this new bird park was unknown to me.
years I received at Cleres a group of leaders of the Departme
(County) de l'Ain, which is situated in the east of France, norA of yi
and west of Geneva. The district of La Dombes extends west to t,
Rhone river, north to Bourg-en-Bresse, east to Ambeneux and Peroug
(an extraordinarily well and completely preserved medieval town)
south to a few miles north of Lyon. f * 1 c.
It is one of the largest " wetland in Western Europe My
country over 40 miles wide covers n.000 hectares, t is dotted w,
inumerable lakes, the home of large populations of wild ducks, hero
small waders and other water birds. The County authorities were
aware of its great importance for wildlife, and they had decided to set
a " Parc-Reserve ". They not only wanted to organise a refuge
breeding and migrating waterfowl, but also to show the public, in a v
planned^and kept park, the 200 local species as well as a nu (TM) b f&amp;apos; T
ones They intended to interest all classes of people in bird life, lo
as well as tourists, by showing the birds under as near as possible natc
conditions and so to contribute to their conservation.
The delegation that came to Cleres included the Deputy Prefect,
President of the County Council, M. Saint-Cyr a veterinarian an.
keen animal lover, M. Faure, the director of Public Works anot
nature enthusiast. Dr. Ciarpaglmi and I, also in Paris Prof. J.
Director of the zoos, and his assistants, tried to help them in all poss
ways in the planning of their park. A great deal of skill, time and mo,
was spent on the project and the bird park was opened on 18th July id
I was unfortunately unable to attend which I much regretted,
curator, a former assistant of the Paris Zoo, M. Bernard Liauzu, was i
known to me; I realised that he was a capable technician and, wor
under M. Faure's directives, he was likely to organise and to keep e I
well. But one never knows, and previous disillusions in 1 el
countries, when I had seen for the first time the results of well mteO
good advice, have made me suspicious. My wariness, this time, pro
quite unnecessary. The Parc Ornithologique de la Dombes is a sue.
and no doubt one of the best of its kind in the world.
It consists mainly of a long lake (Etang Grand Turlet) with smaller]
at both ends. The landscape is typical of a marsh, with comparatively

trees, mostly poplars and willows. Many others, however have bee
planted and are growing well; they will add much to the charm o t .
grounds as time goes on. All around the lake is a walk, and at the side
away from the lake, are groups of aviaries and enclosures for various kind
of birds, all elaborately built and planted and very attractive Near tl
entrance is an excellent birdhouse, with large, planted indoor flight
luxuriously finished and fitted, which compares favourably with tl
average bird house of large, modern zoos. A very attractive bar-restaurar,
in the shape of a rotonda, with a wonderful view of the lake, stanc
near-by. The adjoining plan shows what the park is like better than
more detailed description. .
The collection is extensive and consists of all sorts of birds iro
Ostriches to Sunbirds and Hummingbirds. The accommodation
roomy, well built and well kept. Good breeding results were alrea&amp;lt;
achieved in 1970 as the following list shows:
Native Birds reared: Mute Swans, Pintails, Red-crested Pochar
(they also breed wild locally), Shelducks, Teal, Pochards, White-ey
(also a rare local breeder), Shovelers, Gadwalls, Greenfinches ai
Yellowhammers. (A total of 127 birds).
</bodyText>
<table confidence="0.889296333333333" page_id="58078128"  page_num="98" year="" vol="">

Fulvous Tree Ducks, Chestnut and Marbled Teal (Total 334 bird
In addition 21 birds were reared by the parents in the free state
Tufted Duck, Gadwall, Garganey, White-eyed Duck and Red Jungle fo 1
25 local breeding birds were hand-reared: Long-eared, Brown and Lit
Owls, Black Kite, Kestrel, Montagu's Harrier, Purple Heron, Ni*

There is no doubt that even better results will be obtained in t
future when the birds have settled down completely.
The following wild species have nested in the park in 1970; Malla
Gadwall, Red-crested Pochard, Tufted Duck, Coot, Moorhen, Kesl
several Reed and other warblers, Stonechat, Black Redstart, Great 1
Martin, Starling, Tree Sparrow, Greenfinch, Goldfinch, Reed Bunt
and many others outside the Park. I
Among the most interesting displays are those of the bird houses wh
many species of Toucan's, Touracous, Tanagers, Barbets, Woodpedj
Jays, Starlings and seedeaters, as well as a few Sunbirds and Hummingbi,
are well exhibited.
Several large outdoor aviaries are well worth mentioning: one wit

with native hawks, eagles and owls. Vultures are kept wing-clip

The " stepped " inside of the lower mandible probably enables Pair
Cockatoos to feed efficiently on both large and small seeds, where*
a bill of this size without " steps " would probably be inefficient whe

A very rare event is the hatching and raising in our Zoo of a Long-crested
Eagle {Lophoaetus occipitalis). Two eggs were laid at the beginning of
lanuary One egg was left with the parents, the other one was put in an
incubator. Aftefan incubation period of 40 days, the two young hatched.
Unfortunately the one we had left with the parents was found dead a
few days later The other one developed extremely well under the care,
of the keeper who has already raised Black Vultures (Coragyps atratus -
and Andean Condors (Vullur gryphus) several times^ It is unknown tcj
us whether there has been any breeding success with these rare African
birds of prey in other zoos and naturally we are very pleased with th,
U Ts P in Ct the eV pa n ^ years the fine breeding pair of European Eagle-Owl
(Bubo bubo) again pleased us with three grey and white Easter chicks
which were hatched on nth, 12th and 13th March. Now they hay
grown so much that they no longer fit under the feathers of their mother
Their appetite is very remarkable. Whereas they had been nurse
their parents during the first days, they now gulp down each its ow
portion of mice. These young will be given to a German W.ldlij
Preservation organization and from there set free in the Harz, Baynsc
Wald or other suitable areas of the Federal Republic of Germany.
In addition to these remarkable breeding successes so very ear Y * n 1
season, two Cape Barren Geese ( Cereopsis novaehollandiae) and or
Rock-dove (Columba livia) were hatched. ,
New to our collection of Birds of Paradise is a pair of Wilson s Bird
Paradise or Bareheaded little King (, Diphyllodes respubhca) and foi
young Greater Birds of Paradise (Paradisea apoda) still in their simp
brown juvenile plumage.

THE SWANS. By Peter Scott and the Wildfowl Trust. Londo,
Michael Joseph, 1972. Price #4.20.
The beauty, grace and romantic mystery of these magnificent bit
has attracted both writers and artists since the earliest times u J
beautiful book is the first to deal comprehensively and scientifically
all the eight species of swans. Appropriately enough it is a combina
of the wmk of artists and scientists, for Peter Scott has painted
frontispiece and drawn many of the line illustrations and in addi
Philippa Scott and Ted Jackson are responsible for many of 4 " b '
and white plates, together with some of the world s best wi j
photographers. The text, divided into nine chapters is by Peter Sc
who writes the introduction, and members of the Wildfowl Trust. 1 j
description of the species is by Hugh Boyd, followed by their distnbut
migration and numbers by Malcolm Ogilvie. The habitat and food
described by Myrfyn Owen and Janet Kear; and Janet ear a so
an account of reproduction and family life. John Beer and Male
Ogilvie write on disease and death; Andrew Dawnay on swans and m
Mary Evans and Andrew Dawnay on swans in art, heraldry an m&amp;gt;
and Geoffrey Matthews on their conservation. The whole is under .&amp;lt;
general editorship of George Atkinson-Willes.
There are a number of appendices including tables giving e w ,
and measurements of swans, clutch size and longevity, and also lis
recorded foods; and finally a comprehensive list of references.
We have nothing but admiration for this beautiful work but ope \0x25A0
in future editions it might be possible to include at least one example 0
swan in dramatic art, following those in pictorial art. ^

By Ralph Zackrisson (Gothenburg, Sweden)
In connection with a visit to a bird exhibition in Ystad in the autumn of
69. I had a look in a pet shop m the little village of Kavlinge. In one
he cages there was a pair of birds which nobody was really able to
*ntify. My interest in them was quickly aroused, although one of them
s in rather bad condition. This made me hesitate, but after some
^deration I made up my mind, took the chance and bought the two
hater the same day I paid a visit to a friend in Smygehamn, the southern-
T m u W ! den ; ! nd mUCh t0 ^ sur P r ' se I found in his collection
ither three birds of the same species as the pair I had already bought
&amp;apos; fr ' en t d r er y k ' nd 'y let me have his three specimens, so I was&amp;apos;fortunate
&amp;gt;ugh to bring home to Gothenburg no less than five birds of this still
mown species.
ill of the birds, three males and two females, were put into a box-type
e, measuring ioo x 70 x 60 cm (40 x 28 x 24 inches), which I always use
acclimatization of new birds during their first weeks in my possession.
- of the males was very ill and soon died, but the remaining four, an
' r and a y* un g er pair, seemed fit and were subsequently released in an
oor aviary, 3Xi- S xi-8m. (iox 5 x 6 feet), which they shared with
ie finches and waxbills.
luring the spring of 1970 the two older birds started to build an open
I&amp;apos; ln a b,r f ch thlcket ' but " was never finished. Soon afterwards I had
.0 away for a couple of days, and on my return the female was dead,
examination I found in her a soft-shelled egg, and so I concluded that
*binding was the cause of her death. As far as breeding attempts are
-erned, nothmg else happened that year to my Pretty, or Cinnamon,

extent through help from some over-ambitious friends and their literature
^Nexfspring, 1971, the younger male turned very aggressive towards the&amp;apos;
older male, so I found it advisable to remove the latter from the av.ar,
they had hitherto shared. At the end of June my new bird-house will
adjoining outdoor aviary was finally ready to be taken into use_ Mos
of my birds were immediately released there, but not the Warbling Finches
since the male had now begun to fly around with nesting material m his,
bill. However, some weeks passed without anything happening, wh.l.
the birds in the outdoor aviary were thriving and had stalled nest-bui j n g
Thinking there was enough room in my new aviary fo ^ the War
Finches too, I decided to let them out into it as well. The bird-hou*
measures 7 x 3 x 2 m. (10 x 10 x 7 feet) and the outdoor aviaiy 5x3 x 2 m
( l y x 10 x 7 feet), planted with two small but thick elms and furnished will
some pine thickets and several branches. . T , ,
This releasing was, however, one of the biggest mistakes i have mad
with my birds, because the male Warbling Finch quickly selected a ter
ritory in the aviary where he only accepted a pair of Grey-headed Soci.
Weavers (Pseudonigrita arnaudi). He became especia y aggressive c
wards a pair of Fawn-breasted Waxbills (Estnlda paludicola) and a fema
Violet-eared Waxbill (Uraeginthus granatinus). Their genera 1 o
colours agree to some extent with those of the W arbhng-finches wh
might be the reason for the male's great aggression. Sometimes he eve
chased the above-mentioned birds inside the bird-house.
When the female soon started to build an open, cup-shaped nest 1
pine thicket about i- S m. (5 feet) above the ground it became obvious,
me why nothing had come out of the male s earlier flying about with a j
grass-blade in his bill. He only took part in the nest-building with .
occasional grass-blade now and then, otherwise he just made in s P ect ' on
The inner diameter of the nest measured 4-5 cm. (almost 2 inches), a &quot;
was equally deep. Basically it was built of moss and grass-blades, 1
with horse-hair. Regrettably I was never able to watch any display.
On July tth the female was brooding three eggs, which were ab
l 7 x n mm. in size, coloured whitish with irregular brown spots,
observed only the female sitting on the eggs, and she sat very well. 1
male now fed her rather often in the nest with a variety of insects,
left the nest only a few times a day in order to have some water, alw
followed by her mate, who twittered incessantly until she had retur
to the nest again and recommenced brooding.
During this time he became more pugnacious than ever and also s
rather energetically, but ceased his singing as soon as the eggs hatched.
When feeding my birds in the evening of July 17th, the mal
Finch at once flew down on the ground, took some fresh ants cocoon
his bill and then flew up to the nest, in order to feed the female I th g
but I was wrong. Instead the happy mother stood up in the nest to

Later the same evening when the female left the nest I saw my chance
a a quick look down into it. There were three young ones, which
stimated to be a few days old. They were greyish in colour with grey

. 1 hese insects were put into a plastic bag, which I kept in a freezer
a quarter of an hour. Then I thawed the insects and fed the birds
urn u However ' 1 found that the thawing time should last for at
it hair an hour.
iverything went well for a couple of days, but in the evening of the .oth
served that one of the youngsters had been thrown out of the nest. So
ent inside the aviary and on checking I found only one nestling left
ahve. After some searching the third young one was also found

ad received no signs of response from them when he returned to
them even more, therefore thinking that they were dead and conse-

n what to do? Well, I started collecting spiders, which is a very time-
inning task The spiders, however, turned out to be an extremely
eciated food, and soon the male almost completely refused to feed
orogeny with anything else. Sometimes he also seemed to soak the
in water before feeding.
he remaining young one was about eight days old when for the first

do was to catch him up and put him in a hospital cage. I treated hii
with terramycin, an antibiotic capable of curing several different disease;
but this time it was of no help and the male Warbling Finch died within
couple of days. . A
I can add here that a young Grey-headed Social Weaver died in th|
same way. A post mortem of this youngster showed that it had die
from gapeworm (Syngamus trachealis).
Back to the young Warbling Finch. It left the nest the day its fatly
died and should by that time have been about twelve days of age. As
was still far from fully fledged and quite unable to fly, I put it back ini.
the nest. The female, however, by calling at once persuaded it to lea^
the nest again.
The following days the chick spent perching closely to the nest withoi
moving much, but the female still fed it. My helpful friends found
the literature an earlier report on the breeding of this species in Englar,
(Cummings i960). In that case the young ones had left the nest equal
early. Therefore I believe we must consider this early leaving of tl
nest of Poospiza youngsters as a normal habit. There is another speck
the Jacarini Finch (Volatinia jacarina), from which I have br&amp;lt;|
repeatedly, which to my mind is rather similar to the Pretty Warbln
Finch in several respects, e.g. nest-construction. Their young ones lea
those of the Warbling Finches and are the nest just as early as equa
helpless during their first days outside the nest, too.
The female fed the young one with mealworms only during the ftj
few days after its leaving the nest and she definitely refused to feed
with anything else. This made me somewhat worried, feeling such a d
must be too one-sided and nutritiously incorrect. However, the fem
solved the problem herself when, some days later, she recommenc
feeding her progeny with all types of food offered.
At this time the hen had started to fly about with nesting material
her bill again, and she also made efforts to build new nests in so
different spots of the aviary, but now there was no male to defend th
against nest material thieves. Therefore all her nest-building was in va
Why the other birds preferred hers to all the other nest material availal
I really cannot understand.
At the age of three weeks the young Warbling Finch had beco
independent, so I caught up the female and let her in to the older, sin
male. The two seemed to agree very well together and three weeks k
they began to construct a nest. In this case, however, the female did
take the lead but instead the male did. The constructing went v
slowly, resulting in an incomplete nest.
In the same aviary there was a pair of Violet-eared Waxbills. They
been kept together with the male Warbling Finch all spring and sumn
and there had never been any quarrel between them. But now
apparently changed his temper all of a sudden, because one evening w

There is also a crimson patch on either side of the rump (usually 1 &amp;lt;
by the wing). Primaries are dark blue and the under wing is grey wit
white wing stripe as in Reoplemas. This stripe seems to be m
prominent in the female. Iris is bright orange-red and the pupil bit

The Kakariki is not an aggressive bird, but I would not put finches in
aviary for breeding. Kakarikis are very curious birds and deligh
destroying nests of smaller land working individuals.
Their calls are not offensive to the ear and usually consist of a

The pair are housed in a 12 ft. x 7 ft. high x 6 ft. wide aviary, of w

The nest-box was filled with peat moss and wood shavings; from this,
he female made a " bowl " for the eggs. Kakarikis are credited with
aying large clutches, but my female has only had 3--6 eggs 5 all were fertile
:nd reared to independence.
The incubation period is 18-21 days and in one clutch the first
mingster appeared on the 2/1/72 and four young were seen on the 4/1/72.
rhe fifth youngster hatched two days later and as can be imagined was
ouch smaller and weaker than its companions, which had grown con-
iderably. I therefore felt sure that this youngster was doomed, because
f could not str ive up against its companions to be fed. However my
emale is a very good mother and she must literally have had to move the
ther youngsters to feed the chick, which grew rapidly. On the 13/1/72
lie eldest chick s eyes had opened and pin feathers had begun from most
ody areas.
Up to this time, all young when recently hatched had white down,
&amp;apos;hich was rather wispy, but on the 17/1/72 all young had cast the white
own and it w as replaced by grey down which was of a woolly texture and
lust be warmer for the chicks. Iris colour at this stage is of a pale yellow-
rown texture.
Unfortunately, I was away when the young left the nest-box and could
ot be sure of the dates.
Kakarikis are prolific breeders and will have three clutches (at least) per
ear, but I feel three is already weakening the hen, so I take out the nest
oxes and give her a well earned rest.
Once the young are independent, you must separate the youngsters,
you want to continue successful breeding. I have seen the cock feeding
ie hen and was attempting to mount the female when an ambitious
lungster knocked off the hen and begged for food.
The cock also seems to be slightly aggressive towards his offspring,
fter being out of the nest for two weeks the young are normally feeding
lemselves.
My birds are fed on a mixture of canary, niger, linseed, oats and
inflower favourite being sunflower. Red apples, lettuce, italian spray
lillet, milk thistle and other seeding grasses are given daily. Brown
read and pro-nutro mixed with enough water to make the bread crumble
id germinating seed (oats especially) are given as a rearing food and is
eatly appreciated.
Yellow-fronted Kakarikis are hardy birds and will bath any time of the
-ar. A large bowl is needed for bathing purposes and should be filled
lilv.
J
People seem to be of the opinion that Kakarikis are rather susceptible
diseases and have a high mortality (see G. A. Smith, p. 186, vol. 75,
vicultural Magazine); luckily I have had no trouble as yet, but since
ey are ground birds and like scratching, they are liable to pick up stale
ed or any virus in a dirty aviary, so I keep mine clean every week as well as

PARAKEETS
(Psittacula krameri)

The " Red-billed parrots ", to a large degree, share several behavioun
and structural characteristics: as well as the possession of a red beak.*
Females are the dominant sex. (In Broadtailed parrots Platycercina
_males are usually more aggressive than females. In Neotropical parrol
both sexes seem reasonably evenly matched).
Most of the " Red-bills " take three years before they assume adu
plumage.
The sexes are of different appearance--that of immature males
identical to that of adult females. (In those exceptional Broadtails whei
there is a sexual dimorphism immatures look like " dulled " versions (
their respective sexes).
The cocks often have an elaborate and prolonged courtship display 1
which the females play a " passive " part.
Most (all?) are non-territorial and often nest colonially.
Rain-bathing (vide infra) is shown by many. Water-bathing is usua
I believe that they do not sun-bathe. (Broadtails sun-bathe, water-bat!
and do not rain-bathe. Cockatoos rain-bathe and do not water-bath
Cockatoos, instead of bathing, seem to sit in the water and " souse
themselves; while doing so they do not flutter the wings or duck the hea&amp;lt;
Many Neotropical parrots rain-bathe, a few sun themselves dozing wil
a cheek turned to the sun. Broadtails droop the wings, spread the ta:
and fluff the head when they sunbathe).

Eclectuses, Barrabands, Princess-of-Wales', Lovebirds, " Psittaculids

Except for Lovebirds Agapornis (Dilger i960)--which are, in any cas
aberrant in many ways--and Hanging-parrots Loriculus (Buckley, 196
little substantive seems to have been written about these parrots and tl
following is an attempt to collect some facts about Ringnecks.

have their beaks, or part of their beaks, coloured a curious carmine-red, truit-jui
shade.

G. A. SMITH SOME OBSERVATIONS ON RINGNECKED PARAKEETS 121
This past year I formed a small community of three pairs of adult
ngnecks and a single, immature, year-old hen. They are housed in
twelve foot square by seven foot high, flight, overhung by a large
wering Japanese-cherry. An open-sided asbestos hut provides shelter
the food and sleeping birds.
rhe Ringnecks can be separately identified for they form " natural "
rs: two lutino hens, two adult green cocks (one of the original males
s killed) and two normal green hens, and one of each of the " pairs"
; had the tail shortened with scissors.
rhe three nest-boxes are fastened to the outside of the wire along one
e of the flight and are slightly less than three feet apart. The examina-
i door of each box is opened from the outside, as is the feeding-hatch,
erefore I never need to enter the flight and disturb the bird.
Distribution
tingnecks have the widest lateral range of any species of parrot: extend-
from the west coast of Africa, through India, to the south-east of
na more than 5 &amp;gt; 00 * rniles (fig. i). The distribution seems to be
srmined by them showing a preference for " semi-arid country and
rn scrub " at low altitudes in Africa (Mackworth-Praed &amp; Grant, 1970)
Burma (Smythies, 1953). Similarly in Ceylon where "it is a common
1 throughout the low country dry zone, especially in the coastal districts,
it avoids the hills. In the wet zone it is scarce and sporadic" (Henry,
5). In India, however, perhaps because extensive clearings and
nation has taken place and allowed it to expand a previously more
ricted geographical range, it "affects moist--and dry--deciduous
yp e even semidesert--keeping to light secondary jungle, gardens,
lards and cultivation in the neighbourhood of human habitations "
&amp; Ripley, 1969).
Description
ingnecks are so common in captivity that I shall limit myself to saying
they are beautifully tapered, yellowish-green parrakeets of about the
- body-size as a Starling Sturnus vulgaris --the long tail extending the
length to about fifteen inches. The bill is red, in both sexes--the
ee of black which infiltrates the red of the lower and upper mandibles
ending on different geographical areas. Adult males differ from
lies, and immatures, in that they have a black throat-stripe which
&amp;gt; round towards the back of the neck and thins out on the sides and is
iced by a rose-pink band. The back of the head is powder-blue,
^ht (average of ten wild-caught adults) 116 grams (3f ozs.).

ndiscriminate in what they find edible grains, seeds, nuts, cooked and
aw vegetables, seeding weeds, fruits, bread soaked in milk. When
eeding they make frequent use of the feet to support food taken up by the
*ill. I have not seen them steady food by purposely standing on it. Two
lingnecks usually--though not invariably--a mated pair, can often be
een sharing a meal held in the foot of one of the birds. Though they
pend some of the day searching and walking over the turfed floor I have
et to see them catch and eat earthworms and slugs as will some of the
Iroadtail parrots.
Voice
The contact call, " Kee-ak " (Ali, loc. cit) is given far too repetitively
^ make them ideal aviary birds and is made both when flying and at rest,
t is given most frequently when slightly disturbed, i.e. alert but not
irrified and just before roosting at night. The warning note is a
lonosyllabic " Ak Ak Ak . . ." which brings incubating hens out of the
est and all Ringnecks within hearing tighten their plumage.
Immature males can sometimes be heard softly warbling to themselves.
,dult males seem to relinquish this pretty practice for I have not heard it
nee they get a neck-ring. Adult males have a pleasant series of whistling
otes when they are courting.
Behaviour
Although Ringnecks are very sociable it is noticeable that they seldom
erch closer to one another than, say, six inches unless one of the birds is
ozing. Indeed wide awake Ringnecks do not look completely relaxed
nless a good foot of perch intervenes. They may accidentally brush
gainst one another when engrossed in feeding; but having taken a portion
food they walk or fly a little way to eat slightly apart.
I believe that all six of my Ringnecks share the same sheltered perch at
&amp;apos;ght. V hich, if it is so, must compact them a little for it is only three
et long. There is another, seemingly, suitable perch which I doubt
iey use.
There is no mutual grooming between the sexes: as part of courtship
&amp;gt;cks preen hens. I have never seen a hen preen a male although I have
en a hen preen a chick.
Females assume the highest position in the peck (social) order. Males,
id young males in particular, are low in the ranks. Fighting is excep-
Dnal because the Ringnecks accept their non-egalitarian rankings--a
tow of force being taken as the real thing.
In captivity females sometimes murder other Ringnecks. The previous
:ar, 1971, during the annual moult, one of the original hens developed
malformation of the upper beak. (Caused by the Scaley-faced mite
nemidocoptes pilae ). This odd-billed bird was suddenly attacked and
lied by the dominant hen, which is a lutino, within less than three

seconds--for I tried to intervene. All the other Ringnecks clustered
round in excitement but were, I think, not participants. In January of
this year another adult, a male, was killed with a head bite when the
Ringnecks were brought into a smallish indoor flight that they might escape
frost-bite of the feet during the only three bad days of last winter. Some
years previously I had asked a dealer to send me a Ringneck corpse--for
anatomical purposes--He sent a dozen in one parcel, eleven of which
were males, mature and immature: all bitten through the skull by other
Ringnecks sometime during their crowded air-transit from India.
A large amount of their day is spent dozing fluffed out--often with the
head twisted over onto the back--in a roosting attitude and with the eyes
almost closed. Even in cold, short, days of winter little time seems tc
be spent in eating and most of the day, except when courting, will be spenl
languidly snoozing and occasionally preening.
I have sometimes seen an odd Ringneck, of either sex, turn the head
away from myself--to hide the conspicuous red bill--when they know the)
are being watched, just as I have described for Malayan Longtails (Smith
1970). This behaviour is not general.
Water-bathing
I have not seen my Ringnecks bathe. Yet soaking-wet birds can some-
times be seen on the driest of days when the reduced level of the watei
bowl and the dripping surroundings indicate that bathing might have
taken place. Twice I have seen one of my adult hens--not part of the
colony--walking round and round the rim of her water (dog s drinking
bowl flicking her head in the water and slightly fluttering the wings
After four or five minutes she has flown away, without stepping into the
water, looking perfectly dry except for a few splashes on the head ant
flanks.

Harrison (1961) has described this for Cockatiels Nymphicus hollandicu
and for Blue-winged parrotlets Forpus passerinus. When rain starts t(
fall after a dry period Ringnecks become greatly animated, flying to-and
fro and, often, excitedly calling. Settling in exposed positions they opei
the wings and sit with them drooped loosely by their sides, the tail spreac
out, offering the maximum surface of the body to the rain and occasional^
shaking the body like a wet dog. They will hang suspended from a twij
or the roof-wire spreadeagled and then after half a minute or so fly of
to settle and rub the head and neck on wet leaves and the perch. Thei
bedraggledness is intensified because they also hang sidewards on into tb
rain soaking the flanks. A wettened Ringneck swishes the tail laterail
and flutters the wings rather like a sexually excited Broadtail. The;

<bodyText confidence="0.988153027777778" page_id="58078167"  page_num="125" year="" vol="">
I have diary notes for immature male Ringnecks showing some form of
jurtship activity over every month of the year--including June, July
id earl\ August when they are moulting. Paradoxically adult males
rely court from about early May until mid-autumn. I have been told
iat exceptional Ringnecks can breed in their first year. Year-old birds
play their sexual roles; but, in my experience, they go no further. By
e second year the majority of males are sufficiently sexually developed
breed though they will not get their neck-ring--and therefore look
ecisely like hens until they moult in late summer. Some hens lay in
eir second year. I believe that most defer breeding till they are three
ars old. The non-breeding second-year hens will have accepted a mate,
licited for copulation, investigated and slept inside a nest box, etc.
MacDonald (i960), writing of wild Ringnecks, suggests that they may
ir for life. It is noticeable with the birds in my captive colony that
ce breeding is over nothing is seemingly done between the members of
previously mated pair to " replenish " their pair-bond. There is no
Jtual preening, no feeding, no sharing of nest-box as dormitory, no
ting physically side-by-side--all of which are frequent in other parrots.
) my observation at this time of the year--summer/early autumn--the
ir-bond breaks down almost entirely and the birds seemingly become
Iividuals within the broader group. During the moult I could detect
" cohesiveness" between members of a former pair: except that when
zing they tended to be nearer one another than to other Ringnecks.
3st of the early courtship-display--post moult--seems to be directed
liscriminately towards any hen--which, because there is some " habitual
lesion , is most likely to be the previous partner. The " old "
rings are therefore not invariably re-established. As they flock in the
d and may travel some way to feed I believe that the association between
&amp;apos; two sexes would be easily broken in the wild when not breeding.
Courtship
rhe circumspect courtship, by its avoidance of close physical contact,
nonstrates the very real terror held by males towards females. The
owing descriptions are, of necessity, slightly generalised. I have tried
&amp;gt;how that breeding is determined by the time of year and by so doing
e largely ignored that, as said before, courtship by juveniles takes place
my month of the year.

Males in the late autumn can be seen to sometimes walk in a slow,
delfberate, stately way-the head held high and with blazing eyes.*
The " iris rim " exposed by Eye-blazing is white slightly veined and
streaked with blood vessels. Ringneck males also " fiddle " with the perch
near their feet and then raise the head quite high--perhaps repeating this
once or twice. Neither Bowing nor Stately-walking are protracted or
pronounced. Both take place even when no hen is visible. Bowing is
By the early winter definite pair bonds can be made out as males
increasingly " see off " their rivals. Near at hand they supplant by walking
directly up to a rival male and lunging at them with an open beak and
blazing eye. I have not seen males physically fight. The gelling out
of definite pairs seem to be formed with the males preening the hens on
the nape of their necks and the " butts " of the wings. They do not seen,
to preen elsewhere. Head-preening requires some co-operation from the
hen. Whenever a male approaches a female there is always a large amount
of Beak-wiping by the cock. Beak-wiping may diminish with increasing
confidence but it never seems to subside completely.
In " Courtship-preening " which, except for hens sometimes preening
their youngsters, is the only allo-preening observed, the male stands as
far back from the hen as he can, by stretching to his maximum extent, jus
making contact with his beak. One almost expects him to tipple ove:
(fig 2b) His wings are raised slightly away from the body ready, it seems
to surge him into instant flight if she should prove unresponsive And yet
to emphasize his boldness, he Eye-blazes. Females move little, if at all
during this. If they but flinch the cautious cocks fly off a little way an&amp;lt;
then, courage returning, start again. Even with the hen compliant
quiescent the few swift, craning, caresses with the bill are so hastil;
performed that they resemble pecking kisses. Following such a Pecking
preen the male pulls head back and raises it high with the bill tucked 1:
tight against his stretched neck. The retraction of his head is so pr*
nounced that the leg nearest to her is lifted high in the air: perhaps enablin
the body to move back just that little further (fig. 2a). A momentar
pause and then the head shoots forwards, preceded by a few shuddenn
taps of the uplifted foot on the perch, or in the air, to preen the hen one
more.
Every so often some relief to his seeming tension is given by his takin
one or two retreating steps backwards, wiping or tapping his bill on tfc
intervening perch. (Bill-wiping in Ringnecks is partly stylised to becon
perch-tapping). Then he will step forwards to continue his Pecking
preens.
\0x2666Eye-blazing means that the pupil is constricted to a pin-point by
the iris to its maximum extent bringing the outermost edge of the ms-- norma
concealed by the eyelids and sclera--into view. The outer part ofthem
often brighter than the usually seen inner portion. Eye-blazing is a com
threat-behaviour in many, many parrots.

&amp;apos;reening ultimately leads to, and is interspersed with, bouts of courtship
mg. This, generally, starts out in very late autumn and early winter,
is flatten themselves further onto the perch than when they have been
king-preened. The hen pulls her head well into the body and twists
\0x25A0 one side. Regurgitatory Head-bobbing, that is vomiting up food from
crop by the male jerking his head up and down, is not obvious,
vever, following this Bill-knocking/Bill-wiping and raising of his head,
just preceding making contact with the two beaks, there is a momen-
pause, a slight, almost imperceptible halt. During this fractional
&amp;apos; a slight puff of the throat, a slight crick of the neck is seen, as the food
rought up into his bill. The male's head has to twist slightly as he
s his offering to the twisted head of the hen. (Bill approach is head-
ed not as described for Caiques and Conures (Smith, 1971) where the
5 physically seems to clasp onto the top of the female's bill at right
es.) The springing back of the head and the foot-raising--" Saluting "
e also part of courtship-feeding. This pull back of the head looks
ost as lf the tw o heads were connected by a stretching elastic band,
relatively slow pull back of the head, with the Saluting, and then the
ien, snake-like, dart forward as the imaginary stretched elastic con-
ts the heads together.

Irf afew more weeks--early and mid-winter, the female puts her hoc
absolutely flat on the perch, back horizontal, and the wings slightly aw;
from the body. The male by this point is moving closer when preenn
and feeding--and he seems to preen more than he feeds. The hen st
keeps her head screwed up close to the body with the head askew.
Copulation
After a while the male attempts to stand on her back but this takes mai
fits and starts. For as he mounts the female he soon steps off. Eve
tually, and by many " practice " attempts, he preens the hen's nape rath
brusquely. Then, as she cowers the body submissively they are nc
standing absolutely adjacent, bodies touching--he gingerly steps a fo
on her back and stands on with both feet. The male has drooped win
and Eye-blazes. Preening becomes ritualised into a " hammering

back of the hen (Fig. 3b) just as if he were trying to knock a nail through t

Hammering is a very rhythmical tattoo and the rate gradually mcreas

My boxes are hung on a slope, the horizontal bottom of the box is

The newly-hatched chicks (fig. 5) seem bare: close observation shows

normal chicks that I killed and subsequently sexed. Also by the light-
green chick, which is a female, for this character is a sex-linked " factor "
in Ringnecks. If my inference is correct then a male chick is half as
heavy again--for the same age--as a hen chick for the first three weeks of
life. If conditions are adverse for growing--shortage of food, chilling due
to absence of parents while foraging, then the bigger chicks--male chicks--
would be less likely to die than the smaller, for the same age, female
chicks. If there is this differential growth of the two sexes it may help in
explaining why it is that male Ringnecks (and other Psittacula parrakeets)
seem always to be more common than hens--even when captured as
immatures--and therefore are unsexable.
When the chicks are five days old many grey dots can be made oul
under the skin of the back. These are the developing down-follicles, foi
a fluffy down soon grows on the back, irrupting before the true feathers
form as " pins ".
When the chicks reached ten days old the parent hens spent some time
away from the box feeding. Before this they barely left them. At ter
days the chicks were about three times the hatching weight and the eyes
just opening. The biggest chick was rung when eleven days old (siz&amp;lt;
B12 ring). Its " sisters " were not large enough until they were fourteei
days old. Chicks grow rapidly in weight largely from the accumulatior
of fat. The feathers over the shoulder-blades began to emerge from th&amp;lt;
pins when four weeks old. The maximum weight is reached when si:
weeks old and until they fledge at eight weeks they gradually lose some o
this surplus weight of fat.
The bills are red--after a straw-coloured start--and the juvenile bea;
has the same outline of the adults. (Broadtails and the Australian Red
billed parrots " have an arrow-shaped tip to the bill, (see Cooper, 1968)).
The nest boxes remained dry despite the rather moist faeces. N
attempt was made to scratch out the accumulated litter. Both cock an 1
hen fed the babies. The male usually fed the hen outside the box and the
would fly to the next-hole, enter and feed the chicks, often immediatel
followed by the hen. The hen brooded the chicks each night till they lei
the box. From ten days of hatching the amount of day-time broodin
became less and less, so that by three weeks she barely brooded them at al
The alarm set up by their mother whenever I fed the parents caused tb
babies to " buzz " away in the box. Handling the chicks caused them t
make a harsher, further-carrying sound.
They were six weeks old before I caught them peering out of the ne.
hole and the first chick left home when two days short of being eigl
weeks old.
The other Ringnecks were greatly excited by its emergence and wante
to attack it. The parents successfully drove them off; but it took almo

I did not like housing such a large species in a cage and I had my doat

the Coronet commenced moulting on 30th July and finished 2 5 I

Viththe extra freedom of the flight, I did not have to wait long before
tessing the true display of this species. In fact, within a week of

The male Chestnut-breasted Coronet is also very beautiful. It has

difficulty in sitting upright at such times and always appear to

Vhen one of us (MFW) was in Costa Rica for a summer, a common
stion from non-ornithological colleagues was " Why are tropical birds
-e colorful than those in the U.S.? " The present exercise was
iu ated by that question, since it was not clear that tropical birds are
e colorful, much less why.
fe have attempted to classify the avifauna of South America North
erica and Europe into categories of " colorful " or " not so " 'but we
.red degrees of colorfulness. Criteria for the division are necessarily
ective, but we tried to be consistent in their application. If the
nage of a species was described as having fairly large patches of bright
)W, orange, red blue, purple or green, or any combination thereof, it
called colorful For example, the Pileated and Red-headed
idpeckers of North America were called colorful because of the amount
1 on the head of at least one sex, but Downy and Red-bellied Wood-
ers were not. Although some people would undoubtedly categorize
les by somewhat different means, we feel that the consistency of our
e validates the approach. Decisions about colorfulness were based
lescriptions and pictures in three sources: Meyer de Schauensee
a), Robbins, et al. (1966), and Petersen, et al. (1966). Some species
could be considered striking, flashy, and conspicuous (such as
rican magpies) were not, however, called " colorful ", for their

Birds of the South American lowland tropics are therefore I y 10re fr
quently colorful than those of North America or the South Amend
nontropics; a consideration of degree of colorfulness or combinations
color would have emphasized the difference. European birds j
relatively dull in color. Colorfulness is not particularly W&amp;apos; at &amp;apos; d "
tendency toward dichromatism, for North American and South Amenc.
tropical^birds have a higher proportion of sexually dichromatic forms th
the others; Europe and the South American nontropical avifaunas
toward sexual monomorphism. . j i r i
In almost all cases the incidence of sexual dichromatism and colorfulnj
in open habitats is similar to their incidence in the entire regional a *
fauna. An exception is found in the South American nontropics, whi.
colorfulness in open habitats is significantly ( X \ P &amp;lt; */*5) l ess fr ^&amp;lt;
than in the whole avifauna. Given that a species lives in an open habit
then, it usually has the same probability of being colorful as any spec.
taken from that avifauna. , , , _ V11/ L
Although in all four regions the percentage of colorful and sexu,
dichromatic species that live in the "open" habitats is markedly
than the per cent that live in wooded habitats, the relative number
species living in the open is also less than that of wooded areas Neit
kind of habitat, then, is relatively more conducive to the development
dichromatism or colorfulness. . , Li
Certain families clearly contain relatively more dichromatic or colop
species than other families. In addition, for each region, certain farm-
are the largest contributors of species to the dichromatic and colo
portions of the avifauna. However, seldom is an entire fami y ic *
matic or colorful, which argues to some extent against genetic fixatio
such a trait within a phylogenetic lineage, in most cases.

atoriness, and, for some, habitat. For comparisons of regional avi-
Linas, however, the explanations do not seem to be general ones. For
stance, dichromatism (seasonal and permanent) is least developed in the
iropean and South American nontropical avifaunas, but we expect that
ig distance migration or wandering is probably more common there than
the South American lowland tropics.
Perhaps a general explanation is unavailable. Hamilton and Barth
!&amp;gt;. cit.) list several kinds of selective factors that influence the evolution
species-specific plumage patterns. These, and perhaps others, prob-
ly vary in their importance among species. Colorfulness is equally
ficult to assess, especially in view of our ignorance of the possible
fptic nature of bright plumages amidst brightly colored flowers, fruits
d leaves, and of our lack of information concerning relative predation
:es.
mmary
Tropical birds of South America are more frequently colorful than those
North America or nontropical areas of South America; European birds
' the least colorful of all. Assessment of degree of colorfulness or color
nbinations would likely increase most of these differences. Sexual
hromatism is most common among members of the North American
i South American tropical avifauna, and least in Europe and the South
lerican nontropics. Habitat association of these characters are not
lerally evident, and taxonomic associations not very helpful. At this
le we seem to lack a general explanation for the evolution of the
served tendencies.

After waiting for years, we finally succeeded in breeding a Trumpete
Swan (Cygnus c. buccinator ), the first on the European continent. Durin,
the time of the settlers in America, towards the end of the 19th centurj
this species, the largest swan of the world, hitherto widespread, was sooi
threatened with extinction. Strict precautions were taken to save thi
species, but the birds are still rare in America (about 2100). So we ar
extremely pleased with our success and do hope it will now be repeater
every year.
Also very rare (as was mentioned in an earlier report) are the riawana
Geese ( Branta sandvicensis ). After our first pleasant success in breedin
two young of this species last year, we are now able to report the fin
number of six.
In our valuable crane collection, the White-necked Cranes (Grus vipu
laid eggs every year. So far they had been sterile, but this spring
young one was hatched in the incubator and hand-reared.
Interesting newcomers are three Striped Owls ( Rhinoptyx clamatoi
from the Gran Chaco in South America. These prettily coloured ow
are not only seldom exhibited in zoological gardens, but also belong to th
ornithological rarities in their native country. Their preferred habit;
is grassland and open forests. Contrary to most owl species which ne:
in the trees, the Striped Owl sits on the ground among thick bunches (;
grass. On light sandy ground among dead halms their striped-ochi
plumage is a perfect camouflage against animals or birds of prey.

Marauders descended from escapees from mink farms are becoming

Our member R. W. Goodwin of Cheltenham has got together dur.n,
the last few years a comparatively small but very select collection of rad
Parrakeets accommodated in a range of practical well constructed
attractively laid-out aviaries. The collection includes such rarities a
Salawati and Australian King Parrots, and Crimson-winged, Cloncurr;
and Blue-cheeked Rosella Parrakeets. In 1971 the following parrakeet
were reared successfully: 5 Cloncurries, 4 Pileated, 4 Rock PepHrs i
Barnard, 6 Pennants, 4 Stanleys, 4 Barrabands and numerous Whit
Cockatiels.

Len Hill is an ardent conservationist and his main objective is to keep

acaws have bred consistently in the Gardens and it is hoped that some
their offspring will ultimately be responsible for the restocking of the
tive habitat where they appear now to be extinct. Other breeding suc-
sses in 1971 include one Purple-naped Lory, three Senegal Parrots,
ir Rothschild's Grackles, four Bleeding-heart Pigeons and five Bearded
ts. Swift Parrakeets were hatched but not reared. The Gardens are
nstantly being improved and, after the opening in May of a Wild Life
t Gallery, the next development will be the reconstruction of the old
opical House near the main entrance to provide ideal accommodation

ILDFOWL IN CAPTIVITY. By Richard Mark Martin. London:
John Gifford, 1972. Price #1.75.
Waterfowl keeping and breeding is becoming increasingly popular, and
0 more and more useful, for it no doubt constitutes at present the best
y of saving numerous species threatened with extinction owing to
man persecution and habitat destruction.
rhe present work is the latest published book on the practical treatment
wildfowl in captivity, and it is an unusually satisfactory one. Without
v pretence to be a scientific monograph, it certainly achieves its object--
give beginners all the information and advice which they require.

At the beginning of January 1972 we placed the Brewer s Blackbirds r|
a glass compartment of 2 m. x 1.8 m. x 1.2 m. and by the end of Januar
the bird keeper noticed that nesting material was being carried aboui
We therefore provided an old Blackbird's nest as a foundation and 0
12th February the female carried dry blades of grass and Scotch Pin
needles (Pirns silvestris) and built actively in the old Blackbird s nes
One day later an egg was laid and by 18th February a clutch of six egg
was completed. . . ,. ur:n:,,
This early start to breed was very surprising as, according to Wiihair
(10C2) breeding does not start till the middle of April.
The female again undertook all the brooding. On 29th February tv
young hatched and on 1st March there were four young m the nes
The fifth young did not hatch till 2nd March and the sixth egg disappear*
As the female began to brood immediately after laying the fifth egg c
17th February the young therefore hatched after an incubation period
12-13 days, as has already been noted by Williams.
The adult birds are rather shy and only on a few occasions could

food with dried ant eggs, hardboiled eggs and curds were certainly ea &amp;lt;;

be ascertained. The young birds are covered in smoky-brown down ai
the eyes opened in 6-7 days. ,
One young bird was missing on the third day and on 10th March
youngster was found dead in the nest, but the other three grew well.
14 days of age the young were fully feathered and similar in colour to t:
female, though there was still some down on the head and the tail was 1
full grown. In 16 days the young left the nest (according to Williams tl/
fly at 14 days) and at once ran around sturdily on the aviary floor,
young were still fed by the parents though even after a few days of leav^
the nest they were observed to be feeding on their own. At the age
five weeks the young birds began to moult their small feathers and in #
ma l es --there are two males and one female--the first black feathers w#

With the exception of Quaker Conures Myiopsitta monachus , parrots
y their eggs m sheltered cavities--most species select holes in trees
lthough a parrot's bill is excellent for whittling and tearing off portions
L wood lt 1S not such a good tool to excavate the whole of the chamber
id most species make use of pre-existing holes.
In the wild competition for suitable nest-cavities must be intense and
veral species avoid disputation with other hole-nesters by boring into
rmitaria which, once the crust is perforated, excavate easily. Keas
estor notabihs nest in small natural caves (Jackson 1963) and Patagonian
onures Cyanoliseus patagonus breed in colonies in tunnels excavated bv
emselves in near-vertical cliff-faces (Johnson 1967).
In captivity parrots are generally provided with wooden nest-boxes
few ingenious aviculturists have supplied artificial &quot; white-ant nests "

these insects, e.g. Perry (1959) tells how Red-faced Lovebirds

nerican conures Hardy (1963) and Power (1967) used coated polystyrene
isses and then, when they were found unsuitable, blocks of cork,

oxygen--together with desiccation--is given as the main cause of los
with " dead-in-shell " in incubated chicken eggs (Allcroft 1964, Carte
&amp; Freeman 1969). Decaying vegetable composts could well produc
such " noxious gases " and no matter how damp when put inside the bo&amp;apos;
all litter dries, unless especially thick, before incubation is completed-- an
high humidity is especially needed about hatching time. L. P. Luk
(1952) designed a nest-box, for Lovebirds, which had a dish of wate
inserted beneath the nest pan.
Eggs of different species of birds must vary in their resistance t
desiccation: waterfowl eggs have very poor hatchability in mcubatoi
designed for poultry--unless liberally sprinkled with water. An
pigeons' eggs aerially suspended as they are in the flimsiest of nests, &amp;lt;
Ostrich eggs laid in desert sand, must be quite resistant to drying. Hoi.&amp;apos;
in trees are often dry--certainly those selected by indigenous birds- 1
sometimes tinder dry. The holes that are available to wild parrots migj
also often be absolutely clean of rotten wood: either because they we
bored in a living tree by barbets and woodpeckers, or by having bee
scoured out by termites. Nesting holes are more likely in the middle
trees --where the bole and thick branches are--which is generally d
as rain is cascaded outwards by the umbrella of foliage.
All the species of parrot that Eve bred seem especially concerned
remove as much of the loose litter as they can by digging with the be
and scratching backwards with the feet. Larger items are carried out j

In an attempt to see if vegetable matter is necessary I have experimented
er the past three breeding seasons, with various nest-box " fillers
Dupled with these experiments I have also built some rather curiouslv
aped boxes to see if I could assess the value of such variables as: size
entrance hole, depth of box, ease of descent down to the nest depression
or area, and the darkness of the chamber. Because any " standard "
control with which to compare my results is lacking the observations
at shall make are offered as nothing more substantial than my (present)
I can say, with absolute truth, that I have yet to have a chick " dead in
&quot;1 in *^ tslde boxes when the eggs have been laid on bare wood or
a layer of chippings pared off by the parents. This is with such varied
;cies as Red and Yellow-fronted New-Zealand Parrakeets C. novaese-
diae and C. aunceps , Indian Ringnecked Parrakeets, Malayan Long-
led Parrakeets Psittacula krameri and P. longicaudata , Cockatiels
iny-coloured and Red-rump Parrakeets Psephotus varius and P.
matonotus. This was not the case when I used to fill with rotten
od, turves and/or damp peat.
Vly parrots are given ample bathing facilities and the incubating hens
d incubating cocks as well with Cockatiels) often bathe and they will
arn to the eggs in a soaking condition. If they sit on dry peat (is there
&amp;apos; substance less liable to take up water than bone-dry peat?) or dry
ipost the nest-box " filler " always dries on the top--the water in the
i s plumage can hardly affect the litter. Sitting on wood the whole
i in contact gets wet.
ndoors the situation is different, my Blackheaded Caiques Pionites
anocephala have had, from four clutches of three eggs, but a single
:k hatch each time--the rest being dead in shell. The fifth clutch
, a teaspoonful of water (5 ml.) put into the nest once a week and two
he four eggs hatched. The sixth and present clutch of three eggs was
ered more generously with half a cup of tepid water once a week--the
&amp;apos; easily absorbs this quantity for it is more than an inch deep with wood
ngs and moulted feathers--all three have hatched and at six weeks old
: like being reared. This particular Caique hen does not often bathe
ostial Parrotlets in the same shed hatched all their fertile eggs (four
of eight) with no " irrigation " except for two separate, and rather
it, sprinklings of the outside of their box with water. Celestial
otlets I believe, do not bathe in standing water. When my chicks

-pan) and if the parents have not supplied enough splinters I put an
sional sprinkle of sawdust to absorb the faeces,

the amount of moisture fed by the parents-or the hand-rearer. Thj
" powdering " does not seem to be other than dehydration of faece
voided in a warm environment. I have noticed with parrot chick
that they deposit their " movements " away from the nest hollow b|
backing outwards--from an early age. This habit allows the faeces t
dry before they get carried back on feet, or enveloped by the expandin
size of the growing chicks. c .
Parrots can be rather dull subjects when nesting, for many ot th
interesting things are taking place inside the box. It is often said thi
disturbance will bring about desertion. I suppose that it might; but
have never experienced it with my own, much interfered with stocJ
Indeed I have found that my frequent examination has often helped 1
avoid catastrophe by detecting ailing or dead chicks, etc. Most peop:
hang boxes inside the flight. When these are examined it does crea
considerable disturbance. I overcome this by clamping mine to tl
outside--the birds enter through a hole cut in the wire where it passes ov
the entrance hole. Examination is easy and quick; the difficulty I find
getting the hens off the nest--I prefer to wait till the female is in ti
flight, or shelter, before taking a peek. Some hens need shooing ol
others refuse to budge and eggs or chicks have to be seen when t.
incubating hen attacks or moves away flightly from the examining han
Chicks in vertical-sided and deep boxes--even when these are fitt
with a good " ladder " or wire mesh--sometimes die with ruptured live
damaged by the parents dropping the last few inches of their descent or.&amp;apos;
the backs of the chicks. With my Cockatiels the mortality, from ruptur.
livers, was extremely high (50% of five clutches) using boxes with r.
nest floor more than 18 in. from the entrance hole. Chicks move aw
from the light once the eyes open and the parents also lay in the dark!
part of the chamber. In short boxes this would mean that clutches 4
generally not immediately under the hole, whereas in tall boxes this a:i
is dark enough for nesting. Because of this danger all my boxes are n?
hung on the slope. The " ladder " which allows the parrot to climb fr"
the hole to the bottom of the box is important, e.g. staples, part knocli
in, to form two parallel rows (similar to the illustration in Groen 19)
proved impossible for Cockatiels--they are not particularly good climbfjj
Wire mesh is certainly the best " ladder " for vertical boxes. With 5
sloping boxes the " descending " side has cross spars of branch segme-S
or soft timber as steps.
It is difficult to prove but I do believe that parrots nest more readily
cramped rather than spacious boxes. Hardy (1963 p. 188) writes njj
species of bird that dig their own nest cavities make them barely la?
enough to accommodate only one adult and the eggs or young. *1
certainly the case in some parrots, such as Amazona finschii. Tb&amp;lt;
cavities are occasionally so small that it is difficult to believe that an a&amp;lt;
bird could incubate the eggs or brood the young therein ". Seva

esting accounts in the literature show parrots--given a choice--selecting
small box. e.g. David West writes (1957) of Pileated parrakeets
&amp;apos;urpureicephalus spurius that " instead of taking one of the two large
oxes especially hung for them at the rear of the aviary the hen chose the
est-box intended for the pair of Tourquoisines. This was not
large box, being about 12 inches high, eight inches deep,
id six inches wide The most successful breeder of Grass-parrakeets
nown to myself--the late Mr. W. Drake of Eye, Peterborough--used
\0x25A1xes only three or four inches square at the base. I built an experimental
ox so that rain could percolate through at the base so the mould on the
ottom, taken from a decaying willow, was always moist and sometimes
-ry wet. Amazingly the parent Cockatiels did not desert and five
licks were reared. They all had such swollen tarsal joints that the
corns " constricted the leg beneath the closed rings and the rings had
\0x25BA be cut away. These were also the smallest Cockatiels bred that year,
fith waterproof boxes I have not found chicks to have bad feet. Handfuls
: wood-shavings, recommended by some American breeders, seem to
day nesting until they are removed or have been chewed down into
nailer pieces. I now use nothing but bare, wooden " concaves "
ich as are used by Budgerigar breeders.
Conures-- Aratinga, " Nandayus ", " Leptositta ", Rhynchopsitta ,
yanoliseus , " Ognorhynchus '\Pyrrhura, " Microsittace ", " Enicognathus "
lyiopsitta, many of the Macaws-- Ay a and Anodorhynchus --and
aiques use the nest-box as a dormitory, by both sexes, even when not
\0x25A0eeding. These birds enter boxes readily--often within minutes of
itting boxes up. Roosting " Conures "--see above list--avoid any
fling of the nest by retaining faeces over the night. However the
merican parrakeets--" Amoropsitta ", Bolborhynchus , Brotogeris , and
\0x25A0obably " Psilopsiagon " and " Nannopsittaca " are less inclined to
&amp;gt;ost in a nest-box. It often takes many weeks before they dare to enter
id when they do sleep within, unless incubating, they stay in the entrance
Ld are not " continent " so they foul the entrance. Parrotlets Forpus
obably are the same (my observation of these is rather equivocal--they
) not roost in a box unless about to breed; but they seem always to be
house-trained "). All the other American parrots use the box solely
r breeding purposes, e.g. Amazona, Pionus , Pionopsitta. In the Old-world
me of the Red-billed group--Lovebirds and Psittacula parrots of both
xes--may use the nest as a dormitory. With most Red-billed parrots
id New Zealand parrakeets it is the hens that sleep in the box when not
eeding, as may odd Rosellas Platycercus spp.. Lories sleep in pairs in
e box whether breeding or not. When nest-selecting or building
ew-world parrots seem to engage one sex as much as another. In
sd-billed parrots the hen seems to do all of the work. In Broadtails the
ale does nothing to the nest but seems to prefer to indicate the site,
^ckatoos have nesting as a joint venture.

All parrots lay white eggs. They are small for the size of the bird.
From my own measurements most eggs weigh so propoitionately little
that it takes 12-15 to add up to the weight of the laying hen. They vary
somewhat in shape, even in parrots of the same species generally they
are "oblong" rather than "egg-shaped". The average size of the
clutch varies from: one, two, three--up to seven, eight or nine, and k
roughly the same for each species. There seems to be a definite relation-
ship between the protein availability of the wild diet and the genetic size
of the clutch: Lories and Lorikeets (Loriinae) utilise pollen from flowers
as their major source of protein. Pollen granules have walls that an
most resistant to digestion and only a small proportion of this theoreticalh
r i c h_source of protein can be extracted by the gut. The Cockatoo:
that obtain much of their food from trees--as berries or nuts lay on&amp;lt;
eg g--Palm Cockatoos, Black Cockatoos. Gang-gang Callocephaloi
fimbriatum and the white island Cockatoos also lay smallish clutches
Whereas those Australian cockatoos that feed from the ground and whos&amp;lt;
breeding seems to be governed by the massive build-up of grains ant
vegetable storage-organs--rhizomes, bulbs, corms, and tubers followinj
irregular rainy periods, lay large clutches of three to five eggs.
A case for a relationship between the genetic determination of clutcl
size being connected with food source is demonstrated by the Broadtail
(Platycercinae). Swift parrakeets Lathamus discolor , depend largely on th
same flower-garnered diet as Lorikeets--supplemented with insect
(Forshaw 1969 )-- have three, four or rarely five eggs. New-Zealan
parrakeets have the most versatile feeding behaviour of the sub-family-
they have extended their omnivorous diet because they can scratch wit
the feet like a domestic hen and turn over soil and vegetation. Man
potential-breeding females of other genera, e.g. African Greys Psittaa
erythacus and Asiatic Ringnecks Psittacula spp. scratch floor litter. Thi
is never done by males and is exclusive to females only in the breedin
season--though Holyoak (1972) suggests that this may not be seasonal-
New-Zealand parrakeets have emancipated this behaviour--which is th:
adopted by females cleaning out nest cavities--from being exclusive t
nesting females for both sexes foot-scratch the litter.
In captivity an increase in the richness of the food supplied seen
capable of increasing slightly the general clutch size. Lories and Lorikec
usually lay two eggs. Ken Russell (1971), when writing about his (fir.
reported) breeding of Perfect Lorikeets Tnchoglossus euteles remarke
that the clutch of three eggs seemed to be unique in the avicultur
records. Though not reported this may not be so uncommon for capth
Trichoglossi. Mr. Ray Kyme has once had a clutch of three with h
Weber's ( Pers. com.) and Mr. A. Marques ( Pers. com.) found that thr&amp;lt;

id three eggs with their second clutch (pers. com.). Animal protein-
ilk--may be partially responsible for these large clutches.
Parrots aie determinate layers ", i.e. egg laying is not continued
:yond the regular clutch size if they are removed as laid. However
We noted with my own parrots that when a hen starts to incubate with
e first or second egg then the clutch is small to average in size. However
ken delayed until several eggs have been laid then the clutch is often
rger than average. Not uncommonly captive parrots lay abnormally
rge clutches far too large for the hen to cover--often no attempt is
ade to brood and the process sometimes kills the hen.
Generally eggs are laid at two day intervals--plus or minus a few hours.
&amp;gt;rshaw (1969) says that Bourke's grass-parrakeet Neophema bourkei
j on consecutive days. This is not so for " European " Bourkes and
r. Alan Lendon (in cot.) says that, in his experience, captive ' 4 Australian "
)urke s lay on alternate days. If food is suddenly reduced in quantity
srsonal observation of captive birds) an expected egg may not be
ilised; if the food is then increased or restored egg laying is often
mmed. My surviving Black-headed Caique hen lays on alternate
ys in the summer and every three days in the winter.
cubation
In order that I might more accurately determine the length of incubation
which I take to be the shortest interval between laying and hatching_
nark all eggs as laid with an indelible felt-tipped pen. Sometimes it
not possible to mark eggs in sequence, when this is so all non-marked
? s are given the same number. Weighing of eggs and chicks is done
th a "Pesola" spring balance). Incubation almost invariably starts
fore completion of the clutch so that sequential hatching takes place.
Incubation is exclusive to the hen except for most Cockatoos (which,
course, includes the Cockatiel), where the male, pigeonwise, takes over
"st of the daytime incubation. Male Black Cockatoos of the genus
lyptorhynchus are said not to incubate (see Forshaw 1969). This is
: invariable Mr. G. S. Mottershed, of Chester Zoo, tells me that his
;eding pair of Yellow-tailed Black Cockatoos C. f. funereus share duties
ictly as other Cockatoos. It is my impression that further observation
1 show that shared incubation is the rule with all Cockatoos.
Before laying most parrot hens spend much time in the box brooding
removing powdery litter and trying to line the cavity with splinters of
od. Some hens seem unable to lay yet go quite broody and they will
dopt " eggs and hatch them successfully.

ncubation varies from 17 days in For pus parrotlets. Budgerigars

generally left in the nest cavity where they break down with the movement,
of the birds. Some Cockatiels carry shells out of the nest to drop then
some way off. I have not noticed this with other parrots. Whei
hatched chicks are extremely helpless. Most are clothed with down ye
some of the Red-billed parrots are practically naked: Eclectus chick
have short 1--2 mm. thick, orange-yellow bristles and Indian Ring-neck,
(Smith 1972) are also " bald ". It is said by Marchant (i960) tha
Forpus parrotlet chicks are naked--they are not. The sparse down tha
covers them at birth gets somewhat abraded as they grow and by a wee
some may be almost bald. Budgerigar chicks are downed in the egg bu
hatch naked (Smith 1972). Some chicks are exceptionally woolly-
Kakas and Keas Nestor meridionalis and notabilis are very thickly downec
New-Zealand parrakeets also have rather thick down for Broadtails.
Colour of down differs and is, I think, yellow in all Cockatoos and whit
or pale grey in the New World parrots. The eyes of young parrots ai
sealed for the first week or more of life. Like puppies, or kittens the eai
of New World parrots are sealed-off when hatched, the Old Worl
parrots have open earholes at hatching. Mr. Thomas Brossett, of Swedei
at my request for some information kindly forwarded some excellei
photographs of the head of a week-old parrotlet chick and he notes in tf
accompanying letter that though they have sealed ears the Senegal parre
Poicephalus senegalensis chicks that he bred and photographed had ope
ears--as do all the other chicks he has inspected. The earhole opei
after the eyes--say at a fortnight to three weeks old--for most Americ:
parrots. .
Another unique and seldom mentioned fact is that most Neotropic
parrots have a padded swelling on the upper and lower bill (Smith 1971
This is barely perceptable in Forpus parrotlets on hatching and later
merely indicated by the bill being just slightly wider than any Old Wor
parrot. Born as they are in the near or absolute dark parrot chicks ha
pale yellow or white bills and all seem (except for Forpus parrotlets--whe
it may be at too high a wave-length to be audible) to utter a tiny, thin nc
when disturbed by movement. Chick sounds seem to be made wi
expiration only--birds, as anyone knows who has listened to the incessa
song of canaries, can make noises both when inhaling and exhaling,
believe that in the absolute or near-darkness of its nest chicks are fed
the parents " homing " to this peeping noise. The adult bird when
moves would cause the chick to call out. This causes the parent to ta:
its bill into her own. A slight pressure on the side of a chick's bill star)
it head jerking which makes the parent to regurgitate.
To assist in this feeding certain developments have taken place. Firs
the nape of the chick's neck is enormously muscled and is quite the larg&amp;apos;j
visible muscle on hatching. Young parrot chicks are often said to be f
on " crop milk " like a pigeon squab. A chick's bill (or come to tha;

id looks extremely " pigeon-wise but the food fed is not crop-milk,
&amp;apos;hey are fed on part digested, part softened, food direct from the parent's
:op and which probably includes secretions from the enlarged pro-
mtriculus--first stomach--of the hen (T. G. Taylor not published).
- very good description of an African Grey feeding a fostered Amazon
^ane 1957) explains that very young chicks seem to get more " gravy "
lan solid food. However post-mortem examination--and looking at the
intents of the transparent crops of baby parrots--convince me that the
irgest part of the diet is regurgitated crop-softened food. There is a
eed for grit--to enable the chick's gizzard to function correctly. If the
irgest visible muscle is that of the neck, the largest absolute muscle is
lat forming the gizzard of the infant which is about 5% of its total body
eight. At about the time that the chicks start to hatch male parrots may
e seen searching the ground for grit though at other times--especially
ith arboreal parrots--they may never have been previously seen on the
oor. The male, except for Cockatoos, does not feed the chicks directly
&amp;gt;r several days then he feeds the hen and then she feeds the chicks. Often
;eds or foods are taken that at other times are ignored such as millet
iray and bread and milk. Mortality is high in young chicks at the point
f hatching and again when the hen ceases to brood and goes foraging
ith the male for food.
As the interval between successive eggs is usually two days, and
lcubation generally starts before completion of the clutch a considerable
ifference in size and development often exists between the eldest and
oungest chicks. The eldest may be half-grown in weight, with open,
ieing eyes capable of maintaining body heat, thickly covered with
^routing feathers and able to run up to the parents, as they enter the box,
) solicit feeding. Sharing the nest--and available food--will be graduations
f younger chicks of which the last hatched is blind and completely
elpless and submerged completely under its larger brothers and sisters,
et when food is sufficient losses are not too frequent.
There is a quite noticeable difference in voice-tone between the different
^es of chicks. It is possible that the noise made by the very youngest
hicks has more " allure " than that of the eldest. Unless there was some
ich system it is hard to understand how the parents can cope with such
variety of different-sized babies. Parrot-chicks lie with the heads
iterlocking so that if one is fed it must stimulate all the adjacent chicks--*
erhaps this also helps even distribution of meals.
Two sorts of growth patterns are seen in parrots. The first--seen in
udgerigars, Cockatiels and Broadtails is for a continual, though gradually
ipering, increase of weight until they fledge--when the chick weighs
ss than the parents. The second is for a rapid increase in growth--
uring which the chick may come to weigh more than the parents--
)llowed by a long period of stationary weight as the feathers grow then
loss of weight just before they leave the box. This is seen in all the

G. A. SMITH--NESTING AND NESTLING PARROTS
American parrots that I have examined. Poor feeding delays fledging,
e.g. Cockatiels usually leave the nest when about five weeks old. If the
parents are poor feeders they may delay until a week older and if the
parents are good feeders they may fledge when four weeks old. Once they
leave the nest some parrots seem almost independent of the parents,
or can survive by feeding themselves; e.g. parrotlets, Broadtails, Lovebirds,
African Greys. Whereas some, such as Cockatoos, seem dependent on
the parents for very long periods. Caiques when fledged beg and when
being fed flap wings like baby sparrows. Young Cockatiels head-bobj
when pleading to be fed.
After fledging some chicks return back to the box to sleep Ringnecks,
Conures. Broadtails may for a day or so and then relinquish the habit.
Forpus parrotlets are said to be intolerant of their offspring once they
leave the box and are supposed to kill them mine don t. Broadtails!
soon become intolerant of their young. Red-bills and South American
parrots seem to form happy contented family parties.

By J. O. D'eath, (Monken Hadley, Herts, England)
When the waterfowl collection here was re-established in 1946 on the
ssation of World War II it was my intention to extend same to include
e family Gruidae. However, owing to the limiting factors of space,
is original intention was unable to be fulfilled and only the following
ecies could be kept:-
imoiselle (Anthropoides virgo ), Stanley (A. paradisea ), West African
owned (Balearica pavonina), and East African Crowned ( B . begulorum).
the space of 20 years or so casualties occurred but were always replaced
that true pairs were maintained.
In 1967, when my friend and fellow member of the Avicultural Society
&amp;gt;m Spence moved to Australia to take up the Directorship of the Perth
J .A.) Zoo, he generously gave me an adult female Stanley Crane. This
d was very " fixated " but in spite of this I decided to endeavour to
ir it. Accordingly after it had been with me for a year, I purchased in
:tober 1968 a very fine wild-caught male from a Continental dealer.
This bird was placed in an adjoining pen to the female and the birds
re familiar with each other for a period of six months. In the Spring
1969 they were put together in a pen measuring 45 m. x 20 m. which
o contained a small natural pond. The female tended to be aggresive
the male, which was of shyer disposition anyhow.
Both birds were only lightly feather-clipped on both wings and not
rmanently pinioned (this was intentional).
Displaying and " dancing " was noted from time to time from May
wards.
[ will now turn to the sequence of events that led to the successful
:eding of this species, the subject of these notes. In 1970 eggs were
i on the following dates :-
16th May 29th May 1st June
25th June 29th June 8th July
.t will be seen that a total of eight eggs were laid,
loved and incubated under hens with the greatest care but all proved
ar. On two occasions a goose egg was substituted but within minutes
female Stanley had eaten it. An egg painted to a fair representation
the original egg was also given the same treatment. The female on
&amp;gt;ther occasion was allowed to incubate the sixth of her own eggs which
did for a week, the male bird sharing duty with her. Unfortunately,
female lays against the wire netting adjoining the path round the main
:erfowl collection and whilst disturbance is minimal, they are by

The egg is elongated and heavily mottled with dark brown streaks anc
blotches on a huffish brown background and weighs 190 gms. Measure-
ments varied slightly, but the average taken over twelve eggs indicates :
mean of 95-0x59-9 mm. Roberts in " Birds of S. Africa quote-
qr o x 59-9 as an average taken from 60 eggs. The shell is very hard bu
I will comment on this under Hatching and Rearing. If one refers to tb
two laying tables given above, one will note that it is difficult to extrac
anv definite pattern. One has always been given to understand tha
Cranes in the wild state lay only two eggs, but in 1970 it will be note,
that eggs were laid on 22nd, 25th, 29th June respectively approximatel
at three-day intervals. There is really no definite evidence from m
own limited experience to establish any regular laying pattern and captiv
conditions therefore probably cannot be compared with the wild.
I have one added note of interest in my record to the effect that 0
27th June 1971 I was fortunate enough to actually witness, at clos
quarters, the female Stanley laying. At 3.30 p.m. the bird was at tb
nesting site and I was actually stroking her head when she emitted a lou
&amp;gt; purring ' sound and slowly lowered herself to the ground, whereupon tl
egg was laid in about 30 secs. I immediately lifted the egg and the bu
showed no aggression.

All eggs in the 1971 season were removed immediately after laying ar
put on the conventional sand-tray for 48 hours before being sat and tume
each day. The usual foster-mother was a Black Sumatra hen but actual
the first Crane was successfully reared by a Rhode Island. The incubatK
period is 29/30 days. If the egg is water-tested 7/10 days before hatchin
one will get a clear indication of fertility. The usual method of candling
ineffective, owing to the heavily marked shell. On " pipping " the e|
was immediately transferred to an incubator to avoid any possible crushu
or injury to the chick by the foster-mother. After hatching it w
returned. The egg-shell appears to be exceptionally thick and assistan
by breaking the shell was given to the emerging chick, although this m
not have been necessary.

After the drying-off period, the chick was put with the foster-mother
1 the usual hen-coop inside a building. A small run was provided with
icking as the floor covering. An Infra-Red lamp was suspended at a
dght of 2 ft. above, for the first 2/3 days the chick is not very active,
formula for a diet was worked out and the ingredients were as follows:-

The whole dried off to crumbly consistency with chick crumbs.
It was soon evident that the chick would not pick by itself in spite of
icouragement by the hen. This was not unexpected as in the wild
ite the female Crane feeds the chick herself for several weeks. On the
lrd day after hatching the chick was induced to take small pieces of
od from a pair of tweezers and was fed every three hours. It also
irted to drink from a fountain. For a few days live Mealworms were
;o accepted in addition to the aforesaid diet. On the seventh day, the
ick was pinioned. It was not until three weeks that the chick started
pick food for itself and at this stage it was moved out of doors into a
jather-proof house constructed of corrugated plastic measuring
ft. x 6 ft. Shortly after this it was noticed that the outside toe of the
&amp;gt;ht foot was showing a " splayed " condition. The simple remedy of
natch stick applied as a splint secured with adhesive tape was used and
oved a completely effective cure. I was a little surprised at this trouble
curring as ample Calcium was present in the diet, but maybe some other
cc element is lacking. Growth is fairly quick and at five weeks
ithering is evident. The foster-mother was then removed.

168 J. O. D'EATH--SOME NOTES ON BREEDING THE STANLEY CRANE
Summary
It would not appear that the rearing of the species presents ar
unsurmountable difficulty, the main problem seems to be that one has j
be fortunate in having a breeding pair. Fertility running at less tha
50% is not satisfactory and obviously there is a diet deficiency in tl
breeding pair. I have observed on occasion my breeding pair catchiij
the odd field mouse or vole and eating caterpillars from plants. The
diet in the wild is known and in captivity where Zoos and Bird Gardei
have greater facilities than the private breeder like myself, I would ha&amp;gt;
thought the introduction of such items as mice and day/old chicks into tl&amp;lt;
diet might well go some way to solving the problem. There is one point 1
interest which has emerged from my experience with these Cranes which
that they are completely hardy in our English climate and I have not four
it necessary to house them in the winter. They have withstood temperatur
as low as -- i5*F. A. F. Moody in his "Waterfowl &amp; Gamebirds
Captivity (1932) " P. 174, says under the heading hardiness --" The mo
delicate of the Cranes mentioned and a species that although capable .
enduring a dry cold if confined in a shed, cannot bear combined cold wii
damp and requires to be housed under cover from early Autumn till la
Spring." The foregoing has definitely not been my experience. Finall
in the light of my experience, I would say that bearing in mind 01
variable climate it is impractical to let the birds attempt rearing the
own young and moreover, by removing the eggs one is obtaining great
productivity and thereby increasing the prospect of rearing more th;
two birds any one season.
Previous breedings
I am greatly indebted to the President of the Avicultural Society wl
has researched on the subject and writes as follows
". . . a rare breeding and worthy of every congratulation. A Knowslf
bred Stanley was included in the Knowsley sale, 1851 (see catalog!
in the Library of Zoological Society, London). Mitchell (Z&amp;lt;
Garden Guide, 1858, P. 13) says " at Knowsley broods of th
beautiful bird were hatched out on several occasions "--qui
possibly they were not reared.
Ezra had complete success in 1936. Young had been hatched
the three previous years but none had lived longer than a couple
weeks.
In 1936, however, one pair reared one young one and anoth
pair two. They were two and one month old at the date of tl.
account. Photographs are given of the young cranes.
For this success Ezra was awarded the A.S. medal (Aviculture
Magazine, 1936, pp. 272, 340).

In his account Ezra says " There is a young one at the London

The Zoo bird died but one was reared in 1937 (Zoo reports).
I am also grateful to Mr. Peter Olney, Curator of Birds, London Zoo,
3r the following information:- " In 1935 one hatched and died, in 1936
ne hatched and died and in 1937 one was apparently reared. You
rob ably know the reference that it was first bred in the U.S.A. by
Iackeson. This comes from Crandall's list in the N.Y. Zoo Soc:
917: 1449. There is also a reference to a Stanley X White-necked
rane successfully reared at Woburn in the Avicultural Magazine
920, p. 167."
From the foregoing it would appear that A. paradisea has not been bred
this country for 34 years.

A. Prestwich, we have had no more recent lists and it has become

I first witnessed the behaviour described in these notes, five years ago
the Spring of 1967 A few months previously, I had moved to my
esent address and, as I once again had sufficient room to keep humming-
rds (I had been without them for some months, due to lack of space)

a Goldcrest (Regulus regulus ), were released into the flight. Although
oes not concern the subject of these notes, perhaps I should mention
the mixing of other species of birds with hummingbirds, proved
*uccessful and two months after the initial stocking of the flight all
the hummers were removed. '
.he housing of hummingbirds in a communal flight has proved to be
irely successful I have not overstocked the flight, neither have I
lerstocked it. I consider six hummers to be the minimum and ten
maximum.

raid (Atnaziha franciae). Originally a pair were introduced to the
i- e male, however, proved so aggressive towards the female

housed one other female in the flight-a Black-tailed Trainbearer
ta victonae) as I have found it advisable to house batchelor males
&amp;apos; in such quarters.

between each phase. This song is extremely loud, especially for
hummingbird.
Although the male often sang when perched several feet from the femal
it was obvious the song was being directed at her. When the sor
reached a certain pitch, the male would become most agitated, E
would then leave the perch and fly towards the female, wings beatir
very much faster than in normal flight. If this initial burst of activi 1
was not enough to persuade the female to leave her perch, the male wou
bombard her from all directions, uttering shrill cries of protest,
would not take many seconds before such an onslaught persuaded tl
female to leave her perch, and when she did, the male would chase aft
her. At such times, it was always the female who tired first and when si
eventually settled on a perch again, the male would hover beneath he
taking hold of her downy vent feathers in the tip of his bill, and wou
then hang suspended for ten to twenty seconds at a time. This procedu
caused the female much distress and often she would leave the perch wi
the male still suspended from her vent feathers. If this occurred, f
male would be towed along behind, until eventually the female becar
exhausted and fell to the ground. More often than not, the male wou
still persist in holding on to the female's vent feathers and both bir
would remain on the ground for a few seconds as if in a trance.
On occasions, I observed the female trying to dodge the male, or,
he had already taken hold of her vent feathering, trying to dislodge hi:
by flying into a plant (I have a number growing along the back wall of t
flight). Sometimes this ruse would be successful, but more often th
not, the male would still be in tow when the female emerged from t
plant.
At no time did I witness the male Emerald attempting to mate with t
female, and although I presumed the behaviour mentioned, to be
prelude to mating, I could not be sure at the time.
These attacks on the female became more vicious as the male came ii
full breeding condition and because of this, I reluctantly parted with 1
female Emerald.
With the departure of the female, the male turned his attentions to otl
members of the flight. He was unable to intimidate any of these, howev
and for a time peace reigned. In fact it wasn't until I purchased a iu
Long-billed Starthroat (Heliomaster longirostris), that I again witness
the pre-mating behaviour of the Andean Emerald.
Long-billed Starthroats, although largish hummingbirds, are m
docile and rarely attack other hummers. The Andean Emerald provo)
the Starthroat from the beginning and although the latter seemed ablt
defend itself at first, it was not long before the Emerald dominated ii
such an extent as to make its life a misery. Often my wife or I wo
enter the birdroom and find the Starthroat clinging to the wire nett
with the Emerald attacking it unmercifully. This could not be allo\

to continue and I parted with the Starthroat, albeit reluctantly as I am
particularly fond of this species, finding it to have great character and a
quiet form of beauty.
Before parting with the Starthroat, the following observations were
made: The Andean Emerald chased the Starthroat in the same way as it
had the female Emerald The Starthroat, not being so agile, soon became
exhausted and was forced to settle either on a perch or on the wire netting
Directly this happened, the Emerald would take hold of the Starthroat's
tent feathers. After being suspended from these feathers for ten to
20 seconds, the Emerald would fly up on to the Starthroat's back and go
rough the actions of mating. After attempting to mate, the Emerald
voula ny to a perch and commence to preen.
Almost three years were to pass before I once again witnessed this
lehaviour m the Andean Emerald, In October, 1971, I purchased an
mmature male Golden-tailed Sapphire (Chrysuronia oenone), and an adult
nale Long-billed Starthroat. Both birds were well-fleshed and free
rom disease and were released into the flight almost immediately. The
starthroat was unable to fly more than a few feet at a time, due to the
wo outer primaries on each wing being badly frayed. I had my doubts
s to whether this bird would be suitable for inclusion in the flight until it
ad moulted. It moved about reasonably well, however, and as it
;emed content, I allowed it to remain. I fully expected the Andean
\0x25A0merald to cause a certain amount of trouble, but as he was now at least
ve years old I hoped he would not prove quite so vicious as when
rst purchased. Also placing two new additions into the flight would
hoped, confuse the Emerald somewhat.
The Sapphire proved to be extremely agile and more often than not
as able to out-fly the ageing Emerald. If the Sapphire did become
digued, it would take refuge in a plant and the Emerald would then give
? the chase. &amp;
As the Starthroat was unable to fly correctly, the Emerald naturally paid
ore attention to this bird than the Sapphire. The Emerald did not
icome so agitated with the Starthroat as it has done with the female
raerald, and because of this, would perform the pre-mating behaviour in
more leasurely manner. As the Starthroat was loath to take to the wing
lless it became absolutely necessary, the Emerald was able to hover
meath it for three or four seconds before taking hold of the vent feathers,
tie Emerald would, on occasions, peck at the Starthroat's vent a number
times before taking hold of the downy feathers. Once it did take hold
these feathers, it would hang motionless, with wings opened wide, and
&amp;gt;uld sing a subdued version of the normal type song. After fifteen seconds
so, the Emerald would release its hold on the Starthroat's feathers and
up on to the bird's back and attempt to mate. Occasionally, while
empting to mate, the Emerald would take hold of the Starthroat's head
neck feathers.

176 A. J. MOBBS--PRE-MATING BEHAVIOUR IN HUMMINGBIRDS
During the procedure described, the Starthroat usually remained
passive, although on occasions it did attempt to fend off the Emerald with
its bill. My wife did on one occasion, witness the Starthroat taking ho
of the Emerald by the throat feathers. Only once (to date) has the Emera
become so agitated as to turn vicious with the Starthroat. When this&amp;apos;
occurred, the Emerald pierced the latter's throat, drawing a considerably
amount of blood. , ,
At the time of writing, the male Golden-tailed Sapphire, has beer
performing the pre-mating behaviour described for the Andean Emerald
for a week or so. As already mentioned, this Sapphire was immature whei
purchased. Shortly afterwards, it commenced to moult into adul
plumage and a couple of weeks before this was attained, I observed tb
Sapphire attempting to mate with the Starthroat. At first the Sapphin
did not take hold of the Starthroat's vent feathers, but would fly directl
on to the latter's back. The Sapphire now follows the behaviour patten
already described, with one slight difference. After attempting to mat
with another hummer, the Emerald has always retired to a perch and com
menced to preen; the Sapphire will again take hold of its victim s ver
feathers after an attempted mating and will in fact go through this prc
cedure a number of times before retiring to a perch to preen.
The tables have now been turned on the Emerald as the Sapphire h&amp;lt;
on occasions, turned its attentions towards the former as well as to tb
Starthroat. The Sapphire has in fact occasionally succeeded in suspends
itself from the Emerald's vent feathers, much to the latter's disgus
Both the Emerald and the Sapphire have on occasions turned the
attentions to other members of the flight. They have not, as far as l a
aware, succeeded in attaching themselves to the vent feathers of the
birds, however. . , .
As the Emerald was not seen to attempt a mating with the terna
Emerald and yet was seen to do so with both Starthroat's; could it I
that the " victim " has to be passive, before a mating is attempted? T 1
theory could in fact be correct, as I have witnessed both the Sapphire ai
the Emerald attempt a mating with a hummer which has been at re

Jght Demoiselles paired up. I estimated their ages to be about three
/ears as they came to us very young. On April 21 st this year an egg was

rom the public path. The enclosure itself contains a group of both
Demoiselle and Crowned cranes and measures about i# acres in extent.
art of it is wooded, part open. Apart from the fact that all the birds are
unioned they live virtually natural lives.
Both birds became extremely aggressive, attacking everything that came
/.thin their twenty yard territory. They would flatten themselves
gainst the ground, wings spread out and forward, and attack in this
lanner. Occasionally they would launch into their " dance ", a display
t leaping about throwing twigs and pieces of turf in the air and stabbing
ie earth with their sharp beaks. Often this preceeded their more
?gressive manoeuvres. The second egg was laid almost two days later,
hey were greyish-brown in colour and slightly blotched. The first chick
atched on 19th May the second on the 21st. The incubation period
as therefore 29 days. The chicks appeared to be no more than 3 in
. height. You could just see their little yellow heads above the grass as
ley stumbled after their parents. On 21st May we noticed one of the
licks sitting on its own with the parents several yards away. We decided
eave it alone for half an hour in the hope that Mum and Dad would

under the protective wing of its parents but on 24th May this chick
0 was noticeably absent, and was never found. Although all of this
is very disappointing weknew at least that we had a good breeding pair.
^ ink that probably both the babies were initially weakened by the wet
weather that followed some days after they were hatched. Also the
iss was rather long and continually wet.
In late June the Sarus cranes which share a paddock with Llama and
iea showed signs that they were going to nest. In their case a definite
Ulow nest of bits of twig, feathers and dried grass was fashioned a foot
ay from their pool in exactly the same spot as the year before. At that
ie they laid two eggs, later found to be infertile.

iy8 B. C. SINFIELD--SOME NOTES ON THE BREEDING OF CRANES
We waited expectantly and then on 26th June the first egg was laid
and two days later a second. It is interesting here to note that during th
incubation period the previous year the hen bird turned savagely on th
cock. In fact she chased him over the fence no less than three times
We were therefore forced to remove him for the duration. The hen thei
sat the incubation out on her own. We expected the same thing t
happen this year, but instead they both behaved perfectly, swapping th
incubation between them.
Since the weather was rather unsettled we decided to remove one eg
after about two weeks, and place it in an incubator. The remaining eg
duly hatched 29 days later, the one in the incubator never did. TH
chick was about seven or eight inches in height and pale buff in colou:
The parents now spent most of the day grubbing about for worms an
insects. We decided to supplement their normal feed of mixed grail,
chopped veg. and day old chicks with maggots and mealworms. The
were often seen feeding the baby with insects and worms, probably tc
with some regurgitated matter, but we could not get close enough 1
see.
As usual following the birth of cranes in this country, we had son
very cold wet weather. This was about a week after hatching,
stayed wet for some days and I had fears that the chick would not surviv
However I decided to leave it with the parents. The grass in the paddod
had been cropped short by the Llamas, which meant that the chick wj
not wading through wet grass as was the case with the Demoiselle
The chick did not appear to have suffered any ill effects from the wettir
at all, and was soon grubbing about in the earth alongside its parent
At about the second week we sprinkled worming powder on the food,
the hope that the chick would manage to get some. If one tried
approach the baby the parents set up an awful din and attack*
savagely. At the time of writing (30th August) the chick is a little ov
two months old and about 18 in. in height.
So far neither the Lifford nor the Crowned Cranes have shown ai
sign of breeding.
We discovered an interesting phenomenen in our Crowned Cran
following the death of one of them. In this bird an exceptionally long be
growth was found and the lower mandible had broken off leaving t
poor bird no way in which it could feed. While this in itself in an c
bird is not extraordinary, indeed it is quite commonplace in toucans ai
hornbills, we were rather surprised when rounding up all the others j
discovered that every bird (Crowned Cranes) had an overgrown be&amp;lt;,
both mandibles in some of them were over six inches long.
I can only assume that the ground must be too soft for them, althou 1
if this were the case surely the other three species would have showr|
similar deformity? I have kept cranes for many years on similar grou
and never had this kind of trouble before. The mandibles were di

etween the mated male and female is known to occur in 32 or more
unilies involving approximately 120 species of which nearly 100 are
opical. There are some nine families in which this reaches its highest
evelopment, with alternating or precise union song between the paired
lale and female, used even when the birds cannot see each other. The
&amp;apos;Suit of this is that distance, intervening vegetation, etc., offer little or no
sstacle to mutual recognition and the maintenance of contact. The
ine families are: Megapodidae, Phasianidae, Rallidae, Formicariidae,
roglodytidae, Turdidae, Sylviidae, Laniidae, and Meliphagidae.
The author has studied the phenomenon in certain of these families
arting with the Laniidae, with special reference to the species of Lanarius
id their geographical distribution and ethological and ecological
olation. Records of musical examples were taken in the wild in various
calities and then analysed, giving the number of notes, duration, semi-
nes, Herz frequency, and remarks on the duets, which sometimes
elude a third bird duplicating note 1 or notes 1-3. The results are
ven in tabular form the first table concerning Laniarius aethiopicus major
the Nakuru-Dundori population with 102 records,; a second table of
&amp;apos; recor ds of the same species in Uganda; a third with 24 examples of the
itale-Kaibos-Kapenguria population; and further tables dealing with
ree species or subspecies of Laniarius. Musical examples are then
ven of duet patterns of various species of Laniarius followed by a detailed
scussion of the seven races of L. aethiopicus , the Tropical Boubou
irike.
Sketch maps are given showing areas where continuous tape recordings
ire taken to show the interchange between territories, without any pair
:spassmg on another's home ground. Where the country is suitable
d birds are in fair numbers these territories tend to be rounded or
al and average about seven acres in extent. Cases of trio and quartet
may occur at territorial boundaries--as a result of aggressive
counters between mated pairs.
Experimental studies were then carried out on Laniarius aethiopicus ,
Tie hand reared and others wild caught, maintained in tropical aviaries.
ie results confirmed field observations that the birds have exact control
the timing, pitch, and overall rate at which they produce their duets.
ie pitch control was found to be accurate to a semitone and even
isistent to a quartertone. The aviary work confirmed the view that

one of the major functions of the imitative ability of the birds was t&amp;lt;
establish and strengthen social bonds.
Succeeding chapters deal with other species of Laniarius and musica
aspects of the vocalizations of L. aethiopicus and L. ferrugineus. Finally
the behaviour of Robin Chats and Grass Warblers is also considered.
This comprehensive and detailed account of one of the more interestinj
aspects of bird behaviour summarizes the available information on th
subject in addition to providing a wealth of material for future studies
It is likely long to remain the standard work on the subject.

A most interesting and comprehensive monograph on the parrc

behaviour both in the wild and in captivity. A " must " for any seriou
aviculturist who is interested in these birds and who can read Germar
Among the very numerous illustrations are several photos of the natun
habitats of these birds, or perhaps one should sometimes say " un-natural
as many of them show man-altered areas, to which some species of parrq
finches have successfully adapted. There is also a coloured plate showin
all species, either " full figure " or in some cases " head and neck " onlj
and a colour photograph of Royal Parrot Finches feeding in a fig tret
A great deal of information as to the foods taken by parrot finches, bot
in the wild and in captivity are given.
To pick out just a few currants to indicate how much there is of interes
in this very rich cake:
Little is recorded of the behaviour of the Pintailed Nonpareil, Erythrur
prasina in the wild, in spite of its being so extensively collected an
captured. (P. 27). Fruit doves of the genus Ptilinopus appear to b
serious food competitors with those parrot finches, such as the Roy&amp;lt;
Parrot Finch, that specialise in feeding on the seeds of wild figs, drivin
them persistently away from fruiting trees, (pp. 68 and 72). As i;
Britain, so in such exotic islands as Viti Levu, the native trees are bein
deliberately destroyed in order to plant exotic conifers (P. 73). Th
Red-headed Parrot Finch breeds well at first in captivity but after a fe^
generations the fertility rate soon declines. The reason for this is nc
known (P. 121). This species is, fortunately, still common and widesprea
in New Caledonia where it adapts well to man's alteration of the environ
ment. It is considered possible however, that the [past and continuing

)mmon Waxbill are already well established and the (Red?) Squirrel

he Royal Parrot Finch is threatened by the introduction of bird malaria
d its carrier, the mosquito Culex pipiens (P. 69).
On a lighter note; Hell may have no fury like a woman scorned, but the
uale parrot finches of the Melanesian islands show a comparable reaction
that of their human counterparts in this situation (P. 125).
The Gouldian Finch is not included in Erythrura but in the monotypic
nus Chloebia ; it appears to have as much in common with the munias,
mchura , as with the parrot finches.

Birds have been kept by man since the dawn of civilisation, first as
istants in hunting and the control of vermin and subsequently as pets,
many cultures, apart from sacred-birds kept in temples, trained or
tied birds were maintained in royal menageries even before birds were
it for food. The author describes the aesthetics and mechanics of
dcage and aviary design ranging from at least one knowledgeable
cier in Noah to the Snowdon aviary in the London Zoo.
rhe first chapter in this splendidly illustrated history deals with ancient
tes when birds of curiosity and interest were kept in many civilisations
luding the ancient Egyptians, Chinese and the Greek and Roman
ipires. An example of a birdcage in Byzantine tiles very closely
embles a modern parrot cage and aviaries were a common feature in
man villas.
rhe second chapter deals with Renaissance exoticism and after, which
ated an ideal climate for the spread of aviculture. The domes which
bellished homes and mosques were reproduced in Moorish ball-topped
Icages, creating a pattern which exists to this day. The opening
of new trade routes and the discovery of new countries added to the
of exotic species of birds that rich aviary owners wished to acquire and
iked in the development of more elaborate avairies many of which are
strated. Then came the age of elegance with bird keeping on a grand
e developed with the changing fashions in landscape gardening in the
iteenth century and many examples are described and figured,
he rise of the fancy dates from the middle of the eighteenth century
especially the beginning of the nineteenth, and when the London
1 opened in 1828 birds were already an important feature and people
e prepared to pay handsomely to see a bird show. Elaborate birdcages

and aviaries were designed ranging from Chippendale style and porcela
cages to elaborate aviaries. The boom in budgerigars and the develo
ment of pleasure gardens and zoos in recent times have all contribut
to a great variety in the designs of cages. Since World War II a cag,
collecting craze has developed and illustrations are given of some of t
more grotesque examples and current prices.
This attractive book concludes with a county-by-county guide to 1
establishments in the British Isles of interest to bird-lovers.

BREEDING OF THE BLACK REDSTART
(PHOENICURUS OCHRURUS L.) IN GERMANY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.921659571428571" page_id="58078238"  page_num="184" year="" vol="">
In July 1972 Mr. O. Bielefeldt, Liibeck, an aviculturist who specialises in keepi
European birds (which is permitted to some extent in Germany) told me that
Black Redstarts ( Phoenicurus ochruros L.) had just successfully reared two youngste
The Redstarts shared a densely planted aviary (ca. 4 X 2 X 2.5 m.) with a Nuthat
(Sitta europea ), two Wheatears ( Oenanthe oenanthe), a pair of White WagU
(Motacilla alba alba), which had also been making attempts to breed this year, a
a pair of Quail ( Coturnix coturnix). The nest was built in a wooden nest-b(
which was half open in front. The diet was a soft-billed bird-food, consisting
egg, a sort of Madeira cake, carrots and dried insects together with plenty
mealworms. Unfortunately Mr. Bielefeldt could not observe the process
breeding and rearing and did not make any notes.
Black Redstarts are not often kept in Germany and very infrequently bred; t
last account of successful rearing being written by P. Ganzlin before World War
and published in Die Gefiederte Welt, 1937.

JRTHER NOTES ON THE DILL COLOUR OF THE WHITE-BELLIED
GO-AWAY BIRD
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993409055555556" page_id="58078239"  page_num="185" year="" vol="">
l nthe January-February issue of the Magazine, (pp. 37-38,) I commented on
' likelihood of the bill colour of the White-bellied Go-away Bird, Corythaixiodes
cogaster, providing a means of sexing this species. My comment was prompted
the capture of two pairs who had mated-up in the wild, for in both instances one
d of the pair possessed a dark, virtually black bill and the other a greenish-
low bill.
Recently I visited the National IVIuseum, Nairobi, where I was able to examine
jcimens of this species. Of the skins in this collection, eleven with black bills
re labelled as being male, while two were labelled female. On the othei hand,
with greenish-yellow bills were shown as being female, and one as being a male!
le skin had no sex indicated on its label. Perhaps the most interesting of all was
;pecimen with the plumage wholly snowy-white; this was labelled as being a
aale and the bill was described as being pink, tinged green.
Lack of time prevented me from taking measurements and noting the locality
ere individual specimens were collected to investigate whether either are relevant
the issue. Thus my theory still remains inconclusive.
Incidentally, half-a-dozen live nestlings of this species that I have been able to
unine have all possessed black bills.

was interested in Mr. Trollope's note on interactions of other species with
nted Quail (Avicult. Mag. 74 / 11) since I have noted on numerous occasions a
k Cutthroat, Amadina fasciata, preening a hen Japanese Quail, CotuTnix japonica.
ould mention that the Cutthroat did not have a mate, and that the Japanese
ail consisted of three hens and a cock. The preening was not mutual, but at
es the Cutthroat clumped with two or more of the hens. At other times
lisplayed to the hen quail, and also tried what looked rather like an attempt to
te with it, being taken for short rides around the aviary on the back of the quail,
have also observed a cock Malabar Starling, Sturnus malabaricus, preen and
mp with a Japanese Quail. The starling also lowered its head to solicit preening,
this was not returned. The starling was at this time a solitary bird, but although
:e then I have obtained a mate for it the pair has been moved to another aviary,
I have not been able to observe if preening took place again.

&amp;gt;oth Mr. Lambert's observations given above, and those of Mr. Ellis ( Avicult.
g. 78 / 38) on a similar association between a Negro Finch, Nigrita canicapilla ,
a Green Pigeon, Treron australis , refer to the smaller bird resting on the back
he larger one. During earlier studies by Desmond Morris of Java Sparrows,
Ida oryzivora, roosting with Barbary Doves, Streptopelia roseogrisea , he found
smaller bird often moved from side to side over the back of the larger one.
considered that the smaller bird regarded the much larger one as the equivalent
clumping and resting group of its own species. In such a group lined up on a
:h the outside birds will from time to time run along the backs of the others and
eeze down in a gap in the middle of the group. Morris suggested that the
tiler bird on the back of the large one was looking for a non-existent " middle
" on the back into which it could descend. (Assistant Editor).

"The two chicks grew nicely and left their nest at 20 days of age. The
parent birds followed the chicks wherever they perched and continued
to feed and guard them from other birds in the aviary. When 30 days
old the chicks were observed feeding for the first time with the mothei
at the regular feeding pans.
"A second clutch of eggs was laid 17-18th August, also in 1970 by the
same pair of birds. The two eggs hatched 20-31st August, again recording
an incubation period of 13 and 14 days respectively.
"With these notes we wish to confirm Dr. Delacour's view that inter-
specific hybridisation may occur successfully between Coerebidae anc
Thraupidae which has been much disputed in the field of ornithology.
It now appears that the female Masked Tanager belongs to the sub-
species franciscae , not fanny , which is very slightly different and lives ;
little further north (Costa Rica). . ..
The buffy colour on the throat of the hybrid, as well as its white belly
reminds one of the female's feather pattern, whereas the pale blue crowi
recalls that of the male. Curiously, the black saddle of both parents 1

be pointed out that in the most recent arrangement of these species, uj
Peter's "Checklist of Birds of the World" vol. 14, (1968) edited by R. A
Paynter, the Coerebidae has disappeared. The genera Diglossa , Chloro
phanes , Iridophanes , Cyanerpes, Dacnis, Hemidacnis, Xenodacnis , Oreomant
and Euneornis are all put with the Tanagers in the subfamily Thraupmae c
the Emberizidae. The remaining genera Coereba and Comrostrum (in
eluding Ateleodacnis) have been placed provisionally with the America
Warblers, Parulidae, although Skutch has suggested that the former 1

ter might be related to the typical buntings. The San Diego breedm
illustrates how hybridisation can at times help to confirm suspecte
taxonomic relationships.

The pair of Bearded Reedlings, Panurus biarmicus, were imported from

lar to their natural environment, but with some differences. The
\0x25A0ary was planted and designed to produce as much live food as possible
easured 15 ft. X 8 ft. x 8 ft. and was constructed with no solid shelter
rerhead or around the sides. I feel that although such shelter has its
\0x25A0 vantages it also has a disadvantage in that birds may become upset at

d-bed and thick vegetation which I provided, and seemed completely
iome in the environment I had created. y
The vegetation cover took up three-quarters of the aviary flight and
j d of a pear-shaped reed-bed about 12 ft. long, 6 ft. at its widest
rowmg to 2-3 ft.; with a cavity 12-14 in. deep filled with mud from a

, flow ering plants, a large clump of nettles, spear-grass, and three
Gps of Pampas Grass which I added to thicken the cov^r. It also

the flight, I noticed the cock looking down into the reeds. This may nc
sound unusual but he was so still, not moving a feather, and concentratin
so much that he did not notice me moving nearer, that I thought somethin
was wrong. He stayed frozen in this position for at least three or foi
minutes, and I was about to investigate when he started calling, and
have hardly ever seen a bird so excited. He started to hop up and dow
and call for all he was worth. I really thought something was wror.
and with heart beginning to beat heavily I started forward to enter t
aviary but then saw the reeds move and the hen came out.
She went up to the cock who by this time was wildly excited. Fir
he fluffed up into a ball, then crouched low on the perch, and spread h
wing and tail at the same time bowing towards the hen. He then hoppf
over the hen and back again. This he did three or four times T 1
hen was just preening herself and shaking her feathers. The cock th&amp;lt;
saw me and gave the alarm and they both took cover. From that time (
I had a feeling that they might be nesting and decided to watch mo
closely. , . ,

a morning off from work and decided to sit and watch. I did so for abo
one and a half hours and noticed that the pair seemed to be changi
places, like a shift. On 25th June when I visited my friend Frank Mead
I told him my observations and he confirmed that the cock shared
incubation. ,,
Another thing I observed was the pair preening each other, men;
together they were scratching and cleaning their plumage. The h
stretched upwards and the cock moved closer and did the same,
both fluffed out the feathers of the head, and at almost the same mom,
they tilted their heads as if showing each other the sides of their fac
The cock then started to preen the side of the hen's face and she in tv
did the same to him. They continued this for some five minutes. It v
pleasing to see the two birds behaving in such an affectionate way towa;:
each other.
Their general behaviour did not change for several days; and on 2&amp;lt;
June a friend suggested that I should have a look. With the aid of a c;&amp;gt;
I parted the reeds a little where I had seen the pair going down and s|
enough I found their nest, which was built about three or four inc
above the water level in the reeds and contained four eggs. I did 1
stay long for fear of disturbing the birds. For me this was the greats
thing to have happened since I started to breed birds. I would menti
that the pair take turns at incubation for very short periods, so mud:
that at first I thought they had deserted the nest.

ml 4 th July when I noticed in the morning a piece of eggshell on the
nary floor. When I returned from work in the evening I went to feed
em and saw both adults out of the reeds. I decided to go in, for since
knew where the nest was a quick look would do no harm. I kept an eve
. the adults, who became a little upset as I approached the nest I did
)t stay long, but saw three young and one egg.
I cannot express in words my excitement at that moment, and onlv
ose who have done the same will know how I felt. My task now was to
t those youngout of the nest and reared successfully. I started off
offering Wax Moth larvae; and very small mealworms about one-eighth
ree-quarters of an inch long, sifted out of some cultures which I had.
00 as many Wax Moth as I could spare without destroying the whole
Iture and then turned to the Flour Moth larvae which were breeding
mtifully in with the mealworms. Fly maggots and pupae were also
\0x25A0en, the maggots being dusted with Vionate and Calcium Lactate.
id not see what insects were selected but only made sure that they were
mg them to the nest. J
The adults entered the nest by one route and left by another, entering
ir the nest but emerging some distance away. The droppings of the
mg were carried to the side of the aviary and wiped off on the vertical
ary wire.
Since I work on shifts on different days of the week this gave me the
^rtumty to feed the birds more often. I gave the food three times a
\ . arran g ed to have a week off work and during this week I fed
nds five times a day, giving the food in smaller quantities. I had
iced that each time I gave more food the birds came and carried some
tight to the nest, and I hoped by feeding more often to encourage them
leep feeding the young.
continued this feeding but also offered whiteworms sprayed with
dec multi-vitamins. I also shook greenflies (Aphis) on to the food
and found that they took these readily; and after a few days I found
: they were not taking the whiteworms but only the greenflies. I got
ouch with Frank Meaden the day the young hatched and asked his
ice on any additional food. At his suggestion I picked out white
worms which had just shed their skins and were soft, and also the
mealworm pupae; and later, with his help, I obtained some Wood Ant
ae which were taken readily by the birds.
y the 8th July when all seemed to be going well I took another look
ound I still had three young and an unhatched egg. Although I was
pted to look every day I did not do so for fear of losing them. On
1 J u y w ^ en Frank Meaden came and photographed them they were
. eathered ; and T. Sharland, who helped me by letting me have his
worm culture saw them on i 4 th. On i 7 th July all three left the

The young tended to keep to the cover of the reed-bed and remaine
close together. Within three or four days of leaving the nest they wei
already beginning to take greenflies.
In describing this breeding I should like to acknowledge the help an
advice of my good friend Frank Meaden, which made it possible. I ha\

{Poicephalus meyeri)
By Raymond Franklin (Chesham, Bucks., England)
Meyer's Parrot needs very little description, for recently Dr. Hawki
of California has given us comprehensive details of the races, habitats, ei
of this interesting little species of the genus Poicephalus.
I acquired a pair from a Harrow dealer in July 197*- I consider
them to be a true pair mainly because the cock has a larger beak and me
yellow on the crown; and is also a much bolder bird, if bold is the rig:
word, as both birds were, and are, very nervous. I decided to winl
them out in a flight 4m.Xim.X2m. with a small shelter shed attached
which incidentally they never use except for feeding in.
They were fed the usual diet of sunflower seed, etc., supplement,
with apple and carrot of which they seem very fond. To this was addt
a sprinkling of a multi-vitamin additive. They came through the win
very well and did not seem to bother much about the cold.
On 3rd April I hung a small log--a section of a natural hollow of an #i
tree with a woodpecker's hole just the right size. They showed no inter t
in mating except that on a few occasions the cock was seen to feed U
hen on regurgitated food. Briefly that was all that happened in iy 7 *
They were wintered out again--a fairly reasonable winter anyway,
main problem, of course, being the possibility of frost-bitten feet astb
would insist on roosting out all the time. So I fixed a sheet of glass 0 1
the top of their favourite perch. Glass may be rather cold but it
help to keep off the worst of the snow and rain.
At the beginning of January 1972 they seemed to become rather nB
voluble than usual so I took the old log down and part filled it with p&amp;lt;
This was a bit early in the year and I hoped (?) that they would not gG

le peat out after a few days. The weather was wet for most of the month
ith snow showers on the 30th. I left the log up and put more peat in a
;w wee ks later, around the beginning of March. This was thrown out
pun. On the 25th March I filled the log with rotten wood. They also
Djected to that! (I was beginning to think they might like some hay and
others instead!) On the 1st April I put another larger natural lo- hung
p at an angle as this has been known to have the desired effect. This was
so not appreciated so I removed it on the 20th April. On the 2^th
pril the cock was seen popping in and out of the original log which had
sen refilled with rotten wood. The week ending 14th May had been
:ry wet and cold so I decided to have a look to see if anything was
ippenmg and on the 16th May I was surprised to see one egg so as the
rds are very nervous, I kept away.
On the 16th June, as the weather was warming up, I took another look
the log and saw two babies possibly about a week old. There was
st a bit of down on them then. All this time the hen seemed to do all
e sitting, while the cock agitatedly hopped about by the pop hole.
1 the 30th July one young was seen to peep out of the log. This must
ve gone on for a long time as he did not come out until the 10th August,
was a very fine bird, nearly as big as the adult cock bird, but having a
orter tail and no yellow on the crown. It was not quite as nervous as
2 parents. I was pleasantly surprised to see two more come out of the
&amp;gt; on the x 3 th August and still one more on the 15th! Presumably
ise eggs were laid over a period of a few days.
From the 15th to 20th August all four babies went back into the log.
vould have thought this behaviour was a bit strange but presumably
&amp;gt;ther knows best! Now I have four fine young, rather nervous, but I
pe that they will tame down, although the parents have never really
:ome tame in the two years I have had them.

(Eos reticulata)
By R. W. Phipps (Maidenhead, Berkshire, England)
I have for some years now found lories and lorikeets to be among the
most engaging of birds, and was glad to have a chance of obtaining a pan
of Blue-streaked Lories from some imported by Mr. Jim Hayward o:
Carterton Breeding Aviaries in 1971. He had six or so of these birds
all in excellent condition and by then acclimatised; and although the&amp;gt;
all looked very similar Mr. Hayward selected two which he believed to b&amp;lt;
a true pair, the black belly markings of the supposed female being rathe
larger and rounder than those of the male.
These lories, from the Tenimber Islands between Australia and Nev
Guinea, are a bright if rather deep crimson colour, freely marked witl
black on wings and tail and with dark red and black mottling on the breas
and underparts. The bill is orange and narrow light blue feather
extend in a broad streak from behind each eye down the sides of th
neck, with similar colour on the mantle. Knowing which is which of m
pair I can see a slight difference in head-shape between them, that of th
male being somewhat larger and with a rather more prominent foreheac
Apart from the belly markings mentioned, which are possibly diagnosti
as to sex, any other differences in markings appear to be so slight as to b
individual rather than sexual characteristics.
The season being summer (1971) the birds were put into an outdoc
aviary of about 4 ft. x 8 ft. x 6 ft. high, including an open-fronted shelter-
modest enough proportions by any standards, but I have found that lone
do not require large spaces, being rather heavy fliers and spending muc
time climbing, posturing with much exaggeration and performir,
numerous acrobatics. The perches provided were of natural fruit tr(
branches complete with their various off-shoots.
The main food provided then, and through the winter, was a mixture &amp;lt;
a complete human food such as Complan or Gevral and honey in equ
proportions, stirred into a paste with a little water and then diluted to
milk-like consistency with more cold water. A little fresh milk w
added sometimes, and eventually a mixture of sugar and honey was use
in place of honey only, with the object of more nearly matching flow
nectar which almost always contains more sucrose (sugar) than it do
glucose and fructose, which are the principal ingredients of honey aft
the bees have completed their inversion process. I am not among t o
who believe that honey must be better than sugar for nectar feede
because it is a " natural " food, but the general question of feeding su&amp;lt;
birds is an interesting subject in itself and beyond the scope of these note
Maggots, mealworms, various fruits, berries and seeds were provi &amp;lt;
through the Autumn and Winter, but little enthusiasm was shown 1

my of these with the exception of some dates of the type one buys in
&amp;gt;oxes around Christmas time. The birds were transferred to unheated
ndoor accommodation from December to February, mainly for reasons
)f convenience, but I believe they could as well have stayed outside with a
lest-box for roosting in the shelter part of the aviary. Lories are what one
night call sensible birds, quite without the distressing suicidal tendency
&amp;gt;f most parakeets I have kept to select the most exposed place on the
.viary wire for roosting, particularly during the long winter nights.
The birds were returned to the aviary already described early in March
972 and, against all the rules, a nest-box was provided in the partly
nclosed section. The box was made from f in. wood, about 8 in. square
nternally and 20 in. high with a 3 in. entry hole near the top, with a wire
adder inside. The upper two-thirds of the front was hinged for con-
ement inspection of the interior, and about 5 in. of mixed peat and wood-
havings was placed inside. This box was fixed in a back corner, the
Dp being 6 in. from the translucent plastic roof. Although mating was
bserved during that month little interest was shown in the box, except as
omething to climb around and for roosting on, until quite late in May
/hen it came into considerable daytime use.
As well as the usual nectar, maggots and hempseed were provided, both
f which proved more popular than when offered previously, but during
le first half of June both birds seemed to be out in the aviary too much
)r incubation to be in progress.
On 23 rd June I took the chance when both birds were in the flight to
* e if there was a cold egg or two in the box, and was a good deal more than
irprised to see the twin grey shapes of head and body of a chick which
lust have hatched a few days earlier. From about that time both parents
Dent much more of the daytime, as well as the night of course, in the
est-box together, and much as I would have liked to follow the chick's
rogress more closely they generally rushed back home whenever I
Dproached too closely or to replenish food and water.
By this time larger quantities of more solid food such as maggots and
empseed were being taken and rather less of the liquid food. Fresh
uit, greenstuff and dates were all consumed to a greater extent, and so
ere maggot pupae which had previously been ignored. Fruit tree twigs
ere stripped of bark, which appeared mostly to be eaten. Wholemeal
ead crumbs and baby food were added to some of the regular
Dctar, and this was now accepted, having earlier been left. The birds
d not, however, welcome the addition of soya flour. Fresh corn cob
as appreciated when hung from the aviary roof, but was only partly
ripped when placed in a dish. The area round the nest-box was
&amp;gt;rayed with water during hot, dry weather.
From mid-July young feeding noises were heard, mostly during the
enings and on 3rd August the chick was covered with grey down and
me quills showed, mainly on the wings. On 14th August some red

the back; by this time the bird was about two months old. Early ir
September, in addition to a general increase in red and black feathers
some light blue ones had appeared on the crown and back of the head, 1
colouring which is not present in the adults; and a fair growth of tail wa;
observed.
The parents made a lot of noise and took up quite aggressive attitude:
when the nest was approached, and the young bird responded by trying t&amp;lt;
make itself as small as possible in a corner of the box, but the parents die
not rush back to the nest as they had done earlier.
By mid-September the young bird appeared quite fully feathered am
fully grown, differing from the parents only in the blue head marking
and dark grey instead of orange bill; but although by then three month
old showed no signs of leaving the nest. It did in fact leave early in th
morning of 25th September, just about 14 weeks from the probable dat
of hatching, and apart from its rather poorly co-ordinated flying am
landing techniques it moved about the aviary as freely as did the parents
The first night was spent on a branch in the shelter, head turned back ii
typical fashion, the parents retiring to the top of the nest-box as was thei
habit before nesting started. The overall red colouring can by this tim
be seen to be duller than the adults and the dark markings on the under
side are similar to those of the cock, but a less intense black.
After the young bird had left, the nest-box was examined. Althoug
the litter was damp and compacted it was not sticky, and the bottom c
the box was quite dry and clean; surprisingly so in fact as no escape hole
or wire tray were provided in the base. Little if any of the wood-shaving
had been chewed up; and although the litter was replaced it could just #
well have been left for another brood as far as could be judged from ii
appearance, texture and complete lack of odour. There was no sign (
egg shell or any indication that more than one egg had been laid.
During the next two weeks the parents were observed feeding the your
one, and they all appeared to get on well enough for me to conclude th;
they could possibly spend the wmter together. However, on 9th Octob&amp;lt;
the parents were twice seen to make what can best be described as a so
of mock attack on the young one; more, it was judged in an attempt to drh
it away than to inflict injury. These " attacks " were accompanied by
good deal of noise and although quickly abandoned on my approach,
was thought best to transfer the young bird to another aviary, since
had been seen to feed itself, especially on more solid items like apple ar
corncob. On its own now, it appears especially fond of apple and 01
wonders if the parents provide a fairly solid food with consequent sear(
for something of similar texture by the young during the early days
independence.
On 12th October the parents were spending some time in the nest agai
and renewing their interest in the cuttlefish which is always availab!

(Semnornis ramphastinus)
By Bryan S. Ward (Heysham, Lancashire, England)
The eight-inch long Toucan Barbet is found in South America, in the
omewhat confined range of Western Ecuador and Columbia.
It has a black face, crown and nape with elongated feathers from the
mdcrown, and white stripes from above each eye down to the back of the
ead. The sides of the head, neck, throat and upper breast are blue-grey,
nth a broad red band across the lower breast, the abdomen and sides of
le body are dull yellow. The mantle being olive brown and the rump
olden yellow. It has grey-black wings and tail. The eyes are red and
le feet grey.
We purchased our pair of barbets towards the end of 1970. During
le following year they attempted to nest, by chipping away at a rotten
&amp;gt;g in various places, and ultimately succeeded in making a suitable
esting hole about 18 in. from the floor. This attempt was thwarted
r hen one morning we found the female with a damaged wing, hopping
round on the floor and unable to fly. She has never fully recovered, and
m fly only very short distances, but gets around very well by jumping
om perch to perch.
After a long period of convalescence, we reintroduced her to the male
id within a couple of days she had started to use the hole that they had
3th hollowed out previously, even though since her accident, both the
lale and the log had been removed to another compartment.
As with most barbets, they spent quite some time in the hole, so I am
naware of when she first started laying her eggs, and consequently of the
-tual incubation time. We heard sounds from the youngsters on 16th
ugust, 1972 and as they grew older they also grew considerably more
lisy, in fact they were the most noisy of any young I have ever heard,

very long time, the first of them leaving 43 days from the initial time of
hearing them. The other two left at further intervals of two days.
For the first half of the nestling period they were, as far as I know, fed
mainly on mealworms, plus a small amount of our soft food mixture.
Latterly, the parents were observed taking fruit, chiefly grapes, into the
nesting hole, and for the last couple of weeks, mice two or three days old
were given and quickly taken into the nest for the young birds.
The young are exactly the same as their parents except that they are
approximately 1 in. smaller and their colouring slightly paler. Their
eyes, unlike the adults are black.
As described above, the Toucan Barbet, Semnornis ramphastinus , has
been bred at the Winged World. It is believed that this may be a first
success. Any member or reader knowing of a previous breeding of this
species in Great Britain or Northern Ireland is requested to communicate

(P. frontalis chiripepexP. melanura pacifica)
By Rosemary Low (New Barnet, Herts., England)
My aim is to keep true pairs of parrots, but a few single birds in any
collection are almost inevitable. My single birds are all housed in the
same aviary, one of a range of four, three of which measure 14 ft* long,
3 ft. wide and 6 ft. high. In June of this year the aviary contained a
female White-crowned Pionus, an aged male Ringneck, a female Pacific
Black-tailed Conure (see Avicultural Magazine, vol. 75, 128 for a full
description of this bird) and a male Red-bellied Conure of the sub-species
chiripepe. Earlier in the year and for the two previous years the latter had
paired with a Pearly Conure (P. perlata) but the result was always eggs
which contained chicks dead in the shell. A few weeks previously the
hen Pearly had been removed from the aviary and provided with a mate
of her own species.
The male Red-bellied then turned its attention to the Black-tailed
Conure, whose mate died in January I 97 1 * The two birds took over a
nest-box which stands on the aviary floor and measures 20 in. high and
9J in. square. I believe that the first egg was laid on 13th June but I
did not inspect the nest before going away for a week a few days later.
On my return there were five eggs.
The first of these probably hatched on 8th July, the incubation period
of Pyrrhuras being 26 days. On that day, the Ringneck, the father of
many chicks in his younger days, was seen sitting on the nest-box perch

and looking into the nest, no doubt hearing a squeaking chick. Also on
that day, I had no choice but to introduce my male Purple-bellied Parrot
(.Triclaria malachitacea) into the aviary. It had previously shared the
next enclosure with a male Roseate Cockatoo but on obtaining a mate for
the Roseate, the Purple-bellied had to be removed. It was with some
misgivings that I introduced the Purple-bellied into the aviary but no
other accommodation was available. However, his presence did nothing
to disrupt the harmony of the aviary.
The next day I inspected the box to find one chick covered with long
white down. The nest was then inspected daily and the chicks were
handled daily from an early age. On ioth July there were two chicks,
i third hatched on the 12th and on the 15th there were four chicks. The
remaining egg probably contained a chick dead in the shell.
The growth rate of the fourth chick was very much slower than that
)f the other three and I was not surprised to find it dead when it was about
:wo weeks old. At that age the other chicks were covered with dark grey
down but this one was almost naked. The eyes of the chicks opened
when they were about 11 days old and the hen ceased to brood them during
he day when they were about two weeks old. At four weeks they were
jeen to preen themselves. Two showed no distress at being handled
vhile the third (a hen?) always struggled and even attempted to bite on
some occasions.
Not an advocate of hybrid breeding, I was, nevertheless, interested
0 see whether the young hybrids would take after one parent or whether
hey would show features of both. One of the first areas to show colour
vas the bend of the wing which was mainly orange in the eldest and red
vith a few flecks of yellow in the youngest two. As they feathered,
lowever, it became apparent that in every other aspect they resembled the
nale parent, the Red-bellied Conure. The bend of the wing and the
inder wing-coverts are scarlet in the hen and green in the cock.
As the young hybrids grew the area of colour on the bend of the wing
eemed to decrease in prominence until at the time of writing (3rd Septem-
&amp;gt;er) the colour is barely perceptible in two, which have part of the small
eathers at the bend of the wing orange. In the third youngster, this area
3 scarlet and slightly more extensive but not very prominent. In other
espects they resemble the male parent except that the barring on the
ipper breast is less prominent and less colourful, as in young Red-bellied
mnures; also, the ear-coverts are greenish rather than buff and there is
&amp;gt;nly a suggestion of maroon on the abdomen. In size they are slightly
arger than the hen but a little smaller than their male parent.
Young Pyrrhura conures often leave the nest for short periods only at
irst, returning immediately imagined danger threatens. The first of the
ybrids probably fledged on 28th August but it was not seen to leave the
est until 31st August when it returned after a short period in the aviary.
)n 2nd September I removed all three young from the nest-box but two

soon returned, although they were fully developed and perfectly able to
fly- .
Pyrrhura Conure chicks are very easy to rear. Soaked millet sprays,
one each morning and evening, and extra apple and carrot were provided
during the rearing period, also sponge cake soaked in nectar to which was
added a multivitamin preparation. The usual dry seeds, sunflower,
canary, white millet and niger were available but were hardly touched
during the rearing period. This coincided with several weeks of almost
no rainfall so no wild greenfoods could be supplied.
I have a large number of references to hybrid parrot breedings but 1
regrettably few give details of the appearance of the resulting hybrids:
In Lovebirds and Australian Parrakeets the result is often an unattractive
plumage pattern which shows features of both parents. I was therefore
pleased to find that the Pyrrhuras resembled one parent. The hybrid
breedings in which this has been the case include a male Festive Amazon
Parrot ( Amazona festiva) paired to a Yellow-billed Amazon (A. collaria ), :
whose three young all resembled the cock and the breeding of a hen
Vernal Hanging Parrot ( Loriculus vernalis) with a Blue-crowned Hanging
Parrot (L. galgulus ) where the young took after the hen in appearance.
While visiting Clifford Smith of Denholme earlier this year he pointed to
what appeared to be a Yellow-fronted Amazon ( Amazona ochrocephala
ochrocephala) and, to my surprise, asked me what it was. It transpired
that its parents were a Blue-fronted Amazon (A. aestiva ) and a Yellow-1
front.

My hen Hawk-headed Parrot is eight years old. She was one of my

lad almost given up hope of obtaining a cock bird. I had two more
t these were also hens. Then I managed to get a young cock which
tow six years old.
Phis year (1972) is the first in which there has been any sign of nesting,

tare. It was put in two years ago, close under the roof of the flight,
ced sideways.
)n 30th April two eggs were found in the nest. The cock bird was
y noisy and upset, so it was decided to close this range of aviaries to
one, except at feeding times, since the hen left the nest every time she
rd the male distressed. Had we not closed this range of aviaries to

I have hand-raised several North American hummingbird chicks am
maintained them through the first year; some to the threshold of aduj
plumage, others through the molt into the fully adult condition. There h
much of interest to relate in both situations.
The " hero " of my story is a male Black-chinned hummingbiri
Archilochus alexandri ; a species native to western United States. Thi
particular bird hatched in a garden at Bakersfield, Ca. Other immaturdi
have been maintained simultaneously--also native Californians; Selasphon
seisin the Allen's hummingbird, and Calypte anna.
The A. alexandri eggs were first sighted by the resident homeownt
on 25th April 1971; one hatched on 30th April 197 1 ) other on 2n
May 1971. Bakersfield had heavy rainstorms on the 4th, 6th and iot
of May; and the mother bird disappeared as of 14th May. The residei
then began to feed, using a commercial product with 27% protein ad
some vitamins and minerals, which is designed as an outdoor supplemen
for wild birds, not as a maintenance diet. The homeowner did nd
contact San Francisco Zoo at this time and was unaware of more complej
formulas. She did not bring the nestlings indoors, but spoonfed thed
in their nest in the garden from 15th through to 29th May. She believd
she fed about once per hour, sometimes oftener. The elder chick begd
to flutter and exercise its wings on the 29th and at that point the nest Wi
brought indoors. By 3rd June, this chick was self-feeding and fl\ing, bi
the younger gaped for food for an additional 12 days and did not leave tf
nest for three days more thereafter. In observations on North America
hummingbirds, the normal nestling stage appears to be 3-4 weeks; th
male chick spent nearly six weeks in his nest. Greenwalt believes nestlii
stage varies with adequacy of nutrition, and this observation tends i
support that view. :
Five days after " Alex " had abandoned his nest, the resident broug
both fledglings to the San Francisco Zoo; she feared they could not " mal
it " in the wild, and I'm certain she was right. Alex had, during h
extended spoonfeeding days, become encrusted with syrupy slop. On&amp;lt;
flying and perching, he had diligently preened all offending feathe
completely out; thus was bare-breasted as a go-go dancer from chin
" navel" (had he one!!). Bright pink tender, irritated flesh could alj
be seen across his upper shoulders and on the back of his skull. (^9

she looks just as she did during the first year, substantiating my belief oi
her femininity based on behavioral observation. With S. sasin (four chick!
from three nests raised to free flying stage); three were male as evidenced
by (a) occasional sprouting of an iridescent gorget feather (orange in thii
species) during their first summer-fall, and (b) territorial acrobatics am
vocalizations. The one S. sasin chick believed to be female did no
display, and unlike the female alexandri , she did not utilize a territona
" song " only a " chip-chip-chip " warning sound. Another mdicato
of sex may have been the aggressive Alex's persistent attempts to cour
her, which unsought attentions may have hastened her death Iror
exhaustion at six months of age. !
How does one distinguish between female or immature A. alexandt
and Calypte anna individuals? Both are pearly-grey with slightl
iridescent backs and shoulders (green). If size is not a sufficient clu
(C. anna tends to be larger and stockier) voice is. Tonal quality an
rhythm of both territorial calls and in-flight chippermgs are easil
distinguishable to those attuned to hummingbird voice. Similarity &amp;lt;
territorial vocalizations point to common background and close recei
relationships between these genera, while distinguishable differences 1-
rhythm and tone are suggestive of species recognition releasers in sympatr
species. C. anna has a sweeter, more bell like tone in its " chip-chip-chip
and the territorial challenge has a ringing, chortling quality.
Tail wagging in flight is equally pronounced in alexandri and ann,
less noticeable in sasin which appears to have a faster wing beat and le
fluttery flight style. Tail action varies with speed, however.
The " whine " when disturbed at night is common to all three specie
it can be a most piteous, alarming sound--when first I picked up a bi
from its perch in the dark I nearly dropped it at the sudden and u
expected heart-stopping wail. But the chick clung to my hand (i
attempt to fly in the dark) and allowed itself to be placed in a cage
safe keeping. Within a short time, each Blackchin had learned to expt
my finger lightly touching its chest in the dark, and would dutifu
climb aboard to be carried away to a cage perch--locked in for the hou
I was at work; thus assured an ample and unchallenged food supj
each day. The Allen chicks never became that tame. All my chi(i
when in good health would be instantly alert whenever a light was turn!
on. Exceptions to this were rare and explainable. One, a flightk
invalid, as he began to fail, spent longer and longer periods in torp&amp;lt;:
once a healthy chick, found in torpor when I came home at night, vj
found to have somehow been shorted in food supply that day wj
insufficient fuel, he was conserving his energy.
At this date, I no longer cage the two remaining in my care (male a-
female alexandri )--their " aviary " consists of my bedroom-bath, w
perching branches supplied in vases; sometimes fuchsias from the gar *\0x25A0
always open-doored cages with several containers of food; fruit ffi

^t present, I am wondering if the male-female alexandri will breed in
bedroom or if space is sufficiently cramped that his modified aerial
plays will fail to trigger her recognition and acceptance. It seems as
shall have to wait another year, however, since these birds were
arated during the crucial spring breeding months and currently
.ear to be disinterested in mating. Both are adamantly territorial
arding food supplies.

Again we had fine breeding successes in our Flamingo colony: five
European Flamingos (Phoenicopterus ruber roseus) and four Chilear
Flamingo ( Phoenicopterus chilensis) were hatched. 1
Interesting newcomers are three Crested Screamers (Chauna chavaria)
Even zoologists took several decades to recognize these long-legged bird
as relatives to ducks and geese. The native land of the Crested Screamer
is South America (Colombia and Venezuela) where they live in forest
rich in water. They are armed with sharp spurs at the wings (meta
carpalia). During mating time they fight fiercely with these arms and b
aimed wing-strokes they may even put lesser carnivora to flight. Hand
reared young quickly become tame. Since they utter loud warning call
as soon as they see an enemy (hence their English name: Screamers) the
are often kept as " watch dogs " in chicken yards.
Owing to the successes in breeding and raising birds, the Berlin Zoo gc
on loan two White-Eared Pheasants ( Crossoptilon crossoptilon) hatched i
the Jersey Zoo (Channel Islands) which is famous for its fine breedin
successes of these valuable birds. Since it seemed dangerous, in vie
of disease, to concentrate such a rare bird species in only one place, th
owners decided to send a pair to Berlin. The Pheasants meanwhile seei
to have got accustomed quite well to their spacious aviary.
In addition to the above-mentioned hatchings and new arrivals thei
were hatched: three Southern Red-billed Whistling Ducks ( Dendrocygt
autumnalis discolor ), five Black Swans ( Cygnus atratus ), two Black-backe
Radjah Shelducks ( Tadorna r. radjah ), three Andean Crested Duel
(Lophonetta specular oides alticola), six Tufted Ducks [Ay thy a fuliguh
two Nepal Kalijs (Gennaeus l. leucomelanus), two Blue Crowned Pigeoi

By P. J. S. Olney
The main breeding season of 1972 has now drawn to a close and despite
e efforts of vandals and egg-stealers to thwart our aims there have been
number of notable successes. Owls, as is now usual, have been one
the most successful groups and seven species or sub-species have
ared young. These include Savigny's and Kenya Eagle Owls,
)yssinian and African Spotted Eagle Owls, Snowy Owls, a West African
ood Owl and a Barn Owl. It was particularly pleasing to rear four
.vigny s Eagle Owls as the parents had only been introduced to each
her a few months previously. It was however saddening to have one of
e almost fledged youngsters stolen when their aviary was broken into
[ring the night.
The most exciting event was the rearing of a Blue-backed Manakin
)m 3 i pair in the Tropical House. This is thought to be the first breeding
captivity in the world and a more detailed account will be published
er in the Avicultural Magazine. It was an event not without
oblems for the young bird left the nest before it could properly fly and
sre was considerable danger of it either drowning in the moat, being
)dden on or being snatched up by our ever-pressing public. Mother
d child were removed to the safety of a Bird House cage and the rest of
adolescence has passed without incidence.
Other successful rearings have included Jerdon's Imperial Pigeons,
hite-cheeked Turaco, Bristle-crowned, Malayan Glossy and Superb
irlings, Sacred Ibis and Hawaiian Geese. The tree in which the
hite-cheeked Turacos of the Snowdon Aviary had previously bred in
llapsed during a storm, and a wooden scaffolding was erected over which
i still flourishing creeper was persuaded to grow. Fortunately the
iracos accepted this man-made edifice and nested again in amongst the
ieper.
Species new to the Collection have included Red-throated Bee-eaters
d James s Flamingoes. This means the Collection now has all known
sties of flamingo on view.
Species of especial interest which have been received into the Collection
ce the beginning of the year include: two Short-eared Owls from Cal-
J Zoo, White-fronted Bee-eaters, Red-headed Tits, a Laughing Falcon,
0 captive-bred Desert Eagle Owls and an Avocet. This latter bird was
ind injured in Cornwall in early February and it was quickly obvious
it it would never again be able to fend for itself in the wild. It had
stained a compound fracture of the wing which necessitated amputation.
iis was carried out in the Zoo Hospital, and the patient made a remarkably
ick recovery. It has now settled down well, has caused no problems
feeding and has indeed stimulated some display behaviour from the

P. J. S. OLNEY--NOTES FROM LONDON ZOO
two much older Avocets which originally came from Copenhagen Zoo
The aviaries near the Bird House, known as the Peafowl Aviaries, hav&amp;lt;
been completely renovated and replanted. They now house an interesting
and colourful collection including Scarlet Ibis, Roseate Spoonbills
Ross's and Knysna Turacos, Great Indian Hornbills, Kookaburras anc
Blue and Green Peafowl.
As management techniques improve and our knowledge of wha
individual species require increases, so the symptoms of old age botl
before and after death become more common. Often it has to be explainec
to the public that apparent ill-health is in fact mainly the sluggishness o
senility. Though at times we feel we run a geriatric unit our genera
policy on euthanasia is that it is only necessary when a bird shows obviou:
signs of distress or pain. The following old birds have died since the las
Zoo Notes were written. The length of time the bird was in the Collec-
tion is given in brackets, though for many this will be less than their rea
age. The last three species were hatched in the zoo and their true age
are therefore known.

Two Casqued Hornbills have been reared successfully at " Birdworld ",
arnham, Surrey. The female was sealed into her nest by the male in
lay and emerged with her two youngsters exactly four months later.
A pair of another species, the Giant Indian Hornbill, were not so
lccessful at " Birdland ", Bourton-on-the-Water and L. W. Hill writes,
The Giant Indian Hornbills went to nest in March again and we had
reat hopes but the male was so impatient that he broke open the nesting
ole and entered the nesting box. He broke the egg and emerged with
le unborn chick which he dropped in front of us ".

Malcolm Ellis sends further news of the breeding of Ross's Turaco in a
airobi aviary. He writes, " The article from the East African Standard
mcerning the breeding of Ross's Turaco which was quoted in the " News
id Views " section of the magazine was sent by me to Colin Harrison
1 long ago that I cannot remember very much about it. I think, how-
r er, that I should set the record straight as to the likelihood of this
presenting a first recorded successful breeding, for unfortunately, the
lick died before becoming independent. When I visited the aviary this
eek (August 1972) the female was incubating once again. This time
e aviary has been divided into two with a wire partition, with the male
rd housed in one half and his sitting mate in the other. They have a
~ ar view of each other but the male is prevented from interfering in the
;sting activities. I believe he was responsible for the first attempt
'ling. ' ' Malcolm Ellis promises to send further news of the latest attempt
rich, if it proves successful, will not represent a first recorded breeding
Ross's Turaco, after all, because it has been bred successfully in the
riogne Zoo and the event was recorded in the Avicultural Magazine
out two years ago.

International Zoo Yearbook include a number of items on birds. The
current volume (1972) has accounts of the breeding of the Kiwi and the
Australian Owlet-Nightjar ( Aeogotheles cristatus) at Sydney Zoo. The
latter appears to represent the first breeding of a member of this family,
and with the breeding of the Tawny Frogmouth at Wassenaar some years
ago and Heinroth's famous success with the Common Nightjar breeding
on the dining room rug, this seems to be only the third success with species
of Caprimulgiformes . Other articles concern the hand-rearing of Ostriches
and Rheas, breeding the Golden Eagle in Topeka Zoo and Choughs at
Paignton Zoo, artificial insemination of the Copper Pheasant and notes
on the display and nest-building of the Sickle-billed Bird of Paradise at&amp;gt;
Chester Zoo. The previous volume (1971) has a little more space
devoted to birds and includes a record of a second captive-bred generation
of White Pelicans in East Berlin Zoo, notes on hand-rearing a Stanley
Crane and a IVIacaw hybrid, the use of canthaxanthm to maintain red
plumage at Bronx Zoo, North American Grouse as zoo exhibits and
unilateral patagiectomy as a method of preventing flight in birds. The
last is a surgical operation for larger birds, requiring skill in surgical
techniques, but is said to prevent flight without removing the tip of the
wing.

The Orange-bellied Grass Parrakeet is undoubtedly the rarest membe
of the genus Neophema. In recent years it has been observed in the wile

from time to time of its successful breeding in captivity but none hav

Unfortunately the hen stops brooding when the chicks are about ten
day old and the winter chicks die of exposure. In early Apiil I was certain
that they had laid again--which would have been their fourth successive
clutch. The hen stayed in the box and there had been much mating
and feeding. Nothing materialized, she stopped being broody and I had
to wait until ioth July before she laid the fourth clutch. The chicks are
now six weeks old. At three weeks the smallest chick showed no increase
in weight over a three day period and so I hand-fed it on Farex and milk
and it began to put on weight. After four days I discontinued and it
flourishes. The growth of this chick duplicates that of the single chick
raised last year but the other two older ones have progressed more
rapidly and look like leaving the nest a fortnight before the youngest.
I still have four Sun Conures. Two finger-tame youngsters are still
in ' baby plumage ' with many green feathers on the back and wings
and less orange on the chest and neck. The other ' pair ' have moulted
into two almost identical males! So it will be some time before I can hope
to breed them for it appears that Conures take two or three years to reach
maturity. As for my Hawk-headed Parrots, comparison of mine with
Mrs. Howard's breeding pair convinces me that they are a pair. The
male has a far more extensive patch of red in the tail and the iris is yellow
in contrast to the brown of the hen. Like Blue-rumped parrots they
prefer the ' stone ' of Hawthorn berries to almost any other food."
Parrakeet breeders throughout Europe are familiar with the superb
collection owned by Lady Baillie and kept in a magnificent range of
aviaries at Leeds Castle in Kent. The fact that no description of the
collection or accounts of the events taking place in it have ever been
published in the Avicultural Magazine has always been to me a source
of regret. I am pleased, therefore, that this year J. D. Money, the Agent,
has given me permission to include a summary of their 1972 breeding

I fact that almost all the birds are in pairs in large outdoor aviaries,

sser Sulphur-ciested, Citron-crested and Leadbeater's Cockatoos;
low-fronted, Double Yellow-headed and Vinaceous Amazons and
, ican Grey Parrots. This year Blue-headed Parrots nested and pro-
ved fertile eggs which the hen incubated assiduously but the embryos
d on the point of hatching.
t is more than two years since an article by C. Smith on his success in
eding the Double Yellow-headed Amazon appeared in the Avicultural
gazine. The Council of the Society has still not decided whether its
dal should be awarded for a first breeding because it cannot decide
sther the Double Yellow-headed Amazon is a true species or a sub-
cies. It certainly looks very different from any other Amazon species
., in any case, the breeding is a particularly meritorious one. Perhaps
members of the Council would be better employed and serve
:ulture better if we gave more time to considering how to improve
magazine and make membership of the Society more attractive!

ENCYCLOPAEDIA OF AVICULTURE. Vol. 2. Edited by A
Rutgers and K. A. Norris. London: Blandford Press, i 97 2 * D
The first volume of the English edition of this encyclopaedia w&amp;lt;
published two years ago, and covered a systematic series of bird familit
from the ostriches to the pigeons. The second of the three volumes
now published and continues the sequence; dealing with parrots, cuckoo
touracos, owls, nightjars, swifts and hummingbirds.
In format and content this volume is very similar to the first. It h;
one special feature in that, recognising the importance to many avicultu
lists of the parrot family, the editors have devoted nearly three-quarte
of the volume to it, and have given an entry for every species. Th
includes a brief description of the adult male and female; subspecies a
listed, and in many cases the distinctive differences are given, and in son
instances distinct subspecies frequently kept in aviaries are given separa
entries. In this extensive coverage of the family the volume is probab
at present unique.
There is an introductory section on the keeping and feeding of parroi
and additional general summaries in the text for some of the major grou
such as the Amazons. The Budgerigar has a special section which includ
information on colour breeding and establishing liberty flocks, and "
the Fancy; and there are also several colour plates devoted to rath
improbable ideals in colour and patterns of the domestic bird.
All the species entries in the book give common names in Englis
German, French and Dutch; a brief statement of distribution in the wil
a description; and a general text, scanty in a few instances, which indue
notes on the birds' lives in the wild and information on keeping a
breeding in aviaries; the last sometimes including extensive quotation
published accounts. My only reservation here is that some of the inforn
tion is quoted from rather early accounts, and might not be wholly appl
able at the present time.
In general the text provides a useful source of general information
these birds and the keeping of them, and it is the text that is the vital p
of the book. This does not excuse the fact that the illustrations
consistently poor. The 32 black and white plates are a mixture of sn
photographs and very reduced reproductions of Gould's plates, incons
tently selected. The line drawings in the text often give a very poor i&amp;lt;
of a bird's appearance and appear to be copies of the iqth-centi
illustrations. By cross-checking with the monochrome plates one fit
that a number are bad copies of Gould originals which were done fr
skins with little knowledge of the live birds. Some of the 23 colour pk
are by Slijper, over-simplified but fairly accurate except for bac
portrayed head shapes. Others, by van den Broecke, show shag
plumaged and over-gaudy birds. Plates 6 and 7 with a Lear's Mat
in one style facing a Hyacinthine Macaw in the other permit an assessnt
of both artists. The Leadbeaters and Moluccan Cockatoos on the p

so used as a cover illustration indicate the results of using old artists'
ipressions as sources in preference to modern photographs of live birds
The section on hummingbirds reflects the increasing avicultural interest
this family. There is an introductory section on keeping and transport
ir I ean Dealcour and others on torpidity, and breeding by K A Norris
he family is a very large one, and the majority of genera are represented
the text by only one or two species. The touracos have eight pages and
air amount of avicultural information for the space allowed. The owls
ve only a dozen pages, although much of this is devoted to information
keeping them. The text illustrations for the latter are lamentable.
The remaining families are considered of little importance to avicultur-
s and have relatively brief treatment. The section on the owlet-
*htjars indicates the difficulty of dealing with rarer species in a work of
is kind. The comments appear to be based on the assumption that
let-nightjars feed mainly on the wing and would present considerable
ablems. In fact they will readily take food from the ground and have
:ently been bred in Sydney Zoo. Since Heinroth's breeding of the
'htjar is referred to, it is surprising that reference to the four volumes of
e Vogel Mitteleuropas , with all their information on a great range of
ecies, has been omitted from the final bibliography.
In general this new volume of the encyclopaedia is likely to be a useful
d permanent source of reference, especially for the general aviculturist
to lacks access to a range of books on birds of various regions, or who is
ely to need urgent information on some group of birds with which he is
familiar. It is likely to be of special value to the parrot specialist,
*art from the parrots, one is left with the feeling that more could have
m done if effort had been directed towards a more general coverage
her than an arbitrary selection of a limited number of species, and
istrations concerned with points of identification rather than inaccurate
istry.

In the July-August 1972 issue of the Avicultural Magazine, I read an intere
tine article entitled " The Coronet Hummingbirds " that was written by Mr. A.
Mobbs. In this he noted that on several occasions he had observed species
the Genus Boissonneaua resting on one foot and that he doubted that the Coront
actually slept in this position since both feet would be required for stability,
is probably the general rule for both wild and captive birds. However, it rrug
be interesting to note that the Philadelphia Zoological Garden received a Chestni
breasted Coronet, Boissonneaua matthewsii in August 1970. Upon its arriv
it was found to be missing its left leg. The specimen was immediately placed

several specimens and species of humming and non-hummingbirds. Since t
bird is alive and healthy at the time of this writing, it is obvious that it has adapt

Another example of a bird adapting to this type of situation is an Emen.

This specimen has since been living in a large flight area which exhibits vane.

The ability for some birds to adapt to this type of handicap in both the capti

BREEDING THE BLUE-BACKED MANAKIN
CHIROXIPHIA PAREOLA AT LONDON ZOO

The Blue-backed Manakin Chiroxiphia pareola has the characteristics
a typical member of its family, the Pipridae. It is a short-toed, stout-
)died, short broad-billed bird about the size of a House Sparrow Passer
mesticus. In this species the sexes are strikingly different. The male
predominantly velvety-black with a sharply contrasting pale-blue back
id a flat somewhat triangular shaped red skull-cap. The legs are pale
ange and the eyes are black. The female is far less ornate and is mainly
ive-green above with somewhat paler underparts. They are fruit
ters and are found in or by the forests of South America and Tobago.
 |A Pair of these beautiful birds have been kept in the Tropical House
London Zoo since 1971--the female since May and the male since
&quot;cember. The house has a flying space of approximately 65 ft. x 45 ft.
th a height of 12 ft. The temperature averages 7o*F (2i*C), and during
)st of the year there are normal hours of daylight.
The birds rarely appeared to be close together and it was with some
rpnse that the female was seen to be sitting on a nest in late May 1972.
le nest was an ordinary canary-type plastic pan, 4 in. diameter and 2 in.
sp, suspended from the wall some 6 ft. from ground level. The
st-pan had been filled with moss, dead leaves and plant fibres, and the
aale sat, with most of her body exposed, over a small indentation in
ich lay the two eggs. The eggs were heavily speckled with chocolate-
&amp;gt;wn spots on a bluish-buff background. One egg measured 25 mm.
[7 rnm. and weighed 2*2 grams. Unfortunately the female was already
ubating when the occupied nest was first noticed and no accurate
ubation period could be recorded. It was thought to be about 17 days.
)nly the female incubated and the male appeared to take no further
t in the proceedings after copulation though in a second attempt at
ting he was seen to fly to the nest-pan, settle and begin to shape the
&amp;apos; by turning round while sitting. This behaviour does not seem to
e been recorded before as all accounts stress that the female carries out
nesting activities alone.
)ne egg hatched on the 5th June, the other proved to be infertile.
- youngster was fed by the female alone on fruit coated with vionate--

mainly bananas, pear, grape and tomato. Mealworms we" "*" to ^be
taken to the nest, but were not seen to be given. The fruit &quot;&amp;apos;as earned
in the mouth and bill, and during the first two weeks appearedJo be
regurgitated but later was fed direct. The partly fledged youngster left
the nest after 14 days though it could only flutter from perch to perch
and frequently ended up on the ground. As there was considerable
danger of it being trodden on, drowned in the moat, or snatc ^ ed U P J _
visitor, mother and child were removed to the safety of the Bird House.
Here it remained dependant on the mother for a further 14 days, by
which time it could fly. The feathering of the head was the last plumage
to appear and even when fully winged the adolescent still had a partly
bald appearance. Otherwise it was very similar to the fema e, wi
green feathering above, and paler plumage below. The legs were pa
pink rather than the orange of the adult.
The female was returned to the Tropical House and further nesting
activity was seen after three weeks. Two eggs were laid, but proved tc
be infertile. , , . . u
Recently, at the beginning of October, courtship behaviour has bee.
seen and this followed closely that described by Gilhard (1959) ant
Snow (1963, 1971) from birds observed in the wild. As there was on^
one male involved in this case the interesting and well-recorded
ordinated courtship dance in which pairs of males would play an equa
part could not be observed.
Two forms of stereo-typed display were seen. In the first the ma
made short fluttering jumps from a low horizontal steel pipe. * ^
ground around this perch was clear of vegetation and fallen leaves, tho g
it was not known if the bird had cleared away obstructions, ^ported*
the wild (Gilliard 1959, Snow 1963). The bird would # ".
perch, rise into the air and come down again a short &amp;lt;distance from wh1
it started--always it seemed to end up on the perch facing the oppos
direction to which it started. In the air it would give a low whirring
buzzing call. The display did not last for very long, and it looked,
though the jumps became more rapid and less high as the display contmu
until finally the bird flew away from the area.
The second type of display was quite different from the J um P- d 'JP :
and appeared to be a prelude to copulation. The female was pre
but partly hidden by vegetation at one end of the display perch,
male rose above the perch, facing the female and almost hovered
shallow rapid rather butterfly-like wing beats. He then landed I
perch in front of the female with his whole body held at an ang ,
his pale-blue back and red skull-cap were prominently disp aye .
Stereo-typed display occurred three times before he flew into the vegetati
where he presumably mounted the female. Immediately afterwards
flew the length of the house and then began to feed.

Ernberiza bruniceps is sexually dimorphic; the males are " chestnut "
le chestnut pigment is restricted, however, to the whole head and throat;
is extends onto the upper breast.) The sides of the neck and entire
iderparts are bright yellow; the upperparts, mantle and back are olive-
llow streaked with black; the rump and upper tail-coverts are yellow
d unstriped. Wings and tail are brown with pale edges to the coverts
d there is no white on the tail. One of our males has the head and
&amp;apos;oat reddish gold instead of the usual chestnut. There is, according
H. Witherby (1938), great individual variation in the males, especially
the colour of the crown, which is from bright chestnut to golden yellow.
The adult female is brown above, streaked with darker brown; the
derparts are a mixture of buff and yellow and the rump is yellowish-
:en with slight brown flecks. The chestnut plumage worn by the
le undoubtedly presents the fully adult dress and it would seem from
r observations that it is not acquired until the bird enters into its
ond year.
nge and Habitat
Although only a rare vagrant to the British Isles, the Red-headed
nting has quite a wide distribution in the Palaearctic region, breeding
the Aral-Caspian, Transcaspia, Kirghiz Steppes, Turkestan, Semi-
atinsk to Altai region, north-east and east Persia, north Baluchistan
1 Afghanistan. On migration and in winter from September to March
s found in Sind, the Punjab, Rajputana, the North West Frontier and
shmir, through the central provinces south to the Nilgiri hills. Whistler

W. H. TIMMIS--BREEDING THE RED-HEADED BUNTING
(IQ 4 Q) writes that on the spring passage, vast clouds of Red-headed
Buntings along with Black-headed (. Emberiza melanocephala) occur amon^
the ripening crops; on being flushed they fly into the nearest tree, making
it appear a yellow mass, and it is noteworthy that these flocks then cons*
almost entirely of males. These flocks are very bold and are only driver
with difficulty from a field where they have decided to feed, and owing t&amp;lt;
their numbers they can be responsible for a great deal of damage. In th
autumn they also do a certain amount of damage to jowar and simila
crops but on that passage they are not usually so noticeable. Out of K
or so species of Buntings occurring in India the Red-headed is possibl;
the most numerous. . .
It has no subspecies but in the south its breeding range overlaps tha
of the Black-headed Bunting (. Emberiza melanocephala) and Paludan (194c
records that hybrids between melanocephala and hruniceps are know,
from the region south-east of the Caspian Sea, males having heads blac:
and chestnut-brown admixed. Meinertzhagen (r 954 ) writing abot
melanocephala in the Balkans and east Afghanistan, where it hybridise
freely with bruniceps, states that the latter may well be a race of Emberiz
melanocephala. e
As an accidental wanderer, the Red-headed Bunting has been foun
in Italy, Belgium, Heligoland, Great Britain and Eire. It inhabits ope
areas with scrub, cultivations with bushes and thick weeds, also an
desert and steppe land with areas of water supporting reedbeds ar
bushes. Outside the breeding season it is found largely in cultivate
areas and scrub jungle.
Housing ,
Two pairs of Red-headed Buntings were purchased on the 26th Ms
1971 and after a veterinary examination they were placed in an outsu
aviary measuring 49 ft. 10 in. longxioft. 6 m. wide x 5 ft. 7 m. hig
At one end there is a wooden shed measuring 10 ft. 6 in. wide x 10 ft. 101
long x 12 ft. high, which has a clear plastic sheet roof. The policy
screening the faeces of all new additions to the collection has prow
especially valuable in the case of new bird arrivals where considerate
worm egg burdens are very often seen. It must also be stated, howev*.
that on certain occasions exotic specimens are received with parasr:
burdens which do not respond to treatment during the acclimatisati 1
period. The outside flight is heavily planted with shrubs. The:
include Privet (. Ligustrum avalifolium ), Golden Privet (Ligustrum avahfolni
marginatum " aureum "), Holly ( Ibex aquifoliaceae ), Laurel {Lawni*
(Polyganum cuspidatum), Gorse (Ulex europaeus) and Honeysuch
(Lonicera nitida ). A large shallow concrete pool is situated in the cenf
of the outside flight around which are several types of rushes and sedg
One half of the flight is covered in short grass, the rest being washed rr|
sand. Branches cut from beech trees are fixed at various positions b&amp;lt;-

the outside flight and inside shed. Other foreign birds kept in the

No breeding activity was observed at all during 1971, the Buntings
ling into moult in late September. During May 1972 one of the
males was seen carrying nesting material into a dense clump of Honey-
ckle (Lomcera nitida). Upon examination, a completed nest was found,
is being abandoned two days later due to Weavers taking a great deal
the nest matenal. The female started building a second nest a few
ys later, this being well concealed in Honeysuckle which had grown
er a short gorse bush. The nest was completed in a little over four
ys and was a very untidy cup of grass mixed with dead leaves and long
&quot;ms of Lucerne. It was lined with hair and fine grassy fibres. Most
the nesting material had been placed in the flight for the Weavers and
hydahs, etc.
The work of building appeared to have been carried out by the female
)ne. I noticed on several occasions that if the nesting material was
llected near to the nest site, the male would perch high on a branch
arby, calling very softly, unless engaged in feeding or territorial disputes.
1 with our Yellow-breasted Buntings (Timmis, 1972), when the female
:d-headed Bunting wandered further from the nest, she was generally
:ompanied by the male, but he was never seen to take an active part in
st building.
Incubation was carried out by the female only. In a total of over 60
Its to the nest, I always found the female incubating, except on two
:asions when no bird was present. Three eggs were laid at intervals
a day; the hatching was completed in just under 22 hours, after an
:ubation period of 14 days. A very interesting observation was the
y in which the female positioned the eggs, which were visible from the
e and partly from above. Because of this the female put the eggs on
; opposite side of the nest so that they always were out of the line of
ion of any possible intruder.
[ never observed the male feeding the female on the nest during
aibation. The eggs were a ground colour, greyish-white, slightly
&amp;gt;tched with greenish brown and spotted all over with light brownish
i purple markings. One egg which did not hatch was measured in
r veterinary laboratory and measured 21 x 147 mm. In the Handbook
itherby, 1938) Jourdain gives the following measurements of 22 eggs:
ira ge 20x 15*3 mm.; maximum 22*16 and 21*2x 16*5 mm.; minimum
x 15*6 and 20*2 x 14*5 mm.

W. H. TIMMIS--BREEDING THE RED-HEADED BUNTING
Care of Chicks . . r -
The young Buntings were brooded almost continuously for three c
four days after hatching and during this period the male was seen feedm
the female on the nest. After the period of close brooding by the femaL
she sometimes brooded the young when the temperature was quite hig
and at other times she left them uncovered when the air temperature w.
lower; in fact the brooding did not appear to be correlated with a
temperature. The location of the nest, under an umbrella of gon
thorns and Honeysuckle leaves, provided partial protection from tl
direct rays of the sun and from the worst battering of the ram
The nestlings were brownish above and had streaks of blackis - rov
in parts; the throat was yellowish red, turning to whitish yellow on t:
chest and lower body. The food given by the parents to the young f'
the first few days consisted of small insects and soaked seed fed
regurgitation. After about three days the young were fed on caterpi a &amp;apos;
mealworms, maggots and soaked seed. The nestlings eman e t.
constant attention of both parents, calling loudly for more food t:
moment their bills were emptied.
Nest sanitation was carried out by both sexes although it appeared tl
far more was done by the female and faeces lying around the rim ot 1&amp;lt;
nest was removed by the first parent bird to arrive. I found that o,
the female examined the interior of the faeces. The chicks di i
defecate until they were at least 34 hours old, after which they did &amp;lt;
regularly, about every two hours, by raising their cloacas towards the n
of the nest before passing faeces. On some visits to the nest during feedi 1
both the sexes would take a faecal sac and swallow it, but most times t
would fly some distance down the aviary before dropping it. We toi
that the male took very little part in feeding the young until they were ab.
five days old, after which the number of visits in which food was brou
to the nest was approximately equal for the two sexes. If the ten
was on the nest when the male arrived with food, or in some cases it
two birds arrived at the nest together, the female generally took the t)
from the male to give to the young. .
The fledging period was 15 days and at that stage the young Bunt|
looked very like the female, except that they were a shade lighter in co.i
and the bill was greyish-brown above and below. Two Buntings j
the nest and for several days perched quite near to the site occasior
fluttering down onto the ground where they would peck at food whe
fact they were not hungry; they also pecked at markings on leaves an&amp;lt;(
the aviary netting. It appeared to be more curiosity than hunger. 11
young Buntings were hungry they always gaped and begged, even beg]
at food which had fallen on the ground, instead of pecking it up.
The adults continued to feed them for almost two weeks after lea-
the nest, after which time they had gained strength and ability t&amp;lt;
around the aviary and fend for themselves.

Voice
The call of the male is a " chipz-chew " with a pause between syllables
like a rusty gate swinging back and forth. This is delivered from a bush
or tree. In flight the call sounds like " tchirp " in the male and " chawp "
in the female. The song consists of a descending phrase with a kick up
at the end, usually preceded by four or five preliminary notes. The last
phrase is repeated two or three times without a pause; the song has a
number of variants. In flight it runs several times together and also at
times is speeded up. We have on occasions heard birds singing whilst
on the ground.
As described above, the Red-breasted Bunting, Emberiza bruniceps , has
been bred at Chester Zoo. It is believed that this may be a first success.
Any member or reader knowing of a previous breeding of this species
in Great Britain or Northern Ireland is requested to communicate at
once with the Hon. Assistant Editor.

RELEASE OF A CAPTIVE-BRED BARN OWL
[Tyto alba alba)

The release and rehabilitation of captive-bred owls has been achieved
with planned programmes and feeding support of the birds released.
Wayre (1970) has described the method employed for the release and
rehabilitation of Barn Owls (Tyto alba alba) and Little Owls {Athene
noctua vidalii). This consists of the release of the young when fledged
and feeding them every night on top of the aviary, with the parents kept
inside.

Having bred Barn Owls for three seasons (for first year's results see
Trollope, 1971) I decided this year to release one bird as a pilot attempt
at rehabilitation. However, living in a very built up, populous and noisy
area, the aviary feeding technique used by Wayre could only end in

disasater for the released bird. Therefore I had to find a suitable place
for the release, close enough to make nightly feeding visits possible.
What I envisaged was a derelict barn or building of large size near a park,
or similar area, then to release the bird in the building, which would be
used as a feeding site.
This was obviously far from an ideal method, but I thought it worth a
try, having postponed such an attempt the two previous seasons. Local
bird watchers informed me of a derelict house in a builder's yard, near a
large park and golf course, about three miles from where I live. I
obtained permission to use it from the manager of the building firm,
who was most co-operative.
The bird was released on 7th September 1972. It appeared to be a

cock and was the whitest-breasted Barn Owl I have seen, rather paler
than most birds on the dorsal surface. It was from a second generation
of captive breeding and when released was aged 106 days, weighed
12 oz. and wore a leg ring.
Result
Unfortunately the bird left the building on the day of release. 1 his
I think was due to three factors:
1. The bird was too nervous to remain in a fairly busy area.
2. The building was not large enough. \
3. I released it in the wrong part of the building, where escape
</listItem>

was too easy.
I continued to leave food in the house in the forlorn hope that the bird
would return. Neither the bird watchers or myself could see any sigr
of the owl during the following weeks. I contacted the local R.S.P.C.A
clinics in case it had been picked up exhausted or injured.
I was consequently both surprised and pleased to see the bird alive anc
looking fit on the mornings of 8th November 1972 and again on 15th
November 1972. On both occasions it was perched on top of a hawthorr
hedge which borders the golf course about a quarter of a mile from th&amp;lt;
release point. Obviously with the winter ahead the bird has a long wa;
to go before it could be considered rehabilitated. However, the fact thaj
a second generation captive bred owl has survived in feral condition
without feeding support for just over two months, I consider to be worth;
of record.

(Tricholaema diadematum)
By M. D. England (Neatishead, Norfolk, England)
Barbets are close relatives of the woodpeckers and have many of their
n g a gi n g habits. Their reputation for destroying the woodwork in their
viaries, even to the extent of boring through thick wooden walls and
oors, has not made them generally popular with aviculturists, which is
pity, first because they are most interesting birds which well reward
tudy; second because one can suit one's inclinations and have fruit-
ating, insect-eating or omnivorous species; third because in my ex-
erience their destructive capabilities can very largely be kept within
ounds by providing plenty of rotten logs.
The name " barbet " comes from the bristles around the bill (these
an be seen in Plate 2 ) and probably also from the fact that some species
ave tufts of feathers near the base of the upper mandible. All barbets--
nd there are over seventy species--nest in holes, some in natural or
ther bird's boles in trees but most boring their own in rotten timber,
md or earth banks or even perpendicularly downwards in level ground.
My Red-fronted Barbets followed me back in April 1972 from East
frica, where I had arranged to meet Tim Barnley who obtained them
)r me and saw to their transport. In parenthesis I should like to add
lat it would have been impossible for greater care to have been taken

would be if all countries would adopt a similar attitude to the trade in

M. D. ENGLAND-- BREEDING THE RED-FRONTED BARBET
birds they are among the smallest members of the family, being about
nuthatch size though rather shorter and plumper, and their habits and
general deportment might be described as a combination of nuthatch and
small woodpecker. They are generally black above with yellow streaks
and white to yellowish-white below; some birds have the very faintest
trace of brown spots on the lower breast. They have a bright red forei ea
and pale yellow supercilliary stripes shading backwards into white 1 hey
have a moderately long, stout black bill and dark grey legs. The sexes
are alike in plumage.* , ,
When mine first arrived they very obviously disliked the cold of a
British April--or rather the 6o*F at which my bird-room was kept, and
they looked very unhappy until I put an infra-red lamp on them althoug
they fed well from the start. After a week or two they were allowed intc
the flight--24 ft. x 4 ft 6 in.--and, despite miserable weather, the 5
immediately improved. They are not happy in close confinement, evei
though in this case the " confinement " consisted of a section of birdrooir
8 ft x s ft x 4 ft. 6 in. Needless to say I gave them no companions.
It was not long before I was fairly sure that I had two birds of a sex
probably males. One was aggressively dominant to the extent that to
other began to skulk in the shelter, seeming unwilling to go out into to
flight when the other bird was there and only dared to snatch a it o
food while fearfully " looking over its shoulder ". On the other hand
only the dominant bird was noisy while the other has never been hear
utter a sound, but I was pessimistic enough to think that this was due
their very unbalanced relationship rather than to the fact that t ey we
male and female, especially since vicious chasing had begun and 1 ws
beginning to consider the need to separate them. My pessimism gre

However, gloom eased a little when relations improved sufficiently t&amp;lt;
both of them to take turns at boring.
Their method was interesting: each would attack the wood, hammerirt
away until a piece was loosened at one end; this was then seized and toi
off and, when a large beakful was free, it was carried to the far end of t"
flight and dropped on to an ever-increasing heap. Amazingly, sm t
pieces of wood were swallowed and regurgitated on to the heap; practical

The entrance hole was small for the size of the bird--a very tight squeeze,
and was not perfectly round but rather irregular like that of a Willow 1 ,

strained, and the vicious chases were all the more alarming since they did
not culminate in mating, and appeared to be done out of pure spite.
Whatever their cause, there can be no doubt that the female spent a great
deal of her time absolutely terrified of her mate. Mating took place in a
most casual manner, with no preliminary display, after the two birds
had one of their rare periods of sitting peacefully side by side preening.
Far more often than not it was unsuccessful.
Any hope of breeding disappeared when one morning it was seen that
there was a gaping hole in the side of the log: they had opened up the
nest cavity, whether from inside or out we could not tell. So that was
that, and " summer " was fast passing. A new log was put up in place of
the old (they had in fact a choice of five logs in the aviary), but they ignored
it and it seemed as though even their very half-hearted desire to breed had
left them. In a final attempt to stimulate them I cut a hole in the bark
and exposed the soft wood within--immediately they started to bore.
Again they took it in turns, and again they carried their winnings to the
far end of the flight, where they filled their bath with them. Since they
are reputed to favour the vicinity of streams for breeding, one is tempted
to wonder whether this depositing of wood-chippings in their bath was
the equivalent of dropping them in a stream where they would be carried
far away from the vicinity of the nest-site.
Although it was impossible to be quite sure when it started, there was
soon little doubt that incubation was taking place, since frequent nest-
relief was seen. The relieving bird did not by any means always wait
for its mate to leave the nest, but either clung to the tree outside the hole
(presumably making a noise that I could not hear) or went inside and
down to the cavity. Sometimes both were in together for quite long
periods. This made it equally impossible to be sure when hatching took
place, but it was a few days before the 26th August, on which date my
diary reads: " R-f Barbets feeding hard, mainly on chopped lettuce.
Swallow food and regurgitate--do not carry it in bill. Do not always
allow very long for digestion, sometimes as little as two minutes."
For the first few days chopped lettuce and chickweed was the favourite
food, but the youngster's menu was gradually enlarged until it was being
fed on the widest variety of food that I have ever experienced--all, of
course, regurgitated by the parents: chopped lettuce, chickweed, grated
cheese (little), chopped hard-boiled or scrambled egg-yolk, soft food,
chopped raisins and currants, apples, mashed carrot (little), maggots
ifew), mealworms and small locusts. Until 9th September (that is for
over a fortnight) one parent was almost continuously in the nest, and from
1st September faeces were seen to be carried away; presumably it had
been swallowed prior to this.
On 9th September, and thereafter, both parents were off most of the
time, though both continued to visit the hole to feed at frequent intervals--
surprisingly frequent considering that regurgitation was employed.

<bodyText confidence="0.994950622222222" page_id="58078320"  page_num="12" year="" vol="">
During this time persecution of the female by the male intensified, to be
interrupted occasionally by brief periods of truce when courtship-feeding
and mating took place. On 22nd September a youngster was looking out
of the hole and was being fed by the male with egg-yolk in beakfuls, not
swallowed and regurgitated. The female continued to feed by regurgita-
tion, using a rapid " pumping " action with the bill inserted far into the
youngster's gape.
On the 23rd our hopes received a crushing blow--the nest-compartment
had been torn open again and there was no sign of a youngster: a thorough
search of both flight and shelter failed to find even feathers, the nest had
not even any broken egg-shells in it, and the parents seemed completely
unconcerned. I was miserably leaving, after another fruitless search,
when a very faint noise caught my ear--and there was a youngster looking
out of the hole; it had been " up the spout " all the time, clinging between
entrance hole and nest-cavity. That night it descended to the nest to
roost (in full view, of course) and the next morning left it for good.j
Rather unexpectedly it did not return to the hole at night, but roosted out
in the flight with no shelter whatever. Meanwhile, the female parent
had dug herself a roosting hole in another tree, which she continues to use.
As will have been gathered, there was only one youngster, and no
evidence at all of there ever having been more, or more than one egg.
The one which was reared, however, was fully developed on leaving the
nest, and was indistingushable from its parents except on very close
inspection, which showed that the small patch of red on the forehead
which gives the bird its name was replaced by black. A ver)
faint mewing, to human ears audible only from a few feet, whict
was heard on its last day in the hole, and again when it was caught up foi
ringing, is the only sound it has been heard to utter, and its mother neve)
seems to make any sound at all. The male has three calls, one of which--
a not very loud he-he-he--very similar to the call of the Lesser Spotted
Woodpecker, Dendrocopos minor --was heard a few times only when th&amp;lt;
birds first arrived. His main breeding-season call is a rapid version o
the " poo " of a Hoopoe Upupa epops repeated six or more times, often
though not always, with an accelerando towards the end. This is utterec
with the bill pointing downwards and the throat " blown out in ;
similar fashion to hoopoes and coucals. His other call, which is probabk
a contact call and, I suspect, would also be used by the female were sh
not so persistently in a cowed state, is almost exactly a louder version o
the call of an Owl Finch (Bicheno or Double-bar) Poephila bichenovii .,
rasping nasal aark.
Summary
The breeding in an aviary of Red-fronted Barbets Tricholaem&amp;lt;

Birch Betula pendula , but this was left unused after they had broken ope
the nest-cavity. A second hole--in another log of rotten Silver Birch-

was bored by both birds and one youngster was reared in it. This was
fed by regurgitation by both parents, which also shared incubation and
brooding. Incubation and fledging periods could not be ascertained, but
the latter was certainly in excess of 28 days, though probably not much
so. On the last day before the youngster left the nest, the nest cavity was
opened up in a similar fashion to the previous one, as also was the hen's
roosting hole.

By George A. Smith (Peterborough, England)
In my article on nesting and nestling parrots (Avicultural Magazine,
J 972, pp- 155-164) I was foolish enough to write that parrots appear to
make no attempt at nest sanitation. This is certainly not true for Black-
headed Caiques Piomtes melanocephala and with hindsight have reason to
suspect that it is untrue for other parrots. Parent caiques scratch the soiled
litter out of the nest-hole and continually chew splinter from the inside of
the box to refurbish the floor covering. It was only when the supply of soft
wood, nailed inside the box for this purpose, was totally chewed away
that the nest became fouled by the chicks.
This could well be the explanation of two puzzling features of brush-
tongued parrots (Lories). Why do these birds, lapping nectar and eating
soft, yielding vegetable substances need such a powerful bite to their
beaks? Keas, for example, which are the size of a Raven are caught
by an ungloved hand to be leg-rung, or killed for government bounty
money, without giving the handler other than the slightest inconvenience
Jackson, in corres.). I only hold lories, as other parrots, in my naked
land after catching and positioning them in a hand-net as they can give
lasty, blood-drawing bites.
My second perplexity with brushed-tongued parrots was as to why the
Youngsters, in captivity, are almost invariably badly plucked while in the
lest? Some other " sorts " of parrot chew their youngsters' feathers.
Mostly, I feel, for some aggressive reason as the skin is often marked and
he head often suffers; but with lories it is the whole body, save wings and
ail, and the head feathering is left intact making them look as if they had
iad a " pudding-basin hair-cut ".

I now believe, partly proved by the manner in which nest-boxes are
"eaten" by these birds, that in a "natural" nest cavity the parents
would rain-down--by chewing--a periodical shower of parings to absorb
the faeces of the young. The plucking of the chicks can then be seen as
done to " satisfy " this parental instinct. Dilger notes that soiled nests
stimulate parent lovebirds to fetch further quantities of nest litter. This
need to pare would satisfactorily explain the powerful bite of these birds
While on the subject of nests much has been made of a species of motr
whose larvae feed in the nest litter of the Golden-shouldered Parrakee
Psephotus chrysopterygius (e.g. p. 109 in Immelmann's Australia
Parrakeets).
My own nest-boxes commonly house two species of moth: the Clothe:
moth and the Flour-moth--which, if my (schoolboy) memory serves m&amp;lt;
right, is Esphestia kuhniella. The Clothes moth feeding on feathers am
"scruff" and the Flour moth, in its cobweb tube, living on the ncl
organic dust thrown up by the birds. Most damp nest-boxes hav

They also say that Poicephalus parrots pick food items directly up with

its foot. Brockway (1964, Behaviour 22, p. 200) who has made a detaile
study of Budgies says that they make no feeding use of the feet. Son

Because the inability to use the feet is a recent development it would 1
highly improbable if all Budgerigars or grass-parrakeets were mcapab
of using the feet.
But for the two exceptions listed in my article on the use made 1

seen a parrot directly take an item up in the foot. The following lettt,

lay given large quantities of different green food. He would then fly
iown, bite off a clover blossom, grasp it in his foot and eat it just the

ood in this way, although I think dandelion seed-heads would be very
juitable. None of the young have hitherto developed their father's
inique habit, nor have I seen or heard of it before. None of my friends,
nany of whom have fine Neophema collections, have ever seen it among

Wattled Cranes and Demoiselles laid clear eggs, but we reared a Bla&amp;lt;
Crown Crane. Since 1920, when some of those birds first arrived j
Cleres, this is only the second time that eggs have been laid. In 1939
mixed'pair Black x Grey had nested, building in August a large nest
seeds and grass and laying three eggs. They all hatched and the youi
were reared, only to disappear at the beginning of the war.
There are at present in the park and gardens seven Black and ten Gn
Crown Cranes. This year, a pair of Blacks set up a territory and laid close
the fence along the river. The nest was very small and only two eggs we
laid The parents were wary and the female often left the nest, final
deserting the two chipped eggs for some unknown reason. They we
picked up cold, but one chick was saved and successfully hand-reared.
A pair of Black-necked Swans nested twice, first in March, then ag^
in July, after they had reared the first brood. They hatched six, th,
seven cygnets, but reared three and four only, the female killing seveil
chicks after a couple of weeks, a very strange performance.
Two pairs of Cereopsis Geese, each isolated in a large meadow, hatch I
and reared 12 goslings, both in February. Other goslings raised inclu:
Swan, Greylag, Snow, Bar-headed, Giant Canada, Nene, Black Brei,
Magellan and Ashy-headed. Several Emperor and one Ross s chid
died by accident. A special mention must be made of two young. Re-
breasted goslings reared; a poor performance as we have seven pairs
the grounds. One of them is partly albinistic; while the head and neck*
hardly paler than in normal specimens, with the usual complicated pattei
the rest of the plumage is generally grey instead of black, with pa e gn
blotches and white markings. J

clutches clear; the old pair of Australian Radjahs, the last one in Europe as
far as I know, again laid eleven eggs; I am afraid they are past the age of
successful breeding. A brood of n Maned Geese was raised by the
mother.
A number of various ducklings were lost owing to an epidemic of
salmonellosis, for the first time at Cleres, but others were reared, both in
pens and at liberty, including Yellow-billed, Indian Spot-billed,' Pacific-
grey, Philippine and Hawaiian Mallards; Gadwalls, Pantails, Shovellers;
Bahamas; Mandarins and Carolinas; Puna, Silver, Cape, Sharp-winged
Teal; Pochards, Red-heads, White-eyes, Australian White-eyes, New

are handsome, intermediate in shape between the parents, the male a
bright, purplish-chestnut shot with metallic reddish all over.
An interesting incident occurred with an old pair of Silver Teal, which
tiad long been secluded on a small pond for breeding purposes, but had
ailed to produce healthy chicks the last few years. They were released
3 n the lake to make room for a younger pair, the result being a happy one:
:he old birds did rear there three perfect youngsters.
Game birds were not very successful. The world is now so polluted
md infectious diseases so widespread that it becomes difficult to cope with
such dangerous conditions, particularly on grounds where they have been
iept for so long. Only Junglefowl were raised in numbers. Jabouille's
iled, Ceylon and Sonnerat's, and of course the commoner species such as
jlolden, Amherst's, Swinhoe's, Silvers. But we had only a few young
Siamese and Malay Firebacks, two Monals, seven Edwards', many pea-
owl, and one Bare-faced Curassow (C. fasciolata). The Brush Turkeys
lid poorly, although nests were well built and attended, only one chick
:ame out.
Many Pigeons and Doves were reared: Olive (C. arquatrix ), Wongas,
Sar-tailed ( M . unchall ), Mountain Witch, Bleeding-heart, Lemon,
Ironze-winged, and several other more ordinary species.
The number of Parrots kept at Cleres has to be somewhat limited as
ve do not particularly enjoy the bare, unplanted aviaries required by
hese destructive birds. There are however two free-flying Macaws,
emale Red and Blue and Blue and Yellow, plus a somehow crippled male
f the latter species ( ararauna ). No more can be let out as the resident
*irds would drive them away. There was a nice colony of Quaker
'arrakeets at liberty, but local Jackdaws, which breed on the high walls
f the chateau, incessantly attacked them, taking over their huge nests
f twigs, and finally they went away.
Some 20 specially built aviaries are inhabited by Cockatoos (including
^eadbeater's), Macaws (Leah Ambiguous), Amazons and other Parrots
nd Parrakeets. Two Crimson-winged were reared and Bourke's breed

in a large planted flight, as they are almost the sole members of the family
they do not damage vegetation. ,
Seven species of Touracos live at Cleres but only one, Knysna, have
bred successfully this year, two pairs producing six young, three of which
reached maturity. A regrettable accident took place after two young just
out of the nest, were removed when the male, evidently disturbed, killed
^ThrT^Kookaburras were hand-reared, the eggs being removed and
hatched in an incubator, as the parent birds have developed the habit of
devouring the chicks as soon as they are out of the shell.
We had some success with Passerine birds. Over 20 Superb Spreos,
several Diamond Sparrows, and two Baltimore Orioles were raised in the
aviaries, the latter species probably for the first time in Europe. We also
hand-reared five Fairy Bluebirds, three Orange-headed ground Thrushes
and one Fulvous-fronted Parrotbill (.Paradoxorms fulvifrons ), all of them
taken from the nest when eight to ten days old. Several broods of these
species had met with failure in aviaries earlier in the season, the chicks
being killed in the nest by other birds when the mother began to leave
then unattended during the day, or soon after they had left it. Hie
breeding of a small Parrotbill, or Suthora, is probably the first of thal
genus in captivity. All these hand-reared birds are, of course, delightfull)
Black-eared Weavers (Malimbus melanotis) built several beautifu
hanging nests and laid, but no chicks came out. Rothschild's Starlings
White-winged Blue and Black-faced Scarlet Tanagers did not rear thei
young this year. Tacazze Sunbirds also failed and a female Violet-earec
Hummingbird built several nests without laying. A deplorable loss wa
that of a cock Scarlet-necked Tanager (Anisognathus igniventns), killei
by another bird (possibly a Pink-crested Touraco) when a brood of tw
had just hatched in a privet bush. The female failed to raise the chicks

By Dr. Peter R. Richards (Cookham Dean, Berkshire, England)
1 have been interested in the Rook for many years, and have been
eping them in captivity since 1951, when I had hand-reared my first
dgling. I qualified in Medicine in 1959, and as I had to take a resident
pointment in hospital, I reluctantly passed on my birds to Dr.
x&amp;gt;mbs, of Perren-ar-Worthal, in Cornwall; but from 1966 onwards I
is able to keep the Rooks again.
The birds live in an aviary, which is situated in my garden. It is
ft. wide, 24 ft. long and about 8 ft. high. It is irregular in shape, and
lilt between two large elm trees. The floor is earth, and turves of grass
2 laid every few months, but are rapidly destroyed by the birds.
There are no natural perches, but artificial perches are provided in
my parts of the aviary. As some of the birds are crippled with injured
ngs all the perches are near to the ground to enable the birds to climb
"if they cannot fly.
The aviary is surrounded with 1 in. mesh wire netting. Some protection
provided from the rain, by means of corrugated polythene sheeting, but
it is all.
Nest sites are provided, by selecting branches with natural forks and
tting them to suitable lengths. They are then placed in the aviary
out 6 ft. apart. Rooks show an interest in nesting material at all times
the year, except in mid-summer when they are going through the
st-nuptial moult. I find there is no difficulty in inducing them to use
ise nest sites, but, as it takes rather a long time for the birds to lodge
; first few sticks in the fork and form a foundation, I usually assist them
tying a few twigs into the site I have selected. I choose a site about
t. from the ground, and in a position where I can clearly observe the
sting behaviour.
There are no other species of birds in the aviary now, but at one time
:re were some jackdaws, Corvus monedula.
\ bath is provided in the form of an upturned dustbin lid, and the
ter is changed daily. All the birds take at least one daily bath.

I did not realize the female rook contributes practically nothing to th&amp;lt;
nourishment of her young until they are well feathered.
The following year in 1969, she laid again, in the meantime pairing witl
a crippled cock rook with an injured wing. Unfortunately, this wai
unsuccessful, as the cock ate every egg she laid, and has done so ever since
In 1970, this Pair A laid again, but her eggs were again eaten. B;
that time I had acquired several more rooks, so that in 1971, I had thre
adult pairs and some yearlings. A hen that had been brought to me ii
1969, aged two years, and another old cock rook with a broken wing, ha&amp;lt;
paired up (Pair B). They made a fine nest in early 1971, starting buildin
on 27th February and completing by 25th March. She laid four eggs
the first on 28th March, and the last on 4th April. They hatched afte
19 days incubation, the first on 15th April and the last on 19th1 Apn
I was not adequately prepared regarding the amount of food that th
young would require, and the young perished by the 25th April. Sh
laid a second clutch of eggs, between the 4th and 8th of May, but nor
hatched. , _ 1 j *
In 1972, I still had the original hen, but the cock I had given to
friend, and alas the hen has made no effort to pair with any other rool
and did not nest at all.
The second pair, Pair B, that bred in 1971, started nest building c
4th March. They chose a new site as a younger pair, Pair D, had usurpt
their original site, and had built a nest that contained eggs by the 8th
March. The nest of Pair B was completed by the 12th March, and si
had lined the cup of the nest by the 13th March, and was becomii
broody and begging constantly for food with a wing shaking, juveni
gesture, and the typical, high pitched caw that is so prevalent in rookeri,
at this time of the year.
Nest site selection seems to be made by the hen, but nest building -
conducted by both sexes. Much of the material is brought by the cot,
and the actual construction is largely conducted by the hen. The
contributes largely to the lining.
Perfectly adequate nests can be built by single birds of either sex, a.
have found that cocks who have lost their mates will continue to comph
a nest, and hens, for example A, can build and complete a nest in t.
absence of a suitable mate.
The first egg was laid on the 15th March, the second on the 16th, ui
the clutch was complete on the 22nd March, consisting of six eggs.
Incidently, Pair D suffered from the same fate as Pair A; the cock &amp;lt;
all the eggs. He was released, and can be seen strutting about Hy
Park and Kensington Gardens, one of the only two resident rooks 1
Central London. The hen accompanying him was also one of my bm

by the cock. The first two eggs hatched on the night of 2nd April
^19+18 days) and another egg hatched on the 3rd April (18 days). The
fourth egg hatched on the 4th April (18 days) and the fifth egg unfor-
iunately, cracked and the young died in the shell. The sixth egg hatched
jn 6th April (16 days).
The young were grey-skinned with orange gapes when hatched, but
pnckly grew until they had doubled their size by the fourth day, when
heir skin had become quite black, and their gapes changed to carmine
nnk. leather tracts were making their appearance by this time. The
nale rook was entirely responsible for feeding the young. The female
irooded all the time, only getting off the nest to stretch herself and uncover
he young when the male came to feed. Oddly enough, as has been noted
n the wild, when the cock arrived to feed the young the female begged
ntensely for food, and only passed food onto the chicks when her own
lunger was satisfied. It was difficult to supply enough maggots, for
eeding the chicks, as these were used to the exclusion of everything else
nd the other rooks in the aviary also would eat up any maggots I supplied
a preference to their usual diet.
By nth April--8 days, the first feathers on the back were through, but
nfortunately the food supply was not meeting their demands, and ok the
ith the youngest chick died of starvation, and on the 12th another died,
0 I decided to hand-rear the remaining three myself.
The chicks that survived were ringed on the 12th April, aged 10 8
and 6 days. On the 13th April the oldest chick's eye opened, aged
1 days, and the smallest chick remaining died, leaving me with only two.
By the 17th of April the two chicks were gaping at my finger, and their
ght was obviously quite good.
Fortunately, although I hand-reared the first two chicks successfully,
a the 19th April the hen bird started relining her nest again. I had
iduced the number of rooks I was keeping from ten to six, releasing
&amp;gt;me birds in Hyde Park. 6
The progress of the hand-reared rooklings was as follows:
By 14 days the feathers through on the back of the head, the back,
ie scapula region and the primary and secondary flight quills were growing
st. They grew very rapidly on a diet of chopped-up, day-old chicks
id a mixed mash of Lowes Meat Chips, layer pellets, bread soaked in
!g, corn, farlene, Sluis soft-bill, and groundnuts, on which the adult
&amp;gt;oks are basically fed.
By 21 days they were standing up and attempting to preen, their flight
athers were about 1 in. long, and their legs had reached adult size,
y&amp;apos; 25 days they were standing and flapping their wings and their head
id body growth was approximately completed. By the 27th day they
ere standing on the edge of the nest, and on the 28th day they could
and on one leg and scratch. By the 30th day they perched alongside

nest to the other. On the 35th day they could fly adequately. The
wines were able to support their weight, but their tails were still aboi
half grown. It was not, however, until the 44th day that their wings an
tails had become fully grown, and they were not feeding complete!
independently until August, although they could pick up food for then
selves by the nth June (69 days). One of the two hand-reared birc
escaped, a hen, but the other, a cock, is alive and has moulted well.
A second brood followed a similar pattern, but by supplementing the
food supply by hand, the young in the nest had adequate supplies of foo*
with the food brought to the young by the cock bird. I was able to re;
two chicks in the nest to maturity and to observe their parents reactic
The hen began to reline the nest on the 19th April, and the first ej
was laid on the 21st April. The clutch was completed by the 26th Apr
and consisted of five eggs. The first two hatched on the 9th May, ai
no others hatched, although one egg disappeared. The cock bird w
observed to remove the eggshell when the first egg hatched. The chics
grew and behaved very similarly to the first brood, but because the rooi
were better at nest hygiene than I could be, numerous observations wet
apparent that I missed in the hand-reared, first brood. The chicks we:

sternation and alarm calls, the harsh grating caws were uttered, upsetti;
all the other rooks, and the young rooks that I was feeding at about tci
hourly intervals ceased to beg for food, and cringed in the bottom
the nest. The hen bird ceased to brood the young continuously on H
29th May (21 days) and was seen to collect food and feed them hers,
for the first time. She did not brood again after 3rd June, by whi
time the young were 26 days old and were standing on the nest and flapp.j
their wings. J
On the 7th June (30 days), they perched on sticks near the nest, and
were flying by the 9 th June (32 days). They, however, still returned
the nest to roost until they were 34 days old.
The hen rook was responsible for most of their feeding, after leav

oung left the nest they seemed to be quite confident of themselves, and
lowed aggressive postures to strange birds that approached too close,
ad were respected by other birds in the aviary. In fact, the young birds
ave always been quite high in the heirarchy within the aviary. It is
aly in autumn when the adult birds have completed their moult, and are
exually highly active again, and the young birds are not showing any
vert sexual behaviour that they have slipped in the social hierarchy.
I think the successful breeding of these birds can be attributed to
lere being a stable colony in which the individuals interact and stimulate
ich other, and also to the large amount of live food in the form of
laggots and wax-moth larvae they receive.
I must say that since receiving the regular supplies of live food their
umage has improved, and even in the wettest days their feathers retain
Leir sheen and water-repellant qualities.
As described above, Dr. P. R. Richards has bred the Rook, Corvus
ugilegus. It is believed that this may be a first success.

BREEDING THE CASQUED HORNBILL
AT "BIRD WORLD"

<bodyText confidence="0.9985002" page_id="58078331"  page_num="23" year="" vol="">
By Mrs. P. M. Harvey (Holt Pound, Farnham, Surrey, England)
Early in April it was noticed that the pair of Casqued Hornbills,
\)canistes subcylindvicus , we had had for two years appeared to be coming
to breeding condition. They spent a lot of time preening and feeding
ch other, the cock bird feeding the hen with far more animal food than
ual, this consisting of mice, chicks, meat, etc.
We placed a barrel in the large flight on 29th April taking care to place
e entrance hole to face away from public eyes, and so give as much
ivacy to the pair as possible, should they make any attempt to nest.
On 5th May the birds started to mud up the hole in the barrel with some
iddy soil provided by the keepers. The cock bird did most of this
)rk, with a lot of interest and a little help from his mate. By 15th May
^ hole had become very small and excitement of all the staff mounted on
- 17th May, when the hen had become completely sealed in, leaving
ly a slit for feeding purposes. It was interesting to note that excrement
0 was carefully forced out through this same hole. The nest must
ve been spotlessly clean, while the area outside was getting progressively
ty, but we of course left well alone.
At the end of May and beginning of June we began to get rather worried,
eding habits fluctuated violently, in fact on some days little food at all

was taken. On 9th June we offered locusts which seemed to act as an
appetizer and to our relief other food increased, but strangely enough
mice and chicks, not so long ago a favourite food, were now refused
completely; locusts and mince with a little fruit now appeared to be the
order of the day.
On 28th June, 42 days after completion of mudding-up, a baby was
thought to be heard squeaking and on the 29th definitely one chick was
observed through the slit in the hole. Little fruit was now taken, but
locusts, mice, young rats, cut meat and day-old chicks were eaten profusely,
the food intake increasing steadily throughout August.
The cock bird was a very dutiful father. When given a fresh supply
of locusts, it was his habit to immediately take each one up to his mate,
seldom helping himself. In fact August proved a very busy month for
him, for more and more food was demanded by the hen bird, who was
constantly banging on the side of the barrel to attract attention.
On 8th September, to the surprise of us all, during the morning three
beaks were seen at the hole! Imagine the excitement of all at " Bird-
world ". Mum and two chicks were all demanding food from poor father.
The family had now been in the barrel home for four months. We
thought perhaps it was time they were venturing out into the world.]
Should we give them a little help by making the hole a little larger? Oi
let Nature take its course? My husband sat down one evening and reac
all the literature he could find on hornbills, one article read that it wa.
thought that some of the larger species did in fact stay in their nests as
long as 4 months and so, as the pair had done so well without inter-
ference from us, we decided to leave well alone; which proved a wisi
decision. 124 days after the hen was first mudded-in the barrel, 01
17th September at first light, two large knocks at the mud and out shi
stepped, quite calm and very clean in her new plumage, having gone througl
the moult while in the barrel.
The cock bird however was far from being calm, flying from one en(
of the flight to the other in great excitement, and to some extent, we felt
rather frightening the youngsters, who kept putting their heads out 0
the hole to see what all the fuss was about but not daring to join th
parents. The first ventured out at 9.32 a.m., the second two hours late
at 11.34 a.m., in rather an undignified manner, just missing the branch hi
mate had jumped to and falling like a stone to the ground. It did no
take him many minutes to find his wings and join the lest of the famil)
The young birds could fly very well as soon as they left the nest, perfec
miniatures of their parents, with a spotlessly clean black and white plumag
and about three-quarters grown. The nest that they had left was quil
unsoiled and the birds never returned to it.
For the following five to six weeks the parent birds both fed the fas
growing babies. Now, of course, at three months they are quite sel
supporting. The beaks are still much darker than the older birds an
give the impression that they are both hen birds.

BREEDING THE CRIMSON-RUMPED OR
SUNDEVALL'S WAXBILL AT CHESTER ZOO

(Estrilda rhodopyga)
By William H. Timmis, Curator of Birds and Mammals
The Crimson-rumped or Sundevall's Waxbill is found from the
,entral Sudan to Eritrea, Abyssinia and western Somaliland where it is
sported to be quite common locally in small parties, feeding on seeding
rasses and it is said to be extremely tame.
The adult bird is about 3} inches in length, mainly brown above, slight
reyish on the head and with crimson on the rump, edge of tail and along
entre of folded wings; a broad crimson stripe runs through the eye;
ill black; face, throat and foreneck white; breast and belly pale brownish-
uff. Finely barred above and below. Two races are recognsied:
-* r - rhodopyga , which is rather paler, and E. r. centralis , this being rather
arker below.
We have found it very difficult to distinguish the male from female,
ut it appears that the red through the eyes and on the rump is a much
eeper colour and that the white on the throat is brighter and slightly
ider in the adult male. Three adult Crimson-rumped Waxbills were
urchased from Lady O. C. Baillie on 21st July 1964 and released into
le Tropical House two weeks later. No breeding activity was observed
ntil the summer of 1968 when a nest was found under a very thick layer
f tropical creeper.
The nest was about two inches from the ground resting on a layer of
sad leaves and grasses which we assumed had been collected by the
reeding birds. The completed nest was quite large, I remember at the
me being astonished at the nest size in relation to the size of the birds,
he nest consisted of grass, feathers, thin shreds of banana leaves, which
feel must have been shredded by some of the larger birds in free flight
id once discarded this was then collected by the Crimson-rumped
&amp;apos; axbills. Other materials used included hair, and stems of grass and millet.

26 w. H. TIMMIS--BREEDING CRIMSON-RUMPED OR SUNDEVALL S WAXBILL
Eggs were not seen, due to the fact that when the nest was found one
of the birds was sitting and they continued todo so for io days, after which
both birds were seen carrying food into the nest. Food was placed quite
near to the nest area and consisted of soaked seeds, maggots dusted with
Vionate, chopped mealworms and ants-eggs plus seeding and flowering
grasses I found that they also enjoyed fresh turves each day, also sprouted
millet seed, barley, crushed hemp and dried flies. The crushed hemp
was readily eaten, and the insects also, but not so ravenously, and it die
not seem that insects were essential.
One young bird was seen being fed by one of the parents almost three
weeks after the nest had been found. The parent birds at this stage
were particularly timid and would not approach the nest while bemi
watched. They were also very excitable, fanning their tails out wide an(
switching them from side to side, which was very attractive to watch
The young bird resembled the adults except that it had no eye stripe ant
the bill appeared brownish instead of black and had coloured nodules
It also had two tufts of downy feathers sticking straight up above the eye
and no tail feather at all. The young bird was observed on numerou
occasions after leaving the nest and at about three months old it becam
very difficult to distinguish it from the adults at a distance.
The Crimson-rumped Waxbills bred again in 1971, this time rearm
two young ones. The nest was almost 10 ft. up on a wide wall overlookin
the Mountain Gorilla enclosure and was built among very thick vegetatioi
This year 1972 they again nested in the same area overlooking th
Gorillas and reared two young. I was able to watch this nest throug
binoculars and worked out the incubation period at around 12 to 14 day
the young leaving the nest at 25 days old and returning to the nest eac
night for almost a week. Both sexes helped with nest building and
appeared that the male did most of the construction in the earlier stage
almost all the larger pieces of nesting materials were found and earn*
to the nest site by the male. On three occasions I watched an adc
male Red-billed Weaver (Quelea quelea) chase the male Crimson-rump&amp;lt;
Waxbill while he was carrying nesting material, once actually taking a loi
stem of dried grass from his bill in flight and twice forcing him to land &amp;lt;j
the ground which resulted in the Waxbill dropping the grass; it w
immediately picked up by the Red-billed Weaver who then flew to b
small purse-shaped nest and started working on the large entrance at t:
side. . ,
We never saw the male Waxbill feeding the female during incubatn
but once the eggs had hatched both sexes brooded and fed the your.
Before feeding the young, the birds always settled on their custom^
perch and only after they had looked around and noticed nothing unusil
did they fly to the nest. Once again it appeared that the male did mo
feeding than the female at least in the early stages. This may be becaD
the female spent more time brooding and the male was responsible 1

ceding the newly hatched chicks. Later, when the chicks were larger
nd did not need as much warmth, she then seemed to share the feeding
lmost equally as much as the male. One interesting point about the
lird nesting was the considerable amount of crushed eggshell and
uttlefish eaten by the breeding pair both during incubation and in the
earing stages.
As described above, the Crimson-rumped or Sundevall's Waxbill

OBSERVATIONS ON HATCHING
NORTH AFRICAN GROUND HORNBILL
AT THE SAN DIEGO WILD ANIMAL PARK
By John R. Fairfield
(San Diego Wild Animal Park, California, U.S.A.)
Africa hosts two species of large terrestrial hornbills, the North African
r Abyssinian Ground Hornbill (Bucorvus abyssinicus), and the Southern

)ecies (Bucorvus cafer). Both species are black in colour with white
rimary feathers. The North African ground hornbill inhabits the
ivannah land south of the Sahara from Senegal and Sierra Leone in the
est, across Africa through Niger, Chad, Sudan; and Ethiopia, Somali
epublic, Uganda and central Kenya. The southern species is found
ring south of the Equator.
Both the northern and southern species have a huge black bill with
itches of red at the base. The area of skin surrounding the eye is bare,
ue in the northern species but red in the southern form. The wattle
1 the throat is inflatable, both red and blue in the male. The female
somewhat smaller in stature with the area around the eye and the
attle being completely blue. The casque on the head is most unusual
that it is open in front, and gives the appearance of being broken most
the time. The presence of the large casque is an excellent distinguishing
ature of the North African form while it is hardly noticeable in the
&amp;apos;Uthern species. The diet of both species is varied to include lizards,
takes, large insects, small birds and mammals. Much of their lives is

spent on the ground foraging the vegetation for food. They are capable
of flight and their roosting habits are in trees or low bushes in which the)
spend their nights. , ,
At the time of this writing the San Diego Wild Animal Park has one,
pair of North African ground hornbills in the 125-acre East African exhibit
The female &quot; Susie " was received at the San Diego Zoological Carder
on 20th September 1961 from Tilburg, and the male " Charlie " wai
received at the Zoo on 8th August 1951 from Rotterdam. Both birds wen
thought to be adults on arrival. The female was received at the bar
Diego Wild Animal Park on 14th September 1970 and the male wa:
received 24th February 1971. They were introduced to the same are
and were immediately compatible. The individual temperaments of th*
birds are almost exactly opposite, with Charlie being a friendly and almos
courageous bird while Susie is of a timid, shy and much reserved nature
On 20th May 1972 Charlie was observed attempting to feed Susie
rodent. She accepted the mouse and consumed it after a brief period c
carrying it around in her bill. At every observation for the next fe\
days both Charlie and Susie were carrying leaves and twigs to a
18-inch diameter drainage pipe situated on the extreme eastern edge c
the exhibit. The female Susie would place the material in the drainag
pipe and appear to stand guard at the entrance. The week of 7th Juri
1972 was one of inclement weather at the Wild Animal Park. Th
drainage pipe which the hornbills had taken over was once again bem
used and Charlie and Susie left the area. The next day they wei
observed on the opposite side of the exhibit and on the moat line which
made of earth. They remained in this area almost constantly with t
exception of Charlie who would migrate to the original food station aero:
the exhibit and return to Susie with food.
On 12th June 1972 Charlie did not come for food. A visual examinatiq
of the moat line showed why. Both he and Susie were laboriously diggn
with their bills a cave in the earthen moat wall and a hole was start!
about 24 inches above ground level. Once the cave was large enough f
them to enter they incorporated the use of their feet as well. Since
was obvious that neither he nor Susie were going to leave their labour f
food a new feeding station and a new method of feeding was establish^
Their diet which consists of day-old chicks, rodents and small amount
raw meat chunks was simply placed from afar near the nesting are
The construction of the cave went on daily until the morning of 23rd Ju:
1972. Charlie was seen carrying leaves and twigs, and Susie was sei
placing the material in the nest.
On 26th June 1972 mating was observed. It was witnessed only a
time and took place about 200 ft. below the nest area. It was in typi
avian fashion with very little vocalization. Charlie would emit h
booming calls and walk around Susie with his wings partially extend
and his feathers ruffled. He would thump his bill on the ground wH

ooming. The complete act took about 30 minutes with the actual
lounting being the terminating point.
On 29th June 1972 both birds were observed carrying nesting material
ito their cave, with Charlie spending more time inside than out. This
ehaviour continued until 12th July 1972 when Susie went inside the
est and remained. Charlie became more aggressive and protective of
le entire area surrounding the cave.
t The cave is about 4 to \\ ft. in depth with a slight curvature to the left,
he entrance hole is much smaller being about 18 in. in diameter. The
ive opens east and is constructed so that no direct sunlight ever really
iters more than a few inches into the entrance of the nest itself. The
lajor area of the floor of the cave has been covered with leaves and twigs
1 which Susie sits facing the entrance. The earth that was removed
aring the actual cave construction has intermingled with rhino dung so
tat a ramp has been created from the ground level to the cave entrance.
On 16th July 1972 one off-white egg was observed partially exposed
om under the feathers of Susie's breast. Since she sits facing the
)ening, the egg was rather easily seen. On 17th July 1972, a second egg
as observed under Susie. The opening to the nest remained open and
e male continued to feed the female. She did not leave the nest for
od or water.
On 22nd August 1972 movement was observed in the nest and instead
the two eggs, we observed one chick and one off-white egg. The chick
is hatched naked with eyes closed. The chick's bill is rather enormous
r the body size, being very dark grey (almost black in colour) with a
&amp;apos;ge egg-tooth in place on the tip. The dark pink skin (almost purple)
vering the body of the chick was textured and closely resembled a
/er of fine grey-white down when first observed. The size of the egg
d the chick was close to that of the domestic turkey (Meleagris gallapavo ).
The second egg was fertile but was broken open by the female. On
th August 1972 the second chick, almost full-term, was observed dead
&amp;gt;t inside the nest.
The hatching of the North African Ground Hornbill at the San Diego
ild Animal Park is the second hatching of this rare species ever recorded
captivity, the first being in Bristol in 1971. This is the first hatching
&amp;apos;orded in the Western Hemisphere.

(Musophaga rossae)
By Newton R. Steel (Stoke Fleming, S. Devon, England)
In October 1968 I was privileged to be the guest of the East Africa!
Guernsey Breeders' Association, during which time I not only judge&amp;apos;
cattle at the Nairobi Show, but word had got round that I was exceptional!
interested in birds. Through this, all my hosts and hostesses on the te
different farms at which I stayed during this time, went out of their wa
to show me as much as possible of the bird and wild life of Kenya. It wa
whilst staying on a farm at Kitale that I visited a lady who had two pair
of Ross's Touraco--one of which that year had produced a youngste
which died at some ten days old. I was so attracted by these birds the
I tried hard to buy a pair from her, without success. However I ws
going to visit Mr. David Roberts at Lake Baringo so thought I might b
able to obtain them there. There were in fact none available at the tim
but he agreed the price and promised to send me a young pair as soon 2
they had been hand-reared.
This was subsequently done and one day whilst engaged judging
Dairy Herds competition in the Surrey area, I received a telegram to s;
that some birds were awaiting me at London Airport. The kind lac'
who was acting as my chauffeur for this judging engagement, offered &amp;apos;
take me to London Airport to collect them, which we did on this Jur
afternoon. They arrived each in its own separate compartment wr
feeding instructions pasted to the lid and when I got home and unpack!

excellent condition, the other looked somewhat dirty and tatty and gv
me some concern for a week or two.
Mealworms were an irresistible temptation and with these in limit&amp;apos;
numbers, together with their softbill mixture and soft fruit and ad 1
bathing facilities, they did extremely well in one of my calving boxes |
the farm under infra-red lamps which were thermostatically controll
to maintain 65*F, then as the summer warmed up and they becai
better feathered, this was gradually reduced. They were given an outsi
flight which they could use in the daytime only, and here they remain
until I moved to Devonshire in November 1967* where they were hous
for their inside quarters in the cool end of a heated greenhouse, with 1
exit to a long 10 ft. flight raised 2 ft. off the ground on wire netting.
They seemed very contented and pleased with their new home^whi
during the winter was thermostatically controlled to between 45 F a
5o*F. They go into a moult in the early part of the spring each year a:
at the end of one of these moults, one June day in 1968, I returned fr
the garden to find the hen very severely beaten up about the head, 2

own m a corner. So severely was she damaged that a scab grew right
/er her head and eyes, thus preventing her from seeing to feed and even
&amp;apos;day she still has a naked patch at the back of her neck and one blind
/e, which she unfortunately did herself with one of her long claws when
matching the irritating scab. I had to force feed her for some ten days
&amp;apos; a fortm ght and of course during this time she became very tame,
er head and eyes were dressed with ointment twice a day and in due
mrse the scab came off and she re-grew her carmine crest. It was only
,en that I realised she was blind in one eye. During this period she
as confined to a segregated section of the indoor aviary so that she should
)t fret and here she lived until the moult of i 97l when I thought it was
ally time that I tried to get them together again.
This I did in short periods of re-introduction when I was close by for
1 hour or two. One day to my delight I saw them feeding one another,
hurriedly spent a whole afternoon erecting a large tree log in the far
id of the flight, up against a south facing wall, hoping that this might
; a Sllltable home for them but no, they took no notice of it whatsoever
it preferred to carry very stupid pieces of stick on to some dangerously
secure branches in the greenhouse. I endeavoured to help them by
itting some flat, dry laurel branches and leaves horizontally, but for all
eir industrious stick carrying, everything fell down to the ground again,
then wove in a piece of wire netting upon which I thought they could
/ their sticks more securely, when one day to my horror I found a
oken egg on the floor. It had rolled off this very insecure platform,
tus was 16 th June 1971.
My next attempt was to commandeer the only suitable shopping basket
d promptly remove the bottom of it. leaving a rim of about an inch all
und. The bottoms of shopping baskets, as you may know, are more
ten convex than concave, so I had to make my nest-basket concave and
ts was done by pressing it into an earthenware pigeon nest pan, putting
the middle of it some extremely heavy bricks and filling the pan with
ihng water. When it had cooled off I found the canes had set in a
ncave fashion and I then wired this on to the top of the wire-netting

sign of it anywhere. I felt sure it had been eaten. After this they wen
less and less concerned, although they continued to sit for a day or twc
I subsequently examined the second egg only to find it infertile so remove
it.
25th July !
Another egg appeared and a second one on the 27th.
27 th July
These were again religiously incubated by the cock bird sitting froi
about 10 o'clock during the day and the hen bird from tea-time until tl
middle of the following morning. The eggs are almost completely rount
rather like those of an owl and 43 mm. x 36 mm. with no small end.
They sat continuously for four weeks. When I removed the two eg;
I found that one had a well-formed but decomposing chick in it. \
head was well-formed and eyes visible, and there were black feathers dov
the neck and on the shoulders so it had obviously died just prior to hatchin
With this I decided it was quite late enough, so removed the nest for tl
rest of the year. They went into their usual moult at the end of Februar
March 1972 and at the end of March I replaced the basket nest.
9 th and 11 th April 1972
This they were delighted to see and on the 9th April the first egg w
laid, the second on the nth April. They shared the incubation peril
again for nearly four weeks but again both eggs proved infertile.
19 th May
Again they went to nest on the 19th May, this time not sitting quite:
well as in the past, and after three weeks I tested the eggs and found thj
both infertile so I removed them.
28 th and 30 th June
Once again on the 28th June another egg appeared and a second
the 30th June. This time they sat well and on the 23rd July, just 24 dj
after, the second egg hatched and the little black chick, looking aim-
exactly like a young Moorhen, was sitting with its head up in the nt:
But this was found dead on the floor at four days old. I removed
other egg which was infertile. This was a great disappointment. Durj
this time I had been feeding them all their usual cut-up mixed frl
together with an insectivorous mixture and mealworms, but obviousb
was not sufficient.

as hatched on the 8th September. I left the second egg in the nest
&amp;gt;r support.
During the incubation period I had started to feed the parents with an
ccasional sop of bread and milk. This they became very fond of and
hen the chick hatched, they had a regular feed out of my hand of bread
id milk twice a day, ten or a dozen mealworms three times a day, and
hat I believe has been the main reason for success in rearing this chick,
1 P lace of water 1 substituted nectar feed. Other than their bath out
the flight, they have never been offered water up to the present time
hey consume a cupfull of nectar a day, and the chick, now six weeks old,
is been seen down at it. Mealworms were increased from 12-15 to
&amp;gt;-25 and they are now taking 100 a day. I have no doubt they would
ke more but I feel that these, with the bread and milk and nectar
lould be adequate.
They have been consuming in the last two or three weeks the equivalent
half a slice ofbread cut at an inch thick, soaked with milk overnight and
!gar sprinkled on the top and, in addition to this, a very concentrated
iwder with a very high protein content. Half a teaspoonful of this has
;en sprinkled on both feeds of bread and milk, as well as on the meal-
jrms. Gentles have been offered, but are not readily taken, except
ten fed before mealworms and if they are very clean and lively, then the
Id one seems to be eaten. Feeding is by regurgitation. Not as with
geons where the young put their beaks into the parents, but by the young
\0x25A0ening a large gape and its parent dribbling food into the open mouth,
ir less of the fruit and insectivorous mixture is taken. In fact for the
st week or two hardly any, other than orange and grapes. Even pear
d not seem to be appreciated.
At the time of writing on the 26th October, the chick has been out
d about for nearly a fortnight. It was interesting to note that at first
s chick was found down on the floor, where it remained for four
ys despite my thinking it was kind to return it to the nest, but after
ir days it returned to the nest of its own accord and continued to be
ooded there at night.
Since it came out of the nest, I have endeavoured to maintain a tempera-
re of 6o * F b y means of an electric radiator. The chick is now well
ithered and the blue sheen shows on the wings and tail, but as yet the
^ely carmine of the secondaries is not visible. The bill and wattle and
es are still quite black. It will be interesting to see how long before
change colour. It is now about the size of a pigeon.
For those who have not been so fortunate as to know that they have a
ir, the difference between the male and female is that in the male, the
jue, or wattle, is very slightly concave and when really fit has a little
1 mark in the centre, whilst that of the female is convex (i.e. Roman-
sed) and has no red marking. One of the interesting features of the
ds is that they very much resent any change in one's appearance.

Normally I never wear a hat or glasses when I am feeding them but should
I inadvertently do so, I am attacked viciously. Apart from this they are
most friendiv will take mealworms or bread and milk out of my hand and
always seem 'pleased to see me. I believe it is advisable, particu arly
during the hot summer, to let them have a bath available during incubation
and should this be done, I think it is essential that it is there all the time
so that each parent may bathe when it pleases, because on one occasion
when I had withheld the bath for a period, both parents came off the
nest and got thoroughly soaked and then sat in the sun drying themselves
As with so many birds, I find that they only bathe in fresh, clean water-
in other words they will not go into a dirty bath.
The floor covering of the inside aviary is coarse sand, which 1 tee
advisable as it is easily cleaned out, they being rather messy birds under
neath their perch. For safety's sake I keep them off the earth. Visitor
are something which I never let them have during the incubation penoi
because they are much too agitated and omit their delightful liquu
warbling cry. I do feel that it is inadvisable to encourage their nestin
outside, especially in view of the length of time they sit and the latenes
in the year for a chick to be out.

NEW WALKTHROUGH RAINFOREST AVIARY
AT THE TARONGA ZOOLOGICAL PARK
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.985429882352941" page_id="58078351"  page_num="41" year="" vol="">
By Kerry A. Muller (Curator of Birds, Taronga Zoological Park,
Sydney, N.S.W., Australia)
The concept of large walkthrough aviaries is certainly not new in zoos,
id the majority of first-class zoos in Europe and America have exhibited
ich aviaries for at least the last decade, some being constructed at the
irn of the century.
The Colin Mackenzie Sanctuary in Healsville, Victoria, was the first
ustrahan Zoo to build a large walkthrough aviary. This houses a
eeding pair of Superb Lyrebirds. They have recently completed a
cond similar aviary and a large bird-of-prey aviary.
On 3rd February 1972 the New Walkthrough Rainforest Aviary was
&amp;gt;ened at the Taronga Zoo. In dimensions it stands 122 ft. long, 70 ft.
ide and 60 ft. high, being oval in design.
Architecturally it is unique, the entire aviary being supported by two
dined steel parabolic arches. These arches are further supported by
terlacing cables of 8 mm. diameter, stainless steel wire ropes and
mm. diameter high tensile stainless steel rods, strung to form a grid.
)th the arches and cables are bolted into a concrete perimeter foundation,
le aviary cover is of 25 mm. (1 in.) by 12 mm. (J in.) galvanized weld-
2sh, tightly secured to the cables and the cement foundation. This size
fish contains all bird species, including Malurus wrens, and prohibits
Ip entry of pests such as sparrows, starlings and rats. A guiding
mciple in the design of the aviary was to create an enclosed space with
acute angles, no crossbeams or upright supports, either inside or out.
ie entire space is available for unobstructed flight (in this we are
tunate in not having to consider problems of snow or ice loads.)
try and exit for the public is permitted at either end by a revolving
3r, consisting of three panels set at 120* and permitting the access of
0 lers (or perambulators) into the aviary. The vertical edges of these
iels are lined with heavy rubber strips to prevent escape of birds and
uries to the visitors.
vVithin the aviary visitors are confined to a wide natural wood walkway,
terever possible this is raised above the ground, thus preventing
&amp;apos;tors from leaving the walkway and allowing birds access under

the walkway from one area to another. The area under the walkwa
is heavily planted, and provides additional security and nesting areas fo
the birds. In areas where the walkway approaches ground an mcon
spicuous barrier of sharp upturned tree-roots has been provided upo
which vines and epiphytes are growing. This device has proved ver
satisfactory in confining visitors to the walkway and it has not bee
necessary, as in many zoos, to employ a keeper or guard on patrol dunn
visiting hours. No visitors have yet been observed off the walkway.
Landscaping the aviary in a simulated rainforest was a major undei
taking. The site has an undulating slope, in some areas exceeding 45
with a substrate of sandstone, in some areas forming attractive outcroppin
shelves. Initially all old soil, rubble and vegetation were removed froi
the site, retaining only an Umbrella Tree ( Brassaia ) and a badly croppe
Paperbark {Melaleuca). New soil rich in leaf mould was added, in son
areas contained by low stone retaining walls. Trees for perching we:
cut and set in concrete filled holes. To provide a composit ramfore
effect similar to those found in eastern Australia, the following mdigenoi
species were used in landscaping:--
For canopy and secondary cover: Tree Ferns ( Cyathea australis ai

Frangipanni (Hymenosporumflavum), Wattle ( Acacia longifolia ), Brush-b :
(Tristania confer ta ), Christmas Bush (Ceratopetalum gummiferuv,
Lillypilly (Acmena smithii ), Umbrella Tree (Brassaia actinophylla).
For ground cover: Harsh Ground Fern (Hypolepis muelleri), Rock F"t
Fern (Pyrrosia rupestris ), Fishbone Fern (Nephrolepis cor difolia), Comma
Maidenhair Fern (Adiantum aethiopicum ), Austral Bracken Fei
(Pteridium esculentum), Coral Fern (Gleichenia rupestris ), Hares Foot Pei
(Devallia sp.), Rock Orchid (Dendrobium speciosum and Liparis reflex.,
Creeping Fig (Ficus pumila), Native Grasses.
Several trips were made to rainforests to collect epiphytes and han.
Epiphytes exhibited are -Staghorn Fern ( Platycerium grande), Elkhd
Fern (Platycerium bifurcaturn alcicome), Birds-nest-fern (Asplentumntdi,
Climbing Fern (Dictyrnia brownii ), And some native orchids.

The majority of native trees were available from nurseries only in sis

nd Bromeliads.
A series of small pools and connected streams were established in the
viary, often adjacent to the walkway. Contours were shaped in the soil
nd lined with butyl rubber. Sand and river gravel were added to cover
he rubber and give a natural appearance, and the pools planted with
ative lillies and rushes. Small fish, amphibians and tortoises were then
dded to complete the illusion of naturalness (much to the delight of our
kingfishers).
Water is a major necessity of any rainforest, and this is provided by
)ur oscillating sprinklers located inconspicuously on the steel arches above
le vegetation. On the ground a series of mist-producing heads are
snnected to a copper water line buried in the soil. To water the exhibit
keeper need only turn on a series of valves and return to other duties.
&amp;gt;n hot days the overhead sprinklers are often turned on, to the mutual
ijoyment of birds and visitors.
To prevent erosion and to provide a natural substrate, leafmould and
ry leaves were used to cover the forest floor. These rapidly decomposed
id provide food for insects and earthworms, which are in turn consumed
Y the birds, especially the Lyrebirds.
Food for the wide variety of birds is provided in several feeding stations,
id changed once or twice daily. Stainless steel pans are placed in move-
)le holders, both at ground level and above ground dependent on the
rds feeding habits. These holders are fitted with circular transparent
irspex plastic domes, placed 12 ins. above the pan. These keep all rain
id water out of the feed but are unobtrusive in appearance. For nectar
eders several bottles are provided on holders in trees throughout the
ge. For fruit-eater birds several dead perches have a series of stainless
&amp;apos; el headless nails imbedded in them, and pieces of apple, orange, banana
d papaya are impaled on them daily and old fruit removed.
In stocking the new aviary, emphasis was placed on Australasian species
habiting rainforest habitats. One reason for this is that the area of
e zoo in which the aviary is built is dedicated to native fauna and flora,
lother reason is that importation of any birds into Australia has been
&amp;apos;bidden by law since 1948, and exotic bird species are difficult (or
possible) to obtain.
Labels were made identifying the birds presented, and defining the
ationship and adaptations of different families of birds to particular
logical niches in a rainforest. It is our eventual aim to represent as
iny families as possible in the aviary.
te following species are presently exhibited in the rainforest aviary:

later plant growth to provide additional cover. Within the next fe
months pittas, treecreepers, sunbirds, log-runners, cuckoos, parrot-finch.
and small lorikeets will be added to the aviary.
One of the greatest of all aviculturists and ornithologists, Jean Delacoi,
once wrote " The principle of a walk-in cage is excellent, and I can clan
to be the sponsor of such aviaries in America, where they have provl
highly satisfactory. But its very principle is that the cage itself is m
obvious, so that the visitor who is inside has as much as possible t:
illusion of walking among free birds. The frame of the aviary must rt
only be simple and inconspicuous, but also made invisible by trees a:i
creepers. Even its approach should be so planted on the outside that o-
is not aware that there is a cage at all."
We feel that in design and landscaping our new rainforest aviary me"s
these criteria admirably.

On two recent visits to the London Zoo on mild, dull December days
was surprised at the activity of some of the fruit pigeons. This included
display apparently not described previously, and I have therefore
ublished these notes. The accompanying sketches are reconstructions
t a later date based on hasty scrawls on the backs of envelopes or any
aper that came to hand in my pockets. They are not accurate as regards
etail but may help to give a general impression of the postures.
The display was that of the Grey-necked Fruit Pigeon, Ducula caroli.
here were two birds, which Derek Goodwin tells me are two males,
bout the size of domestic pigeons but more stoutly built in typical fruit
igeon fashion. They are mainly grey with dark spots on the wings and
greenish tail. The upper breast is pale silvery-grey and the lower breast
darker shade of grey, the two separated by a transverse line and giving
ti illusion of shadow on a sunlit bird. Towards the sides of the breast a
Lite line separating the two areas is visible. The belly and under tail
Dnverts are a dark purplish-brown.
The displaying bird drew itself upright on the perch, very tall and thin,
id blew out its chest as a two-tone grey balloon, rather in the fashion of
pouter pigeon. At the same time it extended its neck forward and bowed
le head until the neck rested on top of the inflated breast with the head
ressed down against the upper breast and the bill pressed into the
athers (fig. i). The legs were stretched and the tail pointed downwards.
In this posture it uttered a series of low-pitched " oomp " notes, about
even notes in rapid succession, beginning emphatically and becoming
tore rapid and lower in pitch, and dying away. I can only describe the
meral tone as similar to that heard when air rapidly bubbles out of a
lbmerged pint milk-bottle--a sound most washers-up may recall,
he bird repeated the performance twice.
It then turned slightly towards its companion who stood in an upright,
ert posture nearly. The displaying bird retained its very rigid upright
ance with lowered head, but by flexing its legs slightly performed a
Ties of vigorous upward jerks, very like those occurring in the display
some estrildines. Having done six or seven of these it relaxed a little,
ising its head and uttering a small harsh note; after which it returned to
more normal posture. The very upright posture was of interest because
ds species is one with a conspicuously patterned underside.

40 C. J. O. HARRISON-- DISPLAY AND POSTURES OF FRUIT PIGEONS
On the same visits I watched a Mountain Imperial Pigeon, Ducula badii
perform calling and nest-calling in a nearby aviary. The commencemer
of this was indicated by the bird extending head and neck forwards an
upwards with the feathers of the head slightly fluffed and the throat parti
inflated (fig. 2). This was followed by an arching forwards and downward
of head and neck accompanied by a puffing-out of the breast, resulting i
a hunched posture with the head pressed against the front of a swolle
breast and the bill almost buried in the feathers fig. 3). In this postui

he bird uttered four well-spaced, deep notes, the first two rather short
md more rapid, the second pair longer and almost disyllabic " wook-wook,
irwook, urwook This was immediately followed by an abrupt upward
wing of the head back to a more normal position above the back
erminating in a slight backward pressing of the head and outward thrust
&amp;gt;f the breast. The same pattern was witnessed several times.
This individual was also seen nest-calling on two different occasions,
t squatted on top of a closely-clipped privet hedge. Its tail was not
loticeably raised and there was no marked wing-twitching, only an
&amp;gt;ccasionally slight tremor of the wings. Small twigs were picked up and
)laced to either side by the bird. Periodically it would call. There was
he same arching of the neck and pressing of the deeply-lowered head
igainst the inflated breast. The call was only two monosyllabic notes
'wook, wook " and then the head was abruptly raised again in typical
ashion.
I had also seen this type of call with deeply-lowered head from an
Australian Pied Imperial Pigeon, Ducula spilorrhoa , at Amsterdam Zoo
n 197*- this case the posture of the calling bird was almost horizontal.
The bird squatted on a perch, lowered its head to the front of the breast
vith bill pressed against the feathers. It uttered what I noted at the time
5 a deep, hollow " crool, coo-rool ". It also gave a briefer " kut-crool "
lote.
In this last species I noted one individual standing on a possible nest-
ite, tilted forwards with tail straight up and breast and bill almost touching
he site. Its wings were rhythmically quivering but I could not hear a
all at the time. I also noted one bird threatening another by moving in
hort hops towards it with head low and neck extended forwards, and
ittering an abrupt " check " or " chuck " note, loud and nasal, and more
ike that of a rail than a pigeon. This last note appears similar to that
ecorded by Derek Goodwin {Pigeons and Doves of the world, 1967; p. 420)
or the Indonesian Pied Imperial Pigeon, D. hicolor.

On January 3 1973, I observed copulation in a pair of Mountair
Imperial Pigeons, Ducula badia, at the London Zoo. Although this was
seen only once it seems worth publishing here, partly so that it can forir
an appendage to Dr. Harrison's observations on Ducula species, anc
partly because I know of no other observation on any species of th&amp;lt;
Ducula IPtilinopus group. The copulation ceremonials of pigeon species
although sometimes variable in minor details, are usually species-specifk
(Goodwin 1956, 1970) so that even if only one such has been seen it i:
highly likely to fall within the species' normal repertoire and quite likeb
to be entirely typical.
Shortly after cooing (see Harrison preceding article pp. 39--41) the mal
flew down, slighted on a low perch and at once displacement-preened at th
side of his breast. The female, on seeing this, immediately flew down als
and alighted about two feet from him. As she did so he displacement
preened once behing his wing. She sidled a little towards him, the
adopted a soliciting posture which differed from that of other pigeon
known to me in that her neck was elongated and curved slightly downwards
For some moments the male stood beside her in an indecisive mannei
Then he raised his head, slightly swelled out his neck (inflation or plumag
erection?), then mounted the female. He remained for some time, perhap
only half a minute but it seemed longer, quiescent on her back. One
during this period he head flicked, usually a gesture of irritation c
repulsion (Goodwin 1956 b). Then he began simultaneously to coo an

0 manoeuvre backwards to copulate. I had the impression that the
ctual cloacal contact coincided with the end of the cooing phrase, and the
iackward movement of the head as described by Harrison.
The male dismounted onto the perch at the same side of the female from
/hich he had previously mounted. He lifted his head high, the female
arned eagerly towards him and reached up with her bill. The male
ffered his bill, opening his gape widely. The female inserted her bill
nd with it inside the male's rapidly opened and shut her bill with a
ibrating movement of the head. The male did the same (except that
is bill was, perforce, widely open at the time) with his bill. There was
0 passage of food or other matter between them. They separated then
nmediately repeated this billing, after which the mating ceremony
ppeared to be at an end.
Mountain Imperial Pigeon. Post-copulatory billing.
If this instance was typical its most noticeable difference from that of
-h other pigeons whose mating ceremonies have been described was the
:urrence of billing after instead of before copulation. The rapid
ening and shutting of the mandibles is similar to what I have seen from
&amp;apos; African Green Pigeon, Treron calva , and the Green Imperial Pigeon,
&amp;apos;cula aenea, on the nest site and which is possibly their equivalent of the
ing of Columba species. Cooing while on the female's back occurs in
copulation ceremonial of the Diamond Dove and some of the
stralasian bronzewings (Goodwin i960).

By Professor Carl Naether (Encino, California, U.S.A.)
What has interested, indeed fascinated, me more than any other fact*
in enjoying foreign doves and pigeons in captivity is their individual habi
as manifested in their day-to-day behavoir, particularly in relation to tl
habits of domestic doves and pigeons. In this essay I plan to emphasi:
distinctive behavior traits of species of foreign doves and pigeons whic
it has been my good fortune to maintain over extended periods of tin
in my aviary.
In appraising the value of my observations, the reader should rememb
that no two doves or pigeons, even those belonging to the same specif
behave necessarily in the same manner. This behavior may be condition*
by many factors, over most of which their keeper has little or no contn
They may include the following: whether or not the doves were raised
their native haunts or in captivity; how long they have been in captivi
and how well they have adjusted to its limitations; whether they are ke
under highly artificial or more or less natural conditions, and, of cours
how carefully and humanely they are treated by their keeper. All the*
considerations, and many others, affect their behavior in captivity ve&amp;apos;
much.
One of the most typical doves for study, not only from the standpoit
of behavior but also from that of appearance is the Galapagos Do 1 *
It made its first appearance in captivity in 1893 when four specimen
arrived at the London, England, Zoo, and in 1923 New York Z(*
This small, short, plump bird looks neither like a dove nor pigeon, and*
in this respect unique among foreign doves. I well remember the fit-
pair I acquired quite some years ago. Almost the very moment I ideas

iale and female into a planted aviary, containing a mixed lot of doves
nd softbills, they made themselves completely at home. At once they
egan to investigate the aviary from corner to corner, the feed dishes and
le nestboxes, without in any way disturbing the other inmates of the
riary. Best of all, they were wholly unafraid of me, acting as if simply
belonged with them in the aviary. Their curiosity next centered on the
riary soil, which soon they punctured vigorously with their fairly long,
irved beaks, apparently searching for beetles and grubs in the numerous
oles they dug all over the aviary floor. This habit of probing the soil
&amp;gt;r nourishment is a distinct behavior trait of the Galapagos Dove, one I
ave not observed in any of the other species of foreign doves I have kept.
Moreover, my pair lost no time in locating an open-front nestbox, soon
lereafter building a flimsy nest with sticks and straws, and in due course
.ising young successfully. During their sojourn in my aviary, these
lusual " undovelike " doves proved tame and trusting, wholly unafraid
me, and attending to their affairs without in any way bothering their
iighbors.
The most notable behavior trait of the Snow Pigeons I once kept was
eir delightful liveliness: their flying and chasing about in the aviary,
Tie and time again jumping in and out of the large, open-top nesting box,
e while voicing their " clucks and croaks " in a very determined effort
coax a suitable mate to join them. Filled with overflowing energy,
ese handsome pigeons were " on the go and fly " seemingly the whole
iy long, and in this behavior strongly suggested that of certain varieties
domestic pigeons. So deeply absorbed were they in their goings and
mings as to pay virtually no attention to me when I entered their
ivate abode to feed and water them. That they were closely related to
mestic columbae was shown by their eagerness to mate with blue
rasser Pigeons, there being no female Snow Pigeons available.
Among the gentlest " wild " pigeons I have ever had in my aviary was
trio of freshly imported Splendid Pigeons--two hens and one cock,
ns quite handsome threesome lived peacefully together during all the
ars they were in my possession. Even after mating and producing some
spring, old and young flourished without showing the slightest tendency
vard disagreement. On the basis of this rather unpigeonlike behavior
freshly imported birds, I assumed that this species lived and nested in
cks in its native habitat, as is the custom of certain wild species of
&amp;apos;eons.
4 lovely pair of Bartailed Cuckoo Doves deserve mention also owing to
iir almost astounding prolificness during the four years they have been
Always using the same nesting site in the half-dark of their
vate aviary, they have invariably brooded the single white egg faithfully,
ched it in 13 days, and nursed the squab to vigorous maturity. Their
rtness when brooding amuses me, since it manifests itself only in the

closer, just leave me to my private business! " These beautiful long
tailed'birds' behavior is characterized by seemingly day-long masterl
inactivity, spent on the same high perch or else on the nest. Perhaps th
is the main reason why in antique records they were considered bein
so-called " tree pigeons Even though for the last two seasons their egg
have lacked fertility, the pair continues to lay them month in and mont
out, even during the winter months truly an interesting couple!
And now a few words concerning a pair of Key West Quail Doves, whic
have graced a part of my aviary for the last seven years, raising many
youngster, but currently laying only infertile eggs. Their characterist
behavior trait lies in their sitting on the nest close together side by sic
not only at the time of " changing the guards, " but literally for hours o
end as if both male and female were determined to see the eggs hatcl
Since they do not, or cannot, " sense " the infertility of their eggs, the
usually continue to brood for 12-13 days. And though I have followe
the well-meant advice of a friendly, concerned veterinary, giving thei
epsom salts, special vitamins, and what not, I an unable to effect a cure,
probably because the doves are too old to reproduce, so I just have to 1
them sit side by side and " enjoy" themselves! They are among n
pensioners that have served me well in bygone years, therefore deservir
of rest and quiet.
In conclusion, a brief mention of a pair of Bartlett Bleeding Heart dov
which have been my possession for well over a year. Their behavi
during all these months is marked by almost constant restlessness ar
shyness, which no doubt is responsible for their reluctance to nes
They live in a private compartment, wholly undisturbed by other dov
and thoroughly well protected against outside enemies. Though I ke&amp;lt;
my distance when feeding them, they at once begin to run about wildl
certainly sore afraid of me. Such reactions are new to me, especial
when they signify no change for the better in more than twelve montb
My explanation of this undesirable behavior is that somehow or other th
were not accorded the proper treatment by their former owner. Howev(j
they are a beautiful pair, not at all common in this country; so I sh&amp;lt;
continue to care for them hoping against hope that they will in due tir
change their behavior and " reform. "

A pair of Ostriches at Longleat Safari Park laid a number of eggs
nd Mr. Roger Cawley, the Manager, kindly asked us if we would like
3 try our hand at hatching them, so they were placed in an incubator,
^together six eggs were sent to us over a period of several weeks,
&quot;hree proved to be infertile two developed chicks which failed to hatch*
le remaining one did hatch and the chick survived for three weeks
ventually dying of Aspergillosis.
)etails are as follows:
The temperature of the incubator was kept at 98 0 F for five weeks and
do*F for the last week. The eggs themselves were laid on moist sand
id turned every morning and evening. Examination over a strong light
lowed that at 41 days the chick had penetrated the air sac within the egg;
: 42 days it was tapping the shell; on the 43rd day the chick hatched
ith some assistance from our keeper, Martin Greene, who made a small
lie in the shell at the end containing the air sac to enable the chick
&amp;apos; breathe. This it could be heard doing quite clearly.
Hatching occured on the 8th July 1972. For the first three days the
uck did little. It neither ate nor drank and was very weak on it's legs,
t the end of this time it began to walk properly and was transferred to a
;n indoors over which was suspended an infra red lamp. It then began
peck at clover and chopped grass. On the 1 ith July it took half grown
custs and was seen to drink for the first time. On the 14th July it was
en to take grit in the form of a mixture of flint, oyster shell and limestone.
ii the 15th July it was put out on short grass during sunny periods and
began to eat turkey pellets. On the 16th July it was grazing and eating
llets well. 8 s
From this time onwards it began to grow and seemed to be doing well,
t on the 29th July it died. It was of course shut in at night and at all
aes had access to the infra red lamp during dull sunless periods in the
ytime.
It should also be recorded that Woburn and Windsor Safari Parks
idly sent us eggs laid by their Ostriches, but unfortunately all were
fertile.

Michael Sherborne (Overseer of Birds, Zoological Gardens, Bristc
England)
During 1972 a Victoria Crowned Pigeon {Goura victoria ) was hatch!
and reared at Bristol Zoo, which we believe is the first breeding of tb
species in Britain.
The cock bird has been in the collection since 1968 and a hen ws
acquired in February 1971. They have been part of a mixed collectii
in the walk-through tropical bird house since October 1971. Other specs
exhibited here include Rothschild's Mynahs, Nicobar Pigeons, Woo-
peckers, Plovers, Broadbills, Hanging Parrots, Hoopoes and sml
insectivorous species.
Mating began in the middle of December and a few days later the birs
started building a nest in an artificial tree in the centre of the pub:
walking area. The nest was typical of pigeons, an untidy heap of sties
about 18 inches across and it was 14 feet above ground level. The fit
ggg was laid on 11th IVIarch from a branch outside the nest and it bro.
on the floor below. Another was laid on 6th May but there was no sii
of hatching after the incubation period of 28 days. We left it for a f*
days longer but it was stolen before we could check if it had been ferti,
A third egg was laid during June and was removed, addled, after t#
incubation time. The fourth egg, laid in August hatched on in
September.
The parent's food consisted of insectile mixture with chopped fruit, &amp;lt;1
maize, wheat and turkey breeders' pellets. They also had free access,
livefood (maggots and mealworms). Both fed the chick until it left tt
nest on nth October and for several weeks afterwards. It feathei:
quite quickly and for a few days before it left the nest it would stand :
the edge flapping its wings, looking an exact miniature replica of t#
parents except for the less well-developed crest. In about 10 weeks I
was as large as the parents. The only visual difference in the sexes appe&amp;lt;s
to be in size and as far as we can ascertain the youngster is a hen
As described above the Victoria Crowned Pigeon (Goura victoria) b

Th . e H * r u ned Sun gem, Heliactin cor nut a, is found in central and eastern
, * s P ecies 1S rarely seen in captivity, indeed at the time of
nting, I believe the male in my collection to be the only one in this
.untry and probably in Europe. P. H. Hastings brought a number of
ese birds in during the summer of 1957 and has, I believe, imported
*a j - occasional one or two since then (Hastings, 1969). M. W
ifford imported two males during the spring of 1971.
One of the males imported by Clifford went to a collection in the north
ngland; it was an adult. This bird died during the latter part of 1971
e to a number of abcesses forming in and around the bill. The other
lie, which was immature, I purchased.
Adult males are approximately \\ in. overall length. As if in. is taken
with the tail feathers and a further J in. by the bill, it can be seen that
: bungem is one of the smallest of the Trochilidae if the bodysize only
taken into account. I have read that if the tail were taken away
cornuta could be compared to the smallest of birds, the Bee Humming-
d Calypte helenae (Greenewalt, i960). Not having seen a live specimen
the latter l am not in a position to argue. I would point out, however
;t , e Recld,sh Hermit, Phaethornis ruber, is certainly smaller bodywise
n the Sungem. J
The adult male Horned Sungem has upper parts of shining greenish
d which reflect a coppery sheen in certain lights. Sides of head are
rety black which is carried on to the throat and terminates in two
nts on the upper breast. Occasionally these feathers (hereafter
:rred to as the beard) merge into a single point. The sides of the neck
1 upper breast are pure white, these feathers forming a ruff thus
alighting the velvety black beard. Lower breast and belly are also
te, but as these feathers are not so dense as those which form the ruff
f ,* not have the intense whiteness of the latter. The crown is
:enng dark blue, at the sides of which are iridescent tufts (hereafter
rred to as horns), which are glittering golden green turning to
enng ruby red at the base. In certain lights these horns appear blue
;pt tor the base which always appears as ruby red. The tail feathers
narrow, pointed and much graduated. The central pair being shining
: ? reen the remainder white with the outer edge green. At no
: is the tail held in a forked position; I mention this having seen
trations depicting the species with a forked tail.
emales are very much like the males, but lack the glittering feathers
he crown and the black beard. Also the outer tail feathers have a
k oblique band near the base.

A. J. MOBBS--THE HORNED SUNGEM HUMMINGBIRD
As already mentioned, the male I have in my collection was in immatui
plumage at the time of purchase. It was very much like a female in appel
ance except for a thin line of glittering blue feathers along the centre of t;
crown and a few black feathers on the upper throat. The blue feathu
are erectile in the adult; in the immature bird they were small ai
insignificant. Like the female, the immature male had an oblique bki
band near the base of the outer tail feathers. The two central featho
were shining dark green, but in the immature bird they were broader a!
not so long as in the adult.
I purchased the Sungem on 21st May 1971. Other than being son-
what fatigued after the long journey from Brazil, the bird was in excelkt
health and the following morning, after a good night's rest, was in excelkt
spirits. In fact as soon as the birdroom lights were turned on, the b:i
commenced to sing most exuberantly.
I believe this bird may have been moulting at the time of purcha:,
but it was not until 23rd June, that I noticed feathers being shed in ay
number and then it was breast feathers only which were found in 1e
bird's cage. It was another month before any flight feathers were sh..
Shortly after this, the bird commenced to moult in earnest and each web
a little more of the black beard appeared. Half the flight-feathers Id
been renewed before any tail feathers were shed. The black and whe
outer feathers were the first to go and it was 27th November, before i[euro]
two central green feathers were dropped.
The iridescent feathers on the crown and the horns are of course *
outstanding feature of this species and as there was no sign of these com:g
through until the beginning of November, I had by then begun to desp i
of ever seeing my bird with horns. However, on the same day as &amp;lt;
central tail feathers were dropped, I wrote in my diary " The horns (
at last showing on the Sungem!
As can be seen, the moult from immature to adult plumage wasr

Perhaps I should point out that although this was an exceptionally sb
moult, the bird was in excellent health throughout and when it (

interesting to see how long it takes the Sungem to complete a noni
annual moult.
I have found the Horned Sungem to be one of the most robust of *&amp;lt;
smaller hummingbirds; it is also one of the most vocal. It is rare ind&amp;lt;(
for me to enter the birdroom and not hear this bird singing, in fact fr&amp;gt;t
first light until approximately 7 p.m., it is rarely silent. The sq
consists of an oft repeated chittering note terminated with a loud chirr \
note which is repeated three or four times. This song is sung bothi
the wing and when the bird is at rest. In both cases it is uttered ahr*
continuously with a break of only a second or two in between each phs-

As well as the song, the Sungem will on occasions utter a loud "twitting "
)te. This is heard especially when the bird is inspecting a strange
.ject or when alarmed. Perhaps I should add that this note seems to
used only when the bird is on the wing.
As with most of my tiny hummers, the Sungem is housed in a cage on
own. The cage front is i in. by Jin. welded mesh, painted black,
lere are two doors cut into the mesh, each 7 in. by 6 in. To prevent
ury to my hands and to the bird, black adhesive tape surrounds each
ening I mention this because the Sungem often displays to this tape,
will also on occasions display to one of the perches in its cage. When
splaymg to the tape, the bird moves from side to side on rapidly beating

formmg the rapid movements already mentioned, the bird will occa-
na /j .* ver dir ectly above the perch, touching it with its bill and
ended beard feathers, after which the bird alights and goes through
actions of mating. Throughout the display procedure the beard is

prising as I should have thought these feathers would be used during
display even more so than the black beard.

his is not at all uncommon. When the Sungem preens its wing butts

t the time of purchase, I fed the Sungem a mixture of Super Hydramin
sugar. After a week on this mixture, I persuaded the bird to take

e and clear honey. I would not call this bird highly insectivorous

being sprayed and because of this, I subject it to one a week only, prior
cleaning its cage. . . ,
Claw trimming is an exacting chore which has to be earned o^i
periodically. As the Sungem has the smallest legs and feet of any sped,
I have yet encountered, the task has proved even more harrowing th|
usual. Unlike the Reddish Hermit (Mobbs, 1971), the bill of the Sunge,
does not require trimming. It did become overgrown a few months aft
purchase, but the overgrown portion sloughed off of its own accord.
There is a belief that if birds are supplied with perches of a differe:
thickness, the need for claw trimming is eliminated. This is not the ca;
with hummingbirds and these birds should always be supplied with perch
which they can grip with ease, otherwise their claws will eventually becon
deformed. I might add, it is extremely cruel to allow the claws oil
hummingbird to become overgrown, as these birds use their claws ir
preening areas which cannot be reached with the bill.

f the I C ; B - P ' we cli PP ed the flight feathers of one wing and turned
im out with our other storks at liberty in the grounds where he soon
:ttled down and spent the winter and following spring. During the
immer he gradually moulted his flight feathers and became airborne
ram in August. He stayed with us for some weeks and made a fine
ght on the wing, always returning in the evenings. At the beginning of
sptember however the migrating urge was evidently too strong and he
sappeared. He was by now in perfect condition so I hope he was able
make the long journey.
Sacred Ibis reared five young. We have bred so many of these that we
ted a few at liberty. They stayed well for months soaring above the
ounds and foraging in the nearby fields. At nightfall they always
turned to roost on the aviary containing the breeding colony,
tentually however they started to wander. One was caught and sent to
imbndge who passed it to Len Hill at Bourton-on-the-Water who
adly returned it to us. Another was reported up in the Leicester area
it we never heard any more of it.
Scarlet Ibis nested and laid but the eggs came to nothing. I think that
s early part of the summer was too cold and wet. The only time they
tlly did well was the first time we bred them in 1970 and that summer
3re was a fairly long hot dry spell of weather.
Our self maintaining flock of Cape Penguins is at the time of writing
wn to nine birds--the lowest since they started to breed regularly
rt of the reason for this is that some of the original birds imported in
52 have died obviously from old age so that the death rate has exceeded
; birth rate.
rhe old pair of Blue and Yellow macaws reared two fine young ones
king seventeen all told since they started breeding in 1965. A pair of
d and Yellows reared two for the second year in succession. What is
ticularly interesting is that a pair of our own home-bred Blue and
Hows nested and laid this year. They were six years old. Unfortu-
ely the eggs came to nothing and we hope for better luck next year,
unk that this is quite as important as a first breeding if we are ever to
iblish breeding stocks of foreign birds.
-readbeater s cockatoos reared one, Roseates did nothing largely due to
death of our old breeding hen the previous winter. We have kept
eral of her progeny but so far they do not appear to be mature enough
breed. Citron Crests hatched a chick but let it die. Umbrella
katoos reared a nice young one--the third in four years. They never

We have four species of Amazons at Rode including a pair of Orang
winged. The latter are very pugnacious and have to be kept on their ow
Last spring we were as usual short of aviary space so we decided to p 1
them in a little aviary and wing clip them so that they could wand
loose during the day. In quite a short space of time they moulted the
clipped flights and started to fly, since when they have been a grej
success as liberty birds, homing to their tiny aviary every night and sleepir
in their nest box. Their colouring is a perfect camouflage and when tlr
land in a tree, they just disappear.
New arrivals among our parrot collection in 1972 were two pairs :
Red-sided Eclectus, a Black Lory and a New Zealand Kea.
Twelve grey Peacock Pheasants were bred and quite a few Goldi
Pheasants were reared at liberty by their own mothers. Exactly how ma&amp;apos;
it is difficult to say, but at least three hens were seen with young and o*
liberty flock is well up in numbers with immature birds. There is a gol
deal of extra work in rearing pheasants so we now concentrate on rearij
the more valuable species by hand and just raise a few of the common
ones to keep the numbers up.
We have a somewhat elderly cock Himalayan Monal kindly deposit 1
with us years ago by the Rev. P. K. Venner. This bird is infertile so s
decided to give him his liberty on the grounds. As usual with pheasan ,
from being a nervous bird in an aviary where we hardly saw him, he Is
become quite tame and looks truly splendid as he strides about at 1e
edge of the wood. He is full winged but never flies except to roc..
We see far more of him than of those kept in an aviary.
Blue Crossoptilons have been a disappointment as liberty bin,
We built up a flock of nine which stayed well for a while, but the coos
became aggressive in the spring and they scattered over the surround^
countryside, never to be seen again. We have found the same vd
Swinhoe's which, once they are mature, are solitary and aggressb
New arrivals in 1972 were two immature Great Argus Pheasants. Th&amp;lt;
were purchased as a pair but I am afraid are moulting out two cocks.
Our liberty flock of Carolina Ducks continues to increase and we h &amp;lt;
counted as many as fifty birds at feeding time in the winter. At least &amp;lt;\0x25A0&amp;lt;
pair with young have been seen on the River Frome nearby so therii:
reason to believe that some pairs go off and rear their young unaidi
bringing them back to join the main flock when they can fly. As v
Carolinas increase, so do the Mandarins decrease in numbers, large!
think because the Carolinas usurp every available nest box at breeding tie
A small number of other ducks and geese were reared including Pint;*
Tufted and Red-crested Pochard, Barnacle, Barheaded and Lesser WhjJ
fronted Geese. *
I have sadly to record the death of our old Lidth s Jay. This Ip
must have been well over twenty years old and I have previously record
his past history.

, The followm g studies and observations were accomplished while I was
mrator of Birds at the Brookfield Zoo, Chicago. I wish to thank the
mowing individuals who assisted me in compiling the data on egg and
hick weights and measurements: Paul R. Meppiel, John Gruetter,
nd Ann Owens.
In September 1969, three pairs of South African Buttonquail Turnix
nvatica lepurna were obtained from a local dealer. They were imported
lid-trapped birds. They were placed in a cage 3 x 1 metre which they
lared with Nyassa Love birds, Double-banded Sandgrouse, Kittiitz
and Piover and Chestnut-backed Sparrow-lark. The African Waterhole
xhibit as it was called was provided with sand and plastic boxhood
umps. All of the above species got along quite compatibly. The
eeding of the hemipode appears to be first recorded for the Americas.

The calls I can attribute to this species are as follows:
The flock call is a high pitched almost inaudible chirping sound.
The alarm call is similar but much louder.
The female utters the courtship booming sound, and a growling bu:
used to threaten other birds.
The male utters a trumpeting buzz to threaten other males.
Courtship
Courtship begins in early February. It is initiated by the polyandro i
hen. She begins to take long strides--back parallel to the ground wh)
gently rocking the body back and forth. Sometimes the hen lies down a I
the head and neck alone assume this rocking motion. This ritual attraci
males into her territory and the next phase is performed in the present
of the cock birds. The female bends the legs and erects itself toi
45 degree angle (shown in the plate) ; the neck is then stretched and t!
oesophagus inflated producing a booming sound reminiscent of a pige:
but deeper. The female next sits and scrapes with the beak. The mi:
then gently pecks her head and nape and copulation occurs. The ferni
sometimes takes this initiative and mounts the male. As far as I kni
this is the only instance of a female bird mounting and actually copulatii
the male.
Nest and Eggs
A simple scrape in the sand is the nest site although the nest is usua]
placed alongside or under a pile of straw or artificial plants. The femi
rolls the eggs about in all directions for 10--20 cm.; later in the day tf]
were rolled back into the nest. The normal clutch is four eggs but sixi
eight eggs were sometimes found in one nest probably the result of t&amp;lt;
hens laying in it. As many as eight nests were built for the three pair-
birds and eggs were deposited in each. They are rolled by the fema
she uses her beak and backs up rolling the egg between her legs. T
first egg was laid on 25th February 1971, eggs are 20 to 28*5 mm. 1
length and 16-20 mm. in width. They weigh 2*75 to 5-1 gms. T
ground colour is cream and they are streaked, spotted or blotched w
chocolate brown. The three hens laid a total of 3 02_ fi e SS s f rom 2

February to 24th September. This averages out to 100+ eggs per hen
in a seven month period or an average of an egg per hen every other day.
Amazing as this may seem the following observations are more startling.
On 26th May at 1.30 p.m. all eggs were taken from the cage. The next
day at 2.10 p.m. five eggs had been laid. At 11.20 a.m. on the 28th
^9 e gS s were evident. The three hens therefore laid 14 eggs in 20 hours.
The largest hen was observed laying an egg at 8.00 a.m. and again at
11.00 a.m.--two to three hour interval. At 8.15 a.m. on the 29th there
vere 27 eggs in the cage and at 5.05 p.m. the same day 35. A total of
# eg? 8 were removed at 10.30 a.m. on the 31st. Egg laying then tapered
&amp;gt;ft a bit as on 1st June there were seven eggs, on the 2nd eleven, and at
:o.45 a.m. only 14. At the peak of laying--28th-29th May--the average
:ggs laid per 24 hours was 5*4 and 4-2 respectively. Only one ovary was
unctional as determined by X-ray and dissection.
(Editorial Note. The very striking egg-laying results which Mr. Flieg
ecords appear to be unique not only for this species but for birds as a
vhole. In order to maintain a more balanced picture it should perhaps
P* inted out that previous observations on the breeding of this and other
urmx species in captivity have shown a more typical egg-laying rate of
ne per day. Mr. Flieg's results suggest some abnormal factors present
ver a seven-day period when observations were made. His reference to
aper-thin shells may also indicate this since Schonwetter's eggshell data
ive a similar shell-weights for this species and the Painted Quail.
,Mr; Flle g' s further comments as follows--" My hypothesis on the
urmx egg production is this. We may assume that in the natural state
hen lays a clutch with one mate, finds another and repeats the perfor-
lance. However, in a crowded situation in direct competition with
^her hens for several males, the stimulus of the presence of the males
iay be enough to increase the hormone flow and speed of ovulation;
11s being a direct result of intraspecific competition. This theory
-quires of coure careful testing to see if it is correct
The male alone incubates the eggs but in the confines of the cage it
:came an impossibility. The broody males were constantly harassed
&amp;apos; , ns , untl1 the y deserted the eggs. Only once was a male able to
itch a clutch in the cage. The incubation period is 12-13 days.

Feeding

<bodyText confidence="0.986436026315789" page_id="58078378"  page_num="58" year="" vol="">
The newly hatched chick is a bill feeder and is fed by the male, the
male picks up the food items and offers them to the young which snatch
them greedily. We start the young birds on very tiny mealworms.
Within two to three days they are feeding themselves on mealworms
game bird crumbles, and tiny grass seeds sprinkled with LIV as a supple-
ment. The chicks are fed many times at least once per hour and aftei
feeding are called back to be brooded by the male.
We tried unsuccessfully to hand-feed the young although they wer&amp;lt;
fed many times day and night. Males were not broody in the presence o:
hens but when isolated from the females they never refused to accep
chicks. At one time&quot; when a group hatched, too large for one bird t&amp;lt;
accommodate, we introduced another male into the same cage and botl
birds assumed care of the young. The chicks that hatched in the com
munal cage would run to the hen also for food, taking it from her beal
although she had no intention of feeding them.
Captive Management
For optimum breeding in the species, it is important that a sex rati&amp;apos;
of two to three males per female be used. M ales can then be remove&amp;apos;
to rear the young without loss of fertility. Males are very broody an&amp;lt;
two or more can be placed into a single cage with their broods withou
any fear of aggression. The young are able to take care of themselve
at about three days of age and can safely be removed from the parent #
age 5 days.
Growth and Maturation of Young
The chick hatches with only down. On the second day the primarie
begin to show and the down attached to their tips, and the quill-sheatf
slough off them on the 14th day. The hatching weight is doubled at or
week of age. Flight is achieved at 7-11 days of age. At this age feathei
appear on the rump, back and sides of back. At 13 days of age feathei
begin on abdomen and middle breast. On the 18th day head and thig
quills appear, the downy tips fall off the tail-feathers and full plumage
attained. On the 22nd day yellow appears on the throat and minimui
adult proportions are achieved at 27 days of age. At this point the ma
growth curve levels off and females continue to grow. At 37 days of ag
copulation occurred among the young birds and at 39 days sexes a
distinguishable by size, weight and measurements. The first eggs a
laid at age four months. The Growth and Maturation of this speci&amp;lt;
was contrasted with that of a Galliform bird, the Painted Qua

KEEPING AND BREEDING THE COLLARED
SCOPS OWL
Otus bakkamoena

Introduction

Although diverse species of the Strigiformes are distributed over the
tire surface of the earth, with the exception of the Antartic, and many
these species have been known to aviculture for many years, relatively
tie detailed information seems to have been recorded in concise form,
hen I decided to specialise in keeping and attempting to breed Owls in
70, I resolved to make a modest contribution to recorded information.
The present notes refer to the Collared Scops Owl, the reason being
it a friend of mine, Mr. Harry Smith succeeded in breeding this species
1972 and due to pressure of business he has asked me to record the
tails. The information recorded below is an amalgam of Mr. Smiths'
perience in breeding these birds, a collation of extracts from the writings
other authors and my own experience in maintaining two males in
otivity for three years.

If any readers of this magazine can enlarge on, corroborate or have an)
reason to think any of the remarks erroneous, I hope that they will eithe;
write an article or letter to the editor, or to me. It is only by pooling
information that any significant contribution to science can be made.
Description
The sub-species of Otus bakkamoena, are from written descriptions
very similar in appearance and the identification of an individual wouk
seem to be rather difficult without access to a comprehensive reference
collection.
For a detailed description, I include the details of the colouration of nr
birds, which although imported from Northern India are of uncertaii
identity. Iris dark brown. Eyelids and tear streak dark brown, th
edges of the eyelids are pink. Face fawn. Lower eyebrow white, th
upper eyebrows which stretch to the upper side of the ear are fawrj
The face is edged with dark brown. The crown is dark brown, mottle*
with lighter shades of brown. Breast fawn, with pronounced broke
vertical barring of dark brown, faint transverse barring of greyish browr
Back medium brown, mottled with dark brown--edged with a row of faw:
feathers. Flight and tail feathers horizontally barred with alternate stripe
of light and dark brown. Legs feathered, but toes naked, toe colon
greyish pink. Claws horn coloured with grey tips. Cere pink, beak hor
coloured. Length 8 |ins.
The species has a wide distribution, from the Persian Gulf throug
Pakistan, India, Burma, China, Japan, Korea and Ussuriland and sout
through Indo-China, Malaysia, and Indonesia, to Java, Borneo, and th
Philippines.
Calls
Various authors give the call as " too-whoo ", " kwo-oo or " wo-wo-w*
wo-o, o-o " and also mention another call of "kwow" repeated in qui(
succession.
My own birds (two adult males and the two sub-adults bred by M
H. Smith) utter a call of " he-ooo ", with the first syllable more emphasise
and higher in pitch. They also repeat a growling "kwow" in quic
succession, the head being thrust forward and bowed with each ca^
My birds also emit a greeting call either to each other, or to me when
approach their flight with food, which can be best described as a plaintr
mew. I have also observed my birds looking into each other's faces ar
making a twittering call.
When alarmed or angry, my Collared Scops Owls fan their wings, thru
their heads forward, clap their beaks and make a deep throaty growl.

Food
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.987441166666667" page_id="58078381"  page_num="61" year="" vol="">
Authors cite insects as forming the bulk of the Collared Scops Owl's
iiet, although birds, small rodents and bats are mentioned. My birds
eadily take white mice and day old chicks, the latter being preferred.
l have offered live locusts, but although some were taken, they were
nostly ignored; mealworms remained in the flight for many days, but as
hey were not touched were ultimately removed.
It might be opportune to mention here, that in the past and to a lesser
ixtent today, many captive raptors die unnecessarily as the result of incorrect
eeding. My two original birds were bought by a friend of mine who saw
hem at a well-known dealers', after admiring them but explaining that she
vas unable to provide a suitable diet, the vendor explained that he was
eeding them entirely on minced raw beef and that was perfectly adequate
tfter being assured that beef was a suitable diet, my friend bought two of
hese Owls, but after they settled in her accommodation it was obvious that
oth birds were seriously ill, being very thin and weak. Fortunately the
iet was immediately changed to mice and a complete recovery was made
y both birds, which were then transferred to my collection. Sub-
squent investigation showed that the dealer in question imported several
mall Indian Owls, but all gradually deteriorated in health and I feel
srtain that this deterioration can be attributed to the unsuitable diet.
Another instance brought to my notice, was that of a dealer who imported
number of Scops Owls and only offered whole Guinea pigs as food,
if course, such large carcasses are totally unsuitable for small Owls as they
&amp;apos;e unable to break them up. I understand that this thoughtlessness
lused the death of most of the Owls.
I think that the rule that should be applied to all Owls, is that they
iould be fed whole carcasses (insect, bird or mammal) which are of a
litable size to be eaten in their entirety.
Nidification
The Collared Scops Owl nests in hollows in trees, cavities in buildings
cliffs or in the bases of large nests, such as those of Vultures. Two to
&amp;apos;e white eggs are laid from December to April depending upon locality
id measure in average of 35 mm. x 28 mm.
Breeding in Captivity
It would seem that Scops Owls have so far only been bred infrequently
d I can find no previous record of the Collared Scops Owl breeding in
is country. &amp;
The Scops Owl, Otus scops , (Meade-Waldo 1899) and White-faced

have searched through available literature, I can find nothing to indicate
that any youngsters were reared.
The Collared Scops Owl was bred with considerable success at the
Zoological Gardens Dehiwela, Ceylon, during the 1940's. Several pairs
were kept in a large aviary along with a solitary Black Bittern. Nest-boxes
were situated in opposite corners of the aviary and the birds bred frequently
The birds bred by Mr. H. Smith at Basildon, Essex, were importec
during the summer of 1970 and were thought to be two males and tw(
females. The four birds were housed in an outside aviary in Mr. Smith'
collection which, until 1971, was in Devon. In 1971 the collection wa
moved to Essex and while a new zoo was under construction, the Collarei
Scops Owls were housed temporarily in a 4 ft. stock cage in a draugh
proof and well lighted, but unheated, shed. It was in this accommodatioi
that the breeding occurred.
In early May 1972 it was noticed that two of the Scops Owls had paire&amp;lt;
and courtship behaviour was observed, therefore two nest-boxes eacl
12 in. x 12 in. x 12 in. with a vee-shaped entrance hole, were stood on th
floor in opposite corners of the cage. The mating pair occupied one bo
immediately and three eggs were laid, all hatched, but one disappeare
after a week. The remaining two youngsters were reared without problem
and left the nest-box when between five and six weeks old. The youngster
were identical in size and colouration to the parents, there would appea
to be no juvenile stage regarding colouration. Unfortunately it was nc
possible to examine the nest frequently, so period of incubation, dates c
laying, hatching etc. are not known. The adult birds were rather sh
and resented disturbance, so they were left alone as much as possibl
The two other adult birds remained in the cage throughout this peno
and no friction was noticed.
Mr. Smith's owls are all fed entirely on chicks and the Collared Sco]
Owls reared two strong youngsters on this diet without additives. The
also had clean water for bathing always available. Many owls bai
frequently and my Collared Scops bath on average three times a wee
I have on several occasions observed incubating owls of various specie
bath and then return to the nest with the feathers very wet. I thir
therefore that it is most important that bathing facilities are always availab
for incubating owls, as they would seem to use this method of adjustii
the humidity of the nest to the correct level for hatching. It should al
be noted that owls will not normally bath in water that is stale or dirt
When independent, Mr. Smith's two young owls were transferred
my collection and on comparison proved to be identical in size, markinj
and colouration to my two original birds (described earlier).
With only Mr. Smith's breeding pair of certain sex, it is difficult to ma
any meaningful observation on factors that indicate a bird s sex, howev,
going purely on this very slender evidence it would seem that the feme
is larger and has darker and more pronounced marking on the crown
this however may first prove to be individual variation.

Conclusions
Obviously with my limited experience and the scanty information at
iy disposal any conclusion will have to be recognised as being provisional.
. would seem that Scops Owls can be bred in captivity without too much
ouble, the paucity of previous successes, probably results from few
tempts rather than insurmountable problems.
As described above, the Collared Scops Owl, Otus bakkamoena , has been
e by Mr. H. Smith. It is believed that this may be a first success.
Any member or reader knowing of a previous breeding of this species in
reat Britain or Northern Ireland is requested to communicate at once
ith the Hon. Assistant Editor.

THE LONG-TAILED TIT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991772763157895" page_id="58078395"  page_num="75" year="" vol="">
By C. J. O. Harrison (Berkhamsted, Herts., England)
The Long-tailed Tit, Aegithalos caudatus, is one of the loveliest of our
mall, native species. It presents some difficulties as an avicultural
abject. It is one of those very small, constantly active species; finding
ny morsels of food on the twigs, branches and leaves of trees and shrubs.
[ appears to have a high metabolic rate and a need to constantly stoke-up
. f **Ar d * erefore requires careful provision of food to ensure that
is available when needed and also to ensure that each individual is able
" obtain a reasonable share.
Works on ornithology do not suggest any way of sexing this species
it some aviculturists who have had experience in keeping them are of
ie opinion that they can normally be sexed by comparison of the head
arkings. On either side of an otherwise pale head a bold dark band of
ackish brown extends back over the eye to the nape. In the living bird
is certainly varied between individuals, and the fine photograph by
erek Washington, used as a frontispiece for this number of the magazine
*ws a close view of the heads of two young birds, illustrating the extent
which these markings may vary. Birds with broad markings are said
be males, those with narrower markings females. Unfortunately this
nation is not apparent to the same extent in museum specimens, possibly
a result of movement of the skin during preparation of preserved speci-
als and it is not possible to cross-check from this source. In view of
&amp;apos;&amp;apos; vanatl0n in plumage pattern and colour throughout the geographical
&amp;apos; f ' &amp;apos; S P * SS1 " e this S6XuaI di &amp;rence would only apply to some races.
nother problem for the avicultunst who tries to breed this species is
b provision of suitable nest material. One principal constituent, which
-ks together the fragments of moss and lichen to form the domed nest
: , Long-tailed Tit is fresh spiders' webs. Spiders' webs are a natural
erial which is usually to hand somewhere in a wild area, but is extremely
-icult to supply in adequate quantities in the confines of an aviary and I
&amp;apos; e not heard of a really effective and generally available substitute,
t is perhaps a mercy that so few of the birds which we try to keep
this material to bind the nest together. If one examines the breeding
&amp;apos;Mrds in tropical and subtropical regions, it becomes apparent that a
prising number of smaller, insectivorous birds use this material and a
ic element for binding and shaping the nest. In such regions spiders
i to be larger and more plentiful and there is likely to be a more adequate
ply of bigger and stronger spiders' webs to utilise for this purpose.

ON KEEPING FREE-WINGED WATERFOWL
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994065775" page_id="58078396"  page_num="70" year="" vol="">
By J. O. D'Eath (Monken Hadley, Herts, England)
Having eschewed an interest in ornithology at an early age it was in myi
two closing years at school that my attention became focussed more
specifically on aviculture and waterfowl in particular. Thus it was inj
IQ20 that I based the foundations of my collection. It started in a modest
wav with several Common Shelduck (Tadorna tadorna) reared from eggs
lifted in the wild on the Somerset coastline. During the passage of time,
now some 40 years, the collection grew in size and accommodated as many
as qo different species including some rarities and one derived grea
pleasure from breeding successes personal or otherwise, but of courst
disappointment and failure outweighed these as it always will.
I suppose as one grows older one becomes more aesthetic in one 1
outlook and the appeal of seeing birds at liberty grows stronger.
Therefore in the last few years I have been prompted to experimen,
with free-wing species. This of course has been done by others before
but the purpose of these notes is to encourage the younger generation 0,
waterfowl keepers to be bold enough to experiment.
I must assume that the governing measure of success must be loca
habitat and therefore where some may succeed others may fail. It mus
be obvious that if one's collection for example is geographically situate,
near attractive wet-land or on a riverine site then losses must occu,
I am situated in an urban area and, in spite of this, have been surprise
at being able to hold unlikely species. I will now turn to the individu;
species of birds currently free-winged in the collection and comment 0
each.
Mandarin (Aix galericulata)
Apart from being one of the most spectacular plumaged of the waterfov
this species is undoubtedly the most likely to succeed as a free-wir
subject. It has of course established itself in the wdd in various parts *
the United Kingdom. I have maintained 10/15 pairs here for a num
of years and it is an unceasing delight to see these birds flig in
land at one's feet at feeding time. In Spring I derive the greatest pleasu
from seeing the Mandarin pairs prospecting for nesting sit^s sometim
60 ft. up in tall trees. The late J. C. Laidlay established a similar colo,
in his small garden on the banks of the Tay in Perth, Scotland an j
even today as many as forty Mandarin may be seen flighting in to
very small concrete pools. They also return to nest in boxes put 5
for them. Of the Mandarin I rear each year, I usually release about If
pairs to maintain the stock. By no means all the free-wing b ' rds &quot; es J
the property and it is usually not until the beginning of October that of

J. O. D EATH KEEPING FREE-WINGED WATERFOWL
es birds reared by their parents coming into to feed. Mandarins are
;ry fond of acorns and may be the presence of a good number of Oaks
ire has some bearing on their autumnal showing.
4R0lina (Aix sponsa )
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.976706648648649" page_id="58078397"  page_num="71" year="" vol="">
A similar bird in its habits to the Mandarin but not quite so successful
my opinion. Its flight is low and undoubtedly it does not propagate
;elf so freely in the wild, hence one has to continually rear and release
ung birds to maintain the stock. Nevertheless they would appear to
: good stayers.
aned Goose (Chenonetta jubata)
Supposedly allied to the above in science and another suitable subject
r liberty. I started with an unpinioned male paired to a pinioned
nale and have progressed from there. These birds are very confiding
d tame by nature and it is nice to see them sitting on gate-posts on the
re penmeter fence and not taking wing till one almost touches them,
feilow aviculturist in Essex who had some of my original stock now
3 a sizeable free-wing colony. My Maned Geese do not seem to be
arboreal in the habits as the Mandarin and Carolina, but as already
:ntioned use gate posts and fences for perching.
[iLi Pintail (Anas georgica spinicauda)
y one time after the War, this species was a rare one in collections
1 1 well remember obtaining the first two pairs to come into a private
lection from a Dutch dealer. Since those early days they have been
ely bred and have now reached the stage where they are difficult to sell
wever, on the credit side of the balance, I have found them excellent
ijects at liberty and they visit the various small ponds in turn. For the
t time this year a pair bred away and returned in July with four fully
wn young which were caught and ringed with Avicultural Society
?s. My stock are extremely tame and it is sometimes difficult to
iberately get them on wing.
&amp;gt;er (Somateria mollissima)
&amp;apos;or many years now, I have made a point of not pinioning this species,
to be honest not for the purpose of maintaining a liberty stock.
&quot; Eider in captivity is a gross feeder and becomes overweight and if
:ing on wing has difficulty in maintaining altitude. I always have
adult pairs and in the last 20 years have experienced only two losses
2 recovered). In both cases these were females, the latter bearing an
cultural Society ring was recovered about 10 miles away. The other
not return. They will occasionally fly the width of the pond,
lcularly in Spring.

Rfd-bill Whistling Duck (Dendrocygna autumnalis autumnalis)
This is an ideal free-wing subject and over the years according to
breeding success I have always had a small number of this species at
liberty. They are exceedingly tame and tree-perching, and with me
never wander beyond the confines of the collection. I have likewise had
the individual Fulvous (D. bicolor ) under the same conditions If m^
memory serves me right I recall a small flock of White-faced Whistlers
free-winged at the famous Walcot Hall collection of Messrs. R. &amp; N
Stevens before World War II. I think the whole family Dendrocygnai
are very suitable subjects for liberty birds.
Common Teal {Anas crecca crecca)
I would not say that this species is guaranteed to stay, but 1 havi
enjoyed reasonable success and currently have two males which have beei
in the collection for five years but which do disappear for brief periods
Barnacle Geese {Branta leucopsis)
For some reason this species breeds well in the collection and I havj
annually liberated 6/12 birds. I think the main basis to start is to have
free-wing gander paired to a breeding female. The ensuent family wJ
then usually stay together. One can then carry it a stage farther b
feather-clipping one or two of the brood for the first year. At^ one time
had a small flock of 12 on wing for 3 years and when they finally decide
to leave they appropriately moved to the Wildfowl Trust at Slimbri g
and joined the wild White-fronts, causing some consternation and head
scratching among the experts who were baffled by the sudden extensio
of the Barnacles known range in the British Isles. Owing to lack of spac
I have not experimented with other species of geese, but in large
collections such as Slimbridge and elsewhere a greater variety of gees
have been successfully kept at liberty over the years.
Common Shelduck {Tadorna tadorna)
Although frowned upon by most Waterfowl keepers as a common bin
this species is undoubtedly one of the most colourful of our native bird
Here again a start was made by pairing a free-wing male to a pinioned uc
Being a marine duck I was extremely sceptical of success, thinking t
the call of the sea would prove too much. However, this was not tt
case and I now have five birds on the wing. It is interesting to no
that whilst in their natural habitat of the shore-line they have no obstacl
to negotiate and here they have to negotiate tall trees to effect a landii
and they accomplish this with far greater expertise than wild Mallard.
Knobnose Goose or Comb Duck ( Sarkidiornis melanotos melanotus)
About five years ago I reared a number of these birds, the fem#
laying 13 eggs in her first clutch. From the surplus undisposed ol
retained a pair unpinioned, which were feather-clipped their first ye;

These have successfully stayed ever since and it is interesting to note that
hey always fly independently and not together. The male, however,
ioes make far-ranging flights off the property and is sometimes away for
lours at a time. It is always with a sigh of relief when I see him safely
lack again within the confines of the collection. I was anticipating that
hey might breed away from the property like some of the Mandarin but
o far this has not occurred.
lUMMARY
As I mentioned initially, the foregoing notes are intended to encourage
waterfowl keepers to experiment on similar modest lines to myself and
am sure the great pleasure they derive from any success achieved will be
n ample reward. There are obviously numerous other species which
/ould be suitable subjects for experiment and this can only be ascertained on
trial and error principle. The free-wing plan can sometimes operate
n a reverse lease-lend " basic and I have from time to time had wild
irds fly in and pair to pinioned females. Recently this Spring, a male
hoveller (Spatula clypeata) has arrived and paired to a female in the
allection and similar instances with European Teal and Tufted Duck
ave occurred in the past.

LUMAGE PATTERN IN THE BUFF VARIETIES

By C. J. O. Harrison (Berkhamsted, Herts., England)
I recently had the opportunity to observe a number of individuals of a
iff strain of the House Sparrow, Passer domestkus, bred by Mr. T. Dooley,
td through the kindness of Mr. John Dowling have received specimens
the buff variety of the Painted Quail, Excalf,actoria chinensis . In
ferring to a buff variety I mean the non-eumelanic variant in which
ack melanin pigment is usually absent from the plumage. These two
rms are of special interest, because of the extent to which not only the
estnut-red melanin but also some black-pigmented signal elements of
e normal male plumage pattern are retained.
In the sparrows the females appear a light, buffy-brown. The males
tain in addition the broad chestnut-red band across the side of the head
d similar colour on the wings and the mantle. They also have a black
roat patch present to some degree, and in most individuals some black
iour is also present on the lores. One or two of the birds seen showed
1 )re extensive dark markings on the head.
This retention of marking is even more apparent in the Painted Quail.
ie female of this species shows typical loss of black markings in the buff
lant, the plumage being buff and brown with whitish patches where the

C. J. O. HARRISON--PLUMAGE PATTERN OF SPARROW AND QUAIL
black marks would normally appear on feathers. These pale areas werej
not wholly white on the specimens examined but showed a greyish-blue
tint This might be due to the retention of very small quantities ol
eumelanin thinly dispersed within the feather, but might alternatively b&amp;lt;
caused by the reflection of light from an unpigmented feather structure
since in some non-eumelanic varieties of pigeons the unpigmented feathe:
areas have a bluish-grey tint for this reason. ,
The chestnut-red pigment present in small quantities, tinting the throat
eyestripe and pale streaks of the back, and present to varying degree;
elsewhere in the plumage, is retained in the variant female. Dari
markings such as the ventral barring in the typical form are due to ;
combination of both brown and black pigment, and although the black i
lost in the variant form, similar markings in brown are still present
The loss of colour is most apparent on the flight feathers and primar;
coverts of the wings which are almost white. The bill is still black an&amp;lt;
there is no suggestion of loss of pigment other than in the plumage.
The male quail shows a similar loss of black markings to that of th
female, where the dorsal plumage and wings are concerned. The hea
and mantle show a series of rows of small greyish-white spots replacin
black marks, but the mottling is less apparent on the back which appear
mainly chestnut-red with paler longitudinal streakings. The mos
striking feature is that the entire ventral plumage pattern, including th
chestnut-red of belly and under tail coverts, and the slate-blue of breas
flanks forehead and tertials, is retained, apparently unchanged. Apai
from a slight loss of black, producing a dark brownish-black, the bol
facial pattern is also retained. One would not immediately associate th:
variation with the other non-eumelanic forms. _
In both these species therefore a variant form occurs in which b.ac
pigment is usually completely lost but in these instances is retained j
some signal markings of the male. Since there is some indivi u
variation it might be argued that the change is produced by a gene
incomplete penetrance and that the presence of these markings mere
reflects the failure of the gene to achieve its full effect.
There is, however, evidence from variant plumages in the Zebra Find
Taeniopygia guttata , such as the " penguin" variety, indicating that tl
bold black breast pattern characteristic of the male may be under separa
genetic control from the remainder of the pattern and that its presence &amp;lt;
absence may occur without affecting the remaining plumage patter
In the House Sparrow and Painted Quail the markings that are retaint
in the buff variant are conspicuous markings characteristic of the specr
and sex. It therefore seems possible that this might be a parallel case
that of the Zebra Finch and that these markings also might be und
separate genetic control from the rest of the plumage and not immediate
affected by a genetic change which otherwise has a modifying effect &amp;lt;j
the plumage in general.

(Tauraco schalowi)
By D. Grenville Roles (Deputy Curator of Birds)
Distribution
Found in suitable localities throughout Angola, Botswana, Zambia,
Rhodesia and the Southern Congo, our pair of Tauraco schalowi
Reichenow) came from the vicinity of Luanda in Angola. The male
arrived in August 1966, the female in May 1971.
Description
Equal to a small pigeon in size but with a long fan-shaped tail and long
aointed crest, these touracos have the typically beautiful plumage and
striking appearance of the " forest-dwelling " species, with light green
lead, neck and breast, sooty black underparts and rump and irridescent
merald and violet-blue back and wing coverts. The tail is entirely
iolet-blue and the flight feathers are brilliant crimson. The bill and
ye-wattle are coral red with a short white stripe in front of and a long
rhite stripe below the large brown eyes. Legs and feet are black.
Accommodation
The aviary is approximately 20 ft. X 8 ft. X 6 ft. high with a shelter
5 ft. X 8 ft. X 9 ft. high at the rear of the flight, a nest pan 7 ins. X 10 ins.
f weldmesh covered by hessian and with a ij ins. x J in. wooden rim, is
xed about 1 ft. from the ceiling in a dark corner of the shelter.
The flight floor is covered with a deep layer of sand over gravel, the
lelter floor is covered with sawdust. The flight is planted with flowering
arrant Ribes sanguineum and Cupressus macrocarpa.
Sharing the aviary are a pair of Blue Eared Pheasants Crossoptilon
intum whom the Touracos ignore; neighbours are a pair of Grey Touracos
orythaixodies c. concolor with whom Tauraco schalowi bicker, and on the
her side a breeding pair of Keas (separated by double mesh of course),
ho are also ignored.

Shortly after her clearance from quarantine and a brief period in a very
rge aviary, the female escaped through a previously unnoticed hole in
e wire netting. She remained at liberty for 6 months, feeding (from
lephoned reports within a +/- mile radius of the Zoo) upon apples,
ackcurrants, blackberries, elderberries and hawthorn berries. Event-
lly she was recaptured in excellent condition, in a cat-trap baited with
ange. She was frequently heard and seen in the Zoo grounds and

provided an exotic spectacle when seen flying between groups of trees.
During this period she was seen to visit a solitary individual of her species
and " bill " with it through the wire in a very friendly fashion, but
persistently attacked a (believed) pair of Tuuraco schalozvi in the aviary next
door but one to the single bird.
On her recapture she was placed with the single specimen, who after a
minutes chase, inspection, and domination, accepted her.
The birds' relationship went from strength to strength and the male,
(as he was to prove himself) was seen feeding the female, who solicited
this action by juvenile wing fluttering and gaping. No recognizable form
of courtship was observed though when one unexpectedly alighted beside
the other they would ii bill ", shaking their heads from side to side and
" flashing " their facial pattern, while both uttering a staccato grumble.
Mating was never observed and no form of nest building was seen to
take place, the first dull white egg being laid on the 13th April, 1972 in
the totally unadorned nest platform. A second egg was laid on the
15th April. One of these was found smashed at the end of the flight
furthest from the nest on the 20th April, the remaining egg disappeared on
the 9th May.
The eggs of the second clutch were laid on the 24th and 26th May,
both eggs hatching on 16th June.
The development of the chicks has been tabled below for comparison
with the development of the two other species of Touraco, whose chicks
we have successfully reared. The data in each case refer to the firsi
successfully reared brood.
Both chicks described are now fully grown and in apparently perfeci
health.
As described above, Schalow's Touraco, Tauraco schalowi has beer
bred at the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust. It is believed that this
may be a first success.
Any member or reader knowing of a previous breeding of this specie;
in Great Britain or Northern Ireland is required to communicate at onc&amp;lt;
with the Assistant Editor.

By A. J. Mobbs (Walsall, England)
The Tourmaline Sunangel, Heliangelus exortis, can be found in the
temperate zone of the Western and Central Andes, subtropical zone of
ihe Eastern Andes of Colombia and of Eastern Ecuador (Peters 1945)
The male is a predomantly dark green bird. The upper parts are not
iridescent, the feathers do have a shine to them, however. The chest and
:orehead are iridescent; chin and upper throat glittering violet-blue;
ower throat glittering red, appearing as pink in certain lights. The tail
vhich is long and deeply forked, has outer feathers of black and the central
)air bronzy green. The primaries are also deep black. The vent and
indertail coverts are white (adding greatly to the beauty of this species)-
here are also white ocular patches.
female * S a ^ S * a .^ ar k # reen bird with a white chin and throat.
The tail is shorter than in the male and not so deeply forked.
The male in my collection, is one of the few hummingbirds I have
iurchased which has not been a new import. It had in fact been in the
ountry 17 months before it came into my possession. I first saw this
ird at m y importer-friend's establishment, where it was housed with an
ssorted batch of hummers, newly arrived from Ecuador. As well as this
lale, there were two other males and one female.
Although I was very taken with the species, all the Sunangels in the
assignment appeared to be extremely belligerent and because of this
decided against purchasing one.
The male which is now in my collection, was orginally sold to a person
ho housed it in a cage in his lounge. These conditions were far from
leal, partly because the bird received no live food. As this was the only
tr owned by this person at the time, he soon grew tired of it and
^entually it was sold to a friend who kept a mixed collection of exotics,
hich included two or three hummingbirds. It was from this person that
acquired the Sunangel.
I have given a brief history of the bird in question, mainly because the
ecies is considered by many to be a difficult one to keep alive in confine-
ent for any length of time. In fact of the four which originally came in,
e male now in my collection is the sole survivor.
A friend of mine who is usually most successful with hummingbirds,
s had no luck with this species. The first Sunangel he acquired, died
n two months, the second and third died within a matter of days.
1 were in seemingly good health at the time of death. Other friends of
I&amp;apos; ne have had reasonable success with this species, but none of the birds
we lived more than four months, even when housed under seemingly
1 "1 conditions. It is therefore, all the more surprising that the male now

could not be classed as suitable for even the most robust of hummingbu

When I purchased the Sunangel, most of its primaries were white
near white. There were also white patches in the outer tail feathei
I put this down to the bird receiving little or no live food during t
period of the moult. As it happened, I purchased the bird just at t

I have mentioned earlier that this species can be most belligerent
&amp;gt;ther hummingbird enthusiasts who have owned Sunangels, wilf I feel
are be ,n agreement with this. It was therefore with some perturbation
la released the Sunangel into my hummingbird flight. The bird was
bviously not ,n the best of health as not only had it moulted incorrectly
was also very much underweight. Perhaps this helped somewhat with
le introduction to the flight, even so the Sunangel did show aggression to
irtain species^ Two birds which helped keep the Sunangel&quot; inks place "
as a male Velvet-purple Coronet, Boissonneaua jardini, and a male
ipphire-vented Puffleg, Eriocnemis luciani. The formed would most
nbably have ignored the Sunangel but for its abnormal plumage
his presumption is based on the fact that the Coronet attacked the
mangel only when the latter was flying. At such times, the Sunangel
owed large areas of white against what was otherwise a predominantly
*rk green bird. I have been unable to house White-necked Jacobins 7
onsuga melkvora or Black Jacobins, Melanotrochilus fuscus , with the
nonet, because of the predominantly black and white plumage of these
ecies. Once the Sunangel had shed the white feathering, the Coronet
The Sapphire-vented Puffleg and the Sunangel disliked each other on

hrst the Sunangel, being the newcomer to an already well established
ection, was wary of the Puffleg and there were times when I feared the

a few months, there developed a pattern of behaviour which appears

consists of one note-Zzzzzt-which is repeated three or four times when
Aere is a slight pause before the note is again repeated. When showing
aggression, the Sunangel uses this same note but it is more harsh, also the
dutiful iridescent throat patch is thrust out more than it is during the
n0 Dming P quiet n periods this hummer will perch on one leg and puff out
its feathers giving the appearance of being ill. While in this position it
will on occasions, sing a subdued version of the normal-type song. As t e
bird dozes, so the song is repeated less frequently until eventually the bird
becomes silent. It needs only a slight disturbance, however, for the
Sunangel to commence singing again.
I have found many species of birds kept in captivity, are encouraged to
sing when music or such sounds as boiling kettles or vacuum-cleaners are
heard. The sunbirds in my collection sing exuberantly when my wife
is using the vacuum-cleaner in the hallway outside the birdroom.
I mention this inducement to sing because until I purchased the Sunange
I had not been aware hummingbirds could also be induced to sing,
The Tourmaline Sunangel, although perhaps not so ready to break mtc
song as the sunbirds, nevertheless is induced to sing when hearing prolongec
bouts of music, etc. One sound in particular which never fails to persuad.
this hummer to sing is that of a scrubbing brush being run over th
wire-mesh of the flight. f ,.
In a letter which appeared in the correspondence column of thi
magazine (iQ7i), I gave a list of hummingbird species which 1 hat
observed indulging the habit of resting on one foot. This list did no

By T. S. Johnstone (Stroud, Glos., England)
Aviculturally perhaps the greatest success at Slimbridge during th
last decade has been with the flamingos. . . ,
Before the first birds arrived, I was given the opportunity to visit thos
establishments in Europe and America that had been successful in breedm
flamingos. My object was to gain information about their husbandr
particularly with regard to their diet, environment and colour preservatio.
With this information, a lot of uncanny knowhow from the Hot
D irector, and a deal of experiment a system was evolved.
Starting with twenty Chilean Flamingos in 1961, the number was 1
the autumn of 1972 over three hundred birds of all six forms as follows .-

The first breeding was that of the Caribbean in 1969 and since th
time 77 young of four forms have been reared. The only species th
has yet to lay is the James s. _ . i *
The object of the exercise was to keep as large flocks as possible in
extensive surroundings as possible and to maintain the birds natu,
colour. We felt that these factors together with suitable winter quar ej
might well result in breeding flamingos for the first time in Great Bntai
The diet eventually evolved is a meal made up by milling eqi
quantities of wheat, maize, poultry biscuit, turkey starter crumbs, dn
shrimp and fish meal. The meal is mixed with water to a consistency,
a thick soup. Minced lettuce, carrot and beetroot are added whi
available and the soup is medicated with Tylan as a precaution agad
respiratory diseases, to which James's Flamingo seems to be particula,
^Inasmuch as the breeding pairs of birds have been those in the F
colour and that the colour is rapidly lost when the young birds are her
fed it would seem fair to assume that colour preservation in capt
flamingos is a factor that facilitates successful breeding. Consequent y J
effect of various additives to the feed on plumage was examined over
first few years. It was found that the pigment canthaxanthine was j
most satisfactory and this together with the milk product Wrodopl
are fed each morning mixed into the normal diet. A visit to S
will show how effective this method has been. . i

laturally, and plans are in hand to segregate these for breeding purposes
he races are in separate pens and apart from the James's have com-
&amp;gt;arati\ ely large areas of water and mud over which to wander.
A great deal of trouble has gone into providing suitable nesting-sites
or the birds, and each flock has been provided with a carefully constructed
Atoll . To visitors these appear to be just a mud flat showing above
he water level. First of all the pond has to be drained and the mud
emoved. Tons of hard core are then tipped onto the site of the island to
jrm a large oval, the edges of which, are brought up to within two ins. of
te water level. Concrete is then laid at an angle of 30* over this ridge
nd as a causeway from the ridge to the feeding places on the banks of
le pond. At the narrow ends of the oval the ridge dips to below water
vel in order to allow water to flow through the middle of the island,
part from the central channel the whole area inside the ridge is filled up
ith a mixture of mud and sea-sand to some four ins. above the water
is essential that the water be kept at such a level as to keep the mud in a
insistency that the birds can build their nesting mounds without fear of
.em disintegrating during the laying or incubating periods. Concrete
:sts have been built and are quite satisfactory provided they are raised
) from the hard core to above the mud surface. Suitability of the
aiding material does seem to be of great importance. At New Grounds
nere the soil is heavy clay that bakes hard in the sun, one noted that
ter a shower of rain during the summer, great building activity would
mmence with softened mud. Assessing the amount of mud neccessary
r the flock is difficult as it is not practical to add to it during the nest
.mg activity. The nests are in the shape of flat topped cones some
ins. diameter at the base and 12-15 ins. at the top. The height varies
1 &amp;gt;m nine to eighteen inches. When there are 20 or 30 nests this amount
mud pulled up into heaps usually results in the nests being surrounded
dh water and as the building continues for most of the incubation
nod (28-32 days) in some cases the birds have found difficulty in
lectmg enough mud with which to carry on.
Although flamingos seem able to survive in quite low temperatures it
1 been my experience that they are utterly miserable when left out'in
frost and snow of a Severn Valley winter. The fear of the birds
' tmg frozen in and the subsequent breaking of the tarsi when endeavour-
&amp;apos; to release meant that something had to be done for the birds winter
itort. I therefore built large winter houses over existing water
&amp;apos; rses. Each house had to be close to a public foot-path and the side of
ui mg adjacent to the path had to be a continous window (for the
eht of winter visitors). Strip lighting and infra-red heating are provided,
i floor is of concrete rendered in cement and sloping at an angle of 30*
:he water. Considerable difficulty was experienced in providing a
able surface, for the soles of the birds feet did not take kindly to the
ent. Peat, sand, sawdust and straw were tried, but each of these

became foul so quickly as to be impractical. Rubberised paint seemed at
first to be the solution. It was however found that the daily hosing and
brushing down destroyed the paint in a relatively short time. Finally
the floors have been covered with thin rubber sheeting which can be
easily removed or left in situ for washing purposes. In each house there
is a door over the water course and a small run adjoining so that the birds
can be let out on warm winter days.
After caring for flamingos for ten years, I feel the following observations
may be of interest to keepers of these interesting birds.
All species have been found to be easy to herd in and out of their
houses, always provided the exercise is carried out tentatively, and that a
recalcitrant bird is not chased. Any plan that can be evolved to avoid
catching and handling should be pursued. Handling a number of birds
usually results in one of them getting a tibio-tarsal joint damaged with,
inevitable fatal results. This policy means that the birds should be
pinioned on arrival. In our case, the birds have been feather-cut or
arrival and pinioned later on; but I think that immediate pinioning would
probably be safer. Of course in the Autumn, we have had to catch the
juveniles reared in the Summer for this purpose. In the last seasor
experiments have been made in pinioning the day old chicks on the nest
which has been tried with the Greaters and the Chilean. In the case o
the former it was simplicity itself; one merely lifted the parent s wing
took the chick, performed the necessary operation, and replaced it. No
so with the Chilean. These would all leave the young and one had tim*
to pinion some, but there was a distinct possibility that the downies havinj
been handled would not stay in the nest, but would try to follow th
parents and one had the fear that when the parent returned, the baby woul&amp;lt;
not be able to climb back to safety.
It will be seen from the above that it has been found that the six specie
of flamingos differ considerably in temperament. The Caribbean, whic
are overlooked by the tea terraces and restaurant are the most apprehensive
When the first member of the staff arrives in the morning, althoug
separated by a considerable stretch of water, the birds, even when nesting
will get up and rush to the farthest point. However as the day progress*:
they recover and by the afternoon are quite oblivious of the many visitoi
photographing them.
This initial apprehension does not occur with their cousins the Great*
Flamingos, for while they are laying and incubating, it is possible to wa^
about amongst the nests and to put ones hand under an immovable birc

not mean that they should be disturbed any more than is necessary for tl

There is a tradition among Aviculturists that parrots are vegetarians
id that the eating of meat or any animal food will, among other things
mse them to pluck their feathers. Nevertheless the relish with which

e larger parrots. J ^

D. H. S. RISDON--THE EATING OF MEAT BY PARROTS
and I can remember to this day the excitement of looking into a nest box
chock full of baby parrots. . _ .
Since we came to Rode, we have noted repeated cases of meat eating
among our macaws and cockatoos. This first started when our macaws
began to breed. Remembering what happened at Keston, as soon as
young were hatched the parents were offered extras in the way of bread
and butter, and soaked biscuit as well as chop bones and trimmings off
the joint which they consumed avidly. Incidentally the meat is always
cooked; they do not seem to like it raw, but they will eat raw sprats
holding them in one foot and greedily munching them from head to tail
as if they were eating a banana. . ..
Our liberty macaws will descend on the bird food trolley as it goes
round the grounds in the morning and besides helping themselves to fruit,
readily take sprats and meat intended for the aviary birds.
If given a piece of bread liberally spread with butter, they will carefully
lick off all the butter before eating the bread. They also prefer shortbread
biscuit to other kinds of biscuit presumably because of its higher fat content.
The smaller parrots do not seem so keen on meat. This may be mainly
because they do not recognise it as food, but the larger cockatoos like
Moluccans and Sulphur Crested are equally keen on meat and fish.
What intrigues me is where would parrots get such food in the wild:
It could of course be a substitute for grubs. The beaks of parrots are
certainly designed for gouging into rotten wood, possibly m search oi
these things, but they would have to find a great deal of this food to suppl)
them with what they seem to need. I find it hard to imagine any parrol
catching small active prey, although they might conceivably eat the eggJ)
and young of other birds. , ,
Certain it is, however, that they have a distinct liking for food ol ai
animal origin and eat it so greedily that one gets the impression that t e;
are starving for it. The available literature on parrots in the wild onh
gives a general description of their feeding habits. We all know that the;
take grain, fruit, nuts, blossoms etc., but little seems to have been studiec
as to exactly what they do eat. Perhaps some of our overseas member
who live in " parrot " country could enlighten us.

ASPECTS OF A NEW TROPICAL HOUSE FOR

By Richard Mark Martin (Curator, Padstow Bird Gardens,
Cornwall, England)
Towards the end of 1971 we began work on the largest and most
tportant single development of these relatively new gardens--which
ere opened to the public at Whitsun i 97 o. The, as it transpired to be,
comphshed intention was to have our new free-flight Tropical House
)en l by Easter 1972. Our financial circumstances dictated that we did
uch of the work ourselves, only calling in specialists as and when
*\0x25A0cessary. This arrangement worked surprisingly well, and I think we
l discovered new and unexpected talents.
The mam purpose of these notes is twofold: one is briefly to explain
rtam constructional details which I feel may be of interest and help to
hers considering similar undertakings, while the other concerns the
tabhshmg of plants and birds once the building was completed That
tiers may benefit from our mistakes and successes is, in my opinion, one
the justifications for our existence.
One conclusion which can be drawn straight away from our tropical
use enterprise is that the cost of establishing this kind of near-perfect
ntrolled habitat need not be nearly as prohibitive as one might think,
&amp;apos;careful choice of materials, a little basic constructional knowledge and
ility, a few extra pairs of hands from time to time and much hard work
oomy, if not massive, house similar to ours can be constructed for a sum
the region of #2,000 to #3,000. This is inclusive of setting up the
iler and heating system, and I have little doubt that most tropical houses
it very much more than this.
We w r ere f * rtUnate , ad "ittedly, in being able to make use of some
sting foundations and walls which to some extent governed the shape
size 01 the building. The area had been used long ago as a greenhouse
1 vegetable garden but all that remained were the very thick stone walls
ich measured about two feet wide. At the rear, the wall was some
It. high but at the front it was only 7 ft. We decided to point and make
Id these walls, and at the front to add double-glazing--to effectively
ghten the wall to 11 ft. This we did and the result was to be a
asantly high and well-lit enclosure. (The ground dimensions can be
1 in the accompanying plan.)
Ve wanted a light yet strong roof with good heat insulation properties
transparent enough not to hinder too much the passage of solar
mination; on the other hand we did not want a totally transparent

birds housed therein. Eventually we plumped for a double skin of

But before we could go ahead with all this, the actual ground which at
that time resembled a scrap merchant's back-yard had to be cleared anc
cleaned up. The pond, which is such an important feature of a tropica
house, was to be of a fairly simple shape mainly to facilitate the regulai
daily cleaning necessary in the temperatures applicable to a simulatec
sub-tropical habitat. I thought the plants and shrubs when establishec
would help to conceal its rather blatant artificiality. In addition w&amp;lt;
constructed a shallow second pond at a higher level midway between ;
recirculating waterfall, operated by a submersible pump in the main wate
area to a point some three feet above the higher pond. The idea behint
this ' subsidiary pond, apart from aestheticism, was as a bathing am
watering point for the more timid species, and the waterfall itself 1
appreciated by some, especially sunbirds.
It was decided, without much difficulty, to confine the public to on
viewing area near the entrance. This type of arrangement is preferabl
to a walk-through system in any but the largest of houses as it minimise
disturbance to what is the birds' territory, and thus improves breedin
prospects and probably cuts losses through egg-stealmg, nest-destroyin
and associated vandalism. .
Probably the most intrinsic part of a tropical house situated in
temperate country is the heating and ventilation system. We considere
many ideas before choosing an Afos C 7 solo air heater which incorporate
piped water heating to help spread the output throughout the who
building--a total area of approximately 10,360 cu. ft. This is a high!
versatile oil-fired boiler capable of many heating and ventilative task:
One 12 in. three-speed extractor fan was situated at the opposite end (
the building, but considering conditions experienced last summer, I fe"
we were wrong not to fit a second fan. On hot days, in spite of the fa
working at maximum performance, the room temperature shot up alarn
ingly to in excess of ioo*F at times, although I must admit that it affecte
the public more than the birds! Normally we endeavour to maintain
temperature between 55 and 65*F through a room thermostat.
We took advantage of the heating facilities to locate an observation ar
locust-breeding room and hospital adjoining the Tropical House, fro
where we could keep a discreet eye on the birds (and public!). I was al:
keen to construct some nesting sites within the dividing wall into whi&amp;lt;
by virtue of glass panes we could observe and photograph any nestu
activities. It is still too soon to say if these will be successful.
By the time the actual construction work was finished Easter w
rapidly approaching. The next jobs were landscaping, perching ai
planting. The first thing we did was to build a high long bank of ear
retained by large boulders at the far end of the flight, this we hoped wou
be used for nesting in by kingfishers and bee-eaters. The acquisition

plants, thanks to certain individuals and the Falmouth Parks Department
did not prove difficult, and we soon had the soil prepared (by mixing ii
many bales of peat) and the planting accomplished.
The logs and branches brought in for landscaping and perching reason
helped to compensate for the bareness of the obvious new enclosure
Even so, it looked little like the popular opinion of a jungle, and I wa
afraid that the plants would take years to get established while, ^in th
meantime, the public would begin to mutter darkly. We needn t hav
worried. I fancy by maintaining a high humidity through regula
spraying, and keeping the soil around the plants always moist, we encorn
aged rapid growth. Indeed, at the time of writing (January 1973), w
have just finished a massive pruning and cutting back operation, as one c
two of the plants were threatening to take over the entire building.
Especially vigorous and therefore to be recommended " tall plants
were Cobaea scandens, the passion flower, angel s trumpet, morning glor
Australian silk oak ( Grevillia robusta), Abutilon thompsonii, jasmin, ' rubb(
plant" ( Ficus elastica), Fatsia japonica, bougainvillea, monstera, Clethi
alnifolia and perhaps surprisingly " busy lizzies " which flourished froi
the outset and still are. Among the low-growing plants, the fanubs
nasturtium provided quick and efficient cover, and we have had to be qui
ruthless with it; a huge begonia has been in flower constantly since la
spring; amongst the others, Crinum powelii , a clivia and Fascicular
pitlairnifolia have all done well.
The first of the avian inhabitants were to be a pair of Sunbitter:
(Eurypyga helias) --who quickly made themselves at home and especial
liked to skulk in a thick clump of bamboo which we had planted. Followii
on their heels was a consignment of excellent African birds from Til
and Jane Barnley in Kenya. Included in this consignment were Blac
winged Stilts {Himantopus h. himantopus ), African Jacanas ( Actophilon
africanus ), Woodland Kingfishers {Halcyon senegalensis ), Tacazze ai.
Malachite Sunbirds {Nectarinia tacazze and N. famosa) and a Collar
Pratincole ( Glareola nuchalis). Soon after these were established succes
fully we were able to add Green-backed Tits {Parus monticolus) fnj
India, Zebra Doves {Streptopelia striata) and some Yellow-rump )
Tanagers {Ramphocelus icteronotus).
By and large there were few acclimatisation problems. We were fore
to remove a male Malachite Sunbird as the " true pair " of Tacazzes we
preventing it from feeding, and I think it very likely that we will brel
these in 1973 (at least I am hoping so!). We were unfortunate with c
Green-backed Tits: one was killed, presumably by a Sunbittern, be (
it had learnt its way about, and a replacement hanged its
quite recently; this was a great shame as they were obviously content.
The Collared Pratincole, which was acclimatising nicely, was found c
day, four months after its arrival, in the pond with severe brain dama
In spite of all our efforts it died the next day. I feel it likely that it

Again our breeding pair of European Eagle-Owls (Bubo bubo ) hatched
ree fine chicks on 12th, 14th, and 16th March. The mother is well
customed to people watching her closely and never feels disturbed
iring nesting time. So we are lucky in not having to provide her with
straw-screen, and the Eagle-Owls are one of the very first spring attrac-
&amp;gt;ns for the public every year.
The Black Swans ( Cygnus atratus) fortunately got their young in a fairly
le time in March. Usually these Australians hatch their young during
eir natural springtime, which means winter in Europe.

Two Takahes were hatched at the Mount Bruce Native Bird Resen

It has been estimated that more than a hundred Amboina King Parns
of at least two different sub-species were imported in 1972. It J
gratifying that most appear to have survived and several parrakeet breed;
are now the proud possessors of potential breeding pairs. In this contd
it is interesting that although one of the sub-species has already been bil
in this country the event was not well documented and appears to hci
escaped the notice of most people interested in parrakeet breedh.
The successful rearing of a male and a female Salawati King took pL
in the late Duke of Bedford's Collection at Hayward's Heath whenl
was in the care of F. Gorman. The event is described very briefly 1
the Magazine of the Foreign Bird League (1940).

REVIEW i
THE PARROTS OF SOUTH AMERICA. By Rosemary Low.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996902" page_id="58078432"  page_num="106" year="" vol="">
London: John Gifford, 1972. Price #3'25p.
Although Central and South America contain the greater part of the
world's parrot species, very little information has been available in the
past, in spite of the amount written about the relatively smaller number of
Australian species. With the shift of sources of bird imports over the 1
years an increasing variety of American parrots have become available to
the aviculturist, who at times has found it difficult to discover which
species he had. Rosemary Low's book is therefore an important addition
to parrot literature, as the only work specifically covering this region.
The book is written for the aviculturist and the text constantly reflects
the author's considerable experience in the keeping of these birds. The
opening chapters on purchase, accommodation, feeding, general care, and
breeding contain a lot of good practical advice.
The parrots themselves are grouped in five chapters--headed Macaws,
Conures, Parrakeets and Parrotlets, Small Parrots, and Amazons. This
section brings out one shortcoming of the book. Some 144 species and
their subspecies are involved, but there is no general key to the identification
of the different types of South American parrots and their species groups.
Those familiar with some of the birds may find this satisfactory, but the
beginner with an unknown bird might need to work through most of the
text to identify it. There is an identification key for the Amazon species,
and something of this kind would have been a help elsewhere--with the
Pyrrhura species for instance.
Each genus or natural group of smaller genera is introduced with a
general text, differing considerably in length, seemingly related to the
extent to which the birds are kept, but usually containing information on
the suitability of the species as pets or aviary birds, and sometimes on
their general keeping and breeding. Following this birds are dealt with
as species and subspecies. The text for each, where sufficient information
is available, includes alternative popular names, and a brief description ol
adult and immature birds. Distribution is given, varying from precise
habitat data where available, to a brief statement of geographical region.
This is followed by a section headed&quot; remarks " which usually gives
information on the extent to which the species has been imported and
kept by aviculturists, together with various pieces of information, anc
quotations from published sources, of the general demeanour and needs
of the birds; as well as any facts which are not covered by more specific
headings. Finally there are sections on breeding results, with data or
captive breedings.
The arrangement is a little difficult to follow at times owing to th&amp;lt;
treatment of subspecies. In recent revisions of parrot classification bird.

iich were earlier thought to be separate species have been grouped
*et er under one name. In the present work species and subspecies
i o ten listed with similar headings. Separate English names may be
sd in each case without a clear indication, other than in the abbreviated
tm name, as to which is involved. Some subspecies are, however
, :ed with only subsidiary headings, and a few with no indication of how
;y dlffe f from the described forms. This may reflect the degree of
cultural interest in the birds concerned, and from that viewpoint the
angement may be satisfactory, but otherwise it does not commend
ilt. 1 feel that the species unit should have been more clearly indicated
i that the popular names for subspecies should have been less prominent!
n the plates 42 species are illustrated by colour photographs. There
an appendix note on the taking of, such photographs; and one on
&amp;gt;wn abnormal plumage variations in these species. In spite of
icism the book is a useful and timely addition to avicultural literature.

By Derek Washington (East Grinstead, Sussex, England)
It would seem that no one has yet published an account of breeding
ouse Sparrows Passer domesticus in captivity in Britain. This lack of
[formation was brought to light by C. J. O. Harrison (Avicultural
Iagazine 77 (1971) 131-135 and 78 (1972) 205-209) and the second of
s lists finally pricked my concience and stimulated me to prepare these
)tes. The following account describes breeding attempts, some
Lccessful and some not, between the years 1967 and 1971. Further
terest is added by the fact that the male parent was abnormally coloured,
Ld that this abnormality was not inherited by any of the offspring, even
hen the male was paired back to his daughter.
Towards the end of 1966 I was given an unrelated pair of House
)arrows. The female was normal in colour, but the male was paler
an normal. He showed all the markings of a male, but the colours
ire reduced in intensity giving an overall fawn appearance. The
irmally black bib, for example, was dark grey and the chestnut regions
the neck were light brown. The bill was a yellowish horn colour,
en in summer when it should be black, and the eyes appeared red when
wed with a bright light directly behind the observer.
For convenience, I shall refer to this bird as dilute, though this may not
scientifically accurate. I am not certain of the origin of these birds
t believe they were taken from the wild.
In 1967 they were kept in a large double breeder cage in my garden
id at Redhill in Surrey. They were given a Budgerigar nestbox, but
de no attempts to use it. Food at this time (April) consisted of a
ked seed mixture up as follows2 parts British Finch mixture, 2 parts
d seeds, 1 part niger. Each bird consumed about ij teaspoons of
3 mixture daily. A good supply of maggots was always available, also
iet apple and coltsfoot.
)n 30th April I transferred the birds to an aviary measuring 12 ft. x
.X7ft. high. The rear wall was timber, covered on the inside with
ic es of heather. The rear ft. of roof was also timber to provide
Iter. The aviary already contained one pair each of the following
cies:--Canary, Bullfinch, Greenfinch, Goldfinch, Siskin and Redpoll.
:hin minutes of their release in the aviary the male House Sparrow
ted chasing his female all over the place in a most excited manner.

Fresh wild seeding plants were given daily as they became available;
for example in June I saw the House Sparrows eating chickweed, sow
thistle and plantain. In spite of frequent chasing by the male no nesting
activity was noticed until 6th June, when an attempt was made to build
a nest high among the heather under the covered roof. There was very
little material to act as foundation, so I fixed a Budgerigar nestbox at this
spot. This suited the birds fine, though not in the way I expected. They
built on top of the box, sandwiching their nest between it and the roof--
a height of two to three inches. One result of this was that the nesting
chamber had a hard wooden floor with no lining over it. The nest was
rapidly constructed from dry grasses and some of the various plants
which were offered to the birds as food, such as long stems of great
plantain. A sparse lining of feathers was subsequently added.
The first egg appeared on 13th June, followed by three others at daily
intervals. Incubation appeared to be by the female alone. On 25th
June I noticed a sudden increase in the rate of maggot consumption, and
assumed the eggs were hatching. On the following day I gingerly felt
in the nest and found three chicks and an egg. This egg did not hatch
and disappeared within the next two days. The Handbook gives ar
incubation period of 12 to 14 days, starting from the completion of the
clutch. In the present case there were certainly young in the nest ic
days after the last egg was laid, and probably as soon as nine days after.
On 1 st July I examined the nestlings. One had a deformed leg witl
the knee joint apparently working the wrong way round, so that the le#
was pointed forwards towards the wing. At the time I wondered whethe:
this might be a consequence of the very shallow nest with its hard woodei
floor. The other two young were ringed with the recommended B.B.B.A
rings, size B3. These would barely go on, although the young wen
probably only five or six days old. Later on the legs became mucl
thicker and the soft fleshy surface bulged out over the rings. Thi
worried me, and I managed to cut the rings off without harm to the birds
A bigger ring would not solve this problem as I had been able withou
difficulty to fit B3 rings on to the legs of both parents when they wen
adults. The House Sparrow is one of those species which exhibit
" puppy fat ", that is the legs of nestlings are thicker than those of adults
Some measurements of a subsequent brood showing this phenomena
are given later in the article. It seems likely that close rings are un
suitable for this species.
All three young appeared to have normally coloured skin with n&amp;gt;
trace of any pale features. They differed from the young of other specie
I was breeding, Greenfinches for example, in showing no traces of fluff
down. They were simply bald and ugly, with a few quills beginnin
to push through.
By 7th July I was able to offer daily supplies of blackfly on stems c
dock and thistle, but I did not notice the Sparrows eating these. The

I re nervous birds, however, and I continued with the blackfly in the
ipe that they were being taken after I left the aviary. On this day I
ind the chick with the deformed leg dead in the nest.
The remaining two young left the nest on 14th July. During the
t of the summer I gave supplies of all manner of wild seeds as these
:ne into season. Both birds were successfully reared, and proved to be
of each sex and normal in colour. Both had slightly deformed toes
each foot. I kept the female to pair back to her father, and released
male.
n 1968 I moved house from Redhill to East Grinstead in Sussex
le three Sparrows were caged in February whilst their aviary was
; mantled. On 21st April they were released into their new aviary
is measured 12 ft. x 9 ft. x 7 ft. high, approximately 3 ft. of the rear
II was boarded from ground to roof and attached to a 3 ft. square
rded section of the roof. The rear of the aviary was heavily planted
fi evergreen shrubs and some elderberry bushes. The aviary con-
ned three Budgerigar nestboxes and a tit nestbox of a type known as
Upton permanent box (see British Trust for Ornithology Field
iide No. 3 " Nestboxes " by Edwin Cohen).
)ther inhabitants of this new aviary were 10 finches of various species
ollared Dove, and a Black-headed Gull with only one wing. There
e a few differences from the previous year in the food available. All
Is were given dry, not soaked. Separate dishes contained British
ti mixture, sunflower, peanuts, wheat, dove and pheasant mixture
wild seed mixture. Soft foods were also offered, again in separate
es. These were soaked puppy biscuit, egg biscuit food and bread
i milk sprinkled with calcium phosphate. As many wild seeding
ts were offered as possible, species varying according to the season,
n 28th April the Upton permanent box contained some dead grass
the adult female Sparrow was seen to visit it. The male House
row was very energetic, often displaying and chasing this, his original,
By 8th May a lot of material had been added to the nest and a
g, mostly of seed fluff, was being added. Three days later I added
ly supply of maggots to the diet.
1 18th May there were five eggs in the box, and the adult female
incubating. During the evening of the 25th I felt in the nest and
ggs were quite cool. I wondered if the hen had deserted, but on the
 |the rate of maggot consumption increased about four times, and on
ollowing morning there were certainly young in the nest. That
ng (30th May) there were four chicks and a clear egg. In spite of
r difficulties I decided to ring these young with smaller than the
amended B 3 rings (inside diameter= 3 mm) this time using the
/m B2, as I knew the B3 ring could be fitted on to adults. By 4th
ie it looked as though there was another puppy fat problem, however,

wire cutters, subsequently pulling them open sufficiently for remov
using two pairs of surgical forceps. I tried fitting the larger B3 ring c
this day, but it would not go on. Next day I put on plastic Budgeng;
split rings for identification. These were coloured green, blue, bla&amp;lt;
and white.
On 7th June I measured the length of web open on the primary feathe
as an indication of their stage of development. I also measured tarsi
thickness to check on the puppy fat problem. The birds ringed blai,
and white left the nest on 12th June, whilst Green and Blue fledged the d;
after. Further tarsus measurements were taken on 18th June, details a
given in Table 1.

There was thus a reduction in tarsus thickness between the probat
ages of 9 and 20 days of up to 0*4 mm. (Tarsus measurements we
made to the nearest 0-05 mm using vernier calipers. Every effort w
made to measure consistently to minimise experimental error). T
results illustrate the puppy fat problem and give some measure of t
difficulties faced when close ringing this species.
On 14th June, the day after the last young fledged, I noticed a drop
the rate of maggot consumption by about 30%; a * *he same time me
bread and milk was being eaten. Two weeks later three of the you
were seen feeding together on freshly gathered chickweed.
The young were all normal in colour.
All the Sparrows were nervous and would hide if they knew I w
around. Sometimes though I could watch their behaviour from t
house (about 80 ft. away) using binoculars. 16th June at about 11 a.
was one such occasion when I watched the male and the breeding fem&amp;lt;
mating. I did not see the start of this sequence, the unusual activ r
prompted me to fetch my binoculars. The female was on a sloping peri
about two feet from the nest box, she was quivering her wings. T
male flew round the aviary several times (clockwise if viewed from abov,
briefly pausing now and then on perches or on top of the nest box.
then quickly mounted the female from behind. During copulation s:
stopped quivering her wings, but the male flapped his vigorously as*
to keep balance. They remained like this for only 2 or 3 seconds, th"
the male flew off for 5 to 10 seconds and returned and repeated the py
formance. This happened eight times in all. The female remain

tionary except once when she moved a couple of inches down the perch
tween matings. The female interrupted the sequence by flying away.
to days later the first egg of the second clutch was laid in the same nest.*
The nest contained two eggs on 20th June (late afternoon) and four

The food given was similar to that of the previous year as far as s&amp;lt;
wild foods and maggots was concerned. However, I decided to ex'
ment with the soft food to see if I could overcome the problem of s
chicks having deformed feet. Instead of separate dishes of soaked pi
biscuit, egg biscuit food, and bread and milk sprinkled with call
phosphate I made up the following mixture:-- i part breadcru;
2 parts puppy biscuit (Saval number i), 2 parts chick crumbs, and 1
Farex. To 1 lb of this mixture I added one teaspoon of calcium phosp
and half a teaspoon of Lusty's Pure Kelp Powder (rich in minerals
made from seaweed). This was moistened with water when supj
fresh daily.
On 10th May there were three eggs in the Upton permanent box
the female seemed to have deserted them. The male no longer sh(
any interest in her, but he was often excited by wild females outsidi
aviary. I decided to add his other daughter, Blue, to this aviary,
also put in a new tit nest box. Next day the male was seen ent&amp;lt;
the new box, and a nest was being built in it on 18th May. By
there were only two eggs in the old box, both cold. I removed these

colour, one was spotted and mottled all over with greys and bro

that year the old male Sparrow also vanished, bringing this experiment
to a close.
I think the main point about the rearing of healthy undeformed
young was that this only occurred when there was a plentiful supply
of both maggots and bread and milk sprinkled with calcium phosphate.
I do not know for certain that these are essential but I would use them
again if trying to breed this species, except that I would probably use a
multi-mineral/vitamin powder such as Vionate in preference to calcium
phosphate.
Finally a few words on the failure to breed coloured or dilute birds
may be of value. One fact which emerges is that this is not a sex-linked
recessive type (as found in cinnamon Canaries for example). If it were
sex-linked the dilute male paired to a normal female would have produced
split dilute males and dilute females; however, all the females were normal
in colour. If a non sex-linked recessive factor was involved all the young
would have been split dilute, i.e. normal in colour, and young from the
father x daughter mating should include both dilutes and split birds of
aormal colour. The two young actually produced from this mating
were both normal in colour, but such a small sample does not rule out the
possibility of a non sex-linked recessive factor.

The small park surrounding the house is walled-in and has a large pond:
Cranes, Flamingos and Waterfowl live there at semi-liberty, as well as a

The following species of Parrots and Parrakeets are represented at
present at Mesuil-Aubry:
Great Palm Cockatoo: A pair, plus a tame male, over 40 years old, which
used to be U. Decoux's pet. Gang-gang Cockatoo: Three pairs in perfect
condition, which have not yet started breeding. Queen of Boavaria's
Conure: Several tame young specimens, recently arrived. Amboina King
Parrot: Also several lately arrived. Australian King Parrot: Regularly
breeding pairs. New Guinean and Australian Crimson Wings , also
regular breeders. Horned Parrakeet: A male of this very rare New
Caledonion species. Lvea Parrakeet: Two males of this rare species,
one of which has produced hybrids with a female Red-fronted Kakanki 1
several pairs of which live and breed there. Rock Peplars: Regularly
breeding. Twenty-eight , Port Lincoln , Cloncurry and Brown&amp;apos;s Parrakeets.
The latter reared a number of young, but Dr. Quinque has some difficulty

are difficult to sex, but on closer scrutiny of this pair the hen has one or two
pale grey primary feathers in the wings, and while the cock is bold the
hen is much less tame. Both birds are mainly chestnut-brown, witfc
black crests, and a long tail the feathers of which have grey and blacl

his was followed by the cock chasing the hen at a terrific speed round the
fiary and in and out of a bamboo clump, and attempting to peck the
oaca of the female. Presumably this preceeds copulation. Cloaca-
icking in babbler courtship has been recorded for other species (Harrison
&amp;gt;67)-
\\ ith regard to diet, all that I can persuade them to feed on are grapes,
it up small, and a continual supply of " nectar " which consists of honey'
omplan, and Farlene Baby Food mixed with water. I have tried the
aial proprietary soft foods but they refuse to touch any. Apart from
sects which they ' hawk " on the wing this is their basic diet. 1971 was
good year for wasps and they really relish these, it is fascinating to see
em hold a wasp down with one foot and remove the sting. Sometimes
ey don't bother and just swallow the wasp whole.
After wintering them in the bird room (which is kept reasonably warm
r electric heating in bad weather) they were put out into a flight in the
cond week of March 1971. The flight was4m. x 2m x 2m x and planting
d planting with a clump of bamboo and some ferns.
They showed no interest in breeding in 1971. As with my Silver-
red Mesias, I overwintered them in the bird room with a pair of Spreo
arlings. On 12th March 1972, when the weather was rather cold, but
rly fine, I put them out in the planted flight again, but this year I fixed
" a trellis in the flight and trained some wild hops to climb it.
In May I obtained some fibre from a Palm tree, the same material that
e Silver-eared Mesia had used (Franklin 1972).
On 30th May the cock was seen to carry some of the fibres about the
*ht. On 10th June I saw him display to the hen with a long strand
Id in his bill, raising his crest and vibrating his wings. This went on
&amp;gt;m time to time until 16th July when I saw both birds commence to build
;h up in the clump of wild hops. By 24th July the nest appeared to
finished. It consisted of an outer layer of fibres, partly bound around
j hops; then a thick layer of fibres interspersed with a number of bamboo
ves and other dead leaves, and within this a deep cup lined with fibre,
was about the size of a Blackbird's nest, Turdus tnetula , but with a
aller and deeper cup.
3 n 25th July I saw the cock chasing the hen at terrific speed, calling
idly and making the peculiar mewing noises. Copulation was not
&amp;gt;erved. On 28th July, when I saw the hen leave the nest, I examined
vith the aid of a mirror and could see one egg, rather like that of a
eenfinch in size and colour.
loth birds shared the incubation, which lasted 14 days, with one young
- hatching on 12th August. The following day another young one
ched out, and because the hen is not so tame I kept out of the flight
fear of upsetting her. From then on it was a case of supplying as
ch live food as possible. This meant going out into the fields every
with a large net to catch flies. Luckily the weather during this period

was rather hot, and this made it easier for me since the parents wen
able to catch plenty of live food in the flight.
I would have preferred to let the birds come out at liberty to collect food
but as I have a Siamese cat I thought the idea might be a little imprudent
On 28th August the two babies came out of the nest, the feather colouring
being the same as that of the adult birds. They roosted apart from eacl
other and unfortunately the weather became a little chilly. They botl
died at two days out of the nest.
The parents appeared to be mating again at about 30th August, bu 1
nothing came of this, and I brought them back into the bird room or

FURTHER OBSERVATIONS ON THE
TOURMALINE SUNANGEL HUMMINGBIRD
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996593" page_id="58078452"  page_num="118" year="" vol="">
By A. J. Mobbs (Walsall, Staffordshire, England)
Since writing the notes on the Tourmaline Sunangel, Heliangelw
exortis , which appeared in Vol. 79 : 79-83 of this magazine. I hav&amp;lt;
learnt from personal observation, that the species will in fact roost or
one foot.
For two weeks I purposely entered my birdroom before the birds ha(
awakened from their night's sleep, and each time I found the Sunange
using the left foot only to grip the perch. It is surprising the bird use:
the left foot during the night period, because as already mentioned in m]
previous notes, the right foot is favoured during the hours of daylight
Since writing my previous notes, I have also had the opportunity t(
examine male H. exortis both in juvenile and post-juvenile plumages
The juvenile plumage resembles that of an adult female except for th&amp;lt;
white patch on the chin and lower throat which in the juvenile male is
smaller and speckled with green. Male's in post-juvenile plumag&amp;lt;
resemble the adults but are shining rather than glittering green on th&amp;lt;
chest. As with the adult male, the chin and upper throat is violet-blu&amp;lt;
and the lower throat is red. However, although these feathers are some-
what iridescent, they are not so brilliant as in the adult bird, nor are the]
as pronounced. In the post-juvenile plumage, there is a faint white lint
running along the bottom edge of the red of the lower throat. The tai
feathers in the post-juvenile male, although longer than that of the juvenil*
bird (and the female), are not so long, nor as deeply forked as in th(
adult bird.

In a recent paper in Avicultural Magazine, Willson and von Neumann
(1972) draw attention to the higher proportion of colourful birds in the
tropics than in the temperate zone, but are unable to suggest any general
hypothesis to explain this phenomenon. A reexamination of their data,
however, shows that the problem can be at least clarified by separating
the colourful birds in the tropics into two groups: those which have
developed colourful plumage for the same reasons as temperate species
(and presumably have the same proportion of colourful forms), and those
which have developed bright colours in response to purely tropical
conditions. Birds in the latter category would be expected to belong to
groups absent in the temperate zone, and the addition of such groups to
the fauna would then account for the increase in the proportion of
brightly-plumaged birds in the tropics.
That such a division does occur (as opposed for any general tendency
or b^ds to be more colourful in the tropics) is indicated by a consideration
)f groups with wide latitudinal ranges. The following table, drawn from
.he appendix to Willson and von Neumann's paper, compares the propor-
:ions of colourful birds in families having representation of 10 spp. or
nore each in temperate North America and in South America.

t is apparent from the above that in most families there is no tendency

&quot;he exceptions are the Corvidae, Parulidae and Icteridae. The higher

19 species) whose members, although many have yellow underparts or
well-marked crown patches (6 spp. at tropical elevations) and are therefore
colourful by Willson and von Neumann's standards, strike the observer as
much less brilliant than most North American species (data from Meyer
de Schauensee 1970, which excludes Central American species).
The highest proportions of colourful species in the New World tropics,
as listed by Willson and von Neumann, are found in the Psittacidae (100%),
Trogonidae (100%), Momotidae (100%), Galbulidae (100%), Capitonidae
(100%), Ramphastidae (100%), Parulidae (78%--but see above),
Coerebidae (74%), Bucconidae (67%), Corvidae (64%), Thraupidae
(64%), Trochilidae (63%), Icteridae (63%), Pipridae (51%), and
Cotingidae (28%) (ignoring the Cathartidae). Most of these families have
poor representation or are absent in temperate North America. More
important, they represent ecological types largely confined to the tropics.
Most are obligate or almost obligate frugivores (e.g. Psittacidae, Trog-
onidae, Capitonidae, Ramphastidae, Pipridae, some Cotingidae, Thrau-
pidae, some Icteridae (e.g. Icterus )) or nectarivores (e.g. Trochilidae,
Coerebidae) (Haverschmidt 1968, Thomson 1964). These feeding types
are rare in temperate latitudes, presumably because the stronger seasonality
restricts the availability of fruit and nectar during much of the year.
A similar correlation between diet and plumage holds in the Old World,
where many of the brilliantly coloured species are frugivorous (e.g.
Psittacidae, Musophagidae, Trogonidae, Capitonidae, Paradisaeidae) or
nectarivorous (e.g. Psittacidae (Lories), Dicaeidae, Nectariniidae) (Thom-
son 1964, Gilliard 1969). Contrasted with this is the failure of the large
families of insectivorous birds in the tropics (e.g. the Dendrocolaptidae,
Furnariidae, Formicariidae and Tyrannidae in the New World, and the
Sylviinae and Timaliine complexes in the Old) to produce more than a few
colourful species. As a further indication that frugivory and bright or
striking plumage tend to be correlated, in the Cotingidae and the closely
related Pipridae those genera with bright colours or ornamental plumage
(e.g. PhoenicercuSy Cotinga } Xipholena } Iodopleura y Haematoderus, Querula y
PerissocephaluSy Gymnodoerdy ProcniaSy Rupicoldy Pipra , Xenopipo ,
Chiroxiphidy Mdndcus) are obligate or primarily frugivores, while those
with more dully-coloured plumage (e.g. Attild, Ldniocerdy Rhytipterna ,
LipduguSy PdchyrdtnphuSy Pldtypsdris , TyrdnneuteSy Schiffornis , Neopelma)
are largely insectivorous (Slud 1964, Haverschmidt 1968). Similar cases
exist in the Old World, where the fruit-eating pigeons of the genus
Ptilinopus are the most colourful in the family, and in the Drepaniidae of
the Hawaiian Islands, in which the largely nectarivorous genera Drepdnis ,
CiridopSy Pdimer id y Vestidrid and Himdtione are generally more colourful
than the insectivorous or granivorous genera Loxops, Psittirostrdy Pseudo-
nestor and Hemigndthus (the exceptions being the black Drepdnis funerea
and the red Loxops mdculdtd fldmmed and L. c. coccined respectively).

There are several possible reasons why frugivorous and nectarivorous
birds are likely to be brightly coloured. Firstly, food items for such birds
are more likely to be concentrated in circumscribed areas--i.e. single
fruiting or flowering trees--than is the case for insectivorous or granivorous
species. This tends to bring the birds into close physical proximity during
feeding, and may as a result increase aggressive encounters. Humming-
birds, for instance, are highly aggressive, as are the nectarivorous Drepaniids
in Hawaii. The Iiwi (Vestiaria coccinea ), the most brilliantly coloured of
the latter family, is also one of the most pugnacious (personal observation).
Frugivores are apparently less overtly aggressive than nectarivores. The
presence of bright colours in both groups, however, may provide more
striking aggressive signalling patterns and as a result contribute to the
spacing of individuals at feeding sites. Secondly, the utilisation of a food
source, such as fruit or nectar, that can be gathered with a minimum
amount of search may free the male from the necessity of assisting the
female in parental care, and as a result promote the development of
polygamous mating systems in which the male mates with a wide variety
of females instead of forming a pair-bond. In such birds the male
normally develops brilliant colours and/or ornamental plumage for use in
display. The first factor mentioned above may be more important in
those forms in which both sexes are brightly coloured (e.g. Ptilinopus
doves, Psittacidae, Capitonidae, Drepaniidae, many Thraupidae); the
second applies to such groups as Paradisaeidae, Pipridae and Rupicola.
The two factors are not necessarily mutually exclusive; many humming-
birds have polygamous mating systems and are highly aggressive at feeding
sites. (R)
In addition it should be pointed out that many of the birds considered
are birds of edge and forest canopy (presumably as a result of the dis-
tribution of their food sources), and that bright colouration may render
birds most inconspicuous against the brilliant greens of tropical rainforest
foliage. Again, this is not a contradiction of the above-stated explanations;
a bird which might be inconspicuous to an aerial predator, viewing it from
above, may be quite the opposite to a conspecific at its own level in the
canopy. As an example, in many of the Ptilinopus doves the back is
bright green while the head and underside carry distinctive markings in
Dther colours. Thus these birds would present a completely different
aspect when viewed from below or on the same level--as a conspecific
night see them than they would viewed from above against a green
Dackground.
The evidence, as reviewed above, is thus against any general tendency
or birds to be more colourful in the tropics than in temperate latitudes,
t seems probable that the primary reason for the larger number of
colourful birds in the tropics is the addition to the avifauna of nectar-
md fruit-eating groups not found in the temperate zone. Admittedly
&amp;gt;ther special factors may be present in the tropics; for instance, the

Momotidae, Galbulidae and Bucconidae are not frugivorous but do
represent feeding types absent in higher latitudes. Probably there are a
wide variety of reasons for the evolution of bright plumage, but for many
groups the explanations will be equally applicable in the temperate zone.

NESTING OF THE KEA, NESTOR NOTABILIS ,
AT JERSEY ZOO
By Margaret Mallet (Bird Section, Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust)

The Kea, Nestor notabilis is found in the South Island mountain areas
of New Zealand, with a more extensive range than in the latter half of the
last century, in spite of the massive toll taken by sheep farmers. They
nest on the edge of the high level forests and obtain food from the forests
clothing the mountain valleys, ranging widely to the alpine grasslands for
Autumn fruits. During wintertime their natural curiosity and lack of
food brings them further down the mountains to human habitation levels,
where they tend to annoy the local population by their destructive habits,
which include pulling tiles off roofs, chewing window frames and even
entering houses and helping themselves to objects which take their fancy.
This provides entertainment for the tourists, but they too can suffer
the disadvantages of these birds' curiosity and boldness, since they are
not averse to hopping into cars and creating the same sort of havoc that
they do in houses.
In May 1963, a pair of keas was presented to the Jersey Zoo by the
New Zealand government and a second female arrived the following
August. All three were housed in an aviary, the dimensions of which are
approximately 30 ft. x 12 ft. x 9 ft. high with a shelter provided at the

;ar, under which are two large barrels, about four feet from the ground;
te birds use these to sleep on but very seldom go inside them. In the
mtre of the aviary is a large mound of granite rocks and logs and
edged amongst these is a metal container for bathing and drinking.
mple perching is provided and fresh branches are given daily_Willow
iing the most acceptable. The area under the shelter is sanded and the
mainder of the aviary is grass.
Their diet consists of sunflower seeds, peanuts, omniverous nuts
irdboiled egg (of which only the yolk is eaten) and any fruits and vegetables
season. Added to this are the staple, oranges, apples, bananas, plus
ites, fresh coconut, figs, melon, chicory and lettuce. They also eat
dney, but are more enthusiastic about it during the breeding season,
id brown bread soaked in a nectar mixture is always the first item to be
ten. Their lettuce is usually taken straight to their water container and
dunked " several times before it is consumed, but I have not seen them
/e the same treatment to any other item of food except for their carrot,
le young keas on the other hand, spent a great deal of time around their
iter bowl and a large amount of their food was to be found at the bottom
it each morning.
In December 1965, a wooden " T " shaped nest-box was installed, but
hough it was thoroughly inspected at the time, no great interest was
own in it until the beginning of January 1966, when the male and female
?an spending a large part of their time in it. The second female was
^ays driven away if she attempted to enter, and if she succeeded, was
omptly chased out again after a brief bout of squabbling, but once clear
the tunnel entrance, was left to her own devices and at no time was she
Hied by them. Eventually, she was seen to spend most of her time at
: front of the aviary although they all fed from the same dish. However,
the end of February, it was obvious that no serious attempt at nesting
s to be made that year, and by the end of the month all three were
icable again.
n the years 1967, 1968, 1969, 1970, 1971 and 1972, four, five, four,
en, seven and seven eggs were laid respectively, the majority of which
&amp;apos;e fertile. Several of these disappeared during the latter part of in-
\0x25A0ation and we had strong reason to suspect that the male was responsible
this, since whenever he went to feed the female, a good deal of squab-
lg was heard before she chased him out of the box, although he was
er actually seen to take an egg. In order to cut down the losses as much
ossible, each egg was removed as it was laid and replaced with one from
intam and put back a few days before they were due to hatch. Some
:ks were hatched during these years, but none survived for more than
lours, and an unsuccessful attempt was made to hand-rear one in 1970.
he second female did not appear to be a disturbing influence on the
durmg the breeding season, but nevertheless, it was decided to remove
to a small cage some distance away, and to make another one for the

male kea which was built at the back of their aviary. So at the beginning
of the 1972 season, the odd female was taken out, and when the clutch oi
seven eggs was completed, the male was shut into his quarters where he
could still have contact with the female and eventually the young.
Unfortunately, during the time the pair were together, to ensure fertili-
sation one egg disappeared and one was found damaged at the entrance ol
the nesting area, leaving a clutch of five.
An interesting point is that a kea clutch in all accounts, only consists
of four eggs, maximum, yet on three occasions our female has laid sever
eggs and once five. On several occasions she has laid one or two eggs
and then stopped for a period of about a week before starting again anc
laying every two or three days. This has inevitably meant a long gap
between the laying of the first and last eggs, another reason for taking
them away and putting them back once she has started to sit. Therefore
the first eggs were sometimes placed under pigeons and it was a chid
from one of these fostered eggs that we attempted to hand-rear.
In 1972, incubation commenced on the 16th February and on the ntH
March, the first chick had hatched, Nos. two, three and four hatching or
the 12th and 14th. The fifth chick was unfortunately dead in shell. Or
hatching, the chicks are covered in white down, with large sack-lik&amp;lt;
structures at outer edges of their beaks, giving them a rather grotesqu*
appearance.
Beaks, legs and areas of skin around the eyes are pale pink for th&amp;lt;
first few days, gradually changing to a greyish green, and eventually
turning to a clear yellow at the age of about eight weeks, except for th&amp;lt;
beaks and legs which turned black. This colour is retained for at leas
two years, and probably until they approach maturity at four to five years
The chicks were checked daily and at all times had full crops anc
stomachs, the first food to be seen in their crops being carrot. Our Kea;
and also those at Zurich, are very partial to chicory and during the rearing
of their chicks were given three a day. It is customary for the male ke;
to feed the female while she has young, but since our male could not d(
this by going to the nest box, he used to feed her through the wire of hii
cage, whereupon, she would go straight back and feed the chicks. Thre&amp;lt;
feeds a day were given at this period, one of which was placed in th&amp;lt;
tunnel to the nesting area.
On 17th March one dead chick was found in the tunnel and we had 2
few anxious days wondering if they were suffering from some contagiou;
disease, but the remaining young continued to grow rapidly and on th&amp;lt;
5th April, the first pin featheres could be seen along the edges of theii
wings. By the second week in May they were fully feathered and althougl
they would venture along the tunnel, they were not seen in the avian
until the 26th May, but since they seemed very timid it is probable they
had been out at night-time before that date; once they realised they wer&amp;lt;
being observed, they would dash back to the safety of their nest-box

LS they became more confident and spent longer periods outside, it was
asier to note their behaviour and they and their father appeared to take
reat interest in each other, but he was not seen to feed them until several
reeks later.
The male kea was released from his cage on 15th June and rapidly
ettled into family life, although for the first three days he was put into
is quarters at night. No antagonism was observed from him towards
le young ones, but neither did he appear to take any great interest in
lem , it is possible that the female could have been partly responsible for
lis since she was the dominant party at this period and would not tolerate
im anywhere near her, and it was with her that the young spent a great
mount of their time.
The timidity they displayed at their debut, rapidly diminished, and
\y the beginning of July, one in particular had become most confident
id friendly, this specimen was heavier in build than the other two, with a
!nger curved beak and his sex was tentatively determined as a male. He
;adily took food and play objects from my hand, and took great delight in
ropping my rubber gloves in the water container until, at the risk of
Tending him I decided to terminate this practice, but he still derived
eat pleasure from trying to pull them off my hands. He also enjoyed
aying with my clothes, tugging at a leather belt, boots and most of all
nptying the rubbish bucket by tossing everything out with his beak,
he other two would watch these activities with great interest, occasionally
tempting to wrest a plaything from him, but since he was the dominant
le, they usually had to wait until he lost interest in it, and even the
&amp;gt;jects they took from my hand, he quickly commandeered. Robert
eller observed the behaviour of this group of Keas during the latter
irt of June, and it is due to him, I am sure, that the young keas and I
*rived so much pleasure from each other's company, since he advised
at spending as much time with them as possible could be nothing but
ivantageous to all of us.
On the 25th October one pair of the young keas was sent to Paignton
&amp;gt;0, a nd later the single female to Chief Officer of the Parks Department
In the current year (1973) they are again nesting sucessfully, with three
ung hatched. This time the male has been permitted to remain with
e. chicks since hatching and his behaviour has been exemplary. We
lieve this is due to a second nest-box having been installed and his
ving somewhere to go during incubation apart from the nesting area.

S. T. Johnstone (Stroud, Glos., England)
At Slimbridge, the Wildfowl Trust has its major collection of waterfow
screamers and flamingos. This concourse of birds is the largest an
most comprehensive collection of one group of animals in the world an
its has been my privilege, over the last twenty-six years to collect thei
together and to create their environment.
I came to Slimbridge with a medical training and a knowledge c
architecture and building construction. My acquaintance with waterfov
was to say the least, limited. But I was fortunate in having as my bos:
Sir Peter Scott, whose enthuiastic support and encouragement has mad
the project so worth-while. Furthermore I was lucky in the early da)
to be under the tutelage of that great and unassuming aviculturist, Joh
Yealland.
Apart from the passerines in the Tropical House, there have been ov(
this period 197 forms represented of which 163 produced eggs and 15
kinds have been reared. It is difficult to be sure of first records, but it
believed that 14 of these were reared for the first time in captivity an
27 in Britain. One of the attractions of New Grounds is the winterin
flocks of wild swans, geese and ducks and ample facilities are given to 01
members for viewing these birds at close quarters, and without too muc
difficulty. There are six towers of varying heights, some fitted wit
powerful binoculars, numerous hides, and a very comfortable observatio
room, adjoining the hostel, where one can view the winter population c
Bewick's Swans, together with numerous Pintail, Wigeon and Shoveler.
For many years the collection was kept in an area of some thirty-fh
acres and this posed particular problems regarding the segregation of tl
more aggressive species and finding fresh grazing annually for rearir
the young birds. However, in 1972, we were able to expand and tl
new development has made it possible to fox-proof 100 acres. It w;
intended that the extension should include a Nene park, swan pen
Mallard aviaries, and further heated quarters. There would also 1
additional grazing for flocks of fifty or more geese of individual specie
An eleven acre field has also been fenced close to the propagation cent]
for rearing purposes. An additional water supply was planned to 1
supplied by means of Well Points.
For the collection the amenities are many. There are four serit,
of aviaries and perhaps the most interesting are those adjoining tl
propagation building, which are built on the principle of the tent pol
Steel hawsers, tensioned by means of bottle screws, rise upwards ar

md a winter-house with infra-red heat and a tapped water supply.
The Guinness Aviary is eighty yards long and is constructed of semi-
circular frames of tubular steel with a radius of twelve feet. Each section
las an external pond with flowing water and a heated house with separate
vater supply. This structure was presented to the Trust some fifteen
ears ago by the famous Dublin Brewery. Since that time among the
arer birds to breed therein were Spotted Whistling Duck, New Zealand
Irown Duck, Hartlaub's Duck and White-winged Wood Duck.
The other two rows of aviaries are of the conventional type with flat
oofs and wooden frames. Both have external and internal water-ways
vith flowing water and infra-red heat. They are used principally for
earing full-winged birds and for wintering the more delicate birds in the
ollection.
The Propagation Centre has recently been rebuilt through the generosity
n an anonymous benefactor. The building contains food silos, rooms
)r milling food, food preparation, insect propagation, incubation, surgery
nd X-ray. There is on the first floor a large work shop and store room
igether with a staff recreation room. Half the ground floor is devoted
) an indoor rearing unit. Here there are some forty raised pens, each
irtually one yard square with plastic and wire-netting floors and roofs,
he partitions are removable and are wooden. The pens can therefore be
tered in size to suit the number and size of the young birds. Each is
ipplied with an infra-red lamp adjustable for height, and a plastic mat
le latter being from the hygenic point of view far more easy to clean
ian sacking. The floor of the unit is in rendered cement and is washed
)wn daily. Originally intended for the more delicate species without foster
others, it has been found that the installation is extremely useful for all
&amp;gt;ecies, particularly when weather conditions are bad.
In the early days, in fact for the first seven or eight years, there was no
ectricity at New Grounds and the natural flow of water was very, very
3 W. At this time the young were reared on an ' S ' bend of water
ading into the top pond of the Rushy Pen. However, with the arrival
power, I constructed a prototype duckery with a water course where the
iter flowed over a step from pen to pen. There were three rows of
ns, but the last pen in each row had water from all the others in the row.
11s was hardly the basis of good hygiene. In consequence a further
ickery was built. Here water, pumped up from water bearing sand
ft. below the surface, is fed into a raised header channel to three rows
pens. From the header channels water is fed into a shallow, wide,
ment-lined ditch to each of the pens. In one row the ditch is widened
t to deeper ponds for the diving ducklings. The water leaves the pens
means of waste drain, whence it flows into a disused rhine. The pens

annually. The water supply to each pen is controlled by a wooden tank
and the 3500 gallons per hour supply is found to be adequate for this
purpose. There is a power supply available to each pen. Weathei
conditions permitting and provided the downies are feeding satisfactorily
they are moved from the internal to the external duckery about the fifth
day where they are installed in one of the rather sophisticated brooders
that I first built some fifteen years ago and which have been gradually
modified as experience with their use has proved necessary. Th&amp;lt;
alterations have been principally in the reduction of length from six tc
four ft. and in making the handles detachable for the purposes of easie:
handling and storage. Swans, geese and ducks, with or without a bantam
are reared with equal facility in this type of brooder.

Other facilities for the captive birds include a recently constructed
ea-duck pool. This consists of three ponds at different levels and
onnected by rocky cascades. The highest is at eye-level, the middle at
/aist, and the lowest at ground-level. The middle pond is retained by a

S. T. JOHNSTONE--NOTES FROM SLIMBRIDGE
Apart from the conservation story of the Hawaiian Geese, which must
by now be well known in avicultural circles, the Trust has embarked on
a similar project with the White-winged Wood Duck {Caivina scutulata )
regarded as a much endangered species. There were at Slimbridge
several pairs of these birds some fifteen years ago and they lived foi
several years but never showed signs of breeding.
In 1970, with the aid of the World Wildlife Fund, two consignments
of birds were caught in Assam and sent to Slimbridge. These were
paired and put into the larger sections of the aviaries; some pinioned and
some left full-winged. Nesting-sites in the form of kennels and open-
topped boxes were placed 10 ft. high, 2 ft. high and on the ground
4 alternatives being offered to each pair, though the highest site was
omitted in the case of the pinioned birds. In each case a kennel was placet
on a log in the winter shelter. Of the 3 clutches laid in 1971 and 197;
two were by a full-winged pair and one by a pinioned pair. The lattei
and one of the former were in the kennel in the winter quarters. Th&amp;lt;
other of the flighted pair was high up in a willow. The clutches wer&amp;lt;
large, 12 to 14, and the eggs similar in size and shape to that of the Muscovy
Duck though they were somewhat darker in colour. The incubatioi
period would seem to be between 32 and 34 days. I issued an edict tha
the birds were not to be disturbed and the nest not examined until th&amp;lt;
parent appeared on her pond with the brood. Incubation period ant
clutch number could wait until the birds were more firmly established
The hatches were successful and in due course the broods appeared 01
their ponds. It was found that the males spent their time ' dunking
the ducklings and to prevent any drowning they were removed to
separate aviary and not returned to their females until the young wer
fully feathered and had left their mother. Some twenty birds have bee
reared in the last two seasons. The downies were patterned and coloure
like young Mallard, being brown and yellow, a characteristic feature W2
noted in the way the post orbital stripe turned up at an angle to join th
dark cap. Like all cairinini the tarsus was duo-coloured in this case brow
and yellow. The juvenile plumage was dark brown where the adult ws
black.

I know that most sincere aviculturists, in spite of what many con-
jrvatiomsts say, are really very concerned about the state of wild
emulations. People keep birds privately because they love them not
ecause they want to exploit them.
*f course there are the exceptions-every trade, profession and calling
as its black sheep--but notwithstanding this, I feel certain that what
locks me as a conservationist and aviculturist will also shock oo% of mv

It is entitled Animal Exportation From Thailand In 1962-71, it runs to

' ,, arl . U y P0rt y it and horri fying publication which demands to be read
&amp;apos; all who love Oriental wildlife. It does not set out specifically to shock

Wild animals make up one of the natural resources of the country which
are of value to the economy, education and recreation of the people.
In the past, Thailand has received millions of Baht income from the
exportation of wild animals alone. Many species are in demand and
herefore commercial business dealing with wild animals seems to be

In 1967 the Royal Forestry Department set up a Wild Animal Inspectioj
Office at the airport, and so data since then has been much more detailed
For the earlier period (1962-6), data was gathered from the records of th
Department of Foreign Trade, and is so peripheral that we can almos
ignore it. Perhaps the most interesting facts to emerge for that perioi
with regard to birds are that 549 Roulroul Partridges (Rollulus roulroul
were exported with the peak being 192 in 1963 *,336 Great Argus Pheasant
(Argusianus argus) were exported, the peak being 126 in 1964, sine
protection in 1966 their export has been banned. Of the other pheasants
424 were exported; so were 437 hornbills--of which over half wer
members of the Great Hornbill species (Buceros bicornis).
These figures do little to prepare one for what is in store, for no mentio
is made of the more popular species. Incidentally, in the same perioc
as many as 45,799 monkeys (Macaca spp.) were likewise dispatched.
In the table I have listed each species or group of which more tha
100 were exported in the five years from 1967-71 together with a fe 1
especially interesting types of less than that number.

lumber of nearly 196,000 or 538 every single day were exported, making
1 grand total of over 417,000 for the five years at an average of 83,446 every

s, perhaps predictably, the popular so-called Talking Mynah--of which
,n average over 40,000 are exported each year, with a record number of

There are no figures available yet for 1972, but I see no reason to

Parrots of the Psittacula genus (these include the Alexandrine Parakeet
P. eupatria ), Blossom-headed Parakeet ( P . cyanocephala rosa) and the
irey-headed Parakeet (P. himalayana finschii )) have also been subjected
) increased export trafficking: from little over 1,500 in 1967, the figure
as rocketed to one approaching 80,000 for the year 1971 (which is
early 20,000 more than the sum of the preceding four years).
Munias, even excluding the Chestnut Munia, have been exported over
le period at an evarage of nearly 22,000 p.a., with well over half (56,259)

most equals that figure on its own with on average a steady 19 J thousand
aving Thailand each year.
Other figures which struck me as being particularly disturbing were
Lose for the Scarlet-backed Flowerpecker and birds of prey--of which
ambers in excess of 13,500 and 3&amp;gt;**o respectively were exported in 1971.
he numbers of owls to leave Thailand increased from a mere twenty-one
1967 to 1,368 in 1971. 15,685 doves and pigeons were exported in the
:riod, together with no mean totals of 782 kingfishers, 1,326 hornbills,
819 woodpeckers, 1,750 barbets, 1,756 pittas and no fewer than 6,368
dry Bluebirds were similarly sent out.
Apart from the birds I have listed in the table, the report also covers
any other species which appear to be less prone to exploitation and are
ported in more reasonable numbers. By and large the current progress
this " boom business " is easily deduced from the 1969-71 figures.
/er those three years, an average of 210,248 birds were exported legally
&amp;gt;m the Don Muang Airport each year.
Figures such as these must concern even the most hardened aviculturist.
early we have a lot of work to do if aviculture (the foreign-bird branch)
to remain a respectable occupation. It is my personal opinion that
ire has got to be changes, and many foreign-bird enthusiasts are going
have to try a lot harder to breed their own stock replacements--for
it is surely our responsibility. We cannot continue to be consumers

Excalfactoria chinensis
By C. J. O. Harrison (Berkhamsted, Herts., England)
About a year ago I had the opportunity to keep Painted Quail
Excalfactoria chinensis , again and to make further observations on thei
behaviour at close quarters. These have added a few interesting facts t&amp;lt;
those already recorded (Harrison 1965, 1968; Harrison, Restall an&amp;lt;
Trollope 1968).
A pair of quail was given to me for observation by Mr. J. Dowling
The female had developed an odd affliction which caused her constant!
to fall over. I lacked accommodation for birds at the time and therefor
kept the quail in the room where I was working, converting a shallow
cardboard box about 3 ft. X 2 ft. X 1 ft. high by covering the open top witl
gauze panels and inserting a long glass panel into the side of the bos
This makeshift cage rested on a bench just below a large window.
The female's trouble appeared to be due to some injury which ha&amp;lt;
impaired her sense of balance so that whenever she turned her head t
the left or looked around sharply, she fell backwards. Apart from thi
she appeared normal. In an attempt to help, and to watch her progress
I made an imitation thicket with thin, upright strips of stiff card projectin;
an inch or two apart from a solid base. With these to support her whe:
she staggered, the female moved around with reasonable agility. Unfortu
nately she succeeded in wedging herself in the water-pot during a fal
and in my absence drowned herself. The male commenced the usui
calling that occurs in isolation or when the female is not visible; and a
soon as possible I provided him with another mate.
The Crouching Walk
Although I had not seen evidence of a furtive way of walking in thes
or other Painted Quail in indoor situations or when they were on the floe
of a shed, the relatively shallow and open-topped box near a large windo 1
apparently created an artificial " open space " situation. The birds, whe

C. J. O. HARRISON--NOTES ON THE BEHAVIOUR OF PAINTED QUAIL 137
loving across the box, would use a crouching posture appropriate to such
situation. The birds moved slowly, with the legs flexed so that the
ody feathers were almost touching the ground. The body was
orizontal and the head held low, the top of it in line with the back,
he movement was smooth, lacking the more jerky, head-nodding motion
f the normal walk. This smooth movement is the one referred to prev-
\0x25BAusly (Harrison 1965) which, seen from above, gives the impression
lat the bird is gliding along on wheels rather than legs. When almost
&amp;gt; the further side of the box the bird would abandon this slow movement
&amp;gt;r a sudden rush to the " cover " of the wall.
A bird suddenly introduced into a box or bare space of this kind may
iow a similar stance, but half-squatting, with the legs flexed, but the
ody more upright and the head raised. In this posture it may move
-ound in abrupt, short rushes and, until it relaxes, gives the impression
lat it has sustained some kind of injury.
Alarm Call?
In addition to this fear of open space the quail also showed constant
srvous awareness of the passage of larger birds, such as rooks and jack-
aws, outside the window. The rapid ticking or reeling call which I had
reviously suspected to be an avian predator alarm was sometimes heard
1 such circumstances. This call, which was usually followed by a short
iriod of complete silence and motionlessness, also occurred occasionally
1 response to some external sound, such as the sudden shrieking alarm of
blackbird outside the building, although no cause for fear was visible,
.owever, on one or two occasions a sudden bout of this reeling was followed
f the male dashing in circles round the female with plumage fluffed and
ings drooping in display, suggesting that the call may have a broader
inction than is at first apparent.

Roosting

<bodyText confidence="0.999686846153846" page_id="58078473"  page_num="137" year="" vol="">
In order to give the birds a greater sense of security I added a number
grass tufts at one end of the box. The most immediately noticeable
Feet was on their roosting behaviour. The pair roost side by side with
e hinder ends of their bodies pressed together so that the head ends
verge slightly, or side by side facing in opposite directions, sometimes
essed together so tightly that they appear like one ball of feathers,
itherto they had normally roosted towards one corner of the box but in
e open. When the added turves provided cover in this area they used
e cover almost continuously during the day, but at night they moved to
e bare half of the box where they still roosted in the open space.
The Throat Pattern as a Signal
The grass tufts, with earth still on the roots, had been arranged so that
ey provided a fairly level roof of drooping blades about 5 ins. above the

ground and left small tunnels between the bases of the tufts. The bird
quickly utilised these and after thorough exploration both birds, bi
particularly the female, spent much of the time squatting in small hollow
which also gave a wide view of the box. When the birds were using th
grass tuft area one aspect of the plumage became more apparent. Th
throat of the female is unpatterned and pale, but the male has a bol
black and white pattern restricted to the throat and lores. When th
birds were creeping through the grass tunnels they would raise their heac
at intervals, pushing them up through the grass-blades and looking arounc
In this posture the bill was tilted upwards and what showed most cor
spicuously above the grass was the throat area which, when the remainde
of the bird was concealed, provided as immediate signal indicating bot
the species and sex of the bird. It may be that the bold pattern restricte
to the face and throat is related in this species and perhaps in othe
gamebirds, to this aspect of visibility in a grassland habitat.
Nest-Calling
The second female I put with the male was a young one beginning
moult and it was a month or two before she showed any tendency to nes&amp;apos;
During the greater part of this period the male performing intermitter
bouts of nest-calling (or " cornering " as it is sometimes called in behavioi]
studies). In performing nest-calling the male would squat in a corner c
hollow, facing outwards, with the breast lowered and the tail end sometime
raised in the air. Various scraping and scuffling sounds could be hear
but it was not possible to see what foot-movements occurred.
This posture was accompanied by a low-pitched, subdued and mournfi
note constantly repeated. It sometimes appeared to be a monosyllabi
" quoor, quoor, quoor " repeated an indefinite number of times, but 0
other occasions was a disyllabic " quoror, quoror, quoror ". Since th
birds were with me in a rather small room every sound was audible, but
week or two elapsed before I realised that a series of sounds which occurre
while the male was uttering the mournful note did not, in fact, emanat
from the female but were made by the male concurrent with the other cal
This second series of notes was a subdued twittering, much higher i
pitch than the long-drawn plaintive notes and slightly harsh in tom
It appeared wholly independent on the other call but careful listenin
revealed that there was at times a similar cadence in the two. There ar
records of several sounds being uttered simultaneously during song in
number of bird species, but this performance by the Painted Quail woul
seem to be exceptional even in this context.
The female took little or no notice of the male's behaviour, but one
when she walked towards him while he was calling, and several times whe
she appeared to come on him suddenly by accident, I saw him flatten him
self on the ground, half-spreading his wings and turning his head sideway
towards the female so that the throat pattern was visible from abov

ccompanying this by a soft, rapidly-repeated " wit-wit-wit-wit " call,
his posture was described before (Harrison 1965) as an apparently more
xtreme form of tidbitting.
Nest Building
When the grass tufts had been put into the box the male usually called
-om a hollow among them, although he sometimes chose a useless site
uch as the narrow crown of a tuft where any egg would immediately have
Dlled away. Before the grass had been put in he used corners of the box,
r the very slight overhang when the loose paper forming the floor of the
ox lay up against the side and drooped over at its upper edge creating a
ollow with slight shelter above.
After a bout of calling the male would often stand on the site stretching
pright and looking upwards, or pecking at the side wall, as though he expected
1 find something there. This first occurred during late winter when long
rass was not available and so I took a strip of paper 7-8 inches wide and
it it deeply along one edge to produce a tall fringe of upstanding, grass
lade-like strips. When I placed this on edge and partly surrounding one
his sites with it, he called there and then began reaching up and grasping
tese false grassblades at or near the tip, pulling them down towards him
id then releasing them. Very shortly a number were drooping inwards
fer the site and it is obvious that in a wild state this behaviour would
suit in growing herbage arching over the nest-site and concealing it from
*ove.
Little other evidence of nest-building was seen until the female laid her
st egg when, about an hour before the event, she squatted in a hollow in
e grass and began frenziedly sideways-throwing, seizing small pieces of
ass or debris and with a quick sideways flick of the head throwing them
\0x25A0ck to one side of her or the other. She did not lay consistently, and
e male started eating the eggs, destroying them within minutes of their
ing laid. On the few occasions that I was able to make observations eggs
ire laid between 15.30 and 16.00 hrs.
Care of Young by Male
The behaviour of this male spoilt any hopes of observing a full nesting
cle, but in recent observation on adults with small chicks, belonging to
ter aviculturists, I was interested to observe that the attention which
i male devotes towards the female and brood includes the brooding of
- young chicks, with plumage fluffed in similar fashion to the female's.

(Ketupa zeylonensis)
By C. J. O. Harrison (Berkhamsted, Herts., England)
At the London Zoo at dusk on 16th June 1973 I was able to observ
the calling behaviour of an apparent pair of Brown Fish-Owls, Ketup
zeylonensis. The two birds were perched side by side, facing me; ant
when first observed the presumed male had partly turned towards the othe
bird. The feathers of its throat were puffed out and formed a larg
rounded white mass immediately below the bill, the tips of the ruffle
feathers projecting a little further than the bill. Normally this whit
area shows as a thin, inconspicous whitish band across the throat, streake
with darker colour.
In addition to inflating the throat the bird had also brought the " eai
tufts " into display. In this species these elongated tufts of feather
normally lie flat over the eyes, the tips projecting laterally. They ha
not been raised like those of other owl species, but appeared to hav
been ruffled and brought forwards so that they formed prominent shagg
brows projecting above the eyes.
In this posture the bird uttered a very deep and surprisingly soi
" hu-hu ", the first syllable a little more emphatic than the seconc
The presumed female immediately responded by inflating her throa
a large white patch appearing where none had been apparent previously
and uttered a trisyllabic call " hu-hu-hu ", with the first note also slightl
stressed and the other two following at shorter intervals than in the ca
of the first bird. When the call was complete the throat deflated and th
white patch disappeared; but the other bird retained the inflated thro;
when silent.
The calling was repeated a number of times with the same ceremony
The two calls followed each other in such a consistent succession that t
anyone not witnessing the performence it might have sounded like
five-note call from a single bird. The most striking feature was th
quietness of the call-notes. From references in literature it would appe;
that they carry well, but heard at close quarters it seemed improbable th;
they would carry further than some 50 metres.
The species shows similarities to the typical Eagle Owls. A whit
throat patch, inflated when calling, is also present in owls of the geni
Bubo; and Philip Wayre (pers. comm.) has noted sexual dimorphism in th
call-notes of the Great Eagle Owl, Bubo bubo , the male having a inonc
syllabic call and that of the female being disyllabic.
References in literature to the call of the Brown Fish-Owl var
Whistler (1941) refers to " a deep triple hu-who-hu ". Salim Ali an
Ripley (1969) seem aware of both calls, describing " a deep hollow-soundir

According to The New Scientist , Professor Jewell of London University
put forward at a recent meeting the theory that the key feature of domesti&amp;lt;
animals (presumably including domestic birds) is that they have lost th&amp;lt;
ability to respond to adverse conditions that would suppress breeding ir
the wild progenitors. Selection under domestic conditions will hav&amp;lt;
favoured those individuals which will breed in spite of everything
While this may seem satisfactory to the average aviculturist it could hav&amp;lt;

Peter Olney writes . . . " the Blue-backed Manakins at the London Zo&amp;lt;
which reared a young male in 1972, reported in the magazine earlier thi
year, have unfortunately not repeated their success this year. One egj
was laid in late April on the bare top of the heating pipe grill and, no
surprisingly, was later found to be cooked. Then, in the middle of June
two partially-fledged young were picked up dead at the back of th
Tropical House. Obviously they had left the nest too early, as did th
original first youngster reared in 1972. Regretably it was not knowi
that the female was sitting, for no nest was, or has been, found and sh
was always on view when we were in the house.
It may be of some interest to record that a hybrid was produced, to a:
embryo stage, by a female Active (Black-billed Jamaican) Parrot, Amazon
agilis, and a male White-browed (Spectacled) Parrot, A. albifrons albifrow

With the six adults he now has Len Hill has succeeded in breedin
more than fourteen Mountain-witch Doves. This rare Jamaican specie
is one of the more beautiful of the doves and it is to be hoped that throug
Mr. Hill's efforts it may now become more widely established in aviarie

During discussion of the effect of light on bird breeding cycles at a
cent conference an attempt was made to relate this to the aviculturists'
-oblem of migratory native species that may come into breeding condition
o early if given too much light during winter. Dr. R. Murton's advice
as that if the daylight in the bird's wintering area is unknown it is best
play safe and stick to a less than 12 hour day in winter. Since experi-
ents show that a brief period of illumination during the hours of darkness
.ch night can have a similar effect to a long day in stimulating a bird's
eeding responses it seems inadvisable even to switch the lights on once
e birds have gone to roost.

Peter Brown writes from the Harewood Bird Garden . . . " Our most
teresting breeding to date this year has been that of four Ypecaha
ood Rail which are now half grown and scampering all over their aviary
ith their parents. This is one of the tallest of the Rails, standing
" in.--2 ft. and not at all secretive like most Rails. They are eating
ostly live food and a little beef.
Ringnecks and imported Redrumps have young as do Peach-faced and
scher's Lovebirds. Penguins were again a disaster with six hatched but
&amp;gt;ne reared. The oldest lived for two weeks on hand-rearing but then
ed. We have tried a variety of food substances, but we cannot come up
th the complete answer. Invariably the parents let their young die
thin a week.
The pheasants have been very eratic in fertility with Coppers, Mikados,
iot s and Bar-tails all being clear but Swinhoes and Brown-Ears are very
: rtile and we have seven young at present.
We have likewise had good hatches with Bar-head, Snow and Barnacle
sese and Bahama Pintail.
We have three pairs of Snowy Owls sitting and are keeping our fingers
dl and truly crossed, and Barn Owls have three young.
Last year we sent some Californian Quail form America. These birds
ve been paired to our own birds and we now have dozens of young quail,
utility has been excellent.
One interesting pair is a male Roseate Spoonbill which has paired up
1 a Scarlet Ibis. They have built a nest and the Ibis is now sitting,
would be nice to produce a Scarlet Spoonbill. "

{Manacus candei and Chiroxiphia linearis )
By Dr. David Snow (Tring, Herts., England)
The accompanying plate shows the males of two Central American
aanakins, the White-collared Manakin (. Manacus candei ) and the Long-
ailed Manakin ( Chiroxiphia linearis). These small fruit- and insect-eating
irds, of about the size of tits, belong to a tropical American family and
re not to be confused with the seed-eating mannikins of the Old World
ropics. They are most remarkable for their courtship displays, which
re unsurpassed in complexity and variety.
Males of the White-collared Manakin gather at leks, traditional dancing
reas on the forest floor, where each male clears for himself a " court "
no or three feet across, from which he removes all fallen leaves and any
ther debris light enough to be carried away. The basic element of the
isplay consists of rapid leaps, each accompanied by a loud snap of the
ings, to and fro between upright perches on either side of the court.
Occasionally the bird leaps down to the bare ground of the court and up
^ain, with a curious grunting sound, to a higher position on the same
erch. The females visit the males at their courts and mating takes
lace on one of the upright perches beside the court. The bird in the
late is shown preparing to make a jump from one upright perch to another,
he white throat feathers are puffed out forwards so that they project as
beard beyond the tip of the short beak.
The Long-tailed Manakin displays quite differently. Pairs of males
ke part in a perfectly coordinated dance on a horizontal or slightly
aping perch two or three feet above the forest floor, usually in a place
here the undergrowth is thick and observation difficult. In this display
e basic element consists of a jump, with fluttering wings, head held low,
id long tail feathers drooping, accompanied by a curious vibrant call
miniscent of the twanging of a jew's harp. The two birds jump
ternately, as one lands the other jumps up, and the perfectly timed
cernate jumps, with the rhythmic twanging, may continue for half a
inute or more. When a female visits the display perch the two males
ce her, and the jumping then takes the form of a Catherine wheel

revolving before her; as one male jumps he moves back in the air, whil
the other hitches himself forward to take his place, jumping as the firs
bird lands.
Both of these manakins have traditional sites for their displays, whicl
apparently persist as long as the forest remains undisturbed. Male an&amp;lt;
female have little to do with one another except at the time of mating
The female alone builds and attends the nest, which is a slight hammock
like structure slung in a horizontal fork of some low plant. The norms
clutch is invariably two eggs, whitish in ground colour with fairly thic
brownish streaks and mottling. The eggs hatch in about 19 days and th
nestlings remain about 14 days in the nest.

RECENT PARROT BREEDINGS AT THE
SAN DIEGO ZOO
By Dr. James M. Dolan, Jr., Director of Animal Sciences
(San Diego, California, U.S.A.)
Psittacines represent the largest single family of birds exhibited in th
San Diego Zoo. They have long been a speciality of the collection and
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.998122565217391" page_id="58078488"  page_num="146" year="" vol="">
number of species and subspecies have reproduced here for the firs
time in captivity or in the United States. Between 1st January 197
and 30th March 1973 a substantial number of hatchings have taken place
Certainly the most important is that of a Red Shining Parrakeet, Prosopei
tabuensis splendens on 4th March 1973* Unfortunately this bird die
on 10th April 1973. Two previous clutches were laid by the he
but these were all infertile. The first clutch consisted of four eggs
the second three and third three. The adult group of birds is com
prised of four males and a single female captured in June of 1970 i
Kavala Bay, Kandavu, Fiji Islands. Three males and the female occup
an aviary twenty feet long by six feet wide by seven feet high in whic
are hung two standard grandfather clock nests. All four birds hav
proven to be very compatible, and there has been no fighting within th
group. Oddly enough, these birds have never exhibited any noticeabl
breeding display. The hen has always spent a great deal of time in th
nesting box, as has been our experience with hen Eclectus, so it is nc
possible to give an exact incubation period. The fourth male Re
Shining is housed with a pair of Masked Parrakeets, Prosopeia personal
and as in the case of the Red Shining group, all three birds are compatibk
As far as we are aware this is the first successful rearing of a Red Shinin
Parrakeet in captivity. Two further subspecies of P. tabuensis are kej
in the collection: P. t. tabuensis , which to date have shown no inclinatio
to nest; and P. t. koroensis , which have laid two clutches of infertile egg;

DR. JAMES M. DOLAN, JR.--PARROT BREEDINGS AT SAN DIEGO ZOO 147
Of almost equal interest is the hatching of a Blue-crowned Lorv
mi australis on 29th March 1973. The parent birds arrived on 21st
ovember 1970 from Apia, Western Samoa among a group of five of
Inch they are the only survivors. This pair of birds produced three
evious clutches of infertile eggs. Again we believe this to be a first
ptive hatching.
Other hatchings among the lories and lorikeets during the 1972-1973
:riod are as follows: one Red Lory, Eos b. bornea; four Forsten's Lorikeets
&amp;apos;ichoglossus h. forsteni; two Edward's Lorikeets, T. h. capistratus; 13'
:d-collared Lorikeets, T. h. rubritorque; 20 Ornate Lorikeets, T. ornatus;
Scaly-breasted Lorikeets, T. c. chlorolepidotus; 17 Perfect Lorikeets
itteuteles euteles; 14 Mt. Apo Lorikeets, P.johnstonae; two Iris Lorikeets'
Urn; three Blue-thighed Lories, Lorius lory erythrothrorax; nine Yellow-
cked Lories, L. garrulaflavopalliata; and 11 Musk Lorikeets, Glossopsitta
icinna.
Several interesting hybrids have also been hatched. One Burn Red
*ry, Eos b *rnea cyanonothus x Swainson's Lorikeet, Trichoglossus h.
luccanus. This particular bird closely resembles Mivart's plate (1896)
the hybrid Gray's Lorikeet, although the parentage is quite different,
has proven to be a hen and is now paired with a cock Red-collared
rikeet. Since the hybrid bird is a generic cross, it will be interesting
see if it proves fertile. Four Scaly-breasted, Trichoglossus c. chloro-
&amp;apos;\0x25A0dotus x Meyer's Lorikeets, Psitteuteles flavoviridis meyeri have been
&amp;gt;ed since 22nd November 1971. These birds closely resemble the male
ent except they are somewhat smaller, more plump and unlike the
ler have yellow rather than red under-wing coverts. One of these is
v paired with an Iris Lorikeet. A hybrid Black-winged, Eos cyanogenia
led Lory, Eos b. bornea was hatched on 2nd February 1973. It is too
y to tell what this bird will look like when it is fully feathered, but for
present it has begun to grow black feathering on the head and wings
n the male parent.

Until the study of Guttinger (1970), the Grey-headed Silvert.
(Odontospiza [. Lonchura ] caniceps ) was one of the least known of t:
mannikins (Lonchurae). Between January 1971 and March 1972 I ke:
two wild caught pairs of these estrildids, as well as four males and V\
females which were hatched and raised in my home by Striated Finch
{Lonchura striata). I made previously unreported observations on tj
behaviour of these individuals. Some of these observations appear to s
of taxonomic importance. In describing displays, the terms invertl
curtsey ", " lateral pivoting ", and " leap-frogging " used throughout th
paper, are after Morris (1957).
Each breeding pair was kept alone in a cage measuri;
22 in. x 18 in. x 21 in. When not breeding, they were kept in a cg
22 in. x 36 in. x 49*5 in. along with some other estrildids. The bin
were colour-banded for individual recognition.

Guttinger (1970) describes the courtship display of this species 3
follows: The male grasps a grass stem by one end in the manner of ma/
other estrildids. He flies before the female, then performs inveril
curtsies accompanied by song. The inverted curtsey is a bobb'
movement in which the main component is an upward thrust imparted ba
straightening of the legs. The female then performs inverted curtsiesi
synchrony with the male, but without song or a grass stem. After a whj)
the male drops his grass stem, and turning his bill and tail in the direct !
of the female, sings his long song. The male's display is ofjp
accompanied by bowing (the " low twist posture " of Moynihan and H i
1954), which in turn often passes to displacement bill wiping. The abec
ceremony may also be initiated by the female, if she flies before the ntf
and begins inverted curtsies. This display is infrequently, thou
regularly, performed during pair-formation and before the laying of t
first egg. In contrast to most other estrildids, the inverted curtsey dispj
of this mannikin has never been observed to lead to copulation. Frequer&amp;apos;
the display is followed by allopreening, or both partners feed.. Guttini
(1970: 1052) has suggested that this display functions to stimulate u
synchronize mated pairs.

The display of my wild-trapped male Left-Yellow (LY) was as follows:
ith bill mandibulating and pointed at an angle skywards, head and tail
rned towards the female, and belly slightly fluffed, LY would sing his
lg song. If the female changed perches, he would follow her, keeping
3 same posture and continuing to sing whenever he landed next to her.
she remained still, he would approach her in short hops, while still
iging and posturing. Sometimes the female would respond with tail
ivering in typical estrildid manner. Irrespective of the female's
haviour, the male would often fly on her back, attempting to copulate.
'Ually he would leap-frog off. Only on one occasion did copulation
sue.
LY's display was similar to the second part of the display described by
ittingei (1970). The position and movements of the bill were similar
that seen in solitary song (Giittinger, loc. cit .), however, the lateral
noting movements of the head were absent. Only on one occasion did
. perform inverted curtsies during courtship. Although there were
/ays grass stems in the cage which LY utilized in nest-building, these
re never used in display.
The display of my second wild trapped male, Left-White (LW),
Fered markedly from that of LY. His display may be divided into the
lowing two parts: (i) the submissive courtship portion (terminology
sr Goodwin, 1965) and (ii) the inverted curtsey portion. The first
play was usually followed by the second, although each could be
\0x25A0formed without the other.
Submissive Courtship. In this display, the male crouched on a perch
ct to the female. The feathers of the belly were fluffed and covered
st of the legs with only part of the toes showing. Its body was bent
;htly away from the female. With head and sometimes the tail pointed
her direction, with bill wide open, and tongue protruding and moving
-k and forth, the male sang to her. Frequently, the male's wing distal
the female was flicked out and in very rapidly several times during
?ing (Fig. 1). A second male, Right-Black (RB), the offspring of LW,
i observed performing this display twice. This display is similar to
t described for other estrildids, for example, the species of Uraeginthus
rodwin, 1965). In the Red Avadavat (Amandava amandava ), a similar
?lay is given, but only to strange females (Kunkel, 1959; Goodwin,
&amp;gt;0).

e LW erected himself. With bill still wide open, tongue still
truding and moving back and forth, head and tail pointed towards the

danced away from the female. Inverted curtsies were interspersed wit
bows and or displacement bill wipes. Sometimes the male merel
nodded at the female, probably an intention movement to bow (Morrii
1958). On a few occasions, double bows were observed, one bow followe
immediately by another. As in submissive courtship display, the win
distal to the female was often flicked out and in very rapidly. On on
occasion (19th February 1972) the wing was also quivered as in juvenil
begging display (Giittinger, 1970).
The female sometimes responded with inverted curtsey displays. 0
rare occasions this was followed by tail quivering. Copulation wa
observed only twice (see below).
LW and LY's displays could be elicited by reintroducing their female
to them after a short period of separation. When not breeding, LW woul
display to any strange conspecific, irrespective of its sex, when the latte
was introduced into the cage holding him and his mate. When breeding
LW would ignore or attack strange conspecifics introduced into it
breeding cage.
Three other males, offspring of LY, were observed performing ster
displays as described by Giittinger (1970). These were never at hig
intensity, as observations were made when the birds were still juveniles.

Copulation
At 6.47 p.m. on 9th February 1971 a successful copulation was
bserved between male LY and his mate Right-Red (RR). I was sitting
bout 3 ft. from their breeding cage when I heard LY complete two
angs. I looked up to see LY on RR's back, his wings fluttering rapidly
nd tail thrust under hers in the act of coition. After dismounting he
ew back and forth between two perches placed ij ft. apart. He next
ew beside the female, and both birds then engaged in displacement
utopreening. At 6.34 P*m. the same day LY performed the same display
escribed earlier. He flew on his mate's back in an attempt to mount her
ut she did not respond. RR laid her first egg on 15th February 1971.
On 1 st January 1972 male LW was observed performing high intensity
isplay to his mate (unbanded). She solicited with tail quivering, her
ead was slightly upturned and bill wide open. The male leap-frogged
ver her back four times, but no copulation ensued.
A copulation was observed between the same pair on 12th February
972. The male displayed at full intensity, and the female solicited
Dpulation with the tail quivering, her head slightly upturned, and bill
ide open. After leap-frogging off her back twice, the male finally
tounted. He stood perched on her back with tail widely spread for a few
iconds, during which time the female's tail was still quivering. He
nally copulated with her. After he had dismounted and flown to another
jrch, the female was seen performing inverted curtsies. At 12 noon on
7 th February 197 2 LW displayed to his mate at high intensity and the
male solicited with tail quivering. The male leap-frogged off her back
ice, then copulated with her. The female performed displacement bill
iping after coitus, and the male preened his belly.

There appears to be individual variation in the displays of Grey-headed
lverbills. Whereas inverted curtsies were always performed by LW,
ey were rare in LY s displays. Whereas stem displays were performed
Giittinger s birds and three of the four offspring hatched in my bird
om, I could never induce LW or LY to use stems in their displays,
oreover, displaying with bill wide open and tongue wagging were
served only in two birds (LW and RB).
Individual variation of this degree is not unusual among the Lonchurae.
the Cherry Finch (Aidemosyne viodesta ), for example, males also have a
m display, followed by singing with bill wide open. However,
lmelmann (1965) informs us that: " ... there is great individual variation
this species. Some males never use a piece of grass, others never sinsr
th bill wide open. ..."
Copulation has not hitherto been described for the Grey-headed
verbill. It has been suggested that for the Grey-headed Silverbill and
forms of Spermestes , copulation takes place normally inside the nest

L. F. BAPTISTA--COURTSHIP OF GREY-HEADED SILVERBILL
(Giittinger 1970, Kunkel 1965). Kunkel (1965 : 175) observed only one
copulation for Spermestes ( Lonchura) bicolor. However, Morris (1957;
was of the opinion that with the Bronze Mannikin (Spermestes [Lonchura
cucullata) copulation on a branch was the usual method, suggesting that he
must have observed this more than once. It may not be too unusual then
for the Grey-headed Silverbill to occasionally copulate on a branch in the
usual estrildid manner. Indeed, several aviculturists (summarized ir
Immelmann et al. 1972, in press) have also observed tail quivering b)
female Grey-headed Silverbills in response to the courtship dance of the
male. An alternative interpretation of these observations would be tha
this is an artifact of captivity (see Immelmann et al ., loc. cit .), that await:
verification by field study. It is noteworthy that the bill open, head uj
posture of one of my soliciting female Grey-headed Silverbills was als(
observed in Bronze Mannikins by Morris (1957). Females of the latte
species, however, also protrude their tongue when soliciting. Morri
{loc. cit.) considered these to be important components of the female'
display, derived from the nest building elements of " mandibulating an(
scooping
Derivation of Display Components. The submissive courtship display
of the Grey-headed Silverbill is very likely derived from the begginj
display of the juvenile. The posture of the head (Figs. 1 and 2), tfi
waving tongue and wide open bill are all found in the begging juvenile
which does not always twist its head in the more usual estrildid manne
(Personal observation). Giittinger (197*) reported that young Grey
headed Silverbills also quiver their wings when begging. Wing quiverin,
is rare in estrildid finches, and has been described in Aeginthia temporalis
Erythrura prasina (Giittinger 197** Immelmann 1965) an&amp;lt; ^ LagonosticU
rubricata (Goodwin, 1964). Friedmann (i960 : 25) reported tha
nestlings of Estrilda subflava " move one or sometimes both wings forwar&amp;lt;
in a jerking, spasmodic gesture My observations indicate that ii
begging juveniles of Grey-headed Silverbills the wing distal from th
parent bird with food is also often slightly extended. The flicking dists
wing in the submissive courtship display of the Grey-headed Silverbill i
probably an intention movement to extend and quiver that wing. Thi
opinion was held by Goodwin (1965) who made similar observations 0:
species of Uraeginthus. I have reported on one observation of a Grey
headed Silverbill quivering a wing during courtship.
Relationship to Spermestes. LW's completed display was similar i
many respects to that of the Bronze Mannikin as described by Morri
(1957). The Bronze Mannikin also begins its courtship dance with
crouched display, with the bill open, and the tongue protruding an
moving. This is followed by an inverted curtsey display, and laten
pivoting when performed at higher intensity. Morris' birds also dance
toward and away from the female, and leap-frogging was described. Th
similar postures of the soliciting females of the two species have bee

liscussed. The differences between LW's displays and those of the
ironze Mannikin are that (i) LW's bill was pointed up whereas that of
he Bronze Mannikin was pointed down, (ii) Wing flicks were absent
rom the display of the Bronze Mannikin, (iii) The tongue was moved
nore rapidly (quivered) in the Bronze Mannikin, (iv) Soliciting female
Ironze Mannikins protruded their tongues.
Subsequent to Morris' (1957) study of the Bronze Mannikin, Kunkel
x 959 &amp;gt; x 9 6 5 ) and Giittinger (1970) have studied and compared courtship
lisplays of all the forms of Spermestes. The last two authors both
oncluded that courtship displays of all forms of Spermestes are similar,
&amp;gt;ut with quantitative differences with regard to the frequency of
ccurrence of the display components.
The Grey-headed Silverbill has been placed by some authors in the
enus (or subgenus) Euodice along with the two Silverbills Euodice
Lonchura) malabarica and E. (L.) cantans (see review in Giittinger, 1970).
xiittinger (1970; and personal observations) has shown that in a number
f behavioural characters (vocalizations, fighting postures, copulation in
le nest, absence of peering behaviour) the Grey-headed Silverbill more
losely resembles the African mannikins of the genus (or subgenus)
&amp;apos;permestes. My observations on the epigamic displays of LW and RB
idicate that the courtship displays of the Grey-headed Silverbill, although
affable, fall within the range of variation of that of species of Spermestes ,
;nding support to Giittinger's conclusion of their close relationship.
The use of the vernacular &quot; Grey-headed Silverbill " for Odontospiza
lonchura) caniceps would seem misleading, therefore, because it implies
close relationship to the Silverbills {Euodice). I propose the name
Pearl-headed Mannikin for this distinctive estrildid, a name similar

By Rae Anderson (Sierra Madre, California, U.S.A.)
Twenty years ago with the help of Dave West I got started with lutim
Indian ring-necked parakeets (Psittacula krameri manillensis). Then agaij
with Dave's help I started with the blue variety. Since then I have beei
working the hard, slow way from the original birds with split (recessive
factors towards birds that could produce the albino. The anticipate
was like that of a child waiting for Christmas with packages beckonin
under the tree.
A few years ago I was successful in getting a lutino cock and blue hen t
accept each other. This in itself was a project requiring several yean
Then finally one baby was hatched, a green male split to both yellow an
blue. Then a yellow hen split to blue and two more cocks, and a yea
later another hen. This year they hatched a single cock which die-
within a few days after hatching. I swapped two of these young " split
both-way " cock birds with Dave West and John Furniss to reduc
inbreeding.
This season a two-year-old pair started work particularly early with
clutch of three eggs in early January, 1972. On 12th February, thes
e ggs appeared to be clear and were removed. The nest was then checke
on 24th March, some two or three weeks after the hen seemed to b
incubating again. At this time there were four eggs. On 1st April th
nest was again inspected and to my exaltation and amazement, ther
were three pink-eyed babies. These appeared to be about five days ole
This breeding combination can produce green, yellow, blue and albin
but the probability of an albino is I believe about 1 in 8. The thre
pink-eyed babies immediately ruled out all greens and blues in this elute
and brought the albino possibility down to about 1 in 3. With thre
pink-eyed babies this means an almost certainty of having one albino.
Of course, my anticipation was almost without bounds but I did nc
want to take the nest box down and open it unless the hen was out. Fc
the past two weeks if she was not already in the box she had made a div
for it whenever she saw any of us approaching her aviary. I felt that b
this weekend, 22nd April, the babies would be old enough so that the]

pin feathers would be opening and would be too large to be injured by
the hen's scrambling if I opened the box with her inside.
Upon opening the box in the somewhat subdued light of the aviary
shelter with one of my sons, and while we were looking for the possible
white baby, my immediate reaction was one of disappointment at seeing
only two babies. This disappointment was very short lived, however,
as my son recognized before I did that one of the babies was indeed an
albino and that it was the larger of the two. The third baby appeared to
have been dead about a week. It was decomposed beyond recognition
except that a few tiny yellow feathers were apparent. The fourth baby was
never found.
I feel very fortunate that the bad odour of the dead baby had not caused
the mother to abandon the clutch. We had, however, been checking at
least every morning and evening to be sure that she was in the nest.
[ removed the albino from the nest for hand raising because of Harold
Rudkin's experience of the hen killing her white baby. This was probably
due to its " odd" colour. I could not risk this because my breeding
:ombination was identical to Rud's.
It is my understanding that the albino raised by the Keston Foreign
3 ird Farm in 1963 (the first recorded albino Indian Ringneck) was a
emale. From the colour genetics of its parents (Cummings, 1964) the
&amp;gt;nly albino possibility from this breeding is a hen. This bird
mfortunately died before reaching maturity.
Harold Rudkin then hatched the one that, shortly after its pin feathers
*pened, was killed by its parents. Post-mortem examination proved this
&amp;gt;aby to be a cock. Its skin is now in the collection of the Los Angeles
bounty Natural History Museum. Then in 1968, Mr. Rudkin was again
uccessful in producing an albino. This time, however, from parents
Mh a different colour genetic combination which could only produce
lbino hens. This breeding is related in the American Aviculture Bulletin ,
October, 1970. In 1969 Dr. Swaenepoel in Belgium successfully
used one. As stated (Swaenepoel, 1970) this bird had to be a hen.
understand that it is now in the collection of Alfredo Marques. My baby,
owever, has a 50-50 chance of being a cock based on the colour genetics
t its parents. This is from the same breeding combination as Mr.
.udkin's first which was a cock.
At this time the bird is a full grown perfectly proportioned specimen,
aving been independent since June, 1972. I am not able to do more than
iess at its sex because I have neither observed it to display nor other
lown males to display to it. I am, of course, hoping for a cock.

developed " albinos " the bird is actually a pink eyed blue (dilute--having
lost the melanin) bird. Since it is basically a blue bird with pink eyes
and since blue cocks have white neck rings, I suspect that our " albino "
factor will produce white birds with white neck rings. I am most anxious
for this to be proven one way or the other.
This year, 1973, another albino Indian Ringneck has been produced
in California. This was in the aviaries of another aviculturist. This
bird is now independent and an excellent specimen. It is from the same
genetic combination of parents as is mine. This now brings to three the
number of living albinos in Southern California. We believe that this
is the total number existing in the United States.

THE PAPUAN LORIKEET
By Rosemary Low (New Barnet, Herts., England)
The Papuan Lorikeet ( Charmosyna papou papou ) is virtually unknown

in aviculture and almost nothing seems to have been recorded about it.
There is, however, a plate of this species in Mivart's Monograph of the
Loridae. I never anticipated seeing any of the members of this genus
alive, let alone having the opportunity to keep one--but in aviculture
unexpected events are always happening, particularly regarding the
availability of species.
When a friend telephoned me in September 1972 to tell me that she
was about to import a Stella's Lorikeet (C. p. stellae) I was at first in-
credulous and, a few days later, on seeing the bird, completely captivated
The Charmosyna Lorikeets are among the most beautiful birds in the work
and this individual was hand-reared and completely fearless, thus adding
to its attraction. When I was asked if I would like to look after it for
time, my reply was naturally in the affirmative!
On closely examining the Lorikeet, I realized that it was not Stella s

gave the length as " from 16-9 to 14-93 inches, tail from io-6 to 8-23
yet this bird measured only 11 inches or 12 inches. The mystery was
solved when the Papuan moulted its tail (which as the photograph shows
was rather frayed); this was replaced by an 8 inch tail to give a total length
of approximately 14 inches. The tail is reminiscent of that of a Fischer s
Whydah {Vidua fischeri) in that it tapers almost to a hair's width. Wher
the tail feathers are spread the beauty of each feather can be seen. Ther

is a red patch on one side of the web, also a yellow patch which extends
to the side of the web which is mainly green.
This species is extremly slim in build and cannot be compared in this
respect with any of the more familiar species of Lorikeet. The shape of
the head and beak are, to me, reminiscent of certain Hanging Parrots
[Loricuius).
The colouring of the Papuan Lorikeet is particularly attractive. The
wings and the upper side of the tail are dark green, the underside of the
tail and the tip of the upper side being yellow. The head and underparts
are scarlet with a darker sheen on the upper breast. There is an almost
square patch of colour on the crown, which is dark blue at the front,
becoming black. Further back, on the nape, there is a crescent-shaped
black patch. There is also a black patch on the abdomen which meets
the black of the front of the thighs, the thighs being yellow at the back.
The lower rump is decorated with a patch of dark blue.
The feet are pinkish and the nails black; beak orange; iris orange with
1 very narrow ring of paler orange which is noticeable only on close
nspection.
The Charmosyna Lorikeets are sexually dimorphic, thus I know that
:he bird in my temporary possession was a male. Salvadori described
the female as follows: " The red feathers on the sides of the rump have
the base yellow; a yellow-orange patch over the yellow spot above the
thighs."
He stated that in immature birds the nape, abdomen and thighs (which
ire black in adult birds) are dark green.
Being hand-reared, the Papuan loves attention and would display as
;oon as I spoke to it. In display, the yellow patches on the thighs stand
iway from the body. A soft whistling noise is made and one foot is
ifted and waved, more rarely both feet in turn.
The flight is unlike that of the more familiar Lorikeets, no doubt
partly due to the fact that the long tail holds the bird back to a certain
iegree. Another characteristic is the way in which a perfectly straight
ine of flight was never taken, the bird always flying upwards just before
anding.
The Papuan refused fruit and small seeds. Its diet consisted of nectar
nade from equal amounts of honey and malt, with the occasional addition
&amp;gt;f condensed milk, with the same mixture added to trifle sponge. The
'apuan was particularly fond of the latter. Every day several drops of
he orange-flavoured multi-vitamin preparation Vitavel were added to
he sponge cake and nectar. On this somewhat monotonous diet the
'apuan thrived--in fact I have seldom seen a fitter and more active bird,
t bathed every day and kept itself in immaculate condition.
After nine months in my care, the Papuan was sold to a fellow member
f the Avicultural Society. I am pleased to recoid that it now resides
1 a 20 ft. planted aviary, in a collection of small softbills, where it is
reatly admired by all who see it.

(Rhinoptynx clamator)
By Ann E. Goodman and Erma J. Fisk (Florida, U.S.A.)
Two Striped Owls, ( Rhinoptynx clamator ), obtained separately as
non-flying juveniles in Iquitos, Peru, have been observed since 17th
August 1963 (male) and 14th September 1964 (female) by A. E. Goodman
in an outdoor aviary in South Miami, Florida, U.S. This pair has raised
five young since April 1969. As nothing seems known of the breeding
habits of this owl except that it is a ground nester (Haverschmidt, F.,
Birds of Surinam 1968) we present here a description of the nesting
behaviour of this captive pair.

The birds live in an outdoor aviary 6 ft. x 10 ft. x 10 ft. with a natural
ground floor, natural perches, and tropical planting. Each bird daily
consumes two or three day-old chickens from a supply kept continually
available, with an occasional dead rat or mouse as offered. The male has
been seen to catch and eat a Cuban tree frog (Hyla septentrionalis).
Cardinals, Mockingbirds and warblers enter the aviary without molesta-
tion. Neither owl has been observed to drink.
Nesting and Incubation
Breeding behaviour was first initiated by the male in February 1966.
His soft night hooting became louder, with an aggressive tone. He made
rudimentary nest scrapes, profferred food to the female, which she
refused, and attempted copulation. This behaviour continued inter-
mittently until the first egg was laid on 6th April 1969. Since then 10
clutches have been incubated, three with four eggs each, seven with three.
The male makes several shallow scrapes at each nesting. Originally
these were primitive, but they have developed until the last was a depression
about seven inches in diameter, deepened by the female during brooding
to three quarters of an inch. The only nesting material is litter such as
bits of leaves which the female may pull in while sitting, and stuff under
her breast.
Eggs are unspotted pinkish-buff. The only one measured was
4*7 mm. x 5-5 mm. Apparently they are laid before mid-morning at
approximately 60 hour intervals. Incubation is by the female only and
starts with the first egg. The period to hatching is approximately 33 days.
The time differential in four clutches where two chicks were hatched was
judged to be from one to five days. During her first incubation the female
often left the nest for periods of time, even in rain. Thereafter during

he first two weeks of each brooding she left very briefly, only once or
wice a day, to defecate. She is fed on demand, by the male. Eggs are
urned with the bill. The nests have been moved several times from
.ne to five feet, either with eggs, or chicks in them. In one instance
he chick was three weeks old. The method was not observed, nor the
aethod by which the nest is always kept clean. The female has been
bserved eating the hatchling's shell. A downpour flooded the nest
1 days before, one successful hatching until for 15 minutes only the
lcubating bird s head was above water. Weather of this sort would be
epical in the range of this tropical species.

Brooding
A chick is closely brooded in the nest for about two weeks. T&amp;lt;
accommodate its rapid growth the female deepens the nest and broods witl
arched wings. She maintains this posture, wings arched, head bent ove
the young, while feeding for some time after the chick has emerged fmn
the nest. Small pieces of food are gathered into a mouthful and proh-rei
with a special cluck, the chick taking the food from her bill. If alarmec
she signals the chick to return under her wing by rapping it on the crown
The chick signals its desire for shelter by pecking at the joint of her winj
and shoulder until the wing is raised. When a chick has grown too larg
to brood she backs up against it and raises her wings over it. It is shelters
from rain by this means until it is almost full grown.
When first out of the nest the small chick sleeps flat out on the ground
neck extended, feet tucked under. The female shelters it from sun by
raised wing, or her shadow cast from a perch above it. Even whe
full-grown a chick will lean against the female when resting; and th
female was seen to leave a new clutch of eggs untended several times t
feed a 50 day old chick that was refusing to accept food from the mak
Both parents watch the chick closely at all times. The female stay
physically closer, the male is more nervous at human approach to th
aviary, and more agitated by the mishaps of flight, or failures in sell
feeding of his young.
Bill as a tool
There is some evidence of the bill being used as a tool. Small chick:
unsteady, may fall into the bloody carcasses of the chickens from whic
their food is coming. The female has been observed to gather pieces c
dried leaves in her bill and to use them to wipe the blood from bot
faces and breasts of the young. With many avian species a chick th;
falls from the nest, or gets into physical difficulty will be ignored and le
to die. One of these young owls attempting flight after clambering u
the aviary wire to a high perch, crash-landed in the base of a palm tre
and became helplessly wedged among the stiff stalks. Both parents wei
much agitated. The female flew down and pulled aside one of the sti
stalks until the chick was freed.
Communication
Except when the female is on the nest mating is frequent. Tf
voices of all these owls have been distinctive, and they are strong!
communicative. There is much soft, low, conversational hooting t
day as well as by night. On the nest the female clucks when she wish*
food brought to her and she has been observed to cluck persistently unt
the male removed unwanted food. If he delays in attending her si
becomes agitated and screams. It is the female who shrieks alarm
nocturnal possums or other animals coming about the aviary at nigh

The first warning sound given by the male when disturbed is similar to
he heavy breathing of a human. With continuing disturbance he will
dick his bill rapidly, hiss and spread his wings. In full attack he is
ioundless, but hits the aviary wire with great force.
By the 18th day all three birds eat at the nest. The female does not
)ermit the male to feed his young until after she has done so. Later,
vhen she is teaching an older chick to pick its own food, if the male
ittempts to aid the unskilled young she interposes herself, often screaming,
mtil he retreats. On the other side of the coin, when the eggs of a clutch
that failed) were left unattended, the male was much agitated; and another
ime, when the female left a nest after heavy rain to spread her wings in
he sun, the male screamed at her until, still wet, she returned. Again,
few-day-old chick was seen abandoned out of the nest, extended on
he earth, ignored by the female. The male flew hooting about the aviary
ntil finally she scooped the chick up with her bill and tucked it under
er. Then he quieted. (The chick disappeared that night.) Chick
L, a female, was removed to a second aviary, where she lives with a
Spectacled Owl (Pulsatrix perspicullata). They copulate and she sits on
ifertile eggs. But during the mating season she calls constantly to the
tale of her own species a few feet away. Another chick, removed from
s parents at 60 days (as the female was sitting on a new clutch) was also
ut in with the Spectacled Owl, who preened, and fed it. Both chick and
arents cried back and forth to each other for many days.
The following timetables are roughly applicable to the development
f all five young, as the growth patterns have been similar.
ehaviour development
atching: male at this time only viciously attacks at any approach to
aviary.
days: chick seen leaning unsteadily against female, who interposes
herself between it and any observer.
days: chick attempts to pick at food.
days: chick sleeps in open close to female; preening effort.
&amp;apos; days: chick out from under female for good, except in heavy rain.
&amp;apos; days: chick bobs and weaves head like adult, clicks bill, hisses and
spreads wings at humans.
i days: chick wanders from nest, picking at leaves and sticks.
days, chick perches close to the ground, on sticks or small rocks.
days: chick climbs wire of aviary, using talons, bill and wings.
Unsuccessful attempt at flight.
days: pellet seen cast.
-45 days: chick preens, perches on one foot, like adult. Climbs up
wire to high perch, is unable to descend. Stays in this one place for
several days, moving away from position to defecate.

Chick gives a new, clucking call.
57 days: chick flies freely and feeds alone, although with difficulty.
62 days: parents refuse to feed. The chick will cry, day and night fo
several days, a thin high cry like the squeak of a hinge. Chick /
went without food until. . .
66 days: chick picks 2-day-old chicken off ground and eats it. Usually
in feeding small pieces are given, but occasionally a thigh and leg hav
been seen to be swallowed whole. A single instance was observed
at 58 days, of a chicken swallowed whole. An adult has never beei
seen to do this.

By J. V. Beer (The Game Conservancy, Fordingbridge, Hants.)
and
Janet Kear (The Wildfowl Trust, Slimbridge, Gloucester, England)
Cladosporium herbarum , a common fungus present on plants, organic
ebns and in the air, is also known as a pathogen on the plumage of
aptive flamingos (Beer 1969). It forms black sclerotia within the feathers,
jpturing the cortex and weakening the structure so that the distal
ortions of the feather barbs break off (see the plate). The plumage of
le back becomes dingy and frayed, and the birds are wet and miserable-
toking. At Slimbridge, the condition has sometimes seriously affected
le Chilean form Phoenicopterus chilensis in the late autumn and, to a
sser extent, the Andean Phoenicoparrus andinus and James' P. jamesi
The mould is slow growing at an optimum temperature of 24-25*C.
t 27*C, the growth rate is halved and at 3o*C, spore germination is
impletely prevented. Below 24*C and down to o*C, development is
uggish, although sub-zero temperatures are necessary to prevent growth
together. At o*C, a colony on an agar culture will be 2-3 mm. across
2 ~3 nionths. Because of this temperature relationship, only the
imingos outer feathers, away from the bird's body heat, are affected
le scapulars are especially prone) but, conversely, cold winter weather
.11 not entirely inhibit growth. The spores also survive dehydration
d, because they are heavily pigmented, do not succumb to light. Thus
iatment is difficult.
Badly affected feathers can be pulled out or cut off. Dusting with a
ngicidal powder only affects the hyphae deep in the feather with
iflculty. Raising the ambient temperature to 3o*C should stop growth,
t onl y while heat is applied; in any case, this temperature level will not

In the autumn of 1972, the Chilean Flamingos were seen to be partic-
irly badly affected. There had been severe attacks by aphids

f surfaces had become coated with the sugary honey-dew secreted by
J insects and later covered with a black mould which had apparently
ised the leaves to fall. By December, the tree trunks were still thickly
wdered with a sooty mould and from this C. herbarum was cultured in
' laboratory.

Flamingo pen appeared to be a balsam poplar Populus gileadensis, th&amp;lt;
trunk of which has now been painted with malathion.
It is too early to say whether this treatment will prevent mould outbreak
on the flamingos' plumage in the future. Clearly, in summers whei
aphids are especially common, the vegetation in the vicinity of colonie
needs periodic examination. Cladosporium spores cannot be complete!
removed from the environment, since they are the commonest funga
component of the airspora, but gross local contaminations can probabl
be checked.
Apparently C. herbarum does not act as a pathogen in other birds, an.
the captive waterfowl sharing the habitat of the flamingos at Slimbridg
are unaffected. The mould is opportunistic and can grow on a weakl
nutritive substrate. If the bird washes itself in water contaminated wit
food and faeces, then the materials adhering to the feather surface provid
a substrate on which initial mould growth is possible. This does nc
explain why the particular fungus invades the structure of flaming
feathers. C. herbarum is clearly able to pass through the keratin walls
the action may be mechanical or enzymic. In vitro , isolates from infecte
feathers appear to cause no change in the structure of mammalian hah
although growth is vigorous (Clayton and De Vries, pers. com.). Damage
feathers would be more easily invaded, but only a minute hole is needec
Perhaps keratinisation is less complete in flamingos thus facilitatin
penetration, and at the same time providing a richer substrate on whic
the fungus grows and produces the hyphal masses which damage tf
barbs. Perhaps the preen gland oil is fungistatic in resistant avia
species. Further investigation is required.

(Tangara nigrocincta )
By C. Miller, Jr. (Baltimore, Maryland, U.S.A.)
In the spring of 1973 I succeeded for the first time in breeding my pair
f Masked or Mrs. Wilson's Tanagers. The breeding took place in a
ight 8 ft. x 6 ft. x 7 ft. high, located in the third floor unfinished attic of
ly home in Baltimore. In the flight along with the tanagers were some
8 other birds, all seed-eaters. The tanagers attempted to breed several
mes before succeeding. Following are the details and background of
leir breeding history.
I obtained them in November, 1971 from Canary Bird Farm in New
irsey. Walt Frey accurately picked out a pair from a South American
upment for me. I housed them in the above-mentioned flight; the
ther birds with them were: 1 pr. Java Sparrows, 2pr. African (Red-billed)
irefinches, 3 pr. Yellow-bellied or Swee Waxbills, 1 pr. Orange-cheeked
/axbills, 1 Red-eared Waxbill, 1 pr. Starfinches, 2 pr. Cut-throats,
Jacarini cock, 1 Red-billed Weaver, 1 pr. Button Quail. The Cut-
lroats and the Weaver were removed before breeding occurred.
In October, 1972 the Tanagers nested, laid one egg, but did not incubate
. They nested a second time 17th December 1972, laying two eggs in a
icker finch nest using only a little hair and string as lining. The eggs
atched in 14 days. The weather at this time was bitterly cold, and,
nee my attic is uninsulated, temperature there was chilly. On 8th
muary the temperature at 7 a.m. was 45*F. It rose to 51 as a high that
ay. I noticed then that all the birds in the flight increased their
msumption of live food (meal worms and fruit flies) considerably,
&amp;apos;n 9th January it was again 45*F at 7 a.m. On 10th January I fed live
&amp;gt;od at eight in the evening. I noticed then that the tanagers did not feed
us to the young immediately as they had been doing. On checking I
*und both babies stone cold and dead.
On 20th January I was distressed to see that the hen looked a little puffy,
kept an eye on her, and noticed that two days later she was missing,
check revealed a tail sticking out of the wicker nest, which incidentally
tey had defended as theirs all along. With a mirror I looked into the
sst and found two light blue, speckled eggs. One of these hatched on
:h February the other failed to hatch. The young was found dead on
ie floor of the flight on the evening of 7th February. Thus ended
&amp;gt;und 2. I should add that this time around I fed plenty of live food in
ve form of mealworms, corn grubs, and small crickets.
The next round began with a first egg on 18th February 1973. Needless
say, my enthusiasm had died down a bit by now. A second egg was
id on the 19th, and both of these hatched on time on 4th and 5th March,
lthough the parents were feeding, I removed the young on 6th March

C. MILLER, JR.--BREEDING THE MASKED TANAGER
and gave them to Fred Beall, principal keeper at the Baltimore Zoc
for hand feeding. Both lived until ioth March. They had been fe
soaked dog chow along with flakes of apple and orange.
The next round commenced with the hatching of one out of two egg
on 4th April. Although I fully expected this young one to be thrown 01
of the nest also, the parents continued to feed it. On 14th April I notice
that its eyes were open, and on 18th April it fledged. On 22nd April
banded the fledgling with the number AS-73-H289.
On 23rd April the hen laid another egg (she had looked puffy on th
21 st; apparently this is a sign that she is manufacturing an egg). A secon
egg appeared on the 24th. On 4th May the fledgling tanager, at foul
weeks of age, was still being fed by its father. On 7th May I saw it fee
itself for the first time, though later in the evening (and subsequently #
late as 12th May) I saw the cock bird feeding it also.
On 8th May the firstborn of nest no. six hatched, the other egg agai
failing to hatch. On 13th May at 8.30 a.m. I found this chick dead 0
the cage floor. I think it was thrown out, or at least died, because (
insufficient live food this time around.
On 20th May the six-week-old fledgling tanager began chasing the tin
waxbills for sport, so I caught him up and removed him from the aviar
On fledging, the bird's colour was overall a charcoal grey suffused wit
blue. The belly was paler grey. The beak was black with gape marl
of ivory. At the time of writing it has developed its blue shoulder patch*
and is fast developing its white abdomen and coppery nape. On fledgin&amp;apos;
its tail was very short, but it could fly well enough to keep off the floo
The food available to its parents during the time it was in the nest
as follows: apple, orange, banana (occasionally), peanut butter, Pruni
insectile (mockingbird) mix, Purina dog chow soaked 30 min. in co
water, finch mix, Scarlett's " wild seed " mixture, Stimulite nect
formula, and live food, including a fruit fly culture.
Some observations on the breeding behaviour of these birds: Firs
the female does all the incubation. Second, for the initial 14 days, tl
parents feed only live food to the young. Third, like most monogamoi
birds, the male assumes most of the responsibility for feeding the youi
after fledging, while the female goes back to nest. It is interesting to no
that these birds are supposed to build an open cup nest in nature, b
chose a covered wicker finch nest in my aviary. Finally, I might at
that the Calliste tanagers are not quite the " hothouse flowers " that mo
writers state they are. Mine took a low temperature of 34 degrees th
winter, with no ill effects. Success with the Masked has spurred me
try breeding other species of the group; I have a true pair of Speckl*
Tanagers (T. chrysophrys) which were observed mating by me and 1
Mr. A. G. Scott of Toledo, in March. Perhaps they will be next!
As verification of the authenticity of the Masked's breeding, I h;
Shon Ross of Baltimore observe the parents feeding the young befo

{Emberiza hortulana)
By John F. Dowling (Haddenham, Buckinghamshire, England)
During the winter of 1971-2 I received from a member of ASPEBA
living in Spain a pair of Ortolan Bunting, Emberiza hortulana , which he
had hand-reared. The male of this species is brown with dark streaking
on back, wings and tail, russet-buff below, with an olive-green head and
upper breast, and yellow on throat, moustache-streak and a thin ring
around the eye. The female is browner on head and breast and has
dark spots on the upper breast. The head feathers form a slight, peak-
like crest at times.
Not having kept this species before and wishing to keep them warm I
put them in a flight cage, 4 ft. 6 in. x 1 ft. 3 in. x 1 ft. 6 in., in my bird-
room during the winter months and in the spring of 1972 put them in an
outside flight, partly sheltered, 9 ft. x 6 ft. x 6 ft., together with three
greenfinches, Carduelis chloris. They were given a seed mixture but
appeared to eat hardly anything except plain canary seed and maggots,
borne softfood was available and they were also given 5 -- 6 mealworms a
day, which they ate.
Thinking that they would nest low like a Yellowhammer I made several
aest-sites close to the ground among growing hops and a small elderberry
oush; while for the Greenfinches I also put in wicker baskets surrounded
with a little evergreen foliage fixed about 4 ft. 6 in. up. During that
season the hen bunting built a complete nest in one of the finch baskets,
ind then started a second directly on the ground in the open, ignoring the
lesting sites in the hops. As far as I know no eggs were laid.
I saw virtually no courtship behaviour, apart from the fact that the cock
occasionally offered live food to the hen, and also offered the dried grass
ised as nesting material. The cock sang his rather simple song usually in
:he late evening, continuing at times into the night and early morning.
During this season the greenfinches bred successfully in the same aviary,
gnored by the buntings.
I wintered the pair outside, and this spring, 1973, they started to carry
lest material in late April; but before the hen could begin laying she was
scalped and killed by the cock. During the subsequent breeding season,
when the Greenfinches nested, the cock bunting tried to feed the young
md interfered so much that I had to remove him.

1 68 JOHN F. DOWLING-BREEDING THE ORTOLAN BUNTING
During the autumn of 1972 I had received a second pair of these bun-
tings. The male of this pair was very nervous, less brightly coloured and
with a slightly dropped wing. The female was very boldly coloured and
quite green on head and breast. I caged them for the winter as I had
with the first pair and a few days after they came was surprised to find an
egg on the cage floor. It was cracked so I broke it and found it to be
fertile. The female did not then lay any more.
In May 1973 I put this pair in a flight 10 ft. x 4 ft. x 6 ft. 6 in. high,
with access to a raised compartment in a bird-room 6 ft. x ift. 6 in. x
2 ft. 6 in. high. The outside flight had plenty of growing honeysuckle
and a small yew bush, and again I made some nest-sites at about ground
level. I had never heard this second cock sing, nor seen any kind of
mating or courtship behaviour, but early in June I noticed a lot of dried
grass on the floor of the inside flight, which is wooden and painted glossy
white. It looked as though the hen had tried to build a nest in one corner
but could not shape it because of the slippery floor.
I was not quite sure what to do but in the end I put three clods of dry
earth around one corner of the inside flight leaving enough room behind
them for a nest. The site was ignored for several days, but on 24 June the
hen started building here and on 25 June it looked finished. One egg
was laid in the nest on 27 June and others on the two subsequent days.
On 29 June the hen was on the nest. This was the first time I had seen
her anywhere near it. When I fed the birds that evening I found a
soft-shelled egg on the floor, so I presumed that she was sitting on three.
During the incubation period I saw the hen off the nest only two or
three times. She usually sat very tight even when I was moving about
and feeding birds. Two young hatched from the eggs on 12 July and
the third egg did not hatch. On 15 July one young one was dead. After
this date I often found the hen off the nest, but the remaining young one,
which was covered with whitish down, always appeared well-fed. During
this period I fed the small maggots sold as " squats " and small mealworms
1 to J in. long, later putting cut mealworms on softfood. The hen was
seen carrying these but I have never seen either parent actually feed the
young one, although I have seen the hen on the edge of the nest with livt
food in her bill.
On 20 July the youngster was seen perched on the edge of the nest
On 23 July it left the nest completely and after this for a week it dartec
for cover every time I went near the flight. On 30 July I was able tc
watch it for the first time without it flying for cover. It was pale buf
with fine streaking on the face and underside, and buffish-brown witl
darker streaking on the back. It had a pale buff throat, moustache-
streak and eye-ring; showing none of the colour of the adults.
At the time of writing in early September the young one is fully indepen
dent and well.

According to the 94th Annual Report of the Royal Zoological Society
of South Australia 25 species of Parrots were hatched and raised in th
Adelaide Zoo last year. Especially notable among them were 2 Musi
Lorikeets, 2 Rock and 3 Hooded Parrakeets and 2 Red-tailed Black
4 Leadbeater's and 2 Slender-billed Cockatoos.

The pair of Iris Lorikeets belonging to R. Kyme hatched a chick in

This species has not been raised in Europe but has on several occasions

*utcome have occurred in Mr. Kyme's aviaries and this year his birds
lave produced 4 Stanley and 3 Mealy Rosella, 3 Splendid, 1 Turquoisine

Although two members of the genus Charmosyna were bred successfully
1st before the First World War by Brook in Scotland, the stock died out
id the possibility of ever seeing again specimens of these glorious
-orikeets in our aviaries appeared very remote. A few Stella's Lori-
es were imported privately in the 1930's and went to the collection of
le late A. Ezra at Foxwarren Park where they flourished but did not
reed. Except for these, it is unlikely that any other specimens of the
mus appeared in this country for 50 years. It was a big avicultural
/ent, therefore, when a private importer succeeded recently in obtaining
single specimen of the Papuan Lorikeet which is now reported to be
iriving in the collection of Raymond Sawyer. Even more exciting was
le acquisition by the same enterprising importer of more than 20 Fair
r Fairy Lorikeets (C. pulchella ) all of which arrived in excellent con-
ation. This tiny, colourful species, about the length of a Budgerigar

When I first joined the Avicultural Society, almost 30 years ago, orn
of the most regular contributors to the magazine was Dr. Alan Lendon
Almost every species of Australian parrakeet bred successfully in his
aviaries, and I remember well his series of articles in the magazine whicl
ultimately were published in book form. More recently he wrote abou;
the Golden-Shouldered Parrakeet, the Cloncurry Parrakeet and th&amp;lt;
Blue-cheeked Rosella all of which he did much to establish as avian
strains in Australia. He is not only an ardent aviculturist but also ;
very keen bird watcher and his accounts of birds in the wild, some 0
which have also appeared in the Avicultural Magazine, have mad
fascinating reading. For years I have wanted to meet Dr. Lendon bu
my ambition was fulfilled only recently when I visited Adelaide earl;
this year. The few days which I spent mainly in his company represen
a highlight of my avicultural career. Together we visited some of th
parrot collections in the vicinity of Adelaide and spent several hour
watching the host of species of waterfowl which thrive on the Soutl
Australian salt pans. I shall write about the species we saw on anothe
occasion, but the most exciting to me were White-backed Wrens and my
first Grass Parrakeets in the wild, a pair of Elegants. Dr. Lendon i
still a practising aviculturist but he has reduced the size of his collectioi
considerably and now keeps pairs of rare species like Golden-shouldered
Hooded and Orange-bellied Parrakeets as well as Leadbeatter's Cockatoo
and a breeding colony of African Grey Parrots.

In making the presentation, Dr. Delacour spoke of his memories of the

Members assembled at 12.30 for sherry which gave a rare opportunity
for southern and northern M^embers to meet each other. After 3
delicious luncheon, Mr. Mottershead and Mr. W. Timmis, Curator, took
the party on a fascinating tour of the Zoo.
There was so much to admire in the beautifully landscaped and planter
gardens, the well-designed buildings which were both functional anc.
attractive, and the many rarities amongst the exhibits, that it would b(
hard to single out the most enjoyable feature, but probably the magnificen
Tropical House held the Members' interest for longest.
The time passed far too quickly and after meeting again for tea a

I am sure that all Members would wish to thank Mr. Mottershead anc
his staff most sincerely for their warm hospitality and for giving the
Society such an interesting and enjoyable day.

PIGEON RACING. By H. R. Axelrod and E. C. Welty Jr. London
The Oak Tree Press, 1973. Price #2.50.
As a boy I kept and flew Racing Pigeons for my own amusemen
During part of the war I was in the Middle East Pigeon Service, a
organisation which gave me a great deal of time to watch Racing Pigeon*
I have, however, never indulged in the competitive sport of pigeon racin
so it must be understood that I am only qualified to review this book
an ornithologist and pigeon-addict, not as one directly involved in tb
sport in question.
The book starts off with a refreshing lack of false modesty: " Just folio'
my suggestions . . . compare them with any other advice you have bee
given. I am sure you will have little trouble in being consistently amon
the top winners ". The pigeon racer's love for his birds is emphasisec
much in the book makes it clear that this love is conditional upon the birc
performing as their owner dictates and desires. This being so, it
perhaps as well that the statement (p. 10) that . . . the pigeon lo\&amp;lt;
Man ..." is demonstrably untrue as a generalisation even though it ms
be valid for a few individual pigeons.

Information on the keeping, breeding, training and flying of Racing
'lgeons is given in detail. In spite of this being, as we are assured
ased on personal experience, it often reads surprisingly like a compilation&amp;apos;
t is, for example, surprising that anyone who has looked closely at*
;t alone bandied, a blue chequer (the commonest colour pattern in Racing
lgeons) can write (p. 83): " A checker occurs when a pigeon's basic colour
; covered with small feathers of a darker shade--Some other state-
ients a ^o seem questionable or at least not applicable to all Racing Pigeons
&amp;gt;r example, that " very little attention is paid to the first egg " (p. 56)!
The widowhood system is fully explained. The section on this should
e of thought-provoking interest for all students of bird behaviour
specially any who doubt whether birds feel emotions as strong, illogical'
id easily manipulated by the unscrupulous as our own. The book is
sry fully illustrated with sketches, diagrams and a large number of
ccellent photographs. These latter include adult Racing Pigeons of
most every colour pattern, young of varying ages, and a few fancy breeds.

Tropical House where it very fortunately proved to make a pair. The
Tropical House is well-vegetated and maintained at a temperature of
ibout 70 degrees Farenheit.
After a few months it was noticed that the birds were trying to make
mall piles of mud on the Palm Tree leaves. It was hardly believable that
his was nest-building, but both birds were very busy at their objective.
3 ne day in 1972 n small mud nest was observed on top of a small girder,
.t was approximately 3^ ins. high and the bird was sitting on it. The
lest resembled a minute Flamingo's nest except for the lining of plant
nafcerial. Eggs were laid and a chick hatched.
Full success was achieved early in 1973. On 23 rd April both birds were
rantically building a nest on the same small girder. On 26th April the
len was sitting on the nest, probably all day. It was assumed that the
irst egg had been laid. On nth May there was a young one in the nest,
&amp;gt;eing fed with mealworms and maggots; and on 24th May it left the nest
md was really airborne in the next two days.
Since then the birds have nested several times and single voung again
&amp;gt;een reared.
As described above, the Spotted Morning Warbler, Cichladusa guttata
las been bred at Birdland, Bourton-On The Water. It is believed this
nay be a first success.

WARBLER, Cichladusa guttata , AT THE WINGED
WORLD
By Bryan S. Ward (Heysham, Lancs., England)
The Spotted Morning Warbler, sometimes known as the Spotte&amp;lt;
Morning Thrush, is a small thrush-like bird of six and a half inches. It
upper parts area dull rufous brown with a creamy-buff eye stripe, whils
below is also creamy buff, heavily marked with large black spots. Th
tail is cinnamon. There are three species of Morning Warbler a
confined to Africa. The Spotted Morning Warbler is found in the southen
parts of the Sudan spreading southwards through Ethiopia, Uganda am
Kenya down to central Tanzania.
They are comparatively rare in captivity, possibly due to the fact tha
they are not one of the more brightly coloured species which a lot o
people seem to prefer, although in a quiet sort of a way they are ver
attractive birds and have an extremely pleasant song. This is usuall
heard in the early morning and late evening. The sexes are more o
less alike, but the cock appears to have larger spots than the hen.
We have kept this species in Winged World for a number of years an
have found them extremely easy to cater foi; their requirements bein
a good soft food mixture and live food such as maggots and mealworms
Our original two birds built a number of nests over quite a long period
time. These were made mainly with mud, mixed with the odd piece c
dried grass or rootlets and shaped into a deep cup approximately fou
inches across overall, perfectly rounded, and about three inches deep, th
mud being nearly half an inch thick. These were invariably built on th
top of a vertical branch with a minimum width of three inches, where th
higher portion had been broken off leaving a rough finish.
They laid two pale greenish-blue eggs and incubated for twelve da&amp;gt;
plus, they then left the nest which ultimately collapsed. As mentione
above, this happened on a number of occasions, it wasn't until we foun
four eggs in one nest that we realised that we had two hens. We the
attempted to obtain two more birds, with the idea that out of four birds w
would have a better chance of getting a true pair.
Our two new acquisitions arrived in September 1972 and as one of ther
was more heavily spotted than the other we thought that we could have
true pair with these birds, and consequently released them both into on
of our planted compartments.
Within a month they had started carrying mud up into a rubber tre
and were attempting to fix it onto a sloping branch, with hopeless result
We then decided to help by fastening a piece of plastic netting horizontally
near to where they were trying to build. They did construct a nest ont
this, but that too was unsuccessful.

A wicker nest-basket was then fixed up earlier this year close to the
astic mesh and some mud was pressed into the bottom and sides to give
em a little encouragement. This they readily accepted and ultimately
id their eggs in, without very much more nest building. They incubated
r approximately twelve days. It is impossible to be more accurate, as
e necessity of placing the nest in a secure place also made it difficult
obtain good visibility owing to the foliage around it.
The chicks duly hatched, one was found on the floor beneath the nest
an approximate age of two days, the other one leaving the nest fifteen
ys from the assumed time of hatching. In colouring the young bird
sembles its parents, but is considerably smaller. Even so, it was
ing quite strongly on first leaving the nest on 1 st July.

(Empidornis semipartitus)
By Mrs. K. M. Scamell (St. Keverne, Cornwall, England)
This very attractive, graceful and unusual Flycatcher is not often
ported into this country and I have not seen others than those we have
tained ourselves direct from Roberts Wildlife of Lake Baringo, western
nya. There are three races, the nominate race from northern Ethiopia
ere it is stated to be common in dry thorn country, havirondensis which
iges from South-east Sudan, Uganda, the western half of Kenya to
rth Tanzania and the third race orleansi which ranges over parts of
stern, central and southern Sudan into western Ethiopia. The
ninate race is said to be slightly darker above than the other two races
1 the wings and tails of havirondensis are longer than either of the other
) races. We believe that some of the Silver Birds we have imported
r e been havirondensis and possibly two of them orleansi. The adults
y in length from a little under 7 ins. to 7J ins and in colour are a
ery grey above with the primary feathers dark grey. Below they are a
p tawny. Both sexes are alike.
)ur experience has been that Silver Birds are more sociable among
mselves than any other flycatchers we have kept. Even in the breeding
son we have had three of these adult birds in one aviary and though
re was some chasing there was no fighting. They are not to be
sted in a mixed aviary with smaller birds. There is no territory song
both sexes have a low and sweet song and call which is most
inctive.
n June 1966 we imported a pair of Silver Birds with their own

youngster which was still in juvenile plumage. We housed them in
planted aviary with a flight 9 ft. x 6 ft. x 6 ft. and a shelter 6 ft. x 6 ft. x 6
high. Though all three birds appeared to be in excellent conditi&amp;lt;
within a month the hen started to spit and sneeze and quickly died. j
postmortem showed respiratory parasites. The cock developed the sar*
symptoms but after a few days in a hospital-cage and with a veterinal
surgeon prescribing thiabendazole dusted on its mealworms for a we,:
it seemed to recover, but not for long as it died later that summer. T|
young bird never developed the parasite and is still in perfect conditio
now, seven years later. The next problem was to get a mate for op
unsexed bird still in juvenile plumage and it was not until May 1969 th
we were successful. From the behaviour of the two birds in the avia*
we felt sure we had a true pair, the new arrival, being slightly deeper 1
colour below, broader and a little longer, was a male and our three ye:
old bird a hen. Within a few days the latter started building a nest in n
open-fronted nest-box in the shelter. According to the " Africi
Handbook of Birds " Vol. 2 by C. W. Mackworth-Praed and Captai
G. H. B. Grant, from which book we have also obtained most of op
information on the nesting behaviour, range and races of the species 1
their natural surroundings which is mostly open acacia bush, the nomine
race appears invariably to breed in old weaver nests, usually those of t;
White-headed Buffalo Weaver Dinemellia dinemelli. The other two racs
either build a large nest of dry grass with a roof of thorny twigs or use tp
nest of other species particularly those of the larger Weavers.
By the 13th June our 1966 hen had cleared up all the dried grasses a;l
loosely twisted string or cord which we tease out and supply as a nesti&amp;apos;
material to many of our birds. The nest-box was soon filled to ov&amp;lt;-
flowing with an untidy mass of material and bore little resemblance tq*
nest. On the 22nd June it seemed that she was making no progress)
we fixed up another nest-box in the flight--this time with an entrars
hole. She quickly switched to this box but was intimidated by a cci
Tacazzi Sunbird, one of a pair nesting in the adjacent aviary, and soi
returned to her shelter nest-box. We then moved the nest-box from
flight to the shelter to give her the choice of the two but she still preferri
the open-fronted one. On 1st July another pair of Silver Birds arrivl
from Kenya. They were in perfect condition but as I was so sure tit
we already had a true pair I let a friend of ours have the new arrivalsji
Throughout the summer nest building continued but the hen seenu
unable to finish it off. It almost filled the nest-box by now, with te
entrance high up. The grasses and teased string all seemed to be hi
in one direction and not woven in any way. Feathers and other nesti^
materials were ignored. We were convinced by this time that t.s
particular bird was incapable of building a nest to her satisfaction and vs
probably descended from a long line of Silver Birds which use discards
Weaver nests so we sent to Kenya for such a nest! When it arrived

iced it inside another open-fronted nest box which it almost filled--but
e hen never took a look at it though we watched for hours over many days.
In June 1970 the hen commenced nesting again in the open-fronted
x in the shelter after the two birds had wintered together in the same
iary. She spent most of her time in the nest, sometimes remaining
it when I came into the shelter to feed. At intervals I checked the
st but no eggs were laid. She seemed to prefer long lengths of the
ised-out string or cord and threw out all the short lengths she had used
*lier. As last year she remained unsatisfied with the result and so
ssed another frustrating summer for the birds and ourselves! In
ptember our aviaries were dismantled and in October we moved to
*rnwall with the Silver Birds, other softbills and some nectivores. Both
ds spent the winter in cages in the bird room at our new home until an
ary was ready for them. Early in the Spring of 1971 the male Silver
*d died. It had been ailing for some time and though separately caged
m the hen, it had never really settled down since our move. The 1966
1 was placed in its new aviary with two Ant Thrushes which are ground
ds, while we awaited the arrival of two more Silver Birds from Kenya,
ough without a mate that summer she nested continuously in an
m-fronted nest-box in the flight.
rhe two new Silver Birds arrived on 31st August 1971 and seemed a
r. It was a bit late in the year to try and acclimatise them in the
ae aviary as the 1966 hen so after a short period in a cage together we
asferred them to a small aviary with a heated shelter and let them out
fine days only for the next eight months. All three birds called to
h other frequently.
)n 21st April 1972 we transferred the Ant Thrushes to another aviary
l replaced them by the two 1971 Silver Birds, shutting the three birds
:he shelter each night and releasing them to the flight each morning,
e three birds agreed and no fighting took place. Two food pots were
plied always. The flight is 21 ft. long by 6 ft. wide and is 6 ft. 6 ins.
h. The shelter measures 6 ft. x 4 ft. x 7 ft. 6 ins. high and is a compart-
it of our birdroom which we keep at a minimum of 45*F in the winter.
3 open-fronted nest-box of b in. wood measures inside 5 ins. wide,
ns. deep 4  |ins. high in front and 5J ins. high at the back, is placed
outside the shelter window about 6 ft. from the ground and facing
t. It is at the north end of the flight and is under a flat roof which
srs the flight for about 4 ft. of its length. This flat roof gives the nest-
cover from rain and direct sunshine. The aviary runs from south
Lorth and is heavily planted. There are two hydrangeas, a 4 ft.high
ge of Lonicera nitida about 10 ft. long, two fuchsias, two small black
:rs, a eucalyptus tree up to the roof and which requires much pruning,
ironica and a few spirea which are grouped around the nest-box area
give it some privacy. Outside the flight on the west side are three
e eucalyptus trees about 5 ft. or 6 ft. high and several alder about 10 ft.

helps to break the cold spring winds we seem to get. All this is idJ
cover yet the flight receives ample sunshine from the south and we.
Other nesting-boxes were erected but no interest was shown in them;
the old hen again resumed nesting in her old box.
At first it meant shutting the birds in the shelter each night as t*
spring was cold until the middle of May, particularly at night. As in tjf
past, the 1966 hen had a busy summer, building and rebuilding her nf
and sitting in it for days at a time except when she fed. No eggs were la.
The 1971 pair gave her a wide berth but made no attempt to nest the:-
selves. About this time we had started breeding locusts and these becai;
a part of the daily diet. They were readily taken, mostly by the cock. y
another summer and winter passed, the three birds in the flight by (|
from October to March and in the shelter at night.
In March 1973 when it came to the nightly job of shutting the birds 1
the shelter, the 1971 hen became more and more reluctant to enter so :r
her own safety we caught her up and caged her and now hoped the old hi
and the 1971 cock would pair and breed. On June 1st no progress hi
been made so we rather sadly came to the conclusion she would have to e
removed from the aviary and caged. We replaced her by the 1971 h"..
During the next few days there was some wild chasing of the hen by Is
ma le--up and down the flight for minutes at a time following which tb
would perch together. Though we never saw them mate, we did hi
they were compatible. The question was, would the hen be capable f
completing a nest or would she behave like the 1966 hen? We had it
long to wait; on 8th June just eight days after we had transferred hero
the aviary, there was a well finished and domed nest in the same nest-bs
plus one egg! The entrance hole was at the top and the materials we
the same, teased out string or cord and some raffia.
The weather was now very hot for this part of Cornwall, about 73 .
Incubation continued normally and when I checked the nest on the 22I
June there were three eggs, one more than is normal in Africa, t
10 a.m. on the 23rd June I saw an eggshell fragment near the water ft
about 18 ft. from the nest. This was the 16th day since the first egg vs
laid and 14 days since incubation had started. From then on we gtf
mealworms ad lib. (instead of about 10 each twice daily, with a simh
quantity of maggots plus insectivorous food which they will eat very vb
if they are rationed with live food). The weather was again very h i
74*F, with almost unbroken sunshine. The nest-box under the flat rd
must have been many degrees hotter so it was not suprising that the b
did not brood as much as one would expect. However we had t
consolation of seeing her taking mealworms to the nest several times 2^
saw both birds hawking for insects in and around the bushes. Whene 1
we have to give mealworms in quantity, which is usually when young bi e

re in the nest, we always coat the mealworms with vegetable cooking oil
nd dust them just as lightly with " Vionate " vitamin/mineral additive,
dther must not be done too freely or the mealworms become limp and
le birds wont feed them. The next day we saw some livefood being
arried to the nest, but in the afternoon both birds were perched together
Dr long periods. It was again hot. Partly from curiosity and partly from
ur need to know how many chicks we were catering for (mealworms
an be in short supply just when you need them and one requires a
:ock for safety), we shut the parents in the shelter and covered the window
ith newspapers while we checked the nest. There was one chick and
vo unhatched eggs which we left.
During the next few days the weather was cooler and more time was
Dent by the hen brooding. Only mealworms and locusts were fed by both
arents, maggots were untouched. On the ist July we observed the male
ill a third instar locust and take it straight to the nest, the hen flying out
5 he arrived. The male then went in to feed. The door-framing at the
id of the flight furthest from the nest was by now plastered with excreta
ics deposited by the male. The hen dropped the sacs she carried into
le larger hydrangea. By this time we were supplying about i J ozs. of
lealworms and about 25 locusts a day. On the 6th July, the 14th day
ter hatching, both parents were observed for over an hour during the
ternoon but were not seen to take food to the nest, so with the parents in
ie shelter and its window covered, I carefully put my hand in the nest-box
id felt a silky, fully-fledged bird which seemed to fill the whole of the
jst. Earlier in the day we had seen the mother carrying nesting material,
mce our doubts. Live food usage started to drop and as the days went
j without the young bird leaving the nest we began to wonder if all was
ell. On the 12th July I checked the nest again and again touched a
arm silky bird.
The next morning at 7 a.m., the 21st day after hatching, a young
bin-like bird was seen in the flight. It was spotted buff with darkish
^cks on the head underparts and back. The tail, about f in. long, was
ill grey as were the wings. No second fledgling was found though we
arched the flight from end to end. It was on a high perch at 2 p.m. and
7 p.m. we shut it in the shelter with its parents just to be safe! There
is only one unhatched egg (instead of the expected two) in the nest, so
other search of the flight was made. We then let the cock out for a
file knowing he would feed it if there was one, but he only fed himself.
Te egg, which I broke getting it out of the nest, is a pale shade of green
th a light brown mottling mostly at the large end.
Next day was cool, 58*F maximum, and very wet, but the parents saw
it that the young bird stayed under the covered section of the flight and
I not get wet. As the weather got worse in the afternoon we shut all
ree birds in the shelter and were able to observe it being fed with
ialworms by both parents. The locusts were too large by this time,

but even so, the adult birds broke them up and swallowed thei
themselves--about eight, (fourth instar), went during the afternoon
The next three days were warm and included a two-hour thunderstorm&amp;apos;
from which all three birds sheltered. The hen was now rebuilding hei
nest and on the 19th July one egg was laid. The male parent was nov
doing most of the feeding and with a second clutch in the offing we dart
not cut down on the mealworms in case they ceased to feed the young birc
which was now flying strongly but as yet unable to feed itself. From the
20th July we stopped shutting the three birds in the shelter at night. Tht
next day there were two eggs and a third on the 23rd July when the her
started incubating. The young bird had grown a lot and was ver)
active. While the hen incubated the male did the feeding until the 28th
July when we noticed she kept coming from the nest to feed the gaping
youngster which the male was now ignoring. It was now time to separatt
the young bird, which we did at 6 p.m. and caged it well away from th&amp;lt;
hearing of its parents. It ate only a few mealworms up to 10 p.m., thre&amp;lt;
from 5.30 a.m. next morning to 10 a.m. and 30 mealworms from 10 a.m
to 1 p.m.. From then on it was no trouble and within two days we had i
eating the usual insectivorous mixture plus eight mealworms three time:
daily. I
On the 4th August an eggshell was found in the flight, the 13th da;
after we thought incubation had started. I checked the nest on the iotl
August and felt one chick and two eggs so it looked as if the other tw(
eggs had been chilled as a result of interrupted incubation. On th&amp;lt;
22nd August the fledgling left the nest, the 19th day after hatching. W&amp;lt;
did not shut the young bird or the parents in the shelter this time ant
noted that it returned to its nest many times and we believe it roostec
there at night with the mother. On the 1st September there were tw(
cold eggs in the nest and the hen commenced incubation on the 3rc
September. We separated the young bird on the 5th September, th&amp;lt;
15th day after leaving the nest. It was feeding itself within two hours
We checked the nest on the 15th September. There were three egg
again. One chick hatched on the 17th September, 15 days after we though
incubation had started. A second chick hatched later possibly next da;
and the pattern of feeding followed as for the previous clutches. Afte
the hot summer we were now in a spell of storms and cold nights witl
night temperatures on occasion as low as 40*F. However two Silve
Birds left the nest during a mild spell on 6th October the 20th day afte
the first chick hatched. It does seem that the extremes of weather mad&amp;lt;
little difference to the incubation periods of 13 to 15 days and in the tirw
to leave the nest, 19 to 21 days. I think supplying locusts gave som&amp;apos;
variety to the live food, mostly mealworms, and helped a lot in rearing
these birds. With the latest two birds we did not shut them in th&amp;lt;
shelter until two days ago (nth October) when cold easterly gales am
heavy rain compelled us to.

The Silver Bird hatched on the 23rd June is now moulting in an indoor
ight in our birdroom. It still has some feathers to come but the spots
ave gone and the underparts are the same deep tawny as its parents.
Iso, like its parents, it is grey above with dark grey primary feathers,
he Silver Bird hatched on the 4th August is now half patchy grey on the
sad and back replacing some of the fawn spots. It is still spotted fawn
sneath but tawny feathers are spreading from the vent area. It is
ins in length. The tail feathers are dull grey and the primaries a dull
irk grey. All four young birds are in fine condition.
Last year we ordered another Silver Bird to try and make up two pairs,
arrived from Kenya about two months ago. We think it is a male and
has been caged with the old 1966 hen ever since. They agree perfectly,
ext year we hope to give her another chance to breed in an aviary with
ir new companion.
As described above, the Silver Bird, Empidornis setnipartitus, has been
ed by Mrs. K. M. Scamell. It is believed this may be a first success.

BREEDING THE RUBY-THROATED OR
SLACK-CRESTED BULBUL, Pycnonotus melanicterus

<bodyText confidence="0.98869352631579" page_id="58078549"  page_num="189" year="" vol="">
By Mrs. K. M. Scamell (St. Keverne, Cornwall, England)
For some years when we lived in Newdigate, Surrey and since in
irnwall, we have kept in our aviaries a few Bulbuls of the species
'conotus melanicterus. Sometimes the birds are advertised for sale by
alers, but generally they have been difficult to purchase in this country,
*me of these Bulbuls have had small raised crests, others have been
istless or almost so. One feature those we have kept had in common,
is a ruby or red coloured throat.
The earliest importation into the U.K. of the Ruby-throated Bulbul
is believed to be in 1904 and the aviculturist who kept them, Reginald
Blips, reports his experiences with the two birds in Avicult. Mag.
17(1908-9) : 215-219 : 236-240. I am also indebted to Dr. Colin
irrison for clarifying the present grouping of the various races of these
ilbuls and I cannot do better than to quote from a recent letter he
it me in reply to my enquiry on the matter:--
" The taxonomy of the bulbul is rather complex. All forms are now
)uped as the species Pyconotus melanicterus , which is given the name
ick-crested Bulbul, probably a better one in view of the variation in
&amp;apos;oat colour. There is a yellow-throated, non-crested form in Ceylon,

and a yellow-throated crested form in Borneo. There is a red-throate
crestless form in South-West India, a red-throated crested form i
Eastern Thailand, and a red-throated orange-breasted form in Jav
(dispar). The remaining forms are black-throated and the crest i
developed to varying degrees. At present 12 races are recognised b
name ".
Our Ruby-throated Bulbuls measure about 7 in. in length. The head
nape and beak are black. The back, wings and tail are dark olive-gree
and the underparts pale yellow. The legs are brownish and the thro#
feathers, some of which tuft or bristle, are a deep red or ruby colou
which fades somewhat in captivity. The iris is yellowish. The ca
sometimes has a single note and at other times a pleasing bubbly one cjj
many notes. There is no territorial song.
We have found them reasonably hardy once established, although i
winter it is essential to provide a minimum temperature of 45*F in th
shelter. Feeding is simple--an insectivorous mixture (we make our owr
into which we grate carrot and apple until it is nicely moistened. W
then add soaked currants, cut-up soaked sultanas and cut-up figs an
grapes. All the fruits are well dusted with Gevral-Protein. Maggoi
are not eaten and at times mealworms are also ignored or just a few takei
We have tried small locusts but these have been left also. During breedin
periods mealworms are sometimes taken in quantity.
We purchased our first pair of Ruby-throated Bulbuls in 1964. Fror
what country any of this species came from we have never been able t
find out. This particular pair were of one of the crested races but
was not until 1966 that they showed any interest in nesting. As this cam
to nothing we moved them to a larger aviary planted with bambo
rhododendrum and privet. It measured 20 ft. in length, 4 ft. in widt
and 6 ft. 6 ins. in height, with a shelter measuring 4 ft. x 2 ft. x 7 ft. hig
and this they had to themselves. In May 1966 they were again see
carrying dried grasses to an open-fronted nest-box placed high up ne;
the roof of the flight and concealed somewhat by privet, On 3rd June
broken egg was found in the shelter and after about 10 days a chec
showed an incomplete nest in the nest-box as in the previous year. A
the nest-box was on the large size we squeezed inside it a part of a disuse
thrush's nest and inside that was placed an old warbler's nest. On t!
25th June two eggs had been laid in this improvised nest. Then followe
normal incubation by, we think, the hen (the sexes are alike). Bot
eggs hatched on 8th or 9th July. We gave mealworms in addition to t!
usual food and the mealworms were seen to be fed by one of the paren
perching on the ledge of the open front. It was easy to shut the paren
in the shelter and check the nest and this we did every other day. TI
weather was very hot. We tried extra fruit such as diced pear. TI
mealworms taken were very few, perhaps 30 per day but much of tl
fruit was taken. We wondered if they were getting other live food sue

as caterpillars as the aviary was on the fringe of our wood. Both young
birds left the nest on the 20th July, the 12th or 13th day after hatching.
The fledglings were very attractive with dull black caps, white gapes,
olive green mantles, and dark olive-green wings, and were creamy under-
neath. They were quite small with tails about 1 in. long. They perched
in the privet and were able to fly short distances only. About 12 meal-
worms were taken that day but the next day over 50 mealworms went.
We had gone through a very warm spell, temperatures being generally in
the high seventies or low eighties F., and the inevitable thunder-
storm broke on the late afternoon of the 22nd July. Searching in the
aviary we found one young bird beaten to the ground and dead. We shut
the survivor and its parents in the shelter. Next morning it seemed
very fit and perched high and as the weather had now cleared up we let
the three birds in the flight but shut them in the shelter for the next two
nights. On the 25th July I didn't like the look of the young bird, it
was very hunched and stayed in the shelter so we shut the parents in with
it. It was not being fed so nothing could be done except to put it into a
hospital cage and try to hand-feed it. However it died in a few hours and
from the colour of its droppings it was apparant that it had enteritis.
The parents soon began nesting again, incubation commencing on the
3rd August and one chick hatching out on the 17th August. Another egg
remained unhatched. Feeding was as before but three days later a dead
chick was seen in the flight. The old nest-box was removed and replaced
by a new and smaller one. The Bulbuls took to this at once, completing
a small cup shaped nest, and were incubating two eggs by the end of the
month. These hatched on the 12th September. Again the food was as
before and the parents birds were both seen feeding. Again the chicks
were thrown out, this time five days after hatching.
The male parent died the following April, but we managed to purchase
another bird (sex unknown) later that year. This bird however, was
crestless and its yellow colouring was paler. Early in 1970 I had the
misfortune to break a bone in my right knee and this resulted in some
stiffness in the joint and made it difficult for me to climb the staircase in
our house so we decided to move to a bungalow in an area where the winters
were milder and the summers not quite so hot. Later that summer we
purchased a property in Cornwall close to the sea. Though we are much
more exposed to winds and storms than we were at Newdigate, our
avairies are all protected from South-Westerly winds by high screens of
evergreens such as Escallonia, Eucalyptus etc.. We moved here in
October 1970 with about 50 softbills and nectivores and with our best
aviaries in sections! It took the next 12 months to erect and plant the
20 aviaries we now have, so 1971 was a blank year for any successful
breedings. The old crested hen died in 1972, but we were fortunate in
obtaining three more of the uncrested form, two from a dealer both
freshly imported) and one from a Zoo (acclimatised). We now had the

possibility of two pairs but it was too late in the summer of 1972 to expect
any nesting in the aviary we gave them, lhis has a flight 12 ft. long
x 3 ft. wide by 6 ft. 6 ins. high and a heated (45*F minimum) shelter
3 ft. x 3 ft. x 7 ft. 6 ins. high at one end. It is planted with a griselinia, a
conifer and furthest from the shelter a Lonicera nitida and a Senecio.
Three of the birds spent the winter in this aviary and all seemed to agree,
at least until the Spring. The fourth looked miserable and was caged in
the birdroom. In the shelter was an open-fronted nest-box and a felt-lined
canary nest-basket, in the flight an open-fronted nest-box. On the
24th April 1973 one of the three Bulbuls was seen in the nest basket and
on checking this I found one egg. A second egg was laid the next day.
Incubation continued until the 5th May when one egg was seen on the
floor. The other egg was in the nest but punctured. The eggs measured
22 mmx 15 mm. They were dark brown at the broad end with an off-
white background flecked brown at the pointed end. By this time we had
removed one of the three Bulbuls as it was being chased from the food
pots. It was placed in a nearby aviary to join No. 4 which had over-
wintered in a cage. In late May one of the first pair was seen carrying
dried grasses to the Lonicera nitida bush which was then about 4 ft- high
and in which was built a very small cup-shaped nest entirely of dried
grasses. Two eggs were laid and as the nest was entirely exposed to all
the elements a sheet of clear corrugated plastic was fitted to the roof
netting frame. Two chicks were hatched on the 14th June and the
incubation period was either 13 or 14 days. We supplied the usual food
plus about 50 mealworms most of which could have been eaten by the
parents. All the mealworms were very lightly coated with vegetable
cooking oil and as lightly dusted with Squibbs " Vionate " a mineral-
vitamin supplement. Within three days we were feeding 100 mealworms
a day. The weather was warm but unsettled on the 19th June when, with
the parents in the shelter, I had a look in the nest. Both chicks were
growing well and were heavily quilled. Another warm spell followed--
where we live the shade temperature so far has not exceeded the low
seventies F., but with the intense sunshine it always seems warmer
than similar shade temperatures in Surrey. By the 23rd June, the 10th
day after hatching, the chicks were almost fledged. Mealworm con-
sumption had dropped from a high of 150 per day to about 100. Early on
the 25th June, the 12th or 13th day after hatching, both fledglings left
the nest. It was raining at 11 a.m. and as we were going out for the day,
we shut the parents in the shelter, caught the young birds and put them
in the shelter also. On our return in the evening they were on a low
perch and from the droppings we were satisfied they were being fed. We
kept the four birds in the shelter until the 29th June. At night all four
would be on the topmost perch, the two young in the middle and one
parent either side, a pretty sight! Other food was now being taken in
addition to about 100 mealworms per day. The young birds differed

from those bred in 1967 from " crested " parents in that their underparts
were whitish and not creamy-yellow. They could fly fairly strongly in
and out of the shelter, but at night we shut the shelter door. They were by
then invariably perched inside close together like peas in a pod. Observa-
tions over a period of an hour on the 3rd July showed that both parents were
still feeding them mostly mealworms. From now on we rationed the
mealworms so that they had none for four or five hours a day. This
pushed up the consumption of the other foods. The white gapes were
disappearing, the birds grew very fast and were almost as large as their
parents by the 9th July. On the 16th July, the 22nd day after they had
left the nest we shut the parents in the shelter and carefully caught the
young birds and caged them some distance away. They were feeding
themselves within two hours, eating all the soaked currants first. Though
they were offered mealworms strangely enough they didn't touch them,
and only after they were moved to an indoor aviary in the birdroom
about two weeks later, did they sometimes steal one from a flycatcher
sharing the same aviary.
The parents took the separation of their youngsters very badly, looked
very miserable for some days and then moulted some of their tail feathers.
We didn't expect that they would nest again this summer but by the middle
af August the hen was incubating two eggs in a new nest about 18 ins.
above the old one and in new growth. It was a few inches from the top of
:he shrub and even more exposed to the weather than the first nest. On
:he 30th August one chick hatched the other egg remaining unhatched.
[ removed this egg in about 10 days. All went well until the 12th
September when the young bird should have left the nest. It seemed
lot quite fledged and slept a lot. We could see it through the netting
rom the path. Its breathing was very rapid and though the parent
irooded the bird almost continuously, mealworm demand had dropped to
/ery little and we formed the opinion the bird had been chilled on the
lest during the night which had been cool. Two days later it was found
n the flight dead. As I mentioned earlier, the nest is a very frail affair
neasuring about 3 J ins. across, 2 ins. in total depth and less than \ in.
hick. Its not lined, just coarse dried grasses. For success it seems it
leeds two chicks in the nest and warm days and nights such as we had in
une and July. The two young birds which are independant have yet to
noult but they have gradually become pale yellow underneath. The ruby
&amp;gt;r red throat is as yet absent though a deeper yellow than the underparts,
rhe second adult " pair " have not nested.
As described above, the Black-crested Bulbul, Pycnonotus melanicterus ,
las been bred by Mrs. K. M. Scamell. It is believed this may be a first
uccess.

(Trachyphonus erythrocephalus)
By M. D. England (Neatishead, Norfolk, England)
The genus Trachyphonus , the so-called " ground barbets ", is confined
to Africa south of the Sahara and consists of five species--D'Arnaud's,
Yellow-breasted, Red and Yellow, Levaillant's and the Yellow-billed--
the last of which is sufficiently different for it to be placed by some
authorities in a genus of its own, Tvcichylacinus. The first three are
birds of dry scrub areas and thorn savannas, while the last two prefer
more wooded country.
The Red and Yellow Barbet lives up to its name and is a brightly-
coloured bird clad mainly in red, yellow and black. The body is basically
yellow, with black mantle and wings which are heavily spotted with
white; it has red cheeks connected by a red band passing over the rear of
the crown, a good deal of red on the upper breast and ventral areas,
white cheek-spots and a tail which is barred black and white. The
feathers of the crown are erectile. The male differs from the female in
being generally brighter in colour and in having a black fore-crown and
throat patches; both have a variable black and white breast-band. The
species is locally resident from Somaliland and Kenya to north-eastern
Tanzania; it is common in some parts of the Northern Frontier province
of Kenya.
My Red and Yellow Barbets were sent to me from Kenya under licence
by Tim Barnley and received at his hands the same meticulous attention
and care in packing as he appears to give to all his birds, with the result
that they arrived in perfect condition. They were placed in a section of
birdroom about 6 ft x 5 ft. by 8 ft. high, with access to a 20 ft. flight.
Because of very poor April weather they were kept inside for the first
week or so, but seemed so fit that they were soon allowed into the flight.
A nest-box ioins. x ioins. x 7 ins. was provided and they immediately took
to roosting in it. From the start they returned to the shelter each night
of their own accord and needed none of the wearisome chasing indoors
which so many birds require. On the other hand they rarely go inside
during the day except to feed, however bad the weather.
I have never known birds to thrive on so little food. They were offered
mealworms, maggots, locusts, soft food, and fruit of many kinds, with
occasional grated cheese and egg-yolk. At first everything was ignored
except mealworms, but they settled down to a diet of a few of these,
a fastidious peck at the soft food and diced fruit, with one or two maggots
when they had finished their mealworms. Of course they are never
denied food, but they appear to need incredibly little.
These birds are well-known as duettists, and almost immediately after
arrival they started their interesting and amusing performance of sitting

lost of the time they face each other, but as the paroxism proceeds they
&amp;gt;tate their heads to and fro, looking remarkably like the mechanical
nging bird which provides the " signature tune " to the television
rogramme " Going for a Song This song is subject to considerable
triation, since it is sometimes performed by a party of birds in chorus
id the duet sung by one pair of birds may be very different from that of
lother pair. The song of my pair, for example, is quite unlike that of
ie pair which may be seen and heard in Alan Roots' magnificent film
The Baobab Tree ".
They pose an avicultural problem since they are normally bank-nesters,
iring a hole in earth or sand or termite-nest, like a kingfisher, and the
irticular aviary in which they were housed was quite unsuitable for the
lilding of artificial banks such as are provided at, for example, " Winged
r orld ". As a substitute a bale of tightly compressed peat was set up
ith a tunnel and partially-excavated nest-chamber. To prevent the
of falling in, an upper lining of black plastazote was fitted. In case this
as not to their liking, five different types of nest-box were hung in various
&amp;gt;sitions; two were given a cursory inspection, but otherwise all were
nored.
Their song continued for the rest of the year and through the winter
it in early spring was performed less and less enthusiastically and very
frequently. It was noticeable too that no longer did they perch side by
le but one would sing in the flight and be answered by the other in the
elter. They seemed to be losing interest in each other and certainly
owed no inclination to breed.
About mid-March the song ceased altogether, which made it all the
ore surprising to see, on the last day of March, the male pecking the
nale's head, then strutting in front of her, head and tail raised, and
:empting to mate with her. However, it seemed to be a solitary effort
d they settled down once more to ignoring each other, one sitting in the
?ht, the other remaining in the shelter.
On 7th April I was amazed to see the female leave one of the nest-boxes
the shelter, whereupon the male immediately flew up and took her
ice inside. He remained there for as long as it took me to feed the
:ds in all the sections of the bird-room and it was obvious that their
parent indifference was a cloak for serious nesting operations.
Both birds incubated the eggs, the male taking a major share during the
ytime. Since I am not sure when it started, I do not know the length
the incubation time, but by 17th April the nest undoubtedly contained

food carried in the bill. Mealworms were taken whole but mandibulate
to soften them; small locusts had all legs removed and full-grown one
had their wings torn off before being given to the young. The method c
doing this was interesting and similar to that adopted by hoopoes an
some other birds; the locust was taken down to the ground, seized by th
leg or wing and violently shaken until the body came off, sometimes bein
thrown right across the shelter with the effort. It would then be graspe
by another leg or wing and the process repeated until the body wd
devoid of appendages, when it was held longitudinally in the bill am
carried to the nest in that position. On the other hand, mealworms wei
held transversely.
By 7th April a youngster was looking out of the hole and two da)
later it was out, to be followed by the second (there were only two) i
another couple of days. They were immediately sexable as male anj
female, being smaller and slightly paler editions of their parents, or.
having the male's characteristic black crown and throat marks.
Both parents continued to feed them well, at first on the ground an
later when they perched. Curiously enough, although they ate then
the young were not very keen on the locusts which their parents alwa\
chose to offer them when they were available; the youngsters obvious
preferred mealworms to everything else. The first out did very well fi
a week, when it began to decline and eventually succumbed at five or s
weeks old. The young male rapidly became self-supporting and had
be removed to another aviary when his parents showed signs of startir
another nest.
To make the record more complete it should be added that, prior
their second brood, a great deal more courtship was seen. The ma
frequently fed his mate, sometimes stealing a locust which she w
preparing to eat in order to offer it to her. There was much head-peckir
as they perched side by side, although again their duetting cease

As its English names suggest, Streptopelia tranquebarica is a member of
le large group of " ring-necked " doves of which the domesticated
arbary Streptopelia roseogrisea and Collared dove, Streptopelia decaocta ,
e well known examples. It is however much smaller than either of
tese, being only about nine inches long and is probably unique in the
oup in having a well-marked colour difference between cock and hen.
Cocks have an ash-grey head down to a black collar round the hind
3ck. The rest of the upper plumage is wine-red except for a dark grey
itch at the base of the tail. Wings and central tail feathers are brownish
it the three outer pairs of tail feathers are black at the base and white at
Le ends. The lower parts are mainly wine-red. Hens are brown-grey
ith a black collar similar to that of the cock. Young when they leave the
jst are uniformly brown without a black collar but this soon starts to
&amp;gt;pear. Cocks moult into red plumage in the autumn or winter of the
:ar in which they are hatched, i.e. the first moult, the exact time depen-
ng on whether they are early or late hatched. If young cocks are
*amined in early autumn a few red feathers may be apparent.
According to Whistler (194 1 ) the bird has a wide distribution throughout
da and parts of China to the Philippines and there are three recognized
ces of which the one from Assam and Burma is most richly coloured,
y original stock probably came from India but more recently I bought a
ir in which the hen was distinctly darker. The cock with which she
rived was certainly of excellent colour but this does vary between
dividuals and according to age in my home-bred birds. However these
ay well have been the Burmese race.
The Red Turtle Dove has been known to Aviculture for a good many
ars and a Miss Rosie Alderson (1913) who was an enthusiastic and
ccessful dove-keeper wrote a laudatory account of " this beautiful little

other common doves of India occurring usually in single pairs, awa
from villages but in all sorts of country except extreme desert and heav
forest. Occasionally large flocks occur and these may consist of all male;
Importation into Britain is sporadic. I remember seeing what wer
described as " Burmese Red Doves " advertised in Cage-Birds soon aftej
the war when importation was just being resumed and I was thinkin
about resuming bird-keeping, but it was not till later that I bought foil
pairs (probably from India) as a breeding nucleus. There were the usu^
troubles with imported birds. All four cocks died from ornithosis, or|
hen succumbed to some other cause and as no more imports appeared
was left for a year or two with three widows. However I was eventual!
able to exchange one hen for a cock and to buy another. These birc
provided the nucleus for a stock which, while fluctuating widely over ttj
years, has with one infusion of fresh blood survived to the present da;
As has been indicated the species has the outstanding merit of beir
readily sexed on colour. Old hens tend to look pinker than is typica
particularly on the breast, and some cocks are less red than others but tf
distinction is usually very clear. In captivity flocks of mixed sex can t
kept together outside the breeding season but when breeding, as with mo
doves and indeed with most birds, they do best as isolated pairs. I have hs
limited breeding success with a small flock (three or four hens with rath*
more cocks) in a shed and attached flight with a total floor area of aboi
twenty-four square metres but the occasional bird is liable to be persecutej:
In a confined space unacceptable persecution may take place. I ha^
recently had two pairs breeding very successfully in a total floor space -
ten square metres but one pair established territory outside and the oth
inside the shelter. There was no evidence of persistent fighting. Your
birds were tolerated, but were removed within two or three weeks
leaving the nest.
Red Doves build for preference in an open site although I have hi
them nest in a covered box. The nest is initially of the classic do
type--two crossed sticks on which the eggs are balanced. I usually t
to persuade them to nest on a piece of half-inch wire mesh or to repla
the nest they build with one of netting. With luck, however, the bin
nest more than once and the nest may be used again and become mo
substantial as the season progresses, partly as the result of the accumul
tion of droppings.
The normal clutch is two eggs. Whistler ( loc . cit.) says that thr
may occur. I once fostered a spare egg to make a clutch of three all
which hatched, but one young bird died after a few days. Young dov
normally orientate themselves in the nest in head-to-tail fashion and wh&amp;lt;
three were present there were clearly complications, and, it seemed to n,
unusual activity while they tried to arrange themselves suitably. Barba
Doves are capable of hatching and rearing Red Doves in spite of the latt
being so much smaller, but in my limited experience there is a hij

jrcentage of failure.
The incubation period is about thirteen days and the young grow very
pidl) , particularly, so it appears, for the first week. At about ten days
iere is a tendency for babies to hop out of the nest. This should be
r oided if possible by leaving them strictly alone. If a bird should leave
this stage, or even wander a little from the nest platform it will probably
)t be brooded and will die unless put back. Brooding is shared between
&amp;gt;ck and hen in usual pigeon fashion, the hen taking the night shift,
aung leave the nest at about fifteen days after hatching and are self-
pporting soon afterwards. My records on this are not exact. Birds
&amp;gt; not interfere with rings put on after fledging.
A pair that starts breeding in May, which seems to be the norm in
uthern England may well rear three broods in the season but there are
course plenty of opportunities for accidents. Birds live and continue
eeding for a number of years and a three or four year old hen is probably
better breeding proposition than a first year one.
My birds have unheated sheds to roost in and appear to be completely
nter-hardy. Feeding is easy. They seem to accept most grains up to
e size of the components of "mixed chicken corn" i.e. a mixture of
leat, cracked maize, oats and barley, the two former being much
eferred. A commercial " canary mixture " is much enjoyed. Clearly
real mixtures may prove inadequate for breeding although doves seem
;s susceptible to the deleterious effects of low protein than some species,
feed turkey starter crumbs with the cereal mixture and sometimes
ead and milk and hard boiled egg but it is difficult to say how much
ey take.
To me S. tranquebarica is a very delightful bird and a very satisfactory
iary subject. A drawback, which has been more apparent to others who
ve kept the species than to myself is its typical dove-like tendency to
nic when disturbed. Birds in a confined space may fly directly at the
&amp;gt;turber and escapes can occur. In a larger area they may hit the end
the flight uncomfortably hard and damaged heads and wings result.
)wever, if treated gently in quarters to which they are accustomed their
rvousness can be overcome.
The need to establish in captivity and regularly to breed foreign birds
order to avoid dependence on continual importation is a fashionable
ctrine with unfortunately more advocates than exponents.
The Red Dove seems to be a very suitable subject for ultimate domestica-
*n.

By A. J. Mobbs (Walsall, Staffordshire, England)
Although I am unaware of any hummingbird species which indulge i
mutual preening, after studying these birds for a number of years, I hav
learnt it is unwise to generalize with this family, as the Trochilidae are s
diverse, there is almost sure to be a species which will prove any generalize
tion to be incorrect.
It is safe to assume the majority of hummingbirds do not indulge i
mutual preening, and because of this have evolved highly develope!
scratching and preening postures. To the casual observer, the minut
legs and feet (of most species) would appear to be of little use other tha
for gripping a perch. However, if one is prepared to study these birc
more closely, it will be seen how well adapted for preening the feet ha\
become.
As with most birds which do not (or are unable due to being house
alone) indulge in mutual preening, the hummingbirds preen the hea(
neck, chin and upper throat with their claws. Long billed species pred
certain other parts of the body also in this way.
The Swordbilled Hummingbird (Ensifera ensifera ), due to the extreir
length of beak, is unable to reach any part of its anatomy other than tt
wings and tail, and even these feathers can only be run through the cent]
of the beak as a whole, not individually as with other hummingbird
Because of the length of beak and the problems entailed, the legs and fe*
of the Swordbilled have extra manoeuvrability, thus enabling the speck
to preen areas it could not otherwise reach.
It is quite an experience to watch a Swordbilled bathe and preen ar
the first time I witnessed such an occurrence, I was amazed as to how we
the bird's legs and feet are adapted for such work. As far as I am awar
no other species of hummingbird is able to preen the centre of the ba(
or vent feathers with its claws as the Swordbilled does.
A friend informed me that a Swordbilled owned by him was seen i
preen the primaries also with its claws. Certain hermits (Phaethon
and Glaucis) will preen their wing coverts with their claws, but I have y
to witness a hummingbird preening its primaries in this way.
Several other species, due to the length of beak, have to use their cla\
a great deal. Many of the hermits (both Phaethornis and Glands) can 1
seen to scratch-preen regularly; in fact, a female Long-tailed Hern
( P . superdliosus) in my collection often scratch-preens areas which can 1
reached just as easily with the beak.
It is often stated that in common with most other birds, the hummin
birds bring the foot up and over the wing when scratching. As with me

neralizations appertaining to this family, this one is incorrect. I will
ree it is more usual for most hummingbirds species to bring the foot up
d over the wing. However in many long-billed species the foot is brought
) and under as often as it is brought up and over.
Due to the way in which they are constructed, many hummingbirds
sume most exaggerated preening postures. The neck appears to be
ceptionally flexible and when certain species preen the wing butts or
e upper (and lower, according to the length of beak) breast, the neck
ay be stretched to three or four times its usual length. The neck is also

*etched during certain scratching postures and I have a number of
3 st amusing colour transparencies showing a female Blue-fronted
mcebill (Doryfera johannae ), with the neck stretched out of all proportion
lile scratch-preening the lower hind neck.

&amp;apos;d preens. Another species which has an extremely specialized beak
the Sicklebill (Eutoxeres). This species, however, appears to find little
Acuity when preening, in fact the beak proves to be an ideal tool for
ch work, and it is only the head, hind neck, chin and upper throat which
s to be scratch-preened. Due to the extreme curvature of the beak,
2 Sicklebill does not have to assume exaggerated postures when preening
3 lower throat and upper breast.

I believe it is possible to place certain scratching and preening attitudes
o categories. First there is the posture taken up by a hummingbird
Lich is scratching due to irritation. Under these circumstances the
:ions although deliberate are usually rapid, the foot being moved
tremely quickly. If the irritation is about the head, the bird will while
atching move the head into different positions, thus enabling a larger
'a to be covered with the minimum of effort. I have noticed that this
m of scratching is quickly over and it appears once the irritation has
;ed, the bird wil cease to scratch.
When scratch-preening, the foot is moved in a more leisurely manner
i the bird gives the impression of actually combing the feathers with the
ws. Also during scratch-preening the bird's body will often move in
ison with the action of the foot; especially when it is the neck feathers
ich are being preened. It is a most amusing sight to see a number of
mmers sitting on the same perch all scratch-preening, as if the perch is a
)ple one, the movement of the birds sets it in motion until eventually
:h a momentum is reached, the birds find difficulty gripping the perch.
Scratching and scratch-preening is often carried out on the wing and
tain hummingbird species appear to prefer to scratch and/or preen
ile on the wing rather than when perched, even though such an activity
)ears extremely difficult to human eyes. With irritation scratching, it is
lally the head or beak which is attended to, and a male White-bellied
)odstar (Acestrura mulsani ) in my collection, will purposely leave the
*ch to scratch its head and/or beak.

202 A. J. MOBBS--SCRATCHING AND PREENING POSTURES IN HUMMINGBIRD
When scratch-preening on the wing, it is usually the breast or abdome
which is attended to, although I have on occasions witnessed humming
birds scratch-preening the hind neck also. To do this, the foot is usuall
brought up and over the wing; no mean feat when the bird remain
airborne the whole time.
Finally I would like to mention displacement preening in hummingbird*
This occurs when a bird has experienced stress for some reason, and i
most prevalent directly after fighting has occurred. It can also occu
directly after a bird has been forced to leave a favourite perch--either b
another bird or by a human. I have also witnessed displacement preenin
by a bird which has acted in a way which in human terms would b
considered foolish: i.e. miscalculated when alighting on a perch.
Displacement preening appears to be carried out by the claws (even i
short-billed species), and as with irritation scratching, is carried out in
rapid manner. However, an aviculturist who has witnessed this activit
a number of times should be able to distinguish it from irritation scratchin
or scratch-preening as the bird's movements will be more jerky and th
head in particular will be moved more sharply.
I have witnessed displacement activity in certain species yet rarely
ever in others. Pufflegged (Eriocnemis) and Sunangels ( Heliangelus ) appei
to indulge in this activity more than most, probably because of the
extremely aggressive nature. The Rufous-breasted Hermit (G. hirsuta
also reverts to this activity regularly.
It appears as well as certain species indulging in displacement preenin
more than others, individuals from these species may acquire mannerisn
peculiar to themselves, but not necessarily to the species as a who!
For example the male Rufous-breasted Hermit in my collection scratch
the lower hind neck--usually after showing aggression to other speck
with which it is housed. When perched this hermit brings the foot u
and over the wing or up and under, but when the displacement scratchin
is carried out on the wing (which is often) the foot is always brought n
and under.
The male Tourmaline Sunangel ( H . exortis ) in my collection, als
scratches the lower hind neck; this bird always brings the foot up an
over the wing. The Sapphire-vented Puffleg ( E . lucicmi ), although not;
consistent as the two previously mentioned species, does scratch the hir
neck, but will also scratch the crown during displacement activity.
Displacement scratching and/or preening is known in many oth
families of birds and I have witnessed the activity in numerous parrot-lil
species, also in domestic pigeons.

By Karl-L. Schuchmann (Zoologisches Institut, Frankfurt, Germany)
During a research study at San Pedro, California, on certain ethological
aspects of North American Hummingbirds, I was, with the assistance of
S. Wells and G. Nixon, able to trap a young albino Black-chinned
Hummingbird, Archilochus alexandri.
During the early part of July 1972, approximately 15 female A. alexandri ,
were seen to be brooding, or showing signs of nesting, in the restricted
area of Averill Park, San Pedro. The nesting sites were close to a small
lake and many of the nests were directly above the water. The breeding
birds preferred the shrubs of Senecio petasites --a plant belonging to the
sunflower family-- and lower parts of certain willow species.
I first saw the albino Black-chinned in the lower pait of an elm tree at
a height of about three metres. I had been informed by other observers
that the bird had left the nest three days before. Up to this date, the
mother bird had fed the young albino regularly every ten minutes or so.
There had been two youngsters--the other being a normal coloured
bird--but 24 hours after leaving the nest, this bird was not seen again.
As well as feeding the young albino, the mother hummingbird collected
nesting material (hair, spiders' webs and for the external decoration
dead cactus cells), and proceeded to build a second nest in an elm some
two metres from the previous nest, in which the albino had been raised.
The female Black-chinned laid her first egg the same day as the second
nest was completed; two days later, the second egg was laid. By this time
the young albino had left the nest six days.
The albino had remained in the same elm since leaving the nest. As
the mother bird was now sitting, she was unable to feed the young bird
regularly and because of this, the latter was heard to call for food more
persistently. The call was made up of a high pitched ziip. Sometimes
:he call would be answered by the mother bird and she would then leave
:he nest and feed the youngster. However, it was noticeable that as time
progressed, the begging behaviour of the young albino became less
successful.
Other hummingbirds (mainly immature A. alexandri and Selasphorus s.
min) were seen to attack the young albino; these attacks were usually
warded off by the mother bird.
Seven days after leaving the nest, the albino was caught with a butterfly
let. Permission for this was granted by the United States Department
if the Interior Wildlife Service.
From the time of fledging, the albino had been most lethargic and was
lot seen to inspect leaves or flower buds; an activity observed in other
lummingbirds of the same age. Before the bird was collected, it was

Distributed in various subspecies over the southern third of Africa, our
three specimens (&amp;lt;jYen?) came from the vicinity of Luanda in Angola on
the 20th May 1971. They appear to be the nominate form Pternistes a.
afer , Muller 1776.
Description
About the size of a Partridge with the spurred male being noticeably
larger than the female, they have the forehead, eyebrow and moustachia
stripe white, top of the head brown, neck speckled black and white and
the remainder of the upper parts earth-brown with darker shaft stripes.
Underparts are broadly streaked with black and white (black shaft stripes
with white edges) legs, bill, facial skin and throat wattle coral red. The
sound most commonly heard from our birds is a loud " crowing cackle ",
on a descending scale, usually heard early morning and late afternoon.
They are reputed to make " Kek Kek Kek " call in flight, and give their
alarm call when perched in trees.
Accommodation and Diet
After quarantine the birds were released into a small aviary approxi-
mately 4 ft. x 10 ft. x 7 ft. high, with a shelter 3 ft. deep at the rear. The

floor is covered with a deep layer of sand and planted out with Lonicera
mtida and Rtbes sanguineum. A rear corner was made private with grass
tussocks and clumps of dried bamboo leaves. It was in this corner that
a scrape was made and all the eggs were laid. The birds had a constant
supply of layers pellets and mixed canary seed. In addition, they
received between 20 and 30 mealworms daily and a regular supply of
fresh turves which they enjoyed shredding.

<bodyText confidence="0.996445542857143" page_id="58078571"  page_num="205" year="" vol="">
For convenience the birds were kept as a trio, though almost certainly
only one hen was mated with, and certainly only one was favoured, being
called to mealworms and other choice titbits by the male. If the other
female approached she was given a sharp peck and swiftly chased away,
although not pursued. The greater part of their day seemed to be spent
skulking amongst the small shrubs of their aviary, the male being particu-
larly lethargic. Great interest was taken in the fresh turves which they
regularly received, the presence of the odd female being tolerated at the
investigation. Dust-bathing was also taken part in regularly and
vigorously, the birds resting periodically during their exertions. The
only form of courtship observed was after the supply of mealworms or
turves, when the male called to the female with his neck stretched up and
forward, all plumage apart from the flank feathers which were fluffed out
was sleeked, and he adopted a peculiar high stepping gait around the
apparently disinterested, feeding female. The stretched neck of course
showed off the naked red throat patch very clearly and the stripes of the
underparts were shown to advantage by the upward stretching of the bird.
Mating was never observed. The first egg was laid on the 25th January
1972, eight months after the birds' arrival; this, however, was broken.
The first clutch of five eggs was started on the 19th March 1972, eggs
being laid on alternate days. A sixth egg was laid on the 4th April. Of
these two were infertile and four were dead in shell. The size of the eggs
varied from 31-34 x 38-40 mm and possessed remarkably thick shells.
They were a uniform light brown colour and heavily pitted--each pit
showing as a white speckle. Egg production started again on the 7th
December 1972 continuing very erratically throughout the first four
nonths of 1973. Forty-four eggs in all were produced of which four
)nly hatched on the 21st May after an incubation period of 23 days.
Df the remainder six were dead in shell, three were broken and the others
were infertile.
?,hick Development
On hatching the chicks' down pattern was as follows: a mid-brown
stripe bordered by darker brown extended over the crown to the nape.
The back was mid-brown bordered by darker brown next to a buff stripe,
&amp;apos; dark stripe separating this from the buff undersides. The face and

OBSERVATIONS ON THE BEHAVIOUR AND
BREEDING OF THE SAFFRON FINCH
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9700291" page_id="58078573"  page_num="207" year="" vol="">
(Sicalis flaveola)
By C. J. O. Harrison (Berkhamsted, Herts, England)
In the early spring of 1973 I received three South American birds of the
genus Sicalis from Robin Restall in Spain. From their behaviour I
suspected that they were two males and a female but there was some doubt
about their specific identity. An examination of museum skins showed
that they must be Saffron Finches, Sicalis luteola. This species had been
bred fairly frequently in captivity but, like many other South American
species, its behaviour and life-history are very poorly documented and
the present account seemed justified.
Plumage
The adults of the species are distinctive enough. The male is green
above with faint darker streaking on the lower back and dark inner webs
on tail and wing feathers; yellow on head and underside; with saffron-
orange on lores, forehead and forecrown forming a distinctive patch.
The amount of green tint in the yellow on the underside, head and mantle
seems to vary with age. The male described here, newly moulted from
immature plumage, showed a distinct green tint over much of this plumage.
The female is olive-green dorsally, with dark streaking on mantle and
back, and small fine streaks over the head. Wings and tail are dark with
of greenish-yellow feather edges. Lores, throat and underside are yellow
and the area around the eye is an unmarked yellowish-green. There may
be a faint orange tint on the forehead.
The identification problem arose because the birds sent, although
behaving like adults, were in immature plumage. This is greyish-white
on throat and underside, save for the upper breast which has a broad band
greenish-yellow, the latter continuing as a narrow strip across the upper
mantle. The head is grey, slightly tinted buff and with fine dark streaking
over the top and nape. The mantle and back are streaked dark brown
and tinted yellowish-green, deepest on the rump. Wings and tail are

dark, edged with greenish-yellow like those of the female. The under
tail coverts are yellow. The bill of adults is a light buff colour. In
the young it is blackish at first, but the lower mandible becomes pale, and
is conspicuous in " bill-up " displays.,
In this plumage the birds were singing advertisement song and
quarrelling, and one received like this was still in immature plumage six
months later. The period for which this plumage is retained, and its
relationship to the breeding cycle does not seem to have been investigated.
General Behaviour
The Saffron Finch is a typical seed-eating bunting, appearing rather
heavilv-built and short-necked, and having a short blunt bill. It perches
when resting but feeds extensively on the ground, walking with a steady,
lark-like stride, and occasionally running. On a perch it will sidle rather
than hop. It can cling to a vertical perch and lean out to reach seed-heads.
It is capable of making brief, flycatcher-like flights from a perch after
small flies. It bathes avidly.
Saffron Finches are aggressive and quarrelsome, both among themselves
and with other birds, tending to dominate those placed in aviaries with
them. This makes them difficult for mixed aviaries and this, together
with their loud and rather monotonous song, probably prejudices avi-
culturists against them.
Food
I can say little concerning food, since the birds were housed with some
Painted Quail and for much of the time also with a pair of Spanish
Sparrows also present. An aviary seed mixture was offered and maggots
and grated cheese were also put into the aviary. The last two regularly
disappeared but I could not be sure if the Saffron Finches took any. They
certainly took unripe seeds of grasses and herbaceous plants, and small
insects, especially when there were young in the nest, but were not seen
to take maggots or mealworms until the young of later broods were in the
nest.
Voice
The normal flight call is a " chep " note, sparrow-like but a little more
melodious. Birds settling near each other may squabble with a harsher
" chuc-chuc-chuc " chattering note, usually accompanied to some extent
by the " bill-up " display. A subdued " hueet " call was heard at times
from the male, usually when the female was on the nest, and from its
context it appeared to indicate slight anxiety. The alarm call, frequently
heard, is a short, high-pitched and thin " stit ".
Advertisement song is usually uttered from a high and conspicuous
song-perch. Although in brief moments of song during other activities
only four or five notes may be uttered in a phrase, during more sustained
</bodyText>

outbursts the phrases consists of eight to twenty notes. The notes
resemble the high-pitched calls made by House Sparrows during their
more excited moments when fighting, but are a little more melodious.
In a typical phrase the first four to seven notes are loud, sharp and incisive,
and are uttered separately as a series of independent notes with apparently
random variation in pitch. The remainder of the phrase is similar but
the notes are more hurried, less sharp, and sometimes two or three are
run together. As a song it is monotonous and the cumulative effect is not
melodious.
There are usually periods of sustained song, one long phrase following
another in rapid succession, after dawn and just before sunset. The early
morning song period may be very long. The period at dusk may be
shorter, about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, but is of very regular
occurrence, even in cold and wet weather. During the breeding period
there are intermittent outbursts at other times of day and short phrases
may occur at any time.
In addition the male also has a subdued song. This is a quieter,
sustained warbling of a much more musical type. It is uttered as a
continuous flow of soft and melodious but slightly wheezy notes, and may
include intermittent low, grating notes. It appears usually to be sung
in the presence of the female, and on the only occasion on which an
apparent courtship display occurred it was accompanied by this song.
The call of young in the nest is a soft wheezy " tzee-tzee and on
:heir emergence this changes to a loud " zwit, zwit-it ", harsh, nasal and
af moderate pitch, lower than the call of the nestlings.

Postures and Displays
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9995325" page_id="58078575"  page_num="209" year="" vol="">
In general the green and yellow colouring of the adult birds is less
;onspicuous than might be expected, but the orange forehead of the male
appears to have a strong signal function. During advertisement song the
lead is frequently moved from side to side and up and down as the
lisjointed notes are uttered, and the frequent sharp movement of this
;mall patch of colour is conspicuous from a distance.
A possible epigamic display was witnessed only once and not clearly
ieen. The male was feeding on the ground near the female. A more
rigorous burst of the subdued song was heard and the male was briefly
glimpsed running towards the female, rather upright, the feathers of head
tnd neck appearing fluffed so that the orange and yellow colour was very
:onspicuous. The wings appeared to be drooped and the tail cocked
harply upwards.
The aggressive nature of this species has already been mentioned.
Reaction to other species such as the sparrows was a simple forward
hreat with open bill. Towards conspecifics the " bill-up " threat posture
vas frequently used. One bird would settle near another, in a rather
ipright posture either facing the other bird or laterally aligned to it, and

throw back the head with a quick movement so that the bill pointed
straight upwards. Both birds may adopt this posture and one may make
a threatening move towards the other, but in general dominance appears
to be established without open conflict.
In the male the colouring of the forepart of the head which moves
most conspicuously during this display is yellow, with the orange forehead
region. In the female throat, lores and around the eyes are unmarked
yellow. In the young the throat is white, and the pale huffish lower
mandible is more conspicuous during the movement.
Breeding
When received, in late February, the birds were put into an aviary
consisting of a part of a greenhouse 2 ft. 6 in. x 4 ft. x 7 ft. high, set in the
angle of a wall with the top partly shaded, and opening through a large
aperture into a planted flight on a slope, about 13 ft. x 3 ft. and tapering
in height from 8 ft. to 5 ft. Two birds were in immature plumage and the
female had mostly moulted into first adult plumage. It was thought that
both immature birds sang from high perches in the flight. One was
scruffier, having lost many feathers on head and body, and the other was
dominant.
During the next two months the first moulted into adult plumage and
became the dominant bird, supplanting the other. The female was seen
occasionally carrying small twigs. According to the rather sparse litera-
ture the natural nests are in cavities. Rolls of wire-netting with long,
dead grasses woven into them were put up in the shelter, but the grasses
were pulled out and the site ignored. Boxes placed in the shelter also
aroused no obvious interest.
In early May a cardboard box with one end partly removed was fixed
at the end of a perch in the flight, under a section sheltered by a polythene
sheet. The adult-plumaged male sang perched by this box and the female
was seen to enter carrying grass blades. Since the Spanish Sparrows
were still present a nest was provided for them. This was a section ol
silver birch log, about 10 in. long by 6 in. external diameter with walls
about J in. thick. It had been a tit nest-box and the usual round hole
near the top was enlarged up to the lid and the whole turned on one
side to provide a horizontal cavity with a slit-like entrance on the side at
one end. This was hung in an exposed position, on the wire side of the
flight, near the door and furthest from the shelter. The Saffron Finches
immediately transferred their attention to this. The male sang on top
of it or from a nearby perch, and chased off everything else. The Spanish
Sparrows went to Herbert Murray who already had a displaying male,
and the extra Saffron Finch, who was losing feathers in aggressive
encounters and tending to hide, was offered temporary asylum by Leslie
Ranee.
The singing male finch was seen to pick up fragments of nest material

md hold them once or twice, and in the early stages of nest building was
;een to carry material about, but it is not certain that he played any
significant part in nest-building. This was done by the female, rather
urtively, and a nest became partly visible within the box, at the end furthest
rom the entrance. An examination later showed it to be a shallow cup
)f dead leaves and stems and dried grass, lined with finer grasses and
eathers. It was so far in that nothing could be seen but by 24th May
here were eggs in the nest, the nearest just touchable with a finger-tip.
Dn the Spring Bank Holiday of 26th-28th I was able to observe the female
md saw her enter the nest once or twice, but no evidence of brooding.
Vs always the birds were nervous, the thin " tsit " note being constantly
leard, but they seemed tamer than previously.
On 7th June when I could feel a young one I realised that each time I or
1 neighbour appeared in our gardens the male gave the alarm note and the
emale immediately slipped off the nest and joined him. In view of the
imount of time she must have been off the nest it was fortunate that we
vere enjoying an exceptionally prolonged period of fine hot weather,
ncubation must presumably have begun about 24th May. They were
nore tolerant of birds than humans, for the perch by the nest extended
nto an adjacent compartment with an Azure-winged Magpie in it, and the
onstant flights of the latter jogged the nest a little with each movement,
ncubation, like building, appeared to be by the female alone.
\\ ith the hatching of the young the adults began systematically
earching the vegetation of the flight for small insects, but showed little
nterest in small blowfly maggots when these were offered, although larger
naggots were utilized later in the season when the third brood were in the
test. Both adults fed the young. I threw quantities of seeding Forget-
ne-not weeds infested with aphis into the flight and these were quickly
nvesiigated. The young continued to survive, although as in incubation
he female left the nest when people were present and showed reluctance
0 enter with food.
When the young were about six days old I opened the box and pulled
ne out. It was virtually naked, dull purplish-pink in colour, with a
ew tiny sparse down tufts on mid-back, one or two on the wings, and a
ew on the crown of the head. The gape flanges were very pale yellow,
he mouth orange. An egg had rolled to the wrong end of the box and
/as not incubated. It was typical of the species, pale pinkish white,
ut heavily marked with large spots and specks in dark purplish-brown,
iding much of the ground colour and forming a dense cap at the larger
nd. There were two young.
On the morning of 22nd the first young one emerged onto the perch by
ae nest where it sat until late afternoon. Its first flight was quite strong,
nd it kept to the higher perches. The parents kept up a barrage of alarm
alls and when the Azure-winged Magpie in the next aviary showed
iterest they both flew at it and landed on the wire near it in a manner

suggesting intention of attack. The second youngster emerged next
morning and also spent some hours on the perch before moving.
The harsh begging call of the young was heard fairly infrequently.
Within two days the hen anxiously inspected the nest-box after I had
examined it, and two days after that began to lay, three more eggs being
in the box by 29th June, and the last presumably laid on 30th Junej
The hen showed similar behaviour to her previous incubation although
once or twice, on suddenly emerging from the house, I saw her slip out
of the nest. The young were fed mainly, perhaps entirely, by the male
now. At seven days I saw him occasionally repulse a food-begging
youngster, and by ten days they appeared to be feeding themselves,
although food-begging could be heard for up to a fortnight.
The second brood had hatched by the evening of 13th July. The parents
were again eager for any insects. On this occasion I had some mealworms,
and these were taken when offered. As on the previous occasion during
the nestling period the adults were seen taking unripe seeds from grasses
and weeds in the flight as well as insects. The young of this brood
emerged on 29th July, behaving in similar fashion to the first brood.
Four young emerged and fledged. The male chased young of the first
brood away from the nest-box both during and after occupation by the
second brood, but otherwise there was no aggressive interaction with
them.
Three days after the second brood emerged the nest had been partly
rebuilt, the walls being raised and the cup deepened. The first egg of a
third brood was laid on 7th August, young were hatched by 24th, and
emerged on 7th September. Five eggs were laid in this instance, and
four young hatched and fledged. The weather having turned coolei
the nest-box was removed.
Clutches laid were therefore of 3, 4 and 5 eggs; and young hatched and
fledged were 2, 4 and 4. Intervals between young leaving nest and the
next egg were 4 and 9 days. In the latter stages of the last brood the
broken end of the box by the entrance hole fell away and it was possible
to see the interior. Throughout the whole period there was complete
nest sanitation by the adults both within the nest and the box, and there
was no evidence at any time of faeces within the cavity, or immediatel)
below the entrance where they would have fallen if voided at the entrance
During the period that the third brood were being raised there was some
evidence of occasional noisy calling suggestive of song from some of the
earlier young. Also during this period the third adult, which had
originally been suspected to be a male, and which was being kept elsewherf
with some Zebra Finches, indicated its true sex by laying an egg, similai
to that of the breeding female but more sparsely marked.
The present data suggest an incubation period of about 13 days, and #
fledging period of 15-16 days, followed by about 10 days dependence or
the adults. The fledging period seems a little long. It is a difficulj

actor to calculate in an aviary breeding since the ease with which the
dult can find food and rapidfy bring it to the nest may decrease the
ikelihood that hunger and desire to follow the adult in search of food
night help to trigger off the initial departure. From about io days

orner of the nest and box, the front ones rearing up in the nest to do so.

iOt appear at the entrance to the box during the days immediately prior
o departure as do more typical cavity-nesting birds, and the tendency to
merge onto a nearby perch and to sit there quietly for a long period
&amp;apos;efore attempting to move may be correlated with a need for the emerging
oungster to become accustomed to entirely strange surroundings.
Although the period of dependence on the adults seems short, after the
ist brood emerged and (the nest-box having been removed) the female
/as present with the young, the food-begging call was heard at intervals
or almost four weeks, although this does not necessarily imply that feeding
ccurred. It may be that when the female is not occupied with a new
rood she may be more tolerant of the sustained demands of the young
oan is the male.

EXPERIENCES WITH CAPTIVE ALBATROSSES
By G. Michael Flieg (St. Louis, Missouri, U.S.A.)
We first obtained specimens of Laysan Albatross (Diomedea immutabilis)
nd Black-footed Albatross (Diomedea nigripes) at the St. Louis Zoo on
4 March 1966. Six specimens of Laysan and three Black-foots were

reived. These birds were collected after the breeding season was
ampleted and arrived thin and not unusually aggressive. Our initial
ttempts at hand feeding were in vain. We then force-fed the birds Smelt
Jsmerus mordax) and squid supplemented with vitamin A and B complex
ad salt tablets. Salt was given until the birds excreted salt from the
asal gland as described by Frings (1959). After a period of two weeks
le birds began to hand-feed. The birds were individually marked with
oloured plastic bands for quick identification. Temperament varied
ithin the group. The Black-foots were the more aggressive whereas
le Laysan were semi-aggressive to docile. The dainty Laysans were
and-fed by placing the fish alongside the mandible; when the beak was
pened, the fish was slid back into the gullet where it was swallowed whole,
&amp;apos;he Black-foots hand-fed quite differently as the fish were snapped from
le hand when held at the end of the mandible and then worked to the

gullet. At this point the birds were taking up to 60 Smelt per day per
bird. We then switched to Herring (Clupea sp.) which was a much
handier size for hand feeding and does not contain thiaminase which
destroys thiamine. Occasional squid were given. The birds were hand
fed so that each bird's intake could be recorded and observations concer-
ning their individual behaviour could be noted. As albatross are aggressive
feeders they should be fed with care. The razor sharp beak and tearing
hook are formidable weapons. One keeper sustained a severe bite which
became badly infected resulting in a severe case of blood poisoning. The
birds were kept in two indoor cages 5x2 metres with access to an outdoor
cage, weather permitting. They were given a salt water solution for
drinking but were seldom observed ingesting it. Instead they preferred
to drink the fine spray of fresh water from a garden hose. By August
only three birds were alive and two succumbed before the end of the year;
the last Black-foot died in April 1967. The next group of Albatross
were received in January 1967, totalling seven Laysan and three Black-foot.
These arrived in poor condition, but were quite heavy as they were taken
near the beginning of the breeding season. They were very aggressive
and difficult to induce to feed. Even when force-fed they refused to keep
a single fish down. These birds died in a short time, but we obtained
some valuable information. Due to improper packing containers,
(cardboard containers were used) half of the birds shipped died in ship-
ment. We also learned that albatross can be overdosed with NaCl.
Our last shipment arrived in December 1969. Well ventilated shipping
containers were built, 100 x 30 x 30 cm, with a door on one end screened
with 6 cm hardware cloth for ventilation. The birds were never fed 01
watered in shipment. Six birds, four Laysan and two Black-foots,
arrived in excellent condition. Again the birds were over-aggressive and
refused to eat. From our experiences thus far we feel that birds taker
after the breeding season respond well to our feeding attempts because
they are lean and hungry and when the birds arrive at this time the weathei
is favourable for giving the birds access to the outdoors for at least a pari
of the time.
All of the birds were promptly autopsied upon their deaths and the
following results were recorded. It was found that contrary to populai
belief the birds could be saturated with NaCl and three birds were losi
due to salt poisoning. Two birds were lost to Nutritional Secondar)
Hyperparathyroidism, an imbalance of Calcium and Phosphorus
Aspergillosis in the respiratory tract claimed the lives of some birds, anc
the virus PPLO was responsible for two deaths.
The treatments administered as a result of diagnosis made througf
observation or autopsy are as follows.
(1) A severe gastro-intestinal problem developed which caused the birde
to vomit all their food. This was diagnosed by autopsy as asper-
gillosis and was promptly cured in other birds with mystatir
(Mycostatin).

(2) PPLO virus was found on autopsy. The birds went down in the
legs and were listless. Frings (1969) lists this as a sodium deficiency
but this occurred when the birds' salt intake was maximum. An
oral cortisone (Azium) was administered along with a tetracyline
(250 mg Achromycin) twice daily.

Individual specimens of albatross have been kept in captivity for
msiderable lengths of time. Washington, D.C. kept a single specimen
: Black-foot for almost nine years and a Laysan for over two. Brookfield

Recently I have had the opportunity to study the captive breedin
biology of the Germains ( Polyplectron germami), Gray ( Polyplectro
bicalcaratuni) and Palawan [Polyplectron emphanum ) Peacock Pheasanl
while working as Curator of Birds--Truli D Farms, Haines City, Florid;
All three species were hatched and reared from eggs obtained froi
seven pairs of Germaine, three pairs of Palawan and three pairs of Gra
of various ages. This study is meaningful because of the statistical!
significant numbers of breeding pairs and data was accumulated on elute
size and clutch intervals in various age birds as well as variations betwee
the three species. Notes were taken on behaviour of the breeding bird
and the chicks. I have outlined the procedure for hatching and rearin
as well as problems which may occur and their solutions. This accour
will begin with detailed observations on each species and conclude wit
general procedures for rearing peacock pheasants. The same procedure
may be used for the Roul Roul Partridge ( Rollulus roulroul ).
Generally the Peacock Pheasants go to roost right after sundowi
It is at this time that laying hens can be spotted as they stay on the groun
rather than going to roost. The hens may appear puffy for a day or tw
prior to laying. Peacock Pheasant eggs are creamy pink to white I
colour. The hen goes to roost after laying or may remain on the egg
it laid when it is near dark. The nest is a simple scrape usually in
corner of the pen or under vegetation. The Palawan may drop its eg#
at random. A comparison of the Breeding Data compiled on the thre
species is shown in Table I.

Their pens can be entered carefully without exciting the birds. Tf
cock is bold and doesn't hesitate to display before an audience. Th
species is the first to lay (Table I). The hen is broody and will prote&amp;lt;
her second egg. If the eggs are removed, a hen will produce up to si
clutches. Yearling pairs are capable of breeding and of three young par
one produced fertile eggs, the other two did not lay.

The Germain's is the most shy and flighty. The display is rarely seen
id most birds are extremely nervous. The oldest hen produced one egg
atches or in the instances where she laid two eggs they were four days
*art. All the young pairs laid but the fertility was very poor. Up to
c clutches can be produced by a single hen. The male Germaine
icomes quite nervous and vocal when the hen is ready to lay.
The Palawan is between the previous species in temperament. This
ecies displays readily but is a bit shyer than the Gray. The cock takes
r o to three years to attain its full colour but is sexually mature during
e first breeding season. The eggs are 100% fertile even among the
ar-old pairs. Before the hen lays, the cock becomes very irritable and
ntrary to his nature is flighty.
Eggs of the peacock pheasants are not stored but set immediately as
utility declines quickly. The eggs hatch in 20-21 days. They are
aced in the hatcher 2-4 days prior to hatching depending on the air
ace in the egg. If the egg is dry and the air space large, it is placed
to the hatcher early. If the air cell is small, it is put later or allowed to
tch in the incubator. Eggs are turned 45 degrees three times daily,
mperature in the incubator 99J* F (37-5* C) and Humidity (Wet
ilb) approximately 83* F (28* C). The chicks hatch about 24 hours
er pipping. The Palawan chick which is the strongest hatches immedi-
dy. The chicks are allowed to dry in the incubator. They are then
wed into a brooder box. The box used is 61 cm. x 61 cm. x 20 cm.
te box is ventilated on three sides. The solid side contains the light
lb which is about four inches from the solid brooder floor. The
icks are started with 100 watt bulb; maintaining the temperature at
out 93--95 0 F (35 0 C). Paper towels are used on the floor. Crumbles
Purina Gamebird Startina and Trout Chow are sprinkled on it. Quart
waterers are used with marbles placed in the water to prevent drowning,
le chicks are started on mealworms; each chick receiving 1--2 worm?
*ee times daily from a forceps and are given water from a dropper until
;y are observed drinking. When newly hatched chicks are introduced
established ones they are placed inside a small circular cage 15 cm. in
imeter made of fine hardware cloth. The chick can move around in
i mobile cage until the others are used to him. The chicks of the three
3cies are similar in size but differ a bit in colouration and are readily
tinguishable to the trained eye. As many as 6-8 chicks can be reared
;ether if they are compatible. We were able to put three-day-old
lawans with 10-day-old Gray and Germain's. The Palawans even at
s age are very aggressive and become dominant in the peck order though
7 are only half the size of the others. Grays on the other hand are
: most docile and ignore their cage mates. Male peacock pheasants
i be detected as early as three days of age as they display to their cage
tes. Germain s are the most difficult to raise and their individual
iperaments range from aggressive to docile. This also has to do with

the sex as males are more aggressive. All chicks are handled daily t&amp;lt;
check the vent and weight. The vent must be kept clean or the bird
become constipated. If a bird is encountered with this condition, th&amp;lt;
water should be treated with Cosa-Terramycin. If crooked toes develop
the chicks can be given a 5 mg. tablet of Vitamin B 2 daily--broken int&amp;lt;
small pieces and placed deep into the throat with a forceps. If th*
condition is not remedied in 10 days, spread the toes in natural positioi
between masking tape. In ancther two weeks remove the tape and th
toes will be perfect. During this procedure continue using the B
religiously. Initially \ in. perches should be placed in the brooder
Use dowel pins gradually increasing the diameter as the chick grows
Chicks are kept in the brooder until they are nearly grown.
During this growing period the size of the light bulb must be decrease&amp;lt;
gradually to 15 watt minimum and the marbles can be removed from th
waterer. Cleanliness must be maintained at all times. Paper towel
must be changed when necessary and the waterer changed and cleane&amp;lt;
daily. The young birds remain tame but fly out of the brooders whei
they are opened. It is important, therefore, that the brooders be kep
in a room or building so that the chicks cannot escape. Mealworms fet
individually keep the birds tame. When grown, the birds are transferre&amp;lt;
to roofed wire bottom cages with shelter in them. Groups of thes
peacock pheasants can be then introduced together into a large cage an&amp;lt;
can be kept together for months without problems. Of course, when th
breeding season begins fighting will occur and the birds must be separate&amp;lt;
into pairs or pens of separate sexes and species.
In northern climates peacock pheasants must be kept indoors in th
winter if temperatures are lower than 35 0 F. (i-6* C.). Their lif
expectancy sometimes exceed 10 years.

By George A. Smith (Peterborough, England)
The male of my pair of Port Lincoln Parakeets is very tame. (For the
urist in taxanomic matters they actually are Barnardius zonarius dundasi
nd not B.z.zonarius). This otherwise very pleasing tameness has made
im something of a nuisance when breeding. For I cannot enter the
ight without being attacked unless I go to the bother of carrying a
lack catching-net. The white net is practically useless as a prophylactic
Dr it is the blackness which frightens him more than the fear of being
aught. And each morning as I do my rounds of giving tit-bits of fruit
nd protein I have to spend too much time making him pursue my left
and--outside the wire--while my right hand sneaks inside and stealthily
hanges the pots. Sadly his worse fault, which I believe comes from this
lmost complete lack of fear, is to courageously climb right to the bottom
f the very long and dark nest-box where, if he can, he eats the eggs.
He developed his liking for eggs two days before the first clutch was
ue to hatch and the two eggs that I rescued were badly cracked. However
le repairs made with transparent nail varnish held and one hatched under
ndian Ringnecks, Psittacula krameri, but it died because they would not
-ed it, although they are excellent parents with their own chicks. The
ort Lincoln managed to eat all the second round after his wife had sat for
full week. But from the third clutch I managed to take three eggs.
Vo were given to Rock Pebblars, Polytelis anthopeplus , and the other
ut under Redrumps, Psephotus haematonotus. All three hatched.
The differences between Port Lincoln chicks and those of Rock Pebblars
re very slight. It is mainly that the Rock Pebblars have slightly more
Lite down; have less pronounced barbs to the arrow-shaped tip of the
pper bill; and they may be fractionally larger and perhaps slightly less
elpless. Indistinct as these differences are the hen Rock Pebblar had no
ifficulty in distinguishing them for, though she continued to brood the
fixed babies, she did not feed the Port Lincolns and one died before I
jalised this neglect. The second hatched chick was rescued only just in
me. At about two days old he was extremely weak and, completely
:arved of food, he lay partly immersed in a trio of fat Rock Pebblar chicks
ich with a massive, filled crop. Only one of these well-fed chicks was
Ider than the neglected Port Lincoln. The starved chick was artificially
;d with " Farex " and milk and then, not wishing to become its wet-nurse,
was put with the only available parent parrots, which were quite in-
sperienced Bourke's Grass-parakeets, Neophema bourkii , with week-old
Dung. They accepted it immediately. After two more days the third
yg under the Redrumps hatched and I waited two days to make positively
;rtain that they were feeding it before I gave them the now seemingly
lormous " Cuckoo " Port Lincoln from the Bourke's nest. As a further

experiment I also gave an incubating Yellow-fronted New Zealand
parrakeet, Cyanoramphns auriceps, two Splendid Grass-parrakeet, N.
splendida , eggs; and a Barraband, Polytelis swainsonii, those of a Gold-
mantled Rosella, Platycercus eximius. These two foster-parents had
previously proved themselves to be good parents. The fostered eggs
hatched just before, or in the same period as the fosterers' own eggs, yet
like the Ringnecks and Rock Pebblar, they would not feed the fostered
chicks although they did not neglect their own.
In the available literature there are many accounts of different parrot
species successfully rearing quite alien forms. My personal knowledge
includes Redrumps (whose young have thick down and fledge when four
or five weeks old) hatching and rearing Indian Ringnecks (whose chicks
are born naked and spend almost twice as long in the box) and Budgerigars,
Melopsittacus undulatus , raising Quaker Conures, Myiopsitta monachus
until they became too large for the foster parents' feeding ability.
(Budgerigar chicks are naked, Quakers are downed and have, like the
majority of New World parrots, huge basal swellings to the upper
mandible). From the literature we might especially note Fischer's
Lovebirds, Agapornis per sonata jischeri , successfully rearing a Splendid
Grass-Parrakeet with some of their own chicks (Boosey 1934); Bourke's
rearing Princess of Wales', Polytelis alexandrae (Harvey 1933); and Brown-
throated Conures, Aratinga pertinax , fostered from an early age by
Budgerigars (Williams 1907). Failures are not often given: West (1955)
found that his Cockatiels, Nymphicus hollandicus , would not feed Crimson-
wings, Aprosmictus erythropterus.
Dilger (i960) reports that once Lovebirds, Agapornis spp., have had ex-
perience of feeding their own youngsters then the sexually differentiated
forms he studied--Madagascar cana; Abyssinian, taranta, --which have
white-downed young refused to feed the fresh-hatched chicks of the like
sexed Lovebirds--and vice-versa. It might be noted that the species in
which the sexes are similar--Peach-faced, roseicollis; Masked, Black-
cheeked, Nyassa, Fischer's, per sonata ssp.--have a slightly more dense
down with a pink rather than a white colour. But should the parent
Lovebirds have had no experience of raising young then they would
feed chicks of the other group. He found, by experiment, that when Peach-
faced Lovebirds foster-reared as their first brood white-downed species of
Love-birds they would not subsequently feed their own pink-downed
chicks.
Dilger did not suggest how it is that Lovebirds can distinguish their
own offspring. It is unlikely they do it by sight. The difference between
pale pink and white would not be made out in the dim light of a nest
chamber. And, as Dilger notes, although experienced breeding Lovebirds
will not feed fresh hatched chicks of " opposite " forms this discrimination
does not apply to older chicks. That is when the visual differences
between the chicks are only too obviously apparent. I know of Cockatiels

ccepting half-grown Bourke's, and Gold-mantled Rosellas, put in the
test with their own young; yet when subsequently offered fresh-hatched
hicks in their next breeding cycle let them die unfed. It is my experience
hat older chicks, provided they are not too close to fledging, get accepted
vhile in the box.
I believe that this discrimination against alien species comes because a
ten parrot experienced in rearing chicks has become attuned to react
[uite specifically to the noises made by their hungry chicks. If the
ubsequent chicks cannot give a correct sound then the parent is unable
o react and feed it. Neglect is therefore not " purposeful " but a psy-
hological inability to react to " strange " food-begging calls. If this is a
orrect hypothesis then it must follow, from Diliger's experiment with the
'each-faced Lovebirds, that the first experience that Lovebirds (and most
*arrots?) have of hatching and rearing their chicks " imprints " them with
heir specific chick noise for it seems not to be a hereditory knowledge but
omething that has to be learnt. Following such imprinting the parents
an only respond to this or to very similar sounds.
The explanation for the development in parrots of this fine sense of
.iscrimination, to the food soliciting calls of very young chicks, is that
vithout it the smaller and younger members of a parrot brood would
&amp;apos;robably die of starvation because of excessive attention being given by the
arents to the stronger, more actively soliciting, elder chicks.
Parrot hens usually begin the incubation of their eggs before the clutch
$ complete. The youngest chicks, if they are to survive, must have a
reater allure for the parents to feed them than the elder chicks (Smith
972). The eldest members of a brood, especially with the fast growing,
round-feeding, forms, can be almost of adult size and weight, with
gathers, capable of maintaining their own body heat and are fed largely by
ctively soliciting food from the parents. While the freshly hatched
oungest would be less than 10% of adult weight, completely blind
asily cooled and almost absolutely incapable of any physical movement
xcept to jerk its head vertically while being fed with its beak held by the
arent and of shuffling into sources of heat, the rest of the brood consisting
f various intermediates between these two conditions. Elder chicks
ound very noticeably different from the babies. Their food soliciting
all makes the parents regurgitate and feed, but it is not done with the
olicitude they show for the very young. I have repeatedly observed
bat parrots excited enough to regurgitate food--and some parrots seem
d get literally sick with excitement--attempt to feed a noticeable projec-
ion, which is usually the bill of another bird. But isolated, sexually active
idividuals can be seen to feed projecting twigs, knots of wood, spots of
aint and even their feet. I have seen a male Splendid call his wife to
be hole of the box to be fed and then proceed to feed a projecting nail,
ather than her, presumably because it offered more stimulus than her
tubby bill. Oddly she swallowed after each " feeding " just as if he

had fed her. An older chick waggling its head and moving its face
purposely towards the parent is easily seen and fed for it provides an
attracting feature--the bill which in all nestling parrots is light-coloured.
But the very young can barely raise their heads. They have to lie
because it is source of heat, immured beneath a cluster of their older
brethren. They must therefore have a means of attracting the parent
hearing it to purposely seek out the source of such a noise, regurgitate
pick up its beak and feed it. The noise must therefore be quite distinctive
from older chicks and, to a parrot, be most plaintive. It is therefore such
an important feature in the successful rearing of large broods that is
has become selectively attuned to a very high level of discrimination.
If this is so, and the evidence seems to point that way^ then people
desirous of fostering eggs of parrots would be advised, if the parrot species
are quite dissimilar, to use inexperienced rather than experienced hens
for the purpose. Secondly valuable hens that have, for some reason or
other, no success in hatching their first round should not be used as fosters
for alien forms in case they become imprinted to these and will not, in
subsequent rounds, feed their own offspring.

Although there is usually an indication at the end of an article in the
magazine if it is thought that the account in question is a record of the
first breeding of a species in Great Britain or Northern Ireland, it is not
always clear if an award has been made; and I have been asked to summarise
the more recent awards. I have taken as a starting point here those
breedings for which no award had been made by the end of 1970, although
the account may have been published in that year. In the list below the

It will be noted that some breedings, thought at first to be first records,
are omitted from the above list. Subsequent letters in the magazine
(vol. 73 : 48) indicated that the breeding of the Lesser Sulpher-crusted
Cockatoo, Cacatua sulphurea sulphurea by C. Smith was not the first, and
we were notified of an earlier breeding of the Perfect Lorikeet, Trichoglossus
euteles , to that of K. Russell; by I. G. Hale in 1969. Notification was also
received of earlier breedings of the Crimson-rumped Waxbill, Estrilda
rhodopyga , and Chester's claim for the Yellow-breasted Bunting, Emberiza
aureola , has also been queried.
The Gold Coast Touraco, Tauraco persa, had already been bred under
the name Senegal Touraco by Captain H. S. Stokes in 1932. The
oversight here was a simple one, a list being lacking at the time, but more
problems are raised when taxonomic revisions of birds result in forms
which retain different English names, and which were previously regarded
as separate species, being grouped as subspecies of a single species. The
rules of the Society allow the award of a medal for the first breeding of a
species. Other medals may be awarded at the council's discretion for
breedings of special merit, but the award for a species must be for what is
regarded as a species in the current consensus of taxonomic opinion.
This rule seems to have been overlooked in the past in the case of some
parrot breedings, and had led to some confusion, especially since many
jubspecies are not clearly defined entities. Two breedings during the
period under discussion are affected by this. The Double Yellow-headed
Amazon Parrot, bred by C. Smith, is now regarded as a subspecies,
Amazona ochrocephala oratrix, of the Yellow-headed Amazon, the
nominate form of which, the Yellow-fronted Amazon, had already been
ored by Mr. Smith and for which he had received the Society's medal.
The Lesser Patagonian Conure, Cyanoliseus p. patagonus, bred at Chester
#00, is regarded as a subspecies of a species including the Greater
&amp;apos;Patagonian Conure, C. p. byroni , which had been bred in 1963 by W. R.
Partridge. Under the rule these two breedings do not therefore qualify as
irst breedings of a species.
The breeding of Weber's Lorikeet, Trichoglossus haematodus weberi , by
R. T. Kyme, for which a medal was awarded in 1971 is therefore not an
iward for a breeding of a species, but a discretional award for the first
seeding of a well-defined isolate of a species of which other subspecies
tad already been bred. I personally feel that in instances where well-
iefined subspecies are bred the onus is on the breeder to indicate the degree
)f difference which he feels is involved, and which might justify an award;
ilthough this is difficult in view of the small number of birds usually
nvolved, which tends to exaggerate the individual differences in behaviour
vhich are normally apparent. The final decision, right or wrong, must
est with the Council.

Several cases of ornithosis have been diagnosed in human patients
recently and almost invariably the source of the infection has been traced
to newly imported South American Parrots. Some clinicians believe
that the only solution to the problem is the immediate reintroduction of
restrictions on the importation of psittacine birds. Most bird lovers
would probably welcome such a move not only on medical but also on
humanitarian grounds. There can be little doubt that the appalling
conditions in which parrots and other birds are being imported and
maintained on many dealers' premises are probably the fundamental
cause of the present situation.

Dean Amadon. New York: The American Museum of Natural
History. 1973- Price 20 dollars.
The game birds of the family Cracidae are found in the tropics and
sub-tropics of the Americas, from the border of Texas to northern
Argentina. They are much more aboreal than the pheasants and not so
brightly coloured. Many, however, are elegant in shape and have
brightly coloured skin ornaments, wattles and crests, on the head. The
variation in plumage between a number of different species is often
difficult to detect and their classification has had to be thoroughly revised.
This has been carried out by the authors, with the help of Dr. C. Vaurie
who had previously published detailed studies on this subject.
This book, thanks to the Phipps foundation, is profusely and beautifully
illustrated. Both the coloured plates and black and white drawings are
by Albert E. Gilbert, and in addition there are four colour plates by
George Miksch Sutton and one by David Reid-Henry, three skilled
artists whose work would be hard to surpass, and results in a magnificent
volume of great attactiveness.
The two distinguished authors give a wealth of documentation of the
Curassows, Guans and Chalchalacas, in particular with regard to their
characteristics and habits.
The records of these birds in captivity and their breeding as well as
information on their care is of especial interest and value to aviculturists

In an article on the Wildfowl Trust published in the magazine recently Mr. T.
ohnstone casually mentioned the breeding of the Blue-winged Pitta, Pitta
wluccensis, in the tropical house. Since, as far as we are aware, there are no
ecords of succ essful breedings of any species of pittas in Britain as yet, we asked
ar more details and Mr. Johnstone has supplied the following data--" First nest
&amp;apos;uilding commenced on 21st May 1972 j first egg on 2nd June. Four eggs were
iken away on 28th June and found to be clear. The second nest was built
uickly on 30th June. Four eggs were laid by 3rd July. Two hatched on 22nd
uly. I hey left^the nest on 7th August and one was found dead in the pond on
oth August. The second young one survived. Both parents incubated, brooded
nd fed the young. There are other pittas and Sun Bitterns in the house, and the
dult female Blue-winged Pitta was found dead with a head injury some days
fter the young hatched."

HON. TREASURER'S REPORT
We have published this year a Balance Sheet as well as a full Income
nd Expenditure Account. From the latter you will see that your
ociety made a loss of #308.42 last year due to rising costs and a fall in
lembership.
It has been decided not to increase the Membership fee but to effect
:onomies mainly in the production of the Magazine which we are
mfident can be done without any fall in the high standard which has been
laintained for so long.
We would ask all Members to make every effort to interest others in
&amp;gt;ining our Society. We would also welcome donations which can be
sed to increase the number of coloured plates printed or for general
urposes, according to the donor's wish. The Society is registered as a
larity and a donation in the usual form of covenant will enable us to
:claim tax. This does not apply to subscriptions.
The Balance Sheet, printed for the first time, takes into account
rinting costs unpaid at the close of the year. The Society has for many
iars paid its printer in arrears and it has been decided to sell our Bonds
&amp;gt; clear up this situation and enable us to renegotiate our printing. This
ill leave the Society with very little reserves but we are confident that
tese can be built up again.
I wish to acknowledge a generous anonymous donation of #100 to
sist us in carrying out the proposed changes.
H. J. Horswell,

On January ist, 1974 I shall be replaced as Editor of the Avicultural
Magazine by John Yealland. In this my farewell and expression of
thanks to the many contributors who have made my task so gratifying
and enjoyable during the 34 years as Editor, I think perhaps I can best
summarize my experiences by quoting briefly a few paragraphs from the
Editorial I wrote in the 75th Anniversary Supplement published in
November 1969, Volume 75, No. 6. After an account of the early days
and problems of the Magazine I wrote:
" The situation remained difficult till 1925, after which the Magazine went from
strength to strength owing to the great ability and drive of Mr. David Seth-Smith
who had served as Editor (sometimes with a co-Editor) from 1901 to 1934, with
only an interval of 10 years from 1910-1920.
" It came, to say the least of it, as a surprise when, at an ornithological meeting
in 1938 Mr. Alfred Ezra, Monsieur Jean Delacour and Mr. David Seth-Smith
came up to me and said, ' We have an additional job for you, we want you to edit
the Avicultural Magazine '. ' But I can't ', I replied, ' I am not an aviculturist '.
' No matter we will help you.' And that is how it all began. Thanks to the
efforts of all three I gradually graduated to being an aviculturist."
Shortly afterwards the Second World War broke out.
" Like a snail with its shell I took the Magazine with me during my various
vicissitudes of the war--typing on rickety tables in billets--correcting proofs
during rare occasions when there was a lull during night duty at the Foreign Office,
and later finding even the pasting-up of the pages a relief and relaxation from the
underground existence deep in the Corsham caves in the production of a new
secret aircraft engine. When I lost my home and all my possessions by a direct
hit during the Battle of Britain the editorial headquarters of the Magazine were
literally a large suitcase.
" During 1940 the standard and size of the Magazine were maintained, but at
the end of that year with the fall in income and rise in cost of production it was
essential that economy should be made and it was therefore decided to publish
the Magazine every second month. With the progress of the war the pinch became
tighter, particularly with the advent of paper rationing, and the Magazine became
very slim.
" Since the war the Magazine has gradually built up again though with a
difference. Most of the great collections of the past have gone, but a new pattern
has appeared in the bird parks open to the public . . . which have proved that they
can give much interesting information and achieve first breedings, as well as serve
as an attraction for the public."
It has always been my aim to maintain a balance between scientific and
popular interests and the fact that at the present time articles are contri-
buted from all over the world is gratifying evidence of the wide scope of
our journal. This is due to all those who have made it possible, and I
would specially like to thank the printers--Messrs. Warren &amp; Sons Ltd.,
to bring the Magazine to the high standard it now enjoys. Though it
would be invidious to mention by name those who have given the greatest
help they themselves will realize how much is owed to them and how
grateful their Editor is for their unfailing support.
Mr. Yealland will undoubtedly maintain the standard of the Magazine
and in future all communications should be addressed to him at:
