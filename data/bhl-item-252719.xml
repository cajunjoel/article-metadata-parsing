The Medal may be awarded at the discretion of the Committee to any
Member who shall succeed in breeding, in the United Kingdom, any species of
bird which shall not be known to have been previously bred in captivity in Great
Britain or Ireland. Any Member wishing to obtain the Medal must send a detailed
account for publication in the Magazine within about eight weeks from the date
of hatching of the young, and furnish such evidence of the facts as the Executive
Committee may require. The Medal will be awarded only in cases where the
young shall live to be old enough to feed themselves, and to be wholly independent
of their parents. No medal can be given for the breeding of hybrids, or of local
races or sub-species of species that have already been bred.
The account of the breeding must be reasonably full so as to afford
instruction to our Members, and must appear in the Avicultural Magazine before
it is published or notified elsewhere. It should describe the plumage of the young,
and be of value as a permanent record of the nesting and general habits of the species.
These points will have great weight when the question of awarding the Medal
is under consideration.
In every case the decision of the Committee shall be final.
The Medal will be forwarded to each Member as soon after it shall have been
awarded as possible.

THE GENUS SPOROPHILA
By A. Morrison

<bodyText confidence="0.982837857142857" page_id="56222565"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
The Sporophilse are a family of little Grosbeaks inhabiting the
warmer parts of Central and South America. Some twenty-one species
are known in captivity and, as they are hardy, pretty, and invariably
good songsters, they form very suitable subjects from an avicultural
point of view. For some reason they are not a very popular group in
captivity and but little is known about them. It is with a view to
stimulating interest in the genus that I have written this article and
I can but hope that it may arouse some interest.
No claim to originality is advanced. All descriptions have been
taken from the British Museum Catalogue , vol. xii, or Neunzig. I have
merely endeavoured to rearrange and simplify where possible. I am
indebted to Dr. Hopkinson for supplying me with the references which
may be of use, and for the loan of a manuscript translation of Neunzig.

Sporophilse are inclined to be delicate when first imported and
should be kept warm, out of the reach of draughts. When once
acclimatized, they are perfectly hardy and practically all species can
pass the winter in an unheated outdoor aviary with impunity. For
food they should be given canary seed, white and spray millet.
Not more than one pair should be placed in one aviary, as although
harmless with other birds, they are frequently quarrelsome among
themselves. Every collection of Grass Finches and other weaving
finches should contain a pair of Grosbeaks by way of variety and in
such a collection they will be found absolutely harmless. As they
all possess excessively powerful bills they may be safely associated
with much larger birds. If two Sporophilae quarrel, they must be
separated or a death will result. They take their fights very seriously.
White-throated Finch ( Sporophila albigularis)
Male. --Upper surface, slate grey, the crown and sides of head, darker ;
forehead, lores, eye region, and ear coverts, black ; feathers of the
upper back and shoulders with darker centres ; cheeks, throat, sides
of neck, and under parts, white with a broad black band across the chest;
flanks, grey ; first primary quills with white bases forming an oblong
patch on the folded wing ; bill, horn yellow ; feet, grey ; iris, black.
Juvenile Male. --Similar to the female, but paler above and with
a more distinctly whitish throat ; bill, yellow.
Female. --Upper surface, greyish-brown with blackish centres to the
flight and tail feathers ; a whitish wing patch ; under parts, white with
a greyish belt across the chest ; bill, blue grey.

Little is known of the wild life of this species and even skins are
rare in collections. The British Museum only possessed the skins of
four adult males when the Catalogue was published in 1888, and these
four remain the only skins in the collection.
It is, however, commonly imported and is a most charming and
desirable aviary bird. Its plumage is smart, it is extremely hardy,
and is a fine songster. Males of this species have the reputation of
being extremely vicious, but this is only so with closely related birds
and in a collection of Weaving Finches, for example, it is usually
peaceable and harmless.
As with all Sporophibe, hens of the White-throated Finch are very
rare. The catchers never seem to bother to trap them and most of
the " females " sold in this country are young males with yellow bills.
The White-throated Finch has bred in captivity, the first record
in this country being that of the Bev. C. D. Farrar, in 1905. The nest
is an open cup made lightly but strongly of fibres and grass, and in
this is deposited three or four eggs, bluish white in colour, flecked and
spotted with brownish markings. Both parents share in the incubation
which lasts twelve days and the young leave the nest after a further
thirteen days. Soft food and ants' eggs should be given to the nesting
birds.
White-throated Finches are long lived, and one has been known
to survive in captivity for eleven years.
Bluish Finch (S. ccerulescens)
Male. --Very similar to the male White-throated Finch, but is
slightly smaller, possesses a black chin patch, and has no white patch
on the wings ; bill, yellow.
Juvenile Male .--Similar to female but a more ashy grey, with a
whiter breast and belly ; ashy grey chin spot and chest band ; bill,
yellow.
Female. --Above, olive brown ; feathers under the eye dirty white ;
cheeks and under-surface, ochre brown washed with yellow ; paler on

This bird is occasionally imported but is probably frequently
eonfused with the last species. It is a lively active little bird, and
in the southern part of its range is migratory. It prefers to keep in
small plantations and does not associate in very large flocks. The song
is not so good as that of the White-throated Finch and consists of
half a dozen notes delivered with great rapidity. One of its synonyms
is that of Screaming Finch.
The plate in Neunzig is of a northern sub-species (S. ornata), which
possesses a white wing patch.
Grey Finch (S. grisea)
Male. --Above, dark slate grey, darker and blackish on the head,
sides of neck, throat, lores, and cheeks ; a tinge of brown on the upper
tail coverts ; under parts, white ; sides of body and thighs, dark slate
grey; lesser wing coverts, slate grey; greater wing coverts, black washed
with brownish ; rest of wing feathers, black grey with a white wing
patch at the base of the inner primaries ; tail, blackish with the central
feathers edged with ashy grey ; bill, yellowish ; feet, dark grey;
iris, brown.
Juvenile Male. --I can find no description of this, but it is probably
similar to the female with a yellow bill.
Female. --Upper surface and sides of body, pale olive brown, darker
on the crown ; sides of head and under surface, pale olive yellow ;
centre of belly, breast, under tail coverts, and thighs, whitish ; lesser
wing coverts like the back ; the other wing feathers, grey brown with
olive-brown edges (the primaries with ash-grey edges) ; tail, brown
edged with olive brown ; bill, black.

This bird is occasionally imported and, although not very striking,
it appears to be very desirable being harmless and a good songster.
They were bred by Dr. Russ, and in 1880 by Jantzen, of Hamburg.
Page was the first to breed this species in England, in 1912, and it has
been bred once or twice since. The Grey Finch appears to build the
usual fragile looking little nest in a bush, and incubation lasts thirteen
days. The young leave the nest after a further period of fourteen days.
The eggs are lead grey with sharply defined blackish scrawls, and spots
overlaying indistinct violet and grey ground patches.
Eulers Finch (S. superciliaris)
Male. --Above, olive green, darker on the top of the head ; lores,
eyelid, and eyebrow streak whitish yellow ; ear coverts, olive brown
with whitish shaft lines; cheeks and throat, white washed with yellowish ;
sides of neck like the upper surface; breast, grey washed with yellowish ;
lower breast and centre of belly, white ; sides of body, greyish brown
shading into olive ; under tail coverts, pale brownish yellow with the
bases of the feathers darker and washed with olive ; thighs, brownish
olive ; lesser wing coverts, like the upper surface ; inner coverts, dark
brown with olive edges and whitish ochre tips ; rest of wing feathers
and those of tail, dark brown edged with olive ; axillaries and under-wing
coverts, white with olive yellow edges ; irides, dark brown ; bill,
brownish grey, heavy, and strongly curved with a larger lower mandible
which overlaps the cutting edges of the upper ; feet, brownish grey.
Juvenile Male. --Resembles female.
Female. --Above, darker than the male ; eyelid and lores, olive
yellow ; ear coverts, throat, and sides of face, dull olive ; breast and
sides of body, olive brown, washed with yellowish ; centre of belly,,
yellowish white ; under tail coverts, brown ; wings and tail, as in the
male, but with the pale markings greyish; irides, brown ; beak, blackish
brown ; feet, blackish grey.

This is one of the largest of the Sporophilse, but little is known
of its habits in a wild state, although it is said to live on the outskirts
of forests and marshes.
Eulers Finch is occasionally imported but does not appear to be
a particularly attractive bird. It nested with Buss about 1874, but
it is uncertain whether full breeding success was attained or not.
They built a large, untidy, open nest in a bush. The song is a noisy
rattling chatter interspersed with some long drawn notes and short
trills. They appear to be harmless, good-tempered birds.
Half White Finch (S. hypoleuca)
Male. --Upper surface and sides of neck, slate grey ; cheeks, throat,
and rest of under parts, white ; thighs, white, merging into grey behind ;
lesser wing coverts, slate grey ; the others, black edged with dark grey ;
bastard wing, primary coverts, and flights, black edged with pale grey ;
axillaries and under-wing coverts, white, with a blackish patch near

The Half White Finch is another large but rarely imported
Sporophila. In a wild state it inhabits open plains, where it feeds
mainly on grass seeds. It is a common cage bird in its native land,
where it is prized for its song.
I have two males at the present time and find them most charming
birds. One, which is cage moulted, is very tame and sings beautifully.

The song is quite simple but loud and sweet. It appears to be a very
good-tempered bird, even when caged with other Sporophihe. This is
fortunate for it is the possesser of a fiendishly powerful bill quite out
of proportion with the size of the bird. A single nip will practically
draw blood and it is not a pleasant bird to handle.
Plumbeous Finch (jS. &apos;plumbed)
Male. --Above, ashy grey, lighter on the lower rump ; upper tail
coverts, blackish edged with ashy ; tail feathers, blackish, narrowly
edged with grey brown, which becomes pale grey towards the ends ;
lores, black, extending to the base of nostril ; ear coverts and cheeks,
dark ashy, the former with whitish shaft lines ; small white streak at
base of cheeks ; lower eyelid, white ; throat and breast, ashy grey ;
centre of breast, belly, and under-tail coverts, white ; sides of body,
ash grey ; thighs, white in front, ashy behind ; lesser wing coverts,
like the back ; rest of wing feathers, blackish, edged on the primaries
with dirty white ; on the others with ashy grey ; pale edges very
broad on the inner secondaries, while a white wing patch is formed
by the inner primaries ; axillaries and under-wing coverts, white, with
a dark patch at the wing border ; bill, blackish, with a pale flesh-
coloured tip ; feet, dark brownish grey ; iris, bright, greyish brown ;
in some cases the bill is yellow and this feature is probably variable.
Juvenile Male .--Much browner above and on the margins of the
wing coverts and quills ; under parts, suffused with brown, which also
deadens the white on the throat and abdomen.
Female .--Yellowish grey brown, paler below, with the centre of
the belly whitish and no white wing patch.

Two sub-species have been described :--

Similar to the typical race but with the chin and base of cheeks
white.

Similar to the typical race but with the chin, throat, and forepart

Habitat. --Colombia.
In a wild state the Plumbeous Finch has been observed in small
parties in the open pampas and in bushes in swampland. It possesses
a loud, clear song, and is greatly valued as a cage bird in its native land.
I only know of the typical race having been imported, but I have
given the two sub-species as a matter of interest. The Plumbeous Finch
appears to be a very desirable bird and has the reputation of being
one of the best songsters in a very tuneful family. Unfortunately it is
very rarely imported. Neunzig states that it has once been bred but
unfortunately gives no particulars.
Lined Finch (S. lineola)
Male. --Above, black, glossed with greenish, with a band of white
feathers across the rump a little mixed with grey ; a broad, longitudinal,
white stripe extends over the crown from the base of bill with a similar
streak at base of each cheek ; throat, black ; under surface and breast,
pure white ; thighs, externally black, internally white ; sides and flanks
washed with grey ; wing feathers, blackish with glossy edges ; a double
white wing patch on primaries and secondaries, the latter being obscured
by the greater coverts ; tail, black ; iris, brown ; feet, lead grey.
Juvenile Male. --Similar to the female but more fulvous below ;
a little black on the wing and tail feathers and under the throat feathers
which form a dusky patch, followed by a whitish patch on the lower
throat.
Female. --Above olive brown, lighter on the under surface, lores,
eyelid, cheeks, and throat, pale huffish ochre ; back of the head browner;
breast and abdomen, washed with huffish ochre ; sides and flanks, olive
brown ; thighs, yellow brown ; lesser wing coverts, as above ; under-
wing coverts, dirty white washed with yellowish ; other wing feathers,
dark brown with olive brown edges to the secondaries ; bill, black ;
iris, grey brown ; feet, fleshy brown.

The Lined Finch is occasionally imported and is a most delightful
little bird. In a wild state it prefers open country and associates in
flocks.
It is a very pretty species, speedily becomes tame, and confiding,
and is a good songster. It is inclined to be vicious with closely related
birds, but is otherwise absolutely harmless. It has never been bred.
Black-headed Lined Finch ( S. ocellata)
Male. --Similar to the Common Lined Finch but with the top
of the head black, though in the middle of the forehead there are
sometimes a few irregular white streaky markings ; ear coverts, black,
and only the cheeks white ; the feathers over the crop, black, with
white dot-like markings at the tips ; feathers on the sides of the body,
white, with black bases which are sometimes visible ; whole upper
surface of the wing, black, with a greenish gloss ; upper tail coverts
and tail, black, with glossy, greenish edges ; feet, black ; bill, black.
Juvenile Male. --I can find no description of this, but it is presumably
very similar to the young male Lined Finch.
Female. --Similar to female Lineola but with the whole fore neck
pale ochre yellowish ; under-wing coverts, whitish ochre washed with
yellow ; sides of body and flanks, yellowish ochre ; median and greater
wing coverts with paler ends forming an obsolete white wing bar.

This handsome little bird is very rare in captivity. Some were
imported in 1906 and 1907 to this country and this September I was
offered some by a German dealer. In its ways it probably resembles
the Common Lined Finch, but its song is said only to consist of a
sparrow-like chirping.

In its native land the Lineated Finch is ubiquitous, living both
in the high-lying, grassy plains, and in the damp lowlands. It is very
rarely imported. The Berlin Zoo had it in 1913 and some were imported
to England in 1909. The London Zoo has had it.
Spectacled Finch (S. ophthalmica)

THE HAND-REARING OF THE WHITE-
CAPPED PARROT
(.Pionus senilis )
By H. Yealland
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.99159" page_id="56222575"  page_num="11" year="" vol="">
The disappointment of the failure of Lord Tavistock's pair of
White-capped Parrots to rear their young successfully last summer
was, at the time, mitigated by the hope that a second nest might
be forthcoming, and it was with this expectation that we substituted
two tall logs for the tall box in which the previous brood of two
young ones had come to grief.
All hope of breeding this charming species in 1934 had, how-
ever, gone by the time I went for my holiday in early August, for,
a few days before I left, I noticed that the cock had commenced to
moult and had actually dropped a secondary. It was, therefore,
with surprise that I learnt on my return of a new effort on the

part of the White-capped and the probability of eggs due to hatch in
about a fortnight.
How many eggs there were we did not know, for the hen rarely
comes off from the time she settles down in the nest (and I believe
this is a long time before the first egg is laid) until the young are
some days old.
At about the time Lord Tavistock left for Scotland in early
September he told me he thought the eggs would hatch in about a
week, and, as there was little hope of the successful rearing of the
family (for in addition to the parents' persistent failures from one
cause or another, the autumn seemed to be already upon us, and
the nights were quite chilly), he wanted me to try to hand-rear at
least one of the young.
It was difficult at the time of the expected hatching of the eggs
to tell what was going on in the nest, for I could never find the
hen off, nor could I hear any sound of young ones : it seemed,
however, certain that all was well with the hen, because the cock
spent a lot of time sitting outside the nest.
On account of the cold weather I did not like to take the cock
away, because this would mean that the hen would probably come
off for food and might stay off long enough to spoil the eggs :
moreover, as it had previously taken not less than a week for the
cock to get bored with the young ones, to the point of biting them
into small pieces, I decided that to leave him was the safer course.
A few days later I had my chance when I found the hen off,
and on looking into the log I found three eggs, two of them fertile
and apparently fairly near hatching and the third quite definitely
clear. I had no other chance of looking in for a week, and then
I found that neither of the eggs had hatched. I feared that they
contained dead young ones, for it seemed that the hatching was
long overdue.
I did not catch the hen off again, but about eight days later,
on 30th September, I noticed the cock eating grass, and this meant
that in all probability there were young, for the cock very rarely
eats grass at any other time.
The difficulty of the moment was how to get the hen off, and, as

she declined to move when the log was tapped, it was clear that
any young ones there might be would need to be rescued by bold
methods. I took off the lid, and even so could see nothing but the
defiant hen : it was then a choice between removing her and
chancing desertion, and leaving her and risking whether the
potential young survived until I could catch her off. I decided on
the former course and, by lowering a twig into the nest so that the
hen clung savagely to it, I was able without much difficulty to get
her out.
I found one young one about four days old, and the other fertile
egg contained a dead chick, for a lot of dark liquid could be seen
moving about inside when the egg was turned. I took the young
one into the hospital and put it into a small box containing a thick
layering of soft, crumbled, decayed wood, and on the top of this a
piece of flannel. The flannel was not absolutely necessary, but by
changing it twice daily the box could be kept very clean, and it
was also useful for the better observation of the state of the young
one's bowels. The temperature of the hospital at that time was
between 80* and 85* F., and so, with another piece of flannel laid
on the young one, its body warmth was, I conjectured, quite well
maintained.
The parents seemed to feel their loss considerably, for the hen
was very sulky for some days, while the cock took on a special fury
and it was evident that he regarded such interference with his
privilege to kill his own young a positive outrage.
When I brought the little bird in it had a small quantity of
food in its crop, and this lasted it until the early afternoon. I at
first thought that it would be impossible to supply semi-solid food
to so small a bird, and accordingly I started to give egg and milk,
but found that a meal of this lasted only about two hours and it
was clear that something more sustaining was needed. The following
mixture was then tried, and it is upon this that the bird has been
successfully reared : 1 part soaked monkey nuts, \ part soaked
shelled sunflower seed, 1 part brown bread, S part peeled sweet
apple, small quantity of green food (such as the leaves of the soft
milk thistle, lettuce, dandelion, and cabbage), a small quantity

of Allinson's food prepared with milk (as for lorikeets), into which
has been mixed the yolk of an egg, about J teaspoon Radio-malt
and J teaspoon of Marmite. The wdiole of the solid ingredients of
this mixture were thoroughly chewed up each morning, and by
being kept in a pot in a cold place remained fresh the whole day.
The red skin on the monkey nuts was, of course, removed, and only
the tender leaves of the green food were used. The complete mixture
should not be made too liquid, but should conform as nearly as
possible to the consistency of the food normally supplied by a
parrot to its young.
The only way of feeding the young of parrot-like birds with any
degree of facility is to warm the food in the mouth and feed the
bird from the mouth--this process is much easier and less revolting
than it might sound, and by this method there is no danger of
deforming the beak, as there is by feeding with a spoon. It is, of
course, essential that the food should be given warm.
From the very first the little parrot has flourished on this treat-
ment and has evaded all the maladies of the sick birds that have
been brought into the hospital since it has been there. I have fed
the bird four times each day, including once at about 11.00 p.m.,
and presumably this is better treatment than parent birds would
normally provide at this time of the year.
At about ten days the eyelids showed signs of separating, and
at about fourteen days the eyes were open. At about this time, too,
feathers were making their appearance beneath the skin : the most
advanced were the scapulars and the wing coverts. I found that at
this stage the little bird needed an abundance of food for, in
addition to the growth of feathers, the body continued to grow at
a rapid pace.
At all meal times, excepting the first morning one, the bird had
some food left in its crop (a fact of which, to judge by its lusty
cries when I approached, the little parrot was not aware--indeed,
it continued to clamour for food even when its crop had assumed
what seemed to me alarming proportions), and I feared that there
might be a danger of this food becoming sour, but as this never
happened, there was, presumably, no danger.

H. Yealland -- Hand-rearing of the White-capped Parrot 15
The bird continued to thrive, and was of such aggressive health
that I had hopes of a successful rearing. As more and more " pin
feathers made their appearance, I wondered if the heat of the
room was too great, and partly for this reason, and partly because
the covering was often trampled underfoot by the young one, I dis-
continued the covering altogether.
At about four weeks the bird was fairly well covered with
feathers, and I thought it would be better for its health to be kept
in the next room, the temperature of which is maintained at 65 to
70*, and to this end I lowered the hospital temperature by about
one degree each day. I never succeeded in getting the temperature
below 76* before another sick bird had to be brought in, and the
heat increased to 85* again.
On 12th November I moved the bird to another open-topped
hox containing a depth of about 2 inches of crumbled decayed wood.
The flannel was dispensed with, and the box was stood inside a cage.
At about 9 inches above the decayed wood was the entrance hole
of the box, and I nailed some pieces of bark on the side leading up
to this. The next day the little parrot climbed up and looked out
of the hole, and for a further two days spent most of its time looking
out. I am sure it was quite capable of climbing out, but lacked
the confidence to climb on to the thin perch I had arranged near the
hole, and so on the morning of 15th November I fixed up a strip
of stout bark across the cage near the hole, and during the afternoon
the bird climbed out. It went back into the box to roost, and at
the time of writing (24th November) it has continued to do so.
During the day, however, it climbs about the wire and the perches,
and only goes into the box to exercise its wings.
It has considerable strength in its beak and has already bitten
off a lot of bark. It has also been eating some shelled monkey nut
and has shelled sunflower seed and eaten some of it, but has not so
far touched any of the other soaked seed which I have put in a
dish hanging on the side of the cage. I think this bird will be
fully as large as its parents when it has finished growing.
The coloration of the back, upper tail coverts, and wings is
Cinnabar green with a bronze shading on the wings; the breast and

under parts are of a lighter, more bluish, green, with none of the
slaty-blue shown by both the parents. The under tail coverts are
of whitish-green, darker towards the centres. The white " cap " is
so far a mere frontal band not more than \ in. in width The
feathers on the top of the head are green with dull blue edges,
and those on the sides of the head are more slate-coloured.
The bastard-wing, primaries, and lateral tail feathers are deep
cobalt blue, but the tail feathers have the inner webs towards the
base of salmon pink. The secondaries are green and blue, and the
central tail feathers are bluish-green. The beak is of bone colour,
with a blackish area on either side of the upper mandible; the
legs and feet are also of bone colour, with the claws black. The
irides are a fairly dark brown.
In spite of the dry heat of the hospital, the feathers are of
excellent quality and are quite glossy.
A curious habit of this little parrot is that of always going into
the box to exercise its wings : it also stands on the perches with a
very upright pose and with its chest expanded as though it fully
expects at any moment to receive a decoration of some kind.

Being the first member of the Avicultural Society of South
Australia to breed the Painted Finch (Emblema picta) I thought
perhaps a few notes on this species and its nesting activities may
be of interest to the readers of your splendid magazine.
The Painted Finch is one of our rarest finches and has for
many years been practically unprocurable, in fact some years ago
it was freely rumoured that the species were extinct. Fortunately,
however, this rumour was exploded this year, by a number of those
rare birds making their appearance from the far north of this
State (South Australia). I quickly secured a few pairs in the early
winter and set about the task of trying to breed them.

H. S. Sewell--Breeding the Painted Finch in Australia 17
It was not until our early spring that the first pair showed
*signs of nesting by taking possession of a small box which I had
partly filled with soft grasses. In this they constructed a domed
nest which they lined with flock and wadding, definitely discarding
feathers. Three white eggs were laid but unfortunately proved to
be unfertile.
The birds were apparently immature, as they were not nearly
in full colour when they first began nesting. An adult male bird
.carries on his chest a broad splash of dazzling scarlet on a black
background together with the usual white spot markings.
They soon laid again, however, and this time I was greeted with
; a little more encouragement, as later they were undoubtedly feeding
young; however, bad luck still persisted. One morning I found
two young birds, fourteen days old, thrown out of the nest, not
through intrusion on my part, but through inadequate feeding
which I later rectified. The third nest was duly completed this
time ; six eggs were laid, five being the usual number. This nest
was a little more open than the previous two, so I could observe the
*eggs without interference to the nest. Sixteen days from the last
*egg the young appeared; nineteen days later three young birds left
the nest; the next day three more made their appearance which
more than delighted me, and proved a grand tonic to my frayed
nerves. One young one, which had appeared weak, died, however,
but the remaining five are remarkably strong and doing well at the
time of writing.
The colouring of the young is as follows : Head, light brown ;
beak, black and very much shorter than that of an adult bird;
"eyes, black, where yellow in the adult; lower back, reddish brown ;
rump, scarlet; extremity of tail feathers, black, edged with red;
wings, light brown; throat, breast, and under parts, black, with
well defined white spots; beneath the throat and extending down
*each side of the body one or two of the young are carrying a few
spots of crimson on the breast, presumably these are male birds ;
the legs, pale biscuit shade.
These finches are not so particular as to their nesting sites as
.are Gouldians, who usually prefer a hollow log. I have one pair of

18 H. S. Sewell--Breeding the Painted Finch in Australia
Painted Finches that have built a rough dome-shaped nest among
some gum branches, and another pair that selected a hanging fern
basket out in the middle of an open flight. They burrowed into the
soil in this and made a cup-shaped nest. Incidentally I am inviting
Mr. Harvey to take a moving film of this pair feeding their young;
being right in the open in an open cup-shaped nest, we have a
splendid opportunity for this experiment as one may observe the
young, which are a few days old, from a distance of 6 feet. But
I am of the opinion that a small nest-box is their favourite site.
I consider these finches to be among the hardiest of our birds as
they prefer to roost out during the cold and wet nights of our
winter without any ill effects. For freshly caught birds I consider
this the supreme test of hardiness.
The song of the male bird, if it could be called such, consists of
a peculiar loud clucking noise.
Their food consists of seeding grasses, sprouted seed, aphis, and
small mealworms.
I am now concentrating on breeding the beautiful Firetail Finch
(Zonseginthus bellus). Unfortunately these delicate little finches
require skilful handling to keep them alive, which is no doubt due
to environment and feeding. The Red-eared Firetail Finch
( Z . oculatus) is somewhat similar, but I trust with our increasing-
knowledge of this species we shall overcome these difficulties soon.
I am interested in all rare finches and waxbills; some of the-
foreign birds I have are Melbas, Violet-eared, Roufous-backed

A PHEASANT WHICH SHOULD HAVE A

The Dark Golden Pheasant (Thaumalea picta var. ohscura)
Though it was known already before the War that there exists
a beautiful colour-variation of the Golden Pheasant (Thaumalea
picta) and the Dark Golden Pheasant ( Th . picta var. ohscura ), the
great majority of bird keepers and lovers are not aware of the
existence of this bird.
So, as the dark variety of the Golden Pheasant is known only in
a small circle of bird lovers, I think my fellow aviculturists will
be glad if I give a short description, as follows :--
The colours of the adult cock are roughly the same as those of
its ordinary relation, but every colour is much brighter and darker ;
its cheeks and throat are black, and the tail, unlike that of the
ordinary Golden cock's net-like design, is provided with wavy cross
stripes. Under the throat a greenish-yellow spot is to be seen, right
down to the crop region. The chief colour of the hen is chocolate
brown, with black spots and stripes as in the ordinary Golden hen.
The colour of the feet of both sexes is olive greenish-brown, but one
may come across some yellow-greenish-footed specimens too. All the
so-called Dark Golden Pheasants, which do not correspond to this
description, are not real, being either ordinary birds or mixtures
of ordinary and dark-colour variations and, as such, quite worth-
less. As most people do not know the bird and so may send off
a wrong consignment in the best faith, the necessary precaution
should be taken on the part of the buyer.
When newly-hatched the chicks of the Dark Golden Pheasant can
easily be distinguished from chicks of the normal type, isasmuch
the down of the chicks is dark brown, the throat having a light, pale
spot, which later disappears.
Some mistaken ideas exist as to the origin of the Golden
Pheasant's dark variation, some contending that it is due to the
intersection of some Colchicus species. But those who have kept
pheasants, and know to a certain extent the laws of crossing, will be

able to establish that this is impossible, because, as in the case of
the not entirely unmixed Amherst, or the continued breeding of
other crossed specimens, some can be found among the descendants
which resemble the original ancestors. In the same way set-backs
should occur in the Dark Golden Pheasants if this theory were true,
though this has never happened. The Dark Golden Pheasant
always remains Thaumalea, both in colour and in form. So it is
absolutely true that it is the result of a mutation, which, however,
is unknown in the wild state. Unfortunately I do not know who
first bred this colour-variation.
It is to be noted that one sometimes finds somewhat lighter
specimens among the Dark Golden Pheasants as well, but they are
still easily distinguished from the ordinary colour shades or from
the mongrels of the ordinary and dark birds. At the further
breeding it is recommended to cross a light hen with a darker cock
and vice versa, else you may discover among the descendent cocks
some specimens with yellowish shade feathers on the belly and side,
and that would certainly be at the expense of beauty. I possess at
present a similar cock, which, being matched with a lighter hen,
presented descendants of a perfect colouring.
The Dark Golden Pheasant belongs to the prettiest of fancy
pheasants, and even those who know the ordinary type are struck
by the first sight of the dark-throated variety. In any case it is
evident that there is an increasing interest in these pheasants on
the part of bird lovers, which is no Avonder, considering that even
its common relation, owing to the cock's call-plays during almost
the whole year, its modesty in feeding, and satisfaction with even
a small place, will always be welcome in the aviaries of bird lovers,
especially in those of the less wealthy bird keepers; and it is only
natural that a bird, prettier than its relation and possessing all its
good qualities, should secure for itself a lasting place with almost
every bird lover.
The chicks of the Dark Golden Pheasant can be reared with the
same easiness as those of its ordinary relation. If properly fed the
fancy plumage will be equally pretty under any climate and there
is no fear that the colours will lose their intensity. Our bird will

to be ideal aviary birds for those who cannot afford luxurious
dwelling places such as are usually arranged for the less acclimatized
rare pheasants.

By Mrs. Wharton Tigar
What a wonderful time the end of May is for aviculturists!
Hope runs high, and we dream of our wonderful successes in
breeding the rarest birds. We see our chimney pieces adorned with
medals won for us by birds bred for the first time in the British
Isles, or even Europe; avicultural enthusiasts are incurable
optimists, and surely it is right that we are, otherwise, I fear, but
few of us could survive.
When May came along, I had a promising collection of the
rarer birds suitable for a London aviary. Among softbills I could
boast of a pair of the Crested Tanager (Tachyphonus cristatus );
these were let loose in a fairly large planted aviary. It took the
best part of the summer to get them into breeding condition, and
just as the time came to move them indoors the cock began to display
to the hen in the evening. Most handsome he looked as he flew to
and fro, and reminded me of a huge red-admiral butterfly in his
colours of red, black, yellow, and white; the hen is a plain little
thing in brown.
I also had a pair of the attractive New Hebrides Zosterops
(Zosterops flavifrons), but I found that they did so much damage to
the foliage of plants in my greenhouse that they had to be caged
again; they were active little creatures, very bright yellow,
especially the cock.
Among finches, I had pairs of the gorgeous Royal Parrot Finch
(.Erythrura cyanovirens regia). They arrived in England in April,
brought over from the New Hebrides by Messrs. Walter Goodfellow
and Shaw Mayer. I never shall forget my excitement when first
I saw them. Unfortunately, owing to difficulties wflth their food and

transport, they were nearly all damaged in flights and tail. I had
first choice of the collection soon after they were landed, and I chose
four of the brightest specimens I could find--my greediness resulted
in all four being cocks ! Afterwards I secured others that turned out
to be hens. When these birds are in full colour there is a very
decided difference in the sexes; the red of the head extends farther
in the cocks, and the hens have green flanks. Their colours
certainly are vivid, with brilliant peacock-blue bodies, bright green
sheen on wings, and red tails and heads. Among the hens I secured
were two that Mr. Goodfellow had hand-reared. These were
delightfully tame and followed me about the aviary; one would
even perch on my hand and eat a mealworm while sitting there.
On the whole, I found the Regias active in the aviary, and the hens
paid frequent visits to the nests, but it went no further. The cocks
utter a sound like a guard's whistle, much the same as the call of
the Red-headed Parrot Finch (E . psittacea).
I secured at least one pair of all the little finches brought back
from East Africa by Mr. C. S. Webb. Among these pride of place
belongs to the Hartlaub's Spotted Waxbill (Mandingoa nitidula
nitidula). No importation of this species had before been reported,
the reason being that these birds are widely distributed, and even
isolated specimens are rare; it is their habit to keep to the thick
tropical undergrowth, and consequently they are very difficult to
locate. In general colour they rather resemble a Green Avadavat,
but are of a more cobby shape; the cock has a bright yellow rump,
orange red cheeks, and black spots on his sides on a white back-
ground; his beak is black, with a red tip, and the feet are brown.
The hen is very similar but altogether paler. When caged, my hen
plucked the cock bare of feathers on back and forehead. In the
aviary they got on well, and were always together; they are not so
retiring in their habits as the Peter's Spotted Firefinch (Hypargos
niveoguttatus), but are like them in many ways. Their call is
similar, and both these species spend most of their time hunting on
the ground for insects. The cock Mandingoa carried grass about,
and once I saw him displaying to the hen in the usual manner,
bobbing up and down, straw in beak, getting closer and closer all

the time. This happened in July, and the hen began to moult soon
after, which put an end to their courtship. Later, if the weather
had not turned so cold, forcing me to remove them indoors, I feel
confident that their fancy would have gently turned to thoughts
of love.
The Red-eyed Crimson-wings ( Cryptospiza reichenowi sanguino-
lenta) are gentle and somewhat retiring in the aviary. My pair
attempted nesting, but the cock sickened suddenly and was only
restored to health by a careful course of mealworms soaked in olive
oil. After this they did not attempt to nest again, although they
were always together.
My pair of Purple Grenadier Waxbills ( Granatina ianthino-
gaster ianthinogaster) were very fit and eager to go to nest from
early in the season but seemed unable to fix upon a site for their
nest; eventually this difficulty was overcome, and they nested three
times. On the last occasion three eggs were laid, but the birds
deserted. When I examined the eggs I found three dead chicks,
nearly ready to hatch.
My greatest hopes were centred all the summer upon a pair of
Pytelia afra-- the Red-faced Waxbill. They were in exceptionally
fine condition and most eager to nest. They started in May and
made the usual domed nest among twiggy dead branches hanging
in the aviary. The nest seemed small for the size of the birds, but
they sat well, and all went merrily until their one youngster was
14 days old, and then one morning I found him dead in the
nest. The birds began again at once and my hopes ran high. But,
alas! the same thing happened and I found three youngsters dead
in the nest when two weeks old. This occurred in all four times.
The last time I removed the three fertile eggs and placed them
under a good pair of Bengalese which had successfully reared
Gouldians and Diamond Sparrows. At exactly the same period the
youngsters died. Each time I supplied every food I knew of for
rearing the young birds, including absolutely fresh ants' eggs. As
these birds nest in the rainy season in the wilds the want of moisture
may possibly have been the cause of these disasters.

Waxbills ( Urasginthus cyanocephalus), and Tanganyika Melba
Finches ( Pytelia melba grotei) did well in the aviary and were easy
to keep in fine condition, but did not attempt to breed. Two other
species, perhaps less well-known, are the Kenya Fi refinch ( La go -
nosticta rubricata hildebrandti ) and the Yellow-bellied Waxbill
(Coccopygia melanotis kilimensis), closely related to the Dufresne's
Waxbill. Both these, though they did well in my aviary, surprised
me by making no attempt to nest.
Against my lack of success in breeding any of these rarer species,.
I had particularly good results with the commoner birds. My
Gouldians and Long-tailed Grass Finches were in excellent form r
and my Diamond Sparrows produced sixteen youngsters in five-
nests !
In conclusion I can only hope that Dame Fortune will favour
me more kindly next year.

The two very dry years which we have just had in Normandy
have been favourable in many ways, but also had their drawbacks
in aviculture; many birds did not lay as well as usual, and the
shortage of insects in the summer was decidedly detrimental to
certain species.
The large flightless birds, Emus and Rheas, have done well;
some thirty white and grey Rheas were raised in 1933, but only
eight in 1934, owing to the loss of the best breeding female. My
Emus and Darwin's Rheas are not properly paired, and naturally
did not breed.
Many Cranes laid clear eggs, but each year three pairs of
Demoiselles nest, always at the same places, very far distant, and
rear their young without difficulty. They are fascinating to watch,
as they are such wonderful parents, catching insects all day long
for their chicks. This year, an old hen Eastern Sams, who never
had produced fertile eggs as long as she had a cock of her own
species, hatched and reared two fine hybrids with an Australian

Crane. They grew very quickly, and at two months of age were
just as big as their mother. One cannot say yet what they will look
like. White-necked Cranes laid unfertile clutches; Crowned
Stanley's, White Asiatic, and Manchurian Cranes did not lay,
although most of them live in pairs in very large paddocks by
themselves.
Waterfowl have done well, although I am afraid that many
eggs have been eaten by Cranes, Brush Turkeys, and other birds
which live at liberty. If accidents overcame to the broods of
Emperor and Ross's Snow Geese, quite a few Ashy-headed,
Cereopsis, Magellan, Blue-winged, and Bar-headed Geese were
reared, and this year three Andean Geese. Sheldrakes have been
particularly successful; in the last two seasons over fifty Paradise,
South African, hybrid Rajah, Ruddy, and Common Sheldrakes
were bred. Ducks were bred in numbers, the rarest being Brazilian,
Green-winged, and Cinnamon Teal, Black-billed, Fulvous, and true
Red-billed ( autumnalis) Tree-ducks, and Madagascar White-eyes.
Game birds, at liberty in the park--Brush Turkeys, Black-
shouldered Peafowl, Wild Turkeys, Silver Pheasants, and Jungle
Fowl--breed plentifully. Among others, we have bred some Manauls,
Blyth's Tragopans (6), Rheinarte's Argus (4), Gemani's Palawan
(4), Bronze-tailed Polyplectrons, Blue Crossoptilons (25), Mikado,
Copper, Edward's, Imperial, and White-crested Pheasants. One
hybrid Koklars (darwini x macroloplix) unfortunately died when
three months old.
One pair of Grey Polyplectrons has produced no fewer than
eighteen young ones in two seasons. Roulrouls were hatched, but not
reared. No rare Parakeets were reared ; only the different Love-
birds; but a good many Pigeons were bred: Nicobar, chrysia,
Bronze-winged, Blue-headed Pigeons, Long-tailed, Jobis, amabilis,
Mourning, Talpacotis, Diamond, Senegal, and this year Galapagos
Doves. Although these w~ere provided with rocks and miniature
caves, they preferred to use small baskets fixed high up in trees.
Of the smaller birds, Madagascar Weavers bred regularly, and
two broods of Hooded Pittas were reared in a greenhouse, as I
have already recorded.

A few notes about my mixed collection of small foreign finches
may be of general interest.
The aviary is divided into two portions, the inner division
being one side of a large wooden building 20 by 4 feet. This opens
into a flight 18 by 8 feet, partly glazed, leaving one end open to the
winds and weather. In the spring I purchased some Cordon Bleus,
Cut-throats, Fire-finches, Avadavatg, Nuns, Bengalese, and Silver-
bills, and last, but not least, some Gouldian Finches. In the spring
I bought fifteen pairs of newly-imported birds. I knew the risk I
was taking, but determined to try the experiment. This particular
lot were indeed very fine specimens, and hopes of success flashed
high in consequence! I had partitioned off one end of the inside
aviary in readiness for these little travellers. It was in a warm
corner near a stove which heated a water-pipe running through
their new quarters.
For two or three days all went well, and they ate well and were
full of song, but on the fourth day one was dead, and the following
day two more, and again another one the next day. I sent up two
of these for a post-mortem, though I knew quite well what the
verdict would be. The same old trouble with all these newly-
imported birds, " pneumonia." A note completed this report:
" Newly-imported birds are a very risky experiment! " Of course,
I knew this, but had determined to see what I could do, but I must
say I felt somewhat depressed, as the survivors almost daily got
fewer !
However, I did not mean to lose heart, and after I had lost
fourteen or fifteen in three or four weeks, there were no more
casualties for a few days, and in fact after this I only lost one more,
and then found I had seven pairs left, in addition to a pair I had
had in a cage in my house for three years. This pair had never
shown any signs of breeding, but now that they had their freedom I
saw that they were continually in and out of the nesting-boxes.
I was also somewhat surprised to see one of the newly-imported birds

going round with bits of grass. Very soon these two pairs had
each a nest of eggs, and to my joy both hatched and reared three
young birds. I have read in various articles that Gouldians cannot
be reared with other birds, but I have not found this to be the
case, as I have bred this year (besides the Gouldians) several nests
of Zebra Finches, Cut-throats, and Gordon Bleus. At the time of
writing (i.e. the 4th November) I have four Gouldians nearly
fledged, and another nest just hatched. On 15th October I shut
all the birds into the inside enclosure, but did not light up
the heating apparatus till the last day of the month, when the
temperature dropped in the night to 39 degrees, but it was quite
cold enough, and I think they all greeted the warmth with
pronounced vigour and extra song. The birds are all strong and in
\0x25A0splendid condition; I put this down to a portion of their diet of
which they are very fond : canary-seed steeped in cod-liver oil. This
seems to keep them healthy and well, and they revel in it. My
original pair of Gouldians have become so tame that the cock
bird will sit on the finger of the man who feeds them when he holds
out a tit-bit for him. I hope now to concentrate more or less on
the Gouldian, as I think few birds come up to this beautiful little
finch, with its exquisite colouring and delightful habits.

The question of the correct feeding of aviary birds seems to be
a source of anxiety to many aviculturists, and as the subject has not
been ventilated, at any rate of recent date, in the Magazine, I venture
to open the subject, with a view of drawing some information which
will be of general use to members of the Avicultural Society.
Every bird keeper has some pet theory, and the sum of them would
be of incalculable value to all interested in the well-being of their birds.
I have been keeping birds for the last twenty years or more, in the way
I fancy most of us do, not so much with the idea of breeding for sale,
but for the pleasure of studying their habits and ways. If some do

breed so much the more interesting, but I make no claim to be a
breeder.
My collection of about 120 is of birds common to most aviaries,.
Canaries, Diamond Doves, Budgerigars, Peking Robins, Whydahs,
Weavers, Grass Finches, Gouldians, Buntings, and Waxbills, etc.
They are divided into hardy and tender. The former are housed
in shelter and flight 30 feet long, 12 feet wide, and 10 feet high, which
is not heated. The latter have a room 15 feet by 12 feet by 10 feet
high, which is maintained at a temperature of not less than 55* Fht.
the year round, and a flight 12 feet square by 8 feet high, and these
are driven in each night winter and summer and include Grassfinches,.
Gouldians, some of the Buntings (Rainbow and Versicolor), and
Waxbills. Now, I have tried many mixings of seed and after
segregating the seeds least acceptable, have for some years used the
following with, so my friends tell me and I think, excellent results.
White millet 561b., small yellow millet 141b., small canary seed
28 lb., groats 7 lb., hemp 2 lb., teazle 2 lb., maw 2 lb., niger 1 lb.
Total 1121b.
I am often asked why I mix such small seeds and small quantities-
of niger, maw, and teazle with the others and not give them in
separate containers. If I did they would be devoured at once by a few
strong birds to the exclusion of the weaker ones. Whereas when mixed
they are obliged to search and scratch to fin&apos;d them. The feeding tables
being of ample proportion (2 ft. 6 in. by 2 feet) there is room
enough and each bird has a fair chance.
The hardy birds, Canaries, Budgerigars, Weavers, Whydahs, etc.,,
have about 25 per cent giant sparies canary seed added to the above
mixture.
A soft food is provided for those birds which will take it, by no
means all, made of Spratt's cod-liver oil, cage-bird food, to which is
added a little Bemax and Atora or shredded suet.
Two tablespoonful of C. L. A. Food is damped to a crumbly
consistency with boiling water ; to this is added a teaspoonful of Bemax
and one of suet and well mixed by stirring with a flat piece of wood or
a fork. This quantity will fill two shrimp pots and in my case is used
up in one day.

Bemax, sold by chemists, is the proprietary name for prepared
germ of wheat, and is one of the chief sources of Vitamin B. I use the
shredded suet because of its convenience, beef suet gratered would
do just as well. Pekings are very fond of this and their coats indicate
the value of the fat in their tightness and shininess.
Now comes the important question of green food. For nine months
out of twelve, there is no trouble to anyone with a garden. Anything
green is acceptable, hence all weeds of whatever description may be
scattered on the floor of the flight. For the three dead months--January,
February, March--when it is often difficult to obtain anything green
except grass, a few sods are given and as pecked bare renewed.
With regard to the floor of the flight I prefer earth to concrete and
then it can be raked over once a week, all rubbish removed, and forked
over every three months where there is bare soil. There is no doubt
birds find lots of interest in soil and about plant roots.
As to water, have it running if you can, and in any case see that
there are no perches immediately over any receptacle containing it for
drinking. I keep a meal-worm box going and supply a few now and
then but not as a regular part of diet.
I hope other members will follow my example and give me the
benefit of their experience.

Mr. J. O'N. Blair writes :--
As a member of the Avicultural Society, I wish to draw your
attention to the death of Mr. S. McGredy, Ashton, Portadown, N.I.
Mr. McGredy was a member of our Society, an ardent Aviculturist,
and a great public figure. He was the head of the famous firm of
S. McGredy &amp; Son, Portadown, whose famous nurseries are known
throughout the world. I think I can safely say they are the largest
rose growers in the world, and the firm have carried off for years
all the premier awards in every country they have exhibited in.
Mr. S. McGredy, who has just passed away, had a very fine
aviary at the nurseries that was a great attraction to all who
visited them, and there were thousands annually. He also had a
fine aviary at his house, " Ashton."
He was a most popular man with everyone; generous and
courteous to all who came in contact with him. He also was a
great breeder of smooth-haired fox terriers, and here again won
premier awards at home and in the principal shows in England.
His loss is a great one in every respect. He was just in the
prime of life, and leaves a widow and three children.
I thought you would care to know these facts.

It was through Mr. McGredy's enthusiasm that I got interested
in aviculture, and there are many interested likewise through
coming in contact with him and seeing the love he had for all his
feathered friends.
He was always most anxious to give advice and assistance to
amateurs who asked for same. Personally, his generosity and
kindness to me, and I am one of many, are never to be forgotten.

DANGER IN DUSTY SAND
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.979544121212121" page_id="56222595"  page_num="31" year="" vol="">
Probably many of us have lost birds at times in circumstances which
baffle us. I had a case in point last year when a Parrot Finch died and the
post-mortem showed pneumonia.
Now this bird had been kept in an aviary the temperature of which
was thermostatically controlled at 60* F. and a maximum and minimum
thermometer was always in the aviary and showed that the temperature
had never been below this. It is a well constructed place, nicely ventilated
but definitely without any draughts. The bird had been in fine form for
quite a time. However could it get pneumonia ? And what could one do
more to prevent a recurrence ?
I venture to suggest that we often invite lung trouble in our birds by the
sand we use on the floors of cages and aviary shelters. Sand consists almost
entirely of silica, and it has been known for a long time that silica dust breathed
into the human lung has a most harmful effect and eventually proves fatal
through silicosis. In industries handling materials with a high silica content
very elaborate precautions are taken by means of ducts to draw away this
fine silica, dust, and compensation to the next of kin has to be paid for deaths
resulting from this cause.
The silica itself is not harmful, of course, unless it is in such fine particles
as to be carried about in the air and these fine particles are most easily air-
borne when it is perfectly dry. Now one of the easiest ways of getting it
perfectly dry is to place a thin layer, as we do, on the aviary floor, and a
certain way of making sure that the silica dust does not lie there, but is wafted
into the air, is to have a number of small creatures with efficient winnowing
implements in the form of wings flying down on to it and rising up from it.
I am informed that in humans the complaint is not easy to distinguish
from the ordinary condition of tuberculosis ; with lungs as small as those of
a bird the task would perhaps be more difficult, or even impossible, but
Mr. Gray would perhaps kindly give us his opinion on this.
However, to avoid the risk certain precautions can be taken. One should
procure a 50-mesh sieve or riddle, and test in a perfectly hone dry state the
sand one uses with this (a 50-mesh sieve is one which has 50 apertures to
the linear inch). One can soon prove to one's own satisfaction that any

grains of sand so fine as to pass through the 50-mesh sieve are capable of
resting in suspension in the air for a long time.
Sand varies considerably in different districts, but there are few that do
not contain a considerable proportion of the harmful fine grains unless these
have been washed out. Washed sand is produced in most parts of the country,
but is not often so thoroughly washed as to eliminate everything below the
50-mesh sieve, so that even if one is using a washed sand regular testing and
sieving will be necessary.
Since I have taken these precautions, I have had no case of pneumonia,
and I feel certain that we have in the sands we use a potential source of
lung trouble.

NEW ZEALAND ZOSTEROPS IN THEIR NATIVE COUNTRY
I have just read Mr. J. W. Taylor's notes on the breeding of the little
New Zealand Zosterops. Curiously enough I had been for a walk through
some bush this afternoon and had found no less than five Zosterops' nests.
We usually call them " Wax-eves " here.
I have noticed that their nests are usually built in a young totara tree
about 4 to 10 feet from the ground. They are not built in a fork of a
branch but are woven into the prickly foliage itself. The nests are all the
same, i.e. moss on the outside with root fibre and horse hairs on the inner
surface.
I think that a branch or two of ordinary yew tree would be very similar
to the totara. I think it is important to have the correct sort of foliage for
them to nest in--I was unable to find a single nest in any trees other than
totara.
I have not bred these little birds myself although I had some for a short
while. I found that they did well on apple, bread and milk, and an occasional
fatty bone.
I have noticed them very busy about one of my apple trees which is
covered with " woolly aphis " and am inclined to think they are very useful
in keeping down blight such as this and rose aphis, etc. They are very tame
and during winter will come to the door to be fed.
I hope that these few notes may be of some help.

(Thamnolrea cinnamomeiventris albiscapulata , Rupp.)
This species was imported a few years ago. I saw four or five
pairs at a dealer's and bought the lot. They were in poor condition
and only two pairs survived, one of which was presented to the
Zoological Society and the other to Mr. C. H. Heal, who, I believe,
still has both birds.
Practically nothing is known of the species in a wild state, but
Mr. C. S. Webb has observed an allied race ( T. c. cinnamomeiventris)
in Portuguese East Africa, which, he says, is only found flitting about
rocks, where its movements are singularly graceful and delightful
to watch. The song is loud and may be heard at a considerable distance.
Strangely enough in captivity I have only heard the female sing.
The Plate gives an altogether excellent idea of the grace of the bird,
the tail being raised and spread partially almost with every movement.
The male has the head, neck, back, upper breast, wings, and tail black ;
the lower breast and abdomen cinnamon, and the scapulars pure white.
The female differs only in having the scapulars black.
The range of the species is from Bogosland to Harrar, and to the
Sudan border at Fazogli on the Blue Nile.

The Sooty Shearwater or &lt;# Mutton Bird " (Puffinus griseus)
[Continued from Vol . XII, page 237)
One of the most interesting periods spent in New Zealand was a
sojourn amongst the " Mutton Bird " Islands in the far south of that
country. Through the kindness of Mr. Corbet, of Invercargill, a member
of the Avicultural Society, arrangements were made for me to go
to Stewart Island and to be picked up there by the owner of a yacht
and to cruise for a period around the islands off the south of Stewart
Island. We were held up for several days at Half Moon Bay, the one
and only settlement on Stewart Island and probably the most southern
township in the world.
The " Mutton Bird ", otherwise the Sooty Petrel or Shearwater,
is an important article of commerce amongst the Maoris of Stewart
Island and the extreme south of the South Island. The small islands
where the Petrels nest have been held by certain families for many
centuries and the right of taking the birds is held by their descendants.
At the beginning of the Southern summer the birds gather from all
quarters of the globe, coming from as far as Greenland, Alaska, Labrador,
and many parts of the Arctic Ocean, traversing many thousands of
miles of ocean spaces and in time arriving at the tiny islands in the
far south where they first saw the light of day. The gathering of the
Petrels from all quarters of the globe is truly one of the greatest of
bird mysteries.
A long burrow is excavated in the loamy soil amongst the dense
scrub which covers the islands. These vary greatly in length, some
being only a few feet long, while others are from 10 to 15 feet in
length, the longer ones being no doubt old burrows in which fresh
excavations have been made each year. It is an amazing thing that
the birds are able to tunnel through the very fibrous mould with their
seemingly fragile beaks and weak legs. The space being so limited,
the same nesting holes are used year after year. Often the entrance
hole is made under the roots of a tree or a fallen log.
The young are hatched about Christmas time and are ready for

the " mutton birders " who arrive about the first week in April,
and immediately take samples of the birds. The Maoris can
usually tell whether the birds are ready by the presence of down
adhering to the roots at the entrance of the nesting hole. This means
that the young one is getting past the downy stage and is coming to
the entrance of the burrow each night to shake the down from the
plumage. Some of the " mutton birders " possess dogs who scent
the birds which are then dug out. Usually the depth of the tunnel
is tested by a long stick and an entrance is dug from above where the
young one is judged to be. The birds are killed by hitting them with
the fist on the back of the skull until it is broken. A heap of birds
are collected and stripped of their body feathers, great heaps of downy
feathers in the bush denoting where the men have been working.
The work is started at 7 a.m. and is continued until 2 p.m., when
each person has collected from sixty to seventy birds, which are then
tied into bundles of ten. Arriving at the hut or place where the work
is done, the birds are dipped into boiling water and the remaining down
plucked off. They are then hung up in bundles and allowed to stiffen,
this is because the birds are so tremendously fat that it is necessary
for them to harden before they can be dealt with. After hanging for
two or three days, the Petrels are taken down, the head, wings, and
tail cut off, the body split out, and the inside taken out. The birds,
or rather what is left of them, are then packed flat into barrels, each
layer being salted. These are then left for two or three days, after
which they are taken out and packed with salt into bags very ingeniously
made out of the stems of a giant kelp, a species of seaweed, which
attains a gigantic size in the seas in the far south. When each bag
is full it contains from 30 to 100 birds, according to the size.
These bags when full resemble great transparent yellowish bladders.
Birds which are small or in poor condition are boiled in their own fat
and also put into the kelp bags. When the sacks, which are pear-
shaped, are full, they are covered with Totera bark and the base is
then placed in a Maori " kit " or bag of woven flax. The birds are
now ready for the market and will last, preserved in this way, for
over twelve months. The price varies from 9 d. downwards. Now 5 \d.
is the price paid per bird to the " mutton birders ".

Sydney Porte?--Notes on New Zealand Birds
The " torching 55 seasons begins about the 2nd May. The young
birds which have not been caught in their holes now come out at
night to preen their plumage and get rid of the down which still adheres
to the plumage prior to taking their first flight to sea. The nestlings
are dazzled by the light of the torches and get too confused to return
to their homes. During this season 300 birds are often taken in a
single night by one man. A family of three people will take from
6,000 to 7,000 birds in a season. One old " mutton birder ", who had
been plying his trade since 1875, told me that the birds were on the
increase, but I can hardly see how this is possible as the birds only
lay one egg in the season. I think he thought I was a Government
inspector, down to make inquiries respecting the protecting of the
birds.
The young birds are fed by their parents during the night only,
upon an oil-like liquid which the young bird vomits up when handled
or frightened. They get enormously fat and are, after a time, deserted
by their parents ; the young birds gradually get thinner until at last,
having got rid of all the down and in perfect plumage and a normal
weight, they then make their way from the nesting holes towards the
edge of the cliffs or rocks, from whence they throw themselves into
the air, and so the adventure of Life starts, and what an adventure
it is ! For nine months of the year they are wanderers on all the
seven seas, never once touching land in all that time.
On one of the islands, I forget its name now, I met an old Maori,
90 years of age, a rare relic of the pre-British area. He explained
to me the old Maori method of procuring the birds, which differed
considerably from the methods employed to-day. The birds after
being hung for two days were boiled in their own fat in an elaborately
carved wooden vessel known as the " Hipu-titi ". It was hollowed
out of a tree-trunk and shaped like a small canoe with a swan-heck
shaped spout at one end for pouring the oil out. The method was
to put into the vessel a certain amount of mutton-bird oil rendered
from the offal of the birds, then the cleaned bodies were placed in this
and the whole brought to a boil by placing red hot stones in the fat.
After a time the bodies were taken out, placed in the kelp bags, and
the whole filled up with oil. Earthen or iron pots were unknown to

the Maoris, neither was salt. The old Maori and his family were some
of the few still practising the old method of killing the birds by bending
the head forward and biting through the spinal column with the teeth.
I was told of albino birds being sometimes found, also more rarely
khaki-coloured ones.
The nest of the birds seemed more plentiful in the dense under-
growth of a peculiar plant superficially resembling rhubarb. It was
impossible to walk through these parts without falling down the holes.
The most remarkable thing is that after the birds have fed the young
ones during the night, they cannot take flight again off the ground
but have to shuffie (these birds cannot walk owing to the weakness
of the legs) through the undergrowth to the edge of the cliffs or rocks
often a quarter of a mile away where they throw themselves into the air.
The nesting habits of the Petrels are one of the most fascinating studies
of any known bird, and the more one studies them the more strange
and mysterious do they appear. Why these birds should gather from
all parts of the oceans to these small islands and go to so much trouble
and spend so many months every year in the process of reproduction
when they could easily nest as Sea-gulls do, for they have no natural
enemies that we know of, is a mystery that we shall never fathom.
During the nesting season the birds keep together in flocks not
far from the coast, though, of course, odd ones are often seen. The
birds during their fishing look exactly like giant Swifts ; they are
the same shape, colour, and their flight is very similar, for the birds
possess the small, narrow, sickle-shaped wings which they flutter in
the same manner as a Swift.
I think a great deal of the food is taken on the wing, for the birds
circle round and round seeming just to skim the surface of the ocean
with their bills. The birds are also able to dive and swim under the
water. Their food consists of low forms of marine life which float on
the surface of the water, plankton, cephalopods, the eggs of various
molluscs, etc. I could write a great deal more about these fascinating
birds, but space forbids.
The New Zealand Zosterops (Zosterops halmaturina)
The little " Silver-eye ", " Blighty ", " Wax-eye ", etc., as it is
variously called in New Zealand, has for many years been the subject

of discussion, firstly on account of its origin and secondly as to whether
it is beneficial or detrimental to the country.
Prior to 1856 the bird was unknown in New Zealand. After that
date small numbers were observed in the South Island which, as time
went on, multiplied exceedingly until at the present time, with the
exception of the introduced Sparrow, it is certainly the commonest bird
in the country. The question arises, how did these birds get to New
Zealand ? It is difficult to think of these fragile little creatures crossing
a thousand miles of ocean without a resting-place. If they did cross
it could not have been by their own efforts, they must have been
either blown over by some strong wind or carried by human agency,
for apart from the effort required they would be unable to subsist
without food for such a length of time. The Zosterops are not migrants
in the true sense of the word, for though they are nomadic in some
countries they never migrate long distances. Then again, it is a
strange thing how these birds which belong to a tropical genus could
manage to acclimatize themselves to a comparatively cool climate
where conditions in winter are often very severe. But be it as it may,
we shall never solve the mystery, like the creation of the world it
will always be a matter of conjecture. That the bird does feel the
severe conditions in the winter there is little doubt, for I have been
told by some of New Zealand's hardy " he-men " who lived in huts
and tents at high altitudes during the winter-time that the birds would
upon occasion crowd into the tents and huts for the little extra warmth
and in one case, when the conditions were very severe, the birds crept
in under the flaps of the tent until the place was simply crowded with
them. This was no joke for the campers, as the mess caused by several
thousands of these birds is very considerable, also they ate every bit
of food left about. In the southern districts the birds will enter houses
in bad weather and consume everything edible, butter, bread, meat,
or anything lying about. Needless to say there must be a very heavy
mortality in hard weather, especially in the far south and in Stewart
Island, though perhaps they would not be so badly affected in the
latter place, which is still covered with the magnificent native
forest.
When hard pressed nothing seems to come amiss to these birds

in the way of food. In fact at all times their appetite is prodigious,
as I have found to my cost.
The New Zealand Zosterops is an exceedingly active and restless
bird. Living in small flocks they pass through the undergrowth
minutely searching every leaf, nook, and cranny for the tiny insects
upon which they mainly feed. On their first appearance in New
Zealand they were looked on as a great blessing, for they speedily
cleared gardens and orchards of all manner of minute insects and
pests, especially the blight upon apple trees. Loud were the praises
sung of these feathered benefactors, but when the birds took payment
for their services, ah, well, that was another thing altogether. We
humans do not mind how much is done for us, but how loath we are
to give recompense, especially when our servants belong to the animal
kingdom. After a while this little bird was reviled on every hand for
the damage it did to the fruit crops. That a flock of these birds can
play havoc with a crop of fruit I have little doubt, for when through
the kindness of a friend in New Zealand I became possessed of fifty
of these birds, I was amazed at the quantity of fruit which they
consumed. Besides a large amount of soft food they devoured at least
half a dozen bananas and about a pound of apples per day, in fact
their food bill amounted to something like #1 a week. In feeding on
the apples, a small hole was pecked in one side and the whole flesh
devoured leaving the skin intact. At first I thought the birds must
dislike apples, as I saw what appeared to be the whole fruit intact,
but on taking it down I soon found my mistake.
The Zosterops are to be found everywhere, from the North Cape to
Stewart Island and from the limit of the alpine vegetation to the
forests which come down to the seashore. In severe weather it is
to be found in gardens, round about houses, and in the centre of the
large cities themselves. During the whole time the flock is moving
about they keep up an incessant twitter, which is exceedingly sweet
to listen to. In fact a large flock of these birds can be heard
from a considerable distance from the shore, providing that the sea
is calm.
The birds have also a very soft, sweet, warbling song. I have never
heard this song from the wild birds, they never seem to have time to

utter it, being too busy searching for their living. But captive birds
I had, when they had finished one of their numerous repasts, would all
start and sing together in a beautiful soft warble, making one of the
most enchanting bird choruses I have ever listened to. I have never
heard single birds sing, neither did the few birds which I eventually
kept. I almost wish that I had kept the whole flock so sweet was
their melody.
In captivity they are charming little birds, always tame and full
of the joy of life ; they always keep in wonderful condition, except if
they begin to pluck each other. In fact I know of no bird more addicted
to plucking its fellows than this one. The strange thing is that the
birds seem to enjoy being plucked.
Some years ago a small consignment of these birds arrived in this
country. New Zealand birds had always been scarce in England, and
it was the first time the Zosterops had been offered for sale, so I was
anxious to get hold of a few. About forty were landed, but in a very
sorry state. When I heard from the person who had purchased them
from the captain of the ship who had brought them over, there were
only six left. I was anxious to have them, but was told that they
were in poor condition, and one of the conditions of the sale was that
I should come up to London and bring them home with me as they
were unfit to stand a long rail journey. Some time elapsed before
I got to town, and by that time very few were left. Well, I got a
shock when I saw them, it was the first time I have ever seen a bird
totally plucked of its feathers and still alive. I have certainly never
seen such derelicts, either before or since. One bird certainly had
about a dozen feathers, but the others were just miserable palpitating
little pink bodies, shivering and drooping with the cold. How they
had lived in that state is a mystery.
I hadn't the heart to leave them, for I knew that in the morning
there would be several little pink and unlovely corpses. As soon as
they were packed up I hurried across London, paying several more
calls for birds, and eventually arrived at the station in the late evening.
Getting into one of the front carriages, I kept on the heat despite the
protests from the other occupants, and arrived home some hours later
on a bitterly cold winter's night, expecting to find in the package

several pathetic little corpses, but though they were nearly " passing
to that last strange change " their frail and wilting little bodies revived
somewhat when placed over a radiator with a temperature of 80 degrees ;
a light was left burning so that they could feed before settling down
for the night. The next morning instead of corpses there were several
very lively little naked bodies, though two of them seemed to be
shaking with a palsy. Each bird was caged separately, fed on ripe pear,
banana, and a good insectivorous food. In each cage was placed a
spray of privet in lieu of perches, which was kept alive by being placed
in a test tube of water, for I am a great believer in live branches helping
to restore a bird when in bad condition. I think it is the Hindus who
speak about " prana ", the life, from the soil which is obtained through
walking barefoot. I think the same sort of thing is transferred to a
bird from the living branches.
Each cage was placed over a radiator, and in a few days each bird
was washed in warm soapy water to get rid of the sticky glutinous mess-
which partly covered their bodies. This gave them another setback
but, after being wrapped in flannel for a while, they recovered. In a
week's time each could boast of about half a dozen pin feathers, they
were brighter, and did not shake so much. I am sure anyone seeing
them at first would have been unable to tell their species. They might
have been plucked Willow Warblers, Wrens, or anything else for that
matter, only their beaks gave any indication that they were at all
Warblerlike. In a few days the white feathers around the eyes appeared
and so in a few weeks the derelicts were saved.
No soul of a lost sinner required as much effort to save as those
frail little lives ! But to me that is the greatest joy of bird keeping,
to restore to health a dying bird.
I find that it is a mistake to feed Zosterops on the usual sunbird
food, that is the Mellin's, honey and milk. It is too stimulating, and
in time seems to affect the bird's brain, and they become mentally
deranged. It is certainly useful as a " pick-me-up " for these birds
after a long voyage, but should not be continued for long. A good
insectivorous food and plenty of ripe fruit is all that any species of
Zosterops require. Plenty of water is necessary, for they are great
bathers. In dry weather in New Zealand one usually sees crowds

around any available little pool, bathing and making a very thorough
toilet.
These Zosterops, like most other New Zealand birds, are quite
tame and fearless when at liberty.
The nest is a frail but beautiful little cup-shaped structure, and is
fastened to the branches of a small shrub by the edges. Usually there
is little attempt at concealment. Three blue eggs are usually laid, very
much resembling those of a Hedge Sparrow ; the young are hatched,
grow up, and leave the nest in an incredibly short space of time.
This species is found in South Australia and Tasmania.
The Rock Wren (Xenicus gilviventris)
One of my reasons for going into the Southern Alps of New Zealand
was to see and make a study of the Kea and the Rock Wren. My
efforts to make the acquaintance of the latter bird were thwarted,
owing to an attack of bronchitis, when I was in the very regions where
it was found, in fact I could plainly see its habitat as I lay in bed
watching the fleeting shadows of clouds as they darkened the immaculate
white face of Mount Cook. So all my information is second-hand,
obtained from the alpine guides and from a distinguished lady
mountain climber.
These hardy birds inhabit the regions of alpine scrub just below
the snow line between 5,000 and 7,000 feet, and are in fact seldom
seen below that altitude. Around the Aimer Hut at a height of
6,700 feet this bird is plentiful and is exceedingly tame, coming within
a few feet of the traveller and picking up scraps of food thrown to it.
It is a peculiarly built bird, rather resembling a very compact Dipper
with a very short and stumpy tail. It also has the peculiar bobbing
motion of that bird. It is entirely terrestrial, living amongst the
rocks and sparse alpine scrub. How it manages to find enough insect
life to sustain itself in those inhospitable regions is rather a mystery.
In the winter I dare say they feed to a large extent upon insects
which they find in a state of torpor in the crevices of the rocks. That
these birds are extremely hardy goes without saying, or they could not
brave the severe storms which rage in the high Alps in the winter time,
for from information gathered it would seem that the bird never

descends below its usual habitat no matter how severe the weather
conditions.
I was told that the bird was often seen examining and pulling to
pieces the flowers of the mountain ranunculus, no doubt in search
of insects.
Mountain climbers tell me that it is a most attractive creature
and looked on with favour by all those who enter its domain. The
only danger to this species is from wild cats, which I have seen at a
height of from 4,000 to 5,000 feet: they would make short work of
these interesting birds should they reach the districts where they live.
Being of feeble flight and of a very confiding nature, it would stand
no chance whatever. Already one interesting species of New Zealand
Wren has been entirely exterminated by cats, the Stephen Island

In a wild state the Guttural Finch congregates in small flocks
in open country, particularly along river banks where there is abundance
of grass, on the seeds of which it subsists. It is a familiar bird, coming
quite close to houses, and it sings continually. The nest is usually
placed in a low bush and is somewhat loosely made of grass stalks.
The clutch is said to consist of two eggs, pale greenish white in colour,
marked with various shades of brown.
The Guttural is quite freely imported and is a most charming
bird in captivity. It is hardy, pretty, very good tempered, and a
delightful songster. In an aviary it is inclined to be rather retiring
if there is any cover available. It has been bred occasionally, for the
first time in this country by Page in 1912. A German aviculturist
obtained eggs from a cross between the hen Guttural and cock White-
throated Finch.
Collared Finch (S. cucullala)
Male. --Upper surface black with shoulders and lower back grey,
the latter washed with ochre ; rump, a deep ochre brown ; upper
tail coverts, blackish edged with dark grey ; lores with a creamy buff
spot ; ear coverts and feathers round eye, black with a creamy buff
spot below the fore-part of eye ; cheeks and throat, creamy buff washed
with ochre ; sides of neck rich ochre, extending backwards so as almost
to form a collar ; fore-neck with a broad black band ; chest and
under surface, pale tawny buff ; thighs white, black posteriorly ; wing
coverts, black with grey edges ; inner lesser coverts and tips of inner
median coverts, bright ochre ; rest of wing feathers, black edged with
grey ; inner primaries externally white at the base, forming a white
wing spot ; under wing coverts, white ; tail feathers, black edged and
tipped with brown ; irides, brown ; bill, horn grey, with a dark base
and yellowish tip ; feet, pale horn colour.

The Collared Finch has been occasionally imported, but not, I think,
of recent years. A pair bred with Dr. Buss, laying two eggs in a small
deep nest built in a bush. Two would appear to be the regular number
for the clutch with Sporophilse. It is a peaceable, good-tempered
species and it possesses a pleasant soft little song.
The Southern Collared Finch (S. collaris) is included in Neunzig
and Buss as being occasionally imported. It is also in the Zoo list,
possibly in error for cucullata. The male differs from cucullata in
having the upper surface, sides of neck and rump, whitish, and the
lower back and thighs ashy grey. For all practical purposes the
female is probably indistinguishable, but is differentiated by being
more sandy above and more tawny below, with the wing spot formed
by the bases of the inner primaries a more yellowish white. Curiously
enough collaris is said to be a much finer songster than cucullata.
It comes from South-Eastern Brazil.
Black-banded Finch ( S. torqueola)
Male. --Crown, nape, neck, mantle, and back, black; rump,
cinnamon brown ; throat, whitish ; a black band across the fore-neck ;
a large patch of white on the sides of the neck forming a half-collar ;
cheeks and under surface, pale rufous buff ; thighs white, black
posteriorly ; wing feathers, black with a white patch at the base of
the outer web of the inner primaries ; tail feathers, black fringed with
pale brown ; iris, brown ; bill and legs, blackish.
Out of season, all the black feathers become edged with brown,
and the white half-collar is tinged with sandy buff.

This pretty little species was first imported in 1895, and was formerly
very rare. This year, however, at least two large consignments have
been imported and at present there must be a good many examples in
the country. The Black-banded Finch is also known as the White-
collared Finch and the Cinnamon Bumped Seed-eater. It is rather
a nervous little bird, but is hardy and absolutely harmless. The cock
which I possess allows itself to be bullied by almost anything. It
has a quiet but pleasant little song, which is, however, very rarely
uttered.
I have had four females presumably of this species that all varied
a good deal in colour. Although they could not very well have been
anything else, they were all much darker than the skins at the Museum.
Some of the " hens " that I saw for sale were yellow-billed birds,
undoubtedly the immature cocks of some other species.

In a wild state the Moreleti Finch inhabits farmland, frequently
consorting with Jacarini Finches. It is common near houses and is a
friendly bird. Seeds, berries, and insects are eaten, and it breeds in
January and February, building an open nest low down in thick bushes.
The clutch consists of two or three greenish-white eggs with brown
markings, and the hen alone incubates.
It is occasionally imported, but is quite one of the most delicate
Sporophilse. It is probably confused at times with the Black-banded
Finch, which it somewhat resembles. Mrs. Wharton-Tigar exhibited
a cock at the Palace two years ago, but it did not live for very long.
The one specimen I have had only lived a week. It might possibly
prove easier if fed principally on insectivorous food.
Rufous-collabed Finch ( Sporophila rujicollis)
I can find no description of this extremely rare Finch. There is
only one skin at the British Museum, that of a not fully adult male,
and I have not had an opportunity of taking a description of this.

The one and only example of this Finch which has ever been
imported came into the possession of Captain Hammond about 1930.
It was a pretty little bird, and its owner kept it for several years in
perfect health and condition. Although I saw it several times it was
in the days before I was interested in Sporophilse, and I can remember
nothing about it. It is unlikely that such an extremely rare bird will
ever again be imported save by accident.

This delightful species, which always puts me in mind of a miniature
Bullfinch, is very common in its native land and ought to be freely
imported. Unfortunately this is not the case and it only comes to
this country very rarely. I believe that it is more commonly imported
to the Continent, where perhaps its charms are better appreciated.

Mrs. Wharton-Tigar brought over quite a large number from Brazil
last year.
When newly imported the Reddish Finch is inclined to be delicate,
adult cocks to a greater extent than immature birds. Once acclimatized
it is quite hardy. In a cage it becomes very tame, and as it is a fine
songster, a single cock makes a charming pet bird. It is good tempered
though inclined to bully closely related birds. A fine male in my posses-
sion which in a flight cage severely persecuted a Black-banded Finch,
has in a smaller cage been quite put in his place by an immature
Fire-finch.

By Capt. C. Scott-Hopkins
It is some time since I wrote an article on Fancy Pheasants in this
Magazine. It is so seldom that one reads anything on these delightful
birds in the Avicultural Magazine, that I feel sure there must be
many Pheasant enthusiasts who long to see an article on this most
interesting subject. It is not often that I put pen to paper for the
public to read, as I do not like publicity, but on this occasion I really
feel that the delightful and fascinating hobby of keeping Fancy
Pheasants should be brought more fully to the attention of the bird-
loving public.
My friend, Mr. P. Lambert, is writing weekly articles on Ornamental
Pheasants in Cage Birds, thereby doing his best to interest the public
in this hobby. He has been the means of stimulating the public
interest in Pheasants and he tells me that the demand for these birds
has increased tremendously ; and what is more, the intelligent interest
that people are taking is most encouraging. Mr. Lambert's expenses
in stamps alone, in answering the many questions he is asked, is
astounding.
I feel that a description of my collection and my experiences
published in the Avicultural Magazine will catch the eye of still
more enthusiasts who are wavering and wondering whether it is worth
while to sink a little money in this venture, or just be satisfied with

reading about them and wondering if what is said about these wonderful
birds from time to time is really true. Yes, every word that is put
in print describing their beauty and attractiveness is true. But it is
quite impossible to describe them on paper. One must see to believe,
and then I am sure that many will not be able to resist the fascina-
tion and longing to own a pair.
I feel that I can talk with a little real experience behind me. I have
kept these birds for many years and I think I am safe in saying that
I have the finest private collection in Great Britain. I have kept in
my aviaries nearly every known variety of Pheasant. Unfortunately
there are some of the very rare varieties which it is exceedingly difficult to
replace when they die, partly because they are rarely exported and
the price is too high. There are over thirty species that one could keep
if one includes the commoner varieties, such as the Ring-necked, Black-
necked, Melanistic Mutant, etc. I have kept all these, but I cannot
spare the aviaries now. My present collection includes the following :
Silver, Golden, Amherst, Reeves, Bels, Pure White, Edwards, Soem-
mering, Elliot, Swinhoe, Monaul, Chinquis Peacock Pheasant, Germain,

Crestless Eireback, Rheinart Argus, Malay Argus, etc.
I have had Bulwer's Pheasant and the Palawan Peacock Pheasant,
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.993183" page_id="56222622"  page_num="52" year="" vol="">
both very rare birds, and the Imperial, also very rare. The White-
crested and Black-crested Kaleege Pheasants are rather dull
coloured birds, so I do not keep them now. The Cheer Pheasant,
which I have seen but never possessed, is also rather dull in plumage
but a nice tractable bird. The Koklass, which I have also seen but never
kept, is an attractive bird and very pretty, but I am told they are
not too easy to keep alive in this country. These two varieties are
not easy to procure as they are seldom exported. I hope, however, to
be able to find them soon.
Many of these Pheasants are beyond the purse of most fanciers, but
there are very many beautiful Pheasants that can be purchased at
a low price. Goldens, Silvers, Amhersts, Bels, Reeves, and Swinhoes
are easily obtainable at a price well within the means of most people
who are desirous of starting this hobby. Pure Lady Amhersts are very

difficult to find and anyone who is fortunate enough to be in possession
of pure birds should do his best to keep them pure. I think for
beauty and gracefulness the Amherst takes top place. My
favourite is the Satyr Tragopan. His colouring is superb and he
becomes so tame in a very short time. I think the Reeves and the
Elliot are the most timid of all Pheasants, although my Elliots are
exceptionally tame. Do not run away with the idea that Fancy
Pheasants are on the whole delicate. I think, perhaps, it is this
fear that prevents many people from keeping them. They are
very hardy. The only two varieties which may require a little
extra care during the winter months are the Argus and the Palawan
Peacock Pheasant. I have had two pairs of the latter (imported)
and I have never been able to keep them alive for long. They are
truly delightful little birds, being the most beautiful and the rarest
of the Peacock Pheasants. They are only found on the island of
Palawan in the Philippines.
All my Pheasants roost out in the open throughout the winter.
The house, with which each of my aviaries is provided, is used
far more during the summer, as Pheasants do not appreciate the
midday sun and prefer to be in the shade. My aviaries are
12 yards long by 4 yards wide and about 6 feet high. I have ever-
green trees in every aviary to provide shelter and a pretty appear-
ance. Each aviary has a scratching shed. Some are gravel
mixed with sand and some are grass. I am not going to say which
are preferable, because both have their good points. It is much
easier to keep gravel aviaries clean and sweet. I rake mine every
week and once a year I put fresh gravel down. Grass aviaries
are more natural and look very nice as long as the grass lasts. It
will not last long with Monauls. I should always advise match-
boarding allround the sides of aviaries as Pheasants are very pugnacious
birds, especially during the breeding season. It will increase fertility and
save many a beautiful tail from being broken. Always have plenty
of shelters in your aviaries for the hens to take refuge in. Woe betide
any Amherst hen who cannot escape from the male bird. This is a
very important point to remember.

turn into real fiends when the breeding season draws near. I keep
Silky Bantams to sit on the eggs. They are light, very good mothers,
and will sit on the hard high road when broody. I do not recommend
Game Bantams for, although they are good mothers and splendid
foragers, it means instant death for any other chick to enter her coop.
I know from experience. The only Pheasants I allow to sit on their
own eggs are the Peacock Pheasants. If a hen Pheasant will sit, let her,
but take away the first three lots of eggs she lays (six eggs in all),
and let her sit on the seventh and eighth.
Do not put any other Pheasants with the Peacock Pheasant tribe
or you will lose them. They are most pugnacious little creatures, but
at the same time most attractive.
I feed my adult Pheasants on wheat, crushed maize, and dari, with
a little buckwheat and hemp thrown in, mostly during the winter.
Be sparing with your maize in the summer. You will find that Pheasants
eat far less than poultry, except,perhaps, the Silver, which I think eats
twice as much as any other Pheasant. Pea-nuts they love ; I give
these as an extra delicacy. Plenty of green food is essential. Lettuce
and dandelions in the summer and cabbage in the winter. Fresh water
every day ; don't be content with just giving them fresh water, but
first run your hand round the inside of whatever you put your water
in, to clean it before replenishing it. A little Condy's Fluid is advisable
in the water once a week. Fruit such as bananas, apples, and grapes
are greedily devoured ; Argus Pheasants must have bananas every
day. Some people give them raw meat, I believe they do at the London
Zoo, and very well they thrive on it.
When building your aviaries be sure that Sparrows cannot get
in or your corn bill will soon double itself ! Just give your birds enough
to eat and no more. I hate to see com lying about the aviaries.
I hope that what I have said will encourage still more people to
go in for this delightful hobby. Just try it, you will not regret it.

By Dr. E. Hopkinson, C.M.G., D.S.O.
The following record of the last few years breeding, though con-
taining nothing remarkable, is perhaps of interest as showing what
I rather think is the average happening in the ordinary aviary.
The aviaries were started about 1929 with a house 10 by 12 feet
and a flight about the same size ; the following year a larger aviary
with only box shelters measuring about 15 by 15 feet was added and
this extended to about double the size in 1933. Besides there are
about six small aviaries (movable) each with ground space of about
18 to 20 square feet.
Budgerigars. --1931 : Four pairs nested ; a good many young
reared and most disposed of. 1932 and 1933 : Much the same results.
1934 : Started with three pairs ; only five young birds hatched out,
of which four were reared and they are not good ones.
Lovebirds (Fischer's-Masked Hybrids).--1932 : One pair nested ;
nine young reared. 1933 : Two pairs nested ; nine young reared again,
one of which showed signs of being partly Peachface, a hen of which
shared the aviary. 1934 : Only two hybrids left; in the autumn of
1933 I thought I had kept a true pair of the hybrids and a hybrid
cock and a hen Peachface. The last and one of the hybrids died in the
winter and the two remaining have done nothing in the nesting line.
I expect both are hens.
Greenfinches. --1932 : One pair had two nests and one young
one left the nest from each, but only one was alive in November, and
still survives. 1933 : Two pairs nested, six young left the nest, three
alive in November. 1934 : Two pairs nested, twelve young left the nest ;
nine still alive and well over the moult in October when they were
moved to an aviary to themselves. Then they began to die, going
light one after the other till only three were left, which were returned
to the big aviary, where they and the parents still survive. One of
each of the 1934 parents was aviary-bred here, the cock in one case,
the hen in the other.

Dr. E. Hopkinson--Breeding Results at Balcombe
Canary hatched from two nests. One still alive. 1933 : The same.
1934 : No young, but the two earlier mules still flourishing.
Alario Finch. --1932 : One mule, Alario X Green Singing Finch,
reared and still alive, December, 1934. It is an ugly all-brown bird,
more like a hen Alario than anything, but cannot be that, as this
cock is the only bird of the species I have ever had.
Yellow Sparrow. --One pair 1934, three nests. First, eggs only ;
second, three young hatched, which when about ten days old and
showing three long clamouring necks and fat bodies died from neglect,
and having a third nest built over them ; from this one young bird
flew in October and is still alive and indoors for the winter.
Grey Cardinal and Popes. --A very old cock Grey Cardinal
which I have had since 1922 and which has been twice to Africa and
back was given two hen Popes in 1932. Two well-made nests were
built (mostly the work of the cock) and two clutches of eggs laid, both
hens sitting a little, but not for long and nothing resulted. 1933 :
Only rough nests and an odd egg or two. 1934 : Neither nests nor any
inclination to breed, but the three old birds still thrive.
Cordon Bleus. --1930 : Seven survivors of birds I had brought
from Gambia, five cocks and two hens. 1932 : Three survivors, all
cocks and all at least five years old. 1933 : One paired with a new
hen : eggs only. 1934 : A new pair built three nests and laid three
clutches of eggs but none hatched, or, if any did hatch, only lived a
day or so.
Zebra Finches. --1932 : One old pair and two young hens. The pair
had young hatched but killed by a Budgerigar. 1933 : Two pairs ;
both nested; about a dozen young left the nest but only three of
the young were alive in November. 1934 : Two pairs nested, one in
the big aviary with a crowd of other birds, one in a small aviary to
themselves. Many hatched and fourteen young flew ; nine young and
the two old pairs still alive, December. One of the pairs had two
nests of four young in each, but in each family there was one deformed
bird with no bastard-wing, which soon died.

THE DARK GOLDEN PHEASANT

<bodyText confidence="0.978414444444444" page_id="56222627"  page_num="57" year="" vol="">
In last month's issue of the Magazine there appeared an account of the
Dark Golden Pheasant ( obscura ). This article is of course very interesting,
but considering that the form is purely an artificial one, may I as a member
of the Society suggest that too much prominence be not given to these forms ;
I say this because already with nearly every change of blood these varieties
crop up and spoil the true T. picta. Further, that being in the same category
as White Mice, White Pigeons, and Canaries, they are rather outside the scope
of this Magazine.

BREEDING THE LINNET

<bodyText confidence="0.986128083333333" page_id="56222627"  page_num="57" year="" vol="">
In the December issue of the Avictjltural Magazine I note that Dr.
E. Hopkinson in his Breeding Records asks if there is any really good record
of the Linnet having been bred.
I have been a breeder of British birds since 1923, and during the period
from this date have bred at different times the following : Linnets, Bull-
finches, Lesser Redpolls, Chaffinches, Yellowhammers, Greenfinches, Gold-
finches, and Siskins.
At the present moment I have the following young birds just finishing their
first moult: four Greenfinches, four Linnets, three Lesser Redpolls, all fit
and in fine health.
The four Linnets are ringed as follows : 7-5-34, 11-5-34, 28-7-34, 2-8-34.
I have had three nests from parent birds, the cock being 2\ and the hen

By this further letter of mine you will be thinking no doubt that they
will never end. The fact is, however, that I have discovered another point
relative to the breeding of the Emblema picta which I think is worthy of
note. If so, you may add to my former article.
The hen bird leaves her young at night from ten days old, unlike the
Gouldian Finch they are not night feeders. I have observed these facts from
a nest built right in the open flight in a hanging basket (fern); the young have
practically no protection other than a sheet of iron directly above the cup-
shaped nest to protect it from rain.
The last few days from the time of writing the weather has been particularly
cold and wet, and I fully expected the young to have perished, but such was
not the case. The hen, however, is to be found on the nest first thing in the
morning, possibly to revive the young a little as they were showing just the
first traces of pin feathers. I consider their resistance to the cold most
remarkable ; this apparently rough treatment to their young no doubt accounts
for the hardiness of this species.

Most of the nests of these birds are dome-shaped and the young would
not be exposed to the extent of the unusual nest I have depicted. I have
observed other nests of this species and have found that they abandon their
young at nights from ten to twelve days after hatching. The crops of the
young are well filled at dusk.
I trust these final notes will be of some value to you.

SUNBIRDS WINTERING IN THE OPEN
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.944373" page_id="56222628"  page_num="58" year="" vol="">
It may interest aviculturists to learn that I have two Sunbirds in unheated
out-of-door aviaries. They are Nectarinia tacazze jacksoni and Cinnyris
mediocris usambaricus. The former was out all the summer, but the latter
was only put out in November. Both birds are in fine condition and roost
out each on a bare twig in all weathers. Cold and wet have no effect on
them at all, and on the worst days they may be heard singing as soon as
it is light and throughout the morning.
I have no doubt that many species are equally hardy and will do well
all the year round out of doors. Indeed, last winter I turned a specimen
of JEthopyga seherce seherce into an unheated, unsheltered aviary in January,
where it was quite unaffected by frost on the very first night, although it
had previously been kept in a warm greenhouse. It did well until it made
its escape in the early Summer.
Certain Humming-Birds, too, would very probably winter in the open
in a sheltered aviary.

I have had several pairs of these handsome birds for some years,
but as they are kept in a garden of less than an acre, with Sarus,
Demoiselle, and Stanley Cranes, as well as Swans, Geese, Ducks, a few
antelope and a large elephant tortoise, I never dreamt that they would
breed under such difficult conditions. One pair nested last year but
the young were not reared owing to an accident. This year the first
two eggs were not hatched, but the second two both hatched out.
One of the young was a weakling and did not live long, and was killed
and eaten by rats. The other one was a healthy, strong bird, and was
well looked after by the parents. To protect this one from rats, I
had a very powerful electric lamp burning all night in their pen, and
this I am pleased to say, was most successful. The light also attracted
a good many insects, which the parents caught and fed the young bird
on. The young Crane is six months old now, and is fast coming into
colour. He is fed on hard-boiled eggs, grasshoppers cut up, boiled rice,
gentles, cockroaches, mixed grain, and breadcrumbs. He is perfectly
tame, and feeds from the hand. I am delighted at my unexpected
success, and wonder if this Crane has ever been bred and successfully
Teared in captivity.
[The breeding of this Crane is an achievement, although it may have
been bred on the Continent.--A. C.]

I have just set myself the pleasant task of reading the Avicxjltural.
Magazine from 1894 to 1930. After a rapid perusal of the later volumes-
I find that the species in which I am greatly interested are not always,
discussed at length as regards the feeding. Whereas the species in
which I am not greatly interested, have full details ! However, by the-
time I have read thirty-six volumes I shall have found what I require.
Meanwhile a few notes as to my own way of feeding may be of
interest.
Firstly, however, I have only kept Foreign Birds for just two years,,
so that I am far from being able to dogmatize.

eaten, therefore I provide a separate dish of Indian millet. After
three months they have just commenced to eat soaked oats. These-
are soaked for 48 hours, approximately two teaspoonsful are provided
daily. Groundsel is the only green food appreciated. Apple provided
daily, but still untouched. I live in hopes ! Fresh water daily. A
fair amount of cuttlefish is eaten but no grit, no doubt sufficient of
this is found on the groundsel roots.

I once watched the hen practically walk through some very light
netting in a way which made me think my cutters must be blunt !
Lovebirds
At present only Fischers are kept. I have had Masked, Blackcheeked,
and Peachfaced. The Peachfaced were only retained for three months.
They all had, and the Fischers still have, access to sunflower and hemp
mixed, canary, and white millet. Millet sprays occasionally given.
Soaked oats daily. Fruit is eaten spasmodically, sometimes none is-
touched for six or eight weeks. Groundsel is the best liked of all the
green foods. An orange seems to be appreciated more in summer.
Lovebirds do more damage to their aviary than the Alexandrines.
The aviary is also 17 X 4 |X 7 feet high. I have been very lucky in
the past when I mixed some pairs of Lovebirds, i.e. Fischers and
Masked, in a large aviary with small Finches. Provided they had
branches and canary travelling cages to bite up, no damage was done,
but it was hopeless in a small aviary 6 feet square.
The question of supplying sunflower and hemp ad lib. was very
debatable. However, I thought that if Primley Zoo could do it, I
could ! I never found my birds excessively fat when in a large aviary.
In the small 8x6 aviary I lost three Blackcheeks in quick succession
from being over fat. When supplying hemp in a separate dish, Love-
birds have a spell of eating large quantities of it and then eat very little
for a while.

SOME BRITISH BIRDS IN NEW ZEALAND
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994259714285714" page_id="56222640"  page_num="62" year="" vol="">
By S. D. Potter, Editor Avicultural Society of New Zealand
Towards the end of last century a veritable epidemic set in to
introduce and establish in a wild state alien species of birds.
The principal driving force behind most of these liberations is not
hard to find. With the opening up of the country vast areas of virgin
forest were cleared, and, as nearly all the native land birds are forest
dwellers, they retreated with the forests before the onslaughts of
colonization. Consequently these newly cleared lands were practically
birdless and therefore had no natural checks on the various insect
plagues which periodically descended upon them.
In all, some 130 species were liberated either by Government
Departments, private individuals, or Acclimatization Societies. But
of this total (perhaps fortunately) no more than thirty have become
really established.
Many of these introduced species were chosen for their usefulness, |
but others were to provide sport, or for sentimental reasons, and some i
for no apparent reason at all.
In the maift these feathered aliens have behaved well. They are, I
generally speaking, confined to the cultivated areas and, never pene-
trating far into the forests, do not encroach upon the somewhat restricted j
strongholds of the indigenous birds.

Two-third of the successful species hail from Britain but actually
some of these are decidedly rare and local.
The Cirl Bunting, for instance, had not been recorded for some
years until in 1934 an unblown egg was handed to me, which undoubtedly
belonged to this species. The Bullfinch and Linnet after a decided
increase have now practically disappeared. In fact, the former is
probably extinct. The Bedpoll is now making rapid strides and like
the Hedge Sparrow slowly but surely extending its range northward.
The Starling has multiplied at a phenomenal rate and is now un-
doubtedly the commonest bird in Hew Zealand to-day. This increase
is all the more remarkable when we consider the acute housing problem
of this bird. With few exceptions colonial dwellings do not provide
nesting sites for birds, neither are there old ruins, suitable cliff faces,
or a plentiful supply of old timber in the cleared areas where the Starling
abounds.
In rural districts we find that rabbit-burrows, especially those in
banks or roadside cuttings, are the most favoured sites, closely followed
by rural mail-boxes. Even those adorned with a loose flap over the
slot are not proof against the Starling when he is house-hunting. He
just lifts up the flap and hops in. To come out he has only to push
against it.
I once discovered a nest in a thick box-thorn hedge. It is an untidy
and loosely constructed affair which was only held together by the
density of the surrounding twigs. However, a brood of. youngsters
was safely reared therein. It would be interesting to know if the
Starling has been forced to adopt an " open " nest in Britain.
With most farmers the Starling is considered a friend. It haunts
areas where the grass-grub is prevalent and also devours the cattle-tick.
In orchard districts, however, he is becoming a nuisance and before
very long the vast numbers of this bird may become a serious problem.
Once the breeding season is over it is a wonderful sight to see huge
armies of Starlings winging their way across the sunset sky to a common
roost. There used to be (and may still be) one of these favoured
spots near Arapuni where flock after flock would arrive calling as they
alighted, while those already there joined in until one had to shout
to be heard above the din.

S. D. Potter--Some British Birds in New Zealand
In addition to the insects already mentioned the Starling, in Auckland
at any rate, has acquired a decided taste for snails, and cracks their
shells in the same manner as a Thrush, but lacks the expertness of that
bird, and does not return with each victim to a favoured stone.
The Thrush and Blackbird are both firmly established and the former
is highly esteemed both as a songster and for the good he does. Although
the Thrush undoubtedly does some damage to fruit, he is by no means
the raider the Blackbird is. Consequently every orchardist's hand is
against the latter, but his natural wariness and cunning stand him
in good stead and he increases in numbers just the same.
In and about many of the larger towns and in most country districts
as well are small areas of " bush ", a few acres in extent, known as
" reserves ". These areas are not sufficient to support native bird life
and being usually far removed from the forest areas are rarely visited
by them. It is in these reserves that the Thrush and Blackbird carry
on the work normally done by the indigenous species. Plants, such as
the fuchsia, coprosma, and other berry- and drupe-bearing plants, de-
pend upon birds for the dispersal of their seeds. And in these areas
a marked increase in the plants of these families is to be seen.
Unfortunately they also disperse the seeds of that terrible weed
the blackberry as well. And it is a common sight to find young plants
growing in the nests soon after the youngsters have flown.
On the mud-flats thrushes may be seen hammering the shell from
the back of a winkle on a rock just as they do from snails in the garden.
When one realizes how hard the shell of a winkle is, one cannot but
marvel at the power of this bird in breaking it.
The Greenfinch, Chaffinch, and Goldfinch are all firmly established,
especially the latter. Goldfinches may be said to be abundaot. Flocks
of two or three hundred are by no means uncommon during the winter
when bands scour the countryside for weed-seeds. The Greenfinch is
more thinly dispersed while the Chaffinch is the most local of the three.
The Pheasant is a common object of the New Zealand countryside,
though of recent years a marked decline in its numbers has been
apparent.
The decrease originally coincided with the use of rabbit poison.
Pheasants entirely disappeared from districts where previously they

had been common, and since then in spite of annual liberations, closed
.areas, and limited " bags " in the shooting season, they have never
recovered.
In New Zealand only cock Pheasants are shot, the hens being pro-
tected by law. I very much doubt if this policy is altogether wise, as
in many districts there are far too many hens for the number of cocks,
the result being very poor broods of young. And I know of one definite
instance where an old matron, presumably well past the breeding age,
wilfully destroyed the eggs of a more fortunate lady.
Judging by the contents of the various pheasants I have examined,
insects appear to be their principal food, especially grass-grub, grass-
hoppers, crickets, and, in a lesser degree, wood-lice. Of the wild fruits,
blackberry and cape gooseberry seem to be the most sought after.
One curious trait I found with the Pheasants in New Zealand, they
.almost invariably roost on the ground ! The reason for this I cannot
ascertain.
The Grey Duck, which is the commonest native duck, inhabits the
larger areas of water during the non-breeding season. Consequently
those interested in shooting clamoured for a bird that would dwell
all the year round in any little creek or stream. In due course the
Mallard was introduced as the answer to their prayer.
It is with some hesitation I include the Mallard in the present
article as its establishment is something of a joke on the one hand and
a tragedy on the other. Within a fortnight of their liberation in the
Auckland Province almost every bird was feeding in somebody's back-
yard. They were caught up and again released. But they resolutely
refused to be turned out into the hard, cold world when there was food
in plenty in the nearest fowl-yard.
However, at last some evidently lost themselves and became
established in the wild state but, although they were not averse to the
little creeks and streams during the breeding season, they agreed with
the native Greys that the larger waters were much more desirable
during the shooting season. In fact, so closely did they adopt the
habits of the Grey that the two have now commenced to hybridize
and, if the powers that be continue to liberate Mallards, New Zealand
lakes are likely to be populated with a race of mongrels.

The Skylark is very common in the open country, and except perhaps
in grain-growing areas and in market gardens does very little damage.
This bird was presumably introduced for sentimental reasons and,
personally, I consider it an acquisition. Our farm lands, unavoidably
destitute of native bird-life, would undoubtedly be dreary indeed
without the Lark carolling about.
I once had a rather curious experience with a Skylark and, although
it has nothing to do with the present article, it may be of interest.
Crossing a paddock I discovered a Lark&apos;s nest containing three eggs,
which I decided to photograph. Dropping my hat near it to mark the
spot I returned home for a camera. On my return, some ten minutes
later, imagine my surprise to find the nest empty ! Searching the
immediate vicinity a Lark flew up and going to the spot I found an egg
quite intact. About 12 yards from the nest was a second egg, but
this was broken. The third was never recovered. Has anyone else
known Larks to remove their eggs to safety ? For I presume the
presence of my hat caused them grave concern.

TWO TAME BIRDS

By W. H. Workman
I wonder how many of our members have kept in their outside
aviaries really tame birds ; I mean by really tame embarrassingly
tame. Certainly, up till 1934, I never knew what a really tame bird
was like, until one day in the autumn of 1933 Lady Dunleath showed me
her Shama and G-olden-fronted Fruit Sucker. They were very tame,
sitting on her hand and eating mealworms from her fingers. I there
and then made up my mind that I would get one of each on the first
opportunity.
I asked Mr. Chapman to let me know when he had a really good
importation of the above species from India and sure enough in April
I heard from him and eventually received a beautiful Shama and
Fruit Sucker, thinking these two would agree in a very large flight cage
till the weather was warm enough to put them in one of the aviaries.
I put them together : for a day or so all was well, till " Jimmy &quot;, the

Shama, got his tail up literally and metaphorically, so that when a meal-
worm was put in the cage Jimmy, not taking any chances, darted first
at the Fruit Sucker and, catching him by the neck, knocked him off his
perch on to the bottom of the cage. After putting him out of action
he would return to his mealworm. This, of course, could not go on
as sooner or later the poor Fruit Sucker would be put out of action for
good and all or else die for want of live food. I therefore had to separate
them, and another flight cage, not quite so large, was procured for the
Fruit Sucker. They became fairly tame but they really are not good
cage birds ; so very soft feeders make an awful mess of the cage and
surrounding carpet, etc. Whilst in the cage my method was to put a
thick layer of sawdust on the cage tray over which a piece of newspaper
the full size of the tray was spread. This newspaper had to be changed
every day, otherwise things got smelly.
By the end of May the weather began to get really warm so I took
the opportunity of turning the two villains out, thinking that, in a really
large aviary having a flight of 20 by 10 ft. well planted with a large
shelter house 10 by 10 ft., there would be room for both to live at peace
as in Lady Dunleath's aviaries, but not a bit of it. The Shama went
for the other bird like a spitfire, so again we had to separate them,
and strange to say they don't interfere much with other birds of the
seed-eating variety.
From that time on these two birds became excessively tame. In
fact, the Shama is embarrassingly so ; immediately I enter the aviary
he makes a dash at me, and lights on my wrist so as to be absolutely on
the spot when the mealworm box is opened. It is impossible to get rid
of him; throw him off one's wrist and in half a second he is back again,
tail cocked up, chatting away. Off comes the box lid and, before I can
pick out a mealworm, he has his head between my fingers and down go
two or three at a gulp. By this time I have managed to get hold of
one, put the lid on the box, while he is on my wrist again and his
morning allowance of about six mealworms is a thing of the past.
I may say he gets the same in the evening five days out of the seven.
The difficulty now is to get out of the Shama's aviary and into the
Fruit Sucker's, but eventually I get rid of Jimmy and successfully
make my exit unfollowed.

The Fruit Sucker is waiting for me on a branch. He is much more
of a gentleman and quietly lights on my finger while I pick out the
mealworms and give him his allowance, his little white tongue darting
in and out like a snake's. He is in absolutely perfect plumage, a picture,
every feather in place, and as close and compact as a really healthy bird
should be. This has undoubtedly been achieved since he got into the
large aviary where he has free access to the open flight and a shallow
bath in all weathers, but at night he comes into the slightly heated
shelter and goes to sleep in an old box cage which I think gives him
extra protection. The Shama, too, is in perfect blue-black, white, and
chestnut plumage with a glorious long tail, so different from the
miserable one all frayed with which he arrived in April.
Many people are frightened of insectivorous birds because of the
soft food that has to be made up daily for them, but this fear is more
imaginary than real because soft food can be made up in a few minutes
from a few staple ingredients. They are as follows :--
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.999764166666667" page_id="56222646"  page_num="68" year="" vol="">
(1) The dry insectivorous food which keeps indefinitely.
(2) Boiled rice, boiled by the cook dry as for curry.
(3) A good carrot for grating.
(4) A simple sponge cake also made by the cook.
(5) Mealworms.
(6) Fruit.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.996662071428571" page_id="56222646"  page_num="68" year="" vol="">
To make up the insectivorous food for these birds I take about
two dessertspoonsful of the dry food, add about a teaspoonful of the
rice, and crumble in sponge cake about the size of two walnuts. Grate
in about \ in. of a good thick carrot to supply moisture. If you
have no carrot handy use water, but carrot is best. Mix well together
into a crumbly mixture and fill a shrimp pot for each bird, which is
enough for a day.
The Fruit Sucker must have fruit and I give him the following
variety as obtainable but only one sort each day : one-quarter orange,
one-quarter small red American apple, 1 inch of banana, two or three
green grapes, or a bit of pear or two strawberries. The Shama does
not care for fruit although I give banana or apple to him, but I think
the Pekin Robins take it.
I hope the above notes on these two delightful species will encourage

members like myself who are, perhaps, a little frightened to attempt to
keep tropical soft-billed birds ; they will be well repaid for the little extra
trouble by the wonderful confiding tameness of both, and if kept as
I have described in an outside aviary with slightly heated shelter, say
up to 45* on cold nights, they seem to do well. They get plenty of
*exercise and I believe in not too many mealworms. I believe a large
number to be harmful, especially in the summer, when in a planted

This is by far the prettiest Sporophila that I have seen and it is
in every way a most delightful little bird. It was first imported privately
in 1906 but this year a good many have been imported. The price is
fairly high, but even so the bird is well worth it. It is a hardy bird and
in disposition resembles the Reddish Finch. It is said to be a pretty
songster, but as I have only possessed a hen, I cannot vouch for the
accuracy of the statement

In the Ibis mentioned above Mr. Blaaw gives an interesting account
of a male of this species which he bought in 1911 in Santos and brought
home to Holland with him. It possesses an interesting eclipse plumage
when the black cap and reddish under parts are replaced with plain
buff colour, the bill becoming brown. It is a fine songster but appears
to be excessively vicious with other birds.
In addition to the twenty-one species given already, Russ mentions
the following though they are not known to have been imported :

BREEDING RESULTS AT THE KESTON
FOREIGN BIRD FARM DURING 1934
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997073333333333" page_id="56222650"  page_num="72" year="" vol="">
By E. J. Boosey
Breeding results here during the 1934 season have been quite
up to standard, any disappointments among the Parrakeets being
amply compensated for by the rearing of broods of the very rare
Splendid Grass Parrakeet for the first time in Europe and the almost
equally rare Yellow-fronted New Zealand ; detailed accounts of both
these events having appeared in the November issue of the Magazine.
Perhaps it will be as well to start with the disappointments, chief
among these being the Many-colours. These started with the rosiest
prospects, so that their ultimate failure was all the more unexpected.
Three pairs hatched what must surely be a record number of young
ones for this species, namely seventeen ; but, though the parents
had been given their nest-boxes at the same time as last year, when
we did very well with them, this season the nights elected to be
abominably cold just when the young ones were hatching and, the
cold weather continuing for some time, all but three of the young
ones died.
The survivors were three of a brood of five hatched by an imported
hen and a cock which we have had ever since the farm was started,
and which we know to have lived in aviaries for nineteen years, though,
being wild-caught, his full age is uncertain. His original wife died
last year of old age.
The old pair of Barrabands reared four young ones, but a second
pair hatched six, only to let them die at various ages, the last to succumb
being quite well feathered.
Fifteen young Stanleys were reared. A pair of Yellow-rumps pro-
duced the amazingly large clutch of ten fertile eggs, but the hen deserted
after sitting for a fortnight, possibly from sheer terror at the thought
of having to rear ten children all at once !
A pair of Rosellas reared nine young ones, but the Golden-mantles,
a supposed young pair, turned out to be two cocks, though one of
them has, compared with the other, a definitely small and feminine-
looking head, and in juvenile plumage looked an undoubted hen.

Fortunately, Lord Tavistock's pair reared a brood of six, of whicb
we obtained two young ones.
The star turn of the season was undoubtedly twenty-one young
Bourke's reared from four pairs, and it is interesting that nineteen
of these were produced by three of the pairs, these consisting of
two adult imported cocks and one young one we bred last year,
mated in each case to a young hen about twelve months old, also
reared here last season.
As against this, an imported pair we have had for several years,
reared only two. The same also applies to Blue-wings, of which
fifteen were reared. That is to say, two of the hens were our own
last year's breeding, and the third imported. The largest
and finest brood was produced by one of these young aviary-bred
hens.
By this we don't seek to prove that aviary-bred Parrakeets always
breed better than imported specimens, which would be absurd ; but
merely that, provided they come from carefully bred stock that
has not been allowed to degenerate, they do breed every bit as well.
No Elegants or Turquoisines were reared, the eggs in the case of
the former being unfertile, while one pair of Turquoisines had fertile
eggs which the hen deserted, a second paid had infertile eggs, while
a third hen failed to lay at all. The chief difficulty in breeding
Turquoisines is that pairs are very inclined to squabble in the breeding
season, and one gathers from watching them that this is chiefly due
to the cock's fussy inquisitiveness. No sooner has the hen disappeared
into the nest-box, obviously hoping to be left in peace, for a while,
than the cock either goes and pokes his head in the entrance hole,
or else goes right inside, when a heated argument takes place, ending
usually in the cock being unceremoniously bundled out again,
while the hen, half in, half out of her nest-box, glares angrily at her
tiresome husband. All this is not particularly conducive to marital
peace, or the successful hatching of eggs.
Splendids, to a certain extent, share this trait, being distinctly
inquisitive ; while Elegants, Bourke's, and Blue-wings, curiously
enough, are quite the opposite, being usually great respecters of
their wives' privacy.

One of the most interesting and satisfactory events was the breeding
of Hooded Parrakeets at the right time of year. This lovely and shapely
little bird has scarcely ever been bred, though this is not because
they are difficult to rear or unwilling to go to nest. The reason is
their almost invariable refusal to adapt themselves to our seasons.
They usually spend the proper breeding season moulting hard and,
although all their neighbours are busy rearing families, Hooded refuse
so much as even to examine a nest-box. Then, at last, about October,
as soon as they begin to feel an autumnal nip in the air, they decide
that the ideal time to start thinking about raising a family has arrived.
To allow them to breed at such a time is, of course, quite hopeless,
the few young ones that have been reared in heated shelters proving,
even if they live long enough to leave the nest, so weakly and rickety
as to be hardly worth the trouble of rearing.
The hen that bred this year was mated in spring, 1933, to a cock
Red-rump, who, to her outraged astonishment, suggested that she
should lay in April. To this fantastic proposal she opposed a curt
negative but, in doing so, failed to take into account the reactions of
a cock Red-rump who considers his wife is attempting to thwart him.
He, too, was amazed and indignant, so much so that he literally drove
his wretched wife (who was just looking forward to a nice- quiet moult)
into the nest-box, and kept her there until she promised to set about
immediately preparing it for the reception of eggs.
This, with extreme reluctance she did, the result being a brood of
four hybrids, all successfully reared.
This spring a Hooded husband was provided for her and, as they
went to nest in April, one can only suppose that she must have told
her husband about her successful experiment of the previous year.
For some reason, possibly because she must by now be getting pretty
old, she only laid two eggs, but these were both hatched and reared
into two very fine young cocks.
A short description of the aforementioned hybrids--a cross which
has, we believe, never been obtained before--might be of interest, as
the birds are now fully adult. The hen takes after her father, and
is not unlike a paler and slimmer edition of an ordinary hen Red-rump.
The three cocks have slightly bluish emerald-green breasts, dark-grey

backs, with a faint suggestion of grey where the hood should be, a
good deal of dark blue on the lower part of the wing, with a pale bronze-
green rump, the tail shading into blue-black at the tip. In the case
of two of these cocks the wing is adorned with a fair-sized red patch
on each shoulder, this area being orange in the remaining one.
Four young Eing-necks, and several young Cockatiels were reared,
as also numerous Lovebirds of the various species. Incidentally, two
very fine broods of five and four respectively of Nyasa and Masked
Lovebirds were fledged about 14th November, their nest-boxes being
hung in the open run with only slight overhead protection from the
rain. Both pairs have young in the nest again as we write (4th January).
A pair of Swainson's Lorikeets go on breeding steadily the whole
year round, invariably laying two eggs and hatching one ; and the
single young one remains in the nest for months. At the moment
they have a half-grown youngster.
Pairs of Barnards, Mealy Kosellas, and Eock Peplars were obtained
too late in the season for breeding, while the " hen " of a supposed
pair of Crimson-wings, the cock of which we have had for some time,
turned out to be a young cock, starting to show the black back and
crimson wing patches early in June.
Last October we obtained a consignment of ten very young Plum-
heads from India. They have now mostly completed a moult, though
at least a further one will be necessary before the cocks assume their
red head colouring. At present it looks distressingly as though we are
going to have seven cocks and only three hens ; though the latter
have always, for some unexplained reason, been so scarce that one
would hardly have been surprised if the whole consignment had turned
out to be cocks. It used to be considered that hens were hardly
\0x25A0ever sent over owing to their duller colouring ; but that this is
not the case is proved by our experience with this consignment of
nestlings.
The breeding results with the Finches and Diamond Doves were
satisfactory, although there is nothing particularly spectacular to
record.
Zebra Finches did well, and hundreds of young ones were reared,

ordinary young ones and one white one, which has turned out to be
a cock.
Ruficaudas and Bichenos reared a number of young ones and
Long-tailed Grass Finches did very well during the latter part of the
season ; this being no doubt due to the fact that earlier on we found
that we had got some of the sexes wrong, which unfortunately is only
too easy to do with this otherwise delightful little finch. Every now
and again one comes across a pair in which the cock's black bib is
particularly large, and the hen's particularly small, and then, of course,,
the distinction is obvious. But in the vast majority of cocks and hens
the difference in the size of their bibs is so infinitesimal as to be practically
useless for sexing purposes.
One pair of Red-headed Parrot Finches did excellently, producing
nine young ones in two nests. Another pair reared two and a third
always deserted their eggs. Even so, however, it was satisfactory
to have started the season with six and ended up with twenty-one
(four under Bengalese). Most of these, of course, we are keeping,
so that next year we should have a nice breeding stock of them. Once
again it is interesting to note that the hen who did so well was
one bred by us last year, and the one that deserted her eggs was an
imported bird.
The Red-headed Parrot Finch is a delightful little bird, its chief
characteristics being its tremendous energy and tit-like vivacity, SO&apos;
much so that unless one is careful they are a little inclined to knock
their heads against the wire roof of their aviary. They are very
willing indeed to go to nest, but even more willing to desert their eggs-
unless allowed real privacy. It has always seemed to us that the diffi-
culty of sexing them has been considerably exaggerated. True, this
is a difficult matter if one happens to have a rather bright hen and a
rather dull cock, but, generally speaking, the cock's red mask is un-
mistakably brighter than his wife's ; also the cocks continually utter
their little trilling song, while hens have no particular song.
Gouldians did badly, the fourteen or so young ones that were reared
being very good ones, but quite a number of pairs failed to get beyond
laying numerous eggs, mostly unfertile, before they had to have their
nest-boxes removed for the winter. Of all finches, Gouldians are the

most mysterious and inexplicable in tbe way in which they will breed
extremely well one year, very badly the next, and then probably well
again, some pairs going to nest some years much earlier than others,
and all, so far as one can tell, for no apparent reason at all.
A fair number of Parrot Finches', Gouldians', Ruficaudas', and
Long-tailed Grass Finches' eggs were placed under Bengalese and
successfully reared by them. A very interesting point here is that
Parrot Finches and Ruficaudas, when they have broods of their own,
consume large quantities of mealworms, whereas their young ones
under Bengalese were naturally given nothing but seed and green food
by their foster-parents, who will hardly ever eat mealworms. Yet there
seems no difference in the size and brightness of colouring in the Parrot
Finches and Ruficaudas reared on an insectivorous diet and those
reared on a seed diet.
A fair-sized planted aviary, about 26 feet long by 15 feet wide by
8 feet high, containing Green Avadavats, most of the various Waxbills,
Paradise Whydahs, Gouldians, Cuban Finches, White-throated Finches,
Tambourine and Maiden Doves, etc., failed to yield any breeding results,
though numerous nests were made and eggs laid. This, however, was
scarcely surprising, as the aviary was only completed in April.
Even so, however, we are inclined to put a good deal of the blame
on to the cock White-throated Finch. This little bird, an industrious
though monotonous songster, is a perfect little devil in a mixed collec-
tion, usually killing anything at all closely related to him and contenting
himself with chasing the other birds about and pulling their nests
to pieces. Anyone thinking of keeping a member of the genus Sporophila
would be well advised to start with the Lined Finch. Not only is he
far handsomer than his White-throated cousin but, in our experience,
not nearly so aggressive, and an infinitely finer songster.
About 3,000 Budgerigars of all colours were reared during the season.

By Dr. E. Hopkinson
The number of Anatidae hybrids which have been bred in confine-
ment is very large, and the possibilities in this line seem almost
unlimited.
The following list of crosses of which I have records may be of
sufficient interest to publish and perhaps produce additions, so that a
really complete record may be obtained. The authorities for these
records can be found in my Records of Birds Bred in Capiiuity, published
by Witherby in 1926, and later ones in the Field, Avicultural
Magazine, etc., and in the Bulletin of the British Ornithologists&apos; Club
for 1929 (vol. xlix), where (pp. 93-9) two large series of Duck-hybrid
skins by Lord Bothschild and Mr. Kinnear are described. These
were exhibited at the May meeting of the Club of that year. Lord Boths-
child's consisted of " 103 skins of hybrid Ducks of 49 distinct crosses
and 2 reverse crosses ", all but three of which had been bred in captivity
--" artificially bred, mostly in Holland, but a few at Netherby Hall
(Sir Bichard Graham) ; Ditton Hall, Cambridgeshire (J. L. Bonhote) ;
Lilford Hall (Lord Lilford) ; and the London Zoological Gardens."
Mr. Kinnear's series contained about thirty skins, all but one bred
in confinement, at the Zoo, St. James' Park, by Lord Lilford, Sir
Edward Grey, Mr. Bonhote, and others. The last-named gave a full
account of his experiments with five species of Anas in the Proceedings
of the 4th International Ornithological Conference, 1905 (pp. 235-264).
In the list below (Both.) and (Kinn.) refer to the exhibitions
.mentioned above, and when both parents are printed in Capitals the
record (or records) I have are good ; when only one parent is so printed
I consider the record sufficient, while a (?) indicates the few in which
there may be doubt as to whether the cross bred in captivity was
fully reared.

By A. F. Moody
Particulars of our nesting Macaws (Ara chloroptera) at liberty
have already appeared in this Magazine, 1 but I hope that a few supple-
mentary notes referring to a young bird which was reared here this
autumn may be of interest.
Although the parents had been engaged at the nest from May
onwards no certain knowledge was possessed that young had been
hatched ; it came as a pleasant though not unlooked-for surprise,
therefore, when, on the evening of 27th September, four Red Macaws
were seen flying instead of the usual three. When first seen, on what
was probably its first flight, this youngster was quite a quarter of a mile
from home, the parents vainly endeavouring to entice it back to the
nest. This was only accomplished by easy stages the next day, the
young bird, meanwhile, roosting for the first night in a roadside tree.
For the next few days it sat about in the vicinity of the nest,
the parents visiting it at intervals and supplying food from the crop.
This method of feeding was continued for some weeks, 18th November
being the first date on which the young bird was seen partaking from
the food pans.
Viewed casually on its first appearance, the youngster was hardly
distinguishable from the parents, being equally brilliant in colouring ;
but on a closer examination it was seen to be more slenderly built,
with a shorter tail and less massive bill, the dark part of the under
mandible being more grey--a description which tallies with that of
the young bird which left the nest on 19th December of last year.
It is quite impossible to give the period of incubation or the date
when the young were hatched. All the data available is that the female
disappeared within the hollow tree about 30th May and remained there,
more or less continuously (she was fed by the male), until a week or
two before the young bird appeared.
At the time of writing, 30th December, our youngster is very like
the adults in appearance and behaviour, but it is still noticeably more
slender, and has a rather different facial expression and a darker eye.

THE CRYSTAL PALACE SHOW
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.985946419354839" page_id="56222666"  page_num="88" year="" vol="">
In some respects this year's show of foreign birds was less interesting than
that of last year, for although there were some outstanding exhibits, it seemed
to us that the variety of species was more restricted in one or two classes.
Nevertheless, it can only be said that such a show is a supremely good one.
As last year, the star turn was provided by a Humming-Bird, Mr. Ezra's
lovely Waterton's Wood-Nymph, a species still rare in museum collections
and in Gould's day known only from the type specimen. A Short-tailed Ant-
thrush was perhaps the most interesting bird we saw, while a female Hart-
laub's Spotted Waxbill, of the Southern race which ranges from Natal to
Mombasa, and therefore the first to be imported, afforded undoubtedly a
great surprise. Mrs. Pearse's handsome Abeille's Grosbeak, although a fine
bird, is perhaps less striking than the more northern Evening Grosbeak ;
several examples have lately been imported from Canada, none of which
were shown. We noticed a fine specimen of Rothschild's Grackle and the
Paradise Birds were well represented, in particular by the Lesser Superb
and more than one Wilson's. There were two Cocks-of-the-Rock, we venture
to think a somewhat overrated bird in captivity, for the curious habits it
indulges in in its native fastness are by no means apparent in confinement,
while its shape can scarcely be called elegant. Among the Tanagers we were
delighted to see the rare Calliste Boliviana for the first time, and the less
uncommon, though more beautiful, Calliste vieilloti, also shown last year,
likewise Mr. Maxwell's old black and red Phlogothraupis sanguinolenta.
There were more than one pair of Purple Sugar-Birds and of the Sun-Birds
the rarest were the Senegal Scarlet-chested and Mombasa Collared, both in
fine condition. The Kenya Malachite was slightly disfigured by some white
wing-feathers. Among the Parrots Mr. Maxwell's pair of Banksian Cockatoos
took a well-deserved prize, and Mr. Ezra's Princess of Wales Parrakeets
were very lovely. In conclusion we have only space to mention a wonderful
pair of Eclectus Parrots and an equally beautiful Green-winged Shining
Parrakeet, as well as a pair of New-Hebridean Kingfishers in perfect condition.

(.Miro australis longipes , Lesson)
As this species is now very rare and photographs of it equally so,
we thought it worth while publishing a plate which may be considered
to accompany the article on the species in Mr. Sydney Porter's " Notes
on New Zealand Birds ", published in the Magazine for December,
1933. Although this subspecies has never been imported, the South
Island Robin (M. a. australis) is included in the Zoo list. The male
has the head, neck, and upper surface dark slate grey, plumbeous
beneath, the shafts greyish white, forming lines on the crown and nape ;
frontal spot pure white ; throat, fore-neck, and sides of the body paler
slate grey ; lower breast, vent, under tail-coverts, and abdomen white,
blending on the flanks with the other parts ; wings dull brown with
paler shafts ; tail dull brown, shafts pale brown. Irides dark ; bill
blackish ; tarsi pale brown. The total length is 6 inches.
The female is smaller and duller, with the under parts paler.

" Green Islands in Glittering Seas " is a fitting name for those
wondrous paradises of the Southern Pacific. It is among these enchanted
islands that one finds the South Sea Islands of the story books, islands
of emerald green, of swaying palms by surf-ringed shores, of the scarlet
hibiscus, of wonderful multi-coloured coral reefs, of breezes laden with
the heavy exotic perfume of a thousand tropical blossoms, of gleaming
white coral beaches lapped by crystal waters whose touch to the body
feels like liquid velvet.
We perhaps see pictures of the South Sea Islands at the cinema,
or in a story book, or often a pen-picture is drawn of a tropical island
paradise in a cheap novel, where two lovers, after chasing each other
round the world, at last find their haven of refuge ! Beautiful as these
representations may be, they cannot adequately portray the original,
for how can they capture the radiant sunlight which drenches these
happy islands or bring to the nostrils the exquisite scent of the gorgeous
tropical flowers or above all convey to the mind that languid restful
peace which makes one feel that at last one has found the land of one's
dreams ?
There, the Englishman never speaks of the wretched climate as he
does in most colonies, or bemoans his fate as an exile from his native
land. He speaks of these emerald islands as one speaks of a lover,
tenderly, respectfully, and always in the hopes that there will never
be a parting.
It was to Fiji that I went in search of the wonderful Parrakeets for
which those islands are so famed. These birds are amongst the largest
and most brilliant of their kind. I had specimens of the gorgeous
" Splendens " at home and, fired by their great beauty, I resolved that
at the first opportunity I would try to visit their native habitat.
The chance came when I was in New Zealand, for the Fiji group
of islands is only 1,200 miles from that country. I hoped to
see something of all these splendid birds in a state of freedom, but
alas, I was doomed to disappointment. My stay was too short and the
Parrakeets were all too rare. When I was in New Zealand, I was

thrilled beyond measure to find that a specimen of the very rare
" Personata " was being sent to Auckland for me. Alas, owing to
lack of attention on the boat, the bird arrived dead. I felt heart-
broken as I handled the beautiful body and thought of the wonderful
might-have-been. As there seemed not the slightest chance of ever
getting another of these extremely rare birds, I determined to go myself
and try to secure another specimen if not a pair.
Preparations were made to have certain Parrakeets collected in
Suva to await my arrival, but unfortunately we did not appreciate the
local conditions. Upon arrival I found that four specimens of beautiful
Kandavu bird, known in this country as the Red-shining Parrakeet, and
which is the most plentiful of the six forms inhabiting the Fiji group,
were waiting for my arrival. There were also two baby Kulas or
Ruffed Lories. There were also three other Kandavu birds belonging
to Indians which it was thought I might be able to buy, also an odd
bird of the Taveuni form.
The birds mentioned had all been brought up from the nest, as
the Fijians know nothing of catching any birds. The only way they
ever obtain them is to mark down the tree where the nest is and
eventually take the young which are hand-reared. After some days
in Suva I heard of a specimen of the very rare form from the island of
Ngau. It belonged to an Indian and, needless to say, I soon took a
taxi and arrived at the very filthy abode of the vendor. It was a
splendid specimen, a hen, and was confined in a miserably inadequate
cage, in the bottom of which were a quantity of stale crusts, its sole food.
With little bargaining the treasure was secured and I bore it away in
triumph.
At first sight Fiji is like New Zealand, rather a disappointing place
to visit for the ornithologist, in spite of its luxuriant tropical forest.
Yiti Levu, the largest of the Fijian Islands and once the home of some
of the most brilliant feathered creatures, is being sadly denuded of its
extraordinary bird life. On every hand one hears of depredations of
the imported mongoose which has overrun both Viti Levu and Yanua
Levu, where it has played havoc with all bird life.
Originally imported to combat the rat menace in the sugar-cane
fields, it soon turned its attention to easier prey. In the smaller

Sydney Porter--Notes on Birds of Fiji
islands, such as Kandavu, Taveuni, Ngau, and Koro, there are still quite
a . large number of birds left and especially on the Lau Archipelago ;
all these places are quite free from the mongoose and the whites
who kill for killing's sake. On none of the islands are the wonderful
Parrakeets common. By reports from various government surveyors
to whom I spoke, I learnt that the Masked Parrakeet is not extinct
as it is supposed to be, and that a few still linger in the dense forests
on the mountain ranges in the centre of the island of Yiti Levu. In
the old days before the mongoose had thinned its ranks, this bird was
reckoned a pest owing to its eating the sweet corn and various tropical
fruits and was killed in large numbers by the fruit planters. I tried
to get those in authority to try and capture a few and release them on
some of the smaller uninhabited islands which were free from the
mongoose, and I think that this may be done.
The distribution of the Fijian Parrakeets is very strange and
is something like that of the large West Indian Parrots. Each of the
five larger islands has its distinct species.
There is no hope that these beautiful Parrakeets will ever grace
our aviaries again, for strict protective laws have been recently passed
and the capture or keeping of any species is forbidden. My birds were
procured from Indians who had the birds before the protective laws were
passed ; these they had originally purchased from the Fijians who had
hand-reared them and brought them from the other islands for sale.
Once there was quite a trade with the Parrakeets from the different
islands, the birds being brought over by the natives in canoes and sold
on the quay. Now all this is forbidden.
I had rather a difficulty in getting the Government of Fiji to allow
me to export any of these Parrakeets, but eventually I got permission
to take the birds away with me and I persuaded them to allow me to
receive a pair of the Masked Parrakeets should at any future time a
pair be secured, but of this I am not very hopeful.
There is no danger now that any of these birds will become extinct
except the " Masked ", for unlike most parts of the world to-day
there is no active destruction of bird life by either the natives or the
whites. The forest will never be felled as in New Zealand, for the

mountains are far too steep for cultivation and the general vegetation
is too wet to burn.
None of the Indians who possessed Parrakeets seemed anxious to
part with them, even though they were kept under very bad conditions,
and there was a general " take it or leave it " attitude, and often if one
attempted to argue about the price they would refuse to sell it at all.
Often we heard of birds belonging to Indians. The actual deal had
nearly always to be done by proxy, and we always offered to take the
birds at the price mentioned or even higher, but when it came to the
question of delivery very few of the birds ever materialized, though I
knew the people had them. Very often they would say that the bird
belonged to a child of two or three years old and it refused to sell it.
It may really have been that the Indians thought I was a govern-
ment agent trying to find out who had the birds.
There was one old woman in the fruit market in Suva who had
four lovely Eed-shining Parrakeets. They were beauties and in
perfect condition owing to, no doubt, being fed on fruit. We went
day after day to see if she would sell, but no price would tempt her, so
at last we told her that the only plan was for us to steal them, and with
true Eastern philosophy she said, "Ah well, if you steal them I can&apos;t
help it : it's the only way you will ever get them because I shall never
sell them."
Nearly all the ground birds on Viti Levu and Yanua Levu have
nearly been exterminated and a once common Megapode is now com-
pletely extinct. The imported Eed-vent Bulbul and the Common
Mynah are now superseding the ordinary native birds. In fact, about
Suva, these are the only two birds to be seen.
The forests on the smaller islands have not been fully explored
and I think that there are still many new species of birds to be found.
The wonderful Flame and Golden Doves are all too rare on most
of the islands, though I met the King of Ban and he told me that the
Flame Dove was still found on his island and he invited me to come
over and procure some, but owing to lack of time I was unable to do this.
The Fijian Parrakeets seem to stand a far better chance of survival
than most of the other Parrakeets of the world, providing that the
bloodthirsty mongoose is kept from their islands.

Sydney Porter--Notes on Birds of Fiji
Perhaps it is as well that we shall never see these lovely creatures
in our aviaries again, for it is sad to think of these brilliant gems torn
from their proper setting in those earthly paradises of sun-drenched
coral strands and tall green waving palms, being imprisoned for life
behind the bars of some inadequate parrot cage in a miserable northern
climate where the sunshine of a whole year does not amount to that
of one single month of their native islands. I for one shall be glad
to think of these gorgeous birds' freedom, living out their own lives in
those far distant isles of enchantment in the blue southern seas where
one day perhaps when my ship comes in I may travel again, never
to return.
The Masked Parrakeet (Pyrrhulopsis per sonata)
As mentioned before, my chief object in visiting Yiti Levu was to
try to obtain examples of the supposed nearly extinct Parrakeet which
is confined to that island. Various agents had been endeavouring to
obtain specimens before I arrived on the island. Upon my arrival
I realized that the quest was wellnigh hopeless.
I went on several trips into the interior in search of this bird,
hoping that I might catch a fleeting glimpse of it in its native forest,
but my luck was certainly out this time.
After a great deal of questioning and tracking down owners of
Parrakeets I found that a gentleman in Suva had one. Would he sell
it ? Why, yes. The price ? Oh, about eighteen shillings or a pound.
I only just managed to control myself and say, " Yes thanks, I'll have
it " ! But like horses, there are Masked Parrakeets and Masked Parra-
keets. This bird only just managed to be one at all. I was told that
he was moulting, but I knew better. He was kept in a wooden cage
similar to those in which Thrushes and Blackbirds are to be seen on
the walls of country cottages in England. The top was of corrugated
iron. That may not sound very dreadful, but when I mention that the
temperature in the sun is often over 160* F. and that the cage was
in the sun all day and that I couldn't bear my hand on the top, and
that wretched bird was fed solely on hard maize and what appeared
to be poultry meal, and that it had no bath or water of any sort with
which to wet its plumage, its state may be imagined ; especially when

I mention that the birds live in the damp forests where there is as
much as 300 inches of rain in a year. When the feathers did appear
on the birds they just withered and fell off.
(I was assured by the over-anxious manager of the tourist bureau
in Suva that Fiji was not a tropical country because the equator did
not run through it and that the daily temperature of 100* F. while I
was there was nothing to that of tropical countries. I mentioned
about coco-nut palms only growing in tropical countries, but was told
that they grew anywhere ! !)
I am convinced that all the Parrakeets of the genus Pyrrhulopsis
need a lot of moisture on their plumage when they moult, for in the
forests where the birds live it rains almost continually.
The Parrakeet in its wretched prison had been almost half-baked
by the terrible heat, but in spite of his condition I took him and I
made his late owner promise to put him in an outdoor aviary where
he could get the rain on his plumage during the time I was away in
Kandavu, until the time I called to take him away with me.
When I came back from Kandavu Island the bird was still in its
wretched prison. It was an old male and was almost as yellow on the
back as on the breast. I thought at first that it was possibly a semi-
lutino but I have since found out that if not given sufficient nourishing
food when moulting the Pyrrhulopsis Parrakeets will grow yellow
feathers which eventually wither and drop out. The bird had a very
strong and goat-like odour, which I have never smelt with any bird
before. I am sure this was due to the bird not being able to bathe and
also not having the right food.
Before leaving Viti Levu, the person from whom I purchased the
bird told me that he knew of another pair at Lautoka which were for
sale. Owing to shortage of time I was unable to procure them but
he said that he would use every effort to send them on to me later ;
at all events I never heard any more about them and I rather doubt
that he was telling the truth.
After a lot of trouble about a permit, for which I had to see the
acting governor and answer a great many rather awkward questions,
I got my treasure away on the boat.
To say that the journey from Fiji to New Zealand was a nightmare

96 . Sydney Porter--Notes on Birds of Fiji
is putting it mildly. I gave up a first-class passage on one of the large
luxury liners, which ply between America and New Zealand, for a
berth on a cargo boat belonging to the same line who advertise that
they carry eight passengers on the " intermediate liners By doing
this it gave me more time in Fiji and I thought that I should have
better accommodation for the birds and be able to look after them
better. I was sadly disillusioned--the ship was literally a " floating
slum " as far as accommodation was concerned. The captain ordered
the birds (I had sixteen Parrakeets, two Lories, three Pigeons, and four
Rails) to be put in the most exposed position on the deck. We struck
a cyclone the first day out, which continued until we almost reached
New Zealand.
I had a bad dose of malaria, and through tearing my leg on some
rusty wire in Viti Levu had contracted blood poison. There was no
one to look after the birds, so twice a day I had to crawl out of bed
literally on my hands and knees, to look after them. It was almost
impossible to get any water on the boat either to wash or give the
birds. I was too ill to clean the birds out and the wind was so strong
that it blew both the food and water out of the food pots in the cages.
The captain refused to have the birds moved.
Fotunately, before leaving Suva I managed to get a supply of
sweet corn or maize in the ear, and upon this the Parrots
mainly lived. But alas ! the journey was too much for the Masked ;
as we reached Auckland I could see that he was dying. Mr. Rowland
Hutchinson was on the docks to meet me in, so was Dr. Hopkinson
who was then visiting New Zealand, and we soon had the birds up in
Mr. Hutchinson's bird rooms. Every attention was given to the
Masked but he didn't last long. Had I known the beneficial effects
of beaten-up egg, milk, and brandy I might have saved him.
Gradually all the splendid Kandavu Island Red-shinings went as
well; we did everything possible for them, at least Mr. Hutchinson did y
but all to no avail, one by one they dropped off until only three were
left when I was ready to sail. I took these with me but they only
lingered for three weeks. It was the same with all of them, lung
trouble, pneumonia contracted on the ghastly voyage from Fiji. It
was heart-breaking to think of all these splendid birds gone after I

had been to so much trouble and expense to procure them. I had one
consolation--I still have my three splendid Ngau Island birds.
Some few years ago the American Expedition, already referred to,
did great slaughter amongst the few remaining Masked Parrakeets,
The Island of Viti Levu was simply combed out for them. Every
bird seen was shot ; on their own account twenty-six specimens are
reported as taken, not counting the ones wounded or dropped into the
dense vegetation which were never recovered. When science and
commercialism combined are let loose on the Pacific Islands, heaven
help the birds.
Several surveyors who were working in the interior said that they
had at odd times seen an occasional bird but that they were exceedingly
rare and very timid. So with the present restrictions, combined with
the continued depredations of the mongoose, I think that we have
seen the last of the Masked Parrakeet in this country. In fact I doubt
if there is a single one in captivity in the world.
The Red-shining Parrakeet (.Pyrrhulopsis splendens)
When in Fiji I was naturally anxious to see something of the
splendid Red-shining Parrakeet, one of the largest and most gorgeous
of living Parrakeets and the best known of the Fijian Parrakeets.
Like all the other Pyrrhulopsis Parrakeets, this species is, or was,
confined to one island, namely Kandavu Island, but escaped birds
I was told have now become established on Yiti Levu, but I did not
see any there. Kandavu is the third largest island in the Fiji group
and is quite large as South Sea islands go.
The difficulty was how to get there as there was a complete lack
of communication between Suva and Kandavu. There is no postal
service, no telegraph in fact, only one white missionary resides there ;
so these facilities, should they be installed, would be quite wasted. The
island is visited only by small native trading boats at intermittent
periods.
After some inquiries on the part of the person who had been getting
some of the Parrakeets for me, I was able to fix up to go on a small
trading schooner which was going down to get hold of a cargo of
bananas for shipment to an Australian port. The voyage from Suva

to Kandavu was more like a chapter from a tale of the South Seas of
a century ago than anything belonging to the present day. The
schooner, a - vessel of about 80 tons, had been built--well, I never found
out the date, but it must have been far back in the dim and distant
past. It would never do to sail anything but an old derelict in those
waters for owing to every island being encircled by coral reefs, the
mortality amongst the ships is very high and I doubt if any company
would ensure them, if indeed the natives have heard of insurance, except
from the missionaries, who charge a pretty high premium for the
insurance of their souls ! In a few years' time nearly all the boats come
to the same end : they get their backs broken on some uncharted
coral reef.
We (the dusky captain, the agents, myself, etc.) occupied what
was ironically called " Stateroom No. 0 ", and what a stateroom it was !
It was also the pantry, general store, and incidentally the home of
hundreds of huge cockroaches about three inches long and an inch
wide across the back, which travelled at an incredible speed all over
everything, ourselves included. Sometimes there was a general panic
amongst them, or it may just have been an extra exuberance of spirit,
for they would simultaneously all rush out of their hiding places and
career all over the cabin. At night they were most active and fed upon
our hair, eyebrows, and the skin on the soles of our feet ! When we
retired to rest, or at least got into our bunks, one could see them
poking their wicked looking heads over the sides and waving their
long antennse to see if one was asleep. No one seemed to mind these
creatures very much and in time I got quite used to them.
The menu was not very varied, it consisted of stale bread, at least
what the cockroaches left, tinned bully beef, and boiled green bananas.
I chose the latter. On the way over the small auxiliary engine broke
down, there was no wind, and we just drifted at the mercy of the
currents. My heart sank into my shoes when the captain, a hefty
Tongan Islander, told me that he had never been in these waters
before and knew nothing about the positions of the reefs which abounded
on every hand.
A wind sprang up at last and we decided to return to Suva to have
the engine repaired ; so, apparently, vanished my hopes of seeing this

Parrakeet in its native haunts. However, half-way across the engines
started up again, so back we went and our banana trading began in
earnest.
That Kandavu is intensely picturesque goes without saying, also
that it would satisfy the most ambitious imagination as to what a
South Sea island should be like. About 32 miles long and varying
from one to eight miles in width, it is composed entirely of steep
razor backed mountain ranges covered for the main part with dense
tropical forest, which has yet to be explored. There are limpid blue
lagoons where the graceful green palms for ever look down at their own
beautiful reflections mirrored in the calm waters beneath ; there is
a narrow strip of gleaming white coral strand and then the emerald
green jungle, mysterious and fascinating to a degree.
The villages are all one expects, and are typical of the islands. On
an area of close-cropped, vivid green grass, situated by the seashore and
beneath a canopy of waving coco-nut palms with their ever trembling
fronds and tall spreading native trees as often as not covered with a
profusion of sweet scented blossoms, are a dozen or two picturesque and
spacious native houses made of reeds and beautifully thatched. All
around are set bushes of the scarlet hibiscus, sweet-scented lilies, and
various flowering shrubs whose perfumed blossoms are used to decorate
the enormous bushy heads of hair of the native belles, while the men,
or at least some of the handsome village beaux, pencil round their eyes
with charcoal and sometimes wear behind an ear a hibiscus blossom.
Both the men and the women take an immense pride in their mops of
frizzy hair and the combs they use have teeth about 8 inches long !
The women mostly dye their hair red with some kind of earth.
The natives are a delightful crowd and one would little dream
that their grandfathers were the most ferocious and bloodthirsty
cannibals ever known. Their cannibalistic orgies make one sick to
read about. Fortunately that is, all past now and their descendants
hardly seem to have a care in the world, except the trouble of finding
the excessive Government tax. This is #2 2s. per annum, which to us
over-taxed people seems small enough. But the native has no income
and no money, neither does he know the value of it; half the sum
for which the bananas are sold has to be paid by the trader to the

Government, and the other half to the missionaries. The price of
bananas is about 2s. 6d. for 400, allowing for rejects, which means that
the native has to grow something like 500 to 600 to get 400 perfect
ones which the trader will take. So to pay the tax he has to produce
something like 8,000 bananas each year. At all events he doesn't
show his troubles to the outsider.
The currency is usually coco-nuts,.thirty-six of which are needed to
buy one box of matches from the insidious Chinese storekeeper.
One can imagine the procession needed to carry the cash when the
lady of the house does her Christmas shopping !
To row up one of the mangrove rivers is an experience not easily
forgotten. It looks rather like an oak forest which has been flooded
to a height of eight or nine feet. The mangroves arch over the river
channel and form a wonderful green tunnel while the waters look dark,
deep, and mysterious. One can often paddle miles up a river like this.
Ever so often arms branch off from the main stream and if one follows
them they lead to some delightful native village or banana plantation.
The whole effect of these mangrove rivers is extremely weird and can
never be adequately described.
Stopping at the first village, we heard the loud cries of these wonderful
Parrakeets which reached us as we lay at anchor over half a mile from
the shore. I found the bird quite abundant even around the native
villages. It always betrays its whereabouts by the loud raucous cries.
It was a great treat to see this splendid bird in a state of freedom. No
bird I have ever seen looks more superb when in flight than this one.
The brilliant scarlet, the intense blue, and the vivid glittering green
show up to the best advantage when the bird in flying. It is not
timid as Parrakeets go, which I suppose is owing to the bird being in
no way persecuted by the natives.
Years ago the Kandavu people reared a great many birds from
the nest and did quite a trade with them in Suva, where they took them
for sale. The birds were mainly purchased by the Samoan residents
and traders who plucked them of their scarlet feathers, which they
used to decorate their mats and make into " lais ". I met someone
in Suva who quite recently had a female Eclectus stolen and killed by
the Samoans so that they could obtain its scarlet feathers for their

mats. In an old book on Fiji published about the middle of the last
century I came across the following : " For nearly a hundred years
past the Friendly Islanders have traded with Fiji. The scarlet feathers
of a beautiful paroquet were the leading attraction, the birds abounded
in one part of Taveuni [this would be P. taviunensis] where they
were caught by nets and purchased by the Tongans, who traded with
them in exchange for the fine mats of the Samoans. They paid the
Fijians for the paroquets with small articles of European manufacture,
bowls, and the loan of their women 55 !
Fortunately, the sale of the Parrakeets has now been stopped,
a measure which I heartily agree with, for if the wretched birds were
not purchased by the Samoans to be periodically plucked, they were
bought by Indians who kept them in terribly inadequate cages until
they died of semi-starvation. True, a few are now smuggled into Suva
but nothing like the numbers which came over a few years ago.
I never saw the birds in flocks, only in odd ones or pairs. They are
not birds of the open country, but of the dense forests and the thick
jungle bordering the native clearings. I never saw them low down
but always on the tree-tops or in the higher branches.
Near the village of Talaulia we found the Parrakeets in the mango
trees feeding upon the ripe fruit. They seemed to waste a terrible lot,
for under the trees lay a large amount of half-eaten fruit, but no doubt
the so-called " flying foxes ", or fruit bats, were also to blame.
Very often the brilliant colouring of tropical birds harmonizes with
the foliage of the trees but not so with this one, the brilliant scarlet
and blue are always most conspicuous when the birds are in the trees.
I should imagine that the dark species such as P. tabuensis, etc., are
even more easy of observation with their almost black under parts
and even more brilliant blue.
All the time the birds fed in the trees they uttered their loud harsh
cries. I don't suppose that the birds do much damage to the native
crops which, as far as I could see, consisted of bananas which were
always picked and eaten in a green state, usually baked over an open
fire (no bird would ever eat a green banana), coco-nuts, and various
root crops, such as yams, etc.
Fortunately I was able to obtain twelve of these gorgeous birds :

Sydney Porter--Notes on Birds of Fiji
six came from a white person who had reared them from the nest,
but they were in a terrible condition. The whole six had been kept in
a by no means large packing case and fed solely upon dry maize.
They were poor undersized specimens and the wonder was how they
had managed to survive, especially as they had been kept in a semi-dark
out-house. The other six, though obtained from various natives and
Indians, were in almost perfect condition and one or two were very
tame. I intended bringing two females home with me for the two
cocks I already had in England and also an extra pair, making me six
birds in all. The others I was leaving in New Zealand. Alas, I
was doomed to disappointment, as related in the previous chapter on
the Masked Parrakeet. Not only did I lose all my birds as a result of
the unfortunate voyage from Fiji, but when I arrived home in England
some months later I found that the two cock birds had also died through
failure on the bird-man's part to give them the proper food ; he had
fed them solely on seed. At all events since then I have become
possessed of seven more of these beautiful Parrakeets. I had no
intention of keeping all the birds but I cannot dispose of any owing to
the foolish restrictions of the Parrot ban, but perhaps I am not alto-
gether sorry for they make a gorgeous spectacle in their aviary and
are without a doubt the last which will leave Fiji officially. My friend
said in his letter, " I have just received a very curt note from the
Eijian Government stating that the one who sent me the Fijian Parra-
keets will not be permitted to export any more Fijian birds. . . .
They state, however, that the Eijian Government has decided that
for the present no more permits to export any Fijian birds will be
issued." As no birds now come over from Kandavu, and no tourists
and very few white people go to that island, it looks as though we
shall never see any more Red-shining Parrakeets in our aviaries.
Dr. Greene in his admirable book Parrots in Captivity has a chapter
on this bird, but he evidently knew very little about it, neither had he
kept it, which is very evident when he says,It is by no means a delicate
bird and when fairly acclimatized can stand any weather and almost
any kind of treatment " ! Neither did the famous Dr. Russ know
much about it when he stated that " the birds do much damage to the
maize crops and are consequently hateful to the farmers, who pursue

them without mercy". There are no maize crops, neither are there
farmers on Kandavu. The Hon. F. 0. Dutton, who had kept the
birds, was more to the point when he said, " I have reason to think that
this and the Masked Parrakeet are peculiarly liable to decline. I .do not
think any specimen has lived very long in captivity and I cannot but
suspect that we have not yet discovered its right diet." He also tells
us that as long ago as 1888 its price was #5.
To get back to their treatment in captivity. I find that of all the
known Parrakeets these are the most difficult to keep in a state of
perfect health for a lengthy period of time. My experience with the
birds has had to be bought at a very heavy cost. All together I have
possessed twenty-four of these splendid birds, comprising three species,
and at the present moment I have ten birds of two species.
Owing to their superficially resembling some of the Australian
Parrakeets such as the " King ", one is rather apt to think that the same
treatment will do for both birds. I did until I found to my cost that
they are probably the most delicate and difficult of Parrakeets to keep
in anything like condition, at least in this country. They cannot
exist on the ordinary Parrot seed. To get to know anything about
their requirements one has to study them in a state of nature. Unfor-
tunately little has been written about them except data concerning
the collection of skins for museums, so to get to know anything about
these birds one must visit their native habitat. Unfortunately each
species has a very restricted range, some inhabiting islands only a few
square miles in extent. After a brief acquaintance with this bird in
a state of freedom I realized how mistaken I had been in its treatment.
In the first place the climate of Fiji is exceedingly warm and humid ;
during the period I was there the thermometer was seldom below
100* F. It rains intermittently nearly every day and nearly always
during the night : in some parts in the interior of Yiti Levu the rainfall
is something like 300 inches a year, compared with an average of 30
which we get in this country, so that damp moist heat is essential to
their well-being. Birds kept in a dry atmosphere cannot moult out
properly ; the feathers become brittle and break off soon after they are
formed. The birds should be kept outside in the summer having a
warm shelter for the nights. It is essential that during the warm summer

<bodyText confidence="0.99955128125" page_id="56222690"  page_num="104" year="" vol="">
showers the birds should be prevented from entering the shelter
so that the rain can thoroughly soak their plumage. Indoors in the
winter the birds if they don't bathe, and some individuals refuse to,
should be sprayed every day with a fine spray. Cold the birds cannot
stand, and to expose them to frosts and undue cold winds is to gamble
with the lives of these rare and costly birds. In their wild state
they seldom leave the hot and steamy forests except to raid the mango
trees of the natives, who by the way seem quite content to let the
birds have their share.
And then, their food. While the Australian Parrakeets live to
a large extent on the dry seeds of grasses and various plants, these
birds live entirely, as far as I could see, on fruit--not the hard dry wild
fruits of the temperate climates, but on such soft luscious fruits as
mangoes, pawpaws, etc. So it is logical that they cannot exist on hard
dry seeds such as we are wont to give them in this country. I find that
the best food is as follows : as a staple mixture to 14 lb. of a good parrot
seed add 7 lb. of large canary seed, 3J lb. of hemp, 3J lb. of white millet,
2 lb. of clipped oats, and 2 lb. of pea-nuts in the shells. In addition
to this they require an abundance of ripe fruit, sweet apples, ripe pears,
ripe bananas, cut up into small lengths with the skin left on; they are
also particularly fond of the small sweet green grapes which can be
bought so cheaply in the autumn ; green corn in the ear such as maize,
wheat, oats, etc. ; groundsel, sow-thistle, lettuce, peas in the pod, etc.
Mine are given, every other day, half a sponge cake per bird which is
soaked in beaten-up egg and milk, sometimes with a drop of brandy
in, and on the days when they don't get this I give a good insectivorous
mixture, mixed with grated carrot and chopped hard-boiled egg. It
is also essential that the birds have fresh twigs to bite up : mine are
given branches from apple trees and hawthorn with the berries on.
Given this food and well looked after they will live for years,
becoming in time very tame and affectionate. Two birds which I
possess can talk quite distinctly and one evidently knows what he says.

Chinese Blackbirds (Turdus mandarinus). --Seventeen eggs were
laid in four separate clutches and, although they were incubated and
several young were hatched, not one young bird was reared.
Crowned Starling ( Galeopsar salvadorii). --Three eggs were laid
by the 16th May. Two young were hatched by the 30th May. One
died on the 7th June, but the other left the nest on the 28th June.
. Slenderbilled Starling ( Cinnamopterus tenuirostris) .--This pair of
birds only laid two eggs, both of which were broken.
Shama (Kittocincla malabarica). --These birds laid several eggs,
which were broken. One egg was incubated and the young hatched
out on the 9th June, left nest 20th June, but was found dead on the
23rd June. Two more eggs were laid by the 25th June and one young
was hatched out and the other egg was infertile. The young one left
the nest on the 21st July and was found dead the following day.
Another egg was laid on the 23rd July which hatched out on the 19th
August. As the parents would not feed it, we took it away to try to
hand-rear it, but without success. These birds will not feed their
young once they leave the nest, as they go to nest again at once.
Water Thick-knee (Burhinus vermiculatus) .---One young one was
reared in August and an account of its breeding with photographs
appeared in the November number of the Magazine on page 301.
Boulroul Partridge ( Rollulus roulroul). --Three eggs were seen on
the 21st July and one young one was hatched on the 10th August.
The other two eggs contained dead chicks. The young one was almost
fully reared but died suddenly.
Madagascar Partridge [Margaroperdix madagascariensis) .--Eight
young were hatched under Bantams and fully reared. Two young
were hatched out by the parents and reared.
Fytche's Partridge (Bamhusicola fytchii). --Six young ones were
hatched out but only two of them were reared.
Bronze-winged Pigeon ( Phaps chalcoptera) .--Nine young ones were

hatched out but only four reared ; the other five were killed, by
Madagascar Partridges, after leaving the nest.
Swinhoe's Pheasant-tailed Pigeon ( Macropygia swinhoei). --A
good many eggs were laid but only three young were reared. The
rest of the eggs were broken by the other birds in the aviary.
Crowned Lapwing {Stephanibyx coronatus). --Only one egg was laid
which was hatched out on the 27th August. The young one was doing
very well, but four days later it was killed and eaten by a Kingfisher.
Wonga Wonga Pigeon ( Leucosarcia picata). --These birds have done
much better this year, and managed to fully rear four young ones.
Chinese Painted Quail {Excalfactoria chinensis). --Several eggs were
laid in different parts of the aviary. On the 4th July a nest was found,
in some long grass, containing six eggs. All these hatched out and
were at once removed to a coop with a small run attached. All were
successfully reared by the parents.
Indian Green-winged Dove (Chalcophyes indica). --Two eggs were
laid by the 22nd April, which were broken a few days later. Two more
eggs were seen on the 17th May. Both hatched out, but one young
was found dead when five days old. The other one was successfully
reared. Several more eggs were laid but none were hatched.
Grenadier Weaver {Pyromelana oryx). --From three males and several
females, seven young were successfully reared. This was exceptionally
good considering the number of nests that were destroyed by other
birds in the aviary.
Orange-headed Ground Thrush ( Geocichla citrina ).--Although three
clutches of eggs were laid none were fertile.
White-cheeked Bulbul [Otocompsa leucogenys). --A nest containing
three eggs was found in some ivy, and one young was hatched out
on the 19th July. The rest of the eggs were infertile. The young
one left the nest on the 5th August only to be killed four days later by
a male Orange-headed Ground Thrush.
Chestnut-breasted Bock Thrush ( Monticola erythrogastra) .--We had
great hopes of breeding this handsome Thrush. Two eggs were laid
by the 18th June. Both birds took turns in incubating. Unfortunately
the eggs were infertile. No further attempt was made at nesting.
Tambourine Doves ( Tympanistria lympanistria). --Although I have

two pairs of these pretty Doves no young were fully reared. Many
eggs were laid and young hatched, but they will always leave the nest
too soon and the parents give up feeding once they are out.
Californian Quails (Lophortyx californicus ).--Two pairs of these
birds laid between sixty and seventy eggs but none were hatched.
One pair laid all over the aviary without having any nests. The
other pair had a nest which was destroyed by Madagascar Partridges.
Superb Starling (Spreo superbus ).--Several young were hatched but
none reared.
African Wattled Plover (Lohivanellus lateralis ).--These very hand-
some birds only laid two eggs this year, both of which were broken
a few days later.
Pied Grallina (Grallina picata ).--These birds made a perfect nest
but made no attempt at laying and the nest was taken over by a
Sun Bittern.
Hair-crested Bunting.--Two eggs were laid by the 14th June
and after the birds had incubated them for some time both the eggs
disappeared. Three more eggs were seen on the 16th July and one
young hatched out on the 25th July. After five days the young one
and all the eggs had disappeared.
Sun Bittern.--Although we have three pairs of these amusing birds
only one pair looked like nesting. They got as far as making a nest
in a hole in the ground, and after placing a few leaves in it they put a
small round stone in and incubated this for about a month.
Among the small Waxbills numerous eggs were laid, but no attempts
were made at incubating.
In the animal enclosure I reared successfully the following birds

Most of the Mandarins and Carolinas are full winged and as many
as sixty were seen on the pond feeding. The Sarus Cranes again nested.
One pair in the usual place across the river and brought back one young
one. Another pair nested in a field about 4 miles away and brought two
young ones back. A third pair also reared one young one away from
home. In all four fine young were reared. It is a lovely sight to see
as many as seven on the wing at one time. I am afraid I am getting
very disliked by my neighbours on account of the row the Cranes make
at night. I get letters of complaint very often, but unfortunately,
as the birds are full winged, I cannot catch them. I hope it will not
end in my having to shoot them. My Stanley Cranes hatched out
two young ones but these only lived seventeen days.

With a hobby of any kind it gives to the enthusiast an added interest
and pleasure in the pursuit thereof if he can make by hand as much of
the apparatus necessary to his hobby as possible. In the case of the
bird fancier there is an unlimited amount of the equipment which the
average individual can make for himself, without any expert knowledge
of carpentry or technical skill, nor does he require an elaborate kit of
tools.
After endeavouring to breed and rear Budgerigars (Milopsittacus
undulatus) in small cages the writer found that the only satisfactory
and successful method was an outside aviary, details and the con-
struction of which he will try to describe.
It might be said that, while situated at an altitude of about four
hundred feet in central Perthshire, he has bred Budgerigars during
December with the temperature of the atmosphere at 10 degrees of
frost, and he attributes his success to the fact that the birds had
plenty of room for exercise and flight.
One peculiar feature in the habits of the writer's birds of both
the green and blue varieties, which have been reared in the aviary, is

their dislike for the summer sunshine, and it is most noticeable the
quietness of the birds during the day, as compared with early morning
and late evening. Even with plenty of shade provided they seem to
prefer a secluded corner of the house, rather than show a wing in the
flight. Probably this is due to the fact that the birds have got
thoroughly acclimatized to the cold, and take badly to the hot weather.
Commencing with the construction of the aviary, it is of great
importance to select a good situation for the house, and to have it

facing south or west, if possible in a corner where two walls meet,
i.e. a wall at right angles to a wall running east and west, as shown
on plan (Fig. 1). The protection given by the walls helps to break the
cold wind.
The ground should be levelled, at least the area occupied by the
house. It is also necessary to have the house well founded: this is
done by sinking four old railway sleepers, the ends of which are half
checked, as shown on plan. As it is sometimes necessary to remove
the aviary, it is advantageous to have it built in sections, the sections
made to bolt together with f by 5J in. bolts at points marked " B "
on sketches, and the whole house being held down to the sleeper founda-
tions with six 4 in. wood screws at points W.S. (see plan). The sections
are made up of 2 by 2 in. deal batten framing, and 6 by f in.

Winston S. Rowe--Notes from South Devon
The roof is rather heavy for the average house of its kind, but it
has been found that the extra thickness in the timber gives the birds
a benefit in warmth during cold weather.,
The whole house is surrounded with  |in. mesh netting sunk into the
ground to a depth of 15 inches, and is taken 3 inches up the first weather
board : this prevents rats and nice from burrowing into the interior.
The outside of the house is well treated with creosote, as a preserva-
tive against the weather, the inside being painted with an eggshell
blue shade of oil paint.
The total cost of an aviary of this size should work out at approx-
imately #13, which may seem expensive, but if bought ready made
of the same quality would cost much more.

By Winston S. Rowe
About a year ago (March, 1934) I purchased two pairs of imported
Long-tailed Grassfinches ; in no time three died. I then purchased
another cock and two hens, being determined to start the season with
two pairs. However, three weeks later one pair died, leaving me with
one pair, having lost two pairs and a hen. They were placed in a
bedroom facing due south, at night an electric heater was brought into
action, and the temperature never fell below 45* F. This taught me
a good lesson, i.e. (1) buy acclimatized stock in the winter, or
(2) have a proper bird-room so fitted that the temperature can be
retained at never under 60* F. until they can be gradually hardened off;
(3) the alternative is to buy imported stock in the summer.
The remaining pair of Grassfinches, however, gave me five fully
reared young ones. The nest was built in a Hartz Canary cage. A
liberal supply of meal-worms was given soon after hatching and was
kept up until the young fed themselves.
Some time in July I purchased a pair of Masked Grassfinches which
persisted in sleeping out until September and the beginning of October.
They did not seem to be as wild as the Long-tail Grassfinches.

Green Avadavats, of which I had two pairs, were also rather wild,
flying into the shelter immediately anyone approached them. Pintail
Nonpareils were also culprits in this respect.
A hen Bullfinch which I purchased in July, 1933, laid four clutches
of eggs in that summer. All hatched, but not one was reared. Her
companion was also a Bullfinch. She then spent the whole of the winter
(October to late February) in an aviary to herself, out by day and shut
in by night. She had complete freedom and always completely dis-
appeared until dusk. Having sold the cock I thought she might
like her freedom, but evidently she preferred it on a fifty-fifty basis.
She was not seen again after 3rd March.
I think that this part of South Devon (Torquay) is very suitable for
aviculture. Until February of this year on no day have we had
weather which might cause distress to the fairly hardy species. Each
night my aviaries have been left open, the large windows into the
flights being entirely removed. When February and the frosts came,
the windows, and in some cases the doors, were replaced. At present
I have Redrumps, Alexandrines, a pair of Blue Crowned Conures, and
Weavers. Until recently there were Peachfaced, Masked, and Fischer's
Lovebirds in three aviaries.
My most successful breeding of Lovebirds has been in the winter:
in only two cases have they troubled to lay in the summer, both being
fully successful, however. The nest boxes, 16 inches deep and 7 inches
square, are left hanging up all the year round.
One condition of the fledgelings has always baffled me, that is,
the state of their feathers when they leave the nest. Sometimes all the
youngsters would be fully feathered and at other times only feathered
on the head and wings. In all cases they were fed the same. Green
food ad lib. and always sufficient so that there was some to be cleared
away early in the morning. I noticed this fact particularly because
of one pair of Fischer's which sometimes had fully fledged young while
at others they were half-naked. Last winter they were fully feathered,
this winter only half-fledged, that is, with this one pair.
Another point I noticed was, if a youngster was due to fly off
the nest in a week and I happened to take him out to see how things
were going, he would not stay in the nest on being put back and then

they all came out. So I made it a rule never to examine the nestlings
after they had been hatched roughly a fortnight.
One other point. I have a young Fischer, believed a hen, which
was hatched 24th October, 1934, and which is kept in the house in a
box cage because her (?) flights have not fully developed. Every night
at approximately 8 p.m. she comes out of her little box and feeds for
five to ten minutes. I think this is a strong point for providing
artificial light in aviaries, although I do not do so. Her " little box "
is 8 by 3 by 3 inches high, top taken off and inverted, with a small
entrance hole. This she always sleeps in. She comes out entirely on
her own for her " supper ".
She has, incidentally, palled up with a cock White-breasted Caique
and they both play together on the Caique's cage for a few minutes daily.
The Fischer always puts an end to the fun by nipping the Caique's feet.
My Caique is undoubtedly a cock, the outer ring around the irides
being reddish. I have noticed three White-breasted Caiques at
Primley, two of which have the outer ring reddish, the other bird having
a yellowish ring. Two have more or less paired up, at least they
tolerate each other, and one has a reddish ring around the irides, and
the other a yellowish ring. My Caique is without doubt a male, as
unfortunately he behaves like one with some people. I may be wrong
in the exact colouring " yellowish ", as I only had a quick glance a
few weeks ago.

It has been the writer's pleasure and privilege to visit the Rio
Grande River on two different occasions.
Taking the southern route (one journey is about 1,000 miles by
Southern Texas Railway), the journey is a most interesting one to the
naturalist. One passes through vast cattle ranges, also large tracts of
cactus, sage, and mesquite desert land. At other parts large tracts
of irrigated land where the traveller may see flocks of the spring
migrators--Meadow Larks, Redwings, Blackbirds, Cow-birds, Bluebirds,

Song Sparrows, and others. I arrived in Southern Texas at the end
of March ; at that time (before I began my journey to El Paso)
thousands of the beautiful Cedar Waxwing were passing on their spring
migration to the north.
El Paso is a very fine city in Southern Texas, a frontier city of
77,000 inhabitants ; a bridge connects the Mexican city Jaurez (8,000
inhabitants).
Before we left the train a little excitement occurred. Two very
dark men with long black hair were marched through the train, in chains,
by three American and Mexican armed soldiers. American soldiers
guard one end of the Rio Grande River, Mexican the other side. I
found no trouble in crossing into Mexico.
There is something particularly exciting to the lover of birds
when he first visits a tropical or sub-tropical forest ; neither have I
found the feeling to wear off by repetition. One is always expecting
something new in bird life.
One of the first impressions of the Eio Grande Eiver one gets is
its beautiful sunsets. The steep forest-covered valleys going from
east to west are very beautiful and abound in bird life of great variety.
In the spring migration one meets large flocks of Eobins, Eed Cardinals,
Bluebirds, Crow-blackbirds, Meadow Larks, Kingfishers, Cedarbirds,
Purple Finches, and various other kinds. At times one feels strangely
moved ; familiarity certainly breeds an increasing love for all these
beautiful hills and birds. Often I have found myself in one of these
forest tracts (almost reminding one of the hothouses of Kew Gardens
at home). One forgets the heat in beginning a new work in a new
locality.
Some of the birds are very interesting.
The Red-winged Tanager
At a little village on the Rio Grande the song of this little bird is
heard more frequently than at any other point. Close by a ranch house
there is a small stream bordered by low woods, a favourite resort for
these birds. As day was breaking (on the dead branch of a small
tree) they would pour forth their morning song. This bird is one of
the most attractive of the family of Tanagers.

The Black-crowned Night Heron
This interesting and peculiar Heron breeds and also winters
from the Gulf States southwards. It is commonly called the Qua
bird or the Squawk, because of its unpleasant note. In some localities
the Night Herons nest among the flags of large swamps, in other
localities they are very shy and retiring, nesting and roosting in the
tallest trees in dense woods in swamps near water courses.
The Night Herons nest in large colonies, and after sunset may be
seen flying to their feeding grounds. In some places the nests are built
(amongst thick growths of rushes) in company with the small Blue
Heron and Louisianian Heron; these nests are composed of old corn-
stalks and rushes, placed on the tops of the broken-down tops of the
standing cane stalks.

DUCK HYBRIDS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9982348125" page_id="56222703"  page_num="117" year="" vol="">
Dr. Hopkinson's excellent article on hybrids of the Anatidce in the March
Avicultural Magazine is of more than passing interest to me as we have
had so very many of the hybrids he lists in our own collection of waterfowl.
This seems especially true during the last ten or a dozen years. One almost
feels that each succeeding generation of tamed, hand-reared birds increases
the tendency to hybridization. I have observed that wild-caught males,
introduced for a fresh infusion of blood, almost never mate with females other
than their own sort (with the exceptions of the ubiquitous Mallard and the
Muscovy) but that with continued captive breeding (and possibly the constant
association with other species which it brings about) the tendency to
hybridize seems much more apparent.
Last season we had a curious example of hybridization. A male Pink-
footed Goose (A. brachyrhynchus), already well mated with a female of his
own species, conceived a violent passion for a female Hutchins' Goose ( B.
canadensis hutchinsii) which lived with her mate in an adjoining enclosure.
Being curious to see what might ensue, the Pink-foot male was let into the

Correspondence
enclosure with the Hutchins' pair, and immediately paid violent court to
the Hutchins' female. In spite of being severely beaten by the Hutchins'
male, he persisted in his attentions to the Hutchins' female, continuing
through the nesting and rearing period. Evidently mating took place, as two
of the four young reared from the Hutchins' eggs were an obvious cross of the
Pink-foot and Hutchins' while the other two goslings were typical Hutchins'.
The hybrids partake about equally of the characteristics of the parents, and
except for size, strongly resemble the cross of the common Canada Goose
with the domestic Gray Goose.
While we have tried every plan of re-mating the Pink-foot male with a
female of his own species, he is still unmated, although confined with two
Pink-foot females at a distance from any Hutchins'. If an occasional call
reaches him from any Hutchins', male or female, it is immediately answered.
A friend reared young some seasons ago from a cross of the Paradise
( variegata) and Ruddy ( ferruginea) Shelducks. Last year one of the female
hybrids mated with a Paradise male, and hatched and partially reared a
brood of young which fell victims to turtles. This fertile hybrid is very
much what one would expect among the various sorts of Shelducks, for they
are all so very similar in spite of their diverse habitats, that it is easy to think
of hybrids proving fertile within the genus Casarca. I understand the hybrid
female mentioned above is still mated with the Paradise male, so perhaps
this season will see young reared to maturity.
The matter of hybridism is so very interesting to anyone absorbed in
breeding problems, and Dr. Hopkinson's article is such a real addition to
the none-too-complete writings on the subject, that it should be of more than
passing interest to anyone who enjoys the large, varied, and colourful family of
the Anatidse.

From time to time various treatments are recommended for the trouble-
some eye disease which attacks Australian Parrakeets when they are kept
under dirty conditions. It may be useful to put on record that the 1 in 1,000
solution of mercurochrome continues to prove the only really effective cure
for Grass Parrakeets, while Acriflavine which I have been recommended has,
like everything else, proved useless.

MR. G. B. CHAPMAN
It is with the deepest regret that we have to report the death of
Mr. G. B. Chapman, which took place on 16th March.
Mr. Chapman was one of the best known importers of birds and
animals, and was latterly associated with the new Zoological Gardens
in Belfast. His death will certainly come as a shock to the many
aviculturists who knew him.

Parrakeet, but I prefer the first of these names, as Gould originally
called it after the Princess of Wales before she became Queen Alexandra.
The bird is appropriately named, for no other Parrakeet possesses
\0x25A0quite such a combination of charm and elegance as does the subject
of Mr. Rowland Green's extremely beautiful and accurate plate.
The latter renders a detailed description of the bird's shape and colouring
unnecessary, and one need merely add that, unlike some birds, its
\0x25A0disposition is every bit as delightful as its appearance.
The cock bird's display is the most spirited and amusing perform-
ance, during which he rushes about, uttering excited cries, and periodi-
cally jerking his head up and down, as though it were controlled by
an invisible wire from above. At the same time, he erects a tiny
opalescent&apos;shield of feathers on his forehead, and rapidly expands and
\0x25A0contracts the pupils of his tawny-orange eyes. All this is, of course,
usually done for the benefit of his wife, but most cocks are equally
willing to display in order to welcome and entertain their human
friends.
These Parrakeets are generally quite devoid of fear, though one
pair we have here at Keston, though not in the least timid, is rather
&apos;less tame than most. A second pair instantly fly on to my shoulders

as soon as I enter their aviary, and they are never so happy as when
I bend down, enabling them to chase each other about on my back,
until one of them--usually the hen--ends by triumphantly pushing
the other one off.
A further very fine specimen, lent to us by H.M. the King for
breeding purposes, is at present in a flight cage, but when put out
in an aviary is obviously going to be just as fearless and familiar
as the preceding pair.
Princess of Wales's need plenty of flying space, and the majority,,
being quite hardy, are capable of passing the winter outdoors without
heat. They are perfectly willing to go to nest, but to successfully
rear a brood calls for somewhat skilful management, the most important
point to remember being that the cock should never be left in the aviary
after his wife has started to sit. She is usually, however, quite capable
of rearing her brood single-handed.

Since we are fortunate enough to possess here at Keston at the-
moment pairs of every member of the Grass Parrakeet family with one
exception, namely the Orange-bellied (of which we hope to receive
two pairs within the next few weeks), I thought a few of our experiments
and experiences with them might be of interest, in view of the fact that
up to now the amount of reliable published information gleaned from
practical experience of keeping and breeding this group of Parrakeets
is practically nil.
The reason for this is, of course, that whereas certain members of
the family, particularly the Turquoisine, appear at one time during the
last century to have been considered quite fairly common, even to the
extent of being recommended as suitable birds for the beginner, they
seem to have been allowed to die out completely, in spite of their reputed
prolificy. Even so late as immediately after the War, I did not
for one moment imagine that I should ever see a Bourke's or a

a definite, though possibly harmless, lunatic !
It was, I think, about 1923 that I first saw pairs of Blue-wings,
Elegants, and Turquoisines--all of them in Lord Tavistock's collection
at Warblington.
When, in 1927, we started the Keston Foreign Bird Farm we were
particularly anxious to establish a strain of the various Grass Parrakeets,
and soon we had breeding pairs of Turquoisines, Elegants, Blue-wings,
and Bourke's. For some time we attempted to breed them with their
nest-boxes in the shelters, but it was not until these were hung out in
the open run that any considerable measure of success was achieved.
For 3 ^ears, in fact up to the present winter, we were forced to treat
all our Grass Parrakeets as only semi-hardy, that is to say needing
a heated shelter in the winter, the reason for this being that they were
so extremely rare, and in case of losses so impossible to replace, that
we simply daren't experiment with them.
This winter, however, we have kept two old breeding pairs of
Bourke's and many of the young Bourke's and Blue-wings out of doors
without heat, and have so far had no losses at all. It might be argued
that this winter has been so mild as to be no test of a bird's hardiness,
but we have had, nevertheless, at least two spells of very cold weather
through which the birds remained quite unaffected.
Having bred no less than twenty-one Bourke's and a considerable
number of Blue-wings during 1934, we felt ourselves to be in a
strong enough position numerically to be able to test their hardiness.
We were aware that one or two people had kept adult Bourke's
and Blue-wings without heat during the winter, but were anxious
to test the hardiness or otherwise of young birds of the year.
We have twice attempted to winter Turquoisines without heat, but
in each case they got chills at the first onset of really cold weather,
necessitating their removal indoors. Elegants and Rock Grass
Parrakeets we have never yet been able to test, nor, I need scarcely
add, Splendids, though I see no reason why the two former should be
any less hardy than Blue-wings and I have a feeling that Splendids
will prove rather more robust than Turquoisines.

Various quite amazing statements have been made in some of the
old books, with regard to the general appearance of the various Grass
Parrakeets.
Dr. Greene, for example, in his Parrots in Captivity , remarks in the
course of an article on the Elegant Grass Parrakeet : " Not only does
this bird resemble the Turquoisine in appearance and size, but in habits
and in the possession of a tolerably musical voice, especially in the
early days of his courtship, when he sings and dances before his mate
in a manner which to her, no doubt, is charming, but which to the
human beholder verges closely on the ridiculous " ; and again, a little
further on : " We are disposed to believe," says Dr. Greene, " that the
Elegant and Turquoisine belong to the same species, and that the main
point of difference between them--the absence of the red shoulder
spot in the former--is not sufficient to separate them. They are probably
no more than local varieties of one species to which this bird, the
Turquoisine, and most probably the Splendid, belong."
Commenting on this, I may say that the Turquoisine and Elegant
are not the same size, the latter being considerably the larger bird of
the two ; and further, I am quite certain that no self-respecting cock
of either species would ever dream of singing and dancing before his
wife during the breeding season, or at any other time.
How on earth Dr. Greene could have supposed that the only
difference between them was the red shoulder patch, and have
thought them so ridiculously alike as to be scarcely worth treating as
separate birds, is quite beyond me, particularly as his own book is
illustrated with coloured plates which, though the birds depicted are
often a most peculiar shape, nevertheless do convey quite a fair idea
of the colour areas, the illustration of the Turquoisine being the best
in the book.
What always amazes me most is the convincing air of authenticity
with which Dr. Greene manages to endow even the most wildly
improbable of his statements, be it the imaginary love-dance of a
Turquoisine or his extraordinary conclusion that a Blue-banded Grass
Parrakeet (obviously the Blue-winged) is " neither more nor less than
a Turquoisine in its brightest summer attire ".
Why, too, did he omit entirely from his book this the Blue-winged,

which one imagines must always have been the least scarce member of
the Grass Parrakeet family, since it is the last to survive in any
numbers ?
For the guidance of those who are still a bit hazy as to the appearance
of the various members of the family, the following points may be of
interest.
Largest and dullest of the group is the Rock Grass. This bird is
very difficult to sex, and though a trifle larger and stouter than an
Elegant is, as a matter of fact, so precisely like one that the two might
well be merely different editions of the same bird, the only real
difference between them being that the Elegant's very lovely golden-
green is replaced in the Rock Grass by a dark sombre olive colour.
Next to them in size (omitting the Orange-bellied, which I imagine
is nothing but a glorified Elegant) comes the Blue-winged Grass
Parrakeet. This, the least scarce of the group, bears a superficial
resemblance to an Elegant, but its green is of a less golden hue and it
has a uniform quite wide oblong patch of brilliant dark blue on the
wing instead of the Elegant's narrow wing border of two shades of blue.
Next in size comes Bourke's Parrakeet, which, of course, in its
harmonious blending of blue, mauve, grey and pink, and also in
many of its actions, is quite unlike the others.
Now comes the Turquoisine, which is a trifle smaller than a Bourke
and is not really like any of the others in the arrangement of its colours,
with the exception of the Splendid. The Splendid is very definitely
smaller than a Turquoisine, with the latter's rather dark gentian blue
mask and wing-patches replaced by the deepest possible shining sapphire
blue shading near the beak almost into black ; the patches of this colour
at the border of the wings being overlaid with feathers of brilliant,
rather pale, blue. It does not possess the Turquoisine's uneven brick-
red patch on the wings.
The most interesting discovery we have made with regard to the
Splendid is that there are obviously two separate races of the bird ;
or, at any rate, this would appear to be the case judging by two adult
cocks we have here, both imported from Australia. One of these has its
crop adorned with the more or less round red patch of about the size
of a half-crown, which appears in all the old illustrations of the bird.

124 Thomas Hinton--Notes on the Birds of St. James&apos;s Park
The other, however, has the whole of its chest, from the blue face mask
almost to the vent, the most brilliant scarlet.
To this bird is applicable its alternative name of Scarlet-chested
Grass Parrakeet, but this could scarcely apply to the other, which might
be called the Scarlet-throated.
At first I imagined that this might be due to age, since most birds'
colours have a tendency to get more vivid as they grow older, but that
this is not the case seems apparent from the fact that one, at any rate,
of the sons we bred last year from the very brilliant cock is clearly
going to have just as extensive an area of scarlet as his father.
It should be noted that though a cock Turquoisine could never be
mistaken for a Splendid, one can quite imagine their respective wives
being mistaken for one another. Curiously enough, a hen Splendid is
a less brightly coloured bird than a hen Turquoisine, the latter's uniform
soft blue on the lower part of the wing being in the hen Splendid replaced
by a much paler turquoise blue. She also has less blue on the face and
is appreciably smaller than a hen Turquoisine.

By Thomas Hinton, Birdkeeper of St. James's Park
From 1900 to 1935, during my time as Keeper of the Waterfowl in
St. James's Park, there have been many changes, particularly in regard
to the number of species of waterfowl. Before 1914 we had only a small
collection, but since the War many varieties have been added and at
the present time there are approximately thirty-six.
The beauty of the lake has been greatly enhanced since the
alterations made soon after the War, and visitors are able to study the
birds closer. There are also some beautiful paintings by the waterside
for identification purposes. A great many of these improvements have
been made at the suggestion of the Bird Sanctuary
Committee.
The chief feature of the Park is the Pelicans. In
1900 we had a pair of full-winged birds which could be
seen on the wing every day, sometimes remaining in

flight for as long as an hour. In 1903 four more Pelicans were intro-
duced from Kew Gardens, these being pinioned birds. The full-winged
birds resented the appearance of these rivals and disappeared from
the lake, both being shot--one on Frensham Ponds and the other at
Seaford in Sussex. We still have one of the birds that came from Kew
Gardens in 1903, the other three having died at various times. Four
more Pelicans were presented a few years ago, two of which flew away
in 1929 and were not heard of again.
Early in the War the lake was drained and temporary Government
Offices erected, the birds being confined in a small space immediately
in front of the Lodge. During the air raids over London several birds
were killed by small pieces of shrapnel. A Moorhen was found to have
a piece of shrapnel J in. in length embedded in the fleshy part of its
leg. Also a wild Duck shot during the War was found to have a large
ball of shrapnel, about the size of a marble, in its leg.
After the War the lake and Pelicans' rocks were remodelled, and
during this time the waterfowl were removed to an enclosure at one end
of the Regent's Park Lake. Generous gifts, together with the ordinary
restocking, have since made this collection one of the best.
We have on the water a pair of African Grey-headed Shelduck.
These birds were a gift to the Park in 1930, and since their introduction
have bred here. Another gift was some Whistling Ducks, one of which
has become so tame that it will follow me about and allow me to pick
it up.
Cormorants were kept in St. James's Park until about 1911, and
a pair were reintroduced in 1921. These birds did not attempt to nest
until 1932, when they reared one young bird. Two Cormorants were
reared in the following year and four last year.
Pheasants were introduced in the Park in 1925, the first being bred
from sittings of eggs. Since then their numbers
have increased and the birds have flown into
Buckingham Palace Gardens, Hyde Park, and
Kensington Gardens.
The Tufted Ducks have so far established
themselves as to be now almost as numerous as
the Common Mallard. Another species breeding
rapidly in the Parks is the Gadwall Duck.

Sydney Porter--Notes on Birds of Fiji
In recent years certain parts of the Royal Parks have been set
aside for Sanctuaries, where the birds are able to nest without
disturbance, and it has been noticed that there is a very great increase
in the number of bird visitors to the Parks. All the year round we have
the Common Black-headed Gull. Other visitors include : Kingfisher,
Green Woodpecker, Landrail, Snipe, Woodcock, Red-throated Diver,
Great Crested Grebe, Scaup Duck, Smew Duck, Goosanders, Golden-
eye Duck, Red-breasted Mergansers.
In the Island Sanctuary I heard the Cuckoo in 1932. I had never
heard this bird in London before.

The Ngau Island Parrakeet (Pyrrhulopsis tabuensis atrigularis)
One day when in Suva a gentleman who was staying at the same
hotel, and who knew that I was keen to get the Parrakeets from the
various islands, informed me as we were sitting at dinner that he had
seen a " black" Parrot on one of the tiny native trading cutters which
were tied up to the wharf. I knew that this must be one of the dark
species from Ngau, Koro, Vanua Levu, or Taveuni. Needless to say
the meal was a hurried one, and we got down to the wharf only to find
that the boat had gone. My friend's Fijian was very meagre, but by
inquiring from the natives on the other small craft we found that the
boat we were looking for was anchored far out in the bay and her name
was, as far as my friend could make out, the Yea Yea Levu and that
she was sailing for the island of Ngau (pronounced " Now ") at 6 o'clock
the next morning. No one knew whether she had a Parrot on board:
there was no boat to go out to her so apparently our quest ended,
but I didn't like to be beaten as easily as that. So I rushed up to the
person's house who had been acting as my agent and who, being born
in Fiji, could speak the language like a native. Being a trader and
exporter, he knew all the native trading craft by name, but had never
heard of the Yea Yea Levu ---which, by the way, means the proud or

haughty one. We inquired everywhere but no one knew her or, for
that matter, seemed to want to. We got into an old dinghy half full
of water and made our way across the bay, nosing in and out of the
vessels lying at anchor. By this time it was quite dark, for in the
tropics the night falls early.
No one had heard of the boat: there were a hundred and one others,
some with very queer names. At last we came to one, The Island&apos;s
Pride. Ah ! . . . " Pride ! " . . . Could that be her, had we been given a
very free or wrong translation ? There was no one on board, no Parrot
either as far as we could see. We did almost give up hope this time, and
rowed back to the wharf. We still pressed our inquiries, however.
We asked about The Island's Pride. Yes, she was from Ngau and was
returning in the morning ; that sounded hopeful, but where could we
find the skipper ? At length we did find him, just leaving a bar-parlour
but, as they say in the Islands, he was " very well oiled ", which in
plain English means he was very intoxicated. Yes, he had a -
Parrot, he had brought it from Ngau for a native who hadn't turned up
(here were more adjectives quite unfit for the Magazine) ; so our
friend the captain was either going to wring the-'s neck or sell it.
Ah, that sounded better in spite of the sanguineous adjectives. Would
he sell it now ? No, he had a twinge of conscience, such as is usual
with hardened sinners when they get inebriated ; he felt that he must
wait until the morning to see if the owner turned up. My conscience
was not troubling me just then, so we visited the bar again with our
new-found friend--also several other bars ; but no amount of " oiling "
would stifle his troublesome conscience or induce him to part with the
bird. The only thing to do was to wait. If we liked to be down at the
wharf at 5.30 the next morning he might be able to do something. So
5.30 it was. But there was no signs of any skipper ; 7.30 came and still
no skipper. At last I hailed a passing Fijian and explained by the means
of the international sign language that I wanted to visit The Island's
Pride, which still lay out in the Bay.
There was no skipper even there ; we had lubricated him a little too
well in our efforts to get the Parrot and he had been unable to find the
boat; whether he stepped over the side of the wharf I never knew !
No one on the boat knew what had happened to him either. How about

the bird ? Someone had called for it late the night before and had
gone. Who was he ? Where could I find him ? Was the bird for sale,
etc. ? Yes, the bird might be for sale ; the native no one knew, but
someone thought he was a friend of " Charlie the Doctor ". But if
I wanted any Ngau Ka-kas (Parrots) they could bring me plenty from
the island. When ? Ah, well, perhaps next year ; maybe the one after
that if they couldn't get young ones when the birds nested again !
Once ashore again I took a taxi, such as they were, though I think
they would compare quite favourably with the ones in London, and
went to my agent's place. Did he know " Charlie the Doctor " ? No,
he didn't, but the dusky maid of all work who overheard our con-
versation did. There is one thing about these dusky maids, they are
not such hypocrites about their eavesdropping as their paler sisters
are. If in the course of conversation one needs information they will
always volunteer to give it so long as they overhear the conversation.
In fact our lady friend was his special pal at the moment. " Charlie "
was a dusky student from Ngau at the Hospital for training. We went
up there, but his friend had just left to take the Parrot to the Cable
Station for someone who had been trying to get one for a long time.
If we hurried we should catch him before he got there. We did hurry
and caught him just before he was entering the building. . . . Had he
a Parrot ? . . . No, of course he hadn't, when it was against the law
to have one. Ah, what had he got in the box ? He was caught this
time. . . . We only wanted to buy it. . . . Oh, well, that was all right,
but he was taking it to a gentleman at the Cable Station who was giving
him #2 for it. . . . Would he sell it for #3. . . . Why, yes, of course. . . .
Natives are not troubled very much with conscience, besides the gentle-
man at the Cable Station could get another . . . when the birds nested
again ! So " Yea Yea Levu " the illusive one, as we called him,
became mine.
With a sigh of relief, though soaking wet through--for by that time
the thermometer stood at 96* F.--I returned to the hotel to bathe,
change, and have my breakfast. So came into my possession one of
the rarest, strangest, and at the same time the most lovable of all the
feathered pets I have ever owned. He was a real derelict when I first got
hold of him, as in fact most of the Fijian Parrakeets are when owned by

natives. I didn't realize how tame he was until I reached New Zealand.
On the boat home to England he proved himself a great character.
Every morning he would welcome me with a cheery whistle and wait
for me to let him out of his cage, eventually climbing on my shoulder,
give me a kiss, and be ready to go the round of the other cages.
He was the only Parrot I could absolutely trust, no matter what one
did with him or how one treated him ; he was gentle no matter who
teased him, and how fond the ordinary person is of teasing Parrots or
monkeys ! He took it all with a good-natured resignation. When at last
he arrived in England and was placed in an aviary in my bird-room
he never lost his confidence in the human race.
In spite of every care, and I learnt through bitter experience the
proper treatment of these birds, he never came into perfect feather ;
his flight and tail feathers always seemed to get broken off and for
twelve months he never came into what one would call show condition.
There must be something wrong : it didn't seem to be the food, as he
was very fat and very lively. Even spraying him every day with water
didn't make much difference, so I had an outdoor aviary built, with
no shelter from the rain, though each evening he was brought back into
the bird-room. At first he was only too glad to be back under a friendly
Toof. As the summer passed he refused to come back: with a loud " No,
no, no " he rushed round very much like a Pheasant. The gait of a
Pyrrhulopsis Parrakeet on the ground is entirely different from any
other Parrakeet. On their long legs they can run very quickly and they
carry the long tail held high above the ground.
The warm rain and the sunshine worked wonders and by the autumn
he was in perfect condition and looked very different from the derelict
of some months previous. He loves to be taken notice of and it is only
when several people are taking notice of him that he talks. As " Vea
Yea Levu " was too cumbersome and no one ever remembered it, we
called him " Jimmie ". On being asked his name he would always
reply " Joey ". On being told it was " Jimmie " he would always
answer, " No, no, no ! Joey ! " He has quite a large repertoire but
seldom uses it. Once, when a party of children from the village school
were visiting the aviaries, he excelled himself, saying many things I
never heard before or since.

Sydney Porter--Notes on Birds of Fiji
Before lie could fly very well we used to let him loose in the garden,
and he never wandered away though sometimes he was difficult to find
when he got into a bush or tree and remained quite still. Eventually
he used to get so excited with the attention of a lot of people that he
used to fly away and was only retrieved with difficulty. Once, after
one of his escapades, when they telephoned me up at the office to say
he had flown away, I rushed up and found him trying to push the front
door open with his beak !
I often wonder if these birds eat any insect food in a wild state, for
once, when two Zosterops got into his aviary, he killed and ate them.
He also did the same with a mouse which got fast in the wires.
I am fortunate in also possessing, as well as " Jimmie ", a true pair
of these birds : the cock is a magnificent specimen, though when I first
had him he looked a poor enough creature. Once I nearly lost him,
he seemed to go into a decline, but after being kept in a high temperature
and fed upon a variety of nourishing food he recovered. At first he was
so weak that I had to feed him solely on beaten-up egg, milk, and brandy,
which I forced down his throat with a syringe. He is a gentle creature
but has not the confiding nature of the other male. His mate is a real
brute ; we christened her " Satan ". She hates the whole human race
and is never slow to show her aversion. As soon as one approaches the
aviary she flings herself against the wires screaming and flapping her
wings with rage, and on entering she has no hesitation in throwing
herself at one and inflicting very severe bites. She usually goes for one's
feet, for shoes and boots are her aversion, and she can quite easily bite
through thick leather. My bird-boy is simply terrified of her and always
has to close her in one compartment before feeding or cleaning out the
aviary. She sometimes has her " off " weeks when she remains quiet
and moody, refusing even to bite or take any notice of one even in the
aviary.
The Ngau Island Parrakeet is by far the largest of the Fijian
Parrakeets and is several inches longer than the Masked Parrakeet.
In colour it is an intense crimson black, similar to the well-known black
tulip ; the tail and the flight feathers are brilliant blue, the back,
secondary flight feathers, and greater wing coverts are an intense
shining green. The feathers of the forehead are thick and hair-like ;

this is a peculiarity of all the Fijian Parrakeets, but is especially
noticeable in this species. At the back of the neck, where the red meets
the green of the back, is a very thin half-collar of intense pale blue.
In flight, especially when seen from below, the bird appears quite black,
hence it is known as the " Black Parrot of Ngau ".
The island of Ngau lies about fifty miles to the west of Viti Levu,
and is only a few square miles in extent--forty or fifty at the very most.
I was unable to visit it, but gathered from the natives that it is very
similar to Kandavu but smaller, inhabited only by Fijians, and covered
with virgin forest. There is every indication that, with the stopping
of the trade in Parrakeets and the birds being unmolested by the natives
and the island being free from the mongoose, the Parrakeet will easily
hold its own.
The Fijian Ruffed Lory (Calliptilus solitarius)
This exceedingly beautiful and very distinctive Lory (to my mind
the loveliest and most engaging of the whole Parrot tribe, which is
saying a great deal, but no doubt those who have kept this loveliest
of lovely birds will agree with me) is confined to several of the islands of
the Fiji group, where it is fairly abundant. Once one is away in the bush
its shrill cries are sure to be heard, and small parties seen as they pass
with the most rapid flight from the top of one flowering tree to another.
Why this bird should be labelled with such a foolish title as
" solitarius " is beyond my comprehension. It is never seen singly and
would be the last bird in the world to enjoy a solitary existence. The
Kula, as he is called in Fiji, has many friends : he is never shot except
by the so-called ornithological explorers ; his nest is too high up for
the mongoose, and he is never caught by the natives. The only time
the bird is taken is upon the very rare occasions when a native finds
its nest; he then takes the young to hand-rear and if he is success-
ful he usually sells them to a European.
I have never heard of an Indian owning one ; I am afraid that they
would be too much trouble to feed, their delicate digestions would not
stand the universal Parrot food of Fiji--hard maize. And so they are
very seldom kept in captivity, even in their own country, for any length
of time, most birds dying of fits. When in New Zealand I found that there

were three of these birds in captivity there, one a magnificent specimen
which, strange to say, was kept in a rather small overcrowded aviary
in company with many other species of birds. He seemed to get along
all right, but he ruled the roost. His brilliant colouring made all the
other birds look drab when compared with him. There was another
pair in Auckland and their owner very generously gave me one of them,
but unfortunately it died before I could take it away. The next two
which I came in contact with were in Fiji--a pair of baby birds which
had been procured for me from Kandavu. They were the sweetest
little things, exceedingly playful and tame, but in very bad plumage.
On the island of Kandavu the Kula is very abundant, especially
around the old native buildings, and its shrill cry of " lish-lish " is
heard on every hand. I have often watched them on the flowers of the
tall coco-nut palms, feeding either on the pollen or the honey of the
flowers ; the birds seem to start at the bottom of the spray, running
up licking the flowers quickly with their long brush-tipped tongues
as they go. They often alight on the very ends of the palm fronds and
dance along the mid-rib with the characteristic whisking movements of
the Lory tribe until they get to the flowers at the base of the leaf. The
only time this fairy-like little bird is still is when he spots you, he then
eyes you after the manner of a monkey and after a second or two,
with a shrill " lish-lish ", he is off.
They are, indeed, like some gaudy blossom plucked from a
flamboyant tropical tree. One cannot imagine these radiant creatures
coming from any other place than some fair tropical isle in the Southern
Seas. What fitting jewels to grace the tropical greenery of those far
away sunlit emerald isles, with a cap of the deepest purple like the
intenseness of a tropical night, glittering green like the brilliant succulent
grass, and a scarlet that makes even the glow of the hibiscus look dull.
They are never to be seen singly, but either in pairs or small family
parties or flocks up to a dozen or so. A writer recently stated that this
species is in danger of extermination. This fortunately is far from the
case : in fact there is no Parrot-like bird whose prospects of survival
are so bright. It is abundant on nearly all the islands and most of them,
except Yiti Levu and Vanua Levu, are free from the three curses of
bird life--the mongoose, Man, and the rat. The natives hardly ever

interfere with the bird. On the islands, where the mongoose is, the bird
nests far out of the reach of this pest ; the white people seldom if ever
shoot it, and rats and cats cannot affect it, so while these conditions
continue it will never become extinct. I have never seen it far away
from the regions bordering the seashore ; this is no doubt owing to its
finding most of its food from the coco-nut palm, a plant which depends
on the sea for the distribution of its seed, the nuts falling into the water
or on to the beach and being carried often many hundreds of miles
before they are cast up.
No bird has a swifter flight than this lovely Lory, the Swallow and
the Swift in ordinary flight are slow compared to it. The incredible
speed with which it flies from one tree to another make it impossible
for the eye to follow it. There is just a misty flash of scarlet and green.
The mystery is how it manages to thread its way through the densely
planted palm plantations at such a. speed without colliding with the
trunks.
Around one small village in Kandavu, the name of which I have
forgotten, I found this Lory exceedingly common. Its shrill cries
could be heard from almost every tree and small parties could be seen
in the heads of most of the coco-nut palms, even in the centre of the
village.
Besides the two birds which had been procured for me I only met
with another bird in captivity in the islands, belonging to a gentleman
in the Government service, who under no conditions would part with
it. It was one of the tamest and most delightful birds I have ever come
across. It had complete freedom and would come when called and play
like a kitten, tumbling and rolling over and over. When told to put
out its tongue it would shoot out this long brush-tipped appendage as
far as possible in a way too comical to describe.
How my two birds managed to survive the voyage to New Zealand
I don't know. At all events, they did, and seemed none the worse for it
either. Once landed in New Zealand they soon made themselves at
home. Here they managed to rid their plumage of some of the horrible
sticky mess in which I found them. They had been fed mainly on
sweetened bread and milk, which is the usual food for Kulas in Fiji,
so no wonder they never look in good condition and soon die of fits.

Sydney Porter--Notes on Birds of Fiji
The owner of the very fine bird in Auckland very generously
presented it to me, though I was reluctant to take it as I knew how he
prized it. So I left with three birds. The older bird, though tame, would
never play like the two young ones, whose great delight seemed to be
to roll themselves up in the sheets of paper I used for the bottom of the
cages until they were quite hidden ; after hiding for a few minutes like
this they would rush out with a great to-do. I have never had such
delightful creatures, so full of fun and the joy of life. Every day they
bathed, rolling over and over in the water until they looked like drowned
rats. In a few months after landing they moulted out into perfect
specimens. But, alas ! now comes the sad part. One day one of the
young birds got out of a small door in the aviary: whether it opened the
door itself I don't know, but it got downstairs where the Keas were
being kept while their outside aviary was being built ; in crawling up
the aviary one of them bit its leg off. We did everything we could for
it, but it died after lingering a few weeks. Another bird I sent to a
bird show, where he got the prize for the best bird in the show, but it
cost him his life. The heat, smoke, and the change of atmosphere had
been too much for his delicate constitution, he died the next day. I
never forgave myself for losing him and have never shown a bird since.
I only have the one left now. He doesn't seem to miss his companions
and is just as ready for a game as ever. There is another one on the way
for me, but whether he will land or not I don't know. Lories are not
easy birds in the hands of those who know little about them.
The tongue of this bird is very remarkable, it is very long and
fleshy ; at the tip is an arrangement like a miniature sea-anemone,
composed of many fleshy tentacles which, when the bird is not feeding,
are folded in a circle just as a sea-anemone in repose. When feeding or
licking one's fingers, these are unfolded and have a peculiar muscular
action, and are used for gathering up the honey and pollen of the flowers
upon which this bird feeds. Each tentacle can be controlled separately.
After death they contract and cannot be seen. I have seen the tongues
of many of the Lories, but I don't think the brush tip reaches such
a development as in this one. With the birds being tame it is very easy
to examine this strange organ. The beautiful ruff is erectile but, contrary
to what one would suppose, it is not lifted straight up from the back

but is erected from each side, forming two fans on the side of the head.
These birds do well on the usual Lory food, that is a teaspoonful of
Mellin's Food, a dessertspoonful of honey, and half a cup each of fresh
milk and boiling water ; I find the birds will not thrive on tinned milk.
They are also very fond of grapes and very soft pears.
" Kula," the native name for this bird, was also given to a certain
operation ; it was also the name given to the strip of cloth which
received the blood, and which in Vanua Levu was afterwards hung from
the roof of the temple or the chief's house ; possibly it is the blood red
plumage of the bird which caused the natives to give it this name.
The plate of this bird is not a very good one, and it gives no idea
of the vivid coloration, especially the green of the ruff, which is one
of the most brilliant of greens in the whole of Nature.

I had a delightful experience one day. It came most unexpectedly
boo, as most happy incidents do. In the bar-parlours in Suva, the tiny
but very beautiful capital of the Fijian group of islands, one meets
with all kind of flotsam and jetsam of the Southern Seas, and often
quite by accident one meets with many strange and interesting
*characters. Many are the life histories I have heard over a glass or two
of beer, some of them interesting, some otherwise. Everyone is friendly
to a stranger . . . especially if it means another glass of beer ! Quite
often I have heard interesting things about bird life.
One day I chanced upon a strange character, one of those individuals
who, though possessing a wonderful theoretical knowledge, just seemed
to have missed the faculty for putting it to practical use. I always feel
.sorry for such people, for they seem to have been born in the
wrong sphere. He had been everything it was possible to be in the South
;Sea Islands, but like so many others his downfall had been the whisky
bottle. To cut a very long story short, someone had taken compassion
*on him and given him a tiny shack and a few acres far away in the
mountains behind Suva. He asked me to visit him for he said there
were numerous birds and also the rare " per sonata " was to be sometimes
seen there. So one day I took him at his word and went. Lack of
.adjectives suitable for printing in the Magazine stops me from

describing the shack and also its condition ! But the view was superb.
On every hand were ranges and ranges of forest-covered mountains
rising high into the clouds and on every side the blue Pacific with
white circles of surf where it broke on the various coral reefs, and in the
distance were islands, dozens of them, each one a dream of tropical 1
beauty. In fact one could almost see the whole of the islands of the
main group--Kandavu, Ovalau, Ono, Ngau, Koro, and the far distant
Vanua Levu and a whole host of small islets.
I was keen to see the lovely Parrot Finch of Fiji. I had seen a few
in Suva, but not many. They were usually in small flocks of about six
or more birds : I think they must have been family parties, for most of
the birds were wearing the immature dress of uniform dull green. I
asked if it were possible to secure a few to take away with me. Tim
Solomon Island cook boy was consulted, but no, no one knew of any or
wanted to catch them ; but after hours of consultation with other
neighbours the dusky gentleman got to know of an Indian who lived
some distance away who might oblige. I was given directions as to
where I should find him, so I set off. My friend by this time was unable
to accompany me, having made good use of a small present I brought
him in a bottle ! I set off alone, threading my way through one of the
most wonderful tropical forests I have ever set foot in. Unfortunately
the dusky gentleman was not at home, but on the way back I found
him by the side of the path feeding his solitary cow. I introduced myself
and explained my mission ; a long flow of language followed, it might
have been Hindustani or any other language for all I knew, but from
the gestures and general intonation I gathered that it couldn't be done.
At last my dusky friend broke into very bad English, and the gist
of the conversation was something as follows : " God made, you, me,,
little birds too, birds my friends always, you no like me, take you,
fasten up always in room with lock and key. No not ever ! " After
a very lengthy dialogue partly in some Indian language, partly in
Fijian, and partly in English, it was arranged that I should return at
a late hour, the time for the feeding of the birds, and then I should see
them. I had to make a solemn vow that I would not hurt them.
When I returned the house was closed up and my philosopher
friend had not returned. I noticed quite a few of these lovely Finches

awaiting round as though expecting something. I also noticed a large
circle of soapstone, about ten feet across, where the earth had been
cleared away, and this was swept clean. At length he arrived, and with
" You watch, Sahib ", he went into the grass house and returned with
a bowl of rice of a particularly soft kind which one could crush between
the fingers. This he scattered on the cleared area. We waited, but
nothing happened ; I retreated further away, but there was no move
on the birds' part. At length I realized that the birds knew I was
a stranger, so I retreated into a Fijian reed hut just a few yards away
and watched through a parting in the reeds ; that did the trick, and
down they came, hundreds and hundreds of them. And before me lay
the loveliest thing I have ever seen or perhaps shall ever see again
now that my wandering days are over--a living carpet of these feathered
gems who seemed to have taken the transitory hues of the rainbow
into their brilliant plumage and made them a permanency. It was
lovely in the concrete but also in the sentiment, which caused an Indian,
who in our conceit we should call uncultured and untutored, to
extend the hand of friendship for no ulterior motive to these glittering
expressions of Nature, seeking neither to destroy nor to impose his will
upon them but seeking to assist them in their own native sphere. I often
think when I see on 12th August some of our so-called " best people "
blazing away on the moors so near my home that if ever our souls are
weighed in the balance as some tell us they will be, that it will not be
the soul of the " heathen " Indian that will be found wanting. Truly
we need a society to save some of the savages at home and not those on
the green islands in distant seas. I told a person in Suva about this
little episode, and he was soon anxious to make a bit of money by
capturing the old Indian's feathered friends ; he asked me for directions,
but if he ever followed them there would be no need for my Indian
friend to fear.
There was a living carpet of about thirty odd feet in circumference
of these gorgeous Finches, though about half of them were in the green
immature plumage lacking the brilliant scarlet head and tail coverts.
Some of the old males seemed to be a wonderful verditer blue. All
were in perfect feather ; evidently they had just moulted.
They fed quietly with no squabbling until a Mynah, thinking that

it was missing something, jumped into the middle of them : in a second
they had gone into hiding in the neighbouring lemon-trees, where they
became quite invisible, and not until the unwelcome guest had departed
did they return ; when I showed myself they departed as quickly, and
did not return until I re-entered the hut. I spent a whole afternoon
watching these lovely creatures, while the old Indian explained in his
halting English the doctrine of reincarnation and the need for tolerance
to our feathered friends. When he knew that I too loved the birds
and never shot nor ate them he nearly fell over my neck with joy,
and on my departure loaded me up with all kinds of fruit and said that
everything he had was mine.
It was delightful to stumble so accidentally across a simple native
with such a naive and charming love of his fellow creatures. I compared
him to a certain governor of Fiji who used to shoot semi-tame Herons
from his doorstep to try out a new rifle. I wished that I too could
believe in reincarnation; it rather soothes one's sense of justice to think
that there will be a settling up " hereafter ", but I am afraid that I have
the mind of a sceptic.
To get back to the bird in question, Erythrura pealei is one of the
most beautiful of the Parrot Finches : the back is bright grass green,
which is also the colour of the wings and the under parts ; the whole
of the head and the tail and upper tail-coverts are bright scarlet. The
throat and chest are a deep rich blue. The young are a uniform grass
green. Some birds appeared to have the green replaced by a brilliant
verditer blue ; this may have been due to age or to cyanism.
This lovely Finch is common in most of the islands of the Fijian
group and is frequently seen in the gardens around Suva. It haunts
the low herbage and bushes, coming out to feed upon minute seeds.
Like most of the other Parrot Finches, it moves with lightning rapidity
and it is only caught with difficulty. It is strictly protected, and
permission is needed from the Governor either to keep or export it.
Parrot Finches are very difficult to get on to seed when captured,
especially the Red-headed species. When in New Zealand Mr. Rowland
Hutchinson imported a large number, but in spite of everything being
done for them they continued to die off like flies ; at last in desperation
we put them in an outdoor aviary, this when the' weather was getting

very chilly at nights. Not one bird died after then. I noticed that as
soon as the birds were put outside they started picking up something
from the earth. There were no seeds of any sort visible. I rather think
that it must have been some form of chemical material which was
necessary to the birds' health. I find that Parrot Finches will not
thrive on seed alone ; they need an amount of good soft-food, millet
sprays, and green food such as flowering grass to keep them in health.
In spite of all that has been written about these birds, I feel that
I cannot resist from adding a word in their praise. Of all the small
Finches these are the most delightful, always cheery, full of the joie de
vivre ; some have a pleasant little song. They are easy to breed, and
so great is the demand for them that a few nests will easily pay for the
year's seed bill. They are certainly the most brilliantly coloured of the
Finch family and compared with the lovely Gouldian Finch make even
that bird look sombre.
If ever you are in doubt about what birds to buy next I would say

By K. S. de Q. Quincey
In November our Editor asked me to record the fact that a Swallow-
tailed Humming Bird {Eujpetomena macroura) that I brought over
with me from Pernambuco in April last year, and that I turned into
an outdoor aviary early in May, was still to be seen flying daily in that
aviary. However, a certain fear that such boastfulness might bring
about swift retribution has kept me from publishing this fact. It is now
mid-April ; perhaps I should wait until the twelve months are completed
before telling anyone that this bird is still in this aviary and is still fit,
more fit than any other captive Hummer I have ever seen, and that
he was found to be roosting out of doors, not only on two very frosty
nights (one registered over 7 degrees), but also on that night of very
high wind in the beginning of March.

140 R. S. de Q. Quincey--Hardiness of a Humming-bird
This bird has only one feeding bottle, which is hung up in a slightly
heated shelter (the heat was put on in mid-October), so that he has to
use this shelter to feed in, and on some nights in October and November
I am certain that he used it to roost in, but I do not think that he ever
roosts in it now, unless it is particularly windy when the sun goes down.
The shelter shed (a wooden affair, about 12 by 8 feet, with a glass
top light and glass windows) is divided into four compartments. Even
with the heat on, one can never guarantee that a really sharp frost
will not cause water in it to freeze. The open flight he occupies is
approximately 40 by 20 feet, and about 12 feet high.
Up to early in October he roosted almost invariably on a thin dead
branch, rather higher than anything else in his aviary, and exposed
to any wind that blew.
I got it into my head that he was sleeping regularly in the shelter
after the heat was put on, but perhaps he seldom did so, for on a very
cold night in January something went wrong with the circulation of the
water in the hot pipes, and I had to go into this shelter to let air out
of them. On that occasion and on several occasions subsequently,
I sought the shelter (which is very sparsely furnished with branches)
for him, but he was nowhere to be found and, presumably, outside.
I often see him now, roosting high up in an exposed Sea Buckthorn.
He is incredibly fit--always sleek and snake-like, with none of those
puffed-out feathers one sees on specimens subjected to stuffy heat.
You might think him a dull coloured bird until you see him sitting
slightly below you, two or three feet away, sunning himself, when
the dull dark blue of his head, throat, and breast flash sapphire, pale
sapphire and turquoise, his green back shines, and his flame-treated
steel-coloured tail is spread for all to see.
I did have a moment of fearfulness in October, and caught him up
and caged him in the greenhouse. (I dared not let him loose among
the other Hummers in it, as I had sampled his ferocity towards two
poor White-bellied Emeralds that were put for a few short moments
in his aviary in the summer.) He was like all the wild, newly-caught
linnets in Club-row, and I determined that he should die of frostbite
rather than tear his lovely self to ribbons in a cage. He is quite fearless
of other birds and, if hungry, will feed out of the bottle from one's

hand, but he is far more independent than most Hummers, and an
absolute devil with some other birds.
He attacked, and would have killed, a Banana Quit I put in his
aviary a few weeks ago, though he never bothered about a Scarlet-
chested Sunbird ( Chalcomitra senegalensis lamperti ) that was with
him ail last summer.
I think he looked more beautiful than ever one late afternoon
towards the end of March. His food had been taken away to be
changed for the night food (of honey and water--with a drop or two
of Haliborange in it) and I suppose he felt hungry. In his aviary there
is a rockery and near the top of this a small pink-flowered rock plant
(I think a Pulmonaria) was in bloom and a small Forsythia overhanging
it and a trickling waterfall;--the afternoon sun was blazing on
these. I was planting bamboos at the other end of the aviary ;
suddenly there was a whirr of wings, and I saw him putting his beak
hist of all into each of those little pink flowers and finally into each of
the Forsythia blooms. Seeing Humming-birds do this to flowers in
-a greenhouse (lovely though it is) somehow doesn't hold quite the thrill
of watching this bird " do his stuff " out of doors in England in the
bright March sunshine.
It is curious how certain supposedly delicate birds will stand our
climate. I think this must depend on their being absolutely fit by the
time cold weather arrives. A Blue-tailed Pitta (. Euchichla cyanura)
has been in an outdoor aviary here through the last three winters.
His toe nails are not quite what they were, and each November he looks
like dying, in what is, I suppose, the usual unusually heavy Pitta
moult, but three weeks later he is so bright and new and shining--and,
the moment the leaves fal 1 , he is revealed so incomparably beautiful
now standing on a rock or log, now crouching facing you in the dying
grass and imagining himself invisible--that you have to stand and stare
at him, though there are a hundred more important things to do.
I brought over a very perfect pair of the little White-headed Marsh
Tyrants (Arundinicola leucocejphala) last spring. I was told they were
delicate (and indeed they had always been considered so), and
must go to a tropical house. Having then no such accommodation
they were sold, but I am convinced they are quite hardy when fit,

as another odd cock came over for me in July, which I gave to a friend,
and which lived in a very exposed, and quite unheated, aviary on cold,
clay in Surrey up to the end of November, when it was killed by a rat.
It was in perfect health up to the day of its death.
A lovely pair of " Lavendeiras ", the Brazilian Water Tyrants ( Tqsni-
optera velata) have been out all this winter. They built a nest in
October, domed and covered with white feathers, but that had to be
discouraged. They are exquisite little birds, in coloration not unlike
our Wheatear, but with movements of a Wagtail and at times of a
Flycatcher. They and the Hummer account for most of the small
flies that get inside the aviary. They have a delicious watery chuckle,
and the cock a habit of putting his head down, drooping his wings,
and spreading his fan-shaped tail as he utters this call on some bough
or rock.
I understand that in Brazil they walk a lot on the water-lily leaves.
I wonder if those in this country would support them ? They love
skimming over water, and drink often ; they are birds I never want to
be without. I believe they are starting to build again.
In an aviary the Hooded Tanager ( Nemosia pileata atricapilla) is
a charming small Babbler-like bird, not at all tame and hating close
quarters, but beautiful in the sunlight; the cock with his inky brown
and snowy breast and his back that looks slaty-blue grey until the
sun comes out, when it seems to have shining aquamarine and pale
pink lights. The hen is very slim and neat in grey and pinkish buff.
They have rather baleful pale yellow eyes and say distinctly, " We
prefer not to be too friendly."
Two of the most friendly and most confiding birds here are a pair
of Olive Kernel-eaters (Pitylus viridis), stoutly built birds that look
half-way between a Grosbeak and a Saltator. The beauty of their
greenish yellow silky plumage against the dark green of a yew tree
is a sight to be remembered. They have striking blue-black beaks and
black masks, and are very amusing in their ways, but are destructive
to buds and leaves. I brought over two pairs last spring, one of which
went to Mr. Ezra. I think this was the first time they came to England.
I hope that his are as well as mine appear to be. I was told that they

not do on seed alone. Mine eat canary seed, soft food, meal-worms,
grapes, apples, pears, and bananas.
Mr. Webb brought over, with many other interesting birds, a
beautiful pair of subspecies of Von Heuglin's Robin-Chats, called the
Mombasa White-browed Robin-Chat (Cossypha heuglini intermedia).
I had to have them, and brought them home in joy. They were tame
in their neat travelling cages but, in their freer home, they soon forgot
about human companionship and preferred discreet solitude to the
temptation of meal-worms. They became so secretive that I thought
they might be nesting--a groundless and fantastic hope, but their voices
(for they both sing, though the hen does so with less abandon) have
surprised, and even startled, people hearing them for the first time.
It is an almost unbelievable sound--well off the note--and loud, so
loud that on a still evening a quarter of a mile from their aviary you
may think that the bird has escaped and be within a few yards of you.
Roulade after roulade bursts forth as from some Prima Donna Manquee,
careless, inaccurate, ill-trained, ecstatic, rough, discordant, but in-
tensely exciting--yet all that cock did while in his cage was to warble
sibilantly and invitingly. Now to see his throat swell is prelude to
music of incredible wildness.
They sing most fiercely just before dusk and right through until
it is quite dark, and in the morning their voices sometimes wake you
before it is light.
Tragedy came last summer in the escape of a much prized Cardinal
Honey-eater ( Myzomela cardinalis), a beautiful bird--but a bully;
in the autumn with the death of a Mombasa Collared Sunbird (Ant-
wreptes collaris elachior) which, I think, got too fat on Humming-bird
food : he was a really delightful little bird in an outside aviary (both
these birds were gifts from our Editor); and in the early winter with
the death of Robert and Roberta, a pair of Macklot's Pittas (Pitta
mackloti) brought over by Mr. Erost.
If I ever have these lovely birds again, I think I shall risk them
out through the winter. They looked, and were, so fat and w~ell outside,
but, in October, I thought they had that look of " feeling cold ", so
I put them in the greenhouse. By December Roberta was still
blooming, but Robert had sat for a week on the hot pipes which, in

R. S. de Q. Quincey--Hardiness of a Humming-bird
the flurry of greenhouse conversion, I had left uncovered, and his
toes, from this perhaps, or because he got more than his share of meal-
worms, swelled, and his and my heart sank. He became very thin and
finally expired. He had boxes of leaf mould and trays and pans of
water of varying depths, but he preferred the hot pipes. Roberta,
who was still fat, but rather hating close confinement in an inner partition
of this greenhouse, was liberated into the larger outer part where Robeit
died, and a month later she was dead too. Shortly before Robert fell
sick Roberta appeared to be thinking of getting friendly ; they made
faint mewing sounds to one another. All the late summer I had been
watching for any sign of affection, but whenever they were put into the
same aviary Roberta had her military-chested spouse by the tail or
scruff, and saw to it that there were feathers flying, so that there always
had to be a wire netting breadth between them.
Other rather tragic losses have been two unquestionably fit White-
bellied Emerald Hummers (Agyrtria leucogaster), both from being
frightened at night by mice and flying against the glass in the green-
house, and, one supposes, fluttering down to the ground, where they
became exhausted. One was found wedged and the other definitely
nibbled. These Hummers seem more nervous and less confiding than
most varieties I have tried.
At last I think I have won an up-hill fight ; for the moment all mice
are banished from my so-called " Tropical House ". This is perhaps
an amusing little affair when one recalls the superb structures in exist-
ence, but it is 20 by 10 feet of indescribable pleasure to me. It is
a " wire-tension " house, three-quarters span, built against a wall.
Originally it had wide shelves and an earth floor, and I seized a small
corner about 3 ft. 6 in. by 6 feet as a thin end of the wedge. I realized
that I should want a certain amount of extra heat in this during the
winter, so that it has necessitated the erection of another cooler house
" just to help on the annuals ", and this has enabled me to seize the
whole of our original greenhouse for birds.
So far, casualties with Hummers, apart from the two White-bellied
Emeralds already mentioned, have been one Ruby and Topaz that got
his foot caught in two overlapping pieces of wire netting. He was
discovered too late to bring him round.

After the mouse episodes, I caught up most Hummers and kept them
in my bathroom, while a concrete floor was being put in and other
alterations made. This greenhouse now has a shelf about 2 feet wide
running along the front and one end ; on this I have some deciduous
tropical creepers trained up under the glass and, in front of these,
various orchids (Cymbidiums seem the most satisfactory and look very
beautiful) and Crotons and other plants. On the back wall there are
pots of orchids held in small metal hoops driven into the wall, and
groups of other larger plants in pots on the floor. All can be kept washed
down and sprayed as often as the weather permits.
About 4 inches underneath the top shelf there is another slightly
narrower shelf, planted with small trailing leafy greenhouse plants
(this is always kept moist) ; and about 9 inches below that there are the
hot pipes covered with perforated zinc in front, and boards resting on
^inc on top--so that birds can't overcook their feet !
The whole thing, though it doesn't look like a tropical forest,
gives the appearance of being very pleasant and somewhat exotic,
and it has the advantage of being easily cleaned and kept sweet.
The Pittas died in this place before conversion was complete
(I don't think the earth floor, which was apt to get sour, did them any
good), and I lost three very rare Ground Tyrants--a race whose natural
food and living conditions must, I think, be very hard to reproduce--
but the Hummers look as fit as possible, and are an absolute delight. A
pair of Lesser Niltavas (Niltava macgreorice) have moulted and are now
perfect ; the cock sings charmingly, and they are tremendous favourites ;
and a very rare and rather wild Ant Thrush (Formicarius cola), brought
over, as were most of the Hummers, by M. Cordier, seems to be extremely
healthy. In a day or two this bird is being turned into an outside
aviary, and I am looking forward to seeing him there. This bird has
a golden--shading to chocolate--crown, dull dark green back, sooty to
inky throat, chest, and belly, and a tail sticking straight up into the
air. He is, perhaps, rather more " Rail-like " in appearance than the
Short-tailed Ant Thrush that I brought over last year, and that many
members must have seen at Mr. Ezra's in the summer and at the
" People's " and the " Palace " Shows, but he has the same distinguished
walk.

146 R. S. de Q. Quincey--Hardiness of a Humming-bird
The temperature in this greenhouse in searching east winds has
dropped to slightly under 45* ; on several dull cold days it has been
a constant 52 to 55*. The Hummers don't appear to mind it at a
chilly 45*, but they revel in the sunny days when I can open the top
ventilator and the door, when most of them hurry to make use of the
small wire entrance lobby--to take an airing. Ou the strength of
this I am building a small wire enclosure on to one end, so that they
can enjoy plenty of fresh air in summer time. They look " fluffed
out " and miserable on days when one is forced to deprive them of
ample ventilation.
It would seem advisable to have at least two partitions in a Hummer's
house, as certain individuals will not agree, though by careful watching
and caging during extravagantly offensive moments I think I have
succeeded in establishing moderate harmony.
In the inner section there is a delightful little Brazilian Emerald
(Chlorostilbon prasinus) just through his moult ; an exquisite
Blue-chinned Sapphire ( Chlorestes notatus), possibly a freak or a sub-
species, for he possesses the added attraction of a partially white tail:
he is now in his moult, and is always a perfect little gentleman, unwilling
to attack or be attacked ; and a hen Brazilian Fairy ( Helioihrix
auribus poucheti), a bird that M. Cordier said would not live, but
that, after being sat up with for five rather anxious nights, seemed
to realize that life and food were worth while after all, whereupon
she started growing her exquisite new tail. She was at first nervous,
and is rather more fluttering and slow in flight than other varieties
I have kept. She flips her long tail up and down as she feeds, and
spreads it rather underneath her when attacking or attacked.
I am hoping to get some photographs taken of her when in flight.
She is a vivid green above, white below, her four central tail feathers
indigo and the three outer tail feathers white and of rapidly decreasing
length ; she has a black narrow eye streak.
In the outer part of this greenhouse is a Buby and Topaz ( Chryso -
lampis mosquitus), very beautiful and friendly with people ; a Black-
throated Mango (. Anthracothorax violicauda), a heavier, more lethargic
bird. His porphyry tail is a great attraction, as are his white fluffy
boots, which he shows when he settles down to roost. (These are
hidden when he is active.)

Then there are two young cock Stripe-breasted Star Throats
(Lejpidolarynx squamosus) just showing colour, that I long to see in their
adult perfection ; and last, but by no means least, the biggest and boldest
Waterton's Wood-Nymph [Thalurania watertoni) I have ever seen.
He is the most intrepid bather. The others are content with
sprayed and dripping leaves, and are amusing to watch tobogganing
about on the large croton leaves, but " Waterton " prefers to plunge
into any basin freshly filled with water and does this repeatedly, hover-
ing over it to pluck up courage for yet another dive. I hope to put
one or two of these Hummers in an outdoor aviary this summer.
I have only a few more birds tucked away in the other aviaries :
a Motmot ( Motmotus motmota?) is the largest and is very bright and gay,
swinging his tail and " tocking " away. He has been known to tweak
the gardener's ear--and though partial to mice, he does not bother to
attack any small birds. He had had his wings clipped when I got
him, but he is now quite perfect.
A charming pair of ? "Barred" Ant Shrikes ( Thamnophilus doliatus)
brought over by M. Cordier should be pleasant aviary birds this summer.
They have a merry laughing call ; the cock is black and white barred,
with a black crest, and the hen is brown with black throat streaks, paler
below, also crested. They have reddish-brown eyes. Another variety
of Ant Shrike (I am not certain of its name, but I think it is Thamno-
&apos;philus major, the larger Bush Bird) came over ; I have lost the cock,
but hope to receive another shortly, who was black above, white below,
and black and white barred on wings and tail, crested with a bright
red eye ; the hen is brown above, whitish buff below, also crested and
red-eyed. They don't seem to take much notice of other birds, but
will fight their own species if kept too confined.
A perfect pair of Rufus-bellied Niltavas ( N . sundara), the kind gift
of Mr. Ezra, are among my most treasured possessions. I have always
loved these birds. The cock is unusually tame, and I hope they may
be induced to breed. In their aviary I have made rather an attractive
rockery with a pool dripping into a lower pool and then into a pond,
and I have tried to contrive small crannies under the drips and have
planted hardy maidenhair fern wherever possible, so I hope that they
may be induced to think it sufficiently like their Himalayan home

148 R. S. de Q. Quincey--Hardiness of a Humming-bird
streams. The cock has been inspecting this renovated home with
extreme interest and delight, and I hope the hen will presently prove
equally thrilled, for I have not put them together again yet, as I find
them better separated during the winter.
A pair of Amethyst Starlings (Pholidauges leucogaster) are not very
enterprising birds ; up to now they have only got as far as carrying
leaves about. They seem disinclined to become tame, but the cock
looks very beautiful each summer in the sunlight, and people always
ask what that lovely purple bird is.
A pair of Striated Tanagers (Tanagra honarensis ) (the hens seem
to be very scarce even in their own country), a curious little " Spine
Tail 55 (? Synallakis cinnemomea ) that has a very harsh rasping call
when meal-worms are about, a delightful Banana Quit, a cock Purple
Sugar Bird, a very perfect Scarlet-chested Sunbird, and some cock
Giant Whydahs, whose effective tails and beautiful flight are always
good value for aviary decoration, would seem to complete the list of
what one might call established birds.
My latest importations are some " Little Widow Tyrants " (the
" Viudita Blanca ") (Tcenioptera irupero). Those who have seen a
Rothschild's Grackle can realize a Norwich Canary-sized and -shaped
Flycatcher of that colouring, and will understand this Argentine and
Uruguayan bird's beauty. His shining whiteness in his native country
arrested my attention and set me longing to get this bird over here.
He is by nature a solitary, wild bird, and is, according to Hudson, the
only Tyrant that nests in holes. Mine must have been hand-reared,
and are tame, but, caught adult, these small Tyrants would not,
I imagine, be easy to reconcile to captivity. They are moulting out
into fresh white splendour, and I look forward to the time when I can
see them in the full beauty of their flight, when the contrast of their
black wing and tail tips will be seen to full advantage.

BREEDING OF THE WHOOPER SWAN
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9943766" page_id="56222753"  page_num="149" year="" vol="">
Your members who breed waterfowl may be interested in a rather uniqe
breeding of the Whooper Swan in America.
In 1933, for the first time in America, I believe, a pair of Whooper Swans
at the Kellogg Sanctuary, Battle Creek, Mich., nested and reared two young.
In 1934 this pair w T hich bred the previous season laid seven eggs. Six
were injured by chilling, but the seventh was transferred to an incubator
when the parent Swans deserted the nest and was duly hatched. It was
given to a Leghorn hen to rear, but soon outgrew the foster-mother and left
her. This bird was successfully reared and became a great nuisance about
the place by following the men and begging to be fed.
So far as I know this is the first instance of a young Whooper being
incubator hatched and successfully reared. I have been informed that the
Whooper does not breed readily in confinement, even in Europe, so this
unusual circumstance may be of interest.

DANGER IN DUSTY SAND

Mr. Wilcock's letter on the above subject in the January issue was interesting
and worthy of attention.
I have been hoping that some of our members with more extensive aviaries
than I have would give us their observations on this subject, but as no one
has written, perhaps my observations will be of interest to our members,
even if they do not cover such a lengthy period as I should like before coming
to definite conclusions.
Some sixteen months ago I commenced using clean sea sand from Bridport
for all my cages and aviaries, and up to now it has proved most satisfactory.
For many years I had always used clean river sand, which I always carefully

selected myself from a beautifully clean river in this neighbourhood (a
tributary of the Wye). I daresay this is as free from contamination as it
is possible to get anywhere, but with all its washing it appeared to contain
far too much dust.
As most of our members are aware, I have specialized in Gouldian Finches
for many years (although I have many other birds too), but to my amazement
I have not lost a single bird from pneumonia since I adopted the use of this
clean sea sand, and I have used it for nearly two winters, from January,
1934, onwards. If post-mortem results are anything to go by, Gouldian
Finches and many other exotics seem to be particularly subject to pneumonia,
and I had come to the conclusion, before I saw Mr. Wilcock's letter, that
the dust and dirt in the river sand was evidently one of the causes of many
losses from pneumonia, hence my trying sea sand in preference to the river
sand I was able to get locally. I also believe the small amount of saline
in the sea sand is good for the birds.
From five pairs of Gouldians I had thirty young ones leave the nests
last breeding season. Out of these two died, two were sold, and I still have
twenty-six left. Most of these are now well advanced in the moult, and
are progressing well. Of the two I lost, one died a few days after leaving
the nest and the other whilst I was away from home during a spell of bad
weather. Taken all round, these birds (many of which are fourth generation
aviary-bred), are the finest youngsters I have seen reared, but I do not put
this down entirely to the change in the sand. Their general health and
fitness I feel sure is largely due to the almost complete elimination of dust
from the aviaries. This sand on the aviary floor is sieved every fortnight--
oftener if needed--through a sieve of 225 mesh to the square inch, an
unpleasant job with the river sand, but much less irksome now.
My small aviaries are absolutely draught proof, and have no heating
arrangements or artificial lighting, but " Sunralite " shutters are fitted during
winter and inclement weather. In these aviaries Ruficaudas, Bichenos,
various Waxbills, and some forty odd Gouldians spent the winter, and my
only losses were the two Gouldians mentioned, one hen Diamond Sparrow
(egg-bound), and one Pileated Finch which died in the moult.
Last breeding season I completely eliminated the use of eggs, bread, and
milk, and the results were most satisfactory and encouraging.
It is a pity that more of our members with small or large collections do
not send details of their season's breeding results to our Magazine. Personally,
I find these details most interesting.
P. W. Teague.
The goat-like smell Mr. Sydney Porter comments on in the Masked
Parrakeet is a natural characteristic, and is not due to bad management.
When properly fed, the Pyrrhulopsis Parrakeets seem to do well as aviary
birds in sub-tropical countries, even those with dry climates. I sent four
or five birds of two species to California where they did well, but unfortunately
the Masked were both males and the others, which laid eggs, were both females.
If they had been pairs I think they might have bred.
In Britain the Pyrrhulopsis are birds for the wealthy aviculturalist only,
as they need outdoor aviaries for the summer and warm and roomy indoor
quarters for the winter. Given these conditions I should not despair of their
breeding, though they might be difficult.

FURTHER NESTING NOTES ON BRONZE-

The pair of Bronze-wings (.Phaps chalcoptera) concerning which
I reported last August, have become very tame, so that it is a pleasure
indeed to observe their varied activities at close range.
The first and perhaps most important characteristic of this
particular pair of Pigeons is that they have nested almost uninter-
ruptedly since last August, taking but a few weeks' rest during the
winter months. This does not mean that they have reared a large
number of young. As a matter of fact, to date they have reared only
four young, and all singly. Each time both eggs were fertile and
both hatched, but each time the young hatching last was either too
weak to survive or else neglected by its parents.
The egg-laying capacity of the female Bronze-wing Pigeon is
remarkable when it is considered that she has been laying practically
uninterruptedly since last January. She is at this moment getting
ready to lay once again. Apparently her great activity in this respect
has not affected her well-being, for she is as healthy and vigorous as
she has ever been. It will be interesting to observe for how long a

period of time she will continue to breed under the present favourable
climatic conditions.
For the period of a year these Pigeons have nested in a large hanging
basket, though not always willingly. With the approach of nesting
time male and female become restless and apparently dissatisfied
with their old nesting site. Several times they have attempted to
build in a feed-box close to the door of the aviary. As soon as I covered
this box, however, they returned to their former nesting place.
However, at the present time they have again deserted the hanging
basket--this time giving the preference to a box in a semi-dark corner
of the aviary. Always up to this time the Bronze-wings have hatched
their eggs, though frequently not rearing their young to maturity.
The last two settings of eggs, however, they left, incubating them for
only ten days. I do not know why they left the eggs.
The behaviour of the Bronze-wings varies in other respects. I left
one of their young with the parents which, though getting very restless
and nervous shortly before egg-laying time, did not harm the full-grown
squab. Very early one morning last week I heard a noise as of much
fluttering against the aviary wire and possible fighting. Investigation
proved that the old Bronze-wing Pigeons were fighting the squab
vigorously. This they had never done before. Of course, I removed
the young Pigeon immediately.
The Bronze-wings are very fond of angle worms, which they devour
whole and in considerable numbers. Of course, this delicacy is not
often available. The seed they relish the most is hemp ; millet they
invariably leave in the feed-box. Green feed they do not take at all.
One rather important respect in which these Bronze-wings differ
from all my other Pigeons and Doves is that at night they prefer to
roost in the sheltered and covered portion of the aviary, whereas the
other Doves sleep in the wire-covered flight under the open sky.
I shall observe these interesting birds further, with a view to noting
other characteristics.

A short account of a pair of these birds which came into my possession
in the early part of the year may be of interest.
Briefly the cock is jet black with cinnamon wings and tail, with
a moderately long crest which when erected slopes backward and
upward. It appears " thin " and not burly and is hardly noticeable in
a poor light. In an aviary the hen appears to be of a warm mauve
brown, or dusky brown with a short crest, rather more burly and
more often erected in a more upright manner. No doubt individuals
differ in this respect.
They were imported into England in July, 1934, and were kept
caged right through the winter until I turned them out at the end of
March. I cannot say how hardy they are for that reason, although
heavy showers do not drive them into the shelter or bushes. However,
as soon as the sun commences to drop they hop in the shelter and go
into a cosy box stuffed with hay and straw. Shrubs consist of euonymus
and fir, the aviary being 17 by 4J by 7 feet high with a shelter, included,
of 5 by 4J by 7 feet high. Aspect S.E. All perches are " natural "
because of the amount of " give " and for their more attractive
appearance.
Their flight strongly reminds one of the flight of a butterfly. While
extremely steady in a cage they appear the opposite in an aviary,
the cock being much more nervous than the hen. Sitting in the
direct rays of the sun or underneath a bush in a clump of grass is a
favoured pastime. I should imagine they are harmless towards any
other birds as they took no notice whatever of a pair of large St. Helena
Waxbills and never indulged in a mild family squabble with each other
even when caged. Before coming into my possession I had ample oppor-
tunity of seeing them while encaged in a large bird-room. The only
note uttered so far is a mild metallic " spink ", somewhat resembling
the Chaffinch note. Large canary and two to three meal-worms daily
settles the food question.

White and Indian millet, crushed oats, crushed hemp, and various
weed seeds are untouched. Soft food may be picked over but not to
any noticeable extent. Fruit of various kinds, bread and milk,
nectar mixture all went untouched.
Occasionally a few pieces of chopped scalded raisins are picked
over. So far they take no interest in small gnats, moths, and other
insects on the wing, but if offered in a dish they are then eaten with
gusto. As a matter of interest I have tried nearly every food and
seed, but canary and a couple of meal-wo^ms each keeps them in tight
feather and has kept them in perfect condition through the winter.
Five or six meal-worms each per day is rather too much, as the cock
soon loses his sleek and glossy plumage and thereby loses half his
attractiveness.
While not gaily plumaged they are very noticeable in an aviary,
the cock especially so, and appear to have been sprayed with a thin
oil, or so a visitor thought !
Seeding grass has been offered, Poa annua only so far, but remains
untouched. Greenstuff and shrubs likewise escape their attention.

Have just exchanged the Buntings and St. Helena's for a pair
of Silver-eared Mesias which have always been on my " Wanted " list.
The St. Helena cock had a very narrow escape yesterday as he managed
to squeeze into the Black-headed Sibia's aviary. Hearing a continued
snapping of beaks and knowing that the Sibia rarely, if ever, miss
anything on the wing, I rushed down to investigate. There was the
cock St. Helena very calmly just escaping both the Sibias' beaks by
a fraction as they darted after him. Had the aviary been about 6 feet
square I should have considered myself lucky to have found any
remains at all, as the game of " follow my leader " must have been
going on some time.
When I turned the Mesias out great excitement prevailed among
their " relations ". The Sibia and a pair of Pekin Robins in an adjoining
aviary vied with each other in chattering at the new-comers. All three
pairs then set to and simply shouted at each other for a solid five or
six minutes. I have, by the way, had three pairs of Liothrix, all hens

and all guaranteed true pairs. Mr. Johnson supplied me with this
pair and the cock enjoys singing lustily at 6.30 a.m. and right through
the day until dusk. The Mesias, when fed at 8 a.m. daily, always
go firstly for the chopped grape and then for the meal-worms. Grapes
are cut with scissors into about six pieces and I find that they are
preferred this way. A pair of Virginian Cardinals would not touch
any fruit until I cut up their grapes for them and now they enjoy
pear, chopped and scalded raisins, and, of course, cut grapes. The
cock of this pair (incidentally my fourth pair) also suffers, luckily,
from a singing complex. Three other cocks only sang " Chow, chow,
chow ", etc., gradually fading away into a final weak " cheugh ".
My present cock has so many notes and variations that I find it well-
nigh impossible to put the notes on paper.
Hen Virginians have always proved rather more delicate than
the cocks, and usually have a doubtful period when first turned out,
while the males seem to have constitutions of iron.
The question of the number of meal-worms to give per pair of birds
daily is quite debatable, the number varying with different authorities,
and it always appears doubtful whether the number stated is per
bird or per pair. The quantity I use at present is as follows :--

of meal-worms for the Sibia and their general feeding. He increases
the number of meal-worms from 6-8 in summer to 10-12 in winter.
Hawking insects on the wing is a method by which the Sibias
are adepts while the Mesias usually run and hop along a branch and
but seldom fly after the tiny victim. So a reduction in meal-worms is
rather necessary in summer. In a large flight more meal-worms may
be given with a corresponding reduction in a cage. An increase in
number is allowed when moulting.
My brother-in-law once said, after seeing some meal-worms in bran,
etc. : "I suppose there is as much goodness in two or three gnats
as in one meal-worm." How far wrong was he ? "

There has been a lot of talk recently as to whether the " Parrot
Ban " will ever be lifted. Personally I shall be glad if it is never lifted.
I don't want to give the impression that because I have a permit I am
taking a dog-in-the-manger attitude in not wanting anyone else to
have one--far from that. In this letter I am dealing only with the
commercial side of the question.
Most of those people who clamour to have the restrictions removed
are those who profit by the sale of Parrots. The people who advertise,
" Talking Parrot and Cage, 30s. ; money back if not satisfied," etc.
To me it has always seemed iniquitous to make such intelligent
animals as Parrots the object of commercial exploitation. The
plumage trade was bad enough but the Parrot trade was equally as
bad. Though the methods were different, the end was the same.
Before the Parrot ban thousands and thousands of wretched
Parrots were shipped to this country in miserably small and insanitary
cages, hundreds together with hardly room to move: very often they
were left to the tender mercies of the butcher, or someone else on
the ship who knew very little about them. They were fed mainly
on soaked maize and kept exposed on the open deck. Hundreds died

on the way over and a goodly percentage died in the dealers' shops.
The survivors were sold, not to aviculturists who had proper accom-
modation for them, but to people who, tempted by the offer of a cheap
talking Parrot, bought one as a form of amusement, in the same way
as one would buy a wireless set these days. Very often the bird was
diseased and died in a short time and even those which were not dis-
eased often died through wrong feeding. I have known of many people
who had as many as six birds before they got one which lived.
Then, about the thousands of birds which were caught during
the breeding season and the young left to die of starvation. My
opponents will no doubt tell me that most of the Parrots imported into
this country were hand-reared by kindly natives .... A small percent-
age perhaps were, most of the Amazons and the majority of the Greys,
but what about the Eingnecks and Galahs which formed the greater
percentage of the " 30s. Talking Parrot and Cage " trade, also the
thousands of Lovebirds, Alexandrines, Budgerigars, Eosellas, etc. ?
These were the main sufferers. I have seen the floors of the crates and
cages containing these birds thick with dead and dying birds. Most
of these birds when they land are sold, in miserably small and inadequate
cages, to working-class people all over the country, and few birds
survived after the first twelve months. " All the better for the trade,"
say the dealers.
Few people realize that Parrots in a wild state do not feed upon
seed any more than " soft bills " feed upon soft food. They live
mainly on soft fruits, berries, and milky corn in the ear, if they can by
chance raid the plantations of natives. A goodly percentage of
Parrots die in the transition stage from the wild food to hard seed.
I do not want to appear like some politicians who merely denounce
the existing state of affairs without offering a solution to the problem.
Firstly, I would suggest that only certified collectors, of which there
are some very excellent ones now at work, should bring in a limited
number for aviculturists who have permits. These permits, I would
suggest, be given to any one desirous of breeding or keeping the birds
under decent conditions.
No doubt I shall be asked whether I am going to deny the working
man the pleasure of keeping a tame Parrot: this is a stock phrase and

Mr. Webb&apos;s Collection from the Cameroons
was, no doubt, used in a similar sense when a Bill to prevent dog- and
cock-fighting was suggested. I would stop any amusement when
it involved cruelty.
In New Zealand birds can only be imported by the Avicultural
Society, and much the same should be done here on an extended scale :
an official could easily be paid out of the profit arising out of the dis-
tributing of the birds. On the other hand, Parrots could be imported
to people such as the Keston Bird Farm, Ltd., who seem to make
a success of the breeding of the rarer Parrots. Birds bred from such
wild-caught stock would be strong and free from in-breeding.

Mr. Webb returned from the French Cameroons at the end of
April with a wonderful collection of birds, most of which were seen for
the first time as living specimens in this country. Ceratogymna atrata,
a medium-sized black Hornbill with blue wattles, is a curious and
interesting form. Three specimens of Ispidina picta picta, a lovely,
small insectivorous Kingfisher, were perhaps as beautiful and as inter-
esting as anything in the collection. Mr. Webb imported the sub-species
from Portuguese East Africa a few years ago. A small Tinker Barbet,
Gogoniulius leucolamia leucolamia, was certainly new to this country.
The Gaboon Forest Bo bin, Stiphrornis erythrothorax &apos; erythrothorax,
belonging to a genus no member of which has reached this country
before, was perhaps the most exciting form from the purely ornithological
point of view. Systematists are not agreed upon the true position of
this genus, for by some it is considered nearly allied to the Sylviidce,
while others are inclined to place it in the Turdidce. It is to be hoped
that whoever has the chance of observing its habits in confinement
will put on record any points which may help to show more clearly
its real relationship. Two Bush Shrikes of different genera, Laniarius
luhderi and Malaconolus cruentus gabonensis, were both very attractive,
the former more particularly on account of its tameness, curious calls,

and lively disposition, and tlie latter, a female, on account of its striking
colour. Seven species of Sunbirds, six being new, were represented,
Anthreptes tephrolcema tephrolcema, A. collaris hypodila, Cyanomitra
verticalis cyanocephala, Chalcomitra angolensis ongolensis, Cinnyris
minullus minullus, and C. superbus superbus. The most interesting
were the Cyanomitra, a genus not before imported alive, and Cinnyris
minullus, the smallest of the African Sunbirds, while for beauty of
plumage Chalcomitra angolensis and Cinnyris superbus must be given
an equal place. Mr. Webb was certainly lucky, as well as skilful, in
procuring angolensis, undoubtedly a very rare species in the locality
he visited. A new Glossy Starling, Lamprocolius purpureiceps, was
a splendid introduction to aviculture, and must be counted one of the
finest species of a very beautiful genus.
Among the Ploceidce the pair of Pirenestes ostrinus rothschildi
were of extraordinary beauty, and Malimbus cassini was the finest
of that interesting genus of insect-eating Weavers, other species repre-
sented being M. nitens and M. scutatus. The insectivorous Negro
Finches, of which there were three species, Nigrita fusconata fusconata,
N. bicolor brunnescens, and N. canicapilla canicapilla, were among
the more striking additions to aviculture, and it will be interesting
to see if they prove willing to breed. It was pleasant indeed to see a
new sub-species of Mandingoa, namely M. nitidula schlegeli : it is
certainly more beautiful than the forms which arrived from South and
East Africa last year. To complete the list we must mention
Spermophaga pustulata, perhaps not so good as the species brought
back last year from the Usambaras, and two extremely lovely
Waxbills Estrilda nonnula and E. atricapilla.

TAME BIRDS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9969432" page_id="56222772"  page_num="160" year="" vol="">
The article " Two Tame Birds " in your March issue gave me a great
deal of pleasure inasmuch as it must appeal particularly to the member
whose experience of aviculture is not particularly great and whose oppor-
tunities of experimenting are, for various reasons, limited. In my own case
I started with Waxbills in a large cage outside, followed very shortly by
a small aviary with Diamond Doves, Java Sparrows, and Rainbow Buntings.
Next an octagonal aviary 7 feet across with Longtails, Zebras, Cubans,
and Singing Finches ; and still something lacking. So after lunch, reading,
and inquiry, I bought a Golden-fronted Fruitsucker, believing him to have
a golden voice and confiding manner. He was all Mr. Workman says he is.
He flung orange, apple, grape skins, pips, and unwanted ants' cocoons all
round the room and shouted l i ke an urchin. Meal-worms he despised, but
the sight or sound of a fly would drive him nearly frantic until I had caught
it for him. But he was no use as a tame, really tame, bird. He was only
happy in his cage. Outside of it he sat motionless for hours and had to be
driven in again without deriving any benefit. I had no permanent aviary
accommodation for him as I dare not put him with smaller birds on account
of the vicious disposition I believed these birds to have. So back he went
to the dealer for a pound less than I gave for him.
I then built two aviaries round an existing privet hedge and some laurel
bushes. In May I put a " pair " of Spreo Starlings in one and a pair of
Shamas in the other. Both very quickly became tame and always came
to a point of vantage on my approach. One Starling I frequently had out
in the garden where it would follow me about or explore for insects without
ever leaving its bounds. The other was more adventurous and occasionally
spent a night out, eventually disappearing altogether after some weeks.
At liberty Spreos are delightful but in an aviary or cage are bored and
uninteresting, except when singing their peculiar repetition song, through
their teeth as it were, with a mouth full of meal-worms all wriggling in a row.
They made no attempt to nest.
The Shamas were the more attractive and both sang a few loud notes,
the cock only whistling softly to himself in a comer quite hidden from view.
Twice the hen escaped but returned immediately to the meal-worm tin.
Though not showy I think the hen Shama an extremely beautiful bird and
very graceful.
Now I am waiting for someone to follow Mr. Workman's example and
let us have a similar article on birds perhaps less well known but as beautiful,
tame, and easy to care for as the two he finds so pleasing. I feed mine on
mosquito with occasional carrot, apple, Bemax, or halibut oil mixed into it.

Most bird-keepers at some time or another seem to be troubled with
that foul pest, the common mouse. It is one of those pests which no amount
of cleanliness will keep out of one's bird-room. When once a mouse gets in
it almost seems as though by some kind of telepathy it communicates the

knowledge to all its friends in the neighbourhood, and in a month or two
it will appear that one is keeping mice rather than birds.
Not only are mice dangerous, often frightening birds in the night and
causing them to crack their skulls, turning out nesting birds, and eating
and fouling all the food, but they cause one's bird-room to reek of such a
disgusting odour.
If one has a brick and slate building it is exceedingly difficult to eradicate
them in spite of every effort. My first greenhouse aviary I had to abandon
owing to the mice getting in the earth and the flower-pots. In fact just over
twelve months ago my bird-room got so overrun that I despaired of ever
getting rid of the pests. Happening to relate my troubles to Mr. Seth-Smith,
he showed me an extremely ingenious trap of his own invention which he
told me had rid the bird-house in the Gardens of all these undesirable
occupants. I took careful measurements and got one of my workmen to
make a couple. In just over six months I must have caught about 300 ! and
have completely rid my bird-room and aviaries of them. These traps can be
used in any aviary with impunity.
Several of my friends have had similar ones made and have used them
with equal success. The only thing to remember is to let the mice get into
the box before setting the traps inside so that it gets a " mousey " smell:
this seems to give the mice confidence to enter.
The object of this letter is to try and induce Mr. Seth-Smith to kindly
give particulars of his ingenious invention through the medium of the
Magazine, and I am sure if he does so he will earn the eternal blessing of
Aviculture. Just one more word, seed scattered near the entrance-holes
helps to entice the mice in and the trap should never be cleaned out, the
worse it smells the more it attracts the mice.

ARRIVAL OF SWALLOWS

Although our scientists have as yet no knowledge of the fact that our
climate is rapidly changing the birds know it, however, for on 6th April
last I saw a pair of Swallows, in vigorous condition, flirting over Staines Bridge.
On 13th April I saw another pair at Lingfield, Surrey. On 26th April, in
motoring from Cowes to Ventnor, I.O.W., I saw several pairs. Swallows
also remained in the Isle of Wight last winter until the second week in
December.
H. Moore, F.Z.S.
[The Swallow arrives in this country, as a rule, in the second week of
April, but there are records of its appearance earlier in the year, and as long
ago as 1774 one was seen by Gilbert White on 4th April. --Ed.]

FIRST IMPORTATION OF THE CAROLINA DUCK

<bodyText confidence="0.940362047619048" page_id="56222774"  page_num="162" year="" vol="">
Mr. Hugh S. Gladstone has sent me the following note, which is of such
interest that with his permission I give it wider publicity. He writes : "I have
found the following statement in Mrs. A. M. W. Stirling's (nee Pickering)
book, Annals of a Yorkshire House (1911), vol. i, p. 50.
" ' The Carolina Duck has laid no eggs.'
" This is a statement by one. Peach, the gardener at Cannon Hall, Barnsley,
Yorkshire, in a letter written to William Spencer (circa 1745).
" Is not this a very early date for the presence of the Carolina Duck in
England ? "
It is indeed (perhaps the earliest), for it is about the same date as Edwards'
first description under the name " Summer Duck " and only just over ten
years before it was first named Anas sponsa by Linne in 1758. The first
birds to reach Europe were probably brought by those returning from the
various Virginia Company expeditions, say about 1700, and if so England,
we can presume, was the most likely place in Europe for their first arrival,
as the original Company was an English one. The birds at Cannon Hall
may well have been the actual birds seen both by Edwards and Linne. They
would naturally have been popular and by Latham's time were evidently
quite common, for he writes (vol. x, 1824), " often kept tame . . . and breed
freely."

(.Myiomoira toitoi)
The bird represented in the accompanying plate is, in spite of its
trivial name, in no way related to the true Titmice (Paridse), but belongs
to that large group of Australasian Flycatchers, which includes the
lovely genus Petroica.
The photo has been lent by Mr. Porter, and the plate should properly
have accompanied his article on the species in " Notes on New Zealand
Birds " published in the Magazine for January, 1934. The reason
for including it now is that it seems to us a pity not to make use of
,so excellent and unusual a photograph, giving, as it does, an almost
exact representation of the bird, the colour of its plumage being black
and white. Moreover, the small white patches on each side of the
beak are clearly shown, although normally they are hidden unless
the bird is excited.
The species is confined to the North Island, but the closely allied
M. macrocephala macrocephala is found in the South Island, while
M. m. dieffenbachii and M. m. marrineri are confined respectively
to the Chatham Islands and to the Auckland Islands.
There can be little doubt that a bird which in the wild state " becomes
exceedingly familiar, very much like our own robin ", would make a
charming and intelligent addition to aviculture.

The Yellow-breasted Shrike or Thickhead (Pachycephala
kandavensis)
I only saw this lovely bird once, though I heard it many times.
I was attracted to it by its flow of extremely melodious notes. These
birds are hard to distinguish when in the trees, for their plumage
harmonizes so well with the foliage in spite of their bright colouring.
Perouse's Fruit Dove (Ptilinopus perousei marice)
This is one of the exquisite Doves which adorn the forests of Fiji.
A more lovely creature cannot be imagined, but the full beauty of
its plumage is seen by few except the so-called " sportsman "--
usually an Englishman, who carries his traditional love of " sport "
to the South Seas--who slaughters it, for this bird is exceptionally
wary and difficult to approach, at least I found it so. It is found in
small flocks in the forest; the flocks are composed of pairs, the brilliant'
male and his sombrely coloured spouse flying together.
They come out to feed on the berry-bearing trees very early in the
mornings, and can be seen moving about in the trees with a rapidity
which is very unPigeon-like. In fact all the Fruit Pigeons are
exceedingly active during the period they are feeding. Afterwards
they seem to get lethargic and remain motionless for hours. These
birds are especially fond of the Perminto or " All-spice " berry. In an
old and now disused plantation of these trees near Suva the birds were
very abundant, but one could never get close enough to study their
habits. The flight of these birds is exceedingly swift and totally unlike
that of any other Pigeon. Locally it is known as the Painted Dove,
but I am sure " Rainbow Dove " would be more appropriate, for no
bird looks more as though it had been painted through human agency.
I heard from time to time of people who had some of the Fruit
Doves in captivity, but I never succeeded in getting hold of any.

The Flame Dove (Chryscena victor)
I feel that I must make a mention of this very remarkable bird,
even though I did not see it, for I am told that owing to collectors
shooting so many birds it is now rare, which is to be greatly regretted,
for it is one of the world's most remarkable birds. About the size of
a small Turtle Dove, but much plumper in form, it is clothed with a
raiment of hair-like feathers of the most dazzling flame orange, so
bright in fact that the eyes are almost dazzled when looking at it.
A gentleman in Suva, a keen naturalist and a painter of remarkable
merit, showed me the painting of a young male in the transitionary
stage, in which it was changing from the uniform silvery pea-green
of the young bird to the glory of the adult; the bird had a ground
colour of green, but was uniformly spotted with the brilliant flame
orange, a most remarkable creature.
The flight of the male through the dark forest is said to be like
" the passage of a rocket on a dark night
The only record of this wonderful bird being kept in captivity is
in 1875, when we are told in the P.Z.S., 1875, p. 437 : " Mr. Kleinsmidt,
a gentleman in Laveka much addicted to natural history, has preserved
one of these birds alive for more than a year, feeding it on wild berries
fetched daily from the forest. In uttering its bark it opens its lower
mandible wide and then closes it with a snap, jerking its head at the
same moment. It is very fond of the sun, preening its feathers and
4 shaking itself together '. If kept in the shade it mopes and sits with
feathers all puffed out and looking wretched."
Layard, who lived in Fiji, says of this bird : " Those . . . who have
shot the ' Cock of the Rock ', can readily picture to themselves the
' flame ' of the Orange Dove, as he pursues some rival through the
green forest--the eye is fairly dazzled as the orange ball on golden
wings turns and twists in the sunlight. Dull days do not suit him a bit,
and he hides away and mopes, never uttering a sound ; but with the
bright sun he emerges from his retreat and ' clucks ' to his green wife
from many ' a cool retreat " C. victor feeds on many sorts of
small and large berries and fruits, swallowing them whole."
I tried hard to get hold of a pair of these birds, but was unsuccessful ;

the only way to obtain them would be to get young ones from the nest
and hand-rear them.
One gets no idea of the real beauty of the bird from skins, for the
iridescent orange soon fades after death.
The Golden Dove (Chryscena luteovirnes)
Amongst the renowned Doves of Fiji this bird takes a high place
and fortunately it is also one of the commonest. When handled in
the skin " Golden Dove 55 seems rather a misnomer, for upon death
the colour fades to pale greenish-golden yellow. But seen in life flashing
through the forests it appears like a ball of golden light. Not only
is it remarkable on account of its plumage, but also on account of its
call. When I first came to Viti Levu I was greatly surprised to hear in
the forests the deep bark of a seemingly large dog. A loud sonorous
" Whoof, whoof! ", to be followed by another bark a distance off.
I thought at first that this must be a large native dog, for there are
no wild dogs of any kind in the South Sea Islands ; in fact I don't
think there are any endemic mammals of any kind in Fiji. I learned
soon afterwards that this was the call of the " Barking Dove ", as it
is known to Europeans in Fiji.
I often used to see many of these lovely birds on the edge of a native
clearing just outside Suva ; they could be seen at any time of the day
feeding in the low berry-bearing trees.
The feathers of this bird are different from those of any other Dove
and are glossy in texture and lanceolate in shape.
The Nutmeg Pigeon (Muscadivores latrans)
This Pigeon, so called from its partiality for nutmegs, is greatly
sought after by the natives, who shoot it and bring large bundles into
Suva for sale. Unfortunately its number is now greatly decreased
and the bird is extremely wary. I was never able to get within many
hundreds of yards of the ones I saw, which were always perched on the
limbs of dead trees on the look out for enemies. Often natives will
take great bundles of these birds into the town and, owing to the high
price they ask, are unable to sell them. They will keep the bodies for
a day or two then throw them away, going into the forests for a fresh

supply. Most of the Pigeons are protected and the sale of the protected
birds is prohibited, the natives getting over this handicap by plucking
the birds of all their feathers before exposing them for sale ;
consequently only an expert can tell their species. So that it looks as
though a few more years would see the extinction of this bird.
The Fijian White-throated Pigeon (&lt; Janthcenas vitiensis)
This bird is known in Fiji as the " Chili Pigeon ", owing to its
feeding to a large extent on capsicums. It is one of the few so-called
" game-birds " of Fiji and is greatly persecuted by the " Whites ",
who in the open season slaughter great numbers. Fortunately this
Pigeon is supposed to retire into the almost inaccessible mountain
forests in the interior of Viti Levu to breed, so during that part of the
year it is safe from persecution ; it has not decreased to the extent of
the previously mentioned bird.
This is a large bird, somewhat resembling the English Wood-pigeon,
but has a white band across the throat. I brought a pair of these birds
away from Fiji with me, and later on about a dozen were sent from Fiji
to New Zealand. I only brought one pair away with me as there only
seemed to be one hen ; this bird lacked the white throat. At first
I thought this was a sign of immaturity, but since I brought the bird
home it has bred several times but has never developed the white
throat. I find these birds very hardy ; mine stay out all the winter in
any aviary with an unheated shelter. Unfortunately success has never
crowned their efforts at breeding, something has always happened to
the youngster--either it has been killed by other birds, taken by rats,
or killed by an early frost. The parents seem as easy and anxious to
breed as ordinary domestic Pigeons, and eggs are laid in all manner of
places, often most unsatisfactory ones. Though very affectionate to
each other, they are extremely pugnacious to other Pigeons, and it is
impossible to keep another bird of the Pigeon species in their aviary.
Stair's Ground Pigeon (Gallicolumba stairi)
This bird belongs to the group of White-fronted Ground Pigeons
which is distributed over many of the Pacific Islands. I only saw this
bird in Kandavu, where it lives amongst the thick undergrowth in the

forests. Unfortunately in the islands where the mongoose has been
introduced it is nearly extinct. I was lucky in securing from a person in
Suva an example of a very rare form from the Caroline Islands, known
as the White-fronted Amethyst Ground Pigeon (G. kubaryi). This is
a very beautiful but extremely spiteful bird. It has killed several of
my other Pigeons, including ones nearly twice its own size. It also
slew a mate which someone kindly gave me for it in New Zealand ;
this was the commoner White-fronted Ground Pigeon ( G . jobiensis)
from New Guinea and the surrounding islands. The male was in
breeding condition and wanted to nest even in the crate coming over,
and one morning on going my round of the cages on the boat I found
the female practically torn to pieces and stripped of nearly every feather.
The Caroline Island Pigeon is one of the most beautiful of the smaller
Pigeons, having the forehead, throat, and upper breast snow white
while the back and wings are lovely shining amethyst purple ; the nape
is pale grey and the rest of the plumage slatey black.
Its habits in a wild state, I suppose, would not differ from the Fijian
species, which seems, as far as I could see, to live a solitary existence
in the dense undergrowth, only rising when one almost treads on it.
It soon settles down into the undergrowth again.
The Fijian Eail (Hypotcenidia philippinensis sethsmithi)
In the swamps, often around the villages, on Kandavu Island I found
Seth-Smith's Eail abundant. It is a sub-species of the well-known
Banded or Philippinean Eail, which is distributed all over the islands
of the Pacific, Australia, and New Zealand in varying sub-species.
On Viti Levu, in common with all other ground birds, this species
has been practically exterminated by the mongoose. It is a very shy
and retiring species and as soon as it sees an intruder it quickly dis-
appears into the thick vegetation.
I was fortunate in getting hold of a pair of these birds when in
Viti Levu, which I brought home with me. They stood the journey well
and settled down in my aviaries. Unfortunately soon after my arrival
home rats made their appearance in my aviaries. They soon took one
of these and I straightway moved the other birds into another aviary ;
the rats followed and took another. I bad five birds, two of the species

from Fiji and three of an allied kind (H. p. assimilis). No matter into
what aviary I put them the wretched rats followed and were not content
until they had all the birds. I think they must have had a very strong
scent because they did not molest other species of waterfowl.
The Fijian Scarlet Sunbird (Myzomela jugularis)
This very lovely Sunbird is one of the tiniest birds found on the
islands, and is common everywhere. It is seen around the town of
Suva, where it frequents the garden and also the native plantations.
It is not nearly as conspicuous as the African Sunbirds, and in its
demeanour rather resembles a tiny creeper.
I have watched dozens of them as they seemed to work along with
the Zosterops. They are very tame and allow a close approach. The
food seems to consist more of tiny insects than nectar.
The Caterpillar-eater (Lalage woodi ?)
This handsome bird is one of the commonest of the Fijian species,
not counting, of course, the imported birds. It is a quiet and unassuming
bird, moving actively but silently through the foliage searching for the
insects which constitute its sole food. It is one of the few birds which
are continually active in the intense midday heat.
It is very common in and around Suva, where it is to be seen in
nearly all the gardens. The Caterpillar-eaters (Campephagidae), or
Cuckoo-Shrikes as they are sometimes called, are distributed all over
the tropical countries in the Old World and are especially common
on the islands of the Pacific.
The Fijian Kingfisher (Halcyon sacra vitiensis)
The Fijian Kingfisher is one of the well-known Sacred Kingfishers
which are found all over the islands of the South Seas, Australia, and
New Zealand. None of the various species differ very much from each
other except in the colouring of the breast. The bird in question is
one of the brightest coloured--brilliant blue on the wings, back, and
tail, the breast creamy white with faint black markings ; there is a
broad black stripe from the beak to the back of the head. The bird
also has a black cap on the head.

Sydney Porter--Notes on Birds of Fiji
He is a very common bird, and bis habitat is not necessarily near
water, for he is not a fish-feeder but subsists mainly on insects, small
crabs, centipedes, etc.
A friend once described the Fijian Kingfisher as the bird which
talked with its tail ! To those who know the bird this is a very apt
description, for no bird I know makes so much use of his caudal
appendage. When sitting still his tail is continuously jerked about at
all angles. He is a tame and confiding bird, and is often to be seen in
the gardens of Suva, but his favourite haunt is in the bush bordering
the mangrove swamps, where no doubt he feeds to a large extent
on the tiny crabs, which are so plentiful, and the strange little fish,,
Periophthalmus barbarus , which climb out of the water and take an
airing on the roots of the mangrove trees. On Kandavu Island I found
the Kingfisher very common.
The Fijian Fantail-Flycatcher (Haplornis lessoni)
A charming little sprite, clad in pale grey and white, and often met
with in the thick bush bordering the native clearings on Kandavu
Island. The bird is nothing like as familiar as his New Zealand name-
sake, and I don't think he belongs to the same family as that bird.
Its actions are very Warbler-like as it hunts through the dense
vegetation for the small insects upon which it feeds. He is inquisitive
and will come out of the undergrowth to get a good look at one, but he
is soon off again and never stays round like the New Zealand Fantail.
It is not a common bird and I did not observe it many times whilst
in Fiji.
The Kandavu Honey-eater (Meliphaga provocator)
This strange bird is very characteristic of Kandavu. It is the first
bird one hears on entering the forest, and its loud melodious notes can
be heard from a long distance. I usually saw the birds in pairs in the
forests and mangroves bordering the seashore. In most tropical
countries the forest, when it has been untouched by man, comes right
down to the water's edge, but in Fiji the forest seems to run right into
the sea. It is a very strange experience when walking in the forest to
come suddenly right on to the sea itself. One often sees forest giants

standing in the salt water, their roots being quite covered at high
tide, though, of course, these do not go far out, the forest usually
trailing off into the mangrove swamps which often go quite a distance
out to sea. It is here that the Kandavu Honey-eater seems to be most
plentiful, and it is heard long before it is seen. It is a shy and wary bird,
and it is only after patient watching that one can get a glimpse of these
peculiar looking creatures.

BREEDING OF COURIER WATER-TYRANT
(Fluvicola climazura climazura)
By J. Delacour

<bodyText confidence="0.998739409090909" page_id="56222791"  page_num="171" year="" vol="">
In most parts of South America one sees along streams and ditches
and even in towns and gardens some very pretty white, grey, and black
birds, which remind one of our Wagtails. But their tails are shorter,
their bills slightly flatter, and their actions quite different, although
they have the same way of running prettily on the soil.
They are Water-Tyrants of the genus Fluvicola. Many years ago
I saw many of the white-shouldered species (.Fluvicola pica) in Guiana
and in Venezuela, and I was very much struck with their attractive
appearance. But I was told that they could not live in captivity.
Fortunately M. C. Cordier, of Pernambuco, has found the way of
keeping most Brazilian birds alive in his aviaries, and afterwards to
send them to us.
I got my first Water-Tyrants (F. climazura) more than two years
ago. They arrived, it is true, in poor condition, and only two survived.
Let out in one of my tropical houses, they soon settled down and
enjoyed immensely the stones and water-lilies of the pond. They
proved tame and harmless to other birds. But they probably were of
the same sex, as after over a year no attempt at breeding took place.
They are purely insectivorous birds and take readily to the usual
mixture, a little raw meat and a few meal-worms.
Last summer I received two more specimens which, after they
sufficiently recovered, were let out with the first two. Things did not

go smoothly : fights took place and after some time two were killed.
The two remaining birds were evidently a pair.
Early last winter they started carrying moss and small twigs and
soon built a purse-shaped nest, rather loosely made, in a creeper at
a height of 8 feet overhanging the pond. I do not know how many eggs
were laid, as I did not wish to disturb the birds, but after about twelve
days the nest was found to be empty and one broken egg, containing
a well-developed chick, was found at some distance on the soil.
Soon after another nest was built, in another creeper 2 yards
away from the first one and higher up still. Eggs were laid again and,
on 25th February, two young Tyrants left the nest. They are exactly
like the parents but smaller and with a shorter tail. The eggs are
greyish olive, much marked and speckled with darker grey and brown.
One chick was weak and died after three days, being found in the pond.
The other one developed normally, and it is now indistinguishable from
the parents. The young were reared quite easily on the parents' diet--
insectile mixture, raw meat, and a few meal-worms.
A third clutch was laid in the same nest in May, and on the 26th
three strong young ones came out. They are now in perfect health
and although they had a new brood the parents have never so far
molested their first baby. It is the more remarkable that they try to
attack savagely a newly imported specimen in a neighbouring aviary.
As Mr. de Quincey tells me, these Water-Tyrants are quite hardy,
and his pair wintered safely out of doors this year. They also bred
but the young died soon after they came out of the nest. There is no
doubt that tropical birds have a much better chance to rear their
offspring when always kept at a favourable and even temperature,
as is the case in my greenhouses. Three years ago a pair of Shamas
reared two full broods without losses in one of the compartments ;
and one knows that, although they nest freely, the young are not too
easy to breed in an outdoor aviary. Also it may interest our readers
to hear that my Hooded Pittas have young again. The breeding pair
is composed of the old hen and one of her sons bred last year.
To come back to our Water-Tyrants. I shall say that they are most
attractive birds in colour, shape, and behaviour. They look very
different and much nicer than most members of their family. Always

active, tame, and amusing in their way of walking on the water-lily
leaves or running on the rocks, they often display their wings and tails

The size of a Robin, they are high on the legs, with a slender bill and
moderate tail and wings. Their plumage is white and rather fluffy
((they are often called " cotton birds "). A stripe through the eye at the
back is cinerious, slightly brownish ; tail black, tipped with white ;

THE GREENFINCH IN CAPTIVITY

By Dr. E. Hopkinson
Although of no great interest as a cage-bird apart from the ease
with which it can be kept and even bred under suitable circumstances,
the Greenfinch would seem from the records to be the chief hope of
those who hope to provide a supply of aviary- or cage-bred British
birds to take the place of those whose capture is now illegal. I am
.afraid, however, that it will be found that what artificially reared birds
nre obtained will not turn out to have the stamina or long life of
wild-bred ones and that breeding to several generations will not be
the easy matter some seem to expect. However, in everything optimism
is a good thing, and this is a suitable opportunity to collect in one place
the records of what has been done in the way of keeping and breeding
these birds.
The Common Greenfinch (Chloris chloris (Linn.)) has been a well-
known cage-bird from the earliest times, but not much valued except
.as a possible father of mules. There are many records of their having
been bred both in cage and aviary; among British ones are A.M., i, 124,
and B.N., 1913, 43, while for abroad Neunzig ( Einh ., p. 363) says that
they are easily bred and gives an account of their being reared in
numbers by Professor Liebe in Germany. He appears to have given
most of those he reared their liberty, and this raises the question of
what can be done except this, if one does succeed in rearing generations
of unsaleable birds. The advertisements which appear nowadays of

close-ringed " aviary-bred " Greenfinches and other birds are, of course,
merely a result of the Wild Bird Act of 1934 and of no value as records,
and many of the older records are also too vague ; for instance, Page in
B.N., viii, 202, says : "In the past ... I have bred the Greenfinch,
Bullfinch and Goldfinch freely, and also reared single broods of the
Siskin and Twite,' 5 but how many of these and other similar records
are worth much ? In how many of the cases did the young live to
moult ? In how many did they live for a year or more, and was even
a second generation reached in a single case ?
The Algerian race (C . chloris aurantiiventris (Cab.)) has been at the
Zoo, and is no doubt kept occasionally in its own country ; it is a larger
and brighter edition of our bird. The Chinese Greenfinch (C . c. sinica
(Linn.)), with a larger yellow wing-patch than the European race, is
kept in China, has been at the Zoo, and a pair was exhibited at the
Crystal Palace about 1892. Shore Baily bred the race in 1915, two young
birds being hatched on 30th June, but both were dead by November.
Neunzig also records that in Prince Coburg's collection, thirty or more
years ago, a pair got as far as eggs [Einh., 361).
The Japanese race (C. c. kawarhiba (Temm.)) is no doubt kept in its
own country, and there are two records of breeding in Europe, with the
male European Greenfinch and hybrids with the male Goldfinch. It
is very like the European bird, but duller and slightly smaller.
The following are the hybrid records I know of :--
Greenfinch x Japanese Greenfinch.
Recorded by Vale as having been bred and as having produced
fertile offspring. The cross is of course not a true hybrid, being merely
interracial.
Greenfinch X Sikhim Siskin ( Spinus tibetanus Hume).
There is unfortunately a good deal of confusion in the account of
this and the next species, both as to true and cross-breeding.
Shore Baily in B.N., 1914, 216, 245, using the name tibetanus y
records the rearing of one hybrid ; for this he was awarded the F.B.C.
Medal (B.N., Sept., inset). Writing later (A.M., 1919, 92), the breeder
says that he finds he was mistaken and that the name of the females
should have been spin aides, not tibetanus ; he adds that about the-

same date Teschemaker also bred some " Greenfinch X Himalayan
Siskin hybrids " which were different to his. Shore Baily's hybrid
was exhibited at the L.C.B.A. Show, 1914, and figured in Bird Notes
(1915, p. 11). The figure suggests in shape the more Greenfinch-like
spinoides rather than tibetanus. More evidence and more records
are needed. On what we have at present to go on, I take it that the
spinoides hybrid has certainly been bred, and perhaps the tibetanus
ones as well, for Teschemaker's hybrids may well have been this, as
he recorded the breeding of Spinus tibetanus about that time.
Greenfinch x Himalayan Siskin ( Hypacanthis spinoides (Yig.)).
See above.

Bright records the rearing of two young hybrids in 1917 (B.N.,
1917, 195). He gives the cross the other way round, but Page records
it as above. Which was correct ?
Chinese Greenfinch x Himalayan Siskin (H. spinoides).
Shore Baily in B.N., 1919, reports the rearing of six young hybrids
of this cross. He evidently had males of both the European and Chinese
Greenfinches (see above under No. 2).
Chinese Greenfinch X Goldfinch.
Were bred at the Zoo, fertile hybrids which crossed again with the
European Goldfinch, teste A. G. Butler, i, 138. But I believe that the
hybrids were really the other way round, Goldfinch X Chinese
Greenfinch.
The above hybrid X Goldfinch, teste Butler ; again I think it
was vice versa.
Greenfinch x Chaffinch.
Recorded by Page, but I think that his statement was based on
B.N., 1912, 215, where the cross the reverse way is recorded. I have,
however, a letter from the late Mr. G. Crabb, in which he tells me that
he had (in 1919) a specimen of this cross in his collection of skins, which

he believed was bred by Miss Reeves, who bred the Brambling-
Chaffinch hybrids.
Greenfinch X Mexican Rosefinch ( Carpodacus mexicanus (Muller)).
Bred by Wade in 1914, a first for the United Kingdom, and I do
not think it has been bred since. See B.N., 1915, Jan. inset., where the
name used is " Ruddy Finch
Greenfinch x Scarlet Rosefinch (C. erythrinus (Pallas)).
This cross is on record, but I think an error, for the real cross was
the other way (Tomlinson in 1916), see B.N., 1916, 206, 256 ; 1917,
123. There may have been doubt about which species of Rosefinch
was the father, but it seems certain that the Greenfinch was the female
parent.
Greenfinch X Bullfinch.
A not uncommon show bird, at any rate in the past, when one used
to expect to see an example or two at the big shows. Yale and Page
mention the cross, Neunzig ( Einh ., 335) says it has been bred abroad,
and Allen Silver includes it in the list of hybrids which have certainly
been obtained, which he gave in A.M., 1911, 351.
Greenfinch X Canary.
Commonly bred and often to be seen at shows.
Hybrids in which the Greenfinch was the female parent have also
been recorded as follows :--
With males of the Chaffinch, Goldfinch, Siskin, Himalayan Siskin,
H. Siskin x Greenfinch hybrid, Twite, Linnet. Lesser Redpoll, Scarlet
and Mexican Rosefinches. The female Japanese Greenfinch has also
reared young to a male Goldfinch.
There the records are for what they are worth. I personally am
satisfied with most, but should welcome further proofs and new records.
It may be as well to explain the abbreviations used.

By J. C. Swan
I was told by my friends that I should never get my birds home in
the winter, and when on board ship in the Indian Ocean I read in the
News that the maximum temperature in London was 36 degrees on
certain days in November, I began to think my friends might be correct.
However, I could not choose the time of my arrival in England, so on
a broiling hot day, in Dar-es-Salaam, the birds were " shipped ". Yes !
" shipped " is the correct term, for those who have done it once know
that it is as easy to ship as many tons of Sisal as it is to get on board
a similar number of boxes containing " Live Birds To the
inexperienced the procedure of shipping a " cargo " of birds may be
interesting, so I will describe it. First the " cargo " must be measured,
weighed, the freight calculated, and paid, and the freight receipt
produced to the steamship company's agents at the time the crates
are finally handed over for loading on to the steamer. These duties,
one would imagine, would all be performed at the same office--perhaps
by the same clerk, in the same manner as a parcel is consigned by the
railway, but not so with steamship companies--these separate duties
which comprise the routine of shipping cargo must be performed by
separate companies. Usually there is a landing and shipping company
to do the measuring, etc., etc., and a wharfage company to do the
actual " shipping " of the goods. These companies appear invariably
to have their offices at opposite ends of the town, the reason for which
must be either to prevent one department getting in the way of the other
and perhaps, by accident, doing some portion of the work belonging
to one of the other departments, or it may be to impress shippers
in general with the importance of each of these respective departments
and so attempt to justify the charges made. Well, after innumerable
journeys to and fro, with the birds, " freight " was paid and the birds
handed over to the wharfage company for " shipping " and troubles,
I imagined, were at an end. Later on I realized that they had only
just begun, for when the birds were put aboard the tug to be taken out
to the steamer lying at anchorage in the harbour, and I followed, I was

not allowed to accompany the birds, as the wharfage company's tug
was reserved for " cargo " only. I was obliged to hurry to another jetty
about half a mile down the quay, hire a motor-boat, and endeavour to
reach that ship before the tug which, to give it its due, had already
started on a special journey out to the ship in the harbour with my
ten boxes of birds in order that they should not be left lying about
in the sun. As the birds had been packed in ten ladies' hat-boxes of
the thinnest plywood for easy handling, they could not have weighed
as many pounds altogether !
Needless to say, with such a load the tug arrived at the ship first
and the birds had all been off-loaded before I reached the vessel I
was travelling by. There may be good business reasons for this
procedure, for most shipping companies prefer to do their loading and
unloading in privacy and not under the eyes of owners. On arrival
on board I found that the birds had been consigned to the care of the
butcher. I had already advised this good fellow that the consignment
was coming, so I eagerly sought him out and found that he had my
ten boxes neatly arranged on the top shelf of his butcher's shop--
a room about 10 by 8 feet, where all the meat for the ship's 400 souls
was cut up and distributed. There was one port-hole to the butcher's
" shop " and an electric light bulb at about the level of the top shelf
supplied all the light that reached this compartment. The temperature,
I should think, would be well over 100 degrees. My heart sank as I con-
jectured how the Sunbirds and rare Finches would survive the journey
from Dar-es-Salaam round the Cape to Southampton in these surround-
ings, for such is the only accommodation that some of our largest vessels
have for livestock. My spirits rose when I was told that the captain
of the ship was an aviculturist, for it was quite obvious the birds could
not stay where they were, but there did not appear to be any other
place to put them. In a few minutes the " skipper " himself appeared,
and I was delighted to hear him give orders for a disused hospital
cabin astern to be cleared of bedding and the cages placed on the bunks.
I was given full access to the hospital deck and full use of this cabin.
Needless to say, that skipper and myself became the best of friends.
I do not intend to describe in great detail the birds in the collection,
which was neither representative of the bird life of Tanganyika nor

of any great importance. There were three specimens of the Usam-
bara Double-collared Sunbird (Cinnyaris mediocris usamharica )--one
.a particularly fine specimen, the velvet-like gloss on its feathers by
\0x25A0comparison with its condition when caught paying a high tribute
io the Horlick's and honey diet ; another had moulted while in
Africa, and the wing feathers had turned white in the first moult,
which, by the way, disposes of the theory that loss of pigmentation
is due to absence of sun's rays. These Sunbirds were caught while
on holiday in the Usambara Mountains, by baiting the flowers
they are partial to with a " limed " stick, placed so as to provide
,a natural perch, against the most likely tuft or spray which the bird
might select. The sticks must be watched, and as soon as the bird
.alights he is removed instantly and his feet washed with paraffin to
jremove all traces of lime.
After capture the bird is kept in a darkened cage for four days,
by which time he will have accustomed himself to the Horlick's diet,
on which he must be hand-fed until he will feed himself.
The other Sunbirds comprised a Kirks [Chalcomitra amethystina
kirki), the first importation, I believe, into England, a Scarlet-chested
.Sunbird (Chalcomitra senegalensis inestimata), and a Zambezi Collared
\0x25A0Sunbird [Anthre&apos;ptes collaris zambeziana )--a beautiful little bird with
golden green and coppery markings on back and wing coverts. There
was an incident regarding this bird which might be worth mentioning.
I did not catch it myself but secured it from a native, and arranged
to call and collect it on my return home from business later in the
afternoon. When I called for the bird at about 6 p.m. I found it on the
bottom of the cage, lying on its side, but there were just signs of move-
ment although its eyes were closed and its slender beak drooped on
do its chest when picked up. I noticed immediately that the bird was
without food (honey and water on which the natives feed them), and
it turned out that the native had forgot that afternoon when feeding
his birds to replace the food-pot. I put the bird in my handkerchief
(it could not stand, let alone fly) and rushed home with it, after having
put a few drops of the honey mixture into its beak.
I commenced hand-feeding it on a strong mixture of Horlick's and
honey, a few drops at intervals, and kept the bird wrapped in cotton-

wool for warmth and support. I hand-fed the bird all night, resetting
an alarm clock with each successive feed every hour. It is almost
unbelievable, but by morning the bird could stand on its perch, and
by midday was hopping about as sprightly as on the day before--
proving that where Sunbirds are concerned the Horlick's treatment
will pull them back from the grave.
Among seed-eaters were two pairs of Jamieson's and six pairs of
Peters' Spotted Firefinches, six Tanganyika Melba Finches, Violet-
ear and Black-cheek Waxbills, besides a number of the Lesser
St. Helena Waxbills.
The birds continued in the pink of condition until a day before our
arrival at Durban, when high seas sprang up, the thermometer fell
rapidly, and the ship rolled in all directions. The birds, like all the
passengers, looked distinctly off colour but bore the weather better
than many of the latter.
At this stage a small electric toaster with which I had provided
myself proved invaluable for, plugged into the ship's lighting circuit,
it was just sufficient to keep the temperature in the hospital cabin
up to slightly over 70 degrees. Also live ants' nests--clods of hard
earth which when broken up reveal the young ants and larvae--were
greatly enjoyed by the Peters' and Violet-ears, and were, I am sure, the
means of saving these birds during the rough passage into Durban.
By the way, I found that Peters' Spotted Firefinches prefer cooked,
meal-worms to the live worm, which they frequently left after just
biting the heads off. They are not easy birds to keep in robust con-
dition, unless they can be fed on some form of insectivorous food which
they like. Live ants in the nest they relish, and will fight over a dishful.
From Durban to Cape Town the weather was milder but getting-
cooler, and my portable electric toaster was doing duty night and day.
After the Cape the temperature rose until we crossed the Equator a
second time, and was warm all the way to the Canary Islands, there-
after gradually getting colder, but by this time the birds did not appear
to care what the temperature was, for they were all in splendid condition.
The ship berthed at Southampton at 8 p.m. one evening in November
and troubles again commenced over the cargo of birds--this time over
the unloading.

J. C. Swan--Notes on a Voyage home from Africa in Winter 181
By a mistake in the bill of lading--which was not noticed until after
my departure from Africa, for abroad bills of lading are never issued
until after a vessel has left port--the birds, comprising the 44 cargo ",
had been consigned to London. It was first argued that cargo for London
could not be landed at Southampton, and that if the steamer did land
the " cargo " the Customs would not clear cargo at night. Actually,
by this time the cases had been taken off the ship by a well-tipped
crew and were reposing with the rest of my personal luggage in the
Customs' shed, but I was too interested in the argument that the
Customs' officials were having with the steamer's agent over clearing
cargo at night and landing same at ports other than to which shipped
to interrupt. When difficulties appeared to be insuperable I remarked
that all that appeared necessary was to assess any duty on the birds
along with the duty on my personal belongings (if any) and as far as the
steamship company was concerned all they required was a receipt
for the cargo--no matter what the port of discharge might be. Birds
are not dutiable, but a certificate of origin should accompany them if
they are to be exempt. My birds had accompanied me and I had a
passport, so I had not prepared a certificate of origin for the birds, as
I had taken for granted that it would be assumed that the birds had
come from the same port as I had embarked myself. But one travels
and learns. A deposit for the duty, returnable on production of the
certificate of origin, which, by the way, is a declaration on a specified
form by the shipper of merchandise (myself in this case), was at last
accepted and the special boat train which by this time had waited
twenty minutes for me (the last passenger) and my luggage got away
and the most dreaded part of the journey commenced.
Shortly after midnight I unpacked the cases in front of a warm fire,
to find to my great surprise all birds on their perches and looking none
the worse for the journey. Actually the few casualties occurred well
after my arrival in England, and were to a great extent my own
fault through allowing the housemaid to make up the fire in the bird-
room late at night--result, loss of two Sunbirds through fright and
concussion. Never rely upon a coal fire to maintain an even
temperature--an oil-stove will do it admirably, that is for those who
do not indulge in luxuries such as thermostatically controlled heating.

<bodyText confidence="0.997301823529412" page_id="56222802"  page_num="182" year="" vol="">
By H. S. Sewell
Having successfully bred the Dufresne Waxbill, Coccopygia dufresnii
(hab. South Africa) just recently, I will give a few notes on this species
which I trust will be of interest.
Securing two pairs of these delightful little Waxbills a little over
twelve months ago, I released them in a selected breeding aviary, when
one pair soon started to build ; these were my rarest Waxbills at that
time and I might say my optimism ran riot. However, my hopes were
soon settled when it turned out to be only a sleeping nest, as did several
others which they built at different times last season : they proved
to be energetic nest-builders but that was all. I had the misfortune of
losing one of the hens, so this left me with only one true pair. It was
about this time, I believe, that restrictions on South African birds were
enforced, so I was unable to procure any more.
During the breeding season this year I erected a new breeding aviary
and in one compartment established a nice swath of grass ; in this house
I placed the pair of Dufresne's together with some Fire Finches. I
had not long to wait before the little Waxbills were building : they
selected a small nest-box high up in their sleeping quarters and all went
well until their approximate hatching date. This was in the latter part
of February, when a good old Australian heat wave set in, the mercury
soaring up to somewhere in the vicinity of 107 in the shade. Knowing
something was wrong at this stage I inspected the nest and found one
chick just hatched, but dead, and three eggs, the young dead
therein, which was very disappointing but after all not surprising
under the circumstances. In a little over a week the cock started
building again, choosing the same nesting site. A strong oval-shaped
nest was constructed and lined with feathers ; the first of four pure
white eggs was laid on 17th March, the hatching period occupying
fourteen days. Twenty-two days later, when feeding up, I apparently
disturbed the clutch, when four young birds flew from the nest. If
I said fell from the nest it would be nearer the mark ; apparently
they left home two days too soon. I think their parents held the same
view, as they literally flew around me like a pack of mosquitoes. It

was most interesting to watch the old birds enticing their youngsters
back to their elevated nest. On the opposite wall were a few gum
branches and extending from the top of these a perch reached to their
nest: using the branches as a ladder, they gradually coaxed their
family up a few inches at a time and eventually got them home ; two
or three days later the young birds were quite strong on the wing. The
colouring of the young Dufresne's is similar to an adult hen : head and
nape leaden grey, eyes brownish black, beak all black, but the lower
mandible changes to crimson approximately four weeks after leaving
the nest ; two phosphorescent spots each side at the base of the beak,
back and wing coverts olive green, primaries and secondaries grey
edged with green, upper tail coverts green tinged with red, rump red,
tail black ; throat, breast, and under parts very light grey ; legs
greyish black.
Inside of twelve days the young were independent, and the cock
bird in that time had built again ; incidentally this nest was spoilt by
the young birds, who constantly disturbed the hen whilst sitting.
At that time I was dubious about separating the youngsters, not
knowing they were independent.
The food supply consisted of seeding grasses, soaked seed, and a little
live food, together with the usual dry seeds.
I think the Dufresne's must be the most affectionate of the Waxbills,
especially the cock bird, who has the untiring habit of preening the
head and nape feathers of his lawful spouse until she becomes
practically featherless on those regions, displaying a most comical
appearance. Although my previous pair had a large flight aviary,
the hen was soon in the same condition.
I believe this species was bred for the first time in England or
Europe some few months ago ; it is therefore mainly my idea in
recording the above achievement to show that members over this side
of the world are also actively engaged in breeding the rarer Waxbills
and Finches.

Mr. Seth-Smith's good work for the Magazine during his long period
of editorship and still longer as member deserves more than passing
notice, and we think that this break in his labours may well be marked
by the publication of the following list of his contributions to our pages.
It offers a tribute to his industry and shows to all of us how much
we owe to him, the expert (as the record helps to show) on all that

The above has been taken from the Indices, and where entries have
been marked with an asterisk as having appeared in the Correspondence
Columns, the asterisk also appears here ; this practice seems to have
been dropped in recent years. An occasional abbreviation (such as
Zoo for the Zoological Gardens) has been used, and a few explanatory
notes added (in brackets) where such seemed likely to be useful.

It may interest you to know that the following records have reached
me from members of the British Bird Breeders' Association :--
British birds nesting--with eggs : Siskins, Linnets, Redpoles, Goldfinches,
Bullfinches, Starlings.
British birds with young hatched : Thrush (Song), Chaffinches, Green-
finches, Linnets, Blackbirds, Bullfinches.
The recent spell of cold weather (mid-May) has checked birds which were
nest-making, but does not seem to have affected those which had commenced
incubating.
The earliest record of Goldfinches came from Dundee.
Great interest is being taken in breeding our native birds this year, and
this newly formed association has now over 500 members.

FEEDING THE GREY PARROT

Will any member of the Avicultural Society please advise me ?
I feed my Grey Parrot (cet. 25) on boiled maize in the morning and in
the afternoon on the mixture advised by Lord Tavistock in Aviculture and
fresh and cooked fruit.
Besides this she gets pieces of milk pudding, suet pudding, cake, bread
and jam. Very often a rusk soaked in sweet tea. She is very fond of this.
She seems quite healthy but occasionally T have noticed she is very short
of breath and breathes heavily and sometimes she will fall off her perch. This
falling off her perch is usually in the evening after she has been covered up ;
except for being alarmed, she seems well.
I doubt if the maize is good for her, though she seems fond of it.
Are these " oddments ", pudding, etc., bad for her ? Should maize be
cut out altogether ? Besides Lord Tavistock's mixture and fruit is there
anything else one can give without doing harm ?

Correspondence
From my own limited experience and from what I hear elsewhere, I fear
the record will not be a very exhilarating one, but all these facts are of real
value for any future record ; I know too that the recording of losses is by no
means as pleasant a job as its opposite.
My own recent records were given on page 55 and were fairly satis-
factory, but their after-history is not quite the same, e.g.--
Greenfinches. --Two pairs ; four or five nests ; about twenty young
hatched, twelve left the nest, from June onwards ; three let go, nine over the
moult and looking in perfect health in October; then six died and by
1st December only three alive. Of these only one is left now (1st May, 1935).
Yellow Sparrows. --One pair; three nests ; one young bird left the
nest from the third ; through the moult by 1st December; died in the
winter.
In both cases the old birds still alive and nesting again.
When I issued a summary of the Records a year or two ago, I considered
that one could be fully satisfied with about 37 per cent, be more or less
satisfied with 39, while of the remaining 24 per cent the less said the better.
From correspondence I gather that those who use the Records may be
almost divided into two schools, those who doubt or discount, the whole,
and those who seem to take a species inclusion there as clear proof that
it has been bred. I hope that the mean is somewhere between these two
extremes.

THE PARROT BAN
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996711625" page_id="56222816"  page_num="196" year="" vol="">
Is it any wonder that the Avictjltttral Magazine grows smaller each
month when two of its five pages are given up to such an article as that on
the Parrot Ban. Almost wherever I go I make time to call on my poorer
neighbours who keep birds and though I have seen a great many Parrots
hardly one was out of condition.
If there are faults in the trade (which after all should be the practical way
to procure birds) surely these could be rectified without putting a ban on
one of the most fascinating families of birds in Aviculture.
Anyone reading Lord Tavistock's book should know how to keep a Parrot.
Let us spread knowledge by teaching --not prohibition. How much help
could be given to budding aviculturists by broadcasts on bird-keeping.
In my experience Parrots are one of the easiest birds to keep and soon
become part of the family.
It seems from the many accounts given by private importers that their
losses are exceedingly numerous, while the much maligned dealer manages
to land his charges in really good condition.
I am sorry this letter is so long but the matter is one of great importance
to all aviculturists.
Muriel Maxwell-Jackson.
[We respectfully draw attention to an inaccuracy in the above letter,
due, we are sure, to an oversight on the part of the writer, and would point
out that although last month's issue of the Magazine was unavoidably very
short, this can in no way have been due to an article appearing at the
same time.--E d.]

The present species bears a very close resemblance to the well-
known Hypargos niveiguttatus. It may, however, easily be distingnished
by the much paler general colouring and by the fact that the flank-
aspots in the male are washed with pink. The female shows only a tinge
of red on the upper tail-coverts.
The sudden appearance of this pretty little bird last year alive in
this country was, perhaps, one of the most unlooked for occurrences
*that could well have happened, for its history and the little that is
known of the species go to show that, even if not one of the rarest
*of the African Estreldidae it is certainly very local.
Hypargos margaritatus was first described by Strickland in 1844
\0x25A0from a specimen procured at the Cape and subsequently presumed to
be an individual escaped from captivity. It was not then heard of again
until 1906, when a pair arrived from Portuguese East Africa. In 1933
it suddenly made its appearance over here alive, and without any data
.as to locality. Even from this scanty information we can conclude with
*tolerable certainty that the species, though local, may be abundant
within its limited range, which appears to be the district of Inhambane,
in Portuguese East Africa.

(Hypargos niveiguttatus)
By Mrs. K. Drake
My Peter's were purchased at different times, one arriving only in
January of this year. I turned the pair out into the aviary during the
middle of March from a non-heated greenhouse, and towards the end
of the month a nest was built and three eggs laid, of which only one
hatched in very cold weather, the chick only surviving two or three-
days. The pair at once set to work to repair the nest and this time
four eggs were laid, about the 17th April, which hatched between the
28th April and the 1st May, according to the bits of egg-shell seen
around. A basket-nest was chosen, made for me--my own design---by
the inmates of the Plymouth Blind Institution ; I might here add that
last year the Cordon Bleus and Common Firefinches reared their young
in the same sort of basket-nests made by the same Institution. The
nest itself was the ordinary domed affair that most Waxbills build of
hay and feathers.
Two birds left the nest on the 17th May and two more on the day
following. During the period the young were in the nest I placed in a.
tiny dish a little egg-biscuit food slightly moistened with water, to
which occasionally I added a pinch of Marmite ; also I gave a spoonful
of " Mosquito ", and sometimes, to make a change, I would mix the
two together. Very few meal-worms were taken and some days, it.
seemed, none at all. I could get no live ants' eggs or cocoons so could
not give any, and I never bother about the dried ones as I consider
they are only fit to mix in a proper insectivorous mixture. The birds,
enjoyed spray millet; they also had canary seed and Indian millet,.

but would not touch the best white Italian millet. I sometimes gave
bunches of flowering or seeding grass, and often a split-open grape.
The parents were always difficult to find owing to their habit of
hiding in the bushes, where they always appeared to find food of some
sort. When the young had left the nest a week all four were learning to
feed with their parents, who always appeared greatly alarmed for their
safety. At night they saw them safely inside the shelter, where the
young roosted on the top of a square box-type wood nest; then they
would leave them for the bushes outside, where they slept. On leaving
the nest the young appear in a brownish garb with a little red on tail
and showing reddish tinge on the breast; also white marks each side
of the beak. At first they were very wild and nervous, but after a week
tamed down. Now they are about two months old and looking very
spick and span, brighter in colour and with white spots (on two birds
spots showed on the 4th June (? cocks)). I bred Peter's three to five
years ago. I cannot recollect the year and I have no note of it, beyond
sending a tiny specimen to our late Editor, Mr. D. Seth-Smith. Then
I had very bad luck, as the young I found scalped after leaving the
nest ; so, needless to say, this time I took the precaution of removing
every bird out of their division. I think I have said all except that I
am very pleased to have succeeded this time in the rearing of Peter's
Spotted Firefinches.
I might mention that the parents have again gone to nest, but
unfortunately this time out in the open, a nest on the ground under a
rose-bush and primrose clump. It is impossible to give it extra covering
owing to the branches that criss-cross above.

With imported birds my luck is not by any means good, except
as far as Weavers and Whydahs are concerned. Here are a few I will
mention :--
Zebra Finches, breeding birds, die often after two years.
Cordon Bleus, hens, breeding birds, die often after two years. Cocks
live longer.
Bengalese hens, breeding birds, die after about two years. Cocks live on.
Nutmeg Finch, cock, I have had 8J years and still going strong. Hen
died after two years.
As for Firefinches (common African), cocks after two years, and
hens, if alive when they arrive at the station, generally die at the second
year's breeding ; but two out of three are generally dead before I fetch
them from the station !

Scarlet Tanager, 8J years, magnificent ; Orange Bishop, 11J years, still
goes to shows and always wins a pretty good card, but owing to colour
feeding (which I think should not be permitted with foreign birds, and
I refuse to do it, hating tampering with Nature's--or should I say
God's--most perfect colouring) both Weavers and Pekin Bobins do
not stand a chance of high honours at any show. I should like to see
all judges refuse to look at man's hideous colour-fed bird. Enough said,
perhaps too much ! No, not too much !
Well, now to continue : Napoleon Weaver, 8J years, very lovely ;
Persian Bulbuls, all long lived ; White-winged and Crimson-collared
all seem pretty long lived ; Saffron Finch, including life in a previous
aviary, 8J to 9J years, living now ; Indigo Buntings do not live long
with me now, usually having fits at moulting ; Bainbow Buntings
are better, but mine at 4 years (lost one lately) looked very old, and
I rather longed for the lovely thing to " pass over " where I shall see
him in his youthful glory again.
Now I shall keep two of my young Peter's and probably exchange
two ; it will be interesting to see their length of life compared with
imported birds, which I have never kept any length of time. But,
mind you, I do think most breeding birds die through fights--they are
mostly killed because we will put too many birds in an aviary and we
(perhaps) do not study colour and temperament sufficiently--having
so frequently noticed birds of a reddish hue dislike any other birds
tending to that colouring at all. Of course, there may be exceptions ;
I speak only through sitting for many hours watching my own birds.
I trust this article will open out further correspondence.

Many of the remarks made by Mr. Porter in the June issue might
be applied to the importation of birds in general, and I quite agree
that the ban on the exportation of birds from many tropical countries
has suppressed a great amount of cruelty. It seems only a question of
time before nearly all countries adopt the same policy and then

aviculturists in England will find it difficult to obtain the varieties
of foreign birds they once knew and liked so well. There is increasing
agitation in this country for the introduction of legislation to prevent
the keeping of any foreign birds in captivity, and so it is quite time
that members of the Avicultural Society did something to safeguard
themselves before it is too late. It is a pity that the Avicultural Society
is not on the same footing as well-known zoological institutions, for
then the procuring of birds for its members from countries which have
protective laws would not be so difficult, but before this can happen
there will have to be many changes. At present very few people other
than members have ever heard of the Avicultural Society, and few
people (including some Government officials) even know the meaning
of it, and so perhaps for this reason the title might be altered with
advantage. It is also doubtful if many people know what the objects
of the Society really are. This being the case, how can the Society
claim exemption from any laws which apply to the general public ?
There are many influential individuals and societies interested in the
suppression of cruelty to birds in captivity. To most aviculturists these
people are popularly known as " cranks ". As things are at present
there is undoubtedly a great amount of cruelty involved in many cases
in the importation of birds, and it is difficult to see how the Avicultural
Society can reply effectively to the criticisms of the so-called " cranks
From a humane point of view there is much to be said in their favour
and it seems to me that our Society might make it generally known
that it is doing its utmost to do away with the keeping of birds under
improper conditions and, in fact, join forces with any other society
which has this object in view, instead of merely calling them nasty
names. The Avicultural Society might then become respected by all
parties and its members enjoy certain privileges. It is, of course, very
difficult to get all our members to see eye to eye, as their interests are
so varied, and many people are only concerned with their own particular
point of view, even if it happens to be detrimental to the interests of
members in general.
Some, although being fond of keeping birds, are extremely callous
and are not at all sensitive to birds' sufferings. Many will look over a
consignment of birds which has been imported on the " mass

production " principle, with most of the birds suffering in consequence,
.and then pick out the best specimens. These can usually be obtained
very cheaply owfing to the quantity packed into each cage and the fact
that the birds have been looked after by a member of the ship's crew
in his spare time. To purchase such birds, rather than pay a little more
for others which have been brought over under decent conditions, gives
some people intense joy--only to be compared with that of a woman at
a bargain sale, but these actions are merely making the " cranks "
more determined to entirely suppress the keeping of birds in captivity.
Then there are those who are only concerned with the show-bench.
A few of these are genuine aviculturists, but the majority exhibit for
financial gain only, or for the " kick " they get out of winning a prize.
Where many different species of foreign birds are placed together in one
class it must often be to a great extent a matter of personal opinion
which birds are deserving of the highest awards, though this does not
apply to the showing of domesticated species, where one has to keep
up to a recognized standard. The latter is a fine interesting hobby,
calling for much skill when mating up birds so as to eliminate faults.
In many cases those who show foreign birds do not even know from
which countries their birds originate, and their interests do not extend
beyond their desire to win prizes, therefore they can hardly be called
aviculturists. Showing also seems to breed a certain amount of ill-
feeling among exhibitors, for when a judge is also a dealer there are
usually nasty things said if one of his clients happens to gain a first
prize. I am not saying that these accusations are justified, but it can
hardly be called a pleasant business.
I imagine that the main objects of the Society are the studying of
the habits of foreign birds in captivity, their breeding and domestication,
and to those interested in the scientific side, the changes of plumage,
such as the eclipse plumage in certain Sunbirds, and members concerned
with these studies usually contribute interesting articles to the
Magazine to the benefit and delight of all those in search of knowledge.
Regarding the importation of birds in vast quantities, dealers who
have specialized in this have done a great amount of harm to the trade
in general, as well as to aviculture, on account of the disgusting way
in which the birds are usually imported. They have also been the direct

cause of laws prohibiting export being introduced into many countries,
partly because the authorities concerned are afraid of the local bird
life becoming unduly diminished or extinct, but mainly because of
complaints received from people who have witnessed the revolting
sight of hundreds of birds packed into small cages with numbers
dead and dying. Dealers who conduct their businesses on decent lines
can be encouraged and are more or less a necessity to aviculturists,
but the appearance of dealers' advertisements in the Avicultural
Magazine does not help matters where collecting abroad is concerned.
As already noted, many countries now only allow birds to be exported
to Zoological Institutions (thanks to " mass production " importers),
and so I have tried to impress upon officials abroad that members of
the Avicultural Society are just as worthy of consideration as any
zoological institution, having better opportunities for breeding birds
and for giving them personal attention. To give them an insight into
our activities and interests I have shown them copies of our Magazine,
but they have been little impressed because of the sight of dealers'
advertisements, for, owing to the activities of the type of dealer
previously referred to, they are wholly against any birds going to the
trade, and are naturally not in sympathy with any society which
publishes their announcements.
It might be helpful if the Magazine were enlarged and brought up
to the standard of other publications, and some effort made to increase
its circulation, as this would do a lot to raise the Society out of its
present state of obscurity. To attain this object abroad it would
probably help if complimentary copies were sent to zoological societies,
museum authorities, game wardens, etc., especially in our own Colonies.
I would be happier if someone else had brought up this matter, which
is rather of a controversial nature, but is one which may affect the whole
future of the Avicultural Society. Being a collector myself it may appear
to some people that this has been written from a purely personal stand-
point, but I think I have stated the facts. If readers will come forward
and make suggestions (rather than useless criticisms) which will be to the
ultimate benefit of the Society I shall be satisfied, even if in the mean-
time I have made myself unpopular with those who have guilty
consciences.

By Mrs. R. G-. Ashby
The thought that we are not supporting our new Editor is my
excuse for these notes.
Aviculture to the enthusiast is restricted by two important factors,
accommodation and purse. In my case (perhaps fortunately), both of
these exist. The former is, I fear, the more important. Overcrowding
spells failure, at least as far as breeding successes, all the time. Never-
theless, I continue to tempt providence year after year. Instead of
reducing my stock it is the reverse. Naturally providence exacts the
extreme penalty and I regret my achievements are practically nil.
My accommodation comprises the four sides of a smallish garden.
The four sides are aviaries, all 6 feet high and 6 feet broad. With the
exception of a " wilderness " aviary, all have cement floors. The flights
average about 18 feet each in length, with shelters, unheated, each
6 feet long. One flight is divided lengthwise. A bird house, electrically
heated, thermostatically controlled, and a conservatory complete my
establishment.
The bird house, the lighting being from the roof, has three rows of
shelves around the room. By means of wire fronts and slides I can
divide each shelf into seventeen cages about 18 inches long or any
number down to one, the latter cage being a flight of about 32 feet.
The conservatory has three racks of shelves, two of which can furnish
fifteen cages each and the other eight. This latter rack is of much
larger size, and cages can be 9 by 2 by 2 feet if desired. This size
accommodated my Toco Toucan and Touracou all last winter, and they
were in perfect condition.
The climate here is particularly mild, as we are at the seaside, and
there is an almost entire absence of smoke. My losses are now a
minimum and usually due to my own indiscretions. For example,
I have lost this season three Peter's Spotted Eirefinch cocks. I have
now discovered the cause. Pairs were placed in the " wilderness " aviary
with a pair of Melba Finches. I am now satisfied that these two species
cannot be associated as the cock Melba kills the cock Peter's. Ruficaudas
and Heck's are left alone. I wonder if any other member has had a

similar experience. However, I am digressing. The conservatory, as it is
practically all glass, is subject to extremes of temperature. In the
summer afternoons as high as 130 degrees is reached, but the birds do
well in it. In the winter it is heated by a patent gas fire. I found that
even 18 feet of a tubular electric heater could not keep the place warm.
With the exception of Budgerigars and Cockatiels all my birds are
wintered indoors, and it is the work of a morning to attend to them.
In the summer, when most are outside, my labours are considerably
reduced.
Now as to the inmates of the aviaries, etc. I am almost ashamed to
admit the contents of No. 1 (miscellaneous) aviary. Here overcrowding
is at its worst. Nevertheless, some pairs are nesting, but I am not at
all optimistic. Lavender Finches, Common Firefinches, Cordons,
Queen Whydahs, Chestnut-breasted Finches, Bichenos Finches,
Crested Bengalese, Masked and Long-tailed Grassfinches, Olive Finches,
Golden-breasted Waxbills, St. Helena and Grey Waxbills, and Sharp-
tailed Finches are the pairs. Two hen Peter's, a Black-cheeked Waxbill,
and two cock Pintailed Whydahs are the odd birds. I had also in this
aviary a pair of Green Cardinals, odd hen (?) Nonpareil Bunting,
Hawfinch, and several Weavers, but I have deposited these at our
public aviaries.
I may say that I have found Whydahs quite safe with other birds.
They are inclined to chase a little, but no harm has resulted.
A Toco Toucan occupies an aviary. Caged indoors he is a delightful
pet and very tame, but outside his welcome is almost vicious. A pair
of Purple-headed Glossy Starlings is in the next aviary. I find all
these larger insectivorous birds do very well on a mixture of Saval
No. 1, which is very cheap and only requires moistening. I am indebted
to our member, Mr. A. Wilson, of Glasgow, for this advice. He has used
it with several Birds of Paradise, and I find it superior to the ordinary
expensive mixtures, although I make my own soft foods.
Pairs of Cockatiels, Bed-headed Gouldians, White-throated,
St. Helenas, and Heck's Grassfinches are in the next aviary.
The Cockatiels have young and the Heck's and Gouldians are
incubating eggs.
The " wilderness " aviary contains Buficauda Finches and Heck's,

both incubating. Pairs of Peter's Spotted and Melba Finches were also
here, but they have now been removed.
The bird house contains the pick of my collection. Two Sunbirds,
an Abyssinian Splendid, and a Port Natal are in perfect health. The
former dotes on spiders and will take them out of my fingers. He has
finished a complete and severe moult, although he was never in eclipse
plumage. The Port Natal, at least that is my identification (I have
only Shelley and Jardine to work on), was in eclipse plumage and he
has been with me nearly a year. He is now changing rapidly. Until
recently I had a third, the Lesser Bifasciated, the gift of our Editor.
Unfortunately he died about a month ago. He was the wildest bird
I have ever kept and anyone who has kept a Golden Oriole will
appreciate what I mean.
Five Chinese Zosterops and a pair of Blue Sugar-birds are together
in a long flight. Zosterops are my favourites. They are so delightfully
inquisitive. They are fed on nectar (wrongly I have been told) and
fruit, but as I have had them for nearly a year and they are in perfect
condition I am sure the feeding suits them. They love rose-leaves
with green fly and I allow all my " ramblers " to bear good crops
of these.
Pairs of Long-tailed Grassfinches, pairs of the new Capped Waxbills
(both the Red-flanked and White-breasted), Melba Finches, two
delightful pairs of Dufresne's Waxbills, and an odd Cherry Finch,
Crimson Finch, and Scaly Crowned Weaver take up all the available
space.
The conservatory houses a Racket-tailed Drongo, in almost complete
plumage with beautiful tail rackets, and a Golden Oriole. Both have
large flights. Pairs of White Java Sparrows, Magpie Mannikins, Pekin
Robins, and a Grenadier Waxbill cock are all in cages. A Shama and
Golden-fronted Fruitsucker, both very tame, and a Blue-fronted
Amazon Parrot and a Blue and Yellow Macaw, both talkers and finger-
tame (as far as I am concerned, but curiously to no one else), complete
my little family. I am omitting Budgerigars, of which I have
about sixty.
I have on the way seven pairs of Australian Parrakeets, but my
" castles in the air " are Humming Birds and Birds of Paradise. Last

year I had a rare Livingstone's Tonracon and a Blue-tailed Pitta,
but both caught colds at exhibitions and I lost them.
My only real achievement this year is the reproduction of freak
Budgerigars. I have a Cobalt hen with a white head and cobalt instead
of white wing markings. By mating her son to her I have already three

this has been done before.

SOFTBILLS

<bodyText confidence="0.998662958333333" page_id="56222834"  page_num="208" year="" vol="">
By Mrs. B. 0. Ashby
The number of aviculturists who have never kept " Softbills " is
surprising. The mere mention of an insectivorous species seems to
frighten them. Although I have kept them for only a little over four
years, as long as I keep birds I shall have them. It is true they require
more attention than seed-eaters, but their tameness, even if all other
qualities are ignored, makes them most desirable. At present I have
about a dozen different species. The ease by which they may be kept
is clearly indicated in the case of my maid. She came to me some months
ago and had no knowledge of birds. I am able to go away most week-
ends and have already had ten days' holiday away from home. I do
not suggest that the birds receive quite the same attention as when I
am at home, nevertheless she manages them splendidly. In fact I feel
quite jealous at times for they seem to know her as well as they know
me. It is, therefore, with the object of persuading " hardbill "
enthusiasts to become " softbill " enthusiasts that these few hints are
written. They are solely the result of my own experiences.
There are, of course, some species which require much more attention
and experience than others. Nevertheless, many of the seemingly
" difficult " birds are, in fact, the easiest. My own " bete noir " is the
Festive Tanager. To emulate Mrs. Pearse in the breeding of them is
my ambition. Unfortunately I have never possessed other than newly
imported specimens.
With " softbills " the golden rule is cleanliness. Perches in

particular require unremitting attention. I have never tried covered
ones, as this seems to me to be the lazy way. " Softbills 55 suffer so
easily from sore feet. Use natural twig perches. In the cages of the
smaller varieties fix branches (practically miniature trees) on coils of
wire. These are easily made by coiling wire round a pencil. The main
branch is placed in the coil, which is fixed by a staple to the floor.
The coil acts as a spring and the branches&apos; " give 55 when used. The jar
on alighting on a fixed perch is undoubtedly harmful to any species.
This branch type of perch has the added advantage of offering different
sizes, thereby affording the necessary exercise for the feet.
All perches must be washed daily. The stickiness of those used by
fruit-eaters and nectar-feeders is astounding.
Place the single perches at different heights in the cage, always
avoiding them being directly above food or water dishes. Let them be
a fair distance apart, as this compels flight and the subsequent wing
exercise is essential for keeping the birds in tip-top condition.
Coarse sawdust is undoubtedly the best covering for the bottom of
the cage. I have experimented with moss litter and turfs of growing
grass, but the sawdust is admirable. Do not use the fine variety, as
there is the danger of it entering the eyes when blown about during
flight.
Water, preferably rain-water, must be supplied for drinking and
bathing. If a newly imported bird will bathe it will almost invariably
live. Regular spraying is a splendid incentive to bathing. For drinking,
the small fountains which clip to the wire are the best. They are then
unable to bathe in the drinking water. When fresh water is put in
a healthy bird will usually bathe at once.
The flower-pot pans made of clay make splendid dishes for the
bathing water. White dishes, apparently, do not give the birds any
idea of the depth and they are accordingly reluctant to use them. A
rough stone, placed in the pan and large enough to show just above
the water-level, gives confidence. The main objection to these pans is
that they are slightly porous and the damping of the sawdust around
them gives the impression that bathing has taken place, when this is
not the case. Change all water at least once daily, and thoroughly wash
all receptacles.

Mrs. R. G. Ashby--Softbills
Now as to food. Generally speaking the staple food of most
insectivorous birds, nectar-feeders excepted, is a soft food mixture.
There are many such preparations on the market and most contain
the same ingredients. I make my own, but this has the dis-
advantage that I have to supply many friends, who will use no other.
This mixture costs about half the price of most proprietary brands.
Moistening a soft food with either boiling water or grated carrot is all
right if one's personal attention is given all the time. It goes sour in
a day in hot weather. The mixture I recommend requires no moistening,
keeps for weeks in perfect condition, and is eaten to the last grain.
Surely the test for a sound food !
Tor those interested here is the recipe. To 7 lb. of " common "
soft food, obtainable at any of the larger dealers at about 9 d. a lb.,
add 1 lb. each of dried sifted flies, ants' eggs, and ground silkworm
sifted pupae. Try and obtain the latter whole and grind it yourself.
The mincing machine with the finest slide is admirable. To this add
3J lb. of finely ground biscuits. Your grocer will supply broken biscuits
as a discount on your account. Gingerbreads, shortbreads, sweet,
Osborne, etc., all go in. Mix, adding about 2 oz. of maw seed. When
thoroughly mixed add, a little at a time, 3 lb. of melted honey. Put the
jars with the lids off in a saucepan, with water, on the stove. Honey
will mix so much easier when hot. After using half a jar fill up with
Vitamin Malt and a little Virol. Mix this and the other 2 lb. into the
mixture. The result will be crumbly moist and although it sounds
messy one rinse under the tap and your hands are clean. You will
then have about 16 lb. of perfect soft food at a cost of well under Is. a lb.
Do not moisten when supplying and ration each bird. You will soon
find how much he takes and give the same amount daily. In the case
of the more delicate species double the amount of biscuit.
For the larger softbills this is too rich and too expensive ! Spider's
No. 1 Saval moistened with water is probably the cheapest of all the
soft foods and it is most satisfactory. It will not sour although it is
better given fresh daily. Tanagers enjoy this mixture and for the larger
birds such as Touracous, Toucans, Drongos, Starlings, even Birds of
Paradise, it is ideal.
Most insectivorous birds will take fruit and should be given it.

I do not believe in over-ripe specimens. As with bathing, if a fruit-
eater will take apple he will live. Throughout the year we have a liberal
supply of fruit and the apple all the time. Pears are excellent, banana
in moderation, as it is apt to constipate, whereas orange purges. A little&apos;
of each does no harm. The white water grapes are also popular. Try
and ring the- changes as much as possible. Remember that you have
deprived the bird of its liberty and it is your duty to give it the best
feeding and conditions possible. Dates are very good and some birds
will take figs. Cherries, strawberries, plums, pomegranate, etc., are
all cheap when in season. Green food such as lettuce and chickweed
is often appreciated. Just a hint as to the best method of giving fruit.
Make a fairly stiff piece of wire into a flat elongated " S ". One end will
hook on to the punchbar of the cage and the other transfix the fruit.
This has the advantage of keeping the fruit clean, gives ready access
to it, and the bird is not soiled on the neck and head.
For nectar-feeding birds, and these are probably the easiest to keep
in good health, a nectar food is essential. A thin mixture of water and
Mellin's Food, honey, and Nestle's condensed milk is ideal. As a change
give Horlick's Malted Milk in the place of Mellin's. A spot of Marmite
or other meat extract or Virol occasionally is advisable. I have never
tried white of egg in the nectar, but I am told it is good, particularly
during the moult.
Feed the nectar by means of the small fountains previously referred
to. In summer time it will be found that more nectar is consumed than
in the winter. It is advisable when renewing to make a weak mixture
of honey and water for the afternoon or evening, as this will avoid
over-fatness. Supply all the small live food obtainable. Greenfly,
spiders, and wasp grubs are live food taken by nearly all species.
Meal-worms, in moderation, and cockroaches appeal more to the larger
birds from Tanagers upwards. Incidentally, at the commencement of
the moult, put the meal-worms, etc., in olive oil before feeding with
them, and you will be surprised at the improvement in the sheen of
the plumage.
Finally a little tip on taming. Always give the live food from hand..
When the bird is used to taking it hold the food in such a manner that
the finger of the other hand must be surmounted before it can

In the June number of the Magazine Mr. Sydney Porter mentioned
an arrangement that I have found very successful in ridding aviaries
of mice. One has always known that the ordinary " Little Nipper "
mouse-trap is a useful invention, but it cannot be set in an aviary
without careful protection or it will catch the birds. It can be set
in an empty bird-cage or under a box and may do a certain amount
of execution ; but it occurred to me that the design of a box in which
to set these traps would prove the secret of their success. These little
traps as sold have a sharp spike on which one is supposed to place
the bait, and one has found that the mice soon fight shy of a baited
trap, and will not go near to it. It seemed necessary, therefore, to
.set the traps in such a way that the mouse would not realize that
a trap was there at all.
If you provide a dark box with a small opening, and place this on
the floor of the aviary, you will find that mice cannot resist exploring

its inside, and if you divide this box into several compartments,
separated by partitions, and in each partition cut a hole not more
than half an inch wide by about an inch high, mice will squeeze through
these openings very readily. And further, if you arrange a " Little
dipper " trap so that in passing through one of these openings the
mouse has to place its whole weight on the wooden pedal, you will
fin d that it will be caught every time.
I have made these boxes of various lengths to take more or fewer
traps, but the size I have found most handy is one to take four " Little
Nipper " traps.
It is formed of J- in. wood, the internal measurements being
13 inches long by inches wide, and the height 2J inches. It is
divided into three compartments, and the shape of the divisions is
important. They are made of zinc, and slip into saw-cut grooves at
either side. At each side of each of these divisions a piece is cut out,
allowing a doorway for the mouse, and these doorways are only half
an inch wide and about an inch high. It is necessary for the mouse to
have to squeeze through with some difficulty, and in doing so to exert
pressure upon the wooden pedal of the trap which is set against the
-opening. There are openings at each end of the box for the mice to
enter, and these are half an inch wide by one inch high, which is too
small an opening for any bird, though it will admit full-grown mice.
The box is, of course, fitted with a lid.
I always cut off the wire spike which is provided for bait, as this
is unnecessary. The traps are set close up against the partitions in
the corner against the openings, one in the first compartment against,
say, the left-hand opening, the next in the middle compartment
.against the opposite (right-hand) opening. The third, also in the
middle compartment, against the left-hand opening of the second
partition, and the fourth trap against the right-hand partition in the
third compartment. When the box, with its traps set, is placed in
position a pinch of canary seed can be sprinkled inside, but even
without any bait mice will be caught because they seem to be unable
to resist entering these boxes.

By Alfred Ezra, O.B.E.
I have had a pair of these attractive birds for several years in
one of my large aviaries with several other birds, and although they
have nested every year and hatched out young, these were never reared.
This spring they built a nest of straw, grass, leaves, twigs, and feathers,
in a nest-box that was hanging on the wall in the sleeping quarters
of the aviary about 9 feet from the floor. On 28th May four pale
blue eggs were seen, and by 7th June three young ones were hatched
out, the fourth egg being infertile.
During the incubation we noticed that the male bird was behaving
in a very strange way. He absolutely deserted his wife and paired
up with a hen Pied Grallina ( Grallina cyonoleuca). They were constantly
together and were even seen sitting together on a mud nest the Pied
Grallina had built. In the meantime the hen Starling looked after
her young, and fed them well on meal-worms, gentles, and sometimes
earthworms and caterpillars. Some of the latter were taken by the
hen from the Royal Starlings. Three young left the nest on 27th June,
and as I was afraid of them being attacked by their father, we removed
the hen with the young into a small aviary which they had all to
themselves. Here they were fully reared and are feeding themselves
without the aid of the mother. They are particularly robust birds-
and very strong on the wing. The successful rearing of these birds
I put down to the non-interference of the cock bird, who, being fully
occupied with the Grallina, had neglected the family. In so many cases
I have found the cock bird the real culprit, and when removed, young
have been reared successfully. I wonder what will happen when I put
the hen bird back in the same aviary as the cock bird, of course removing
the Pied Grallina first. I believe this is the first time this Starling
has been bred in captivity.
PS.--Since writing the above I have removed the Grallina from
the Starlings' aviary and have put the hen Starling in with the cock
bird. They are very good friends again and look like nesting almost
at once.

Precious and I went for a walk in St. James's Park the other day.
Precious, I must tell you, is a Cockatiel which I brought from North-
West Australia eight years ago, and he is a great character ; when he
feels in the mood for it he likes going out sitting on my shoulder with
a little lead on his foot. He is great friends with all the bus conductors,
who make a great fuss over him, and he seems to enjoy the noise and
racket of the traffic which sets him off whistling various tunes ; but,
to return to St. James's Park. I was talking to one of the park keepers
when I heard a whirr of wings passing my ear and an excited cry of
" Wirroo ! Wirroo ! " (the natives of North-West Australia call these
birds Wirroos) and I turned to see my bird, who had slipped his leash,
making a most beautiful flight, finally alighting on the top of a very
tall plane tree. Even in the dreadful moment of losing him I was
thrilled by the beauty of it. He sat on that tree for hours, making
occasional flights, and for hours I waited, hoping he would come down
to me. He always answered my call, but seemed quite happy where
he was. I sent home for another Cockatiel, which was brought to me
in a cage, but he was a stupid bird and refused to make a sound.
About 9 o'clock suddenly out of the blue came thousands of Starlings,
half of which settled on the plane tree where Precious was, the others
passing on. After that I heard no further sound and no answer to my
whistles. I stayed on till the park closed and then went sadly home,
fearing I had seen the last of a wonderful companion. I was back in
St. James's Park before 5 o'clock next morning, taking the other bird
with me in a cage. I walked round and round the park calling, but
got no response. In my wanderings I met Mr. Hinton, the bird keeper
of the park, who stopped and asked if I was the lady who had lost a
bird because, if so, he had seen it a short time before circling round by
the Guards Monument, and he very kindly took me to where he had
seen it. I whistled several times but at first got no response, then in
the distance a faint reply, and the next moment he was circling and
swooping down ; but he did not come down, and finally alighted on a
very tall tree. I located him and put the other bird under the tree.

not seem to know bow to get down. I waited about three hours,
Precious making occasional flights but always answering my call and
each time alighting a little lower in tbe tree till finally be got on to a
branch where be bad a clear view, and be kept peering down, chattering
"Be a good boy, babee " and then an emphatic 4 4 Don't do it ". I took
tbe other bird out of tbe cage and put him on my shoulder. Precious
never quite approves of that, and when I started to pet tbe other bird
it was too much for Master Jealousy in tbe tree and be promptly flew
down on to my bead, saying, " Good boy." Tbe rest was easy. I put
up my band and be came on to my finger and I put tbe other band
quietly over him and tbe next moment they were both safely in tbe
cage, Precious, I think, nearly as glad to be back as I was to have him.
He whistled bis tunes all tbe way back with great gusto, and I arrived
home a tired but very happy and triumphant woman. I was very
lucky getting him early before there were many people about to
scare him.
THE HISTORY OF A i
By Miss E. F. Chawner
A 1 is a small Amazon Parrot : bis Latin name, which no one ever
remembers to call him and which I believe be would contemptuously
repudiate, is Amazona xanthops. He and two even younger and barer
brethren came together in a box one chilly afternoon of that most chilly
and dismal summer, 1928, all very shivering and crying piteously.
Their poor little bodies were sparsely covered with fluff and their
immature wing feathers had been severely clipped, leaving a large
exposed patch of bare back. Their heads seemed unduly large, as they
were tolerably well feathered, and they kept nodding up and down
keeping time to the hoarse cries which greeted us when we unpacked
them. One was obviously not long for this cold world, the second
might live, and the third was sturdier and seemed promising.
I believe if I could have given them heat, by which I mean a steady

day and night temperature of 80 degrees at the lowest, they might all
have lived, but this I could not do and C 3 and B 2, as the weakling and
his rather sturdier brother were named, soon went to another and, I
hope, a better place. A 1 had made his mind up to live, though he
had his ups and downs. His favourite food at this stage was cold
boiled rice of all chilly things ! However, he ate this when he refused
everything else and grew on it.
After a month or so he found that his beak was strong enough to
crack sunflower seed and he lived on this and pea-nuts with a slice of
apple daily all through his first winter. More than once he nearly died
from a chill, during which he refused food and if he could be persuaded
to swallow some dainty soon vomited it, but somehow or other he
managed to survive and by spring his fluff was hidden under green
feathers, though the mutilated wings never really recovered. He
developed fancies and " ways " of his own, became devoted to his
owner, tyrannized over the household, and openly disdained the rest
of the world. He was never caged, though he had and still has his
" house " into which he retires when the world is too much with him
or when strangers are about. He hates visitors and goes grumblingly
inside, occasionally looking cautiously round the corner to see if they
are still there ; he celebrates their going with various queer sounds, for
he has never learnt to talk, which lack, however, does not prevent
him from making his wishes plain.
In hot weather he sits in his favourite apple tree most of the day
" pruning " its small branches and amusing himself by biting off
immature apples and watching them fall. He usually comes down
when called, but sometimes the gardener has to climb to fetch him.
We think on those occasions he has climbed too high and is afraid to
venture down. He eats young twigs with relish. His diet is curiously
varied : he loves to soak a piece of dry bread in his water mouthful by
mouthful, keeps watch on the vegetables when they come to table,
and expects a share of peas, beans, young carrots cooked or raw, cauli-
flower, and occasionally cabbage. He adores hot soup and has his
own little pot every evening. Cooked egg in all forms is a favourite,
Quaker oats raw or cooked ; most kinds of fruit are accepted, but he
will only take orange when he feels rather " low 55 moulting. Poppy

seed heads while still green and milky are a great joy, so is a fresh head
of sunflower, though he despises the dried seed. Brazil nuts are first
favourites at all times, walnuts if fresh and moist, and he always has
a dish of shelled pea-nuts by him. He is fond of milk, which he drinks
from a teaspoon and rarely spills, a lump of sugar dipped in very
weak tea is a rare delight, and thick cream spread on bread or toast,
but he is not a very large eater and, as one of his admirers says, he
never " eats for greed
Of course, he is mischievous like all his tribe. He loves to be taken
into the greenhouse where, if not closely watched, he nips off flowers
and bites the hearts out of bulbs, pulls up seedlings, and generally
wreaks havoc. His safety valve in winter is the wood basket, in which
he will " carpenter " all the afternoon quite happily.
We say " he ", but I have a strong suspicion that " she " is the
right pronoun. During April and May the bird evidently wants to
nest and goes through the antics of a bird which is desirous to pair.
In this case it begins with a crooning noise gradually intensified until
it becomes ear-splitting shrieks, while the bird lies flat on arm or
shoulder, and only leaves off when panting and exhausted. An attempt
was made to pair it with another kindly lent by the Zoological Society,
but the two would have nothing to say to each other, possibly they
were both of the same sex.
He, for I must call " him " so, is emphatically one person's bird.
His owner can do anything with him but he is frantically jealous of
anyone touching her while he is on her shoulder. He is civil to the
gardener and cook but bullies the parlourmaid, who is afraid of him
and he knows it. He condescends to sit in the kitchen when his
mistress is away but not for a moment after her return, which is
greeted with shouts of joy.

this is that the islands in their present state are of comparative recent

origin. They are formed of coral with only a few feet of top soil, hence
conditions have not been conducive to the evolution of any very
distinctive birds. Bermuda is in the migratory route of the North
American birds and its avifauna is, for the main part, only a
transitory one.
Six species of birds only are resident and the other two hundred
or more on the list of Bermudan birds are merely passing migrants
or strays blown out of their normal course. Even such birds as the
Corncrake and the Wheat ear have been recorded from the islands.
Bermuda is an amazing place and is composed of a great number
of small and very beautiful islands all lying so close together that they
are mostly joined together by bridges. The whole place is of great
beauty and is a fitting jewel in the crown of Empire, in fact there are
few more lovely spots in the possession of the Crown than this group
of fascinating islands. Though not by any means tropical, the climate
seems very equable, the thermometer seldom dropping below
60* E. in the winter, if indeed one can call the cool season by
that name.
The islands, before they were colonized, were covered mainly by
a dense growth of cedar trees and much of this still remains though
most of the larger timber has been cut out. Much exotic flora has been
introduced and the islands now blaze with a riot of gorgeous colour
of which magnificent oleanders and hibiscus are the main feature.
I was fortunate in seeing the six resident species of birds, all of which
are North American. A very great joy was vouchsafed to me in seeing
an old favourite for the first time in a state of freedom, namely the
Blue Bobin or, as it is known in America and also in the islands,
the Blue Bird.
What an amazingly beautiful creature he is : we think him
lovely enough in our aviaries at home, but he is a hundred times more
lovely in the wonderful sub-tropical beauty of Bermuda. The Blue
Birds are seen everywhere where there is rank vegetation, floating
with a remarkably light and buoyant flight usually from some tree to
the ground and back in search of insects. His upper parts seem to
reflect the cerulean tints of the Bermuda skies and the under parts
the brown and white of the Bermudan soil.

The Blue Bird takes the same place in these islands and also
in America as the Bobin does with us at home. When one sees him
in his native state it is easy to see that he belies his English
nomenclature and bears no affinity to the true Robins : in fact it seems
the practice of most people to call any type of small confiding bird a
Robin, especially if it possesses a red or chestnut breast. I have seen
the Blue Birds busy on the freshly ploughed fields searching amongst
the newly ploughed turf for insects : in this the bird rather resembles
a Robin but its general demeanour and flight resemble that of a Fly-
catcher.
In Bermuda the bird is resident and does not migrate. It has
been classified as a distinct species and called Sialia sialis bermudensis,
but the difference between this and the American bird is very
slight.
It will ever be a charming combination of memory to associate
my visit to the sylvan isles of Bermuda with my first acquaintanceship
with that glory of American avifauna, the Blue Bird.
Another surprise awaited me in making my first introduction to
another prime favourite of British aviculturists, namely the Virginian
Cardinal. How gorgeous this fiery scarlet bird looks amid the sombre
greenery of the cedar trees. After the introduced sparrow this is
perhaps the most conspicuous if not the commonest of the native birds.
The glowing plumage of this bird is fittingly matched in the scarlet
of the hibiscus and a hundred and one other tropical blossoms which
grow so profusely in these glamorous isles.
I have often watched these birds searching for insects in the crevices
in the bark of the cedar trees and also, like the Blue Bird, looking for
insects in the newly turned earth in the gardens and fields. The birds
are very tame and allow a very close approach. What an asset this
bird would be to the English countryside if it could be established, but
I am afraid that it would be unable to withstand the onslaught of
game-keepers' guns or village boys' catapults.
This Cardinal has also been separated from the mainland species
but only by scientists whose hobby it is to find microscopic differences
between different sub-species of birds.
In a wild state this bird lives far more on insects than on seeds and

I think many people in England make a great mistake in keeping it
solely on dry seed instead of treating it more like an insectivorous bird.
The first endemic land bird which came under my notice was the
North American Catbird ( Dumetella carolinensis), which was observed
in the small cedar trees on some of the tiny islands in the Great Sound,
as we crossed from the naval dockyard on Ireland Island to Hamilton.
In flight and general demeanour this bird resembles, from a distance,
a small Blackbird, except that it is far more arboreal than that bird.
It is only on close aquaintanceship with the bird that one sees the true
colours, which are a dark smoky grey with a black cap and bright
chestnut under-tail coverts which seem always to be conspicuously
displayed.
The Catbird, though quite common, does not appear as common as
the Cardinal though, of course, it does not catch the eye like the flaming
garb of the other bird. This bird has a fine loud song which may
usually be heard in the evenings. It has been separated from the
American species, from which, if it does differ, it appears to be slightly
darker.
Another indigenous bird is the little Bermuda White-eyed Vireo
(Vireo griseus bermudianus) , a local representative of a well-known
family of North American birds. This delightful little warbler-like
bird resembles very much both in appearance and in colouring and
size a Zosterops. It has the same restless demeanour in its ceaseless
search for the minute insects upon which it feeds. During the short
time I was in Bermuda in June of this year I saw many birds feeding
their young ones, so the breeding season in these islands must corre-
spond with that at home. This charming little bird is very common
and is found in all the gardens and plantations on the islands where
there is thick vegetation.
Another very distinctive member of the avifauna is the tiny
Bermuda Ground Dove ( Columbigallina passerina bermudiana). As
one drives along the dusty roads in the comfortable horse-drawn
" Victorias ", for no motors are allowed to disturb the peace of these
islands, one continually surprises pairs of these diminutive doves.
They are usually searching for tiny seeds on the bare ground, but as
soon as they see the approach of a stranger they break into a quick

trot and as one gets nearer they scurry out of the way with a peculiar
undulating flight. It is then that one sees the bright chestnut flights
which are ordinarily hidden from view. An aviculturist whom I met
on the islands told me that owing to the abundance of cats these
delightful little birds are being greatly reduced in numbers. These
Doves, in common with all the other birds on the islands, are protected
but I think something should be done to reduce the number of cats
which prey on the native birds.
This little Dove is the only endemic bird which can be classed as a
true species as it differs from the other Ground Doves in being much
duller in colour and lacking the scallop-like markings which the nearly
related Ground Doves of the West Indies possess. This bird is double
brooded like most of the Bermudan birds and builds a very slight nest
at a moderate height in the cedar trees.
In keeping with most of the West Indian islands, Bermuda possessed,
before the advent of Man to its shores, a peculiar Petrel which appears
to have nested in great numbers in holes burrowed in the shallow soil
on most of the islands. In common with the " Diablo tin " ( Pterodroma
hasitata) of Dominica, Martinique, and Guadaloupe, this bird was
slaughtered in huge numbers for human consumption and like the
former bird soon became apparently extinct. This bird was known on
the islands as the " Cahow " from its cry. Several early writers on
the history of Bermuda mention it and give fairly accurate descriptions
of it. Many years ago a Mr. Mowbray, whom I had the pleasure of
meeting, discovered at a depth of about 20 feet below the surface some
semi-fossilized skeletons of two of these birds, obviously adult and
young, possibly a bird which was sheltering its almost adult young when
there was a fall of the soft coral sand in its nesting-hole which buried
both birds. I saw both these skeletons at Mr. Mowbray's house. The
same gentleman had the distinction of discovering an adult bird of
this supposedly extinct race : he found the bird sheltering under a
crevice in the rocks after a storm of exceptional severity. This bird

The first birds seen as we approached Bermuda were the Yellow-

numbers of these birds flying round the coral rocks, where they were

nesting. They look very beautiful with their glistening snow-white
plumage and long streaming tail feathers. These birds bear no
resemblance to gulls but look like small Gannets, birds to which they
are allied. Their prey is secured in the same manner as a Gannet,
by diving into the water from a good height above the surface.
The feet of Tropic Birds are so tiny that the birds are practically
unable to move about on land. They nest in the crevices and holes in
the soft coral rock around the coast and I was told that they were
almost exterminating the Audubon's Shearwater (Puffinus Iherminieri),
who use the same nesting holes, the Tropic Birds now arriving before
the Shearwaters have finished breeding and killing the nesting adults
and young birds.
The fore-mentioned birds with, of course, the exception of the
" Cahow ", were the only birds I saw as my call did not coincide with
the spring or autumn migrations of birds which use these islands as
a kind of half-way rest house. A sojourn during either of the migratory
periods would be of great interest for it seems that at some time or
another a large percentage of North American birds have been met
with on the islands and, as mentioned before, many European birds
have been also procured such as the Snipe, Skylark, Wheat ear, etc.
Mr. Mowbray possessed an immature Snowy Owl caught on the islands,
probably a young, inexperienced bird which had been blown out of
its course.
The English Sparrow is exceedingly abundant and is found every-
where : it will even fly on to the ships before they have come into port
to see what there may be in the way of food. He looks a very different
bird in his spruce clean plumage to his grimy relations in London.
It is stated that this bird has become so numerous that there is a
grave danger of it displacing the endemic birds.
The European Goldfinch is also found in flocks in Bermuda, but
is nowhere as common as the Sparrow.
In the grounds of the Bermuda Aquarium is one of the most
delightful outdoor aviaries I have ever seen. It is a large and well-
built structure ; the span roof, which is of wire netting, was covered with
alternate board about 6 inches apart to give the birds shade from the
semi-tropical sun. Most of the floor space was taken up with a series

of freshwater pools containing many varieties of tropical plants, the
most noticeable being the beantifnl bine water lily. These pools were
inhabited by various species of fish and terrapins. This would be an
ideal place for tropical waders. As the aviary had only recently been
completed it had few inhabitants, also it is very difficult to get imported
birds in Bermuda. This fine aviary had been built by Mr. Mowbray
and his son, and these gentlemen also owned several other interesting
birds, including several Macaws which were at liberty in the grounds
and in perfect condition and also a female Cocos Island Tropic Bird
which they had kept for two years and which was in very good condition.
A great feat surely to keep such a difficult bird for so long a time.
Although full-winged the bird made no attempt to get away.

Although in our Magazine it should be entirely unnecessary to say
so, it is perhaps best, at the outset, to affirm the veracity of what
follows.
In the autumn of 1923 or 1924 (wireless enthusiasts with a love of
jazz will be able to date it correctly from later evidence) I purchased
a pair of birds which were new to me, and turned out to be Brown-
headed Marsh Troupials ; and, about the same time, a pair of Green
Cardinals.
The Troupial may be described as a small seed-eating Starling, said
to come from Eastern Brazil and other parts of South America ; the
male is glossy blue black with a bright chestnut crown and throat,
a rather pleasing bird, and the female, which is slightly smaller, a
neat but quietly coloured brown bird ; they have rather long, sharply
pointed, wedge-shaped beaks.
These four birds were kept together for the winter in a large 5 ft.

cage in the bird room and were apparently peaceably disposed
towards each other, and all, although newly imported, were practically
in perfect feather.
When we had had them for a few weeks we used to notice that the
male Cardinal was usually standing on the floor of the cage when we
entered the room ; we did not know why, but merely noticed that it
was so. It occurred to us that he might be a bit " hen-pecked ",
though he did not appear to be so, indeed they all seemed the best of
friends. To test this we put the sliding division in the cage, separating
one or other birds from the rest, but there was little difference : the cock
Cardinal though not so constantly on the floor often was so, but flew
up on our entry. We concluded that he might be a bit nervous of the
smaller but mainly black cock Troupial, though he never showed any
signs of it, so we took the sliding division out and thought no more
of it.
Early in the New Year the cock Troupial was one day found dead
on the floor of his cage, with a hole in his skull just to one side of the
occiput. As there were no feathers about or signs that any of the birds
had been fighting we thought that possibly a mouse had got into the
oage and done the damage, so had a mouse offensive and caught two.
About March, the remaining three birds were transferred to the
fairly large shelter of an outside aviary, where they could get plenty of
exercise preparatory to being let out into a large flight for the summer ;
with them in the shelter were several Orange and Half-masked Weavers,
a Giant and two Paradise Whydahs, a Grey Cardinal, three Queen
Whydah cocks and two hens, and a--then rare--Mexican Blue Gros-
beak. These had all lived peacefully and happily together throughout
the winter when the three birds were added from the bird room--and
still all appeared to be peace.
In April we found an Orange Weaver dead beside the food pot with
a hole in his occiput. We had had him some years--had he died a
natural death and a mouse done the damage after death ? We did
not know, but thought not. Anyway we wanted to breed the Green
Cardinals, so now transferred them to a place by themselves, and let
the Weavers, Whydahs, Troupial, etc., out into the flight and placed
a small dish of millet in a corner of the aviary, which was a convenient

place to watch as the birds came down to feed when we were seated
outside the aviary.
Shortly after this, on each of three successive mornings we found
a Queen Whydah dead beside the dish of millet in the open, each time
with the occipital skull opening and no other damage.
By the process of exclusion it was now pretty evident that if a
bird was the murderer it could only be the hen Troupial, and as we
could not get a mate for her and in any case did not wish to retain
such a doubtful character, we got her into the shelter by herself, opened
the door, and gave her her freedom.
A dish of millet and some water were placed on the lawn just outside
the aviary: she spent a good deal of that day trying to get back into
the aviary, but found the food we had provided for her.
The next morning a dead Sparrow was found beside the food pot
on the lawn with the usual skull perforation, and this happened on
two subsequent occasions during the next fortnight, but after three
weeks of freedom we saw her no more. Her victims throughout were
males.
We never saw her aggressive towards anyone, and other birds
would freely perch and sit adjacent to her and show no fear. I presume,
of course, that she was an exceptional bird, but I have not kept the
species since. She came from South America, the land of Savannahs,
and during that winter, in those days when we used ear-phones and
crystal sets to listen in, one was nauseated with the constant repetition
of a song about " Hard-hearted Hannah, the vamp of Savannah "--
which ultimately gave the Troupial her not inappropriate name.
Why did she do it ? Was she a murderous misanthrope ? Her
beak, anyway, was the ideal weapon for making such wounds as she
inflicted, and from the positions of her victims in the aviary and at
freedom she must have been quick, certainly she was very neat.
Concerning this bird the late Dr. A. G. Butler wrote in Part II of
Foreign Bird Keeping : "I shall never purchase another "--and I
agree with him.

The breeding season of 1935 has so far produced only very moderate
results, largely, it would appear, owing to the spell of arctic weather
in mid-May which put many birds back badly.
Yellow-mantled Rosellas have reared four young and the hen is
sitting again. Last year they reared six in their first brood and the hen
laid again but did not sit.
Mealy Rosellas have reared two young and the hen is sitting again.
Last year they reared four and did not nest a second time. A young
hen bred in 1934 has not laid.
One pair of Pennant's have six young in the nest and the other
pair have eggs.
The Yellow-bellies that reared four young last year are sitting.
Their offspring of the previous season have not bred.
The White Roseate Cockatoo paired to a light grey hen have young
in the nest.
The albino pair laid five eggs which they broke after a month,
but they seem to have been infertile.
The Leadbeater's appeared interested in their nest but were so
put off by the cold weather in May that they fell into moult and have
done nothing.
Banksian Cockatoos seem about to lay but the eggs are always
infertile and I have given up all hopes with them until I have changed
the cock.
A Worcester's Hanging Parrot, paired to a Sclater's, also always
has infertile eggs. For some years she laid and incubated in a nest-
box, but the last two seasons seems to have decided that she might
have better luck if she conducted operations on the sand-tray in the
aviary shelter !
My old pair of Crimson-wings hatched two young but they were
killed in the nest by black ants. These insects, in spite of their small
size, are little brutes when they can get hold of any defenceless creature.
On another occasion they decimated some young green tree frogs-
I had bred, when they were hibernating in a cage in the greenhouse.

The hen Crimson-wing laid one egg of a second clutch and then fell
into moult.
The second pair of Crimson-wings reared only one young one in
their first nest, as against three last year, but the hen is sitting again,
an unusual event with this single-brooded species.
The Common King's six eggs proved infertile. I lost my breeding
cock last winter by an accident and his successor seems to be of no use.
My old Sula Island King died of egg-laying trouble, though not of
ordinary egg-binding. I had had her about 20 years, but she showed
no sign of age. She produced, some years ago, several handsome but
infertile hybrids with a Crimson-wing.
The Rock Peplars were a failure. I had changed my breeding cock
for another of a better colour and he kept on getting ill just when the
hen should have been laying and she deserted her nest-box where she
had reared young for two seasons and went back to her old silly habit
of laying her eggs in the aviary shelter.
The two pairs of Barrabands have gone to nest and one pair have
young.
Stanley's did not nest. The hen was a 1934 bird bred at Keston.
Owing to much trouble with egg-binding and consequent complete
absence of results in 1934, I decided not to give my two young hen
lutino Ringnecks and two pairs of Malabars their nests until 15th May.
The experiment was not very successful, as one Ringneck and the
Malabars dropped into moult and did not nest at all. The other Ringneck
started laying from the perch about 7th May, and now has two lutino-
bred green young in the nest. Her mate is an ordinary wild bird. A
lutinistic hen Plumhead, paired to her three-year-old son (?), had
infertile eggs, but the son may be a daughter ! His actions when a
year old were those of an undoubted male but he has never come into
colour and his tail is short. Another lutinistic pair dropped their eggs
from the perch and broke them.
Two pairs of Bayard's are nesting, as also may be a third hen mated
to a Plumhead.
For many years I have had bad luck with Derbyans as I have only
had one cock that would consent to live and, as he was very wing-stiff
from long caging, I sent him to the Zoo as an exchange for a free-flying

bird that promptly died on me ! My old bird added to my regret at
parting with him by the touching way in which he never fails to recognize
me and give me an enthusiastic welcome if I visit the Parrot House.
This spring, however, I succeeded in getting a very fine cock bred in
America by Dr. Wood, of Pasadena, and at last there are young in the
nest.
A Plumhead mated to a rather aged cock Slaty-head hatched
one young hybrid which disappeared.
Two pairs of Adelaides are nesting but I do not know with what
result. My lovely lutino hen, alas ! died in the winter.
The Queen of Bavaria Conures should be nesting by now, but I
fear are not doing their duty. The cock is a tiresome creature. After
doing well with me when he first came over, he became demoralized
by wrong feeding when sent to France and now plucks himself to a
scarecrow and does damage to his wife's plumage as well, entirely failing
to respond to every infallible up-to-date cure for feather-plucking on
the market ! Last year he disgraced himself by murdering his off-
spring in the nest.
Grey Parrots and Swift Parrakeets show some signs of breeding
but I am not too hopeful of either.
The one great hope (which naturally will not be realized) is the
Racket-tailed Parrots, which are laying. I got a second pair of this
beautiful but tricky species last autumn but the hen died soon after
arrival and the cock in the spring. A third young pair imported this
summer are now in an aviary. They seem to do best in movable aviaries
with heated shelters.

FERTILITY OF THE HOODED SISKIN AND

Although the word Canary is taboo in these pages, the following
notes on the crossing of this bird with the Hooded Siskin should be of
interest to many bird lovers. When healthy, the Hooded Siskin is
a beautiful little fellow and a good singer to boot, but except in certain

230 Dr. Maurice Amsler--The Hooded Siskin and Canary Hybrid
individuals of inherent hardiness they are difficult to acclimatize for
the first year or so.
As is well known, a certain faction of the Canary fancy is aiming
at a Red Canary, and to this end have introduced the red factor by
means of the male Hooded Siskin.
I believe that the Canary they use when obtainable is the recessive
White, which is only in the hands of one or two breeders up to the
present. The bulk, if not the whole of the White Canaries on the
market, is of the dominant type--that is birds which if mated to normal
Canaries produce White offspring, recessive under the same conditions
produce normally coloured young.
These details did not interest me greatly, but what did give me
food for thought was the discovery that some of these hybrids were
fertile. As is well known, hybrids between the Canary and other
Finches such as the Linnet, Goldfinch, etc., are sterile, although out of
the thousands bred in the past one or twm have been stated to be
fertile.
The Hooded Siskin, as I have already said, is a delicate bird, and
the number of successful nestings in this country, at any rate, have
been very few. Although frequently imported for many years it
was first bred by me here in 1912.
For the non-initiated it may be explained that the first cross, say
between a Canary and Siskin, is called F 1, the next cross either way
F 2, and so on.
I argued that if I could get some fertile F 1 hybrids I might get
some F 2 the next year, using the male Siskin each year--and F 3 the
following year--thus I might evolve, if I lived long enough, an almost
pure strain of Hooded Siskins which might be much hardier and better
breeders than the true species.
With this end in view I mated two cock Siskins with four border
hens last year and two of the latter were Whites and two were Yellows.
One of the hens did no good, but from the other three I obtained ten
hybrids, four cocks and six hens.
This may sound good going, but a fancier abroad in 1933 bred,
I believe, over forty young from one Siskin and a number of hen
Canaries.

Dr. Maurice Amsler--The Hooded Siskin and Canary Hybrid 231
Of these young only one showed the red Siskin parentage in his
nestling plumage--he turned out to be a cock--the mother being a
White. There appears to be two types of F 1 hybrids--the copper-
coloured bird with a black cap and the grey or ashy birds, in which
the cocks again have a black or dark head: the former are of course
much the handsomer.
As my idea was to get F 2 hybrids by using the male Siskin again,
I parted with two of my cocks and obtained females in exchange.
This, as I have found out since, was a very foolish move, for F 1 hens
are always sterile, F 2 usually so, but when one gets to F 3 the chance
of a fertile hen is a good deal greater.
This information was borne out in seven aviaries when I tested the
F 1 hens with one or two cock Canaries--before trying them in cages
with cock Siskins. I did not get a single fertile egg.
Now let us turn to the cock hybrids. There were four--one, whose
colour I forget, went to Mr. Allen Silver and I heard about a month
ago that he had an F 2 hybrid " on the sticks 55 from a mating of
this bird with a border hen Canary. I hope that by now he has had
further successes. A second bird I gave to a woman bird lover who
had been kind to me, who mated him to a hen Lancashire Canary.
Even with this disparity in size she obtained a chick in the first
nest, which lived to 11 days and which she thinks would have
been reared had she not at the ninth day removed the cock who
was a bit too fussy, upon which the hen threw up the sponge. This
same hen has now a clutch of fertile eggs from which much is
expected.
A very fine dark copper cock I lent to a Canary and hybrid breeder
who put him up with a White border of my own breeding. Two clutches
were clear and the bird was returned to me and turned out into an
aviary with some hen Canaries and several F 1 hens.
About a fortnight ago I found a Buff border hen on two eggs, one
of which was fertile. This egg was put under a hen Canary sitting in
a cage, and the chick, a very dark coloured bird, is now a week old.
The father of this chick is either the above-mentioned copper bird
or else a plain ashy-grey cock who inhabits the same aviary.
These rough experiments have gone to prove that in my strain,

A. Sherrijf--In a Hampstead Garden
at least, three out of four cocks are fertile, i.e. 75 per cent. Possibly
in better hands the proportion would have been 100 per cent.
The same border hen is sitting again ; if any of her eggs are fertile
she will be allowed to rear the young herself, as it is getting late for
foster-mothers in cages. I fear my chances of rearing any young from
this nest are meagre as I seldom manage to rear Canaries in aviaries,
though they are easy enough, but more trouble in cages.
With any luck I may have two or three F 2 hybrids next year.
Cocks I should mate with Canary hens, and hens, if they prove
fertile to a Canary, I shall try with Hooded Siskin cocks. Apart from
the amusement derived from these experiments which, by the way,
might be carried out on highly scientific lines by anyone who had time,
the results are quite pleasing, for the first cross male hybrid is a
perfectly delightful and constant singer, to my mind far in advance
of either parent. Should any other member be working on the same
lines I should be very glad to hear from him, as a change of blood may
be useful or necessary in the latter stages of these crossings.

Successes in rearing birds have not been frequent here for a year
or two. This season so many birds wish to nest that there was not
sufficient space to afford them all the necessary facilities.
There are two large breeding aviaries and a winter aviary which
comprises six small flights, each with an inner flight. Behind these are
two larger bird-rooms and the whole is heated by water pipes. The
aviaries are by no means ideal, but it is very doubtful if anyone has
found the perfect aviary. Improvements that could be made are
numerous but expense has to be considered, and if birds are happy and
live well we have to be content.
The difficulty of finding suitable food for nesting insectivorous
birds has encouraged us previously to give them liberty when breeding.
This is not nearly as difficult as it sounds but there are many risks.

The birds may not stay, one may die, and in those circumstances the
other will probably disappear. If young are reared, they may decide
that they are not happy with the environment and decide to seek happier
hunting-grounds. Worst of all, a marauding cat may leave the young
in the nest to die. If it were only law that cats, like dogs, should be
kept under control and not allowed to create havoc amongst young
birds or to cause sleepless nights by their caterwaulings, aviculture in
this neighbourhood would be easier. Eight young Painted Quails
died a sudden death owing to their ability to squeeze through half-
inch wire netting, on account of one of these animals.
The first attempt to nest this year was made by two out of three
Black-headed Sibias which were bred in 1930. The pair had been put
out into the largest breeding aviary in early May, and survived quite
happily the severe frost of that month. It is really amazing how hardy
they are. In early June they had hatched two young, one of which
presumably died after seven days and was carried away by the parents,
for no trace of it was discovered. As soon as the young were hatched,
a hole about 12 inches square was cut in the wire of the aviary at the
top and a perch which projected " in and out " was affixed by a nail.
It took only a few minutes for the cock to find his way out and ever
since then they have been at liberty. The one youngster is now almost
indistinguishable from the parents and spends all day at liberty, but
generally returns to the aviary to roost. Probably we shall catch him
up soon, but in any case it is doubtful if he would leave unless the
parents drive him away. This is a point to be considered, for we believe
that the old birds have another nest, though it is very difficult to
obtain definite confirmation. The hen must have had a very narrow
escape from death as she is now minus a tail; no doubt a cat again.
It is surprising for a Sibia to be so caught for they are extraordinarily
quick in every way.
About the same time that the Sibias had hatched, the pair of
Shamas had built a nest and were busy incubating three eggs, from
which two young duly emerged. For the first time we tried giving them
their liberty but another cock Shama in an adjoining aviary was the
cause of so much diversion that we had to shut them up again. This
was accomplished without any difficulty. Why the young died after

A. SherrijJ--In a Hampstead Garden
a week we are still at a loss to understand. However, another nest was
started and two eggs hatched. We decided to give the parents their
liberty for the second clutch. Everything seemed well, but apparently
they were too happy with their new found liberty to worry sufficiently
about the fledgelings. So another disappointment ! Now the parent
birds have been left free in the garden and most strangely the hen has
built a nest in a flower-pot in the Sibias' aviary (which is, of course,
open) and is now busy sitting on three eggs. Dare we hope for a real
success this time ? The eggs should be hatched any day now.
It is better for the birds to find their natural food for the young,
than that they should be fed on meal-worms, which are a poor, though
a necessary, substitute. They are delightful to have about the garden
and tame enough to take meal-worms from the fingers. We are wonder-
ing whether there will be any trouble when and if the Shamas begin to
feed their young as the three Sibias are in and out of the aviary all
day long. The latter are carrying meal-worms to a copper-beech tree
about two hundred yards away so it seems obvious that they have
young.
A pair of Ruficaudas and a pair of Bicheno Finches were given one
of the large bird-rooms with an outdoor flight for breeding purposes,
but nothing happened, though the Ruficaudas made some attempt
to build a nest. We came to the conclusion that the Bicheno Finches
were worrying them, particularly as the cock Ruficauda was very
inclined to be spiteful towards the Bicheno Finches. As soon as the
latter were moved into an aviary on their own, the Ruficaudas built
a nest and laid two eggs, but the nest was so badly built, in fact it was
difficult to find any entrance at all, that the hen could not sit. We
pulled this nest out of the tree and they then built a proper one,
incubated, and hatched two out of three eggs. One of the young is in
excellent condition, but the second does not seem to have grown its
feathers properly yet and has some difficulty in flying.
At the same time the Bicheno Finches reared three young, all of
which are doing well. We have never tried giving these small Finches
their liberty, though on occasions, when the door has been left open
accidentally, there have been as many as twenty Waxbills loose in the
garden and we have found no difficulty in catching them up again.

There seems no reason why they should not have the same homing
instincts as their larger brothers.
Probably the Sibias will be left out during the winter ; the young,
of course, will be caught up. We did this successfully before, and as
they are so hardy no ill came of it. They invariably roosted in the
aviary.
A pair of East African Manikins (we are not sure which species)
built a nest in a privet hedge. Unfortunately the hen died suddenly
before any eggs were laid and the post-mortem examination showed
the oviduct full of eggs but certified the cause of death as anaemia.
A pair of the larger White-cheeked Bulbuls made some attempt to
build but have now given up all ideas of breeding. The Black-chinned
Yuhinas have now an aviary to themselves, but it is probably too late
to hope for success this year. The one young one hatched last year had
to be destroyed after three weeks, as the brain was damaged. With
reference to other birds, two Backet-tailed Drongos are in marvellous
condition. They are great friends, though as there is no outward sex
difference it is impossible to tell whether they are a pair. The most
perfect mimics, they welcome anyone to the aviary with the most
astonishing noises, anything from the " meow " of a cat to the song
of the Blackbird. Not long ago, the gardener took the trouble to get
a ladder to investigate the pitiful cries of a puppy which had fallen
in between the aviary and a wall. Needless to say, it was only Drongo !
They make the most charming aviary birds and are quite safe,
even with birds as small as the Yuhinas. They do well on the ordinary
insectivorous mixture, but anything from a small mouse to a grape is
appreciated. Heat is necessary in the winter and at that time of the
year a little chopped raw meat is good for them. Meal-worms are caught
in the most amazing manner and should be given in moderation.
We hope to record the successful breeding of Shamas at liberty
in the next Magazine.

<bodyText confidence="0.961130454545454" page_id="56222862"  page_num="236" year="" vol="">
This charming little book will be read with great interest by members
of the Avicultural Society because it deals with many of the birds with
which they are familiar. Mr. Martin Duncan is both a naturalist and an
artist and so has been able not only to produce a book containing a large
amount of information but has illustrated it with a series of very
charming coloured pictures, though some of these are perhaps rather
more artistic than strictly accurate as to detail. Twenty-two groups of
birds, from the Birds of Paradise to the Cassowaries, are dealt with.

This is one more added to the excellent series of county histories
of the birds of the British Isles that have been published in recent years
by Messrs. Witherby, and is thoroughly up to the standard of those
that have gone before. It deals with one of the best known districts of
Scotland, and represents many years of careful observation by an
author whose death prevented his seeing the fulfilment of his work
which was completed shortly before he died. But it will remain a
worthy memorial to his memory. It contains an excellent map and some
fine photographic plates.

I am quite overcome at the kindness and generosity of the members in
presenting me with such a splendid testimonial--a delightful old Chippendale
bureau and a picture by my old friend George Lodge. I feel that I have done
little to deserve this magnificent present, for it has always been a great
pleasure to edit the Magazine and the members have helped so willingly.
I intended to write personally to each one of the subscribers but find that
this is quite an impossibility just now as there are so many of them and my
time is so very fully occupied.
I want to thank you and Mr. Sherriff especially for all the trouble you have
taken over this testimonial and I. shall be greatly obliged if you will convey
my very sincere thanks to the other members of the Society.

I thought perhaps you would like to know that I have about half a dozen
more Peter's Spotted out from a second nest. It is difficult yet to count
as they are so very nervous. The four from the first nest--three cocks and
one hen--are magnificent, even look better than the parents. Also I have
three Yellow-winged Sugar-birds from the second nest (after laying three
clear eggs after the first nest young were reared).

THE ORNAMENTAL PHEASANT SOCIETY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996437911764706" page_id="56222863"  page_num="237" year="" vol="">
After an exceedingly enthusiastic inaugural meeting, an Ornamental
Pheasant Society has now been formed. Cage Birds is to be our official organ,
and through this paper the Society will publish its weekly notes. Already
it has given us a generous send-off and a special notice of the meeting, which
was held at Mr. G. Elay's house at Surbiton, where our host and hostess
entertained all those present most lavishly. Few members of the Avicultural
Society can be aware of the magnificent collection of birds that Mr. Elay has
procured and our host kindly allowed us to see round his extensive grounds.
In due course the names of the officials of the Society will be published
in Cage Birds and no doubt a summary of the rules and objects of the
Society.
This is an opportunity to appeal to all members of the Avicultural Society
to join this newly formed society. One of the main features will be to popularize
the keeping of Pheasants and to encourage more aviculturists to collect and
breed these most desirable and colourful birds. That is in fact our main
object, and in no way will the Society be used for the benefit of individuals
wishing to join for gaining their own ends. To carry out our projects we
intend approaching all the prominent show committees with a view to obtain-
ing a class for ornamental Pheasants. It is also possible that the Society will
take a stand at Olympia and show Pheasants, not as individuals but as a
Society. We shall arrange to have made suitable cages for purposes of exhibi-
tion and these will be lent to members at a nominal price. There will be
many other minor motives but all will tend to one common object, namely
the popularization of ornamental Pheasants.
The subscription is exceedingly low, a mere 5s., and may we hope that not
only members of the Avicultural Society who are interested in Pheasants
will join but also all those who are true lovers of birds. Every fancier who
keeps and breeds ornamental Pheasants is accomplishing something for which
our descendants will have cause to thank us. Perhaps no group of birds in
the world are in more danger of total extinction, for it must be remembered
that they are not only edible but their gay feathers make them a subject of
attack from the natives of all countries in which they five. To mention but
one Pheasant, the Elliot (Syrmaticus ellioti). Ten years ago this bird was
hardly known in England or the Continent: a few specimens found their

way to England and France. Two gentlemen in particular bred these
successfully and to-day they are not uncommon: many specimens have
been exported to America where they are now also established in aviaries.
In all probability the Elliot Pheasant is now safe for all time. This
example is mentioned just to point out that everyone who joins the Society
will be doing something towards helping us to fulfil our ambition, namely
the keeping and breeding of ornamental Pheasants.
Is it too much to expect a most hearty and spontaneous response to this
appeal for your support ?
We want not only the financial help of your members but still more so
the moral support from you as members of the largest avicultural society in
the world. It may be added that we shall welcome members from all parts
of the globe.
The subscription of 5s. should be sent to-day to our Secretary, Miss J. M.
Grant-Ives, Wellesbourne, Warwick.
We thank you now.

BREEDING THE CEYLON BULBUL
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.979526826086956" page_id="56222864"  page_num="238" year="" vol="">
Members will be interested to hear that after years of disappointment
in breeding I have been able to bring a Ceylon Bulbul to maturity.
I learn from Mr. George Brown, of Ceylon, and further, through him,
from Mr. Ezra, that these Bulbuls have a habit of rearing their young for two
or three days and then pitching the young brood out of the nest. This has
been my experience.
My wife brought home two of these Ceylon Bulbuls when very young, and
they became so tame on the voyage home that they were permitted to fly
about the cabin with the door and port shut, and she found no difficulty in
feeding them.
We have found the very greatest difficulty in our attempts the last few
years to bring the young ones to maturity, owing to the feeding, but this time
we segregated the parents from other tropical birds which we have in the
aviary and they fed the young ones on currants, fruit, meal-worms, etc. They
were particularly keen on meal-worms.
The young one is now flying about the aviary and is a very " hardy young
person ".
I further understand from Mr. G. H. Brown that in years gone by the
Europeans in Ceylon described these birds as the Ceylon Nightingale, and it is
so referred to in Persian poetry. Although not a first-rate singer, it certainly
has a very pleasant, homely chirruping warble, and at times is a very good
mimic.

BIRDS OF A TASMANIAN GARDEN
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99864402" page_id="56222865"  page_num="239" year="" vol="">
One of the first birds a new-comer to Tasmania will notice is our old friend
the Sparrow; there is no need to say anything about him beyond the fact
that he has thrived and increased to such an extent that he has become
a pest.
Really beautiful birds are the Robins, the Scarlet-breasted, Flame-,
Pink-breasted, and Dusky, the latter being without the beautiful red colouring
of the other kinds.
Then the really beautiful Blue Wrens, with their brilliant blue feathering,
and the curious and much more rare Emu Wren.
Beautiful as all these birds are, I cannot remember seeing one of them in
captivity either here or in their native country. A difficult task to import
the Wrens, I imagine, but surely the Robins could be brought. Looking
back on the years I spent in Tasmania the only small bird commonly kept in
a cage was the Zosterops, but by that name I doubt if anyone in Tasmania
would know the bird, as everyone called it the White-eye. There used to be
a shop--a fishmonger's--in Elizabeth Street, Hobart, where birds could
be bought and the best Zosterops could be bought for a few coppers.
Very plentiful in the gardens around Hobart is the White-backed Magpie,
a handsome bird and thought highly of by Tasmanians. He lacks the long
tail of his English namesake and in build is more like a Crow or Jackdaw.
It may be seen in large numbers following the plough in the orchards
around Hobart, and they must rank as great friends of the farmer.
The commonest bird kept as a pet is the Galah, although it is not a
common bird in a wild state there, most of them being sent over from the
mainland of Australia. Some are quite good talkers, and quite young birds,
little more than nestlings, are bought each season for half a crown a head.
The Rosella is another bird often kept as a pet, usually in a rough box with
a piece of netting roughly nailed over the front. At the shop already mentioned
I once purchased a really fine specimen of the Mealy Rosella for the absurd
price of half a crown. What would such a bird fetch in England to-day ?
In the South of Tasmania the local boys were fond of keeping a small
dingy green Parrakeet similar in colour to a hen Madagascar Parrakeet.
The name of this bird I cannot now recollect, but locally they were termed
" Green Parrots ". Another Parrakeet in demand by youthful bird lovers was
a more gorgeously coloured bird known to their youthful owners as " Yellow-
bellies ". The " Green Parrot" would descend in small flocks on the cherry
trees in the Huon district and feed on the fruit, while on the ground the
observer was showered with the juice. This happened to me while living on the
Huon River in 1912.
During some years spent in Tasmania I cannot recollect seeing a
Budgerigar either wild or caged, and speaking from memory I never heard it
called Budgerigar, but either Shell Parrot or Grass Parrot. Another bird
known to us as the Cockatiel was always called the Cockatoo Parrot both in
Tasmania and on the mainland of Australia.
A bird never heard of in England, at least to my knowledge, is the Mutton
Bird, a species of Petrel. Thousands of these birds are killed and salted or
pickled in barrels and eaten by people who informed me they were very tasty.
I sampled one but the strong fishy flavour and oily flesh convinced me that
a little would go a long way. On another occasion I met a party in the bush
and was invited to join in their meal. I sampled the stew but could make no

impression on the meat, which seemed to me to be very tough, tasteless
stuff. It appeared some of the party had been out shooting and had bagged
several White Cockatoos, which had been prepared and consigned to the pot.
I never again indulged in these dishes.
On one occasion on the road I was passed by a car with something which
I took to be part of a lady's boa hanging from the dickey. I gave chase and
told the solitary occupant he was likely to lose the " boa ". When he opened
the dickey I was surprised to find it stuffed full of Black Swans. It appeared
he had had a good day's shooting, but as it was the close season for Swans he
did not wish to advertise the fact. I believe he was liable to a fine of #1 for
each bird had it been discovered. Before proceeding he insisted on presenting
me with a Swan. I strongly dislike plucking and " drawing " birds of any
kind, but a neighbour's wife prepared and cooked the bird and I joined them
at supper where the Swan was the chief dish and very good it was, though
I understand an old Swan is very tough and tasteless.
Several varieties of English birds released in Tasmania have established
themselves there and my chief favourite was the Skylark, which seem to be
in considerable numbers around Hobart.

DETAILS FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF AN
OUTDOOR FLIGHT FOR BUDGERIGARS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.985677380952381" page_id="56222873"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
By Frank W. Hansell
In the issue of the Magazine for April, 1935, pp. 108-112, I
endeavoured to describe how to make an outdoor aviary for Budgerigars.
The following is a brief description of the construction of the flight
used in conjunction with the aviary.
When building the flight one or two factors have to be borne in
mind, i.e. the general appearance must not be unsightly, the building
must be substantial and yet not be too cumbersome so as to obscure
a good view of the birds.
It may be seen on the plan (Fig. 1) that the flight has a length of
14 ft. 2 in. and a width of 10 ft. 9 in. The height being 7 ft. 4 in., as
shown on the elevation (Fig. 2), this gives an area of approximately
1,110 cubic feet, after allowing for the attendant's entrance.
Commencing with the actual construction, the first procedure was
to erect seven larch poles, each 8 ft. 10 in. by 5 in. by 4 in., at the
points as shown on plan. The thick end being embedded 1-6 inches
in the ground, this leaves 7 ft. 4 in. above the surface. When filling
in the holes at the foot of the poles, it is essential that the soil be well
beaten in, and that each pole is set perfectly perpendicular. If white
wood poles are used in place of larch, the bases would require to be
well tarred. To form a wind break and shelter for the birds, four

larch poles, round the three sides of the flight. One of the boards is
sunk below the surface of the ground to act as a retaining board for
sand, etc.
It might be mentioned at this point that the flight was treated
in the same manner as the aviary, having S in. mesh netting on all
sides, this being let into the ground for 15 inches and stapled to the
board already referred to. This prevents vermin getting access to
the interior of the flight.
On top of the poles 2 by 2 in. bearers are nailed, also across
at points lettered "A " on plan (Fig. 1).
As a matter of convenience for the attendant entering and leaving
the flight, it was thought advisable to have a double entrance, to
preclude birds escaping. A small piece of the flight is taken ofl, as
shown on plan, and a doorway formed, the door being hung on a
3 by 3 in. upright, which is braced with 2 by 2 in. batten at
the top and bottom, to the aviary and pole. This inner doorway is,
of course, not a necessity, but proves well worth the little extra time
in making.
Before putting on the J in. galvanized wire netting, lengths of
No. 10 gauze galvanized wire should be stapled on to the framework
at points " B " as shown on plan. The netting may now be laid on
in the direction of the two arrows, and securely stapled to the top
of the 2 by 2 in. batten, the netting being laced on to the No. 10
wire strands with No. 18 gauge wire. This makes a tight joint between
each width of netting. It should also be given an occasional lace to
the wires running in the opposite direction : this eliminates sagging iu
wet or snowy weather.
The netting round the sides should be put on in the same manner ;
the wire to which it is laced is No. 8, and a small ratchet is used to keep
it taut.
On top of the 2 by 2 in. batten and netting, on the whole length,
are small plates 3 by J in. to exclude water. The doors are made
up with 2 by 1 in. framework, and netted. On the outer door a
padlock is fitted. In order that the outer door may fit well, two plates,
3 by 1 in., are nailed on to the larch poles.

The whole of the woodwork is well treated with creosote, which
of course should be allowed to dry before the flight is tenanted.
The appearance of the flight and aviary may be seen from the
photos far better than it can be described in words.
In this particular flight half of the ground area is laid out in grass,
which is allowed to seed, the other half being sand. One or two
small bushes and trees are also provided. The birds can then select
from these perches most suited to their own individual liking.

BREEDING OF THE ROYAL PARROT FINCH

By C. H. Macklin, F.Z.S., M.R.C.S., L.R.C.P.
In April, 1934, I obtained from Messrs. Goodfellow &amp; Mayer a
pair of Royal Parrot Finches from the first importation. They were
young birds and one still in juvenile plumage with the blue head, but
they turned out to be a true pair, although the sexual difference did
not show clearly until their first full moult nearly a year after I obtained
them. Then it was quite easy to see that the cock had considerably
more blue than green in the body plumage in comparison with the hen
and his red head was distinctly brighter ; the red also extending a
little further back on the nape in the cock bird.
When I first got them their wings were badly frayed, but they
were so wild in a cage that I decided to risk it and put them in an
outdoor aviary ; here they spent most of their time climbing and
hopping about in the shrubs and soon the cock bird was flying well,
but the hen was rather weak on the wing. By the end of the summer
they had grown new flights and were both in very good plumage, but
had made no attempt whatever to nest. They " did themselves " very
well, taking large quantities of soft food (" Mosquito "), meal-worms,
millet spray, apple and green food, seeding grass, chickweed, and lettuce ;
they took very little of the ordinary seed mixture of canary and millet.
In October I took them indoors and tried to steady them for show,
and did manage to send them to Cambridge, Hitchin, and Leicester,
where they took first prizes in their class ; steadiness was not one of

tlieir good points, and at Nottingham they dropped to " Commended ",
for by this time they had worn off a lot of feathers round the beak and
broken some of their tail and flight feathers. This was in November,
and I then put them in an indoor aviary, where they were much quieter
than in the cage, in fact cage life definitely does not suit them. About
the end of February they started a good moult which they finished
early in April. On 15th April I put them outdoors in the same aviary
they had occupied the previous summer.
This aviary was designed for Waxbills with  |in. mesh wire and
consists of a shelter shed with glass front 4J by 5 feet, 5J feet high in
front and 6J feet at the back ; matchboard sides, boarded floor, and
boarded and felted roof ; a covered flight with open front and boarded
floor 4 |by 5 feet and an open flight 12 by 5 feet. The back of the
flight is an ivy-covered wall, and there are growing shrubs of box,
euonymus, and prunus ; the floor is partly turf and partly a sanded path.
The Parrot Finches had for company pairs of Cherry Finches, Cuban
Finches, Aurora Finches, Greater St. Helena Waxbills, Green Avadavats,
Lavender Finches, and a cock Amethyst-rumped Sunbird; they
were therefore the largest birds in the aviary, but they have always
been well behaved, taking very little notice of the other occupants
except to get the biggest share of the meal-worms, of which they are
very fond.
Within a week of being turned out they began to build a nest and
chose for the site a " Hartz " travelling cage hung up in the top
corner of the inside shelter farthest from the door to the flight. I had
put a wisp of hay in the cage, and they proceeded to fill it up with
grass stems, dead leaves, pieces of straw, and fibrous grass roots which
they found in the flight. On examining the nest after the young birds
had flown I found it was very compactly made; the entrance was in
the form of a sloping tunnel which went up about 3 inches to the nest
proper. They took about a fortnight to construct the nest and on
15th May I dared to investigate with my finger and could just reach
the nest cavity and feel that there were eggs. After this I left the
nest severely alone and did not even venture into the shelter. Both
birds sat, the hen chiefly at night and the cock during a good part of the
day. On 3rd June I heard faint squeaks coming from the nest, and

for the next week the young birds were loud in their clamour for food
but were quieter later. The parents fed them frequently, using chiefly
the soft food and meal-worms ; they also helped themselves to the
Sunbirds' nectar quite freely at this time and ate a good deal of apple
and seeding grass.
On 9th June I got a peep at the nest while both the parents were out
in the flight and, by using an electric throat lamp and mirror, could
see that there were two youngsters and that they were just getting
their wing and tail quills. On 22nd June they were ready to leave
the nest ; in fact for a day or two I had seen two little yellow bills
at the entrance.
Unfortunately it turned very hot and the temperature rose
tremendously inside the shelter where the nest was, near the roof, and
one of the youngsters collapsed and died in the nest entrance ; the other
I found in the outside flight quite strong on the wing : he roosted
outside in the ivy and never went back to the nest.
The young had dark green bodies and wings, deep blue heads, and
red tails and tail coverts ; the beak was orange yellow, ornamented at
the corners of a wide gape with four luminous blue spots ; feet and legs
whitish grey.
Both parents fed the youngster frequently, regurgitating food from
the crop in the usual Grass Finch manner. By 25th June he was pecking
at spray millet and soon helped himself to soft food. He is now
(11th July) quite independent and is doing well. The beak is still
yellow but the luminous spots at the corners have nearly gone and he
has lost his babyish look and is now as big as the hen.
The parents have built a second nest in the shelter again, but this
time in a small wooden box, about 6 by 4 by 4 inches, with half the front
open: it is again very compact, made of grass stems, bits of straw,
dead leaves, and roots ; no feathers were used either time. There are
now three eggs and the birds have just started to sit. I am hoping
this time to be able to supply some live ant " eggs ", which they liked
last year and which will probably be better for the young birds than
too many meal-worms.
The Boyal Parrot Finch is a fascinating little bird but needs care ;
he does not do well in a cage and will not live on seed alone, for he is

much keener on live food and soft food. The cock has apparently no
song, and their only note is a high-pitched bat-like squeak which they
use to call to each other.
I hope some other members of the Society will also be successful in
breeding this bird, and I should very much like to hear from anyone
who does so with a view to exchanging some of the aviary-bred young,
if I am lucky enough to breed more than my present solitary one.

While the contents of Mr. C. S. Webb's article on " The Parrot Ban
and the Future of Aviculture " in the August number of the Magazine
are not likely to find favour with all interested in foreign birds, I believe
the writer's sentiments will be echoed by most members of our Society.
As one who suffers many qualms of conscience about this matter of
importation, I feel I can do no other than express agreement with
Mr. Webb's main contention and, in so doing, put forward some
suggestions for combating the abuse.
That, as Mr. Webb points out, these abuses must sooner or later
have the effect of drying up the supplies upon which we are so largely
dependent is, in itself, a serious consideration but, in my opinion, it is
much more serious that we should be, as at present, lending ourselves,
however unwillingly, to their continuation.
The truth is that the natural desire to secure some rare specimen
induces many of us to be less particular than we should be of the
conditions under which such birds come to us. In too many cases,
I fear, inquiry would reveal the fact that our prized possession was one
of a considerable number, many of which perished en route, and all
of which were packed and imported under conditions qualified to give
the " cranks " a whip to beat us with.
For this matter of importation is the Achilles' heel of Aviculture,
and leaves those of us who occasionally speak or write on the subject
open to attack by anyone aware of this weakness in our armour.

On all other points we are, I believe, invulnerable, and it is the
greater pity we should thus be left open to attack by those " dear good
people ", whose zeal is often so much greater than their knowledge.
To " suffer fools gladly " is never easy, especially when they speak as
though they themselves were the only people in the world with any
solicitude for the welfare of birds and beasts, but that difficulty is
increased when, all the while, one has an uneasy feeling that there is
" some method in their madness
Now for the suggestions--which I am well aware are open to
criticism and which, indeed, are put forward with that hope and

foreign birds, so as to be less dependent on importation. A good deal
has already been done in this direction with certain species such as
Zebra, Parrot, and Gouldian Finches. As instanced in the case of
Cockatiels and other Parrot-like birds, the practical difficulty lies in
securing fresh blood, and so avoiding the evils of inter-breeding, but
it should not require much organization to overcome this difficulty
by arranging exchanges between members.
Apart from the rather haphazard method of advertising in the
Magazine we have no machinery for the exchange of species. In my
opinion we need a list of members who specialize in any particular
species, and from whom other breeders could, when necessary, secure
a change of blood. For instance, I am at present building up a strain
of aviary-bred R.H. Parrot Finches, but I have no means of knowing
what other members of the Society are doing likewise.
(2) The compilation and distribution amongst members of a list
of dealers and importers who are known to import their birds under
proper conditions, so that our members could secure their birds through
them with a clear conscience.
(3) I put this last, as the most controversial of all: The formation
of a committee of members (or a sub-committee of the Council) to
consider the possibility of arranging for direct importation for the
benefit of all members who desire to avail themselves of it. We may
not be a very large Society, but I venture to suggest that we are
sufficiently large and responsible to be in a position to secure consign-

ments of birds in this way with far less difficulty than would be
experienced by individual dealers and importers. The price might be
higher, but I am sure I speak for the majority of members, as well as
for myself, when I say that we would prefer to pay more for birds
about the manner of whose importation we had no qualms.
If such a co-operative scheme could be introduced it would have the
additional advantages of providing us with birds in better condition,
because more carefully packed and better treated en route ; and also
of bringing within the reach of our members many of those species
now almost unobtainable because the ordinary dealer or importer
has, perforce, to supply a demand, and that demand is mostly for the
better-known species.
There must be a very considerable number of species suitable for
aviculture which have never yet been imported--and never will be,
so long as birds are only brought over to meet an existing demand.
A collector, acting on behalf of a society most of whose members
are only too anxious to secure and experiment with new species,
and in co-operation with an importer or importers sure of a
demand for such rare birds, should be in a much better position to
secure them. It will be seen that, apart from practical difficulties,
about which I am not qualified to speak, the success of any or all of
these suggestions depends upon the extent to which we, as members
of a society, are prepared to co-operate for our mutual advantage, and
in order to mitigate an abuse which, I feel confident, must be a source
of considerable heart-searching to many others besides myself.

To a person possessing but one naturally planted aviary it is always
rather a problem to decide what selection of birds to house in it.
If one is going in exclusively for breeding, none but the very largest
and most thickly planted enclosures can safely contain more than
a few breeding pairs with any real prospect of success, though this
may be fun for the birds it is less amusing for their owners, for so few

birds in a comparatively large space will be bardly ever seen, giving
the aviary a deserted appearance, which is just what I wanted to
avoid.
As far as breeding goes my whole time is spent endeavouring to
build up breeding stocks of the rarer Australian Parrakeets, and to save
the rarest of them from the early extinction to which they seemed
doomed in a wild state.
I therefore wanted to make my planted aviary purely a source of
relaxation to its owner, unmixed with the anxiety which always accom-
panies breeding operations, and which in my case would have been
doubled, as I should not have had the time to provide sufficient live
insects for the young of the insectivorous species I had decided
to keep.
The obvious thing was an aviary of bachelors, and this is proving
a great success.
The aviary itself is about 35 feet long by 20 feet wide by 9 feet high,
constructed of natural larch poles, with, at one end, a shelter shed
entirely hidden by a surrounding thicket. The flight was built to
enclose part of a lawn and the end of a dense hedge of snowberry which
was thinned out to form two or three thick bushes. It also contains
rambling roses, jasmine, and honeysuckle climbing up the supporting
pillars.
The aviary is close to a lily pool and abuts on to a lawn where we
have tea in summer.
When the first of our yearly consignments of insectivorous birds
arrived here in the spring, I decided to pick out anything that particu-
larly appealed to me from the point of view of colour or song--or
preferably both.
The first occupant of the aviary was a Virginian Cardinal, which
I think must have hailed from Mexico as he was rather slim for a Cardinal
and of the most amazingly brilliant scarlet, being far and away the
best of a particularly well-coloured batch of these birds.
He was turned into the aviary about the middle of April and at
once started to sing. His song is what one might describe as " quite
pleasing 5 ', though it in no way justifies his alternative name of Virginian
Nightingale, since it entirely lacks the uniquely mysterious quality

of the true Nightingale's song, which to be fully appreciated needs to
be suddenly heard in a moon-dappled wood, where all else is summer-
night silence.
The Cardinal's first companion was a Pekin Robin who had been
singing with particular sweetness in a cage, so that the former's per-
petual " Chee-ow . . . Chee-ow . . . cheow . . . chow . . . chow . . .
chow . . . chow ", was now intermingled with the song of the Pekin
Robin, which was such a heartening sound during the bitter weather
we had in May, and which, I always think, is one of the most joyful
little lays imaginable.
The April weather was warm when the Pekin Robin was intro-
duced, and immediately afterwards I turned a Rufous-bellied Niltava
into the aviary. I had had him for three weeks or so in a cage in a warm
room, during which time he lived exclusively on sweet ripe apples and
about seven mealworms a day, disdaining all other food he was offered.
When I caught him up to put him in the aviary he had some sort of
fit, and I gave him up for lost, but when he was almost dead he made a
miraculous recovery by dint of being given, on the end of a small
paintbrush, a mixture of egg and milk beaten up with a very little
brandy, which incidentally is the most marvellous concoction for saving
the life of a bird already in extremis.
Having been warned by Mr. Anthony Chaplin that Niltavas had
weak lungs, and by Dr. Amsler that they were decidedly " difficult "
birds, it was somewhat in fear and trembling that I finally turned
him into the aviary.
He proceeded to roost in a low bush and next morning I hurried
forth fearing he would probably have pneumonia, but found him
none the worse for his night out. Shortly afterwards the weather
became really Arctic and there was ice on the pond two mornings
running.
I determined to take the Niltava in again, but he looked so well
I delayed his removal indoors, and the extraordinary thing is he not
only continued to look well, but he actually improved during all that
bitterly cold unpleasant weather.
Quite probably he is a particularly " tough " specimen of a
Niltava, but even so I think his survival of about the worst our climate

can do in the way of sudden changes does show how enormously even
the most notoriously delicate birds benefit from plenty of fresh air and
exercise as opposed to coddling in a hothouse.
A striking example of this was a consignment of Painted Finches--*
the genuine article Emblema jpicta --which arrived here in March. They
were doing so badly in a large cage in our acclimatizing room, whose
temperature never falls much below 70* in winter, that in desperation
I turned them out into an aviary with a heated shelter. In this, though
they persisted in spending most of their time out in the wire run in
anything but genial weather, they rapidly improved and are now all
in perfect condition.
To return, however, to my bachelor aviary : The Niltava is always
listening. He will sit for minutes on end almost motionless with
his head cocked on one side and his wonderfully vivid cobalt blue
cap and orange russet breast shining in the sun. Then quite suddenly
he will jerk his tail up and down, will as it were float swiftly up to
one of the larch uprights of the aviary, capture his prey, and be off
again with his rapid slanting flight into the undergrowth. After that
one often sees nothing more of him until evening, when he usually
perches on the highest branch in the aviary to greet the gathering
dusk with his miniature twilight song--a tiny silvery cascade of muted
bells.
Perhaps the Niltava's extreme reluctance to show himself is his
chief drawback as an aviary bird. So much of his time is spent skulking
in the thick undergrowth, though even this probably adds to the
pleasure one has in seeing him when he does sometimes come out to
sit in the sun.
If Niltavas seldom show themselves, however, this applies even more
to two other and later editions to the aviary--the beautiful Rainbow
and Versicolor Buntings. Incidentally, I had no idea until I actually
saw the latter, which is one of the rarest of the Buntings, how extremely
lovely he is with his perfectly blended blues, mauves, and purplish
reds. Most of the illustrations I have seen make the bird appear a sad
mess of jumbled jarring colours, though in fairness to the artists
one should own that a Versicolor must be a difficult bird to do justice
to on paper.

The other two representatives of the Bunting family in the aviary
are an American Nonpariel--a lovely bird when first imported, but too
often losing his original bright scarlet breast colour in captivity--
and an Indigo, the beauty of whose blue livery is sufficiently vouched
for by the fact that the Niltava deigns to treat him as a rival and
chases him about--though with no serious results--if the two happen
to meet.
This habit birds have of chasing about and treating as rivals
other birds generically unrelated to them, but possessing the same
colour scheme, has been frequently observed and is not hard to
understand. A Shama, which sang very sweetly when first put in the
aviary is now moulting hard and is seldom seen--preferring apparently
to spring the full glory of his long black and white tail as a dramatic
surprise on his companions, rather than to risk an anti-climax by
appearing among them with it but half grown.
Whether he will be a bully later on I cannot tell, but at present
he is, naturally, quite peacable. A Giant Whydah is just in the process
of doing his miraculous transformation scene from a large dull-coloured
Sparrow-like bird to a fantastically beautiful creature of glossy black,
relieved with red shoulder patches and graced with a many-shafted
tail of inordinate length which undulates in flight with a gracefulness
of which the bird seems well aware, as he flies to and fro in the aviary
with matchless, if a trifle self-conscious, buoyancy.
He has made a sort of playground on top of one of the bushes
and does mysterious and engrossing things there, puffing himself up
the while and singing all the time with apparent terrific effort but
no audible result except a somewhat harsh grating sound.
A Blue-winged Siva--a pleasing little cafe au lait and pale blue
bird---hero-worshipped the Pekin Robin from the start, but the latter
was, at first, somewhat bored by his attentions and obviously disliked
being constantly followed about by his adoring companion. Now,
however, the two are friends even to the extent of being on preening
terms, indeed, it's quite possible that the Blue-winged Siva is a hen
and has no rightful place in my bachelor aviary, for the sexes are
hard enough to distinguish !

Whether or no the Siva is a hen he (or she) is certainly the embodi-
ment of energy and approaches more nearly than anything else I
know to my idea of perpetual motion. No matter how hot the day the
little Blue-winged Siva can always be seen flying tirelessly from end
to end and across the aviary, followed almost languidly by his Pekin
Robin companion who is himself no sluggard, and expertly catching
any small insects that happen to come his (or her) way. Nor does its
energy quickly abate, for it is just as active even in the twilight, and
I can only hope it roosts quietly at night otherwise I feel sure it would
be a ripe candidate for a nervous breakdown !
A Golden-fronted Fruitsucker is a tease rather than a bully, and
has necessitated my putting several pots of the same kind of food in
different parts of the aviary. He never actually molests the other birds
but, like Sunbirds, loves to take up a point of vantage and drive them
away from the food pots from sheer mischief.
* The Mexican Yellow Grosbeak is rare and in many ways the most
attractive bird in my planted aviary. He arrived here as the sole
member of his genus among a lot of other birds, and I picked him out
to keep at once because he satisfied my senses both of the sublime and
the ridiculous. His song will, I feel sure, one day be sublime--it consists
at present of a few short but mellow notes--and his form is gloriously
ridiculous--like a child's wooden toy painted in bright yellow, black,
and white, with an enormous beak worthy of a Puffin. He could easily
do frightful havoc with that formidable beak of his, but actually he
is a clumsy and sedate and amiable and altogether lovable bird, and
I have left him to the last because he is so attractive.
I hope these random notes of mine may be of some assistance to
those who possess but one planted aviary and are wondering what
selection of birds they should put in it.

Chaffinch (Fringilla ccelebs Linn.)
The authorities say that it has often been bred both in cages,
outdoor aviaries, and bird-rooms. The earliest British record I know
is Croker's in 1914 (B.N., 1915, 341), but no doubt they had been
bred before.
Mr. Meade-Waldo told me (in lit . 25-1-1930) that he bred the
Canary Islands' race, F. coelebs canariensis V., about 1905, and
Mr. Blaauw wrote, 5-4-33, that he had bred the Algerian race,
F. c. spodiogenys Bp., in his aviaries at Gooilust, Holland, " many
years ago."
Hybrids 1
Chaffinch x Greenfinch
Recorded in Page's book and in B.N., 1912, 216. Paterson gives
an account of one hatched and fully reared in a garden aviary in 1911.
Chaffinch x Brambling
First bred by Miss Reeves in Kent in 1906 ; on this Allen Silver
writes ( B.N. , 1907, 174), " Miss Reeves reared two in 1906. . . . This
year she has continued her experiments on a larger scale . . . (and
has) already about a dozen young birds fending for themselves. They
have been bred both ways . . . were reared in wild nests." (See also
under Brambling.)
Chaffinch x Canary
TestePage, who probably based his statement on A.31., 1908, 241,
where Alys Gorter -writes that she (or he) has one young hybrid alive
and sends a dead one for examination. Of the correctness of the
identification, the Editor (Dr. Butler) is doubtful. Another case of
the same kind has been recorded in Germany.

This cross was bred by Reeves in 1906 (a good number) and House
about the same date. Allen Silver writes of Miss Reeves' successes,
in A.M., 1911, 34, that the eggs were collected from a large aviary,
which contained opposite sexes of the two Finches, and hatched and
reared in the nests of wild Robins, Hedge Sparrows, Great Tits, etc.,
in the neighbourhood, the young hybrids being removed from these
before they flew. Since 1907 at least twenty of these hybrids had been
reared to maturity. With the article appeared a coloured plate showing
both sexes of the cross, and in a note to it the Editor says that
" Mr. John House of Dundee bred five Brambling-Chaffinch hybrids
six years ago ". In the Reeves' case one has to realize that captivity
played but a minor part, as only the pairing, egg-laying, and final
rearing took place there. Both Yale and Page include the cross in
their lists, and the former says that such hybrids are fertile, but on
what authority is not stated, and in any case he w x as probably referring
to wild bred hybrids.
A more recent record of the rearing of a Brambling-Chaffinch
hybrid is reported by Sweetnam in A.M., 1932, p. 179.
The cross the other way was also bred by Miss Reeves (see under
Chaffinch).
1 Mr. Merriman, of Chesham, tells me in a letter ( October , 1934), that he
knows of a recent success with Bramhlings ; a Mr. Carr told him that he had
bred, reared, and moulted Bramble Finches in 1934, and that one, a hen, had been
exhibited. I hope this was, or will be, put on record somewhere.

GREY LAG GEESE
By Seton Gordon

<bodyText confidence="0.993277380952381" page_id="56222892"  page_num="258" year="" vol="">
In April, 1933, my wife and I were presented with a pair of Grey Lag
Geese which had been netted.
When they first arrived the birds, which had had their wings cut,
were very wild, and both escaped from their enclosure. One was
found and returned to us, the other, although we had reports of it
from an island several miles away, was not seen again by us.
We made a grassy run for the surviving Goose, and in a couple
of months it became tame. At the end of the summer it was allowed
its liberty, and used to return each night to its shelter. By this time
its wings had grown, and we decided that, as it had lost its mate, we
would not attempt to keep it longer. In October the wild Geese arrived
on the windswept heights of northern Skye, and flew over our house,
calling, several times a day. For the first few days our Goose went
off with the wanderers during the day, but returned at night to us.
Then one day it was missing at nightfall from its usual quarters, and
we knew that it had joined the wild geese and had entered into that
fuller life for which it had doubtless longed.

notes. They are particularly interesting because the writer, in
addition to being a first-class ornithologist, has a literary style of

On taking over the management of Mrs. Dunn's collection of foreign
birds at The Nash, Kempsey, I found a fine pair of the King Parrakeet.
I was informed that during last summer two clutches of eggs had
been laid, but that the hen always deserted the eggs when on the
point of hatching. This year I gave them a new enclosure, with
several nesting logs, and hoped for better results. However, they

would have nothing to do with the nest-boxes, and during May three
eggs were laid on the ground of the outside flight. The hen sat quite
well, and my hopes rose day by day as hatching time came nearer ;
but, alas ! they were suddenly dashed to the ground.
Early one morning I found that once again she had deserted :
the eggs were quite cold. I left them a while longer to see if she would
return ; but no such luck, so I gathered up the eggs and, placing them
in some lukewarm water, found that one of them at least contained
a live chick. What could I do with it ? I had no other birds sitting
at this time except a pair of Pennant's and I dare not risk interfering
with these. I was just about to throw the eggs away when suddenly
a Silky Bantam cock began to crow. The Silky hen wa? incubating
some Quails' eggs, so under her went the King's eggs. Three days later
one hatched out ; the other two contained dead chicks. I took away
the young one and placed it in a brooder which I had fitted up for
the birds in case of egg-binding. With the aid of an incubator lamp
I was able to keep a regular temperature of 85*. Next day the chick
was quite strong, so I commenced to feed it, mixing up the following
mixture : Equal parts of soaked pea-nuts and sunflower seed ; half
part of grated apple ; a small quantity of Horlick's Malted Milk ;
chopped up milk thistle, and a pinch of Marmite. This w~as moistened
with the yolk of an egg and, placing the mixture in the mouth, I
chewed it up to a milky pulp and fed the little bird from the mouth.
It took its food quite readily. I placed the chick in a flower pot with
a small quantity of decayed wood at the bottom. All went well ; the
chick began to grow and was quite strong.
At twelve days the eyes began to open and at sixteen days they
were wide open ; feathers also began to make their appearance, and
I had great hopes of a successful rearing. At three weeks it was
fairly well covered with feathers. I then thought it advisable to
place it in a nesting log, so I got one that is used for small Lovebirds.
It continued to grow, and I was highly delighted. I used to write to
my employer every few days telling her how the bird was progressing :
she was away from home at the time. All went well for a few more
days and then came disaster. Somehow during the night it managed
to crawl out of the log, and next morning I found it floundering on

the bottom of the brooder. In falling it must have hurt its legs, for
it could not stand. I kept it alive for a few days longer, but I could
see that even if it lived it would always be a helpless cripple, so I had
to destroy it. What a pity ; it deserved a better fate. Thus ended
our hopes of a young King this year.
The Pennant's, a fine breeding pair, laid seven eggs. Six hatched
out ; one of them, however, hatched several days after the others,
and it was always rather a weakling, no doubt not getting its share
of food. I was almost certain that it would never survive, so I decided
once again to try my hand at rearing it. I took it away from its
parents and placed it in the brooder. This time, instead of using
the nest log, I made use of a small box with a lid. I meant to have no
more climbing out, for I had learnt my lesson. I gave it the same
treatment as I had given to the King. It was surprising how quickly
it grew. Soon it was as large as its brothers and sisters, which were
left with their parents. It is now able to feed itself, and is quite strong
and a good flyer. It is never so happy as when it is being petted, and
likes to perch on one's shoulder.

Indian Green-winged Dove (Chalcophaps indica ).--A breeding
pair of these handsome but shy birds was kept in an aviary with some
Finches, Canaries, and Diamond Doves. Not until the second year
did they nest ; then in a semi-dark corner. Always the bird sitting
on the nest would fly off at my approach, no matter how gently I
entered their aviary. Their first setting of eggs came on 14th May,
and on 31st May one squab hatched, the other egg being infertile.
I was very agreeably surprised to find the parents very solicitous about
the youngster. This was the case even after he left the nest on 15tb
June, when he was hardly able to fly. On 29th June he was feeding
himself ; at night he always slept huddled close to his father. The
outstanding characteristic of this pair of Green-wings is that they
are shy birds, but excellent parents.

On 20th June I found the second setting of eggs which, however,
was left three days later when a 5-ft. gopher snake, which incidentally
devoured three Canary nestlings, disturbed all the occupants of this
particular aviary. Fortunately I caught the snake promptly. The
third setting of eggs came 1st July. The male Green-wing still guards
the now full-grown youngster very jealously, fighting off other Doves
and Quail very determinedly. On 5th July the pair was transferred
to a more sheltered aviary, and by 10th July I saw the male carrying
nesting material. The fourth setting of eggs was laid 18th July.

eggs on 4th July. During all these " sittings 55 they used but two
nesting places, both largely hidden from view. On 11th July the
seventh setting of eggs was deposited, and on 25th July two young
hatched. This is the first time that this pair of Doves has had young.
At this writing the female is frequently off the nest to fight the male
unmercifully, so that I had to remove him temporarily from the aviary.
The moment she found that the male was gone she returned to her
as yet tiny youngsters.
One of the most important and difficult problems is to find Doves
which will serve as foster-parents. Some Dove fanciers use Kingneck
Doves with reasonably good success ; others the California Mourning
Dove. It seems that as soon as the Kingneck Doves discover that
the colouring of their offspring is dark, they leave them. Some breeders
have overcome this negative tendency by placing the nest-boxes of
these foster-parents in such dark places that the birds cannot detect
the colour of the young until these have left the nest.
Decently a shipment of the Martinican (or Aurita) Doves (Zenaida
aurita ) found its way to California, being disposed of at from $20
to $25 a pair. It is claimed that this is the first importation into
this country.

A moment's consideration by those who are antagonistic towards the
opinions and suggestions put forward by Mr. Porter in his excellent article
on the Parrot Ban, should suffice to convince them of the elementary fact
that, had it not been for the type of dealer to which Mr. Porter refers,
psittacosis and the Parrot Ban would be unknown.
Any legislation for the prevention of cruelty to birds by this type of
dealer is denounced by those who mistake it for an attack on Aviculture,
but more generally by those who claim to be bird lovers, who refer to birds
as "our feathered friends", and whose chief argument appears to be that
it is not as cruel as fox-hunting.
As your correspondent says, the matter is one of great importance to
aviculturists, therefore, I say, Mr. Porter's article was well worthy of
inclusion in the Magazine.

Correspondence 263
I would not trouble you with another letter, but that the matter ia so
serious to aviculturists.
The article on Aviculture in this month's issue of the Magazine seems
so disloyal to bird-keepers that it cannot lightly be passed over.
If the writer knows that bird dealers import these birds in a cruel and
disgusting manner, why does he not either charge the dealer or dealers with
it or lay the matter before a committee of the Avicultural Society, who
could surely reprimand the guilty one. What is the use of writing indefinite
abusive letters to the papers ?
Prejudiced people simply use them as powerful propaganda for these
virulent and wholly unjustifiable attacks on bird-keepers. I know from
experience how utterly unreasonable and wilfully blind these people are.
They refuse even to look at a pet bird, and will not listen to what is not
only common sense, but a crying need for all bird-lovers to support, as unless
Aviculture does come to the aid of Nature, many of our loveliest birds will
disappear before advancing civilization.
The truest part of birds is their wonderful love for their homes. My
birds are in and out of cages or aviaries most of the time but never fail to
return.
One tiny Orange Cheek came out with some branches while cleaning the
aviary. Nothing was seen of him for three weeks, but the other day the
poultry boy ran in and said : " That there little bird is back again and
fair blustering to get inside." There he surely was, peering all over for an
opening. I let him in and the joy of his song was unmistakable, while he
presented me with pieces of hay through the wires. When first put out
into the aviaries they will not leave the cages, and for long return to them
to sleep.
I think it is extremely bad taste for any one who sells birds, and is after all
only a small dealer (that is if he imports to sell), to run down those on a
larger scale. It looks so very much as if they wanted the monopoly, and to
charge their own prohibitive prices.
Looking back twenty years, when such names as Perreau, Alder son,
Whistler, Chawner, Lovell Reay, Peddie, Waddell, Otto Peek, and countless
others filled the pages of Bird Notes with inspirations and such a joyful
loving interest in our birds, these men were a bulwark to Aviculture--the
loveliest study in the world.

Mr. Webb's excellent article in last month's issue should stimulate the
Avicultural Society once and for all to make an effort and decide definitely
what its ultimate objects are, and what advantages it can offer to its members.
At the moment it can hardly be said to contribute much that is of value to
the science of ornithology, although, vaguely enough, it claims to exist for
the study of British and Foreign Birds in Captivity.
It is all very well to say that people keep birds purely for pleasure : there
is absolutely no doubt whatever that a time will come when this form of

After all, most things in life only become lastingly of interest when some
aim and object is kept in view.
There are more ornithological problems to be solved to-day, now that
ornithology is becoming a real science, than ever before, and much can be
learnt from watching living birds at close quarters and with intelligence,
that is of the utmost importance in building up the complete history of a
genus of species. For example, the observance of the movements or voice
of a particular bird in captivity can decide finally whether it shall rank
as distinct or not from some closely allied form. Much could be done to
solve the problem of the classification of the extraordinary little Finch-like
birds of the Galapagos Islands, could we but observe their habits in captivity.
Would our pleasure in keeping and breeding them be lessened by the fact
that we might be contributing something to science ?
Whether " aviculturists ", whatever they may be, heartily disapprove
of this point of view or not, it is at least to be hoped that they will give it
their open-minded and logical consideration.
(Signed) An Ornithologist.

I do not know if the following information will be of any use to you, but
have been advised to write to you in the hope that the information will be
of use in your records.
In an outdoor aviary at the above address, a pair of Golden-breasted
Waxbills have succeeded in raising three youngsters and a pair of African
Firefinches two youngsters.
Golden-breasted Waxbills. --The hen was bought in May and the cock
in June, 1934, and were awarded V.H.C. at the East Ham Bird Show in
January, 1935.
They selected a wooden box filled with hay in the open flight, made a
tunnel in the hay, and proceeded to cram it tight with feathers. The first
egg was laid on 16th May, 1935, but the first clutch of four was infertile. Their
second attempt was a failure, the birds being turned from the nest after two
eggs were laid, by a pair of Red-eared Waxbills. On 28tli June they started
again, and four eggs were laid (one each morning), the clutch of four being
completed on 1st July. The first two birds hatched on 12th July, the third
on the 13th, and the fourth on the 15th, the latter dying on 28th July. The
youngsters were jet black, with a little patch of white down on the top of the
beak, the inside of the mouth being pearl grey, black spotted ; their eyes
opened on 21st July and, feathering nicely, the remaining three flew on
1st August, one flying before completely losing its patch of baby down.
African Firefinches. --Hen bought in June, 1934, and the cock in Mav,
1935.
Nest built exactly the same as the Goldbreasts, but inside the shelter.
The first nest of four eggs, 7-10th June, was infertile. The second nest,
lst-4th July, also four eggs, was successful. The first hatched on 14th July,
two on the 15th, and one on the 16th : the latter died on the 20th. These
young were also black, with a little white spot on each side of beak, top
and bottom, a hen Avadavat assisting in the feeding of them. Three flew on

1st August, but one unfortunately got wedged behind a cage in the shelter
and died of starvation.

My pair of Avadavats hatched two, one dying at one day and the other
at eleven days. Their second nest was infertile.
These birds are fed on the stock millet mixture, with an armful of grass
seed, chickweed, etc., gathered fresh daily and strewn over the floor of the
aviary. I leave this to rot on the ground, and rake it over occasionally for
the birds to reach the insects breeding in it. They are also very keen on
grasshoppers, which I catch alive and turn loose into the aviary.
The shelter is about 4 by 4 feet, 7 feet high, sloping to 6 feet. The flight
is 6 by 4 feet, 6 feet high, and contains two pairs of Canaries, one pair of
Gold-breasts, one pair of Red-eared, one pair of Riielmcb.es, and one pair
of Avadavats.
Trusting the above may be of some value.

THE RED-AND-YELLOW MACAW
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.910892379310345" page_id="56222899"  page_num="265" year="" vol="">
Is there any good reason why Ara chloroptera should be termed the Red-
and-Yellow Macaw, as is done so often by writers ? Chloroptera means " green-
winged ", and there is no yellow in the colour scheme of this Macaw. Ara
macao has a large-tract of yellow on the wing, and is known as the Red-and-
Blue Macaw, though Lord Tavistock calls it the Red-and-Yellow Macaw in
his book. I should think this latter term would be more appropriate for
" macao ", while Red-and-Green Macaw would be more fitting for " chlorop-
tera ". The New York Zoological Society names it the " Green-winged
Macaw ", which is perhaps best of all.
In the April number Mr. Housden writes of the " Red-winged Tanager
I wonder which he refers to. I know all of the Tanagers in the United States,
and three of them have red wings, but they have red bodies also, and their
red tails are as noticeable as their red wings. These are the Summer (Pyranga
rubra rubra), Cooper's (P. r. cooperi), and the Hepatic (P. hepatica). He also
writes of them as " little " Tanagers, but as they are 7- |inches in length and
over, that term is hardly appropriate. He may refer to some bird entirely
different, but it has intrigued my interest.
Your Jubilee number deserves congratulations. It is beautifully prepared,
and the plates by Roland Green are superb, as always.

CORRECTION: INDIGO BUNTING X NONPARIEL HYBRIDS
In " More Additions to Breeding Records " (Avicultural Magazine,
1924, p. 312), there is a bad slip on my part, which in the interests of accuracy
I must correct.
I wrote : " a. Indigo Bunting X Canary." This should read : " Indigo
Bunting X Nonpariel," for this was the cross bred by Mr. Thomasset, which
was still alive in 1929.
The records of Indigo X Canary crosses are not too good.

(Anthreptes collaris elachior)
This lovely little bird is one of the smallest of the African Sunbirds,
its rivals in this respect being Cinnyris hyfasciatus microrhynchus and
Cinnyris minullus. It is classified in the genus Anthreptes, of which
Malaccensis is the type and with which it seems to have very little in
common beyond the fact that in both the lower mandible is almost
.straight. In its movements and song it approaches certain members
of the genus Cinnyris, and we consider it and its allies to form the link
between the Anthreptinae and the more typical and specialized Sun-
birds of the genera Cinnyris and Nectarinia. We feel that had Shelley
had an opportunity of observing the Collaris group closely while alive
he would have been content to keep them in a separate genus, Antho-
dieta.
The present sub-species was first imported by Mr. Webb from
Tanganyika in 1934 and the West African race Hypovila was intro-
duced by the same gentleman last spring. Elachior is smaller and
brighter than the other races, the yellow on the centre of the abdomen
being distinct from the paler shade of the flanks. The female only
differs from the male in the absence of a metallic throat and chest.
This little Sunbird is very fond of mealworms and other larvse,
which are said to form the greater portion of its natural diet. To the
south of its range it is replaced by the slightly larger Zambeziana.

By J. Delacour
It appears that the interest of British aviculturists for Pheasants
has lately been increasing, as the formation of an Ornamental
Pheasant Society has shown us. It is a cause of great satisfaction
to me ; many years ago now, when I was still a child, I already
was fascinated by these gorgeous birds. At the age of twelve, I was
keeping several pairs ; at twenty, I had almost as many species
represented in my aviaries as I have at present.
Pheasant keeping and breeding has long been very popular in France.
Besides a few large collections, we have a number of smaller ones, and
many amateurs rear every year a number of the less common species.
Many European public and private aviaries have been stocked by
them. There are also very good pheasantries in Italy, where
Professor A. Ghigi owns one of the finest in the world, in Belgium, and
in Germany. English aviculturists do not seem to have been so keen
on Pheasants : it is only a few years ago that they have turned their
attention to these fine birds. It is most gratifying to see that they
have changed for the better in this way.
Pheasant breeding is not only an interesting hobby--nearly all
species are pretty, long-lived, and easy to propagate ; many can be
acclimatized and naturalized as game birds, with proper care and
attention at the beginning, and prove of great practical value--but
it is also a duty to nature as these wonderful creatures, at least many
species, may not survive for long in a natural state. Their flesh and
feathers make them the target of hunters ; it is becoming easier every
day to penetrate into their wild haunts, and the natives are now
armed with more deadly weapons. Species which seem to-day to be
quite safe may become extinct within a few years, if conditions change
suddenly. Also, their natural habitat is reduced every year.
With the exception of members of the genus Phasianus, who live
in open country covered with grass and bushes, Pheasants are
forest-dwelling birds. Forests are being destroyed all over the world
with appalling rapidity, and with them all the animals and birds

which live in them. It is, therefore, very important that an adequate
stock of the different species of Pheasants should be acclimatized in
different countries and regularly propagated. Few birds take more
readily to artificial conditions of life, and it is absolutely certain that,
with very few exceptions, the different species of Pheasants can
be indefinitely preserved in captivity. We have proof of the accuracy
of this statement in the fact that several species are now common
in Europe, though no fresh blood has been imported for over
fifty years from their native country, where they have become scarce.
It has sometimes been alleged that the English climate is not
favourable to the breeding of Pheasants. It is quite wrong. Most
species live in wet, and often chilly, hill forests, and do quite well in
the somewhat damp parts of England and northern France. To the
few which require a drier and warmer climate, simple but effective
shelters can easily be supplied.
I am not going to give here information on the housing, feeding,
and breeding of Pheasants. But, as it has been my good fortune
to study many species in their natural haunts, as well as in captivity,
I should like to give our readers some idea of their comparative abun-
dance or rarity at liberty and in captivity, and to this end I am going
to review the different genera of the group.
If we consider the Blood-Pheasants ( Ithaginis ), we need only say
that, living at great altitudes, they have been very seldom imported,
and proved difficult to keep. But no particular effort has so far been
made to acclimatize them. They seem to be still numerous in their
natural habitats of Central Asia and China.
The five species of Tragopans are also birds of high mountains.
On account of the difficulty of reaching their homes in many parts,
they do not seem to be in any immediate danger of extinction, except
perhaps Cabot's Tragopan, in Eastern China. Latterly, Satyr and
Blyth's Tragopans have been imported and bred in some number
in France and in America. But Cabot's and Temminck's, common
twenty-five years ago, have now become very scarce, while Hasting's
is unobtainable, for some unknown reason, from its Western Himalayan
home. Although very hardy and ready to breed, Tragopans are not
so easy to propagate as many others, and need special care.

Of the three Monals (Lophophorus), one, the Himalayan, is commonly
imported and bred, while the two rarer species--Sclater's Monal from
Upper Burma and Yunnan, and L'Huys's from Western China, scarce
in the wild state and difficult to reach--have never been brought
over, except in a very few cases. It is hoped that the Chinese Monal,
the finest and rarest of the genus, may soon be imported into California.
It is said to have been much persecuted and shot, and to be threatened
with extinction.
The Brown Eared-Pheasant (Crossoptilon manchuricum ) is common
in captivity in Europe. But it has become scarce in N.E. China, where
forests have been terribly reduced in the last thirty years. It is
probable that it will soon become extinct at liberty. Fortunately,
the captive stock is amply sufficient to preserve its existence. It
breeds freely, although no fresh blood has been imported for a very
long time and is never likely to be now.
The Blue Eared-Pheasant ( C . auritum), from N.W. China, had never
been sent alive to Europe till a few years ago. But it had long been
bred in domesticity in its native country, on account of the value of
its tail-feathers. It is now as well established with us as the brown
species.
The White Eared-Pheasant ( C . crossoptilon) has very seldom been
seen in captivity. One pair is now in California and more are soon
expected to arrive. It is to be hoped that this lovely bird will soon
be established in aviaries as well as the other two. Its blue repre-
sentative [C. c. harmani) from Tibet has once been brought over
by Colonel Bailey, but never bred. It would also be a very interesting
acquisition. It may be said incidentally that it is not closely related
to C. auritum , in spite of their common blue-grey dress.
The Cheer (Catreus wallichi), from the Himalayas, is a curious if
not very pretty Pheasant. It has long been scarce in captivity, but,
during these last few years, it has been imported and bred in some
numbers in France and in Italy.
The Koklass ( Pucrasia ), although still numerous in some parts of
their mountainous haunts in the Himalayas and in China, have never
been common in captivity, nor properly established in Europe, although
many have been bred on several occasions. The Himalayan species

(P. macrolopha) has been lately imported and bred, but like the
Tragopans and other high mountain Pheasants, it requires much room
and special care. Some of the Chinese forms are now becoming rare
in their native country.
The Kalijs constitute the genus Gennceus, of which the well-known
Silver Pheasant is a member. It is a forest bird, still abundant in
S. China and Tonkin, and completely acclimatized in Europe. South
of its range, several local races are found, which grow darker and
darker as they draw nearer to the Equator ; Berlioz's and Bel's
Pheasants are among them; they are fairly well established in
Europe now.
The Annamese Pheasant (G. annamensis), from the southern hills
of Indo-China, has never been imported, but the still darker and very
handsome Lewis's Pheasant (Gennceus lewisi) was discovered and
imported by myself from the mountains of S. Cambodia. It bred
once at Cleres, but only cocks now remain. I hope to get a new con-
signment soon, but it is not a common species, and its home is one of
the wildest spots in the world. All the above Kalij's have red legs.
Further west we find the grey-legged forms. The Lineated Kalij,
of Siam and Burma, of which several races exist, has long been
extinct in European aviaries, where hybrids between Black-crested, or
Ilorsfield's, and Silver Pheasants have too often been mistaken
for it. It is not rare at liberty, and quite pretty with its very fine
vermiculations, giving its upper parts a silvery grey appearance.
Horsfield's Kali], from Assam and Upper Burma, is common at
liberty and also rather so in captivity, as well as the other black Kalijs
from the Himalayas---Black-backed, Black-crested, and the prettier
White-crested. All are very hardy and easy to breed and, I think,
quite attractive, if not brightly coloured; they deserve more
popularity than they have now. The curious Silver Pheasant of
Hainan (G. whiteheadi) has never been imported, and seems to be rare
in its island habitat. The different black Kalij would make most
interesting game-birds in our woods.
The beautiful Pheasants of the genus Hierophasis have a much
shorter crest than the Kalijs and the main colour of the cocks is a fine
dark blue. Swinhoe's Pheasant, from Formosa, is abundant in

captivity and probably still common at liberty. No new blood has
been imported for many years. Edwards' Pheasant, from the damp
coast of Annam, is rare in captivity and at liberty, but it seems to be
pretty well established now in Europe, to where I brought the first
specimens in 1924. A little to the north lives the rarest member of
the whole family, the Imperial Pheasant, which I had the luck of
discovering. Only a very few wild specimens have been found. The
original pair was brought over to France and bred successfully, so
that we may hope that the species will be acclimatized and kept up
in captivity.
The Firebacks belong to three different genera. The Siamese
Fireback (. Diardigallus diardi) lives in that country, but is also very
common and widespread in Indo-China. Although some pairs breed
well in captivity, others give poor results, and while it is fairly well
established in Europe, it still remains one of the rarer species. The
same thing can be said of the different Crested ( Lophura ) and Crestless
(Houppifer = Acomus) Firebacks of the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, and
Borneo. The only exception is the very rare Sumatran H. inornatus,
one female of which is now living in Dr. Chigi's collection.
The wonderful Wattled Pheasant ( Lobiophasis bulweri), from
Borneo, one of the marvels of nature, has been brought over on a few
occasions but so far has never bred in captivity. It does not seem
to be very rare in its native island. Some pairs are expected to
arrive shortly.
The Junglefowls ( Gallus ) of the four species--Red, Sonnerat's,
Lafayette's, and Green Javan--are all numerous at liberty. They
breed well in Europe, the first named being naturalized in a few places
in England and in France. The remaining three are rather rare in
captivity, but all represented in collections at the present time.
The very numerous forms of the common Pheasants, which are found
from the Caucasus to Formosa and Japan, although still very abundant,
have, in my opinion, a very uncertain future. Every year they are
more and more persecuted and shot, and I know of many districts
whence they have now disappeared. They established themselves
readily in Europe and in America but, unfortunately, they have been
crossed more or less together so that our covert Pheasant is nothing

but a mongrel. The appearance of such an interesting mutation as
the " Melanistic Mutant " may be recalled. It would be of very great
importance to establish and propagate, in a pure state, such fine
races as the Mongolian, the Corean, the Chinese Bingneck, the Formosan,
the Versicolor (or Japanese Green), the Prince of Wales's Pheasants,
and indeed all the well-marked geographical forms.
The Long-tailed Pheasants of the genus Syrmaticus are very
attractive. They probably ought to be classified in different genera,
as their hybrids are mostly infertile, at least the hens.
Peeves' Pheasant, one of the finest of all, is getting rare in many
of its former strongholds in China, and has not been imported for
a long time. It is, however, quite well established in France, as much
at liberty as in aviaries, and there need be no fear for its future. The
different Japanese Copper Pheasants (scintillans , soemmerringii, and
ijimce), still fairly numerous in Japan, remain rare in our pheasantries,
although they often breed easily. But they are of extremely pugnacious
habits, and it is often difficult to pair them up without accidents.
Elliot's Pheasant is said to have become scarce in Eastern China,
although a few specimens are brought over now and then. But it is
fairly well established in captivity, especially in France.
The Mikado Pheasant, from Formosa, very fine in its dark blue
and white dress, has always been very rare. I keep a good stock of
these birds and breed some every year, but they are not very prolific.
Golden and Amherst's Pheasants, whose indescribable beauty is
well known to all, are still common in their native Chinese haunts as
well as in captivity. No wild Amherst's had been imported for over
sixty years when I brought some from Yunnan in 1930 ; it was most
useful, as nearly all European bred specimens have traces of Golden
blood.
The Bronze-tail ( Chalcurus ) is a member of the Peacock-Pheasant
group (Polyplectrons) but its voice and display recall those of the
Golden Pheasant, and it forms a transition between them. Not bright,
but pretty and small, it is scarce, or at least difficult to find, in the
mountain forests of Sumatra. It was only imported a few years ago,
but I found it easy to breed and prolific. It ought to establish itself
well in Europe. It still is a very uncommon bird. Its Malay

relatives are much rarer still ( C. inopinatus), and have never been
brought alive.
Of the true Peacock-Pheasants, all but two (P. schleiermacJceri, from
Borneo, and P. Jcatsumatce, from Hainan) are represented in my collec-
tion. Two, the Chinquis, or Gray, and Germain's, from the Himalayas
and from Cochin-China, are not uncommon and rather well established
in captivity. The Malay (P. malaccensis) remains very rare and has
seldom bred, while the lovely Palawan, or Napoleon's, seems to have
been successfully acclimatized in California ; it has bred with me for
the last two years.
The wonderful Ocellated Argus ( Rheinartia ) of Annam is still rather
common in the deep damp forests of Central Annam. It is difficult to
bring over and to acclimatize, but once it has got over the first few
months it proves hardy in Normandy. I have now several pairs,
and a few young are reared every year. The Malay race (P. o. nigrescens)
seems to be much scarcer.
Both forms of Argus are plentiful in the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra,
and Borneo, where no danger of extinction seems to threaten them.
Although they live and breed well enough, if given some slight heat
during the winter, they never seem to become properly established
with us and we still depend on imported birds.
To end this survey of the Pheasants, we shall say that the Common
Peafowl, completely acclimatized in Europe, 1 is very abundant in
India, where it is protected. The fine Burmese, or Spicifer, is holding
its own in Burma, Siam, Indo-China, and Java, in spite of much
persecution. But it seems never to have become well established

(Psittacula calthmpce)
By Mrs. Darnton
The Bayard is by no means a brilliantly coloured Parrakeet, but
the lavender blue head and shoulders, blue rump and violet central
tail-feathers, set off by a bright coral beak, make the cock a very
attractive bird, the body and wings being a bright rich green.
The hen is more soberly garbed, her beak being black, and green
predominating, except on her rump and tail, which are like the cock's.
Layards are peculiar to Ceylon, but even there they are by no means
a common bird, keeping to the hill country and being very local.
I first made their acquaintance in the wild state while I was on a
three months' trip to Ceylon during the winter of 1934, as I often used
to watch a small flock of eight or ten birds in the neighbourhood of
Kandy. These were nesting in various trees within a short distance
of each other, all at varying heights, one pair having a nest in a hollow
branch only about 12 feet from the ground, while another pair
had young in a hole at least 60 feet up, the tree it was in being abso-
lutely straight, with a smooth grey trunk completely devoid of branches
except at the very top, the Bayard's nest being a few feet below the
first branch. With a strong pair of field glasses I could plainly see
the young birds, evidently nearly ready to fly, craning their little heads
out of the hole to be fed by their mother. Suitable nesting accom-
modation was evidently at a premium in that district, as on several
occasions I watched the parents driving off other house-hunting
Layards, and once even a&apos; pair of Ceylon Alexandrines were uncere-
moniously given their conge.
The pair which have successfully reared two very fine young in
my aviaries this summer were bought from natives who had hand-
reared them and kept them for pets. The hen I discovered in the
fruit market in Kandy, hanging in a particularly small and dirty wire
cage, with a messy little dish of curry on its floor and a piece of banana

pushed through the bars. On asking to see her more closely, she was
immediately hauled out of her cage by her delighted owner, who with
pride placed her on his shoulder, saying, " See Missy, how tame she is ! "
On pulling her wings out (getting a nasty little bite in the process),
I found the reason for at least some of her tameness--all her flight
feathers had been cut off short ! After the usual bargaining I bought
her, and a very demure and charming little bird she proved to be, for
after the first few days she would let me handle and pet her without
attempting to use her beak.
The cock, a particularly large bird, in immature plumage, we bought
a few days later from a villager near the Kandyan pass. They both
travelled home successfully : Jane, the hen, spending last summer
in a cage waiting for her wing feathers to grow.
In the autumn, when she was once more able to fly, she was turned
into a large bird-room, with her future mate and some young Plum-
heads. During last winter the cock came into full adult plumage
and a very fine bird he turned out to be. Towards the middle of last
April both Layards were put into their breeding quarters---a large
aviary with a flight 30 feet long by 4 feet wide--but the weather
was so cold that, although they were both very interested in their
nest-box--of the " grandfather clock " type--the hen did not lay
until about 20th May. She had three eggs, white of course, and large
for the size of the bird. She sat very steadily and hatched two young,
which I took a peep at when they were a few days old. Even for
baby Parrakeets they struck me as being particularly ugly and mis-
shapen, and they were quite naked.
By the 6th of July they were beginning to show green at the end
of their quills, and as Jane seemed to have no objection to my looking
at them, I used to peer into their box every few days. They were
quite extraordinarily steady, cocking their heads and gazing at me
quite fearlessly, and never attempting to make the hysterical noises
that most young Parrakeets think it their duty to terrify one with,
when they see that they are being inspected. The weather was now
tropically hot, and Jane spent most of the day sitting dozing at the
entrance hole of the box, no doubt making life below extremely stuffy
and airless for her young offspring. Nevertheless, they seemed to

thrive on it, as one evening I saw two little heads peering out at the
world.
For several days they spent most of their time taking stock of
their new surroundings, then, on the morning of 29th July, two very
self-possessed young Layards were perched side by side on a branch,
both looking completely smug and nonchalant. Excepting for their
blue rumps they were green all over, with bright coral beaks. They
were both very strong on the wing and did their father and mother great
credit. While they were in the nest the parents had been fed on their
usual millet and canary mixture, sunflower ad lib., a teaspoonful of
hemp twice a day, apple, and a little green chickweed. They are now,

POLLY--MY AMAZON
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98680815" page_id="56222917"  page_num="277" year="" vol="">
By the Countess op Essex
Polly is a Blue-fronted Amazon (A. cestina) but quite the smallest
I have ever seen. I answered an advert, in a paper--someone wished
to sell a Parrot. I liked the description and thus became the owner
of Polly. I was very disappointed with her appearance when she
arrived. She was thin, her plumage ragged, and she smelt like a mouse
--or rather a dozen mice. (Of course, she is a very different looking
bird now.) As I unwrapped her cage I heard mutterings, " What do
you want--what do you want," but when she actually came in view
she was silent.
I spoke to her, offered her grapes, which she took from my hand,
then still talking to her put my hand in her cage--rather nervously
I must confess. To my surprise she got on to it at once and since
then we have been the greatest of friends. To me personally, Polly is
the most loving and gentle bird I have ever owned. She is not so with
other people. My butler, who is devoted to all the pets, had a terrible
reproof from Polly. Meeting her walking upstairs (she is nearly always
loose) he put his hand down for her to get on to, as he had seen me
do hundreds of times. She got on to it and let him carry her half-way
upstairs when (as he describes it) " she stared very hard at me and

the next second she made her beak meet through my finger Polly
has not been offered many " helping hands " since !
During the summer Polly is loose in the garden for many hours,
generally remaining in some fruit trees near the house. If anything
startles her she flies round for a bit. One terrible day she flew to the
tops of the tallest elms and seemed to be too nervous to come down
again. She never went off the place, but remained out for four days
in spite of my frantic efforts to attract her down. She answered all
my calls and sometimes flew round and round in circles high above
my head, but still lacked the nerve to descend. It was heart-breaking
to see her little yellow face peering down, anxiously wondering why
I did not fetch her home. At long last she did come down to a smaller
tree, and by climbing we got her. Then her joy was intense--she sang,
kissed me, and was almost too excited to eat. During the time she
was out she could have eaten nothing but the tree leaves, etc., and
through glasses I watched her licking dew off the leaves as, of course,
she had no water. However, it taught her a lesson. Now if she flies
off for a few hours she comes down at the front door and shrieks until
she is fetched in.
She is extremely jealous of me : she will shriek and scream if I pick
up a puppy, etc., and if I do not leave it and go to her, she will fly
across all ready for an attack. Strangers she hates and will shriek
and rave until I take her on my shoulder--then she will settle down
quietly. In fact I am her only lover, and she is very faithful. (Secretly
I feel very proud of being the only person in the household who can
handle Polly !) I can do anything I like with her : tickle her, roll
her on her back, pick her up anyhow --nothing annoys her if / do it.
When I first owned Polly I was worried about her health and generally
disreputable appearance, so I wrote to Lord Tavistock and asked his
advice. He very kindly wrote me a most helpful letter, and cheered
me enormously by saying healthy Parrots were nearly always jealous,
in fact jealousy was an excellent sign, so I felt my Polly had a very good
chance of surviving. Her stable food is a mixture of canary, hemp,
millet with a dash of Spratt's Parrot food in it. Pea-nuts are always
with her, she does not much care for any others. Her favourite fruits
vary ; at the moment cherries are first favourites, but grapes are always

eaten. I try to give her as much change as possible. Peas in the
pod (much appreciated), raw carrots, bananas, and very sweet oranges
are all popular, but apples she does not care for. However, she likes
all fruit in turn except strawberries and raspberries--she will not
touch these. When in a festive mood Polly sings softly to herself,
spreading out her beautiful striped tail, while her eyes light up as if
she had a flash-lamp inside her head.
Polly has two cages, one downstairs and one up (for night). When
I say " Come to bed, Polly ", she is ready to go at once and gets on
my hand or shoulder, singing one of her little songs. They are " songs
without words " but very sweet for all that. When I begin to cover
her cage for the night she starts screaming exactly like a very small
baby and continues until the cover is right on. By the way, no cover
lasts long with Polly, she soon picks holes in it. If I speak to her
in the night a glittering eye appears at one of the many holes, and if
I put my finger in the cage she rubs her dear little head against it.
I don't think I have mentioned Polly's musical tastes : she adores
the wireless, not " news " or " talks " but bands and songs. She
generally joins in these last, no words of course, but she has really
an excellent ear and, anyway, enjoys her own performances immensely.
When flying loose in the garden, if frightened or wanting me,
Polly utters a peculiarly weird cry which I can only attempt to describe
as " Baaick, baaick--Baaick, baaick ". It is surprising how far she
can be heard, but her vocabulary is rather limited !
Sometimes on a winter evening she will climb on my knee or
shoulder and go to sleep literally. However, I always notice, if I do
the same, I wake to hear a tearing sound and realize I shall have to
pay for yet another library book !
She occasionally feels it her duty to preen my hair, all the time
giving sharp little " Ohs ! " and " Ahs ! ", I suppose to save me the
trouble, when she pulls it !
I must mention one of Polly's most amusing adventures. One day
she flew over the garden wall into the village, where the sound of her
voice is well known. Funnily enough, she went straight to the " Rose
and Crown " (public-house), where she seated herself on the doorstep.
No one dared touch her so I was sent for. When I arrived I found

poor Polly surrounded by a large crowd, gazing anxiously through the
bars of a hen coop which someone had dropped over her, and repeating
loudly, " What do you want ? What do you want ? 55 She was very
pleased indeed to scramble on my shoulder and turn her back on public
life !
To me there is something peculiarly fascinating in a really tame
bird, so tame that it is really a member of the household. Of course,
one's furniture occasionally shows " the mark of the beak ", but who
cares when one has " Polly " to welcome one !

The list of Duck Hybrids given on p. 78 of this year's Magazine
having at least interested a few, and provided me with some additions
and other facts of interest, I venture to supplement it with a Summary
of the Records to date in the hope of interesting others and producing
more information in the way of additions or corrections.
The relative values of the Records are roughly indicated by the
use of different types. Capitals mean that as far as the Records go,
the species (or hybrid) has certainly been bred and that no further
record is needed ; for those shown in ordinary type more detail is
wanted, while enclosure in parentheses indicates doubt and the
addition of a (?) more doubt.
The numbers are those of Records, 1926.

By Capt. R. Waud
The breeding of the birds at Bradley this year has been most
disappointing. I had great hopes of breeding Demoiselle Cranes : one
pair laid two eggs, but unfortunately, as last year, they were both
unfertile. It is very distressing: they lay every year, but the eggs
are always clear, although I have four birds and I feel sure there is
a true pair. My pair of Crown Crested Cranes made a very good nest
of twigs and straw and laid four eggs this year. I had great hopes of
them, as both birds have taken it in turn to incubate. The cock, sits
all day and the hen sits all night ; but, alas, all the eggs are unfertile !

They are still very keen on sitting on them, and have been doing so
now for over six weeks. When the birds begin to think of nesting
they get very savage, and one has to be careful when going into their
paddock, as the cock goes for one at once. During the non-breeding
season a grey-necked Crown Crane lives with them, but they fight
him so badly when they wish to nest that I have to remove him to
the wallaby paddock, and he lives there in comfort with them.
The Ducks: I have only reared one Mandarin, now full grown and
full winged : it is a great joy to see it flying round and returning to the
pond. All the Carolina eggs were clear. Of the Falcated I have only
reared three young ones : these I had to pinion, as they never stay
when full winged. No other Ducks laid this year ; I put it down to
the very severe frosts and cold we had in the late spring and then the
intensely hot, dry weather after it.
The aviary birds were also unsuccessful. One pair of Gouldians
had four nests : they began very early in the spring, but only one
young one has been reared. I must say I think they are old birds, as
I have had them some years and I fancy they were not very young
when I bought them. The Bichenos have spent much time building,
but with no results. The Ruficaudas have had two nests : the first
nest had two good young ones and the second nest had three : all are
flying now in the aviary. The Jungle Fowls Mr. Ezra very kindly gave
me have been delightful about the place. The two hens nested and
had five chicks with one hen and seven chicks with the other ; but
unfortunately, as soon as the chicks were hatched, they took them off
into the woods, and I fear all the chicks were killed by foxes, which
abound round here. Lately the Jungle Fowls have lived in the
woods, I expect finding plenty of food there, but I hope later on
they will return to the garden again where they are fed.
The most delightful birds I keep in the house, the chief one being
an Indian Sprosser Mr. Ezra kindly gave me some years ago. He is a
magnificent songster, and begins to sing quite early in the winter.
Many people think the song too loud, but I personally love it. He is
perfectly tame, and takes anything out of my hand ; also resents
my taking out his perches to clean and soak in cold water ; he flies
on to my hand and then begins to fight it.

Another delightful house bird is a Troupialhe flies about every-
where and goes off into the garden, returning to his cage when he
wishes. When I go into the park to catch grasshoppers he will always
come with me, although I do not catch them for him but the other
birds ; all the same he thoroughly enjoys it, and helps himself very
freely to them.
I fear these few notes are not very encouraging to aviculturists.
All the same, I think if one has an achievement it pays well for all
the disappointments.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9503773" page_id="56222928"  page_num="288" year="" vol="">
(Urocissa caerulea)
The fine Magpies of the genus Urocissa are found in the mountainous
regions of Northern India, Burma, China, and Indo-China, and are
represented in Formosa by the largest and most handsome species.
While all the continental forms have brown eyes and white under
parts, the Formosan Blue Magpie has pale yellow irides and a blue
belly, which are a decided improvement on the general pattern of
colours of these lovely birds. Perhaps, however, its tail is not quite
so long and so gracefully curved and wavy as that of its smaller
relatives. Like all the Urocissa the Formosan Blue Magpies live in
woods and in open country &apos;well intermixed wdth trees and bushes,
where they go in small parties, hunting for large insects, small verte-
brates, and fruit on which they feed. They are numerous in camphor
forests on the mountains, flying from tree to tree. They are shy and
difficult to approach. A few specimens of these fine birds have been
imported alive into Japan from time to time, but none, so far, had
reached Europe. Owing to the kindness of Prince Taka-Tsukasa,
a pair at last arrived in England last January, and I am most grateful
to him for this handsome present.

THE PARROT BAN
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999438020833333" page_id="56222933"  page_num="289" year="" vol="">
I personally welcome both Mr. Porter's and Mr. Webb's articles and
also the correspondence (or rather some of the correspondence) which
their publication has caused. Undoubtedly the former free importation
of Parrots did create much cruelty and suffering, and the dealers only have
themselves to blame for the ban. Doubtless this will, in course of time, be
modified, but I cannot conceive how any person who really has the interests
of birds at heart can desire a return to the old conditions. Even now the
supplies of Parrots are far from being cut off, for besides the birds imported
with licences, there can be little doubt that a good many are still coming
in without them.
But I think Mr. Webb's article is of more pressing importance to Avicul-
turists, although I do not agree entirely with all he says. As I have been
in the habit of going the round of the London bird shops with some regularity,
perhaps my experiences may be of interest to a few members.
I am convinced that so long as birds are imported in comparatively
small numbers to be sold retail by the dealers, there is little or no cruelty.
The birds usually arrive in good condition and are quickly disposed of, to
what one imagines are good homes. The trouble arises almost entirely, in
my opinion, when the birds are imported in very large numbers for selling
wholesale. Again, the birds usually arrive in fair condition but owing to
the large numbers are overcrowded in the dealers' cages. This results in the
birds never having a chance to settle down, what with continual catching
operations, and because of the large numbers a good many are not sold very
quickly. They remain in the shops until inevitably disease sets in and
many birds perish miserably.
Sometimes this is due to ignorance or cupidity on the part of the dealers,
but obviously it is not always their fault. If one dealer imports in large
numbers to sell cheaply, others must follow his example or go out of business.
It is extremely difficult to know what the Society, as representative ofj all
that is best in British Aviculture, can do in the matter.
Mr. Sweetnam's suggestions are, I think, very helpful and form afuseful
basis for discussion. I am, however, of the opinion that at present we can
place but little reliance on home-bred stocks of birds. Although a great
number are bred annually, the number of really capable breeders whose
aviary bred stock is worth breeding from again is extremely limited. Certainly
everything should be done to encourage better and more useful breeding,
but I do not think that the science of Aviculture has yet reached that stage
where home breeding can be regarded as at all efficacious.
I am afraid that for the Society to import birds for members would be of
little use in improving the bird trade, unless done on a very large scale,
which it cannot afford to do. A few members might be able to obtain birds
cheaply that they had not hitherto possessed, but such an operation would
have no effect on the bird trade as a whole.
What I should like to see would be an amplification of Mr. Sweetnam's
second suggestion. I think that it would be an excellent idea if the Society
were to grant a Certificate, which would always be open to cancellation, to
those dealers from whom members could buy birds without the suspicion
that they had occasioned cruelty in so doing. Only holders of the Certificate

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.956829782608695" page_id="56222934"  page_num="290" year="" vol="">
Correspondence
would be allowed to advertise in the Magazine, and a list of Certificate holders
could be published in each number. This would, I think, be of mutual benefit
both to members and dealers. Should this be done, and should members
loyally support those dealers (always provided that the latter do not use the
granting of a Certificate to charge exorbitant prices), it is at least possible
that the other dealers would have to fall into line and improve their methods
of importation. But what I am convinced is of far greater importance,
the Society would have taken some action to attempt to improve the standards
of the bird trade, of its own free will. Whatever the outcome, it would be
a worthy attempt and one which would do much to raise the Society's prestige
and importance.
I am certain that some scheme on the lines suggested above would be
perfectly feasible. Now that the whole question of the importation of birds
has been raised, I sincerely hope that the matter will not be shelved by the
responsible anthorities, for it is a question that must be raised sooner or
later and which will become increasingly difficult as time goes on.
As for Mrs. Jackson's letters, I think the less said the better.
I am sure that every thoughtful person will agree that Mr. Webb deserves
not to be condemned for a breach of good taste, but rather to be congratulated
for his courage in broaching a very thorny question, but one which must
always be of supreme importance to the whole practice of Aviculture.

HUMANE AVICULTURE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99821684" page_id="56222934"  page_num="290" year="" vol="">
I am thoroughly in sympathy with Mr. Webb's article. The pity of it
is that it did not appear long ago. I welcome a league on the lines which
Preb. Sweetnam suggests. No aviculturist who is worthy of the name would
object to paying a reasonable price (I mean an increased price) for birds,
if they were caught and imported by real naturalists and bird lovers, preferably
private individuals. There is also, I know, a wide field open to someone of
this sort who will open a shop on the best lines and supply healthy birds,
kept under ideal conditions, but at reasonable prices. I mean prices which,
while naturally in advance in some cases of those charged under the old
conditions, are yet not absurdly prohibitive as is so often the case with regard
to " Bird Farms " and semi-private individuals at present. Quite recently
I was offered at a bird shop in town (of this sort) a pair of Redbill Weavers
at 155. 6 d .--nearly twice their value, even for healthy and acclimatized birds.
I was also offered a Parrakeet nest-box for 25s. (A carpenter examined it
and assured me that he could have put it together in a day, for about 5s.)
However, all this by the way. It will have to come in in connection with
reorganized Aviculture. I suggest that we band together and choose our own
representatives who shall, as far as possible, do the catching and importing,
selling chiefly to private individuals and only to reputable dealers. ( I know
one or two such as He Von, who really seem to love and understand their
birds.) Also that we boycott and report to the R.S.P.C.A. any dealer or
other person who transgresses against the humane principles which should
be common to all Aviculturists.

in the scientific side of our hobby, do not want to make our Journal largely
unintelligible or of lessened interest to the ordinary bird keeper. I suggest,
too, that many ornithologists like entomologists can hardly throw stones at
ordinary bird keepers, when we consider the vast number of specimens
sacrificed and clutches of eggs seized to form a series, etc. I dissent from
your lady correspondent on different grounds. Her letter, I am afraid, will
do just what she accuses us of doing, since her whole attitude is that of
a certain section who refuse to face facts and because they have a few
birds which are happy and return home if escaped, argue that all captive
birds are ideally kept and will do likewise ; the fallacy of which must
be plain to anyone who does not shut their eyes to what exists. Her innuendos
as regards Mr. Webb are in very bad taste, and her suggestion that isolated
individuals should remonstrate with offending dealers is, I am afraid, quite
futile.

IMPROPER IMPORTATION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99364737037037" page_id="56222935"  page_num="291" year="" vol="">
I think it is certainly true that members of the Avicultural Society need
to give far more thought to the problem of devising means whereby the birds
they obtain for their collections receive humane treatment from the time they
are first caught. Even in quarters where they should not occur, there seem
to be far too much culpable ignorance and carelessness, and until certain
people mend their ways there is not the slightest reason to hope for the
modification of the Parrot ban. Last year, owing in part to an official
blunder, a large dealer and a person in a smaller way of business who is
more dealer than true aviculturist, imported under the usual filthy conditions
a large number of diseased psittacine birds from Australia. I had the mis-
fortune to have some valuable birds, properly packed, on the same boat,
which caught the infection from the dealers' birds and died, and caused some
inquiries by the Ministry of Health. I heard on very good authority that
the pseudo-aviculturist sold large numbers of his diseased stock in spite
of the fact that it is illegal to sell Parrot-like birds imported on a permit.
I hoped this would be the end of trouble of this kind, but a few months
ago a hen Rock Grass Parrakeet that I greatly needed died on the voyage,
although properly packed, and the Ministry of Health who made the post
mortem informed me that it was psittacosis and &quot; several other Parrots " had
died on the same boat. The " several other parrots " were presumably
imported by people other than the offenders of the previous year, and I feel
very strongly that they might have had both the humanity and the ordinary
gumption to see that their birds were sent over under decent conditions ;
for one thing is quite certain, and that is that you do not get outbreaks of
infectious enteritis, alias psittacosis, unless birds are overcrowded in dirty
travelling boxes.

WAXBILLS IN SUMMER

I want to broadcast what is an S 0 S and make a plea for the ending of
an abuse. From May till September vast numbers of " Senegals " are offered
as we know at prices as low as 2s. 6 d. a pair, for some of the commoner species.
I have bought many, but again and again, in spite of spray millet, insect
food, oiled seed, and boiled water (not necessarily all these remedies at the
same time), I find the death-rate appalling. Indoors and outdoors it is just
the same. I give flowering grass, etc., but all to no purpose. I find that all
the Waxbills, most Nuns, and quite a lot of Zebras (the latter, of course,
aviary bred) are the victims ; Orange Bishops and other Weavers being
usually as " hard as nails ".
In some cases the trouble seems to spread to acclimatized birds and
British Finches, and even Java Sparrows, again Weavers being immune.
The birds almost always arrive looking splendid, and at the worst wanting
a few feathers ; symptoms, a gradual puffiness, first very slight (herein
the danger), frequently great hunger, and death in from two days to a week
or even longer. There is generally some sign of scour, but in many cases very
little. Last year I sent one or two victims up to an expert and was informed
that it was pneumonia, but I keep all draughts away as far as possible.
The autumn and spring bought birds do fairly well, even if just over.
I wish to ask, is my experience common to most people and if so has
anyone found a cure ? If it is common and no cure is forthcoming, then
I say re my other letter, let us all draw up a circular letter signed by us as
a body and send it to all the dealers, saying that we will not buy any of these
little birds--say, from 31st May to 1st September, and let us do all we can
to stop their importation at this season. It is heartrending that it should
continue under these circumstances.
P. K. Venner.

REPORTED MANNIKIN X CANARY HYBRIDS

<bodyText confidence="0.933069722222222" page_id="56222936"  page_num="292" year="" vol="">
During the summer the rearing of two Tricolour Mannikin X Canary hybrids
was reported. The breeder was confident that the cross was as stated and
he said he had two youngsters from one nest flying and another in another
nest by the same father paired with a different Canary.
I was fortunate in being able to get into touch with the breeder, Mr. Allen,
of Eastbourne, who invited me to come and see the birds. I saw the youngsters
first, then nine weeks old and caged separately. At first glance it was obvious
there was no Mannikin in their parentage ; they looked like Linnet or perhaps
Redpoll mules. The owner then brought down the parents. The father
was an Alario Finch, not the Mannikin its owner thought it was. He is
a novice with foreign birds and had based his belief on a small plate showing
various Mannikins which he had seen. It was a great disappointment for
him to learn the true parentage, but I have his permission to publish this,
in order to prevent another record of a Weaver X Finch cross (which is sc
far unknown) being left uncontradicted.
Alario-Canary hybrids have been quite commonly obtained, especially
in South Africa.

ZEBRA WAXBILL x CORDON BLEU HYBRIDS
In August I saw two hybrids of this cross, which had been bred in a garden
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.991630064516129" page_id="56222937"  page_num="293" year="" vol="">
aviary in 1934.
The breeders, Messrs. Piears nad James, of Beckenham, have given me the
details of the event. The young were hatched on 1st August, 1934, and two
young left the nest on the 18th ; they were then mouse-coloured and showed
a lot of whitish down. The parents took the young back to the nest every
night for more than a week. The aviary was planted with bushes and the
parents probably found some insects, but as food, only seed and a " biscuit
food " was supplied. The " Goldbreast " cock seemed to sit on the eggs all
day and the hen Cordon to be on duty at night. When anyone entered the
aviary when the young were in the nest the parents seemed agitated and
angry. The young showed no great change of colour till they were about six
months old.
When I saw them they were a year old : --larger birds than the father, and
about the same size as the Cordon, though not so slim in body. Looking at
them from a distance no one could have guessed their parentage ; the general
colour above is a brownish shade like that of the Zebra Waxbill, while below
they are yellow (chamois-yellow colour, not gamboge or orange) over the
belly and lower breast, while across the latter runs a definite bar of brownish
which sharply borders the yellow belly. On examination in the hand one
finds that each bird has a crimson eye-streak over the front of the eye like
that of the father, and that one has a suggestion of the Cordon Bleu's pink
cheek-spot. No blue anywhere.
The parents had other clutches of eggs in 1934, and more in 1935, but none
had hatched.
Soon after I saw them one unfortunately died, but its skin went to the
Natural History Museum ; the other is still thriving.
This success is particularly worth record, not only because it is the first of
this cross (as far as I know) anywhere but because the young have lived a year,
so very different to what, I am afraid, is usually the case with captive-bred
birds.

OBITUARY
NORAH, LADY DUNLEATH
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99797" page_id="56222938"  page_num="294" year="" vol="">
I am sure members of the Avicultural Society will be extremely
sorry to learn of the death of Norah, Lady Dunleath, which took place
somewhat suddenly at Newbury Hospital, after a very serious operation.
Lady Dunleath was a vice-president of the Society and had been for
some years. She lived in Northern Ireland and was very keen on
the keeping of birds. She had several aviaries with excellently thought
out shelters, and always had the flights beautifully kept with shrubs
and grass growing inside. She kept a good collection of Pheasants
and various small foreign birds ; also had a certain amount of Ducks
and Geese, which interested her greatly. Screamers she had at liberty
in the grounds, which were very tame and looked most attractive.
I am sure the members of the Avicultural Society will desire to express
their sympathy to her family. She will be greatly missed, as one
doesn't often meet with a woman who had such kindness of heart,
consideration for others, and strong personality ; and the world is
indeed poorer by her loss.

STARLING

<bodyText confidence="0.956833095238095" page_id="56222943"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
By Maurice Amsler, M.B., F.Z.S.
When the late Gerard Gurney's collection of birds was offered
for sale, I decided that I must have some memento of that very keen
aviculturist. His favourites were, I think, birds of prey, Crows, and
Starlings. I have not accommodation for the first two and so decided
to buy a pair of Amethyst Starlings which eventually arrived here
in the spring of 1934. They were a lovely couple and seemed none
the worse in health or spirits for the change to my small aviaries from
the sumptuous enclosures at Keswick. Beyond looking into a nest-
box the moment they were liberated from their travelling box they
made no attempt to breed that spring or summer. Sometime in
August the cock, who had looked off-colour for a few days, was picked
up dead and very much emaciated.
The hen wintered out in an unheated aviary and always looks
perfectly fit ; these birds are a good deal hardier than is usually thought,
and Monsieur Decoux, in a recent letter to me, expressed his surprise
at the hardiness of this species.
During the past winter I advertised two or three times, without
success, for an acclimatized cock, and in the end I wrote to our President,
Mr. A. Ezra, who is always ready to help lame dogs over stiles. He
very kindly let me have an odd cock and a perfect specimen he was.

296 Maurice Amsler--The Breeding of the Amethyst Starling
When showing anyone my birds I always especially point out the
cock Amethyst and he invariably evokes cries of admiration from
visitors.
It so happens that his favourite perch is between the onlooker and
the sun during the afternoon, and he much prefers to display his white
chest--which is not what one wants--but with his back towards me
I have often and often noted the most wonderful iridescence from black
through brown to the most wonderful amethyst, and finally, occasion-
ally, a shade which I can only describe as white--a reflection,
I suppose, of the whole spectrum.
These birds are, in my experience, quite inoffensive though I have
not kept them with other insectivorous species.
Towards small Doves, Quail, and even the smaller Finches they
are absolutely harmless, even when feeding young.
Although the male arrived in March there was no sign of nesting
until 18th July. Both birds were always quite friendly and the male
usually uttered a little warbling song whenever his mate approached
his perch. On the above date the hen was noticed to be carrying leaves
which had fallen into the aviary from an overhanging willow tree.
The site she had chosen was a Berlepsch Starling log made from silver
birch, the entrance hole of which I had enlarged. It was quite 14 inches
deep and the hen, of course, disappeared each time she took in her leaves.
When reappearing she always sat peering out of the entrance hole for
some seconds before flying out--a precautionary measure, no doubt,
to make sure she was not being watched. This she continued to do
much later when she was feeding her young and the cock did
the same thing.
They were both very secretive in their family matters and always
sat quietly on their favourite perch looking quite bored if they thought
they were being watched. All our observations were made from behind
a creeper some 20 yards distant.
As soon as I had observed this sign of nesting, I feverishly collected
and spread around all the most attractive samples of soft hay, fibre,
feathers, and moss, but the hen and later the cock persisted in the use
of dead leaves--chiefly those of the willow. I should have mentioned
that during July my man picked up an egg in the aviary which I did

not recognize, it was much like a Bullfinch's, of which I have two pairs
of the Siberian variety, but it looked too large for these birds--and
I thought the Amethyst Starlings would lay eggs of " Starling blue ",
but I must admit that my suspicions and hopes were aroused.
On 29th July I have a note that the hen had spent most of two days
in the nest-box. I did not like to disturb her: moreover these
boxes have an oak lid fastened down by four screws, which take time
to undo.
Finally, on 2nd August, I drove and shut the birds into the shelter
and inspected the box ; it contained three eggs of a grey-blue shade,
mottled with small rufous spots, especially thick at the blunt end.
The nest was very low down, an extremely neat structure, built entirely
of leaves. At this date the hen was extremely nervous and came
off at the slightest sound. Repeatedly I crept up on tip-toe only to
find her peeping at me from the nest hole.
In shape, colour, and movements she often reminded me of a Wry-
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.725161428571428">
neck at this period. I reckoned that she had been sitting since
27th July and that she might hatch about two weeks later, viz. on
10th August, when I should be away from home. My man, who knew
what to look out for, noticed both birds carrying food to the nest on
8th August so one must presume that the hen began to sit before
27th July, or that the incubation is twelve days only.
On 12th August an ominous smell of dead bird was noticed near
</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.996838230769231" page_id="56222945"  page_num="297" year="" vol="">
the nest, which was promptly inspected. The nest was quite sweet
and clean and contained one chick covered with black down, and one
clear egg--the other chick was never traced.
On the 13th and 14th both parents were carrying more leaves into
the log and on further inspection the youngster was found with a sort
of quilt of leaves surrounding him, and only his head sticking out.
On my return to Eton on 17th August I looked into the nest myself
and found the chick about the size of a plucked Sparrow--he appeared
to have climbed on top of the leaves recently added. The skin was
dark pink, with well marked black quill areas on the back, wings, etc.
On 20th August the quills were bursting and showing the feathers to
be much the same colour as the hen bird, and the striation on the
head was clearly visible.

298 Maurice Amsler--The Breeding of the Amethyst Starling
I have made no mention of the food used by the parent birds.
Mealworms were, of course, the chief and favourite item of the menu,
but in addition quite a lot of clean gentles were taken, as well as live
ants' eggs and hard-boiled egg crumbled up with cake crumbs.
During this time still more leaves and a little hay was added to the
nest by the hen, presumably to raise the level of the nest and to facilitate
the youngster's exit into the outer world.
On the 25th the chick was fully feathered, of a mouse-brown colour
with dark buff streaks all over the back wings and top of the head,
the general effect being darker than is the case in the adult hen.
On the following morning we found him sitting on the perch below
the nest entrance--but on being approached he immediately bolted
home and disappeared until 7 p.m. of the same day, when he was found
perched on a ledge some 2 feet above his nest. Later on he flew down to
the ground, but when disturbed flew up to his ledge again. His sense
of orientation and his accuracy in landing on his perches were quite
remarkable for a newly-flown chick.
I have already described the colour of his back. The breast is
again much like that of the hen--but the ground colour pure white,
instead of a sort of stone colour or light buff.
The nest being empty, I was able to examine it more minutely,
and there was no doubt that its level had been raised 2 or 3 inches
during the rearing of the chick, and also that hay as well as leaves had
been added to the original nest.
The remaining egg was quite clear and empty, its dimensions were
23 mm. by 17 mm. For his first and subsequent nights he was driven
into the aviary shelter and shut in for fear of rain storms or nocturnal
cats, the flap over the shelter door being left slightly open, but so wide-
awake was he that he soon learned to fly out through even this small
opening, which had entirely to be closed in consequence.
For some reason I have jumped to the conclusion that this young
bird is a male, although I much hope it will turn out to be a female.
The sex, however, will not be obvious for another year at least. Other
specimens which I have thought to be hens have, after twelve months,
moulted into cocks, so it is quite impossible to be certain of buying
a hen among newly imported birds.

Three days after leaving the nest the young bird was almost as big
as his mother, but had an odd little cocked-up tail, which gave him
a very perky appearance. Both parents, but chiefly the hen, fed
assiduously--a few green cabbage caterpillars were used. Wasp
grubs were not much appreciated except in the absence of other
live food.
Both birds at this time warbled quite nicely and the male when
excited had a habit, not seen before, of lifting each wing alternately,
very suggestive of a man putting on his overcoat.
From 1st September onwards for a few days the old birds were often
seen carrying dead leaves. No sign, however, was found of a new
nest or of additions to the old one.
On \he above date, much to our horror, we found signs of a rat
working in the outer flights of their aviary and the next. Every sort
of rat trap and gin was set in safe places, and I even took a dog into the
aviary and sat up with a gun, but saw nothing of the marauder until
some three days later when he was caught by the leg in a gin and
promptly dispatched. He had gnawed and scratched his way up a
4 in. by 4 in. post which was a little rotten below the ground level.
We breathed again !
By the 7th September we deemed that our baby was no longer
a baby, but independent, for he was frequently seen at the soft food
dish. The parents swallowed most of the mealworms when each
ration was thrown out, and by the end of the month he was only
distinguishable from his mother by the absence of a leg ring, and by
the fact that the }^ellow skin lines at the corners of the gape were just
visible.
I am not aware that the Amethyst Starling has ever been bred
before, either in this country or on the Continent ; at any rate, I hope
not, for I should much like to earn one more medal for my last notable
success at Eton.
Next year all my birds will, I hope, be more suitably housed on
fresh ground in the open country, near Hawkhurst, in Kent, and I expect
to have more success. When I first put up my present aviaries over
twenty years ago my birds bred very well and several were " first

put this down to the fact that my ground was getting stale. The state
of the soil certainly has a marked influence on the fertility of birds,
and even on their willingness to go to nest at all ; and I do not believe
that any soil treatment short of sterilization, which is impossible, is
of much avail. Certainly the addition of lime and rock salts can have
little effect beyond killing worms, slugs, and possibly fungi and protozoa
--as bactericides they are much too weak.
Possibly these Starlings condescended to breed because they are
entirely arboreal and show the greatest reluctance to alighting on the
ground even to pick up a mealworm, but against this I have always
had luck, even up to this year, breeding the Orange-headed Ground
Thrush which spends much more of its time on the ground than on
the perches.
It is more than possible that the proverbial " beginners luck " in
aviculture is due to the fact that the birds are housed in new aviaries
which naturally are erected on fresh ground.

Apart from the breeding of a few Bourkes, Cockatiels, and Redrumps,
season 1935 has been bad, probably due to mice and egg binding during
the spring. A young pair of Peplars, bred here in 1933, laid four eggs,
hatched three, and then failed to feed after two weeks.
I claim one success, however, in the breeding and rearing of the
rare Painted Finch. I imported three pairs of these rare Finches last
autumn at a very rare price. They arrived in splendid condition and
without loss. One pair I passed on to another keen aviculturist, one
pair I placed in the aviary, and the other pair I kept indoors in a box
cage 6 feet long. I lost the hen in the aviary through egg binding. The
hen from the pair indoors laid eggs from the perch and then in the
seed pot. Finally, however, she took to the nest-box and laid four
small white eggs which hatched on 6th August, after about seventeen

days 5 incubation. Both birds shared in incubation and very often
both were in the nest together. I had no chance of inspecting the
eggs during this period. This pair of birds would not touch greenstuff
of any description nor egg food nor mealworms and seemed to survive
only on millet. When their eggs hatched, however, gentles and meal-
worms were eaten greedily, but not egg and biscuit. On 10th August
the cock bird injured himself and could not fly. August 12th, two young
birds taken out of the nest dead, probably due to the cock bird being
unable to feed. Two birds left the nest 22nd August. August 24th,
gentles discontinued. Result young bird died. Gentles continued but
were not eaten after 30th August. Remaining young one doing well
and was able to feed itself on 7th September. Colour of young dark&apos;
brown with a few red feathers on rump ; the breast feathers being
a little lighter brown covered with faint spots. The beak is black
whereas in the adult birds the lower portion is red. It is about three-
quarters the size of the adult bird.
Should other aviculturists be fortunate in securing a pair of these
Finches it may be worth their while to note that live food seems necessary
and that egg food will not do for a substitute. The pair of Finches
kept in the large cage indoors required more heat than the pair kept
in the heated aviary outdoors, although I do not think they will stand
the winter outdoors without heat. Temperature of outdoor aviary
during winter 45 to 55*. Heat required indoors 60 to 65*.

The very mild weather during the early part of the year followed
by a very cold spell in April and May was all against the breeding of
foreign birds. However, during late May many of the birds settled down
in real earnest and several fine birds were reared. The following is

A. Martin--Breeding Results from the Nash
Bauer's Parrakeet: four eggs were laid ; all hatched and were
successfully reared and proved to be very strong and lusty youngsters.
Pennant's Parrakeet: seven eggs were laid by the old pair; six
hatched and five were reared.
Quaker Parrakeet : this pair made a huge nest of twigs in the
shelter ; four eggs were laid ; all hatched and were reared.
King Parrakeet: two clutches of eggs were laid, only to be deserted
by the hen when on the point of hatching. This makes the second year
they have acted in this manner ; I am quite disgusted with their
behaviour.
Swainson's Lory : three eggs were laid and the hen sat well, but eggs
were infertile. This was rather disappointing as I am sure they are a
true pair.
The Barrabands, Browns, and Bock Peplers got no farther than
visiting their nest-boxes.
Peafowl laid three eggs, one of them being eaten by the Sarus
Cranes, the other two were hatched and were reared by a hen acting
as foster-mother, and are, at the time of writing, full grown and strong
chicks.
Californian Quail: many eggs were laid but only four were reared.
The Ducks which live on a natural pond in the wood did none too
well, only the Falcated and Carolinas laying and nine were reared
between them.
Monaul Pheasants : four eggs were laid ; two proved infertile ; the
other two hatched, one being killed by its foster-parent, the other was
reared.
The Cranes did nothing. We had great hopes of the Sarus as they were
seen to mate on several occasions, but nothing came of it. Among the
smaller birds a pair of Green Cardinals laid four eggs and three hatched :
the old birds fed well for a week then left off feeding, no doubt owing
to the lack of insect food, as they are in a mixed collection and I think
the live food was eaten by the others.
Grass Finches laid and reared three young and the hen is sitting
again.
Gouldians did not do well; the hens suffering from egg binding no
doubt being due to the late start.

If one may judge by the occasional requests for, and appreciations
of, articles and notes about birds neither very rare nor very difficult,,
it would appear that quite a number of our members may think it
worth while reading such an article by one whose limitations of time
and space thus restrict his avicultural activities. A preliminary list of
species bred here this season will define the scope of this article. The
numbers in parentheses after the species gives the number of breeding
pairs, and the number following the young bred from them :--*
Peaceful Doves (3) 20, Diamond Doves (1) 6, Red Headed Parrot
Finches (4) 9 (to date, 13th October, pairs still incubating and rearing
in inside aviary), Tricoloured Parrot Finches (1) 3, Parson Finches (1) 7,
Olive Finches (1) 12, Cherry Finches (1) 8, Diamond Sparrows (1) 3,
Aurora Finches (1) 1, Bengalese (about nine pairs, but mostly engaged
as fosters for rarer species) 19.
Bichenow's (2) which reared several young last season have, for
some unaccountable reason, produced only infertile eggs this. Black
Seed, Diuca, and Mexican Rose Finches all nested, but either did not
lay or failed to rear. My one pair of Pintailed Nonpareils nested but
did not lay. As these are in perfect condition, and quite content with
ordinary seed, I have good hopes of succeeding with them next season,
and have held on to them when disposing of most of my other species,
pending the erection of aviaries at Enborne, Newbury, whither I expect
to migrate after Christmas.

304 Prebendary J. E. Sweetnam--Notes from a Somerset Aviary
I believe that this beautiful species is absent from the records of
birds bred in captivity rather owing to the difficulty of getting them
into proper breeding condition than to lack of prolificacy. If, as
Dr. Macklin has now proved, those wildest of the wild, the Eoyals, can be
bred without any great difficulty (except the rather vital one of securing
true pairs) it is strange if the particularly steady and sociable Pintail
should be as difficult to breed as is generally supposed.
I had better use such space as the Editor may consider this article
is entitled to in adding some notes on the breeding of some of the other
species catalogued above.
Parson Finches. --After a mysterious disappearance from aviculture
of a quarter of a century, a few pairs of this hardy and very prolific
bird have recently been imported. Though only obtained in the autumn,
my pair went to nest at once and, in an outside aviary at that, reared
one youngster, which left the nest on Christmas Day. As was only to
be expected under the circumstances, this was rather a weakling and did
not survive for long. The pair went to nest at once on being put together
this spring, and have gone on breeding and rearing almost incessantly
all the season. They are amongst the easiest birds to breed as, except
for a few mealworms, they ask for nothing beyond millet and canary
with seeding grasses, though, in common with most species, they greatly
appreciate live ant's cocoons.
In comparison with other grass finches they have the considerable
advantage of being easily sexed by the wider bib and the darker grey
of head and russet brown breast of the cock ; but an even greater
disadvantage of pugnacity and aggressiveness--so much so that it is
impossible to include a cock with any other small birds, all of which he
attacks with deliberate intent to injure.
On leaving the nest the young are very wild and liable to dash their
heads against window or netting. Having lost one from my first brood
in this way, I avoided further casualties by covering the windows with
tightly stretched butter muslin--a wise precaution also in the case of
young Diamond Sparrows. I did not find the parents at all liable to
attack their young, even when left with them after the next brood was
ready to fly.
I find the eggs of both Parson Finches and Diamond Sparrows can

Prebendary J. E. Sweetnam--Notes from a Somerset Aviary 305
be successfully incubated, and the young reared, by Bengalese and that,
so reared, the young are no slower to reach independence or in any
way inferior to those reared by their own parents.
In my experience, this does not apply to Cherry Finches, the young
of which were much longer leaving the nest, and generally weaker and
longer in reaching independence, when hatched and reared by Bengalese.
After deserting the young of their first two nests, my Cherry Finches
turned over a new leaf, having since proved exemplary parents, and
successfully reared three small broods since June : they are now
incubating again. This is a fascinating and entirely inoffensive species
which one hopes will be more freely imported and bred in future. They
are as easily catered for as Parson Finches and require no live food when
feeding their young. My pair constructed all their nests in clumps
of bracken fixed in wide-mesh netting, placed high up in the aviary.
In comparison to seven young reared by one (imported) pair last
season (and these obtained only about August) Red-headed Parrot
Finches have been, so far, rather disappointing this season but they are
rather late breeders, and it is quite probable some late nests will improve
the present rather poor average. Two of my four pairs were late-hatched
last season, and therefore rather immature for successful breeding this,
but I am inclined to believe the results would have been better had
I been able to provide separate aviary accommodation for each pair.
I do not think breeding results need necessarily be affected by the
inclusion of other small hardbills in the same aviary--provided, of
course, there is no overcrowding--but cock Red Heads in high breeding
condition are liable to harass other cocks, especially when they are
pairing, and so tend to produce the infertile eggs which, rather than
unwillingness to lay and incubate, was my chief trouble this season.
For the first time since keeping the species I have lost some young
at the critical stage of a week or so after leaving the nest and when
reaching the independence of their parents. With four pairs together
in different stages of breeding activities it is difficult to avoid desertion
by a pair wanting to go to nest again immediately but, with one pair
to an aviary, I think the difficulty could be overcome by cutting down
stimulating food for a week or so until the critical period has passed
and the young were feeding themselves. Greater experience with

306 Prebendary J. E. Sweetnam--Notes from a Somerset Aviary
Red Headed Parrot Finches only confirms me in the belief that, apart
from song, they possess nearly every qualification to entitle them to
pride of place in any collection of small hardbills.
If I had any expectation that the Olympians, who award--or other-
wise--medals to ordinary avicultural mortals would condescend to
notice the first breeding of a mere sub-species, I would proceed to
invent details as to the structure of a nest built I know not where, the
size and colour of eggs I never saw, and the feeding (from a choice of
a very varied menu supplied for other species as well) of the New
Hebridean sub-species of Tricoloureb Parrot Finch (Erythrura trichroa
cyaneifrons) recently imported by Mr. F. Shaw Mayer. But fiction
being, I fear, futile I may as well stick to facts and say that the one
young of this smaller and much steadier variety simply " turned up "
most unexpectedly, as the parents were only imported last spring,
and gave no indications of being possessed of such prolificacy as to
rear young by the following June. As once they show colour, there is
no possibility of mistaking a Tricoloured for a Red Headed, and there
were no other Parrot Finches in that aviary, there is no question that
they did ; and this achievement suggests that we have, in this sub-
species, a bird at least as prolific as the Red Head which is saying a
good deal.
An early moult, probably induced by the very hot weather, lowered
the average young reared by both Peaceful and Diamond Doves.
I find the former just as prolific, and much less liable to molest their
young on going to nest again, than the Diamonds. After a series of
failures I have reared one young Aurora Finch this season. I could not
induce Bengalese to rear this species but I believe either Cuban or
Olive Finches might do so successfully. If this species can rightly be
classed as a Waxbill at all, it is one of the most desirable of the genus
and, in a large planted aviary, the readiness with which it goes to nest
and produces fertile egss, combined with a remarkable steadyness and
sociability, should make its breeding comparatively easy.
Olive Finches have again shown themselves to be amongst the
most prolific of all small hardbills for, though the numbers in each nest
were small, my one pair incubated and reared no fewer than five broods
from April to September and would, I believe, still be breeding at the

same rate is the necessity of clearing their aviary had not induced me
to part with them. The most remarkable thing about these pleasing
and sprightly little birds was that they were generally rearing two
broods at the same time and, more than once, they must actually have
had young in two nests at the same time. The cock Olive is distinctly
pugnacious with other species but his " bark is generally worse than
his bite ", and I have had no casualties on this head--though it is
advisable to remove the young from the aviary about a fortnight
after they have left the nest.
It may be worth noting that all the birds referred to in this rather
disjointed article were bred in mixed collections, and most in an inside
aviary (actually a bedroom in a disused part of this old Vicarage) with
quite a small flight-cage attached to one of the windows. While those
who, like the writer, have to regulate the scope of their activities by
the amount of time at their disposal to attend to their birds may have
to choose between a number of carefully selected species together, or
a much smaller number in separate aviaries, from the point of view
of breeding, the mixed collection is a makeshift rather than an ideal
and, given the necessary time and space which I hope shortly to possess,
the modest achievements here recorded might have been considerably
greater.

I should like to take this opportunity of thanking those members
who have kindly written to encourage me on starting my editorial
career. I hope they will forgive me for reminding them that my success
or failure lies with them. If they will only send me articles and notes
on birds, common birds as well as rare ones, the Magazine will prosper,
but I cannot make bricks without straw. If through diffidence or
indifference they will not put pen to paper we are bound to go down hill.
So please do not wait until you have a first breeding or other notable
success to record ; people love to hear about other people's birds, their
tameness and " ways ", no matter whether they are the commonest
under the sun, or the breeding result which has been chronicled a dozen
times already. All is grist to the mill and will fatten our rather lean
numbers and cause your Editor's heart to leap for joy.

This book 1 is an earnest plea for bird preservation, not only in places
set apart for bird sanctuaries, but in gardens small or great throughout
the land.
It tells us how to attract birds, which shrubs and plants provide
the best shelter and most attractive nesting sites, and how to outwit
their enemies. Our modern fashion of keeping hedges as low as possible
deprives birds of shelter, food, and nesting sites, and spraying and
washes are very like to poison insectivorous species. Where there is
no water birds cannot exist, but those who have neither pond nor
stream in their grounds can at least provide a shallow pan filled with
water daily for the benefit of thirsty birds.
All these things and many more are clearly set forth and if they
are carried out will bring birds and interest to the humblest plot.
We are instructed how to feed birds to the best advantage at the
smallest cost, the cheapest and most suitable nesting boxes and where
to fix them. In short, the book is indispensable to all who would like
to attract biids but are doubtful how to set about it.

I am sorry the letters on bird importation have become personal.
Mr. Webb's letter seemed such a serious indictment of all dealers, particularly
those who help the Magazine by their advertisements, that I felt obliged to
protest.
I believe the late Mr. Chapman was a member of the Society. His shop
was beautifully kept and the men kind in every way with the birds. I saw
some unpacked in very good condition.
Messrs, de Von too have sent me some lovely birds.
Your correspondent gave me the impression that all dealers were disgusting
in their methods, and that no decent person should buy birds from them--
even their name on the Magazine was a pollution ! My small experience
has been exactly the opposite.
I never part with my birds consequently my business with bird dealers
has been on a small scale.
The above facts alone made me write to your paper as I did.
If I happen to see a seedy bird in a shop I always try to buy it and have
occasionally had Fire Finches and the more delicate Waxbills sit with closed
eyes for two days but a week's careful nursing cured them, and I have had
them for nearly three years in gorgeous plumage.
In case any one cares to try it my method is this : Get a moderately sized
cage with warmed sand and green turf on the bottom, line half-way up inside
with fine hay and wrap the whole outside excepting the front with flannel.
Keep a temperature of about 80*. They seem readily to take drops of milk
or cream given by a paint brush held close to the beak. I let a drop fall on
the beak and after that find the birds suck the brush eagerly. I sprinkle
Indian millet and white millet on the bottom of the cage, and as soon as
possible persuade them to take a mealworm. One has to watch them night
and day. I prefer them in the house in front of a hot bright fire--it seems
to revive them better than the pipe heat of the bird house. It means a
continuous fire and constant watching night and day--but these trifles don't
count where birds come in. It is such a joy to see their daily improvement.
If this experience is of any use to the sender of the SOS for Waxbills
I shall be very glad.
Muriel Maxwell Jackson.
Avicultural societies and Press were in the past far too blind to the
inhuman cruelty infiicked by a certain class of bird dealer in the past. Our
indifference towards this matter was the direct cause of the Buckmaster Bill
being passed for we had little defence against the charges made. The condition
of many of our British bird shops was simply disgusting and dangerous to
health, and the fearful outbreak of psittacosis caused little surprise among
the more thoughtful aviculturists. The manner in which newly caught wild
birds were caged and handled in our shops and market places deserved corporal
punishment. To see dying Greypates sitting huddled up by the dozen was
a sight which produced the same feeling in the pit of the stomach as does a

slaughterhouse in operation. It was the same with the little foreigners. One
could see cages containing scores of them, dying from dirt, food poisoning,
and resultant diseases. I own over 200 birds but I would rather have aviculture
prohibited than witness the wholesale cruelty formerly practised by certain
inhuman dealers. In this respect neither the R.S.P.C.A. nor the police have
shown much activity. Personally I should like to see the subscription to our
Society raised in order that a qualified inspector could be permanently
employed upon investigation. Cruelty in capturing and transporting South
African birds resulted in the Col. Reitz Bill prohibiting their exportation.
Like the birds of Miss Muriel Maxwell Jackson my aviary birds seldom leave
the garden after escaping. One cock Wild Canary which has sired three nests
of young this year can be trusted out at any time. He has a good feed of
wild seeds and then demands to be let in.
H. Moore, F.Z.S.
Some aviculturalist more experienced than myself and with pen more
able might well reply to Mr. Webb's provocative article in the August issue
of the Aviculture Magazine. At the same time I realize that those best
qualified to answer may well be debarred by circumstances. Those whose
income is even in part derived from dealings in birds must be prejudiced,
whilst our well-known experts who keep birds on a large scale cannot be
expected to view with impartiality any threatened interference with their
hobby.
Most interesting and most timely are the views of one so independently
placed as Mr. Webb, whose knowledge and skill in placing on the market
exotic rarities in perfect condition is probably unequalled. At the same
time some of his remarks must not go unchallenged, if only because they are
unfair and may some day be produced as evidence against our hobby.
For my own part I am but a dabbler. My few birds are kept for the pleasure
they give me, for the joy of domesticating them, of studying their heaven-sent
beauty, hearing their joyous song, and for the delight that possession of any
beautiful living thing brings to a lover of nature. That I have shown a few
birds occasionally is but that others may share some of my pleasure, to show
some proud possession, or to make comparisons of my own methods with those
of other fanciers who can meet together only at such shows. This, I verily
believe, is typical of the attitude of the majority of those who keep foreign
birds.
As for making financial gain out of showing birds, I should like Mr. Webb
to tell me even how to make it pay its way ! A rapid calculation will prove
that all the prizes offered during the show season would not suffice to provide
the requisite collection of birds, house and keep them, and pay for travelling
expenses. The exhibition of foreign birds costs their owners money. All
honour to them that they are willing to bear the cost of showing their treasures
to others--and not least, remember, to the general public.
The keeping of birds is educational and has psychological value. To children
the hobby teaches not only geography and allied subjects, but also the
importance of unselfish kindness to animals, and a deep appreciation of the

beauties and glories of nature. Few will accept the statement that fanciers
are ignorant and careless of all knowledge concerning the natural conditions
of their birds. My own experience is that bird lovers are eager to learn, all
that they can about birds in their natural habitat as well as in conditions of
captivity. The scientific knowledge of many is profound. One has but to
look at the demand for literature, such as books new and old, or to examine
the weekly journals, to find proof of that.
But Mr. Webb's chief criticism is of the methods of importing birds in
vast numbers, by inexpert and unskilled attendants, involving cruelty and
needless loss of life. Whilst everyone must agree with any suggestion for
improving these conditions, Ido believe that they are fast disappearing under
the insistent demand of purchasers for birds in the best possible condition.
After a tour of London dealers lately, I could not but remark upon the excellent
appearance of the majority of birds exposed for sale, nor upon the varieties
on offer which only a few years ago were considered rarities and difficult birds
to keep. Yet these birds are on sale to-day in almost perfect feather and
condition. Dealers know that it is of little use offering anything but birds in
first class order, and what is it but those very shows that Mr. Webb so uncom-
promisingly condemns that are responsible !
We all realize that the tendency in this country and abroad is to increase
restrictions on dealings in birds ; not, let me disagree again with Mr. Webb,
upon the keeping of birds, but upon the trade in them--a very different
matter. We shall find it increasingly difficult to obtain birds as years go on.
It should be the duty of societies such as ours to heed the warning and be
prepared. Let us not condemn ourselves, but rather take active steps to improve
all conditions that remain open to criticism.
Let us not attack the bird lover, but concentrate on the bird dealer who
regards birds merely as a commodity, and who is not himself a bird lover.
Such do exist, despite the shining example of the many whose life interest
is the birds they handle. Why should not such a society as ours exercise some
supervision over traders ? Let there be a list of approved dealers and, if
need be, a black list of unsatisfactory ones. Membership of most societies
carries with it obligations. Why should not membership of the Avicultural
Society involve the obligation of purchasing under only approved conditions ?
There might be a system of voluntary registration by dealers, premises and
methods of importation being under the inspection of the Society's accredited
representatives.
If this system should fail, then it is but a step to supervise importations
on our own behalf, or to specify conditions which alone will meet with our
approval. In this connection it strikes me that Mr. Webb is the very man
to tell us how to proceed.
In his plea for the alterations in the presentation of the Magazine
Mr. Webb will surely find a large following. We should all like to see it enlarged
and on sale to the general public through the usual booksellers. The more
people who can be interested in the hobby the better for the future of aviculture.
Presentation of a magazine on such lines should not be difficult, but would
demand such an enormous increase in production costs that it is extremely
doubtful if the increased sales would render the venture self-supporting.
Increased encouragement must be given for the breeding of birds in
captivity, rather than for the collection of new and rare specimens. Local
societies, show secretaries, and national societies are those who can be asked

to assist in this. It is very rarely that one sees a class in any show reserved
for cage or aviary bred birds, yet this is the department of foreign bird keeping
that must be developed if we are to retain anything at all of our hobby. Let
vis start now before it is too late.
J. E. Haine.
The following extract from a letter received from Miss Maxwell Jackson
is published with her consent.-- Ed.
Referring to the Parrot Ban it seems nothing short of tragedy that bird
lovers and aviculturists here should not be able to keep these most beautiful
birds because owing to insanitary importations they are diseased.
I heard of some inexpensive rough land in Bedfordshire the other day
and wondered if I had bought some of it and allowed the free use of it as
a quarantine station for aviculturists, whether, by all societies joining forces,
it could have been arranged. A bungalow and someone in charge and parrot-
like birds to be brought straight there by aeroplane and not allowed to leave
unless perfectly healthy.
Another idea would be to have some such place outside the chief exporting
town, say in Australia, the birds brought and someone in charge who would
see all were healthy and hand them over to a thoroughly responsible person
and see they had every comfort on the journey. If it could be made to pay
expenses, perhaps we might have something of the kind in India and other
places.
I hope if any of the above suggestions are possible no prohibitive prices
would be charged; only sufficient to pay the expenses of each bird sold.
Aviculturists could charge anything after purchase, but this should be only
a national health insurance against psittacosis.
If such a scheme is ever started and funds wanted to run it on a lasting and
practical basis, I should be very glad to contribute #50. It possibly would not
go far but there are so many eager to help and one would be so thankful if
the troubles that beset us could be even partly cleared away.

Also called Cherry Finch and Modest Grass Finch
This pretty little Finch is found in New South Wales, Victoria,
and South Australia, where it is not uncommon. In the wild state it
builds a domed nest of dry grass lined with feathers, in a low bush.
Five eggs are usually laid and they are white. It has been bred in
England.
This is one of the hardiest and most easily managed of the
Australian Finches and could probably be kept out of doors, provided
its aviary was well planted and sheltered from cold winds. In the
plate the upper figure represents an immature bird, the central one
an adult male, and the bottom an adult female.

Walter Goodfellow--A Collector on Melville Island
A COLLECTOR ON MELVILLE ISLAND
By Walter Goodfellow
Since my recent return to England, when I have said I had been to
Melville Island, in nearly every case I have been asked " Where is it! "
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.990464161290322" page_id="56222970"  page_num="316" year="" vol="">
Therefore for the benefit of those who read this and are equally hazy
about its geographical position, I may as well commence by saying
that it lies in the Timor Sea, 80 miles due north of Darwin in the
Northern Territory of Australia and in extent is roughly 80 miles
by ninety.
Darwin used to be called " one of Australia's backyards Now
it is on the air route they call it " Australia's front door It is hardly
a town in our sense of the word, but a very straggling settlement
overgrown and dust-ladened, and certainly as a " front door " needs
a vast amount of clearing up in more senses than one, for life is very
primitive there.
To go to Melville Island I had to go by the monthly schooner belonging
to the Catholic Mission on Bathurst Island. The narrow Apsley Straits
divides the two islands, and if these could be pushed together, all the
bends would fit in exactly like the parts of a jig-saw puzzle. No white
people live on Melville, and only the mission fathers on Bathurst.
The island is flat, rising to a ridge of slightly higher land in the centre,
and where it is not swamp, it is covered with what the Australians
designate bush. This bush is ugly decrepit vegetation, mostly ill-grown,
and has almost without exception harsh and brittle foliage. There
are some fine and well-grown trees, but they carry a mere handful
of leaves, and all of a general grey green tone throughout. As most
of the leaves hang vertically, there is little shade. Half the amount
of bush and trees over here would make delightful shady woods, but
there one might as well be out in the open for all the shade one gets.
In the breeze there is no gentle rustling of the leaves as in our woods ;
instead it is a rattle. There is not much undergrowth, and that consists
chiefly of the long saw-edged scrub pandanus which lacerates one
at every step, and in the wet season, long coarse grass in addition.
As far as the eye can see through the bush, it is a wilderness of bleached
tree trunks great and small. Such is the scenery of most of the island,

and you might move 20 miles and not know you had gone more than
one for all the change there is in the landscape. Around the coast,
green looking mangroves give a false impression of the interior, but
there is a strip down the west coast bordering on the Apsley Straits,
more dense and tropical looking, but elsewhere there is little to suggest
the tropics as most people picture them.
On arrival at the mission station I hired their schooner to take me
and my baggage some 50 odd miles along the south coast of Melville
to avoid having to walk that distance on foot, and from where I was
set down I walked 8 miles inland to camp. There are great numbers
of blacks on the island, but they have a bad reputation and they roam
from one camping site to another, as the last one gets too insanitary,
even for them, and game gets scarce too perhaps. They make no
habitations, and cultivate nothing whatever, just living on the game they
kill. They are treacherous and great thieves and generally useless.
The majority of both sexes are clothed as they were born. I got to
dislike them very much, and for my part (and many others agree with
me) I should rejoice to hear that the last black had died out in
Australia. They are annihilators of all game, and the fauna of the
country is so unique and wonderful, that personally I consider it far
more worthy of preservation than the " abos ".
At the time of my arrival two young white men were on the island
collecting snake skins and dingo scalps ; the latter for the Goverment
reward of seven and sixpence each. The snake business had slumped.
So neither stayed long after I got there, but within a few months the
blacks had brought them in over nine hundred large carpet Jyshors
alone, and yet during the few months I was there, I never came across
one. Such is my luck who love snakes, and yet I seldom meet them
wherever I go, while other people who loathe them seem always to be
running into them, or say they do. A man in Darwin who was said
to be a noted snake catcher promised to bring me " mobs of them "
but never brought one, and yet you hear the place is overrun with
them.
I made my camp close to the white men's. I had met one of them
in Darwin, and he had walked all the way to the Apsley Straits to
meet me.

Walter Goodfellow--A Collector on Melville Island
Melville Island is a wonderful place for birds, and without the blacks
would make an ideal sanctuary. I cannot see that it is much good for
anything else. During the wet season the whole island is water-logged,
and in the long dry one hardly a drop except swamp water to be found.
I arrived there at the beginning of the wet season which was very late
this year, and at times had the camp entirely under water, but the
dry period had well set in before I left, and the stream I got my water
from was then beginning to be nothing more than a few water holes in the
deeper parts, and most of these would disappear too in time, and the
rest become contaminated by the blacks and wild animals. I therefore
cannot imagine anyone except a bird enthusiast like myself ever
wanting to go there. I went solely to collect rare ducks and geese which
breed there, so, with only two exceptions, I brought no other birds
away. The ducks took up all my time as I had to hand rear them, and
I thought if I got a permit to bring these out of Australia, which I did,
it was as much as I could expect, and I am extremely grateful to the
authorities for granting it. There were many lovely birds that I
should have loved. The natives are no good at all at catching birds.
The only time they can get them alive is during the nesting season. The
white men told me they then brought in billycans full of young Cockatoos,
Parrakeets, and other birds every day for food. These I am sorry to
say are generally thrown on the fire alive. People at home possibly
never think of the enormous amount of cruelty that goes on daily
in every part of the world among uncivilized people, and what birds
and beasts have to suffer at their hands. I meet with it wherever I go.
I was constantly surprised at the number of beautiful and interesting
Australian birds still unknown to aviculturists over here. I suppose
when the exportation of birds was unrestricted, more attention was
paid to the Parrakeets and Seed-eating Finches, to the exclusion of the
still more interesting insectivorous and nectar-feeding kinds, of which
there are innumerable species. How I longed when some fresh bird
came around the camp, for a bunch of ripe bananas to hang up nearby,
just to see what I could attract. I fancy I should have had half the
denizens of the bush come around. I used to do this in parts of South
America, and it was surprising what unlikely birds it attracted. On
Melville there is no fruit to be had of any description, neither did I see

a flower during the whole of my stay. It was too early for the wattles.
I often wondered what the lories and other honey-eating birds found
to live on.
Flies were a terrible pest, especially during the wet season. They
seemed to come in millions and daily drove one to desperation. This
is a phase of Australian life we hear very little about, yet away from
the cities, I suppose there is no other such fly-ridden country in the
world. At any rate I have not yet met with it. As evening came on
they secreted themselves in hundreds among the bed clothes and dry
garments which were about, and even in the washing hanging out to
dry. The only thing to do was to put everything away in closed sacks,
and all blankets well tucked up under the mosquito net, otherwise
everything was stuck together with masses of eggs. They even got into
the sleeping boxes of the ducklings and covered them with lumps of eggs,
some of which hatched out into maggots before morning, until I started
to tie mosquito netting over them every night. I found some of the
Ducks a piteous sight in the morning. It was almost impossible to clean
the eggs off without hurting the birds, and please don't think it was
because the Ducks were dirty. They were kept scrupulously clean, both
themselves and their night quarters. I cannot attempt to convey to
anyone the work and anxiety the plagues of flies caused. They were less
troublesome as the weather got drier.
At one side of the camp stood a very tall dead tree, and like all
others there, bleached quite white. At first I thought it unsightly but
soon changed my opinion for it gave me endless interest during the whole
of my stay there. As it stood higher than most of the other trees around,
it was the resting place for most birds passing by, great and small. One
of the first evenings I was there a flock of quite thirty Black-headed
Ibises settled there, and it was with difficulty I kept one of the fellows
in the next camp from firing at them. I told him he could not eat such
birds, but he said he " only wanted to see what they looked like " I
think now he might have eaten them, for he had gone quite
native like so many men in the Northern Territory, and I found later
they eat snakes, rats, lizards, bats, the large grubs from rotten wood,
and even dingo. As the tree was on my camp I considered it my property
and my right to protect its visitors. After a rest the Ibises flew off,

but returned again at dusk and spent the night there. For several nights
after that just a pair rested there, until one night they found two
Wedge-tailed Eagles in possession and never came again. Eagles
were very numerous in my part of the island, also many species of
Hawks great and small. I put it down to the fact that there must have
been a great many dead kangaroos in the neighbourhood. One of
my neighbours went out hunting every day with a rifle of a bore far
too small to kill a kangaroo, unless hit in a vital part. He never followed
up a wounded animal, and seemed to take it as an insult they did not
wait for him to get close to them. When he came back empty handed
he told me how many he had wounded ; some of these I used to see
later, half eaten by dingos, or birds of prey. Kangaroos were very
numerous, and on more than one occasion ran right through the camp
chased by dingos. The latter however stopped short and turned back
when they saw a human being about. I saw kangaroos about the camp
several times on moonlight nights, from where I lay in bed. Dingos
howled around nearly every night.
Eagles were very fearless, and took absolutely no notice whatever
of my presence. They were often mobbed by the Lemon-crested
Cockatoos, and when the former settled on the dead tree, the Cockatoos
alighted on the highest branches of other trees at a respectable distance,
keeping up an incessant screech until the Eagles moved on.
The sunsets were really marvellous, and at this hour the whole
bush took on quite a different aspect. The whitened and unsightly
trunks then looked on fire, especially my dead tree, when its grotesquely
twisted branches looked as if they were writhing in the agony of
burning.
The commonest member of the parrot family was without doubt
the Ked-collared Lory. I often think of one evening at sunset, when
a flock of perhaps a hundred settled on the dead tree and it looked as
if it had suddenly burst into gorgeous bloom. Large numbers were
always around the camp during the whole of my stay. It is also a very
common bird in and around Darwin and shows little fear of man.
The proprietress of the hotel there had some in an aviary at the back,
and I often saw numbers of the wild ones clinging to the netting trying
to get in. Last June a lady had some young ones brought in which she

was rearing by band. This is mid-winter and not the nesting season
as quoted in some Australian bird books. I will mention others nesting
too later. In the Northern Territory they call these lories " Blue
Hornets
The pretty little Varied Lorrikeet ( P . versicolor) certainly came
second as far as numbers were concerned, and was equally common
around Darwin during the wet season, but not many in the dry period.
When the wattles bloom they appear again in incredible numbers.
They fly high and with a very rapid flight.
The commonest Parrakeet on the island was the Crimson-wing,
and beautiful as they are over here, how still more beautiful and vivid
they looked on their native soil in that blazing sunlight. Their flight
is irregular and quite different to most other Parrakeets. I often mistook
them for Hawks. They again are very common around Darwin, in every
garden and backyard, and along all the main roads through the settle-
ment. In June and July, when everything was burnt up, they were
feeding on the dry seed stalks of horehound, which grows from any-
thing up to 8 feet high along the chief thoroughfares, and on every
bit of vacant land. I noticed great numbers of immature birds among
them there, but all were very tame and allowed me to approach
within a few yards ; in fact they remained feeding at a less distance
than that if you walked straight on and took no notice of them. When
feeding they are very silent, and it is possible to pass them by, unless
the bright colours of the adult birds betray their presence among the
dust-covered, dried up vegetation.
When first I arrived in Melville the lovely Hooded Parrakeets
(Psephotus dissimilis) were fairly common, but I never saw one after
the end of March. It is not found on the mainland near Darwin, but
in certain districts farther inland. There it is called the Golden
Shouldered, which is incorrect, and which comes from Arnhem Land
at the south end of the gulf of Carpentaria. I am not sure that I have
ever seen a true Golden Shouldered, unless a pair Mrs. Johnstone had
at Rougham Hall many years ago belonged to this species. I often
think now they did.
A far more common bird was Brown's Parrakeet, and I think
from what I have heard trappers say about it on the mainland, it must

have been much more numerous on Melville. They were around the
camp every day during my stay in flocks of six or seven, or in pairs
only, often sitting still for a long time at a stretch. Although they
are not found near Darwin, they are well known there, and many people
kept them. They are called Smutty or Black-headed Rosellas.
Black Cockatoos ( Banhsians ) were fairly numerous. I often came
across them, sometimes in pairs, or as many as eight together. They
are real acrobats in the trees, and seem to thoroughly enjoy life. They
are fond of clinging to the bark of gum trees, and stripping off large
pieces ; probably searching for grubs. Many times they rested for a
while on my dead tree. Someone told me they had seen them preparing
to nest near Darwin in July.
The Lemon-crested Cockatoo was everywhere and always very
frisky, especially in the evenings, and sometimes when it was too dark
to see them. Up in the north they seemed to have much longer crests
than those from the south. They had many in captivity in Darwin,
and I thought I had never seen any with such long crests before. I
knew of one an absolute champion in this respect.
The Bare-eyed Cockatoo (0. sanguinea) was likewise a common
bird on the island, and nothing like so noisy as the former species.
Their flight is slightly different too. Twelve rapid flaps, followed by a
very long glide. By this alone I could always distinguish them, even in
the far distance, and unlike the others, they are silent when flying.
The blacks, both on Melville and Bathurst insisted this is the female
of the Lemon-crested species. This again bears out what I have found
in many other countries : that the natives after all know very little
about their own birds. I have often heard people say " the natives
know all about them you may be sure, much better than we do
But they don't. They know their habits so far as the right places to
look for them, and their nests too perhaps, but they are only interested
in all these creatures from a food point of view. I have had examples
of their ignorance over and over again, relating to mammals, birds,
reptiles, and insects.
The Bare-eyed Cockatoo is far less suspicious than the Lemon-
crests. They often settled in the dead tree, and stayed there even
when I was moving about directly below--a thing the others nevesr did.

I heard some excellent talkers of this bird in Darwin. When I first
arrived there in January there was one flying about the place. It
visited most of the houses, alighting on the window-sills and verandahs.
On Saturday afternoon it was quite a nuisance on the football ground,
settling on the goalposts and flying in and out among the players,
so much so, that I always expected to see someone lose their patience
and knock it down. I understood that this bird had appeared in Darwin
during the last three wet seasons only. It had cleared off again before
I returned from Melville. I should think it had escaped from captivity
at some time. In many of its ways the Bare-eyed resembles G-offin's
which come from the islands farther north.
Of all the birds on the islands to attract the most attention, with
the possible exception of two species of Doves of which I shall have
more to say later, were the Friar Birds [Philemon). Not because of
any bright colours, for they are clad only in brown, but because of
their numbers, and above all, their more than peculiar voices. They
were all over the place, and I am safe in saying that there was not a
daylight hour when they were absent from around the camp. I think
I made out three species, but as I never shot any I can't be quite
sure. They were P. corniculatus , P. argenticejps and P. gordori , the last
peculiar to Melville Island. Some of their notes are fine, but repeated so
incessantly, they became irritating, and some others loud and half-
human like a maniacal cry. When they were just chattering among
themselves, I often thought they were human beings talking in the
bush. On wet days they were silent, so we had something to thank
wet days for. They are not in the least shy of human beings, and con-
tinued their constant search for insects on every leaf from the highest
trees to the lowest bushes, and sometimes among the grass. They never
failed to mob the Ravens whenever any came around the camp. These
are the birds they call " Feather Heads " in Queensland.
A bird I admired above all was the Blue-faced Honeyeater
(.Entomyzon cyanotis). It is as large as a Jay, and more beautiful than
any plate I have seen of it. Although placed among the honey eaters,
one can hardly imagine its thickish bill sucking honey from flowers.
It seems much more adapted for eating fruit and insects. Parties of
six or more often visited the camp, and remained for an hour diligently

searching the bushes for insects, especially the pandanus which seemed
to attract them the most. They also flew straight at the trunks of
trees, alighting on them after the manner of a woodpecker, or hanging
by their strong claws from branches to examine the bark underneath.
A very conspicuous yellow patch shows up in the wings when they fly.
I think this is one of Australia's most lovely birds, and worthy of a
better setting than this unattractive island where it is only seen by the
blacks, who, if they caught it would only throw it on the fire, feathers
and all. It of course is found on the mainland too, and I believe I saw
a pair in the Melbourne Zoo two years ago, in a wilderness aviary where
it was not easy to get a view of them. I should certainly love to see
some over here, and to be able to enjoy them often.
I wish I knew the name of a bird which flew with a very fluttering
flight high over my camp every day; always singly, and calling
Tea-cher, Tea-cher, in a high-pitched voice. Even with strong glasses
I never could identify it against the light.
Many birds came around the camp with beautiful voices, but an
unsustained song. Some notes led one to expect great things, but ended
in nothing more. One, however, was one of the most lovely songsters
I have ever heard in any land. Here again I was unable to identify
it although it came a number of times. I think always the same bird,
as it sang from the same bush each time. I think I only caught a
glimpse of it twice. It came during the hottest hours of the day, and
remained in the seclusion of some bushes rather low down. Directly
I moved out to look it was silent and I imagine dropped to the ground
and made off among the long grass and undergrowth. If I saw the right
bird it appeared to be as large as a thrush, but perhaps thicker built
and of a more or less uniform grey or brown, but of this I am
not sure as it hid itself so carefully. It seemed to me as if such a
song was out of place in those hard and unprepossessing surroundings,
and more suitable to shady green lanes and woods. It showed at least
that Australia has some song birds as good as any elsewhere if I had
needed a proof.

MEETS A HUMMING BIRD FAMILY

By Carl N aether
On a sunny Sunday afternoon in March, an amateur gardener
and I were joyously exclaiming over the beauty of the camellia blossoms
in one of California's rare plant gardens. Truly it was a gorgeous sight--\0x25A0
literally hundreds of large, rose-like flowers in white and in shades of
pink, red, and rose set among the shiny, dark green leaves of these
splendid evergreens. Suddenly my companion pointed to a very small,
cup-shaped something, made of plant-down and fine mosses, and bound
together with cob-webs : " Why, there's a humming bird's nest! "
A look into the nest, which was only approximately 4 feet above the
ground, disclosed two tiny white eggs, in shape elliptic ally oval. Since
there were many other visitors in the camellia gardens, whose attention
we did not wish to attract to our find, we left the vicinity of the nest
without further delay.
As an amateur bird photographer of long, though to be sure not
very high, standing, I decided at once to secure, if possible, a series of
close-ups of the Humming Bird's activities about the nest, though
each time I went it would mean a 30 mile drive and the better part
of half a day. As a matter of fact, my wish to photograph such a nest
w r as of many years' standing. Only last summer I discovered a similar
nest in a live oak far up in Spanish Canyon. Alas, the nest was not only
too far off the ground but in other respects altogether unreachable.
The following Sunday I rose early so as to arrive at the gardens hours
before a curious public had opportunity to observe me about the nest.
The moment I came within sight of it, I heard the familiar " Zst, zst "
and knew that all was well. Madame Humming Bird was busily
incubating her little white eggs. Her mate I did not see once. My hopes
ran high. Would she stay on the nest and let me come sufficiently
close to get a good likeness of her ? As if answering my query, she flew
off the nest immediately, disdaining to have anything to do with me
at such uncomfortably close range. Quickly I set the tripod and camera
up, for I did not want the tiny eggs to get chilled in the cool morning

air, having before attached a long, dark-green string to the shutter
release.
Then, string in hand, I hid behind a camellia bush about 5 feet
from the nest, ready to " snap " the little brown bird mother the moment
she should resume her brooding activities. After a little time she came
whizzing through the air. She discovered me first of all, flying anxiously
about my head. Then she inspected the shiny legs of the tripod, and
lastly the camera--that big, black intruder with the immense, staring
eyes. Flash--and she was gone, only to return for a second scrutiny
of the camera. Once she was tempted to stick her long beak into one of
the shiny lenses and another time she almost perched on the " line of
release ".
Suddenly with a " Zst, zst ", which probably meant " My eggs
will get chilled if I leave them uncovered any longer ", she alighted
not on, but in the nest, nervously turning her head this way and that
half a dozen times before settling down to the business of incubating.
Her brownish colour blended with the dark-green foliage of the camellias.
Fortunately she turned her head toward the camera. The nest could
be photographed only from one side--unless, of course, I chose to
cut away the leaves and branches shielding it, which I did not care to
do. The light was fairly good on that somewhat murky March morning.
It was further dimmed by the lattice roof of the garden house (camellias
must have shade in order to thrive). I had set the lense opening at
eight and the shutter speed at 1/5 second. Slowly I began to pull the
long string so as not to frighten the bird whose eyes were fixed on the
camera. The moment she saw the string move she was gone with a
whir and a " Zst ". Quickly I stepped up to the camera to see that
everything was still in proper readiness and then resumed my watchful
waiting. Soon the bird returned, flying several times about the camera
before alighting on the nest. This time it was not the moving string
which disturbed her, but the click of the shutter. During the succeeding
exposures, however, she stuck to her guns, so to speak, and did not leave
the nest till I approached it to make the camera ready for the next
exposure. Of the half dozen snapshots showing nest with eggs, the one
accompanying this sketch turned out to be the most satisfactory.
Bright and early the following Sunday, I returned to the nest

only to find that one tiny young had hatched. The remaining egg was
not even pipped, its dark purplish colour indicating that it was fertile.
The youngster resembled an ugly worm rather than a young bird.
Not wishing to delay the hatching procedure, I left the gardens without
taking any pictures. The following Saturday night, a slow drizzle
developed into an all-night downpour which made me fear for the safety
of the flimsy nest stuck precariously on the small camellia branch.
When on the next day I looked into the nest, I found that the rain
had almost soaked it off its foundation. One youngster w T as clinging
to the heavily listing nest ; the other I finally discovered on the wet
ground. He was numb with cold and showed but faint signs of life.
I righted the nest and propped it up as best I could. It had lost its
former shape entirely and was nothing more than a wet mass of this
and that. I placed the half-dead youngster beside his twin brother, or
sister, who was breathing very rapidly. Authorities estimate that the
Humming Bird's blood is almost always at fever heat temperature, which
is variously estimated at from 111 to 114 degrees of Fahrenheit. Quickly
I placed my camera in position and withdrew to my usual hiding-
place. Soon Lady H. B. came. Carefully she inspected me and my
paraphernalia before attending to the wants of her little family. She
made a valiant attempt to feed the young bird that had fallen to
the ground, gently poking him with her long bill--quite rightly she
thought him in dire need of nourishment. But he only moved sluggishly
in response to the motherly caress, the parent thereupon proceeding
to feed the other youngster. Carefully she inserted her beak into his
to disgorge nectar for a few moments ; then she withdrew it just as
carefully. Naturally, I wanted a picture of the feeding operation. At
first she disappointed me a number of times by turning her back on the
camera and me as if to say, " This is strictly a private, a family affair,
if you please ! " After an hour's waiting--she usually fed the young four
times an hour--she condescended to pose in full side view and was
disturbed neither by the string as I pulled it nor by the click of the
shutter. But before I go further, it is necessary to record an interesting
fact. Approximately five minutes after I had returned the half-dead
young Humming Bird to the nest, he was breathing as rapidly as
his mate. What marvellous powers of recuperation in such a tiny

body ! I wondered bow long that little fellow bad lain on tbe cold
wet ground during that long, rainy nigbt.
When I arrived tbe Sunday following, tbe sun shone bright in tbe
charming camellia garden, which, though filled with hundreds of
perfectly formed blossoms, yet bore only the smell of the wet earth,
for camellias have no fragrance. Never have I seen insect or Humming
Bird visit a camellia blossom. An overhead sprinkling system operates
once or twice a day to provide necessary moisture for the growing plants,
but dangerous moisture for the little nest. When Mrs. H. B. selected
her nesting site, she did not in all probability take into consideration
the daily drenchings her roofless home would have to endure. At any
rate, I found the nest tilted again and occupied by only one youngster,
who was quite well feathered--his back being a bright green. Of the
other fledgeling I could find no trace whatever. The survivor had spread
himself out in the roomy nest, as may be seen in one of the accompanying
photographs. When I touched his now quite long beak with a twig,
he obligingly opened it wide so that I was able to get the wide-open space
into the picture. When I tickled him a second time, he withdrew into
the recesses of the nest and turned a frightened eye on me.
Scrutiny of the first dozen exposures showed that most of them had
very little contrast--the nest among the dark greenery was hardly
visible. For this reason I used a piece of white cardboard in later pictures
to brighten the background. Mother Humming Bird did not like this
change in the surroundings of her home at all. For several minutes
she watched me silently. The camera was set at 1/25 second with a
6*3 lense opening, the morning being reasonably bright. Suddenly
she darted to the nest to feed the youngster, which she did as non-
chalently as if nothing had disturbed her, enabling me to get a good
close-up. While the light background shows her as well as the youngster
to much better advantage, it tends to diminish the naturalness of
the scene.
All in all, this amateur bird photographer drove 120 miles,
spent four half days and considerable money and effort to
secure the pictures that accompany this article--which are the best
from several dozen. Doubtless a more experienced bird photographer
could have done much better. But who is to say that he would have

afforded the present writer into the family life of the Humming Bird,
and the experience of photographing this life, under more or less trying
conditions, have not already repaid him many times for all the time and
trouble.
A TAME TROUPIAL
By Mrs. Goddard
Last Christmas I received a most delightful present from Capt. Waud,
in the shape of a most beautiful Troupial. The bird was rather shy at
first, although I very soon persuaded it to take mealworms, and
flies, etc., from my hand. After I had had it for about a month I let it
fly about the room for an hour or two every day, when I would be
writing or painting. I very seldom go about without five or six dogs of
all sorts at my heels, including the dignified " Pedro ", and they
always sit in any room with me that I may be using. Well, the first
day that I allowed " Jacko " out of his cage, he was satisfied to sit
on the top of it and survey his surroundings, including the dogs. It
was most amusing to watch him, with his head first on one side and then
on the other, taking stock of us all so to speak. In a very few days
he alighted on the table at which I was working and proceeded to
peck away at my paint book, which was not conducive to good work
on my part. This form of exercise went on. until about April; when
one day early in the morning, when I was cleaning the cage, master
Jacko slipped out, and before I could turn round had disappeared
through the open door into the garden ! One can imagine my dismay
at (as I thought) losing my lovely gold and black devil (he really is
nothing less), but so lovable and full of character. I completely lost
sight of him and could not hear his cheerful whistle, although for
hours we hunted the gardens. They went on till about 7.30 p.m.,
I had given up all hope, and was sitting in the garden, when to my
joy Jacko suddenly appeared on the very top of the roof ? ! I fetched

his cage into which I dropped a mealworm, and in an instant he
swooped down on to the top first and then into his cage ! He seemed
hungry, but not as hungry as one would have imagined, after nearly
twelve hours liberty. After that all through the summer Jacko has had
his liberty and flies about the grounds all day, coming back in the way
or Whenever the fancy takes him. He will fly in at a window or door
straight to where he knows his cage is, and I find him inside, with the
door still open ! He is, I need hardly say, full winged, and looks too
lovely flying about : he is very cruel to the Sparrows who have a holy
dread of his sharp beak ! I always like to know he is safe before going
out for any length of time. If he is not in, I only have to stand on the
lawn with the meal tin in my hand and call, and he comes flying straight
to me and alights on my shoulder and so to bed !

The late frosts in May were disastrous to early breeding Parrakeets,
and I was most unfortunate in losing some very good young ones in
the nest, when the parents suddenly gave up feeding them. Among
these were two beautiful blue Alexandrines. I have tried not giving
the birds their nest boxes till late in the year, but I found they lay
just the same from their perches. I now give a few notes and results.
Alexandrine Parrakeets (P. nipalensis ).--The old blue male is
mated to a blue bred female, which laid three eggs by the 23rd March.
Two young were hatched by the 15th April and were reared. One blue and
the other green, and the third egg was infertile.
Alexandrine.-- Lutino hen mated to a lutino bred male, laid three
eggs by the 31st January. Two young were hatched by the 23rd
February. The third egg contained a partly formed chick. The two
young ones reared are both lutiuos. This is the first time I have
bred a lutino Alexandrine.

Another pair of blue-bred Alexandrines laid three eggs by the
20th March. Three young hatched by the 14th April. Two of these
were a lovely blue, and the third a green. Suddenly the parents gave
up feeding the young during the cold spell we had in May. Tried
hand rearing them, but I am afraid they were too far gone and I lost
them all. One died on the 18th May, one on the 2nd June, and the
third on the 9th June.
Ring-necked Parrakeets ( P . krameri). --Lutino bred male and
a lutino female laid four eggs by the 15th March. Only one young
was reared, the rest of the eggs being infertile. The young one is a
green and left the nest on the 1st June.
A green male and a lutino female Ring-necks laid three eggs by
the 31st March. All three were hatched and the young reared, leaving
the nest on 19th June. All three green.
Another pair of Ring-necks. Lutino bred male and a lutino female
laid two eggs by the 18th May. Both hatched and were successfully
reared, leaving the nest on 4th August. One young one is green, and
the second is lime green.
Derbyan Parrakeets (P. derbyana). --Four eggs were laid by
4th April. All infertile. By the 14th May three more eggs were laid.
All hatched out and fully reared, leaving the nest on 28th July.
Crimson-winged Parrakeet (Aprosmietus erythropterus). --Four
eggs laid by the 19th May. Two young hatched out and reared. The
other two eggs were broken in the nest. Two fine healthy young
left the nest on 14th July.
Princess of Wales's Parrakeets ( Polytelis alexandrce). --Five eggs
laid by the 18th April. Three young were hatched and the other two
eggs were infertile. Two left nest 19th June and the third one was
found dead four days later. This is the first time these birds have
had only one nest. As a rule they lay and rear two lots every year.

By H. S. Sewell
Having read with pleasure some very interesting breeding summaries
in this Magazine, by two or three enthusiastic English fanciers on
Foreign Finches and Waxbills, I am induced to record some of my
successes for the breeding season ending 30th June last.
I first opened up my account by breeding the common African
Fire Finch [Lagonostica Senegala) ; although quite common, I know
many birds easier to breed. These tiny Finches had the nasty habit
(at least the cock bird had) of gathering up his offspring one by one,
usually when a few days old, and placing them at the far end of the
aviary in a heap, where if not seen in time, the ants would quickly
kill them. I believe this procedure is adopted by most Finches and
Waxbills from time to time ; incorrect feeding or interference with
their nests is, no doubt, usually the trouble. However, I finally
reared two birds which turned out to be hens ; these are now about
15 months old.
The next species I concentrated on was the Scaly Crowned Weaver
(Sporopipes sqamifrons), habitat Africa, sometimes called Moustache
Finch. To-day this bird is more of a rarity, as are most of the South
African Finches. The markings on the head are black and grey,
resembling scales. It also has a black throat marking, not unlike a
drooping moustache, hence this bird's two names. I do not know
if this bird has been bred in England ; I should imagine so, as I have
found them most prolific. In each case they nested in logs, their eggs
are pale green, heavily speckled with brown. The most remarkable
nest I had from this species was of six eggs and six youngsters raised.
Altogether I reared fourteen young and eventually disposed of the
entire family as I wanted room for new species. They have very little
to recommend them as to colour, although uncommonly marked.
They are very active birds, extremely noisy--incidentally quarrel-
some.
The Giant Magpie Mannikin (Amauresthes fringilloides ), habitat

Africa, is another variety which has done well for me this year,
having bred eight young to date and the parents still nesting. These
also have very little to recommend them as to colour and of course
no song. Their courting dance is most peculiar; with his elongated
neck, the cock bird vibrates his beak in such a manner which puts
me in mind of a snake darting his tongue (readers many think my
imagination a trifle vivid). A Fringilloides lay four white eggs. The
oldest of my young birds is nearly twelve months. I consider them
reasonably prolific and extremely hardy.
The White-headed Mannikin ( Munia maja). This common but
attractive little bird is so well known that description is unnecessary.
Incidentally I consider this species one of the hardest to breed ;
considering the thousands that are sold, very few indeed are bred. I
was fortunate in inducing a pair I had to breed, after having them
eighteen months or so. I believe the greatest difficulty in breeding
Munia maja is on account of their extreme timidity ; I only succeeded
in raising one young.
The Painted Finch ( Emblema Picta) I had wonderful results
until the late summer, having bred thirty birds of this extremely
rare species. The majority having moulted out into full colour, when
some of the younger ones started dying. At first I thought it was due
to moulting, but unfortunately awakened to the true facts too
late, when full coloured birds started dying at an alarming rate. After
isolating the birds and doing everything possible in the way of tonics
and keeping the birds in a hospital cage at 80 degrees (incidentally not
saving a single sick one) I finished up by losing approximately twenty
birds. I understand the disease was enteritis ; however, these things
are sent to try us, and I hope to gain by that experience this year. I
have one marvellous pair that have been breeding continuously since
last September, excepting for about two or three weeks, when they
went into a short moult. It will be twelve months in a week or two since
they started. This is no doubt an outstanding performance. (For
breeding description of this species see Avicultural Magazine,
January issue.)
Dufresne's Waxbill ( Coccopygia Dufresnii). I succeeded in raising
four youngsters of this beautiful little bird some months back and by

the look of things I do not think it will be long before they will be
building again.
I was fortunate in securing our South Australian Society's breeder's
medal for all the above species bred this year, so on the whole I am very
satisfied with the season's results, and only hope the coming one will
be as good.
I have tried time and again with the Melba Finch (Pytelia melha)
but in vain. One pair have had seven nests, and in the majority
of cases the young die in the shell. I have always encouraged them
to build under cover ; this may have been the trouble, possibly not
obtaining enough moisture, as on one occasion in a different aviary
they nested outside in a bush and raised one young to a fortnight old, but
unfortunately threw it out, so I have now turned this pair out into a
garden aviary, where they have nested again, so hope for better results
this time.
I have a few nice specimens of the beautiful Fire Tail Finch
(Zoenaginthus bellus) which I have had for some months. These birds
usually start breeding from September on. I recently received a few
nice birds including Peters Spotted Finches, Black Throated Cardinals,
Bed faced Waxbills (.Pytelia afra), Pileated, Nonpareil and Indigo
Buntings, etc., so will have some new species to concentrate on this
coming season.
The Ornamental Pheasant Society is very proud of the fact that
we have been allocated a space in the Avicultural Magazine for
every publication. We are grateful to the Society for this space
and we feel confident that it will prove of mutual benefit. We hope
to keep your members posted as to our activities, and for such
activities we hope to receive the support of your members.
Furthermore, we hope to be the means of introducing this delightful
hobby to many of your members who, keen fanciers though they may
be of many other foreign birds, have not yet taken up the absorbing
hobby of Pheasant culture.
It is a strange fact that in such countries as France, Italy, Germany,
and America the Pheasant fancy has long held sway, yet here in Great

Britain it is but in its infancy. The cult is most certainly on the
increase but the O.P.S; are anxious to obtain many new recruits. It is
probable that in England there are more working-class Pheasant
fanciers than in any other country of the world, and the more
leisured classes have not yet appreciated the great beauty of these
wonderful birds. It is true to say that no birds in the world
breed better in captivity, and not only will they breed well, but all the
chicks are possible to rear, some of course being easier than others.
And here is a point that should interest all members of the Avicultural
Society. Many Pheasants are almost extinct in their native homes,
and unless we aviculturists make a determined effort to breed some of
these in the next few years then they will be lost for all times. Surely
this must appeal to some of your members. What a chance it is for
us Britishers to show the world what we can do to pass on to future
generations some of these beautiful Pheasants that would otherwise
be known to them only as stuffed specimens--poor consolation indeed.

These marvellous photographs of wild life from all parts of the world
are a. revelation to the ordinary person of the astonishing strides made
in nature photography within the last few years. It is difficult which
to admire most, the perfection of the plates or the patience and
intrepidity of the photographers who in many cases risked their lives
to obtain them.
How many of us would stay to photograph a charging rhinoceros,
or an African Bull Elephant, even though a comrade were covering
him with a rifle ? or wait long enough to secure pictures of wild shy
birds feeding their young and brooding their eggs ?
How many wasted plates before the desired photograph was
obtained ? All honour to those men who dared, waited, and succeeded.

Where all are so good it is difficult to single out any for special mention,
but the flash-light picture of the deer leaping in the dark with its
perfect reflection, cannot be passed over, nor among the birds the
Lyre birds' display and the Bittern in the reeds.
Apart from their beauty, these pictures have great educational
value, and should inspire the rising generation to sally forth into jungle
and mountain with a camera instead of a gun, and to bring back
trophies which have not entailed the death of their subject. It would
be hard to find a better present for a nature-loving child.
Moreover, the melancholy fact forces itself on our notice that in the
not far distant future, only photographs will remain to show the
many birds and animals which are doomed to disappear off the earth
before the ever-advancing and destructive " March of civilization
The book is astoundingly cheap at the price charged for it. Country
Life, Ltd., are as much to be congratulated on its publication as on the
wonderful collection of nature photographs, now on view in the British
Museum (Natural History), Kensington, which their enterprise has
assembled from all over the world.

Sir, --I feel compelled to reply to some of the critics who seem to imagine
that my article was meant as a wholesale attack on all bird-dealers. This
is, of course, ridiculous, as everyone must know who read the article carefully.
What I did say, and I repeat, was that the importation of birds in large
quantities in an overcrowded state and without proper attention was the
cause of many countries prohibiting further export, except perhaps to zoos.
I happen to know that, in the case of South Africa and Tanganyika, an
English dealer was responsible for this, but this is no reflection on dealers in
general.
In the course of years of travel it is only natural that I should have seen
more " behind the scenes " than people whose only knowledge of bird-
importation has been gained by occasional visits to bird-shops.
This question, no doubt, has two sides to it and I hoped that readers would
make suggestions without being too personal, in an endeavour to help the
future of aviculture. Now that more and more countries overseas are pro-
tecting their birds, it is going to be very difficult for our members to obtain
their favourite foreigners unless the Society can enjoy some of the privileges
granted to zoos. However, I fear that people who claim that everything
in the bird business is all right and that there never has been anything wrong
with it, will be the cause of the eventual downfall of aviculture in England.
C. S. Webb.
