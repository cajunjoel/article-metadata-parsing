The Medal may be awarded at the discretion of the Committee to any
Member who shall succeed in breeding, in the United Kingdom, any species of
bird which shall not be known to have been previously bred in captivity in Great
Britain or Ireland. Any Member wishing to obtain the Medal must send a detailed
account for publication in the Magazine within about eight weeks from the date
of hatching of the young, and furnish such evidence of the facts as the Executive
Committee may require. The Medal will be awarded only in cases where the
young shall live to be old enough to feed themselves, and to be wholly independent
of their parents. No medal can be given for the breeding of hybrids, or of local
races or sub-species of species that have already been bred.
The account of the breeding must be reasonably full so as to afford
instruction to our Members, and must appear in the Avicultural Magazine before
it is published or notified elsewhere. It should describe the plumage of the young,
and he of value as a &apos;permanent record of the nesting and general habits of the species.
These points will have great weight when the question of awarding the Medal
is under consideration.
In every case the decision of the Committee shall be final.
The Medal will be forwarded to each Member as soon after it shall have been
awarded as possible.

The subject of our coloured plate this month is one of the most
beautiful of the genus Turacus. Particularly noticeable are the feathers
of the front of the crest, which are longer than the others, and inclined
to fall forward, to a greater extent even than is shown in the
illustration ; and each feather has a white tip. The species occurs
in Mossamedes and Benguela, extending to the western shores of
Lake Tanganyika. Further to the east occurs the very closely allied
T. livingstoni , in which the feathers, of the crest are said to be shorter
and the tail greener, while a third, T. reichenowi , from the Nguru
mountains, is said to have the back and wings bluer than the tail.
The recognition of such minor differences is akin to the occupation
of splitting hairs, and it is doubtful whether there is any real distinction
between these so-called races. Neither T. schalowi nor its allied races
are often to be seen in captivity, but like the other species of the genus
they are amongst the most desirable of aviary birds. Their principal
food is fruit and they build an open shallow nest like that of a Pigeon,
laying two white eggs. The illustration is not quite as successful as
it might be, in that the crest is made to appear too solid in the
reproduction.--D. S-S.

E. F. Chawner--A Visit to a German Aviary
A VISIT TO A GERMAN AVIARY
By E. F. Chawner
This autumn I carried out a long-desired visit to the Black Forest.
While there I received a cordial invitation from Herr Stefani to spend
some days at his house and inspect his aviaries.
Naturally I accepted his kind offer and set off the next day for
Neuss am Rhein, which is a country town about two hours by rail
from Cologne. Herr Stefani, junior, met me at the station and we
plunged at once into avicultural talk, for both father and son are equally
enthusiastic bird-lovers. We spent the evening looking at bird books
and comparing notes on our respective aviaries and birdy experiences.
Herr Stefani's aviaries are in Holzheim, a short railway journey
from Neuss. There he has a caretaker and a garden which he and his
son cultivate and plant with their own hands. They planned and laid
out the aviaries themselves and one or both go every day to feed and
tend their birds.
The Pheasant aviary is 56 ft. long by 37 ft. wide by 8 ft. high, and
is divided into five compartments, which, when I saw them contained
Manchurian Crossoptilons (these are allowed to roam about loose
during the day), young White Pheasants, Siamese Firebacks, pure-bred
Amhersts, and a magnificent cock Gallus varius, very large and highly
coloured, whose two hens had respectively laid clutches of seven and
nine eggs. The first clutch had just hatched out under a hen seven
delightfully healthy, lively chicks, and the second was due to hatch
about a week later. Herr Stefani proposes to enter the cock for the
Crystal Palace Show, where no doubt he will find many admirers.
Another aviary 40 by 30 feet was divided into seven compartments
and contained Monaul, Chinquis and Germain's Polyplectron, Hors-
fields, and a pure bred imported Amherst. Though the flights were
rather small all the birds were in the best of health and coming well
through the moult. They had good shelters and the flights were
amply provided with growing shrubs and grass which the inmates,
evidently appreciated ; the floors of the shelters are thickly covered
with river sand from the Rhine which is renewed twice yearly. Since
my visit Herr Stefani has obtained hens for the Monaul and Germain's,
and hopes next year to breed them.

Besides these Pheasants Herr Stefani has a number of Parrakeets
and small birds. Por these there are three blocks 40 by 30 feet,
divided into ten compartments, and another heated one 200 feet in
length. When I saw them these contained Blossom-head Parrakeets
with three well-grown young birds, numerous Budgerigars, Blue,
Cobalt, Apple, Olive, and White--these last took 1st prize in 1926 at
the Crystal Palace. Scaly-fronted Weavers, believed to be the only
pair in Europe, Eire Pinches, Crimson-eared Waxbills, Hooded Siskins,
Bib Finches, White-throated Finches, Green Cardinals, Lazuline
Buntings, Orange and Napoleon Bishops, St. Helena and Green Wax-
bills, Tricoloured and Common Parrot Pinches, Bicheno's (which bred
last year), Diamond Sparrows, Zebra, Long-tailed and Masked Finches,
all with nestlings ; Madagascar Weavers and a pair of the rare Vidua
splendeus, Jacarini Finches, White Canaries, Common and King
Whydahs, Grosbeaks, Masked and Fischer's Love-birds, Chinese
Quails with young, and a pair of Shamas. Also a new arrival,
Neorhynchus nasecus, which is said to be a first importation. These
aviaries have electric light and heat and running water. One tap
when turned automatically empties all the water pans, and another
fills them. The seed is stored in mouse-proof tins and every detail
most efficiently thought out. Were it not so it would be impossible
for two busy men to attend to all these birds and the garden without
help. Every bird has to undergo a month's quarantine before it is
allowed to mix with the others, a wise precaution which has amply
justified itself.
It was a great pleasure to see so many beautiful and healthy birds,
and I felt very grateful to their owners for allowing me to visit them
and giving up so much time to showing me round.
We spent an afternoon in the Diisseldorf Zoo It has very few
birds, but I was struck with the number of carnivora which had been
bred, particularly as the compartments are so small. The most striking
exhibit was a herd of Oxen from Portuguese East Africa, with enor-
mously long horns standing practically erect on their heads. The weight
must be tremendous and one wonders what use they can be to the
animals.

COLONIZATION OF PARADISEA APODA ON

By P. L, Guppy
Historical
Sir William Ingram, the great newspaper proprietor, who owned
cocoa estates in Trinidad, conceived the idea of colonizing the Greater
Bird of Paradise (Paradisea apoda), on the island of Little Tobago.
To effect this purpose he was fortunate in securing the services of
Mr. Wilfred Frost who, in September, 1909, released twenty-four
males and twenty-four females (two females ? were later added to this
colony) on Little Tobago. A caretaker was left in charge and arrange-
ments made by Mr. Frost for protection and care of the colony after
he had accomplished his task.
Sir William Ingram died in 1924 and the island passed to his widow
for lifeshe died the following year. On 28th May, 1928, a deed was
drawn up by the heirs of Sir William Ingram conveying the island
and the Paradise Birds to the Government of Trinidad and Tobago.
Description op Little Tobago
The area of the island is about 250 acres, it is well covered with
vegetation; in fact, there is considerable diversity of plant life. The
island is hilly, the highest point being 470 feet. In parts the ground
is steep and difficult of access ; these conditions, with the deep valleys
between the hills, afford excellent cover for the birds.
As indicated in the accompanying sketch-map, the island lies to
windward of the main island ; the channel separating the two islands
is about 2J miles wide. The only suitable landing place is on the
western side facing the main island, where the water is usually fairly
calm. Strong breezes blow on the eastern side which faces the Atlantic
and produce turbulent seas nearly all the year round. There is a dry
period, usually from January to June ; the rains commence in the
latter month, gradually, with showery weather, then fairly heavy
rains set in towards the end of the year. There is always plenty of
sunshine, however, between the showers; the atmosphere is seldom
misty.

Palms, trees, shrubs and a variety of creepers, many producing
berries and fruit, grow in profusion. Some trees reach a considerable
height. Most conspicuous and beautiful is the Silver Thatch Palm
(Thrinax argentea), which grows in thick groves in valleys and on hill-
sides. Fairly tall trees are " Clammy Cherry ", or " Manjack 55 (Cordia
colococca), " Bay tree " (Pimenta acris), " Fiddlewood " (Citharexylum
spinosum).
Cacti grow in profusion all round the rocky border of the Island,
i.e. Epiphyllum hookeri and Hylocereus lemairei, which fruit abundantly.
Figure I shows the position of Little Tobago at the north-eastern extremity of
Tobago.
Figure 2 shows the position of Tobago 20 miles to the north-east of Trinidad.
The "Wild Plantain ", or "Wild Banana " (Helicobia bihai), with
boat-shaped flower sheaths, also Bromeliaceae that cling to trees and
rocks provide natural containers for water. Bananas and Pawpaw
(Carica papaya) were cultivated to ensure a constant supply of food
for the birds ; most of these had degenerated when last seen in 1929,
but were being replanted. Besides fruit, berries, etc., there are
numerous creatures that live under rotting leaves on ground, in decaying
wood, and in crevices of bark on trees, such as Ants' eggs, Termites,
Spiders, Scorpions, Cockroaches, Centipedes, Earthworms, and other
similar forms of life. Snails were observed to be fairly plentiful.
Wild Birds
The Paradise Birds have numerous wild birds on their island to
share in these supplies of food that nature has provided there. The

most noticeable of these are : " The Yellow Tail " ( Ostinops decumanus ),
"King of the Woods" ( Momotus swainsoni), "Mocking Thrush"
(Mimus gilvus), " Yellow-eyed Thrush " ( Merula gymnophthalmus ),
" Wren " ( Troglodytes rufulus ), Doves and Pigeons ; Gulls, Terns,
Cormorants and other sea birds plentiful, some nesting, others flying
around, all busy and noisy. It is most interesting to note that the
Domestic Fowl has developed into a secretive and wary bird. Cocks
are frequently heard crowing, hens clucking, chicks calling, but it is
difficult to get a fleeting glance at one of these. The slightest noise
of footsteps and the familiar sounds cease. Pendant pear-shaped
nests of Ostinops decumanus are seen hanging from ends of branches
in conspicuous places. This bird is a pest, it should be driven off the
island, no doubt it consumes the food the Paradise Birds require.
It is pleasing to be able to record that both on Little Tobago
and the main island " wild " birds are remarkably free from fear of
man, so that one is able to see them to advantage as they are not anxious
to take cover.
Notes on the Habits of Paradisea apoda
Since these birds were released on the island in 1909 all efforts
to locate nesting-places have failed, no eggs or nests have been seen.
Some time in 1923-24 attempts were made to snare the birds ; all
efforts to capture them however proved unsuccessful. Observations
with a good glass were made from the caretaker's house, which
commands a good view of a well-wooded spot in the vicinity ; at this
spot there is a tall tree which was much frequented by a large full-
plumaged male, accompanied by other Paradise Birds which always
came to his calls. It was observed that whenever attempts were made
to snare the birds on a " favourite " tree much frequented by a big
male with his attendants (usually six to ten in number), this tree was
either avoided or care was taken to ascertain before entering the
tree that conditions were normal. In this way similar attempts at
snaring were frustrated by the caution and sagacity of the old males.
Visits to Little Tobago were made by the writer in June and August,
1929, and again in April, 1930. My visits in 1929 were in the " wet "
season ; Paradise Birds were neither seen nor heard, but in April

this year four birds were seen ; they were very vociferous ; two of these
appeared to be females ; the males were in full feather ; the latter were
among the Thrinax palms, the females on a " Clammy Cherry " tree.
Friends who have paid visits to the island recently state that they have
seen between five and six males in good plumage on each occasion.
The birds seem to prefer the elevated ground on the sheltered well-
covered side of the island where the timber trees are of more luxuriant
growth ; the vegetation on the eastern side being stunted and sparse
is not frequented, except when the cacti are fruiting, and then they
would be attracted to this exposed area.
The Paradise Birds can be heard some distance out to sea when
they are calling in the mornings or late afternoons ; the writer has
heard them half a mile out to sea when approaching the island ; fisher-
men passing the island in their boats sometimes hear the birds. Now
that the Government of Trinidad and Tobago have taken control of
the island, it will be interesting to watch developments, as fruit trees,
timber trees, etc., are being planted and provisions made for ample
water supply.
Regarding the reported appearance of a young female Paradise
Bird on the main island some years ago, the writer is not able to confirm
this ; his property " Agenza ", where it was seen, is the nearest point
to Little Tobago. The writer and others who can be relied on in this
connection have never seen one of these birds at any time on the main
island. Conditions on the main island, which is 114 square miles,
would be ideal for colonizing Paradise Birds.

A. F. Moody--Death of an American White or Whooping Crane 9
This example was purchased fully adult in 1892 and was, therefore,
at least 40 years of age.
In appearance this stately great white bird (pure white with black
primaries and a small dark head patch), except for colour, more closely
resembled the European Crane (Grus communis) than any other member
of the genus Grus. That is, it equals that bird in size, resembles it
in contour and habits, and possesses a wild musical call distinct yet
not very dissimilar.
During the latter years of its existence, no companion of its own
kind being available, this example consorted with a female Manchurian
Crane (Grus japonensis). This attachment ripened to the extent that
both birds annually shared the same nest and, although the American
bird did not of recent years lay, it invariably took its turn at guarding
and sitting upon the unfertile eggs of the Manchurian bird. I believe
the Whooping Crane was so named from a fancied resemblance of
its occasionally uttered loud piercing cry to the whoop or yell of the
savage when rushing to battle. It was at one time abundant over the
whole of Central North America. In recent years, however, although
very little data is available, I understand that the species has become
almost exterminated from wheat lands, marsh and prairie, until at
the present time less than a score individuals represent the whole
race. These I understand have retreated to certain more or less
inaccessible ground where, in spite of some protection being afforded
by man, they hold a precarious footing owing to the young being much
harassed by their natural enemies, coyotes, eagles, etc.
The earliest mention I can find of this fine Crane appears to be in
1594 when, as referred to by more than one writer, Captains Amadas
and Marlow, landing on the island of Wokokou in July; found great
numbers of Crane, for the most part white, and describes the noise they
made "as if an army of men had all shouted together
During the early part of the last century too, they must have
existed in immense numbers. An eye witness of the vast hoards then
on migration down the Mississippi in December, 1811, writes :--
" The clangour of these immense legions passing along high in mid-
air seemed almost deafening ; the confused cry of the vast army
continued with the lengthening procession, and as the vocal call

continued nearly throughout the whole night without intermission,
some idea may be formed of the immensity of the numbers now
assembled in their annual journey to the regions of the South
References to the species a century later are not pleasant reading,
and include :--The late Mr. H. D. Astley, 1907, Aviculture Magazine,
Vol. Y, p. 348 :--
" A pair still exist in the Zoological Gardens at Amsterdam but
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.998060793103448" page_id="56181649"  page_num="10" year="" vol="">
there are probably not many more in the world ".
Dr. J. C. Phillips, Wenham, Mass., U.S.A., 1912, writes
(Avicultural Magazine, 3rd Series, Vol. Ill, p. 223) :--
" Those interested in the Crane family will mourn the loss of our
splendid Whooping Crane, gone probably for ever. The last published
observation of this species that I know about was made by Ferry
(Auk, vol. 27, p. 195), who noted an individual at Quill Lake,
Saskatchewan, 14th July, 1909. E. H. Seton, in his book Arctic Prairies,
on page 287 noted five Whoopers flying overhead in the Attrabaska
River, 16th October, 1907. These are, perhaps, the last that will
ever be seen in the wild."
The same contributor in this magazine two months later, page 288,
modified the above by writing :--
" I have some further evidence of the existence of the American
Whooping Crane which a short time ago I thought was either extinct
or on the verge of extinction. Mr. Charles W. Ward writes me that
he saw ' altogether about a dozen Cranes ? along the Gulf Coast of
Louisiana during February, 1912, and Mr. Mcllhenny, of Avery Island,
La., confirms this in a letter to me, in which he states there are still
a few between Vermillion Bay and the Texas line."
Twice verbally I have had news of this fine species. Once in 1914
when a so-called sportsman described the great bravery on his part
required in the dispatching of a wounded bird.
Again in 1927 when an ornithologist who had travelled 2,000 miles
to visit their ground was able to pick up four with a glass at a distance
of two miles. Rightly or wrongly, wrongly I hope, this gentleman came
away with the impression that there were but nine left.
To aviculturists and naturalists alike the demise of the Lilford
example, probably the last of its kind in Europe, suggests tragedy,

for undoubtedly such was the hardiness and adaptability of the species
in confinement that had in earlier years a mate been procurable the
species would most assuredly have bred and probably, like certain others

By Professor A. Ghigi and J. Delacour
Turkeys are the largest gallinaceous birds. They are natives of
North and Central America and are very closely related to the
Pheasants.
In spite of their size Turkeys have elegant figures for they are
slender and long-legged. Their heads and necks are bare and provided
with caruncles of very varying shapes, coloured red or yellow changing
into blue or green, like little warts, and which, especially in the cocks,
are like coral in the breeding season.
In the middle of the forehead is a long, erectile, conical protuberance,
which when the cock displays falls on one side of the beak. In the
middle of the breast there is always a tuft of very long thick hairs,
like a brush. All their feathers, except the flights which are shaped
like those of other gallinaceous birds, are truncated at the tip and
metallic. The tail consists of eighteen nearly equal feathers. Their
feet have scales as in Pheasants, and not as in Guinea-fowl, and the
cocks have spurs which are not very important considering the size
of the bird.
The differences between the sexes are evident though not as marked
as in Pheasants. They comprise size, development of the caruncles
and the pectoral brush as well as the metallic lustre of the plumage,
which is much brighter on the cocks.
Turkeys are polygamous and sociable. When they were still
common in the wild state a flock of a hundred or more might be seen,
cocks and hens and their young. At the beginning of winter these
birds migrated from North Virginia and Pennsylvania to Texas,

Louisiana, and Florida ; even large rivers did not stop their journey.
Now Wild Turkeys are very rare, but there are still a few in the
mountains of Virginia and Pennsylvania, and the forests of Florida,
in Texas and California, and, most commonly, on the high Mexican
plateaux.
Wild Turkeys display like the domestic kinds, but they are
exceedingly active and fly like Peafowl; like them, too, they perch
on the tops of trees. The hen, about April, lays twelve to fifteen
eggs in a well-secluded nest. One pairing is enough to ensure fertiliza-
tion of all the eggs. Incubation lasts from twenty-seven to twenty-
eight days. If their eggs are taken a second clutch is laid. They are
yellowish white with reddish brown spots. The poults have tawny
down with brown markings ; they are like Peachicks in colour but
not shape.
They are reared very much like Peachicks ; but young Turkeys
must not be soaked with rain or dew, nor run about in hot sun. It
is a good plan to shut the mother or foster-mother up in a coop for two
months until the young have developed their caruncles. But they
absolutely must run free after the first fortnight. In England and
at Cleres young birds are reared thus without difficulty even in the
wettest summers, like young Peafowl. Given absolute freedom in large
woods they thrive extremely well. Their food is the same as is given
to Peachicks--custard, chopped green stuff, biscuit, bread soaked in
water, maize flour and silkworm pupae.
The Wild Turkey (Meleagris americana) belongs to the genus
which bears the distinguishing marks enumerated above. It is like
the domestic bronzed bird, but its plumage has a brighter metallic
lustre, it is smaller, slighter, and in both sexes the caruncles are much
less developed. The feathers of the rump are edged with chestnut.
It inhabits the eastern parts of North America from Pennsylvania
to Florida, where is a slightly different race, M. a osceola.
The Wild Turkey has been imported several times to Europe and
flocks are living at Cleres in France and at the Zoological Park at
Whipsnade in Bedfordshire.
The Mexican Turkey (M. gallopavo) of W. America and Mexico
has white edged feathers of the rump. This is the ancestor of the

farmyard Turkey which was domesticated as far back as the time of
the Aztecs. Domestic Turkeys still retain the white edges to the feathers
of the rump. It may be remembered that the Turkey was the only
domestic animal of the civilized people of old Mexico.
The Ocellated Turkey (M. ocellata) forms the second and
last branch of the family. It lives in the dry forests of the Mexican
States : Chiapas, Campeche, Yucatan, Peten in Guatemala, and British
Honduras. It is a magnificent bird, rivalling the Peacocks and Monaul
Pheasant; its plumage is like silk with the colours of gold, sapphire,
and rubies ; its rectrices and coverts have terminal eyes. Its bare head
is blue and the warts and frontal protuberance are yellow ; legs red.
One of us saw in 1912 a living pair of these birds at Hagenbeck's
in Stellingen and two hens which flourished in the Berlin Zoological
Gardens. About the same time a pair lived in the London Zoological
Gardens, where the cock survived until quite recently.
We have never seen it in N. American zoos. It is said to be very
difficult to preserve them alive when captured, as they become
frightened and kill themselves. But this could be provided against
with proper care and packing just as with the wilder Pheasants.
The Ocellated Turkey is bronze green ; its feathers edged with
tan colour and black subterminal line ; its wings are black and white,
with the great coverts copper coloured and the lesser bronze green.
Its tail feathers, rectrices, and coverts are brown with black stripes
and a large terminal eye in bronze green and coppery yellow.
It is uncertain if this splendid species has ever been reared in
confinement, but hybrids between it and the wild Turkey have been
obtained in Europe. Once acclimatized it would seem to be hardy and
.strong, but to require heat and careful treatment at first.
GUINEA-FOWL
By Professor A. Ghigi
Guinea-fowl are distinct from Pheasants, and belong to the family
Numididce, a name derived from Numida, the genus to which the
-common Guinea-fowl belongs.

among tlie cocks, with the exception of two species. Their wings
reach to the root of the tail and its feathers, except among the
Vulturines, are very short; the tail-coverts are about as long as the
rectrices. But the characteristics which are the peculiar mark of this
family lie in their heads, the scales on the posterior of the tarsus and
in the colour of their plumage, which is exactly alike in both sexes.
Their heads and necks are usually bald save for a few scattered
hair-like feathers. Regarding the scales on the tarsi, the Guinea-fowl
have them pentagonal, more or less reduced and forming a distinct
line ; while with Pheasants a row of large transversal scales covers
the posterior part. This characteristic is less noticeable in the genera
Phasidus and Agelastes.
The plumage of adult Guinea-fowl is almost uniformly speckled
with little white or blue pearl-shaped dots ; exceptions are the Phasidce,
which are almost black, and the Agelastes, which have pale pencillings
on a darker ground, and the young of other species which are striped
with brown and yellow.
Guinea-fowl are found in Africa and Madagascar.
They are, according to genus, birds of the plain or of the forest
and always roost in trees. They like to flock together sometimes in
great numbers, and at times wander from their original habitat and
become vagrants, but in the breeding season they separate into pairs,,
and the cock very often takes a share in rearing the young. The hen
lays a large number of eggs ; a clutch usually numbers twelve to
eighteen eggs ; if they are taken she lays a second, third, and even
a fourth time, so that one can obtain forty or more eggs from a single
pair in a season.
Incubation lasts from twenty-three to twenty-seven days according
to the species ; the eggs are rather small, reddish or buff in colour,
almost uniform and much shorter than those of Pheasants, obtuse at
the end where the air chamber is situated and pointed at the other.
The shell is very hard and very difficult to break.
Newly hatched young birds are closely covered with down without
a trace of flight feathers ; their orange beaks and legs are thick and.
strong. They are more easily reared than Pheasants, but must be
protected from dew and the mid-day sun until they are a month old..

Pheasant coops can be used ; a Turkey hen is the best foster-mother
as the chicks will stay with her until the spring after they were hatched,
whereas a hen would leave them within fifty days. It is not necessary
to give them fresh ants' eggs, but the chicks must be able to wander
from their mother in search of insects and green food. The custard
usually given to Pheasants suits them well, but a large proportion of
chicory should be mixed with it.
Though Guinea-fowl are easily reared, it is very hard to induce adult
imported birds to breed. They hardly ever lay in an aviary, but require
large enclosures in which they can be kept by pinioning or clipping
the six primaries of one wing. The equatorial species feel the cold
very much and must be shut up for the winter in a heated place. If
this precaution is observed, Guinea-fowl are strong birds and less
subject to illness than Pheasants. With the exception of the Vulturine
it is rare for them to be attacked by diphtheria or influenza. As they
feed on surface insects and do not dig deeply, they do not often swallow
earthworms and even in infected places are usually immune from red-
worm. They may, however, be attacked by poultry cholera and
avian fever.
With Elliot we may distinguish two sub-families of Guniea-fowl,
the Agelastince and the Numidince.
The Agelastince are not pearl spotted. They have transversal
scales at the back of the tarsus, and the scales are only partly
imbricated ; the cocks have spurs. These birds are the link between
Francolins and true Guinea-fowl. Only two species are known ; the
Black Guinea-fowl (Phasidus niger) and the Turkey-like Guinea-fowl
(Agelastes meleagris). Their habits are very little known, and no living
importation has been brought to our notice.
The Black Guinea-fowl has head and neck bare except for a very
short crest running from the base of the beak to the occiput. Its tail
is composed of fourteen rectrices. The crest is black, all the rest of
its plumages is brown with very narrow stripes which are rather deep
yellowish brown ; it is the size of a small Guinea-fowl. This bird
inhabits forests in W. Africa from Cape Lopez to the Loango territory.
The Turkey-like Guinea-fowl has a red featherless head and
neck, except that the hinder part of the latter is milk-white. Its

anterior plumage is white, and the rest black finely pencilled with white.
This bird, whose habits are unknown, is found from Liberia to Gaboon.
The True Guinea-fowl
The Numidince or true Guinea-fowl are spotted with white or blue.
The hinder portion of their legs is covered with more or less pentagonal
scales. There are no true spurs, but the male and female Yulturines
have more or less developed and numerous tubercles. The Guinea-fowl
are divided into three genera--the Yulturine (Acryllium), the Crested
(Guttera), and the Helmeted ( Numida ).
The Vulturine Guinea-fowl (Acryllium vulturinium) is a fine
bird, as handsome as the best Pheasant. It is&apos;taller and larger than
the other kinds, and has a long thin neck and very small bare head,
which wears a collarette of very short feathers like a velvet band
from one ear to the other. The breast feathers are very long and lancet
shaped, black with white pencilling in the middle and edged with blue.
The two middle rectrices are much longer than the laterals. All the
upper parts are powdered with little white spots encircled with black.
The breast is black in the middle with two large patches of cobalt-
blue on the sides. The flanks are blue with white spots bordered with
lilac, and the outer edges of the secondaries are of the same colour.
The head and neck are grey, the eyes red.
The young are like those of the common Guinea-fowl, only their
heads are spotted, not striped, with black. When feathered they are
clearly striped black and white on the neck and breast, and with black
and tawny yellow on the back.
Vulturines inhabit the driest and most arid Acacia woods from
Somaliland to Zanzibar and Kilimanjaro.
These birds are very often imported into Europe because of their
great beauty and elegance ; but they stand cold and damp very badly.
We have for some years been receiving them and kept them at liberty
at the experimental station of Aviculture at Bovigo, giving them shelter
in winter. This year for the first time two hens, which we had kept
two years, laid, and we have thirteen chicks, unfortunately not hatched
until the end of August Although they are very vigorous we have small
hope that they will survive the winter.

The Crested Guinea-fowl (Guttera) have a thick straight top-
knot of long black feathers of which the hindmost usually cover the
occiput as well. These feathers spring from a small adipose cushion
in the middle of the forehead. The head and neck are bare otherwise,
and the skin is of a different colour and prolonged at the base by a
fold which makes two appendages in front. Sometimes there are
very small tufts at the base of the upper mandible, but these are well
developed only in G. plumifera.
The size and shape are very much the same as the Common Guinea-
fowl ; the plumage is black, uniformly sprinkled with blue pearl-shaped
spots. The outer edges of the five largest secondaries are white.
The Crested Guinea-fowl belong to tropical Africa down to the
Transvaal. They are birds of the thick damp forests. They utter
curious sounds at evening which recall a military tattoo, and may be
imitated by " tatti tatti tatti tattarara tattarara tattarara ", said
several times over with varying rapidity. The specific differences
are not marked ; they lie chiefly in the tufts, the shape of the topknot,
the colour of the bare skin of the head and neck, the absence or presence
of the black collar. Perhaps one might very justly look on all the
Crested Guinea-fowl, except G. jplumifera, as forms of one species.
Guttera cristata, W. Africa from Sierra Leone to Togo, has a blue
head and neck, red throat, and a black collar.
G. seth-smithi, from Lakes Abert and Albert-Edward, has darker
blue spots.
G. puckerani, from Jubaland and bordering regions, has no black
collar ; its cheeks, throat, and back of the head are red. The variety
granti from Ugogo has a black collar, and the contiguous variety
suahelica has less red on the cheeks.
G. barbata from Makonda has no red on the bare skin of head and
neck, and its black collar descends to the middle of its breast.
G. lividicollis from Zambesia is dirty white on the back of the neck
and ears, and the very deep black collar is shot with deep chestnut
as are likewise the little circles round the blue spots.
G. edouardi from Natal is like the above but has a red throat like
G. cristata.
G. sclateri from the Cameroons is coloured like G. cristata but its
crest is very short in front.

Guttera plumifera may be a species and not merely a variety, as
it has two blue tufts at the base of the beak and its crest is shaped
quite differently, like a kind of short brush in front and very long at
the back. It has no black collar and every neck feather is terminated
with a large pearl-shaped spot. This species is distributed in W. Africa
from the Cameroons to Loango.
The Crested Guinea-fowl are very rarely imported and only in small
numbers. They need protection during winter.
The varieties we know certainly to have been imported are :
G. cristata , pucherani, seth-smithi, barbata, and lividicollis . G. puckerani
laid once in England ; in Italy, with me, a hen barbata paired with a
cock lividicollis has laid regularly for the last three years. Each clutch
consists of eight to twelve eggs. Incubation lasts twenty-three days.
The chicks have a large blue spot on the head and are very pretty.
They assume adult plumage and are as large as their parents at five
months old.
The Helmeted Guinea-fowls ( Numida ) are distinguished by
a protuberance of the frontal bones of the head, covered with a horny
case, and two cartilaginous wattles at the base of the upper jaw. The
nostrils are covered with a fold of flesh ; the cheeks and more or less
of the neck and nape are also caruncled, differently coloured and
scantily feathered, the barbs so reduced as to be transformed into
hair. The legs are covered in front by transverse scales, but at the
back only with little pentagonal scales. The tail is made up of sixteen
feathers, short and round at the tips ; the middle feathers are scarcely
longer than the laterals. The tail-coverts are nearly as long as the
rectrices. The plumage is black or dark grey, speckled with pearly
white dots ; in some species the spots on the flights are joined and
form transverse stripes.
There is little difference between the sexes ; the cock is usually
slightly larger, and his helmet and tufts are more developed. His
display is peculiar ; he runs backwards and forwards, opening and
raising his wings ; the hen only utters the very worrying call which
may be rendered by the syllables coquah , coquah , coquah.
Helmeted Guinea-fowls are birds of the open plains and prefer
to live in large flocks ; but they are also found on mountains. They

lay numerous eggs ; incubation lasts twenty-five days. The eggs are
red, short, very oval, and have very tough shells. The tawny, black,
and yellow spotted chicks are very lively and active in the pursuit
of insects.
The Domestic Guinea-fowl has been evolved from a species
(Numida galeata) which in the wild state inhabits W. Africa from
Senegal to the Niger and Cameroons, and is also found in the islands of
Cape Verde, Annobon, and St. Thomas. A form ( N . g. sabyi) is found
in Morocco. These Guinea-fowl are distinguished by the wine-coloured
unspotted feathers of their collars.
They are smaller than the domesticated variety and their helmets
and wattles are not so pronounced ; the first is the colour of wood,
and the second red ; their legs are black. These wild Guinea-fowl
are sometimes imported alive into Europe ; a hen paired with a domestic
cock has bred at liberty in Italy.
The Common Helmeted Guinea-fowl ( Numida meleagris) has
the helmet small pale waxy brown, as is all the top of the head. The
wattles are light blue, as well as the bare skin of the cheeks. The neck
is covered with transversely black and white striped feathers, and
a little black collarette the nape. The secondaries have a dull lilac
stripe on the outer edge.
It is a native of the high plateau of E. Africa, Abyssinia, Kenya,
and Yemen in Arabia. There are several races, of which N. p.
somaliensis is the most characteristic. It has very often been brought
to Europe, and has bred there.
The Mitbed Guinea-fowl (Numida mitrata) has long, narrow
wattles. Its helmet is large, wide at the base, and reddish ; the fore-
head, nape, and the points of the wattles are red ; all the other bare
parts, which are the same shape as those of N. galeata , are brilliant
blue-green, very distinctive. The neck at the base is striped black
and white.
The Mitred Guinea-fowl inhabits E. Africa from the Zambesi to
Mombasa, and as far as Lake Tanganyika in the interior ; and is also
found in Madagascar and the Comoro Islands. It is often imported,
but is a shy breeder ; however, at Rovigo in Italy young have been
obtained for several years, and also at Cleres.

The Breeding of the Crowned Pigeon
The whole of equatorial and meridional Africa is inhabited by
Guinea-fowl which ornithologists consider to be sub-species of the
Mitred Guinea-fowl.
We need not do more than mention the Crowned, whose very high
helmet covers all the cranial skull cap ; this is a large form ; it is found
in Africa, south of Natal, and the Transvaal.
Eeichenow's Guinea-fowl (Numidia reichenowi) has a helmet
which is higher than wide, and quite straight. The wattles are oval
and red all over. In head and plumage it is the same as mitrata. This
race inhabits the region round about Kilimanjaro as far as Lakes
Victoria Nyanza and Tanganyika. The two last-mentioned races
have sometimes been imported into Europe.
We have obtained many fertile hybrids between galeata and
meleagris , as well as between galeata and mitrata ; from this we may
deduce that the Helmeted Guinea-fowl really constitute one good
species, with several sub-species and geographical races.
THE BREEDING OF THE CROWNED PIGEON
In our American contemporary Aviculture for November, 1930,
Mr. A. A. Prestwich states that Goura coronata has never been bred
in Great Britain. This is quite a mistake. There are two records of
young being " hatched 53 in the London Zoological Gardens in 1874
and one in 1875, and it is recorded as having been " bred 35 in 1885,
1886, and 1887. Since my term of office at the Gardens commenced
this species has bred twice, once unsuccessfully (1913) and with complete
success in 1914. As this success was by some oversight never recorded
in the Avicultural Magazine, I am reproducing a photograph of
the young bird with its parents, taken on the 1st of September, 1914,
and printed in the Field of 19th September, 1914. According to my
notes made at the time and published with the photograph, the single
egg was laid in a nest formed of sticks on a wooden platform in the
Western Aviary. Both parents took turns in sitting and the egg
hatched on 25th July, the period of incubation being judged to have

The Emu for October, 1930, is a particularly interesting number.
Mr. H. G. Barnard and G. H. Barker supply an article on the genus
Platycucus, which is illustrated by a coloured plate of the Pale-headed
Rosella (P. adscitus). They tell us that these birds, in company with
others of the genus, have developed a liking for fruit and grain, in
consequence of which the farmer takes heavy toll of them to protect
his crops. " In the South some farmers have used poisoned grain with
great effect, and have carted away barrow-loads of dead birds as a
result."
Mr. Michael Sharland has been most successful in his endeavour
to photograph the Lyre Bird and has obtained some really first-rate
results illustrating the display of this wonderful bird, notwithstanding
the fact that in the subdued light amongst the dense foliage it was
necessary to give as much as seven seconds exposure. The photo-
graphs show that in display the tail is not held in the position that is
generally shown in illustrations, that is, in the form of a lyre, but
" spread fan-wise over its back until at times it concealed the head
and part of the body. The handsomely marked lyrate feathers of
the side of the tail were projected horizontally from the base, the
finer ones in the centre, glistening with a silvery white, forming the
shape of the fan."
It is known that young of the Pennant Parrakeet are generally
green in their first plumage, but that occasionally this green stage is
omitted and the red plumage assumed from the first. In this connection
Mr. C. Sullivan writes : " Do races of the Crimson Rosella differ in

the mode of acquiring the adult plumage ? At Daylesford, in Central
Victoria, the green immature form is fairly common. In South Gipps-
land Hills the green bird is exceedingly numerous. At Buchan, in
Eastern Victoria, the green form is rare. In the Dorrigo district,
out of many hundreds seen not one was in green plumage, the immature
birds here showing a green and black mantle with wing of blue and
scarlet. The green bird was not seen in the Nandewao Mountains,
40 miles south-east of Moree ... It is possible that the proportion
of green-plumaged birds may vary in the one district from year
to year."
It would appear that the male Satin Bower-bird, which normally
is green for the first six or seven years of its life, occasionally misses
out this green stage, for Mr. Sullivan mentions a friend of his who had
once seen " the rich blue-black plumage in a young bird that was
taken from the nest and was not yet fully feathered. The bird lived
in captivity for some years, during which time it retained the adult
plumage ".
The Natural History Magazine (published by the Trustees of the
British Museum) for October, 1930, contains an article by Viscount
Grey of Falloden on the habits and breeding of Mandarin and Carolina
Ducks. Lord Grey adopts the name of Wood Duck for the Carolina,
and it would be as well if this name were universally adopted, for it
is that by which it is known in its own country and is quite
appropriate. Moreover, there is no other species bearing the same name
except the Maned Goose of Australia, and in this case the name can
hardly be called well-chosen.
For ten years no Mandarins or Wood Ducks have been pinioned
at Falloden so that almost the whole of the stock is full-winged. The
birds nest in the trees, either in natural holes or in herring-barrels
which have been fastened in suitable places ; sometimes the two species
will lay in the same nest, but it is always the Wood Duck that incubates
and hatches the eggs. And so the sight of a Wood Duck with a mixed

brood is not uncommon. The young Mandarins are, however, consider-
ably hardier than the Wood Ducks, more intelligent and grow quicker.
Consequently, the Mandarin Duck is more than holding its own and
has spread over the neighbourhood.
Although Lord Grey's Ducks are full-winged they have become
very tame and at feeding-time come and settle upon the head and arms
of their owner as the excellent photographs which accompany the
article show.
In the November number of Aviculture Dr. Leon Patrick records
the successful breeding in his aviaries in California, of the Derbyan
Parrakeet.
Two young were reared successfully in a pen of 12 ft. by 12 ft.,
but we are not told of the type of nesting-box used. The young birds
resembled their parents but lacked the violet colour on the head.
" Both the young were born with both upper and lower mandible
an orange-red, just a shade lighter than the upper mandible of the
father bird. But now both mandibles are seemingly changing to
black ".
In the same number Mr. A. H. Isenberg records the breeding of
the Malay Glossy Starling, which, in this country, is usually termed
the Glossy Calorius, and is scientifically known as Lamprocorax
panayensis strigatus. The birds nested several times during the summer
in a log nest and although they hatched two young each time only
one survived.

my capacity as adviser to Cage Birds during the period from the summer
of 1924 until the present date, inclusive. During this period I have
been consulted on 683 cases, analysis of which are given in the following
table :
Meat and other animal foods definitely included in the diet,
517 cases.
Doubtful, i.e. cases in which Parrots already addicted to the vice
were purchased and the owners were unable to say how the birds were
fed before coming into their possession, 118 cases.
No meat given but egg and milk-sop offered occasionally and birds
fed on mixtures containing a very large proportion of hemp. Other-
wise fed on a rational diet of fruit, green foods, nuts, etc., 41 cases.
Birds fed on dry seed only, the exact composition of which is un-
certain, 7 cases.
My own personal experience goes to prove that Parrots fed on a
well-balanced mixture such as I have so frequently recommended
in Cage Birds , with plenty of green foods, fruit (apple, pear or grapes),
raw carrot, radish, onion, celery, swede, turnip, etc., a turf of grass
now and again, roots of dandelion and plantain with plenty of soil
adhering thereto, sprays of hawthorn, berries and all, and other freshly
cut soft greenwood, dry toast and dry biscuit, monkey nuts, beech-
mast, green peas and pea pods in season, ripening corn, etc., a charcoal
biscuit now and again and a bit of cuttlefish to chew, with a good
spraying once or twice weekly with borax and warm water never
develop this vice, and during a period of some twenty-five years in
which I have kept Parrots and Parrakeets of numerous varieties I have
never yet possessed a bird which developed this bad habit. I feel
confident that if all Parrots were fed as above and the diet varied as
much as possible on these lines feather-plucking would be practically
unknown.
Like Lord Tavistock, I am also convinced that hemp in any quantity
is bad for Parrots and also for Love-birds, and I believe it is certainly
the cause of the commencement of feather-plucking in some cases
at least. Two years ago I carried out an experiment in the effects of
hemp on Peach-faced Love-birds. I had at that time about a dozen
Peach-faces all in perfect health and condition. These birds were all

caged separately in pairs, and to four of these pairs I supplied a mixture
made up of two parts Spanish Canary, one part hemp and one part white
millet. After about eight weeks of this regime nearly all the hemp-
fed birds commenced plucking themselves and in six months time all
four pairs were practically naked, whilst the non-hemp fed two pairs
kept in beautiful glossy plumage natural to this species. On my
discontinuing the hemp and feeding on a staple of Spanish Canary
with a little millet added feather-plucking gradually ceased, and in
a few weeks' time all the birds with one exception were once again
almost fully clothed. The one exception remained in a practically
nude state for several months, and then gradually recovered until
once more fully clothed and in it's right mind. Whilst my own personal
experience and also the results of my work for Cage Birds go to prove
fairly conclusively that meat has a most baneful effect on Parrots,
I am quite prepared to believe or be convinced that it may in certain
isolated cases and over a very limited period prove beneficial. I should
imagine, however, that the only birds which might possibly benefit
would be individuals which had been fed over a very long period on
nothing but dry hard seeds alone. It would be certainly odd if strong
butcher's meat upon which even carnivorous birds such as Hawks
are unable to thrive, and to the unrestrained consumption of which
so many human disorders are directly due, should none the less prove
beneficial to non-carniverous birds such as Parrots.
G. E. Kattigan.
Sir,--A case of feather-plucking which occurred in the aviaries
belonging to Mr. Spedan Lewis may be worth recording, as it runs
counter to any that I have so far come across.
We bought a fine Bouquet's Amazon in the winter of 1929 ; it
had an injured wing, but was otherwise in perfect condition and
plumage and a very quiet bird. We kept it in a cage for about three
months and then, thinking it would enjoy comparative freedom,
turned it into a large flight aviary with other Parrots, chiefly Amazons.
It lived at peace with them and seemed quite happy, but after moulting
it suddenly began to pluck itself furiously, and at the end of three weeks
it literally had not a single feather on its body. It looked like some

furry animal with a birds' head stuck on its shoulders. Seeing its
miserable condition I was disposed to have it destroyed, but the aviary
attendant was so anxious to try if it could be cured that I allowed it
to live. He caged it and took it to his own house. It had been fed
throughout on a mixture of sunflower, wheat, and monkey nuts,
shelled and unshelled, with fruit--banana, orange, or apple, according
to the season.
In the aviary it had a large bath always at its disposal and plenty
of grit and green stuff. In the cage it was regularly sprayed and given
natural perches, but did not as a rule destroy them. After some weeks
I saw the bird was growing a fresh crop of feathers and so far leaving
them alone. By spring it was in full plumage and did not return to its
bad ways. An apple-tree was blown down in the winter and I gave the
branches to the Parrots. The Bouquet was particularly keen on
stripping the bark and ate a quantity which seemed to act as a tonic
digestive.
It was again turned into an aviary last summer, but was there only
a few weeks before it recommenced plucking itself. As soon as it was
replaced in its cage it left off.
It is now under the capable management of the Marquis of Tavistock,
and I shall be curious to know how it behaves in its new home. It
is a fine bird and at present in perfect plumage save for the flight
feathers of the injured wing. Long may it remain so !

Sir, --My experience is that no Starling, with the possible exception
of the Amethyst Starling, can be considered safe with small birds.
They may live peaceably together for months, even years, but sooner
or later a Starling is certain to go berserk and kill without rhyme or
reason, whether breeding or not. In my aviaries at Lyndhurst I had
a special compartment known as " the murderer's cage ", and seldom
indeed was it not tenanted by a Starling of some kind. Why this
murderous fit should occur I cannot say, but it comes on suddenly
without the slightest warning and as a rule leaves the unfortunate
owner lamenting his choicest birds.

Sir, --It is a curious fact, although, one, of course, familiar to all
aviculturists, that some species of birds from tropical regions are
perfectly hardy, while others from the same region are as sensitive
to cold as one would expect. The Asiatic King Parrakeets, for example,
endure without harm our most severe winters, while the majority,
though not all, of the Lories, require a fair amount of heat, anyhow
in their aviary shelters. A most sad catastrophe which recently
happened in my bird-room shows that just as tropical birds vary in their
ability to stand extreme cold, so do they also vary in their ability to
stand extreme heat. A few days ago I obtained from Mr. Goodfellow's
collection an exceptionally fine cock Green Broadbill as a mate for
a hen I have had nearly a year ; also a unique specimen of the insecti-
vorous Red-and-black Broadbill, new, of course, to aviculture and
a most quaint bird upon which I hoped to make many interesting
observations. All went well until one ill-omened day when the repair
of the electric cable necessitated the cutting off of the normal heating
apparatus and the substitution of petrol heaters. In the evening
the electric heating was resumed but, owing to a misunderstanding
between my two aviary attendants, neither visited the bird-room
to remove the petrol heaters. The result was that early next morning
I found the birdroom up to a fearful temperature (it cannot have been
far short of 115*), and both poor Broadbills dead in their cages ! Strange
to say, however, none of the other inmates of the furnace--a Rajah
Sunbird, a pair of Eairy Bluebirds, a Racket-tailed Parrot, a Bayard's
Parrakeet, three Blue-winged Grass Parrakeets, and a Rosenberg's
Lorikeet were so much as panting !
It is almost superfluous to add that had the aviary attendants'
mistake occurred on any other day of the 365 no damage would have
been done as the heating apparatus in ordinary use can run for long
periods without attention.

SUN CONURES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99718064516129" page_id="56181671"  page_num="28" year="" vol="">
Sir, --During the summer a pair of Sun Conures (Aratinga solstitialis)
occupied an aviary next to my Princess of Wales and Crimson-wing
Hybrid. The latter is a lively bird and has a display in character
somewhat intermediate between that of the parent species, i.e. he
elongates his neck, maintaining a rigid attitude for a few moments
while the pupil of his eye contracts and his plumage is drawn tight;
then he makes a brief, rapid advance and resumes the more or less
rigid attitude, uttering during the course of the performance various
shrill cries. The display of Conures is, of course, utterly different;
they ruffle their feathers, flap their wings, and engage in various
grotesque squirmings.
The Sun Conures, to my disappointment and rather to my surprise,
proved very delicate birds, adversely affected by any lowering of the
temperature, although in excellent plumage and spirits. The accidental
going out of the heater in their shelter one quite mild night resulted in
both developing a severe chill which proved fatal to the hen. The
cock on recovery was perforce condemned to a solitary existence in
a cage in the birdroom and being very bored and lonely at once welcomed
the arrival of a Bouquet's Amazon, to whom he proceeded to make
advances when she was placed in a cage next his own. Strange to say,
however, he conducted his courtship, not after the orthodox fashion
of his race, but with all the calls and gestures of his late neighbour
the hybrid ! This appeared to me exceedingly strange, for not only
have I neyer heard of a bird substituting the display gestures of another
species for that of its own, but the Conure had been living in.Conure
society, i.e. with his own mate, as long as he had been in proximity
to the stranger. One might imagine that he had taken to heart the
Hybrid's scathing criticism of his amorous antics--" Call that a display !
Why any decent-minded hen would think you had the stomach-ache 1
This is how it should be done ! "

In May, 1929, Mr. Shaw Mayer brought home a wonderful collection
of birds from Papua. I have never seen birds landed in such perfect
condition, every bird being fit to show on any show bench. Among
the birds he had three perfectly beautiful White-and-Blue Kingfishers
which he got out of two nests and hand-reared. They were all perfectly
tame, and would sit on my hand and allow me to stroke them. I took
all three home and put them in a large aviary where they did very well
till last autumn (1930) when they suddenly died within a few days of
one another, I am afraid from the cold. I was very sorry to lose them,
and really cannot make out why they should be more delicate than
two or three other Kingfishers from Indo-China which I have had for
over three years and are still going strong. I fed them on fresh fish
cut up into narrow strips, and whenever I could get small fish in the
river they were given as a treat. They would eat meat, but I think
they much preferred fish. The coloured drawing by Mr. Roland Green
reproduces faithfully the colouring of the bird.

NOTES FROM A LANCASHIRE AVIARY
By Joseph Appleby
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991827545454546" page_id="56181679"  page_num="30" year="" vol="">
Some months ago there was a debate on " Possessions, or No
Possessions ", broadcast by the B.B.C. It was most interesting,
both points of view having much in their favour. Personally, I took
the side of the man with possessions. My wife took the other side,
hence another debate of a more intimate character, and I still hold
my possessions.
Now, birds are a possession demanding close personal attention,
and if one is not overburdened with this world's riches and so cannot
afford a paid attendant they are apt to restrict one's movements
about the face of the earth or else are sacrificed by being left to the
tender mercies of some well-meaning but unsuitable person not having
the aviary sense, to use Lord Tavistock's phrase.
That such a sense is born, not made, I have evidence, and as I have
no one to entrust my birds to my absences from home are short and
the type of bird kept such as can readily be replaced at a small cost.
As probably my position is similar to that of many of the members
of the Avicultural Society, there is a growing demand for information
upon the maintenance of this class of bird.
In the first instance, having made up one's mind that the Finch
or Seed-eater is the class of bird we intend to keep, the kind of aviary
is to be decided upon. Presuming that foreign Finches are kept in
quantity and one wishes to give them as good a time as one can in
England anywhere north of the Trent, two-thirds shelter and one-
third flight is the proportion I would allow, the shelter to be made to
close completely and be heated at any time of the year. A detail
that is seldom emphasized in regard to the flight is the height: this,
in my opinion, should not be more than 8 feet. If higher the birds
keep at the top and are difficult to see against the sky and are also
difficult to drive in at night when necessary. An opening high up
near the roof of shelter is very useful for this purpose, but I prefer
the main entrance to be of ample proportions nearer the ground, say,
3 feet up. All food and water to be given in the shelter ; no vermin
are then attracted.

In my last notes, Vol. VIII, No. 1, I mentioned that I hoped to
correct my mistake in not allowing more indoor accommodation.
This has now been done by converting a room 15 by 10 feet into a bird-
room, and if any reader happens to have a copy of the Magazine for
October, 1924, he will find therein a description of my aviary. Last
February I converted what had been my photographic dark room
into &amp; bird-room, very little alteration being necessary ; the principal
one was enlarging one window and glazing it with Vita glass and
removing the old wooden shelter that was falling into decay and was
of no further use. In this portion of the aviary, which I call the
warm aviaiy, are lodged all the birds that are inclined to feel our cold,
damp winters--Gouldian, Masked Grass, Bicheno, Cordon Bleu,
Lavender, Pectoral and Bengalee Finches, Golden-breasted, Senegal
and Orange-cheeked Waxbills, Silverbills, Fire Finches, and Combassous.
Though I have had Fire Finches, Senegal and Orange-cheeked
Waxbills in the other or cold aviary, I thought they would be happier
in the warm aviary, the temperature of which I maintain as near
60* F. as possible, the room having a radiator on the central
heating system of my house and being thoroughly ventilated. This
room acts as a sanatorium for birds out of sorts, they being put in
separate cages and fed and doctored according to their complaints.
So far it has come quite up to my expectations and I think has saved
me many birds. So much for the housing of small birds. Feeding
is the next and most important problem. I can only give my own
methods and mixtures, evolved after some considerable experience,
as suitable for various classes of birds, from Weavers, Whydahs, and
Canaries to Cordon Bleus and Golden-breasted Waxbills, including
Peking Bobins and Java Sparrows. All birds have the following
mixture, of which I buy 112 lb. at a time : 50 per cent white millet, 25
per cent Indian millet, 20 per cent small canary seed, and 1 per cent of
each of the following seeds : red millet, hemp, teazle, maw, and niger.
In the cold aviary, where are the larger and hardier birds, is a hopper
of the largest canary seed I can buy, and about an ounce of Spratt's
cod-liver oil cage birds 5 food is mixed fresh each day and placed in
a shrimp pot for them, and I may say is completely cleared up before
the next day.

<bodyText confidence="0.9972015" page_id="56181681"  page_num="32" year="" vol="">
The warm aviary birds have the mixture as above but no hopper
of canary and no soft food (they won't take it), but they are provided
with spray millet and in the season as much grass seed as I can find.
I have tried them with all kinds of so-called live food, but to no purpose,
perhaps because they get a liberal supply of mealworms; even
Gouldians will take them readily, which points to the fact that most
seed-eaters will take live food at times. The trials and tribulations
of an aviculturalist who keeps these small birds are many and varied,
but they are soon forgotten when one sees fifty or sixty bright-coloured,
active, and vociferous little birds enjoying life in the warm sunshine
of our summer days. The critical times seem to be three in number :
when first imported, the first month in England, and nesting-time,
particularly if the latter falls in our cold weather period. All
authorities agree that freshly imported birds should be caged for
a month at least; even then one may suffer severe losses due to many
causes, such as change of diet, water, or chill caught in transit from
shop to aviary, or even to fright. If birds could tell us where the
trouble was ! I find diagnozing a complaint very difficult and correct
treatment worse : far better to try to avoid illness. This; I am sure,
can best be achieved by providing warm sleeping quarters for new-
comers. If in poor condition, as they usually are, a drop or two of
Parrish's chemical food in their drinking water will help tone them up.
Later on, when their feathers are coming to normal, a drop of tincture
of iodine in the water gives a final tonic. Indicative of the fact that
they like the flavour of Parrish's, I have a cage in the warm bird-room
always ready, clean sand, seed, and water plus Parrish's : this I have
been in the habit of leaving open. I notice that several birds go to
drink there in preference to the large bathing-place of running water.
The drinker is usually nearly empty each morning.
Pneumonia, enteritis, or diarrhoea are the chief troubles I have to
deal with, and I can only say that those I save are few once attacked,
for on symptoms showing it is nearly always too late to begin doctoring.
Those birds that over-eat (fortunately few) one only discovers when
they drop dead in apparently perfect condition. Constipation may
be cured by castor oil or a crystal or two of sulphate of soda in the
drinker.

Moulting is best treated by giving Parrish's, cod-liver oil food,
and warmth ; that is, of course, if the moult is excessive or difficult in
the cold periods. This usually happens in our winter or spring with
Southern Hemisphere birds, so take care that new birds during their
first moult have warmth and nourishment. As regards nesting times,
the harder you can keep the birds the better the results, but I have
found it useless to try to harden semi-tropical birds in this part of
England. They may stand cold but they cannot stand damp. The
alternative is a room large enough for wing exercise, kept scrupulously
clean, well ventilated, yet warm. My Zebra Finches are and have been
for years in the cold aviary. They stand the cold and damp and are
a very robust little flock of sixteen at present. Grass Finches and
Gouldians I have to close up for the winter in October : some of the
others might stand the hardening treatment, but I doubt it. I cannot
claim any success in breeding the above-mentioned Australian Finches,
in two seasons having lost breeding hens through cold.
To sum up, warm sleeping quarters, plenty of light and air, clean,
sound seed, plenty of fresh water, running if possible, and scrupulous
cleanliness are essential to good results in aviculture.

For some weeks, or even months, I have been intending to send
a few odd notes to the Magazine, and Mr. Workman's article in the
October issue has brought me to the scratch ! I would urge with all
the insistence that I possess that a fresh attempt be made to carry
out his suggestion in the latter half of his first paragraph. An index
published at least every 10 years of articles on particular species indeed
" would be worth untold gold " ; many species that we keep are not
to be found in any book one possesses apart from the fact that if they
were no advice would be found as to keeping them in confinement,
and the index as described above is the one thing that would often
help us, and for some months past I have intended to write and advocate
it. Twenty-seven years may have impressed this fact on our readers.

Capt. John S. Reeve--Oddments
Mr. Editor, and I suggest you tell us in your next issue how much it
would cost us to have an index for the first thirty years and thereafter
every ten years ; from your note I gather we are thirty-five years old,
so that we should get another index five years hence : if all members
will agree to pay I will certainly pay my share.
I had the same misfortune this year with my Californian Quail,
the hen dying during incubation, but her husband did not prove such
a, good father as Mr. Workman's ! She laid in a Parrakeet nest-box
which had been left on the floor and, not knowing the eggs had been
incubated, I gave them to my keeper to put under a Partridge and
I believe they all went off pop ! Last year the same pair hatched
eleven young which I fed for some time on the food my keeper was
rearing some small Pheasants with and live ants' eggs : when about
half-grown five died within ten days ; I had also been giving them
latterly Indian millet; I knocked off the Pheasant food (egg, biscuit,
etc.), continuing the ants' eggs as long as I could, and they got on
to seed entirely, and the deaths ceased and three fine young cocks and
three hens went away to India.
In the same aviary a horrible scandal occurred, a cock Blue
Budgerigar making love to a hen White Java Sparrow, following her
everywhere she went, kissing her, and never leaving her ; she did not
seem to resent it unless he became a bit too familiar, when she would
give him an occasional peck ! The Javas bred in 1929 but not in 1930,
nor did the Budgerigars, and presumably Mr. Budgerigar's love craze
broke up two happy homes.
I have very little success to report for last season. Golden-breasted
Waxbills built in a birch faggot and laid four eggs, which began to
hatch on 6th October. On the 26th two young flew, and these are
to-day (9th December) showing a pinky mark on the beak and just
a touch of yellow below the throat, the bills having been black and
the general coloration greyish brown, wings darker ; they have been
out of doors everyday, and nothing but millet (both kinds), canary,
and soft food have been available.

Having now had the opportunity of studying the behaviour of
this rare and curious bird, further notes on its habits may be not
without interest.
For some weeks after arrival the Parrakeet was kept in a flight
cage in the bird-room where, on account of the presence of new additions
from tropical lands, the temperature was kept rather high. When
dealing with a species almost new to aviculture and known to be
unlike most of its relatives in its mode of life, one is always rather in
the dark as to what the best kind of treatment may be. Antipodes

Island, from all accounts, possesses a most ungenial climate, but at
the same time I was uncertain about the wisdom of turning out in
late autumn a bird which had recently passed through the tropics.
For a time the Antipodes Island did well enough, but there came a day
when I did not like the look of her though she showed no very definite
illness. She seemed mopy and off her food, and thinking that the
bird-room was too stuffy for her I decided to take the risk of moving
her into one of the Finches' aviaries which had a heated shelter and
an outdoor flight. In a couple of days she was a different bird, and
all need for anxiety vanished and in time she was promoted to one of
the movable aviaries where at present she is having no heat at all,
has finished her moult, and is in show condition.
On turning her out I discovered certain interesting peculiarities
due no doubt to her entirely terrestrial existence in her native haunts.
Unlike any other psittacine bird I have kept, she cannot climb wire
netting with beak and feet--she can only fly up and cling to it without
moving. She is also quite incapable of perching on twigs. Thick
perches she can manage and uses freely, but with the rather clumsy
action of a domestic Pigeon whom Nature intended to negotiate rock
ledges only. She is a very lively bird--in fact the most active and
restless Parrakeet I have ever kept, constantly on the move, flying
up and down the aviary and running along the perches and about
the ground for long periods at a stretch. Some of her calls are very
like those of the Norfolk Island--a soft, plaintive murmur and a kind
of nasal bleat, but in addition she has a rather louder call of seven
syllables, " Kitty-te-kee-te-kittuck " also uttered with a nasal and
" tinny " intonation. Her plumage has the appearance of being
very thick and she is supremely indifferent to the beastliest weather;
in fact a cold fog accompanied by frost exhilarates her more than
anything else ! She is not exactly tame but is very fearless and
inquisitive, approaching readily to within a couple of feet or less.
She has plenty of sense and learned her way about the aviary and
in and out of the small entrance hole leading to the shelter without
the least trouble or delay. She goes into the shelter at night of her
own accord, roosting on a ledge, or on a perch if one is provided thick
enough for her comfort. She still obstinately refuses to vary her diet

In May, 1927, Mr. Chapman received a consignment of birds from
Tanganyika Territory containing Blue-headed Waxbills among other
rarities. They had never been brought over to Europe. All these
Waxbills did not remain in England, and I was fortunate enough to
find two pairs at a bird-dealer's in Paris in October. They were in
very good condition and I brought them home hoping to breed from
them some day ! Unfortunately the cocks died during the winter
without any noticeable cause ; they had not appeared to be ill a single
day. The body of the second cock that died was sent to a veterinary
surgeon, who did not find anything wrong with it. They may have
been frightened during the night and have killed themselves against
the wire bars of their cage. They were living then in a large cage in
my bird-room. The remaining hens spent the following year in a large
indoor aviary with other small birds. In April, 1929, I let them fly in
an outdoor aviary containing Grass Pinches and Waxbills, among
which were two pairs of Senegal Cordon Bleus. One of these died
egg-bound in May and I did not replace her. The widower very soon
began to court one of his Blue-headed companions : with a stem of
grass in his bill he sang and displayed before her. The nest was made
in a deal box in the shelter of the aviary; it was built with fine hay
and feathers, like all the nests of the Cordon Bleus. When I examined
it about a fortnight later it contained nine eggs : it was evident that
both hens had laid in it. They incubated these, with the cock, sitting
by turns. Only four eggs hatched out, so one may infer that the
cock paired with one hen only. However, the two hens fed the

youngsters, which, left the nest when about three weeks old. Like
all the young Waxbills they were fed on millet, flowering grass, and
small insects, chiefly the small red meadow ants and their cocoons,
and also very small gentles. When they left the nest the little birds
resembled young Cordon Bleus with more greenish blue on the forehead
and on the breast. The bill was dark bluish-grey with a black tip
and a dark blue wart at each corner ; with young Cordon Bleus the
warts are light blue and the bill is black. The young began to feed
themselves when ten days old.
The parents built another nest in the same box and reared three
other young, which left the nest in August. A third brood was hatched
in late September, but the young died when a few days old on account
of the bad weather or perhaps for want of proper food.
At the end of the autumn the young of the first brood were in colour.
The hens were not distinguishable from their mother. As to the male
birds they were very much like the cock Blue-headed Waxbill, but
when examining them carefully one could notice a purple patch on
the ears, where the Cordon Bleu has a crimson one. They spent the
whole winter in an outdoor aviary without any artificial heat. I hoped
they would breed last year, but though a few nests were made no eggs
were laid. I have three cocks and four hens. . . .
The same year (1929) hybrids between the Blue-headed and the
Blue-breasted Waxbills were bred in Germany. Unluckily no description
of these was ever published. . . . They were fertile when mated inter se.
(Die Gefiederle Welt, 1930, p. 606.)
On his way to Madagascar M. Delacour bought a lot of living birds
in Dar-es-Salaam and sent them to Cleres. A few of them came into
my possession : there were two cock Blue-headed Waxbills, a few
Paradise Whydahs of the Eastern race, a pair of Melba Finches, and
two Pseudonigrita emini, a lovely species which had never been imported
before, but which unluckily did not live long with me. I kept these
birds in a bird-room till the end of May and then paired the cock Blue-
headed Waxbills with the hens. But the month of June was so bad
over here that one of the cocks died within a few days after I had
let them fly in the outdoor aviary. The other cock paired with one
of the hens and building operations began about the middle of July,

the cock taking the materials to the hen, who deposited them in the
deal box in which the hybrids had been reared the year before. The
Cordon Bleus had been taken out of the aviary, so one of the hens had
no mate. However, both hens laid in the nest, which contained seven
eggs when I looked into it. Only three hatched out, and three young
were reared with insects and small seeds. When quite young they
were covered wuth grey down ; the small black phosphorescent spots
in the inside of the bills were not disposed as with the young U. bengalus
or TJ. c. angolensis ; the skin at the corner of the bill was very dark,
instead of being sky-blue.
About the middle of August I saw them sitting close together on
a privet twig. The weather was very bad then. A few days later when
I looked for them among the shrubs of the aviary I found only two,
the other having totally disappeared. At this age they were not very
different from the hybrids of the preceding year ; the bill was almost
all black and they had more blue on the top of the head.
It took them a long time to assume the adult plumage, and the
cock was not in full colours before the middle of October. Now he is
quite indistinguishable from his father. The other young one is a hen.
To my knowledge this species had not been previously bred in
France, but I believe it had successfully mated in Germany in 1929,
though I cannot be positive about it.

Though not confined to the fair isle of Sicily this lovely bird is
one of the best known and most eagerly sought after species which
inhabits the land which is dominated by the towering volcano of Etna.
It is not common, neither does it thrust itself upon one's notice,
but most visitors to the island manage at one time or another, unless
they are of the type who oscillate between the meal and the bridge
tables all day, to see the beautiful blue form of this sweet songster.
This charming bird has always intrigued me, and for a long time
I have tried to obtain examples but without success. They seem

Sydney Porter--The Blue Thrush in Sicily
hardly ever to get them, though I believe they are sometimes to be
obtained in Germany, where they are sent from Southern Europe.
So I was delighted to find when arriving in Sicily at the beginning
of last year that the bird was comparatively numerous in the
mountainous districts around Etna. But though quite a few people
seemed to possess examples, hardly anyone seemed willing to part
with their pets.
I was introduced to a gentleman who lived in Taormina and
possessed five of these birds which he had reared from the nest, but
he was not willing to part with any. There was another bird owned
by the proprietor of a small hotel in the main street. It was a very
poor bedraggled creature and 500 lira was asked for it which was
out of all reason.
I went around in search of others/but owing to my Italian being
limited to about three words we never got beyond the initial stages.
Usually the birds were kept in cages far too small for them, which
were never cleaned out and often kept in the semi-darkness of the
one-roomed Sicilian house. The one at the hotel mentioned previously
was kept, on wet days and at night, over the kitchen range, and when
I found out that the cage had only a wire bottom I was very glad
that I had taken no meals there !
One day I met an old and very eccentric German count who had
a collection of birds, mainly Canaries. These, too, were kept in a very
dirty state. He informed me that he knew about every bird in the
world, but when I questioned him about the names of certain birds
he told me that he never bothered about such trivial things, it was,
only the songs he learned to know and not the names !
However, he had two very beautiful Blue Thrushes, and when
I told him how anxious I was to obtain one, he at once offered to sell
me the younger bird at a very reasonable price. The older bird was
the brightest coloured specimen I have ever seen. The head was
a brilliant sky blue, the rest of the body a very rich smoky blue,
and the breast feathers delicately pencilled with light grey. He
explained to me that this bird was brought to him over seven years
ago almost dying, and with care it had developed into the lovely
creature that I now saw. The bird was ridiculously tame and upon

seeing a stranger it would at once burst into a torrent of song. The
other bird, which I purchased, though not so brilliant as the older
bird, was exceptionally large and in a very different condition from
the ones which the peasants usually have.
Another of my birds came from an aged couple. I first saw the
bird hanging outside their tiny shop, the only commodities seeming
to be a few oranges and lemons and a basket of beans. Our first
conversation was a failure, I knew no Sicilian and they spoke no English,
but another day with the aid of a little boy who spoke quite good
English and who acted as interpreter, the bird was secured.
The parting with their treasure was quite touching. I called late
one evening to take my bird away and found the old couple like Darby
and Joan sitting in the dim light of a burning rush, over the smouldering
embers of charcoal in their old copper brazier with their pet hung
close by their side.
I was given many words of advice, but I never knew what they
were, and just before the parting they both took the cage and, pressing
their aged faces against it, whispered soft words of farewell and kissed
the bird in turn. I was almost sorry to take the bird away, but I
knew that it would have a better home and, with me, a bird's feelings
always come first.
The first bird that I saw in Taormina I endeavoured to buy, but as
the price asked was extortionate I did not become the purchaser.
But as the weeks went on and as I saw the poor creature gradually
wilting and fading away through being fed on unsuitable food (I believe
that it was fed on raw meat and that only when the owner remembered
to feed it), so I couldn't resist buying it and eventually the poor thing
became mine. But I was afraid that I had left it too long, for when
I carried it down to my house by the sea, its feet were so bad that it
couldn't stand, but with care it revived and in time became one of my
best birds, in fact it became so tame that it would fly on to my hand,
then on to my shoulder and nestle up against my neck. I had to feed
it by hand for the first few days as it was in such an emaciated condition.
The " Merle Bleue ", as it is known to the natives, is essentially
a bird of the high rugged mountains of Southern Europe. It appears
scarcer in Central Europe than the Common Rock Thrush. This

Sydney Porter--The Blue Thrush in Sicily
latter bird is only found in Sicily as a rare passing migrant, but the
Blue Thrush is a resident all the year round. I have often seen the
bird on the precipitous but fertile hillsides near the sea and very lovely
it looks when seen from above. The plumage appears an intense
blue in the brilliant sunshine, though when the bird is seen against
the light it appears quite black.
It will even visit gardens on the mountain sides, and a lady of my
acquaintance told me that it sometimes sang its rich, full melody from
the window ledges of her house overlooking the sea. Once when
sitting at the foot of a high cliff by the sea one of these lovely birds
came and perched on a rock within a few feet, and most beautiful
it looked, the sunshine intensifying the blue against the white rock,
but as soon as it became aware of my presence it was off in a flash.
The few times I have heard the full sweet song sung in its real
and romantic setting have been red-letter days in my life ; sometimes
when wandering in the mountains just behind the coast or coming down
from a tiny hill village perched in a seemingly impossible position
on the topmost point of some mountain peak, and when the sun had
sunk behind the snow-capped peak of Etna and everywhere seemed
bathed in a soft subdued golden light. Everything was still and
silent; all Nature seemed to be resting after the burning heat of the
day and taking a breath before settling down for the night.
The stillness in those rarified regions is remarkable. Odd sounds
float up from the valleys below, the sound of an age-old Sicilian air
played on the pipes by some fair Sicilian shepherd youth as he drives
his flocks homeward, or perhaps the distant tingling of the goat-bells.
Over all seems to brood the " peace that passeth understanding ",
when suddenly there bursts forth from some rocky ledge the rich pure
cadence of the song of this lovely bird. The still clear air rings with
it as volume after volume is poured out as the bird sings its evensong.
I once heard the sound of distant church bells mingling with the
sweet flow of the feathered songster, forming a wonderful combination
of sound which I shall never forget.
The Blue Kock Thrush is not classed as a true Thrush : why, I do
not know, for in every way it appears to be one, except perhaps in
some ways in its demeanour. It seldom, if ever, is seen perched on

trees but always on some rocky boulder or among the loose stones on
the rugged mountains. The nest, which is exactly like those built
by other Thrushes, is placed in a crevice or niche in the face of the
rocks and it is very difficult to detect as the birds are extremely wary,
but it is eagerly sought after by the peasant boys, who take the young;
and rear them, selling them to the people in the towns. Nearly every
Blue Thrush which one sees in captivity in Sicily has been procured
in this way. The nest usually contains from three to five blue eggs.
The young are hatched in late April and May.
On a rocky and precipitous headland near where I stayed lived
several Blue Thrushes, but these birds were so wild and vigilant that
one seldom caught sight of them ; but if one wandered there in the
evenings and sat quietly until dusk came, as I often did, one was almost,
sure to hear the evensong of these birds usually perched far out of sight
on some rocky ledge on the face of the cliffs above the sea, and
occasionally one would catch sight of one of the birds themselves as
they flew towards their roosting-place in the twilight.
No bird is more elusive or more intolerant of observation than the
Blue Thrush, and the second it notices that it is being watched it
will slip quickly and silently out of sight.
Both the bird and its songs seem to belong to the great wild
mountain ranges, beetling cliffs and great solitary places of sunny and
romantic Sicily where the great silent valleys seem to intensify its rich
full song and the brilliant sunlight the exquisite blue of its plumage.
I often think that the birds lose a deal of their charm when taken out
of their proper setting.
I once watched one of these Thrushes for nearly a whole morning.
It was singing its song on a rugged promontory in the sea. There
was rather a heavy tide running at the time and the bird was perched
within a few feet of the spray of the waves ; in fact I could only hear
the song very intermittently owing to the roar. At intervals the bird
would make a search of the crevices in the rocks only a few feet from
the water line, so evidently the birds which frequent the sea coast
must to some extent feed upon small Crustacea.
In captivity the Blue Thrush makes a most delightful pet; in
fact, if I were restricted to a single bird for a pet I would choose a Blue

Thrush. Most specimens are unusually tame and intelligent, but
in some ways they have their drawbacks, for they are terribly pugnacious
and cannot be kept with safety with any other bird either of their own
size or smaller. When two of the same species are put together a deadly
combat is at once commenced.
The birds are very long lived, and I think specimens have been known
to reach the age of twenty years.
They are easy birds to cater for, a large cage, a good soft food,
and a bath, also several stones for the birds to perch on--if these are
not given their feet soon go wrong. Given these conditions I know
of no bird that will bring more joy to its owner with its rich sweet
song, lovely plumage, and charming ways.
[In the third volume of the Avicultural Magazine (1897) the
late Mr. Hubert Astley gave a very charming black and white sketch
of the Blue Thrush, which he knew well both wild in Italy and in
captivity. He successfully reared a brood of five from a wild nest
in Italy, and was so delighted with the species that he concluded his
account by saying, " I shall never be without a Blue Thrush, if I can
help it, as long as I live."-- Ed.]

It is now forty-two years since I moved with my aviaries and birds
from North London to my present address in Sydenham.
Some time afterwards the late Dr. A. G. Butler called on me and
we had a long conversation about starting a magazine relating to
foreign and British birds.
I remember our present Editor, Mr. D. Seth-Smith, was the first
one I wrote to, and I have always thought it was a mistake for his name
not to be on the list of original members ; for he took the greatest
interest in our starting the " Journal of the Avicultural Society
[But was just too late to join with the first issue.--D. S-S.]
Our Committee was formed in 1894, and the first number of our
Magazine was issued in November of that year. It was edited by

Dr. C. S. Simpson and Mr. H. R. Fillmer. We commenced with a
membership roll of 50.
About the same time, when I was on another committee, a large
bazaar was to be held to raise funds for a new church in the neighbour-
hood. One item in the programme I objected to, and was asked if
I would fill the programme in the event of this item being withdrawn.
I suggested that, if they gave me a large room, I would arrange the
first foreign bird show ever held in connection with a bazaar. My
suggestion was approved, the show held, and it proved a great success.
The following appeared in a local newspaper: "A New Departure
in Bazaars --A Foreign Bird Show. . . . The great feature of the
bazaar was an exhibition of live foreign birds from a private collection,
which is one of the best in the United Kingdom, kept by Mr. J. B.
Housden, Brooklyn, Cator Road, Sydenham. All the proceeds went
to the Bazaar Fund, which benefited largely by the show. On the first
day alone some 400 visitors paid to view the exhibits, which were in
a large well-lighted hall. The hall was tastefully decorated with
flags and some very fine paintings of birds, some large cases of bright
plumaged birds, and a fountain (with goldfish) throwing up its silvery
spray in the middle of the hall; besides this a large quantity of palms
and flowering plants were placed between the cages and in different
parts of the hall, forming quite a tropical promenade ; in fact it was
one of the prettiest sights we ever remember seeing. The birds, some
400 in number, were contained in a large number of cages and large
aviaries, all labelled with their names and the names of the countries
they inhabit.
" In one aviary were seventeen Rosella Parrakeets in gorgeous
plumage, quite a living picture ; in another four Golden Pheasants
not less beautiful; in several other aviaries, seven very beautiful Blue-
bearded Jays from South America ; twenty Weaver and Whydah
birds in full plumage, some with very long tails ; Gouldian Finches ;
a fine collection of foreign Pigeons and Doves, some as large as domestic
Fowls, others not much larger than Sparrows ; Scarlet Tanagers, and

guarded the entrance to the show. Some of the peculiar nests of the
Weaver birds were also to be seen."
Some time afterwards I sent my birds to a local flower show as an
additional attraction. A large number of people paid to see the birds,
in addition to other charges. I have always been struck by the
attraction that live foreign birds have for all classes, from Royalty
downwards.
In August, 1896, two ladies called on me one afternoon, asking
for the loan of some cases of birds in connection with a bazaar in aid
of the Re-Endowment Fund of Guy's Hospital: this bazaar was to
be opened by H.R.H. The Duchess of Albany.
I suggested instead of stuffed birds we should send live ones and
they were very pleased with the idea. This bazaar was held in some
beautiful grounds some miles from here. I had a large tent which
I decorated inside and out, with a large banner outside, " Foreign

Bird Show."
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99688805" page_id="56181695"  page_num="46" year="" vol="">
Our tent was crowded all the afternoon. I had the pleasure of
explaining all the birds on view to the opener of the bazaar, who spent
some considerable time in the tent.
Our Foreign Bird Show was a great success in every way ; next
to raising funds for the bazaar, my aim and object was to make new
members for the Avicultural Society. Several ladies wrote to me
asking for information about our Foreign Bird Society.
I have sent my birds to bazaars in connection with Dr. Barnardo'a
Homes and other Institutes.
On two occasions I lent my birds to the Salvation Army at their
large exhibitions at the Royal Agricultural Hall, London ; I had a very
fine collection of Parrots there, and as soon as the exhibition opened
visitors wanted to purchase many of the birds, but these were not
for sale.
Several years afterwards, at the second exhibition, I arranged with
the late Mr. J. D. Hamlyn and another dealer to supply me with
similar birds to those at the exhibition. During the four weeks about
eighty Parrots and other foreign birds were sold ; the profit from these
I sent to Mrs. Booth's social work.
This exhibition was their triennial exhibition (held July and August,.

we found could not go inside the pantechnicon vans, so it was suggested
they should go on the top, and the vans covered with bills advertising
the exhibition. As they provided the vans, I had no objection
providing my name was not used. It was quite a unique advertisement
in the long ride from South to North London.
One other exhibition I should like to mention, " The Orient/ 5 in
London Agricultural Hall, 4th June to 11th July, 1908. One of the
oldest members of our Society (and still a member) very kindly sent
me the two following reports : " Birds at the Orient in London.
Mr. Housden, a well-known aviculturist, has kindly lent a large number
of birds from his aviaries at Sydenham in order to add to the attractions
of the interesting exhibition at the Agricultural Hall. On a raised
platform cages and aviaries contained examples of various Cockatoos,
Parrots, and Parrakeets, all in excellent plumage and very tame.
Indeed, some of them are so fearless that they are allowed their liberty ;
a Blue-fronted Amazon is often to be seen perched on the outside
of its cage, the door of which stands open, and the bird takes short
flights round the hall, as does also one of the Parrakeets. ... In the
' Indian Village 5 cages full of exotic Finches and Weaver Birds attract
general attention. Many palms and other fine trees and plants are
here, and attached to some are the nests of the Weaver Birds. Even
the Birds of Prey are represented, for in one large aviary are two
Caracaras, Eagle-like birds from South America, which live in amity
with a Brown Buzzard ; and close by is a fine Eagle-owl which answers
to the name of ' Bob 5 and is a great favourite with its owner.
" In the large aviary, a structure of considerable dimensions,
are shown Silver and Amherst Pheasants, foreign Pigeons, Quails of
various species, and South American Kails, all in good plumage and
quite as much at home as they, would be in their own runs. . . --
Queen , 4th July, 1902.
The other article is from the Field newspaper, same date. As this
is similar to the above I am putting in its place another report sent

not a member of our Society:--\0x25A0

Exhibition (London Missionary Society) at the Agricultural Hall
in order to see a collection of birds belonging to Mr. Housden, a well
known member of the Avicultural Society. They are certainly well
worth a visit. The Parrots--using that term in a wide sense--were
in excellent feather, and their owner gave me a practical demonstration
of their tameness. Undisturbed by the noise and multitude of people
passing to and fro, they allowed me to handle them and to fondle them
as if they had known me for weeks. . . One Sulphur-crested Cockatoo
had been in Mr. Housden's possession for thirty years. Besides these
were Slender Bills, Leadbeaters, Bosy, some fine Yellow Budgerigars,
Giant Kingfishers, and a host of other birds. In a very large aviary
adjoining a Kafir kraal I saw Mr. Housden is a firm believer in the
value of green stuff for his Pheasants, for there was a plentiful supply.
Mr. Housden gives popular # bird talks ' . . . and no doubt one effect
of his exhibition at the Agricultural Hall will be an addition to the
ranks of aviculturists."
There was no charge to see the birds (the only time). Another
gentleman and the writer arranged the " Indian Village and Kafir
Kraal ", and the birds took the whole of the central floor space of
the hall.
Much more could be written of these long " forty years " ; perhaps
some of our younger members may have the opportunity of doing
two things : helping some good cause and interesting the visitors in
foreign birds, and so add to our members' roll by the loan of foreign
birds.

The Ratites are a special race of birds which unlike all others
(Carinates) have flat sternums without a keel. They are usually larger
than other birds, their legs are very strong, and their wings more or
less reduced and useless for flight. Their skeletons are massive, their
feathers soft and decomposed.
Their chicks seem mostly to belong to a more ancient period when

flightless birds were far more numerous and more widely distributed
than they are to-day, when only five families exist: Ostriches in
Africa, Arabia, and Asia Minor ; Rheas in South America ; Emus in.
Australia ; Cassowaries in the Moluccas, Papua, and North Australia ;
and Kiwis in New Zealand.
All the Ratites are terrestrial in their habits, but their ways of
living differ according as they inhabit deserts, steppes, or forests.
We will consider this with each group.
In confinement they require all the space possible and are to be
treated as mammals rather than birds. Rheas and Emus are hardy
and may be looked upon as field birds and allowed semi-freedom.
Ostriches in Europe require shelter during winter although they soon
adapt themselves to our climate ; but their strength and savagery
oblige them to be kept in enclosures. It is the same with the
Cassowaries, which are extremely irritable and usually dangerous.
The Kiwis, owing to their nocturnal habits and their peculiar
conformation, must have special treatment.
Both Rheas and Emus breed freely with us. With them, as with
the Cassowaries and Kiwis, only the cock incubates. The best way to
rear the young in Europe is to allow him to hatch and then to remove
the chicks immediately and keep them in a small room or well ventilated
hut provided with a heated foster-mother. All the care the chicks
require beyond keeping warm is feeding them on chopped greenstuff
and crumbled biscuit with phosphate of lime added. Sometimes at
first the young are slow in feeding and must be brought to it by hand-
feeding ; as soon as they have been prevailed on to taste they will
feed readily. Should there be older chicks they will teach the younger
ones to feed. They can be allowed out, if the weather is suitable,
when they are three or four days old, and at a month they may be
given full liberty provided they are shut in at night, which can easily
be managed by feeding them in their shelter. From then onwards
they will not require artificial heat, and at four months old they can
sleep out of doors.
The eggs may also be hatched in incubators. Should the cock be
allowed to rear the chicks the hens must be taken away to prevent
them from attacking the young, and if the weather is bad the brood

must be shut in at night, which is difficult. Often, too, the cock tires
out his chicks and sometimes kills them by making them walk too far.
In any case the results are far inferior to those obtained by rearing the
young in the manner above described.
Both the male and female Ostrich sit on their eggs, but it is better,
generally speaking, to hatch them in an incubator. Young birds
have been reared in France and Germany, but in tropical and sub-
tropical countries--South Africa, Tunisia, Madagascar, and California--\0x25A0
they are more at home and thrive. There a breeding pair are turned
into an enclosure and the young when hatched are treated in the same
way as the preceding species. The only difference is that they require
rather more nourishing food and more protection, particularly against
damp.
Ostrich breeding on a commercial basis, though not paying at
present, chiefly on account of the change in the fashion, has been very
important, particularly in South Africa, and several text-books have
been written about it; but this is not the place to enlarge upon the
subject.
The Ostrich
Ostriches ( Struthio) are birds of the desert and barren places of
Asia Minor and Africa. They emphatically belong to dry localities.
There is only one species, Struthio cctmelus. Everyone is familiar
with this enormous bird, bare-necked and bare-thighed, its body
adorned with curled plumage grey in the hens, black in the cocks,
with large white feathers in wings and tail. They only possess two
toes on each foot and only the cock has a voice, a hoarse bellow in
the breeding season. At that time he indulges in a curious dance,
crouching with wings held away from the body and brought forward
while he alternately strikes his back on the right and the left with
his swelled-out neck.
The Ostrich in confinement eats every sort of greenstuff, maize,
barley, biscuit, etc. The hen lays readily, often from 40 to 60 eggs
per annum, but in our climate they are usually infertile. Incubation
lasts about 45 days. At this time the cock bird often turns savage
and dangerous.

There are five races of Ostrich, the chief difference lying in size
and the colour of the neck and thighs of the cock.
The Ostrich (S. camelus) is a native of N. Africa, from south
of Atlas to the Soudan and Nigeria ; the cock's neck and thighs are
red, and the crown of the head bare. The eggs are white or very pale.
The Syrian Ostrich (S. c. syriacus), from the Syrian and Arabian
deserts, is rare, and was discovered only a dozen or so years ago.
It is very like the preceding, but smaller, and the eggs are even paler.
The last three Ostriches lay eggs with the shell pitted with tiny holes.
The Southern Ostrich (S. c. australis ) inhabits South Africa and
is now practically extinct in the wild state, but is bred in quantities
for its feathers. Its neck and thighs are grey, and the top of its head
is feathered.
The Masai Ostrich (S. c. massaicus), of East Africa, has the top
of its head feathered.
The Rheas
Rheas inhabit South America, where they are found from Eeru
and Brazil to Patagonia. They frequent the wide grassy plains.
They are considerably smaller than Ostriches and their necks and
thighs are completely feathered ; they have three toes and no tail,
but their wings are very wide and adorned with long wide supple but
weak feathers. When they run they often spread them in a peculiar
way. The hen is dumb, but the cock in spring utters dull bellows ;
he then displays by ruffling up his head feathers and spreading his wings
forward on either side of his breast.
Rheas feed entirely on green herbs and browse like sheep ; they
are very useful on the prairies, which they rid of many noxious weeds.
To this, in captivity, a little powdered biscuit, bran, or potato or
mangel wurzel may be added in winter. All the Rheas are hardy and
have no need of protection. They breed freely in Europe. Although
it is a good plan to pair off a cock and hen in an enclosure one can,
given a sufficiently large park or meadow, keep a flock of both sexes
together, for the combats in spring between the cocks are unimportant
if there is sufficient room, the only objection being that there will be
more infertile eggs. Rheas do not pair and the hens are fertilized by

any or every cock. She lays near the nest, a simple depression in
the ground, prepared for her by one of them, the cock then collects the
eggs, which when newly laid are a fine orange yellow, but afterwards
turn white, and begins to sit as a rule on five or six, though he may
take eight, while the hen goes and lays near another cock. Incubation
is undertaken by the cock bird entirely and lasts about forty days.
We said further back how best to rear the chicks. Their food
should consist during the first fortnight of chopped white clover and
spinach mixed with powdered biscuit. Later dandelion and beet are
excellent and the proportion of biscuit should gradually be increased,
but bran or cooked potato are just as good and phosphate of lime
must never be omitted.
Rheas are inoffensive to all other animals and it is seldom that
a cock turns spiteful to the young ones. Their flesh is good to eat
as well as their eggs.
There are two species.
The Common Rhea {Rhea americana) is a large bird ; his thighs
are entirely naked. He has a large head and beak, a long neck, and
stands high. There are three forms.
The Great-billed Rhea ( R . a. americana) from the north-east of
Brazil, is blackish-grey brown, with the sides of the head, lower part
of the neck, and under-parts dull white ; the interscapular region is
dark brown, together with a patch on the breast. This Rhea is rarely
imported and would doubtless prove delicate as it comes from the
tropics.
The Intermediate Rhea (R. a. intermedia), from South Brazil
and Weugai, is somewhat smaller, ashy grey with yellowish white
neck, and the interscapular region grey. It is hardly ever imported.
The Grey Rhea {R. a. albescens), from the Argentine, is the species
which has so well become acclimatized in Europe. It is large, ashy
grey, with a considerable part of the neck black as well as the pectoral
patch.
The White Rhea is only an albino variety of the above fixed
by selection ; it is snowy white with more or less decided black marks
round the neck ; blue eyes, and the beak and feet yellow. The young,
ones are white with grey spots.

White Rheas are no more delicate than the grey when adult, but
the young are less robust and the proportion of infertile eggs is higher.
It is far more ornamental.
Darwin's Rhea ( R. darwini) is a very distinct species, a little
smaller and shorter-legged, with rounder head and shorter beak ;
the upper part of the thighs is decked with small feathers. It is light
grey all over and all the large feathers have white tips, which gives
it a fine, fleecy appearance. This species comes from South-East
Argentine, Chile, Peru, and Bolivia. Although it lives in cold regions
it is not nearly as hardy as the Grey Rhea in confinement. Heat upsets
it and it dislikes dry grass. It should be treated like the preceding but
kept on much finer turf with bran and sulphate of lime, or on bare
earth.
This Rhea is rare in confinement and has only been bred twice
in Europe by M. Blaaw in Holland a long time ago, and at Woburn
in 1930.

At a recent meeting of the British Ornithologists' Club, Mr. H. M.
Wallis produced a copy of the Bulgarian British Review in which there
was an account of the breeding of the Lammergeyer in the royal aviaries
at Sofia. The late King Ferdinand is well known as a keen ornithologist
and aviculturist and he installed the aviaries several years ago.
Lammergeyers, it appears, have bred there successfully for the past
sixteen years, and the present King Boris is as keenly interested in
birds, both wild and captive, as was his father. So far as I know there
are no other records of such an event.

A General Index.
Captain Reeve is very anxious to have a General Index to the past .
volumes of the Avicultural Magazine, and rightly says that such
an index would be invaluable. Many of us greatly desire this and
probably to no one would it be more useful than to the Editor, for he
constantly has to look up references in back volumes and often wastes
much time in searching for something which a General Index would
have revealed at once ; but such an index would be very expensive,
and before undertaking its production it would be necessary to have
some idea as to the approximate number of the members who would
be willing to subscribe for it. With regard to the cost of such an index
I may mention that if produced on the lines of our yearly index the
cost for the whole of the thirty-six volumes would work out at some-
thing in the neighbourhood of #600. But thanks to an offer by
Dr. Hopkinson to compile a more simple index, it may be possible to
produce one. At any rate, the Council has the matter under
consideration.
Weavers at Liberty.
In our Journal for December, 1929, Mr. Gordon Maynard told
of an experiment in liberating the Orange Weaver in his garden which
proved entirely successful, and I believe that several of our members
tried the same experiment in 1930. It would be interesting to hear
their results. We tried it in the London Zoological Gardens, but
without success. About fifty well acclimatized birds were let out by
degrees, after some weeks' detention in a large cage on an island of

the Three-Island Pond. At first they appeared to stay fairly well
and many nests were built before the cocks came into colour. They
were regularly fed in their special cage, to which they regularly returned
for food. They seem to have commenced to disperse when the cocks
were coming into colour about the end of July and beginning of August,
and by the beginning of September almost all had gone. In October
I converted their cage into a trap by means of a wire funnel, and
immediately captured five Weavers, apparently all that remained.
Superabundance of Sparrows.
The failure with the Weavers may have been partly due to the
quantities of Sparrows that frequent the Zoological Gardens. These
had learnt how to obtain access to the Weavers' cage, and when this
was converted into a trap it proved very useful in helping to reduce
the Sparrow population. The keeper in charge counted his captures
in dozens and long ago told me that he had captured thirty-two dozen.
By now his bag must have reached about 500, and yet there seem
to be as many Sparrows about as ever.
Two Attractive Catalogues.
The Keston Foreign Bird Farm, in which Messrs. Boosey and
Brooksbank have made the breeding and rearing of foreign birds a
paying proposition, have issued a catalogue which will be found useful
by those who wish to acquire rare and acclimatized birds from the
lovely Turquoisine, that a few years ago was thought to have disappeared
for ever, to the familiar Zebra e finch. Another catalogue that will be
found useful by Pheasant-keepers is issued by the Hundridge Game Farm
of Great Missenden, who specialize in fancy as well as utility Pheasants.

and anxious to get to the Imperial Amazons which it could hear calling,
and sure enough it soon began to pluck itself. We caged it again and
for some weeks it was quite all right; then again it started to pluck
itself and seemed so restless and miserable that I tried it in another
aviary. Here it has been rather more contented but still occasionally
plucks itself, attacking not the upper part of the breast, as is usual,
but the -quills, especially of the tail, and the wing-butts. I feed it on
plain seed with a little sunflower, plenty of pea-nuts, and apple, but
I do not think it ever touches anything but the pea-nuts, sunflower,
and fruit. As Miss Chawner says, it is fond of eating bark, but it will
not touch butter, etc. I am sure this bird's trouble is purely psycho-
logical : it is miserable at being shut up and is even more tantalized
by the partial liberty of an aviary than by the more inexorable con-
finement of a cage. In the spring I propose to allow it complete
freedom to climb about in the crees, for it will never be able to fly
owing to the damage of the shot. Through the kindness of Mr. Sydney
Porter in lending me his bird I now have what appears to be a true
pair of Imperial Amazons. In Mr. Porter's opinion, his specimen is
a hen, although if the female Imperial is larger than the male it differs
from all ordinary Amazons and also from the Gruilding's. Mr. Porter's
Parrot has done exceedingly well with me, and were it not for her sadly
damaged wing would be a truly magnificent specimen. She has the
most lovely chocolate-purple tail, that of my own bird being much
greener. She is very lively and does not appear at all unduly sensitive
to cold, sitting for long periods in the open flight uttering all manner
of loud cries. My bird, which is able to fly, is a good deal smaller
and has a smaller head. When he was first introduced to his partner
he behaved in a curious way, showing neither pleasure nor anger but
merely fear, as though he had been confronted by some strange and
unknown animal. As, however, she never attempted to molest him,
he soon became reassured, and now they are on the best of terms and
preen each other's feathers. Were he more contented I might even
harbour wild hopes of breeding them, but he seems to find the 24 feet
aviary too cramped, and at present I cannot afford to build them the
larger quarters they deserve.

to 1892 there was a fine male at Woburn Abbey, and the pair would
doubtless have bred had they only been put together. There was a
second male at Woburn at a latter date, but he had a badly damaged
wing and would not have proved fertile.

1911, and an account appeared of its breeding in the Magazine for
November of that year. Numida ptilorhyncha was bred here in 1928
(see Avicultural Magazine, Yol. VII, No. 1), and eight young ones
were fully reared. The Yulturine Guinea-fowl has laid on several
occasions, but the young have always been hatched so&apos; late in the
season that they have never reached maturity before the autumn
damp and fogs set in, and they have always died off when about six
weeks old. As Professor Ghigi says, Guinea-fowl require large
enclosures if they are to breed, and they prefer long rank grass or hay
amongst which to nest in preference to a thickly planted bushy place.
All those bred here have laid in the open amongst very long grass,
although there was plenty of other shelter in the shape of small bushes
available. I should certainly not expect Guinea-fowl to breed in
aviaries.

Sir,--T o complete the story of my Black Rails, two more young
appeared on 1st October. One was weak and tried to warm itself in
the autumn sun : sitting on the edge of the pond it tumbled in and
was drowned ; the other one is still alive. I gave the three of the first
nest away. The four of the second nest have the iris red and the beaks
are turning green. The legs are still black.

Sir, --Some notes on these may be of interest. In early autumn
of last year, when all had. got their new quills and could fly, but the
drakes were just coming into colour, I saw fourteen ducks and three
drakes in the dell at Hyde Park, all full-winged, and in St. James's Park
three unpinioned ducks and one drake ; in Regent's Park I saw a single
full-winged pair. Later, in the Zoo, I counted two dozen birds, some
of which were full-winged, and no doubt at least a dozen were, as there
certainly were only a few pairs of pinioned birds ; with a lot moving
about it is difficult to say exactly how many are pinioned. In
Greenwich Park I saw a flock of eight, two or three of which flapped
their wings and showed pinioning ; the lot came many yards from the
water and were nervous of me, but none flew, so I cannot say if any
here were unpinioned ; the distance and light did not give me a chance
to make sure. Lastly, after Christmas, I saw two lovely unpinioned
pairs feeding close to the fence in St. James's Park. In all I must
have seen at least three dozen unpinioned birds last year.

NESTING OF THE WHITE-CHEEKED FINCH-LARK
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998302125" page_id="56181709"  page_num="58" year="" vol="">
Sir, --My hen White-cheeked Finch-lark, after failing to hatch its
two eggs in 1927, let the next two summers pass without attempting to
nest. Last summer it nested four times, only succeeding in rearing
the single young bird of the first nest. The single egg in each of the
next two nests got broken. Seeing it laying for the fourth time I fenced
in the spot with wire-netting. All went well until the chick was five
days old. That morning the cock was brooding the empty nest with
the chick struggling on the ground about 1 inch away. I put it into
the nest again. The next morning the same thing happened, but
the brooding bird was the young from the first nest which had been
helping to feed it up to now. On the third morning it was in the nest
and alive. In the evening the hen was brooding it outside the nest,
but by then it was dead.
The hen certainly showed more sense than the cock. I can only
imagine that he threw it out because he did not like it fidgeting about
underneath him.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993238555555556" page_id="56181710"  page_num="59" year="" vol="">
Sir, --The natives (?) of South America would appear to have some
method of treating a bird's wing which permanently inhibits the growth
of primary feathers on one side, producing the effect of pinioning
without the removal of any joint. Nearly a third of the Queen of
Bavaria Conures imported have been treated in this way, and I have
seen other South American Parrots similarly deprived of flight. The
practice, as applied to Parrots, is a great nuisance and is one to look
out for, since dealers, needless to say, make a habit of selling these
maimed individuals at the price of perfect specimens. If, however,,
the operation could be performed on waterfowl, cranes, etc., and were
less painful than pinioning, it would be an advantage to be able to-
copy it.
I have been trying to apply the fat and butter cure suggested by
the Editor to half a dozen feather-plucking Cockatoos, Parrots, and
Parrakeets, but not one of them will look at fat or butter up to the
present! No doubt there are many normal birds in my collection
that would eat it readily !

Sir, --I read with very great interest in the December number

Keston Foreign Bird Farm, and would like to add my congratulations
to those that Messrs. Boosey and Brooksbank must have already
received.
It may be of interest to aviculturists to know that White Zebra
Finches have already been bred in Australia. In Sydney last March
I was offered a few pairs by a dealer, who, as far as I can remember,
had bred them himself. He had first succeeded in getting the strain

two or three seasons back, and now has a few regular breeding birds.
I did not see the birds myself, but he assured me they were pure Zebra
Finches, bred from birds trapped in Australia. He said they were
pure white, with the usual red beak and yellow legs. Unfortunately
I did not secure any, and very much regret it now.
I shall look forward to hearing further news of the Keston Bird

AN ALBINO ROSELLA AND A YOUNG TURQUOISINE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989157615384615" page_id="56181711"  page_num="60" year="" vol="">
Sin,--When in Australia in 1930 I saw, among many other
interesting birds, an Albino Bosella, and am rather anxious to know
if similar specimens have occurred before. The bird was taken from
its nest in the wild state by a Mr. Foglia (an Adelaide dealer). With
the exception of two crimson patches, one on the crown and the other,
not so bright, on the breast, it was dark yellow all over, shading in
parts to light orange. It was quite tame, having been hand-reared,
and when I saw it (in late February), would be from six weeks to two
months old and in very good condition. I did my best to persuade
Mr. Foglia to sell it but nothing would induce him to part with it.
Mr. Foglia was also experimenting with a young weakling
Turquoisine Grass Parrakeet, bred by Mr. Simon Harvey, of Adelaide,
and ejected from its nest-box by the parent birds when a week old.
Mr. Harvey found it on the ground one morning in a very poor state
and took it to Mr. Foglia, who tried hand-feeding with scalded semolina ;
however, it lost weight--it was weighed by means of matches--so
he then tried cooked semolina, and it held its own for a time and then
again started losing. He next gave it cooked semolina and bread
and milk which proved very successful, and to this he later added
sugar with very good results, the bird gaining strength and growing
in the normal manner. It eventually turned out to be a cock.
Mr. Harvey had extraordinarily successful breeding results with
his Grass Parrakeets (Turquoisines and Elegants) when I was over
there, and succeeded in getting the very rare Queen Alexandra Parrakeet
to sit, but I left before they had time to hatch out any eggs.

THE RACKET-TAILED PARROT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998702363636364" page_id="56181722"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
In the Avicultural Magazine for September, 1903, appeared a
coloured plate, by the late Herbert Goodchild, of the first example of
this rare Parrot that had been seen in this country. The plate is an
excellent example of the great skill as an artist and lithographer of one
whose untimely death was a great loss to bird portraiture, but it
represents either an immature male or a female example of the species,
and it was thought desirable to now figure the adult male since a very
perfect example is living in the London Zoological Gardens. This
bird was presented in October, 1929, by Mr. A. St. Alban Smith, who
had obtained it in Singapore, though its native country is the island
of Celebes. On arrival it was in the juvenile plumage as figured in the
plate above referred to, but it soon moulted and assumed the adult
dress as shown in the plate accompanying this notice.
The Racket-tail has always had the reputation of being a particularly
delicate species, but though it appears to be susceptible to cold it
presents no great difficulty in the matter of feeding, its principal diet
being canary and sunflower seed, fruit, and green food.
This is a really very beautiful Parrot about the size of a Rosella,
elegant in shape, and of extremely delicate colouring ; its carriage
is very upright, and so far as one can judge in the noisy atmosphere of
the Parrot House, it has a very pleasing voice. It seems to be of a
naturally tame disposition.

Another specimen presented by Mr. St. Alban Smith in September,
1930, was thought at first to belong to the same species, but now that
it is growing its tail-feathers, one sees that the lateral ones are banded
with black, showing it to differ from platurus. I am inclined to think

almost entirely self-constituted pet.
She began life in a small paddock more than twenty years ago,
where she had little human society, and remained there till after the
War. Owing to her belonging to a seldom-imported species, and having
become an orphan, she was brought up to the garden. None of the
companions with which we provided her could be induced to live more
than a few months. Her practice in the garden was to rush after all
intruders with raised wings and ferocious aspect, not stopping short
at attacking their legs.
It was the rule to retreat somewhat hurriedly before her, but as
this seemed undignified in one's own garden, I made a stand and gave
" Sabina " to understand that in my case at least such behaviour
could not be tolerated.
As with some human beings an attack in the rear was an amusing
diversion, but face to face with the enemy " Sabina " assumed a dignified
attitude and at first strutted away at a respectful distance, hurling
imprecations at me for my unseemly conduct.
Apparently she decided that I was a curiosity worthy of further
investigation, for she took to following me on to the stone terrace in
front of the house, and finally watched me through the French windows.
She has never consented to eat anything that I have offered her, so
that her regard for me is entirely devoid of any taint of " cupboard
love ". Gradually she allowed me to stroke her and then to lift and

carry her. We are now on kissing terms, i.e. when I ask her to kiss
me she does so.
Her garden pond is some distance from the house, and there we
have provided her with a mate who has lived longer than most previous
importations, and has been with us more than a year, but she never
goes to him until she regards my return as hopeless. Most of the day
is spent on the terrace waiting for me, or sitting outside the window
of the room I am occupying. She follows me from window to window
as I go from one room to another, her great desire being to be
allowed to come inside and sit with me. When this permission is
granted she amuses herself with a basket of scraps of crumpled
newspaper and a suspended strap and piece of string, making a
contented crooning noise the whole time. When tired of play she
stands on one leg or sits down and goes to sleep, but fiercely resents
anyone else coming into the room.
She always announces my return in my motor to the world at large
by throwing back her head and uttering loud " Cos-cor-obas " when
she recognizes my own particular motor horn. I am told that when
I went to Scotland for eight weeks in the autumn, she never came near
the house after the second day after my departure, and yet she was
back at my window within an hour of my return, though the pond
she had been frequenting in my absence is not within sight of the house.
With a young Pekinese spaniel, friendship has been established in
much the same way as with myself. At first she ran after him, then
finding it never resulted in personal injury, he turned the tables and
ran after her. Now they have established a mutual if slightly strained
friendship, and are on sniffing and playing terms.
Owing to her habit of raising her wings and rushing ferociously at
intruders exactly like the male Mute Swan, she was for many years
thought to be a male even by so great an authority as Mr. F. E. Blaauw,
but " Sabina " has laid two eggs or at least has sat upon two infertile
eggs which were said to have been indisputably laid by her.

We are asked to write, not only about our successes, but also about
our failures, and some people even say that we can learn as much or
even more from our failures than from our successes. We may in truth
learn more of what we should not do but it is a negative sort of knowledge
and does not much appeal to me. Still, as I have failed to breed success-
fully from a pair of Spotted Munias and a pair of Green Avadavats
kept in conditions similar to those under which I have bred success-
fully St. Helena Waxbills, two broods in fact, of three and five, I
thought I would put on paper the little of use which I have learned.
In July of 1929 a Waghri, that is to say a member of a criminal
tribe which catches birds, brought me a pair of Spotted Munias other-
wise known, I believe, as Spice Birds or Nutmeg Finches. Why
they should be called Spice Birds or Nutmeg Finches I do not know.
Their spotted waistcoats of black and white suggest a name. There
is no difference between the sexes in plumage, so far as I can see.
They may be described as little, thick-set birds, of rufous-brown with
dark slate-coloured bill and feet and spotted waistcoats of black and
white and the male, like some others of different species, thinks he
is no end of a fellow and can sing. He stands upon his perch and
puffs out his waistcoat and opens his bill and a strange burring noise
proceeds from his interior. That is his song and his little wife, being
properly brought up, leans forward on her perch and listens. " Darling,"
one can almost hear her say, " you are in lovely voice to-day," and
this praise spurs him on to greater effort and he puffs his chest out
more and he opens his beak a little wider and tries even harder. He
has then a curious resemblance to a clockwork toy. Still, he is a cheery
little soul and he soon got to know me, and he then started to sing to
me. He had then an audience of two. I put him and his wife into
one of those French triple breeding-cages which I have described,
and hung on to one end a little wicker cage and gave them dry grass
and feathers to make their nest. He picked up a piece of grass and
dropped it and bowed before his wife and sang almost inaudibly.

She picked up a piece of grass and stood very uprightly and proudly
upon the perch, but this was merely to show she was not to be taken
for granted, and with these little birds, as with others, the lifting of
grass by the hen is a sign that she will accept the advances of the male.
But they did not get on very fast with the nest. They went into
the little wicker cage readily enough but they tried to build a nest
round a perch and failed. After a time, however, they seemed to
understand that it was better to take the grass inside and they built
a nest of the usual domed pattern, and about October when the cold
weather was to start the hen laid six eggs. They were large for the
size of the bird, larger in proportion than the egg of the Bengalee,
and very pointed. They varied in tint from white to cream, much
the colour of the eggs of the Common Fowl. The hen sat in an
exemplary fashion for about a week, when she started to get restless
and kept rearranging the grass in the nest. I should have taken
warning, but I did not know what she wished to say, and she finally
abandoned the eggs. I then saw that the grass had withered and
fallen apart and light came in through interstices, and she did not feel
safe. After that I had a khaki-coloured cloth covering made for
the nesting-cage, but it was too late. I opened the eggs and found
embryos in five. The following January she appeared to be sitting
and she sat hard for a fortnight, but when nothing happened and
I removed the nest I found only one egg and that was addled. These
little birds, apparently so willing to pair and build in captivity, had
not reared young.
During the ensuing hot weather and rains I am afraid the little birds
were neglected. I do not mean that they did not have seed and water,
but no effort was made to bring them into breeding condition and
they were put into a small wicker cage.
Last October, however, they were put again into a large cage--
as I had bred so many Zebra Finches and Bengalees I wanted to breed
no more--and this time they built a far finer nest. Whistler, in his
Handbook of Indian Birds , describes the nest of the Spotted Munia
as a bulky structure. It is composed, he says, of coarse blades and
stems of grass, rice and barley straw, and leaves of bajera and jawar.
The egg cavity is lined with fine grasses and roots. I gave the birds

only fine grass, and the hen did not seem happy. She laid one egg
on the floor of the cage, then she laid one in the nest, which the cock,
I think, ate, and altogether matters were not progressing satisfactorily.
I was then growing for my St. Helena Waxbills some seed called here
Cheena, which appears to me like a yellow millet. I did not grow it
to harvest or ripen but to feed half-ripe to the birds. I plucked the
stalks of this millet, leafy and about a foot long, and gave it to the
Munias. This seemed to them far more satisfactory, and they started
in to build a proper nest. An amazing quantity of this leafy grass
was taken in, and as fast as it withered and I gave more this was carried
in too, till finally the nesting-cage could hold no more and I gave
feathers and fine grass for lining. These also were accepted and then
the hen started to sit. The nest was so compactly made that I could
not see if there were any eggs at all. After a few days the hen appeared
to leave the nest more than a sitting bird should and I removed the
nest and found four eggs. I tested them in water and all floated
and so I thought all were infertile, but one dropped on the ground
and I saw it was not infertile. So much then for my meddlesome
interference. I had lost one young Spotted Munia. I restored the
nest and eggs, humbly and without much hope, but after about ten
days a faint chirping proceeded from the nest and the cock was
constantly feeding on the half-ripe cheena in the cage. But this
attempt to replenish the earth with little Spotted Munias was also
doomed to failure.
My supply of half-ripe cheena failed because the little grey squirrels
found it was good to eat, and all day were moving among the stalks.
I found the Munias would feed like other small Finches on soaked seed,
but having started on half-ripe cheena they doubtless thought they
should go on. The result was that they ceased to feed the young,
and instead of a healthy clamour there was silence. I removed the
nest and found one young, a sturdy little beast with the crop
empty, and that was the end of that.
The Munias have just now finished another of their bulky nests,
and they go in and out, but so far as I can see there are no eggs. They
will probably lay again as the weather gets warmer, for now it is cold
and chilly. When I removed the nest the last time and removed the

mortal remains of their only chick I opened the two eggs that were
in the nest. There was a fully developed young in each ; it may
have been the water test to which I had subjected them to test their
fertility : it may have been the cold, dry weather which had prevented
the hatching ; but whatever the cause, the young had died in the shell.
I have an idea that Spotted Munias, unlike the Silverbill which haunt
dry, sandy fields and are extremely abundant in these parts, prefer
warm, damp climates. I have only seen them wild once and that was
a small flock feeding on the half-ripe grass seeds in long grass in the
Eains in Poona. Their large bills suggest to me that in all probability
they feed on rice, and paddy is very readily taken by them, and rather
than call them Spice Birds or Nutmeg Finches I would call them
Eice Birds. Avadavats are, however, called Eice Birds in the bird
market in Bombay.
If I were asked, then, what I had learned from my failure to breed
Spotted Munias I should say that (1) they must be given plenty of
leafy stalks to build their nest, and (2) they must be given half-ripened
growing seeds to get them into condition and to feed their young ;
(3) dry, cold wintry weather will probably lead to dead young in shell.
I must leave to another article the story of my Green Avadavats
and how I got eggs, but found that what the Green Avadavats really
like are white ants.

By W. H. Workman
In the month of July, 1929, Mr. Newmarch, of Gamages, wrote
to me that he had a pair of these little game birds for sale, and as
I had never seen them advertised before I asked him to send them over.
I had no big aviary at that time so I put them in with a pair of
Californian Quails and a number of Budgerigars. They are delightful
little birds, and the male is very easily distinguished from the female.
The plumage is much brighter and the facial markings are white in
the male and yellow in the female.
They lived quite well without any heat through the winter, and

about the end of May I transferred them to my new waders' aviary
which was just finished and contained plenty of cover in the form of
patches of grass left long.
When planting my aviaries I had taken Capt. Stokes's excellent
advice to include a few giant knotweeds (Polygonum sacchaliense)
so as to give a tropical effect. I was amply rewarded ; at the base
of one of these beautiful plants the little Cuban hen found a hollow
which she carefully lined with dried grass, then closed the growing
long grass over herself and in due course laid ten eggs. She had so
carefully covered up the nest that when sitting she was quite invisible
to everyone, however closely they looked. She sat for about three
weeks, but I cannot give exact dates because of the impossibility of
seeing her on the nest, but one thing I do know was that she steadily
sat through the most appalling August weather I ever remember.
It rained day after day, and I fully expected to find her dead on the
nest or " curse the job and chuck it ". She did neither but stuck
to her guns, and on the 18th August she walked off with ten young
birds smaller even than young Californians. The father bird now
joined her and together they took their little family through the grass
right into the dry and sand-covered aviary house where we found
eight of them. The other two were found dead just at the entrance,
probably too weak to make the house along with their parents.
At this point I took our good Editor's advice on rearing young
Quails, so we caught up the whole family and put them in an aviary
by themselves, where they were fed exactly in the same way as I
described in my article on the Californian Quails.
Mealworms they were not so fond of, but gentles were readily taken
from the first and as they grew older their love for this live food
increased till it only took a few minutes to clean up a dish of grubs.
They are now fully grown and practically in adult plumage, but
they are very wild, not nearly as tame as my brood of Californians,
but so are their parents. In fact I seldom see them in the large aviary.
It is strange how they have changed : when the young were just
hatched the old birds were very tame and wouldn't fly, but let me get
quite close to them, their love for their little family quite overcame
their fear of man.

When grown up these birds seem to do quite well on a varied seed
mixture, such as canary, white and Indian millet, dari, wheat, and
a little hemp. I also give them green food, such as groundsel and
chickweed. I forgot to say that from the day the young were hatched
and for several weeks they had a fresh supply daily of chopped grass
and lettuce.
A good description of these birds will be found in Oglivie-Grant's
Game Birds, an invaluable book to the aviculturalist. I have
noted a curious little habit--when excited or frightened they spread
out their tails horizontally in the shape of a fan. I have never noticed
any of my other Quails doing this.

EMUS, CASSOWARIES, AND KIWIS

</table>

it lives in open country. There are several slightly distinct races,
a smaller one in Tasmania is extinct and another species, also small
but dark, now also extinct, inhabited Kangaroo Island and was
brought alive to France as a present to the Empress Josephine.
Emus are rather taller and much larger than the Rheas; their beaks
are shorter and wider ; rudimentary wings reduced to little flaps.
Bodies covered with bifid feathers, light brown with black marks,
rather narrow, long, and harsh textured. The head and upper neck
are covered with black feathers parted down the middle. The light
blue face is bare in front and there is an indistinct white collar at the
place where the feathers begin.
The sexes are alike but can easily be distinguished by their voices ;
the cock emits a hoarse short note, while the hen utters a kind of
cluck like the sound of a tom-tom.
Emus are hardy with us and should have the same treatment as
Rheas, but their bad disposition generally obliges them to be kept
in pairs ; they are not often dangerous to human beings but frequently
attack mammals and large birds which are put with them. They have

the bad habit of laying during winter. Again it is the cock who under-
takes incubation, which lasts about two months, during which time
he never leaves the nest and can even do without food or water
while sitting. It is, however, better to put them within reach. The
eggs, rather smaller than those of Rheas, are handsome bronzed
green turning to black later. The young can be reared like Rheas.
Cassowaries ( Casuarius )
Cassowaries are known by their short, narrow, and compressed
beaks, slightly curved ; their bare heads and necks which are covered
with very brilliant wattles in different colours, and their foreheads
covered with a horny helmet; rudimentary wings, armed with six
great round pointed quills representing the flights. Their legs are
shorter than the Emus' but thicker ; they also have three toes, the
middle one being armed wdth a very long and sharp claw, a dangerous
weapon. Their bodies are covered with bifid black feathers, filiform
and harsh. The sexes are alike. The young have yellowish-brown
plumage with the helmet and wattles barely indicated. The eggs
which usually number five or six are very granulated and greenish blue.
The male incubates.
Unlike the preceding genera Cassowaries inhabit forests. They not
only eat grass, fruit, and all kinds of vegetable substances, but insects
and small worms. In confinement they will take grass, fruits, bread,
potato, boiled rice and maize, and beetroot; it is advisable to give them
a little meat as well. They will kill and swallow nestlings and small
birds or mammals which come their way.
Cassowaries have most unpleasant characters ; they are spiteful
and dangerous, not only to human beings and animals, but among
themselves as well. Except in the breeding season it is not possible
to keep the cock and hen together, often it is impossible even then,
which is the great obstacle to breeding them in confinement, and it has
only rarely been accomplished. This spitefulness is the reason why they
are rarely to be seen in spite of their beauty except in zoological
gardens, although individuals have been known to become gentle
and even affectionate to their keeper.
In confinement they must be given a large enclosure with a good

shelter which need not be very big. Heat is not required after the first
winter, but they must be brought in at night during winter.
Cassowaries inhabit Papua ; that is to say, New Guinea and the
neighbouring islands, north Australia, Ceram, New Britain and the
Aru Islands.
There are several species, and many races of Cassowaries which
have been studied and described by Lord Rothschild. They sometimes
differ in size, but always in the shape of the helmet and the colour and
shape of the wattles.
The Helmeted Cassowary ( Casuarius casuarius) has two large
long-shaped wattles coming together on the neck. Its helmet is narrow
and prolonged at the back. The helmet and beak are black ; its cheeks,
sides, and back of the head are light blue-green ; its chin, throat and
sides of the neck purple-blue ; the back of the neck orange, and the
two wattles pink with violet wash.
This type of the genus inhabits Ceram, but there are six others
distinguished by the extent and colour of the wattles and neck as well
as by size and shape of the helmet. C.c. johnsonii from north Australia
has two very large wattles ; C.c. beccarini from the island of Aru ;
C. c. altijugus with very high helmet from the Bay of Jeelvink (N.G.) ;
C. c. sclateri from the south-east and south-west coasts of New Guinea ;
C. c. violicollis known by two long violet plaques on the sides of the
neck, from Aru.
The Two-wattled Cassowary (C. bicarunculatus) is distinguished
by the distance between the two wattles on its neck, between which
is a smooth blue expanse. The type inhabits the islands of Wammer and
Aru. There are still three other forms : C.c. salvadorii from Jeelvink
Bay ; C. c. chimera also from New Guinea ; and C. c. intensus from
south-west of the island, which has almost the whole neck light blue.
The One-wattled Cassowary ( C. uniajppendiculatus) is very
different from the above ; its helmet has at the back a concave
depression which reaches nearly to the top ; it has only one small
rounded median wattle which is rosy grey, but two large bright blue
tufts on its cheeks ; the back of its head and upper neck are light
blue with a yellow spot on the nape ; the rest of its neck is golden

The type inhabits the islands of Mysol and Salawatty. Another
variant in the shape and height of the helmet as well as the shade and
distribution of the blue and yellow portions of the neck, C. u. rothschildi
from west New Guinea ; C. u. occipitalis from Jobi Island ; C. u.
aurantiacus from north-east New Guinea ; C. u. suffusus and C. u.
rufotinctus from New Guinea but doubtful distribution.
There are several other species :--
C. mitratus resembling the former but having the front and sides
of the neck red.
C. doggetti distinguished from C. uniappendiculatus by its green-blue
head and the two plaques at the base of the neck which are red bordered
with yellow.
C. philipi with blackish purple throat and red lateral plaques on
the neck.
C. hagenbecki with the neck and head yellow, black cheeks and green
round the eyes ; two yellow and one central wattles.
C. jamrachi with one wattle and black head and neck washed with
light green near the helmet and bright red marks at the back of the
neck and purplish-red lateral plaques.
C. roseigularis , with yellow occiput, back and sides of neck, cheeks,
and throat pale pink, the parotic region and base of the helmet green ;
no wattles.
These six species described from living examples imported from
New Guinea, are from unknown localities.
C. papuanus from the Barau Peninsula (N. G.) has its helmet
depressed at the back ; its cheeks and back of head are white, neck,
throat and front of neck blue, back orange passing into deep rose on
the sides ; one wattle scarcely indicated.
Two slightly different races, C. p. edwardsi and C. p. goodfellowi ,
inhabit the Bay of Jeelvink and Jobi Island.
C. forsteri from north-east New Guinea, without wattles, with
sides and back of head black, face and front of neck pale blue, upper and
back of neck deep blue, the base whitish, a large pink spot under the
ear and the two lateral plaques bright red surrounded by blue.
C. claudii from south-west New Guinea resembles C. papuanus ,
but the back of its head is black and it has no wattle.

<bodyText confidence="0.998026933333333" page_id="56181736"  page_num="73" year="" vol="">
The Kiwis (Apteryx) are a special family related to the Cassowaries
and other Ratites, but highly specialized. They are of medium size
varying from that of a hen to a Goose ; their wings and tails are
rudimentary, their beaks are long and slender and slightly curved,
with the nostrils at the tip. Their legs are short but very powerful,
furnished with three long and sharp clawed toes, and a thumb which
does not reach the ground. These serve them as weapons of defence
as well as instruments for turning up the ground. Their feathers are
long, lanceolate and narrow with decomposed barbs and the head is
ornamented with long plumes. Their bodies appear quite round,
which, joined to their long beaks and short legs, give them a very
peculiar appearance.
Kiwis are nocturnal; they sleep away the day in holes under roots
or some such shelter, rolled into a ball.
At night they run about seeking for the worms and larvae in the moist

earth on which they feed ; they dig for this purpose a sort of tunnel,
turning their beaks round in the earth. They also eat berries and ants.
These birds lay enormous white very thin-shelled eggs. The hen
digs the hole which serves as a nest and the cock incubates nearly
always two eggs. The young birds resemble their parents, but their
feathers are softer. The sexes are very much alike, but the hen is
decidedly larger than the cock, and her head and neck are often browner
and not so grey. She can also be recognized by her cry, which is hoarse,
while the cock whistles ; they both utter a kind of cluck.
Kiwis are easily kept in pens, but their great rarity on account of
destruction by hunters and above all by weasels and stoats introduced
into their country leaves no hope of seeing them in the future. They
would do well in a damp garden or enclosure where they could roam at
night, and they would need a shelter or a big heap of straw in which
they could hide during the day. They would feed on minced meat,
cooked potatoes and, if possible, earthworms. They are hardy, do not
mind cold, are long lived and become very tame. They have laid and
incubated in the Zoological Gardens in London, but did not hatch the
eggs.
Kiwis are confined to New Zealand, where they live in the mountains,
passing the day in wooded gorges, only coming out at night to feed.
Sometimes they come down to the sea shore.

The Grand National Show at the Crystal Palace on the 5th, 6th,
and 7th February was, as usual, a great success. There was a record
number of entries--375 in the 34 classes, compared to 252 last year.
The largest entry--57--came from Dr. G. Elphick, and Mr. Whitley's
team--47 entries--made a very welcome reappearance after two years'
absence. The " Chapman " Foreign Bird Trophy, for the best foreign
bird exhibit, was awarded to Mr. Whitley's Red Bird of Paradise..

A. A. Prestivich -- The Foreign Birds at the Crystal Palace 75
each of the three sections represented by Parrot-like, Seed-eater,,
and Insectivorous or Nectar-feeding Birds, were awarded to Mr.
Whitley's Bed Shining Parrakeet, Mrs. Victor Cooper's Sydney
Waxbills, and Mr. Whitley's Bed Bird of Paradise. In addition to the
above-mentioned trophies, Mr. Whitley won no less than seventeen
" firsts " in the twenty-four classes in which he competed. An
innovation this year was the sticking of a small label stating the name
of the exhibit on each cage, and this must have been of considerable
help to visitors. The Chief Steward in charge of the section was our
member, Capt. E. F. E. Hammond, who undertook similar duties
last year. It is worthy of mention that everyone--without exception
--of the foreign birds sent to the " Palace " last year arrived home
in the same condition as sent out. The only complaint to be made
is concerning the temperature of the hall: at the time of our visit
it was only 48 degrees, and we believe it had been considerably lower.
This is an annual complaint and the management always promise
" to do better next time ", Probably the truth of the matter is that
the furnaces and boilers are worn out, and the stokers daren't put on
much fuel for fear of bursting the boilers--so it would seem that we
must resign ourselves to a cold " Palace ".
The show was again under the managership of Mr. A. J. Platon,,
who deserves the thanks of all visitors for organizing such a tremendous
and representative exhibition of birds--there were no less than 4,400
entries throughout the show.
The " Parrot " classes were even better than last year and contained
some very fine birds. The class for Lories, Lorikeets, and Hanging
Parrots had nine entries, and was won by Capt. H. H. Liddell-Grainger's
Yellow-streaked Lory, in fine condition ; a good pair of Worcester's
Hanging Parrots sent by Messrs. J. and J. W. Underwood gained
second, and third was awarded to Mrs. A. A. Pearse's Bed Lory.
Lovebirds, etc., was the largest class in the section, the best of the
twenty-six entries being Mr. Whitley's very fine pair of Parrotlets--
probably Forpus p. viridissimus --followed by Mr. H. J. Willshire's-
Abyssinians and Mr. J. Sleigh's Bed-faced. The class for Brotogerys,
etc., was not a very great success, having but four entries, Mr. Whitley
gaining first and second with a Tuipara and White-winged respectively,.

and Mr. P. Beauchamp third with a Tui. Mr. Whitley won the class
for Cockatiels, Red Rosellas, Common Ringnecks, etc., with a good
Blossom-head, his Alexandrine being third ; Dr. C. H. Macklin secured
second with a pair of Cockatiels. There were only three entries in the
class for Conures and smaller Macaws, all from Mr. Whitley, and all,
of course, of interest: first a good Crimson-breasted, followed by his
rare Rock Conure and Pyrrhura emma. Common King, Pennant's,
Crimson-winged, etc., had eight entries : Mr. Whitley's King fully
deserved its first prize and his Crimson-winged was a worthy second ;
Mr. Frostick's Bauers were third. The class for " All other species of
Parrakeets " was one of the best in the show and contained some
extremely fine birds, the best of which proved to be Mr. Whitley's Red
Shining Parrakeet (National Trophy winner) ; second was awarded to
Mr. Whitley's Princess of Wales' male--the only one in Great Britain--
and third to Mrs. A. A. Pearse's perfect pair of Turquoisines. The
class also contained .several Many-coloureds. The next class, for
Grey, Timneh, Senegal, and various specified Amazons, provided a win
for Mr. Maxwell, his very excellent RiippelFs Parrot repeating its success
of the last two years ; Mr. Whitley was second with another Ruppell's
and third with a Yellow-shouldered Amazon. " All species of white
and Rose-breasted Cockatoos " produced another first for Mr. Whitley,
his White-crested Cockatoo beating Mr. A. Barnard's Leadbeater's
and Mr. W. Hawkins' Greater Sulphur-crested respectively. Still
another win was recorded by Mr. Whitley's team in the " All other
species of Cockatoos and Macaws ", his Great Black Cockatoo beating
Dr. Elphick's Hyacinthine Macaw and Mr. Maxwell's Great Black
Cockatoo. The class also contained two Spix Macaws, exhibited by
Mr. Whitley and Mr. Maxwell. The last Parrot class, that for " All
other species ", found Primley birds again to the fore--the winner
being Mr. Whitley's Jamaican, or Red-throated Amazon (A. collaria),
and the runner-up being his Red Mitred Parrot; with Mr. Maxwell's
Aubrey's third. Mr. Whitley also showed a very fine Grand Eclectus
female.
First, second, and third prizes were gained by Mr. Whitley's birds
in the class for hybrids and abnormally coloured birds. The leader being
his Royal X Superb Starling, followed by his Crimson-winged Parrakeet

X Rock Peplar and Mealy Rosella X Barnard. In the class for Quails,
Pigeons, etc., Mr. Whitley was again first and second with a good
Monaul and Spur-winged Plover ; Dr. Macklin gaining third with a
pair of Californian Quail. It is to be hoped that at the next " Palace "
show some of our large Pheasant breeders will have representative
exhibits--such should do much to further this branch of Aviculture.
A class was provided this year for Zebra Finches and attracted
fourteen entries--the winners being owned by Mrs. Victor Cooper.
The following three classes, for various specified small seed-eaters,
were won by St. Helena Waxbills (Mrs. Victor Cooper's), Blue-headed
Waxbills (Mrs. M. M. Alexander's), and Bornean Black Mannikins
(Mr. Whitley's). In the class for various named G-rassfinches, Mrs.
Victor Cooper repeated her success of last year and provided the winners
in a splendid pair of Sydney Waxbills (National Trophy winners) ;
the same exhibitor gained second with Chestnut-breasted Finches,
and third went to Mrs. F. R. Hawker for Cherry Finches. The next
class, for the rarer Waxbills and rarer Grassfinches contained a good
Tri-coloured Parrot Finch (Miss M. Bousfield's), which was awarded
first prize ; second going to Mr. J. Walsh for a Violet-eared Waxbill,
and third to Mr. Whitley for a Pin-tailed Nonpareil.
Mr. F. Turnber won a strong class of Buntings, Siskins, etc., with
a pair of Lazuli Buntings ; Mr. J. Cranna was second with a Varied
Bunting, and Mr. E. Allison third with a Chocolate-capped Bunting.
All species of Cardinals, Hawfinches, etc. : first, Mr. Whitley's
Blue Grosbeak ; second, Capt. Liddell-Grainger's fine pair of Black-
cheeked Cardinals, extremely unlucky not to have gained premier
position ; and third, Mr. Beauchamp's pair of Grosbeaks.
The Weaver and Whydah class received more support than last
year and contained seven entries ; first and second prizes were secured
by Mr. H. J. Willshire with excellent pairs of Queen and Paradise
Whydahs, third being awarded to Capt. Hammond's Thick-billed
Weaver.
The class for Common Tanagers found a nice pair of Tri-coloured
(Mr. J. Cranna's) in the first position, with Dr. Elphick's Superbs
and Scarlet second and third. Amongst the rarer Tanagers and Sugar

Mr. Maxwell gained first, second, and third in the class for Sunbirds
with Golden-breasted, Amethyst, and Purple-capped. A class confined
to Pekin Robins secured ten entries, the best of which were those of
Miss I. Hebbert, Mrs. Victor Cooper, and Mr. P. R. Abrahams, in the
order named. A very fine Blue Robin secured the first prize for Mr.
Beauchamp in the class for Shamas, Dhayals, Clarinos, etc., Mr.
Frostick's Clarino being second, and Mr. Whitley's Dhayal third.
The Glossy Starlings and Spreos made a good show; of the seventeen
entries Mr. Maxwell's Purple-headed Starlings were the best; Mr.
Whitley's Salvadori's Starlings being second and Dr. Elphick's Burchell's
Starlings third. All species of Mynahs, Eruitsuckers, Thrushes, etc.,
was won by Mr. Whitley's Himalayan Blue Whistling Thrush, a very
nice Ground Thrush (? species)--imported by Mr. W. Frost--gained
second for Primley, and a Blue Rock Thrush third for Dr. Elphick.
Lady Wavertree showed a pair of Black and White-winged Grackles-
bred in captivity. Dr. Elphick was first and second in the class for
All Species of Hangnests, Troupials, etc., with a Mexican Troupial and
a Yellow-headed Marsh Bird ; third prize being awarded to Mrs.
Victor Cooper's Baltimore Hangnest. A good Giant Cassique (Capt.
Hammond's) was shown in this class. Mr. Whitley was again first
and second in the class for Jays, Pies, Barbets, Toucans, etc., his
successful birds being a very good Toco Toucan and a pair of Royal
Jays ; another Toco secured third for Dr. Elphick. By this time
Mr. Whitley was well in his stride and it was only natural that he should
win the next class, for Birds of Paradise, Trogons, and Motmots ;
this class created something of a record, there being nine entries--eight
of which were Birds of Paradise--two, however, failed to materialize.
This class contained the best foreign bird in the show--Mr. Whitley's-
Red Bird of Paradise ("Chapman" and "National" Trophies),,
followed closely by Dr. Elphick's Six-plumed and Mr. Maxwell's Lesser.
Other fine birds exhibited were Six-plumed (Mrs. A. A. Pearse's),.
Wilson's (Mr. A. Wilson), and Cuban Trogon (Capt. Hammond's).

eared Mesia The former contained a single entry which did not
put in an appearance, and the last, as was only fitting, was won by
Mr. Whitley with a grand Purple-necked Gallirex, in superb condition ;
Mr. Maxwell was second with a splendid little Pigmy Woodpecker
(? species) and third with a Black-throated Tanager. Good pairs of
Grey and Donaldson's Touracos were sent by Dr. Elphick, and a Yellow-
beaked Hornbill by Mr. Whitley.
The foreign section was judged by Mr. D. Seth-Smith and Mr.
Allen Silver, the former taking the Parrot classes and the latter the
seed-eaters and insectivorous. If the entry increases in numbers
much more it will be advisable to have three judges. At the judges'
luncheon Mr. Seth-Smith was, as usual, called on to respond to the
toast to the judges--a task which he carried through with great
applause.
Concerning the Budgerigars, we cannot say much, as they have
almost passed beyond the scope of the Avicultural Society, but there
were no less than 414 entries in the twenty-two classes provided--
something over 600 birds, quite a show in themselves. Our members,
Mr. T. Goodwin and Mr. Andrew Wilson, had the unenviable job of
placing the awards.

Our members may be interested to hear further of the blue specimen
of the Masked Lovebird at the London Zoological Gardens. This
bird, a cock, was mated to a normally-coloured hen and produced
ten young, all of which were normally coloured as was to be
expected. These young birds, which Budgerigar enthusiasts would
term blue-bred, or green split blue, were placed in a large open com-
partment provided with a choice of nesting-boxes, while one of the
hens was mated to the blue cock, her father. This last bird produced
one young one, which was normally coloured, and then died egg-bound.
The others did not settle down to nesting seriously for a long time,
the reason, I am now convinced, being that Agapornis personata
unlike the other Lovebirds, does not as a rule breed satisfactorily if
kept in numbers, but should be kept in separate pairs.

Blue Masked Lovebirds
However, in December, 1930, the keeper one day informed me that
there were two nests of young recently hatched. Later I was brought
a corpse of a young one that had fallen from the nest. It was almost
bare of feathers except on the head, but the few feathers that showed
were distinctly blue. The two remaining in the nest were normally
coloured.
We then examined the second nest and found it to contain two
young birds, almost naked on their bodies but feathered on the fore-
part of their heads. One was larger and altogether stronger-looking
than the other, and this larger bird had a very red bill while that of
the smaller bird was pale yellowish-white. Close examination showed
that the few minute body feathers of the larger bird were either green
or yellow, while those of the smaller one were blue or whitish.
These young birds should have been better feathered, for they
were apparently nearly old enough to feed themselves, and I came to
the conclusion that the other Masked Lovebirds in the aviary were
interfering with them and probably plucking their feathers. In their
naked condition they stood no chance of being reared in mid-winter,
so the only chance was to take them and attempt to hand-rear them.
The larger of the two took soaked biscuit almost at once, while the
valuable blue one positively refused all our efforts to give it
nourishment. On the second day it was dead, while its companion
thrives.
While the failure to rear a blue one was very disappointing, the
fact that two blue offspring have been produced from two nests (five
birds in all) is very encouraging.
The blue-bred birds have now been separated out into pairs, while
a young hen has been placed with the blue cock, and now that we know
that the species will " mendelise " we hope for great things during
1931. The difficulty of course with Masked Lovebirds is to determine
their sex, and I think the surest way is by noting the shape of the
head. We tried the pelvic bone theory but it gave very vague results.

Sir, --Miss Chawner's note on Starlings in the January Magazine
prompts me to add the following. Over a year ago, at the dispersal
of Mr. Spedan Lewis's collection, Miss Chawner herself brought down
for me, with several other birds, a so-called " pair " of Black-winged
Gracldes. These birds, I understood, had been living together for some
time ; for the past fourteen months they have inhabited an aviary
here with various other birds. Although no signs of breeding have been
noticed they have got on amicably, but I always had my doubts of
their being a true pair. One day last week one attacked the other and
inflicted such damages to its head and neck that the bird died a few
days later. This, I think, goes to show that they were both cocks,
though why they should have lived in perfect serenity all these months,
and then developed a murderous hatred of each other is more than I can
say. I believe that a very large number of the foreign Starlings which
are imported are males ; as it happens, at the present time I have
a number of individuals of the Common Glossy Starling (Lamprocolius
chalybeus) : these, I think, are all cocks, at any rate they have all to
be kept in separate aviaries or tragedy would ensue. I well remember
when I was collecting birds in East Africa many years ago, the native
bird-catcher told me that the cock birds were always more easily caught
than the hens, as the former were more inquisitive and came more
quickly to the traps. Hence, perhaps, the large proportion of cocks
imported. G. H. Gurney.

The membership of the Society has grown considerably during the year
and now stands at twenty-nine full members and eight junior members.
Members of the Society reside in practically every town of importance in ;
New Zealand.
Several Executive meetings have been held during the year as
well as general monthly meetings and visits to the aviaries of members in
Auckland according to the schedule arranged at the meeting held on the 18th
November, 1929.
Generally the members have got to know each other better since joining
the Society and in many small ways are doing their best to help each other
particularly by way of exchanging birds and making up pairs.
Owing to the scare concerning Parrot Fever, mostly manufactured by ]
the newspapers, the Government of New Zealand saw fit to do more than the
Government of any other country in the world and prohibited the importation
of all birds from 21st March, 1930, to 21st March, 1931. No other country
prohibited the importation of more than Parrots and Parakeets. Full informa-
tion concerning the remote risk of Parrot Fever was sent to the Government
Department concerned and endeavours made through the Members of the
Opposition, Members of Parliament, and through the present Minister of
Health to get this prohibition removed. It is not known at present what
degree of success has been achieved. The action of the Government has
come at a very inopportune time when, owing to the growth of the Society,
members have been more keen than ever to obtain birds other than the
common species.
In all of the following places are individuals, not in every case members
of the Avicultural Society, with whom arrangements have been finalized for
obtaining birds for distribution amongst members when the prohibition is
lifted : England, India, Malay States, Australia, U.S.A., Panama, and South
America. In addition, means of transport have been arranged with various
members of ships' crews trading to these ports.
Dr. Hopkinson, a Vice President of the Avicultural Society of England,
visited Auckland during the year and during the four hours available was taken
to all the aviaries possible. He promised to see what he could do on his
return to England concerning putting us in touch with reliable suppliers of
birds.
At the meeting on the 9th September, 1929, it was decided to issue Breeding
Certificates for the first breeding in New Zealand of any species of foreign
birds by a member of the Society since the 13th December, 1928. Up to the
present time, nine Certificates have been issued for the following birds :

At the Auckland Winter Exhibition a display of approximately fifty foreign
birds of about fifty species was made and a considerable amount of public
interest thereby created. The general funds of the Society will receive a
donation from the Winter Show Executive.
The thanks of the Society as a whole are due to the few members who
made this exhibition a success at considerable inconvenience and in some cases
at a loss to themselves.
At the Annual Show of the Auckland Canary and Cage Bird Club, one
hundred and twenty-four entries of Finches and foreign birds were staged.
Many species unknown to the public were exhibited for the first time and great
interest aroused. Again the thanks of the Society are due to all the
members who went to the inconvenience of showing here, particularly to
the two members who were practically responsible for the large number
exhibited. An account in detail was given " over the air " of the birds
exhibited in the Winter Show while one talk in general on birds, was given at a
later date. By many methods we have sought to create public interest and
sympathy with our objects.
At the request of several members a letter was sent to the Avicultural
Society of England asking that articles on common birds be published in the
Avicultural Magazine for the reason that, generally speaking, we are not
so advanced in the science here as in other parts. This letter was favourably
received and commented on by the Editor who added a paragraph requesting
the desired information from members in general.
One member had a holiday in Australia and from the amount of informa-
tion he brought back and gave to the Hon. Secretary he must have spent
the whole of the period following up birds and bird dealers. The thanks of the
Society are due to him for having unselfishly made the whole of this informa-
tion available to all members.
With this report you will receive the first pamphlet issued by the Society
and any suggestions or help you can offer in compiling the next issue will be
welcome.
I have much pleasure in submitting the annual Statement of Receipts
and Expenditure at the same time drawing your attention to the fact that
whereas the credit balance last year was #10 8s. Id., this year it is #13 13s. 5d.
I would have you note however that only by the Society receiving a Commission
on birds imported, for the Society, has it been possible to maintain our credit
balance. The concession granted by the Parent Society off the members'
annual subscription is not sufficient to pay all outgoings here, unless
the number of new members per year increases, so that the Society has the
benefit of half the entrance fee.

couple of days, they purloined a nest, almost completed by a pair of Zebra
Finches, which had been built in the scrub on the back of the aviary, and
in which I was taking a very keen interest, and hoping in due time
that I might have some young Zebras. Nevertheless, the Cut-throats took
and retained possession of the nest, and after making a few additions in the
way of a more elaborate entrance, etc., they laid four eggs. I know because I
counted them and they were white eggs. I was very careful of course, very
careful. In about thirteen days they hatched three young chicks with great
wide mouths and bodies as black as a Raven. I know because I examined
them. Of course I was still careful, very careful indeed, and couldn't under-
stand why the parents should persist in keeping away from the nest
immediately afterwards. The next time I looked there were three dead chicks
and an egg, which I very sorrowfully took away. After removing the lining
of the nest, which consisted of feathers and kapok, I anxiously awaited
whatever might happen. In a very short time the parents started
rebuilding the same nest and in the course of a week or so settled down to
business again, and this time laid five eggs and hatched three similarly coloured
chicks. I was more careful this time, and remembered the old axiom, " Shame
on the man who ' has ' you once, Shame on you if he ' has ' you twice." The
very same thing happened again. Three dead chicks of no more value
than three blind mice. To say I was disappointed in no way expresses my
feelings, but I made a solemn promise right away and mentally repeated
Nil Desperandum.
I didn't deserve it, I know, but those parents were determined to rear
young in spite of everybody and everything including myself possibly. This
time they chose their nesting place, a piece of punga fern, open at one end, and
hung horizontally at one end of the aviary. The cavity would be 12 inches
long and not more than 4 inches in diameter. I had very little hope but I
remembered my promise, so when I felt sure that they had sufficient time to
lay eggs I just kept my ears open and my eyes shut. One fine Sunday morning
I heard a faint squeak coming from that nest, and every day for twenty-nine
days that squeak increased in volume. On the 29th day a youngster left
the nest, a cock, the band on the throat being distinct but not complete,
only showing on each side. The following day, two other youngsters left the
nest, both hens, with no indication of a band at all. All three birds are much
like the parents, the male bird having the chocolate patch in miniature on the
lower part of his body.
The youngsters are healthy and able to pick for themselves, and the parents
are just as attentive as any Canary. They have never shown any animosity
towards the other finches. In fact, on one occasion I saw the hen sitting
outside the entrance to the nest, when a Cherry Finch came calmly from the
same nest and sat beside her. This particular Cherry Finch has shown a keen
interest in the domestic affairs of the Cut-throats and is often seen in attendance
on the youngsters. During the whole period of nesting the food has been
placed on a raised table and consists of dishes of mixed canary seed, white
millet, ants' eggs, dried flies, ground breakfast biscuits, ground biscuits, and

Began to build 3rd September, 1929. Built round nest with entrance in
the side, of dried grass lined with flax fibre and pampas grass, in which five
eggs were laid.
Chicks were hatched in 13 to 14 days. Both cock and hen birds
sitting on the nest at the same time. Two young chicks left nest in November,
about 3rd, and a third stayed in the nest and died.
They were fed on ordinary seed, grass seeds, thistle tops, and eggs and
biscuit. Parents were very patient in their feeding of the young.
At the same time, I had a nest of Zebra Finches ; just left the nest, and the
parent Mannikins would readily feed the young Zebras as well as their own
chicks when they were near.

To begin with, in October, 1928, I purchased two pairs from a fellow
aviculturalist. They were turned into an aviary containing Goldfinches,
Gouldians, and Bichenos. Within two days one of the cock birds passed off
this mortal sphere. The remaining three birds built themselves a nest large
enough to house a batch of kittens, but I found the nest was a community
one and was used for sleeping purposes only. This nest must have represented
to them " a thing of beauty and a joy for ever", as they were continually
enlarging and remodelling it. This went on for some months, until in July,
1929, two of the birds mated, built a separate nest from parts of the old " home-
stead " and laid two eggs. The eggs were pure white, but very long in pro-
portion to their width, and did not resemble the usual oval.
It was not long before this nest was broken up and towards the end of
July another nest was built and two more eggs laid. After the hen had been
sitting for a few days, another nest was built, immediately below and adjoining
the first nest, and the second hen then disappeared. I did not dare go near the
nests to see what was happening, but had to content myself with the conclusion
that the cock was a polygamist and had taken unto himself two wives. I
held myself in check for over three weeks, and at the end of that time had to
have a look. I found the first nest contained a dead hen, and two eggs which
had been fertile but were now useless, and in the second nest were two clear
eggs. Of course I had to apologize to the cock bird for my charge of polygamy,
but I do think he might have waited a decent interval before taking on a
new wife.
I now had only one pair left, and nothing further happened until towards
the end of September, 1929, when a new nest was built and two more eggs
laid. This time the hen sat steadily and after about a fortnight, on the 10th
October, 1929,1 was able to discern a movement in the nest. As time went on
I discovered only one young one had been hatched, but it seemed
to be doing well. The youngster duly left the nest, after about a
month, and appeared strong and able to care for itself almost from the start.
The young bird was coloured an even grey all over with the exception of the
red colouring on top of the tail which was identical with the parent birds and

the beak which was black. The beak soon began to turn red, and with the
passing of a few more weeks the grey assumed a brighter shade and the black
bar across the breast appeared together with the black bands on the side with
their uneven sprinkling of white spots. The young bird is a particularly
virile specimen at time of writing, and can be separated from the parents
only by being a shade smaller in general outline.
I found that these birds do well on canary and millet seed with occasionally
some hemp and the usual green food such as thistle, groundsel, etc. The
young bird was reared on this food alone.
An account of this interesting bird would not be complete without a descrip-
tion of the nes b. From the outside it resembles a huge bundle of hay, but the
inside presents quite a different aspect. The ends of the hay finish round the
opening, and usually stick straight outwards without any attempt being made
to weave them together. Immediately inside the entrance, which has a
tendency to point downwards, is a carefully constructed passage about 2
inches across and 6 inches in length which leads into the inner chamber.
This inner chamber, which measures about 4 inches across, is in the form of a
sphere and is lined with feathers and other soft material. The eggs are laid in
this chamber and while the hen sits almost without remission the whole period
of incubation, the cock bird also sleeps in the nest at night, and when the
young birds are hatched, both parents enter the nest for the purpose of feeding.
During the period the hen is sitting, the cock bird changes from a quiet
and somewhat shy bird to a bird with a most ferocious mien. All other species
who look sideways at him are chased unmercifully, and should the hen leave
the nest she gets such a bad time at the hands of her mate that she must be
glad to get back on the nest again. The change to such ferociousness
is most marked, and I have never seen such a display in any other species
except perhaps amongst some of the weavers.

<bodyText confidence="0.9834086875" page_id="56181749"  page_num="86" year="" vol="">
In common with most of the Mannikin species, these birds prefer sleeping
in a nest at night to sleeping on perches or on the branches of trees. I was
not aware of this when I purchased a pair in June, 1928, and hopes so&apos;ared high
when immediately on being put into the aviary they built a nest. However,
the nest was merely for sleeping purposes, and several others were built
before the birds settle down to domestic duties in October, 1928. The latest
nest had been built in the house attached to the aviary, and one morning when
I was playing " Nosey Parker ", to my delight I discovered the nest contained
four eggs. The hen proved a very jealous mother, but despite her care two
of the youngsters either fell out or were thrown out of the nest. The other
two were reared and duly left the nest after about four weeks. The young
ones were light brown in colour with grey-white fronts. As the birds matured,
the colours deepened into the adult colours of dark glossy brown back with
creamy white front and black bills.
The eggs were plain white and in size and shape were similar to that of the
Zebra Finch.

In June, 1929, three more eggs were laid in a new nest, but owing to the
hen being disturbed, the effort was wasted and the eggs lost.
Another attempt, this time successful, was made this year. Five eggs were
laid, but only one hatched, the others being infertile. Great care has been
taken of the youngster, and at date of writing (2nd April, 1930), it is about
ready to leave the nest.
The three-coloured Mannikin builds a dome-shaped nest in a tree or bush,
the materials used being hay, cowhair, and some feathers. At night both birds
sit on the nest. Canary and millet form the main diet of this species. Green
food, especially grass seed in the ear, hung up in bunches in the aviary is
appreciated.

October, 1928. The birds were not fully coloured, but after a few short weeks
of aviary life, the birds were in first-class condition and had mated. A nest
consisting of moss, short pieces of hay, cow-hair and a few feathers
was quickly built, on a ledge in the aviary and about the middle of November,
1928, three eggs were laid. It was not difficult to watch developments as the
nest was easy of access, and was constructed similar to a canary's--open at
the top. The eggs were white, but were so thickly covered with irregular-
shaped brown spots as to make them appear brown with a few thin
white streaks. The size is similar to that of the common Sparrow,
and in appearance also similarity exists, excepting that brown takes the place
of the black markings of the Sparrow's egg.
The hen sat steadily for about a fortnight and one by one the three
eggs hatched, the first youngster breaking through the shell on the 3rd
December, 1928. During Christmas all three left the nest, but a few days later
one died. The remaining two thrived, and were very soon as large as
the parents. Both, I found later, were hens with greeny-grey backs and creamy-
coloured fronts streaked with very fight grey, which later turned to
saffron yellow. A strange fact about these young birds was that they did
not moult the following season, and it was only during last month (February,
1930) that they began to take adult plumage.
Following the youngsters being able to take care of themselves the
parents reconstructed their old nest and laid three more eggs early in January,
1929, and on 5th February the only young to be hatched came out. This young
bird did well and left the nest on the 22nd February. I still have all three
youngsters and all have done well. One, to replace the mother which died
during last winter, mated with the father this season, and laid three eggs in a
cocoa-nut husk, but unfortunately the nest was taken charge of by mice and
the damage was done before I could interfere. They have, however, built a
new nest, again on a ledge in the aviary, and at time of writing the hen is
sitting on three eggs. My experience indicates that three is the usual number
of eggs to be laid, and also that the period January to March appears to be a
favourable time for breeding.

colouring adds greatly to a collection. In size it is a large Finch and no difficulty
is experienced in deciding the sex. The cock is browny-green on the back with
a most wonderful saffron-yellow front extending right through from the beak
to the tail, while on the top of the head is a large bright orange patch. The
hen, on the other hand has head, breast, and underparts a greeny-saffron
colour.
Millet and canary seeds with some hemp, together with the customary
green food were all my birds received, and they appeared always happy and
contented on this diet. As with most of my birds, I do not know which
types appreciate live-food, such as mealworms, etc., for the good reason I
don't give them any. In fact, I haven't any to give them. The soft food
mixture of which I keep a quantity in each aviary, does not tempt the Saffron
Finches, and I have never seen them touch it.

BRONZE MANNIKIN
(Spermestes cucullata )
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.997463625" page_id="56181751"  page_num="88" year="" vol="">
In November, 1928, I was fortunate enough to acquire two of this species
and hoped that they would prove a pair. In common with most of
the Mannikins no points of difference were observable to distinguish the sex,
but I tried to persuade myself that one looked slightly larger than the other,
but without gaining any great measure of satisfaction.
On arriving home they were turned into a partly covered aviary with a
completely enclosed house at the back and containing other birds of similar
size. They were shy and retiring, and whenever one approached the aviary
immediately flew to the back of the aviary, hiding themselves in the ti-tree
or taking refuge in the enclosure. Such shyness did not augur well for success
in breeding, and I began to feel that my purchase was not going to prove a great
success because if they did not reproduce their kind, by their habit of hiding
away when anyone approached neither were they very ornamental.
To digress for a moment, I can assure those who have not possessed them
that they are an exceedingly beautiful bird. Most people would pass them by
without a second glance owing partly to their lack of bright colours, and also
to their shyness which means that they are viewed from too great a distance,
thus losing the effectiveness of the brown and straw coloured speckles of the
head and breast whereon nature has woven a delicate and harmonious colour
pattern.
The Bronze Mannikin is indeed beautiful and its grace on the wing and at
rest would make it an acquisition to any aviary if it were not so shy.
To continue, however, I must leave harmonies and colours and proceed
to more useful information. I soon found by careful observation that these
birds showed a preference for canary seed but also made some use of the
millet kept in the aviary. They also showed a great liking for grass seed in
the ear, and it was interesting to see how they relished the bunches of cow-
foot and paspalum heads which from time to time I hung up in the aviary.
My pair kept together but were always on friendly terms with the other birds
and certainly appeared to keep in good condition.
On entering the enclosure at the back of the aviary one morning, to my
surprise I discovered a domed nest in the ti-tree lining of the enclosure, and in

it three small white eggs similar to those of a Zebra Finch. The entrance to
the nest was in the front and facing the opening into the aviary, and was built
of hay and lined with cow-hair and feathers. I say I was surprised
because I had seen no nest-building operations being carried on by any of the
birds in this particular aviary, and yet they must have been on the job for at
least a week to complete the nest and lay three eggs. None of the birds wore a
guilty air, and I was at a loss to trace the owner. The next morning I found the
eggs had increased to four, but still no parent bird visible to prove ownership.
The next morning, however, on my entry, imagine my delight when one of
the Bronze Mannikins flew off, suggesting firstly that the two birds were a true
pair, and secondly that I might be the proud possessor of some baby Bronzes.
This was early in February, 1929. The hen sat steadily, and I anxiously
awaited results. On the 19th February, I could hold myself in check no longer,
I simply had to have a look in that nest. I had a look--result--three small
moving pink objects and one clear egg. I decided the hen knew her job
and left her to it. All three left the nest together on the 10th March, 1929,
but were still fairly small and could not fly well. The youngsters were a
brownish grey colour and it was particularly noticeable how carefully both
parents guarded them. After about a month they were caring quite
well for themselves, and apart from their plumage being of a lighter shade,
had assumed the colours and markings of the parents. Since then they have
continued to thrive and are at the present time quite indistinguishable
from the parent birds.

The birds, one cock and one hen, were purchased the beginning of 1929
and turned loose in an open aviary after they had been hardened. They
preferred to roost at night in an Olaria bush planted at one end of
the flight. They did not come inside at night during the whole of the
winter, 1929.
During the autumn, 1929, they built a nest in the same Olaria bush and
the hen sat, quite a while, and although left to herself with no inquisitive eyes
looking into the nest, no young flew. The weather destroyed the nest before
any eggs could be counted. The birds remained in good condition during the
spring and summer, 1929, when the cock lost his brilliant hue.
This year, 1930, directly after the dry spell, January and February, the
cock commenced to get his brillant red plumage, and after several weeks of
fine weather he was seen flying with hay in his beak. He seemed to be the
principal nest builder. This time the nest was constructed at the top of some

dead ti-tree branches near the roof of the indoor flight. The nest was an untidy
arrangement, smaller than that of the Zebra Finches, completely covered and
with a small entrance. The inside was lined with feathers.
The nest was so snugly tucked away that inquisitive boys did not
see it. After approximately three weeks the hen and cock birds were seen more
than usual at the feed dishes. The foods used were : brown millet, canary
seed and sponge cake, as well as mealworms. Both the hen and the cock
bird ate the latter, preferring the small mealworms, the largest ones in fact !
they refused to touch. Mealworms were given every morning during the
time the young were in the nest.
On Good Friday, 18th April, three young Avadavats were noticed perched
on the ti-tree within a few inches of the nest. They gradually extended their
field but did not venture far, and it was four or five days before they went into
the open. The hen regularly fed them, they encouraging her with their cries.
In colour the young birds are similar to the hen, slightly darker on the
breast, however, being a brown shade, while they were minus the red rump of
the hen and had the usual dark slate beak of young Finches.
Now the birds are almost as big as their parents. The cock bird on several
occasions was observed having a game with the young ones, inducing them to
fly around with him as though they were chasing him, this being doubtless
a means of strengthening their wings, teaching them to fly, and by their antics
in the air teaching them to side slip, rise and fall in preparation to avoid
enemies.
The young are now totally independent of their parents, and seem to relish
plain canary seed more than the millet seeds.
Several fellow members of the Society have seen these birds and com-
mented on their size.

California,
June 30, 1930.
Dear Mr. Hutchinson,
Thank you very much for your kind letter of May 22. I was indeed very
happy to hear from you and will gladly pass on any knowledge I may have of
breeding Finches in which I am always interested.

If any of your members would like some of the varieties I have I would be
only too glad to exchange some of them for Australian Finches or any rare
New Zealand Finches you may have over there.
I am breeding Indian Shamas and have three lusty young about two
weeks old. You should be very successful over there with Finches as you have
about the same climate that we have in California. To be successful in breeding
Finches you must try and give them their natural surroundings. Have
plenty of thick brush and large bunches of tall grass hung on the walls where
the birds can be secluded when nesting. Eucalyptus branches with the leaves
left on are useful as perches.
For nesting materials the Finches use fine grass and line the nests with any
soft materials such as the feathery plumes of Pampas Grass. I never use
the regular nesting boxes, but recommend gourds that have been cleaned out.
The Gouldians and Long-tailed Grass Finches particularly prefer these which
can be prepared by cutting a small round hole in them for an entrance and
hang them up by a wire. I have a friend who raised eighty-seven Gouldians
this year and her aviary was fitted up with Eucalyptus branches and gourds.
For feeding I use small yellow millet and canary seed all the time, and when
nesting I add gentles that have been cleaned in sand. I keep the Gouldians
by themselves, and when they have young I feed them with egg and biscuit
with crushed hemp and thistle seed if the weather is cold and there seems a
chance of egg binding. Gouldians will not touch insectivorous food.
Long-tailed Grass Finches : They are fed the seed diet and when they have
young, which usually number five, they are given as many maggots as they will
eat, the young being very hungry.
Masked Grass Finches : The same food as the Long-tailed. The Masked y
however, always build in a thick bush or bunch of grass. They are very fond of
charcoal or burnt wood and once they build their nest require a lot of this as
they carry it in their mouths into the nest every day until the young have
flown. When looking at the old nest of a Masked Grass Finch you will see an
accumulation of charcoal, which I believe they use to prevent the nest from
getting foul. Never touch their nest as they desert it at once, but sometimes
the Long-tailed allow you to touch theirs.
Treat Blue-breasted Waxbills and Cordon Bleus the same. They usually
build in bunches of grass. Never touch their nests.
Fire Finches and Lavender Finches are ready breeders once you get them
started. They nest like the Cordons and they do not object to you touching
their nests.
Bengalese are useful Foster Parents. I have had them successfully rear
Grass Finches, Gouldians, Masked, and other varieties of Finches. Just change
the eggs and let them alone.
Parrot Finches are hardy birds and rear their young on seed and maggots.
You can cross the Red-headed with the Blue-headed varieties, as I have a
friend who has four young from such a mating that have just left the nest.
See that they have plenty of ground up or dried egg shell and cuttlefish all the
time. I endeavour to keep even pairs in the breeding pens as odd birds always-
disturb the others.
Cut-throats, Orange-cheeked Waxbills, and Parson Finches are trouble
makers. I have ceased keeping them as they were always throwing the young
ones out of their nests.
For green food I use lettuce and always have sprouted millet and canary
in the aviary for the birds. I keep several trays working, using one at a time
for feeding.

The following is an extract from a letter received from Melbourne :--
" I cannot get Yellow-headed Gouldians, You have to breed them between
Red and Black-heads. Gouldians breed freely in captivity. They start about
May in the winter and continue. I have young ones now just out of the nest.
They look like Grass Finches somewhat and take a long time to colour up.
Gouldians want to be kept in a very warm place, not in an aviary. Here
they are kept, one pair in a cage and breed in the cage. The young
ones are put out in the open aviary, but the parent birds, that is the wild ones,
are never put outside, as coming from a hot climate they would not stand the
cold weather except in suitable cages. Myself, I keep the old birds in cages
with glass fronts on the whole of the winter, removing these fronts in the
summer time. The young ones, however, are exceptionally hardy and long-
lived, and with no trouble you can breed from them in an open aviary."

The Island of Bali, which lies to the east of Java, is well known
for its delightful art and the civilization of its interesting population,
which has been very wisely preserved from being spoilt by the European
settlement. As far as birds are concerned, it contains mostly Javanese
species, half a dozen in common with the neighbouring islands. There
is one special bird, the Rothschild's G-rackle, which was discovered
in 1912 by Dr. E. Stresemann, who named it after Lord Rothschild.
This remarkable member of the Starling family has a peculiar
beak, with a sharp high culmen, the nostrils are hidden by bristles.
A long crest and a short neck give him a somewhat heavy appearance,
while the beautiful blue skin which surrounds the eye adds to the
fine aspect of the ivory-white plumage. The primaries and end of tail
are black, and the legs are blue. It is a very rare bird in skin collec-
tions, and only one specimen was obtained by Dr. Stresemann. A plate
of this Grackle with another species of Bali, the Brown-winged Grackle
(Gracupica tertia ), which was imported last year, appeared in Novitatis
Zoological in 1912 , but the shape of the crest, which stands up, is rather
incorrect.
In 1928 Mr. Walter Goodfellow brought over a very fine collection
of rare birds from the East for Mr. Spedan Lewis, and among them were
five Rothschild's Grackles. I was fortunate enough to secure these

94 P. W. Teague--Some Experiences with Gouldian Finches
lovely birds, and only by their behaviour in the aviary I discovered
that I had two pairs and an odd cock bird. I may mention that there
is no difference in the colour of the sexes. Each pair was put in a
separate aviary, but unfortunately I lost one bird of these two pairs, ;
and when I put the odd bird with the remaining one, they fought )
desperately till I had to separate them. At present I have one true j
pair and two odd birds which I think are both cocks. This pair nested
several times last summer, but the eggs disappeared in each case after ]
the birds incubated them for about a week. I am afraid the eggs were i
eaten by the birds themselves. I consider this bird the handsomest j
of all the Grackles I have ever seen, and they do wonderfully well in j
aviaries. They are most comical when they display by raising their
crests and bobbing up and down. I feed them like any other Starling,
and consider them very hardy. With luck, I hope to breed them this
summer. They certainly are well worth breeding, as we may never
see any more of them.

Early in May, 1929, I purchased a pair of Black-headed Gouldian
Finches. Upon arrival I found the cock more dead than alive ; however,
with great care and the use of Virol I pulled him round. They were
separated for about a month, then, as the weather was favourable,
I turned them both into a small aviary 6 by 4 by 5 feet, which
contained a few Waxbills and a pair of Zebra Finches. They showed
no signs of nesting in the aviary and, as I expected to be away for about
a month, I transferred them to an ordinary double breeding cage
such as is used for Canaries, with a nest-box in one corner nicely hidden
with bits of heather. This was near the end of July. Upon my return
I found they had nested but could only find a trace of a broken egg
on the box. Early in September they nested again (still in the cage),
and on 20th October six youngsters came out. About five days later
the old hen went sick and I had to remove her, having grave fears

of losing both the hen and the babies, but father Gouldian carried
on the good work and reared all six young.
These two old parent birds were kept separated until 17th April,
1930, then again put together in the double breeding cage, as the
weather was far too cold to turn them out. In a couple of days or so
the hen got very restless so I gave them a nesting box and hay, when
they commenced nesting almost immediately. On 8th May I heard
young in the nest, and on 29th May seven fine youngsters came out.
On 14th June these were removed as the old hen wanted to nest again.
On 24th June I again heard young in the nest and on 17th July another
seven young ones appeared. On 1st August I separated the young and
old ones as I did not want to overtax the parents. All fourteen
youngsters were turned into a small outside aviary, where they
remained all the winter and are still out. This aviary has shutters to
protect the interior from rain and cold winds, but no artificial heat or
light is given and I have had to break the ice on the water several
times this winter. There is not a weedy one amongst them and
from what scanty information I can gather, the rearing of fourteen
young Gouldians from two nests in close succession is perhaps a record
for these birds in captivity. They were supplied with an abundance
of fresh seeding grasses (their favourite being Rye-grass), as well as
soaked seeds and millet spray.
A further interesting experience this last season was one of the
young hens reared in September, 1929, mated and laid over twenty
eggs before commencing to incubate. She laid her first two eggs on
the floor. These were placed in the nest and from then onwards she
laid all her eggs in the nest. As she showed no signs of sitting, I
examined the nest, which contained ten eggs, so I removed four, as
I thought ten too many for her to cover. These four eggs were placed
under the only nesting birds I had at the time, namely Golden-breasted
Waxbills. These little Waxbills hatched three young from the four
eggs and fed well for eight or nine days, then I had to be from home
for several days and that was the end of those (middle of October).
Meantime, Mrs. Gouldian showed no signs of sitting, so I again examined
the nest and found she had deposited another seven eggs to the six
I had left. This time I removed six but had no foster parents to sit

them under except a pair of Zebra Finches who had just gone to nest.
Zebra Finches are notorious for the tricks they play if you as much \
as look in their nest; however, I took the risk. Knowing their fondness
for a few feathers for lining the nest I put a nice handful on the floor |
of the aviary. This did the trick and they straightaway put the j
disturbed house in order, but I never dared go in the aviary or look
at the nest for fear of desertion. About 12th November I heard faint j
squeaks coming from the direction of the Zebra Finch's nest, but I |
refrained from looking in that nest. All went splendidly for ten days
or a fortnight and, judging from the sounds, I thought I must have a
fine brood of Gouldians, then I had to go into the aviary to catch three
young Zebra Finches which were interfering. The following morning
a fine fat young Gouldian was found dead on the floor, followed the
next morning by another, and then another. My heart sank at this
tragedy, but the Zebra Finches still went to the nest although I heard
no chirps or squeaks. Two days passed and no music from that nest;
three days, four days, and no news. I could hardly hold myself back
from exploring that nest to see if anything was left alive when, on the
fifth day, I came to the aviary suddenly and saw Mrs. Zebra Finch
leaving the nest and a few moments later I heard the familiar cry of
a young Gouldian. Needless to say, I felt a little excited after the
tragedies that had already befallen this nest, apparently through my
disturbing the aviary in catching the young Zebras. However, my
troubles were by no means over, even though I did not dare enter the
aviary. On 2nd December (rather late in the season) I saw a young
Gouldian leave the nest, followed a little later by a young Zebra Finch.
All the birds in the aviary followed this poor little wretched Gouldian
and made it look thoroughly uncomfortable and, incidentally, it seemed
to startle its foster parents, but they fed it for two days, then on the
morning of the third day it was almost dead through lack of food
and the cold. I brought it into the house and revived it with warmth
and a spot of brandy. With the utmost difficulty I forced a little food
down its throat, with thoughts that this forcible feeding could not
succeed, so I placed this baby Gouldian in the cage along with an old
cock Gouldian. Baby Gouldian had sufficient life left to call for food
and open its mouth when the old bird went near it. I watched and

wondered, will lie feed it ? Ten minutes passed winch must have
been a day to that poor hungry ball of feathers, then the old chap
went and had a good feed from soaked seeds and finished off with a
feed from soaked millet spray, and back to his perch. Another/five
minutes or more passed and then down the old boy went to the millet
spray again, but not to eat--he just stood and gazed at the baby who
by this time was feeling mighty hungry, then it hopped close to where
the old cock stood and opened its mouth. To my joy he fed it, then
filled up and fed baby again, so much so that I thought he would
burst it. The old Gouldian fed the youngster so well for the next fort-
night that it made no attempt to peck and it was not until sixteen or
seventeen days had passed before it cracked seeds for itself. It is now a
fine young bird and ready to turn on its benefactor. This youngster has
so far had an adventurous and unusual upbringing. Of the remaining
eggs from the prolific hen Gouldian another four were hatched under
another pair of Zebra Finches. This pair reared two which left the
nest about a week before Christmas. Unfortunately, these two hadn't
the sense to return to the nest as young Zebra Finches do, so the next
cold frosty night killed them both. The hen Gouldian sat well for
about a week on the remaining eggs, then deserted. I then separated
her from the cock.
In my small outdoor aviaries last season Common Grey, Orange-
cheeked and Golden-breasted Waxbills were successfully reared in
addition to numerous Zebra Finches.

Bronze-wing Pigeons (Phaps chalcoptera ).--These birds did very
well this year, having fully reared ten young ones.
Superb Starlings (Spreo superbus). -- Four young ones were
reared in a large aviary where a good many species of birds are kept.

Pied Grallina (Grallina picata). --The old pair laid several eggs
in their old nest, and young were hatched, but none were reared.
All the young were thrown out of the nest when only a few
days old.
Chestnut-breasted Rock Thrush ( Monticola erythrogastra ).--
One young one was hatched but not reared.
White-capped Starling (Heteropsar albicapillus). --Two young
were hatched and were deserted by the parents when about a
fortnight old.
Japanese Robin (Erithacus akahige). --The same old pair I have
had for four years laid in a nest in a box shrub in the aviary. Three
young hatched but none reared.
Renauld's Ground Cuckoo ( Carpococcyx renauldi). --I have two
pairs of these birds in different aviaries. One pair laid three eggs
under a bush in the large aviary, but only incubated them for four
days and then deserted them. This pair again nested with the same
result. The other pair had three nests between May and August,
and although the hen bird sat well, no chicks were hatched. Some of
the eggs were fertile, and I cannot make out why they failed to hatch.
This pair nested twice under a box hedge in the aviary, and the third
time in a basket inside the aviary shelter. The basket was about

these in two separate aviaries. One pair hatched three young which,
when almost fully feathered, were thrown out of the nest. This
performance was repeated a second time and a third time by the same
pair. The last lot of young were thrown out of the nest as late as
October. The second pair also had young twice but none were reared.
I am really disgusted with the behaviour of these birds, and cannot
make out why they kill their young when almost reared. I may mention
that these birds have aviaries to themselves, and are given a tremendous
variety of food, including live food.
Edward's Lorrikeet ( Trichoglossus hcematodes). --Laid twice, but
all eggs were broken in the nest.

White-breasted Pigeon ( Gallicolumba johiensis). --Reared two
young.
Formosan Bamboo Partridge ( Bambusicola sonorivox). --Three
young reared which I described in the November number of the
Magazine . This is the first time that this bird has been bred in England.
They were bred in France last year, but the eggs were hatched under
domestic hens.
Harlequin Quail ( Coturnix delegorguei). ---These birds laid a
number of eggs but did not incubate any of them.
Swinhoe's Pheasant-tailed Pigeon ( Macropygia swinhoei ).--
A dozen young were reared. I have never come across better breeders,
and although they lay only one egg in each clutch they never stop
breeding and do so right through the winter.
Alexandrine Parrakeet (Psittacula nipalensis). --The Lutino
hen mated to a normal-coloured green cock nested very early and reared
three young in February. The blue cock Alexandrine, mated to a
green hen, reared three fine healthy young. I have now quite a number
of yellow-bred and blue-bred Alexandrines, which are all green. As
soon as they are old enough to breed I am most hopeful that some yellow
and some blue young will be reared.
Several pairs of Ring-necked Parrakeets ( Psittacula krameri)
nested and six young were reared.
Barraband Parrakeet (Polytelis swainsoni). --These only reared
two young this year. They were put into another aviary and took
some time to settle down.
Crimson-winged Parrakeet (Aprosmictus erythropterus). --Reared
two healthy young ones.
No small Finches were reared, although a good many nested. As
I have too many in the aviary I do not expect any breeding results
from these birds.

I have just returned from a twelve weeks' trip around the West
Indies, which included a six weeks' sojourn upon the island of Jamaica
--a paradise indeed for birds. During my six weeks' tour of this
magnificent island I never once encountered a caged bird, with the
exception of some pairs of gorgeous Doves kept in small aviaries at the
rear of the Jamaica Institute or Museum.
How different from the previous port of call, Port Limon, at Costa
Bica. At this port every house or hut appeared to possess dainty
little feathered prisoners, caged in such small cages that they had little
freedom of movement, and could hardly turn around without creasing
their tails against the bars. In a very small area there were scores of
these caged birds, one house boasting of no less than eight cages,
hanging from nails on the outside of the tenement.
In Jamaica how different! Here one can see cages for sale, brass
cages imported from Germany, in the window of a certain store but
one never encounters a caged bird, or at least that was my experience,
and birds are the first thing I look for upon any journey.
There is little need to cage birds in this Island of Springs for each
and every garden, even in the heart of the city of Kingston, is one
huge aviary. One has but to sit on the verandah of the hotel and

Banana Birds and Quits, Humming-birds of many varieties, Grackles,
Mocking-birds, Ground Doves, Hopping Thrushes and Sugar Birds
will appear before one, no further away than 6 feet. So long as one
remains quietly seated one can watch the movements and colouring
of these glorious birds at leisure. The metallic-feathered Humming-
birds are so exquisitely beautiful that one can imagine them as
emanating from a higher sphere than this old Earth. What Great
Artiste designs and creates such astounding beauty in such miniature
form and shape ?
Many of these Humming-birds were little larger than a hornet,
in many instances smaller than the locust--yet they court, pair, nest,
lay eggs and incubate, possessing in their fragile miniature bodies as
much vitality apparently as an Eagle. Hour after hour, from sunrise
to sunset, these amazing Lilliputians sustain their flight upon gossamer
wings, restless and tireless. Not until sunset do they seek rest. An
astounding exhibition of vitality confined in such fragile frames.
After six weeks' observation of the Humming-bird in its natural environ-
ment I am aghast with awe and admiration at the unparalleled beauty
and delicacy of Nature's handiwork--work which makes the craft-
manship of the greatest artists and sculptors appear like the work of
clumsy clowns. What and where IS the source of such enthralling
beauty ?
Hovering and flapping lazily all over the towns and countryside
is the depressing " John Crow ".
This scavenger is welcomed everywhere for they clean up all the
flesh offal, thus keeping the yards and streets clean, a very useful work.
"John Crow" is the popular name given to the Vulture (Turkey -
buzzard). He is a very ugly and depressing gentleman in appearance,
but his great utility is undisputed. He is, in fact, a very useful public
servant, an unpaid scavenger. Out in the countryside one encounters
two species of long-tailed Blackbirds. One has a glossy plumage of
black, with white-ringed eyes and is usually found associating in small
flocks. The other is a larger bird with a head and beak like a Carrion
Crow. These have no white rings around the eyes and are larger and
stouter built than the former mentioned species. These latter appear
to travel in pairs. There is an all black bird with white ringed, Golliwog

eyes, which inhabits the island of St. Vincent, but this bird is smaller
than the Jamaican bird and is also minus the long tail.
The grey Mocking-bird can be found in both town and country.
Like our English Thrushes and Blackbirds, they ofttimes commandeer
a garden and use the same tree for choral performances day after day.
Their song is deliciously melodious.
In the hills, even at a height of 4,000 feet, I caught glimpses of a
little brown bird, difficult to distinguish from our " Jenny Wren ".
These tiny birds were ever so rapid in their movements and shot in
and out of the shrubs like winged mice.
Around the banana-plantations could be seen Troopials, Grackles,
Quits, Yellow-backed Finches, Woodpeckers, Golden Swallows and
other Swallows, Solitaires, Nightjars, Owls, etc., but never once did
I encounter any of the native Parrots. Owls were plentiful, and a
large, almost white, Owl, used to fly across the open air auditorum
of the Palace Cinema at Kingston every evening. Even the
bombardment emanating from the film " Hell's Angels " did not
disturb this fellow. He came across about the same time each night
despite the terrific noise.
In the marshes and pools of the Milk, Black, Cobre, and other
rivers, I saw long-legged Herons, grey and blue in colour, and also
Egrets and Grebes. On the sea-shore at Morant Bay a pair of small
birds, very much like our Grey Wagtails, were strutting and pirouetting
about.
The island abounds in Pigeons and Doves. They have a Bald-pate
Pigeon, a species which I have purchased in England as the White
Crowned Cuban Pigeon. In Jamaica they are known as Baldpates.
They exhibit some at the Jamaica Institute under this name. Their
most beautiful Dove in my opinion is the Mountain Witch, several
pairs of these are exhibited alive at the Institute.
Here is an interesting story for naturalists. There are but few
snakes left on the island, for the imported mongoose has levied a heavy
toll on them, so much so that snakes are now a great rarity. Some
fourteen months ago a fine yellow snake was, however, captured alive
some little distance from Kingston. It was presented to the Institute
and is still there alive. For months it would not eat. They tried it

with rats, mice, and eggs, but it would touch neither. In desperation
the young lady in charge wrote to the New York Zoological Society
for advice. They replied that the snake would have to be forcibly
fed. This feat the staff at Kingston felt themselves incompetent to
tackle. Shortly after, however, the custodian of the birds and reptiles
found a baby Dove dead. She picked it up and as a last resource
wearily placed it in the yellow snake's cage. He immediately sprang
to attention and swallowed the choice morsel. Now he takes a baby
Dove or Pigeon regularly once a fortnight, refusing steadfastly any
other diet.
To bird lovers wishing to winter abroad, and at the same time
make a study of birds in their natural surroundings, let me recommend
Jamaica, where the bird protection laws are unusually drastic. Only
thirteen species are allowed to be shot or taken and none of these species
are smaller than the Ground Doves, and even these thirteen species,
ranging from Ground Doves to Guinea Fowl, Quail and Parrots, are
not allowed to be taken or shot between 1st March and the end of
July, and in some few cases the end of September.
Thus are the birds of Jamaica protected by an Act brought in by
the Legislative Council.
There may be caged birds in Jamaica, but I could not find them.
Yerily Jamaica is a bird's paradise !

I brought over from West Indies the following pairs, etc., of Sugar
Birds and other honey eaters, mostly hand-reared from the nest.
It may interest other members to hear of the manner I have kept them
the last eighteen months since they arrived in this country. I had no
home to take them to and they had to put up with a room in a hotel
with a lamp for warmth. I have lost none. There are two pairs Yellow-
winged Sugar Birds, one pair Purple Sugar Birds, three pairs Dacnis
cyanus, also believed to be pairs, and four odd Yellow-winged cocks.

small greenhouse, where they have a nice aviary. They have just
finished a heavy moult. The first winter they never changed a feather.
At present three of the cocks are just over the moult and are in perfect
plumage. As to food, what they were brought up on they still prefer--
bread, milk and honey, large quantities of bread is eaten, a large tin
of Mellins, milk, water and honey. I find they eat nearly any fruit
if sweet, and to vary their diet from the usual orange, banana, pear,
and grapes, I often give them tinned fruit, they like it much. I tried
last autumn to give them elderberries--the Dacnis ate them, but not
the Sugar Birds. Blackberries they eat. The Sugar Birds eat a fair
quantity of ants' eggs, fresh, but they don't care much for any live food,
though the other birds eat mealworms as often as they are allowed.
I have put oat straw all against the wall, and at night you cannot
see a single bird, they all creep into it, and must be very snug. I
have many banana leaves to assist them in nesting, also the cotton
plant, and hope for a little luck and a little sun to help in breeding
arrangements, as they have been a great anxiety while waiting for
this house to be rebuilt. I hope this may be of some interest to other
members.

Each year brings an influx of rare and wonderful birds into this
country of ours, Birds of Paradise, rare Parrakeets from Australia,
lovely birds from the Far East and the South Sea Islands, and in fact
from all parts of the globe ; and these in turn pass into the aviaries
of rich aviculturists who can afford them, and in whose hands they
receive, no doubt, the attention they deserve. But, alas ! for the
poor ordinary folk these wonderful birds are seldom seen or heard
of again.
In this chapter I will try and tell of some of my birds, the birds of
the ordinary man with a slender purse, birds picked up from time to
time as a collector picks up odd pieces of bric-a-brac, some in a good
state of preservation and others sadly needing repair, to be cared for

and nursed back to radiant health. Oh, what a joy it is to me to rescue
an ailing and sickly bird (for I have an intense fellow-feeling for such
poor creatures, which may be due to some feminine streak in my
nature) from its oft-times filthy and stuffy prison, to tenderly care for
it as for a sickly child and gradually bring it back to health, song,
and beauty. We are told in the books, by those who should know,
to buy only the plump, bright-eyed, and healthy birds, but I am afraid
that I cannot always do this for there are some things above " filthy
lucre ". If there is a sickly bird I feel that I cannot let it linger for
weeks, perhaps months, in a stuffy dealer's shop, passed by each time
by the " cute " buyer until at last one morning as a lifeless emaciated
bundle of feathers it is thrown into the garbage bin ; there are some
things above #. s. d. What if we do lose a few shillings or get the worst
of the deal ? I think that it is the thought of coming off second-best
that worries us most, but perhaps we do not come off so badly after
all--silly sentiment no doubt you will say, but life without sentiment,
especially where our little feathered friends are concerned, is a cold
and chilly thing. And so at the risk of being called presumptious
I offer these few notes on some of my birds, past and present, collected
and treasured.
The Mexican Green Jay (Xanihura luxuosa ).--Some writers have
called this bird gaudy, but to my mind it is anything but that. One
of the smallest of the Jays, being not much larger than a Missel Thrush
but with a longer tail, it is at the same time one of the most beautiful
of the smaller Jays. Clad in a raiment of soft grass-green, delicate
almond green, azure blue, and primrose yellow, yet all the colours
are soft and seem to blend into one harmonious whole. This bird
is rather un-Jay-like, looking more like some beautiful tropical Thrush.
The sexual difference between the two birds is very slight and can
only be seen when they are compared together ; the bill of the male
is slightly thicker at the base, but I have been unable to find any
difference in the plumage.
Jays have always been favourites of mine. Nearly all of them
have one or two shades of rich and striking blue in their plumage,
some are nearly all blue or violet. They are remarkably intelligent,
oasy to keep, and pay more attention to their personal appearance

than most birds except perhaps Tanagers. As soon as a Jay is released
from its travelling-box it will take a bath if it can get one, even if it
can only wash its face in the drinking pot.
I have sometimes received Jays in a terrible condition, but after
a few weeks of judicious feeding and care the change has been remark-
able. If well looked after Jays will live for years, always a constant
joy to their owner.
I think that it is sheer cruelty to confine such active birds to a
cage ; an aviary is the only place for them, but most of the foreign
Jays will not stand the English winter especially the present subject,
and they must be taken indoors. My birds are kept in the winter in
an indoor aviary where the temperature is seldom below 60* F.
Fed solely upon soft-food Jays will not thrive. They require a
varied diet such as various nuts, fruit--especially grapes, currents,
raisins, green food, occasionally a very little chopped meat, also chopped
hard-boiled eggs, dead mice, or small birds, peas in the pod, and many
are fond of sunflower seed and cheese. They are also very fond of
berries such as privet, hawthorn, elderberries, etc. ; these help to keep
the birds in good condition and balance a meat or artificial diet.
Without fruit or berries the birds frequently die with enlarged livers.
All Jays are fond of mealworms.
The Mexican Green Jay is one of the most delicate of the smaller
Jays and consequently it requires more care both in the way of food
and housing. To get the birds cleanly through the moult it is necessary
to keep them out of doors during the summer months. Some birds
are apt to be rather conservative and difficult to suit in regard to their
food, and it is only by trying them with various kinds that one can
find out what they really like.
These Green Jays have an extraordinary variety of calls ; when
they are annoyed or they see a visitor they stand upright, expand
their breast feathers, dance up and down the perch, and utter a strange
series of trilling notes.
I do not think that this species has ever nested in captivity.
The Pileated Jay (Cyanocorax chrysops ).--Twenty or more years
ago this bird was comparatively common, but now it seems to be
seldom offered for sale. Deep violet blue above, and creamy white

below, with the eyebrows, nape, and a moustache-like streak at the
base of the bill a beautiful delphinium blue, this bird ranks as one of
the most beautiful Jays. It is much larger than the bird described
previously, being about the size of a Magpie but with a somewhat
shorter tail. The young birds have the breast a lovely primrose
yellow, but this usually fades as the birds get older, but one which
I possess now still retains this colour and very beautiful it looks, though
its mate lost the yellow at the first moult.
This Jay makes a delightful aviary bird, exceedingly tame but
always lively and extremely inquisitive. It is more frugivorous than
many Jays, feeding upon grapes, apples, pears, and nuts, etc. ;
my birds will not eat mice or small birds, but are fond of mealworms.
He always keeps himself in spotless condition and is always full
of the " joie de vie ".
The Chattering and Blue-cheeked Lories (Domicella garrulus
garrulus and Eos cyanogenys ).--No bird is better named than the
Chattering Lory. Whether " garrulus garrulus ", this bird's Latin
nomenclature, is meant to emphasize its loquaciousness I don't know.
Very often " garrulus " is applied to the most silent of birds, as for
instance Ampelis garrulus , the European Waxwing, a bird which
seldom utters a sound. This Lory is one of the very noisiest of the
whole Parrot tribe, and from morning to night the Chattering Lory
justifies its name. It doesn't scream or screech like an " Amazon "
or a Macaw, but just chatters and babbles along like Tennyson's brook.
Its cries are not really unpleasant but hardly agreeable in a room,
in fact a Lory is seldom an agreeable acquisition to a house, and I think
that it is cruel to confine such very active birds to the confines of an
ordinary Parrot cage. (Lories are very abrupt and quick in their
movements, they jump and spring about almost like monkeys.) Owing
to their feeding upon liquid foods such as milk, honey, etc., they soon
become very objectionably odoriferous when kept in a cage, but when
in an aviary in a bird-room where they can keep their wonderful
plumage in order, exercise their wings, and bathe, Lories are a joy
for ever or at least as long as they live. Lories are among my favourite
aviary birds, and I have seldom had trouble with them. They are
fed upon the usual " sunbird " mixture, that is, a teaspoon each of

Nestle's milk, Mellin's food, and honey diluted in a tea-cup of hot water,
and a quarter of a sponge-cake for each bird. Some species are very
fond of ripe fruit such as banana or pear and grapes, but they are
rather conservative in their tastes. I find that the Blue-cheeked
Lory will not take any kind of fruit but is fond of green oats in the ear.
The Chattering Lory is one of the largest of the Lories, being about
12 to 13 inches in length, but it is a bulky bird, being about the size
of a Grey Parrot, and in colour is a brilliant shining red with green
wings and yellow shoulders and the end half of the tail dark blue-green.
It comes from the island of Halmahera. My bird was a devil incarnate
until it fell in love with a Swainson's Lorikeet, which now shares its
aviary. It is now much calmer and far more gentle than formerly,
though still very excitable. I think that this bird is more beautiful
than some others of the genus which are more brilliantly coloured,
for their plumage always looks so " patchworky
The Blue-cheeked or Black-winged Lory is a very rare and lovely
creature only just about half the size of the other Lory. It belongs
to the beautiful genus Eos, which consists of about a dozen of the most
beautiful Lories known. They all inhabit the islands adjacent to
New Guinea, the species under discussion coming from the Island
of Schurton in Gelveek Bay. This Lory seems to be very seldom
imported, which fact is no doubt due to its very local distribution
and the very remote position of its island home. It is clad like the
rest of the genus in a rich shining red, the throat being a lighter colour
than the rest of the body, the cheeks and ear-coverts are a brilliant
violet, and the feathers are slightly elongated ; the thighs, the wing-
coverts, and the edges of the flight and tail-feathers are black. My
bird, a timid and gentle little creature, lives with an Ornate Lorikeet
with whom she seems to be in love ! Though they sometimes quarrel
and the poor little Black-winged Lory remains crouched in a corner
for a day, they soon make it up again and are fast friends for some
weeks until the next quarrel. The Lories of the genus Eos are by far
the most delicate of the Lories and require careful treatment or they
soon " go off Parrish's chemical food given with their food is often
beneficial.
Cedar Birds (Ampelis cedrorum). -- Until some little time ago these

birds were comparatively rare in the European market, as most of
the other North American birds are, which is due to the fact that
the export of all birds from the U.S.A. is forbidden, but a large con-
signment arrived from Mexico, the winter home of this bird and the
price which had always been fairly high dropped to a very nominal
figure.
Though boasting of no brilliant colours, this bird to my mind, is
very beautiful, its quiet colouring, so perfectly blended, and the soft
and silky texture of the plumage rendering it a very desirable acquisi-
tion. It is a smaller and daintier edition of the European Waxwing.
As an aviary or a cage bird it has not a great deal to recommend it
except its soft beauty, being rather a dull and lethargic bird, except
at times when in a playful mood or displaying. The display is rather
curious, and I have witnessed it many times. One of the birds, usually
the male, will pluck a berry, preferably a privet berry, and with erected
crest and waving wings like one of those silly mechanical toys which
are made in Germany, he will hand it to the hen, who after a little
dancing and wing-flapping hands it over again to her mate, and this
is repeated a dozen times or more until the berry is eventually swallowed.
The whole affair is most ludicrous and amusing to watch. It is usually
carried on for several minutes at a time.
Cedar birds are usually exceedingly tame in captivity. They
are rather large feeders and are apt to get very fat. The gape is
extraordinarily wide and the bird can swallow large berries, in fact
though it is only the size of a Hawfinch it can swallow large hips and
small cherries with ease. In a mixed collection of Tanagers, Sugar
Birds, and various other fruit and honey-eating birds, the Cedar Birds
seem to prefer the sunbird mixture and sponge cake to anything else,
which I am sure cannot be good for them, but after that is finished
they will eat banana, grapes, various berries in season, and occasionally
they will eat soft food. The only noise these birds ever seem to make
is a low whistling cry, somewhat like the noise made by young Starlings
in the nest.
When in perfect health these birds have a very distinct yellow
tinge on the breast, but when out of condition this colour seems to
fade. The characteristic wax-like tips to the secondary feathers,

though not as large and bright as those of the European Waxwing,
show up more conspicuously because the bird is not so brilliant in
colouring.
The Cedar Bird is very common in the United States and is a general
favourite as well. Unlike its European cousin its nesting habits are
not shrouded in mystery ; it nests in the orchards and plantations
around human habitations. It is a migrant, passing as far north
as Canada, returning to its winter habitation in the Southern States,
Mexico, and Central America in the fall. In a state of freedom this
bird feeds almost entirely on various berries, but no doubt supplements
its diet with insects ; but in captivity I have never seen it partake of
any insects whatsoever.
The name " Cedar Bird " is derived from the bird's partiality to
building its nest in the great cedar-trees of North America. It is
stated that it is double-brooded.
A cage is no place for these birds, for when they are restricted to
such a small space they appear to be singularly dull and lethargic,
I suppose we should be the same if we had to spend the rest of our
lives between the narrow confines of a cell.
I have often longed to possess the beautiful Japanese Waxwing,
but have never heard of it being imported into this country.
The Abyssinian Red-faced Barbet (Lybius abyssinicus ).--There
seems to be no reference to this bird ever being kept in captivity until
quite recently when a few were imported. Previous to these the only
other imported seems to have been in 1896, though who it was imported
by, and where it went to, is not known.
It seems to be a typical Barbet and in shape and demeanour also
somewhat in colouring resembles the well-known Collared Barbet
(Lybius torquatus), a bird that I was very familiar with in Rhodesia.
But it differs very considerably from the other Abyssinian species,
the Pearl-spotted Barbet (Trachyphonus margaritatus), a bird which
was imported very frequently a few years ago.
The Barbets are a very widely distributed family inhabiting all
the tropical countries of the world, many striking examples being
found in South America and the Malay Peninsula. Although green
is the general colour with most of the Barbets it is absent from the

plumage of most of the African species, red, yellow, and brown being
the prevailing colours.
Barbets are usually gregarious in their habits, going about in small
parties of about eight or a dozen, though Levaillant's Barbet (T. cafer ),
a bird which is very closely allied to the one under discussion, and
one which I have been familiar with in a state of freedom, seems to
go about either singly or in pairs.
The vocal powers of Barbets in a state of freedom are extraordinary,
the resonance and volume of their voices is amazing, but strange
to say they seldom give vent to their peculiar cries in captivity, though
I once had a female Pearl-spotted Barbet who spent all her time calling
for a mate. This bird was very anxious to nest but I was unable to
find her a mate, so sent her to the "Zoo" where they had a male bird,
and now whenever I see the happy pair they are always so close together
that they seem to resemble one bird. I have seldom seen such a devoted
couple ; they seem to be continually looking at each other like a pair
of lovers or else preening each other's feathers.
Barbets, unless given a certain amount of care, soon "go off " in
captivity. They need rich and varied foods and fresh branches for
perches or their feet get sore. If they have been for a long time in
a small cage or in a dealer's shop their vitality seems to get very low,
and when the moult comes the new feathers never seem to grow
properly but break off in the pin stage. Good food and attention,
however, soon put them right again.
I can discover no notes concerning this bird, except in Marshall's
Monograph of the Barbets we are told that this species is very rare in
the wild state.
Barbets feed mainly on berries and buds of trees, though this diet
is supplemented by insects. An illustration of this bird appeared
in the Magazine for December, 1928.

By Gr. H. GrURNEY
A pouring wet afternoon, with, sleet and snow making it impossible
to go out, must be my excuse for writing and sending up to the
Magazine this very mixed lot of notes, which I do not suppose will
be of much interest to anybody, but I send them for what they are
worth. One is constantly seeing fresh traits and habits amongst one's
birds, which, while they may not be of great value, are often worth
recording, though they may not be so sensational as the accounts of
breeding of new species, or the rearing of some great rarity. At this
time of year when outdoor work may have to be a good deal suspended,
one may, with advantage to oneself, spend more time in one's bird-room,
and by watching the birds pick up new ideas, or perhaps sometimes
have to alter old ones. However, even in January it is not always
too wet to go round the outdoor aviaries, and one can already begin
to make one's preparations for the spring, and all that one hopes it
is going to mean to one. I have just finished constructing a small
cement pool, at the far end of the paddock where my pair of Lilford's
Cranes live ; when Mr. Delacour was here last August he told me that
this species would not breed unless they had access to some water, no
matter how small a piece, and so far my birds have only had a large
pan for their drinking water. The pool has been partially surrounded
by faggots, and as I am pretty certain they are a true pair, I feel I
have now given them every chance, and hope there may be some
results. The Sarus Cranes live in the adjoining paddock, a large
spacious enclosure, but they have never shown the slightest sign of
breeding. On the other side of the Lilford Cranes in another equally
large field, are a little flock of Demoiselles, with Crowned Cranes, and
three White Asiatic Cranes. Beyond a number of stray eggs dropped
about promiscuously by the Demoiselles, there have been no attempts
at nesting; probably there are too mixed a lot together, and as I
am shortly expecting a pair of Stanley Cranes, they will be a still larger
party.
My bird house is very crowded at the moment, so many birds from
the outside aviaries, even with slightly heated shelters, have to be taken

in to the warmer and more regular atmosphere indoors ; all the damp
weather we have had in Norfolk for weeks past is more than they can
stand, and Starlings, I find, suffer as much as anything, and Purple-
headed, Kuppells, Grey-headed, and Spreos, have all looked tighter
and altogether happier since they were given warmer quarters indoors.
My Elliott's Pitta looks perfectly lovely just now. It has recently
moulted, and not a feather is out of place. It lives in the greenhouse
aviary, and the little collection there has recently been added to by
a lovely Ground Thrush (Geocichla interpres), one of several recently
brought over by Mr. Frost. This bird is the most wonderful songster :
early every morning he sits on a branch of a small camelia-tree growing
in the aviary, and pours out a rhapsody of lovely bubbling notes.
I do not know what the experience is of those aviculturists who possess
Green Broadbills ; mine is that they are the dullest birds which were
ever created. I have a very fine one by itself in a large cage : except
when it feeds, it spends the entire day sitting absolutely motionless
on its perch, always in exactly the same place in exactly the same
position. Even when one passes the cage quickly or strangers come in,
it never stirs, as even the tamest bird will do, but sits rigid, looking
at one with its black bead-like eye ; it's exactly like a stuffed bird.
I put a large spray of an evergreen shrub, which toned precisely with
the bird's colour, in one corner of the cage to see if it would try and
conceal itself amongst the leaves, but it never went near it, and
continued to sit motionless on its accustomed perch. I suppose they
make up for their lack of originality by the brilliance of their plumage
and generally quaint shape !
We have just finished building a range of new aviaries, intended
solely for summer use, with a view to breeding ; each compartment
will contain one pair of birds only, and they have been erected in a very
secluded place, nowhere near the other aviaries, where people will
not go, and where the birds will be absolutely quiet and undisturbed.
They are lightly built, the shelters being 6 feet wide by 16 feet
long and 8 feet high, the adjoining flights 6 feet wide, 16 feet
long and 7 feet high. The crowds of people who visit the birds
in the summer rendered private aviaries of this description
indispensable, if one wanted to breed anything ; I have repeatedly
had sitting birds desert their nests from being looked at. Some time

G. H. Gurney--Odd Notes
ago a number of letters appeared in the Magazine witb reference to
the breeding of Lovebirds, and the necessity of providing damp
conditions in their nesting logs for the successful rearing of the young.
I have an aviary full of Lovebirds, mostly now hybrids, but originally
started with pairs of Nyassaland, Fischers, and Black-checked Love-
birds. They were all put into one aviary, more to make an
attractive show than anything else, and I am not at all sure that they
were all originally real pairs; anyhow, now there is every sort of hybrid.
All the breeding boxes and logs are in the outside flight, and although
they naturally get the advantage of rain falling on them, they also
get the full rays of the sun at certain times, and must often get very
hot and dry, and nothing is ever done to moisten the logs. Yet all
the young Lovebirds bred in them, and they must be a considerable
number, have never been anything but strong, robust young birds ;
two particularly lively looking youngsters emerged last week
(3rd February), and indeed, the old birds seem to breed nearly as freely
in the winter months as they do in the summer.
One of the few birds I have in the past always thought I could
never keep here were Flamingos, for the simple reason that I have not
had, up to the present, what I considered suitable accommodation
for them, my small pond in the garden is 6 feet deep and cemented
all round (it was constructed in case of fire), and merely does for my
little collection of Waterfowl and would be impossible for large wading
birds like Flamingos, and one of the things I do like to see is birds
kept in more or less natural looking surroundings. I have seen a.
solitary Flamingo kept in a backyard, and I have seen one kept in
an aviary, it was true the aviary was a large one, but anything more
out of place than they looked cannot be imagined. I have got three
beautiful large shallow ponds, and a long stretch of river, all ideal
places, but they are half a mile away, too far ofi for one to be able
to enjoy the birds and so no good. However, I hope I have now
constructed what should be a suitable place and that I shall now be
able to keep a small flock of these quaint and amusing birds. A very
large shallow pool has been made in one of the enclosures, easily seen
from the garden ; the back of it arranged with large blocks of stone
from Lancashire and tall waterside plants planted at the sides. The
pool is supplied with water from the river pumped up by a ram;

and I feel that anyhow, my Flamingos, when they arrive in early
April, will look fairly suitably housed here.
A few weeks ago a small travelling circus and menagerie paid a
visit to Norwich. On my going to see what it contained, I was surprised
to find a number of large birds not often seen in this sort of show.
Although confined in cages in which they could barely turn round,
in fact in one instance the bird actually could not turn round, but
always had to stand facing the bars, and the crowd, gazing at it from
the other side ; but the wonderful thing was that in spite of their
tiny cages, each of these birds was in the most perfect condition
imaginable, all obviously healthy, and not a feather out of place ;
they comprised a White Rhea, a very fine Asiatic White Crane, in
faultless order, some Demoiselles, a Cassowary, two absolutely perfect
Angolan Vultures, and three splendid Virginian Eagle Owls. The
cages were very smartly painted outside, and scrupulously clean
inside, the birds were fed and watered from the outside, and anything
left over was at once removed. The floors of the cages were lightly
covered with sand, but the birds' feet in every case looked all right.
The question of the cruelty or otherwise of keeping large birds of this
description in such tiny quarters need not be gone into here ; on
my first visit the keeper, who obviously took a good deal of pride in
his charges, told me that the Rhea and the White Crane were the only
two specimens of their kind alive in England, and would hardly believe
me when I told him if he cared to come out, 3 miles from Norwich,
I could show him several others of the same sort l Against the perfect
condition of these large birds, a number of Cockatoos and Parrakeets,
reasonably housed in ordinary Parrot cages, and not overcrowded,
nearly all looked miserable ; poor moulting specimens, with broken
feathers, and some nearly naked from feather plucking--an extra-
ordinary contrast to the others. Some fine mammals and a few
Hyenas and Bears were in perfect condition, and like the big birds
kept absolutely clean, in cages newly painted white.
These odd notes are, I fear, very varied, but then one of the charms
of our hobby is its different aspects, and one may always learn
something fresh even from birds kept in travelling menageries, or in
tiny cages, to birds more orthodoxly kept in ordinary aviaries by
clever and intelligent aviculturists.

Sir, --I read with, much pleasure Mr. Porter's most interesting
article in the February number, " The Blue Thrush in Sicily " and,
having possessed this, and the closely allied species, the Rose-breasted
Rock Thrash, for some seven or eight years, I should like to endorse
his opinion of the desirability of these birds as pets in aviary
collections.
To say the least, these birds are very enchanting, extremely docile
and most excellent songsters, and that such a bird should command
such little attention by the aviculturist makes one wonder if many
are conversant with it for, sad to relate, my experience is that the
supply is always far greater than the demand yet, as Mr. Porter
mentions, few birds are as attractive and many aviculturists will pay
a far higher price for less interesting birds.
Mr. Porter mentions that few bird dealers offer them for sale,
this, in my opinion, is because there are so few people interested in
them either through lack of knowledge or by thinking they are delicate,
as some of the earlier books suggest, but many birds that used to be
considered delicate are to-day simplicity itself to keep. I had this
mentioned to me quite recently by a prospective buyer, but since
my assuring him of the reverse he has purchased one. My experience
is that they are quite as hardy as our own resident Thrash.
I have, for the last seven years or more, regularly offered these
birds in various bird periodicals, and since joining the Society listed
them in my adverts, but I think I am about the only dealer who has
done so. In conclusion, I trust that Mr. Porter's article will be
instrumental in swelling the ranks of Thrash enthusiasts, as no collection
of birds is complete without a representative of this beautiful group,
and once procured no aviculturist will be without one.
P. H. Hastings.

Sir, --It is usually the custom of aviculturists to keep tropical
birds imported in autumn more or less closely confined in heated
quarters until the end of the cold weather, which, in our uncertain
climate, cannot really be said to be much before the third week in
May. The result is that such birds seldom breed before the summer
of the following year. Observing that unpreventable illness among
foreign birds is much commoner during the warmer months and that
winter is a healthier season than summer, I decided to experiment
lately in a new direction. Last autumn I received, among other
additions, some Fairy Bluebirds, Layard's Parrakeets, Blue-winged
Grass Parrakeets, a Rosenberg's Lorikeet, an Amboina King Parrakeet
and an Antipodes Island Parrakeet. When these were thoroughly
rested and obviously in first-rate health, I transferred them from their
very warm quarters--temperature 70*-80* Fahrenheit--to outdoor
aviaries with shelters heated to a temperature of 60*-70*.
The venture has been quite as successful as if I had waited for
summer to arrive, and no birds have died.
By watching which specimens showed complete indifference to
the weather and never took advantage of their warmed retreats until
driven in at night, I was even able to harden some off altogether.
The two hen Crimson-wings actually accomplished a complete moult
in mid-winter with the heat already gone and are now in show condition.
The Amboina King also showed such complete indifference to low
temperatures that she also has had no artificial warmth for months.
The Lorikeet seemed to appreciate the heated shelter for the first few
days, but is now always in the flight; she is just completing her moult.
The Layards and Bluewings I shall not deprive of heat for some time
although the former spend many hours in the open, even on cold days.
The Fairy Bluebirds do not leave the shelter very much, but as
I have seen one young cock, in moult, singing in the open amid falling
snow I do not think they can be very delicate. The only bird to get
ill was the Antipodes Island Parrakeet. This I hardened off apparently
quite successfully and it seemed indifferent to bad weather until a
very sharp frost set in, which caused it to contract a severe chill,

Parrakeets, is the one type of winter weather injurious to this otherwise
robust species.

DARK PHEASANTS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99651825" page_id="56181789"  page_num="118" year="" vol="">
Sir, --In the February number of the Magazine, Capt. J. S. Reeve
remarks that he bred Dusky Pheasants, alias " Melanistic Mutants ",
and that they were smaller than common Pheasants. This is certainly
an unusual fact, as they are as a rule larger and stronger, but they
do vary in size. As to the colour of the cocks, it only shows that his
birds have been changing, as it has been noticed in many parts of
France, into a much darker form, where females have lost all traces
of light markings, being black, glossed with violet and green, with
blotches of mahogany red, when cocks are all green and blue, with
only lighter rump and tail, and no red markings on the flanks nor
yellow ones on the upper parts.
There is no doubt that the birds are evolving and will ultimately
produce an all bronze-green variety, where both sizes will be practically
alike. This new darker mutant has spread tremendously in France
during the last year, and had not been noticed before.

THE PARROT HOUSE AT THE ZOOLOGICAL GARDENS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998913571428571" page_id="56181789"  page_num="118" year="" vol="">
Sir, --Your contributor, Mr. A. A. Prestwich, animadverts--without
any too much urbanity--upon a criticism I ventured to pass on the
housing of the Parrots in the Zoological Gardens.
How ready I was to eat humble pie when I sat down to his article
--how glad to forgive his unkindly words, such as " hysterical "
and " puerile "--how eager to be shown that I was in the wrong
and that all was for the best in the best of all possible Zoos !

Mr. Prestwich disappointed me by failing to refute any one of my
points. He admits some of my " puerile objections ", and brushes
aside others without argument. It is not reasoning, but a mere flat
statement of opinion, to say that " The cages containing pairs of
Cockatoos are quite large enough for the purpose." I only wish he
could persuade me that the Triton, the White-crested and the Rose-
crested Cockatoos in Regent's Park are neither cramped nor bored,
but it so happens that I have seen birds of these species in other
and more comfortable conditions, and the difference was obvious.
Mr. Prestwich is presumably well satisfied with the treatment of the
Zoo's Great Black Cockatoos--one in a small cage, the other chained
to a perch ; but I happen to have seen a pair of these birds (some-
where in Sussex) enjoying each other's society and a chance of
movement, and I cannot but feel sorry for the specimens in the Z.S.
Gardens.
Being no more of an ornithologist than the Consul in Puccini's
opera, I might have been convinced by the defence of the practice
of chaining Macaws to perches, if I had not read Lord Tavistock's
opinion: " It is customary to keep them chained by one leg to a
perch, but this is not fair nor humane treatment for creatures that
are active, playful and intelligent."
Let me quote the same authority in answer to the suggestion that
the best use is being made of the new Parrot House : " One wishes that
the Zoological Society, which has ample money for the purpose, would
provide flight cages at least for all its Broad-tailed Parrakeets, Lories,
Lovebirds, and the like. There is plenty of room in the new Parrot
House, where the space vertically is insufficiently utilized."
I am highly grateful for some of the charming sights provided
by the Zoological Society, and my word of protest was utterly
disinterested--yet since it was published I have found myself accused
of (a) malice, (b) crankiness. I must console myself that in the old
days those who suggested that the Zoo Parrots should be given water
(of which they were deprived, I believe, during the first forty or fifty
years of the existence of the collection) were no doubt also called
"hysterical" and "puerile".

the readers of your magazine, the principle, namely, whether even our
Zoological Gardens (so superior in many ways to those one may see
in travelling) are to be held above criticism.
Richard Capell. j
The above letter was shown to Mr. Prestwich, who replies as
follows :--
After reading Mr. Capell's letter I pondered for some little time as
to whether any useful purpose would be served by my replying, for 1
it would seem that he has very decided views concerning the Parrot
House, and it would take someone much better versed in argument than j
I to modify those views. It is obvious from Mr. Capell's letter to the
Daily Mail, part of which was quoted in The Avicultural Magazine,
August, 1930, that he heartily dislikes the House and much pertaining
thereto, or he would not stress the fact that " this is simply the old
restaurant, quite inadequately adapted . . ." Mr. Capell says that I
admit some of his " puerile objections ". The only points on which I
agree with him are in regard to the lack of sunlight and the existence
of a very limited amount of teasing. Concerning the size of the cages,
which are used for the larger Cockatoos, etc., these are considerably
larger than those used in the old House, and are certainly much larger
than most people employ for such birds. Pairs of these have been
put together as they are apparently much happier thus than singly.
Doubtlessly Mr. Capell has seen Cockatoos, etc., kept under other
and more comfortable conditions than those prevailing at the London
Zoological Gardens, but then they have probably been in the ownership
of private aviculturists with only a limited number of birds to house,
and who have not to consider their possessions from a display point.
Objection is taken to the practice of chaining Macaws to perches,
and Lord Tavistock's opinion is cited. Possibly Mr. Capell is not aware
that, while Lord Tavistock has kept a large collection of Psittacine
birds for a great number of years, and is undoubtedly the foremost
authority on Australian Parrakeets, he has never specialized to any
extent with the larger Parrots, Macaws, etc. And although due respect
must be paid to his condemnation of the standard practice, one must
not lose sight of the fact that it has been found by practically everyone

who has kept Macaws that they do better on stands than in cages ;
in addition, if kept in cages they are almost certain to break their
tails. No one visiting the Parrot House can say that the Macaws and
other Parrots are not perfectly happy ; and it is evident to anyone who
gets to know them that they much appreciate the attention of the
public. There is no doubt whatever that the new House is a very great
improvement on the old, and the health of the birds is very good indeed.
I am given to understand that except for one or two detrimental
comments, the new House, and the conditions under which the birds
are kept, has been universally approved by those who really under-
stand Parrots. Regarding the last part of Mr. Capell's letter, I can but
express an opinion, and that is that the authorities welcome criticism
and suggestions and are the very last to consider all their actions above
reproach. Perhaps some of those members who have visited the
Zoological Gardens since the opening of the new Parrot House would
give their views and impressions.
Arthur A. Prestwich.
[It is very easy to criticize, and we should all have liked a brand new
House, and a free hand to provide a long range of outside aviaries, but
having to make do with an existing building, those of us who had a
hand in the alterations claim that we have made the best use of our
opportunities. As to the objection to the practice of keeping Macaws
on stands, one would like to ask in what other way a representative
collection of these birds could be kept, failing the space necessary for
a series of enormous flights ? As to the Cockatoos being bored when
kept in pairs, one does not hesitate to say that they are far more likely
to be bored if kept singly.-- Ed.]

DUYVENBODE'S LORY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9831105" page_id="56181804"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
The type of this very distinct Lory is in the Brussels Museum,
to which it was sent from New Guinea by C. W. K. van Duyvenbode
in 1884, and M. Alph. Dubois named it Chalcopsittacus duyvenbodei.
The typical form occurs in northern New Guinea from the east coast
of Geelvink Bay to Humbolt Bay, and Professor Newmann has
discovered a slightly different race, which he has named C. d. syringanu-
chalis from Berlin Hapen to Astrolabe Bay, Sepik Biver.
The first example of Duyvenbode's Lory to reach London was one
received by Mr. Spedan Lewis in November, 1929, and most generously
presented to the Zoological Society, where it remains in excellent
condition. Subsequently, Mr. St. Alban Smith obtained a pair in
Singapore, and presented them to the Zoological Society, and later
sent another which is now in Mr. Whitley's collection at Primley.
The accompanying plate, which has been drawn from life, renders
a description of this species unnecessary. It is about the same size
as the Black Lory (C. ater), a species to which it appears to be closely
allied.

By P. B. Webb
I am afraid that this report is very late ; nevertheless, should
there be anyone wishing to try the experiment in 1931, there is still
enough time to make a start.
About 1st May, 1930, I procured seven pairs of Orange Weavers.
I kept them indoors for about a week. On 10th May they were
transferred to a box 4 feet high by 4 feet long by 2 feet, with a wire-
front. This box was placed in my garden, facing south.
I had in my aviary a true pair of Paradise Whydahs and they
were also placed in the box.
The whole family seemed to be quite happy in their new quarters,,
though the weather was by no means warm. They were, however,,
covered up at night with a large piece of sacking.
On 18th May I cut a hole in the netting, about three inches square,
fixing a perch just below, both inside and outside the wire. So far
as I know none of the birds left home that day. The following day,,
about five were perched on a rose bush near by at midday, while the-
rest seemed to be inside.
On the 20th the box was inspected again about midday, and the-
only birds still inside were the two Whydahs. They seemed to be
rather foolish, and though the Weavers were passing , in and out
constantly, they did not apparently find the exit until the afternoon
of the 22nd. They were quite a failure as they were never seen again..
The Weavers, however, were enjoying themselves and seemed
to be all present, though I could not be quite certain. However, on
the 23rd I counted thirteen at breakfast time.
They seemed to spend most of their time beside the stream which
runs through the grounds. Every morning and evening they appeared
at the box in the garden, in force, though they paid frequent visits
during the day in ones and twos.
On the morning of the 23rd I placed the food on top of the box,
and after closing up the hole in the netting, placed two more pairs,
in the box.

The next morning I opened the hole and put the food inside again
as nsnal. In the evening the new pairs were seen to enter the box
with the others for their evening meal. They were marked with rings,
so it was always easy to pick them out.
All went well for the first two months, during which time the
cocks were getting their orange plumage and singing from the top of
the shrubs and hedges. They seemed to choose the very highest twigs
for the latter job, and were very lovely to watch. The sexes seemed
about even.
About the middle of July the House Sparrows discovered that a
really handsome meal was always to be found in the box. Though they
did not seem to harm the Weavers in any way, I found that it now
took about a pint of seed in the day instead of the usual small amount.
Each day their numbers seemed to increase, so deciding something
would have to be done, I made a wire netting funnel; inserting this
in the hole in the front of the box, I had an extremely efficient
Sparrow trap.
The Weavers, it seemed, were not upset by the funnel, and went
in just the same, but once in they had to stay until the time came to
remove the Sparrows.
At the end of about two weeks the Sparrows were reduced to
reasonable numbers, but though the Weavers were still in the garden
they, with a few exceptions, no longer visited the feeding box.
I believe that once a Weaver was caught in the Sparrow trap it
did not return, but instead, found its food as a wild bird does.
As the weeks went on the Weavers seemed to grow slowly less in
number. I am satisfied that this was not because the birds were
dying, but because they were dispersing, the reason being that they
had ceased to feed in the box and therefore had no wish to remain.
I managed to catch up four birds in late October, all of which
were cocks, one being a Scarlet-Capped Weaver.
It is noteworthy that no bird once liberated spent a night in the
feeding box. It was never discovered where they slept. Two nests
were found near the stream, one in a shrub (spiraea) and the other
in a bamboo. Both were empty. So far as is known, the birds did
not breed.

It is my intention to repeat the experiment this year, and, paying
special attention to the following points, I hope to turn failure to
success.

(1) Arrange the feeding box so that, if possible, the Sparrows

I would say, in conclusion, that the experiment was very interesting
indeed, even though it was a failure. It was successful, however, in
the fact that the birds were seen very regularly, and the beauty of the
cocks at liberty was very wonderful.

GREAT BUSTARDS AT SCAMPSTON

<bodyText confidence="0.997832285714286" page_id="56181807"  page_num="128" year="" vol="">
By W. H. St. Quintin
At the beginning of 1901 there were five Great Bustards here : two
pairs of my own and a third male, which I was taking care of for a
friend. I happened, the other day, to come across a photograph
showing the three males (the two females were in an adjoining
enclosure) ; and our Editor kindly consented to find a place for it
in the Magazine, perhaps being influenced by the thought that, owing
to the growing scarcity of this splendid species, it might not be easy
to get such a record in a few more years, with increasing population
and the accompanying motor-cars and aeroplanes.
The male Bustard, nearest my bird-keeper, Arthur Moody (now in
charge of the fine collection at Lilford Hall), had been here ten years ;
and when this photograph was taken would be between 11 and 12 years
old. The bird nearest the camera, with the very rich chestnut neck-
bands, and the third male on the left, with the two females in the
next enclosure, were privately imported from Spain, with other
interesting birds (including some Pratincoles), by Mr. Meade-Waldo
and myself in 1897. I mention these two females, though not in the
picture, because one of them a few months after this photograph was
taken distinguished herself by hatching a young bird, as fully described
by me in a back number of the Avicultural Magazine (New Series,

vol. ii, p. 188). We were unfortunately unable to rear it, that summer
being exceptionally damp and cold.
The Great Bustard is not a bird of a confiding nature ! If its
nervousness is overcome by care and patience, it becomes aggressively
impudent, but never tame and trusting ! As a contrast, four years
later, we reared two Little Bustards at Scampston, in another wet
and chilly summer. But in that case the mother bird, being thoroughly
tame, allowed us to fix the light of an ordinary garden frame over the
nest, so that, during incubation and even after hatching, for several
critical weeks, the birds could creep under and were kept dry.

[The following Notes formed the Presidential Address to the
Yorkshire Naturalists' Union, delivered at Scarborough on 11th
December, 1909. They were published in The Naturalist for March,
April, and May, 1910, and although written more than twenty years
ago are of such interest to aviculturists that we have sought and
readily obtained the permission of the Author and the Editor of The
Naturalist to republish them.]
I feel that I have no business to select such a subject as I have chosen
for my address, unless I can show that I have also some contribution
to offer, however humble, to the science which is the bond which
unites us together. Now, what can an aviculturist do in this direction ?
How far is the keeping of birds in captivity of any scientific value ?
I put aside altogether the keeping of birds for exhibition purposes.
It cannot be claimed that science learns much from bird shows as such,
although, of course, the demand for rare and beautiful " exhibits " does
stimulate the importation of uncommon species, and brings into the
country birds which would otherwise not come into the possession
of those who wish to keep them for purposes of study.
I think an aviculturist's hobby is only likely to produce scientific
results if his birds are kept, first of all, in good health and condition ;

and secondly, as far as possible under fairly natural conditions, and
especially if they can be induced to breed.
If an aviculturist is fortunate and successful, he can, to a considerable
extent, supplement the work of the scientist in the laboratory and
museum, by filling up gaps in the history of a bird, and by elucidating
points which it may not be possible to observe in the case of a bird
when at liberty. As examples, I will presently refer to certain habits
of the Sandgrouse and Brush Turkey.
In referring to my birds, I mean to treat of some facts, which
besides being curious and interesting, have not been recorded in the
standard ornithological works which we generally consult; though
sometimes they have been noticed in some of the journals. At the
same time I will, as far as I can, only deal with such actions and habits
as might be expected of birds in a state of freedom, if one had oppor-
tunities of seeing them; and to steer clear altogether from noting the
eccentric behaviour of individuals which, though often amusing enough,
are of no scientific value.
I will deal with the Bustards first, for it is a family in which I have
long taken great interest. I have kept Great Bustards for some
twenty-three years, and during that time I have never been without
specimens.
My first Great Bustard came to me from a respectable London
dealer, who was as ignorant as I was then of the extreme care required
in packing these birds. There were no signs that the hamper had met
with ill usage on the way, but the poor thing reached me with one
wing and both thighs broken, and I learnt then how fragile are the bones
of these heavy and excitable birds. This was a very bad start, but
the late Lord Lilford most kindly set me up with several others ;
and what was of still more value, he taught me how to keep them.
They must have shelter from wind and wet, and above all things, they
must be kept out of danger of sudden frights. The Great Bustard,
however thoroughly tamed, if suddenly scared, is as likely to injure
himself as one of the larger antelopes or deer, in captivity, and one
cannot say more than that! I can myself speak to several disastrous
instances of damage and even death resulting from sudden frights.
A friend of mine lost a female bird which was peacefully feeding on the

lawn, but which dashed itself against the house when startled by the
sudden apparition of a gipsy coming round the corner. A male, which
I had kept for thirteen years at Scampston, was frightened by a gardener,
whom he did not know, coming up with a broom on his shoulder,
and in his alarm fractured a wing bone close up to the body, opening
an artery at the same time, and bleeding to death in a few minutes.
A specimen of the great Australian Bustard, which had just been let
into his paddock for the summer, after being confined in an aviary
all the winter, leaped into the air in play, as these birds do, and coming
down heavily, broke both his thigh bones, and had to be destroyed.
This was in the London Zoological Gardens.
In 1897, with a friend, I imported several Great Bustards from the
South of Spain, one of which, a female, still survives. Another of this
batch distinguished herself by hatching the first young Bustard ever
hatched by a tame bird in this country, so far as records go.
And here I may say that the male Great Bustards are not fully adult,
with, in the breeding season, their chestnut pectoral bands ; and their
pouches are not fully inflatable, till they are about five years old.
The females probably breed when a season younger. The female
mentioned above as having hatched a young bird in 1901, was just four
years old ; while a young male of the same age was not that year
in fully complete nuptial dress at the time she was incubating.
There have been sometimes wild suggestions that the Great Bustard
if domesticated would be of great economical value. The argument
being--the Turkey is an undoubtedly useful bird, and why not also
the Great Bustard, which is very nearly as big ? I need hardly say
that these enthusiasts ignore some essential facts connected with the
Bustard's nature : First, it is in no way related to the order which
contains the fowls and gamebirds ; secondly, it is not adult till it is
four or five years old ; thirdly, it lays only two, or at most three eggs ;
fourthly, though several persons in this country have for years been
trying to breed them in captivity, no one has yet been successful!
The hatching of a young Great Bustard in captivity, being such an
exceptional event, perhaps I may refer to it. At that time I had a
fine old male in full display. In addition to the four-year-old male
above mentioned, there were two young hens of the same age running

with him ; and besides the one which hatched, the other also laid eggs,
but they were unfertile. The male never seemed to notice but the one
female, and so far as it goes, this case points to the birds having paired,
though some persons who have watched Great Bustards in the wild
state consider them polygamous.
In the enclosure there was a group of coarse grass tussocks, and the
hen bird made a deep scratch, with no lining amongst them ; and when
she was sitting she was well concealed. I was amused to see that both
the males were quite aware that the hen was hidden in the grass, and
used to strut round the place, peering forward with outstretched necks.
When they came too near, the hen, still hidden, would sometimes
utter several gruff barks, as if warning them to clear out. The Great
Bustard, by the way, has no note except this bark, which is not loud,
and a curious whining whistle, which carries a long way, and is
particularly difficult to locate. This is, I believe, the cry of the young,
but it is occasionally used by the adults, when separated from their
companions, and in distress.
Though peaceable enough at most times, the old male would not
allow the young male to " display " in his sight, when the female was
sitting. He spent most of his time in a distant corner of the paddock,
occasionally dropping his wings, and inflating his pouch, till he began
to moult. In the wild state the hen birds in the early summer leave
the males, and go off to the standing crops to lay, and the sexes live
apart till the autumn. When two male Bustards fight, they spar
awhile, and then grasp each other's beaks, and push and pull until one
gives way, and runs. I have never known Bustards do each other any
serious harm.
Although we had no data to go upon, I expected that a month
might be the period of incubation, as with the Cranes ; and on the
twenty-eighth day the female rushed out at my man from the long
grass, but from a place a little away from the nest; and on searching
where she came from, he found a young bird, standing but with closed
eyes and very weak. It was unluckily most extremely cold and wet,
and the conditions could not have been more unfavourable. The little
bird never was seen to feed, and was found dead the same evening.
I lost the mother bird that autumn through a chill, and have never been

so near success since that date. Still I have a hen that lays regularly,
and sometimes incubates ; and I have by no means given up all hope
of bringing off what would be rather an avicultural triumph.
I have seen nothing which supports the statement copied by one
author from another, that the bird sheds its primaries altogether,
like the Waterfowl, and some other birds ; and that it is flightless
until, these feathers grow again.
The story ran that at that time the adults used to be taken by
greyhounds. I believe this is an entire fable. At any rate, with my
birds the moult of the quills is a prolonged business, and goes on
simultaneously with the change of the other plumage during the late
summer and autumn months.
Neither can the bird run exceptionally fast. Its usual pace is a
stately walk, often a strut. No doubt a winged Great Bustard would
flap along, like a wounded wild goose, for a few hundred yards ; but
any dog or an active man would, I should expect, run it down if he
could keep it in sight.
I am sorry that my name should be in any way associated with the
extermination of our old Yorkshire race of Great Bustards, but I fear
I can't gainsay the story told in Mr. Nelson's Birds of Yorkshire,
published by the Yorkshire Naturalists' Union, that a gamekeeper in
the employ of my family in 1806 'actually managed to destroy eleven
Great Bustards at one shot in the East Biding.
When we recollect that at most twenty years converted a splendid
species, fairly plentiful in England where conditions suited it, into a
mere memory, it is to be hoped that we shall never again make such
a deplorable mistake ; and that all true naturalists will discourage
those two mischievous arguments--" Why ! what does it matter ?
There are plenty more ! " or " If I don't take it someone else will;
I'll have it ! |
I will next refer to the Little Bustard, of which I have two males
and three females, which came to me in the plumage of the first year,
when the sexes much resemble each other.
After the first moult in the second autumn, the vermiculations
on the feathers of the male's upper parts, especially of the shoulders,
are finer than in the case of the female ; and henceforth the sexes are

easily distinguished at all seasons. The striking breeding dress is
assumed by the males at the end of their second year, but my hen
birds did not lay till they were a year older.
In the past summer, for the first time, one made a nest, merely
a " scratch " in a bunch of coarse grass, laid three eggs, and sat
steadily. But in the end, though the eggs contained chicks, none were
hatched. No doubt some specially severe storm of that miserable
season drove her off the nest, and the eggs got chilled. The other
females dropped eggs in the enclosure, which were put under hens.
Young were hatched, but we could do nothing with them. They would
not pick up food of any kind, nor take it when offered them. One was
kept alive a week, by being crammed, and then died. In a favourable
summer I think these birds might be bred, but the young, if hatched,
must be left to the parents, 1 who, no doubt, like the Rails and Cranes,
pick up food, and hold it for the young to take. These birds undoubtedly
pair, whatever the Great Bustards do.
Cranes are very interesting birds to keep. Most of them soon
become very tame, and show much intelligence ; and except the
African species, they bear our climate, if they have some shelter in the
worst of weather, very well.
Though I have representatives of seven species, I have only success-
fully reared the Demoiselle. 2 This is curious, for several other species
have bred in this country (five species at Woburn this year), while the
only other Demoiselles reared, except at Scampston, were at Lord
Jersey's place, Osterley, in 1797.
My Demoiselles were early breeders. About the middle of April
they always made their nest on a flat piece of ground within a few yards
of a stream. The nest merely consisted of a small handful of birch
twigs, and the eggs rested on the ground. This used to be the case
with some Common Cranes that I had ; in their case the first egg used
to be laid, and then a few bits of stick and sedge arranged round it.
But some of the Cranes make large structures.
1 In 1915 two Little Bustards were reared at Scampston, as described in
the Avicultural Magazine, 1917, 30.

were not reared.

Once there was a thunderstorm, and the water in the beck rose
and threatened to swamp the nest. The next morning we found the
\0x25A0egg, a single one that year, quite nine feet further inland, and some
fifteen inches higher up the slope.
When there were two eggs, the female began to sit when the first
\0x25A0egg was laid, and, of course, there was an interval between the
appearances of the chicks.
The nestling, after a few hours, can stand, and during the first day
totters about within a yard or two of the nest, the parent which is not
incubating the other egg, tending it closely, brooding it when necessary ;
and when it is hungry going off to forage for insects.
At first the fly or beetle is brought right up to the chick, but the
latter soon gets stronger on its legs, and goes forward to meet its
parent.
When the second chick is strong enough, the parents lead both
away, and they never return to the nest, but the old birds are very
careful and clever in choosing a dry and sheltered place to brood the
young at night, or if rain comes on. If anyone approaches, the parents
get very excited, and try to draw one off, crouching with spread wings,
and feigning lameness.
When the young birds are quite strong, it is a very pretty sight to
.see the birds four abreast, the parents outside with the young between
them, parading up and down through the long grass, each old bird
Teaching out to catch an insect, and offering it to its particular
young one.
Once, in spite of their extreme devotion, it was curious to see how
both old birds passed over one young one which did not thrive, and
favoured the better bird, with the result that the fittest only survived.
It is, so far as I know, very unusual that there should be any
irregularity in the shedding of their flight feathers by birds. The rule
is that they are cast once a year, and at the same season.
Probably if the matter were looked into, it would be found that in
all cases there is a regular order in which the principal feathers are cast.
In Falconry the moult is a very important matter, and is closely
.studied. The Falconer knows that the first feathers to be thrown
by his Peregrine will be the first secondaries, and the last important

feathers the outside tail-feather but one on each side. What the
rule may be in the case of the Cranes I am not yet prepared to say,
but I am satisfied that the larger species, such as the Sarus, Whitenaped
and Wattled Crane, and perhaps others, do not cast their primaries
every season. This has been also noticed in the very fine collection
of Cranes at Lilford.
The Cranes, like the Waterfowl and Rails, are flightless during
the moult.
Most of the Waders accommodate themselves readily to confine-
ment, and the smaller species show themselves much better if they can
be left full-winged. Like the Gulls, in an aviary they are very clever
in avoiding the perches and sides of their prison, and take a great deal
of exercise without damaging themselves at all.
Amongst the small Waders, there are none more deservedly popular
than the Ruff, and it thrives in confinement, if given plenty of clean
water and good turf.
The Reeve has reared her young with me, or rather the young have
reared themselves ; for though for a few days the Reeve caught insects
for them, they soon foraged for themselves, scrambling over and
amongst the long grass, and finding plenty of natural food. One had
to be very quiet, if one wished to see the young, for, till she got used
to one's presence, the Reeve kept piping her alarm note, and the
chicks remained invisible till she stopped.
Rednecked Phalerope. A kind friend who was fishing in Iceland
last summer found himself near a breeding colony of these birds, and
brought back three adults for me, two males and a female. The
birds are extremely tame at their breeding place, and he had no great
difficulty in catching them. But it was only by the exercise of very great
care and skill that he brought them down country on ponyback, and
through the risks of a tedious voyage. However, they reached me in
splendid order, the female, as usual, much the larger, and with a more
conspicuous chestnut patch on the neck.
They soon made themselves quite at home on a small pond with a
stream flowing through it; and though they readily ate ants' eggs,
and finely chopped meat, they caught a great amount of natural food
off the water and from the grass overhanging the margin. This largely

consisted of gnats and other winged insects. Sometimes one would be
seen to swim to the shallow end of the pond and to spin round for
several minutes together, joined perhaps by one or both of the others,
paddling furiously with his lobed feet and pecking at the particles,
some evidently edible, which rose from the bottom in the currents
thus produced. It was evidently a deliberate action, and is probably
regularly practised in the wild state, but I have never seen it recorded.
Flamingoes can be seen to shuffle their feet rapidly, stepping
backwards all the time, and searching with their reversed bills for food
uncovered, probably molluscs and the fine roots of water plants.
Plover, Gulls, and Thrushes adopt other means of setting worms in
motion, so as to expose their whereabouts. 1
Brush Turkeys. I don't think any of my birds created more
surprise and interest than some Brush Turkeys which I once kept.
They were of the common species, Catheturus lathami. I found them
fairly tolerant of our climate, but I used to keep them in a dry shed till
mid-April. As soon as they were let out, the male would begin to
make his mound, raking together all the loose soil, leaves and grass,
for a radius of some twenty yards from the selected spot, which was
always out of the sun, under the protection of an overhanging tree.
The bird turns his back to the place where the heap is to be, and grasps
with his particularly large foot as much of the material as he can
manage, and flings it backwards. Once I happened to be about when
the cock bird was laying his " foundation stone ", so to speak. He
had excavated a short trench about two and a half feet by one foot.
Presently the mound was raised above this trench. I never satisfied
myself as to the object of this trench, nor do I know if there is always
one underneath a mound. Certainly it was not for the reception of
the eggs, for they were never laid less than two feet above the ground
level, though as the mound consolidated they sank with it.
Of course, the male only, worked. If sometimes, especially at
feeding times, when any titbits were going, his treatment of his wife
appeared old-fashioned, to do him justice he never, like the primitive
human races, left the hard work to the weaker sex, for he was always

busy at something, sometimes at useful work connected with the mound,
at other times trying to dig a way under the fence of his enclosure,
so as to get at some rival on the other side.
The incubation of the eggs within the mound depended entirely
upon the proper fermentation of the materials of the composing mass.
Yon Rosenberg found that the temperature in the interior of the mound
of another species, Talegallus fuscirostus, was 93* Fahr., when that of
the external air was 85* in the shade. Workers of incubators will
remember that a temperature of 104* is required to hatch the eggs of
the domestic fowl.

The European Jay ( Garrulus glandarius. --How seldom we
appreciate anything which is common ; if a thing is rare, no matter
whether it is ugly or otherwise, we are always anxious to possess it. If
the European Jay were a denizen of the forests of Venezuela or the
mountains of New Guinea, we should be willing to pay very high
prices for it on account of its delicate beauty and intelligent ways.
But because it happens to be common and can be bought for the
modest sum of five shillings or so we neglect it, and pay as many
pounds for foreign Jays which are perhaps not half so beautiful as
our bird. In the Bible we read that a " prophet is not without
honour save in his own country ", and this applies to our friend
Garrulus glandarius.
It is a great wonder that this bird has been able to maintain itself
as well as it has done, for few birds are the object of such ruthless
persecution. Gamekeepers' larders boast of strings of dried and
mangled corpses of these lovely birds, gardeners shoot and trap it,
and so do poultry keepers, and it also has to pay a very heavy toll
for its beautiful blue wing-coverts which are still in demand for artificial
flies and hat ornaments. Any other bird endowed with less intelligence
than a Jay would have " gone under". This ceaseless persecution
has developed in the Jay a wonderful instinct of self-preservation.

It is the wariest and most difficult of British birds to study in a state
of nature. Always on the alert, it sees danger long before the other
birds, and it seldom exposes itself in the open like the Magpie. The
only time we see it is when it crosses some woodland walk, a flash of
black, white, brown, and blue.
In captivity there is no more charming or intelligent bird than
our native Jay. Of course, confined to a wretched Blackbird or Thrush
cage as we often see it on the wall of some cottage in the country, I
should imagine the Jay is rather a dirty and smelly pet, but when in
an outdoor aviary when he can bathe and exercise his wings, no bird
keeps itself in better condition.
The best way to procure Jays, if one does not live in a district
inhabited by them, is to watch the columns of Cage Birds, when in the
spring time one often sees fledglings advertised at a very nominal
rate. These usually make charming pets.
Two birds which I have now, a true pair, which live in an outdoor
aviary, have proved themselves very amicable with the other birds,
though of course no very small ones are kept with them. The male
is an exceptional mimic, he is always whistling little tunes which he
hears from butchers' boys and the like as they pass on the road. Both
birds are exceedingly tame and will readily come to one's hand for
a mealworm.
Given suitable accommodation I think the birds would readily
go to nest.
It would be a sad loss to British Avifauna if this bird were
exterminated, but I don't think that it ever will be, for it has learned
through bitter experience to adapt itself to conditions and no doubt
will be able to hold out until the people of this country have lost their
taste for slaughtering wild creatures for the fun of it, and give protection
to the feathered inhabitants of this island home of ours.
The Blue-throat (Cyanosylvia suecica). -- Considering what
charming birds the Blue-throats are, it is strange that more is not
heard of them in captivity. Looking through the back volumes of
the Magazine, one finds but a few meagre references concerning them,
though I believe they were more extensively kept in the old days
than they are now, when there was a greater market in this country
for Continental birds than at present.

In general demeanour the Blue-throats seem to resemble the !
Redstarts more than any other family of birds ; once upon a time
they were known as Blue-throated Warblers, why, goodness only I
knows. From what I have seen of them they seem to have no affinity
whatever to the Warbler family, for one thing they are practically ;
terrestrial and in that way resemble the Redstarts.
The best way of keeping these birds is in a small indoor aviary
or large cage, with leaf mould on the floor and also several large
stones or pieces of rock, also a piece of growing turf or a small plant
in a pot. A good-sized bath should be given, for the birds are exceedingly
fond of bathing, in fact some will bathe as many as six times in a day.
A good insectivorous food, a dozen or so mealworms per day, and
as many live insects as one can procure, will keep this bird in perfect
health for years.
A livelier or more confiding bird is hard to find ; its demeanour
somewhat resembles that of a Robin and when in good health it keeps
its plumage in perfect condition.
The Blue-throats, of which there are two species, are on the list of
British birds (though most of the ones on the English market come
from Germany), but are only known as autumn visitors on the east
coast, passing from their summer home in the far north of Europe
to the more hospitable climes of Southern Asia and Northern Africa
for the winter.
These birds are supposed to have a fine song " as if a golden pea
leaped and vibrated in the pipe behind his gaudy bib ", but it has
never been my luck to hear it; my birds have always been of the
strong silent kind ! But I have often noticed that birds which are
particularly garrulous in a state of nature, are strangely silent when
in captivity, and when one sees how some birds are kept, this is not
to be wondered at! I have seldom heard a sound beyond a low
kind of clicking note.
Unless a good supply of live insects are given both before and during
the moult, " the gaudy bib " will come out a light and much paler blue.
The Blue-throats are in size, shape, and colouring very much like
our English Robin, but the upper breast and throat are a brilliant
shining blue, and this is divided from the lower breast by bands of

black, white, and chestnut; one species has a white spot in the middle
of the throat, and the other a chestnut one.
There is another nearly allied bird, the Ruby-throat (Erithacus
pectoralis), a lovely little bird from the Far East and very much like
the Blue-throats, but has the throat and upper breast a shining ruby-red.
This bird is sometimes imported, and would no doubt make a charming
pet; there was one not so long ago at the " Zoo ".
The Icterine Waebler (Hypolais icterina ).---A small, delicate,
and chaste-looking Warbler, with nothing much to recommend it
except its rarity. It is usually tame and confiding but rather dull.
It should be fed upon any quantity of live insects, especially small
smooth caterpillars and spiders, and a rich insectivorous food, and
if kept in a heated bird room it will live for several years.
It is a self-reliant little bird, and while not bullying other birds,
it will brook no interference by any other bird even though six times
its own size ; it has defied me many a time, with legs set firmly apart,
quivering wings, and wide-open beak. The inside of the beak, by the
way, is bright yellow, and when on the defensive the bird opens the
mouth as wide as possible and shows this colouring.
The books state that this bird partakes of fruit, berries, etc., but
I have never known my bird to take them when offered.
The Icterine Warbler is about the size of the Blackcap, and of a
pale olive green above, and very pale clear yellow on the breast and
under parts. It is a very rare visitor to this country, but is fairly
common in Germany in the summer, also in Northern Europe and
some parts of Italy, but it returns to Central Africa in the winter.
Meyer's Parrots (Poeocephalus meyeri ).--After my Imperial
and Bouquet's Parrots, no birds which I possess bring back pleasanter
memories than my little pair of Meyer's Parrots ; whenever I see them
a picture comes back into my mind's eye of a vast undulating plain
with winding snake-like rivers, edged and often hidden by luxuriant
tropical vegetation, so that only here and there are seen open patches
of water reflecting and intensifying the eternally blue skies of Africa,
and in the distance the mysteriously blue Hunyani Mountains which
seem to recede further away as one approaches ; and on a rise from
whence the sky seemed a huge blue bowl with serrated edges made by

the ring of far blue mountains, stood a venerable M'sasa tree, where,,
when its sickly sweet fruits ripened, could be heard all day the chatter
of our little friends as they fed upon the fruits. They wasted a terrible I
lot, for Parrots are surely the most wasteful birds in creation. Some-
times the tree seemed to be raining half-eaten fruits. Let a stranger&apos;
approach and the chatter would cease and not a sound be heard, and,,
search as diligently as one may, not a Parrot would be seen, for no
bird I know of harmonizes so well with its surroundings as this little
Parrot. It seems to become invisible.
The birds usually live in pairs, and though one may see small-
flocks of them in a tree feeding, they never go about in flocks. After
they have fed and dozed for a time, they disperse in their respective
pairs.
No bird I know of is wilder or more difficult to approach than this
Parrot. It is easier to get within reach of an Eagle than a Meyer's-
Parrot, and yet no bird makes a tamer or more charming pet than,
this lovely little bird.
These Parrots are sometimes caught by the natives, who find out
their roosting places and lime the twigs ; they are then sold to the
white people unless the natives eat them in the meantime, but they
seldom live long, for they are usually fed on dry maize. The digestions-
of the poor little creatures cannot stand this kind of stuff after the
fresh sweet fruits which form their natural diet, and they soon " shuffle
off this mortal coil ", killed no doubt by agonizing digestive pains..
I am afraid that our colonial friends pay very little heed to their pets,,
especially when new ones can be supplied by the natives for a few
pence, and aviculture is not the science in the colonies that it is here.
All the smaller African Parrots are charming, the Senegal, the-
Meyer's, Ruepell's, the Brown-headed, etc. ; they are so intelligent
and if taken young soon get very tame.
There are three distinct forms of this Parrot, the common variety,,
the Transvaal form, and the Damara form. I think that my birds may
belong to this latter form. In colour the male is a dull greyish brown
above, with a very broad stripe of canary yellow on the head; the
shoulders, a large patch on the wing-coverts, and the under-wing are
also this colour. The back and lower parts are a pale but bright greenish*

blue, tbe female is quite different. She lacks the bright yellow, the
head and neck only is the greyish brown, and the rest of the plumage
is rich dark green.
St. Thomas's Conure (Eujpsittida ypertinax ).--This is another
of the disappearing West Indian Parrots, and is extremely rare on its
island homes of St. Thomas and St. Croix, but, strange to say, examples
sometimes turn up on the market at a reasonable price. I suppose
this is because the dealers do not realize the great rarity of this bird,
and also because there seems to be little demand for Conures, though
when I once offered two Conures of a different species in Cage Birds
as a gift I received nearly 300 replies !
Speaking of the extermination of the birds of St. Thomas and
St. Croix, we read in that monumental work, A Dictionary of Birds ,
the following concerning this bird : " One of the survivors (aParrakeet),
now regarded by Count T. Salvadori as the true Conurus ypertinax,
is or was a few years ago restricted to a single hill-top in St. Thomas,
and so reduced in numbers that the present writer was ridiculed by
many of the inhabitants for believing that such a bird ever existed in
the island. Found, however, it was but it must be regarded as verging
upon extinction."
It has been stated that this bird lives upon the Dutch island of
Curacao, which is quite likely, for St. Thomas and St. Croix were
formerly Dutch before they were sold to the U.S.A., and this bird
may have been introduced there, for it is very unlikely that it is its
natural habitat, for it is over a thousand miles from the other islands,
and there are many hundreds of islands in the intervening space, but
I only hope that this is true and that the bird is not so rare as it is
thought to be.
Though a small bird, it has all the faults of its larger relations in
being noisy, terribly destructive to woodwork, and very quarrelsome
in regard to other birds, though a pair which I now possess are a most
devoted couple and always back each other up in a fight. If one bird
is attacked the other will go for the aggressor at the back, and thus
release the other bird. Upon one occasion the hen had her head torn
open by a cock Meyer's Parrot, and I only discovered this as the wound
was turning septic. Repeated bathing with hot water and applications

of peroxide of hydrogen, however, saved the bird's life, but the devoted
couple nearly went frantic when separated. They called and talked to
each other all the time when in different cages, and when the little
hen was being ' c doctored " and no doubt in pain, she continued to
call for her mate. After being separated for a few days I put the hen
back, and the reunion was quite touching, but I had to take her
away again, for her mate opened the wound again by his ardent
caresses.
This little Conure is bright green. The male has the forehead,
cheeks, and throat a bright orange yellow, the lower parts being a
pale brown tinged with yellow, while the crown is a bluish slate colour.
The hen is altogether duller and lacks the bright orange yellow. They
are very fond of apple. The calls have not the ear-piercing qualities
that those of most of the Conures have, and though loud they are
quite musical--in a way.
The Moriche Oriole or G-olden-capped Hangnest (Icterus
chrysocephalus ).--Whilst staying for all too short a time in the lovely
island of Barbadoes, I was introduced to a gentleman, a keen
aviculturalist, who by the way is now a member of the Society, who
kindly asked me up to his house to see his interesting collection of
South American and indigenous birds, and I was particularly struck
by a pair of these beautiful brilliant black and gold birds, which I later
on found to be the rare species mentioned above.
These birds of extreme grace and slimness are about as large as an
English Starling, but of a much slimmer build, and of a deep velvety
black with the top and back of the head, the lesser wing-coverts and
shoulders, the lower back and thighs a brilliant golden yellow, a most
striking combination.
With true colonial generosity, Mr. Carter, the gentleman in question,
offered to give me one of the birds, and with some hesitation, for I
knew how difficult it would be for him to get another one, I accepted
his kind offer, and on the day the ship sailed carried off my treasure
in triumph.
Mr. Carter told me that he purchased the bird from some one
who had brought it from Trinidad, and after it had been in the aviary
for a day or two another one was seen outside endeavouring to enter,

a door was opened and the bird entered. It is not indigenous to
Barbadoes, in fact it hails from Trinidad and the Guianas, and the
only explanation I can offer to this singular incident is that a pair
may have been brought over, one escaping, and afterwards,&apos; finding
its mate and love triumphing, it sought imprisonment with its mate
rather than separation.
After leaving Barbadoes I went to Trinidad, and in going one
day round the Indian quarter of Spanish Town, I was delighted to
see another of these lovely birds in a small and filthy cage hanging on
the wall of a very decrepit shop. Well, to cut a long story short, I got
the bird for seven dollars with a Blue-head Pionus thrown in.
I put the two birds together, but the result was disastrous, they
went for each other bill and claw, and would have no doubt fought
to death in a very few minutes.
On board ship they were fed, owing to my not having any soft
food, on bread and milk, oranges, chopped egg, and as many cock-
roaches as we could catch. They sang nearly all the time they were
on the ship.
It is a common and also a very erroneous notion that brilliantly
coloured birds do not sing. The Moriche Oriole is an exceedingly
beautiful bird, though only boasting of two colours, but it is perhaps
the finest songster of the South American Continent. Its song is the
sweetest and the clearest of any bird I have ever met with; it seems
to combine in its song the sweet full notes of the Nightingale, the richness
of the song of a Thrush, and the continuity of the song of a Roller
Canary. In some parts of Venezuela it is known as the " Bugle Bird ",
why, I cannot say, for the song has no resemblance to the sound of
a bugle.
William Beebe tells in his delightful book, Tropical Wild Life in
British Guiana, quite a lot about this charming bird, and perhaps
I may be forgiven if I quote rather at length from a beautifully written
chapter in regard to this bird.
" One of the first birds to greet us at Kalacoon was the Moriche
Oriole. These birds were unusual in their charm, for they were
satisfying both to the eye and the ear. From dawn until the passing
of the swift tropical twilight their black forms, crowned and shouldered

and booted with gold, looped palm with palm or glanced in the sunlight
as they sped away to the denser second growth in search of insect
food. And hardly ever did they perch without giving utterance to
the silvery thread of warbling notes which, while individual and
distinctive, yet with no less certainty declared their Oriole relationship.
" Late in February, upon our arrival at Kalacoon, we discovered
no less than five nests of this Oriole in the single royal palm in the
compound in the front of the house. We soon found that only one
pair of the Orioles occupied the tree, and each day it became more
and more probable that this pair was the architect of all five nests.
" Two of the nests were complete and apparently several months
old. Three were unfinished, and upon two of these we saw the birds
working intermittently. One of these nests contained two eggs, one
of which we took, as it had apparently never been described.
" The nests were placed on the under side between the leaflets of
one side of the frond about tw T o feet from the tip. They were made
entirely of shreds of the leaves themselves, which the birds had torn
from a particular frond, a frond which through their industry had
become almost denuded. The green fibre was woven with the bill,
and the process was not a simple one. The nest was a fairly deep
cup, held in place by the rim and sides being woven into separate
leaflets. The leaves were split with the bill, and the shreds of fibre
woven in and out until the leaf was safely bound to the side of the
nest. In the case of two of the nests, the sewing was very finely done,
not unlike the work of the tailor bird of India."

I have ventured once before to advocate the charms of Tree Ducks
in the garden, but expressed the doubts usually recognized as to their
hardiness. At the first approach of cold weather I had noticed that
these Ducks looked miserable and tucked up, and was in the habit of

driving into a shed such as could be rounded up. They were then
kept indoors till frost had disappeared. The result was not altogether
satisfactory, as I found that their feet got dry and cracky, and that
after enforced abstinence from water they lost some of the natural
oil in their plumage and would soak themselves by bathing directly
they were released. For this reason and others they were left out to
take their chance during the recent spell of severe weather, and have all
come through it in perfect health. We had fairly deep snow for a week,
and up to 16* of frost, with a bitter east wind, but the Tree Ducks
seemed to mind it less each day and their feet kept in perfect order.
The water here is a slow-running muddy stream which freezes
over in parts, but remains open by the waterfalls. The species kept
include the White-faced, Red-billed, Fulvous, and Black-billed
(Dendrocygna arhorea).
If any members should be tempted to go in for Tree Ducks on the
strength of this note, may I advise them not to pinion their birds, but
to clip one wing. Their great charm lies in their tameness, and that
after regaining their power of flight they will not stray away. They
will fly from place to place in the garden in search of their feeder, and
will wheel round high overhead on a summer evening before retiring to
roost whistling very prettily all the time.
[Unfortunately neighbours who possess guns cannot always be
trusted to respect Tree Ducks when they " wheel round high overhead
on a summer evening ".-- Ed.]

<bodyText confidence="0.9839315" page_id="56181830"  page_num="147" year="" vol="">
By R. R. Minchin
Thinking it may be of some interest I am sending a photograph
of a male Australian Bustard which has lived in the Adelaide Zoological
Gardens for the last eight years.
In his excellent work on Australian birds Mr. A. J. Campbell
says : " During that period (the breeding season) the male Bustard

lias a curious habit of 4 showing off ', as the children would say, by
ascending a slight knoll or eminence on the plain, where he makes
frills of his feathers and cuts all sorts of capers, majestic or otherwise."
If that author had ever seen that interesting bird in full display, no
one could have described its actions better than he, but from his
description I feel sure that he never did witness them to the full.
The bird in these Gardens selects a sunny spot in the open and,
erecting his tail, he raises it until it touches the back of the neck.
Then, throwing the head up he opens his beak (as shown in the photo-
graph) and takes in a quantity of air which is seemingly held in the
throat. Closing the beak with a hollow sounding " plomp " he then
forces the air down into the air sac which hangs from the chest, and
from deep down in the throat there is emitted a sound which may
be compared with the roar of a primus stove ! Although not very
loud this sound has a remarkable carrying capacity. During the
above actions the Bustard constantly marks time, and in doing so
swings the air sac to and fro until the earth becomes bare and polished
and the feathers completely worn away where the lower end of the
sac brushes the ground.
These actions lead one to surmise that Eupodotis australis is
polygamous and that the cocks remain at their displaying ground and
call the hens to them. The cock here keeps up this display practically
without interruption throughout the day, and as long as the weather
is fine he will keep going for several weeks. During this period the
bird will attack one, and in doing so can use his beak to a very useful
purpose. In the off season and at will during the breeding season,
the sac is drawn up until it is hardly noticeable and not much larger
than a man's closed hand.
In captivity these birds will eat almost anything, and their diet
here consists of raw meat, grain, and any kind of fruit. They are
particularly fond of chopped-up apples.
The female of the pair we have only had for two years, and so-
far they have made no attempts at nesting.
Most unfortunately the flesh of the Bustard is excellent eating,,
and this is one of the many factors that are going to cause its early
extinction.

By S. Harvey (Adelaide)
Being interested in the notes on the Turquoise Parrot written
by Messrs. E. J. Boosey and A. Brooksbank in the December number
of the Avicultural Magazine, I am writing a few notes on my
observations. It appears to me that the time of the year the birds
are hatched has something to do with the colouring, or possibly the
season has some effect. I have not made a study of the colouring of
the young Turquoise Parrots, but intend to in the future. They
certainly vary a great deal.
In 1926 one pair of Turquoise reared two nests of young with four
in each. In the first clutch there were two hens and two cocks; one
of these cocks was showing the red wing patches when it left the nest,
the other showed them about a week later. In 1929 eight Turquoise
Parrots were reared, there were two cocks and six hens. These cocks
did not show the red on the wings for some weeks, one of them was
quite six weeks before I noticed the red. These eight young ones
were reared by two pairs and both were double brooded, each pair
rearing a clutch three and one.
This season (1930) six Turquoise Parrots were reared by two pairs,
both had three each. Strangely enough, these have turned out to
be five cocks and one hen. Three of them were reared by one of the
pairs that reared young in 1929, but the other three were reared by
a pair that had not reared young before. So you cannot make it a rule
that Turquoise Parrots breed a preponderance of hens. In 1927 and
1928 I had more cocks than hens.
The Elegant is not always single brooded. In 1929 a pair I had
on their own reared two nests of young in the one season. The hen
commenced sitting again before the last young one had left the nest.
Last season I had six pairs in a large aviary together, they all nested,
but once only.
A week before Christmas three young Bourke Parrots left the nest.
I had four pairs in separate breeding aviaries. Logs were hanging

inside the house, also one box 16 inches long by 7 inches square, with a
2 inch diameter hole in one end. This was covered with bark and was
hung on the angle and a turned block, similar to a money till, was
fixed in the bottom corner; bark was also put inside the box leading to
this block. A similar box to this was hung in the flight against the
front of the house, and it was in this that the Bourkes nested.
Dr. Clendinnen of Melbourne first made these boxes and reared
some Bourkes before mine thought of nesting, and if I had not taken
his tip to make these boxes I do not think I would have reared any
Bourkes this season.

Sir, --The following note is, I fear, hardly avicultural, but perhaps
it may be allowed to pass.
I keep a few Wallabies with my Bheas and Cranes, and twice
recently, during the very severe weather which we are at present
having, I have noticed Starlings sitting on the wallabies' backs,
presumably hunting for insects, the animals paying no attention to
them at all.
Of course, it is a common enough thing to see Starlings sitting
on the backs of sheep, and in East Africa I have seen quantities (twenty
at a time) of Wattled Starlings clinging to the backs and sides of
rhinoceros and native cattle, diligently searching for the ticks which
infest these animals, also, but in a lesser degree, on the backs of
zebras and some of the antelopes ; but I should be interested to know
whether other members, who keep wallabies in a state of semi-freedom
in large enclosures, have witnessed the same thing ? I must say,
although wallabies have been kept here for years, I have never noticed
it before, but the deep snow and eighteen degrees of frost may account
for the birds unusual temerity.

Sir, --Eeferring to my letter in your issue for last November:
I have at last received reports upon the two Parrots given your
" Fat " treatment. Two other victims have since been added tO&apos;
these patients.
All are completely cured, and in good condition.
I quote the last report received by me, so that you can satisfy
yourself as to the genuineness of these cures.
" Dear Sir, --In reply to your post-card re my Parrot.
The seed and diet you prescribed worked wonders, her feathers-
improved, she lost all the greyness and patches on her breast.
Should have written you before, but mislaid your address.
I must thank you sincerely for your very great kindness in helping
us out of our difficulty. Polly is such a wonderful bird, talks and
sings all day long.
Georgina Fitzpatrick. "
Has any member tried cod-liver oil as I suggested ?
It seems a fact that we have now definitely established a cure for
this destructive plague.
As prevention is better than cure, and the undoubted cause seems
to be an unsuitable diet, may I ask you, as an authority upon Parrots,
in order to prevent future suffering by these dumb pets, to prescribe
a suitable mixture for both Amazons and Greys, in the hope that
by propaganda we may stamp out this scourge ?

Sir, --In a small aviary at Keswick Hall are several pairs of Love-
birds, including Masked, Fischer's, and Blackcheeks. During January
a pair of Blackcheeks went to nest and three eggs were laid, the hen
sitting well for about a week, when she was turned out of the nest
by a pair of Masked. Thinking that the eggs would now be spoilt,
I took no further notice, but my surprise was great when several.

A General Index
days later I heard faint chirpings coming from the nest-log, and on
closer inspection found two small chicks were hatched. After being
turned out of their nest the Blackcheeks were not allowed to go near
the log. The Masked proved themselves to be good parents, and the
young have now left the nest, and are strong healthy birds, and no
mistaking them for anything but true Blackcheeks. The Blackcheeks
have again gone to nest, four eggs being laid. The Masked this time
are not interfering with them, their time seems to be taken up with
their adopted youngsters.
A. Martin.
A GENERAL INDEX
As foreshadowed in our January number, our member Dr. Hopkin-
son has lost no time in carrying his most generous offer to compile an
index to the back volumes of the Avicultural Magazine into effect
and we hope very soon to publish this invaluable work. It was, of
course, impossible to produce a complete index with references to
every name of a bird such as is published with the yearly volumes,
but the compiler has gone carefully through the whole of the back
volumes and indexed everything of importance, and there is no doubt
that the volume when published will be of the utmost service to our
members.
It is not possible at present to say what the cost of publication
will be or the price at which it can be sold to members, but we sincerely
hope that every member will purchase a copy, and so help to defray
the cost of publication. A definite announcement as to the date of
publication and the price of the index will be made as soon as
possible.

The subject of the accompanying coloured plate --\0x25A0Poicephalus
rufiventris --inhabits North-Eastern Africa, and is one of the most
beautiful of a very charming group of small Parrots, of which the best
known are the Senegal and Meyers. The Red-breast is but seldom
imported, and has the reputation of being difficult to keep in captivity.
Indeed, a small collection of three which reached this country a few
years ago appear to have all died very soon after their arrival. They
were extremely shy, and evidently captured as adult birds. The
particular bird figured in this number has an interesting history. It
was taken from the nest in Somaliland in 1901, during the military
expedition sent out to punish the Mad Mullah, and hand-reared by
Colonel H. P. Keelan, D.S.O., who presented it to the Zoological
Society in 1927. It remains one of the prizes of the collection.

I have seen Green Avadavats advertised at 25s. a pair, but some
time ago I would not have given 25 farthings for them ; now I have
had a pair breed and rear two young in one of those oblong bamboo
cages so familiar to anyone who knows the bird markets of India

I would give 25 pence for a pair but not more. They are not to be
compared for general attractiveness with the Common Red Avadavat;
they do not sing ; they have a certain beauty and when they are in
good condition the breast feathers shine like silk, but they are timid,
frightened little creatures, even when tame.
It was July last year that Hussain, my bird dealer friend in Bombay,
sent me, in response to my modest request for a few pairs of Green
Avadavats, no less than three dozen. But alas ! they were not destined
to live long. They had been overcrowded and though I put them out
at once in a large flight cage, many sat with their heads under their
feathers and would take no notice. Some of the cocks at once started
to display ; they pointed the beak straight down at the ground, puffed
out the striped feathers at the side and hopped stiffly up and down
round the chosen hens. I removed three healthy looking pairs and
caged them separately, but only one pair survived ; all the others
disclosed a disease which wasted them away and of which the most
pronounced symptom was a constant movement in the throat as if
the bird was trying hard to swallow. It was a lesson to me that when
I receive small birds in any number to separate them and to cage them
in separate pairs at once.
The only pair which survived soon became tame. I put them in
a bamboo cage and tied to one end the little wicker cage I use for
breeding, but the cock did not display and though soon after I found
two eggs in the nest, the hen did not sit. I removed them to one of
my large French breeding cages, but though they always slept in the
nesting cage and disappeared. therein at the least provocation, there
was no attempt at breeding until the following rains in July. Even
then I did not see the cock display, but he chased the little hen about
the cage, pulling her feathers out till she looked as if she was well
in the moult. I gave them fine grasses to line the nest which I had
roughly shaped of coarse grasses ; the cock would take none but the
finest grasses to the nest, but though the hen laid four eggs, plain
white, as is usual with these " little foreigners ", and the little hen sat
with exemplary patience, the eggs were infertile.
I had not seen the cock display and I did not think he was in
breeding condition and I found it difficult to find food to attract him..

Godfrey Davis--Notes on Breeding Green Avadavats 155
Very tiny gentles, which my St. Helena Waxbills ate greedily, the
Avadavats would not touch ; seeding grass, too, did not seem to attract
them ; soaked Indian millet was their only luxury until I tried them
with white ants, the favourites of the Grey Francolin, and these they
ate greedily. This confirmed my belief that these little Waxbills
must be far more terrestial in their habits than other Waxbills. They
did not seem to appreciate the long flight of their large cages ; they
used to sit contentedly side by side upon the ground like two tiny
Quails, and the stripes on the sides seemed designed, like the stripes
on the tiger, to break the outline when they squatted on the ground ;
they seemed to be longer in body than other Waxbills, and when the
cock did come into condition on a diet of white ants he did not display
upon the perch at all. He hopped stiffly up and down upon the ground
as I had seen the other cocks do when I had first released them in the
large flight cage. Moreover, they seemed far happier in the comparative
shade and seclusion of a bamboo cage than in the large wire flight.
From this I drew the inference that Green Avadavats when wild haunt
secluded jungle and live largely upon the ground. To-day, 2nd March,
two young Green Avadavats have left the nest; the nest was the little
wicker nesting cage, with a khaki cloth cover, hung on the door at one
end of the bamboo cage, measuring 26 \ inches long, 14 J inches wide,
and 14 J inches high ; the nesting cage measured 8 inches long, 5 inches
wide and 5J inches high. The cock lined the grass nest I had roughly
made of coarse grass with the finest feathery grasses he could find.
He tested each grass by lifting it by the end in his beak, until satisfied
he was equal to the load, for these Avadavats are very tiny things.
Satisfied he was equal to the burden he carried the grass by the end
of the stem to the nest, where the little hen was waiting to receive
it; feathers they did not use to line the nest. The hen laid four white
oval eggs, but the weather was chilly and only two hatched, and the
young were reared on white ants and yolk of egg chopped fine and
Indian millet, sprouted and dry. The eggs took thirteen days to hatch
and the young left the nest after twenty days. As the grass withered
in the nest, so the cock would add other grasses, which I gave him, to
keep the hen quiet and secluded. The cage was placed on a packing
case in a small room measuring 10 feet by 10 feet, with one small

window opposite to which the cage was put. This little room, in which
I have bred all my birds, faces north, but the cages are put out in the
early morning and the late evening sunlight in the garden and the
room is sufficiently lit by this small window in the fierce midday light
of India. The young are not like the hen, as some books say. They
are not striped at the sides ; the head and the upper plumage is a dark
olRe, in some lights almost dusky, and the breast is a pale greenish-
yellow, but a colour difficult to describe ; the beak is lead colour ;
but the young resemble the hen in this, that while the cock is almost
a grass green the upper plumage of the hen is an olive-green, and in
this way the sexes can easily be distinguished by one who has seen
both. The tail of the young is black, like the parents. It would appear
Green Avadavats are not difficult to breed provided white ants or
ants' eggs are procurable, but I do not think they are worth breeding.
The little Zebra Waxbill and the Red Avadavat&apos; are both infinitely
more attractive.

By C, H. Macklin, M.R.C.S., L.R.C.P.
If our Editor is short of articles of more importance he may like to
print the following very ordinary account of my present Aviaries,
or the arrangement of their inmates at the beginning of this season.
Until I draw a horse in the Calcutta or Dublin Sweepstakes my
aviaries will never contain, I fear, any but ordinary and inexpensive
birds, but as there must be many other members of the Society in
a like case some of my notes may be of interest to them.
I find that throughout the year few days pass when some little
item of interest may not be jotted down in my Aviary Diary.
Some ten years ago when I was able to start bird-keeping again
after the war interval I had one small aviary. In 1926 I moved to a
house with a beautiful old walled-in garden and each year since then
has seen another corner of the garden occupied by birds until my
enclosures of various shapes and sizes now number seven, with an
eighth in view if room can be found for it.

. No. 1 is the stable loft fitted up with two flights and cages for
winter use ; it is now practically empty. I use a single burner " Valor
Perfection oil stove for warmth when necessary.
No. 2 a small lean-to affair in a corner between the garage wall
and garden boundary wall facing S.E. Shelter and flight about 10 feet
long, 5 feet wide, and 6 to 7 feet high. Here are my pair of Cockatiels
which took second prize at the Crystal Palace in February. Last season
they thoroughly disgraced themselves; started by throwing out,
one after the other, the first clutch of eggs as they were laid and then
refusing to sit out their time on several other clutches ; in all the hen
produced thirty-six eggs and hatched none.
This year they have started better and are now sitting steadily.
They are very tame, but the cock is excitable and inquisitive, and
must rush out of the nest to investigate any unusual noise during his
spell of duty.
With the Cockatiels are three pairs of White Budgerigars now
settled down to their first nest. Budgerigars are kept chiefly to help
pay the food bill anti with luck to supply the wherewithal to buy new&apos;
birds ; they have certainly more than paid for themselves for the
last two seasons.
No. 3. My largest aviary, 23 by 8 by 10 feet high : the shelter is
an old brick-built shed, and the back of the flight is a brick and timbered
barn wall. Shrubs and a honeysuckle grow in this aviary and there is
a patch of grass large enough to be cut by the mowing machine as
well as some rough tussocky grass at the sides. Last year some of
my Weavers rather damaged the growing shrubs but this time I have
excluded all birds likely to destroy foliage.
Here are a pair of Shamahs, both delightfully tame, especially
the hen. I am very hopeful that they will nest this year. In 1930
the cock never came into real breeding condition, and they only got
as far as inspecting nesting sites. I am now trying a new cock ; at
present they are not very friendly but have only been introduced for
a week, and at any rate, have not come to blows.
A pair of Pileated Finches are in their second season ; they made
no attempt at nesting last year but are charmingly confiding birds,
especially the hen, who will follow me round for a mealworm. The

C. H. Macklin--My Aviaries
cock's beautiful and distinctive crest is only raised when he is excited
or interested, then up it comes, not only raised but spread out side-
ways like a fan.
Pekin Robins ; a pair, but not too friendly with each other, the cock
is tame and gracefully catches his daily mealworm ration in mid-air ;
he is a very fair songster.
Diamond Doves ; a pair in their fourth season here ; they are kept
apart during the winter, the hen indoors ; within a week of putting
them together they have made a nest on top of a Hartz travelling cage
hung inside the shelter and are busy incubating. This pair are fairly
good parents for Doves, and have reared quite a large number of
youngsters for me. They are very silly about choosing nesting sites
and sometimes persist in building a flimsy affair which has no chance
of standing the strain of incubation. A coconut husk cut in half
horizontally and hung near the aviary roof under shelter is, I find,
the most satisfactory nesting-place, and they will often take to it.
The cock's display to his mate is one of the prettiest sights in the
aviary, as he bows low before her and spreads his long black-and-white
tail in a fan over his back.
A pair of Bronzewing Mannikins, the smallest birds in the aviary,
but quite the most self-important; they have seized one of the Doves'
half-coconut husks and have built a gigantic nest of straw and grass,
it was most amusing to watch them flying up with building material
of astonishing length and size.
The hen of a pair of Redheaded Finches is not very strong on the
wing, she may improve outside, they are otherwise a beautiful pair
and should nest.
Two Red-vented Bulbuls may possibly be a pair, one sings quite
nicely; we shall see when they settle down. I am not sure whether
the Shamahs and Bulbuls will agree, but they have room to keep out
of one another's way,
A Cock Red-eared Bulbul has improved greatly in looks since he
came outside, and is a very fair songster. A young cock Scarlet
Tanager just coming into colour is very lively, and will be very hand-
some later on ; he was bought as the hen of a pair, the cock in full
colour died.

A single Malabar Mynah, a quiet and inoffensive little Starling,
whose sober colour scheme is distinctly attractive, and lastly my one
surviving Gouldian Finch, a fine red-headed cock bred here in 1928 ;
his mate died during the winter ; last year she threw out two lots of
half-grown youngsters.
No. 4 is a two-compartment aviary, 14 by 10 by 6J feet high, the
shelter built against the end of my stable wall with the flights in front.
The first compartment contains eight pairs of Budgerigars, all the cocks
are sky-blue and the hens mixed colours. With them is a solitary
cock Blue-winged Lovebird ; I have been trying to get a mate for him
for two years, but I'm afraid he will have to remain a bachelor and watch
his neighbours rear their numerous progeny; he seems perfectly
friendly with the Budgerigars. In the inner and smaller compartment
are a pair of Black-tailed Hawfinches from China ; they are rather
difficult birds to accommodate with nesting sites ; growing shrubs
are defoliated at once, and they won't look at boxes, I have given them
fir branches nailed to the side of the aviary. I find they will eat little
besides sunflower, hemp, apple, and greenstuff ; they are a nice tame
pair and did well at the Crystal Palace and Nottingham Shows.
No. 5. My first aviary, which I built entirely myself and which
was moved in sections from my old house. It was originally meant
for Waxbills, etc., and is wired with  |inch mesh wire, shelter 7 by 4 feet,
flight 12 by 4, height 6 feet, with sanded path, turf and growing shrubs
in the flight. Here are my flock of Zebra Finches, five pairs busy nesting,
a pair of Chinese Painted Quail, very nervous little birds, I had to
clip their wings severely to prevent them killing themselves by flying
violently up against the wire roof. A few Cock Waxbills, most of which
have been here five or six years, an Avadavat and two Silverbills
complete this aviary.
No. 6. In two compartments built in a corner of the garden where
there was once a greenhouse so that the back and one end are against
high brick walls. Size 10 by 14 by 6 feet 6 inches high, the shelters
are brick built. The first compartment contains five pairs of
Budgerigars, Cobalt and Olive cocks, Blue and Mauve hens ; eight
cock Weavers, and one Whydah are here also, as they are too destructive
to be allowed elsewhere with growing shrubs. The Budgerigars seem

to take no notice of them ; there are Crimson Crowned, Rufus-necked,
Masked, Yellow, Orange and Napoleon Weavers, and a Pintail Whydah.
The inner compartment houses one pair of Nyasa and two pairs
of Black-cheek Lovebirds and a pair of Californian Quail. I find it
a great mistake to overcrowd Lovebirds ; two or three pairs to
a compartment is ample, no matter how large the flight may be. There
are sure to be fights and maimings if a larger number of breeding pairs
are kept together ; Nyasas and Black-cheeks are far less pugnacious
than Masked and Fischer's ; the latter I found particularly treacherous.
No. 7. A " rustic " structure of fir poles and \ inch wire, in a
corner, enclosing a large bay bush, about 10 by 15 by 9 feet high,
contains a pair of Californian Quail, terribly wild beggars in spite of
clipping their wings, a particularly well coloured and tame pair of
Pekin Robins, cock Brambling and hen Chaffinch, and a cock Shamah.
Part of the roof and one end are boarded in for shelter, the back and
half one end are against ivy-clad brick walls.
Here I hope to turn out a pair of Blue Rock Thrushes when I can
get them. When they do come the Shamah will have to go back to
his cage.
Here then is my bird family, numbering about 100 and giving me
endless interest. Rather less than an hour before breakfast sees them
fed and watered ; the cleaning out is done weekly by my gardener,
who can also take on the feeding when I am too busy. I find it an
ideal hobby for a country doctor with limited spare time.

TWO ASIATIC ROCK-THRUSHES

By Alex. Hampe
The interesting article of Mr. Sidney Porter in the February
number of our Magazine prompts me to write a few lines about two
Asiatic Rock-thrushes, which are probably only known to a few of
our members. During one of my visits to the native city of Shanghai
I found in a small birdshop a very young bird which I recognized at
once as a Rock-thrush, but of a species which I had never seen before.
I tried to buy the bird, but the dealer named a ridiculous price and

I left the shop. I had nearly forgotten the bird, when months later
I paid a visit to a Japanese birdshop in Shanghai and again met my
friend in a very small cage.
He looked much better and h&amp;d changed his grey plumage into
a beautiful powder blue robe adorned with a deep chestnut-red breast
and belly. " This time the bird must become mine," was my first
thought, and after a little bargaining I carried him home.
With the help of that valuable book Les Oiseaux de la Chine , by
Pere David, I soon found out that my new acquisition was Monticola
solitaria philippensis. I suppose the correct name would be Eastern
Blue Rock-thrush. During the next few weeks my bird greatly
improved and soon became one of the tamest birds I ever possessed.
Whenever I or my Chinese servant approached his cage he would
carry on a friendly conversation with us just as if he wanted to tell
us how good life was now, and when let out of his cage he would take
short flights and often settle on my hand or on my shoulder. He
never tried to peck me or my boy, but woe betide any stranger who
would enter when he was out of his cage. He would fly at them
furiously and I had to shut him up, for his pointed beak could inflict
nasty pecks. His song, which he performed with great zest, was not
very loud, but very sweet and agreeable. In spring he used to display
like a miniature peacock as soon as I approached his cage. After he
had been for one year in my possession I sent him with a small consign-
ment of rare birds to England, where he was safely landed. I never
found another one in Shanghai, but when last year in South Japan,
I had occasion to watch this Rock-thrush in liberty. I saw the bird
on the rocky coast of the inland sea, always on the rocks, never on
a tree. The Japanese name for this Thrush is " Iso-hio ", which
means " small seashore bird ". I am told that it is rather a common
bird in Fukien.
The second species of Rock-thrush of which I want to speak is
the " White-throated Rock-thrush " ( Monticola gidaris). In Pere
David's book is a coloured plate of this bird which often made
me wish to possess such a Thrush as a cagebird, the more so as Pere
David describes its song as " sonore and melodieux ". I had to wait
a long time before my wish was fulfilled. Two years ago I found at

last an example in a small shop tied to a perch with a string round the
neck, the way birds are often kept in the North of China.
The bird was perfectly tame and I bought it. I put it in a proper
cage, where to my astonishment it became at first very wild but soon
settled down again. After I had it a week it started to sing and,
indeed, Pere David is right, the song is sonore and melodieux, and in
my opinion is one of the best bird songs one may listen to. This good
quality in connection with the very handsome plumage makes it a
very desirable cagebird ; a pity that it is very rare. Only about half
a dozen reach our bird market in spring, and last year I could not
find any. It is a rare migrant in the Yangtze valley, and according
to Pere David nests in Manchuria. For the members who have not
seen the bird, I give a short description, according to Pere David.

As I have probably had more opportunity than most people of
studying the Elegant Grass Parrakeet (Neophema elegans) in its
natural state, a few notes as to its habits may be of interest.
Some five years ago, while away on a motor cabin cruiser with a
medical friend of mine, we went ashore near a creek running into the
Murray Kiver, some miles from its mouth, in order to shoot a rabbit
for our supper.
When we landed some small olive-green Parrots flew out of the
grass, and disappeared rapidly from view.
Some others were discovered flitting from one tobacco-tree to
another, and I decided that they looked like the Elegant, which at
that time was reported to be very scarce and in danger of extinction.
Some months later I went down, in company with a trapper, to

William Hamilton--A Few Facts about the Elegant Parrakeet 163
investigate these birds. We found that a few were still on this head-
land, and determined to come the following week-end with nets to try
to trap some.
We came down to this spot every week-end for six weeks, set our
nets overnight, and arose at daybreak to try and catch Elegants.
I might state at this juncture that the Elegant is not like most Parrots--
he is difficult to catch, and it was only after studying him for years
that we met with any measure of success.
The trapper who came with me is probably the best bird-catcher
in Australia, so it was not through lack of skill that we failed.
In six week-ends we caught ten birds, and six of these on one day.
Each time we added to our store of knowledge, and when we thought
we knew all about the Elegant he would show us a new trick next
time.
As you know, he is a small golden-green Parrakeet, with a two-colour
blue frontal bar, and the same two blue colours on the edge of the
wing. The blues are turquoise and Prussian. The chest is golden-
green, merging into yellow on the abdomen, with a patch of orange
between the legs. This patch develops with age, and is missing in the
young birds. It can attain the size of a shilling, but only in a fairly
old bird.
The tail is bluish-green in centre tail-feathers, with yellow feathers
on the outer sides.
The beak is dark horn-coloured, but in the young birds is light
yellow when they leave the nest.
The Elegant has three cries : A sound like " Zit-Zit ", when flying
normally through the air ; a harsh noise of alarm as a warning to
others ; and a pleasant, twittering chatter when at rest on a tree or
in company with other Elegants.
This bird is always found near coastal sandhills, and in the sandhill
country in the interior of Australia.
The wild tobacco-tree grows in profusion in these districts, and
where it grows you are likely to find Elegants.
The colour of the Elegant is remarkably protective, and he is
difficult to detect, even to the trained eye, when sitting among the
tobacco leaves.

These tobacco-trees have a broad green leaf, and are covered with
yellow flowers and the green and yellow of the Elegant blend perfectly
with them. I have seen Elegants in plenty all along the coast of
South Australia--even along the West coast, and some 300 or 400 miles
up north, inland. Where we came across them by accident there were
at least 3,000, and I can safely say that they will never become extinct
through the agency of man. The country where I have found them is
sandy, and very poor quality soil. It will grow little and will not
carry many sheep or cattle, and so does not attract settlers.
The birds seem to have chosen a natural sanctuary, and are increasing
yearly. In the winter the majority migrate to the interior to breed,
though I have found nests on an island near our catching-ground.
The Elegant is a shy bird, and not very companionable. He is not
curious either and that makes him hard to trap, facts we observed
in a period of five years.
They fly singly and in pairs--big flocks are exceptional, though late
at night when returning to their sleeping place one may count twenty
or thirty in a flight, but this is not common. Several eights and sixes
are not unusual. We would arise before the sun, as the first Elegants
always came over from the island where they slept as soon as the sun
arose. They fly at about 300 feet and a few would alight on our
headland, but the majority flew overhead and separated, going in
different directions to their feeding-grounds along the Murray River.
One may flush them from any of the small islands near the mouth
of the river, feeding on grass seeds and thistles. They even eat the
boxthorn berries when other food is scarce. Those that landed on the
headland where we were would stay until about 8.30 a.m. (sunrise
at 5.30), and after that they would disappear, and be seen no more until
about 4.30 in the afternoon, when the " Zit-Zit " would be heard, and
the solitary bird would be seen flying high and returning to the island.
Occasionally a few would alight on the headland before flying over
the creek to the island. We never had much luck trying to catch in
the afternoon. When they alight they always land on a dead tree,
with not a leaf on it, and face into the wind. Their natural enemy the
Hawk is very plentiful here and up north, and the Elegant finds that
he has a better view if he sits on a dead tree and can see all round.

When he is sure the coast is clear he flutters to a live tobacco-tree,
none of which are more than 12 feet high. Here he rests awhile, and
then flutters to the ground, keeping close to the tree. One or two
others may now join him, but they never get very close to one
another.
If there is grass they eat the seeds--if not, then one can see them
scooping up a beakful of sand and sifting it with their tongues until
they get the grass seeds or tobacco seeds, each tobacco flower when
dry having hundreds of very tiny seeds which drop on to the ground.
They run about in little short runs, and look very attractive against
the brownish sand. They breed about August, and I have seen young
ones fairly early in September. The young are dull-coloured all over,
with dull blue edges to the wing, and a faint frontal band. Lighter
coloured abdomen but not yellow and no orange patch.
The families keep together and the father generally arrives on the
tree first, to be followed a few moments later by his family. They call
to one another when flying, and when they have arrived in the tree
commence this pleasant chattering noise.
Most Parrots are curious--but not the Elegant. When trapping
most other Parrots, one uses a call-bird on a brace in the net. When
he hears his species flying overhead he calls to them, and they come
down to a neighbouring tree, have a look round, see him in the net,
and being curious, promptly join him : the net cord is pulled, and over
shoots the net. Then you rush out and take Master Parrot out of the
net and put him in a cage. Not so Mr. Elegant. He does not call
to his kind--possibly some unwritten law relative to capture. He is
sitting in the net, and some others alight in a nearby tree. He ignores
them, and they look at him but evince no curiosity.
They may sit on that tree for twenty minutes, and all the time you
are sitting in your hide of branches with the pull rope in your hand,
waiting for one to fly down--not daring to breathe or move, as the
slightest movement would be seen through the leaves of your hide.
You may be sitting on your leg or in some uncomfortable position,
and there you have to stay in case the Elegant flies down to the net.
Nine times out of ten he just sits on the tree and ultimately flies off
without taking any interest in your call-bird.

Two single birds will sit on trees 20 feet apart, but will remain
single birds--they don't seem to care for company.
It is interesting to watch them flying home at night--flying high
until over the Ti-Tree of their island, then falling or diving as if shot,
from 300 feet, down into their thick branches. The growth of trees and
rushes is so thick at this island that one cannot penetrate it from the
river: one has to land on the island somewhere else, and then one
cannot penetrate the growth to the river, so the Elegant is safe from
molestation.
They lay from four to six eggs in a clutch--generally in the native
state we saw four young to each pair of parent birds. They are quite
attentive parents, and ready breeders in captivity.
They can die, as most Parrots seem to be able to do, from no
apparent cause and when in good condition. They are subject to eye
disease like most Neophema, but stand the cold fairly well--mine
always winter out. They will breed in community, but do better in
single pairs to an aviary.
They are not destructive to bushes, so their aviaries can be made
more attractive than those of most Parrots.
We do not often see them in the bird-dealers' shops because they
are so difficult to trap. They attain full colour in Australia with the
first moult, that period varying according to the kind of summer
we may have. I have caught them moulting badly as early as March,
and have let them go again.
When fully coloured I consider them among the most attractive of
Parrots. I may be prejudiced, but I suppose it is natural, as I have spent
so many pleasant week-ends in five years studying them and trying *
to trap a few.

(Continued from page 138) 1
It sometimes seemed that the hen Brush Turkey miscalculated the
period when the heap would be ready for the eggs, and that the fermen-
tation was past before the eggs had time to hatch. Probably, if there had
been several hens, some eggs would have been forthcoming when the
fermentation process was at the right point. But I only had one hen,
and at the end of the summer I more than once on opening the mound
found eggs unhatched with chicks in various stages of development.
Though they had a good big run, the birds were partly dependent for
materials on what we gave them, which, of course, had to be in such a
condition that it would ferment. Entirely dry stuff, such as straw or
dead leaves, were of no use. Lawn mowings were eagerly appropriated,
but if too much was given the heap heated too fiercely, and did not
last warm for the whole incubation period.
The whole process has been watched, and described both in our
Zoological Gardens, and at the Gardens at Melbourne. I will not repeat
what has been already recorded, beyond saying that my birds were so
tame that I could stand within a yard of the male when he was doing
sentry on his heap, and could watch him digging down to the close
neighbourhood of the eggs without disturbing him. He always opened
the heap almost to the level of the eggs towards the end of the summer
afternoon, filling up the opening, and smoothing all over before sunset.
This was probably to cool the eggs.
There is one observation I was able to make, which I think has not
been noticed. I several times, in the morning, found that the cock bird
had cut away the side of the mound, leaving a perpendicular wall.
I believe this was to make the exit of the chick more easy ; and it
may have been that the bird heard the cry of the chick, and did his
best to help. We found several chicks at different times which had
failed to get out owing to the heap getting too much consolidated.
The male was, during the breeding season, always upon or close to the

mound, and constantly altering its appearance, and I was never
actually able to connect the cutting away of the side with the emergence i
of a chick, but I was convinced that this was the bird's purpose.
The young can fly at least four or five feet up to a perch the day they !
are hatched, and, of course, are perfectly independent of the parents.
The first young bird hatched at Scampston was found in the next
enclosure but one to that in which the mound was ; having somehow
managed to get under, over, or through two wire fences eight feet high ;
and it was discovered by the noise it made in vigorously scratching
amongst the dead leaves under some bushes.
I found the male bird very dangerous to other species. Besides
hunting his mate whenever he saw her, he was the bully of my collection,
and, being very active, it was difficult to keep him in his own domain.
I once saved an old Capercaillie cock from at least very severe punish-
ment. The Caper was on the run, with the Brush Turkey after him,
hitting him with his foot whenever he got within striking distance.
My Brush Turkeys are now in Sir Edmund Loder's beautiful park at
Leonardslea in Sussex, and, interesting as they were, I have never
regretted their departure !
Sandgrouse. These are peaceable, rather sluggish birds, not
difficult to keep in confinement if kept absolutely dry. They are not
as often kept as they deserve. I have had five species, the fine Arenarius,
Alchatus (both the Spanish and the Asiatic form), Exustus, and Bicinctus,
both of which last I have found delicate ; and Senegallus, which in
plumage is near Arenarius , and which with me is quite hardy in a dry
aviary. Sandgrouse should be kept on a dry, sandy floor, with plenty
of sharp grit, lime in the shape of old mortar, and some rocksalt.
Sveral species are great eaters of grass, lettuce, and such common
weeds as Shepherd's Purse ; but Bicinctus and Exustus with me will
look at nothing but small seeds.
And perhaps here I may suggest to the aviculturist the more free
use of maw seed, which, of course, is the seed of the various poppies.
The drug opium is, I believe, obtained by crushing the seed-capsule,
and the seed itself appears to have no injurious qualities. All Sand-
grouse and Quails are extremely fond of it, and my Bearded Tits
mainly live upon it.

The Sandgrouse are usually placed near the pigeons, but they
frequently lay three eggs, and the young feed themselves and wander
from the nest-scratch almost immediately. The young can be reared
upon maw seed, grass and clover seed, and the ripening seeds of chick-
weed, and shepherd's purse.
There is a very peculiar habit of at least some of the Sandgrouse,
via. the manner in which the young while unfledged receive water
from the male parent. My friend, Mr. Meade-Waldo, was the first
to record this interesting habit, having bred Pterocles alchatus in his
aviaries in Hampshire, and sent an account to the Avicultural
Magazine.
Mr. Waldo described how the cock bird (only) when it is aware
that the young are thirsty, becomes very restless, and runs up and
down the aviary, till presently it steps into the water pan, crouches
down with breast plumage distended, and might be thought to be
going to have a good wash. But it is not so, for when the soft feathers
are well soaked, it leaves the water, and runs towards the young,
uttering a cry which is quite unlike any of its usual notes. The nestlings
understand, and hurry up, and bury their heads in the soaked plumage,
and can be seen taking the wet feathers between their bills and evidently
accepting this rather scanty supply with the same quivering of the
wings that one sees in a young pigeon when being fed by the
parent.
It is, of course, true that the Sandgrouse breed in very arid districts,
with no opportunities of finding water, except in the form of dew,
which must soon disperse when the sun is up. At the same time the
food of the chick, if we may argue from what we see in our aviaries,
is not any form of insect life, or of succulent vegetation, but dry seeds
mainly : and therefore it seems that this habit has been evolved of the
male parent going off to seek water, often probably at such distances
that it seems strange that any fluid worth having remains after a flight
through the desert air. What Mr. Waldo recorded of Pterocles alchatus
I repeatedly witnessed, for we also got it to breed at Scampston.
I had told my man what to expect, but nevertheless so remarkable
is the performance that the first morning when I went down to the
aviary, knowing that the eggs were due to hatch, I found him standing

in speechless astonishment, the old bird having just run out to the
newly filled water pan to soak itself at his feet.
After this I bred Exustus, which has exactly the same habit.
Bicinctus has not laid with me, while a pair of Senegallus, though
laying frequently, are confirmed egg-eaters.
Both Mr. Waldo and I have had eggs from Arenarius , but no
further success, but he has told me that he has seen males enter the
villages in Morocco to soak in the puddles left round the wells, and then
fly off.
All four species that have nested with me have the same way of
dividing the duties of incubation, the females, with their plumage
harmonizing so wonderfully with sand and gravel, sitting by day ;
the male, which is often more bright-coloured, going on to the eggs for
the night.
In speaking of the Tragopans, three species of which I have kept
and bred, the Satyr, Temmincks, and Cabots, I can give another example
of a habit noted by the aviculturist which could hardly have been
observed in a wild state, especially when the subject inhabits such
wild difficult ground, and has such skulking ways, as the Tragopans.
At any rate, it was not known until I recorded it from experience with
my birds, that the Tragopans habitually nest in trees. Although,
like all gamebirds, they will occasionally drop eggs on the ground in
confinement, my birds have never attempted to incubate unless the
latter were placed on a nest or platform off the ground.
Sometimes they have made use of rough platforms of twigs which
we have put up for them in yew or spruce trees, sometimes they have
appropriated old pigeon's nests. Once a Temminck Tragopan hen
laid her eggs in a Stockdove's nest in some ivy, seventeen feet from the
ground. How she found the nest I could not imagine. She could only
reach it by climbing up a yew tree, and passing along a horizontal
branch, from which she could spring into the ivy.
In all these cases the bird made some addition to the platform or
nest, as a finishing touch generally placing a few green twigs of yew
or spruce by way of lining.
Perhaps from finding plenty of sites ready to hand, it was not till
this season that a Tragopan ever built a nest entirely of itself. In this

case a rather untidy pigeon-like nest was made in a spruce-tree some
five feet from the ground, constructed of live, and dead, small branches
and twigs of the spruce ; and though it looked a shaky structure, it
bore the weight of sitting bird and eggs. I must have had at least
thirty clutches of eggs since I have kept Tragopans, laid in all cases
off the ground ; and so I think I may safely draw the conclusion that
this is the natural habit.
In this unusual nesting propensity the Tragopan shows itself very
distinct from its nearest allies, the Grouse and Pheasants. Moreover,
the nestling is clothed with a peculiar hairy down, and can fly several
feet, and even from branch to branch, when newly hatched. In fact
the bird is strikingly arboreal in its ways.
The Roller. Though very handsome, I don't recommend the
European Roller as an aviary bird to anyone who is not prepared to
take a great deal of trouble. The bird is extremely nervous and shy,
and unless great care is used, will certainly spoil its plumage against the
wires of the aviary. It is quite impossible to keep either an Oriole or
a Roller in a cage, for the same reason. Both are shy, and both are
short-legged, and when clinging to the side of a cage will not keep their
bodies off the wires like a Crow or a Thrush, but seem to find a perverse
delight in thrusting tail and flights through, till nothing but stumps
remain.
Rollers are so nervous that I have known one suffer real hunger
and decline to come down to the foodpan, because a brush had been
accidentally left inside the door.
With regard to food, a Roller lives much like a Shrike, and therefore
must have a Shrike's food : mice, beetles, meal-worms, and, when
meat is given, it must have at the same time what a falconer calls
" casting ", namely feathers or fur, which it will presently eject as a
pellet.
Therefore, to get Rollers to breed, which was at one time my
ambition, I had first to get hold of two sound birds, which was not easy ;
then get them well moulted, and thoroughly used to the aviary ; and
finally only one person ever went into the covered part of the aviary,
in which we fixed up a large hollow log. Without going into details
now, which I have elsewhere recorded, I will only say that in due course

the birds paired and took to the log, eggs were laid, and finally, to my
great satisfaction, young birds were heard clamouring for food. And
here a failure nearly occurred with the young, and a tragedy between
the parents could not be prevented. Whether we showed too much
interest in the event or not, suddenly the hen bird was seized with a
blind fit of jealousy against her mate, who was peaceable enough, poor
fellow, and only too anxious to do his duty by his family. But the
excited virago forgot her nestlings, and thought of nothing but of
buffeting and fighting with her mate, who never-offered any resistance.
The young were in danger, so I removed the cock, and the mother
instantly went back to her duties. But it was the end of the beautiful
male. In another aviary he passed the greater part of two days
ceaselessly flying from perch to perch with food in his beak, calling to
the young which were not there, and then taking no food himself,
pined and died.
Pine-Grosbeak. Of all the smaller hardy birds that one can keep
in a garden aviary, I think there is none more desirable than the Pine-
Grosbeak. It is utterly impervious to the worst weather as one would
expect, and is from the first extremely tame. Although, of course,
it is always best, if one can, to keep one breeding pair apart from others
of the same species, I have never known the Pine-Grosbeak interfere
with any other kind of bird, even of the smallest. Another merit is
that the cocks, so far as my experience goes, retain their bright colour,
while, as is well known, males of Crossbills, Linnets, and Bedpoles are
apt to lose it at the first moult, and do not regain it. Mr. Hugh Wormald,
however, says that since he has fed his Bedpolls on the seeds of the reed,
they have kept their colour. It probably is a question of health
produced by correct food, with fresh air and space for exercise. I have
more than once bred the Pine-Grosbeak, though it had not been
previously done in this country. They made a substantial and neat
nest of dry spruce twigs, and lined it mostly with dead grass, and a
little moss.
The tameness of the brooding hen was very remarkable. Of course,
we have all noticed how bold the sitting Bullfinch, a very near ally of
the Pine-Grosbeak, often is. When the nestlings were hatched, the
female parent very sensibly availed herself to the full extent of any

assistance that we could offer by way of food for the young. I have
stood within a yard of the nest, and seen my bird-keeper offer fresh
ants' eggs in a teaspoon to the old bird as she sat, which she took, and
after holding them in her mouth for a minute or two, probably to
moisten them, pass them on to the nestlings.
Sooner or later every aviculturist is likely to have it brought home
to him how very highly strung and nervous birds often are by nature ;
and it leads to many grievous disappointments. In 1903 I was the
first to get the Waxwing to lay its eggs in confinement. Much interest
has always attached to the breeding habits of this charming bird, and
much mystery. Until the discovery of its nesting grounds in the
forests of Lapland, the egg was unknown to ornithologists.
Mr. Wolley's exhibition of the first nest and eggs, the fruits of
several arduous expeditions in the Far North, caused great excitement
in scientific circles. Attempts had been made by keeping a flock
in an aviary to get an egg or two dropped, but with no success.
Last winter I brought an egg, the first ever laid except in the wild
state,and showed it at one of the Yorkshire Naturalists' Unionmeetings
at Leeds.
In 1903, though eggs were hatched at Scampston, the young were
not reared, and the only point gained was that the period of incubation,
fourteen days, was ascertained.
I had every hope of doing better the following season, as I had the
same pair of birds, and apparently in splendid health. The Waxwing
is rather sluggish, and one would think not very sensitive or emotional.
However, the hen died unaccountably, perhaps from egg-binding, for
there was no examination ; and the first sign that anything was wrong
was that her body was found on the floor of the aviary, and the cock bird
sitting huddled up close by it, and he died in a few hours. If this was
not death from a broken heart it was at least very near it!
This summer I had a still greater disappointment. A pair of
Waxwings nested, and began to sit on the 22nd June, and a fortnight
later the eggs were chipping. The interesting event greatly excited the
hen bird, and in the end she positively died in a sort of fit; while
a few hours afterwards the male also succumbed to an effusion of blood
upon the brain. I think we had perhaps got the birds in too high

condition. They are, as I have said, sluggish birds with great appetites.
Being largely eaters of flying insects in a wild state, they get plenty
of exercise chasing their food. In an aviary, life is made too easy for
them, and they become apoplectic. I hope to guard against this
another year. But we had to deal with the eggs which were chipping
and nearly cold. There was luckily in another aviary a Snow-bunting
just due to hatch, so the Waxwing's eggs were put under her. Only
one hatched, the others having got hopelessly chilled. The Snow-
buntings reared their foster-child for a week ; when perhaps because
another pair of Snow-buntings were nesting too near, and owing to the
resulting quarrels, the nestling Waxwing seemed to be getting neglected,
and to be growing weaker. My man conceived the idea of taking it and
putting it into a Blackbird's nest, lined, and covered with a flap of
cotton-wool. Here it was fed at very frequent intervals on flies, fresh
ants' eggs, gentles, and small silk-worms, for three days. There seemed
a good chance of rearing it, but one morning it was found dead for no
obvious reason ; but being a solitary bird, it may not have been kept
warm enough ; on the other hand I do not feel certain that it was not
stifled by the wool. This was its eleventh day, and so far this is the
greatest age to which a young Waxwing hatched in captivity has
attained, though Mr. Reginald Phillipps, who has been wonderfully
successful in keeping and breeding delicate and difficult birds, had a
brood in his garden aviary in West Kensington this summer, which
lived a week, and only succumbed apparently to a spell of very wet
weather.
I should think it likely that the young Waxwing development
is slow, for my nestling's eyes were only partly opened on the
eleventh day.
The gape was of a brilliant crimson-violet, which vanished speedily
after death, and had almost disappeared when the bird had reached the
Natural History Museum (in spirit). It was curious to note that though
the primaries were only just beginning to shoot, the scarlet wax tips
of the secondaries could be distinctly seen through their transparent
sheaths.

when the hordes of the little rodents were over-running the district,
attended as usual by numbers of beasts and birds of prey, the beasts
including wolves, and the birds including Goshawks, Rough-legged and
Common Buzzards, and Snowy Owls. 1
A Lapp had brought the young birds many miles, in a rough
basket, and they were in a sorry plight. He had a bag hanging on his
back, and as he turned away, my friend saw it move, and asked what
was inside. It was the poor male bird, which had been daring enough
to dash at the Lapp's chest when he was taking the young, and got its
claws entangled in the latter's clothing, and was grabbed before he
could clear himself. There was also the body of the female owl, which
had been bored through with a spherical bullet, from an elk rifle, fired
at very close quarters, as she sat snapping her beak while her nest was
being robbed. They were being taken further down the valley, to an
official, so that the head-money offered for beasts and birds of prey
might be claimed. My friend secured both for a price slightly above the
official reward, and cleverly brought the old bird, who was half-stifled,
but not otherwise seriously hurt, back to complete health, and he came
over to England with the nestlings.
My birds have gone to nest many times. They are late breeders,
and if July is a warm month, the young are seldom reared. This season
the owlets were suited well enough by the cool moist weather, and
there were two a fortnight old, which seemed doing well. Suddenly
the old female turned on them, and not only killed, but ate them both.
They are always kept as quiet as possible when breeding, and I cannot
account for it.
As regards the plumage, these birds differ greatly. Some individuals
are much more spotted than others. As a rule the males, which in
the plumage of the first year are heavily spotted, though the markings
are always smaller and paler than in the case of the females of the same
1 Two years later I was fishing in the same valley. A few wolves remained.
They had practically destroyed the small flock of a farmer near where I stayed,
a few days before I got there. But the Snowy Owls had retired to the higher
mountains, and there was no more than the usual number of the other Raptores
breeding in the neighbourhood that season. But I was shown places where
quantities of Lemming skeletons and skins remained, notably a cutting on the
Stockholm and Trondhjem Railway, where the little animals tumbled over a rock
some forty feet high on to the line, and had smothered each other in a water gully.

age, become more and more white each moult until about four years
old, and then remain without further change.
My old male bird 1 has this autumn in the moult altered his
appearance a good deal. Since his fourth year, he had been pure white,
except for a few black spots on the tertiaries on both sides. This time
he has put down many spotted feathers on the wing coverts, so that the
character of his plumage is changed from what it had been for fourteen
or fifteen years.

Sir,--I t was in the year 1913 that I saw the Malachite Sunbird
for the first time, the owner being our President, Mr. Ezra. As I stood
in front of its exhibition cage, I made a vow that if ever I had the chance
I would have one of these wonderful creatures. It was not, however,
until 1926 that the chance came my way. A friend of mine wrote
saying he had a small consignment of African birds privately imported
and among them was a young cock Malachite. The price was a stiff
one but I did not hesitate, and I have never regretted buying it. I
fed him at first on the usual mixture of condensed milk, honey and
Mellin's food, but this did not suit him and I nearly lost him. I then
tried a mixture of Horlick's malted milk and sugar in equal parts,
and he has never looked back and has remained in perfect health
ever since. The Malachite is one of the largest of the Sunbirds and is
a wonderful metallic green, with yellow tufts of feathers on the flanks.
The tail is much elongated by two long feathers. When I first saw
my bird in full colour I made another vow that I would never part
with him. When I was about to leave my native town to take up my
present position I received many tempting offers from well-known
1 Not the old male caught by the Lapp, but one of the young birds brought
over in 1891 by H. S. B. He died of tubercle, 27th December, 1915. His mate
died in 1900. They reared young several times. They were both wild-bred
birds of 1891.

Sir,--- On visiting St. James's Park on two occasions during the
Easter holidays I saw no Mandarins,- not even any pinioned birds,
though I went at the best time for seeing them, near nightfall. I did,
however, see specimens of two Ducks rare in aviculture--one specimen
of the Black-billed Tree-Duck ( Dendrocycna arborea), which has been
exhibited at the Zoo, and three of the Eastern Spot-bill (Chinese Grey
Duck, or Yellow-nib (Anas zonorhyncha ), apparently a drake and two
ducks. I have never seen this alive before. Apropos of rare St. James's
Park Ducks, I may mention that the old male Grey-headed Sheldrake
and his male offspring all have black eyes, though the correct eye-colour
for the male of this species is yellow.
In Mr. Prestwich's very full and interesting report on the foreign
birds at the Palace Show, mention is made of Grey Touracous and of
a Spur-winged Plover. As these names apply to several species in
each case, I should like to say that the Plover was the Cayenne Lapwing
or Tern-tero, and the Touracous were of the Bare-faced species
(Gymnoschizorhis ) shown last year. The Grey Touracou par excellence
(Schizorhis concolor) has never been shown, so far as I know, though

as I can recall, the only bird of a complete neutral grey, with no tinge

Sir, --After six months' residence in my aviary a pair of Bambusicola
fytcJiii made a nest of trampled foliage five feet from the ground against
a wall which had tree boughs suspended to it, and on this platform
nest three eggs were laid of a dark creamy colour and on the 12th
December last three young ones appeared. Unfortunately a very
heavy rainstorm swamped the nest, the young ones were disturbed
and fell to the ground in an effort to hide themselves, whilst the mother
bird " clucked " excitedly in the vicinity. Next day two of the young
had disappeared. The third one was cold and wet. I made an effort
to recover it by warming it in a stove, and when it could run about
I returned it to the mother, but it died the following day. Am I right
in the belief that this is the first record of chicks of this species being
hatched ?

A CRANE IN HUNTINGDONSHIRE
Sir, --About the middle of April, 1931, a. Crane appeared on the
Bedford River Washes above St. Ives in Huntingdonshire. This bird,
by its behaviour, appeared to be quite wild, but as it is still there at
the time of writing (mid-May), it may have escaped from some collection
in this area.
Would any of your readers who have lost such a bird please be good
enough to communicate with me, as I am anxious to discover whether
or not this is a genuinely wild one.

Sir, --As an alternative to training Weavers to use a feeding-box
whose contents Sparrows will not easily discover, Mr. Webb might try
training the Weavers, before release, to feed from a vessel underneath
a wire-netting trap-feeding tray. The upper part is shaped rather like
a dish-cover, and is propped up in front with a piece of wood about
3 inches high. When the prop is dislodged by a pull on the string
attached to it, the birds underneath are imprisoned, and can be removed
by hand through a small door in the top of the dish-cover arrangement.
In this way, using a pair of field-glasses, it is possible to keep down the
Sparrows when they only happen to be feeding on the tray. If a Weaver
is accidentally overlooked it is best to release the whole lot of birds
immediately, and not try to take out the Sparrows first. One end of
the line attached to the prop must be carried behind a hide or screen,
from which an observer can watch the feeding birds. Since string
shrinks in wet weather, and will pull the trap shut, it is well to have a
light weight of half a pound attached to the hide end of the line, and
leave it free with plenty of spare length. The weight keeps the line
from sagging unduly, but does not pull hard enough to dislodge the
prop when not desired.
In some gardens Weavers at liberty will leave in early summer and
return in August and September. Feeding should, therefore, be con-
tinued even if the birds appear to have left.

cannot thank our friend, Dr. Hopkinson, too much for his most generous

carried out, it would simply mean that the Index would defeat its own
object. By giving a reference to every bird, one would have to turn up
endless pages to find only a reference to the name, whereas now I take
it that a reference will refer to, say, feeding, nesting, cure of disease,
and any other notes on housing, winter and summer treatment, etc.
Then there are many articles on the layout of aviaries, planting of
same, and various little gadgets useful to aviculturalists.
In conclusion, let us hope that the Index will be well supported,
and that every member will buy a copy, and by so doing, we would
pay Dr. Hopkinson the greatest compliment possible for the immense

AVICULTURE, VOLS. II AND III
The first volume of Aviculture was published in 1925 and dealt
with the Pas series, the various chapters having first appeared in the
pages of the Avicultural Magazine. The concluding portion of the
work, which is profusely illustrated with coloured and uncoloured
plates, deals with the remaining groups of such birds as are suited
to aviculture. It is divided into two volumes which will probably be
ready by the time this is in print, and can be obtained from our
publishers, Messrs. Stephen Austin &amp; Sons, of Hertford.
The work, which will be found to be of great practical value to
aviculturists, must not be confused with an American journal with the
same title, which first appeared after the publication of Volume I.
The edition is limited to 300 copies, so it is advisable to order early.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989359375" page_id="56181886"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
There are some twenty species or subspecies of the genus Geoffroyus
inhabiting New Guinea and the islands in its vicinity, but only some
two or three have been imported. Mr. St. Alban Smith has recently
sent to the Zoological Society two examples of G. aruensis, one of
which lived for several months and attained the full plumage of the
male ; the other succumbed within a month of its arrival.
There is no doubt that Geoffroyus is a very delicate genus of Parrots,
and although when in full plumage the males are decidedly beautiful,
with very delicate colouring, they have otherwise very few attractive
qualities. One of the Zoo birds was very tame, but certainly not
friendly. The food presents no difficulty, consisting of grain and
fruit, but probably the question of temperature is the difficult one
with these Parrots.
Our illustration shows the male, the female differing in having
the head brown.

(Concluded from page 176) 1
My Ravens are regular breeders, and, of course, very early in their
nesting operations. They would sometimes build, if they had the
materials, before January was out, but I think it early enough to supply
them with their sticks about the middle of February. A large basket
is then fixed up in a corner of the aviary, and a barrow load of larch
and birch branches is thrown in, also pieces of turf and wool. Moss
used to be given, but it was never used. The birds work so energetically
that in a week's time the nest is ready for eggs. The period of incubation
is twenty-one days, and the young do not leave the nest till five
weeks old.
Last year five fine young were successfully reared, and duly
distributed amongst my friends. This was rather a severe tax upon
not only the parents, but also upon those who had to procure and
prepare the food for such a family ; and no one was sorry when this
spring's brood was found to consist of but two, probably owing to the
first-laid eggs having been frozen.
As an old falconer, I ought to have known better than to feed
as I did the first brood, some five years ago, with too light food. The
keepers were killing down rabbits at the time, and small ones were
brought in and freely given to the Ravens. They were, of course,
quite fresh, and there was an ample supply, but the young Ravens
developed " ricketts ". When the time came for them to leave the
nest, not only were their beaks crooked, but their wings and legs were
bent and bowed. It was nothing but want of sufficiently nourishing
diet. 2 Since that lesson, I have always seen that the Ravens had a
regular supply of rough butcher's meat, as well as other lighter food,

and with the best results. Ravens are, of course, absolutely omnivorous,
and nothing edible comes amiss. Even hempseed is readily picked up.
The bark is easily heard on a still day quite two miles away. It is
strange to hear the male, who is possessed of greater vocal accomplish-
ments than his mate, after a series of coarse reverberating notes, drop
his voice and exactly imitate the crooning of the Jackdaws in the
hollow elm tree over his head.
The last bird I shall refer to is the Secretary Bird, of which
I have two very fine examples, which I am hoping will turn out to be
a pair.
The Secretary Bird, besides a kind of " roar ", has some rather
eagle-like notes, and his beak is that of a bird of prey, but otherwise
he seldom betrays his relation to the Raptores, and many of his ways
are peculiar to himself.
My birds came from Potchefstroom, in the Transvaal, and were
brought as nestlings to my friend, Major Horsbrugh, in a pillow-case
on the back of a burgher, who had ridden on his bicycle forty odd
miles with this burden. They have enormous appetites, and I fear
gave much trouble before they were old enough to send off to England.
They take an immense amount of exercise, and delight in racing about
in a good big enclosure, which they share with some Cranes, and the
Great Bustards. Their movements often remind one of the aeroplane.
The neck is outstretched, the wings wide spread, and held without
flapping at such an angle that after the bird has run across the field
(his paddling feet representing the motor), he is sometimes lifted off
the ground. I ought to say this used to be the case, for to my regret
I found it necessary to pinion the birds, and now they are not evenly
balanced as before.
They are fed twice a day, and stuff down an extraordinary amount
of food with fur, feather, and bone. Luckily they are not particular,
and all rats, moles, and even stoats and weasels are reserved for them.
But a hen's egg is their special dainty, and in eating them they have
shown a good deal of intelligence. They have no intention of breaking
the shell and losing any of the contents. On the contrary, the egg is
to be swallowed whole, and reliance is placed on the gastric juices to
dissolve the shell. They used to find it difficult to pick up the egg

W. H. St. Quintin--Some Avicultural Notes
when in a standing position, without cracking it, but now they flex
their long legs, lay the lower mandible flat on the ground, and shovel
up the egg. That the egg is swallowed whole is certain, for I have
known one of them dispose of three eggs one after the other, and when
pursued by the other bird, deliver them up on the grass still unbroken.
I have never offered my birds a snake, but an eel is treated with
much caution as if it might be dangerous, and receives many unnecessary
blows long after all motion has ceased, before it is swallowed. The
blows with the foot are given with great rapidity, and a rat released
from a trap has no chance, and is rolled over very neatly, getting a
disabling blow, generally on the head, in spite of his activity. Though
their inclination is to swallow their prey whole, if given too large a
piece, of rabbit for instance, they will hold it under their feet, and
tear off pieces, cleverly enough, like an ordinary bird of prey.
The birds are quick-tempered, and are best kept in separate compart-
ments when in a shed. Sometimes if they have a difference, one will
give the other a resounding thump with its foot; and I have known
an inquisitive Stanley Crane thrown back a yard or more by an
unexpected blow on the chest.
In summer it is pretty to watch them striding about their paddock
examining the grass, and stooping down to pick up a sleepy fly or
beetle, or standing watchfully over a tuft as if they had heard a
mouse stir.
Major Horsbrugh tells me that he has seen a wild Secretary Bird
extend a wing and gently touch a bush, and like a flash strike at a
lizard or locust which might be disturbed and try to escape. Any
low-flying butterfly, such as a meadow-brown, is soon knocked down
and eaten by my birds, and I have seen one pursue even a common
blue across the enclosure, striking at it whenever he got a chance,
but, as far as I have seen, without success. But evidently insects form
a large portion of their natural food, and I should think they must
destroy a great amount of locusts.
Their way of resting is unusual, and very unlike that of other members
of their order. They lie down with wings pressed close to the side, and
when walked into their sheds for the night, lie down almost at once.
In the summer, when left out altogether, they creep under the

spreading branches of some young spruce fir, and so roost. My specimens
are of the South African species, with brilliant orange yellow cere.
The form found in the equatorial regions have the same parts rose pink
in colour. I notice that when my birds are greatly excited, a suffusion
of pink creeps over the yellow cere, in fact the bird blushes !
I should like here to acknowledge my indebtedness to my bird-keeper,
Arthur Moody, to whose skill and care much of such success as I have
achieved is due : as well as many important observations, and notes
taken when I have been from home.
In conclusion, it is pleasant to think that ornithology has now
become something more than a science, it is a popular study. Not only
is there a desire on the part of the public, no less eager than before,
for information on structure and classification, which can only be
properly worked out in the museum and laboratory ; but in addition
there is a thirst for knowledge, as full as may be, of how birds live, and
what their ways are, how they feed, and display their plumage, make
their nests, and tend their young.
The wonderful supply of beautiful photographs which exhibit
the life-history of birds is a proof of this demand. I have for a large
portion of my life found much interest in studying this aspect of the
delightful science of ornithology; and it is a great addition to one's
pleasure if one can impart some of that interest to others.

By H. L. Sigh
A few years ago I received a pair of Bluebirds (Sialia sialis ) from
France by air, as the only way that there seemed to be of getting
them over alive. Of course I was very anxious to breed from them,
and from one of the accounts of them which I read, I gathered that
they were rather fastidious about their nesting site, so I did not trouble
to move an old cardboard travelling-box from the wall of their shelter ;
I was alarmed to find them nesting in it at the end of March, as soon
as the thaw set in, after one of the coldest winters we have had this

H. L. Sich--My Bluebirds
century ; when six young hatched early in April, there was only
mealworms to feed them on ; they lived for about a week when even
these ran out and they starved.
Two young left the next nest, but one had injured its brain and
twisted its head round until it fell upon its back. I have had some
Quail affected in the same way after damaging their heads. This
bird I killed, then the parents refused to feed the other one. The hen
laid and incubated again that year and three times the next summer,
but they always threw out the eggs as soon as they began to chip ;
then they started to kill their companions, among them was a Hooded
Siskin X Canary Cock and a whole brood of hybrids between a
Chestnut-breasted Finch and a Yellow-rumped Mannikin ; being tired
of such behaviour, I went to put them in a smaller flight by them-
selves, unfortunately killing the hen in the process. Last Autumn
I got another pair ; they have now four young, two look almost ready
to leave the nest, the others seem rather more backward as far as
one is able to see. The parents will not feed them on gentles or live
ants' eggs but have been brought up on boiled mealworms so far.
Mr. Bartlett, the late superintendent of the Zoological Society,
said that he tried to rear young Dippers from the nest and always
failed with everything he tried, including shrimps and salmon spawn,
until one of the keepers suggested scalding the mealworms, and then
he was quite successful.
A few days ago, I turned into a flight opposite to the Bluebirds,
but separated by a 6 ft. wide passage, a pair of Blue Grosbeaks ;
this was too much for them seeing two birds coloured much like them-
selves, they quite forgot their young and flew onto the wire netting,
scalding the Grosbeaks, which took not the slightest notice of them ;
as they were still at it after two hours, there was nothing to be done
except catch up the unfortunate Grosbeaks and put them in a much
smaller flight out of sight and loose all chance of their nesting
this year. 1

The Mandarin Duck is now established as a semi-wild breeding
species in certain parts of this country, such as at Woburn in Bedford-
shire and Fallodon in Northumberland, and it seems to remain and
increase in districts in which the conditions are favourable. It is
perhaps the most ornamental of all of the duck tribe (though the
Carolina runs it very close) and it had always been an ambition of
mine to see it established as a resident breeding species in the London
district where, one would have thought, the various parks and open
spaces would have suited its requirements.
Thanks to the generosity of Messrs. Alfred Ezra, and J. Spedan
Lewis, and the co-operation of Mr. Alex Hampe of Shanghai, we were
able to arrange for the importation of a fairly large consignment of
these birds from China last year, as reported in this Journal. Some
forty pairs were received in the early part of the year. These were
not pinioned, but one wing of each bird was clipped, with the idea
that they would be incapable of flight until after the next moult,
by which time, it was hoped, they would have become thoroughly
accustomed to their new home and surroundings, and would stay
in the neighbourhood and perhaps nest in the special boxes and barrels
that were provided for their use. Six pairs went to Foxwarren Park,
four pairs to the Zoo, and the remainder were handed over to
H.M. Office of Works and taken charge of by Mr. Hinton, the capable
keeper of the Waterfowl at St. James's Park. Here they were marked
with aluminium rings, bearing an impression of a crown and the
initials " G.R.", and then placed on the waters of St. James's Park,
Hyde Park, Greenwich Park, Regent's Park, Hampton Court, and
Buckingham Palace.
The moult commenced about the end of June, and by the
autumn many of them were on the wing and it was interesting
to watch their flights. Those on the Regent's Park water
appeared to join those in the Zoo, and every evening at dusk
one could see parties of from a dozen to eighteen flying round, their
call-notes as they flew being quite different to those of the Mallard

and Teal, which also took flights at this time. At times the Three
Island Pond in the Zoo seemed to be literally swarming with
Mandarins and in December and January all the males seemed to be
displaying at the same time. The barrels fixed in the trees at the
Zoo were often visited by pairs, and a pair took up their abode for
a time on one of the Hampstead Heath ponds. For a time it seemed
that the experiment was well on its way to succeed, but as the season
advanced the birds appear to have gone farther afield and their visits
to the London ponds became fewer. Still we hoped that some at
least would remain, and I am not sure that all have gone as full-
winged birds are still occasionally seen about and a full-winged drake
is certainly paired to a pinioned duck in the Zoo. But it seems an
undoubted fact that they have spread much farther than we anticipated,
if, indeed, some have not actually tried to fly back to China !
In the Daily Telegraph, of May 13th, 1931, appeared a statement
that, according to a Reuter message from Budapest, two ducks were
shot by a gamekeeper at a fishpond in the district of Zala, in Hungary,
each of which bore a ring on its leg with the initials " G.R." The rings
were eventually sent to England by the President of the Hungarian
Ornithological Society and identified by Mr. Hinton as some which
he himself had affixed, so there is unfortunately no doubt that these
were some of our London Mandarin Ducks.
It may be that to establish a resident race of such birds one must,
first of all, breed from pinioned specimens, allowing their progeny
the full use of their wings. But, I think, if I had anything to do with
another experiment of the kind I would pinion the drakes only, and
allow the ducks to go free.

It has occurred to me that the rather strange story of how I came

wing a bird, and one evening a basket came with a perfect specimen,
except that it couldn't fly. There was no sign whatever of its having
been shot and no mark of any wound anywhere. I turned it into a
small aviary, but having no previous experience of getting waders
on to aviary food, and not being able to find anything on this subject
in my library, I thought the best thing to do was to try it with earth
worms, so we dug a good supply and for several days it ate nothing
but these put on the top of a coarse insectivorous food made up with
scalded, crushed biscuit meal. It began to take a little of this food
along with the worms and some bread and milk. Now the next step
was to get it off worms, as worms are uncertain things, especially
in frost when the garden gets as hard as rock, so what we did was to
cut strips of bullock's heart to look like worms and very soon we had
the satisfaction of seeing our Lapwings eating these greedily. I forgot
to mention that the same friend got me a second Lapwing the following
week unwounded and unable to fly, just the same as the first. We
gradually stopped the earth worms, except as a treat when procurable,
and substituted the crushed biscuit, well scalded with hot water,
a little boiled rice and heart chopped into small pieces about J in.
each way.
After keeping them in the small aviary for a few weeks we put
them in the large waders' aviary, which is nearly forty feet square,
and has a good pond with plenty of cover and grass for the waders
to pick in. In a short time first one and then the other regained the
power of flight. From this I take it that a pickle of half-spent shot
must have struck the wing, temporarily stunning a nerve or muscle,
which caused loss of flying power.
It is a lovely sight to see these large waders flying round the aviary,
just tipping the roof with the points of their wings uttering their
peculiar cry of peewit. They are in splendid form and look in the
pink of condition.
Lapwings have several funny little habits which are noticeable
in the close-up view one gets in an aviary. One of these is the peculiar
way the bird can raise and depress its crest, not only in the fore and
aft way, but also laterally at the same time dividing the crest into
two separate points across the top of the head. One of the Lapwings

Capt. H. S. Stokes--The President&apos;s Party
has a most peculiar habit of pumping its neck and head up and down
after a short run, just as if it had swallowed a stone which it was trying
to get either up or down. When I first noticed this shortly after
arrival, I thought it had something to do with its having been shot
at, but apparently it is only a habit of this species.
I am rather afraid that Lapwings are egg stealers, as I have found
several eggs of the Cuban Tree Quails lying about broken and sucked.
I am not quite certain whether they are to blame or perhaps the Black
Rails, most Rails have rather a bad name for egg stealing. 1
My Lapwings and other Waders have the following diet to choose
from. A coarse insectivorous mixture made up with scalded biscuit
meal and boiled rice varied with potatoes ; then a dish of bread and
milk, both made up fresh each morning. For grain I give a dish of
crushed maize, a dish of Indian millet and a third dish made up of
white millet and canary seed. For live food they get earthworms
as often as possible, failing them in winter a few mealworms. From
May on, they get gentles from a sheep's head, this latter gives a good
supply for about a week, when we get a fresh head.
When I am reading in the dark evenings, I often hear their weird
cry bringing back to me many happy days spent bird-watching and
egg-collecting in the huge bogs which are such a well-known feature
of Irish landscape.

Whether we measure our happiness in terms of birds, or of human
kindness, everyone of us who went to Foxwarren Park on Saturday,
May 30, will agree that our cup of happiness was a full one. For
the birds are legion, the sun shone for us, and the kindness and
hospitality of our President and Mrs. Ezra are always unbounded.
This famous collection of birds and beasts has been described
from time to time in these pages, but a few notes of current events
will interest those members who were unable to go to the party.

The chief and most important additions to the aviaries are perhaps
Parrakeets. There are a pair each of the rare and lovely Hooded
(Psephotus dissimilis), Queen Alexandra's ( Spathopterus alexandrce),
Turquoisine (Neophema pulchella ), Bourkes (N. hourkei) and elegant
Grass Parrakeets (N. elegans), all in lovely condition.
The famous Blue Alexandrine Parrakeet paired to a green hen
again has a family of four. This is the third year they have bred,
and it is therefore only a matter of time and patience for a blue strain
to be produced. The young will be paired inter se, but at present
are not showing the distinctive sex plumage. The Yellow Alexandrine
hen also has young. One of two hen Derbyan Parrakeets, mated to
a green cock Alexandrine, hatched a young one, but unfortunately
it died. Malabar Parrakeets had just hatched. Superb Spreos have
again bred, and one or two rare Starlings--Rothschild's Grackle and
Salvadon's Starling--have laid and hatched, but the parents seem
always to throw out their young. Mr. Ezra intends to try the
experiment of letting them out into the garden when they have young,
to forage for insects. This practice has been found very successful
with some softbills, especially Shamas.

unfortunately their eggs prove infertile.
Returning to the birdroom we saw many old friends--Wallace's,

Coco the Mynah and the tame Fruit Pigeon performed for us, and we
saw a very tame and attractive Nuthatch from East Africa. The

the females were carrying young in the pouch. Chukor Partridges
were everywhere. A Monaul Pheasant has four strong chicks.
Bankiva and Sonnerat's Jungle Fowl have overflowed from the

Teal and five Pink-headed Ducks and a pair of the curious little White-
backed Ducks (Thallasorius leuconota ) are of special interest among
an interesting crowd of waterfowl. Numerous ducklings from collected
eggs were being reared here. Many pairs of full-winged Mandarin
Ducks inhabit the barrels placed high up in the trees, and some pairs
must have hatched their young. Two pairs of Brush Turkeys, new
to the collection, have large mound nests.
The Manchurian Cranes are sitting in long grass, and last but not
least, a pair of Stanley Cranes have a nest in the wood. They have
become so fierce that we were not able to approach them.
This lovely species has not yet been bred in England, and it is
greatly to be hoped that they will add another triumph to our
President's list of well-won successes.

Though I believe articles on the lives of better known birds are
of more use to readers of the Magazine, I cannot resist from writing
a short chapter on these two extremely rare but equally interesting
and charming birds belonging to a genus little known in this country
as cage or aviary birds, namely, the Arachnothera or Spider-hunters.
These strange-looking birds are but rarely imported alive in spite
of their numerous attributes and are consequently almost unknown
to any but the scientific ornithologist, who is only familiar with the
dried skins of the birds.
One of these birds, an Indian species, was brought over to this
country by the late Capt. Perreau just previous to the War. No others
I believe were brought over until Mr. Goodfellow imported three in
1927 from Borneo, this same gentleman imported several more from
the same country in 1930, my birds being two of them.
This strange genus of the birds form a rather compact but very

distinct family closely allied to tlie Sunbirds, in fact both the Spider-
hunters and the Sunbirds are classified in the same family of the
Nectariniidse, but I do not think that their relationship is as close as
to justify them being placed in the same family. At first sight they
resemble rather large dull-coloured Sunbirds with huge curved beaks
and in the case of A. everetti, the beak is almost as long as the body
of the bird itself.
Most of the Spider-hunters are of sombre coloration, none of them
having the brilliant colours of the Sunbirds, being of a moss or olive
green and yellow marked and streaked with lighter or darker shades
and their beaks are very much longer than those of any of the Sunbirds.
Though so closely allied to the latter birds they differ very considerably
from each other in demeanour in captivity.
I believe that the few birds which have been kept in captivity
upon the rare occasions when they have been imported have not been
a great success and I attribute any success which I have had with
them to the fact that they have been kept in a high temperature, this
being absolutely necessary to the well-being of these birds. They are
not happy unless the thermometer registers 80* F. or more ; below
70* F. the birds are listless, are miserable and breathe heavily. This
is not surprising as they inhabit some of the hottest regions on the
globe, the humid and tropical valleys and kloofs of the equatorial
regions of the Far East where the average temperature must be over
100* F., so it is not to be wondered at that the birds cannot thrive
when kept at a temperature only half of that which they have been
used to.
Keeping the birds in this warm atmosphere makes it imperative
that the liquid food is changed at least twice a day or it is liable to
become sour. The food I find the best is a heaped teaspoon of Mellin's
Food mixed in half a cup of fresh milk and filled up with boiling water,
in which a dessert spoon of honey has been dissolved.
Despite their name I find that the birds do not eat spiders, in fact
I find that they refuse all insect food, though I am hoping that when
I release them in my greenhouse aviary which is now in the course
of construction they will be able to find a certain amount of
natural food.

Imagine a bird the size of a linnet with the beak very nearly as
large as that of a curlew and then you have something of an idea of
what the Everett's Spider-hunter looks like. This bird is of a dark
bronzed green above with the whole of the under parts a bright pale
olive yellow, on the back are two long tufts of pale coloured feathers
which hang over the wings and give the bird a very peculiar look,
it also possesses pectoral tufts which are expanded when the bird is
excited and which shows its kinship to the Sunbirds. The beak,
which is larger in proportion to the size of the body than any other
small bird I know of, is black. This bird has two white spots on the
end of the two outer tail feathers.
The other bird, which is the smaller of the two and is about the size
of a small Sunbird, is a beautiful shade of shining moss-green above
with a small yellow spot on the shoulder of each wing. Below is of
an ashy-greenish grey with faint shaft streaks, the other tail feathers
having a very conspicuous white spot near the end of each feather,
this is very noticable when the tail is fanned. The beak is not nearly
as large as that of the other bird, neither is it so dark. The legs are
a very striking light pink or pale flesh colour. This bird moves about
with rapid jerky and almost automatic movements, all the time
swaying the body from side to side and fanning the tail. It seems more
at home in the thicker vegetation than the Everett&apos;s and, unlike
that bird, it quickly mounts the upright stems almost like a
Tree-creeper.
The tongues of the Spider-hunters are exceedingly long and delicate
and can be projected a long way past the end of the beak. These
are well adapted for licking up the minute insects from the long
tubular flowers and from the bases of the leaves of the huge tropical
plants such as bananas, upon which the birds feed. The tongue
resembles a long, almost transparent horse hair. While the Grey-
breasted species never inserts its beak into the liquid but projects
the slender tongue about an inch from the beak and sucks up the food
from the rim of the vessel, never getting any on the beak or plumage
which it keeps in spotless condition, the other bird inserts almost the
whole of the huge beak into the syrup, subsequently shaking the drops
off all over the foliage and incidently its own plumage.

Both birds, though very dissimilar in appearance and demeanour,
are absolutely tame and will readily jump onto one's hand to reach
the food pot or will fly out of the aviary to meet one in the morning.
The larger one will also allow itself to be picked up by the hand.
By what one gathers of the wild life of these birds, the huge beaks
must be of the greatest use in probing between the bases of large
leaves, where the beaks of small birds would be of no practical use.
The notes on the wild life of these birds are very meagre, but we
are told in The Birds of the Malay Peninsula, by the late H. C. Robinson,
speaking of another species, that "It is an inhabitant of the gullies
and damp places overgrown with bananas and other large leaved
plants and is very active and constant in motion, searching the leaves
and flowers for grubs and insects. The flight is swift and powerful,
though the bird is never on the wing for any distance. The male,
though it has no pectoral tufts, displays in much the same manner
as the other species, maintaining itself almost vertically in the air,
as it was on its tail and flufling out the loose plumage of the flanks
Of another species we are told, " Its favourite situations are the
gullies and the banks of small streams and places where huge trees
have fallen down and permitted the growth of wild bananas, tall
gingers and other broad-leaved plants amongst which the Spider-
hunter finds its food, which is principally flies, spiders, and small beetles.
It is particularly fond of hunting upon the pear-shaped inflorescence
of bananas, which are always full of insects of various kinds, and is
generally seen in pairs often running up the midribs of the larger
leaves almost like a Creeper or Nuthatch.
Of the nesting habits of these birds, we are told that the nests
" are more or less purse-shaped structures composed of skeleton
leaves bound together with fibres and cobwebs and attached to the
under surface of a large leaf, usually that of a banana
The notes of the birds are very much like the scolding notes of
a Sunbird and the Everett's Spider-hunter if it has been unduly
disturbed will continue to utter this irritating sound for an hour or
more afterwards. The two birds lived together in a small aviary with
a growing privet-tree in, but the larger bird so bullied the smaller
that it had to be removed in order to save its life.

The First Importation of the Hoatzin
The Borea Grey-breasted Spider-hunter, which is very closely
allied to the Malayan Grey-breast bird, is found in most of the lowlands
of Borneo, but the Everett's is, I believe, confined to the regions around
Mt. Dunlit in the same country. The former bird has been brought
here twice before, but the latter bird is the only one of its species to
reach this country.

The successful importation by Mr. 0. S. Webb of living examples
of the Hoatzin is an event of outstanding interest and importance,
for in addition to the fact that this is the first time this remarkable
bird has been imported alive the bird is in itself perhaps the most
important bird in the world from the zoological point of view, for it
is the bird of all others that appears to have changed little from the
time, in past ages, when birds and reptiles were but recently separated.
Structurally, the Hoatzin is very distinct from all other birds, its
chief peculiarity being noted in the formation of the sternum, the
fore part of which is cut away to make room for an enormous crop
which is necessitated by its habit of feeding entirely upon leaves.
The Hoatzin reminds one somewhat in its shape of a Touraco,
though the toes are not zygodactyle as in that group, but arranged
in the ordinary way of three in front and one behind. It has a very
strong. beak and the eyes, surrounded - by a patch of bare skin, are
protected by bristly lashes. The colour of the body is olive brown,
the wings being barred with bullish white and the tail tipped with
huffish yellow.
Beebe's description of the Hoatzin is worth quoting. He writes:
" The flight of the Hoatzin resembles that of an over-fed hen. The
Hoatzin's voice is no more melodious than the cry of a peacock and
less sonorous than an alligator's roar. The bird's grace is batrachian
rather than avian, while the odour of its body resembles that of no
bird untouched by dissolution. Still, zoologically considered, the

Hoatzin is probably the most remarkable and interesting bird living
on the earth to-day.
" It has successfully defied time and space. For it, the dial of the
ages has moved more slowly than for the rest of organic life, and
although living and breathing with us to-day, yet its world is an
affair of two dimensions--a line of thorny saplings threaded along
the muddy banks of a few tropical waters/'
The Hoatzin exists to-day along the banks of certain rivers in
central and tropical South America, and it feeds upon the leaves of
aquatic plants and shrubs such as the Muckamucka and Pimpler,
the latter being a bush which bears numerous sharp thorns on its stems
rendering it impenetrable. The nest is always built over the water,
and the young bird is provided with two sharp functional claws on
each wing, one on the index and the other on the pollex. He knows
well how to preserve his life should danger threaten him. He simply
takes a header into the deep water beneath, where he swims with the
agility of an aquatic reptile, ascending to the surface where some weed
or floating debris will hide his head, his body remaining submerged
until all danger is past when, by the aid of his claw-furnished wings,
he is able to climb slowly but surely up the branches until he reaches
the nest from which he come, though this may be as much as fifteen
feet from the water.

Although in the past the Adelaide Zoological Gardens has succeeded
in breeding many interesting species of birds (amongst them the
Malice Fowl and Native Companion Crane) no special efforts in this
direction have been made for some years until last summer. The
results as recorded below will, I hope, be of some interest to members.
The Coreopsis Geese (Cereopsis novce-hollandice) have bred with us
regularly for years. They are early starters as the eggs are laid during

mid-winter. Two pairs nested, but only one pair laid ; four young
being successfully reared from a clutch of five eggs. These birds
subsist almost entirely on green food, and the diet of the young birds
consists merely of the grass which they find as they wander about
the Gardens.
A pair of Swainson's Lorikeets (Trichoglossus novce-hollandice),
which share an aviary with several others of their kind, went to nest
in early August and the hen laid two eggs in a log only about 14 inches
long and 7 inches in diameter with a small entrance hole at one
end. After about twenty-six days one egg hatched, and the young
bird left the nest on the fifty-seventh day. It was noticed that about
the twenty-seventh day the feathers on the wing just begin to show
their green colouring and the breast quills appear orange with the
green tip. Except for its less brilliant colouring the young bird
resembles its parents, but the beak is blackish while the eye is entirely
dark. Both the upper and lower eyelids are much lighter than those
of the adult, and in the youngster appear almost to form a white ring
round the eye. The diet of the Lorikeets here consists of milk sop,
together with soft fruits such as pears, grapes, and peaches.
In an aviary occupied by three pairs of Alexandrine Parrakeets
(Psittacula nipalensis) two pairs went to nest and laid three eggs each.
The first pair hatched one egg, but the young bird lived only a few
days. The second pair were more successful, however, for all three
eggs were hatched and the young reared. Although other seeds were
offered, the young were fed almost entirely on sunflower seed plus
apple and seeding grass.
In a large dome-shaped aviary 45 feet high and 35 feet in diameter,
occupied mainly by members of the Platycercus family, a pair of Indian
Ringnecks (Psittacula torquata ) laid three eggs in an upright log. Two
young were hatched and safely reared. For a wonder no ill-feeling
was shown towards them by the Broad-tails, but a great deal of interest
was manifest, for both during the period of incubation and after the
eggs had hatched, it was no uncommon sight to see a Rosella or a
Pennant poking his head into the log to see how things were going.
In a series of aviaries erected specially for breeding the rare
Australian Parrakeets, a pair of Elegant Grass Parrakeets (Neojphema

elegans) laid four eggs in October, all of which were hatched and
reared.
A pair of Turquoisine Grass Parrakeets ( Neophema &apos;pulchella) laid
four eggs in their first clutch, and hatched two young ; one cock and
one hen. In the second brood only one cock was produced. The
small number reared by this pair is probably due to the fact that the
hen herself was only hatched the season before.
A pair of Hooded Parrakeets ( Psephotellus dissimilis) were acquired
during the season, and because it would have disturbed the birds in
the neighbouring cages, a mound was not erected for them to nest in.
The pair, however, soon got to business, and four eggs were laid in
a log. The hen proved to be a very " flightie " individual, and came
off the eggs at the slightest disturbance. After a time the eggs were
removed and proved to be addled. Three weeks later she began
again, and laid one egg on 10th November, and the next on the 12th,
and so on up to the 18th, when the fifth and last egg appeared. But
this also was a failure. During the first week in April five more eggs
were laid, four of which were removed and placed under a foster-
mother who later deserted them. The hen Hooded, evidently thinking
it a waste of time to try to incubate only one egg, immediately set to
work and laid three more, bringing her total up to seventeen for the
season ! At this stage it was decided to give the pair ample food and
water, and only go near the cage every third day in order not to
disturb the hen. This is one of the rare cases where neglect, or at
any rate, semi-neglect, has met with success, for there are now young
in the log two or three days old.
Of the Finches I will only mention the Chestnut-breasted Finches
(Donacola castaneithorax), which laid five eggs in a nest which they
constructed in some brushwood about 2 feet from the ground. Three
young were hatched on the thirteenth day of incubation, and they
eventually left the nest on the twenty-second day, but returned therein
for several nights to roost. The parents are now building again in a box.
Several species of Pigeons were reared, including three Nicobars
(Caloenas nicobarica) from two breeding pairs.
Naturally there were many disappointments. One of our pairs
of Bourke's Parrakeets were seen to mate, and the cock fed the hen

for several weeks, but they did not lay, probably owing to the fact
that they had only recently been trapped in Central Australia. A great
disappointment was the mysterious disappearance of a clutch of Red
and Blue Macaws (Ara chloroptera ), which vanished when five days
old. We suspect cannibalism on the part of the cock, so next season
he will be separated when his mate begins to sit. I can find no record
of this species having been bred in captivity although it has hybridized
with the Military Macaw. We should be very grateful if someone
could enlighten us as to whether it actually has been bred.
THE BIRDS AT PAIGNTON ZOO
By Dr. E. Hopkinson, C.M.G., D.S.O.
With each succeeding visit to Mr. Whitley's collection at Paignton
one comes away more and more impressed with its magnitude or,
rather, magnificence, with the marvellous condition of its inhabitants,
and with the number of species (and hybrids) which are bred there,
in many cases regularly.
I have on previous occasions attempted to describe the collection,
but such attempts have been hardly more than impressions and can
at the best have given but a poor idea of the whole. A recent longer
visit fired me with the desire to improve on this, and give as full as
possible an account of all there is to be seen in the bird line. This could
only be done by going round the whole collection and listing the
inhabitants of each house or aviary in turn--no mean undertaking, as
the numbers of these are large and they themselves really call for proper
descriptions--but that must wait another hand. Before going further
I should say that the Zoo is situated about a mile north of Paignton
front, and is open to the public at a charge of a shilling plus tax, as
required by law nowadays. Birds are, I suppose, its speciality, but it
also contains most of the ordinary Zoo inhabitants, from lions to
Waxbills, while part is devoted to domestic breeds--Pigeons (nearly
every known variety, I should think), Bantams, rabbits, and guinea-
pigs. A notable feature is the very excellent labelling, and there is
as well an illustrated guide to the whole domain, which planted with

beautiful shrubs and other plants, all labelled and easily identifiable, is
indeed a marvellous place.
Taking the collection thus, house by house, is really the only way
of getting at what it actually contains, and even this would have been
impossible without the assistance of the owner, who came with me nearly
everywhere, and ensured my seeing, or, at least, having every chance
of seeing, everything, even in the thickest and largest enclosures ;
but for this assistance, I could not even have named many of the
inhabitants, so many are the rarities. I only wish I could pass on even
half the information about every one of them which is in their owner's
head and also at his finger-ends, but that is beyond me, though what
little I can remember I have tried to incorporate here, indicating such
by inverted commas, thus tapping in a feeble way a minute portion of
the volume of valuable data about birds which Mr. Whitley (and he
alone) can supply.
I will now ask my readers to imagine that they are accompanying
us on our round, which took a week and which began with the collections
at the house and the newer aviaries which have been built or are being
built at the Zoo, but which are not yet open to the public. These vary
in design, but all the newer ones are intended to meet the special
requirements for successful breeding and at the same time give the
best possible view to visitors ; this difficult combination has been
attained in a wonderful way. Here I must mention that the names I
give for the various aviaries are my own, given to make my descriptions
clearer and easily followed, for few of them as yet have official names,
and merely numbering each seemed an inadequate way of
describing them.
(1) The Greenhouses at the House
These are a long range of houses, in some of which a few choice
Parrots live among all sorts of tropical plants, fish, and reptiles, the
last including two sizeable alligators and a tropical turtle, which was
found some years ago by a young lady, I believe, on the Paignton
beach, and which has lived here ever since in a tub of salt water about
its own size, changed every week, and in the course of the years grown
considerably. Besides all these I think there are a few odd mammals,

i
for a couple of Loris live loose in the first house and I think there is |
a Galago in another ; but here, as with the rest of the collection, I
must keep strictly to the birds, if I can ever hope to finish.
The first of these we come to is a Brown-necked Parrot (Poicephalus \
fuscicollis) , which has been here about five years. This species I knew ;
well when in the Gambia, and this particular individual is one of those j
which has lived long enough to disprove my belief that the red head
was a sign of youth, for it still has the whole crown red, a bright red
with a tinge of pink. Mr. Whitley feels certain that this " is a sex
difference and is a female distinction which makes her a more brightly !
coloured bird than the male, as is the case with other members of this
genus ". Next come two large wall-cages (about 4 by 4 by 5 feet),
each containing a Hawk-headed Parrot in perfect condition, but in
future I shall omit such descriptions, for nearly all the birds would merit
such, so that perfect condition or words to that effect is to be understood
for every bird except where otherwise noted. In the next division of
the house are five more similar wall-cages, holding respectively an
Eclectus cock, two Dusky Pionus, two Green Pionus ( menstruus and
flavirostris), two Tanygnatlius (" ? lucionensis, though not typical, as
they lack the blue patch on the head and also look larger ") ; the last
cage contains a pair of Great-billed Parrakeets, T. megalorhynchus,
and an ordinary Parrot-cage houses a pair of Eed-faced Lovebirds,
the cock not all he should be in his owner's eyes, but looking fit enough
to ordinary ones. The last bird-containing division contains a hen
Meyer's Parrot and two rare Conures, rhodogaster and leucotis, each
housed singly.
Beyond the greenhouses are two old aviaries which each contain
a pair of Macaws, Hyacinthine and Lear's, paired for breeding, and just
outside the house-door just now are three nestling Black-headed Gulls,
which were hatched and are being reared by a Bantam hen, their food,
however, being supplied at short intervals by their owner all day and
for much of the night; the eggs came by rail from Lancashire, and
all hatched, and the rate at which the young are growing is astonishing.

any books on these subjects that they do not require further, our
New Zealand friends would be most glad of them, and would be glad
to purchase some of the better type of such books.
Mr. Webb's collection from British Guiana, though a small one,
contains some very choice birds. On another page mention has been
made of the Hoatzin, of which two specimens arrived alive though one
soon died; but in addition to these there are three Humming Birds,
namely, the Wood Nymph (Thalurania fissilis), Lesson's Emerald
(Agyrtria fimbriata), and the Sabre-wing (Campylopterus largijpennis).
The Wood Nymph is the smallest and at the same time the most
beautiful, its general metallic green dress being relieved by a violet-
blue collar.
Mr. Webb has fed these Hummers entirely on a mixture of equal
parts of Horlick's malted milk and Mellin's food, with about five parts
of water, and they, or at any rate the two smaller ones, are in most
excellent plumage arid condition.

Avicultural Notes
There is one example of the Cock-of-the-rock (Rupicola crocea), j
that wonderful orange-coloured bird that everyone has heard of but
many have not seen alive. It was in 1910 that several examples, !
presented by the late Sir William Ingram, Bart., were exhibited in
the old Small Bird House at the Zoological Gardens, and in The
Avicultural Magazine for September of that year their collector,
Mr. W. Frost, published an article describing in detail the habits of
these birds in the wild state.
The old Tortoise House at the Zoo, which has for some time been
known as the Tropical House, though it has contained nothing more
exciting than a young rhinoceros, is now being transformed into a
real Tropical House. One side of it will be for birds, and should
represent a real bit of a tropical forest. In it, disporting themselves
amongst the foliage and on the ground, will be Sugar-birds, Tanagers,
Pittas, and such other birds as may be found to thrive in the hot,
moist atmosphere.
I should like to remind members that at this time of year copy
for the Magazine is apt to be scarce. Aviculturists are too busy to write,
and wait until the autumn and winter before recording their successes--
or failures--during the summer. But as the Magazine has to be kept
going throughout the entire year, I should be glad if members would
let me have any notes that may be of interest.
Dr. Hopkinson tells me that Mr. Whitley has at present in his
" Zoo " at Paignton 134 different species of Parrots and about ten
different hybrids (six Broadtails, etc., four Lovebirds).
The total Parrot population comes to about 270 head, without
counting dozens or scores of Budgerigars and Lovebirds, and to this
must be added the hybrids, i.e. about a dozen Parrakeets and dozens
of Lovebirds.

Last May Mr. C. S. Webb brought over a very interesting collection
of birds from Portuguese East Africa, and, as usual, in absolutely
perfect condition. Among them he had two of the very beautiful
Natal Kingfisher, of which we have a coloured drawing in this Magazine.
It is only 4J inches in length, of which the bill occupies fully
1 inch. Of course, I fell in love with these, and brought them home.
They were fed on tiny pieces of meat and mealworms, and it was
delightful to see them darting at the latter from their perches.
A bath they loved more than anything, and I had to remove the
water from their cages in the afternoons, as I was afraid of their
overdoing it and catching a chill. They made most perfect pets, and
I kept them for several months, but unfortunately lost them in the
autumn, when I was away and they were not correctly fed. This
bird is but a local race of the Senegal Pigmy Kingfisher (Ispidina
p. picta), from which it differs mainly in its stouter bill, by the plumage,
and the presence of a blue spot behind the ear. It is found from
Tanganyika to Natal, while the Senegalese form inhabits the rest of

tropical Africa, and has never been imported alive. This Pigmy
Kingfisher is not confined to rivers and streams, as many members of
its family are, but is often found in thick woods and bush, sometimes
far from water. It perches on trees, rushes, and also telegraph wires.
It is purely insectivorous, darting at its prey from its perches. It
never seems to dive for fish.
It is said to nest in holes in the earth, these sometimes being formed
in the sides of the burrows of the Ant Bear (Orycteropus).

By J. E. Sweetnam (Vicar of Taunton)
Only an editorial comment in last month's issue insinuating that
even the demigods who habitually contribute to this learned periodical
are subject to trials and failures, even as ordinary mortals, has
emboldened me to suggest the inclusion of an article under such a
heading.
Furthermore, when reading of Hoatzins, Turacos, and such-like
rarities, which neither time, space, or pocket allow us to possess, one
wonders if there may not be other impecunious lovers of the feathered
tribe who would appreciate an occasional article better adapted to the
narrowness of our brows !
Should the editorial cupboard be so bare at this holiday season
that he is reduced to printing these jottings, they will certainly not
offend in that direction, since the writer's aviaries--if two disused
rooms with small outside flights, and a converted outhouse with a
15 X 5 ft. flight, can be dignified by such a title--contain nothing rarer
than Cuban Finches and Australian Hard-bills.
From the latter source arose one of the many trials that beset
me in the first year of my novitiate : when nest after nest was either
pilfered or so disturbed that their rightful owners abandoned it in
disgust, by a pair of those innocent-looking Long-tailed Grass Finches--

who, as they sit chattering with their heads together, remind one of
a pair of parish gossips discussing the latest scandal, and seem to
have a like propensity for interfering with the domestic arrangements
of others.
Perhaps this particular pair were not without some excuse, since
their owner was himself guilty of a reprehensible curiosity in regard
to nests which not even Cutthroats could endure without protest.
But, apart from these busybodies, nearly sixty birds of forty different
species crowded into the space mentioned afforded abundant reason
for the trials and failures of one who is now a sadder and a wiser man.
I believe Diamond Doves are regarded as practically fool-proof,
but even they were not proof against me, though, in this one instance,
at any rate, I contend the boot was on the other foot. For crass
stupidity commend me to this species. My first pair almost ended my
avicultural career, so distressed was I at their untimely end.
They lived for two days in a strange aviary in apparent contentment
and then, poor things, perished under similar conditions to the Ancient
Mariner, although surrounded on all hands by an abundance of food
and water.
Apparently they make no effort to protect their nests. My second
pair lost two sittings to the parish gossips, and, when relegated to a
small separate flight, refused to build at all, even though I was building
on them to help pay my seed bill !
Has any reader sunk so low as British hybrids ? If not, they will
be well advised to preserve their integrity for, except one resorts to the
crude method of caging the pairs, it is an exasperating businsss. If
successful in avoiding a messaliance with such Mormons as the Yellow-
rumped Serin or the Singing Finch, some other house-hunter is always
liable to come along and " upset the apple-cart " whilst the hen,
finding herself in the position of a married widow, with paternal as
well as maternal duties thrust upon her, is off in search of food and
exercise. I believe Canaries are recommended under such circum-
stances, but one can no more expect a Canary to understand the
upbringing of a brood of Bramblefinch X Chaffinches than a theological
college to turn out assistant curates qualified to look after an aviary
when their Vicar's absence places them in the position of the Curate-

208 J. C. Laidlay--Notes from the Lindores Collection
in-Charge ! And thereby hangs another tale of woe, too harrowing
to record !
When there has been evolved a species of Silverbill or Zebra Finch
immune from egg-binding, a Cutthroat that does not take its moral
tone from the natives of its own habitat, and expose its unwanted
progeny (mine apparently wanted none !), a sharp-tailed Finch that
will condescend to incubate, or a Golden Sparrow that does not attempt
to poise its eggs on a convex nest, I think I may become a successful
aviculturist.
In moments of extreme depression I have contemplated abandoning
all self-respect and keeping Canaries, but never abandoning a pursuit
fraught with so many trials and so much pleasure. For surely the
plutocratic possessors of miniature zoos can derive nothing like the
same pleasure therefrom as some of us from our glorified cages.
It is unfortunate that even the records of the Avicultural
Magazine do not cover that period, for if, as is probable, the science
of aviculture was practised in the time of Job, he apparently possessed
the requisite qualifications for success.

The Editor asks for copy, and yet owns that aviculturists are too
busy to write. Too true. Seven a.m. to 11 p.m. every day for months
on end is busy. Then, this June, in the first two weeks, six inches of
rain fell, over 600 young ones to tend to, most of which are sun-
worshippers, and certainly we are busy. Most of the young being
reared are the same we rear every year, so there is little of real interest
to record. However, we have tried some new feeding methods which
may be of interest to others. Firstly, we have added a portion of
duckweed, about a tenth part to the young Eiders'ration, which I think
undoubtedly has improved their general health, and with Common
Partridges we have cut down their meals, and very small ones at
that, to three times a day. I think more Partridges are killed by

overfeeding than any other cause. We have one pen of White Pheasants.
The hens here were bred four generations pure white, and are very
inbred, so we got a new cock in that was bought as a pure white, but
has some red on the breast, some twenty young ones were hatched,
and three are marked like Melanistic, which makes one wonder whether
the old saying that white and black are the same may apply here ?
Certainly I do not think Versicolour are responsible in any way for the
Melanistic. To go back to the Ducks, as usual Mandarins and Wigeon
have proved the easiest two varieties to rear, and Common Wild
Duck one of the hardest. Carolina we have kept much longer off the
water than in past years--result, broods now well on and averaging
nines ; seven pairs of Mandarins produced fifty-six young now mostly
feathering ; this pen always does best, I think owing to the pond being
spring-fed and never freezing. Fertility is always better. Mandarin
are very stay-at-home birds if bred on the spot, though wild-caught
birds always leave, which made me very interested in the experiment
of those released in London, which I thought at the time was rather
asking for trouble. Here with rather large pens, about six acres each,
and a lot of rank cover, we occasionally lose nests, with the result some
young get reared by the Duck themselves, and grow up to prove a
veritable curse, because they simply won't leave, and having full-winged
birds about means inbreeding, and they have to be shot. At various
times we have had Carolina, Mandarin, Garganey, Shoveller, Common
Teal, Common Wigeon, Pintail, and Gadwall; thus full-winged if males,
they get to know every pen, however far apart, and visit them all in
turn, causing lots of fighting and general trouble. Hybrids, I am
pleased to say, this season have only occurred in two cases, one brood
of ten Chestnut Breasted Teal x Falcated. This rather a pretty cross,
and a single Red-crested Pochard X Rosy-billed Pochard. Disease
and illness so far we have been free of, and I think that owing to taking
the young away sooner from the bantams has helped. Crowding into a
coop which, however often it is moved, must become dirty, cannot
be good. After leaving the bantams, we are putting the broods into a
small house holding about fifty at a time, then from that into the
open ponds with no protection or shelter.
Another point worth recording is that we have carefully watched

several species of birds when left to sit, and noticed that many rarely
left the nest. Wild Turkeys sat for twenty-six days, and only came
off once ; Grey leg we never saw off ; Falcated, weeds grew all over a
sitting bird, and so on. So we have tried when taking the Bantams off
the sitting boxes to keep the eggs as warm as possible, and put back
the Bantams whenever they have fed.

The Pittas are a strange but very homogeneous group of birds?
with no near allies, which inhabit the hot tropical regions of the Old
World, mainly the East Indies, the Malay Peninsula, and the South
Sea Islands. They inhabit for the main part the dense hot humid
tropical jungles and forests (though I believe a few are found at fairly
high altitudes on mountains), usually in the vicinity of water, and they
are seldom seen by any except the naturalist, who wanders into their
home, or the sharp-eyed natives.
They frequent the undergrowth, living principally on the ground,
where they find all their food, various insects, spiders, and ants, etc.,
which they procure by turning over the leaves and mould in very
much the same manner as Thrushes or Blackbirds.
In spite of a very fine monograph being written on these birds,
not a great deal is known about their wild life.
Many Pittas are migratory, which seems to me rather an extra-
ordinary thing, for they are usually the denizens of the hottest and
the most tropical countries of the world. One would think that it
would not be necessary for them to move about, always having a
constant supply of insect food near at hand, but as they do not traverse
large stretches of ocean or land-masses, but simply move leisurely
north or south, it may be some remote migratory instinct which is
dying out, and which was necessary when climatic conditions were
different from those of to-day.

The distribution of the Pittas is very extraordinary, and is one
of the greatest puzzles to ornithologists, and one to which there is no
satisfactory explanation. Many very closely allied birds, and often
birds of the same species, live in countries very remote from each
other, but in Borneo, for example, many very distantly related birds
live in very close proximity. Borneo seems to be the headquarters of
the Pitta family, and boasts of nine very distinct species which are
certainly amongst the most brilliant birds in the world. Java possesses
only one species, the lovely Blue-tailed Pitta mentioned later on in
this article. One species is found in Japan, and another in Borneo,
another which is closely related to the well-known Bengal Pitta is
found in Central Africa, a region many thousands of miles from its
nearest ally, and with great land masses intervening in which no Pitta
could exist. One is found in restricted parts of China, and again in
Formosa. Two very distinct species are also found in Northern
Australia. A great many of the islands which lie north-east and east
of New Guinea are inhabited by one or more very distinct species of
these birds.
The most extraordinary of all, the Giant Pitta (Pitta maxima),
a very brilliant bird, almost the size of a Partridge, inhabits the little-
known island of Halmarheira, where unlike the rest of the family it
lives amongst the crags and stones of the mountains. Nearly all the
family, except a very few, are arrayed in the most brilliant of colours,
most species having in their plumage patches of brilliant sky-blue
feathers of a peculiar wax-like and almost luminous appearance.
These feathers usually form either the tail or wing coverts. Green,
black, blue, white, and yellow, usually in combination with the most
vivid scarlet, are the main colours, and these are always pure and
clear, and never shade from one to another.
In shape the Pittas resemble somewhat rather large and rotund
Thrushes, with very long legs and very short tails, which are usually
hidden when the wings are folded, making the bird look as though
it had no tail at all. In some species the tiny tail is kept in constant
motion, being wagged up and down with great rapidity.
Before much was known of these birds they were known to
ornithologists as " Ant-thrushes

Sydney Porter--Notes on various Bare Pittas
Pittas have never been very common cage birds in this country,
or anywhere else for that matter. Perhaps one reason is that they
are difficult to procure, and again that they are still more difficult to
keep by people who do not know how to attend to their wants, and it
is with the object of throwing a little light on the management of these
lovely birds that I offer this short chapter to the readers of The
Avicultural Magazine.
The Bengal Pitta (Pitta brachyura) is the most commonly imported,
and may be picked up at a fairly reasonable price from time to time,
when a consignment of Indian birds arrives in this country ; but the
rarer birds are usually only brought to England after a private
expedition has been out to the East. Most if not nearly all the rarer
Pittas landed here have been brought from the Far East through the
agency of either Mr. Frost or Mr. Goodfellow.
Pittas have always been my favourites, for they combine many
characteristics which make them delightful aviary birds, though at
the same time they have many drawbacks. In regard to their attributes,
they are pleasing in shape and colour ; they usually get extraordinarily
tame, and display unusual intelligence, and if properly looked after
will live for many years.
Against this we find, as mentioned above, that with the exception
of the Bengal Pitta, these birds rarely come into the market, and are
consequently very expensive to buy. They cannot under any circum-
stances be kept together; even male and female of the same species
have to be kept in separate aviaries. In fact, one pair of newly imported
birds which I received were put into a small aviary, but as soon as
the door was closed the cock began so to bully the hen that had I left
them there the hen would have been dead in an hour or so. I know
of no birds more pugnacious towards each other.
Pittas have no song, and if one wants to keep them in good condition
they need unremitting attention. They are also unsuitable for cage
life owing to the great rapidity with which they move. Their move-
ments may look comparatively leisurely, but in reality they are
extremely rapid, and the birds can cover a great space in a very short
time with their great bounding hops.
In the first place, a well-lighted indoor aviary is necessary where

the temperature is kept between 60 F. and 70 F., and as the birds
live mainly on the floor, they can be kept with impunity with any other
small birds; in fact, I find that they will not harm the smallest Waxbill.
The feet of these birds often go wrong, which is not to be wondered
at when we think that they have always been used to standing on the
damp steamy loam of their native forests, and then when they arrive
in this country they are usually placed on hard dry sand. It is necessary
to have large shallow trays made of zinc. The ones I use are about
three or four feet long, by two or three feet wide, and two or three
inches deep, and are filled with damp leaf-mould which is changed every
week. The mould requires damping every so often by watering it with
a can with a fine rose. Several large stones and pieces of rotten tree
trunk should be placed about, for unless these are given the beak and
feet are liable to get overgrown. Also a shallow pan of water is needed,
for nearly all the Pittas are semi-aquatic, and I have seen them stand
for hours in the water, apparently just bathing their feet. Professor
Newton, in his work, A Dictionary of Birds , disputes the right to call
these birds "Water-thrushes", and says: " There is no evidence of their
having aquatic habits," but I think there is, judging by the few wild
birds I have seen, which were always in the vicinity of rivers and
streams, and the ones I have had in captivity ; for besides standing
for long periods in water and catching small fish, etc., I have noticed
that the Blue-tailed Pitta will play with the water. If any of my very
tame birds hear the trickling of water they will come up and investigate.
Pittas require a rich insectivorous food, moistened with finely
grated carrot, and mixed with chopped hard-boiled egg. They also
require plenty of live food, such as live ant eggs, a few gentles, and
mealworms, but not too many of these latter, as they are rather over-
heating. I find that the coming in of live wasp-grub just coincides
with the moult of the birds, and they prove most useful in retaining
the brilliant scarlet under-parts of the plumage, which fade unless the
birds get the right kind of live-food.
All this may sound a lot of trouble, but it really is not when one
gets used to it, and unless one is prepared to do this for the birds, I
think that it is wrong to attempt to try and keep them.

perches, the birds soon go wrong. Their feet get into a terrible state,
so bad that the poor things cannot walk ; the brilliant colours fade,
and soon the birds are no more. I have even seen birds in public
collections in this state, and the sight of the poor pathetic creatures
trying to hobble along with feet swollen as large as marbles, has made
my heart bleed for them.
Given good conditions and care there is no more charming bird
than a Pitta. Intelligent and tame to a degree, unique in shape and
colouring, few birds give more joy to their owner than one of these
birds in good condition.
When frightened or trying to intimidate another birds, a Pitta
will crouch down on its long legs and wave its extraordinarily beautiful
butterfly-like wings, which are usually striped, and marked with pale
blue, black and white. It is said that the birds will do this in their
native forests to frighten away other creatures. They would certainly
look very startling in the gloom of their forest home.
If a bird is rather wild when freshly imported, it will be found
rather an advantage to fasten sheets of glass about a foot high all
round the sides of the aviary if it is a small one, then the bird cannot
knock its head on the wires. Otherwise nervous birds are rather apt
to make a mess of themselves.
I have one bird now which is so tame that it will readily jump
on to my knee for a mealworm. Pittas are usually very wild when
freshly imported, but if care is taken and kindness shown, they will
soon lose their fear and settle down, becoming remarkably tame and
confiding.
As a rule, Pittas are the most silent of birds, and one will often
have a bird for years and never hear it utter a sound, though some will
at times utter a soft low whistle. The Green-breasted Pitta will,
upon rare occasions, make a sound exactly like the short snappy bark
of a Pekinese dog. At first I refused to believe that it was made by
the bird, but afterwards I both saw and heard it call. This call is
remarkably unbirdlike, and is usually uttered when the bird sees
another Pitta for the first time.
Most of the Pittas seem to moult about August to October, and the
moult is accomplished in a very short space of time, the feathers

seeming to drop out in large quantities. It is then very essential to
give large quantities of live food. If well looked after, the plumage
of these birds will assume a lustre and gloss seldom seen in any
other bird.
I have not been able to study the lives of any of the Pittas of the
Far East in a state of freedom, but I have been able to see something
of the home life of at least one rare species, namely the Angolian Pitta
{Pitta angolensis), a bird which I think few Europeans have seen much
of in its forest home.
The first time I saw this bird was in a small tropical wood where
a stream ran into a river. Everywhere was rank tropical vegetation,
the place was damp and humid, and the trees were so thick that the
sunlight never penetrated below. All at once I was startled by a vision
of the most brilliantly coloured bird I had ever seen flying across my
path. Seen on the wing, no bird appears more brilliant than a Pitta,
most of the colours which are ordinarily hidden being brought into
view, but on the ground or in a tree it is very difficult to detect, for
many of them have green backs.
The Green-breasted Pitta ( Pitta cucullatus). Many years ago,
when wandering around a well-known bird store, I came across a
cage with a very miserable and dejected occupant. It was a Pitta
of some sort, but of what species no one could tell, for the simple
reason that it was minus nearly all its feathers. It had been in its tiny
prison for many months, for when it first arrived the price asked was
too high, and it was passed by until, after being kept in the cage where
its head rubbed against the top and there was no room to open its
wings, it had become the pitiable object that I found it. But in spite
of its condition it had large and intelligent eyes.
To prove its tameness, it was taken out of the cage and put on the
floor, but it could not fly, because it had not wing or tail feathers !
After some bargaining " Lily Long ", as she afterwards came to be
called, became my property, but whatever price had been asked I
would have bought her, even though it meant going without a new
winter overcoat !
Visitors to my birdroom said as they watched her hop with those
huge hops only known to the Pitta tribe, " What is that awful

creature ? ", or " Whatever did you buy that thing for? but in a
few months' time they had forgotten the poor little " scarecrow ", and
when they saw " Lily Long " again, they failed to recognize her after
she had assumed her new garb, and said, " What a beautiful creature,
wherever did that come from ? ", for the moult came quickly and at
a time when we could get plenty of wasp-grub upon which our little
friend lived. She (we call it " she " but we do not know to this day
whether it is a male or a female, for it is impossible to tell the sex of
most of Pittas by outward appearance), became a vision of beauty.
Not only that, but the bird became tamer and more intelligent than
any other bird I ever possessed. And now each succeeding year she
seems to become more beautiful, the feathers more wax-like and
sleek, the crimson more intense, and the beautiful pale blue feathers
of the back and wings appear almost luminous.
She is always friendly, though somewhat shy of strangers. I have
only to call and she is at my feet or on my knee with the stumpy tail
bobbing up and down a hundred to the dozen.
The flight of this bird is remarkably silent and butterfly-like, and
the beautifully marked wings then show up to their full advantage.
In a state of freedom Pittas seldom fly about much except when
migrating and, as though knowing what conspicuous objects they
are in flight, they usually migrate at night. In its native haunts a
Pitta only has to take a few hops and it is quickly out of sight in the
dense undergrowth.
That this Pitta is semi-aquatic I have no doubt, for while it spends
a great deal of the day in standing in water, it will catch small fish
and gets excited as soon as it hears running water. In a small aviary
with other birds I find this bird perfectly harmless, but it is always
endeavouring to reach other Pittas in adjoining aviaries.
Practically nothing is recorded of the wild life of this bird.
Robinson tells us in his Birds of the Malay Peninsula of the wild life
of a closely related bird, the Lesser Blue-winged Pitta (Pitta moluccensis).
" Vast flocks arrive from the north travelling down the Straits of
Malacca on the west coast, and crossing the Gulf of Siam on the east.
These migrants are found for a short time among the mangroves and
on the small islands, and then seem to disperse inland to the low-

country forest, jungle, and scrub. They do not, however, ascend
the hills, but frequent by preference the patches of forest, or even
garden land in the neighbourhood of rice-fields. The diet is insectivorous,
especially ants, but large snails are also eaten, and I am inclined to
think that the huge accumulations of shells often at the bases of lime-
stone cliffs, all with the apex broken in, are in part due to this bird
which has the habit of selecting a particular rock for cracking the
snail shell.
" In captivity the birds will live on boiled rice, plantains, and
cockroaches, but they do not as a rule survive long, and are very wild,
injuring themselves against the bars of their cage.
" They are not particularly shy, but run with great rapidity with
their tails cocked up. In Tenasserin, Davison states that they perch
much on trees and are very noisy birds, with a fine clear double note.
In the migration season it is often heard late at night, but in Malaya
the birds seem to keep mainly to the ground."
With reference to the Green-breasted Pitta, he tells us that its
habits are " exactly those of P. moluccensis with which it occurs,
though a larger number seem to stay with us, possibly throughout the
year. The bird frequents deeper forest, and is not seen so often near
the villages, nor is it quite so common as its congener."
The Green-breasted Pitta has a rather wide distribution for a Pitta,
being found in certain parts of Eastern Bengal, Assam, Nepal, and the
Malay Peninsula.
The Annamese or Saigon Pitta (Pitta soror). This is a very extra-
ordinary bird, differing from most of the other Pittas which are usually
arrayed in the most brilliant of colours, in having all the colours of the
softest pastel shades, shading softly from one another; in fact, the
colours are very difficult to describe owing to their softness and shading,
but the chief colour of this bird is a very peculiar pinkish fawn with a
mauve sheen, a colour which I have never seen in any other bird,
the other colours being pale peacock green and blue. Sometimes,
when the bird is angry or frightened, it will expose a patch just below
the throat which at ordinary times is hidden. This is triangular in
shape, with a row of white spots, and when the bird is crouching down
with the head bent back, and this exposed, it looks exactly like a giant

toad with its mouth wide open. This, I am convinced, is a protective
arrangement, and is done with the object of scaring away its enemies.
It may also be used in the display of the bird. It is certainly a very
extraordinary arrangement, the like of which is not found in any
other bird.
My bird is the only one left of three imported into this country
in 1928, from Annam, by Monsieur Delacour. It has never been
imported before, and I doubt if it ever will be again, as its home is
in a very remote and little known region.
Though perhaps not so tame as some of my other Pittas, it will
readily come to one for a mealworm. It is a large bird about twice
the size of the Green-breasted Pitta, and rather reminds one of a
miniature Kagua, especially the large soft brown eyes.
This bird is kept in a large indoor aviary with various Jays,
Barbets, etc., and I find that it can hold its own against any of the
other birds. It is fond of digging in the leaf-mould for small insects,
but in most of its habits in captivity it seems to differ in no way from
the rest of the family.
So different in colouring and other characteristics is this bird from
the rest of the Pittas that some years ago it was placed in a different
genus, namely the Hydrornis, and called Hydrornis soror, but this
has now been changed, and the bird is now known as Pitta nipalensis
soror.
The beak and tail are much longer than those possessed by the
rest of the family, the eyes are much larger in proportion to the size
of the head, and the body is more rotund in appearance.
After the first moult this bird changed completely in colour ; the
dull fawn breast-feathers were replaced by ones of the most remarkable
bright fawn-pink, the feathers of the crown, eyebrows, and nape
became tinged with a beautiful glossy mauve-pink. After death these
colours fade, and cabinet specimens give no idea of the real beauty
of this extraordinary bird.
Red and pink are difficult colours to retain in captive birds after
the first moult, especially in Pittas. If an abundance of live food be
given, such as spiders, live ant eggs, the colours will be retained and
the plumage will assume a remarkable gloss, seldom seen in any group

of birds. In fact, in some species the pale bine wing-coverts and tail-
coverts attain such a lustre that I have been asked by visitors if they
are luminous in the dark ! For these patches resemble, when the
birds are in perfect health and condition, the patches of phosphorescence
found in various fishes and insects.
When in repose the Annamese Pitta stands perfectly upright with
the back and tail at right-angles to the floor. It is a strange thing,
but one never sees the picture of a Pitta standing in the correct position.
They are usually portrayed standing with their backs horizontal and
their tails exposed. No Pitta stands like that, and in all species with
a short tail, this is hidden when the wings are folded, and so is the
brilliant blue back. In a wild state a Pitta will, if it knows it is being
watched, turn its back towards one, and watch with the head turned
completely round. In this position it becomes almost invisible in the
low bushes, for the green back tones with the foliage, and the oftimes
striped head becomes invisible in the network of branches.
Nothing is known of the wild life of this species, but of a closely
related bird, Oates' Pitta (Pitta oatesi ) we are told that " it resorts
to the gloomiest ravines, where the sun rarely penetrates even at
midday, and feeds upon worms and insects. It seldom leaves the
ground except to mount on a fallen trunk or low branch. The eyes
are large and soft. ... It is very industrious, turning over dry leaves
in search of food ... is likely to be found wherever there are damp
evergreen forests."
This bird is figured in Elliott's Monograph of the Pittas, but the
plate gives a very erroneous impression of what the bird is really like.
This book, in spite of its being a very sumptuous and costly work
and the only book written on the subject, is very disappointing. Most
of the plates are very poor, and are obviously taken from very badly
stuffed birds, and most are placed in impossible positions, and look
more like those produced by the early seventeenth century artists
than ones of little under forty years ago, when some of the finest
ornithological illustrations were produced. I doubt whether the author
or artists ever saw a live Pitta.
Monsieur Delacour tells us, in The Ibis for 1928, page 286, that
this bird is numerous at Thua-Lun in Annam.

Sydney Porter--Notes on various Bare Pittas
The Philippean Black-headed Pitta (Pitta sordida), like the previously
mentioned bird, seems to have been very rarely imported into this
country. Three were imported in 1929, and I believe mine is the only
one left. There is no record of this species having reached Europe
before, and that is why I add these meagre notes. Why this species is
called " sordida " I do not know, for it is a pretty little creature and
in no way dull-coloured. One of the smallest of the Pittas, it is dark
glossy green above, the breast and underparts being a light almond
green, the whole head glossy black, the lower back and wing-coverts
being the beautiful pale blue so well known in the Pitta family, a patch
between the legs and the under tail-coverts brilliant crimson, which
is edged all round with black, while the wings are marked with black
and white. From the foregoing it will be seen that this is a very
strikingly-coloured bird.
It came to me a very poor creature, with swollen feet and a lump
on one about the size of a small marble. After repeated soakings in
warm soapy water and peroxide of hydrogen, this lump dissolved into
a kind of jelly which easily came away, after which the foot was dressed
with a special ointment, and in a few weeks the feet became quite
normal again.
This bird greatly appreciates live ant eggs, upon which it mainly
lives during the summer time. I think that these are the finest food
for all Pittas, as they all greedily devour them, and I think they also
live upon them to a great extent in the wild state.
I found this Pitta so fond of standing in the water that its feet became
rather sore through it, so this had to be restricted to an hour or two
a day. Unlike any other Pitta this one would sit down on its knees
in the water.
The Black-headed Pittas, of which quite a few species are known,
and of which Pitta sordida is typical, and which differ but slightly from
each other, have their headquarters in the Philippines, and also in the
islands which surround them, ranging as far as Borneo.
Not much is known of the wild life of this bird, so I may be forgiven
for quoting from The Ibis, vol. iv, 10th series, page 617, where Mr. W. P.
Lowe, speaking of a sub-species from Palawan, says : " The Black-
headed Pitta though common is very seldom seen, as it usually prefers

the dense undergrowth of the forest. Occasionally I saw it in the
bed of a stream, but on the slightest alarm it took refuge in the forest.
At times when sitting quietly in the forest, one may hear it hopping
about, and an odd glimpse of this lovely bird is obtained. They feed
on centipedes and other insects."
Many pittas are said to utter a peculiar double whistle when in a
state of freedom, but the only sound I have ever heard this bird make
is a very low whistle, almost inaudible at a distance.
When in flight, few birds are more lovely than the subject of this
chapter, for it is only then that the brilliant patches of shining blue
are shown to their full advantage.
The Blue-tailed Pitta (Eucichla cyanura) comes from the great
island of Java, and is the only Pitta found there. It belongs to the
genus Eucichla, the Bar-breasted or Long-tailed Pittas, but even in
these the tail is little more than three inches in length. This group
contains seven or eight of the most gorgeous of this brilliant family,
and certainly there are few birds in the world to equal them in beauty.
Unfortunately, they are rare, even in the wild state, and only two
species have ever been imported, namely, the rare and lovely Elliott's
Pitta (Eucichla ellioti), which was imported by Monsieur Delacour in
1928, and this one, which I think has been imported four times. The
first bird imported in 1919 went to the late Mr. Astley, another was
imported in 1925, while no less than seven came in 1928, and six more
in 1930, of which mine were a pair. This is, I think, the only record
"of any of these birds being imported.
The Blue-tailed Pitta is truly one of the world's most beautiful
birds, and to my mind even more lovely than Elliott's Pitta mentioned
above. Seen for the first time in the sunlight one is left with a sense
of amazement that a bird could be so beautiful. In spite of the variety
and the brilliance of the colours, the bird does not offend one's aesthetic
sense, for the colours are toned down by the presence of a rich dark
brown. These birds are remarkably quick and alert in their move-
ments, and the long loose breast feathers are continually puffed out
:SO that the bird almost resembles a ball, as it often sways from side
to side.

Sydney Porter--Notes on various Bare Pittas
coffee-plantations formed my best hunting grounds, and there I collected
numbers of a beautiful Pitta (Eucichla cyanura), the breast of this
species being a golden yellow banded with blue stripes. . . . Fairly
common in the coffee plantations near Lawang where the absence of
undergrowth allows of free movement. The sexes apparently separate
during certain seasons as in one plantation I could only meet with
males, while in another more distant I procured females in number.
This species takes to the lower branches of trees when alarmed. These
Pittas and many other birds shot near Lawang had numbers of long flat
white worms under the skin, especially about the thigh-joints ; these
worms were rolled up in round discs It was the presence of these
worms that killed one of my birds. For only a few weeks after I had
congratulated myself on being able to obtain a true pair of these rare
and exquisite birds, I lost the hen. She was absurdly tame, in fact*
only the morning she died she had been having a game with me
pecking and pulling my fingers and playing " hide-and-seek " round a
plant pot in her aviary. I was never so sorry as when I lost this
charming and beautiful creature. A post-mortem revealed the presence
of these same worms all over the body.
In Elliott's Pittidea we are told that " this Pitta is a forest-loving
bird, often seen in old coffee plantations from 600 to 3,000 feet; and
in places overgrown with shrubbery and reeds, and it frequents the
gloomiest spots, remaining on or near the ground."
I find that this Pitta differs in several respects from the rest of
the family, in so much that it is far more arborial, spending quite
as much of its time on the branches as on the floor. I have never
heard the cock utter a sound, but the female used to make a low
wheezing sound when puffing out the breast feathers.

Street 1.--Four of its eight compartments are not yet occupied ;
the others house respectively a pair of the North American Blue
Grosbeaks (ccerulea), a Turtle Dove paired with a hen Barbary Dove,
a White Java Sparrow cock with a Pectoralis hen, with another pair for
this cross the opposite way next door.
Street 2.--Two invalid Stanley Parrakeets which scalped themselves
in a nocturnal panic, a Nonpareil Bunting, two Diamond Doves, two
pairs of Red Mountain Doves, and an odd White Java Sparrow occupy
five compartments, two are empty, and in the eighth are two Spice-
Birds (nisoria not punctidata), one Sharp-tailed Munia, and four
Tricolour Mannikins. Two of the last have distinctly chestnutty
breasts, not the normal pure white. " This variation has persisted
through two moults."
Street 3.--The first compartment holds a hen Blue Grosbeak ( cyanea ),
waiting to be paired with the big all-blue Argentine Grosbeak, which
has been here and unidentified so long ; No. 2, a hen Rainbow Bunting,
" at least two years old, but still with the breast a very bright yellow-
green, almost too bright for a hen's " ; No. 3, a pair of Lovebird
hybrids ; No. 4 a Cape Sparrow cock with a hen Saffron Finch ; Nos. 5
and 6, two Cape-X-House hybrids, still separated by a division;
No. 7, a pair of Pileated Finches ; No. 8, empty.
Street 4.--A pair of Abyssinian Lovebirds, the hen on eggs ; No. 2,
a pair of Peach-face Lovebirds ; No. 3, pair Masked Lovebirds. The
other five compartments are filled with hybrid Lovebirds. These and
Budgerigars are all over the place wherever room can be found for them.
They breed regularly, and even more readily than Budgerigars. Six
crosses at least have been bred ; two, to two or more generations,
when they breed true and would therefore appear to be functioning
as real species. Mr. Whitley has a beautiful plate showing the six crosses
drawn by a local artist; may we hope that this is a prelude to a full
account by him of these and his many other hybrids ?
Street 5.--Not yet finished, but two compartments hold Lovebird
hybrids, and the third a pair of rare Parrotlets, smaller and a lighter
green than the ordinary " Blue-winged Lovebird ", which are believed
to be viridissima. They are sitting on eggs.

Eight large aviaries with outer and inner (heated) flights, each with
a smaller inner compartment, here distinguished as (a). The first

recently arrived and in another part of the Zoo, which seems to be

Sir, --In the January number of the Magazine Miss Chawner
mentions having seen in Germany an example of the South American
small Grosbeak, Neorhynchus nasesus , which was supposed to be a
first importation.
I do not think this is quite the case, for last July (1930), Captain
Hammond showed me a bird which he had had for a year, and which
had been identified at the British Museum as a Neorhynchus , probably
nasesus (or should it be masesus ?), though it did not quite agree with
that or with the other species, devronis, and might be an undescribed
one. It was a brown bird, rather resembling in looks and bill a small
hen Guiraca ; I believe this bird is still alive.

At the same time and place I saw another very rare Finch, a
Sporophila ruficollis Cab., which entirely unknown alive, is, I believe,
only represented by two or three skins anywhere. This was also
identified at the Museum and is an ochre-brown bird, with a grey and
black mingled front, about the size and shape of the average Sporophila.
Perhaps their owner may be able to give us further details about
these two extremely rare little seed-eaters.

BREEDING QUAIL-FINCHES IN AUSTRALIA
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998562954545454" page_id="56181945"  page_num="228" year="" vol="">
Sir, --I have been looking out for records of breeding the Quail-
finch in different parts, and found none in Australia. If there is such
a record, I would be pleased to hear of it.
Some five years ago I had one pair of Quail-finches, and was most
desirous of breeding them on account of their beauty and curious
walking habits, being ground birds and only occasionally perching.
So I set out to try breeding from these two for further study ; they
nested twice with only two eggs to each clutch (eggs white, almost
round, but were all infertile) ; and then, to my great disappointment,
one morning I found the hen dead in the nest. I had been trying ever
since to procure this species again, but it was only last November
that I obtained a few pairs, and once more had hopes of their breeding.
I built more aviaries, planting fox-tail grass, and in the shelter placed
a dead privet tree for a pair of Cordon Bleus to nest in. These reared
two fully-fledged chicks, but one since died.
This old privet tree has a large bunchy root, and I noted on 16th
February male and female Quail-finch in this aviary carrying dried
grass to the privet root, and they finally finished a double-room domed
nest, lined with white feathers, and the hen laid three eggs by 3rd
March. Incubation commenced in earnest, both birds doing their
equal share in nest-building and incubation, but the male would sit
on guard in the front porch each night. On 17th March I heard feeding

squeaks of the male, and with the aid of a mirror on 25th March I
could see three slatey coloured chicks with three phosphorescent warts
on each side of their beaks, which I believe are used for night feeding,
as I often heard the feeding going on at night time. But on 5th April
only two could I find outside, and none inside the nest. However,
I found the other apparently drowned in the water vessel, but after
carrying it in my hand for ten or fifteen minutes, thinking of a burial
service or a museum specimen, it started to grate its beak. I rushed it
into the kitchen, placing it in some warm wool, and giving drops of
warm Bovril for an hour or two. I must say the parents were searching
high and low for their lost chick during its absence. It has been
mentioned to me that young Quail-finches leave the nest at two days
old, similar to the ordinary Quail, but such is not the case.
At normal times the Quail-finches are fed on Hungarian and red
millet, but on hearing the young being fed, I dug up all the ant eggs
and chopped all the spiders, crickets, and grasshoppers I could find,
and they were readily looked for. I had run out of mealworms. I am
glad to say the three youngsters are now healthy and fully-grown, but
have not quite attained adult plumage. They are now nearly six weeks
old, and clearly show sexual distinction, being one cock and two hens.
In between the New Year and the present date I have bred four
Pectoral Finches, three Olive Finches, one Cordon Bleu, and another
Quail-finch from the same parents out of a two-eggs clutch. I believe
two eggs to be the normal clutch, as in the case of the Crimson-crested
Finches, which I found would lay two eggs only on every occasion
for three years.
Trusting I will hear of similar luck from other members.
G. Packer.

Correspoiidence
Cleres any day of the week from 2 o'clock. Not knowing this, I had
bothered him with a letter asking permission, to which he had kindly
replied, saying that if I could postpone my visit to after a certain
date, he would take me round himself.
Unfortunately I had only one day to spare, and that was a very
wet Sunday, with a blustery wind, either the day or just about the
day of the earthquake in England.
If Cleres is approached by road from Rouen, there is no difficulty
in finding the Chateau ; the neat hedge on the high road does not
conceal the wire-netting. I arrived there about 1.30, and, as the car
drew up, a man in a blue uniform came forward. I inquired if I could
go in, and he replied not very intelligibly that I could not till 2 o'clock.
" But I am in a great hurry," I explained, " and I have a letter from
Monsieur Delacour in my pocket giving me permission to come." He
smiled at me affably, but made no attempt to help me, and I was
beginning to wonder if such a stupid-looking being was of much use as
a keeper, when my chauffeur, who had meanwhile gone to the lodge-
keeper's lodge, returned to say I might go in at once. So, thinking he
would like to see the Park too, we started off unaccompanied, and
beginning with the magnificent collection of wild Duck that are
separated off from each other in a river that flows through the grounds,
were just making our way across to see some Wallabies when a whistle
made me pull up. " Did you hear that ? " I asked the chauffeur.
" Perhaps someone is whistling to us." " More likely one of the
monkeys," but raising my umbrella I saw a man hurrying towards us.
" Have you got entrance tickets ? " he asked. " No," I replied, " I
didn't know there were any. The man in uniform at the gate merely
told me that I couldn't come in till 2 p.m., but as we are in a hurry
to get back to Paris, the concierge kindly let us in. Monsieur Delacour
wrote to say I might come when I liked."
" There is no man in uniform at the gate."
"Yes, a blue uniform."
" That is one of the inmates from the asile in the neighbourhood."
I readily believed him, remembering the man's expression !
My interlocuter, who had first spoken to me in French, turned out
to be an Englishman, Mr. Fooks, in charge of Monsieur Delacour's

collection. He very kindly accompanied us, and showed me the
magnificent aviaries, the collection of tropical birds in the green-
house, etc., and we were further accompanied most of the way by a
pair of Gibbon monkeys who leapt from tree to tree, and then made a
frieze of themselves against the sky on the top of a wall.
I am too ignorant to say anything of Monsieur Delaeour's collection,
and readers of The Avicultural Magazine have already had
opportunities of reading about it. I was especially interested to see
some Parrots, a lovely pair of black Cockatoos, three or four Macaws
of different kinds, and an African Grey, all sitting out in the rain,
soaked through, and to hear that they were left out like that day and
night till the autumn, when they were put in an unheated room. I
don't believe the climate at Cleres differs much from the English
climate ; anyhow, as I live in the South of France, I am going to try
the experiment with my many Parrots, for whom heat has always been
provided in the winter. It can be uncommonly cold on the Riviera,
but, of course, nothing comparable to Cleres in the Seine Inferieure.
Altogether I spent a very happy couple of hours at Cleres under
Mr. Fooks' kind guidance, and, to complete my joy, one of the Black
Cockatoos sat on my arm, so that I could see it at close quarters.
What is happiness, the cynic may ask ? Well--when you have wanted
to see something very badly, and never have, and then suddenly
do--I think you experience the real thing. I am sure I did.

A REMARKABLE HYBRID
Sir, --Miss Robinson of Camberley is to be greatly congratulated.
She has bred what I believe to be an absolutely new hybrid, that is,
a Bronze Mannikin X St. Helena Waxbill.
I have been to see it, and feel sure that it is this cross. The mother
(the Waxbill) is sitting again on four eggs, but the father still keeps his
eye on his infant, though that is now strong on the wing and well able
to feed and look after himself. The father has been four years with

Miss Robinson, an odd bird which has never had a mate till his choice
of the Waxbill this season ; the Waxbill has been there more than
a year. As there are other Waxbills of the same sort there, why on
earth did she select the Mannikin ? Two young were hatched, but only
the one left the nest.
In shape and length of tail the young bird resembles the Waxbill,
except in its stouter build, this apparently being the only feature it
has inherited from the father ; general colour earthy-brown, paler
below and with an ochreous flush over the centre of the belly, forehead
red-brown and a small red eye-streak a more orange-brown. A small
white nest-pimple at angle of bill still shows.
The above is a rough description, but the breeder promises a full
account of the event for the Magazine, and will, I expect, give a better
description.
A Bicheno Finch has also been reared in the same aviary, and
another pair of St. Helenas have eggs there.
The Waxbills are the smaller, rather darker birds which now come
in. Are they the true E. a. astrild from South Africa ?
E. Hopkinson.
A postscript to my note of yesterday. There is a cock Violet-
eared Waxbill, I think, in Miss Robinson's aviary. This may be
the father of the hybrid, whose looks at any rate certainly would
suggest this father rather than a Mannikin. The latter may have
merely taken a sort of kind-uncle interest in the youngster, as bachelor
uncles do.
E. Hopkinson.
The owner of this interesting bird writes as follows :--
A Bronze Mannikin cock which I purchased four years back in
a small mixed consignment of birds from a breeder who was giving
up his aviary, has fully compensated me for the patience I have exercised
in his favour. Many times had I looked at the quaint little solitary
fellow who had no mate of his own blood and kin and threatened to
dispose of him. Last year he courted a Grassfinch hen, and together
they set up housekeeping, building a nest in which she deposited four
eggs, all to no purpose however.

This season he transferred his affections to a St. Helena Waxbill
hen, and so successful has been this alliance that I have now in my
aviary, flying strongly, my first hybrid--Bronze Mannikin X St. Helena
Waxbill. I am told on good authority that this is probably the first
time that this cross has been bred and any notes I can give will make
interesting reading.
A clutch of four eggs were laid, all of which were fertile. Incubation
ceased in the case of two, judging by their appearance at the end of a
week. The remaining two hatched 7th June, but, alas ! one died just
on the point of flying, the other chick proved very strong, and both
the parents fed it assiduously ; if anything the Mannikin cock was the
more persistent feeder, and kept constant guard by the nest, making-
short work of any intruders.
The young bird, so far, resembles mostly the St. Helena : plumage
uniform mouse brown (above darker, below clearer yellowish brown
washed rose colour), tail black-brown, streak from beak orange (beak
is the shape of the Mannikin), forehead red-brown.
The parents have gone to nest again and are now sitting on another
clutch of eggs, so my hopes rise high that the second adventure will be
even more successful than the first.
I have reared this season the Bicheno Finch, and the pair are again
sitting on four eggs. I have also a nest full of St. Helena's about ten days
old ; I am not sure yet how many.
The other birds included in my small collection are Diamond
Sparrows, Grassfinches, Green Avadavats, Violet-eared Waxbills, etc.
Last season I reared a number of Zebra Finches, and any success
I have had is due to the ever-ready help and advice I have always
received from the members of the Avicultural Society, some of whom
have gone to endless trouble to put me on the right road in this
interesting and most fascinating hobby.

CROSSOPTILONS BREEDING AT ONE YEAR OLD
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990175285714286" page_id="56181951"  page_num="234" year="" vol="">
Sir,-- It might prove of interest to our readers of the Magazine
to learn of my Brown-eared Manchurian (Crossoptilon) Pheasants
breeding at the age of one year. These birds, ten of them, were hatched
in May, 1930, and were allowed to run together throughout the winter
and spring of this year, and in passing through their pens on 20th April
I was surprised to find an egg in this pen. Two days later another hen
commenced laying, and a day later a third hen laid. Any information
I had been able to acquire led me to believe that it was not unusual
for year-old hens of this species to lay, but the eggs never proved
fertile. As sufficient eggs were collected to make up a setting they
were given to a Bantam hen, and to my surprise every egg hatched.
The eggs from the young hens continued highly fertile and each fertile
egg hatched. The last egg was laid on 11th June, although the parent
stock continued laying until 3rd July.
It was noticeable, however, that the last two hatches did not contain
fertile eggs. This might have been caused by the removal and sale of
two pairs of these birds during the period of laying. The eggs from the
older birds continued to be fertile, although not of the high percentage
of fertility of the younger ones, throughout the season.

Dr. Hopkinson's Selective Index to the past numbers of the
Avicultural Magazine is in the press, and will be ready soon. It
will be a most useful volume to all those who keep birds, for they will
be able at once to refer to former references to any particular species.
The price has been fixed as low as possible, namely at 10s., at which it
is hoped our members will not be slow in ordering copies and so help
to pay off the somewhat heavy expense of printing the volume.

I have referred on more than one occasion to the Blue specimen of
the Masked Lovebird which the Zoological Society possesses and to our
hopes of reproducing this colour variety, and now I am able to record
the successful rearing of young Blue birds from his progeny. So far
this year there have been two nests from two pairs of the Blue-bred
birds of the first generation, the first of which produced two Blues
and one Green, the second four Green and one Blue. For some obscure
reason the parents in both cases appear to have plucked the feathers
from the young birds while in the nest; and so we took the youngsters
and my daughter hand-reared them, with the result that we have those
of the first nest now practically adult and almost fully feathered, and
those of the second nest coming on well.
I cannot yet fathom this plucking in the nest by these Lovebirds,
and should be glad of the views of our members, especially of those
who have bred Agapornis personata. One finds a nest full of fat
youngsters nearly ready to shift for themselves, with fully feathered
heads but practically naked bodies. In one case the wing-feathers of the
eldest youngsters were complete, and on inspection of the nest two flew
out, though featherless except for their heads and wings. These, having
left the nest, are now feathering. The other three, of which one is blue,
we took for hand-rearing, and they are now well covered.
Messrs. Boosey and Brookshank will have the sympathy of the
members in their loss of an aviary-full of Gouldian Finches at the hands
of a burglar or burglars, especially as several nests of young birds were
destroyed in the process. Otherwise I hear that the Keston Foreign
Bird Farm has had a most successful season.
It is not easy to breed birds successfully in a public institution
such as the Zoological Gardens. It is not that the birds mind the public,
so long as they keep the right side of the wire partition and do not

insist upon giving monkey nuts to insectivorous birds, and suchlike
foolish practices, but the trouble is that the stock is always far too
great for the very limited number of aviaries and overcrowding is
fatal to prospects of breeding. Nevertheless, we have to record one
notable success in the hatching and rearing of two Illiger's Macaws
(Ara maracana) in one of the new outside aviaries of the Parrot
House, which Dr. Hopkinson will kindly note for the next edition of
his Records. In another of these aviaries two young Rock Peplars
have been reared.
A fine brood of Malabar Parrakeets has been reared in Mr. Ezra's
aviaries, where there is also a brood of three young Queen Alexandras
in the nest. Young have also been reared from the Blue cock
Alexandrine and from a pair of Barrabands.

TWO RARE MANAKINS

<bodyText confidence="0.982121576923077" page_id="56181964"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
The Manakins, contained in the family Pipridse, are small birds,
generally more or less brilliantly coloured in the male sex, which
inhabit the tropical forests of South America. They feed principally
upon berries and fruits. There are some fourteen genera and about
seventy species.
The Manakins are little known to aviculturists, and the arrival, in
August, 1929, of some five or six examples was a matter of considerable
interest. These were purchased by Mr. Spedan Lewis and presented to
the Zoological Society. They proved to belong to the two species
depicted in the accompanying plate, though at the time all were in
immature plumage of a greenish colour. All but three died within a
few weeks of their arrival, but one pair of Chiroxiphia pareola and a cock
Chiromachceris manacus appeared to thrive though the hen bird did not
survive for many months. The two cock birds, however, moulted
well and assumed their full adult plumage as depicted in the plate,
which is drawn from life. Edward's Manakin was one of the smartest
little birds imaginable ; with tight plumage and extremely rapid
movements, it was a most striking bird. It died for no apparent
reason when to all appearances in most perfect condition twenty months
after its arrival. The cock Superb, now two years in the Zoological
Gardens, is alive and well as I write.
These are birds of the damp tropical jungles, Edward's Manakin
being found in Guiana, Amazonia, Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador,
and Peru, while the countries occupied by the Superb Manakin are given
as Guiana, Lower Amazonia, Ecuador, Brazil, and Bolivia.

THE NESTING OF THE HALMAHERA
HANGING PARROT ( LORICULUS AMAB1L1S)
By The Marquess of Tavistock
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99903578125" page_id="56181965"  page_num="238" year="" vol="">
Some years ago a collector, Mr. Mayer if I remember rightly,
brought over a few pairs of this delightful little bird, and sent me a
couple on approval. I was rather " off " Hanging Parrots at the time,
owing to a series of discouraging losses from kidney trouble due, as I
eventually discovered, entirely to the giving of Nestle's milk in their
syrup, instead of Horlicks ; but I was so taken by the fascinating
mites, which were in excellent condition, that I decided to give them
a trial. The Halmahera is a very small bird ; in fact, the tiniest Parrot
I have seen alive. The cock is green with a red rump, a neat red cap,
a touch of orange-red at the wing butts, and a red spot on the throat.
The hen lacks the red cap, and the spot on her throat is very minute.
The hen has a dark eye, but the cock's iris is whitish. Both sexes
have very small black beaks, legs and feet the colour of the centre
of a carrot, and the under surface of the wing- and tail-feathers the
pretty pale blue shade which is almost universal throughout the genus.
I kept the pair in a large cage for a time, and then turned them into
a large outdoor aviary with the shelter well heated during the cold
months. In 1929-30 they spent a lot of time in the flight, even on
cold days, but last winter they hardly left the shelter, although the
winter on the whole was milder. The birds are fed on Sunbird mixture
--honey, Mellin's food, and Horlicks, together with sweet grapes,
and in summer they seem fond of the pollen from flowering grass
heads.
They have a weak, sibilant cry quite inaudible at any distance,
and do not, in the day-time at any rate, hang upside down as the
Blue-crowned is fond of doing.
Although my pair had come over in the same small cage, they long
displayed the most profound aversion to one another, and I gave up
all hopes of their ever attempting to breed. It seemed a case of mutual
incompatibility of temperament of the worst kind. For more than
two years the hen would not allow the cock to come anywhere near
her, even when he was in breeding condition ; then he turned the

tables upon her, and for nearly two years would not allow her to come
anywhere near him ! It was only this spring that I began to see them
sitting within a few feet of each other, and refraining from hostile
demonstrations. A miniature grandfather-clock nest was put up in
the outside flight, the " head " of the box down to egg-level being
covered outside and inside with natural bark, an arrangement which
exercises a marvellous fascination for nearly all members of the Parrot
tribe. In June the cock began to feed the hen and in July she started
to carry grass into the box, tucking a load into the feathers of her
rump and flanks, after the fashion of a Madagascar Lovebird. (Strange
that two groups of little Parrots so utterly dissimilar in structure and
habits as the Loriculi and Agapornis should have evolved some species
which have adopted this curious labour-saving habit when collecting
nest-lining.)
Three eggs were laid and the hen sat steadily for nearly three
weeks, being fed at the nest by her mate with much devotion. He had
a habit of shaking, or rather vibrating, his tail very rapidly when he
was busy inspecting the welfare of bis home. The ending was
disappointing. One afternoon I noticed the hen off longer than she
should be, and on examining the eggs, found them to be infertile.
Halmaheras, in common with all other Hanging Parrots I have kept,
have one slight drawback. Their claws need regular cutting and
often get overgrown. The operation is difficult and tiresome for all
concerned. The Hanging Parrot flies on to the wire-netting, gets
tangled up, and as soon as you take it in your hand, seizes the mesh
in a vice-like grip. Eight little toes and eight overgrown nails are
wound round the wire, apparently two or three times, and as soon
as, with infinite trouble, you have disengaged one claw, another,
previously unfixed, again catches hold ! All the time you are deeply
concerned lest you should pull the bird's leg too hard and hurt him,
and he is deeply concerned with hurting you as much as possible with
his small but sharp beak !

H. Moore--The Value of a Bread and Milk Diet
THE VALUE OF A BREAD AND MILK DIET
By H. Moore, F.Z.S.
Just a few notes upon a bread and milk diet. Upon the summit
of the Tadworth plateau very few birds do really well, and I do not
except our native species. For instance, Goldfinches and Bullfinches,
both British and Russian, do poorly here in outdoor aviaries, at least
they do with me. No matter how they are fed they appear to lose
colour a week or two after arrival here, and many do not survive for
long. I have now ceased to attempt acclimatizing these species. In
the garden at liberty Starlings, Chaffinches, Thrushes, Tits, and Black-
birds do well, but the other species I am sure are becoming more rare
each season. Eight years ago there were a dozen Nightingales in full
song within sound of my garden. One used to pirouette and sauce me
each morning early, using my garden fence as his platform. Unfortu-
nately all have now disappeared, and for three years no Nightingale
has sung within hearing of my premises--the pity of it.
Chaffinches and Starlings are increasing enormously in this district,
but certain birds, at one time extremely numerous, appear to be dying
out. There are Linnets, but not flocks of them as there were a few
years ago. The same with Red-polls and Greenfinches. Wagtails
and Robins are getting scarce, and one seldom sees the Wren and the
Long-tailed Tit these days. Some local enthusiasts blame the Little
Owl for this shortage of bird life, but then why and how do the Starlings
and the Chaffinches escape the depredations of this night-prowling alien?
For many years I completely failed with Gouldians outdoors here.
This year I have managed to acclimatize (or partially) two pairs.
Both have built nests, but I have seen or heard of no young as yet.
They are nesting, it is true, but they do not appear quite happy.
I feel somewhat guilty each time I enter their aviary. I have allowed
them plenty of space, a large bath, and heaps of good food. They
are very conservative, however, and I have never caught them in the
act of bathing. They eat well, but millet and grass in seed, with a
little green plantain appears to be all they choose from a varied menu
supplied them. Zebra Finches afford me the same anxiety and trouble.
This season, however, I have managed to rear two youngsters which are

" now on the perch " with their parents. This gives me hopes of
eventual success with the Gouldians.
There is one class of bird which does really well up here in these
clouds. Strangely enough they are birds from tropical environments.
I refer to all the various species of Love-birds. Winter and summer
they do extraordinarily well, keeping their plumage, their colour,
their vitality and their general health in amazing manner considering
the vast difference of climate they are asked to withstand. Now I am
going to give Love-bird enthusiasts a hint. The most valuable addition
to the ordinary diet for Love-birds is bread and milk. I know I am
going to bring down the wrath of many far more expert and knowledge-
able aviculturists upon my head, but truth is truth, and what science
most needs and demands is truth based upon experiment, investigation,
and practice. I have had Love-birds outside here upon this plateau
amid arctic conditions. When my Masked Blackcheek hybrids were
hatched there was deep snow covering the entire aviary, and snow
even upon the roof of their nest-box. There were five nestlings, and
each one reached maturity, as did a further nest of four hatched some
time later in the season. One of these hybrids is now at the Natural
History Section of the British Museum. I notice that the authorities
there name the Masked Love-bird as the Yellow Collared Love-bird.
Here is the fact then, all my young Love-birds and also Budgerigars
are reared upon bread and milk in addition to their usual seed diet,
and I never lose one except by accident. Since discovering the value
of bread and milk no young have died in the nest with me ; all have
been reared. Even in this cold and damp climate I use no cod-liver oil
or other addition to diet. Just seed and bread and milk. My Love-birds
and Budgerigars will leave millet on branch for bread and milk. Earlier
in this letter I reported the arrival of two young Zebra Finches. Both
have been plentifully supplied with bread and milk by their parents.
What made me try this unusual diet ? The fact that I had brought
delicate Soft-bills to England from South America and the West Indies
upon a diet of bread and milk and fruit. They kept so well on this
diet that I was impressed by the diet and as an experiment tried it
out upon my Lovebirds and Budgerigars with huge success. I have
not published my experience sooner because I wanted to give it two or

three years 5 further trial. That trial is now complete to my satisfaction.
At the present time I have young Peach-faced, Fischer's, Black-
cheeked and Masked Love-birds all reared upon bread and milk, and a
rare picture they look, as full of health and vitality as newly caught
Smelts.
Possibly this diet is suitable to the unsatisfactory climatic conditions
appertaining here at Tadworth, Surrey, but would not be found so
valuable elsewhere. Upon that point I can offer no advice ; my
experiments have been carried out at Tadworth and nowhere else.
However, no one will ever dissuade me as to the extreme value of a
bread and milk diet to any species of birds wise enough to eat it.
[We should like to ask Mr. Moore if he has used fresh milk or one of the brands
of preserved or tinned milk ? The former, while probably the most valuable,
is very apt to turn sour in warm weather, with perhaps disastrous results. --Ed.]

to keep Rollers together, even pairs, once they get fit, and even breeding
pairs will kill one another, the hen usually being the killer, but
occasionally it is the other way, but then only when the cock, after
much forbearance, at last has to turn and to defend himself, when he
may make a thorough job of it. This hunting of the cock away by
the hen is probably only a natural instinct to ensure his not exercising
his curiosity when she is off the nest, and perhaps being tempted to taste
the eggs. The hen comes off with a rush and if the cock is anywhere
near, goes for him like a tornado ; in nature he would put a good
distance between his raging partner and himself, but in an aviary
often a fight must ensue. If nothing serious happens the hen will
return to the nest and almost immediately call up her mate, who comes
at once and feeds her ; later on too he does his fair share or more in
feeding the young."

This rather large Sparrow, with its jet-black crown and throat, and
its snowy underparts and yellow beak, is certainly one of the most
handsome of the American Sparrow family, but what made it
particularly interesting to me was that little or nothing was known
of its nesting habits, and when my friend Professor Rowan, of the
University of Alberta, told me that he might be able to send me a few
birds, I was very naturally thrilled with the idea.
This bird nests in the far north, to the west of Hudson Bay, and as
it is an early breeder the young have usually left the nest before the
ice is broken up, and it is possible for white men to reach the country.
The first nest was discovered by Seton on 5th August, 1907, and it
contained three fully-fledged young. Up to the present year, no
authentic eggs were known in collections, but I hear from Professor
Rowan that some eggs have been taken this summer at Fort Churchill.
In the winter these birds migrate to the Missouri Valley and Texas.
Early in November last year I received a letter from Professor
Rowan saying that he was sending over half a dozen pairs of the
Sparrows to be divided equally between the " Zoo " and myself.
The birds duly arrived quite safely : they were then in their winter
plumage, and I found it quite impossible to sex them, so had to hope
that they would turn out to be true pairs. The weather, when they
arrived, was rather inclement, although probably not nearly so bad
as that they have to put up with in the States. Still, I thought it
would be safer to winter them indoors. They stood the confinement
very well, and when I turned them out in the middle of March, they
were just beginning to get the rich black feathers on their heads and
throats. Two of them died, I think from pneumonia, and the remainder
showed no sign of interest in each other, skulking for the most part
alone on the ground and beneath the low-growing shrubs, and when
I went abroad for six weeks in May, I was still uncertain as to whether
there was a true pair amongst them. On my return I found that they

were all in full breeding plumage, but there was still no sign of either
of them haying mated, and it was not until the second week in June
that I noticed one of them carrying building material. The cock now
began to sing steadily, and between whiles cleared one of the other
birds, presumably another cock. I now started a hunt for the nest.
Not knowing the birds 5 habits it was more than a week before I found
it, and then only by chance, as I flushed the bird from my feet quite
unexpectedly. Even then I could not find the nest, as the ground cover
was very thick. Finally I found it by concealing myself, and watching
the birds' return. The nest, which was made of nettle-roots and moss,
lined with fine grass, was in a depression in the ground, the top of the
nest being level with the ground, and entirely hidden fron view by
the growing vegetation. The eggs, four in number, were greenish-
white, marked all over with fine reddish-brown spots and heavily
.zoned with the same colour. Readers will no doubt be horrified to
hear that I promptly took the eggs and nest, but as these have certainly
never been seen in Europe before, I was anxious to exhibit them at
the next meeting of the British Ornithological Club. I quite expected
that the birds would go to nest again pretty promptly, and I watched
most carefully for signs of their doing so. As far as I could see nothing
happened. The cock did not sing, and none of the four birds seemed to
take interest in each other, spending most of their time hidden out of
*sight in the thick cover. Nevertheless, I spent a good deal of time
hunting the ground for a nest without success, and finally, as two of
the birds had gone out of colour, I gave up all hope of having another
nest this year. However, the third week in July my son told me that
he was convinced that two of the Sparrows had a nest, and from their
demeanour I thought that he was right, as both birds were keeping
up a continuous chirp, something like the " pink-pink" of our Chaffinch.
We decided that he should go in and look, whilst I kept an eye on the
birds from outside the aviary. He had not been in the aviary a minute
before I noticed one of the birds fly out of the centre of a thick bush
of box. On looking closely we found the nest in the middle of the
densest part, about 4 feet from the ground. It contained two
young ones, about four days' old, covered with jejb-black down. The
old birds appeared to be feeding the young principally upon spiders

and other crawling insects, but when they were about a week old I
provided mealworms, which the old Sparrows readily took to them.
They left the nest when about fourteen days' old, hiding themselves
in the thick bushes, w^here they were fairly well protected from some
very heavy rainstorms that we had at this time. When they were
on the wing, I noticed that the cock bird was devoting himself entirely
to the smaller of the two young ones, leaving the hen to look after
the other. I have never known this to happen with aviary birds
before, as I have always found both parents to feed the young ones
indiscriminately. From the time that the young ones flew, the hen
neglected to come for mealworms, feeding her young one on seed only.
The cock, on the other hand, came regularly five or six times a day
for his supply, almost taking them from my hand. The song of the
cock is two short whistles, one an octave higher than the other, and is
not very musical. I only heard it for about ten days, when they
were first nesting.

The Zoological Society's Park at Whipsnade is not well adapted
to aviculture, but at the same time there are a few items of avicultural
interest to be recorded. A pair of Quaker Parrakeets at liberty have
taken up their abode close to the entrance to the park and built a
beautiful nest of sticks amongst the ivy. No one has been up to
investigate, but as one of the birds is nearly always in the nest while
the other keeps guard near by we are looking forward to the appearance
of young Quakers in due course.
Wood Lawn Bird Sanctuary contains, among other introductions,
some Brush Turkeys, and in the spring I was able to round these up,
when I discovered that they consisted of four hens only, the cock
originally placed there having evidently disappeared. Most fortunately
just then Mr. Chapman imported a few of these birds, and I was able

to secure a good cock bird. He was pinioned and for a time confined
in a wire enclosure close to the favourite haunt of the hens. He was
then liberated and, within a few weeks, had formed a mighty mound,
scraping up leaves and debris from many yards round. The hens
have been seen to visit this mound, so we are in hopes of chicks, though
the season is far advanced.
A number of Chukor Partridges were obtained from India in the
spring, and no sooner were they turned out than they commenced
to lay eggs. These were collected and placed under small hens, with
the result that some thirty have been reared.
" Within the last twelve months," writes Mr. D. Dickison in the
Emu, " a number of Chestnut-eared Finches (Tceniopygia castanotis),
apparently escaped from private aviaries, have established themselves
in the vicinity of Gardiner's Creek, on the outskirts of the eastern
suburbs of Melbourne. They congregate in small parties of from four
to eight birds, and usually prefer the open field to the tea-tree scrub
along the creek. One cold day last August I noticed a pair take shelter
in an old nest in a furze bush, and on being disturbed they returned
to the nest almost immediately. Another nest was found during
February this year with the female sitting on five heavily-incubated
eggs. Five young ones were hatched out a few days later, and after
remaining in the nest for nearly a fortnight they began to make short
flights into the neighbouring bushes, but would always return to the
nest at night to roost."
The common Partridge is not generally regarded as an aviary bird,
but it becomes extremely tame and will readily breed and, providing
a good supply of fresh ants' eggs can be obtained, there is not much
difficulty in rearing the chicks. It will even breed in quite a small
aviary as Mr. Laidlay has found, for he writes me : "I had a pair of
Partridges, not very good ones, which I put in an aviary with some

Six of the remaining eggs were ready to hatch, but the hen left the

as that ? "

<bodyText confidence="0.998957230769231" page_id="56181985"  page_num="256" year="" vol="">
Sir, --A week ago I picked up a fledgling Starling unable to fly,
and carrying him home I put him in a small cage and tried to feed him.
For the first day or so I had to open his beak and feeding him was most
difficult. After the second day I could not find enough worms and grubs
to satisfy him. When he was hungry he would call, and if he was not
attended to at once he became very angry. He loved his cage, which
I had changed for a larger one, and slept at night in a box filled with hay.
He was always lazy in the morning and would not take his first worm
until he had stretched his wings, flapped them violently and generally
got over the cramped position of the night. After a week he could fly,
and after his 9 o'clock feed he flew out of the open back door. I felt
very sad after he had gone, and never thought to see him again, but
at 1 o'clock I heard his call, and running out saw him on the shed roof
by the back door. He literally hurled himself into my arms yelling
for food and rubbing himself under my chin. He flew into his cage,
ate a huge meal from my fingers, and then had a bath, sitting on my
hand to preen himself. He was very tired, and stayed till the next
morning, when he flew away again, but he comes back every hour
and a half, and yells outside till I go and feed him, then off he goes into
the trees. His flight is strong. He perches on my hand in the garden
and is absolutely tame. Last night he slept out, but came in when
called by name, " Jackie," by my bedroom window. He makes no
attempt to feed himself ; yesterday I tried to teach him, but he would
only look for grubs between my fingers and between my lips. I have
given him alternate feeds of " Stamina," worms, and grubs, and raw
mince. His baby fluff has almost disappeared, and the yellow shrunk

from his beak. It seems marvellous to me that he did not get lost
when he went out the first time, and that he knew the house from the
others standing near, as he had never been out before, and he flew
straight out and away almost at once into high trees, disappearing
completely.

Sir, -- I have on several occasions noticed a rather interesting
fact in connection with birds of the Parrot family, especially Cockatoos,
which are normally very destructive to all wooden objects within their
reach. They will not, at any time of year, seriously damage a nest they
really like the look of as a possible breeding place. If a new nest is
bitten to pieces almost as soon as it is put in, you may take it that,
in the birds' opinion, a nest of that type is only fit for exercising beaks
on, and you will have to try and devise something more natural and
attractive to the Cockatoo mind. Some Parrot dike birds are much
more sensible than their owners, and simply refuse to breed in a nest
in which their instinct tells them the young would never flourish.
Others, however, once they have been forced to use an unsuitable
nest, will go on using it, losing their young, even when more wholesome
accommodation is provided, the impulse to return to a familiar nesting
site being stronger than the impulse to choose the most healthy nesting
site.

OLD GREY PARROT LAYING EGGS

brought from the Canary Island by a clerical friend of mine about
sixteen years ago, and it was then six months old and thought to be

the size of a Pigeon's egg, but somewhat larger, which, of course,
proved conclusively that the supposed " he " bird was a hen. I wonder

Sir, --I think it may be of interest to know that a pair of Purple-
headed Starlings I have, hatched two young ones a few weeks ago.
One lived about a week, when I found it dead on the floor of the aviary.
The other lived over a fortnight. I had no idea the hen was sitting,
as she nested in a box covered with bark, and fixed high up. She
was able to slip out of the nest without being seen when she heard
footsteps. The first sign I saw of young was that the old birds did not
eat the mealworms, but held them in the beak till I was out of sight
of them, and then I saw them enter the nest. Am I right in supposing
that Purple-headed Starlings have not been bred in England ? If
they have, I should be glad of hints as to how to feed them when they
have young, as I think mine may nest again.

grass seed. I think, too, he sampled a neighbour's raspberries. But he
always returns and allows himself to be carried indoors by tea-time.
If his cage is left open in the evening and I am out I always find him
asleep on a spray of rose or a carnation arranged in a large vase on a
pedestal in a corner of the room, and he never moves however close
I go to him. Outside he sings, raising his little crest, and is in no way
bewildered or upset. I am very anxious to find a hen for him, but so
far have been unsuccessful.

BREEDING THE MASKED LOVEBIRD AND SWAINSON'S
LORIKEET

Sir, --Referring to our Editor's remarks on the nesting of the
Masked Lovebird, I have had pretty much the same experience just
lately.
My old pair of Masked Lovebirds were purchased late in 1927,
and have reared young each year, always producing chicks that were
perfectly feathered when they left the nest.
This year, however, they have two chicks which flew during the
second week in July: these youngsters were fully feathered on the
head, wings, and tail, but all the rest of the body was only covered
with a fluffy grey down. They could fly like Swallows directly they
left the nest, but they certainly looked freaks. One of them is now
perfect in plumage, and the other nearly so.
I suspected that the parents had plucked them, but on examining
the nest I could not find any trace of feathers in it, so I am inclined
to think there is some other cause for the trouble.
The parents have always nested in an old coco-nut husk, hung up

in the aviary shelter ; although I have given them all sorts of nest-
boxes which I thought suitable, they evidently thought otherwise,
and always used the husk.
My Swainson's Lorikeets laid two eggs early in June, and hatched
both, incubation lasting twenty-one days. They were perfect parents,
and the chicks were coming on fine until they were twelve days' old,
when for some reason or other they both died. I have had this pair
of Lorikeets three years, always in glorious condition, but this is their
first attempt at rearing a family, and I am naturally very disappointed.
They have always been fed on the Mellin's food, honey, and condensed
milk mixture, with also a small pot of pure honey. They seem to care
very little for fruit, excepting grapes, and never touch seed at all.
We have had awfully wet and cold weather here all the " summer " :
perhaps that was the cause of the young dying ? Or, maybe, some of
our members can point out where I have gone wrong. Even Budgies
have not done so well here as usual, every nest having two or three
dead in the shells, and foreign Finches have been a failure altogether.

DEATH OF AN OLD GOLDFINCH
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990235166666667" page_id="56181989"  page_num="260" year="" vol="">
Sir, --I have just received news from my brother of the death of
a British Goldfinch, from old age, at 16J years. " Joey " was caught
by me almost seventeen years ago, as a young bird not in full colour,
and for many years lived in a small aviary with other finches. Being
so long in captivity he became very tame and confiding and was a
general favourite with all. Time had dealt very gently with the old
fellow, and he was singing almost to the end, although for the last
month he was rather feeble, sleeping a great deal. The last day of his
life he refused to eat and died during the night. This record goes to show
that although he was never a hardy bird he lived to a ripe old age
because of the care and attention bestowed on him by his owner.
A. Martin.

THE NEW BIRD HOUSE AT ST. LOUIS
By Henry M. Kennon, Curator of Birds, St. Louis Zoological Park
One of the recent outstanding events in the St. Louis Zoological
Park was the opening of the New Tropical Bird House. In this building
John E. Wallace, the architect, under the supervision of George P.
Vierheller, director of the gardens, has made a radical departure from
the stereotyped bird house of the past, incorporating in it the best
features of the old type of building as well as many new and practicable
conceptions, designed to display a large collection of tropical birds to
the best advantage ; and has constructed a bird house which, both
in beauty and in practicability, will stand as a model for many years.
The building is 203 feet over its greatest length, and is 123 feet in
depth, and comprises the tropical house proper and the flightless
wing. It abuts upon the present elephant house which, in the near
future, is to be converted into the Parrot wing.
The architecture is of the Spanish type, to conform with the other
permanent buildings of the garden, and is finished in cream stucco
with terra-cotta ornamentation. All ornamentation, both exterior
and interior, carries out the bird motif, in harmony with the purpose
of the building. Of particular note are the two large semi-circular
placques in natural colours, over the principal entrances of the building.
The placque over the entrance of the tropical house depicts a group of
both Old World and New World Flamingoes, while the one over the

262 Henry M. Kennon--The New Bird House at St. Louis
entrance of the flightless wing portrays a family group of Ostriches.
Capitals and cornices are decorated with such birds as Penguins,
Cockatoos, Owls, Peacocks, Doves, and Wild Ducks.
The tropical house contains fifty-nine cages, ranging in size from
4 ft. 7 in. by 7 feet, for small birds, to a large group cage 24 by 26
feet, which at present contains a group of Macaws and Cockatoos.
There are ten other large group cages for the display of larger or
more outstanding birds. Three of the latter cages have floors of
natural earth and are planted with tropical plants of various kinds,
as well as being furnished with naturalistic pools, so that the cages
present, as nearly as practicable, a habitat setting for the birds.
One of the greatest innovations in the house lies in the cages.
All cage fronts are constructed of plate glass bordered by narrow
strips of different types of wire mesh, depending upon the types of
birds confined therein, thus giving not only a clear, undistorted view
of the bird, but permitting the public to enjoy the song as well. This
border of wire also permits free ventilation of the cages without danger
of draughts. On all cages where the size of the glass will permit, the
glass is pivoted, allowing it to be revolved, so that both sides of the
glass can be cleaned from the outside. This is one of the most
practicable features of the entire house, for, contrary to general belief,
we have not had a bird escape from the house since it was opened.
Instead of the usual straight perches across the cages, in all cases
trees, set in movable bases of concrete and rock, are used. In addition,
in many of the cages, trees growing in pots or tubs are introduced to
carry out the habitat idea.
The partitions between the cages are of translucent plate glass,
permitting the transmission of light, but preventing pugnacious birds
from trying to fight their neighbours.
As one enters the building he is struck at once by the beauty of
the entire lay-out, and is pleasantly surprised by the entire absence
of any disagreeable odour. He meets a vista across a tropical swamp,
through a large flying cage, and into the large group cage for Macaws
and Cockatoos. The swamp is also a habitat setting, planted with
ferns, palms, and other tropical foliage and containing a series of
cascades and pools, affording a very beautiful setting for a group of

tropical wading birds. Living turtles and fish add to the faithfulness
of the picture. Separated from the swamp only by a partition of almost
invisible copper screening, the large flying cage, also planted suitably,
contains a group of many species of Finches and Wydahs, many of
whom are nesting in the cocoa-nut shells placed in the living trees.
The opposite side of this cage is of plate glass, facing the glass front
of the Macaw cage. One's impression is that he is observing groups of
birds at liberty, since there are no obtrusive bars to break the sweep
of vision, and more particularly since the front of the swamp is separated
from the public only by a low railing.
All lighting in the building is obtained from skylights placed over
the cages themselves, thus putting the birds in the most brilliant light
and the public in the subdued light.
The flightless wing contains seven cages of sufficient size to
accommodate such birds as Emus, Kheas, and Cassowaries, as well
as cage space for the smaller flightless birds.
The air in the building is changed by a battery of fans sufficiently
large to meet every emergency of ventilation. By their use the building
is kept entirely free from objectionable odour, and the air is sweet
at all times.
Due to the experience of M e . Vierheller and the ability of
Mr. Wallace, the Tropical Bird House in St. Louis ably demonstrates
that beauty of building and exhibits may be happily combined with
entire practicability for the keeping of large and varied groups of
exotic birds.

COCK-OF-THE-ROCK AT ST. LOUIS

<bodyText confidence="0.994024285714286" page_id="56182004"  page_num="263" year="" vol="">
By Henry M. Kennon, Curator of Birds
The St. Louis Zoological Gardens are fortunate in being able to
display a collection of four male Cocks-of-the-Rock (Rupicola rupicola)
in the new bird house. Two of the birds have been in the collection
for over a year, while the others were added early in the spring.
The Cock-of-the-Rock is a beautiful and striking bird. It is about
the size of a Pigeon, crested, and giving the general impression of an

intense orange colour at the first glance. The crest is composed of
a double row of fine feathers, orange, tipped with chocolate-brown, and
is capable of being drawn down so as to completely hide the beak. The
contour feathers are white with tips shading from a blood red, through
a deep orange to a pale yellow, giving the impression of a deep orange
overlying the white under-coat. Flights and tail-feathers are a deep
chocolate-brown, edged with orange and white. The upper wing coverts
have truncated tips, but the vanes extend backward with the effect
of a very long fringe. Back coverts and upper tail coverts are also
fringed. Eyes are a light brown, with a black iris, feet and legs orange,
the beak is orange shading into a light horn at the tip.
The collection is placed in a flight cage, with living plants. They
are not active birds, but they enjoy a large cage, so that they may
fly when they are so inclined. They are fed on a mixture of Mocking
Bird food, grated hard-boiled egg, grated carrots, scalded ants&apos; eggs,
and banana in the mornings, and a feed of straight fruit, usually
cherries or grapes, in the afternoon. Mealworms are given those who
will take them three times a week in winter and once a week in summer.
The birds are all finger tame, and are trained to come to the keeper&apos;s
hand for their afternoon feed. This gives an absolute check on the
condition of each bird each day. If a bird is moulting, or off its feed
for any reason, it may be coaxed into taking more food by offering it
various dainties.
There has been no serious fighting, though they are prone to dispute
for places on the keeper's hands. They fight much like Cocks, springing
up in the air, but their object is to grasp the opponent with their
powerful claws. The tip of the upper beak is quite sharp, and they
are capable of inflicting a sharp bite.
The birds have distinct personalities. They are quite jealous of
their human friends, and sulk like spoiled children if they consider
that one of the group is receiving more than his share of attention.
When sulking they draw the crest down over the beak, half-close their
eyes, and crouch on the ground with their backs to the keeper.
Generally they require quite a bit of coaxing before they will regain
their good humour.

make him the greatest attraction if one's purse could stand the original

By Maurice Amsler, M.B., F.Z.S.
I think I was first fired to keep this species by reading the late
Herbert Astley's My Birds in Freedom and Captivity. In this book
he gives a very charming account of taking a nest of these Thrushes
in the Alps, and of the subsequent history of one male, which he reared
and kept in a cage. There is also a beautiful marginal drawing of
a cock Blue Thrush, executed by the writer.
My first two pairs came to me in July, 1914, from a dealer in Austria.
These birds, owing to the upheaval of the War which followed within
a month of their arrival in London, did not get the necessary attention
which they required, and were unfortunately left out of doors during
that very cold winter. My notes at this time are very meagre and
beyond the fact that they died I have no further details. One incident
remains clear with me and it is that the Austrian did not cash my
cheque until quite a year after the war was over, when the Austrian
Exchange was so low that he must have become a millionaire in kroner.
My next attempt to obtain a true pair was during a short stay in
the Maritime Alps in the spring of 1920. None of the Italians were
at all anxious to part with their birds until the day of my departure,
when I received two or three messages through my hotel keeper,
offering me birds at exorbitant prices. Two birds, a supposed pair,
were actually brought to the hotel. Both were in dark travelling
cages, but as they appeared quite lively I determined to buy them,

and after a little haggling they became my property. When I reached
home, I found to my disappointment that the hen bird was in reality
a female of the Pied Rock-Thrush, and therefore of no use to me.
Monsieur Delacour, with his usual generosity, shortly afterwards very
kindly gave me a cock of the species. The Pied Rock-Thrush has
already been bred in captivity and the history of these two birds,
therefore, does not enter into our story.
The cock Blue Rock-Thrush lived with me for many years and won
prizes at our local shows, but for one reason or another I was never
able to obtain a satisfactory mate for him.
It was not until some three years ago, when Blue Rock-Thrushes
appeared in some numbers on the dealers' lists, that I was able to
obtain a true pair.
The cock came from Captain Rattigan and was absurdly tame.
He was obviously hand-reared and, although a full adult and there-
fore at least two years old, he always gaped like a nestling when offered
any tit-bit such as a mealworm or a spider.
The hen came from Monsieur Plocq, the well-known French
aviculturist, and on her I built great hopes as she had already nested
and incubated a clutch of eggs single-handed, when in his possession,
the eggs naturally being infertile.
All who have kept Thrushes and closely allied species know that
it is very rare that the cock and the hen can be kept together in a
cage or even in an aviary, except during the height of the breeding&apos;
season, and in my opinion this dictum applies with special force to
the Rock species, both Asiatic and European, as evidenced by a number
of marital murders which have taken place here.
These two birds were therefore kept apart during the autumn,
winter, and early spring.
Another pair which I fortunately bought as a second string were
similarly treated.
In the spring of 1930 each of the hens was turned out into a separate
aviary, and their respective cocks were placed with them, but were
confined to their wicker cages until such time as the hens appeared
thoroughly at home and presumably stronger on the wing than the
cocks. The latter were then let out for a few hours each day, and a

sharp look-out kept in order that no bullying should take place. It
was an easy matter by means of a few mealworms to make
them re-enter their cages, where they were safely shut up for
the night.
A short course of this treatment soon proved that there existed
a condition of armed neutrality and the cocks were given their entire
freedom.
For some reason or another first the cock and then the hen of the
first pair developed some wasting disease and died, to my great dis-
appointment. Both birds, when examined after death, showed a
large number of minute grey lice at the bases of their quills. Whether
these were the cause of death or not I am not certain, but I am inclined
to think that these parasites multiplied merely because the birds had
been unfit for many days, and had not taken the trouble to bathe and
keep themselves clean.
The other pair survived the 1930 season but showed no signs of
breeding. The hen was very wild and spent much of her time hiding
in a large nest-box. Shortly before their autumn moult was finished,
I caught- them and caged them up separately for the winter.
The hen was turned out into a fair-sized aviary in April of this
year. This aviary she shared with a pair of Siberian Bullfinches
and several pairs of Budgerigars. The cock was caged in this aviary
as already described, and was let out for an hour or two daily during
the early part of May.
On 12th May the hen was noticed to be building in a wicker Canary
travelling cage hung up high inside the shelter.
Just about this time the cock had been kept entirely caged up
for a few days on account of his bullying tactics, but fearing that the
hen might lay at any moment, and wishing to avoid clear eggs, I
liberated him, with the result that the almost completed nest was
promptly pulled to pieces. A deep cigar-box was hung up close to the
site of the previous nest and a new nest was built and completed by
20th May. This time the cock refrained from his destructive work.
On 24th May I found the hen sitting on four eggs. They were the
size of those of a Song Thrush, a very pale blue in colour and completely
unspotted. I made quite sure that the birds had not mated and that

268 Maurice Amsler--Breeding of the European Blue Bock-Thrush
the eggs were infertile, but my man reminded me that I was of the
same opinion a few years ago when we bred the Hermit Thrush. I
therefore left the hen undisturbed, and she in her turn did her duties
most maternally, in fact I never once saw her off the nest during the
whole of the incubation period, neither was the cock ever seen to feed
her. The cock, who was always extremely tame and inclined to be
aggressive to anyone entering the aviary, became very much more so,
in fact he was almost dangerous, and would fly on to one's shoulder
or hand and peck vigorously. I hoped that this increased savagery
was perhaps due to an instinct prompting him to drive all and sundry
from the nest, and on examining the eggs after they had been incubated
eight or nine days, I was delighted to note that they had become of
a somewhat leaden hue and that they therefore doubtless contained
embryos.
On looking into the nest again on the 4th June--a day of rejoicing
in this town--I was thrilled to find four vigorous chicks of a dark
salmon colour with small areas of black down.
Both parents were extremely secretive in their food duties, and
we had many a long wait, peeping through a specially made screen,
before we established the fact that both birds were feeding the young.
There appeared to be a certain rivalry in these duties, as a handful of
mealworms was -immediately followed by a scramble between both
parents to possess themselves of a dozen or more each, which were
taken to different ends of the aviary and there carefully beaten up
and killed before being taken to the young. Indeed, after a time it
became obvious that the hen was not being allowed to do her share.
If this was pure gallantry on the part of the male he had a peculiar
way of showing it. Also the cock appointed himself inspector of
nuisances, scavenger, etc., and as far as I could judge carried out all
the duties associated with the care and cleanliness of the nest, a task
which is no light one, with four vigorous growing Thrushes.
On 14th June one chick was found dead on the ground. He was
considerably smaller than the three in the nest, who were now ten days'
old and were covered with dark brown quills with still some black
down on their heads.
On the 20th I have a note that the cock was doing most of the

feeding and that the three young were fully feathered, and of a " mouse-
brown " colour.
On the 21st the three youngsters, who were about two-thirds
the size of their parents, left the nest.
This was a great day for the cock who, I verily believe, became
maniacal with feeding fever. I had, of course, to supply a large amount
of insect food and he was never without a supply in his beak. Neither
would he allow the hen any share in the care of the young.
By the evening of the first day I found two of the young looking
very ill indeed, and I strongly suspected from the look of their eyes
that their father had set about them, and tried to kill them because
they would not take any more food.
The cock was again caged up but, unfortunately, the hen had
apparently been discouraged, and she proved to be a poor feeder.
I was on the horns of a dilemma. If I kept the cock caged, the young
might die of starvation. If I let him out he would feed the young,
and then would jump on them and peck them, because they refused
to take more. I was determined that one at least of these young
should be reared by the parents, so chose the strongest-looking of
the three, and placed him in the wicker cage previously occupied by
his father.
The other two we tried to hand-rear, as they appeared very weak,
and were being neglected by both parents. In this we failed,
although I have frequently hand-reared much more difficult species.
I expect the injuries they had received proved too much for them.
The young bird in the cage progressed quite satisfactorily as he
received ample food from his father through the cage bars, but was
safe from any subsequent attack when he had had enough.
Within two days of leaving the nest all three of these young birds
had shown an inclination to feed themselves, and would pick up live
ants and their eggs from the aviary floor. By throwing a handful of
eggs and ants into the cage I very soon induced our youngster to feed
himself, and by 30th June, nine days after he had left the nest, he was
caged up with twelve Blue Kobins a little more advanced than him-
self, who very shortly taught him to bathe and to feed on the insectile
stock mixture.

Maurice. Amsler--More Notes on Blue Robins
His colour at this date was a plumbeous grey, with very slight
streakings on the breast, and even at the present date, 8th August,
I find very little to indicate the sex of this bird, who has grown into
a fine specimen quite as large as either of his parents.
Shortly after the removal of our survivor, the hen again tried to
build, but the cock once more pulled the nest to pieces, and this ended
any hope of a second brood for this season.
If all goes well in 1932 I shall take the first brood at ten or twelve
days' old. There should be no difficulty in hand-rearing. Possibly
the cock will not be so excitable and over-zealous if they have the good
fortune to rear a second nestful.
Dr. Hopkinson tells me that he can find no record of this species
having been bred previously in captivity, either in Great Britain or
Europe. Whether the feat has been accomplished before or not, I
do not think there is any likelihood of the market being flooded with

A recent request on the part of our Editor for notes on this species
must be my excuse for the following account of successes and failures
for the seasons of 1930-31. Personally, I should have thought that I
had sufficiently written up this species for some time to come.
I started the 1930 season with two pairs--No. 1 pair the old
originals who have been here since 1926, and No. 2 pair which
some leaders will remember were given their liberty in 1929 and which
reared some eight youngsters in that season.
To cut a long story short nine young were reared to independence,
but of these five died during the late summer of some wasting disease,
possibly enteritis. I shall have more to say about this later.
My liberty pair hatched out and reared their first nest in their
little aviary, the door of which was left constantly open, parents and
young being caged up just before the young were ready to fly. As
soon as the latter were independent the old birds were put back into

their aviary and, of course, shut in. A week later I made the mistake
of putting the five young in an adjacent aviary, with the result that
the cock, recognizing his offspring, spent much of his time feeding
them through the wire netting. Here I made a fatal mistake. Thinking
the old birds would stay, both on account of their nest-box and also
because of their young, I opened their aviary door prematurely, with
the result that the cock spent that night somewhere outside. Had I
been as wise then as I am now, I should have put the hen in the cage
inside the aviary and used her as a decoy, but I felt almost certain,
after their behaviour of last year, that neither bird would stray.
The following day the hen left her nest where she was about to
lay, joined the cock who had reappeared, and within an hour or two
both birds had gone. They had completely forgotten both their young
and my box of mealworms. I hunted for them and I advertised for
them. The result of the latter was a number of messages saying that
the birds had been seen, but descriptions given me would have suited
anything from a Blue Tit to a hen Blackbird, and never tallied with
that of a Blue Robin.
No further news did I get of my truants until some four weeks
after their escape when both birds were quite definitely seen and
described to me by the Matron at the Eton College Sanatorium. A
workman who lives quite close to that building, and who is a keen bird
watcher, declares that he saw the pair with four young on several
occasions during September and October. These young appeared
less and less frequently, and it is possible that they either strayed or
met with untimely deaths, probably the former.
The last news I had of my birds was in February of this year, when
one or other was again seen at the Sanatorium. I lent the Matron a
pair of Blue Birds in a cage which were hung up each day close to the
spot where the old bird had been seen, but he never repeated his visit
and I fear is lost for good.
We know that Blue Robins are migratory in their own country,
and it is interesting to note that one at least of the escaped birds
presumably remained in the neighbourhood and survived the whole
of a fairly mild but distinctly changeable winter.
This year I started my season with three pairs of birds. The old

pair as usual, and two of my own hens bred in 1930, mated to cocks
which I had obtained by exchange.
One of these young pairs showed signs of carrying while still caged
up in February. I gave them a nest-box and building materials.
A nest was quickly built and five eggs were laid. As the cock never
attempted to feed the hen according to the invariable custom of this
species when mated, I suspected that the eggs would be clear, which
in fact they proved to be.
Later this same young pair laid again in an aviary. Their eggs
were transferred to a Robin's nest and were successfully reared.
A later clutch was treated in the same way and three chicks were
again brought up.
My second young pair were unproductive, for the reason that
the cock died early in the Spring.
The old pair laid early in April, the first clutch being again placed
under wild Robins. But I have to record failure here owing to the fact
that the wild birds' eggs were much more advanced than those I placed
in their stead.
The second clutch in mid-May were also placed under Redbreasts,
and on this occasion I was unable to catch the wild birds when the
time came to take the nest, with the result that these had to be hand-
reared.
During the latter part of May, I strongly suspected the old cock
Blue Bird of interfering with a nest of Roller Canaries, but on more
careful investigation I found, to my amazement, that he was feeding
these young birds with mealworms. Whether this is suitable diet
or not for birds of the Serin tribe these youngsters throve amazingly.
Even after they had left the nest for some days the Blue Bird continued
his attentions, but he then found it much more difficult to administer
the mealworms to the young Canaries when perching than he had
when they were still in the nest. Each mealworm, after being
thoroughly broken up and given to the Canary was usually dropped
to the aviary floor two or three times before it was successfully
swallowed.
Seeing how keen this cock was to feed young, I determined to give
the pair a chance of rearing their own young. Their next clutch of

eggs was therefore left to them, and on 22nd June five young
were hatched. I determined that if the young began to disappear
or die I would transfer nest-box and parents to a large cage.
On the 29th I found one chick dead in the comer of the box and
on the following day the birds and young were transferred to a cage,
my idea being that in confined quarters the old birds would have no
outside temptations, and nothing to think about but the feeding of
their young. The experiment was successful to a point but the young
were late in leaving the nest, and were under-sized when they did so.
None of them was fully reared, the cause of death in one case being
reported as enteritis.
I have lost this season at least four youngsters from a disease
which I cannot diagnose unless it be a form of avian poli-neuritis.
The bird appears to have a stiff neck, the head being turned markedly
to one side. It loses its power of flight and the legs become weak
and stiff. Unless destroyed they often linger in this state for many
days. Although my feeding is identical with that of previous years
this is my first experience of this type of disease amongst young
softbills.
I read somewhere, earlier in the season, of a breeder who mentioned
the loss of a young Blue Robin from some injury to its neck, and
I strongly suspect that this bird died of the disease which I have
just described.
To refer back to the loss of young birds last season--when five
birds out of nine died when two or three months old, and also to three
or four which died this year, all very much wasted and suffering from
what one must call enteritis--I feel certain that the condition is at any
rate partly due to an over generous supply of mealworms, and I think
it would be wiser in the early stages of the birds' independent fife to
withhold the supply of mealworms as soon as possible, although there
is no objection to the youngsters being given half a dozen each daily.
We have noticed that my own youngsters of this season have improved
very greatly since we adopted this procedure.

By the Marquess of Tavistock
During the years that I confined my avicultural ventures entirely
to Finches and Parrakeets, I regarded those people who kept the choicer
species of insectivorous and fruit-eating birds with a reverence akin
to awe ; much like that, indeed, with which the angler with the
humble worm may be supposed to view the expert performer with
the dry fly. But having now begun, not without much initial fear
and trepidation, to keep a few softbills myself, the conviction is slowly
but surely gaining possession of my mind that, if anything, the boot
is on the other leg. There are some very difficult softbills, certainly,
as there are also seed-eaters, that are well-nigh impossible to keep
in health ; but as far as I have been able to observe insectivorous
and nectar-feeding species, even those with a reputation for being
somewhat tricky, are far less subject to that trinity of unpreventable
ills--pneumonia, septicaemia, and enteritis--which make the summer
and autumn months a time of sickness and casualties in any large
mixed collection of Parrakeets not kept in close confinement. It may
sound strange, yet it is undoubtedly a fact that where I am now living
King Birds of Paradise thrive better than King Parrakeets and
Sunbirds flourish where Pedrumps or Grass Parrakeets die within
a few weeks. Sugar Birds and Fairy Blue Birds prosper, but Gouldians,
Avadavats, and Orange-breasted Waxbills do not.
My only Tanager--a Superb--who, I suppose, comes mid-way
between softbills and Finches, is in lovely condition, sharing an aviary
all the year round with an old Hodgson's Slatey-headed Parrakeet
and his Plum-head mate. Last winter I was somewhat puzzled by
a curious lump of feathers that appeared on the Tanager's abdomen
and had he seemed at all out of sorts I should have feared a growth
or injury. The phenomenon was explained by a friend with more
experience of Colliste Tanagers kept under open-air conditions, who
told me that he had found that they grew an immensely thick crop
of feathers, much as some tropical mammals produce quite heavy
winter coats in temperate climates. I should, however, add that,
while the Tanager has access to the open air even in the coldest

weather, the shelter itself is heated. He is fed on fruit, mealworms
and Sunbird mixture, the withdrawal of the latter from the menu
producing disastrous consequences in the case of three other specimens
of the same species which had thrived as long as they were similarly
fed. Under indoor conditions, I believe that Sunbird mixture proves
too fattening, but it is essential for birds kept outside. I have at
present three species of Sunbirds, all of them in aviaries. The Malayan
Green Sunbirds ( Anthothrectis simplex ) I am getting rid of. They
are too " simplex " to be worth the bother of preparing, food for,
the hen (?) being the colour of a Hedge-sparrow, while the cock (?)
is only adorned with an inconspicuous mask of yellowish green on
the breast. They seem hardy enough. The dealer actually sent
them a long journey in a cardboard box with no syrup and only half
a stale orange for nutriment. Although this treatment would have
killed any ordinary Sunbird ten times over, they reached me but
little the worse. The day after their arrival I turned them into a
large cage, which so cheered the hen that two days later I was only
just in time to prevent her from murdering her companion. A. simplex
has a rather wicked-looking reddish eye which apparently does not
belie its character. Like other Sunbirds it is very fond of spiders
and small insects.
Two cock Purple Sunbirds, the kind gift of Mr. Godfrey Davis,
have occupied aviaries for some years. One is showing signs of age,
though still in good health and spirits. He lives quite happily with
a pair of Porphyry-crowned Lorikeets. The other is in the prime
of life and full of impudence, and next season I hope to mate him
with a nice hen Mr. Godfrey Davis brought back for me this summer.
Until recently he has shared an aviary with a pair of Worcester's
Hanging Parrots, who kept him in his place when he tried to be cheeky.
After the escape of the cock Worcester I put a Golden-backed Hanging
Parrot with the hen, but the Sunbird recognized him as a stranger
at once and began to take liberties with him, finally making himself
so unpleasant that the Golden-back was quite afraid of him, and I was
obliged to put him with an old Princess of Wales who ignores him,
but whom he dare not molest. When in eclipse plumage from July
to mid-winter he is not very striking, a nondescript greyish brown

The Marquess of Tavistock--Various Softhills
with a yellowish white breast and a dark line running down the middle.
In his wedding garment of glittering blue-black he is a very handsome
little fellow indeed with quite a cheery song. When in pursuit of
spiders he sometimes settles on the ground and even hops about,
a mode of progression that looks strange in a species usually strictly
arboreal.
The little Scarlet Sunbird (Sipa rajah) is one of the treasures of
the collection and is, I believe, the first to be imported. He arrived
last winter and now shares an aviary with a hen Broadbill. He is
quite a tiny bird, smaller and much more slender than the Purple, j
and now that he is through the moult is very lovely. His head and
mantle are crimson changing into scarlet on the throat and upper
breast. The wings and rear part of the body are brown, while the
crown, tail, and two long lines of feathers running downwards from
the angle of the beak are dark, metallic blue. There is a spot of yellow
near the base of the tail. I was a little afraid that he might lose his
red colour, but Asiatic Sunbirds, I am told, are less prone to do so
than the African species and in any case the sole right of hunting a
fair-sized aviary for insects and spiders should provide him with all
the live food he requires. His partiality for spiders almost proved
his undoing for, while endeavouring to swallow a largish one I had
given him while he was still in a cage, he as nearly as possible choked
himself !
His companion, the Broadbill, has alas ! been many times widowed.
These beautiful birds are certainly not easy to keep. The cock who
came over with her two years ago did not survive many weeks. A
particularly fine specimen that reached me last winter was, through
a sad accident, roasted to death at the same time as a promising
Red-and-black Broadbill--a quaint, Barbet-like bird insectivorous
in diet. A third cock did well for a time and then got aspergillosis,
I am afraid from mealworms kept in a box with mouldy vegetable
matter. A fourth lived long enough to join the hen in the aviary,
but succumbed to jaundice during the summer. Although criticized
by some people for their sluggishness, Green Broadbills are quite
active and interesting when they are not kept in a cage containing
only two hard perches at opposite ends. Strictly arboreal in their

habits they are almost helpless on the ground and some individuals
cannot learn to bathe from a dish. They will, however, bathe in
a leafy branch that has been well sprayed with water or they may enjoy
being sprayed direct, if tame. When kept in an aviary Broadbills
need firm branches with rather stout twigs ; if caged, a number of
perches a few inches apart are said to encourage exercise. The only
food my Green Broadbills would ever touch was chopped banana
and mealworms. The fruit should be cut into clean, firm sections
and not mashed, or the bird's beak gets messed up. A little hard-
boiled egg sprinkled over the fruit is said to be beneficial. Broadbills
are very gentle birds and seem incapable of inflicting any injury on
their companions. Although he survived much longer than any of
the others imported at the same time, my Hose's Broadbill has also
joined the majority. C. hosei is a very striking bird, larger than the
Green Broadbill, with some deep blue in the centre of the breast and
extraordinary black spots curiously arranged on head, nape, and
wings which resemble nothing so much as ink blots. The shape of
the head, the rather long neck, and the drooping hackle on the rump
are almost suggestive of a fowl and one of my children remarked that
the bird " looked rather like a green chicken ". On first arrival the
Broadbill seemed exhausted and out of condition from the hardships
of his journey and began to look miserable whenever the temperature
dropped near 70* Fahrenheit. By keeping him at an even 85*,
however, I soon got him into tight plumage and better spirits. He
hopped about actively in the long cage in which I placed him, some-
times attempted to bathe, and devoured large quantities of chopped
banana, pear, and pumpkin, refusing mealworms. The only call I heard
him utter was a Dove-like cooing. We discovered after a while that
he was infested with tapeworm parasites, which doubtless lowered
his vitality, although for some time he seemed to be thriving and
made good progress with a healthy moult. In February, however,
to my great regret, I heard that he had died suddenly of enteritis,
and I rather suspect that during my absence the temperature of the
room in which he lived was allowed to fall too low. Fairy Blue Birds,
with me, as with others, have so far proved exceedingly easy to keep
.and there is little doubt that this handsome bird is one of the most

desirable of the larger foreign softbills. For tbe benefit of those to
whom the species is not familiar, I may say that Irene turcosa rather
resembles a short-legged Thrush with a stout black beak and a red
eye (brown in immatures of both sexes). The adult cock has the
upper part of the head and neck, the mantle, rump, and very long
tail-coverts the most gorgeous turquoise blue with a wonderful gloss,
just like enamel, the remainder of the plumage being black. The
hens and immature males are a uniform grey-blue of a shade that
recalls the plumage of a Blue Rock Thrush. Unfortunately hens seem
to be very rarely captured, a consignment of young birds, all moulting
into male plumage with the regularity of Plum-headed Parrakeets !
Last winter I obtained what I hoped were a pair, a belief strengthened
by the fact that the 44 hen " was very much the master and bullied
the fine old cock as long as they were caged together. After a few
months, however, " she " began to grow black feathers and I changed
4 4 her " for another supposed female. Although it was still early
in the year I had judged it safe to transfer the adult cock from a cage
to a warmed shelter communicating with an outdoor flight. In this
rather gloomy residence he continued to thrive, though for months
he never came out into the open. When the new bird was in good
order I turned it in with him. At first he displayed great terror,
obviously remembering the bad treatment he received from his former
cage mate before I separated them, but as the new arrival did not
seem disposed to molest him I left them together. They agreed fairly
well and in the end the old cock made himself master. His companion
proved of a more venturesome disposition than he and came out into
the flight fairly often. I even saw it sitting outside singing during
a snowstorm--not a bad effort for an unmoulted fairly recent
importation ! While not in the first rank as a songster, the Fairy Blue
Bird is not without vocal merit. The usual call-note is a loud 44 Twit! "
and the song, which is uttered by both sexes and appears to be an
expression of content or pleasureable excitement rather than a challenge
or love lyric, consists of a rapid series of cheery, loud twitting and
bubbling notes with an occasional soft note interspersed.
Just when I was hoping that I possessed a satisfactory pair, black
feathers again began to appear on the throat of the supposed female.

This time I was able to obtain, by exchange, a certain hen which
had been some years at the Zoological Gardens. Knowing the nasty
habit that the different sexes of many medium-sized softbills possess
of murdering each other when they are associated out of the breeding
season, I looked forward to the introduction of the lady with some
trepidation. The meeting, however, went off most pleasantly. The
cock at once recognized the genuine article and showed as much
pleasure as he had previously shown alarm at the hooligan young
fellows whose society we had inflicted on him ; and the hen, although
she rules the menage, behaved with becoming good humour.
The lengthening days of spring eventually tempted the cock
Blue Bird to forsake his retirement and display his gorgeous colours
in the open. I fixed up some thick branches inside the aviary shelter
and in the flight and hung supplies of twigs, moss, and feathers where
the birds could easily reach them without going on to the ground, for
the Fairy Blue Bird is as strictly arboreal as a Broadbill and just
as clumsy and unhappy on a flat surface.
Towards the end of June the hen began to carry nesting material
about but did not appear to settle down, and I had rather given up
hope of anything happening when early in August the aviary
attendant missed her and found her sitting on two eggs in a rather
untidy moss nest on a branch in the aviary shelter. She sat very
steadily for nearly three weeks, coming off two or three times a day
to feed and preen herself, her appearance being greeted by a loud burst
of song from her mate. One day, however, she seemed to be losing
interest in her home and on looking at the nest I found only one egg,
the other having completely vanished. A few days later she deserted
altogether and looking again I found the egg cracked. It contained
a partly-formed chick. The result was disappointing, but it is
perhaps something to have obtained fertile eggs so soon after the
bird's arrival.
Irene turcosa is not difficult to cater for, feeding on insectile
mixture, chopped lettuce, and almost any kind of fruit, wild or
cultivated. Mealworms are not greatly relished, though I have seen
the female eating wasps and large flies. I have not tried my birds in
mixed company, but others have not found them unduly spiteful.

The Marquess of Tavistock--Various Softhills
A pair of Yellow-winged Sugar Birds and a pair of Royal Starlings
are fairly new arrivals ; both so far have given no cause for anxiety.
The Starlings share a large aviary with Black Cockatoos, who show no
disposition to molest them.
My most venturesome plunge in softbill aviculture was to invest
last winter in a pair of King Birds of Paradise. The wonderful
combination of red velvet and white in the cock's plumage makes
him, to my mind, the loveliest of his genus. The birds had moulted in
captivity, the hen coming from America, where she was said to have
shown an inclination to nest; while the cock had been some time on
deposit at the Zoo. I was none too sure how things were going to
progress. One friend told me that King Birds of Paradise usually
died suddenly when in perfect plumage ; another that they came
out in patches of red of different shades if subjected to changes of
temperature when moulting. A third that they fought far worse than
Robins and two were never seen together in a wild state, unless
quarrelling !
While remaining fully prepared to find one or both dead or maimed
to-morrow morning, I am glad to say that so far they have not given
me much cause for anxiety. On first arrival I housed them separately
in long flight cages where they took plenty of exercise, feeding them
on insectile mixture, grated carrot, fruit, and about half a dozen
mealworms each per day. The hen is tame and will take food from the
hand, but her mate is more suspicious. The birds did very well in
the quarters provided for them and improved in appearance. In only
one respect did the cock disappoint me. I had read that the King
Bird of Paradise, when displaying, bursts into a lovely liquid song
recalling that of a Skylark. So far my cock has only burst into a
noise that suggests a Parrakeet being netted during the progress of
a cat fight!
In May the birds began to moult and the hen, who finished first,
was transferred at midsummer to one of my movable outdoor aviaries.
The cock joined her in July and to our relief there were no unseemly
squabbles ; indeed they seem very good friends. I have had only
one bad fright with them. One morning, on looking the birds over
soon after letting them out, I could see no sign of the cock King. Closer

search revealed him on the ground motionless in the wet grass.
" That," said I to myself " is the end of breeding King Birds of
Paradise ! " I went in and caught him without difficulty as he seemed
unable to fly, but when I put him in a cage in the hospital he jumped
about so alertly that it seemed difficult to detect much the matter,
save that his bowels seemed a trifle out of order. A couple of meal-
worms were eaten as soon as I was hidden, but still I expected that
time would reveal something seriously wrong. However, it did not,
and in a few days it became evident that he was perfectly all right.
I then began to wonder if the hen had been giving him some of the
Bobin treatment, but my aviary attendant was sure that they were
on good terms. I put him back in the aviary, feeling certain that she
would go for him on seeing him again if there had been any domestic
trouble. But when he was let out of the cage he flew into the shelter
and on seeing the hen addressed a long greeting to her in a series of
conversational cat-calls, to which she listened with amiable attention.
I can only conclude, therefore, that long grass is a phenomenon as
puzzling to Birds of Paradise as to Hanging Parrots and that, having
entered it to bathe as a substitute for wet leaves, he became somewhat
draggled and utterly confused. I have now cut the grass and there
has been no further trouble of any kind. Unfortunately, as is common
with the genus when kept in aviaries, the birds live largely in the
shelter, the cock even more so than the hen. Even in this summer
that phenomenon the sun, so abhorred by Birds of Paradise, has been
sufficiently in evidence to keep them largely in retirement.
My own brief experience and more prolonged observation of what
goes on in other collections, public and private, strongly inclines one
to the opinion that the secret of success with all Paradise Birds is
plenty of fresh air, plenty of exercise, and a rational and not too rich
diet. In collections like Mr. Whitley's, I see year after year the same
old friends belonging to species that are often reputed to be hard to
manage. In other collections where the birds are closely confined
and kept in a stuffy atmosphere, there are frequent gaps and changes.

THE NESTING OF DERBYAN AND LAYARD'S
PARRAKEETS

By the Marquess of Tavistock
Although complete success in breeding has been attained by
Dr. Patrick in California, the fine Parrakeet introduced to aviculture
by Mr. Eustace's efforts has not proved so easy to manage as some
of us at first expected and hoped. Although quite indifferent to winter
cold cock Derbyans, especially, seem difficult to moult in an outdoor
aviary and only careful watching and a well-appointed hospital room
averts disaster during the late summer and autumn months. My
cock, although to all appearances a vigorous bird, has got ill some
time or other during the course of each successive moult. Hens appear
more robust and my present female has never had anything the matter
with her since her arrival. She was, and still is, exceedingly nervous,
but the cock is quite friendly and will take food from the hand and
display to a human acquaintance.
During the summer of 1930 the pair were looked after for me
by Mr. Boosey at Keston. They showed some inclination to breed,
but never really settled down. Last winter they were transferred to
one of my movable aviaries at Peasmarsh and amused themselves,
after the manner of their kind, by destroying their perches with an
assiduity only equalled by Cockatoos. In April I gave them a grand-
father clock nest-box, which was completely ignored, but the
introduction of a taller box of similar type with the top covered inside
and out, down to the nest level, with natural bark, met with more
favourable notice. It is an interesting fact that Derbyans, in common
with all other Parrot-like birds that are tremendous wood-eaters,
do not seriously damage a box they really like the look of as
a prospective nursery. If your birds, on the introduction of the nest,
start gnawing huge cavities all over it, you may take it as a sign that
in their opinion a thing like that is only good for exercising beaks on
and you must employ your ingenuity in providing something more
pleasing to the psittacine aesthetic sense.
When beginning to come into breeding condition the cock Derbyan
has a habit I have not noticed in other members of the genus of driving

the hen about rather in the manner of a Pigeon, and then stopping
after a while and showing off to her.
The display is very comical. The cock begins by drawing himself
up and turning his head sharply to right or left, tilting one eye slightly
towards the heavens. Then he makes as though he were about to
rub his beak on the perch and repeats both actions, frequently turning
round as he does so. As he works himself up to a greater pitch of
excitement he begins to squirm about in an extraordinary fashion,
standing first on one leg and then the other, and clawing at the back
of his neck with the disengaged foot. He also brings up food from his
crop and the hen may lean forward expectantly, but more often than
not she is disappointed, as he seems to take a delight in tantalizing
her with regurgitational efforts that produce no practical result.
At the climax of the display he may either remain more or less rigid
or make a slow, deep bow like a Malabar Parrakeet, while the pupil
of his eye is reduced to a mere pin-point and the iris blazes like white
fire. When the hen is feeling in a responsive mood she begins, towards
the close of the display, to butt the cock roughly, but affectionately,
in the chest and keep rubbing her head against him. Unfortunately,
although he seemed very much in breeding condition, and displayed
continually for nearly six weeks before the hen laid at the end of June,
I do not believe the cock ever actually paired with her. She sat steadily
for the full time but the two eggs proved to be infertile.
Derbyan Parrakeets are very handsome birds and are possessed
of character and intelligence. A tame cock I sent to the Zoological
Gardens always recognizes and greets me, distinguishing me from
among countless visitors, even though I did not make a particular
pet of him while I had him. Unfortunately, however, to the two
drawbacks of destructiveness and occasional delicacy, a third must
be added--an exceedingly loud and raucous voice !
For several years I have had one or two specimens of the rarely
imported Layard's Parrakeet of Ceylon, but little success has attended
my efforts at breeding. For some years I had a single adult male,
but before others of his species were obtained he had died of old age.
A second cock suffered from fits and did not survive very long, but
the two hens that accompanied him had strong constitutions and most

savage tempers. The older one paired with a cock Plum-head and
had a nest of infertile eggs before she made her escape while attacking
the aviary attendant, an Owl ending her career before she could be
recaptured. The younger hen was also provided with a Plum-head
mate and for several years used to inspect a log as though intending
to nest but never got as far as eggs. She, in common with nearly all
my Asiatic Parrakeets of the Ringneck family, got her toes frost-
bitten during the very severe cold of the winter 1928-9, but, though
spoiled as a show bird, she was not permanently lamed. In 1930
I required the Plum-head as a mate for a hen of his own species and
purchased " a magnificent cock Plum-head " from a dealer. The
miserable specimen that arrived was not very well received by the
Layard and as soon as the poor creature got ill she decided to terminate
so unprofitable an alliance and slaughtered him before the aviary
attendant noticed that trouble was brewing.
Last autumn I obtained two more cock Layards and succeeded
in getting one moulted and acclimatized during the course of the
winter. When he appeared in good fettle I caught the hen and put
her in his aviary. She was furiously angry at the indignity of being
netted as she likes to pose as a really dangerous bird, and I am sure
tells her neighbours that we are all mortally afraid of her ! The cock
began to display and make himself agreeable in the most polite fashion,
but she glowered sulkily at him and when he came within reach made
a savage rush at him and soon began driving him about so ferociously
that I deemed it wise to remove her lest he should share the fate of
the Plum-head. As soon as I released her in another aviary she went
and examined a nest-box to show me that her objection to my
matrimonial plans were just to spite me and not because nesting was
not yet in her mind !
After waiting several weeks I made another attempt, this time
turning the cock into her aviary, so that her dignity might be preserved
and she might have no excuse for being out of humour at the critical
moment. When the cock called to her and began to display she
answered him and for a moment seemed inclined to be friendly ;
then, realizing, I am sure, that if she relented she would give satisfaction
to her hated owner, she turned on him as viciously as before. Again

and again he tried to pacify with fair words and courtly gestures and
by bringing up food from his crop, but she got more and more furious
and soon he was badly scared and flying for his life. Thinking that
perhaps he was personally distasteful to her I removed him and
introduced the other cock. He, too, tried to make himself agreeable
and he too was soon in danger of his life. Thoroughly disgusted with
the little vixen and knowing that, like the Duchess' Baby, " She only
did it to annoy because she knows it teases "---for she was quite in
breeding condition--I told the aviary attendant to inflict upon her
the punishment reserved for dangerous wife-beaters and cut her wing
so short that she could only fly with difficulty. The next time she
went for the cock she gave herself a nasty fall which was no more than
she deserved, though any chances of nesting appeared definitely
removed until 1932 ; a shy breeder even when full-winged, it seemed
certain that she would do nothing with her lower flight curtailed.
It was several weeks before she and the cock were on reasonably
friendly terms, but at the end of May I was rather surprised to see
him feeding her and the provision of a nest of the same type as the
Derbyans' aroused a somewhat lukewarm interest. However, as
her usual time for moulting was already at hand, I still felt sure that
nothing more would be done. About the middle of June I was very
disappointed to hear that the cock Layard had died suddenly of
pneumonia--that tiresome scourge so prevalent in summer, so rare
during the colder weather--and as I had given the second cock to
Mr. Ezra I was once more left without breeding hopes or prospects.
I thereupon made up my mind to get rid of the hen also, as I was
weary of her abortive pretences at nesting and of her most evil temper.
(It is curious how one grows tired, even of a rare bird, if it
has a thoroughly unpleasant character !) But Mrs. Layard, aided by
the evil spirits with which she is undoubtedly in league, was more
than equal to the occasion. Regardless of the fact that she was recently
bereaved ; regardless of the fact that her wing had been cut at the
beginning of the breeding season ; regardless of the fact that she was
long overdue to moult; regardless of the fact that during the course
of five years' happy matrimony with Plum-head No. 1 she had never
been able to lay ; even as I hardened my heart against her, the little

M. Decoux's collection of birds is certainly well known to the
readers of the Avicultural Magazine, as during the last twelve
or fifteen years it has been described several times and many accounts
of the keeping and breeding of rare birds in his aviaries have
appeared in our pages.
In 1928 (p. 259), Mr. Ezra gave us a short description of the
collection ; I shall only add a few comments and point out additions
made since.
M. Decoux started keeping birds as a boy, more than twenty-five
years ago, always specializing in small ones, such as Passerine Birds,
Parrakeets and Pigeons. Of a more careful and studious aviculturist
I do not know, nor of a more successful one in keeping in perfect
health and breeding these groups of birds. His successes have been
so numerous that I can only say here that they apply to different
species of Tanagers, Turdidce, Timeliidce, and to numerous true Finches
and Weavers, without mentioning several species of Parrakeets and
Doves. This season, M. Decoux has bred the following birds :--
Parrakeets. --Crimson-wing (seven from two pairs) ; Bed-rumped,
Stanley's, Yellow-bellied (five) ; Bauer's (two broods, one in February);
Mealy Kosellas (three) ; and many Nyasa, Black-faced, Fischer's
and Masked Lovebirds; hybrids Fischer's and Peach-faced; and
various shades of Budgerigars. Swifts, which were reared successfully
last year, failed to rear the first brood, but are nesting again.

small groups. All are well built of slender iron posts and fine mesh
netting, with substantial, but unheated shelters, with the exception
of a few. On the left of the house, one finds first a row of six roomy
flights, some thickly planted, others bare, according to whether they
are occupied by Doves and small birds, or by Parrakeets. Some
way further on, there are many movable Parrakeet aviaries, designed
after Lord Tavistock's plans but made of iron instead of wood,
and therefore more permanent and also more pleasing to the eye.
On the right side of the house, in a flower garden, there are several
small isolated aviaries for small Parrakeets and Doves. Then comes
a block composed of one large and high flight, with a spacious indoor
house, thickly planted, where Waxbills and other small birds live in
numbers ; this is the first aviary that M. Decoux built, many years
ago, and where scores of species have reared their young. On each
side there are five and six small compartments, each containing a pair
of small Lorrikeets, Parrakeets and often also some Finches ; these
are heated in the winter. In a meadow there is a large flight, full
of thick trees and bushes, where many pairs of different .Pigeons and
small birds breed freely ; not far from it one sees several more
Parrakeet aviaries. The installation is completed by a good-sized

bird room, well heated, with several fixed aviaries and many cages.
Thereto M. Decoux removes a few of his most delicate birds during
the winter and in it he also keeps all his pets and cage-birds, such as
Tanagers, Sugar-birds, Sun-birds, various Starlings, Toucans, Jays,
and other middle-sized and small insectivorous and frugivorous species,
and also song birds. All the birds are most carefully watched and
tended under their owner's constant supervision; and remain
in perfect condition.
If one thought that the climate of this part of central France is
favourable to bird-keeping, he would be greatly mistaken; the
Limousin province, where Gery is situated, is very comparable to the
more hilly part of northern England for aspect as well as climate.
Standing at an altitude of about some 1,000 feet, it is a very pretty
country of rolling hills, with numerous hedges, woods and isolated
trees, damp and rather cold the greatest part of the year, with a very
uncertain summer. Under such circumstances, the credit of breeding
difficult birds is just as great for M. Decoux as it would be in Derbyshire
or Yorkshire, for example.
A remarkable point is that, at Gery, there are nearly always quite
a few pairs of breeding birds kept together successfully, such as one
pair of Parrakeets, one pair of Doves and some of small birds, or in
other cases, pairs of four or five different species of Doves in the same
aviary. The results, however, are satisfactory, as the birds are watched
carefully and also associated according to habits, and even to
individual temper. Care is taken to avoid associating closely related
species or those with similar habits.

Sir, --Your readers will, I am sure, be interested to know that my
second nest of Hybrids--Bronze Mannikin--St. Helena Waxbill--
has come through successfully, and this time I have three young birds
which have just left the nest, and look very strong and flourishing.
I hope later on to submit a photograph of them for the Magazine.

Meanwhile, I am sending a photograph of a nest of young from my
pair of St. Helenas. You will see they are a fine sturdy lot of youngsters.
The nest was built in the outside aviary, in a wooden nesting-box.
The whole clutch of eight eggs was hatched, and when one forward
youngster left the nest I thought it safer to move the nest-box into
the Bird-room. I imagined I had three or four young birds at the most,
you can imagine my astonished and delighted feelings when in the
middle of the operation the whole family decided to leave the nest
and investigate the outside world. As they flew out, one after the other,
it literally seemed to be raining young birds, and I wondered if my eyes
were deceiving me, or whether I was dreaming. Anyway it was a
fact, and I counted up eight, with agitated parents helping to locate
them.
Is this almost a record number ? I lost one bird, I suppose the last
one to hatch, as he was decidedly smaller. The other seven are all
in the photograph.
The parents have been wonderful in feeding, and, for my part,
I have made it my duty and pleasure to help them in their arduous
task. Early rising to procure live food, which mainly consisted of
the meadow ant egg (there was always a good supply of this food in
the aviary), in fact, I must have been a source of curiosity, being always
armed with a trowel and tin box. In addition to this I gave sponge
cake and egg, with green fly brushed into it, and plenty of seeding
grasses.
I have a nest of four Bichenos, which have left the nest to-day,
so I am quite pleased with my breeding results this season.

RARE FINCHES

<bodyText confidence="0.997659" page_id="56182040"  page_num="289" year="" vol="">
Sir, --In the August number of the Magazine Dr. Hopkinson
mentioned two Finches which he had seen in my possession in July,
1930. Both birds are alive and well although the Neorhynchus has
now been imported nearly three years.
The Neorhynchus is certainly not nasesus. When I first obtained
the pair (the hen died before Dr. Hopkinson saw the cock) I compared
them with the skins at South Kensington. In N. nasesus the cock is

a grey or rather black and white bird about the size and very similar
in marking to the little White-throated Grosbeak. My bird is much
longer on the leg, slightly larger and is distinctly brown, the mantle
and rump being almost chestnut, the flights and tail feathers being
edged with very dark brown or black. The hen was not nearly so
bright and had a dark horn-coloured beak, the cock's beak being
black. The only two species of Neorhynchus represented at South
Kensington are nasesus and a much smaller sub-species of almost
exactly similar colour.
The other bird mentioned in Dr. Hopkinson's letter, Sporophila
ruficollis is a very fine songster for his size and is one of those satisfactory
birds which always seems to keep in paint-like plumage. He came into
my possession about a year and a half ago with a very fine specimen
of Sporophila minuta parva, the smallest of all the Grosbeaks. I sold
this latter bird to our member, Miss K. Gamble, who still has it, I
believe.
S. ruficollis is undoubtedly a fully mature cock. South Kensington
has only one skin of this little Grosbeak and that is, I should say,
an immature cock. I cannot say if any of the other collections of
skins are better provided with specimens. The colour and marking
of S. ruficollis is so very distinctive and different to that of any other
of Sporophila that once seen no mistake could be made in identification.
Another bird which I have obtained since Dr. Hopkinson visited
me is a Finch-like Cowbird, Molothrus fringillaria, knowm, I believe,
as the Pale Cowbird. South Kensington boasts only one skin of this
bird, obtained in Mexico about 50 years ago. A shorter and more
robust bird than most of the Molothrus.
I shall be pleased to show these three birds to anyone interested
if they care to call and see me but they are not for sale.

belongs to, I know there are three or four ; I purchased him with a few
odd Waxbills out of sheer pity. The Bengalese for two or three months
kspt very much together, when the Nutmeg Finch got bolder and
demanded admittance to the nest. A fortnight ago four charming
brown birds were flying about the aviary, with Father Nutmeg and both
Bengalese taking great care of them. In shape they take after their
Bengalese parent, but the brown is of the father; they are paler under-
neath, there is no lace marking.
Of the Gouldians I purchased last April and May only two pairs
survived, the first pair went to nest as soon as I turned them out into
their outdoor aviary, giving me five in the first nest and six in the
second. The hen was sitting when I took away her mate to send to
Paignton Show, where he gained " v.h.c.", notwithstanding having
reared eleven youngsters ! Good old fellow. I thought it would give
his wife a rest. The second pair were decidedly troublesome;
Mrs. Gouldian would have nothing to do with the home that was made
for her, so after a while out she went to end her days a grass widow.
I put in another hen, and she has proved successful, four young being
reared.
The Gold-breasted Waxbills and Avadavats have reared few this
year ; as a matter of fact all were reared, but so few eggs were laid,
doubtless owing to the lack of sunshine--that sentence will startle a
few who think Cornwall is all sunshine. Ask the holiday-makers !
However, one pair took 2nd at Paignton, and were in gorgeous colour.
The Bengalese were not so prolific, either, one nest seemed to be
sufficient for three months, then a second, and that's all!
The Violet-eared Waxbills were admired by all who saw them
from April till now, and they gained a 1st at Paignton. I put them into
the show hoping the other birds would inform them of their parental
duties, but opposite them w T ere wise old Parrots--hence " nothing
doing ! "
The Pectoral Finches had four chicks, but failed to rear them--
very disappointing ; also the Nonpareil Buntings dropped their young
ones out of the nest one a day. The second nest went the same way.
Somebody tell me why, please ! The trouble in Cornwall is there are so
few ants about, and when found never at the right time.

The young of the Zebra Finches have nearly all turned out cock
birds--no doubt owing to the wet weather the ladies would not venture
forth ! However, one pair went to Paignton and took 2nd, the 1st
prize going to a very nice pair of White Zebra Finches so unique that
I should like to possess a pair. I may add that Paignton was my first
show, and I am very pleased at having secured the 4 4 Whitley 55
Challenge Cup for 1931.
The charming little Orange-cheeks have had their ground floor
nests drowned out twice, but the third appears to be more successful.
I think that is all--except that I have the most darling White
Marmoset, which ranks equal to all my birds, and in the future I should
delight in a pair of Wallabies (Bennetts) like I saw hopping about in
that paradise of bird-lovers, Foxwarren Park.

Sir, --We have just lost our Ricord's Emerald Humming-bird,
Riccordia r. ricordii, which lived here for 3 years 4 months and 5 days.
This certainly is the best American record, and I have been carefully
through the Avicultural Magazine and various other sources of
information to see if there is a really definite European record to exceed
this. I have been unable to find one, but neither can I find anything
definite about the results of the Marquess de Segur.
I am sorry to trouble you in such a trivial matter, but wonder if
you know off-hand what the best European records are.
It will be of interest to you, I am sure, to know that our male
Long-tailed Bird of Paradise, which was in immature plumage when
collected in 1928, has now assumed full adult colouration. He is a
magnificent creature, and I wish that you could see him.

THE TURQUOISINE GRASS PARRAKEET
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99043452173913" page_id="56182054"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
This delightful Parrakeet, not very much larger than a Budgerigar,
was at one time, fifty years or so ago, a comparatively common bird
in European aviaries, where it bred freely: in fact, the edition of the
Zoological Society's List of Animals, published in 1883, gives a dozen
references to the species breeding in the Zoological Gardens between
1860 and 1882. But from that time onwards it became scarce, and the
only reference in the next edition is of a male and two females purchased
in 1884, since which time it appears to have completely died out as an
aviary bird.
When in Australia twenty-three years ago everyone who was best
able to judge told me that the Turquoisine was believed to be extinct.
I remember travelling by train between Sydney and National
Park, when my Australian companion, pointing from the carriage
window, told me that when a boy he and others used to journey out
to the district through which we were passing to shoot Turquosines
for " Parrot pie " ! But none had been seen for years past. It was
not only the shooters or the trappers who were responsible for the
disappearance of the Turquoisine. Its food is grass-seed, and the grass
on which seed formerly formed has long since been fed to sheep,
,so there is no seed left, or at any rate, not enough to support the stock
of Grass Parrakeets that formerly existed. But the Turquoisine is
fortunately not yet extinct, as was at one time feared. It has reappeared
in small numbers, and our member, Mr. S. Harvey, of Adelaide, has

successfully bred it in bis aviaries on several occasions in recent years.
Here in England there are at the present time half a dozen pairs at
least, and at the Zoological Gardens, after more than forty years, a
pair may again be seen in the Parrot House.
The Turquoisine (Neophema pulchella) is a native of the south-eastern
portion of Australia, and in South Australia the even more beautiful
Splendid or Scarlet-breasted Parrakeet (N. splendida) has its habitat.
But that was apparently a rare species since the days when Australia
was first discovered by the white man and, like the Turquoisine, for
years past it has completely disappeared. Like the Turquoisine again,
it has now been rediscovered, and we hear that our friend Mr. Harvey
has two pairs in his aviaries. We must all wish him success in breeding
them for I believe that these nearly extinct species will only be kept in
existence by careful conservation in captivity.

The excellent coloured plate of Manakins in the September issue
has prompted me to write a few notes on these, and other birds of
interest, which I observed whilst in British Guiana.
The Edward's Manakin (Chiromachceris manacus) is also known as
the Crackling Manakin on account of the curious call of the male bird,
which is like the sudden snapping of sticks or like a small Chinese
cracker going ofi. I have only seen this species in parties of about
eight to twelve, consisting of both sexes, and for some unaccountable
reason each party takes a liking to one particular spot amongst the
undergrowth, where it can be found all day and every day for months
on end. An abundance of berries which ripen in succession is an
essential part of their abode, but although similar places can be found
in plenty, these parties never seem to leave the place of their choice.
In this respect they differ from all other species of Manakins which
I have seen.
They are not easy to keep in captivity and liberal supplies of their

natural food (small juicy berries) must be given for some time before
they will take to, or thrive on, an artificial diet. Even then they have
a habit of " popping off " suddenly when looking quite fit, which is
probably due to over-fatness as they do not exercise themselves much
in a cage. But I rather suspect that most of them are infected with
jilaria, a complaint caused by mosquitoes and which does not seem to
affect them in their wild state, but when newly captured the changed
conditions and diet no doubt tend to make the birds lose some of their
vitality and then the jilaria gets the upper hand. The victim gets
staggering fits and the head is thrown backwards--a state from which
it never recovers. It was in East Africa that I first became aware of
this complaint in birds, when three out of every four Jacanas caught
in the mosquito-infested swamps went the same way. Subsequent
blood-tests proved that they were full of jilaria --minute worms in the
blood.
Some of the Manakins are very beautiful but owing to their retiring
habits they are exceedingly difficult to observe in the thick undergrowth,
and the slightest disturbance causes them to disappear. After many
arduous journeys through the swampy forests I managed to capture,
amongst others, a Golden-headed Manakin (Pipra erythrocephala ),
perhaps the most beautiful of the whole family, but very small and
delicate. The body is glossy blue-black and the entire head golden,
with a silky appearance. I managed to keep this gem alive until
nearing the shores of England, when the intense cold at night killed it.
Guiana possesses many rare species of beautiful birds, but
unfortunately they are both difficult to capture and to keep alive.
I was very keen on getting some of the lovely Trogons to be found there,
but they are rarely seen and it is only after one has learnt their call-
notes that they can be located successfully. After watching a pair
closely I quite thought that it would be hopeless to ever attempt
trapping them in a huge forest where the trees are such a tremendous
height. However, after tracking another specimen down by its call
I noticed it clinging to a termites' (white ants') nest which was attached
to the trunk of a tree about 30 feet above ground. These nests are made
of earth which sets hard and are usually about twice the size, or more,
of a football and are full of cells containing white ants and their eggs,

the whole being covered with a crust. I noticed that a small cavity
had been made, exposing the cells, and it was not long before the
Trogon commenced " hammering " in the manner of a Woodpecker.
This was rather a surprise, as I was under the impression that
American Trogons were entirely frugivorous.
. It did not take me many days to learn that this was a habit of all
the Trogons, i.e. other species as well, and that a good percentage of the
termites 5 nests had one or more cavities, and that these were visited
periodically by Trogons, and by Trogons only. Whether this was done
to provide food for themselves or for their young I am unable to say,
but it was the nesting season. Anyway, the discovery enabled me to
capture a beautiful pair of Black-throated Trogons (Trogon rufus), a
species with the upper parts metallic green and the under parts orange
yellow, and also a pair of Green Trogons (T. viridis), a larger species with
the head and breast deep blue. However, they are very difficult in
captivity, it being very hard to induce them to eat much, even of their
natural food. In their wild state they have the habit sometimes of
sitting perfectly still while danger is at hand, which might give one the
impression that they were dull and stupid. That this is far from being
the case, the following incident shows. One day I watched a Trogon
approach a parasitic fig (?)--a few branches jutting from its host--on
which were some ripe berries. It did not alight on these branches but
settled on a neighbouring bush some 12 feet away. After sitting quite
still for about a minute as if not interested in anything, it made an
upward dart towards the ripe berries, picked one during its flight, and
then returned to its original perch to eat it. This performance was
repeated seven or eight times before the Trogon flew away. I thought
it rather a laborious and unnecessary way to gather berries when it
could have alighted and have had a good feed without any trouble,
but simple as his actions appeared, in a few seconds I discovered that
this Trogon was no fool. Hardly had he left when a Palm Tanager
arrived and alighted right amongst the berries. Immediately there was
a great commotion and the bird appeared to be held fast and was
struggling violently. Running up I saw that it had been caught by a
Green Sharp-nosed Tree-snake which made a welcome addition to the
other reptiles which I had collected for the London Zoo.

Some of the Puffbirds (Bucconidce) are very pretty but very difficult
to keep in captivity as they require quantities of live food and, moreover,
they seem very stupid and difficult to tame. They look like a cross
between a Kingfisher and a Barbet, and have a slightly hooked bill.
They really belong to the Broadbills and have the habit of sitting
motionless on a branch where their colours harmonize perfectly with
their surroundings, making their detection very difficult. Thus they
remain for long periods until some tempting insect comes within
range. Even in face of danger they remain perfectly still, allowing
one to pass within a few yards. No doubt they realize that this is their
best means of protection, a habit probably acquired to defeat the
sharp-eyed Hawks which frequent the bush and which are quick to
detect any movement that is going on.
In the virgin forest in British Guiana the trees are an enormous
height and although being branchless for perhaps 100 feet up, there is
a dense mass of foliage at the top, numerous parasitic growths and
epiphytal orchids joining in the struggle for air and light. There is a
distinct type of bird life which frequents this upper " world " and
includes many brilliantly-coloured birds such as Parrots, Macaws,
Toucans, Cotingas, Tanagers, and Jays, all of which subsist on the
fruits and berries of these forest giants ; but observation of them from
the ground is well-nigh impossible. Mention must now be made of the
Hoatzin (Opisthocomus hoazin), which is one of the world's ornithological
wonders. A great deal has already been written about this bird, but
having been concerned in the collecting and bringing over of the
specimen now in the London Zoo, perhaps a few remarks will not be
out of place. The Hoatzin is extremely local and has the distinction
of being the only bird which feeds entirely on leaves. It is fairly large,
and somewhat clumsy in its movements, and small flocks can be seen
in the same spots every day and from which they scarcely ever move.
This sluggishness is accounted for by the fact that they live almost
entirely on the leaves of the Pimpler Thorn, a bush which only grows
on the edge of certain tidal rivers and creeks. Consequently they do not
require to hunt for their food as they are always in close contact with it.
Externally this bird is not very remarkable, but anatomically it is
unlike anything else. For one thing, nearly all the sternum or breast-

bone is missing, the space being taken up by a huge crop which is kept
full of leaves. The most interesting peculiarities of the Hoatzin,
however, are confined to the young birds. The nests are always built
over water and the young ones, when disturbed by an intruder, are in the
habit of diving and swimming whilst submerged, like a Grebe. When
danger is past they climb back to the nest by means of hooks and feet,
there being two of the former on each wing for this purpose. When the
young become feathered and are capable of flight they never dive
nor swim again, neither do they go down to the water's edge, as they
never drink ; moreover, the wing hooks disappear.
They are reputed to have an abominable odour which no doubt
serves as their only means of protection, but it is curious that this is
not noticeable in captivity so it is probably caused through their diet.
On bright moonlight nights Hoatzins become strangely active and
noisy, periodically flying about in a restless manner uttering their call-
notes, but there are long periods of absolute quiet. On such nights
I have observed them feeding, but when it is dark they never budge.
They are supposed to be a direct link with a remote period some three
million years ago when birds were reptilian in structure and habits,
and from which state all other present-day forms have evolved. They
are not very hard to keep in captivity in their native country, but the
difficulty of getting daily supplies of fresh leaves on the long voyage
home, and the sudden changes of climate, render their successful
transportation to this country very difficult indeed. Presumably on
account of their diet being very poor in food value, Hoatzins perish
immediately they are subjected to the sudden change to a low
temperature. In their mating habits they resemble, more or less,
Domestic Fowls. There is no preliminary displaying or courting, and
a female who contemplates starting a home is forcibly taken possession
of by a male. Frequently this arouses tho jealousy of another male
who happens to be close at hand and the first one is promptly chased
away, the newcomer taking charge, an act which leaves the female
quite unconcerned.

THE NESTING OF WORCESTER'S HANGING
PARROT

About a couple of years ago a fair number of this rarely-imported
species arrived as part of a collection of Asiatic birds. Although
probably little more than subspecifically distinct, Loriculus chrysonotus
worcesteri is easily distinguishable from the handsomer Golden-backed
Hanging Parrot of Cebu ( L . chrysonotus). It is distinctly smaller and
the strip of colour running from forehead to nape is of an almost uniform
orange red, whereas the Golden-back has a little patch of red above the
nostrils which changes abruptly to buttercup yellow. The hen
worcesteri is easily distinguishable by her bluish cheeks and by the
absence of any orange red on the throat. It has been stated that the
sexes when adult are alike in colour but, frankly, I do not believe it.
It is most unlikely that so small a bird would remain several years in
immature plumage, and if any hen worcesteri has really been found in
male dress she must have been barren or abnormal.
My pair, when acclimatized, were transferred to a large outdoor
aviary with a heated shelter, sharing their food and quarters with a
Purple Sunbird whom they did not molest although they put him in
his place when he tried to interfere with them. The cock worcesteri
was rather a poorly-coloured specimen with a very small throat-patch,
and somehow I never thought of the pair as likely breeders. However,
in early May they showed evident intention of being ready to nest,
the cock feeding the hen after the fashion of the genus, opening his
beak rather wide and allowing regurgitated nectar to run from the tip
of his tongue on to hers. I provided them with a peat-filled grandfather-
\0x25A0clock nest communicating with the aviary shelter, in which the hen soon
began to take an interest, collecting grass and carrying it tucked into
the feathers of her flanks and rump much after the fashion of a Peach-
faced Lovebird. The Hanging Parrots had been pairing and I was
\0x25A0daily expecting eggs to arrive when one morning I found the cock
missing. I searched the aviary but could discover no trace of him,
dead or alive. At last a small hole in the wire netting quite low down

300 Marquess of Tavistock--Nesting of Worcester&apos;s Hanging Parro
provided the clue. He had accompanied the hen on one of her grass-
gathering expeditions, found the exit, and made his escape--really
splendid luck ! I never saw him again. A Hanging Parrot is strictly
arboreal, never venturing near the ground when at liberty, and its
weak cry is inaudible 50 yards away. There was nothing for it but
to introduce my bachelor cock Golden-back to the grass widow. She
seemed a little surprised at the change but on the whole took it fairly
philosophically. The Golden-back was delighted and displayed freely,
turning round and round, giving an occasional bob and curtsey, and
opening and shutting his beak. The elegance of his courtship was,
however, much impaired by the Sunbird. That little rascal, who at
all times has rather the manners and temperament of a street urchin,
detected in a moment that the newcomer was not the male Hanging
Parrot to whom he was accustomed and decided to cheek him. When
the poor Golden-back was trying to look his best for the benefit of the
Worcester, the Sunbird planted himself alongside him and struck
gallant attitudes with one foot advanced and his beak in the air. He
then took wing and flying underneath the Golden-back gently but
firmly seized the tip of his tail and hung on. If I had been the little
Parrot I should have bitten him hard, but the Golden-back endured
the indignity without the least effort at retaliation, looking rather
like a man who tries to appear at his best in the presence of his beloved
even though a small boy persists in hanging on to the seat of his
trousers ! After about ten days the Worcester disappeared into her
nest-box and seemed to be sitting. The Sunbird I was obliged to remove
as he worried the Golden-back so badly that he seldom ventured
to leave the aviary shelter. After about three weeks we examined the
nest and found it empty. The Worcester had been patiently incubating
the abstract idea of eggs ! After this disappointment I did not take
much interest in her proceedings, but in late July she seemed to be
sitting again and did not desert her nest even when it became necessary
to cut her overgrown claws. This time, however, she remembered the
eggs and produced three, but unfortunately all proved clear. A second
clutch of four were also incubated for the full period with no better
success. The disappointing results with this species and the
Halmaheira Hanging Parrot make me pessimistic of ultimate success.

Both pairs of birds had lived for some years in large outdoor aviaries,
both appeared in full breeding condition, and both hens were model

something to do with the lack of fertility as the season has been very
disappointing all round.

For the last five years I have had a little flock of these birds,
Perdicula argoondah. Once there were seven, now owing to accidents,
escapes, and sending some away they are reduced to two cocks, and
I cannot get a hen.
They spend their time hidden in the grass squeezed up to each other
as close as possible regardless of sex or age. During incubation the
hen sits alone and it must be a melancholy time for her. As soon
as the chicks are hatched they all join up again. At intervals during
the day, when they think that the coast is clear, they troop off to the
food dishes. Sometimes one gets left behind and suddenly finds that
all the others have gone back ; it calls out; this upsets the others,
which get up and run about in all directions in an agitated manner
calling and looking for the missing bird ; when found they all settle
down. I find that they always roost in the middle of the floor of the
shelter in a ring with heads pointing out, I suppose so that on any sudden
alarm they are ready to fly off each in a different direction without
colliding.
Wilder birds I have never had. Going into the aviary they all
splash up under one's feet, like water when a stone is thrown into a
pond, banging into the wire sides, but they never have injured them-
selves as other birds do, because they hit the wire with their breasts
and not their heads, and do not fly high enough to reach the top.
Once one of the hens made a nest in a box turned on its side owing
to the shortage of better cover, but the eggs got cracked on the hard
surface. I ought to have knocked out that side first. Although so

wild at other times the hen would let me stroke her without leaving the
eggs. Four white eggs seems to be the usual clutch.
In January, 1930, when they were reduced to three cocks and a
hen, thinking to get them tamer I brought them into a room, which
I always occupy in the evening, in a large cage. They did not get the
least tame, but the hen started to lay. She would not sit, and laid
twenty-three eggs. Not wishing to exhaust her, they were turned out
into a little flight of 12 X 6 feet, with a small shelter 6x4 feet at
one end and a door at the other, where I had to go just inside to feed
and water the birds. One morning there were some pieces of white stuff
a few inches from where I trod every day. A closer inspection showed
that they were pieces of egg-shell surrounding the sitting bird : she had
just hatched out four chicks. I had never noticed her before. Toward
the evening she had joined the two cocks ; the other one I had parted
with.
At a fortnight all the young are able to fly, as the flight feathers
are the first to develop ; it seems as if they must be continually moulting
them for larger ones in order to keep pace with their increasing weight,
which must be a considerable drain on their strength.
On the 20th of October I went to catch up the four young to send
away. After the first attempt and they were scattered, I had to go
down on my hands and knees and hunt and pick them out of the
grass, completely destroying a second nest and spilling the eggs. After
caging them all in order to pick out the young birds I re-made the nest
and put the eggs back. The hen actually went back and hatched out
one egg. The chick died in a few days, probably from want of attention,
as she stuck to the other eggs which were addled.
I lost the hen in the winter. She got through a hole into an empty
flight and was dead when discovered.&apos;
These birds, armed with spurs, never seem to fight among themselves,
but I do not trust them with other Quail owing to several suspicious
deaths. They do not like our cold, wet winter, spending most of the
day in the warmed shelter. They seem to thrive on seeds and a little
soft food when adult. The young were chiefly fed on ants' eggs.

By B. C. Thomasset
During the last two years a good many Pileated Finches appear to
have been imported, but lately a dealer told me that they were not
popular birds and they did not sell readily. This, I think, shows a
want of perception on the part of bird-keepers. The Pileated Finch
is not a gaudy bird, but it is quite attractive in appearance and its
character is charming.
All that I have had have been particularly tame and friendly, and
in an aviary they are always in evidence. They are not spiteful with
other birds, though they will defend their nest from intruders.
I find them more insectivorous in their diet than either Nonpareil
or Indigo Buntings, and they seem to require a fair amount of insect
food throughout the year. Mine have a few mealworms daily in
winter when wild insects are scarce.
No account of successful breeding has been published since that
of Mrs. Howard Williams in 1905.
During the summer of 1930 a pair of Pileated, which shared an
aviary with Doves and Grass Finches, nested three times. On two
occasions young ones lived to leave the nest, but none were fully reared.
As is usual with Buntings, they will feed their young ones only with
living insects for the first few weeks after hatching. Later on a certain
amount of seed is given. I have watched both Pileated and Nonpareils
feeding their young and have never seen food regurgitated. The seed
is shelled and carried in the beak.
This year my Pileated Finches have nested three times, and at the
present time (September) the hen is building her fourth nest in a plant
of helenium.
All the nests have been small and frail, but well-woven affairs,
constructed of fibre or tow. The two former were in a dead branch
of laurustinus sheltered overhead by iron sheeting, whilst the third
was in a large plant of Michaelmas daisy. The birds evidently prefer
growing cover when they can have it. The hen alone builds the nest.

Alfred Ezra--Rearing the Madagascar Partridge
The clutch has consisted each time of two eggs only, white in colour and
large for the size of the bird.
As far as I can tell, the hen sits for eleven or twelve days. The
cock takes no part in incubation, though he occasionally feeds the
young ones. In the case of my birds, the mother did nearly all the
work. The nest is kept perfectly clean, the excreta being carried as
far away as possible.
The young leave the nest in about ten days. They resemble the
hen in plumage, but wings and tail are not nearly fully grown, and
they can fly very little. The first days after leaving the nest are a
critical time. The little birds seem to have a genius for establishing
themselves in exposed and unsuitable places, and they will never
remain where one puts them.
I now have two strong young Pileated Finches which are independent
of their parents. They came from the second and third nests
respectively. The father still occasionally feeds the younger one now
that the hen is occupied with her fourth nest.
I may say that the pair wintered in an unheated aviary. In cold
weather they spent most of their time in the shelter but, by mistake,
they were shut out in the open flight on about the worst night of the
season. They seemed to be none the worse for this uncomfortable
experience, and may fairly be classed as hardy birds.

This very attractive bird belongs to a very peculiar genus, inter-
mediate between Quails and Partridges, with no close relatives anywhere
in the world. It is purely a ground bird of open grassy country, or short
bush, and is never found in woods. It occurs all over Madagascar,
as much in the dry west as in the damp east, in lowland as well as
on the high plateau. Very common everywhere, he is a skulker, and
hardly ever gets up, so he is easier to trap than to shoot. It is said
to be white in flesh, and very good to eat; practically never imported,

although so common, and very easy to catch alive. This Partridge
was bred in the Jardin d'Acclimatation in Paris in 1890, but never in
England. I purchased two pairs from Mr. Webb last year, and turned
them out, one pair in each small aviary with a good many other birds.
They were always delightfully tame, and settled down at once. Although
they were displaying, and the cock bird feeding the hen, they made
no attempt at nesting early in the season, but the moment I let one
pair out in my largest aviary, where the grass was allowed to grow
quite high, they nested and hatched five healthy and strong young ones
about the end of July. I did not know they were nesting till I saw
the adult birds walking about proudly with the five chicks.
Unfortunately, three of the chicks were drowned in the torrential
rain we had about the middle of August. The other two have done
splendidly, and are a good size now. Although very shy when they were
first seen, they are quite friendly now, and run up to me on their own
for mealworms. I hope next year to breed a good many as they are
most attractive birds, and well worth establishing in this country.

At last after several attempts I have been successful in rearing the
Crowned Starling (Galeopsar salvadorii). I first started with a pair
in 1928, and each year, although nearly reared, the young were thrown
out of the nest by the parents. This year in June the same thing
happened: the birds laid, and when the young were nearly fully feathered
they were found dead in the nest. The birds went to nest again,
and this time as soon as the eggs were hatched I caught up the cock
bird and put him in a cage in the aviary shelter not very far from the
nest. I then let the hen bird have her liberty by leaving the top door
of the aviary wide open. She flew out at once, and I thought I was
going to lose her, but in five minutes she was back again. I threw a
few mealworms outside, and she promptly collected over a dozen in
her beak, and flew back to the young, coming out again for some more.

806 Alfred Ezra--Successful Breeding of Galeopsar Salvadorii
In a couple of days this bird got so tame that she used to follow me
about for long distances away from the aviary, flying from tree to
tree and calling. As soon as she got a few mealworms from me, off she
flew into the aviary. It was a very pretty sight to see her on the wing,
and to see the beautiful brown feathers which one hardly sees when
the bird is in an aviary. By the first week of August two fine healthy
young birds left the nest. On the 20th of August the young birds
looked as large as the parents, and I am delighted to have succeeded
at long last in rearing them. I am convinced now that the cock bird
is the cause of all the past failures. He chases the hen bird about and
bullies her to go to nest again. She lays again and deserts the young.
I have had this experience with a pair of Shamas, and the Rothschild's
Grackle this year as well.
My other success has been with the very rare Rothschild&apos;s Grackle
( Leucopsar rothschildi) , but not before several disappointments. I have
had a pair of these birds since 1928, and every year they nested and
laid, but never reared their young. In fact, in most cases the eggs
disappeared from the nest. As they were the only occupants of the
aviary one of them must have eaten the eggs. This year they laid
three eggs as early as April, and these as usual had disappeared in
about ten days' time. She then laid three more, and these eggs I
removed and put in a Blackbird's nest in the garden. Again she laid
three eggs, and these I put under a Thrush. My gardeners chose these
two spots to burn their rubbish, and of course disturbed both the
nests, and the two lots of eggs, which were on the point of hatching,
were deserted. The next three eggs I put under a Spreo in my aviary.
These were hatched, and the young half-reared and then deserted.
Yet three more eggs were laid, and these I allowed her to incubate.
After about a fortnight the nest-boxes, of which I had two in the aviary,
were examined, and I was horrified to find the cock bird dead in one
nest-box, but the hen was with a young bird in the second nest-box. Of
course, I thought there was no chance of my rearing any young after
all my bad luck, but to my surprise the hen fed the young bird and fully
reared it. The hen bird has always been very wild, and I never once
saw her taking any mealworms to the nest. A good supply of meal-
worms were left in the aviary, and when no one was about she did her

duty nobly. From April to July this bird laid five times, and each
time three eggs were found in the nest--in all fifteen eggs, which sounds
a wonderful performance. The young bird is exactly the size of the
mother, but not quite so white on the back, and the blue skin which
surrounds the eye is rather smaller. It is a very strong and healthy
bird, and every bit as wild as the mother. This success was doubly
welcome, as bad luck seemed to follow this pair all along. I am hoping
that the young bird is a hen, so that I can make up two pairs with the
two odd cock birds I still have, and again try and rear some more
next year. I do not believe either of these Starlings has been reared
before. A very good coloured picture of the Rothschild's Grackle
appeared in our Magazine in April last.

Sir, --No doubt you will be interested to bear that the Scarlet-
breasted Parrakeet has come to hand. I have two pairs and two odd
hens. There were two other pairs : these are remaining in Adelaide
Aviaries. They are wonderful and are the first we have seen alive.
I have had to disturb two pairs of Bourke's to make room for these ;
little did I think I would have to do this.
One pair of Bourke's has two eggs. This is very early. The
Turquoisines usually commence the end of September or early October.

THE SPOTTED-WING SARAGLOSSA
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.995898230769231" page_id="56182079"  page_num="318" year="" vol="">
Sir,-- I have recently obtained a pair of rare Starlings, which I think
are quite new to aviculture. They are Psaraglossa spiloptera, and
there are two subspecies, otherwise the genus is monotypic, and
confined to India. Oates does not think this bird is a Starling, although
thought to be by field naturalists. He puts it with the Crateropidce ;
Stuart Baker, on the other hand, considers it is a Starling in all respects.
It is rather a small bird, mine not being as large as a Common Spreo.
The general colour above is ashy grey, all the feathers edged with
dusky brown, giving it a very mottled appearance ; the lower back and
rump are more uniformly brown ; the wing coverts are greenish black,
but the primaries are white at the base, crown of head grey mottled with
black, lores and feathers round side of face deep black, throat rich red
chestnut, breast pale rufous, abdomen white.

From this description it will be seen that the bird, if not as gaudy
as some of the Starlings represented in our aviaries, is nevertheless
very pleasingly coloured and quite unlike any other forms. Mine are
rather rough at present, but should look very attractive when they
have moulted out. I have not had them long enough yet to speak for
their hardiness, but they appear to be doing well on ordinary soft food,
supplemented with fruit, and a daily ration of mealworms.

SWAINSON'S LORIKEETS AND LOVEBIRDS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997781842105263" page_id="56182080"  page_num="319" year="" vol="">
Sir, --I was very much interested in H. A. Collins' letter in the
September number of the Avicultural Magazine about the nesting
of his Swainson's Lorikeets ; exactly the same thing has happened
to mine this year. They laid first in April in a coco-nut husk : both
eggs were fertile but neither hatched. They laid again in June with the
same results, and then apparently tired of the husk determined to try
a new spot, and went up into the roof of my small aviary, where there
was a space of about 3 inches between the actual roof and an
interlining of beaverboarding ; there they either made a nest or took
possession of one already made by some Black-cheeked Lovebirds. They
laid again in July, and the young birds were almost feathered when
I discovered them in August. However, they both died when about
twenty-four days old. I was away at the time, but the old birds had
apparently been looking after them well, and I have since been
wondering whether it could have been too cold for them, and whether
perhaps having got out of the nest they could not get in again. It was
very wet at the time, but not extra cold.
Last year the same pair of Lorikeets nested with success in a coco-nut
husk and reared one family of two. The first clutch of eggs though

fertile came to nothing, and I tried damping the second lot, and they
hatched about the twenty-first day. This year in the roof it was
quite impossible to damp them, in fact until the birds were hatched
I was not even sure that they were nesting. I feed them on bread and
milk--white bread and goats' milk--oranges, sometimes green grapes,
and ordinary seed mixture such as one gives Budgerigars. I have had
them on this diet for three years and they seem perfectly healthy.
The cock is in perfect feather, but all this year the hen has been untidy
on her neck. They live at peace with three pairs of Black-cheeked
Lovebirds and one pair of green Budgerigars.
Last year the Black-cheeked Lovebirds had an excellent breeding
season, and absolutely refused to allow the Budgerigars to live in the
aviary. This year for some reason the Lovebirds, though they have
nested over and over again, have had no families, and in consequence
have been quite friendly with the Budgerigars, who are now rearing
their second family. When I first got the Swainson's Lorikeets three
years ago they lived in a large Parrot cage in the house, and in the same
room were two cock Black-cheeked Lovebirds who went in and out
through the window as they pleased, coming in and roosting in their
cage at night, unless the door of the room was open when they would
fly upstairs and sleep on top of a cupboard. During all that summer
and autumn they brought in food from outside and fed the Lorikeets
through the bars of their cage, not only the hen Lorikeet but the cock
as well. They would fly in and sit on the cage with their heads on one
side, and the Lorikeets would climb up and wait until the food was
pushed into their mouths. Now, though they are all together, this
never seems to happen.
I wonder if anyone who has experience of Black-cheeked Lovebirds
can tell me why sometimes they turn upon each other. I had nine
in the spring and one morning one was lying dead, very much mauled,
on the floor. About a week ago another was on the floor with a large
hole in its wing. I took it in and dressed it, and yesterday as it could
fly returned it to the aviary only to hear a fuss about ten minutes
afterwards, and on going out found all the others chasing it. This one
is, I think, a cock, and the one killed in the spring was certainly a hen.
I don't want to keep the bird caged in the house for the rest of his

A QUEER FRIENDSHIP
Sir, --There seems to be no end to the idiosyncrasies of birds in
confinement, or to the peculiar habits they will adopt when deprived
of others of their own species, but I think the following " friendship "
is so remarkable that it is worth recording. In one of my aviaries is a
Black Rail and a small Spotted Francolin from East Africa, both
birds having lost their respective mates, and both having been inmates
of the same aviary for a long while. Between these two birds, both of
widely different habits in a wild state, a most extraordinary friendship
has been established : the Francolin is a cock bird, and the Rail
evidently a female ; wherever the one goes the other follows--they
squat down side by side in the long grass, or under a bush, and refuse
to leave each other. The Francolin constantly feeds the Rail, and if it
finds some tit-bit such as a worm, or catches a fly, calls her up and feeds
her with it, while she crouches on the ground with outstretched fluttering
wings. Both birds are very tame, so it is easy to observe what goes on,
and short of actual pairing they are like a mated pair. Perhaps before
long some more Black Rails will be imported, and I shall then be able
to provide my solitary widow with a mate more suitable to her station
in life. Till that occurs the illicit friendship must continue.

Sir,-- It may interest readers of the Avicultural Magazine to
know that I saw an Albino Swallow the other day.
I was motoring along a country lane close to here, when a white
bird flew across my path. I at Once slowed down, and after a little while
came across the bird perched on some wire fencing, from which I was
able to identify it as above. On returning later in the day I was greeted
with this remark from members of the staff engaged in the Zoological

found that none had seen it so well as I had.

catcher, Garden Warbler, Goldcrest, Willow Wren, Great Tit, Coal
Tit, Tree Creeper, Song Thrush, Blackbird, Robin, and the usual
Sparrow.
Many more species have been seen, but their nests have not been
located. It will be interesting to see how many of our feathered friends
will select this well-wooded site another year, now that these gardens
have been opened to the public and have during the last few weeks
been visited by thousands.
I am hoping that by next spring we will be adding many breeding
attempts on the part of our foreign friends.
If any members of the Avicultural Society should be visiting
Chester I would be very pleased to send them a complimentary ticket
to the above gardens, if they would write and let me know in advance.

A BREAD-AND-MILK DIET
Sir, --In reply to your query, I use only unskimmed fresh cow's
milk, as used by the household. In warm weather I scald it, but in cold
weather I use it just as it arrives from the dairy. For my Softbills,
Pekin Robins, Hangnests, Cardinals, etc., I sweeten the bread and
milk with a little honey. My Cockatiels, Blossom Heads, various
Lovebirds, and Budgerigars prefer the diet unsweetened, as do the
Zebra Finches and Mannikins. I suppose preserved milk could be
used, as it is probably preserved milk that I obtain also and ship when
bringing home birds from abroad.
I may add that since writing you I have young Pekins, Tri-coloured
Mannikins, and more Zebras, all being reared by their parents on bread
and milk. When they have young to feed these little species display
astounding courage, and will attack Cardinals for possession of the
bread and milk dish.

Mr. Crandall's New York Zoo Record (Oct. No., p. 292) of a Humming-
bird living there three years and four months is, I think, certainly
the record. Mr. Ezra had one, also a Ricordia , which escaped from an
open window (about 1915), after he had had it two years. Delacour,
Avicultural Magazine, 1926, and Aviculture, vol. ii, p. 360) says
that an Agyrtia milleri " once lived three years in France ", presumably
with Comte Segur.
With these two exceptions the longest-lived of any Humming-bird
imported to Europe seems to have been a Mango, which lived nine
weeks in the London Zoo ; this was certainly the case up to 1921, when
Neunzig's Fremdlandische Stubenvogel appeared, but there may have
been other longer lives since, though I do not think so.

Mr. Wilfred Frost has returned to London with a very fine collection
of birds from the East. It includes ten species of Paradise Birds and
several examples of most of them, as well as a number of other birds of
which the following are probably imported for the first time :--
The Giant Pitta (Pitta maxima ), from the island of Halmaheira.
Macklot's Pitta (Pitta mackloti), from the islands of Mysol and
Salawati.
The Yellow-green Lorikeet (Psitteuieles flavoviridis), from Sula
Islands.
Mr. Shaw Mayer arrived from North-east New Guinea on
23rd October with a collection of quite outstanding quality, consisting
as it does of many Birds of Paradise, of which half a dozen are entirely
new to aviculture, either as species or subspecies. Mr. Mayer's birds are
always beautifully caged and tended, and arrive in most perfect condition,
and we have never seen a more lovely collection, and hope to publish a
detailed account next month. Space only permits here of the mere men-
tion of the names of those species imported now for the first time :--
Bothschild's Bird of Paradise (Astrarchia rothschildi ).

PARADISE BIRDS FROM NORTH-EAST NEW

<bodyText confidence="0.990451652173913" page_id="56182096"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
Space in onr last number would only permit of the briefest mention
of the wonderful collection of birds brought to this country from
North-east New Guinea by Mr. Shaw Mayer, and. a promise of a more
detailed account was given. I have seen many collections arrive
and from many different parts of the world, but never have I seen one
that gave me more pleasure or more thrills than this, for not only
was every bird in perfect plumage and condition, but all were rare,
and most so rare that one never expected, in one's wildest dreams of
imagination, to see such priceless treasures in the living flesh.
The collection was made chiefly in the Finisterre Mountains in
what was formerly German New Guinea, and in which former collectors
have confined their attentions to skin collections only, hence the birds
brought home are different to any we have seen before.
The first I noted was a full-plumaged male of a Paradise Bird
somewhat resembling the Greater Bird but with the plumes of a
delicate orange red, looking like a hybrid between apoda and raggiana ,
but, if anything, more striking than either of these. It was the Empress
Augusta Victoria's Bird of Paradise (Paradisea augustce-victorice).
Only one of these was secured, although it is not found at any very
great altitude as are some of the others, but Mr. Mayer was chiefly
anxious to procure the high mountain species, especially the wonderful
long-tailed Astrarchia rothschildi, which is allied to Princess Stephanie's
Bird of Paradise, which has been imported on rare occasions. He was

Paradise Birds from North-East Neio Guinea
successful in securing half a dozen males and four females of these,
all of which reached home safely and, except for the loss of the tips of
some of their long tail-feathers, in perfect plumage. It is certainly
a glorious bird, mainly deep black above, with a leaf-green under
surface, but it has a wonderful ruff which is bordered by bands of vivid
coppery gold and green, and in display, which I have already witnessed
several times, this ruff forms an almost complete disc, the head for mi ng
the centre, and one only sees a jet black disc bordered by a band of
fiery golden copper. This is one of the high mountain species, occurring
at about 7,000 feet.
The Emperor of Germany's Bird of Paradise ( Paradisea gulielmi)
is another wonderful creature with flank plumes more open in
texture than in most of its genus, and with a brilliant green forehead,
face and throat, the rest of the body being of a chocolate brown and
cream. It occurs at the comparatively low elevation of from 2,000 to
3,000 feet above sea-level.
It is difficult to say which is the most beautiful in a collection in
which all are beautiful, but a Six-plumed with gold instead of silver
frontal plumes and a comparatively long tail certainly runs the others
very close. This is the Parotia wahnesi or Wahne's Six-plumed Bird
of Paradise, certainly one of the most exquisite of its genus. It is
smaller than either sefelata or lawesi, both of which we have seen before.
It was described by Lord Bothschild in 1906, and figured by Gronvold
in The Ibis for 1911 (pi. vi), and we give here a photographic reproduc-
tion, by permission, of Mr. Gronvold's excellent coloured plate. The
body colour of the bird is intense velvety black on which background
the scintillating breast shield of gold shot with green, the striking copper
nasal plumes and shining blue nape, stand out in vivid contrast. The
female, of which Mr. Mayer obtained one, is of a reddish brown. This
is also a mountain species, occurring at some 6,000 feet.
Another bird of this altitude is the Superb Bird of Paradise, and
those obtained by Mr. Mayer were somewhat different to those that
have arrived on previous occasions. This particular race was named
as a sub-species by Lord Rothschild Lophorhina minor latipennis , and
is said to differ from the typical L. minor from British New Guinea
in having the long lateral plumes of the pectoral shield slightly longer

and distinctly wider. The difference is certainly very slight. The
Superb is one of the smaller Birds of Paradise with a short tail. It is
velvety black, but on the chest is a wonderful shield of metallic green
which terminates on each side in long points projecting considerably
beyond the width of the body, and on its back it carries a hood of
velvet black.
Geisler's Drepanornis (Drepanornis alhertisi geisleri) is the least
beautiful but perhaps the most strange looking of the collection. Its
plumage is violet brown and the bill is long and curved. On the
forehead is a patch of metallic blue and from just above the eyes
project small fleshy " horns ".
The collection also contained two fine males of the Rifle Bird
(Craspedophora intercedens) and six male Gardener Bower Birds of a
slightly different form to any previously imported and which Lord
Rothschild has named Amhlyornis subalaris germanus. The Gardener
Bower Bird is a brownish Thrush-like bird with a brilliant orange
crest which is generally concealed, but when the bird is displaying
during his dance in front of his bower this crest is revealed in all its
vivid beauty reminding one of some brilliant orange flower.
From this collection the Zoological Society has acquired examples
of four species, Mr. Whitley has taken pairs where these were available
and has added six species to his already remarkable collection and
Mr. Ezra has also acquired some.
Although mammals do not come within the province of the
Avicultural Magazine I cannot let this short account of Mr. Shaw
Mayer's collection end without a mention of the Tree Kangaroos he has
brought home. The commoner species of this curious group of
animals are well known at the Zoo, but the Matschie's Tree Kangaroos
(Dendrolagus matschiei) are something quite new and quite the most
striking of any we have seen. There is a male and two females, one
of the latter carrying a large young one in its pouch, and their colour
is reddish brown becoming reddish buff to yellowish white below.
These are some of the wonders of a wonderful country, but their
collection involves endless hardship, and Mr. Mayer is to be congratulated
on a fine achievement.

For some years I have been trying to get pairs of some of the
Sporophilse. The White-throated and Reddish Finches were all I
could get, the hens of the latter always dying just when my hopes were
highest.
Last winter I managed to get a good many brown birds with dark
beaks, mostly from abroad, as all the hens are so very much alike I have
not the least idea what they are.
This spring a pair of White-throated, two pairs of Reddish Finches,
cocks of the Lined and Guttural Finch with some hens which I hoped
would be their respective mates, were turned into a flight with some
other small birds.
The first thing that happened was that the two cock Reddish
Finches fell out, one had to be rescued, because with these Sporophilse
it always means the death of the weakest if they quarrel. A few days
afterwards the one left behind died. After cutting the grass, about
a fortnight later, I discovered a very small nest made of hay about
eight inches above the ground in the only thick part of a seedling
clematis climbing up a privet stem. It contained two young birds
which fitted it like a cork in a bottle. There was no room for another
one if more had been hatched. They were just feathering and had
two yellow-lined gaping throats. They were being fed, chiefly on
spray millet, by one of the hen Reddish Finches.
She must have been incubating when the cock died. Two young
birds left the nest on 4th July, with half-grown tails; the nest had begun
to sag. I had to put it straight a little time before. They looked so
fragile that one wonders how they escape their numerous enemies in
their native haunts. They never sat together as some young birds do.
After the hen ceased to feed them I lost count of them. Later on
I found another nest, higher up in the same plant, which had then
grown considerably. No eggs were laid as it was disturbed by a pair
of Cherry Finches who built a second nest just below, after their first-
brood of three had died.
The cock White-throated Finch murdered the Lined Finch as a

preliminary to building a nest in a wire fern basket hanging from the
roof filled with twigs, too high up for observation. Last year when they
built in a poplar-tree the four eggs disappeared one by one when I tried
to take notes.
One young bird left the nest on 27th July, and was fed by both
parents for a day or two, then vanished. There was a little brown
bird picked up dead a few days later on, either that or one of the young
Reddish Finches. There is a stumpy Portugal Laurel in the corner
farthest from the door on which I had thrown an armful of hay. Not
being used, I took it off for the benefit of the shrub ; finding a nest with
two eggs in it underneath I put the hay back again ; the next day
there was another egg. This belonged to the Jacarine Finches. They
appeared to be greenish white, rather thickly spotted, and streaked with
dark grey-green. They were two nervous for a close examination.
The birds did not mind my entering to feed and water, but the hen
always left the nest when anybody passed three or four yards away
outside. The cock sometimes took a turn on the eggs ; he usually
sat on a little tree close by, driving off any bird that perched above the
nest, but had to give way to either of the White-throated Finches or
the cock Red-crested Finch ; the rest of his time he spent in jumping
straight up in the air with a flutter and diving down again on to the
perch. One egg hatched ; the young bird died just as the feathers were
sprouting.
Of my thirty years of aviculture, this is by far the worst. The wet
and cold has killed nearly all the young birds soon after they have
left the nest; many have only played at nest-building.

Superb Starlings (Spreo superbus). Five young reared, and there
are two in the nest at present (14th September).
White-capped Starling (Heteropsar albicapillus). The hen bird
died while incubating four eggs.
Japanese Eobin (Erithacus akahige). The cock bird killed the hen
just when she had started building a nest. This is strange behaviour
after five years of peace and happiness.
Renauld's Ground Cuckoo (Carpococcyx renauldi). The two
pairs nested three times, each pair laying two eggs each time. All
the nests were built in baskets, inside the aviary shelter, and were about
ten feet off the ground. Most of the eggs were unfertile, although
two eggs had chicks which died in the shell just before they were
due to hatch.
Tambourine Doves (Tympanistria tympanistria). Reared one young
and are incubating two eggs now (14th September).
Crowned Starling (Galeopsar Salvadorii ). Reared two fine healthy
young. Particulars of these have been given in an earlier number
of the Magazine.
Rothschild's Grackle (Leucopsar rothschildi). After a good many
failures one beautiful young was reared. Details of which have appeared
in an earlier number of the Magazine.
White-breasted Pigeon (Gallicolumba jobiensis). Two young
reared.
Formosan Bamboo Partridge (Bambusicola sonorivox). A good
many eggs laid all over the aviary, but not in a proper nest. None
hatched.

least a dozen young were reared. Two just out of the nest (14th
September).
Slenderbill Starling (Ginnamopterus tenuirostris). Laid, but
no eggs were hatched.
Ruppell's Starling (Lamprotornis purpureopterus). I had a pair
of these in one of my larger aviaries with a great many other birds.
They nested, and reared a fine healthy young one which was killed by
other birds the day it left the nest. It was perfectly feathered and
flew well.

of these in a large aviary. Two pairs nested and had young but none
were reared. These were also with a good many other birds.
Silver-eared Mesia (Mesia argentauris). One young one fully
reared in a large aviary which was full of several different kinds of birds.
Virginian Cardinal ( Cardinalis cardinalis). One young reared
in the above aviary.
Blue Bird ( Sialia sialis). Two young reared.
Shama ( Kittocincla malabarica). One young reared, although five
were hatched in two clutches.
Diamond Doves (Geopelia cuneata). A good many reared.
The Occipital Tree Pie ( Urocissa occipitalis). Two young were
successfully reared. These same birds reared two young ones last
year, which I left out of the list by mistake. I find these birds rear
their young well, but when the young leave the nest the parents are
likely to eat them. They ate up one last year, so I put the remaining
young one in a cage, and they fed it well through the bars. This year
the moment the young flew out of the nest I caged them and they
were successfully reared.
Madagascar Partridges ( Margaroperdix madagascariensis). Two
reared. Details given in an earlier Magazine.
Alexandrine Parrakeet ( Psittacula nipalensis). The Lutino
hen and normal coloured green cock bird reared two young. I have
seven of these lutino bred young ones now, of different ages. I am
afraid the five young reared in 1928 and 1929 are all hens. They show
no signs of the collar, which generally appears when the bird is just
over two years old.
The blue cock Alexandrine, mated to a green hen, reared four
strong and healthy young ones. Altogether I have nine of these now.
Two out of the three young, bred in 1929, are cock birds, and have
their collars already, but the third one bred at the same time shows
no signs of a collar, so she must be a hen. I hope to mate this hen
to the old blue cock next year, when I hope with luck to breed the first

dead in shell. As the nest-boxes are placed inside the aviary shelter
there is not enough moisture. Will try them with a different type of
nest-box next year, with a good deal of damp earth in them, and these
boxes will be hung up outside in the flight of the aviary.
Barraband's Parrakeet (Polytelis swainsoni). Three healthy
young were reared, although five were hatched. This old pair of birds
have not once failed rearing young for the last seven years.
La yard's Parrakeet (Psittacula calthrapce). Laid four eggs,
but they were all unfertile. This is the first time these birds have
nested with me.
Malabar Parrakeet (Psittacula peristerodes). Four young were
reared.
Turquoisine (Neophema pulchella). A pair of this lovely Parrakeet
was only turned out in the aviary the end of May, having arrived
from Australia about a fortnight earlier. The hen took to the nest
at once. After ten days the cock was found dead in the nest, and the
hen was sitting on seven eggs. Most of these were unfertile
with the exception of one, which did not hatch, although it had a
chick.
Queen Alexandra's Parrakeets (N orthipsitta alexandrce). A
beautiful pair of these were acquired about the middle of May. As the
weather was still cold I did not turn them out in the aviary before
the end of May. Nested at once and have reared four lovely young.
All strong on the wing and in perfect condition. Wonderful bit of luck
to be successful so soon with these rare birds.
Stanley Crane (Tetrapteryx paradisea). Laid two eggs. Both
unfertile.
In the animal enclosure at liberty :--
Manchurian Crane (Megalornis japonensis). Laid two eggs and
sat well, but eggs were unfertile.
Sarus Crane (Megalornis antigone). Found a nest of these birds
a mile away from the enclosure. Both eggs unfertile. As these birds
were both full winged I am surprised their eggs were not fertile.
Demoiselle Crane (Anthropoides virgo). A pair of these nested in
my garden, unfortunately outside the wired enclosure. One egg was
laid, and a fine healthy chick was hatched. Did splendidly for twelve

exhaustion in the morning.
Brush Turkey (Catheturus lathami). Two fine mounds were built,
but no eggs were laid.
Monaul Pheasants (Lophophorus impeyanus). Four young reared.
Bed Jungle Fowl (Gallus gallus). A great many reared, and are
found long distances from here.
Sonnerat's Jungle Fowl (Gains sonnerati). A few reared, but
I am afraid they are crossing with the Bed Jungle Fowl.
White Peafowl (Pavo cristatus var.). Three young reared.
Golden Pheasant (Ghrysolophus pictus). About six reared. I
think most of the eggs were eaten by the Cranes in the enclosure.
Chukor Partridge (Alectoris chukar). A good many young seen.
One hen was seen with seventeen young.
Black-headed Swans (Gygnus melanocoryphus). Four beautiful
young reared.
Mandarin Duck (Aix galericulata). Twenty-three Ducks were
reared, sixteen of them in nest-boxes 20 feet up in trees, from
full-winged birds. These when hatched were found walking round
the fence trying to get into the pond. As soon as the gate of the wire
enclosure was opened, the mother walked in with the Ducklings.
Three Ducks were responsible for the sixteen Ducklings.

This rare Duck laid three eggs and after incubating them for three
weeks deserted the nest. The eggs were put under a hen, and three
fine Ducklings were hatched. They only lived for ten days, and I feel
certain they would have been reared had the Duck hatched them and
taken them into the water.

Mr. Gurney has given me permission to write the following list of
the birds which are under my charge here, and which at present inhabit
the numerous aviaries and enclosures at Keswick Hall. Of course, the
inmates are constantly changing ; new arrivals keep on coming, and
the older inmates die off, and not only old inmates, but we have our
misfortunes as other members who keep large collections of birds
must have, and deaths of newly imported specimens, or illness, or
perhaps worst of all, fatal combats between ill-agreeing birds in the
same aviary, all tend to keep our avian population changing.
As various accounts and descriptions of the aviaries have appeared
in the Magazine at various times, I have not bothered to further
describe them in any detail, but for the sake of convenience have
merely numbered them for this article ; they are really arranged in
three completely separate blocks, and except for the range of aviaries
occupied by the Birds of Prey, have nearly all heated shelters, adjoining
the flights, many lit by electric light which is very useful in the long
winter evenings. The various paddocks or enclosures are well sheltered
by surrounding trees, and are of large extent, the biggest being nearly
three acres in area, but the pond in the garden on which are the Water
Fowl is small, and not more than twenty or thirty Ducks are kept on
this. The collection comprises all orders of birds and I do not think
that Mr. Gurney has ever specialized in any particular group. I will
commence with the aviaries proper.
Aviary 1.--A mixed lot of Budgerigars.
Aviary 2.--Numerous Lovebirds, including Black-cheeked, Fischer's
and Nyasa ; these all breed freely, without any attention, and the
aviary is full of hybrids, whose parentage is sometimes difficult to
make out.
Aviary 3.--A pair of San Bias Jays, which nest every year, but
invariably eat their young ones, sometimes when the young birds are
almost on the point of leaving the nest.
Aviary 4.--Two Bleeding-heart Pigeons, probably both cocks, as
they have never shown any signs of breeding ; numerous Diamond

Doves which breed freely in this aviary ; and a mixed lot of African
Finches including Pectoral Finches, Orange Weavers, Pileated Finch,
Black-headed Nuns, etc.
Aviary 5.--A pair of Pagoda Mynahs, a Red-vented Bulbul, and
Diamond Doves.
Aviary 6.--A pair of Laughing Kingfishers ; this species has been
bred here in the past, but not of recent years.
Aviary 7.--Empty.
Aviary 8.--Empty.
Aviary 9.--White Budgerigars.
Aviary 10.--A large and roomy aviary, the flight planted with
clumps of bamboos and a good-sized pool; it contains three Tiger
Bitterns and a pair of Roseate Spoonbills.
Aviary 11.--Eight or nine Diamond Doves, one Talpacoti Dove,
one Picui Dove, one Bay-winged Cowbird, a pair of Saffron Finches,
several Red-billed Weavers and Yellowish Weavers, four Crimson-
crowned Weavers, two Napoleon Weavers, a Sulphury Seedeater, a
Yellow Sparrow ( luteus ), and a pair of Black and Yellow Grosbeaks
(Mycerobas melanoxanthus) ; these birds bred this year, but the young
were not reared, and the old birds did not attempt to nest again.
Aviary 12.--A pair of Quoys Crow-Shrikes ( Cracticus quoyi),
believed to be the only pair in captivity in Europe. Large birds, the
size of a Jackdaw, they are very tame, and have a series of beautiful
bubbling notes ; they remind one of the Piping Crow of Australia.
Aviary 13.--A very large flight aviary, roughly measuring 75 feet
in length by 25 broad, and 30 feet high, it has no shelter, but one end
is boarded and roofed in. It is thickly planted at the back with laurel,
box, and bamboo, the grass in front being kept mown ; it contains
a good-sized pool, surrounded by clumps of ornamental grasses and
irises. It is inhabited by the following birds : Two Sacred Ibises, one
Australian White Ibis, a pair of Cayenne Rails, three Oyster-catchers,
several Knots, six or seven Ruffs and Reeves, a pair of Alpine Choughs,
which generally make a nest in a hollow log every spring, but never
get any further, a Nicobar Pigeon, out the whole year round, and a flock
of Australian Crested Bronze-winged Pigeons (lophotes), which breed
freely. A common cock Goldfinch mated to a hen Greenfinch live here

too and nest regularly, but the Choughs or Ibises always take the
young ones.
Aviary 14.--A Jackal Buzzard, bred here twenty-five years ago, and
a Cara-cara.
Aviary 15.--A very fine adult King Vulture, perfect in every way.
Aviary 16.--A pair of Kolbs Vultures, and an adult Brown Milvago,
the latter perfectly tame and loves to come to the front of the aviary
and have its head scratched.
Aviary 17.--A Black-throated Buzzard-eagle ( Busarellus nigricollis),
a very rare Hawk in captivity.
Aviary 18.--A female Montagu's Harrier, the male died this summer ;
bred in Norfolk and now fully adult.
Aviary 19.--A Rufous-tailed Buzzard, and an unidentified Harrier-
eagle from South America, rather resembling the Chilean Sea Eagle.
Aviary 20.--A very fine pair of American White-headed Eagles,
now reaching full maturity.
Aviary 21.--A pair of Rosella Parrakeets, a pair of Crimson-wing
Parrakeets, a hen Pennants Parrakeet, a pair of Ring-necked Parrakeets,
a Kagu.

and a pair of Tataupa Tinamous.
Aviary 23.--A pair of Spreo Starlings, one bred here last year, and
some Purple-headed Glossy Starlings.
Aviary 24.--A very large flight cage and shelter, it contains four
Scarlet Ibises, three Little Egrets, a Javan Grey-backed Egret, some
Bufi-backed Herons, two Pileated Herons, and an Australian White-
fronted Heron, Notophoyx novae-hollandice, a very pretty slim, grey,
and rufous bird, about the size of a Night Heron.
Aviary 25.--Several Common Glossy Starlings, a single Red-
shouldered Marsh Bird, and a pair of Cuban Tree Quails.
Aviary 26.--Three White-crested Jay Thrushes.
Aviary 27.--A pair of Sclater's Ground Pigeons ; these lay regularly
every year, but although the young have hatched, they have never
been reared. In several cases the old bird has broken her egg on the nest
either from carelessness or some other cause, she generally then eats it.

Scarlet, Orange Bishops, Baya, and Black-throated also inhabit this
aviary.
Aviary 28.--A very fine pair of Purple-crested Turacous, a Kuhl's
Ground Thrush, Geocichla interpres, and Zebra Finches.
Aviary 29.--A very long flight aviary, some 70 feet long by 15 feet
wide, with an unheated shelter at one end. It contains forty or fifty
green and yellow Budgerigars, a pair of Common Glossy Starlings,
a Red-shouldered Marsh Bird, three Black-tailed Godwits, a Redshank,
two South American Spur-winged Plovers, and a pair of Bamboo
Partridges, sp. ?.
Aviary 30.--A flock of Blue Budgerigars, and a Maleo, in perfect
condition, just assuming its top-knot and its pink breast; the pair to
it, an equally fine bird, escaped this summer, when the aviary was
being cleaned out, and although seen about in the woods near by, has
not so far been recaptured.
Aviary 31.--This is more of a small enclosure than an aviary, and
contains a Porcupine.
Aviary 32.--Three Plumed Jays.
Aviary 33.--A Red-eyed Glossy Starling, and another, probably
L. chloropterus, a pair of Collared Jay Thrushes, a pair of Green
Cardinals, a Black Indian Francolin, and two Black Rails.
Aviary 34.--A large and roomy flight, well planted with trees and
shrubs. It contains three Donaldson's Turacos; a male Scarlet Tanager;
three White-headed Starlings; an Indigo Finch; a pair of Red-crested
Cardinals; three Wheatears, most charming little birds when once
established, they sit continually on the large stones in the aviary flight,
always flicking their tails, and flying off to catch a passing insect; a
Black Rail, very tame; and an Abyssinian Spotted Francolin; and last
but not least a fine pair of Renauld's Ground Cuckoos, lately received
from Mr. Delacour, a description of these rare birds appeared in the
Magazine for September, 1927.
Aviary 35.--A pair of small Jay Thrushes, believed to be I. cinerei -
ceps; a pair of Rose-coloured Pastors, the cock continually singing; a
Shamah; an Indigo Bunting; and a male Painted Quail.

H. saurophagus.
Aviary 37.--A pair of G-uira Cuckoos, very tame and full of character,
but susceptible to the cold.
Aviary 38.--Two Motmots, a pair of Golden-breasted Toucanettes,
and a rare Babbler, which has not been identified.
Aviary 39.--A Toco Toucan, a bird with an evil temper.
Aviary 40.--A pair of Ariel Toucans, and a pair of Green-billed

roomy aviary, where they have plenty of room to fly and display
themselves.
The Bird Room .--One side of this is fitted up with large cages,
3 or 4 feet long by 2 feet high. They contain respectively a pair of
Koyal Starlings, a Bell Bird in perfect condition, which calls loudly
every day, a six-plumed Bird of Paradise, a Wallace's Bird of Paradise,
an adult King Bird of Paradise, a Hooded Pitta, a pair of Beus's
Whistling Thrushes, a pair of Amethyst Starlings, a Greater Spotted
Woodpecker, and a Malachite Sunbird, a celebrated winner of prizes,
whose doings have been already recorded in the Magazine.
In smaller cages are a Black-headed Sugar-bird, three Yellow-winged
Sugar-birds, a Sun Conure, a pair of White-breasted Caiques, a Blue
Mountain Lory, and a Black-capped Lory.
The Garden Pond contains the following Waterfowl:--Three Bed-
billed Tree Ducks, one Black-billed Tree Duck, one Fulvous Tree Duck,

Wigeon, a pair of Chiloe Wigeon, a pair of Tufted Ducks, and a pair of
Chestnut-breasted Teal.
Enclosure 1.--A flock of Flamingoes, a pair of Stanley Cranes, very
tame, a Screamer, a pair of Bernicle Geese, a pair of Brent Geese, and
numerous Silver Pheasants.
Enclosure 2.--A very large enclosure, somewhat thickly planted with
shrubs and trees, it contains a pair of Sarus Cranes, many Silver
Pheasants, which breed freely every year ; the Wallabies also live here
and do exceptionally well on the light soil.
Enclosure 3.--A pair of Lilford's Cranes, Silver Pheasants, and a
small flock of Soay Sheep.
Enclosure 4.--A pair of Cereopsis Geese.
Enclosure 5.--The largest paddock of the series, being some three
acres in extent. Here are kept a pair of White Asiatic Cranes, seven
Demoiselle Cranes, one very dark, almost a melanism, three Crowned
Cranes, White Rheas, and a Tantalus Stork. A large converted shed
at one end makes convenient winter quarters for those birds which
need it.
Enclosure 6.--A pair of Pileated Guans, a pair of Grey-backed
Trumpeters, Vulturine Guineafowls, a pair of Razor-bill Curassows,
and a pair of Eared Pheasants ( Crossoptilon) are the occupants of this
enclosure, which leads from one block of aviaries to another ; it has
plenty of winter accommodation in the shape of sheds and houses
surrounding, where the birds can be kept dry and warm, without
artificial heat.
And the final and most recent addition to the Keswick Zoological
Collection, which I shall mention, is a very large Bird-eating Spider
from the West Indies, which recently arrived in Norwich in a crate
of bananas.

unaffected by the vile weather and our breeding results, particularly
of the Parrakeets, are well up to standard, though some of the other
birds, especially Zebra Finches, have not done so well as in previous
years.
The following have all successfully reared young ones during 1931 :--

</reference>
<bodyText confidence="0.995682375" page_id="56182115"  page_num="340" year="" vol="">
All the Parrakeets, with the notable exception of Bourke's and
Blue-wings, bred here last season as well, when we were also successful
with Elegants. These, however, failed this year owing to the old
breeding hen dying in April from peritonitis caused by an egg bursting
inside her when she was on the point of laying. A new hen was acquired
but she at once started a heavy moult and has so far shown no desire
to breed. Blue-wings are the least scarce and perhaps the most easily
bred of the Grass-Parrakeets.
Some Turquoisines, even when they lay fertile eggs (and a pair
take some time before they are properly mated) are unfortunately
not over reliable either as sitters or parents ; but the cock in breeding
plumage is such an exquisite little bird that no efforts must be spared
to keep this dwindling species from finally dying out.
The rearing of young Bourke's is an event of interest and by no
means a simple achievement, for perhaps of all Parrakeets Bourke's
are the most fussy about their nesting site, and what is more, a hen
Bourke's, unlike other Parrakeets, will not even condescend to inspect
a box that does not exactly fulfil her requirements or is not placed
in the precise position she considers the most suitable in the aviary.
One of our pairs was given four different kinds of nest from which to
choose in the inside shelter, but though both were in obvious breeding
condition, the cock continually feeding the hen, matters got no further
until a box was placed under cover, in the outside run, when the hen
instantly inspected it and had started laying within a week. Her

E. J. Boosey and Alec Brooksbank--Breeding Besults 841
choice of a nesting site, however, proved to be most unfortunate as
three of the four young ones she hatched succumbed when about
two days old to the cold of that particular night in July when a frost
was actually registered, and no doubt had the box been in the shelter
all would have been well.
We now possess, therefore, and have bred four of the seven known
species of G-rass-Parrakeet. It seems extremely unlikely that the
remaining three, the Splendid, the Rock Grass, and the Orange Bellied
will ever again come into the hands of aviculturists. 1
The Hybrid Turquoisine X Blue-wings are the progeny of a cock
Blue-wing and hen Turquoisine, and it will be interesting when they
have moulted out to see which parent they take after most. They
started by being very like their father, but are now hardly distinguish-
able from rather large hen Turquoisines except for a few characteristic
Blue-wing mannerisms and the fact that their blue is a shade darker
than that of a true Turquoisine. Our oldest breeding pair of Brown's
reared nine youngsters this season and besides being model parents
in every way always seem to manage to produce their families in even
pairs ! This pair have fully reared sixteen young during the past two
summers.
Many-colours (which we have now succeeded in fairly well
establishing) seem to be only single brooded provided they approve the
number of young reared in the first nest. An old pair, which have
lived to our knowledge in an aviary for fifteen years, though not all this
time with us, produced two in their first nest, and not being satisfied
with this effort nested again and produced another four, whilst another
pair of birds produced five from their first clutch and did not lay again.
With regard to the Pinches. There is no doubt whatever that they
prefer a dry, hot summer, and it is difficult to get them properly going
if spring is delayed or cold and wet.
As previously stated, our Zebra Finches have not produced their
standard average, and from a theoretical expectation of 600 young
we shall only obtain about 450.
1 Since writing these notes we hear that about six Splendids have been
obtained and are now in Mr. Harvey's aviaries in Australia. We shall hope
to hear that he has been successful in breeding them.

342 E. J. Boosey and Alec Brooksbank--Breeding Results
Again, all our Ruficaudas, which are usually double brooded and
should rear from seven to ten youngsters per season, only nested once,
with the exception of a pair who reared five in their first nest and laid
again but refused to sit. The eggs from the latter nest were, however,
successfully transferred to Bengalese. Young Ruficaudas do a half
moult when about four months old but take, like young Gouldians,
from seven to nine months to come into full adult plumage, and the
cocks seem to get redder and redder on the face as time goes on,
obtaining full colour about the third year. They breed, however,
quite successfully their first season, although it is then easy to mistake
young cocks for hens. They require live food when rearing young,
although we have had pairs that have refused to touch any, rearing
their young exclusively on rye-grass, and dry seed.
Our Long-tailed Grass Finches were the only Finches unaffected
by the weather and seemed to make up their minds it was not worth
troubling about. They have all done remarkably well, one pair producing
sixteen young during the season. (It is interesting to note that this
pair were both aviary bred here last year, which dispels the theory
that cocks of this species bred in captivity are usually infertile.) About
fifty have been reared. A Long-tailed Grass Finch hen mated to a cock
Heck's produced ten young, all of which turned out to be ordinary
Long-tails (yellow beak). It will be interesting to see whether they in
their turn throw Heck's (red beak) when mated inter se .
Cherry Finches do not seem to warrant the bad name they have
got as unsuccessful breeders, but they are rather addicted to turning
their young out of the nest. Of all the Australian Finches they are
probably the most beautifully marked, although they are not highly
coloured and consequently not so conspicuous as, for instance, the
many-hued Gouldian. They are particularly fond of rye-grass and
should be given a bundle of pea-sticks in which to nest, instead of
a box.
At the beginning of the season we had a whole aviary of Gouldians
stolen, and the thieves not only took the parents but their nests and
eggs as well. Consequently we are extremely short of these birds this
season, but hope to have replenished our stock by next year. They
are late starting to nest, and full results are not yet to hand, but somo

are already fledged, and by the noise the young make in their nests
we hope to have quite a nice lot.
It might be desirable here to give a little advice. Prospective
purchasers of Finches should be careful, if possible, always to obtain
aviary-bred birds. They are far hardier and the hens are not so liable
to egg-binding as imported specimens. Of the remaining birds reared
here the Jamaican Ruddy Quail Doves are probably the most interesting
especially as they have been more or less exterminated in their native
haunts by the imported Mongoose. One hardly realizes what truly
" ground " birds they are until one sees the young leave the nest when
only a few days old and about the size of newly hatched chickens, yet
fully capable of running about and looking after themselves and even
perching on low branches.
At the beginning of the year we fouud ourselves so pressed for
room that we were reluctantly forced to part with pairs of the more
ordinary species such as Redrumps, etc. We have now, however,
obtained further land on which to extend and hope to acquire them
again next spring. Notable recent additions to the farm are breeding-
pairs of the following:--Stanley Parrakeets, Pennant Parrakeets,
Bartlett's Bleeding Heart Pigeon, Blue-eyed Peaceful Doves, Lead-
beater's Cockatoos, African Grey Parrots, Red-collared Lorikeets,
Swainson's Lorikeets, Varied Lorikeets. We hope to be successful
with the Greys. They are almost certainly a true pair, and we have
heard of a gentleman in India who breeds so many he does not
know what to do with them !

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9836175" page_id="56182118"  page_num="343" year="" vol="">
By H. C. Eustace
Whilst at the London Zoo, soon after my return from China, I was
very pleased to see some specimens of the Black-throated Crow-tit
in an aviary near the entrance of the Bird House.
These birds were part of a small collection of fifteen which reached
the Shanghai bird market in the early spring of 1929 and were purchased

344 H. C. Eustace--Notes on the Black-throated Crow-tit
by Mr. Hampe and myself ; reference bas already been made to the
specimens at the Zoo (see the Magazine for July, 1929, p. 166), so
that I propose to jot down a few notes about the birds I kept for my
own aviary in Shanghai.
At first I put the birds in a large bamboo cage and fed them with
mixed seeds, such as millet, hemp, and sunflower, together with fruit,
nuts, and live insects, but before many days had passed it was necessary
to transfer them to an all-wire cage as they were playing havoc with
the woodwork.
From my observations, I gather that, like some Parrots, this
destruction of woodwork was primarily a form of exercise, and that
they were not hunting for insects concealed in the wood.
The birds rapidly settled down to their new quarters and within
the first few hours accepted insects from my fingers.
As the colouring and general appearance of both sexes are alike
I decided to turn them all into a small garden aviary hoping that one
pair might show signs of nesting when the remainder could be liberated
and the pair left to carry on undisturbed.
But--as so often happens in Aviculture--one cannot plan ahead,
and one morning I found my Crow-tits sadly reduced in number,
due to the garden coolie having forgotten to lower the screening the
night before, a cat or civet had disturbed the birds and chased them
on to the wire netting, managing to kill two outright and tear a leg
from each of two others.
This left me only three sound birds and the two maimed birds.
At first I thought it would be better to destroy these one-legged
birds, but as they continued to feed and remained quite active, I kept
them for a month and liberated them after their wounds were quite
healed.
Although food and water were placed outside the aviary the birds
disappeared after one or two days and did not return.
During the summer the aviary was troubled with snakes and by
August only one bird was left.
This bird, which had become quite tame, was liberated in September
and remained at full liberty in the garden for nearly three months,
during which time it was fed regularly two or three times a day in a

small feeding box attached to the wire of an aviary. It seldom left our
garden and would come flying to me for mealworms as soon as I
appeared in the garden.
After a few days at liberty it found sleeping quarters in the Pigeon
house and used this regularly until the time of its death, for I found
it dead one morning after a very severe typhoon.
The Black-throated Crow-tit makes an attractive pet bird, and
I hope on my return to China this winter to be able to obtain further
specimens and eventually to breed it in captivity.
I give the following extracts from my Notes :--
" Feeding.--In addition to seeds and insects the birds were very
fond of ripe fruits and berries ; biscuit, sponge cake, and nuts were also
appreciated. Small quantities of fat were eaten, but the bulk of the
food was vegetable matter, including the bark and leaf stalks of trees
in the aviary.
" In cages and aviaries these birds live peacefully together and are
safe to mix with other small birds, Finches, etc. . . .
" The vitality of these birds is extraordinary, as shown by their
recuperative powers after severe injury, and it was very interesting to
note the rapidity with which they found ways of overcoming their
disabilities. For example, two or three days from the time that the
birds were injured I noticed that where formerly food was held securely
between both feet whilst being eaten, when they had only one leg
they found corners in the aviary woodwork into which food was thrust
whilst being consumed.
" Also to rest the leg muscles the injured birds would hang head
down from a bough, or the aviary roofing wire, after the manner of

<bodyText confidence="0.998061233333333" page_id="56182121"  page_num="346" year="" vol="">
We, in England, have become quite familiar with Birds of
Paradise as one or more species are generally represented in the
London Zoological Gardens, where the list of species that have been
shown now totals over twenty out of the seventy or more that are
known. But few of us have realized the difficulty and dangers that
have to be encountered by those who would obtain these jewels of the
feathered tribe whom Nature has adorned in such extravagant
and varied fashion.
In England we have been particularly fortunate in the possession
of enterprising collectors, and so the majority of those birds that have
been captured alive have come here.
The first Birds of Paradise to be received by the New York
Zoological Park were three Greater Birds which arrived in 1910, since
which date occasional other specimens were obtained, but the
authorities there, especially the Curator of Birds, Mr. Lee S. Crandall,
were determined if possible to obtain a representative collection of
these birds even though this involved a special expedition to New
Guinea to collect them. Having obtained the necessary leave to go,
Mr. Crandall was fortunate in securing the services of Mr. John Ward,
of Sydney, who was well acquainted with the country, to assist him
with his task, which was no easy one for a stranger to a land of great
difficulties and hardships.
Those who imagine that to see and capture Birds of Paradise one
has only to set foot on the shores of New Guinea, have much to learn
of this wonderful island which is 1,400 miles long, mostly formed of
high mountains wdiose slopes are covered with impenetrable vegetation.
It is not until one has climbed on foot for many days, with native
carriers, who are not too keen on the job, and hence difficult to obtain,
to convey one's necessities of life over rough mountain tracks, through
raging rivers and along the edges of precipices, that one hears the call

of a Paradise Bird. Then, and not until then, may an axe-head which
has cost a few cents in civilization be worth a Blue Bird of Paradise.
Scarcity of food was one of the difficulties the travellers encountered,
and on several occasions the success of the expeditions was much
endangered by the prospect of starvation, but perseverance and
endurance were eventually rewarded, and the collection reached the
coast. But troubles were not at an end, for the steamer which was to
convey the travellers and their priceless cargo to Sydney ran aground
on a coral reef, where after a wait of a week with the danger of complete
shipwreck the party was rescued by another boat. Several weeks
later New York was safely reached with forty Birds of Paradise and
two hundred lesser relatives, alive and happy.
Mr. Crandall's book is extremely interesting, for it tells us just how
these birds are got, and gives us an insight into the mysterious land
they inhabit, its natives, who still use stone axes, and its vast tracts
of forest and mountains.

This great work of Dr. Casey Wood will be found of very great
value to the serious student of zoology in any of its branches, for by
its use he will be able to find references to the works of others in his
particular branch of study from the earliest times. The chapters
devoted to the early writers are full of interest and instruction, while
the name of any author or work can be found at once.
The Avicultural Magazine has its proper place among other
works of importance, and at the end of its long list of volumes appears
the following note :---
This Magazine is a scientific periodical of the greatest value not only
to students of avian domestication, but to ornithologists in general. It is
written (by numerous naturalists of note) and well edited by ornithologists
of international repute. Finally, it is well printed. The illustrations, both black
and coloured, are of the best, although the latter were (very properly) omitted
during the World War. It is appropriate that the premier magazine on general
aviculture should be published in England, the home of domestic faunaculture.

There are few more fascinating pursuits than that of bird watching,
and I have no doubt that almost all of the members of the Avicultural
Society spend the greater part of their time during a holiday in the
country in watching the wild birds that frequent the neighbourhood.
They never go for a ramble without their field-glasses and note-book,
and their most delightful memories of a holiday are those which bring
back the discovery of some rare species that they have never before
been fortunate enough to see in its wild state, such as the Bearded Tit,
on Heigham Sounds, or the Cornish Chough on Tintagel rocks. Yes,
most of us are bird watchers of a sort, and derive immense pleasure
from the habit, but we don't all know how to pursue our pastime to
the best advantage and to make our efforts of some real use to science.

NESTING OF TWO RARE DUCKS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996263043478261" page_id="56182124"  page_num="349" year="" vol="">
Sir, --Mr. Webb, the well-known collector of birds, last year
brought some Meller's Ducks (Anas melleri) from Madagascar. This
Duck represents the Mallard in Madagascar, and is peculiar to the
island. It is a resident species, which is found all over the country on
lakes and marshes. It is one of the largest of Wild Duck, and one of
the best for the table. Its colour is not very attractive, being in both
sexes like that of a female Mallard, but darker, with a long and strong
bill of a dark olive colour. This bird has rarely been imported before.
I was lucky enough to secure a pair, and they were put on my pond
with the Black-necked Swans and other small Ducks. In May I noticed
the hen bird sitting in a nest-box that had been supplied for Mandarins.
Four young were hatched, and were successfully reared by the parents.
They are almost as big as their parents now, and are full winged, and
I hope they will stay. I believe this is the first time this bird has
been reared in England.
The other rare Duck that nested with me was the Madagascar
White-backed Duck (Thalassornis leuconota insularis). Some of these
were imported by Mr. Webb from Madagascar, and I believe for the
first time. This is a much more attractive bird than the Meller's Duck,
and is most peculiar in its shape and habits. There is only one species
of that genus with two geographical sub-species, one occupying the
whole of Tropical Africa and the other peculiar to Madagascar. These
Ducks are most sedentary, spending the greater part of their lives on

the same small piece of water, which is always partly covered with
vegetation, such as water-lilies, reeds, and rushes. They dive very
easily, but seldom fly, and in fact hardly ever move to any distance.
They are distributed all over the island. Their colouring is not brilliant,
and they are curiously marked with black and buff, with a white patch
on the back. I got a pair of these from Mr. Webb last year, and they
were put on a small pond with Mandarins, Carolines, and Pink-headed
Duck. In June the hen was found sitting on three eggs in a nest on
the ground, which was covered over by reeds. The eggs were enormous
for such a little bird, and of a dark chocolate colour. The Duck
deserted the nest after sitting on the eggs for over three weeks. I then
put the eggs under a broody hen, and they all hatched out in perfect
condition, but the Ducklings only lived for ten days. I feel certain
they would have been reared successfully had the Duck hatched them
off herself and taken them on the water with her. I hope next year
to rear some successfully.

Sir, --With reference to yours in the November number, I have
been fortunate enough to rear two nests of three each from a pair
of Turquoisines. The last three left the nest about a week ago, and
seem strong birds.

THE NEW YORK HUMMING BIRD
With reference to Mr. Crandall's letter which appeared on page 292,
the Editor wrote to him asking for details of the treatment which had
resulted in a Humming Bird living in the New York Zoological Park
for three years and four months. Mr. Crandall has kindly replied as
follows :--
"We change the food for our Humming Birds early in the morning,
sometimes at noon in very hot weather, and again just before five o'clock.

This last feeding is left in the cage overnight, and even in hot weather
is still sufficiently fresh to be harmless to the birds before it is renewed,
early in the morning. We use the usual mixture of condensed milk,
Mellin's Food and honey, diluted in water.
" We try to keep the temperature of our building somewhere around
70 degrees, but as, of course, there is some fluctuation, we have
introduced a small resistance unit into the Humming Birds' cage to
make sure that there is sufficient warmth. I really attribute the loss
of the specimen about which I wrote you to the failure of this resistance
unit during a sudden chilly night. The bird was comatose the following
morning, and continued efforts failed to revive him.
" When cut flowers are available, we keep a few in the cage at all
times, and during the winter months, replace them with a flowering
begonia or something of the sort. When the weather is warm enough,
we place the cage out of doors in the direct sunshine for an hour or two,
and in the winter have made some use of an ultra-violet lamp. I am
under the impression that the great amount of sunshine with which
we are blessed is a most important factor in keeping Humming Birds
alive.
We now have a very nice specimen of Gould's Violet-eared Humming
Bird, Petasojphora iolata, which we have had about six weeks. It is
doing very nicely at present, but not having had previous experience
with the species, know nothing of its potential longevity."
THE FORTHCOMING CRYSTAL PALACE SHOW
The Show, which will take place from 4th to 6th February, 1932,
should be an improvement on all previous ones so far as foreign birds
are concerned, for a real improvement in the housing of this section
has been decided upon. The foreign birds are to be accommodated
in the large restaurant in which a minimum temperature of 60* Fahr.
can be guaranteed, and so no anxiety on this score need deter the
owners of the most delicate birds from exhibiting. The lighting of
this room is also good. The Show is now a national one, in every
sense of the word, and is organized by the officials of the Crystal Palace,

The Index-Guide
which is the property of the nation, so that any profit derived from the
undertaking will go to the upkeep of the Palace or the improvement
of future shows.
The classification is a generous one, and there will be thirty-five
classes for foreign birds, these being divided into three sections, each
under a separate judge, namely : (1) Parrots (or what are termed
" Parrot-like birds ", but they are all Parrots) ; (2) Seed-eating birds
other than Parrots, and (3) Insectivorous, and Nectar-feeding birds.
We note that Gouldian Finches are to have a whole class to themselves.
The secretary of the Show, Mr. S. A. Legg (Crystal Palace, S.E. 19),
is appealing for donations to enable him to increase the prize-money
for the foreign birds, and it is hoped that those who have the welfare
of this very interesting and instructive annual event at heart will
generously respond.

The Index-Guide to the Avictjltural Magazine from its commencement
in 1894 to the end of 1930, which was so much needed by our members,
has now been completed by Dr. Hopkinson, and can be had from Messrs.
Stephen Austin &amp; Sons, Hertford, for 10s. 6d. post free. It is bound in cloth
in the same style as the annual volumes of the Magazine and so forms
an extra volume to the series. Although Dr. Hopkinson has most generously
relieved the Society of the expense which the compilation of such a volume
might have entailed, the cost of printing and binding the edition has necessarily
been considerable, and I would ask all members to order a copy without
delay and so help to defray the expenses incurred.

AVICULTURE, VOLS. II AND III
These two volumes, which complete a work of great practical use to
aviculturists, are now ready and can be obtained, price 155. each (postage
for the two volumes, 9 d.), from our publishers. The edition is limited to 300
copies and volume i is already out of print. The volumes each contain a
very large number of coloured and uncoloured plates.
