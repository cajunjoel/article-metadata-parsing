The Medal may be awarded at the discretion of the Committee to any
Member who shall succeed in breeding, in the United Kingdom, any species of
bird which shall not be known to have been previously bred in captivity in Great
Britain or Ireland. Any Member wishing to obtain the Medal must send a detailed
account for publication in the Magazine within about eight weeks from the date
of hatching of the young, and furnish such evidence of the facts as the Executive
Committee may require. The Medal will be awarded only in cases where the
young shall live to be old enough to feed themselves, and to be wholly independent
of their parents. No medal can be given for the breeding of hybrids, or of local
races or sub-species of species that have already been bred.
The account of the breeding must be reasonably full so as to afford
instruction to our Members, and must appear in the Avicultural Magazine before
it is published or notified elsewhere. It should describe the plumage of the young,
and be of value as a permanent record of the nesting and general habits of the species .
These points will have great weight when the question of awarding the Medal
is under consideration.
In every case the decision of the Committee shall be final.
The Medal will be forwarded to each Member as soon after it shall have been
awarded as possible.

This extremely beautiful bird is found in the higher wooded slopes
of the Central and Eastern Himalayas. As in the case of other birds
inhabiting these lofty regions, Tragopan work gradually down at the
approach of winter. Even then, however, they are not very gregarious,
though it is reported that one or two young birds and the mother
keep together for the greater part of the winter. When they feel
approaching danger they slip silently away into the bamboo thickets.
The call note is very distinct from either the alarm or the challenge
cries. The male utters the call as a prelude to his nuptial display--
a high, rather quavering " Baa ! baa ! baa ! " But the challenge of the
adult cock is a most remarkable sound with wonderful carrying power.
When heard 50 yards away its deep half-booming, half-bleating character
is very evident. Tragopan cocks in captivity utter this call only during
a few days of the breeding season, but in wild birds the challenging is
kept up for at least two weeks and probably longer.
They are omnivorous feeders but leaves and buds form their principal
diet with the young green shoots of bamboo, seeds of rhododendrons,
and wild fruit, with some insects.
In confinement they soon become pleasantly tame and wfill take
tit-bits from the hand. They are monogamous, and more amiable to
their wives than most of the true Pheasants. The hens as a rule make
good and careful mothers.

By George Hampden Edwards
I was holidaying on the North Wales coast when a happy idea
occurred to me. A sunny morning in early September found me
motoring along the coast and on to the Queensferry slipway, en route
for Yorkshire. Gatley, Stockport, and then a long climb to Woodhead
and over the grand Pennine Kange down to Huddersfield.
Huddersfield is on my avicultural map, because Mr. George Beever
lives there. He gave me a kindly welcome, and I lunched with him.
The talk was 90 per cent Pheasants, and 10 per cent on the beauties
of Yorkshire, and my hour's stay passed all too quickly listening to
this keen Pheasant lover. Unfortunately, he has no birds at the moment,
but is about to erect aviaries on his premises, and if I were given three
guesses as to what his first purchase will be, I should say " Amherst "
--three times ! Amongst other things, he showed me a large and
remarkably fine water painting of a Lady Amherst cock ; I should
much like to see it reproduced in this Magazine some day.
Nawton and Kirby Moorside are small, picturesque villages, situate
at high elevation hard by the Cleveland Hills. All the villages beyond
York City appeared to be clean and beautiful. Lazy villages, unchanged
from the days of the stage coach. No granite kerbs confine the winding
lanes, and village streets. The roadways wind along the wolds unchanged,
save that they are macadam faced. But the two mentioned villages
are, or ought to be, famous. Nawton and Kirby Moorside, but three
miles apart, house the finest and most extensive collection of Pheasants
in the country. Which explains my visit to the North Biding.
At Nawton I had the pleasure of renewing acquaintance with
Mr. P. J. Lambert, who immediately took me to see Captain Scott-
Hopkins's birds at Kirby Moorside.
The Captain was feeding the birds when we arrived, and he showed
me over his collection. Now, Captain Scott-Hopkins is a real bird
lover. He loves birds in the real way. He attends to them personally,
feeds them, yes, cleans their aviaries, cares for them with meticulous

attention to detail--all of them--and his birds and aviaries are a
credit to British aviculture.
I first inspected a young Magpie, Corvus pica, a perfect plumaged
specimen, which, although young, exhibited a really marvellous sheen.
Makes one realize how little we appreciate our native birds, and I
made a mental note that I must acquire a Magpie again, now that
I am about to get a home outside the smoky town area. The Magpie
stood sentry to a long range of pheasantries, well planted with pretty
shrubs. Golden and Lady Amherst Pheasants, Chrysolophus pictus
and C. amherstise, were represented by remarkably healthy, perfect
looking birds. Hard by, Thorburn's [Beebes) portray of the Malay
Argus, Argusianus argus, found its counterpart in two perfect living
specimens.
Then, a beautiful pair of Reeves', Syrmaticus reevesi ; Mikados,
S. mikado ; Peacock Pheasants, Polyplectrons --all perfect. The genus
Gennasus, the Kaleege Pheasants, were present in several species, one
of the most interesting being the White Crested Kaleege, G. olbocristatus.
I say most interesting, possibly because the cock slipped into the
shelter and refused to come out, thus fermenting my interest. The
Captain allowed me to 1 go to the shelter, but all I could discern was
an alert perching form, typical Kaleege head, and wary eye. I could
also see the rather singular, lanced white breast feathers. Another
Kaleege, the Swinhoe's, G. swinhoii , was a real picture in the setting of
the well planted aviary. As with the other members of the genus,
the Swinhoe's is often pugnacious in the breeding season, so that a
well planted aviary with plenty of " cover" is a practical measure,
as well as a picturesque setting.
But the most outstanding member of the Kaleege tribe was the
finest Silver cock I have ever seen. Yes, a Silver ; a lovely, clean swept
bird with skin patches a glowing red, grand pencilling, and spotless
plumage. He displayed while we watched, and I am bound to say
I coveted that bird. But then, I recklessly broke the Tenth Command-
ment at almost everjr pen during my visit to the Captain's and Mr.
Lambert's respective premises.
I cannot mention all the Pheasants at Kirby Moorside, without being
in danger of making these notes appear catalogue like. But I must

make mention of one other Pheasant--a Satyr Tragopan, T. satyra --\0x25A0
which came up to the Captain in a most affectionate way, and he gave
the bird some green which it took from his fingers ; really, it was a
picture. I was informed that this bird had been in Scott-Hopkins's
possession for thirteen years, and I can well believe that it must be
one of the most treasured of his feathered possessions. Tragopans,
when properly cared for, are by nature tame and confiding, and it is
a wonder that they are not more sought after by aviculturists.
Indeed, it is a wonder to me why all aviculturists are not all Pheasant
keepers, for Pheasants are surely the richest gems of aviculture. It is
a large family, embracing a wide and varied manner of forms and
coloration, some of which cannot fail to please. The amazing, brilliant
hued Golden ; the indescribable Amherst, whose walk and poise is the
very definition of grace. The lustre-coated, stocky Impeyans, the wee,
soft feathered Peacock Pheasants. The affectionate, inquisitive Crossop-
tilons (an ugly name to bestow upon such domesticated looking,
handsome birds). The masterful Kaleeges--Nepals, Horsfield's, White-
crested, and others--the Firebacks, the Koklass Pheasants cf the
forests. The syrmaticus genus, which embraces the Copper Pheasants,
the Peeves', whose tail, practically 5 feet of barred, flowing beauty,
is proportionately as long as the Whydah's caudal plumes ; the mountain
loving Mikado of Formosa, and the resplendent, lovely Elliot's Pheasant,
and many others. Some are cheap, some are expensive ; all are
beautiful to a degree. Some are extraordinarily free breeders, and
a few offer scope for those who like the joy of trying to succeed where
others have failed. Pheasant keeping has something to offer everyone--
but how I digress !
Captain Scott-Hopkins showed me, in his house, two mounted
birds. One was a Satyr cock which had been an extraordinarily tame
and lovable creature, and which the Captain had had mounted purely
out of sentiment. The taxidermist had made a good job of it. The
other mounted specimen was a very rare one, and the sole known
member of the genus--the White-Tailed Wattled Pheasant, Lohio-
phasis bulweri, sometimes referred to as Bulwer's Pheasant. Hitherto,
I had only seen paintings of this Pheasant, without being much
impressed, but an actual specimen, even though but a mounted one,

gave me a better idea of an undoubtedly magnificent creature. What a
pity they are so rare in aviaries. Scott-Hopkins purchased this Bulwer's
when it was a yeai old, and it died when it attained its full plumage,
and, by the way, full plumage is not attained by hulweri until they are
three years old.
Next I inspected a conservatory that had been adapted to house
a lovely collection of exotic Finches. They were all lively, healthy
specimens. I left them, feeling that the view I had long held--that
the small exotic seed-eaters need to be kept under glass to do them
justice--had been confirmed.
Back to Nawton. Here, Mr. Lambert's wife gave me a cordial
welcome, and here I met Mr. Lambert's son, J. Lambert, who is the
Secretary of the Ornamental Pheasant Society, and as keen a Pheasant
lover as his father. There is an enormous range of pheasantries at
Nawton, and here again shrubs and bushes inside the pens make
delightful settings for the birds.
Whilst wandering around the pens, I noticed an exceptionally
fine Temminck's Tragopan, T. temmincki, a poem in carmines and
reds. Is there anything quite as lovely as a Temminck's ? This bird is
ten years old, and is still very fertile. Next I saw the Bornean Crested
Fireback, Lophura ignita, general plumage black, with a purple
sheen.
Swinhoe's were much in evidence. Silky of plumage, masterful of
carriage, no collection can possibly be complete without them. The
White (albinistic) Pheasants were very pretty. I saw two White
Pheasants ; I saw Satyr and Temminck's Tragopans ; I saw Impeyans,
Cheers, Elliot's, Crossoptilons--and the Crossoptilons were present in
blue and brown varieties. Peculiar looking birds, these ; and so very
tame. There is quite a dog-like devotion in their manner, and they
are birds that can be given free range.
There were adult and young albinistic Peafowl at Nawton. They
had not attained their full trains when I was there. Personally, I do
not consider the white Peafowl to be as pretty as the Green or the
Blue; nevertheless they are quite fascinating. To see an albino
Peacock display is to witness a splaying fan of white, and the tremulous

motion of the tail coverts enacts a miniature blizzard. But surely a
cold background for his passion.
I am proud of my namesakes in pheasantdom, Gennaeus edwardsi.
They are not gaudy, but are perfect little creatures. The Edward's
hen, softly brushed with the browns of autumn leaves, are not one whit
less attractive than the males, stained though they are a glossy whin-
berry purple. I think that shape and carriage count more than colour.
A shapely bird--oven if sombre--holds my attention far more than,
say, the multi-coloured, but heavily cross-bred Golden X Amherst
which has gained extra splashes of colour at the expense of the essentially
individual grace of its respective forbears.
I am opposed to crossing of species of varieties of species. The
argument that crosses have occurred in nature is no argument at all,
for this only happens through and by way of adaptation to the particular
environment of the species. If the cross is not adaptable, nature
exterminates ; but where the birds are man maintained, they live to
be sold and possibly pollute pure stock. I found in Mr. Lambert a
champion of keeping the species pure, and every bird I saw was un-
mistakably pure.
There were a great number of young Pheasants at NawTon. I passed
pen after pen of young stock--the strongest testimony to Mr. Lambert's
rearing methods--sturdy young Cheers, alert young Tragopans ; in
fact, all the poults were full of health.
Dawn begins early at Nawton. Long before the sky showed any
tinge of grey, I awoke. A strong wind was causing the leaves of the
climber about the window to play cymbals of rustling sounds, inter-
spersed with an occasional wistful note, the whistling cry of what
I subsequently discovered to be Oyster Catchers, Haematopus ostralegus.
Lapwings, Vanellus cristatus --spirit of the marshes--added their
wailing peewit, as I saw the square of sky greying, and then the dawn
chorus began in earnest; first a wilding--a Robin--nearby, then the
faint wheep, wheep, of a male or female Impeyan away over in the
pheasantries, and the more sonorant chir-r-pah of the Cheer.
I was almost in the lap of Morpheus again, browsing in the medley
of these delightful early morning sounds, when mine, host brought me

a cup of tea and told me it was " six o'clock, and time to be around and
about! "
I located the source of the night cries in a beautiful aviary in the
garden. The aviary was the home of scores of Waders. In it were
bushes, grass and stones, and a pool of informal design shaped roughly
in the form of a map of Great Britain.
The Oyster Catchers--there were several of them--are easily
domesticated. They are very pretty in their black and white plumage,
and long orange beaks. The eyes are truly beautiful--crimson irides,
and orange eyelids.
Swaysland, writing of the Oyster Catcher states that: " Some
years ago," i.e. previous to 1901, " a flock was kept in the grounds of
the Royal Pavilion, Brighton, where they attracted a great deal of
attention ... I well recollect an Oyster Catcher in the West of England
that lived for many years in a fowl yard ; it was quite tame and
associated with the fowls and pigeons in the most friendly way ..."
The Lapwings are very desirable aviary birds. Their short quick
walk which invariably ends in a period of deliberation and thoughtful
survey of the turf, is very charming to watch. They make delightful
pets, and are easily satisfied in the matter of food. At Nawton, they
are fed mainly on scalded biscuit meal. I intend making an aviary
for waders myself, as it is quite simple to make a shallow pool---2 or
3 inches deep--a few waders will amply repay the trouble spent.
There were several other waders including Dunlins, Tringa alpina,
and many other of the Sandpipers, and the interesting Ruff, Machetes
pugnax, which, by the way, is polygamous. They are very playful,
but easily got into a bad temper in the breeding season. There were
several females present. The hen, or Reeve, is very much like the
Ruff when the latter loses his ruff. A Wigeon, Anas penelope, was the
only member of the duck family in the aviary. Wigeons are by no
means as shy, in the wild state, as most waterfowl, and they very soon
settle down under domesticated conditions. One can very soon gain
the confidence of these Ducks and, by the way, their principal food
is--grass.
A Golden Pheasant cock added a touch of bizarre to this pleasing

collection ; but the friendly Golden is quite happy amongst any small
birds---bullying is not in his make-up.
I left Nawton and the beautiful North Riding of an early morning.
Twice I came across numbers of covert Pheasants crossing the roadway.
I made three resolutions : (1) To acquire an extensive collection of
Pheasants ; (2) to build an aviary for waders ; and (3) to revisit my
kind friends Captain Scott-Hopkins and Mr. P. J. Lambert as soon
as possible.

ACCLIMATIZATION OF FOREIGN BIRDS

To the average person the mention of a tropical island immediately
brings forth a vision of rich green foliage, brilliant flowers, and exotic
birds. Tahiti is no exception to this general impression as far as foliage
and flowers are concerned, but for some reason there is practically
no bird life, and according to reports made by early voyagers and by
ornithologists visiting the island later there have never been many
kinds of birds here.
Since the climatic conditions were favourable and the profusion
of grasses, weeds, and flowers provided a variety of foods, I could see
no reason why certain small birds from other countries of similar
climate should not thrive here and I started the experiment with a few
Fire Finches and Cordon Bleus which I personally brought with me
from Dakar, West Africa. The French Government has been very
sympathetic in my experiments, giving me necessary permits to import
birds and has passed local laws prohibiting all shooting and trapping.
Likewise the British Consul General has aided me considerably to
obtain permits to secure some of the exquisite and rare Australian
finches. I am just now expecting through the courtesy of Mr. H. B.
Brown, Secretary of the Taronga Zoo of Sydney, a shipment of about
five hundred birds from Australia, including Gouldian, Long-tailed,
and Star Finches all to be liberated as soon as they have been properly
conditioned.

The last named of this group were formerly quite plentiful here,
but have been extinct on Tahiti for many years. They are now to be
found only on certain atolls in the Tuamotus. They are very shy
birds and live in the tops of coco-nut trees where they feed on the
blossoms ; they of course disappeared as soon as they were liberated,
but must surely have found a natural habitat.
Birds which I am sure were Unable to Thrive
Black Swan (Chenopis atmta) ; Diamond Dove (Geopelia cuneata).
Before liberating any birds they are kept in aviaries a sufficient
length of time to observe their habits and to condition them. Upon
arrival they are put in a special house for observation and any sick
birds are immediately removed. The well birds are put in conditioning
aviaries to stay until they are in perfect plumage.
As soon as I feel that they are in a normal condition the birds are
transferred to the liberating aviaries which face the rose garden beside
my house. In the rose garden are feed dishes for the birds at liberty,
to which five or six hundred birds come regularly four times a day,
in response to my whistle. In the flights of the liberating aviaries are
feed dishes exactly like the ones outside in the rose garden. Also the
drinking and bathing fountains are correspondingly alike--one inside
for the caged birds and one just outside for the free ones. On the
side of the flights facing the garden and feed trays are trap doors which
can be operated from the terrace by cords. When I feel that the birds
in the aviaries are sufficiently accustomed to the routine of feeding,
I carefully pull open the trap door and let a few birds out every day
until the cage is empty. The first birds to be liberated stay in the
vicinity of the flight cage attracted by their friends left inside and by
the time they are all free they are accustomed to the outside feeding
trays and drinking fountain and a large percentage have found suitable
places nearby to sleep.

Of course this process necessitates great consultations as to the
weather. I ask all my native friends in the district whether or not we
will have any rain during the next three or four days and when the
majoiity say " no ", I start to liberate. Needless to say their judgment
is not infallible and an " unseasonable " wind and rain come within
twenty-four hours. The first Orange Breasted Waxbills that were
liberated chose to spend the night under the leaves of the pandanus
thatching on the roof of my house. This seemed a safe and comfortable
place until a tropical downpour in the middle of the night made me
doubt the wisdom of their choice. The rain came down with great
force and I was certain it would pack down the wet pandanus thatch
and permanently seal the birds in their new homes. But not at all--
the next morning they were out and about and eagerly at the feed
dishes and have evidently chosen the roof as their permanent home.
On the whole, weather conditions and climate are ideal for aviculture.
The temperature is never below 70* and rarely above 90* F. and I feel
that it is an ideal place for the various birds I have chosen. To be sure,
we are troubled to some extent by rats and mice, but there seems to
be no friction between the imported and indigenous birds. Among the
native birds are the following :---
Green Fruit Pigeon, Black and White Kingfisher, Black Flycatcher
(practically extinct), Small Bail, two or three Waders, small Wild
Duck, New Zealand Cuckoo (migratory), Golden Plover (migratory),
a variety of Tilt.
Gradually, through the presence of the birds I have imported,
people on the island are becoming bird conscious. The Governor,
Monsieur Chastenet de Gery, has established a feeding dish in the
grounds at Government House ; also James Norman Hall, co-author
with Mr. Charles B. Nordhofi of Mutiny on the Bounty , has put one up
on his property to attract any birds that may wander to his side of
the island. Mr. Nordhofi, who is keenly interested in water fowl, has
done a great deal to promote this interest by liberating Wood and
Mandarin Duck as well as California Quail and Pheasants.
We are receiving great help and encouragement from France
through the untiring efiorts of Monsieur Jean Delacour who is doing
everything possible to protect the birds throughout the French colonies.

By Frances E. Matthews
We have at the moment flying about in a rather spacious indoor
aviary a pair of hybrids whose father is a fine Longtailed Grass Finch,
and the mother an almost entirely White Bengalese. The birds feed
themselves, and are very healthy. Their first plumage resembles mostly
that of the young Longtailed Grass Finch. One bird is larger than the
other. The wings are dark and prettily shaded, the breast fawn colour.
There is the usual dark bib or tie very slightly developed, with a minute
white mark in centre under lower mandible. One bird has two very
minute white flecks on top of the head. The birds seem to be a pair,
and are both far larger than the mother. I think they will grow to be
as big as the father.
I consulted Dr. Hopkinson's records, and could find no mention
of this particular cross. I have since heard from him that this is the
first time this special cross has been reported to him. I may mention
that we did not aim to breed this type. The Longtailed Grass Finch
in the early summer lost his mate. Feeling very solitary he consoled
himself (tante de mieux) with a very ordinary Bengalese hen ; building
a marvellous grass nest for her in the outdoor aviary. His attentions
and patience seemed endless, though she never laid an egg. Later on
we found this White Bengalese hen, but they have lived indoors. She
laid several eggs but hatched out two birds.
THE TYRANNY OF " THE TRADE "
By Lord Tavistock
One of the more sinister, undesirable features noticeable in connec-
tion with the bird fancy of recent years has been the increasing tendency
of dealers and important firms selling bird food, etc., to try and stifle
legitimate criticism of their methods or wares and legitimate recom-
mendation of other people's products. The popular Fancy Press seems

scared stiff of them ! There is no packet Parrot Food on the market
known to me (or, I should imagine to anyone else), which is suitable
to form the staple diet of any species of parrot--but it is almost as
much as one's life is worth to say so !
If a certain food or food ingredient is of special value for certain
birds--as Dr. Allinson's Food is of special value for Lories--the day
is long past when, for the assistance of newcomers to aviculture, you
were permitted to mention it in the weekly bird papers by name.
It has got to be referred to as 44 a certain proprietary food " lest rival
firms selling, possibly, an inferior or unsuitable product, should get
jealous ! And should one ever be bold enough, even in the most
temperate and helpful way, to criticize the honesty or humanity of
any section of the dealers' fraternity what a hornets' nest is speedily
about one's ears !
I remember once seeing in a London dealer's window examples of
gross cruelty in the mismanagement and overcrowding of fish. When
I called attention to this in the Fancy Press a firm other than the
actual offender descended upon me with such wrathful protestations
of injured innocence that I was left with little doubt that my cap must
fit more heads than I realized !
On another occasion I was rash enough to be partly responsible
for the publication of the statement that 44 the maxim that honesty is
the best policy is no more universally realized in the bird trade, than
in other branches of livestock dealing ". Once more a clear (?) con-
science seemed surprisingly inadequate to protect the tender feelings
of the innocent from wounds that the qualifying word 44 universally "
should surely have spared them. More vigorous protests. Unfortunately,
however, the memories of some of the protesters were shorter than mine
and I had occasion to refresh them by recalling certain incidents that
I, at any rate, had not forgotten !
There is quite enough Fascism in the world without its taint being
extended to aviculture. There are honest dealers in the trade and
there are dishonest ones ; there is good stuff being offered for the use
of birds and there is plenty of rubbish. Let the good men and good
articles prevail by fair and free advertisement of their merits, and let
the bad suffer the exposure they deserve.

</sectionHeader>

We obtained a pair of these birds in June, 1935, and kept them
in a large cage in the house until the following December, when they
were liberated in a mixed aviary of Finches and Waxbills.
By the middle of January, they had built a nest in a low-growing
privet bush in the open flight. The nest was small for the size of the
birds, and beautifully made with soft pieces of wood fibre, unravelled
rope, and pampas grass.
Two rather long, greyish-white eggs were laid and the hen only
sat very closely for twelve days. At no time was the cock bird seen
to take any turn on the nest, but he sat on a near-by branch most of
the time and constantly fed the sitting hen.
On 31st January two young birds were hatched out, but the follow-
ing Sunday we experienced a severe cyclone and, although the hen
never left the nest during the storm, the young birds died two days
later.
The parents immediately set about repairing the nest and, in about
a week's time, the hen was again sitting on two eggs. Both eggs hatched,
but after four or five days one young one disappeared. The other grew
very rapidly and kept both birds busy feeding it. As soon as the young
bird hatched, we observed the old birds became almost entirely
insectivorous, and it was greatly owing to the kindness of Mr. G.
Rowland Hutchinson, who helped us obtain large supplies of crickets
and grasshoppers, that we were successful in rearing the young one.
On 8th March it left the nest when about two weeks old. For three
days the parents kept it hidden in the undergrowth. As it was wet,
stormy weather we were afraid we had lost it, but when they brought
it out, it was well-feathered and could fly fairly well. It is now a fine
young cock bird as big as its parents.

BREEDING THE ORANGE BISHOP WEAVER
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999001852941177" page_id="56318713"  page_num="15" year="" vol="">
About three years ago, I bought two pairs of Orange Bishop Weavers
out of colour. One cock came into colour and the other three birds
proved to be hens. There was no attempt at breeding the first year
and, in the winter, one bird got startled, flew into the wire netting,
and fell dead with a broken neck. It was, of course, the cock.
In the spring the three hens all made nests, laid eggs, and sat
but, as I was unable to get another cock, it meant another wasted
season.
On 3rd October, 1936, I received a cock Orange Bishop from the
Avicultural Society and turned him into the aviary with the hens and
a mixed collection of Finches. On 31st October there was a nest with
two eggs, and I found pieces of broken shell on the ground on
18th November, so conclude a chick hatched that morning.
They were quite strong little birds, perfectly feathered except for
a stumpy tail. They were unmistakably Orange Bishops and sat
flirting their wings in the characteristic manner. They were eating
soaked seeds and fending for themselves by 4th December, and I
consider were independent at that date.
Now for some general notes. The cock takes no part whatever either
in incubating the eggs or in feeding the young ones, nor did I ever see
him feeding the hens. He is a very busy builder, but the hens seem to
prefer nests that they construct themselves. In only one case has a
hen sat in a nest that the cock built, and that had direful results. He
built out in the flight in some tall grass-stalks and, although I tried
to protect the nest from above, a heavy downpour of rain one night
caused it to tip over and two eggs on the eve of hatching were thrown
out.
The usual clutch seems to be two eggs. They are a rather deep
blue in colour with no markings. The nest is pocket-shaped and hangs
from tea-tree twigs. It looks very frail, but is, in reality, very strong
and tough, being woven of grass-stems and fibre. The mother starts
weaving again as soon as the young are flown, not using the same nest
a second time.
They had the usual seeds necessary in a mixed aviary as well as.

soaked seed, with a little soft food daily and small gentles occasionally.
I could not spare them any mealworms as there were three baby Shamas
to be provided for as well when the first nest hatched. To date,
12th March, there have been six nests, the last one having eggs due to
hatch in a week's time. The first brood have moulted, but are not
showing any signs of sex difference in the feathering.

<bodyText confidence="0.991403615384616" page_id="56318714"  page_num="16" year="" vol="">
My Blue Mountain Lorikeets are in a large aviary together with
all my other Parrots and Parrakeets. About the middle of October,
I noticed a pair going in and out of a log box, so on peeping through
a crack I saw three eggs. Naturally, I was very excited, and it was
with some difficulty that I restrained my curiosity. The birds did not
sit closely but seemed to be popping in and out of the nest much of the
time. On the 1st November, when passing the log, I heard something
squeak, but naturally I did not look in, as I was afraid the hen might
leave the youngsters.
I was able to restrain my curiosity for a considerable time, but one
day it got the better of me, and on looking in all I could see was a heap
of grey wool, not much in reality to have broken my vow to myself
by looking into the nest. On looking into the nest again about a week
later, imagine my surprise when I saw two small heads looking around
everywhere. The youngsters did not show any signs of feathers until
they were four weeks old, and even then were very slow in feathering up.
At the end of two months they were fully feathered. On Christmas
morning, they were looking round for their Christmas-box by putting
their heads over the top of the nest, and by New Year's Day they both
came out of it, as big as the parents, and at the moment they are flying
around in the aviary as well as an adult bird.
On 20th November they were independent, feeding themselves on
the nectar, bread, and eating sunflower seed. In appearance they are
very much like their parents, almost as big, but much paler. They were
fed only once a day with nectar put into a drinking vessel as well as
a slice of bread, and then nectar was poured over the bread. Previous

to hatching, the parents were given apples, dates, the usual Parrakeet
mixture, Budgerigar mixture, and green foods. The nectar and bread
mixture was added just before the young were due to hatch.
For your further information, the pair of Lorikeets are again
thinking of nesting, while their tw o youngsters are very active indeed
in the aviary.

These birds were acquired from one of the importations for the
Society. One young one was bred in the 1935 season.
The birds chose as a nesting site a hollow puriri log, the opening
having a diameter not much more than 3 inches, and apparently a little
on the small size for the size of the bird. The opening of the log was
towards the passage-way in the aviary. The other end of the log was
blocked by a piece of wood, forming a rather good nesting hollow.
This was lined almost exclusively with white, soft fowl feathers.
Being away at the time, I cannot give full details, but young definitely
were hatched on 6th January, 1935. In all, it is thought that four
young were hatched, but successively three young ones died, leaving
one only in the nest. The food was mealworms, gentles, mincemeat,
grasshoppers and spiders, in addition to the usual soft-bill mixture.
The parents were very attentive to the young, and the loss of the three
other youngsters was probably on account of insufficient live food to
support that number. When the aviary attendant came with meal-
worms each two hours, the parent birds were waiting for him at the
gate, evidently listening for the outside gate to be opened.

The birds refused crickets for some reason, which is rather unusual,
as crickets usually appeal to insect-eating birds. The young Royal
left the nest when approximately three weeks old, and the parents
continued to feed it for some time. The bird, however, was completely
independent by the 14th February, 1935. The young was feathered
very much like the parents, only paler in colour and with a black iris
instead of white, as in the adult. This iris is a definite sign of age, for
it takes over a year for its change to white. The yellow on the breast
of the young was very pale in colour, but at the end of approximately
a year, assumed the brilliant yellow of the adult.
The young must continue to grow for more than a year for, although
at the end of that period there is very little difference in the colouring,
there is some difference in the size. It appears that it would not attain
its adult proportions under eighteen months. The following year the
same pair of birds w^ent to nest and again succeeded in rearing a young
one, which ultimately was exhibited at the Grand National Show in
1937 and secured the Presidents' Breeders' Trophy.

The parents were bought from an Eastern importation in 1934.
They were released later on in the year in a large aviary in which was
erected a vertical punga stem with in it a hole scooped out about
5 inches in diameter. A small amount of horse-hair and a few bamboo
leaves were deposited on the bottom of the hollow. Ultimately, four
eggs were laid and hatched out. The young were deposited the same
day as hatched on the path in the aviary--dead. 1934 was a failure.
It would not have been if more knowledge of the species and experience
had been possessed by myself.
On Sunday, 13th October, 1935, a pair of Shamas were turned
into an aviary by themselves with several nest-boxes hung up, including
one covered with willow bark and all nicely smeared with mud. On
27th October the hen Shama was noticed wdth fine hay in her beak.
On 10th November the hen Shama was sitting on the nest, the base
of which contained a few leaves, principally bamboo leaves, and the

nest itself inside the box was made of horse-hair carefully formed
into a neat cup. On Sunday, 17th November, three young and one egg
still unhatched were noticed. The weather was abominable, with rain,
wind, and cold. The next day two day-old Shamas were found still
alive on the concrete floor of the shelter in which was the food of the
parent birds.
These were replaced in the nest with the third one, which was still
there, and the cock bird immediately removed from the aviary. The
removal of the cock before the young Shamas are hatched is the real
secret of breeding Shamas in captivity. The hen bird continued feeding
gentles, mealworms, and an assortment of live insects such as slaters
and spiders to the three young ones. Probably she found some earth-
worms in the large grass aviary and other insects living in the herbage.
Mincemeat well moistened with water (a tip picked up in England
from Mr. Sydney Porter) was offered fresh daily. Considerable quantities
of mincemeat were consumed as the birds grew in size. The gentles
and mealworms were offered four times a day, but as the supply of
gentles increased, a large pot of them was left in the shelter all the
time.
On Sunday, 24th November, I looked in the nest and the three
young were doing well. Their eyes w T ere still closed, but their flight
feathers were growing strongly and evenly and encased in very long
quills. The skin of the birds had a distinctly greasy look and was
coloured dark brown. The nest itself was kept perfectly clean, and
the hen was very industrious in taking away the voidings and dropping
them in a corner of the shelter on a piece of paper which was kept there
for the purpose and changed daily. The voidings were encased in a
film of sufficient strength to sustain the force of being dropped over
12 inches and still remaining intact.
The quantity of mincemeat consumed increased daily. The hen
" killed " the mincemeat by knocking it on the ground before taking
it to the nestlings. On Friday, 29th November, late in the evening,
the three young Shamas made a great noise and left the nest, alighting
on a peach tree about 4 feet from the nest. At dusk they were forcibly
returned to the nest, as the weather was not promising and, after
doing this, the hen immediately gave them all a meal of mealworms.

20 Breeding Successes in New Zealand
Next morning, however, the three youngsters were out again bright
and early.
During the next three days, they commenced to fly round the
aviary, two being particularly strong on the wing. Food given all the
time w~as the usual prepared Shama food together with mincemeat
well w etted, and the range of insects already mentioned. The young
were considerably paler than the hen on the breast, but totally different
on the head and neck, which, on a dark background, is covered with
rows of brown feathers, giving a mottled appearance. The wing feathers
also were mottled, but the rump, instead of white as in the adult, was
jet black. The legs were pale flesh colour and the eyes very big and black,
with a light brown eye streak. The young Shama is a splendid example
of nature's protective colouring, and providing they remained still,
it was almost impossible to see the young birds in an aviary containing
growing vegetation, brilliant sunlight still further increasing the
difficulty of seeing them owing to their appearance still further blending
with alternating sunlight and shadow. I have looked for minutes at a
time in bright sunlight at a peach tree in full foliage with long grass
growing up to its low r er branches, and failed to locate the young Shamas
perched on its branches until they themselves drew attention to their
presence by their distinctive chirp and the flick of their absurd little
tails. The green and yellow leaves of the grass, combined with bright
sunlight and shadows of the peach tree leaves, provided a background
against which the broken, mottled appearance of the youngsters
made them invisible.
As the birds grew, the white side tail feathers developed rapidly
and, with tails 2 inches to 2J inches long, these white feathers were
most noticeable. The black centre tail feathers now grew rapidly and
soon almost concealed the white feathers of the tail. On 15th December,
1935, the Shama hen was sitting on three more eggs, so I concluded
that before that date the young were independent.
The sex can be distinguished with almost certain accuracy when
a few weeks old, by noticing the definite colour on the breast, the cocks
having a decidedly darker hue then the hens. It being necessary to
remove the cock bird when the hen had been sitting from ten to twelve
days and then allowing her to rear the young ones, it usually happens

that she lays a clutch of clear eggs before you are certain that the
youngsters are independent. Laying eggs is not so much a strain
on the bird as is the feeding of the young.
Indian Shamas were bred again in 1936, when an aviary bred cock
bird was mated with an imported hen and reared healthy youngsters.
Shamas are most delightful birds, combining as they do a most beautiful
song, pleasing shape, and graceful movement together with rich
browm colours, black, and white. Their elongated tails give them the
appearance of monster Fantails. They are hardy birds and live out-
doors in Auckland throughout the winter.

During a trip to England at the beginning of 1935, I passed through
the Panama Canal and, while there, secured a small number of various
Central and South American birds. Most of these arrived safely in
London and were landed with a remarkable freedom of red tape and
absence of official inquisitiveness, at any rate, to one well versed in
the ways of New Zealand officials. In London they found temporary
housing in the quarantine department of the London Zoo, thanks to
the generosity of Mr. Seth-Smith, F.Z.S., Curator of Birds.
A room, 16 feet by 10 feet, with a permanent temperature ot 65*F.
was placed at my disposal free of charge, so that the South American
birds had a few days to recover from the voyage and were fed upon
an attractive shore diet. One morning, after they all had time to feed,
they were placed in several small cages on the back seat of Mr. Sydney
Porter's car, entirely regardless of the upholstery. We left London
about midday for Derby, a distance of about five hours' journey by
road in mid-winter. It was w ell that the birds had had ample time to
feed before leaving the warm Zoo quarters, and had full cups before
departure.
During the run north, the weather conditions became worse.
Heavy, dull clouds obscured the sky. Sunshine and cloudless skies so
lately enjoyed on the voyage were a delight of the past. Getting on to
the higher country, snow began to fall and, before long, the only spot

on the windscreen kept clear was that under the arm of the mechanical
wiper. Driving was no sinecure--the road was slippery, vision obscured,
and the back of the car absolutely filled with cages, some of which
had to be held in position with out-stretched arm all the journey.
Now, this is a bird story, but fish must be introduced. Before leaving
London, a call was made at Damage's and a pair of Angel fish secured.
These required a temperature of round about 60 to 70* to be com-
fortable. The warmest place that we could think of to keep them during
the trip was securely wedged between ourselves and the seat, while,
at the few stops we did make, warm water was added to the contents.
The fish had to have some air, however, and the lid was not tightly
fitted. Moisture developed on the seat and later penetrated our clothing,
but still we stuck to the job and, between us, kept the Angel fish warm.
This, however, is just by the way.
The snow-storm through which we were passing became heavier
and even the wiper had to be cleared every now and then as the weight
of snow on it and the increasing thickness proved too great for its
motive power. There were even, to my mind at least, visions of motorists
stranded all night, held in by snowdrifts, gradually freezing to death
in company with a strange assortment of tropical birds and, between
them, a can of tropical fish found in a block of frozen ice ! Even
Sherlock Holmes would have been puzzled to explain the presence of
an Englishman and a New Zealander and such a cargo frozen stiff
miles from nowhere.
Fate, however, was on our side and, after an hour or so of slow, steady
progress with frequent stops to clear the snow from the windscreen
and make sure the precious bird cargo was still well-covered with
sacks and coats, and getting what warmth it could from the engine,
the snow ceased falling and a high, cold wind took its place. Fortunately
we could keep the car windows tightly closed all the time, otherwise
I dread to think of the results. The atmosphere cleared, the countryside
was covered by a blanket of white, and the wind proceeded to remove
any warmth anywhere remaining after the descent of the snow. The
only heat was from the faithful engine and even internal warmth,
from solid or liquid refreshment, was impossible, as it was essential to
push on without a break for meals to get our so-called " delicate "

cargo to Derby and warm bird-rooms before dark. The dirty sky
promised a bad night for road travellers.
The weather cleared somewhat, and greater pace was made in an
endeavour to get through before darkness descended. Mr. Porter,
who was driving, succeeded, and shortly the lights of Derby were
in front. Soon, the strangers from afar were given an exceptionally
cordial welcome by Mr. and Mrs. Porter and family. The first care was
the delicate cargo. Unpacking proceeded rapidly and the whole of the
hall-w T ay, with its antique furniture, was soon covered with cages
of birds and bird gear. Attention was first given to several very sick
Tanagers that Mr. Porter had bought in London, in an endeavour to
save their lives, or, at any rate, give them a few days or weeks of
comfort before they passed on to happy feeding grounds.
The birds were put in warm quarters already prepared for them,
and certainly very few were showing any ill-effects of the arduous
trip north from London. In the morning, only two had succumbed.
In actual fact, the birds' attendants had suffered more than the birds,
for both Mr. Porter and myself nursed bad colds for several weeks while
the birds had fully recovered in twenty-four hours. In Mr. Porter's
bird-room the birds spent the winter and the spring of 1935, until
once again they set out on a long voyage, this time in May, 1935,
to New Zealand, leaving London on the coldest 16th May that England
had experienced for many years. Snow fell at Victoria Station that day !
The numerous official requirements for New Zealand were completed
during the afternoon and, after a farewell dinner wfith friends that
night, I went aboard the ship round about 10 o'clock, happy that
I was on my way back to good old New Zealand and sorrowful that I
was parting company with the wonderful friends that I had made
during my busy stay in the Old Country. Next day, going down the
Channel, we heard that enormous damage had been done all over
England by an unprecedented late fall of snow in what was really
mid-spring. The birds, however, were made snug in their quarters
'tween decks, canvased off from draughts, and heated and lighted
by numerous clusters of ship's lights. There they were well protected
from the boisterous w T eather during the run down to warmer climates--
and there in those quarters, let it be added, I worked with birds as

Breeding Successes in New Zealand
I had never yet and i trust never will again. Ten hours a day for a
few days on end doing nothing but feeding, watering, cleaning, and
spraying birds is quite a light task and a very welcome break in a life
given to totally different affairs, but when the days drag on over
thirty and the hours are just as long and the temperature gradually
rises and then suddenly falls towards the end of the voyage--that is
another story. The temperature ranged from 94* F. during the passage
in the Panama Canal to 45* F. on arrival in Wellington. Sufficient to
add that the bird attendant was regarded by those on the boat as
slightly mental ". The usual pleasures, companionships, and flirta-
tions of an ocean voyage did not appeal ; and, in any case, any in-
dividual who put in ten hours a day, most of it Tween decks and part
of it in the hospital aft looking after birds and fish, must be mental.
The attendant did survive the voyage, however, even at the loss of
approximately a stone in weight but, so far, has developed no more
serious symptoms of being unbalanced mentally. The difficulties and
dangers of the sea voyage being over on arrival at the inhospitable
port of windy Wellington, the trials and tribulations of entering this
autocratic country had to be faced and eventually overcome, thanks
to the assistance of my friends, the late Mr. A. E. Henley and Mr. J.
Black, of Dunedin. All difficulties, transport arrangements, etc., were
smoothly adjusted and the birds came to Auckland in a mail van
accompanied by the late Mr. Henley, who remained up the wdtole of
the night to see that nothing untoward happened to them on the
journey, particularly as, in addition to the steam heat, we used every
bit of gas in the cylinder on the mail-van by keeping the gas-ring burning
all the time to its fullest extent. Only approaching Auckland, at West-
field, did the gas give out.
On arrival at this city, the birds were accommodated at the aviary
of an aviculturist experienced in attending to their needs. After several
weeks, the distribution of the consignment was completed, many of
the birds being distributed to aviculturists who had requested the
individual species previous to my departure for England.
Two pairs of the last of the consignment of Yellow-wing Sugar
Birds were bought by the writer, kept indoors all the remainder of
the hostile winter of 1935, and one pair was released in each of two

aviaries on 6th October, 1935. In one enclosure were yellow Kowhai
blossoms. The birds immediately started sucking the nectar and
apparently eating a small amount of the pollen, while, in another
enclosure, the Sugar Birds taught a pair of Griraud's Orioles how to
obtain nectar and pollen from apple blossoms and, incidentally, to so
damage the flowers that there were not many apples that year.
The Sugar Birds were fed on the usual Sun-bird mixture, prepared
soft-bill food as used for Shamas, and a variety of soft fruit in season,
grapes, oranges, pears, and bananas being the principal fruits used,
with occasionally soaked seedless raisins and a piece of paw-paw T when
it was available. Sunlight, fresh air, plus food and exercise wmrked
wonders with the birds and, after approximately twelve months'
captivity in comparatively confined quarters in Panama, on board
ship, in Mr. Sydney Porter's bird-rooms, and again on board ship
coming out to New Zealand, the birds were in really good condition.
On Sunday, 17th November, 1935, the hen was observed playing
with a piece of string as though nesting-inclined. However, the cock
bird was not yet in full breeding condition with turquoise blue crest
and deep blue body colouring. On Thursday, 26th December, 1935,
the hen Sugar Bird was playing with soft white feathers, taking one
in her beak and flying about with it. On Saturday, 28th December,
she commenced picking up lengths of horsehair, and several were w oven
into a fork of the living tea-tree shrub growing alongside the path in
the aviary, the commencement of the nest being situated about 10 inches
beneath the top of this rather dense-growing shrub.
These few horsehairs were left in the fork for about a day, but on
Tuesday, 31st December, a nest about 2J inches in diameter was made
composed entirely of horsehair. The shape was much more spherical
than many other birds' nests and the edges were decidedly incurving.
The walls w r ere thin at the incurved tip, but gradually thickened to
the base, although the texture was so open that the contents were
always visible through the sides of the structure. The nest seemed to
be hung by horsehairs fastened on to one prong of the fork through
the nest and, though resting its weight on the wood, it was really
secured in position by these stays of horsehair tying the nest to other
portions of the shrub. The fork, therefore, was used as a support into
which to weave a nest, and not as a foundation on which to secure it.

Breeding Successes in New Zealand
On the evening of 31st December, the hen was seen sitting well down
in her little home. The weather was very windy and wet, but not cold.
As the wind and rain increased, the hen settled further down in her
nest and depressed her beak considerably. It was noticeable that, in
passing along the path past the nest, the hen took no notice providing
the passer-by looked straight ahead. Should the head be turned and
the eyes directed towards her, she flew of! immediately. On Saturday,
10th January, 1936, the hen being off the nest, a glance sideways revealed
two eggs, pale bluish-white, speckled with reddish-brown markings
which were more dense at the big end of the egg.
On Sunday, 11th January, one egg hatched in the morning and the
second in the afternoon, revealing two of the tiniest young birds I have
ever seen, covered with very little down and almost naked, with no
evidence of the long bill of the adult. Incubation, therefore, was approxi-
mately twelve days. On 19th January, the young birds would raise
their heads quickly if the hen were off the nest and the tree shaken a
little, the movement apparently being connected with the supposed
return of the hen. The flight feathers were growing strongly and
evenly, but not broken out of the quill covering as yet. A little bit of
fluff was noticeable on the chicks, but insufficient to provide much
w T armth.
The hen brooded them well, as she needed to, owing to the abnormal
amount of cold, wet weather. The hen was observed chasing flies and
moths in the aviary, but the cock bird was not seen performing any
domestic duties whatever. On 19th January the hen w r as seen eating
crumbs of Madeira cake from the soft-billed food supplied them, then
taking a drink of nectar and then pieces of boiled egg or cake in her
beak to feed to the young. In approaching the nest with food, the hen
always did so through the bottom branches of the tea-tree--never
from the top, which was composed only of slender, frail tea-tree shoots.
Not once was the hen seen to approach the nest directly.
Fruit in addition to the usual foods already mentioned was fed,
cut-up grapes, pears, oranges, and soaked seedless raisins. Gentles
were offered, but on no occasion were they seen to be used. Nectar
to moisten the other foods was consumed in considerable quantities.
On Thursday, 23rd January, the chicks 5 eyes opened and greenish
feathers showed on their backs. On Monday, 26th January, one young

one hopped out of the nest early in the morning, perching upon a tea-
tree twig about 4 inches from the nest. During the day, the second one
followed, taking the position of the first, which had moved about
2 inches higher up oil the shrub. They remained there the rest of the
day.
The breast feathers showed very pale green, but the tail feathers
were still in the pin feather stage, while the back was well covered.
On Thursday, 30th January, the young birds were seen moving about
the aviary somewhat freely. On this afternoon, when looking for the
youngsters, I saw one with its head through \ in. link netting,
apparently hurt. It could not have been there long, for a few moments
before I saw it climbing into the netting. I rushed in and released the
bird, as it could have done itself had it moved upwards at all or down-
wards, and placed it upon a branch. In a few moments it was calling
continuously to its parents, who flew excitedly round it. I retreated
from the aviary, but looked through a peep-hole, and saw the hen
feed it almost immediately. Later, it looked tired and droopy, but next
morning had almost recovered.
On Friday, the two youngsters spent the day in the Australian
bottle-brush shrub. The next day, Saturday, a cyclone commenced
to blow and on Sunday attained full cyclonic force. The memory of
that disastrous period and the damage done all over New Zealand
remains vividly with us even now. Salt spray blown many miles from
the ocean together with the speed of the wind burnt vegetation in all
exposed positions. These two young Sugar Birds had been away from
the nest only a few days before this disastrous cyclone went its mad
w r ay over New Zealand. One youngster at least was seen alive on the
Sunday afternoon. The little hen, faithful mother that she was, full
of courage and dominated by her instinct to feed her young, battled
with the wind and was seen several times to fly with her beak full of
food to the young, somewhere sheltering in the long grass of the aviary.
Of avicultural interest, too, was the fact that the steamer on which
Dr. Hopkinson, the Vice-President of the English Avicultural Society,
was travelling was hove-to 100 miles from port instead of being safely
at her moorings alongside the wharf.
After the cyclone, only one Sugar Bird was seen. On Sunday,
16th February, 1936, the Sugar Bird must have been almost independent,

for the hen commenced to think of building another nest. The young
was a cock, the colour lighter than a hen. The bill by now was half the
length of that of an adult, and the tail feathers almost full length.
On Sunday, 23rd February, the young occasionally called for the hen
to feed it, often without being satisfied. It quickly developed into a
handsome young cock, assumed full colour next spring, and is now a
happy inhabitant of a fellow aviculturist's aviary.

The following notes were sent to me by a naturalist friend in
Tasmania, the result of past discussions on the above-named Parrot.
Avian equilibrium is a factor that must not be unduly disturbed
and should be given very careful consideration.
Assimilative colouring as regards surroundings is also an important
item at all times. These conditions could be suitably applied to Blue-
wings.
Mating which commences about the end of October (Tas.) can be
delayed or quickened by correct feeding. (This is not given.)
Fresh eggs (thirty-two) of this species were sent by me to Professor
V. A. Khakhlofi of the Tomsk University about ten years ago ; not-
withstanding their being seven wreeks in transit, he secured a hatch of
twenty-one, and for several years now has had them breeding
throughout the year, even during the severe Siberian winter (this
suggests the birds are acclimatized, no mention is made of artificial
heat), also, he has fixed eight definite colours. He claims that feeding
is as important as mating.
The hatching in the first instance was per media of an incubator.
The professor has had up to four hatches per annum from some
pairs, and clutches of eight are common.
The writer goes on--I have examined many scores of nests of this
species over the past fifteen years and on tv T o occasions only have I
noted even eight eggs, the usual complement being six.

It is quite impossible to mistake Blue-wings for Orange Bellies
(N. chrysogaster) ; they are entirely different, the latter is visibly larger,
apart from the bright orange patch--almost scarlet in adult males,
and am quite satisfied that " Sports " of the Blue-wing species are
often mistaken by the " Layman " for the orange chaps, one of which
must have been the specimen held by " X ".
I saw this " Sport " during my last trip to Tasmania, the owner
claimed it to be the only N. chrysogaster in captivity. I doubted this
as being so, as I had seen them both in aviary and native habitat on
a previous occasion.

Last spring I was fortunate enough to purchase a pair of Gaboon
Weavers, I fancy they had at one time belonged to Major Appleby,
but am not sure, anyhow I was told that these birds had never been
bred in captivity, which was quite enough to fire me with the ambition
to see if I could persuade them to produce a family. Directly I had
them I turned them out into an outside aviary with a shelter ; in
which I placed a small box, and on the ground I threw some rough
grass. I fed the birds on millet, but added every day a small quantity
of the soft insectivorous food, and a good supply of gentles and a few
mealworms. To my joy the hen at once began to build, and'in due
course two eggs were laid. These were small and pure white. During
the day the cock bird sat, the hen going on to the nest after having
bathed in the evening. I can hardly describe my feelings, when on
going to feed them one morning after the birds had been sitting about
fourteen days, to find the hen dead on the floor of the flight, and one
egg with a chick in it just on the point of hatching !
I sent the hen away for a post-mortem, which revealed the fact that
she had a bump on the head, apparently caused by a blow. I can only
think that she had been frightened by an Owl, of which there are a
good many round here, and had struck her head against the wire
netting ! Down fell all my hopes of " a medal 5 ' and I began to wonder
why I keep birds !

The following letter referring to a hybrid Macaw reared in Essex
is worth printing as an interesting record. The writer is Mr. J. L.
Tuke, of 202 Hampton Road, Ilford :--
" The hen Macaw is coloured red and green, the male blue and
yellow. Each year they have mated and the hen has laid eggs, most of
which have been fertile, but failed to hatch. This year twelve eggs
were laid and most of them contained dead young, but out of the last
two laid one young bird has been hatched which is now well feathered
and apparently very strong, with a good appetite. It has already torn
a hole in the side of the shed with its beak and, unlike its parents,
squawks at night, or rather in the early morning, loud enough to
disturb neighbours three doors away. It has a blending of the colours
of both parents, having red feathered head and breast and blue-green
wings and tail.
" These birds are not caged, but kept in an ordinary garden shed,
free to roam in the garden and house. The flight feathers of the old
birds aie clipped on one wing every six weeks. As yet the young one
has not been able to walk out as its legs are not strong enough, but
it has quite a large wing span and flaps its wings a great deal. Both
parents feed the young one which is now eight weeks old."
Hybrid Macaws have previously been bred in France, Germany,
and New Zealand. Pure-bred blue and yellow as well as red and yellow
Macaws have been reared in France, Australia, and Germany.

There are now twenty-nine separate breeding aviaries for Parrakeets,
each designed to accommodate a single pair of birds and many of these
regularly produce families each season. The most successful result
was the rearing of no less than thirteen Queen Alexandra's Parrakeets
from two breeding pairs.
Success has also been achieved with Splendid Grass Parrakeets.
The last breeding hen unfortunately fractured her skull by some
unknown means, but not until she had reared nineteen young.
The Adelaide collection now contains forty-eight of the fifty-nine
species of the Parrot family known to exist in Australia.
Amongst foreign species the breeding of the Javan Parrakeet and
the Green Conure, the Torres Strait, and Bartlett's Bleeding-heart
Pigeons is recorded.

The January issue of the O.P.S. Journal is now published. We
consider it our best to date. Our President, M. Delacour, continues
his article on the distribution of Pheasants and three maps illustrate
this most interesting series. Monsieur Malisoux has surpassed himself
by a masterly exposition of reasons for that bugbear of all aviculturists
" Dead in the shell ". Such a scientific thesis on this matter has never
previously been written and not only does he give us his reasons for
these deaths but he also informs us that very frequently one can save
such a chick by artificial methods and he gives us minute details of
the procedure together with illustrations. The article is thoroughly
convincing and will create intense interest and wonder, not only amongst
phasianists, but all aviculturists. It is undoubtedly a discovery that
will have far-reaching effects. Many other articles are featured and
I would particularly mention Professor Ghigi's. All members of this
Society will know of this learned aviculturist and indeed only last

<bodyText confidence="0.979145333333333" page_id="56318730"  page_num="32" year="" vol="">
Madam,-- I was much interested in Mr. A. Hampe's account of " Singing
Birds in the Far East " in the November issue of the Magazine, especially
as I possess one of the most glorious songsters imaginable in a Spectacled
Laughing Thrush. This bird was brought over by Mr. A. Chaplin when he
was out on Lord Moyne's yacht in 1936, and I bought it from him a few
months after its arrival here. It is a bird full of character, but not always
good tempered. He loves men, and if a man comes into the room will im-
mediately show off, fluttering his wings and singing his loudest. At times
he can be very bad tempered with me, and I have to clean him with gloves
on or his sharp beak would soon draw blood. At other times he will be perfectly
docile, letting me take him in my hands and stroke him. He rarely sings when
I am in the room, but starts the moment I leave it. He seems to have many
different kinds of song. In the morning when first uncovered he sings rather
like a thrush. At sunset and sometimes in the evening he is much more like
a nightingale. He can imitate the crowing of a cock and a hen after laying an
egg as well as the mew of a cat.
He gets very excited at times, flying to and fro and throwing his tail
back over his back, I can never be quite sure whether this means rage or
pleasure--perhaps Mr. Hampe can tell me. In song he certainly surpasses
any Shama I have ever heard and is so lively and full of character. He loves
to play with a piece of paper, picking it up and letting it fall over and over
again. Altogether he is one of the most delightful and charming pets I have
\0x25A0ever possessed.

It is many years since Bluebirds were freely imported into Europe
and it is only owing to bis world-wide reputation as an exceptionally
distinguished ornithologist and keeper of rare birds that Monsieur
Delacour was allowed to bring two pairs of the Mountain Bluebird to
Europe. It is acknowledged to be the most beautiful member of its
exquisite family and is as familiar and charming in its own country
as our Redbreast is here. It lives almost entirely on insects, and takes
very little fruit and that mostly wild, so is entirely beneficial and
deservedly protected.
It is found in Western North America, and in Canada from the
west coast east to Manitoba, north to the Yukon and Mackenzie
Valley.
Its juvenile plumage resembles that of the other two species,
brownish-blue back flecked with white spots, throat spotted with
deep brown and white. Only the wings and tail show definite blue,
and this is much fighter than in the young of either the Eastern or
the Western species.

(Coriphilus peruvianus)
By The Marquess of Tavistock
The successful breeding of this rare, lovely, and most interesting
little bird is not only the greatest triumph of my avicultural career
(albeit the lion's share of the credit belongs to my former aviary
attendant, Mr. J. Yealland !) but is also, in many ways, the most
unexpected.
In the first place, I never expected to see Blue Lories alive at all,
as, when I was preparing supplementary work for the second edition
of my book on Parrots, I found that the skins of both species of
Coriphilus had been relegated to the department of the Natural
History Museum where extinct birds are kept, as the authorities at that
time believed that they had probably joined the ranks of the Dodo.
Even if the Coriphilus were still in existence, it seemed in the
highest degree improbable that they would ever be introduced to
aviculture, as their habitat lies far from the sphere of operations even
of our most enterprising collectors.
When, as related elsewhere, through the kindness of Mr. Guild,
the birds did unexpectedly make their appearance, further difficulties
arose with regard to correct feeding, and I was absolutely in despair
when, after many experiments, Mr. Yealland at last discovered the
food that really suits them--Dr. Allison's, prepared as for other
Lories, but then diluted with its own volume of water ; together with
apple, pear, grapes, and a few meal-worms. Of these latter, although
probably quite an unnatural diet, the Peruvianus have become ex-
ceedingly fond, although the Goupil's or Ultramarine Lories rather
unfortunately will not touch them.
Even when the problem of diet had been solved, the chances of
breeding appeared almost as remote as ever. Even the larger and
commoner Lories are not the easiest of their tribe to raise, and I had
a presentiment, fortunately unfulfilled, that, if they laid, the eggs
would certainly prove infertile, as has been the case with every species
of Hanging Parrot which has nested in my aviaries.
Furthermore, owing to the presumed delicacy of the birds, although

The Marquess of Tavistock--Breeding of the Tahiti Blue Lory 35
I have never bred healthy young from any kind of Parrakeet when
the nest was in a heated aviary shelter, I did not dare to put the
Lories' tree-trunk in the open flight.
Finally, December is not exactly the ideal month for the youngster
of a tropical species to leave the nest!
However, it is the unexpected that happens (usually, though
fortunately not always, in an unpleasant fashion !) in aviculture, as
well as in other ventures of life !
For the benefit of those who have not seen the species, a brief
description may be desirable. Coriphilus peruvianus is quite a little
bird, only about half as large again as a Sparrow, and the tail, as in
other Lories, is wedge-shaped and fairly short. The plumage of the
adults of both sexes, when they are in good condition and are able to
bathe in the rain, is a glorious dark blue with a high gloss on the
feathers. Under the throat is a very large snow-white bib and the feet
and beak are yellow, more orange in the cock than in the hen. Some
of the head feathers, which are often carried slightly raised, are, as in
some other small and rare Lories, unusually broad and shiny. The eyes
are dark and very small.
Being under the necessity of moving my aviaries from Peasmarsh
to Haywards Heath, summer was well advanced before the Lories'
quarters were ready for their occupation. As an experiment, I had a
special range of aviaries constructed for them, with tiled floors for both
shelter and flight. These have proved most satisfactory and are very
easy to clean. The measurements are: flight, 12 by 10 by 7 ft.
high; and shelter, 10 by 5 by 7 ft. high. The shelter is thermostati-
cally heated in winter, when a temperature of from 65 to 73* Fahrenheit
is maintained, and artificial lighting is provided when the days are
short and young birds are being reared. For the nest, I used a natural
tree-trunk about 6 feet high and entirely hollow. The interior was filled
with peat to within a foot or so of the entrance hole and on the top
of the peat were a few inches of decayed wood. The base of the tree-
trunk stood in a shallow vessel of water. Incidentally, it is very desirable
to have a deep layer of clean absorbent material in a Lory's nest, on
account of the liquid nature of the droppings.
During last winter I had to separate the hen Lory from her mate,

<bodyText confidence="0.999257305555556" page_id="56318740"  page_num="36" year="" vol="">
as he showed a disposition, apparently common in males of his species,
to attack his mate suddenly and viciously, even after appearing just
before on the most friendly terms with her. It may be that this trouble
only occurs when the hen is not in breeding condition and the cock is,
as latterly the relations of the couple have been much more harmonious.
Although the cock Lory was a nice specimen, the hen at first was not
a particularly good bird and would not bathe, and I regarded her as
a most unlikely proposition from the breeding point of view !
When the aviaries were at last ready, I put the couple of peruvianus
in adjoining partitions and kept them separated for several weeks,
until the hen seemed anxious to join her mate and he was feeding her
through the wire netting. When I put them together, as already
stated, they agreed quite well and often played together in the puppyish
fashion common to the Lory family.
The nest was put in in September, and towards the end of the
month I heard with surprise that the pair were taking a considerable
amount of interest in it. A little later, with even more surprise, I heard
that two eggs had been laid (the normal clutch for this species), but
the greatest thrill of all occurred between three and four weeks later,
when the news reached me that a young one had actually hatched,
the other egg having been slightly damaged and therefore having
produced nothing. I accepted it as a foregone conclusion that the
next bit of news would be the report of the young bird's untimely
death, but instead of that, to my never-ending amazement, it both
thrived and grew !
The habits of the old birds during incubation were interesting.
I expected, either that both would spend a great deal of time on the
nest or that the hen would do all the sitting, being fed by her mate.
Instead of that, they took turns at incubating, and when the baby was
quite small, it was the mother who appeared to do most of the foraging
for food, while the father stayed at home and looked after the
nestling.
Unlike most members of the slow-growing genus, the little Lory
matured rapidly, and was out of the nest about eight weeks after the
first egg had been laid. When he was about three weeks' old, with
some trepidation, I decided to have a look at him. His parents,

fortunately, were quite unmoved by our investigations, and continued
eating meal-worms without any display of anxiety or resentment.
(Incidentally, they were allowed four meal-worms each a day and would
have eaten more, although we did not consider it prudent to indulge
them.) When the top of the nest had been removed and the electric
torch directed into its dark interior, I saw, instead of the half-expected
corpse, a sturdy little blackamoor sitting up in one corner ; for the
baby Lory, instead of being clothed in white or yellowish down, like
all other little Parrakeets I have seen who have possessed any clothes
at all, was almost as black as a baby Moorhen !
The happy day at length arrived when, on looking into the aviary
shelter, a dark form flew from one side of the aviary to the other,
which was not that of either of the parents. The young bird was as
fine, strong, and well-grown as anything in the Parrakeet line that
I have ever reared, even under the most favourable conditions. His
plumage was blue-black, somewhat less brilliant than that of the
parents. He had some streaks and blotches of greyish-white on that
area of his person where his bib should later appear, and his beak and
feet are at present blackish.
At the time of writing, he is feeding himself, and his future presents&apos;
somewhat of a problem, as I rather think the parents have laid again,
and I do not quite know whether to risk moving him or not. Knowing
his father's uncertain temper, I am a little afraid of leaving him too
long, although I must admit that so far, the cock is behaving like a
model parent. We have not had a chance of looking inside the nest
to make sure whether a second clutch of eggs has appeared, but, if
they have, the arrangements for their incubation have been rather
peculiar, as sometimes both old birds are on the nest; sometimes the
hen ; sometimes the cock ; and sometimes the baby himself, although
for quite a long time after first emerging he did not enter the tree-
trunk at all!
I have already referred to the feeding which has suited my Blue
Lories so well. In addition to the articles of diet already mentioned,
they occasionally chew up grass and eat a little earth from the space
left open in the tiles for the maintenance of a supply of these delicacies.
When the weather is very severe, the Blue Lories do not often

venture into the open flight, although they will sometimes come out
and have a vigorous rain bath, when the temperature is decidedly low.
Although they are active climbers, Blue Lories have a strangely
weak and laboured flight, exactly like that of a very sick or young bird.
It is clear that in their own restricted habitat they never have to do
much more than move from one branch to another, and gales of wind,
I imagine, must be practically non-existent in Tahiti. At the present
time, both species of these lovely little Lories are confined to certain
tiny and remote coral islets, a plague of rats having exterminated
them in other parts of their limited range. It is, therefore, greatly
to be hoped that every effort will be made to preserve them in captivity
in the not improbable event of their dying out completely in their
native land. Eggs have, I believe, been laid recently in America and
also in the collection of Dr. Derscheid, in Belgium, where I hope
Mr. Yealland will be able to continue the success with the species which
he has begun so well in England.

By Maurice Amsler, M.B., F.Z.S.
This is the season when I usually oblige our Editor with some
copy and depress my fellow members with a recital of many failures
and a few successes. The past year has been quite an average one as
regards numbers fully reared, but very much the reverse if one were
to work out the percentage of birds reared from those hatched.
Last year, my first experience in the breeding of Pheasants, I
reported two Amherst fully reared as the grand total from some eight
or ten chicks hatched--this failure, it may be remembered, was due to
the misbehaviour of one of my dogs--which had to go ; my present
dogs are now perfectly trained, in fact they only reluctantly follow
me when I am walking round feeding the young Pheasants.
Notwithstanding this I have had more than my share of losses
among these birds--about twenty Amhersts were reared, the total
should have been quite double this number ; of Elliot's I only brought

one through, out of eight lusty youngsters, and exactly the same may
be said of Peacock Pheasants or Chinquis. I have little doubt that
rats and stoats accounted for most of my losses--the broods just became
gradually smaller. Elliot's naturally suffered the most because not only
are they somewhat wild with their keeper, but they are also inveterate
wanderers ; some of my young birds, long before they were entirely
weaned from their foster-mother, used to wander right away into
adjacent fields, which were not my property.
As against this feature, young Peacock Pheasants are seldom seen
more than three or four yards distant from their home coop--but
I think this species is delicate in the early stages, at any rate this
was my own experience ; also they are dreadfully pugnacious. None
the less they are quite my favourites.
Although in this species the hen only lays two eggs to the clutch
the process is repeated, provided the eggs are taken away, and my
little hen produced ten eggs altogether. Reeve's are easy and the
chicks are wonderfully tame and intelligent from the very first.
Edward's arrived too late for me to expect any eggs.
I have learned a good deal about the rearing of game birds during
the past two years--all by dint of asking questions, and most of what
I know has been accumulated by pestering a near neighbour, Mr. Philip
Guest, of the Moor Game Farm, who rears some 3,000 Pheasants yearly
among which may be numbered a goodly proportion of the so-called
fancy or ornamental Pheasants.
When the breeding season approaches the cocks of some species
even if provided with three or more hens are inclined to be spiteful to
the point of murder, and the usual advice given is to provide plenty of
brushwood and such-like as " hides " for the hens--in practice these
refuges may be the hen's undoing as she may find herself in a cul-de-sac
where the male has her at his mercy.
My own plan has been to cut the flight feathers of one wing in the
male or to " tie " the wing. The hens soon learn that they are safe
if they get on a high perch and do so the moment the male begins
to be troublesome.
The males again are the worst culprits as regards egg-eating. As
the hens usually lay from 5 o'clock onwards in the evening it is easy,

if one has a shelter to the aviary, to drive the cock in each morning
and not to liberate him until the eggs have been collected last thing
in the evening.
There are different opinions as to the storage of eggs until one
has enough for a sitting--many people stand the eggs point down in
bran, but as the result of a good deal of inquiry from experienced
breeders I pack my eggs in wood-wool in tin boxes and each day the
box is turned over completely--all the eggs thus get a turn each day.
All eggs are examined about the eighth day of incubation,
and infertile ones removed.
The broodies, by the way, should be carefully chosen ; any with
scaly legs should be discarded, and all, whether one's own or borrowed,
should be smothered with pyrethrum powder or Keating's, both while
on the dummy eggs and also a day or two before hatching. This
application should be more especially applied along the back, rump,
and just under the wings. When the eggs begin to chip the hen is
left on the nest and gets neither food nor water even if the process
takes a day or a day and a half.
After this length of time it may be assumed that any unhatched
eggs only contain dead chicks--the youngsters are then collected by
hand, placed in a warm box, indoors if the weather is cold, and the
foster-mother taken out and given a good feed and drink, after which
she is replaced in her box and her family is returned to her until they
are all quite dry.
The next step is the removal to a coop. All beginners, like myself,
wish to feed the chicks quite early, but it is a well-known fact that
they are best without either food or water for twenty-four to thirty-
six hours, there being sufficient food and moisture in their yolk-sacs.
It is well known that young Pheasants do not at first recognize
or respond to the call of the foster-mother and that they will wander
away and be lost if given full liberty like so many chickens when first
cooped. It is usual to. have a " run-out " fitted to the coop for the
first few days. A much better plan is to drive half a dozen stakes into
the ground, forming a 9 ft. circle around the coop : to these is tied
a length of J in. mesh wire netting about 2 feet high. The chicks are
thus able to run round the coop and get their sense of orientation in

every direction before receiving their full liberty, whereas with the
usual run-out they have no idea what the world is like at the back of
the coop and may quite easily lose themselves if they have a sudden
fright when first liberated. The chicks are of course shut in with the
hen each evening and let out as early as possible in the morning when
they get their first feed--then is also the time to count them in order
to check any possible losses.
It would be imagined that the broods are quite safe when shut in
at night, but this summer I lost two Elliot's out of four during the
night, the culprit being a weasel which had found its way into the coop
through a mole run which happened to run that way.
A dead Sparrow, well plastered with poison, was pushed down the
run and as it had disappeared on the following day I can only presume
that that weasel had gone where all bad weasels should go.
Sparrow Hawks, of course, are a danger and also the Kestrel, which
so many people tell us feeds entirely on mice, moles, and beetles.
A Pheasant breeder of very great experience tells me that a Sparrow
Hawk will come regularly morning and evening, taking a poult each
time until the whole brood is exterminated, but that a Kestrel will
return every forty to sixty minutes providing the chicks are small
enough to be carried away, and I can personally vouch for the statement
that this pretty little Hawk does take Pheasants quite readily.
Not everyone knows that any Hawk can be kept away quite easily
providing the breeding ground is not too large. The procedure is much
like that employed to keep Sparrows off lawn seed, but in this case
one uses black thread instead of cotton, and this is stretched across
the ground at intervals well above one's head ; if any Hawk touches
one of these threads he will never return.
I am at the moment wiring in about an acre of grassland which
will be cat, stoat, and rat proof, and I hope by means of these threads
to make it also safe from anything which the heavens may send us, for
I have no doubt that Owls, Kooks, and Crows would be equally well
discouraged. I trust that the above notes will only be taken as advice
to other beginners like myself, and I have little doubt that they will
cause a supercilious smile in some of the many experienced breeders
who are members of our Society. My excuse must be that I so well

remember how completely at sea I felt on many minor details when
I first began trying to breed Pheasants just eighteen months ago.
Turning to Passerine birds I at once feel much more at home, having
kept these constantly for upwards of thirty years.
I wonder how many present members of the Society can remember
the Australian collectors Payne and Wallace, who used to import
thousands of Gouldian, Long-tailed, Parson, and other Grass Finches
as well as a goodly number of the rarer Painted Finch; I well remember
my visit to Bath where these collections were housed in 1907.
The birds were kept in long and roomy box store cages : --the perches
ran from one end to the other of the cages and each succeeding perch
was a little higher and farther back than its neighbour.
Each of these boxes contained literally hundreds of birds and I
can remember my wonder at not seeing a single bird with its eyes
closed--or its head under a wing.
First, the birds were cleaned out several times a day--the grit,
which was ground quartz, was in feeders ; the seed, mainly canary
also in tins, was fixed to the front of the cage and any husks and spilt
seeds went through the cage floor which was composed of wire netting
for about 3 inches back from the bottom rail--it will be readily under-
stood that the birds could thus not possibly eat waste or fouled seed
and the collectors attributed their success to this arrangement.
Certain it is that these birds lived when taken away and that they
did not require all the various chemicals and patent foods which are
now given them.
To return to 1937 and my own birds :--\0x25A0
Siberian Bullfinches reared two young wdiich is rather unusual,
but our member, Mrs. Charles Seymour, had the good fortune to double
that number though it must be admitted that her hen had been in
England for two years and was therefore quite settled down and at
home.
Blue Grosbeaks (I think Cyanocompsa cyanea) for the second
year made no attempt to nest. These are very lovely birds but rather
wild. The cock has quite a nice, if somewhat monotonous, song.
Cuban Finches only reared two young, whereupon the hen died.
These little birds always interest visitors and appear to be ready breeders

but they most certainly will not tolerate any form of inquisitiveness in
their domestic affairs.
White-fronted or Jobi Island Doves were as prolific as usual
and at the moment, well past the middle of November, at least three
hens are incubating.
Peaceful Doves should, in my opinion, all be sent to an asylum
for birds--they refuse to make use of quite nice platforms and nests
provided by me and appear to prefer a convex surface for their ridiculous
nests. Their last act of insanity was to fill a large bowl containing their
drinking water with building materials. This happened each day for
about a week until finally I put the bowl on the ground, when they
mercifully went elsewhere. Only one was reared.
Diamond Doves have excelled themselves. Last year I had three
pairs in one large aviary and although there was little if any fighting
very few were reared. This season I put each pair in a separate aviary
except that in one case I had two hens with one cock--both these hens
had nests of fertile eggs. The total number reared was about sixteen
and the last squab left the nest to-day (28th November) after three
or four very hard frosts ; there are still two nests of eggs.
Green Avadavats were surprisingly satisfactory. I had two very
antique males, real patriarchs, for whom I bought two hens on the
occasion of the Society's garden party in July ; by the end of August
one pair had brought off four young and the other pair fully reared
five which flew in mid-September. They have all withstood the recent
frosts but have now been caught up and caged.
My chief disappointment this year has been my failure with the
Greater Niltava (Niltava grandis), of which I have a beautiful pair.
These birds made a half-hearted attempt to nest in 1936 when in
Mrs. Wharton-Tigar's aviaries, with me they did not do much better.
The partly built nest was placed in the fork of a weigelia and was
composed of a few laurel leaves and coarse grasses. I should have
expected the male of this Robin-like bird to feed the hen but I never
saw any such sign of devotion. Both birds have a marked dislike for
the open flight and spend most of their time in the shelter. They are
adept at catching insects in the air and are quite one of my star-turns
with meal-worms when I have visitors.

nothing this year though my old pair attempted to breed and actually
built and laid in their wunter quarters, eggs clear. The young of
1936, a cock and two hens, only began to build some three weeks ago,
whereupon I caught up and removed the male.
Ruficaudas rather annoyed me. One youngster was reared in
May--whereupon the hen died, and all the " hens 5 5 I have since bought
have been cocks, including one from a well-known member !
Another " pair " made up of a 1936 cock bred here and a bought
" hen " are also two cocks.
My old Orange-headed Ground Thrushes laid and reared
twice, though only one youngster was reared on each occasion, first
a hen and then a cock.
They again chose their food pan as their nesting site. My failure
to rear two full broods was due indirectly to the drought and the
difficulty of finding small worms, which are a perfect and sufficient
diet for the purpose. Iwas therefore obliged to use large " lob-worms "
chopped up and I am quite certain that these are tough and indigestible.
Two pairs of Shamas were very disappointing: my best pair carried
a few straws into a box but no egg was produced, the other pair laid
early in May. As these birds are difficult to breed but are at the same
time prolific egg-layers, I put the first clutch of them under a wild
Robin. I did not visit the nest until I judged the young would be about
a fortnight old, only to find three well-feathered chicks outside the
nest with their heads bitten off. A keeper tells me this was the work
of a Jay. For some reason no more eggs were laid.
Two Jackson's Coral-billed Thrushes both carried a few straws
but did not build properly. I suspect both of being hens.
My Western Blue Robins never attempted to nest, although the
cock was constantly entering one of the nest-boxes and calling to his
mate.
Of the Eastern variety I have two pairs and here comes my final
jeremiad.
Twenty-five young were hatched and only two reared and these
both cocks.

These catastrophes all occurred with young under Red-breasts,
and in no case were the deaths of the young due to neglect by their
foster-parents, of this I am absolutely convinced.
I have before now stressed the high mortality among wild birds,
and these losses of valuable young were every time due to some
" accident " to one of the parents, almost always the hen Red-breast,
I do not feel justified in encroaching too much on the Editor's space,
but should like to relate just one experience proving my theory that
it is the death of a parent which causes these disappointments. I have
a friendly cock Robin near my aviaries : we are on speaking terms and
he sits on my arm and takes food from my hand.
Last spring he began to require not one, but several meal-worms,
with which he always flew away. By repeating my bounty I was able
to trace him to his hen sitting on five eggs in a cupressus hedge. The
nest was beautifully concealed and I could never have found it without
my little guide.
In less than no time I had substituted five Bluebirds' eggs which
hatched in about a week. I did not approach the nest for another
fortnight, but knew all was well as all my meal-worms were carried
to the nest.
At fourteen days there were five splendid Bluebirds and I could
already distinguish the sexes, four cocks and one hen. I unfortunately
decided to wait another two days--would that I had been less patient.
On visiting the nest again I found four young, cold and stiff on the
ground, and the fifth equally dead on the edge of the nest--five beauti-
ful young birds worth their weight in gold, and not the slightest sign
of any injury ! I made sure that the hen had come to an untimely end
and that the young had thrown themselves out of the nest because
they were cold and wanted their mother. These experiences always
depress me for many days, but as I was walking away who should
turn up but my little cock Robin asking for food. A few meal-worms
were quickly picked up and carried into the cupressus where I thought
I could hear the little squeak which the hen gives when being fed
by her mate. This of course completely mystified me and I began to
suspect the Robins of cold-blooded desertion. It was only by repeating
my largess of meal-worms that I was able to follow up the Robins'

movements, until finally, to my amazement, I saw that he was feeding
two or three recently flown young Missel Thrushes--such is the urge
to feed that he had taken on these monsters ! My other disappointments
were all very similar, except that on one occasion I found six young
apparently dead when only two days old ; these were put in a cool
oven. Two revived and one of them was hand-reared by my servants
to the age of twelve days, when he gave up the ghost--he was a poor
specimen anyhow. The cause of his death was " enteritis ".
Who of us does not make resolutions for next year--mine are a
fixed programme of death and destruction to rats, stoats, weasels,
and forgive me, my dear Editor, all species of Owls, but more especially
the " little 'un "

Our good Secretary has asked me to say a few words about our
birds and aviaries at " Ma Demeure ", Claremont, South Africa, for
the Magazine. This I do with the greatest of pleasure and hope it will
be of interest to fellow members. I say " ours ", because aviculture
is not a " one-man hobby " in our home. My wife and son are just as
interested as I am. My wife knows as much, in fact more than I do,
about our little feathered friends. Trained and woman-like, she does
all the doctoring and nursing and cares for these little things, with
an instinct and gentleness which makes me feel quite envious--but
helpless. I do the donkey work--play the stupid part.
Aviculture is one of my later hobbies. My chief hobby is viticulture.
Growing grapes for experience and show. We never really decided to
take up aviculture. It just seemed to grow on us in a simple kind of
way.
It was my little son's birthday, and we were at a loss to know what
to give him. Being naturalistically inclined, we decided on three pairs
of small wild birds, and an aviary. One pair Orange-breasted Waxbills,
one pair Blue-breasted, and one pair Ruddy Waxbills was the start.

To these we kept adding and soon the small aviary became too small,
so we had to build a bigger one.
Then the " bird-fever " gripped the family. And as the fever grew
higher, so our collection grew larger and aviaries increased in number.
To-day we have some 700 to 800 birds. Included in the collection

latter are dear little chaps and perfect little Cardinals in miniature.
Dark grey back and wings, black tail, and black crest beautifully
curved forward, white throat and face with black stripe above eye.
Under parts light grey. Length about 4J inches.
The aviaries are not large and out of reach, but necessarily of a
controllable size, averaging approximately 24 by 8 by 6 ft., with
closed houses and open flights.
Though living in sunny South Africa, we have our advantages
and disadvantages the same as everybody else. Residing in a spot on
the Cape Peninsula, where we have four to five months almost con-
tinuous rain, with snow on the surrounding mountains, frost on the
ground, and varying bitterly cold winds in winter, one has to provide
warmth and dryness for the tropical and sub-tropical species.
Hence, aviary construction has to be carefully thought out. Then,
what with mice, snakes, prowling cats, mosquitoes, the Argentine ant,
and the fierce heat of summer to contend with, to say nothing about
bird ailments, it keeps one quite busy thinking out how to control
all these gentlemen, and keep the birds comfortable and happy. The

aviaries are built of wood, felt, and concrete. The concrete foundations
are 18 inches deep right around below ground and the houses and
flights are firmly fixed to them, so as to withstand the terrific storms
of winter. These deep foundations also serve to stop mice and snakes
from burrowing their way through to contaminate seed and poach eggs.
The houses are constructed of wood, covered with felt. A J in.
square mesh wire, 18 inches high, is fastened between wood and felt,
right around all houses, starting from foundation up. This prevents
mice from gnawing their way through the wood. All windows fitted
are of the dual type. The inner ones are covered with mosquito gauze
and the outer ones are made of glass.
Two rows of controllable ventilation holes are provided near the
roofs and also covered with mosquito gauze. Thus the houses are
absolutely vermin proof, except for the Argentine ant, and draught-
proof, at the same time affording plenty of ventilation.
A false roof is fitted over the roofs of the houses, thus causing a
continuous current of air to flow between them. Throughout the year
all birds are put to bed every night and safely locked up in their houses.
In winter, with the glass windows closed, we are able to heat up
the house. Then, with the advantage of controllable ventilators, we
are able to maintain a steady temperature, at the same time eliminating
the damp air of our wet winter so injurious to Violet Ears, Diamond
Sparrows, and other such delicate species, which cannot stand dampness.
On summer evenings, with the glass windows wide open and the
gauze ones closed, the birds are safely protected against cunning cats
and nagging mosquitoes, at the same time admitting an abundance
of fresh air.
The false roof serves to modify the intense heat of summer days,
as well as nights (summer nights are sometimes quite hot) and keeps
the houses beautifully cool.
I think the Argentine ant is easily our most troublesome pest and
the most difficult to control. We have tried every known brand of
poison without success. They are spread throughout the Peninsula,
but I think they prefer Claremont to any other suburb.
Most troublesome in summer they (the Japanese army) are always
travelling for the soft food mixtures, termites, fruit, and young birds.

50 C. N. Abrahams--Experiences and Incidents in South Africa
Many a valuable nest of young we have lost, due to these little gentlemen.
They will kill and almost completely devour a nest of four young in
one night. Before dusk my wife and I would search an aviary carefully,
looking for the last scout and destroy every trace of them. Then we
would put out tempting poisonous food in the hope that it would be
nice enough and sufficient to keep them busy for the night.
But, alas ! we'd awaken next morning only to find that there had
been sufficient for all and some to spare. And the Japanese army had
pushed on and were busily marching to and fro, in a thick black stream
towards a nest. On examination one would find they had reached---
Japanese heaven, I sometimes think--and the nest is a thick black
mass of ants and the young birds all dead.
They are tiny black gentlemen, so small that they can creep through
mosquito netting, and that's why we call them Japanese. We have
gone to considerable trouble in trying to cope with this pest.
This breeding season we have introduced a new system of nesting
area. In some houses we have planted large branches of trees, to which
suitable nesting bushes, boxes, baskets, and coco-nut husks and tins
are fastened. In others we have suspended a nesting surface, also
consisting of bushes, boxes, tins, etc., from the roofs of the houses,
by wires, the idea being to bring the points of control down to a minimum.
These points are covered with some sticky substance, i.e. tanglefoot,
over which the ants will not pass, only here again we have to protect
the birds from being caught on it. And so the game goes. So much for
the Japs. I think we'll beat them before the end.
But there is the other side of the story. And all the trials, and all
the troubles, cannot offset the great pleasure we find in our birds, with
their interesting ways and habits and breeding results. Although the
latter has been nothing really wonderful, so far as rare species goes,
we have had a great deal of pleasure out of it. And after all, what
more interesting and pretty can one wish to see than five common young
Zebra Finches, with the backs of their little heads firm on the ground,
forming a semi-circle, with mouths wide open, earnestly begging for
food ; while Ma and Pa hop from one to the other, placing a blob
in each little mouth, to a deafening chorus of keen little voices and
quivering tails.

Towards the end of last year we were successful in breeding a cross
between a Pin-tailed Nonpareil and Indian Spice Bird. This bird
I sent to my friend, Mr. B. Cleugh, in Johannesburg, where it caused
much comment. I believe it was exhibited in Johannesburg and Durban
with distinction and acclaimed the only such bird bred in this country.
In shape it is exactly like a Pin-tailed Nonpareil, including the pin-
tail, but it has the sombre brown colours of the Spice Bird, except for
a pink rump and no scales on the breast. I have not tried to claim
the Society's medal, as I understand it only applies to members in
England. Other breeding successes include African Fire Finches,
Tangarine Waxbills, Zebra Finches, Tricolour Parrot Finches, African
and Indian Silverbills, White Zebra Finches, ordinary, Long-tailed
Grass Finches, Cuban Finches, Bufus-backed Weavers, Indian Spice
Birds, Strawberry Finches, Bengalese Finches (three colours), Blue-
breasted Waxbills, and Bedfaced Waxbills.
Melbas have nested and brought young up to the feathered stage.
Then, suddenly, they mysteriously disappeared. Others that have,
behaved in like manner are : Peter's Spotted Waxbills, Blue-breastedl
Waxbills, and Cordon Bleus.
At time of writing three young Tri-coloured Parrot Finches, young
Long-tailed Grass Finches, and three young Cuban Finches have taken
to the perches.
All seed is supplied by means of automatic feeders of the double-
sided hopper type. These are refilled once weekly.
Water is laid on and supplied by means of a spray, shooting the
water into the air, which falls back into a rock fountain.
It is a great treat to see the birds, in their many gorgeous colours,
bathing under the spray in the sun of a hot summer's day.
Unusual Incidents .--In a place called Bobertson, a friend has a
Galah Parrot at large. He has the whole of Bobertson to himself.
His home is a huge oak tree in the back yard. Here he sleeps at night
and spends most of the day. Everybody in Bobertson knows him.
Periodically he disappears for a week or so and returns when his
holiday is o'er, perhaps staying at home six months before going for
another. He has no wife or other (feathered) friends, but apparently
no enemies. He has lived in Bobertson some years.

52 G. N. Abrahams--Experiences and Incidents in South Africa
One day, travelling down Queen Victoria Street, Cape Town,
I noticed something unusual about the behaviour of a bird. I stopped
my car and watched.
It was a Mossie (Cape Sparrow, Passer melanura), fighting with his
own reflection in the glittering hub-cap on the spare wheel of a motor
car. For six minutes I watched this pugnacious little chap battling
away. Diving at his own reflection, dashing himself against the cap
with amazing force, and slipping off on to the ground. But he would
be up and at it again, until at last he could go no more and fell to the
ground utterly exhausted, where he lay, until I disturbed him.
In Cape Town Docks, in breeding season, Starlings (Sturnus vulgaris ),
are very daring. The wharves and quays are kept clean and nesting
material and trees are very scarce. But evidently as with man, so
with the birds. " Needs must when the D'vil drives."
I watched a tramp steamer dock one day and be fastened to the
quay. Immediately two Starlings settled in the rigging.
The ship's hatches were opened up and the first cargo to be lifted
out was a crate packed with straw. In a flash the eager Starlings
alighted on the fo'c'sle deck and each ascended with a straw in the
mouth. There were no trees, so they took to a revolving crane. For
a few minutes I watched these daring birds, in their earnest endeavour
to complete their home--lest to-morrow the ship may be gone. The
nest was built between the steel girders and corrugated iron of the
roof. At times the birds would rest on near-by angle irons, apparently
nonplussed, with straw in the mouth, when the crane had turned the
opposite way round. But a moment's pause and they never missed
the mark. Many nests of young have been found on these ever-revolving
cranes. But the drivers are all very kind.
In a clump of trees, in a place called Rondebosch, the Egrets have
roosted for many years. On my way to business every morning, at
this time of the year, I always look forward to seeing them there.
They roost in the topmost branches of these tall pine trees. And in
the early morning, as the sun is warming them up, they spread their
wings, and it is always a beautiful sight to see these big trees, with a
perfect cap of pure white instead of dark green.
This year they have decided to breed there, and I have never seen

though very strange, for the first time to hear the low mimicking noise,
when passing through, under the trees, late at night. So prolifically
are they breeding that many fully fledged young have been found next
morning, lying dead on the ground beneath the tall trees, having
fallen from their high nests.
One actually insisted on answering roll-call one morning, in the
fifth standard classroom, of the near-by Boys Hill School. This was my
little son's experience.

For the second time this Show was held in the Dorland Hall,
Piccadilly, owing to the destruction by fire of the old Crystal Palace,
more than a year ago. Unfortunately, Dorland Hall is by no means
ideal for the purpose, although this year's Show was a great improve-
ment on last year's. Even so, the Foreign Birds and Pheasants were
housed in a comparatively cramped corner, causing at times great
congestion and intense heat; also, the birds were not too well
distributed, classes in some cases were partly on one side of the Hall
and the remainder some distance away, making it difficult to examine
and compare the birds. However, apart from these disadvantages,
it was a most enjoyable function ; the quality of the exhibits was
very good indeed. Many rare and beautiful birds and Pheasants
were shown, and staged in grand condition.
Owing to his unavoidable absence, Mr. F. E. Fooks took Mr. J.
Delacour's place in judging Pheasants and soft-billed foreign birds.
Mr. Fooks began with the Pheasants, and in Class 327 gave

2nd with a lovely Golden, which won him Mr. Spedan Lewis' beautiful
cup for the best Golden at the Show. Mr. Lambert also was 3rd in
this class, and again 1st and 2nd in Class 328 with an Edwards and
Swinhoe's Pheasant. And in Class 329 with 17 exhibits Mr. Lambert
came 1st and won two specials, with a lovely Peacock Pheasant from
Burma. Mrs. Barrington was 2nd with a fine Impeyan or Monal,
and Lord Tredegar 3rd with another beauty of the same species.
When one realizes the difficulty of transporting these birds, the display
made by this collection of over fifty specimens was very wonderful.
Now we come to the classes for Parrot-like birds, judged by Dr.
Derscheid, Belgium. Class 330 for Lovebirds, etc., 1st was awarded to
Mr. W. Kibble's lovely Bed-faced Lovebirds, and 2nd to the same
species shown by Mrs. Willsher ; 3rd to Mrs. Varney's fine pair of
Peach-faced. Class 331 only two exhibits : 1st went to an outstanding
Bed-rumped Parrakeet shown by Mrs. Cotton, and 2nd to Mr. Handley,
with a pair of the same species. In Class 332 for Cockatiels, 1st went
to a very dainty pair shown by Mrs. Hamilton, who also won 3rd ;
2nd Mr. W. A. Tee. In Class 333 Lord Tredegar came first with an
exceedingly fine Bauer's Parrakeet, a tame and amusing bird ; 2nd
to Miss N. Blay with a Bosella ; 3rd to Mr. Norman Allison with
a lovely Crimson-wing. Class 334 also a very small one, all three
exhibits were shown by Mr. Handley, who got 1st, 2nd, and 3rd with
a Many-coloured, Turquoisines and Bourkes. The next class, 335, was
small, but the three exhibits were wonderful. Mr. Ezra 1st with a
superb pair of Queen Alexandra's Parrakeets, most perfectly staged ;
2nd Mr. Maxwell with a very fine pair of Derbyans, and Miss Henderson
with a pair of Queen of Bavaria Conures. When I first saw this very
rare exhibit I thought there must be some mistake, surely nothing
could beat it; however, on looking at the winners, one realized that
they won on condition and the way they were put down. In Class 336
Mrs. Proudfoot won with a lovely little Meyers Parrot. Lord Tredegar
showed a very attractive Yellow-fronted Amazon, and Mr. Batt a
very fine African Grey. In Class 337 Mr. Maxwell was 1st with a
grand pair of Banksian Cockatoos ; Mr. Batt's rare Citron-crested was
2nd, and his Salmon-crested Moluccan Cockatoo came 3rd ; a very
fine fellow, and tame too. In Class 338 Miss Henderson showed the

rare and very charming Short-tailed Parrot, and Mr. Warburton a
very fine Hawk-headed Parrot.
Mr. Ashby's classes for Seed-eaters began with Class 339 for all
species of Doves and Pigeons, and Mr. Ezra was 1st with a very fine
pair of Papuan Golden-heart Pigeons. Miss Eileen Fowler was 2nd
and 3rd with Zebra Doves and Peaceful Doves. In Class 340 Mr. Cecil
Bernstein was 1st with a grand pair of Roul-Roul Partridges ; the
hen distinguished herself by laying an egg during the Show, and both
looked very much at home--a very attractive exhibit; 2nd Mrs.
Barrett's Californian Quail.
Now follow what are known as the common little foreign birds.
Class 341 for Zebra Finches had 15 exhibits. Mr. F. Johnston was
1st with a fine pair closely followed by Mrs. Hildrick-Smith, who got
2nd, and Mr. Crozier, who got 3rd, and Mrs. Anderson-Morshead showed
a pair of the more uncommon white variety, and they looked most
attractive wfith their bright orange beaks. In Class 342 Mr. Shivers
was 1st with Green Singing Finches ; Mrs. Varney 2nd with a neat
little pair of Silverbills, and Mr. Green 3rd with a pair of the large
St. Helena Waxbills. In Class 343, Mr. Click won with a perfect
pair of Cordon Bleus, Mrs. Gowland 2nd with a pair of Blue-breasted
and Mr. Marker 3rd with a lovely pair of Lavenders. In Class 344

finches ; 3rd Mr. Gates' Diamond Sparrows. In Class 346 for Gouldians,
the Rev. J. R. Lowe won with an outstanding pair of Redheads ;
2nd Mr. Gates, also with a pair of Redheads ; and 3rd Mrs. M. C.
Frayne's grand pair of home-bred Blackheads. In Class 347, Mrs.

the rarer Cardinals and Grosbeaks, etc., the 1st was won by the Hon.
Mrs. Jervis with a splendid pair of the rare Mexican Yellow Grosbeak ;
2nd to Mrs. Gowland with a lovely pair of Black-cheeked Cardinals
3rd to Mrs. Proudfoot with a pair of Japanese Hawfinches. In this
class also was shown a pair of the rare Phoenix Cardinal, from Venezuela ;
and a very handsome Chinese Hawfinch. Class 352 had only three
exhibits ; 1st was won by Mr. Huyton with a pair of Crimson-crown
and Weavers ; 2nd Mr. Haynes with a Rufous-necked Weaver, and
3rd Mr. Best with another Crimson-crowned Weaver.

Mr. Fooks, judging the foreign soft-bills, awarded 1st in Class 353
to Mr. Trendett for a very fine pair of Scarlet Tanagers ; 2nd to Mr.
Maxwell with a wonderful striated Tanager, and 3rd to the same ex-
hibitor's Superb Tanager. In Class 354, 1st went to Mr. Ezra's perfectly
glorious pair of Paradise Tanagers ; 2nd to Mr. Norris with again a
marvellous pair of the Orange-breasted Tanager ; and 3rd to Mr. Max-
well with the pair of little Hooded Tanagers, a very meritorious exhibit.
I happen to know these difficult little birds were brought over from
east Brazil in November, 1933, and Mr. Maxwell has had them ever
since. Now we come to an outstanding quartet in Class 355, each
bird was a gem of the first water : 1st was awarded to a Garnet-throated
Humming Bird, in finest condition, shown by Mr. Ezra, who is super-
lative in the art of keeping Hummers in cages ; 2nd to Mr. Maxwell
with his marvellous Superb Sunbird. Superb indeed, and in captivity
for four years ; 3rd and 4th also to Mr. Maxwell with the well-known
and much shown Senegal Sunbird, moulted out by him into wonderful
colour once again, and singing too ; last but only least because the
others were so wonderful, came the Buff-throated Sunbird, a tiny gem

Mr. Seth-Smith very kindly walked round, looking at the exhibits
with me, giving me the benefit of his great knowledge and experience.
We also went and had a look at some of the British birds, and they
w r ere a very fine lot. We particularly noticed a fine Eedwing, both
Grey and Yellow Wagtails, some very fine Choughs, a Stonechat,
a Whinchat, and a Common Wren, looking very fit. A fine pair of
Eedstarts, a Treecreeper, in grand condition, also a Nuthatch ; some
wonderful Waxwings. Both Greater and Lesser Spotted Woodpeckers,
a Blackcap, and a Nightingale. Two very fine Albino Song Thrushes,
a Lutino Corn Bunting, a White Starling, a Lutino Yellow Bunting,
and a Lutino Greenfinch.
I hear that the Show cannot be held again in Dorland Hall ; let
us hope the management will find another hall with all its advantages
but with more space given to Foreign Birds, Pheasants, and Parrot-
like birds, and also some seating accommodation.

ANOTHER ATTEMPT AT BREEDING
AGAPORNIS PULLARIA
By Helmut Hampe
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998226857142857" page_id="56318762"  page_num="58" year="" vol="">
In the Avicultural Magazine of last year (p. 148) I described my
unsuccessful attempt at breeding A. pullaria . The female of this pair
unfortunately died of heart complaint, and I had to give her husband,
who knew all about the nesting hole, a new mate. Luckily they took
to each other at once, and when they were allowed into the flight on
the 24th March, 1937, by noon on the same day the male was examining
the hole made by his late wife, and at five minutes past one I saw the

female vanish into the hole. It was interesting to note that as her
desire to breed increased the female started persecuting the pair of
Plum-headed Parakeets inhabiting the same aviary. The Plum-heads
had just reared a brood, and while so doing had persecuted a pair of
Orange-cheeks, though out of the breeding season they got on quite
well, and paid each other little or no attention.
By June the female was often quite a long time in the hole, and
as in the previous year the male sat swaying near it, but only entered
occasionally and for a short time. The female did not do much to the
hole, generally she only smoothed the passage entrance. Like the
former female, she only carried in very small pieces of bitten willow
leaves in her feathers, the quantity which I found later in the hole
was very small indeed, even when she had begun to sit she often carried
in more leaves, but the male never did &quot;this. I saw them pair for the
first time on the 6th July, afterwards repeated many times. As a rule
it lasted four to five minutes.
From the 29th July onwards the female slept in the hole, and on
the 1st August, or possibly late on the 31st July, she laid her first egg.
Four more were laid on the 2nd, 4th, 6th, and 8th respectively. They
measured 23*5 X 16'5, 22'5 X 16, 20 X 16*5, and 19 X 17*5 mm.
The first egg was unnaturally pointed.
Incubation began with the first egg, but only the female sat. Her
mate fed her once daily in the hole, but always spent the night in
the shelter. When the female left the nest to relieve herself, he stood
by the hole enticing her back to it, and always accompanied her
when she flew back again.
Unfortunately the eggs did not hatch; some contained dead
chicks, and the rest were infertile, so I took them away on the 1st
September, and replaced the old male by a younger one, with whom
the female luckily soon became friendly, sitting side by side and billing
each other on the 9th September. After this the female occasionally
revisited the hole, but without result.
I intend to put them back in the old aviary after they have passed
the winter in an unheated bird room, and have obtained a second
pair which will be placed in another aviary and provided with a large
heap of chalk, and I hope that in 1938 I shall at last succeed in breeding
this species.

FURTHER EXTRACTS FROM THE ANNUAL

A FEW INTERESTING TIPS IN FEEDING BIRDS

By Dr. Ranston and the Hon. Secretary
The feeding of " blighties " or Zosterops. --In England they treat
them as Sunbirds, giving them quantities of Snnbird nectar, of course
liquid. Better results will be obtained by feeding them a soft-billed
mixture such as is used for Pekin Nightingales, together with apple
and other fruit such as pears, and, to a minor extent, bananas. On
this diet, they will retain perfect plumage and live in an aviary for
many years. Several birds have been kept on this diet by Dr. Ranston
for five years.
Bengalese. --These little birds appreciate a diet containing plenty
of paddy rice and, on this seed, develop and grow considerably larger
than the usual small imported bird.
Pekin Nightingales and Zoster ops are partial to the skin of hulled
oats when other seed-eating birds have already eaten the kernel.
Honey-eating birds. --A tip picked up in Australia. The usual
nectar given is fed as a solution of far too great strength. As an
alternative diet, offer a teaspoonful of good honey to half a teacupful
of warm water with, added to it, as much genuine raw sugar as will
cover a sixpenny piece. The usual No. 3 brown sugar is not satis-
factory, being refined to a certain extent. It is necessary to obtain
the genuine raw sugar as it comes into the refinery. This sugar is now
sold by many shops. It adds to the weak solution of honey and water
food substances missing in the honey. The mixture as fed to the
birds should taste only slightly sweet to humans.

It was a beautifully woven nest, but with no lining. Eggs were laid
on 16th, 17th, and 18th November--three eggs. The hen started to
sit on the 17th, and the first baby hatched on 1st December. By
2nd December there were two babies. The third egg, bluish green
very mottled with brown spots, disappeared. The hen appeared to do
all the feeding and I never saw the father take anything to the nest.
The food consisted of seeded grass, of which there was plenty growing
in the aviary, growing canary seed, soaked seeds, soaked millet sprays,
eggs and Madeira cake, Shama food, and gentles. There were meal-
worms, but the birds did not touch them, although the mother seemed
to be always looking round the trees for insects. The weather was
really wintry and I had to protect the nest from rain by putting a
large piece of glass on the roof.
The birds continued to grow and the mother ceased to sit on them
at night on the twelfth night. The first baby left the nest on
17th December, not too well-feathered, and the other left the nest on
19th December. The weather was so very cold that one night I was
very worried about them, so after dark I brought them inside, putting
them back in the morning at 4 a.m. They continued to grow and were
fully independent of their parents on 5th January. I took them away
and put them in another aviary. I shall have to wait until they colour
up before I can tell what sex they are.

During the year 1937, the O.P.S. made steady progress, and if
one source of advancement was more noticeable than any other, then
it was the fact that our Society is now making a world-wide appeal.
Of members who joined the O.P.S. during 1937, no less than 35 per
cent live in countries other than Great Britain. We consider this
feature most satisfactory, we always intended that our activities
should be of world-wide significance, and our appeal for support has
been broadcast to all countries. At our annual general meeting, which
will take place before these notes appear, our members will consider

this matter from every angle. We anticipate having at least 100
members in France and Belgium before many months have passed, and
we must now consider the best method of keeping in close touch with
these welcome members, as well as with those in other countries.
There is a difficulty which will at once be obvious, we have not a
common language. Mr. F. Fooks has kindly consented to act as
Secretary for the French-speaking members, and by some method yet
to be discussed and determined, he will communicate our activities
and suggestions to the members concerned. The interest that is taken
by our members abroad is amazing, it far exceeds that demonstrated
by our British members, and the lethargy of the latter is at times most
exasperating. I suppose, however, we should not complain, for our
steadily growing membership is most encouraging. At the forth-
coming meeting a new committee will be appointed, and although it
is to be hoped that some of the old leaven will be re-elected, we also
hope that some of the new members will prove most energetic. We
admit that we desire closer co-operation between the North and South
of England, and ideas will be thought out which we hope will ensure
this desideratum. We also hope that at least three of our French-
speaking members will be elected on our Committee. Fortunately
our President, M. Delacour, is able to keep us in touch with matters
on the Continent, but it is conceivable that if some of our ordinary
members are elected to serve on the committee, even greater interest
will be the result.

Madam, --I am pleased to see the article " The Tyranny of the Trade
I call it " The Tyranny of the Fancy Press ". I have found that the editor
of Cage Birds will not publish any letters or articles in his paper that might
upset traders who advertise, or journalists, and his pet experts.
Some time ago I sent a letter to Cage Birds asking a trader in nest boxes,
who had been writing on Mendel's Theory, to explain why Cinnamon Wings
did not breed according to his theory. The editor would not publish my
letter.
I may say I have always found the editor of Bird Fancy willing to give
fair play to all.

Madam, --Like many aviculturists who keep such birds as Nonpareil
Buntings I have found that in spite of keeping them in good outdoor aviaries
they have lost the beautiful red colouring of the breast after the first moult.
The somewhat dingy yellow tone which replaces the brilliant red or rather
scarlet is always a great disappointment, and detracts considerably from the
beauty of the birds.
This year I determined to try an experiment after having first of all
discussed the problem with a friend with a wide knowledge of vitamins.
His advice was to provide Vitamin A. I immediately procured some and
adopted the following procedure. I mixed two or three drops in about a
tablespoonful of cod-liver oil and thoroughly mixed the oil in the seed mixture
which is the only food supplied to the birds.
I gave this mixture of oiled seed for about a month before moulting and
a month after, with the gratifying result of restoring the red colour to the
Nonpareils.
I think this procedure might well be adopted with other species which
lose colour in captivity. I should be interested to know if any member of the
Society has tried treating birds in ill health with homoeopathic medicines,
particularly in cases where the digestion is out of order or where there is
definite inflammation.

Madam, --Since my letter a pair of Mrs. Wilson's Tanager (Tanagra
lavata centralis berlepsch) have brought a fully-fledged young one to the
feed dish, he is now feeding himself. I did not know they were nesting and
they appear to be nesting again. Also about a week ago I found a Maroon
Tanager's nest (Ramphoccelus carbo) with young in it, I should judge they
are about two weeks old. So please add their names to the list of birds that
have nested and reared young here, which was published last month. I am
especially pleased about the Mrs. Wilson's Tanagers, they are such beautiful
birds. I have ordered several dozen more of each species for liberation.
This is the beginning of the breeding season here and great activities are
going on. I look forward to great success as the liberated birds seem to be
well acclimatized.

<bodyText confidence="0.992884" page_id="56318768"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
The Sky's their Highway. By Kenneth Williamson. Published
by Putnam and Co., Ltd., 42 Great Bussell Street, W.C. 1. 10s. 6 d.
net.
Only a genuine lover of creatures wild and domesticated could
have written this book. Mr. Williamson is young, and his field for
observation is restricted, but he has made the very most of his oppor-
tunities, and enters into the lives around him by means of sympathetic
observation without interference even when a Hawk chases a House
Martin, or Starlings drive Spotted Woodpeckers from the holes they
have laboriously chiselled, a height of detachment to which few
naturalists could attain. He is a north country man, and draws most
of his inspiration for his books in rambles about the dales and woods,
noting down all his observations in his diary, so that his descriptions
and notes are all first hand, with perhaps the exception of the wanderings
of the ill-fated Snowy Owl, though this is but too probable. The
author does not deal with any but well-known birds, but our interest
is captured and maintained even when he talks to us of Tawny Owls,
Ox-eye Tits, Kestrels, and Chaffinches. His method does not entail
capturing or harrying the little lives around him ; it is the result of
patient quiet watching and non-interference ; only once is he the god
from the machine when he picks up an injured Owlet and nurses it
back to health. Otherwise he is contented to listen and observe,
allowing his subjects to live their lives as seems good to them.
It must not be supposed, however, that he has merely written
a series of disjointed notes ; the chapters on Swallows show systematic
and definite study, as does also the chapter on bird songs. Mr. William-
son is to be congratulated on having produced an interesting and
eminently readable book. The woodcuts with which it is illustrated
add greatly to the beauty of the book.

THE ORANGE-WATTLED BIRD OF
PARADISE
(Macgregoria / pulchra)
By James Fisher
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.994319" page_id="56318781"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
This interesting bird was first described by C. W. de Yis in the
Ibis of 1897, pp. 250-2, from a specimen collected by Sir William
Macgregor in May, 1896, during his journey across New Guinea from
Mambare to the Vanapa River. Sir William was then Governor of
British New Guinea. His collector, Mr. A. Guilianetti, found that
the bird was " pretty common all over the Scratchley Range " up to
about 12,600 feet.
Although " pretty common ", according to de Vis, the Orange-
wattled Bird of Paradise has never, as far as I can find, had a further
mention in the literature.
When Mr. F. Shaw Mayer brought one of these birds to the
Zoological Gardens on April 29th, 1937, it was the first time that one
had been seen alive outside South-West New Guinea. He brought, too,
a story which may explain why the bird is so rare in collections.
Apparently, most of the natives of the Scratchley Range cannot be
prevailed upon to hunt it since they believe that the mere sight of it
brings bad luck. Mr. Shaw Mayer had the greatest difficulty in finding

KING FERDINAND'S COLLECTION

<bodyText confidence="0.991860384615385" page_id="56318782"  page_num="66" year="" vol="">
The magnificent collection of birds at Coburg, brought together
by the care and thought of His Majesty the ex-King Ferdinand of
Bulgaria, is one that would provide weeks of enjoyment and study,
but even a brief visit of a few days makes a memorable impression.
The birds have in most cases been procured by the King personally
on his many travels : wherever His Majesty goes one of the thoughts
uppermost in his mind is the study of birds. Though his 'collection
numbers over 800 specimens, he can remember where each one was
obtained or purchased, and he knows the names of all, not only in
Latin, but in almost every European language. His knowledge of their
distribution and habits makes a tour of the aviaries in his company
little short of an extensive education.
The main collection is contained in a large house consisting of eighteen
aviaries. The whole building is light and airy and each aviary has an
indoor and outdoor compartment, the outdoor section being provided
with trees and shrubs. Inside there is a central passage, the aviaries,
constructed of fine meshed wire and light wood, being ranged on each
side and forming a semi-circle at the end. At the other end a door
leads to a large room where the food is prepared, and the collection
is in charge of two very knowledgeable keepers.
Every aviary is numbered and on the outside is a typed list giving
the species of birds contained therein and a note of their habitat.
It is perhaps simplest to give a brief resume of the birds in each aviary.
In the first there were mostly European birds such as Waxwings,
Hawfinches, and a Water-rail, but, in addition, in a large cage was an
Argentine Motmot.

In the second was a large collection of Waxbills including the
rare Esirilda atricajpilla and E. nonnula from West and Central Africa,
Melba, and Wiener's Waxbills, Violet-eared and Australian Waxbills,
Rufous-tailed and Heck's Long-tailed Grassfinches, Chestnut-backed
Mannakins, Alario and Cuban Finches, Queen Whydahs and Orange
Weavers. There was also a Plumbeous Redstart, Red-crowned Hanging
Parrots, and Cape Doves. Though the aviary is so thickly populated,
Cuban Finches, Cut-throats, Silverbills, and Common Firefinches
have all reared young successfully.
Aviary number three contained a similar collection of Finches,
among which Cuban and Red-headed Finches have bred, Waxbills
and Munias. In addition, there was a Ruby-throated Warbler, some
Three-coloured Parrot Finches, and Chinese Painted Quail.
In aviary number four there was a fine collection of Weavers,
many of them busily constructing their nests of blades of coarse green
grass, large stacks of which were placed in the corners of the aviary for
their use. Some nests were completed and some were nearing comple-
tion when I saw them. The bird takes about two or three hours to build
a nest and then most frequently pulls it all to pieces again. Here
were Grenadier, Orange, Crimson-crowned, and Red-beaked Weavers,
and in addition Golden-breasted Buntings and a White-capped Redstart.
There were more Weavers in aviary number five, also Longtailed
Whydahs, Redfaced Lovebirds, and Scarlet Tanagers, and, in addition,
Black-necked Mouse Birds ( Colius striatus nigricollis ) which have
successfully reared young, a notable achievement though C. striatus
appears to have been bred on two occasions in the British Isles. The
Mouse-birds are intensely interesting and queer looking birds--they
appeared in fine condition and were flying about and hanging on
the side of the aviary, altogether seventeen of them. Red-headed
Finches have also bred in this aviary and a Chinese Painted Quail
had a family of chicks behind the stack of grass provided for the
Weavers.
Aviary number six contained a magnificent collection of Whydahs
and Weavers, the brilliant plumage of the cocks making a striking
blaze of colour. There were Paradise, Red-shouldered, Red-collared,
Yellow-backed, and White-winged Whydahs, several species of Weavers,

Scarlet Tanagers, Blue-cheeked Barbets, Pekin Robins, and Red-
crested Cardinals. In aviary number seven was an equally splendid
display of colours from such lovely birds as Long-tailed and Pintailed
Whydahs, Military Starlings, Rufous-necked, and other Weavers,
Scarlet Tanagers, Dominican Cardinals, and a pair of the very beautiful

Many species of Weavers were in aviary number eight with some
Royal Starlings and Ring-necked Parrakeets. Amazon and G-rey
Parrots, Donaldson's Touracou and White-breasted Grey Touracou,
and some Bay Cowbirds were together in aviary nine.
The African Grey Parrots had an aviary to themselves and were
in excellent condition. They were provided with hollow tree trunks
with entrance holes at intervals and the sight of one of these birds
looking out of the tree trunk was most attractive. They thrive very
well in the aviary but though one or two of them were pleased to be
petted, they are losing their tameness and ability to speak.
In the next aviary was a most engaging Green Barbet ( Thereiceryx
viridis). A very confiding bird which always came to the wire when
called and was extremely tame. Also in this aviary were Red-
headed Cardinal, Mexican Hangnest, Superb Spreo, Royal
Starling, Oxbird, Longtailed Whydah, Diuca Finch, and Spotted-
backed Weaver.
In aviary number thirteen was an interesting collection consisting of
Dominican Cardinal, Magpie Tanager, Superb Spreo, Royal Starling,
Yellow-breasted Barbet, Senegal Parrot, Common Quail, Calandra
Lark, and Kaffir Weaver.
Among a number of various species of Weavers in the next aviary,
Masked Lovebirds had bred and reared their young and there was also
a specimen of the Libyan Thrush.
The Bearded Tit of the race occurring in Russia ( Parnurus biarmicus
russicus) and a Cockatiel were with a collection of various European
Finches, a Mexican Rose Finch, and also a Masked Weaver. In the
next aviary was the beautiful Violet-necked Lory, Mitchell's Lorikeet,
a Dominican Cardinal, and various Weavers.
Cut-throat, Red-headed, and Zebra Finches had all bred success-
fully and were placed with a Red-crested Cardinal, Red-crested Finch,

Scaly-crowned Weaver, Magpie Mannakin, Painted Quail, Short-tailed
Munia, Bearded Tits (Russian), and the attractive Black-headed
Oriole.
In aviary number eighteen were Black-headed Weaver, Yellow-
headed Marsh Bird, Swainson's Lorikeet, and various coloured
Budgerigars.
Fischer's Lovebirds breed in large numbers at Coburg and there
were about a hundred of them in the last aviary ; as always, these
birds are most destructive and immediately strip any greenery they
are provided with of its leaves.
In the garden are very large aviaries containing a Buzzard, a
Goshawk, and an Eagle Owl; the latter fell out of the nest when
young and was brought to King Ferdinand. A very tame South African
Ground Hornbill named " Franz " enjoys life in a large aviary where
he can fly with great ease, and in a similar one is a very good specimen
of the Crowned Hawk Eagle, named " Fritz ", which has been in His
Majesty's possession for eight years.
In' the Villa itself, King Ferdinand has rooms entirely devoted
to birds, in one of which there are four specimens of the White-headed
Woodpecker ( Leuconerpes Candidas), and two of that rare Toucan
--Ramphastos vitellinus. In another room there is an Ariel Toucan
and two Purple-capped Lories, and further four specimens of Sandevall's
Grenadier Weaver bird.
The gardens and grounds are kept as a sanctuary for wild birds
and every effort is made to render it attractive for them. No old
tree is allowed to be cut down or dead branch taken off, in order that
the tree nesting birds may find sufficient nesting sites ; and nesting-
boxes and food are also provided. The Wryneck and five species of
Woodpecker, the Green, Grey-headed Green, Great Spotted, Middle
Spotted, and Lesser Spotted, all inhabit the grounds. Thistles are
cultivated and King Ferdinand has an excellent crop of these plants
usually discouraged by gardeners, and he is rewarded by the sight and
song of multitudes of Goldfinches which fly in and out among the
leaves and eat the seeds quite undismayed by the close proximity of
humans. I visited Coburg at the end of July when there was not
much to be heard of bird song, but during the spring the grounds must

be a veritable paradise for those who enjoy watching and listening to
wild birds.
King Ferdinand is a great scientist and a great lover of nature.
He spends hours sitting in his bird house watching his birds---studying
their habits, their notes, and their movements. He is equally engrossed
in studying wild birds, butterflies, and flowers, and his garden is a
memory of journeys all over the world, planted with wild flowers
he has brought back from all the ends of the earth. His love of nature
is so great that it is infectious and to talk with him is an inspiration to
any naturalist.

(Pytella melha)
One of the most welcome and charming Christmas presents I received
this year was from the birds in the form of three of the dearest little
Red-faced Waxbill babies you have ever seen.
I think the Red-faced Waxbill babes are easily the most interesting
and fascinating little things we have had the pleasure to breed. Shy,
though tame and fearless, they are just like miniature bantams about
the aviary. They can't fly a foot high off the ground, and are led
about the aviary by their mother. They give one the impression
of a unique miniature bantam family, as the whole ensembly marches
past, in " Indian file ", with their little necks outstretched and stumpy
tails erect. Ma walks in front, leading her children, and Pa struts
behind in majestic fashion, forming what would appear to be a body-
guard. Mother protects her children in a most determined manner.
She does not actually fly at you, but she stands in front of her babies
in a threatening attitude, screeching vigorously as you approach, and
defies you to touch them.
Their home is in a two pound jam tin, fastened against the wall
inside of the bird house, about six feet from the ground. Out of this
they come to earth, somehow, every morning. But, unable to fly, as
yet, they cannot get back again, so every evening my wife catches
them up and places them back into the nest.

Just like little children, so good and sweet, they seem to know it
is bed time, and all huddle themselves together for my wife to catch
them.
The nest was built of green grass and capok, and four bluish-white
eggs were laid. This was their third attempt. First they persisted in
building between the top of a glass window, which is let down every
evening, and the wire of the flight. With this continuous disturbance
each evening, they soon grew 44 fed-up " and engaged a jam tin inside
the bird house. There they built a cosy cup-shaped nest with a scanty
dome to it, and sat for a few days. But for some unknown reason
they suddenly gave notice, and eventually built a hurried, rough and
ready cup-shaped nest, without a dome, in a jam tin farther along.
This sudden change of address still remains a mystery, for both tins
were exactly the same.
However, here they got down to serious business, and both cock
and hen took turns at sitting very closely, and were not easily dis-
turbed. Incubation lasted approximately three weeks (I did not keep
dates) and four young were hatched.
One was found dead on the floor one morning, apparently having
been thrown out by the parents. The remaining three are all bonny
little fellows. In colour they are exactly the same as their mother,
with the same scaly effect on the breast, bronze-coloured wings, and
maroon tail. The usual staple seeds, canary, millet, manner, a little
teasel, niger, and rape were available, plus various green seeding grasses,
soft food, and live food. Immediately after hatching, the parents most
noticeably demanded live food. They met one at the door and hung
around until the termites and mealworms were placed on the feeding
table. Then they would gorge themselves on them, and immediately
fly to the nest and feed the young. My wife sometimes used to tease
them by walking right around the aviary with the dish of termites,
and it was most amusing to see how deliberately they chased after her.
My wife loves caring for these little things, and I don't think I will
be wrong in saying that, of the number of species we have been fortunate
enough to breed, none have given her greater pleasure than Red-faced
Waxbills.

When George R. Marriner set out to visit the Kea country it was
to satisfy his deepest longing to see for himself one of the most interest-
ing creatures in a land where the interesting abounds. Marriner went
alone as at the last moment his chosen companion failed him. Omitting
description of his journey, and its astonishing natural features, we stand
with him, by the aid of imagination, at the top of the mountain-pass,
gazing across a succession of endless snow-clad peaks. A dray track
winds easily down for a mile or so to the river bed. Here, in ancient
days " the giant moas must have settled in search of food
Three mighty rivers unite their forces and charge down the gorge
to the plains with a terrific thunder. All the surrounding peaks con-
tribute to their reinforcement. To quote Mr. Marriner, " rush from the
terminal faces of the glaciers ; tumble from the snow-line ; ripple
and bubble through the cushion-like vegetation of the higher slopes.
Down amid the dense bush they tumble forming numerous cascades
and waterfalls."
The Rakaia River cuts its way for 14 miles over shingle-bed, about
a mile wide, then it rushes for another eight through a narrow defile
amid some of the grandest gorge scenery of the Dominion. Ranges
capped with snow stand away to the left and, girdled with glaciers,
stride across the valley. The great shingle slips, which it is claimed are
unequalled for size and abundance in any other part of the world, are
met and kept in place to a certain extent by the living indomitable
tussock.
Scattered here and there over this vast wilderness are a few lonely
homesteads, with shearing-sheds and shepherds' huts the only dwellings,
and often separated from each other by miles of mountain range and
stony river-bed. Terrific storms rage here, and blinding drifts of snow
make riding horse-back but a stumble, until it becomes altogether
impossible. The mighty frosts clutch everything, as in a grip of iron.
It is a land of awful distances where a false step may mean death,
sometimes slow and lingering. This band of Alpine country forms the
backbone of the South Island of New Zealand, stretching for about

480 miles from one end of the island to the other. Still quoting Mr.
Marriner, we may add, "It is composed of long parallel ranges of
mountains, many thousands of feet in height, crossed all along their
length by shorter transverse ranges, which taper out to the plains.
In between these ranges the rivers run, fed all the year round by the
Alpine snows and cutting out deep gorges between the mountains
which form picturesque defiles opening to the plains." Southward,
ever southward, the mountain ranges become higher, until the chain
is crowned by Mount Cook, or, to give it its Maori name, Aorangi,
" the heaven-piercer."
" This long stretch of Alpine Country is the home of the Kea . . .
here, in a region of mountain, forest and flood, the bird has flourished
for centuries, until man came, unbidden."
But, and this it is well to remember, the Kea, although often circling
the snow-clad peaks, more often swoops down to where forest and
river-bed meet to revel among the foliage.
Description of the Kea
The Kea is the New Zealand Parrot (Nestor notabilis ) and is about
the size of one of our Pigeons. Mr. Malcolm Boss writes of it as a
mountain Parrot of beautiful plumage, but Mr. Marriner writes, " there
is nothing very graceful about the Kea, neither in appearance nor
movement," and he lays great stress on the " waddle " and " general
clumsiness " of the bird. He admits that the plumage varies in intensity
of colouring according to the age of the bird and the season of the year.
Olive-green, black-edged, brick-red, and metallic-blue tints are
to be seen in the plumage.
The upper mandible, or beak, is long and much curved, towards
the tip taking on a brownish-black colour, but yellow-tinted at the
crown. The lower mandible is nearly straight and much shorter than
the upper. It is of a lighter colour than the upper beak and lightest
in the young bird.
There would not appear to be any blue-eyed Keas. The colour of
the eyes is a dark brown, approaching black, as the bird ages. Each
eye is encircled with a yellow ring, and the same vivid colour appears
around the nostrils.

J. Cassidy--A Chat about the Kea
The female Kea is less beautifully attired than the male, her plumage
being duller. She is not so robustly built as her lord and her beak is
not so stout and powerful.
Professor Haslam, of Christchurch, tells that he once saw in an
Otago Homestead a stuffed Kea that was almost an albino. Some
kindly person procured a specimen for Sir W. Buffer, the famous
ornithologist whose book on birds is stiff a standard work. The specimen
was procured from the interior of Otago and was 4 4 bright canary
yellow with a few red feathers interspersed throughout the plumage ;
vivid red on the rump and upper tail coverts as well as under the
wings. Such a gorgeous bird has never been seen in the district before ".
Food of the Kea
The natural food of the Kea is that of the berries of various Alpine
shrubs and trees, roots of herbaceous plants, grubs, such as are found
in dead trees, honey from the flax-seed. (Cherry trees, when the fruit
is ripe, should it be so fortunate as to find them ; lettuce and dandelions,
and Maori onions are much liked by some of the tame Keas kept by
bird-fanciers.)
Nesting
The Kea might have possessed an almost prophetic foresight that
in the years to come would show it surrounded by countless enemies,
so inaccessible, almost impregnable, are the places selected for its
nesting. Surely no fortress was ever chosen by man stranger and safer
from molestation than the Kea nesting-grounds ! Precipitous, un-
approachable, and defying intrusion by human hands are their breeding-
places.
Mr. Marriner, aptly quoting Mr. T. IP. Potts, sets down this descrip-
tion : 44 It, the Kea, breeds in the deep crevices and fissures which
cleave and seam the sheer faces of almost inaccessible cliffs that in
places bound, as with massive ramparts, the higher mountain spurs.
Sometimes, but rarely, the agile musterer, clambering amongst these
rocky fastnesses, has found the entrance to the run used by the breeding
pair and has peered with curious glances, tracing the wmrn track tiff
its course has been lost in the dimness of the obscure recesses beyond
the climber's reach. In these retreats the home, or nesting-place,

<bodyText confidence="0.990724514285714" page_id="56318791"  page_num="75" year="" vol="">
generally remains inviolate, as its natural defences of intervening rocks
defy the efforts of human hands unless aided by the use of heavy iron
implements that no mountaineer would be likely to employ."
However, it is not always that the Kea chooses such breeding-
places, although no doubt they are favourites. If these rock-tunnels
are not available a cairn of stones, or even a hole in a clay bank, may
be selected. In a fine photograph secured by Mr. Marriner after over-
coming many acute difficulties, he shows the natural entrance to a Kea's
run, and the hole goes 10 feet into the rock. The Kea's breeding season
commences about June and runs on to September. It is a curious
fact connected with the Kea that the bird constructs its nest, lays its
eggs, hatches and rears its young, all during the severest months of
the New Zealand winter. Cold winds and snow and frosts, which turn
everything into a solid frozen mass, do not deter them. It has been
suggested that this nesting in mid-winter may be that it enables the
young to be fully developed before the severe weather again comes
round.
The Eggs
The Kea egg is about the size of that of a domestic Pigeon ; it is
white in appearance with rough shell and no markings. There are
usually four eggs. The young birds stay in the nest for a long time,
three, four, or even more months. As fledgelings they smell particularly
unpleasant and are the most helpless of creatures, even when the
size of young adult Pigeons. There is indeed very little in the young
Kea that portends its future liveliness and brightness, its intelligence
and mischief.
The Kea at Play
Character often comes out in play. When the young birds are at last
able to move about with agility they are extremely amusing. No one
who has Keas about them can suffer from dullness. Here is a description
from a party which had pitched its tent in a Kea district: ' while you are
driving one bird away from the tent another will be trying his beak
on the coat that you have hung up on a tree for safety. With their
merry eyes and their shining coats, their perky ways and their tameness
and extreme inquisitiveness, they are welcome and unwelcome at the

J. Cassidy--A Chat about the Kea
same time.". . . They will often pay a visit of inspection to the
tent and keep one on the qui vive as to what new mischief they will do.
Perhaps you hear them rattling the cooking utensils about. That is
the merest trifle ; but when they begin to tear the tent, there is nothing
to do but to get up and strike camp as soon as possible.
In a book, Climbing in the New Zealand Alps, by Mr. Fitzgerald,
the author says, " The Kea Parrots disturbed our sleep that night by
walking up the iron roof, and (to judge from the sounds), tobogganing
down and falling off the edge, with shrieks of terror and rage."
No end of amusing stories are told by travellers in the Kea country
of the instinctive love of mischief in the Kea. There is frequently a
good deal of method in the ways of the bird. One traveller tells how
he was resting on a hill when a Kea alighted on his shoulder. He says :
" I caught him and put him in a box an inch thick, but he cut it through
by the morning and got out. I then chained him with a dog's chain,
with a leather strap round his leg. The Kea would run the iron chain
through his beak until he got to the leather and then with a stroke or
two of his beak he cut it right through." They have marked intelligence
and see through snares and traps of all kinds, and evince clever and
original methods of rendering them useless, seeming, as they fly away,
to screech with wild derision at the would-be trapper.
The Change-over from the Harmless Playful Bird to a
Bird of Prey
" Before the advent of the white man there were no four-footed
animals in New Zealand, except perhaps, a native rat," says Malcolm
Ross ; " my own idea is that it was its inordinate inquisitiveness that
led to the change (in Kea food and habits) which was brought about
in an accidental manner : When the early settlers in the mountains
killed a sheep they spread the skin, woolly-side down, on the stockyard
fence. The ever curious Kea swooped down upon it, and began to tear
it to pieces with his strong sharp beak "... then came " the cold
winter, when all the berries were done " and the snow lay thick, and
no grubs were available. Hard up for dinner the Kea flew down into
the valley and finding no sheep-skins about he went back to the
mountain-side and settled upon a live sheep ;--there he got his dinner !

Soon the other Keas who had been unable to dine discovered the
replete bird and made eager inquiries, and " for many days afterwards
they all dined well ".
The sheep, which had never before found the Keas unfriendly,
were taken by complete surprise. The owners of the sheep saw, with
amazement, the great holes made in the sides of their sheep, and saw
some of them writhing in agony on the ground. At first they could
not discover what had caused the trouble. But one day a shepherd,
watching through a spy-glass, saw a Kea alight on the back of a sheep
and begin to dig with its cruel strong beak into the loin of the living
animal; to and fro ran the defenceless sheep, the Kea, undaunted,
keeping to its victim, which was released from suffering only by death.
Thus Mr. Boss.
Mr. Marriner, wishful to extract the truth and nothing but the
truth as to the guilt or innocence of the accused Kea, made very care-
fully guarded investigations and took strict precautions to make the
evidence as reliable as possible, and in order to ensure this refused
any evidence but the accounts of actual eye-witnesses, each willing
to swear to the truth of his evidence before a Justice of the Peace,
if necessary ; and he is of opinion that as far as human evidence can
be relied on for its veracity it is conclusively proved that the Kea
does actually attack and kill sheep.
Very much more might well be written about the Kea : of the
price placed on its head ; of the Kea-hunting, resulting in the slaughter
of thousands of birds, by gun and by poison. Kea-hunting is taken
up by men all over the Kea country. The extreme inquisitiveness of
the birds is often in the hunter's favour. The devices for attracting
them are innumerable and ingenious, the result being long strings of
Kea-heads, for which as much as 10s. per head has been offered and
paid, together with the hunter's expenses ; the price to-day is half a
crown--but space forbids. In spite of all efforts directed against them
the Keas are still proving a cause of grave trouble to New Zealand
sheep-farmers.
Inquiry made the other day of the Intelligence Officer of the
Dominion of New Zealand, elicits the statement that " these birds

(Thalassaetus jpelagicus)
There is one example of this most interesting Sea-Eagle at the
London Zoo, which was obtained through an exchange with Moscow
Zoo Park. In colour it is principally black and brown, with a white
wedge-shaped tail and thighs, and white on the lower part of the back
and wing coverts. It is about 41 inches in length, one of its peculiarities
is thafc it has fourteen tail feathers instead of the usual twelve of other
Eagles.
This bird was originally discovered by Steller. It feeds on young
seals, foxes, and Ptarmigan, also on dead fish and other carrion. Its
eggs are broad and of somewhat pointed oval form, being plain white
in colour. The shell is slightly rough and entirely without gloss.
There is a very fine exhibit in the Natural History Museum of these
birds, one of the specimens which the plate of this bird is taken from.
Its habitat is in Kamatschtka and the Japanese Islands.

Quail, is distributed widely on the mainland of Australia but is always
a rarity in captivity, although in some seasons it is common in the oat
crops in this state. It was not till December, 1936, over a year after
I first started keeping Quail, that I managed to secure a specimen
of this bird, finding one in a small grain store where a few birds were
kept as a sideline. This bird, a female, was obtained for the modest
sum of half a crowm. About a month later I secured two males from a
friend who had bred the species in captivity some years previously,

I believe tbe only other recorded breeding. When first introduced the
female bullied them so much that I had to place them in an adjoining
pen for a few days, but thereafter all was well and I parted with one of
the males to the Adelaide Zoo where there was also a solitary female.
Her greeting to the male was quite different from my bird's, she immedi-
ately displayed to him with the accompanying booming note, just like
that of the Painted Quail (T. varia ), only not so loud, and there was no
persecution. Once settled down my pair continued amicably together
and on 28th August, 1937,1 discovered a white egg with brown speckling
in a nest made of a few pieces of dried grass situated amongst the roots
of some growing grass. A second egg was laid on 30th August and a
third on 1st September, and the male commencing sitting after the
second egg was laid. At no time prior to the eggs being laid had I seen
or heard the female displaying to her mate, but thereafter she usually
did so when the male left the nest to feed, but I never saw her go near
the nest. About midday on 13th September, I found the male brooding
two chicks, the third egg was just chipped and still in the nest and
I removed it and placed it in an incubator and although the chick
hatched its legs were deformed and it had to be destroyed. The two
chicks naturally hatched were tiny, as can be imagined from the size
of the adults, dark brown in colour, with a lighter stripe down each side
of the back. They were looked after solely by the male and I had
to remove the female the same evening as she was attacking both
the male and the chicks. The male caught numerous small insects for
them which they took from his beak and they also relished chopped up
mealworms and small earthworms which the male would pick out
of freshly turned-up earth for them. When three days old they began
to attempt to pick up fragments of food for themselves. On the fourth
day I found one chick dead but the survivor continued to flourish and
grew rapidly and at the end of five week's time was as large as and
practically indistinguishable from its father. Continuing to grow,
by the seventh week it was as large as the mother and, having under-
gone a partial moult, acquired the plumage of the female. Having
removed the young bird when it was about five weeks old and replaced
the female, another clutch of three eggs was laid almost immediately
but these proved infertile.

By W. H. Workman
In the middle of June a friend gave me a pair of young Curlew
(Numenius arquata) which he had caught on his moor. They were
pretty well fledged but unable to fly and with quite short beaks.
Naturally I was most anxious to keep them alive and well. I thought
the best way would be to put them into a largish aviary where I have
three beautiful Black-tailed Godwits, my idea being that the Godwits,
which are quite like Curlew with the beak turned slightly up instead
of down, would soon teach them where to find their food. This happily
proved to be correct and instead of finding two dead Curlew I found
them growing rapidly and now they are fully adult with curved beaks.
I feed them on a staple diet from a glass bowl containing Spillers
biscuit meal mixed with one-third boiled rice well scalded with
boiling water. Two or three times a week they get raw heart cut up
fine and mixed through the scalded meal. Besides this they get a smaller
bowl of bread and milk. This they are very fond of and seem to go for
it before the biscuit, but both are finished by the morning. For live food
I give occasionally a few earthworms and also now and then some
mealworms. They have plenty of clean water in the form of a little
shallow pond in which they delight to wade.
About August they started to call and it is very pleasant when
one is awake at night to hear their weird and lonely whistle, now and
again being answered by some wild Curlew passing overhead. I do
hope my neighbours listen to their call with the same pleasure that
I do, wafting one back to the wild moorland mountains where the
Curlew spend their breeding season, but perhaps they just turn round
on their pillows and say to themselves, " I wish Workman would take
his- birds out of this." Who knows ? I, for one, never inquire.
Like misfortunes, blessings never come singly and the same kind
friend very shortly afterwards brought me a pair of fledgeling Bing
Plovers (Charadrius Jiiaticula) from Strangford Lough, perfect little
birds nearly able to fly. Well, I thought to myself, there is little hope
for these Curlew are all very well, there is something to work on,
but these little mites, what a hope. However, there they were and

it was up to me to do my best. I put the little fellows into a small
aviary inhabited by a flock of Zebra Finches. I could keep an eye on
the feeding, which at first consisted of hard-boiled egg chopped up with
fine biscuit meal and boiled rice which, with a few earthworms and
mealworms, they took to at once, never looking back, very much to
my surprise.
After a week or two I gradually introduced the ordinary insect
food mixed with boiled rice, grated carrot, etc., and dropped the egg,
substituting very finely minced raw heart. This they get three times
a week and now I am giving them a little of the scalded Spillers biscuit
meal as well. They are very dainty little birds and most interesting
to watch as they are quite tame, running about nodding their heads
backwards and forwards, sometimes standing on one leg in true wader
fashion or giving their plaintive little whistle.
It is a great pity Waders are so difficult to get nowadays, they
are really not so hard to feed and to me they are about the most
interesting aviary birds we have. Perhaps it is because I have always
loved to w~atch them in their wild state, and as for their nests and
eggs there is nothing more beautiful in nature.

An account of the Pheasant section at the Palace Show was given
in last month's Magazine and there is little need for further comment.
The general public showed a keen appreciation of these birds and the
special lighting showed a great improvement on that prevailing last
year. I must mention one remarkable exhibit. A Chinquis Peacock
Pheasant of quite recent importation was one of the steadiest Pheasants
on view, it gained the first prize in its class and was awarded the special
prize for the best Pheasant exhibited. Surely this finally proves that
Pheasants can be exhibited with safety and honour to the Society.
The O.P.S. Annual General Meeting was attended by sixty-seven
members, and we considered this number most satisfactory. Mr. Balfour
was elected to the Chair in the absence of M. Delacour: his chairmanship

was marked by a rigid determination to insist on members adhering
to the points under discussion, thus the meeting went off in splendid
style and we were grateful to Mr. Balfour for his ability in this matter.
There can be no doubt that the manner in which Pheasants were
classified last season did not meet with the approval of our members,
and in future there will be four classes instead of three, and Goldens
and Amhersts will be separated. If the enthusiasm shown by members
at this meeting is reflected by an increased number of keen exhibitors,
it will be most gratifying. At last our members appear to be aware of
the fact that Pheasants are most adaptable for showing purposes: it
is now an established fact. At this meeting a new Committee was
formed, some new members will undoubtedly strengthen our forces
and I must congratulate Miss Greenyer, Messrs. Malisoux, Edwards,
and Major Elliott Benham on being elected. We all regretted the
absence of our President, M. Delacour, but it was unavoidable. A
hearty vote of thanks was accorded him for his gift to the Society of
the coloured plates which adorn our Journal. Without such generosity
we could not possibly afford to present two coloured plates with each
half-yearly issue. We were pleased to welcome several members from
the Continent, these included Dr. J. Derscheid, Messrs. E. Fooks,
G. Blazer, and Schuyl, their enthusiasm was most infectious. Also
congratulations to Mr. Fooks for the able manner in which he judged
the Pheasants : his judgment was faultless. The thanks of our Society
are due to Mr. and Mrs. Bennett for the most able manner in which they
made all arrangements at the Palace Show. There is a lot of forecasting
to be done and nothing was neglected. Also our thanks to Mr. F. E.
Thomas for coming to our assistance at a vital moment. It was found
that hessian was not allowed at the Show as it is of an inflammable
nature : Mr. Thomas kindly provided, free of charge, hessian which
had been treated and made non inflammable.

The following analysis of the breeding and health results in a
big collection may be of interest.
The birds were housed in twelve fixed aviaries of varying sizes,
with tiled floors ; in a large number of movable aviaries the great
majority of which were 24 ft. by 8 ft. by 8 ft., and contained one pair
only ; and, in the case of new arrivals, temporarily, in cages in bird-
rooms.
The period under review is really somewhat less than twelve months,
for although the first pairs were transferred from Peasmarsh to
Haywards Heath about a year ago, the process of moving continued
for several months and the last birds did not arrive before May. With
the exception of two Birds of Paradise, the whole lot were members
of the Parrot family.
The total number of birds to come under consideration is 266,
of which eighty-nine have been in the collection for nine months or
more, while the remainder I have had for periods varying from several
months to a few days.
The following species are included :--G-rey, Blue-fronted Amazon,
and Backet-tailed Parrots ; Queen of Bavaria and Bed-breasted

The Marquess of Tavistock--Facts and Figures
As is usual in a well-managed collection, the summer and early
autumn months have been the most fatal and the cold months the most
healthy, owing, presumably, to the fact that low temperatures are
inimical to many bacteria harmful to birds. By " a well-managed
collection " I means one where the birds are not only correctly housed
and fed and not overcrowded ; but where individuals dangerous to
each other are not forced to occupy the same quarters and delicate
species are not obliged to endure temperatures too low for their safety
and comfort. I provide abundant heat for all newly-imported birds
and, in the aviary shelters, for the Lories, late-breeding Hooded,
Swifts, Grass Parrakeets, Racket-tailed Parrots, Red-breasted Conures,
young Derbyans, and Birds of Paradise. The Banksian Cockatoos and
many of the young Broadtails have very slight heat in their shelters,
as have the Queen of Bavaria Conures, Blue-fronted Amazons, and all
the members of the Ringneck family during periods of intense frost.
The provision of a little warmth during hard frost is desirable for
members of the Ringneck family (absolutely essential for Malabars)
to protect their toes from damage, spoiling them for show, and
in bad cases for breeding. The causes of death from disease
were :---
Septicaemia, 7 cases ; enteritis, 4 ; paratyphoid, 3 ; congestion of
the lungs, 3 ; pneumonia, 1 ; infectious disease of the liver, 1 ; colon
infection, 1 ; gastritis, 1 ; pericarditis, 1 ; and heart failure, 3.
Septicaemia claimed a newly-arrived Rock Grass Parrakeet, 2 young
Rock Peplars, 2 young Yellow-mantles, and 2 young Adelaides ;
paratyphoid, 2 young Crimson-wings and a young Adelaide ; con-
gestion of the lungs, a young New Zealand, a Rock Grass, and a Yellow-
belly ; pneumonia, a young Ringneck ; infectious disease of the liver,
an Adelaide ; gastritis, a young Swift; pericarditis, a young Ringneck ;
colon infection, a Rothschild's Bird of Paradise ; and heart failure,
a New Zealand, a Splendid, and a Roseate Cockatoo.
January was responsible for one casualty from disease ; February,
March, and April had no deaths ; May had 1--a new arrival; June, 2 ;
July, 8 ; August, 6 ; September, 3 ; October, 1 ; November, 2 ; and
December, 2, one of which was a rickety, newly-fledged youngster.
This casualty list is a fairly normal one for a tolerably healthy district,

The Marquess of Tavistock--Facts and Figures 85
the most remarkable feature being, perhaps, the absence of loss from
liver and kidney troubles--one case only, a hen Adelaide kept in one
of the fixed aviaries. It is possible that this rather unusual degree of
immunity may be due to the provision of minerals, especially Iodine
Nibbles. Only two species did very badly--Bock Grass Parrakeets,
all four of which got ill and died at one time or another ; and New
Zealand Parrakeets, of which the breeding pair and one of their four
young ones were lost.
About thirty-eight birds fell ill and recovered. The majority showed
symptoms of ordinary enteritis, but two---a Barnard and a Blue-
bonnet, both new arrivals--were cases of catarrhal enteritis, the seed
passing through them undigested. They were cured by being fed on
soaked seed and being kept at a temperature of 85* F.
A cock Layard, which became badly paralysed, made a slow but
remarkable recovery and the same was true of a young Swift which
lost the use of its wings and to some extent of its legs and breathed badly
with open beak. This latter case is the first instance I have ever known
of a bird recovering when it has begun breathing with its beak open.
There were four cases of ordinary egg-binding--three Bingnecks
and a Mealy Bosella. All these hens were saved by heat (no oiling),
and all sat, though some were in hospital many days. Two reared their
young ; one hatched but lost her young ; and one had her egg acci-
dentally destroyed when near hatching.
An Ultramarine Lory twice had trouble with a soft-shelled egg,
not being in the best of condition when she insisted on trying to breed.
As she proved unable to lay the egg naturally, it had to be removed,
a difficult and dangerous operation which my aviary attendant was
fortunately skilful enough to perform successfully.
One case of a 44 captivity vice " occurred--feather-plucking in a
young Mealy Bosella, for no obvious reason.
As already indicated, an experiment has been tried for the first
time in providing all the birds with an abundant supply of minerals in
the form of rock salt, cuttle-fish bone, charcoal, and Iodine Nibbles.
The latter seem to be appreciated to a greater or lesser degree by
almost everything in the collection, with the exception of the Lories,
adult Derbyans, Hooded, Queen of Bavaria Conures, and Lovebirds.

The Marquess of Tavistock--Facts and Figures
Bluebonnets, Crimsonwings, Kings, and Barrabands seem to be
particularly keen on them ; also the Gang-gang Cockatoos.
A trial was also made of giving daily a very small quantity of
sweetened bread-and-milk, a piece about the size of the last joint of
the finger for each bird. This is eaten voraciously by the Gang-gang
Cockatoos and occasionally by the Leadbeaters and Banksian. It is
also much appreciated by the Amboina Kings, most of the Crimsonwings,
Barrabands, and Bock Peplars, some of the Common Kings, the Amazon
and Grey Parrots, some of the Bayards and Plumheads, the Conures,
Swifts, and some of the young Bingnecks. It is more or less ignored by
the Broadtails with the exception of some of the young birds bred
this year. The Boseate Cockatoos, Malabars, and Palm Cockatoos also
do not care for it.
I tried the experiment of giving twice a week a very small quantity
of cooked beef fat. This is much appreciated by the Gang-gang
Cockatoos, the Amboina Kings, and by some of the Common Kings,
but is ignored by most of the other birds.
It is generally noticeable that young birds bred in captivity are
more ready to try new experiments in diet and take to new foods than
their wild-caught parents. This may be partly due to the
curiosity of youth, but their need of certain food elements, absent
in the normal diet of captivity, may have something to do with
it as well.
Young birds whose parents were taking bread-and-milk freely
when they were feeding them in the nest, were, as a rule, rather notice-
ably large, fine, and well-grown on leaving the nest, although they did
not appear to be better able to resist infectious disease than those of
their fellows who were somewhat less well-grown and had been reared
on seed and green food alone.
The breeding record now remains to be considered. In some ways
the past season was not an altogether fair test, as the birds were being
moved to a new locality until the spring was well advanced. Surpris-
ingly few former breeding pairs were, however, upset by the move,
and in the three or four cases where they did not settle down and lay
this season, it was almost invariably when they had had to be moved
to a new aviary some weeks after their arrival at Haywards Heath,

i.e. they had to endure not merely a single move to a new situation,
but a double one.
The total number of pairs that had some sort of real chance of
nesting was 54, but this includes a certain number of individuals
which, though acclimatized, were only obtained in the middle of the
breeding season.
Of the 54 pairs, 20 reared good and perfect young ; 3 had broods,
some members of which were fair specimens and some were rickety ;
2 reared rickety broods ; 7 lost their young in the nest; 1 had infertile
eggs ; 1 had their eggs accidentally destroyed ; 1 laid but would not
sit ; 1 are now sitting for the first time ; 1 produced soft-shelled eggs ;
2 got as far as pairing but did not lay ; and 13 examined their nests
but got no further. None took absolutely no interest in their nests,
and 5 unmated hens laid and incubated infertile eggs.
The total of young birds hatched was 97 ; the total of strong young
reared 66 ; one probably strong young bird was killed by cold ; another
probably strong young one by neglect of the foster parent ; 2 indifferent,
though not actually rickety, young were reared ; 15 rickety young
lived to leave the nest, of which 7 improved and survived, and 5 died
by accident or were destroyed ; 12 presumably weakly young died in
the nest, not appearing to be neglected by their parents.
Two cases of egg-eating by cocks occurred, the offenders being a
Grey Parrot and a Roseate Cockatoo, the latter having exhibited the
vice before he came to me.
There was one example of vicious and abnormal breeding behaviour,
a cock Mealy Rosella attacking and injuring his mate without any
reasonable provocation.
One of the most noteworthy features in the record is, perhaps, the
very low percentage of infertile eggs : the Plumheads concerned
in this case also proved infertile last year, although they were seen
to pair.
Considering the record of the various species in more detail, one
pair of Yellow-mantled Rosellas reared 7 strong young; two pairs of
Mealy Rosellas reared 5 and 2 respectively, and a pair of Pennants 6.
Adelaides reared 7 young, 3 strong and 4 rather rickety. Stanleys
lost their brood in the frost; the hen Yellow-belly, an aged bird probably

going back, laid three eggs and would not sit ; and Brown's and Yellow-
rumps got no further than looking at their nests. Ringnecks reared
6 good young, including 2 lutinos, and 1 new hen mated to a defective
lutino-bred cock lost her young one in the nest. One pair of Plum-
heads lost their young in the nest and another reared 4 rickety young
which were killed by accident and by vermin. A Slaty-head paired to
a Plumhead reared good young, as did a pair of Layards, Malabars,
and Derbyans. Other completely successful pairs were Swifts, Tahiti
Blue Lories, Rock Peplars, Kings, and Yellow-fronted New Zealands.
Two pairs of Crimsonwings did well, but a third pair had two rickety
young and one good one. Leadbeaters' Cockatoos reared rickety
young and Roseates, Blue-fronted Amazons, and Racket-tailed Parrots
lost their young in the nest. A young Grey Parrot hatched very late
also died in the nest but was almost certainly killed by cold. Hooded
Parrakeets very late in the year reared, in a heated shelter, one fair
young one and 3 rickety ones. A Barraband paired to a King, reared
3 strong hybrids and one inferior one, not, however, rickety. A pair
of Solitary Lories are incubating at the time of writing.

Recently two inquiries about this and a letter from Mr. Allen
Silver about a hybrid breeding success in Essex, have made me look
up my records.
These will interest the inquirers and, I hope, others.
Blue and Yellow Macaw (Ara ararauna (Linn)).--The earliest
record is to be found in Lauder and Brown's Parrots published in 1833.
Here we have a good account of real success between 1818 and 1822
at Caen in France. In that period 62 eggs were laid in 19 broods ;
25 hatched and 15 of the young lived to good old age.
In Die gefiederte Welt, 1901, p. 303, there is an account of success

Dr. E. Hopkinson -- Macaws Bred in Confinement 89
with Herr Sharland in Germany ; a pair nested in a cupboard and
reared one young one, which left the nest at 94 days old. Another
German success is given in the same paper, 1932, p. 110.
In Western Australia this Macaw was bred by Mr. Padbury from
about 1926 to 1935. They were bred in glorified poultry runs and when
I was there in 1932 there were two pairs of home-bred birds in the
aviaries. The old birds nested every year, but none of the young had
yet shown any desire to follow their example.
The following hybrids are on record :--
Blue and Yellow x Red and Yellow Macaw (ararauna x
chloroptera). --Bred at the Dresden Zoo in June, 1897, teste Neunzig's
Fremdlandischen Stubenvogel (1921).
A friend of Mr. Silver's has bred a hybrid " Blue and Yellow X
Red and Green Macaw " this year, which was nine weeks old and doing
well when reported. Mr. Silver is almost sure that the hen was chloro&apos;p-
tera, which is also often known as the " Green-winged '* Macaw.
Perhaps this will produce further good news of the event.
Hybrids with the male Red and Yellow Macaw (q.v.), have
also been obtained.
Red and Blue Macaw (A. macao (Linn)).--Bred in the U.S.A.
by Holmes teste the list given in Aviculture (U.S.A.), January, 1932,
but no details were supplied.
In the Zoo in 1901 there were four hybrid Macaws, macao X militaris ,
which had been bred in Milan, Italy ; see P.Z.S. , 1901, p. 279.
Red and Yellow Macaw (A. chloroptera (Gray)).--Two were
reared at liberty in 1936 at Lilford, and one young bird had been
reared several years earlier teste Moody in Avic. Mag., 1936, 338.
Hybrids with the male Blue and Yellow Macaw (q.v.), are
recorded, and I saw in New Zealand three hybrids whose parentage

In February, 1936, a number of Spiny-cheeked Honeyeaters
were caught in the Pinnaroo District and have been in my aviaries
since that time. On 13th October a pair was first seen building a nest
in an ash tree about 10 feet from the ground. On the 19th there were
two eggs, and two young were hatched on 2nd November. Both parents
were feeding white ants and meal-worms. All went well until 5th Novem-
ber when it was noticed that one young was missing, and no trace
of this could be found anywhere in the aviary. Possibly the parents
thought they were not getting sufficient food for the two so decided
to dispose of one. The remaining young bird continued to thrive until
Saturday, 6th November, when I thought its end had come. I returned
home at 6 p.m. and took meal-worms in. These could not be placed
in a dish as other birds would get them, so I stood about 15 feet away
from the nest and threw the worms, which were caught in mid-air,
to the parents. It was not an easy matter to find the parents as there
were nine Spiny-cheeks in the aviary, the only way to recognize
them was to watch if they ate the worms or held them in the beak--
the parents were never seen to eat a worm, but would pack several
in their beaks. On this particular day they secured the worms and
went to the nest, but did not feed the young bird. After waiting some
time I went to the tree and found the young one on the ground, cold
but still alive. The nest was inspected and found to be loose on one

side, evidently allowing the young one to slide out. The nest was tied
securely in two places with binding wire and the baby replaced. Within
a few minutes the old birds fed it, and yet they would not feed it while
on the ground. The way they went to the nest with worms when the
young one was on the ground appeared as if they were asking for
something to be done. On Sunday morning, 14th November, eight
days after falling out of the nest and twelve days old, the young bird
left the nest, well feathered and able to fly.
The colouring appears to be identical with that of the old birds,
the tail is about 1J inches long.
Feeding .--White ants, mealworms, yolk of egg and cake, bread
and milk, honey water with bread soaked in it. They were only seen
feeding ants and mealworms.

Madam, --I find that a correction is necessary in my description of the
colour of the down of the nestling Tahiti Blue Lory. Owing to the bad
light I must have mistaken sprouting feathers for down when I made my
observation of the first nestling. More careful examination of the two young
of the later brood shows that the down is sparse and is grey in colour, not black.
The Solitary Lories' first attempt has unfortunately ended in failure. One
egg disappeared, and the nestling in the other died when half out of the shell.

COMMENTS ON MR. MARSDEN'S LETTER
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998767957446809" page_id="56318810"  page_num="92" year="" vol="">
Madam,-- I have read in your current issue the letter signed John W.
Marsden, and I cannot refrain from expressing my regret that so ill-advised
an attack on the editor of that famous little weekly, Cage Birds, should
have found space in a publication so widely read and of so far-reaching
influence as the Avicultural Magazine.
In my early days as an ardent aviculturist, I sought and received advice
from Cage Birds which has been the basis of whatever success I may subse-
quently have achieved, and I have no doubt that many others are in a position
to offer a similar tribute. That the advice was free from the recommenda-
tion of the products of particular producers did not minimize its value ; on
the contrary, it gave me confidence in its genuineness and solidarity.
Your correspondent ignores, possibly quite unintentionally, the business
point of view. I doubt whether any independent journal concerned in
aviculture or in any other hobby or business would enhance its popularity
or usefulness by boosting the wares of specific manufacturers. Advertise-
ments are an essential adjunct in the support of a journal, but they must
speak for themselves. Editorial suggestion and advice must concern the
product; to boost or accept for publication criticisms on particular sources
of supply would surely result in the antagonism of numbers of advertisers to
the detriment of the journal, as a book of reference for its contributors, and,
internally, as a business proposition.
In view of the attitude he assumes, is not Mr. Marsden's appeal for " fair
play to all " somewhat incongruously inept ?
F. E. Thomas.
Madam,--A letter in last month's Magazine, signed by John Marsden,
calls for comment, and I do not think that such statements should pass
unchallenged. Personally I have no financial interest whatever in Cage
Birds, although I am an admirer of this splendid weekly bird paper; but
when I see in cold print such allegations as Mr. Marsden makes, then I feel
that such uncalled-for and undesirable remarks should be resented by every
reader of the Avicultural Magazine. I have always found that the editor
of Cage Birds never refuses to publish any fair criticisms provided he has
the necessary space. One constantly reads of such criticisms of the various
writers, and I may be allowed to mention an incident which would serve
to prove that the Editor gives preference to letters that disagree with his
writers. Recently Mr. F. E. Thomas wrote a letter to Cage Birds and in very
plain words refused to accept a statement I had made in an article I had
written for Cage Birds. I am not suggesting that Mr. Thomas wrote in an
unpleasant manner, far from it, but please note that when I wrote my reply
and endeavoured to explain why I had made this statement, the Editor did
not publish this letter. I felt slightly peeved, and asked him for a reason
and I was very graciously informed that the correspondence column was
filled for that week. I accepted this explanation in a sporting manner, and
that was the end of it. It is more than possible that in Mr. Marsden's case
a similar explanation would have been forthcoming, and it is grossly unfair
and unsportsmanlike of him to impute unfair treatment. I am informed on
good authority that the Editor of Cage Birds receives weekly many letters

most regrettable that Mr. Marsden should have aired his views in this manner
in such a reputable Magazine as ours, and he should at least have discovered
the reason for his letter being excluded before rushing into print.

Madam,-- The trader who deals in nest boxes would like to reply to the
letter that appeared in a recent issue. I am as much a private breeder of
Budgerigars as Mr. Marsden is, and I must protest against the ungentlemanly
sarcasm of the term " dealer in nest boxes ". May I say that these nest
boxes were originally intended for my own use. Other breeders liked and
wanted them. By their sale I was able to ensure a humble living for an
otherwise unemployable invalid, who undertook the work of constructing
them, and it is a pity Mr. Marsden forces me to disclose a small work of
charity.

COMMENT ON DR. AMSLER'S ARTICLE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998561" page_id="56318811"  page_num="93" year="" vol="">
Madam,-- I thoroughly enjoyed reading Dr. Amsler's article in last
month's Magazine, perhaps his experience in rearing Pheasant chicks made
a special appeal to me. Up to date it cannot be said that he has had even a
modicum of good luck, but his turn will come. He refers to broods of chicks
" gradually " getting smaller and smaller, and blames rats and stoats for this,
I think the use of this adverb conclusively points to rats, a stoat would, I think,
make short work of the chicks and the process would be anything but gradual.
I do not think the Elliot's chick will wander far if one provides plenty of
cover, they will hunt for insects, but I have found that they will not go
far if the insect food is to be obtained near at hand. If this is not available,
then no Pheasant chick is so persistent in travelling in search of insects.
I cannot agree that Peacock Pheasant chicks are delicate in their early
stages. I quite honestly state that I have found that these chicks are easier
to rear than any other species if we except the Silver and possibly the&gt;Reeve's.
Dr. Amsler suggests that high perches will provide safety for the hens if the
male bird has his flying powers reduced by clipping the feathers of one wing
(he is presuming of course that the male bird is a bully). That is correct
and a good idea, but if the upper mandible is filed down to the " quick ",
then the male bird cannot seriously damage the hens.
Personally, I never turn the eggs, and have found that by placing them
in an upright position with the larger end uppermost, this will suffice to
preserve the germ from damage. I have kept eggs in this manner for a
fortnight, and the results have been very pleasing. Dr. Amsler's remark
about dusting the broody with powder is splendid, and of far greater
importance than many phasianists imagine; a chick which is harbouring
numberless insects cannot possibly thrive. I am convinced that the Kestrel
hawk will take Pheasant chicks. I have heard it said that only an occasional
rogue will do so, but do not believe it. Dr. Amsler is quite right. I cannot,
however, agree with his " kind " remarks about the Sparrow Hawk. I had

the following experience. I was missing chicks, and in order to discover the
miscreant I hid behind a bush. Soon after a hen Sparrow Hawk paid her
visit, and I went for my gun (yes, I should have had it before !) about two
hours afterwards she came again, but from a different angle, and she carried
away another chick before I could shoot. That Hawk paid three more visits
that day, but the third was her last, as I then got in my shot. I was told
that if one shot the hen the male bird would let the young starve rather
than seek food, and this statement appeared to be correct. Dr. Amsler's
advice about " cottoning " the rearing ground is sound, but it would take
me a month to do this.
I can see no reason for anyone assuming a supercilious smile on reading
his notes on rearing, such thoroughness is seldom encountered, and I can
only hope that he will experience better luck this spring. I hope he will
change his opinion about rearing Peacock Pheasant chicks, and if a Sparrow
Hawk does pay him a visit, then I sincerely hope he will not rest content until
the evening, before taking precautions.
We Pheasant rearers have our troubles, but this surely adds to the zest
of our hobby ? If a cricketer was always assured of making a century, would
not the game soon bore that man ? I was always rather efficient at making
a " duck ", but I loved the game. Let us look on Pheasant rearing with a
similar outlook, and when good luck comes, then surely we shall reach the
sublime heights of our endeavours.

A CORRECTION
Madam,-- In Mr. Alex. Hampe's letter of 5th November, on page 363
of the December issue, Avicultural Magazine, Mr. Hampe notes the
successful breeding of the Sumatran Bronze-tailed Peacock Pheasant in the
Berlin Zoo, and remarks : "So far only Mr. Delacour had success with this
species."
Mr. Hampe is in error regarding this last statement, as both Mr. J. W.
Steinbeck of Concord, California, and Mr. Leland Smith of Fair Oaks,
California, had much success in breeding the Bronze-tailed Sumatrans during
the seasons of 1936 and 1937.
The offspring of Mr. Smith's and Mr. Steinbeck's birds have been rather
well distributed among phasianists in this country, and since this variety
is said to be a very ready breeder, we rather expect that another season will
see quite a few breeders successful in breeding the Sumatrans.
Thus far the more attractive Malayan Bronze-tails have not been brought
to America, but if one can believe a statement from a collector now in the
field, in a letter I have recently received, they may come in this coming spring.

Madam,-- Referring to our correspondence of some time since regarding
Sandhill Cranes, Mr. Lee S. Crandall of the New York Zoological Park,
Curator of Birds, tells me that a few years ago eggs were produced by the
Sandhills at the Park, but no young were hatched.
Cranes have not been widely kept in this country, or perhaps, I should
say not so generally as in Europe. About the only species of which I have
any record as to breeding in this country are Demoiselles, White-necked (in
California), Lilfords, Asiatic White, and the record made by Mr. Wm. J.
Mackensen, of Yardley, Penna., some years ago in rearing to maturity
a young Stanley's Crane. Unfortunately the breeding female was sub-
sequently lost through an attack of diphtheria so the experience was not
repeated.
We have here a pair of Sandhills which are very well mated, and which
should in time nest. One interesting thing I have observed about the Sandhills
is that the brown juvenile plumage is partially carried over into the third
year and some birds are nearly three years of age before they finally assume
the lovely grey adult plumage in its entirety.
The Sandhills are so happy and frolicsome by nature that it will be a real
achievement when a good stock of captive-bred birds is finally started.
The custom of your Avicultural Society in giving recognition of the first
breeding of the various species is unexcelled as it gives a definite record of
the first breeding of rare sorts. I have only gotten information about the
Sandhill and other Cranes through much correspondence and research,
which would have been obviated had our American Avicultural so long a
record of first breedings.
C. L. Sibley.
[It is claimed that Sandhills have been reared at Lilford and it is hoped
to publish particulars of the breeding of this and other species of Cranes
before very long.-- Editor.]

A number of our birds of prey are faced with the risk of extermination

extent by the birds being shot by gamekeepers and others.
First of all we shall approach the owners of estates and the lessees of
shoots and ask their permission for making an arrangement with their game-
keepers for the protection of these birds. There should be no difficulty about
this as the birds that we have in mind are so rare that the harm they do to
game is infinitesimal. The gamekeepers would be asked to protect these
nests, and they would receive a certain sum of money when the young left
safely. We would arrange for one of our members to visit each nest at the

vital time and to report progress. Members of the public who wish to adopt
a nest could choose the species which they most wished to protect and
arrangements could be made for them to visit the nest just before the young
were ready to fly. If any of your readers are interested in this scheme will
they please communicate with Mr. Robert Blockey, of the Educational
Museum, Haslemere, Surrey ?
Rightly or wrongly birds have been blamed for the introduction of foot-
and-mouth disease into this country. If birds are responsible, Starlings, from
their habit of associating with sheep and cattle, are undoubtedly the culprits.
We are anxious to settle this point as soon as possible, as otherwise we fear
that there may be an indiscriminate destruction of our immigrant birds,
including Fieldfares, Redwings, etc. We have suggested to those engaged in
investigating foot-and-mouth disease experiments which will decide whether
it is possible for Starlings to spread this disease.
By collecting pellets, thrown up by birds of prey, from all parts of the
country and having them analysed, we hope to prove that the majority of
these birds are more beneficial than harmful to game preservers. To make
the test a fair one these pellets would have to be collected in the breeding
season, say from March to July.

THE BUFF-THROATED SUNBIRD
(Chalcomitra adelberti)

distinguished from other Sunbirds by its somewhat unusual markings,
the underside being chestnut and the throat buff bordered by black,
and the chin black. The forehead is metallic green.
This species has a somewhat limited range being found only in
the forests of West Africa from Liberia to Nigeria.
The subject of the accompanying plate was caught in the Ashanti
district of the Gold Coast. In company with Superb Sunbirds ( Cinnyris
superbus), Olive-bellied Sunbirds (C. chloropygius ), Olive Sunbirds
(Cyanomitra verticalis), and two or three species of Anthreptes, as well
as numbers of Bulbuls ( Pycnonotus barbatus), Buff-throated Sunbirds
congregate in the tall bombax trees, gaining sustenance from the
large scarlet flowers, which are such an irresistible attraction to all
nectar-feeding birds. During the months of January and February--
the period of efflorescence of the bombax trees in Ashanti--Buff-
throated Sunbirds could be seen frequently, but in March they seemed
to disappear completely, whereas most of the other Sunbirds remained
to feed on the flowers of bananas and paw-paws, etc. It is quite likely
that the former migrated to another district where the bombax were
.flowering later.

Like most species of the genus Chalcomitra , it does not become so
confidingly tame as some of the Anlhreptes or Cinnyris, but its striking
and unusual coloration and graceful movements combine to make
it one of the most desirable of the nectarinidse.
Owing to their feeding habits, Buff-throated Sunbirds are
exceedingly difficult to capture alive. Bombax trees grow to a great
height and the lower half of the trunk is branchless, and so climbing
them in the humid enervating heat of the Gold Coast forest is an
arduous proceeding. The crevices in the bark harbour colonies of
vicious black ants which emerge in thousands as one labours up the
tree, and if one can survive this onslaught and reach the branches it
is to discover that the fun has only just commenced, for here large
red ants that make their nests among the leaves advance from all
directions " with intent to do bodily harm ".
Both these varieties will fight an intruder like maddened warriors
and swarm over him in incredible numbers inflicting painful bites.
Added to this, swarms of small flies, resembling minute bees in shape,
are attracted to one's eyes for the moisture, and hover in front of them
with an annoying zigzag flight.
The upper trunk and branches of bombax trees are studded with
protuberances with sharp thorny tips so that it is almost impossible
to climb them without getting one's arms badly torn.

During the late autumn of 1936 I received from a Continental
dealer eight small birds which were offered erroneously.
Although they were not the birds I expected to receive, they
belonged to a group which previously I had not seen alive.
Upon investigation, they proved to be Warbling Finches of three
species, viz. Poospiza whitei, ornata, and torquata. The Binged
Warbling Finches were dying from malnutrition and were too far
gone to resuscitate, and the others were not happy on a seed diet, so

I supplied insectile food and meal-worms and mixed canary and grass
seeds together for them and placed them in a roomy cage. Soon they
recovered and became pugnacious so that I had to keep male and
female White's Finch apart and the others, which were two pairs of
Pretty Warbling Finches, caged in pairs. They moulted in the winter,
and by the spring were all in perfect feather ; sprightly active birds,
almost noteless, and eating little or no seed when soft or living food
was present.
About the end of April I placed them in aviaries, but found them
anything but amicable, so allocated one aviary to the White's Finches
and allowed the Pretty Finches to live with a pair of Greenfinches in
another.
During May the male White's Finch started " carting " hay and
lodged a nest on some fir needles in a very insecure position. Two
eggs were laid, the hen sitting close ; but, as I expected, the nest was
dislodged, eggs broken, and their first attempt at rearing a family
came to naught.
I made a hay nest, placed it in an open fronted box, and shortly
afterwards the male adopted the provision and my maid informed me
the hen was sitting steadily. Other matters claimed my attention, and
the care of the birds was left to her. She reported an egg-shell and was
instructed to keep meal-worms present all the time, and a friend
kept me fairly well supplied with large wood ants and their cocoons.
Meal-worms in a white condition and their pupae were used more than
the ant cocoons. Both fed the young bird, the other egg being clear.
Apparently incubation lasted twelve to fourteen days and the young
bird was several days old when seen about 1st or 2nd July. When
it left the nest it was discovered at the end of the place near the door,
but flew back under cover and did not " flounder " about; soon taking
advantage of a ledge and a peastick placed on the ground. After two
days it was seldom visible, hiding behind some pine branches most of
the time. A satisfactory report of its well-being was given to me
morning and night as I had no time to investigate for myself. When
trying to show it to a visitor I found two more young hatched which
were reared and flew and although their tails were half-grown were
still entirely dependent on their parents. They thrived apace whilst

A. Silver--Breeding of White's Warbling Finch
I was away, but on reaching home after a journey to my regret I found
two more young hatched and predicted trouble. The parents as expected
switched off their attentions to the latest arrivals, and a drop in the
temperature to almost a frost killed the two very fine young birds
which were unable to feed themselves. They proved to be male and
female and were sent to South Kensington.
The surviving bird, a female, is now in adult plumage as I write
on 7th October, and I have had to discourage further nesting on the
part of the parents. The nestlings are streaked on the chest, a character
absent in the adult birds of both sexes. A brief description comprises
the following particulars :--Above from bill to rump, dark blackish
brown. Tail black, with three outer feathers white at the tips, extending
down the feather farthest on the outer re trices. Wings like the back.
Throat dirty whitish, flanks drab brown. Chest drab brown, but
with broad smoky streaks. Abdomen and middle of belly dirty white.
Bill black, lower mandible lighter beneath. Legs light leaden brown.
Eyebrow streak dirty white, narrower, and not so conspicuous as in
the adults.
The old male is a handsome plain coloured bird, the broad white
eyebrow and chestnut ear-coverts contrasting with the dark slaty grey
upper parts, and the maroon underparts are conspicuous against the
pure white of the breast and abdomen. The female differs from the
male in being duller, paler, and generally browner. See B.M.C.,
Vol. XII, p. 641.
The nest was a deep cup, very like that of a Whitethroat, and
when removed after being used three times was quite clean. The
old birds always removed excreta and flew as far as possible from
the nest to drop it. On four occasions two eggs only were laid. Whether
this is a characteristic of the species I do not know. The male bird
sang from time to time a " chipping " song with a little twist at the
end, and when a Shamah lived temporarily next door tilted its tail and
was quite ready to do battle with him.
The Pretty Warbling Finches became unfriendly with the Green-
finches (which reared two young) and were removed to another
enclosure. The male fed the female with living food, she fluttering
her wings like a nestling, but she rapidly developed what I believed to

The range of Poospiza includes Brazil, Peru, Bolivia to Mendoza,
N. Patagonia and other parts of South America. There are about
fourteen species, and White's is most like P. csesar, but much smaller.
Another little South American bird appeared on the market this
autumn, Lophospingus pusillus, the Black-crested Finch, two of which
I obtained.

THE SUCCESSFUL BREEDING OF THE
HAMMERHEAD AND THE BOAT-BILLED
NIGHT HERON IN THE BERLIN ZOO
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991832130434783" page_id="56318829"  page_num="101" year="" vol="">
By Dr. Georg Steinbacher, Zoologischer Garten, Berlin.
In the year 1937 two interesting relatives of our Herons and Storks,
the Hammerheads and the Boat-billed Night Herons, hatched in the
Berlin Zoo. Both of them are kept in large flying cages. The Boat-
billed Night Herons, of which there are four, have been here since
the beginning of the year 1934. In 1936 they had already tried to build
nests. One pair then had two eggs, which, however, were not laid in
a nest but on the floor of the cage, where they rolled about and were
broken.
In 1937 both pairs built nests about two metres high, close below
the wire ceiling of the cage. On the 25th June one pair had two eggs
and began sitting on them. Strange to say, this particular pair was
not in full adult plumage.
On the 20th July we noticed two young ones. The elder of them
seemed to be about four days old. Thus the Hammerheads seem to
sit for a bit longer than three weeks, about as long a time as the Night
Herons. On the very first day we saw the young ones, they begged with
a distinctly audible cry similar to that of a Heron.
On the 6th August both of them already stood on the nest. When
I entered the cage and approached them, they snapped at me and also
uttered a cry of defiance. At first the young ones were continually
watched by a parent, which brooded them. When somebody entered
the cage, the other parent also joined it to defend the nest. The bird,

which at that moment covered the young ones, adopted a characteristic
attitude of defence, spreading its wings and lowering its body. It
erected the elongated feathers of its occiput and snapped at the
intruder.
At five weeks old the young ones for the first time left the nest.
At first they climbed about on the branches near it, then they fluttered
from branch to branch and at last went on the soil of the cage. The
juvenile dress is similar to that of the two and three years old Boat-
billed Night Herons. Back, wings, and tail are brown, the top of the
head black, while elongated feathers of the hind head, neck, and under-
side are light brown. The bill of the young ones from the first day
is broadened in a way characteristic of this species.
Extremely remarkable with these birds is their being typical night
birds. Already their extraordinarily large eyes prove that. They
only become lively in the evening. Then they like to wade about in
the water seeking for their prey like Herons. Silent during the day,
they are very noisy in the evening, especially in the pairing season.
When they are displaying one of the birds runs towards the other
while holding its body in an horizontal attitude, stretching out its
neck and erecting the elongated feathers of its occiput, rattling with
its bill and cawing aloud. The other bird either takes up the same
position, then both run by the side of each other or around each other.
Or the other bird arises to its full height and caws. As there was no
certain way of discerning the sexes, I cannot tell which was the male
and which the female.
When the Boat-billed Night Herons came into the Berlin Zoo,
they lived almost entirely on horsemeat chopped into narrow strips.
Later on they got accustomed to eat fish, on which they now live
entirely.
The Hammerheads, too, have been in the Zoological Gardens of
Berlin since 1934. In 1936 they built two nests on an artificial base,
but which fell down. They were more successful in 1937. At first they
erected a nest, which they did not use for breeding, but pulled down
again. Then they built a nest of dry sticks on the branch of an artificial
tree directly near the trunk. It weighed 64 kilograms when finished.
In erecting it, they at first built a base of wet materials and on that a

platform of dry sticks. Then they erected a nest wall around it, which
they shut up like a dome. They left open a hole, which they formed like
a pipe and used as entrance to the nest. This nest was begun on the
16th May and already contained five eggs on the 19th June. The
bird sitting on the eggs continued in building the nest.
Strange to say, the Hammerheads used neither earth nor clay
nor similar materials which they use for building their nests in liberty.
When one bird was sitting on the eggs, it always began to cry weer weer
when the other sat down on the top of the nest for building it. On
the 16th July I found some young ones in the nest, aged about four
days. On the 24th their feathers were already in quills like those of
young Herons. These quills later on stuck to the tops of the feathers
for quite a long time. One parent at first always stayed with the
young ones, later on but rarely. Before the young ones left the nest,
the parents only entered it when they wanted to feed them. On the
3rd September, that was at the age of seven to eight weeks, the first
young Hammerhead appeared outside the nest for several hours.
It only reappeared on the 6th September. On the 7th it was accom-
panied by a second. From this day onward the young ones stayed
outside the nest all day long, but went into it for sleeping. From the
first moment the young ones left the nest they were extremely
independent. They were very clever at flying. They easily flew into
the narrow entrance of the nest. As soon as they left the nest, they
no longer were fed by the parents but fed wholly independently. Their
feathers were very much like those of the old ones, only a bit smaller.
The elongated feathers of the occiput were broader than those of the
old ones. They were easily distinguished by their bright yellow eyes,
while the eye of the old ones has a dark brown iris. The Hammerheads
have not many different cries. The usual call-note is weer weer.
A sharp " wit wit " is heard as a sign of fear or anger when a strange
bird perches on the nest. The food of the Hammerheads consists of
meal-worms and earth-worms, minced heart, minced meat, and soft
food, which contains shrimps, raw and crushed meat, boiled rice, and
some cut up shrimps and over which some ants' chrysalises are
strewn.

the nesting operations of most of the early breeding species of
Waterfowl; some did not nest at all. Consequently the number and
variety of birds reared this season did not come up to expectations.
We propose to say nothing about the commoner varieties which
nested but to mention only those which are of greater interest on account
of their rarity or reluctance to breed.
For three years we have had in our possession a pair of North
American Ruddy Duck. This species belongs to the race of Stiff-tailed,
or Spine-tailed Duck, like the Maccoa of South Africa. It is essentially
a diving Duck ; the feet are large, and the legs set so far back that it
can only shuffle about on land. It is rotund in shape and about two-
thirds the size of a Tufted Duck.
In full plumage the male has a Cambridge-blue bill. The nape of
the head is black and over each eye are brows raised slightly above the
crown level of the head, something like those on a toad. The cheeks
are white and the general colour of the body is brick red. The tail
feathers are long, stiff, and black. Under the tail is a small white
patch.
The display of the North American Ruddy Duck is peculiar. Holding
the tail erect and slightly spread, the head is bobbed up and down with
increasing rapidity. As the speed is increased, the up and down move-
ment is decreased, and finally the bill is pressed into the chest, air is
ejected, and this causes water to foam round the bird's breast. The head
is then thrust forward and a soft croak uttered. The head movements
may be likened to those of a ping-pong ball dropped vertically and
allowed to bounce until it comes to rest. This display is repeated
many times. A slight disturbance among other birds on the lake or the
approach of a dog will cause the bird to perform.
This pair of North American Ruddy Ducks bred here in 1936 and
again this year. The nest is always placed near the water's edge. Rushes,
or fork of tree roots close to the brink are favourite sites. The Duck

begins her clutch, which averages eight or nine, about the middle of
May. She is a determined breeder and will lay as many as four clutches
if her former nests are robbed. For so small a bird the eggs are astound-
ingly large, exceeding those of the Mallard in size. The texture of the
shell is rough to the touch. In colour it is very pale green, so pale as
to seem almost white. Incubation covers a period of twenty-five days.
The ducklings are easy to rear and take readily to biscuit meal and
duckweed.
Two years ago we imported a number of Hottentot Teal which were
turned out on the lakes. These tiny Duck--perhaps the smallest known
species--have proved hardy and easy to keep. They require no artificial
warmth or shelter and ice, snow, and east winds have no effect upon
them. Two pairs nested this year, at the end of July. In each instance
one clutch only was laid. The nests were placed in thick cover which
grows on the water's edge. One contained three eggs and the other eight.
Incubation took tw'enty-three days. Fertility was good and the duck-
lings were easily reared, requiring no special treatment.
Until a few years ago the Versicolor Teal was difficult to procure
and the records of its breeding in captivity were very few. Recently
a number of pairs have been imported and now they may be seen
in most of the larger collections of Waterfowl both in England and on
the Continent. It appears from our own experience and from the
information we have received concerning this species, that it is quite
a free breeder. Two pairs have bred with us this year and the young
were reared without difficulty.
Barrow's Golden-eye are not often seen in Waterfowl collections.
This is a pity. They are easy to keep and need no special attention.
Furthermore, hand-reared specimens are easily obtainable at the present
time at a reasonable figure. Though we have not formerly bred this
species, Barrow's Golden-eye nested here this season. The nest was
placed on the ground inside a hollow willow tree and six eggs were
laid. Fertility was good.
We know of no records of Smews having been kept in captivity.
We find them the easiest of the Sawbills to maintain in perfect condition.
They will find their own food if given a good range ; if not, they will
thrive on small strips of beef and biscuit meal. Last year, and again

The Curator--Waterfowl at Walcot
this year, one pair has bred at Walcot. In 1936 the nest was placed
under the rotting roots of an old oak. In that year six eggs were laid:
all were fertile and five young were reared. This year the nest was placed
about 2 feet down a rabbit hole on an island. There were seven eggs 1
in the clutch but they were all infertile.
The Chinese Goose is common enough in a domesticated form but
a true wild specimen of this species is a very different bird to look at.
We have one pair here, which nested for the first time this year. The
nest was built in a reed bed by the side of the lake. Three eggs were
laid and all hatched. The goslings are easily reared.
Ross's Snow Geese have bred with us for several years. Formerly
we have had one clutch per bird only, this year two Geese produced two
clutches each. Like most goslings, Ross's are easy to rear.
In February, 1936, we imported from Holland seven Yellow-billed
Bean Geese. They were all wild-caught specimens and had only been
in captivity about a fortnight when we received them. In April that
year, much to our surprise, we found one sitting. On examining the
nest we found it to be one forsaken by a Canadian Goose. The Bean
Goose had taken charge of this nest, " downed " it, and commenced
to sit. Possibly she had laid elsewhere and her eggs had been taken
by vermin.
This year three of these Bean Geese nested. One nest contained ten
eggs--these must have been the property of two Geese--the other
contained four. Unfortunately none of these eggs hatched.
As a rule wild-caught Geese rarely breed until they have been in
captivity ten years or more. These instances are, therefore, worth
recording.
Whooper Swans, on account of their size and doubtful tempers,
are not commonly kept. We have one pair, which were caught wild
six or seven years ago. They nested in April of this year for the first
time. Unfortunately the female got out of her enclosure during the
incubation period, and as there was some danger of her six eggs becoming
chilled before she could be put back these were taken away and placed
under hens. Five hatched. Hens are not satisfactory foster-mothers
for large cygnets and in consequence all except one contracted pneu-
monia and died. The bird which was reared is a fine specimen.

My aviary tenants are principally of the Australian Parrot family,
among which are Cockatoos, Galahs, Kings, Rainbows, Crimson-
wings, Stanleys, Red Rumps, Pennants, Hoodeds, Turquoisines,
Cockatiels, and, of course, Budgerigars.
Nesting began early in August, but with most pairs did not reach
the state of eggs. The first to produce eggs was the Rainbow, which
nested in a barrel with no nesting material, and laid on 14th August.
The second egg was laid two days later. One young hatched on 6th
September, but the other egg failed to hatch. The young one died
at ten days, due, in my opinion, to leaving the unhatched egg in the
nest. This the parent birds tried to remove, and the breaking of the
very stale egg in the nest, covering the young with its contents, was
probably the cause of its death, as the parents fed well and the young
bird's crop was well-filled when it died. The pair nested again in
another barrel, laying on 16th October. Both eggs this time were
thin-shelled and failed to stand up to bare nest conditions.
The Galahs had been making nests and tearing them to pieces for
weeks, when one pair settled down and laid on 21st August. Three
eggs were laid on alternate days. One was broken in the nest, one
young hatched on 16th September, and one on 20th September. This
last was a weakling, which I destroyed. The other chick did well,
and left the nest on 7th November--a strong bird, but here I nearly
lost it, as the parents immediately started rebuilding, and neglected
to teed it. It was practically starved in three days, so I took it away
and hand-reared it. It is now a spoilt pet of the house. This pair
nested again on two eggs in the same nest box, both eggs hatching on
17th December and the birds doing well. Another pair of Galahs
produced four eggs--all infertile. Another pair nested and laid on 21st
September, the second egg on 24th September. They did not sit for
several days. One young hatched on 19th October and the other on
20th October. Both were strong chicks and did well, the first leaving
the nest on 6th December, the other two days later. They were a

beautiful pair of youngsters, able to fly almost as well as the parents
the day they left the nest.
A pair of Crimson Wings nested on the floor of their house early in
October, laying one egg and two days later a soft-shelled egg in the
flight. The hen died two days later. I gave the cock Crimson Wing a
Fiji King hen for a mate. They produced two infertile eggs.
One pair of Cockatiels reared two young from three eggs and are
nesting again on four eggs.. A second pair laid but did not sit.
A cock Red Rump and hen Indian Plum-head mating produced
three infertile eggs.
The Stanleys appeared anxious to nest, as also did a Red Rump
and Hooded mating, but I am afraid I was at fault, having other pairs
in the same flight.
With regard to nesting places, I do not think the kind of nest would
have much influence, my opinion being that, if the birds are in condition
and humour for breeding, they will take on almost any kind of nest.
The Cockatiels had a box with half a husk in the bottom. The Plum-
heads took charge of a large coco-nut husk, the Fiji King and the
Rainbow selected a barrel and the Galahs appeared to be the least
particular. The first pair nested in a box about two feet deep, with a
hole near the top. They chewed through and came out the bottom
several times. The last bottom I replaced I shaped in the form of a
nest. They then decided to carry all the chips back and make a nest
of them. They built up about six inches deep of wood chips and
shavings, adding leaves of the gum tree up till the time the young left
the nest. Their second nest was the same box, with the old nesting
material undisturbed.
Another G-alah used a barrel with no nesting material. After
several days, to prevent the eggs rolling about, I built up with shavings
and gum leaves, and they carried on quite unconcerned. With reference
to feeding the Galahs, up to the time of nesting they did well on ordinary
parrot mixture. After they started nesting, I gave them a choice of a
large selection of various seeds. Of these, they favoured in the following
order :--sunflower, whole maize, special white millet, peanuts&apos; in the
shell, Spanish Canary, wheat, and hemp. In addition, they were
supplied with large quantities of seeding grasses and seed heads of

thistle. This latter was consumed in extraordinary quantity. I was
rather worried over soft food for them when they were feeding the
young, and tried boiled maize, wheat, peas, rice, etc. They would have
nothing to do with it, but did use a small quantity of the honey mixture
as used for Rainbow Lories.
It is interesting to note that, before nesting, the Galahs very seldom
touched maize, yet it was used in large quantities for feeding the
young, only the soft or germ end of the grain being eaten. White
millet was well-favoured, but other millets were left untouched. I was
puzzled for some time on seeing the birds digging up the earth in their
flight, and could not make out for what they were searching. I thought
it might be grass roots, and was surprised to see the hen Galah take
up an ordinary earth-worm. I then tried them with mealworms, but
they would have nothing to do with them. I then kept up their supply
of earth-worms from clean, cultivated soil.
I think the young Galahs for the first two weeks are about the
ugliest chicks one could see and their nest about the dirtiest, requiring
cleaning out almost daily. Possibly the nest condition was due to the
large amount of thistle head eaten.
The young birds are slow in feathering, pin feathers appearing on
wings and head at fourteen days. The pin feathers break at twenty-
two days and develop quickly after this. The eyes start to open at
ten days, and are full open at fourteen days. The parent birds did
not appear to resent the interference with their nests.

SUMMARY OF BREEDING RESULTS IN SOUTH AUSTRALIA
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.984121" page_id="56318837"  page_num="109" year="" vol="">
Having read with pleasure some very interesting breed summaries
by two or three enthusiastic English fanciers on foreign Finches and
Waxbills, I decided to record some of my successes for the breeding
season ending 30th June last.
I first opened up my account by breeding the common African
Fire Finch (Lagonostica senegala). Although these are quite common,
I know of many birds easier to breed. These tiny Finches had the
nasty habit (at least the cock bird had) of gathering up the offspring

one by one, usually when a few days old, and placing them at the far
end of the aviary in a heap where, if not seen in time, the ants would
quickly kill them. I believe this procedure is adopted by most Finches
and Waxbills from time to time, and that incorrect feeding or inter-
ference with their nests is usually the trouble. However, I finally
reared two birds which turned out to be hens. These are now about
fifteen months old.
The next species I concentrated on was the Scaly Crowned Weaver
(Sporopipes squamifrons), habitat Africa, sometimes called Moustache
Finch. To-day, this bird is more of a rarity, as are most of the South
African Finches. The markings on the head are black and grey,
resembling scales. It also has a black throat with markings not unlike
a drooping moustache, hence this bird's two names. I do not know
if this bird has been bred in England, but I should imagine so, as I
have found them most prolific. In each case they nested in logs.
Their eggs are pale green, heavily speckled with brown. The most
remarkable nest I had from this species was of six eggs and six
youngsters raised. Altogether, I reared fourteen young, and eventually
disposed of the entire family, as I wanted room for new species. They
have very little to recommend them as to colour, although they are
uncommonly marked. They are very active birds, being extremely
noisy and, incidentally, quarrelsome.
The Giant Magpie (Amauresthes Fringilloides), habitat Africa, is
another variety which have done well for me this year, having bred
eight young to date, and the parents still nesting. These also have very
little to recommend them as to colour, and they have, of course, no
song. Their courting dance is most peculiar. With his elongated
neck, the cock bird vibrates his beak in such a manner as to put me
in mind of a snake darting his tongue (readers may think my imagina-
tion a trifle vivid). A Fringilloides lays four white eggs, and I consider
them reasonably prolific and extremely hardy. The oldest of my
young birds is nearly twelve months.
The White-headed Mannikin ( Munia maja). This common but
attractive little bird is so well known that description is unnecessary.
Incidentally, I consider this species one of the hardest :o breed. Con-
sidering the thousands that are sold, very few indeed are bred. I was

fortunate in inducing a pair I had to breed after having had them
eighteen months or so. I believe the greatest difficulty in breeding
Munia maja is on account of their extreme timidity. I only succeeded
in raising one young.
The Painted Finch (. Emhlema picta). I had wonderful results with
these until the late summer, having bred thirty birds of this extremely
rare species. The majority had moulted out into full colour when
some of the younger ones started dying. At first I thought it was
due to their moulting, but unfortunately awakened to the true facts
too late, when full-coloured birds started dying at an alarming rate.
After isolating the birds and doing everything possible in the way
of tonics, and keeping the birds in a hospital cage at 80* (incidentally
not saving a single sick one) I finished up losing approximately twenty
birds. I understand the disease was enteritis. However, these things
are sent to try us, and I hope to gain by that experience this year.
I have one marvellous pair that have been breeding continuously since
last September, excepting for about two or three weeks, when they went
into a short moult. It will be twelve months in a week or two
since they started. This is no doubt an outstanding performance.
Dufresne's Waxbill ( Coccopygia dufresnii). I succeeded in raising
four youngsters of this beautiful little bird some months back and,
by the look of things, I do not think it will be long before they will
be building again.
I was fortunate in securing our South Australian Society's breeders'
medal for all the above species bred this year, so on the whole I am
very satisfied with the season's results, and only hope the coming
one will be as good.
I have tried time and again with the Melba Finch ( Pytelia melby),
but in vain. One pair have had seven nests, and in the majority of
cases the young die in the shell. I have always encouraged them to
build under cover and this may have been the trouble, as they may
not have obtained enough moisture. On one occasion, in a different
aviary, they nested outside in a bush and raised one young to a fortnight
old, but unfortunately threw it out. I have now turned this pair into
a garden aviary, where they have nested again, so I hope for better
results this time.

I have a few nice specimens of the beautiful Fire-tail Finch ( Zoena -
ginthus bellus), which I have had for some months. These birds usually
start breeding from September onwards. I recently received a few
nice birds, including Peters Spotted Finches, Black-throated Cardinals,
Bed-faced Waxbills (Pytelia afra), Pileated, Nonpareil, and Indigo
Buntings, etc., so will have some new species to concentrate on this
coming season.

BREEDING OF THE DUFRESNE WAXBILL
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99798456" page_id="56318840"  page_num="112" year="" vol="">
Having successfully bred the Dufresne Waxbill (Coccopygia dufresnii ),
habitat South Africa, just recently, I will give a few notes on this specie
which I trust will be of interest.
Securing two pairs of these delightful little Waxbills a little over
twelve months ago, I released them in a selected breeding aviary, where
one pair soon started to build. These were my rarest Waxbills at that
time, and I might say my optimism ran riot. However, my hopes were
soon settled when it turned out to be only a sleeping nest, as did several
others which they built at different times last season. They proved
to be energetic nest builders, but that was all. I had the misfortune
of losing one of the hens, so this left me with only one true pair. It was
about this time, I believe, that restrictions on South African birds were
enforced, so I was unable to procure any more.
During the breeding season this year, I erected a new breeding
.aviary, and in one compartment established a nice swath of grass. In
this house I placed the Dufresnes together with some Fire Finches.
I had not long to wait before the Little Waxbills were building. They
selected a small nest box high up in their sleeping quarters and all went
well until their approximate hatching date. This was in the latter part
of February, when a good old Australian heat-wave set in, the mercury
soaring up to somewhere in the vicinity of 107* in the shade. Knowing
that something was wrong at this stage, I inspected the nest and found
one chick just hatched, dead, and three eggs in which the young were
dead. Although disappointing, this was not surprising under the
*circumstances.

Breeding Notes from New Zealand and Australia 113
In a little over a week, the cock started building again, choosing the
same nesting site. A strong, oval-shaped nest was constructed and
lined with feathers. The first of four pure white eggs was laid on 17th
March, the hatching period occupying fourteen days. Twenty-two days
later, when feeding up, I apparently disturbed the clutch, as four young
birds flew from the nest--if I said fell from the nest it would be nearer
the mark. Apparently they left home two days too soon. I think their
parents held the same view, as they literally flew around me like a pack
of mosquitoes. It was most interesting to watch the old birds enticing
their youngsters back to their elevated nest. On the opposite wall were
.a few gum branches and extending from the top of these, a perch
reaching to their nest. Using the branches as a ladder, they gradually
coaxed their family up a few inches at a time and eventually got them
home. Two or three days later the young birds were quite strong on
the wing. The colouring of the young Dufresnes is similar to an adult
hen, head and nape leaden grey, eyes brownish black, beak all black
but with the lower mandible changing to crimson approximately four
weeks after leaving the nest. Two phosphorescent spots are on each
;side at the base of the beak, the back and wing coverts olive-green,
primaries and secondaries grey edged with green, and the upper tail
*coverts green tinged with red. The rump is red, the tail black, the
throat, breast, and underparts very light grey and the legs greyish-
black.
Inside of twelve days the young were independent, and the cock
bird in that time had built again. Incidentally, this nest was spoilt
by the young birds, who constantly disturbed the hen whilst sitting.
At that time I was dubious about separating the youngsters, not
knowing they were independent.
The food supply consisted of seeding grasses, soaked seed, and
.a little live food, together with the usual dry seeds.
I think the Dufresnes must be the most affectionate of the Wax-
bills, especially the cock bird, who has the untiring habit of preening
the head and nape feathers of his lawful spouse, until she becomes
practically featherless on those regions, presenting a most comical
appearance. With my previous pair, although they had a large flight
.aviary, the hen was soon in the same condition.

I believe this specie was bred for the first time in England or
Europe some few months ago ; it is therefore mainly my idea in
recording the above achievement to show that members over this
side of the world are also actively engaged in breeding the rarest
Waxbills.

Too often, only successes are mentioned in the Magazine, and we
draw a discreet veil of silence over our failures. As much profit,
however, can be derived from failures as from successes. If you do
not make mistakes, you will not learn. The crime is in making the
same mistake twice.
Bourkes Parakeets. --This year, none were actually reared to
maturity, several nests, from memory two, of youngsters being pro-
duced two and three at a time, but they all very poorly. They left
the nest in most cases, but did not attain that degree of vigour that
one would expect. Information gathered elsewhere, however, indicates
that the slight degree of relationship that there was between the
parent birds was probably the real reason for the weakness of the
young. Any suspicion of inbreeding with Bourkes Parakeets seems
to sentence the young ones to an early death.
Black-crested Sibia.-- These are rich, chestnut-coloured birds,
with black heads and long, black crests, about half as big again as a
Shama. They are natives of India. A pair were brought back in
1935, and liberated in a small aviary all to themselves. In the summer
of 1936, a nest very similar to that of a thrush was built in a small-leaf
privet tree. Two eggs of a pale green shade with on them a few brown
spots were laid. Then--tragedy. The hen bird was found dead, in
perfect condition and with no sign of attack from cats or outside vermin,
and I w r as keenly disappointed, so much so that I did not conduct a post
mortem. To have been so near and yet so far, to have selected these
birds in London, to have transported them, acclimatized them, to have
got them to go to nest--and with this result! There is only one thing
for it--try again.

Royal Starlings. --A case of interference with Nature. In 1935
they wanted to go to nest in the very early spring, when we were
still getting exceptionally cold mornings. Having some fears of the
possibility of egg binding, I withheld the white feathers, which they
prefer for a nest. The weather improved after a few weeks, and the
birds then ignored the nesting material provided and went into a
partial moult and, during the whole of that spring and summer, made
no serious attempt at nest building, let alone at breeding. In 1936,
I let them have their own way and, when the hen in the springtime
started carrying a little nesting material, she was immediately given
her white fowl feathers. She went to nest and reared a splendid young
one which is now flying round the aviary. It is, I believe, a cock bird.
Mexican Blue Jay. --Nature apparently determines that the hen
birds should lay eggs, but she was determined that, in spite of
eggs being laid, she did not approve of any of the nesting material
provided, nor was she prepared to use the nesting site in the aviary.
A 56-lb. butter box did not appeal in the slightest, nor did a heap of
twigs laid all ready on top of the box. The hen persistently sat on the
seed tray, but refused to lay there and ignored some twigs that were
provided to induce her to nest even in that unsatisfactory position.
Ultimately, the cock bird was loaned to another aviculturist who had a
hen bird only who had selected a nesting site, but what the ultimate
result was, I do not know.

It has always been a source of wonderment to myself that so little
should be written about the Wader. W. H. Workman's article in the
March issue of the Magazine has tempted me to dilate somewhat on
the subject, while the last paragraph inspires me to make an offer.
In general, the Wader is a most admirable aviary bird. Their feeding
is simple, they quickly take to aviary life, are peaceful with each other,
and can be kept with a collection of British Finches and Foreign
Waxbills. The action or movement of the Plover family would charm

a person who was indifferent to birds. Each species has its own
individuality. The Ruff is playful and the Oyster Catcher is the clown.
A pair I have will dig for worms, and seem to laugh each time one is
found. If worms are supplied by one of us, the Oyster Catcher will
run to the pond with each one separately, and thoroughly wash the
worms before eating them ; they seem to think the worms they find
for themselves do not need washing. It is entertaining to see the
Oyster Catchers extract a snail from its shell, and then break the shell,
so nothing may be wasted. They are also fond of the periwinkle, supplied
by the fishmonger: these they extract from the shell--they do not
use a pin either--and nothing is wasted.
I have a pair of Ruffs and one Oyster Catcher to spare, imported,
ideal aviary birds, moulted in captivity. I will be pleased to give them
to a member of the Avicultural Society, if applicant can offer suitable
accommodation with regard to space and pond. Please apply by
letter. I find it most difficult to get complete data with regard to
Waders, unless such birds can be obtained in captivity.
I hope to hand the gift birds to an applicant in the vicinity of Kent,
to ensure comfortable transit. I can recommend the family of Waders
to any interested fancier or student who can comfortably accommodate
them.
All the Waders are unique aviary birds, they are interesting and
decorative. The latter remark applies especially to the Ring Plover

By N. Wharton-Tigar
In attempting to write this month on some of the waterfowl at
the London Zoo, I feel very much out of my depth, my knowledge
of these birds being very elementary. I quickly enlisted the help of
my young friend Mr. Terry Jones, an enthusiast on the subject. On
a very cold day, with a biting wind, we met at the Zoo and carefully

examined each species. I made notes with my numbed fingers, which
I am now scarcely able to decipher ! However, Mr. Jones is very
thorough, and wrote me out a list of the whole collection of the three
kinds I had decided to write about, namely, Swans, Geese, and Ducks.
Besides which, he lent me his copy of Mr. J. C. Laidley's book, The
Care and Propagation of Ornamental Waterfowl , and, as I see it has a
preface by Mr. Seth-Smith, I feel every confidence in quoting from it.
To begin with the Swans--the handsome Black Swan ( Chenopsis
atrata ) from Australia, with its red bill and the inner feathers of the
wings curled and raised. The Black-necked Cygnus melanocoryphus,
a native of South America, has a neck which is blackish-brown, the
bill is bluish-grey, and a large red wattle, the body is white. Both
these species are not too good-tempered, and will occasionally kill
young Duck. The Zoo have also one Whooper Swan ( Cygnus cygnus ),
and one Bewick [Cygnus hewicki), the former breed mainly in the
Arctic Circle and sparingly in Scotland, and the latter in Arctic Eastern
Europe. I should have taken the two for a pair, but the difference in
the bill was pointed out to me, and Mr. Seth-Smith told me how the
Zoo came to acquire the Bewick. He was watching some Swans on
a lake in Surrey, when he noticed among them a young Bewick, still
in immature plumage. This was interesting, as they are seldom
found as far south, and he asked the keeper to try and catch it. This
was done, and Mr. Seth-Smith brought it to the Gardens.
I think the three species of Geese are all interesting. First, the
Red-breasted, recently acquired from Moscow, is an exceedingly
beautifully coloured bird, black, white, and rich chestnut--a true
Goose, bill very short, and cobby in shape. Mr. Peter Scott, well
known as an artist, has gone to the northern shores of the Caspian
Sea, where the species winters, to bring home, if possible, live specimens
of this lovely Goose. The Red-breasted has seldom nested in captivity,
though some wild caught birds did so fifteen years after their
arrival at Woburn Abbey. It has been found in ancient Egyptian
paintings. The Semi-palmated Goose (Anseranas semipalmata ) is a
handsome bird, if a little ungainly. It is a native of Australia, and has
orange legs and feet, a Duck-like bill ; the body is black and white.
The bird perches a good deal, and does not look very much like a Goose.

N. Wharton-Tigar--London Zoo Notes
The Abyssinian Blue-winged Goose ( Cyanochen cyanopterus ) from
north-east Africa, dull dun and buff shades, with slaty-blue shoulders
and green speculum. The Zoo have a pair of these. No doubt the
fact that they are said to be nocturnal accounts for the curious way j
they go about, looking very humped and ill at ease ; the female is a
little smaller and has a different call.
Among the Ducks, the South African Buddy Shelduck ( Casarca
cana) differs from the Common Shelduck chiefly in having a lavender
head and neck, neckband brown instead of black, eyes yellow. The
Australian Shelduck, Mr. Laidley describes the Drake of this species
" as one of the most handsome of all waterfowl. His head and neck
are black, with white collar at base of neck. The breast is yellowish-
chestnut, bill, legs, feet, flight feathers, and tail black ; the rest of
the bird being an iron-grey almost black finely pencilled with white 55 .
The Common Pintail [Anas acuta) are found throughout the
Northern Hemisphere, but the Bahama Pintail [Anas bahamensis)
is a native of tropical South America, the West Indies, and the Bahamas.
The American Wigeon [Anas americana) winters in the United States,
and breeds in north-west America. It is distinguished from the
common Wigeon by its vinous back and flanks, its head is pale grey
with black spots, with a white stripe on the crown and two bronzy-
green stripes from the eye to the nape. The Chiloe Wigeon ( Anas
sibilatrix) from South America is hardy and prolific, and, thanks to
its amusing habits and pretty plumage all the year round, may be
considered one of our most ornamental waterfowl (Mr. Delacour,
Aviculture , vol. ii).
The Common Pochard ( Nyroca farina), native of Europe and
southwards to India, the Tufted Pochard ( Nyroea fuligula) from the
same regions, and the Bed-crested Pochard ( Netta rufina), this is an
easy species to breed, and has the same distribution. The Bosy-billed
Pochard ( Metopiana peposaga) is a native of South America. The
Bed-billed Duck (Anas erythrorhyncha), native of Africa and Mada-
gascar, is rare in confinement.
The Zoo have two varieties of the Tree or Whistling Duck, the
Fulvous ( Dendrocygna fulva), a bird with a very wide distribution,
inhabiting parts of the old as well as the new world. The Black-billed

Tree Duck ( D . arborea ) is peculiar to the Antilles. It has been bred
by the late Mr. Blaauw and the Zoological Gardens of Cologne.
The Falcated Teal [Anas falcata) breeds in East Siberia, and
winters in China and Japan. I will give Mr. Delacour's description
of this species : " The Falcated Duck is one of the handsomest of
the genus. The drake in colour has a crest at the back of his head,
and his tertiary flight feathers are very long, slender, and curved in
hoops over his back. The colouring is silvery-grey vermiculated with
black, tail speculum and hoops are bronzed-green, edged with light
grey ; head, neck, and crest are green shot with purple, with a little
spot on the forehead ; the chin, throat, and a patch below the neck
are pure white." Also the Clucking or Baikal Teal (A. fortnosa), a
charming Siberian species which winters in China and Japan.
The Zoo has specimens of the well-known and frequently bred
Carolina and Mandarin Ducks, the former, A. sgonsa, from North
America, and the latter, A. galericulata, from China, Formosa, and
Japan. The Mandarin Drake in full colour is the most lovely and
amusing little creature ; the Carolina is almost equally so ; no wonder
they are so popular. Mr. Terry Jones tells me that one interesting
point about them is that they both nest in trees (in holes) high off the
ground. For the first day or so the ducklings of both species are
able to jump great heights, and their claws are very sharp to enable
them to climb out of hollow trees, from where they jump to the ground.
Their extreme lightness and flufliness enabling them to do so without
injury. In captivity they often try and climb out of the coop, and
sometimes manage to cling upside dowm on the roof. Should they
get out, they are as difficult to catch as a mouse !
Another very lovely little Duck is Barrow's Golden-eye ( Bucephala
clangula islandica), native of Arctic America, Iceland, and Greenland.
The drake has head and neck black glossed with bluish, the head is
crested and velvety ; altogether a striking little bird.
Lastly, there is at the Zoo a specimen of the curious and rare
Steamer Duck ( Tachyeres cinereus), Falkland Isles, very interesting,
but not exactly a thing of beauty. Mr. Seth-Smith tells me opinions
differ about this bird, many maintain there are two races, one which
can use its wings in flight, and the other to which the Zoo specimen

E. M. Story--When Memory Laughed
belongs, which when in a hurry flaps its wings, using them on the
water like paddles, hence its name, Steamer Duck. It is clad in grey,
with a laced effect, white round eye, olive-yellow beak, and feet very
heavily built. It might be described as the bulldog of the Duck world.
The Zoo collection is quite a good one, but not outstanding ; many
members of this Society have collections which are far larger and
more varied ; however, far-away readers may like to hear what varieties
are at the present time at Regent's Park. They are mostly housed
in the large pond which forms part of perhaps the prettiest portion
of the Gardens. On the left, coming from the North Entrance, are
the Birds of Prey aviaries, with the bedded-out stretch of garden in
front of them, very well done indeed, and a blaze of colour all spring,
summer, and autumn. The pond is surrounded by large trees, stretches
of grass, and beautiful flowering shrubs, and forms a cool and attractive
spot in the summer months. The Waterfowl look happy dipping in
and out of the water, and the Flamingoes add very much to the picture.
Of these I will write some other time.

The bird of blue--invisible---had fled,
Was due the crimson daw of woe complete,
And Memory sat her down in Mea Culpa seat,
Too sorrow-weighted to lift up her head
Lest she might see aloft the bird of red.
She heard the passage of the unseen wings
And circling round her felt forgotten things
Catching the mingled flash of blue and red.
The sun shone forth from out the cloud of gloom
Touching to brilliance things of darkest hue
Rippling the waters of Nepenthe's stream ;
And Memory watched the flowers aburst to bloom
And caught the blended tints of red and blue
And laughed, as fled her fears, chased by the beam.
The blue bird of happiness--Maeterlinck.
The crimson daw of misery--Cassidy.

By J. Delacour
In Dr. E. HopkinsoiTs interesting note on Macaws bred in confine-
ment there seems to have been some confusion between the English
and Latin names of two species : The Red and Yellow Macaw is
Ara macao, while the Red and Blue is Ara chloroptera. It is, therefore,
difficult for the reader of the note to find out which species is really
intended in the different records. The species breeding at Lilford is
the Red and Yellow ( Ara macao). Also the records should be com-
pleted by the mention of two beautiful hybrids, Blue and Yellow
(A. ararauna), Red and Blue (A. macao), now living in the Catalina
Island Bird Park, California, which I mentioned in last year&apos;s
Magazine (p. 138).

ORNAMENTAL PHEASANT SOCIETY NOTES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99968865" page_id="56318849"  page_num="121" year="" vol="">
The activities of the O.P.S. have naturally advertised the keeping
of Ornamental Pheasants in our aviaries, and this has led to one
result which is possibly not altogether desirable. In past years one
has heard of several dealers in England importing rare Pheasants
from India and the Far East, dealers on the Continent have done
likewise. This year there has been an unprecedented rush to import
Pheasants, quite regardless of being certain to find the birds suitable
homes. One wonders how many of the numbers that leave
India alive will reach European shores in reasonably good con-
dition. Has sufficient care been taken to ensure the comfort of the
birds on the voyage ? Were they in a fit condition to travel or were
they trapped and shipped before being kept in aviaries for purposes
of taming and bringing them back to a good travelling condition ?
Has the crating been properly attended to ? All these matters give
rise to serious thought. If Pheasants have been brought into first-
class condition before leaving the port of embarkation, fed in a proper
manner, and receive expert attention, then there is no reason to suppose
that many casualties will result. But are such precautions always
taken ? Is it not customary for Pheasants, and indeed, other birds,
to be packed in inadequately small crates and cages, fed in a haphazard

manner, and with most unsuitable food ? There is a magnificent
opportunity for our Society, and, I venture to say, the A.S., to insist
that all birds that are exported from their native climes should receive
expert attention both before embarkation and during the voyage. If it
is found that birds are arriving in bad condition owing to unsuitable
packing and food, then this should be reported to the proper authorities.
It is one of our principal aims to arrange for the propagation of rare
Pheasants in our aviaries and therefore it should be our first thought
to see that the birds arrive in good condition. I am not suggesting
for one moment that importers are aware of the shocking conditions
that at times exist. In this matter it should be possible to make it
compulsory for importers to take steps to arrange for proper treatment
and most certainly no one should be allowed to import any birds
without a licence. We hope that sufficient support will be forthcoming
to enable us to do something of real benefit to bird fanciers, and
therefore we appeal to all bird lovers to join our Society as well as

MR. L. C. WEBBER'S ARTICLE
Madam, -- I have never found in the whole series of the Avicultural
Magazine anything more astonishing than Mr. Leonard C. Webber's article
on the Blue-winged Parrot (Neophema chrysostoma), page 28 of the January,
1938, issue ; and it is still more surprising that the following number did not
contain the slightest reference to it from any experienced Parrakeet breeder.
In a very few words we are asked to believe in a most extraordinary
technique in Parrakeet breeding.
We are told that delicate Grass Parrakeet eggs produced a 65 per cent
hatching result after at least seven weeks' delay and probably much shaking
and rail trepidation on the long journey from Tasmania to Siberia.
From personal experience in importing Gamebird and Waterfowl eggs
from various countries, I may say that any delay over three weeks runs very

close to the limit of germination power, and that such eggs are practically
useless when incubation is started after four to six weeks.
Now the eggs of Waterfowl and Gallinaceous birds are comparatively
very " delay-proof ", as, in nature, incubation often does not begin before
the completion of a rather large clutch.
Thick-shelled or oily-shelled eggs (such as those of Guineafowl or the
Mallards) seem to be more resistant than porous ones, and we may also say
that the smaller the size of the egg, the more rapidly it loses its chances of
proper germination.
This is, perhaps, largely due to over-evaporation; the ratio " surface-
versus-volume " being the simplest geometrical explanation of it.
It is hard to believe that the minute and fragile eggs of Grass Parrakeets
would be unusually resistant to staleness and desiccation.
It is then reported that these Parrakeet eggs were placed in an incubator
with the above-mentioned success !
We must infer that, from their first day, the young were actually hand-
reared--and we are already aware of the skill required to hand-rear a baby
Budgerigar or even a larger Parrot.
Using other Parrakeets as foster-parents has, up to now, been generally
disappointing; the Budgerigars, especially, seem hopeless for rearing any
young Grass Parrakeets, and even the best hen Bourke's is generally useless
for any youngster of the " green " Grass Parrakeets.
It would, therefore, have been quite valuable to learn by what method the
prosperous stock of Siberian Blue-wings was actually started.
The extraordinary prolificacy of that stock--up to four nests per annum
with common clutches of eight!--seems to point to exceptionally skilful
management and the favour of a Siberian climate.
In Belgium we are not so happy, and we have to treat our Blue-wings
as semi-hardy birds. En resume, Professor KharklofFs reported achievements
are valueless for avicultural or scientific purposes while we have not more
complete and detailed information of the technique adopted by him.
His claim to have " fixed eight definite colours " among his stock of
Neophema chrysostoma in ten years must be substantiated by better references
and descriptions before being seriously considered--especially so because
we have not yet an authentic record of any established " sport " or mutation
in the Grass Parrakeet group.
Possibly the explanation of the whole thing will be found in some letter
written in Russian and incorrectly translated by the Tasmanian correspondent
of Mr. Webber. I should not like to hurt Mr. Webber's feelings by my apparent
scepticism, but, on the other hand, I foresee that, in going over our printed
records, the future aviculturists of half a century or so may get some queer
ideas from such articles about our avicultural methods of 1938.
I would suggest, also, that correspondents should be asked for fuller
information when such bald statements are submitted for publication in
our Magazine.

The Handbook of British Birds, Vol. I. By H. F. Witherby,
F. C. B. Jourdain, N. F. Ticehurst, B. W. Tucker. Published
by Messrs. H. and Gr. Witberby, Ltd. 25s.
It is really not possible to do justice to this monumental work in
the space at our disposal. Volume I takes us from Crows to Flycatchers,
minutely describing the plumage (male, female, and juvenile), voice,
food, breeding display, distribution in the United Kingdom and abroad,
habitat, field characters, and general habits, measurements and struc-
ture. It also contains thirty-three coloured plates, text-figures, and
maps showing the breeding range of certain species in the British Isles
and of others in Europe, and results obtained by ringing.
The present handbook is a lineal descendant of " A Handlist of
British Birds " much enlarged, and is the result of many requests for
a reprint of its immediate predecessor, " The Practical Handbook."
It is planned for quick and easy reference, each bird is treated in the
same way and the information is divided into sections. The introductory
notes and glossary of terms will be found very helpful, also the explana-
tory figures showing the correct method of measuring the different
parts of a bird, and the key to orders and sub-orders.
The coloured plates show the adult and juvenile plumage of both
sexes as well in summer as in winter colouring where these differ to
a marked degree. As a rule four kinds of birds are portrayed on one
plate, this looks rather crowded and the figures of the larger species
suffer in appearance.
In every other respect the book deserves all praise ; it is concise,
authoritative, and worthy of its distinguished compilers. It will be
completed in five volumes, and sold to subscribers to the whole set
at 21s. the volume, to others at 25s., and at either figure is marvellous
value.

Among the interesting collection at the London Zoo is a specimen
of this rare and peculiar ground Cuckoo from New Guinea.
The following is a description of an adult specimen.

to the feathers of the top of the head, neck, mantle, and chest. Bill
and legs black ; iris dirty white. Total length 18'5 inches; culmen,

The Zoo specimen came from Mannen Volcano, S.E. New Guinea.
This bird is distinguished from the Menebiki Ground Cuckoo by it
black bill and nearly straightened hind claw. A collector of the B.O.U.
and Wolleston Expeditions to Dutch New Guinea remarked on its
very skulking habits and it appeared to occur near the coast. It is
worthy of mention that John Gould, the well-known naturalist, did
not mention these birds in his book on the birds of New Guinea so
could not have known of their existence.

When visiting New Zealand the writer had the pleasure of hearing
some of the most delightful musical notes that have ever greeted
and gladdened the ear.
It was in a beautiful garden in Auckland, when the flax flowers
were in bloom that from the summit of the plants the Tuis sang,
inimitably. The song was composed of many and various musical notes
One leading expert gives as many as seventy variations. Its voice is
at its best in the happy breeding season.
Here is the account that Mr. W. R. B. Oliver, M.Sc., has of the bird,
which seems well worth quoting here and now:--The Tui
(.Prosthemadera nov&amp;seelandias) is one of the most characteristic birds
of the New Zealand forest, not so much of the gloomy interior as the
upper lighted portion and the outskirts. Its station is among the tree-
tops, where the flowers and fruit are borne. When journeying from
place to place it usually flies at a considerable height and descends
suddenly to its destination. Its flight is particularly noisy and when
darting through the forest, or pursuing one another, Tuis pass, like a
flash, and disappear among the trees with a sound that earned for them
among sealers the soubriquet of ' Breaksea Devils '. Breaksea being
one of the sounds resorted to by sealing gangs."
The Character of the Tui
There is nothing of timidity or cowardice in the nature of the
Tui. It is bold and courageous and rather pugnacious, and in
Mr. Oliver's opinion it may be these characteristics that have
challenged the Blackbirds and Starlings which have been known to
attack the Tuis in company, and the idea certainly seems practical
and altogether reasonable.
The Tuis may be said to " meet the winter by avoiding it ",
inasmuch as they often leave the forest and, flying far, settle in the

more residential districts where they feed on the flowers of introduced
trees such as the blue gum and the fuchsia. On Stewart Island the
birds leave the middle of the islands and make for the coasts, says
Mr. Guthrie-Smith. Here, by the coasts, they breed, in spring.
Some reader may ask " Why have you not yet given us a description
of the appearance of the Tui ? " The reply to that question must be
that it was judged desirable first to interest you in the bird's character
and vocal achievements to induce the inquiry as to its appearance
and habits.
The Appearance of the Tui
Under the brilliant light of a Hew Zealand sky on a fine day, the
general colour of the adult bird is a shining metallic green with bluish
purple reflections on the shoulders, upper tail coverts, and lower breast.
The hind neck is ornamented with filamentous plumes curving out-
wards and with a white line down the centre ; back and scapulars are
bronzy brown ; marginal coverts blackish purple ; central coverts
with outer portion white, forming a conspicuous wing bar ; quills
and tail-feathers are black on their inner webs. The abdomen and sides
are reddish brown. Two tufts of filamentous curled feathers, white,
ornament the throat. The bill and the feet are brownish black.
Caught in a favourable light the green, purple, white, and black,
enhanced by the several tints of brown may be seen in contiguity, and
the whole appearance thus presented is fascinating.
The iris is a dark brown.
The length of the Tui is approximately sixteen and a half inches,
with seven and a half inches to the wing ; one inch to the bill; six
and a half inches to the tail and one and a half inches to the tarsus.
When the Tui is immature its prevailing tint is a blackish brown,
the median wing coverts are white and the quills and tail feathers of
a metallic green.
Eggs
The eggs are very attractive, they are pinkish white with small
pink spots and blotches chiefly at the larger end, they are in clutches
of four.

Insects, nectar, and berries. When the berries are over and the
winter has yet some time to run insects form the bird's mainstay.
As a rule they are prodded out of the trees, but one ornithologist
(Waite) noted when at Auckland Islands that the Tuis were taking
insects on the wing.
The kinds of berries provided by the New Zealand forests are
extremely numerous. Perhaps the best known and the most con-
spicuous are those of the mahoe, coprosma, supple-jack, maire, mako,
and karaka.
The nectar-producing flowers are also in plentiful supply in the
lovely forests, and, amongst the favourites of the Tui, may be mentioned
as most conspicuous the rata, kowhai, rewarewa, and fuchsia, while
scrub and swamp provide enormous quantities of flax flowers
(Phormium). The soft spikes of the kiekie are also considered edible
by the Tui (so Buller).
In these days, when conscience is, perhaps, better awakened, the
Tui is protected by law from those who would eat its flesh or export
it for its skin, which formerly was used in millinery, many skins being
imported by London. The protection \0x25A0 by law of this beautiful bird
amply repays the favour, as its work, as a destroyer of insects
inimicable to plant life, including the blue-gum scale, and by its cross-
pollinating of forest trees, has rendered it a valuable practical
economist.
The Maoris and Tui
The Tui was domesticated by the Maori, who kept it in cages and
taught it to talk and to sing. No other bird was thus taught by the
Maoris. It is said that they trimmed the end of its tongue. The Tui
being imitative and a competent mimic easily produced all kinds
of noises and sounds, including pig-squealing (the Maoris kept many
pigs), the whistle of a shepherd for his dogs, and also the calls of many
birds. It sneezes, coughs, and gurgles and introduces such notes into
its musical songs. It would thus appear to have anticipated modern
music vagaries.

" When singing the Tui puffs out its plumage and with throat and
beak open and tongue slightly protruding, with much gesticula-
tion, pours out its song," says Mr. Oliver in his book on New Zealand
birds. The skins, after head, wings, and tail had been removed, were
dried in a cylindrical form and used by the Maori women as ear-
pendants.
THE VELVET SCOTER IN CAPTIVITY
By J. Delacour
In the early months of 1932 my friend, M. B. Homberg, sent me
two male Velvet Scoters (CEdemia fusca) from the sea shore near the
Somme estuary. He had been endeavouring for some time to procure
for me some of these interesting birds alive, by shooting them slightly
in the neck, at long range, with very small shot. Both birds arrived
in fairly good condition, but of course with rather stiff necks. One
survived only a few months, while the other one gradually improved,
and eventually recovered completely. Let out on the lake, the bird
soon became very tame and greedy, eating readily soaked dog biscuit,
bread, and even grain ; meat was never touched, but worms and
water insects no doubt somehow supplemented its diet.
Its picture was taken in 1936, after over four years in cap-
tivity and the Velvet Scoter looked perfect, till about a year ago,
when he began to show signs of old age ; the nail of its bill grew too
long, and we had to cut it; its general appearance became gradually
that of an aged bird. It died early this year.
I have never yet seen another Velvet Scoter in confinement, nor
heard of any having been kept in captivity for more than a few weeks.
Ours lived at Cleres just about six years.
A beautiful male Long-tailed Duck, caught and sent to me by
M. Homberg at the same time, and by the same method, is still in
perfect condition.
We also have a pair of Australian Sheldrakes (Casarca

great virtue of being much less spiteful and pugnacious than its
relatives. Unfortunately, this fine Duck does not seem inclined to
nest in Europe, and it has not yet been bred in captivity in our part
of the world nor in America.

All Australian birds fall for study into five various species. In
each species we find distinct beauties in the several individuals con-
stituting each class.
For the sake of convenience we will just run over the names of
the separate genera and the type of birds we may expect to find
distinguishing each :--

We shall here give one or two members of each genus some con-
sideration keeping in mind our title.
A fine example of the Raptores species is the Wedge-tailed Eagle
(Aquila audax). It is of the Falconidse family and is found all over
the southern portion of Australia. It also flourishes in Tasmania
and the larger islands of Bass's Straits. John Gould considers this bird
and the Golden Eagle " beautiful analogues of each other ". In its

slender wedge-shaped tail this lovely bird presents a far more elegant
contour than does the Golden Eagle.
Unlike India, Australia has no Vultures for the excellent reason
that she has no carcases of quadrupeds of huge size to clear away.
Professor Gould examined and described an example of the Wedge-
tailed Eagle, which weighed 9 lb. and measured 6 ft. 8 in. from
tip to tip of the opposite pinions. This was not by any means a
large-sized specimen ; if anything it may well have been a little under
the usual dimensions. The bird soars to a great height and performs
the most graceful evolutions and circles in the air. Its acute vision
enables it while thus soaring and circling to descry the retreats of its
future victims--the smaller species of kangaroo, dotted about the hills
and the plains inland. Nor is it content with small animals only.
It does not hesitate to swoop down and exert its powerful grasp on a
bird twice its own size--the Bustard.
Thirty or forty Eagles have been seen assembled together indulging
their appetites by gorging on a dead bullock. The Eagle prefers living
prey but as we have shown does not altogether refuse the carcases of
animals which are sometimes in a putrid condition. Its courage, power,
and rapacity are remarkable.
Nests .--The bird builds its nest on the highest trees ; none but
the aborigines being able to obtain them. The trees selected frequently
rise to a height of 100 feet before giving ofi a single branch. The nests
are very large, almost flat, and put together of sticks and small
boughs.
Eggs .---The eggs are about 3 inches long by 2 |broad, of stone-
colour, with large purple blotches and smaller blotches of " yellowish-
umber-brown The young birds suggest the colouring of fawn,
rusty red, and black.
Stock-owners and the shepherds they employ eagerly shoot the birds
whenever possible, to save their sheep and lambs, but in spite of
rewards offered the Wedge-tailed Eagle is scarcely likely to be
altogether exterminated while the vast and dense Australian forests
remain unpenetrated.
The next bird which we shall consider is the remarkable Queen
Victoria Lyre-bird, of the Order Insessores.

Order insessores. Family MENURioiE. Genus menura.
The Lyre-bird is, possibly, the most appropriate bird as an emblem
for Australia of its avifauna.
Its principal habitat is New South Wales and parts of Victoria.
The rough close thickets or brush near mountain or coast both afford
it shelter. The cedar bushes of the Liverpool Range and the mountains
of the Tumat Country are favourite haunts.
The Lyre-bird is very shy and consequently not at all easy to procure.
Travellers in the bush can hear the loud liquid calls of these birds for
days together and all that time never see a glimpse of one.
The birds choose inaccessible places--steep gullies or ravines,
disguised or covered by moss and creepers of great luxuriance and dense
trees. The slightest noise, a falling stone, a crackling stick, alarms
them.
After enduring patience and perseverance the Lyre-bird may some-
times be seen and occasionally captured. It is of a wandering disposi-
tion, as distinguished ornithologists testify, traversing the same brush
from one end to the other, from mountain-top to the bottom of the
gullies, whose steep and rugged sides present no obstacle to its long
legs and powerful muscular thighs ; it is also capable of performing
extraordinary leaps. " When running quickly through the brushes
they carry their tails horizontally." The tail is a very beautiful affair ;
it is the making of the bird. The upper coverts are tinged with a fine
rufous, shading to blackish brown toward the upper surface, while the
under surface is a silvery grey. Beautiful transparent cross bands of
colour decorate the tail.
In Victoria, Australia, the tail of the Lyre-bird differs from that
of the Lyre-bird of New South Wales which we have described, the
feathers being shorter and the bands stronger and broader. The
aborigines of Yarra Yarra name the bird " Bullan-Bullan ".
Nest .--Some naturalists state that the bird uses the same nest for
several years. The feathers lining it closely resemble in colour those
of the egg, so that it is not at all easy to descry the single egg amid the
closely resembling feathers.

<bodyText confidence="0.999288696969697" page_id="56318873"  page_num="133" year="" vol="">
The egg is of a purplish-grey tint with purple-brown blotches near
the larger end. It measures about 2J in. long by If in. broad.
The Young .--Almost without feathers, except for a few here and
there, notably on the throat. The skin is a yellowish-grey ; the beak
black, the feet dark, the claws grey, the eyelids closed.
Food. --The food consists for the most part of insects--centipedes
and beetles, and sometimes, when older, snails. When very young the
cry is a high sounding " tching, tching " ; but later a burbling, gurgling
note is given out which is not unlike the " Bullan-Bullan " which the
natives call the bird.
We now pass on to consider a representative of the Order of the
Basores, or Pigeons.
Order rasores. Family columbine. Genus ptilinopsus.
The members of the Columbidse family are found all over the globe.
They are particularly numerous in Australia where there are no less
than twenty species. Perhaps the simpler division for our purpose
is into great groups ; the one arboreal, the other terrestrial. That
of the trees has a more expansive gullet than that of the earth, and
broad hand-like feet which enable it to keep position on boughs and
sprays while gathering fruit.
Some of the most brilliantly coloured of the Columbidse family
are they of the genus Ptilinopus swainsonii, and they are particularly
numerous in Australia, New Guinea, the Moluccas, the Celebes, and
Polynesia.
One of them, known as Swainson's Fruit Pigeon, is found in great
numbers in Queensland amid the primeval forests of the Biver Clarence
district, as the brushes are the most congenial to its nature for breeding
and hiding.
The sexes are almost exactly alike in colouring. That famous
ornithologist, Gould, describes the appearance thus : Foreheads
and crowns deep crimson-red, surrounded, except in front, with a
narrowing of light yellow ;* back of the neck greyish-green ; all the
upper surface bright green, tinged with yellow, the green becoming

deep blue towards the extremities of the tertiaries, which are broadly
margined with yellow ; primaries slaty-grey on their inner webs and
green on the outer, very slightly margined with yellow ; tail feathers
deep green, largely tipped with rich yellow. The beautiful combina-
tion of vivid rich colours and delicate tints, produce a brilliant
effect.
The total length of this gay little bird is about 9 inches.
Food. --Figs, wild grapes, and palm-nuts which abound in the forests
(brush). The Pigeon, being an excellent judge, selects the best and
ripest fruit, so frequently to be found at the extreme end of the bough
or spray.
The Gallinacce, which are included in the Order has ores, are
represented but meagrely in Australia. The Turnices and Quails are
but poor substitutes for the gorgeous Peacocks, the Partridges and
Pheasants, Grouse, etc., of other lands. The Turnices and Quails are
probably distantly related to the Partridges, but the alliance is some-
what remote. We pass on at once to the Order grallatores, which
includes the Emu, the Cassowary, the Bustard, many varieties of
Plover, the Dotterels, the Sandpipers, the Stilts, the Snipes, the Curlews,
the Egrets, the Herons, and other beautiful birds of which many are
found in all parts of the world.
One of the most ornamental of the Grallatores is seen in the Wattled
Plover ( Lobivanellus lobatus).
It is a showy, attractive bird, somewhat fearless as it frequents
small ponds, near the dwellings of man. It is equally at home on
open flats, or high dry grounds. It is common in many parts of New
South Wales and Bass's Straits, particularly on Green Island in the
Straits. Its manners are bold and attractive. It has been nicknamed
" The Alarm Bird " because when it sees an intruder it rises from
the ground, flies round and round uttering shrill screams of protest
which are a signal to any birds and beasts in the neighbourhood to be
on the alert.
It breeds in January. Its food consists of insects and worms.
In many respects it resembles the European Peewit, but the wings are
longer, so that its flight is more elegant and far less laboured in
appearance.

The fine and really beautifully primrose-coloured wattle, the
colouring of the bill and the eye, the fascinating pink of the legs and
the contrasting colours of the plumage add to its distinctions. Black
and white, cinnamon and purple, are enhanced by the brilliant yellow.
It is decidedly one of the most charming of the Plover group.
We now concern ourselves with the Natores :--*
Order natores. Family anatid^. Genus chenopis.
One of the most ornamental birds of the Natores Order is the Black
Swan. It is a noble-looking creature. It is found in the Southern
and Western districts of Australia.
The writer's attention was first attracted to it on the occasion
of a memorable visit to the beautiful and well laid out public gardens
of the King's Park, at Perth, Western Australia. There, in an ideal
setting, these ornamental and rare birds (since the genus is strictly
confined to Australia) are seen to advantage. The magnificence and
variety of the gaily-coloured flowering gum-trees (Eucalypti), the well-
kept lawns, the delightful lake and the bluest of blue skies, enhanced
by brilliant sunshine afford a perfect setting for the black plumage,
touched with white, of the graceful creature. .
In the year 1698 (240 years ago) there occurs in a letter written to
Dr. M. Lister by a Mr. Witsen this record : " Here is returned a ship,
which by our East India Company w r as sent to the South land called
' Hollandia Nova and the writer goes on to tell that Black Swans,
Parrots, and many Sea Cows were found there. It seems that twenty-
eight years later two Black Swans were brought alive to Batavia from
Dirk Hartogs Bay, on the West Coast of Australia.
The Black Swan has been mentioned many times in literature, but
very little has been written of its habits. On rivers, estuaries of the sea,
lagoons and expansive pools of water over the whole of the southern
portion of Australia, the islands of Bass's Strait and Tasmania, large
flocks running into many hundreds of these interesting birds flourish.
Neither the boisterous winds nor the aborigines disturb the birds.
Regretfully we must admit the sad truth that the most deadly foe

of the Black Swan is the white man. Nothing would seem to satisfy
him but the extirpation of the bird. One of his cruel methods of des-
truction is the practice of chasing the birds by boat at the particular
time when they are unable to fly owing to the shedding of their primary
quill feathers. Sometimes they are captured from mere wantonness ;
at others for the beautiful down with which the breasts are clothed,
which is highly prized and of monetary value.
It is on record by Professor Gould that he had heard of the boats
of a whaler entering an estuary, the boats returning to the ship nearly
filled with black swans destroyed in this manner.
Breeding Season. --From October to January.
The Nest. --This is composed of herbage, such as flags and rushes.
It is large in size and for preference placed on an isolated island.
The Eggs. --The eggs are from five to eight in number, of a pale
green colour or tint, with buffy-brown markings. Size 4J in. long, by
2f in. broad. The male and female birds take it in turn to sit on
the nest.
One of the earliest and most successful breeders of the bird in this
country w T as the late Samuel Gurney, Esq., who on his estate at
Carshalton in Surrey, on the Biver Wandle, placed a pair which he
purchased in Leadenhall Market. In seven years they bred sixteen
times, having laid 111 eggs.
The reputation accruing to the Black Swan does not truthfully
describe its character. It has the reputation of being cruel and fierce
and destructive, whereas in its natural disposition it is gentle and
tame unless molested or placed near the White Swan, which bird it
will not tolerate for any length of time but invariably destroys.
In this sketch of Australia's bird beauties, we have confined our-
selves to giving some brief notes about one specimen of six of the
Orders into which at start we divided them. Had we space we could
continue our description almost ad infinitum.

Although a friend of mine (a Mr. Wade, of Ashstead) some twenty
years ago bred a hybrid from a Mexican Rosefinch and a hen Green-
finch, and another friend (Mr. Waller, of Norwood) bred several Mexican
Rosefinch X Canary hybrids in recent years, I thought I would make
similar trials with a Mexican Rosefinch I had (recently killed by a
weaver). He first bred three female hybrids with a Greenfinch, then
three the next year paired with a hen Canary, and this year confined
with a hen Bullfinch produced one young hybrid. This, I think, is
the first attempt at such a cross. I am afraid the bird is a female.
It resembles a nestling Bullfinch with modified bill and shows hardly
any indication of a dark cap. The white bow over the upper tail coverts
is distinct, but dirty, and the wings and tail are Bullfinch-like but
browner. It is now in almost adult plumage.
The female Rosefinch X Greenfinch hybrids showed no inclination
to carry material the subsequent season. Male Rosefinch X Canary
hybrids (two used) whilst very amative were much too dangerous to
use with a Canary. Whether the Rosefinch X Bullfinch will show any
inclination to nest remains to be tried. I had hoped to use this old
Rosefinch with a Linnet next year, but if circumstances permit will
use instead another bird, a Rosefinch or House-finch which is of a
different race to the old bird. During the last few years we have reared
to maturity here hybrids from Hooded, Black-headed, and European
Siskins, Alario Finch, Serin Finch (S. serinus ), Sulphury Seedeater,
and hen Canary. The males of all have been tested repeatedly with
hen Canaries in cage and aviary, and so far no F2's have been bred
other than five, those being from a Hooded Siskin X Canary hybrid,
bred by Dr. Amsler. Two males have been used for two seasons, but
no further fertility has resulted. One Hooded Siskin X Canary male
has been employed five seasons with no indication of fertility.

The Secretary and myself paid a visit on the opening day, 31st
March, to this very interesting establishment. It should prove a very
useful addition to the London bird shops, and a good medium for
obtaining all sorts of rare and beautiful birds.
A large spacious room on the fifth floor of Peter Jones has been
well fitted up for the purpose, and as the whole front is practically
window space, it is extremely light and airy.
We saw housed in the large show cages a very fine and varied
collection. All seemed well and healthy, and besides numbers of the
commoner species, contained many others seldom seen nowadays.
I noticed particularly a large number of Alario Finches, which are
such lovely little songsters, and are rarely seen in anything but very
small numbers. I also noticed a very good show of Tanagers, the
prettiest perhaps was the All-green one of the Chlorophonia group ;
besides this species there were several Masked, very rarely seen, lovely
Striata Blue and Black, Violet, and Superb. Many other rare birds
were on show. I have been in again, and many of these have been
sold, but another fine lot have come in. I understand no trouble is
to be spared to obtain the best birds. So we all hope the venture will
continue to be a great success. I write this note primarily for the
benefit of those too far away to pay a personal visit.

cherished pair of birds everything arranged to their liking should
they feel inclined to win that coveted medal for us ? Will they even
go to nest ? Or, as in the case of a good many " pairs " are they really
a pair at all, or just two hens making believe ?
Supposing these doubts are satisfactorily settled, and the birds
are truly mated, will they choose a suitable nesting place or will they
select the most exposed and draughtiest spot they can find ? Will
the nesting material supplied meet with their approval ? Having chosen
the site and built their nest, will they take the next step and lay in it ?
Will the eggs be fertile and will the birds prove good sitters ? When
nestlings appear, will their father drag them out of the nest and drop
them in the most distant corner of the aviary ? Will the food supplied
suit the babies ? Will the weather be favourable, or will piercing blasts
and cold rain chill the life out of them ?
If all these questions are satisfactorily answered, there still remains
the anxious wonder : How will the nestlings fare when they leave the
nest ? Will they feather well, and will the old birds look after them
until they can fend for themselves ? Or will they leave them to starve
because they want to go to nest again immediately ? In short, their
path is beset with anxious forebodings from the cradle to (so often !)
the grave.
We here are no exception to the general rule : eggs are coming in
with satisfactory regularity from Tragopans, Mikados, Imperial, and
Edwards in appearance all that can be desired, but until the testing
we shall not know if they are fertile or clear. Certainly the cocks
all seem devoted to their wives, with one exception, our only cock
Blyth Tragopan has fallen in love with the hen Satyr over the way,
and repeatedly tells her so with calls which sound like a cross between
a tom cat in love and a sick cow. She very properly pays no attention
to him, walks about with her handsome spouse, and never casts a glance
at the love-lorn swain opposite. A screen has been put up between
them, and we hope it will be a case of " out of sight out of
mind ".
The Pheasants are very tame, so much so that those to whom they
are accustomed can watch the cocks " display " without disturbing
them. Tragopans especially are magnificent when they let down their

brilliant " bibs ", erect their horns, and show off their beautiful plumage.
They and their hens usually appear to be on good terms, more so than
the true Pheasants, particularly the " Coppers ", who often treat their
wives with great brutality, even killing them if they show reluctance
to comply with their lords' desires. Last year " Scintillans " was so
vicious that he could only be allowed access to his hen when someone
stood by to frustrate his murderous intentions, consequently all the
eggs were infertile.
This year, up to date (touch wood !) he has turned over a new leaf,
and we hope that the union will be crowned with offspring. Soemerring,
on the contrary, is a timid creature, bullied and driven by his masterful
wife.
When Pheasants are really familiar they show unexpected traits of
character. A Cabot's Tragopan learnt to take monkey nuts from hand.
One day we wished to remove him from his rather small pen to a
much larger and better one some way off ; this, of course, involved
catching him and his chief friend undertook the job, thinking that
the bird would be less upset than if a stranger caught hold of him.
The job was soon done and Cabot safely inside his new abode. Next
day his friend called on him and offered the customary nuts, Cabot
eyed him coldly and stalked off, he showed as plainly as if he could
speak that he did not intend to have dealings with anyone who abused
his confidence under the guise of friendship. He took nuts from the
rest of us as readily as ever. He kept up this attitude for several weeks,
regardless of blandishments and entreaty, till one day he relented and
let bygones be bygones.
A certain liveliness prevails in the duckery. The South African
Shelduck laid as usual, they are very free breeders, and their ducklings
easily reared. We feel more excited at the prospect of Orinoco goslings
as this is the first time we have had eggs from this species. The gander
is a handsome bird, and " shows off " by throwing an enormous chest
when we approach him or his wife.
The small ducks on the river are laying, but it is very difficult to
fit the right layer to the laid. So often the egg is deposited late in the
evening or early in the morning and when it is found the Duck is
disporting herself on the river with the rest. If these eggs hatch, we

should have an interesting medley of ducklings to sort out. Time
will show.
The Cranes have been too much disturbed to be likely to lay this
year. We have Stanleys, Demoiselles, Grey-necked, and Black-necked
Crowned Cranes, White-necked European, Sarus, Manchurian,
Australian, Asiatic, White, and Mexican Sandhill; these last are
again incubating eggs, having laid a full month earlier than last
year. We have also one only precious Hooded Crane, for whom
we ardently desire a mate. All this family is highly decorative, and
look beautiful stalking about with measured tread or dancing and
trumpeting to each other.
A tiny pair of Galapagos Ground Doves nested in a little depression
in a corner of one of the Pheasant shelters. One baby hatched and
grew very rapidly, now it is quite grown up, and nearly as large as its
parents, not that this is saying much.

As a result of a small article of mine, published in the April issue
of the Magazine, I have been favoured with some interesting corre-
spondence on bird matters, and incidentally have been reminded that
the study of our own native birds would seem to be sadly neglected.
One can hardly believe this branch of our hobby to be exhausted.
Perhaps it is left to the less ambitious fancier. I propose to write of
my own impressions, and from my own experiences, giving special
notice of the species mentioned as seemingly neglected.
With regard to the small wading birds, my experiences are some-
what limited and have been spasmodic. I remember being surprised
to find that many species will live together all the year round, and seem
to enjoy the company of each other; even so, I would hesitate to keep
more than one pair of each species together in the breeding season,
however large the aviary. I understand--though not from my own

experience--that the chicks of the average small wading birds are as
easy to rear as are chickens. In my early enthusiasm I tried every
conceivable method of feeding, only to find they seem to thrive better
on a very simple diet. The said diet to consist of biscuit meal, scalded,
strained, and a little minced beef mixed with it. My waders would
never welcome any change from this, except when I would supply a
few snails, earwigs, or periwinkles. I have had more surprises and
less shocks in keeping small wading birds than with keeping British
Finches.
The Redpoll, though not aggressive, seems to be too mischievous
for a mixed collection. It is never safe to dogmatize, but I find these
birds come into breeding condition quite easily, and, when building,
will visit every other nest in the aviary to steal nesting material ;
it was a usual sight to see a Redpoll inadvertently drag out a clutch
of eggs from the nest of a Canary or a Goldfinch, and if their own nest
is looked at, they are likely to pull it to bits, destroy the eggs, and
then start to build another nest on the same site. If a pair of Linnets
have wintered in the aviary, one may expect them to go to nest the
following spring, though just before coming into breeding condition
they become very restless indeed ; they become so irritatingly restless
that their owner may be strongly tempted to liberate them, but they
suddenly settle down and go to nest, and will rear two broods with
ease on a diet of canary food, with the addition of almost any seeding
grasses that are obtainable at the time.
The Bullfinch I have found more difficult, both cock and hen
seem to be most aggressive. My Bullfinches would go to nest, incubate,
but always failed to rear their young. I have yet to find a diet to suit
them while feeding their chicks, they seem to require so many berries,
and tinned berries seem to help the Bullie chicks to die more quickly
than starvation. Plant life would seem to be quite out of the question
in an aviary where a pair of Bullfinches are kept. I should imagine
the best chance of breeding with Siskins would be in their first year
of captivity, because if kept with a collection that would necessitate
all kinds of food being provided, the Siskins seem to become too
sluggish for breeding after the first summer. They are greedy, even so
they make most attractive aviary birds. The Chaffinch will go to nest

more easily than any Finch I know, though they demand so much
live food when feeding their young ; it would seem almost impossible
to rear more than two chicks out of each nest. My birds would allow
me to touch them rather than leave the nest while incubating. I have
never reared more than three young Chaffinches in one season, from
one pair. An unmated hen Chaffinch once almost killed a cock Canary
because he answered her call for a mate. I have never had more than
two broods from a pair of Chaffinches in one season, although I have
had four broods from the Greenfinch and three broods from the Gold-
finch, in one season. I have found the Goldfinch to be an easy bird
to breed in captivity : the last brood of the season have always been
the strongest birds, probably because they would be fed by both
parents for a longer period, and also because more thistle heads are
obtainable at the later date. On one occasion four hen Goldfinches
were run with one cock Goldfinch. Each hen went to nest and hatched
out a clutch of chicks, and each hen deserted the brood as soon as they
were hatched. The cock bird ignored each hen after she had produced
a full clutch of eggs. Although Greenfinches are so prolific, I have
persistently lost 95 per cent of the chicks by the 1st November the
same year.
On one occasion only have I had young from the Yellow Bunting :
the young were not reared, the parent birds required more live food
than I could provide, the chicks survived for seven days only. I should
imagine the Reed Bunting to be the most desirable of all the British
Buntings; the species seems to be the most confiding, but if kept with a
mixed collection and mealworms are supplied, the cock bird is likely
to get more than his share, and therefore becomes liverish. Stagnant
water seems to attract minute insects which seems to keep them fit.
The Bramble Finch was ever a favourite with me, until I found he
had a playful habit of swallowing Canary chicks whole.
The above are some of my conclusions after many years' experi-
menting. I would never keep more than four possible breeding pairs
in one aviary, however large, during the breeding season. The Thrush
family I exclude from the Finch aviary. The Tit family I am content
to study in the wild state only, their habits being far worse than those
of the Bramble Finch.

In conversation with members of the Council, it was suggested that
I should tell readers this month of the Starlings and Mynahs in the
collection.
The Zoo Gardens are at the present time most attractive, the fresh
green of the trees, many beautiful shrubs gay with flowers, and the
spring bedding of early tulips and deliciously scented masses of wall-
flowers make a delightful picture. Reluctantly I leave this scene and
go on to the small Bird House, and as I pass I notice the many occupants
of the aviaries with outside runs also realize that spring is here, and
are full of the joy of life. Several are carrying nesting material,
especially the Hawfinches. After a look round I went in search of
Keepers Tanner and Raggett, who were most kind and helpful in
telling me the different species X should find, and afterwards the former
spent a long time helping me with the names, etc.
There are at present some very fine specimens of Starlings in the
Gardens. They are fine aviary birds, and are at their best if given
plenty of room to fly about, and look beautiful with shimmering
plumage changing colour every minute as a different light falls upon
them.
Of the long-tailed varieties there are at present two species, both
from Abyssinia ; the most gorgeous of all, the Royal Starling ( Cosmo -
parus regius) gowned right royally, and a handsome specimen in finest
condition of the Crowned Starling ( Galiopsa salvadori).
Glossy Starlings of the genus Spreo are well represented. The
Superb Glossy Starling ( Spreo superbus ), East Africa, is very fine, and
the Bird House has a very fine specimen, among others, bred in the
menagerie 26th June, 1929. Near it is Shelley's Starling [Spreo
shelleyi) from Somaliland, not often seen ; the Beautiful Spreo [Spreo
pulcher) did not strike me as being as lovely as the others, the commoner
Green Glossy Starling [Lamprocolius chalybeus) N.E. Africa, for instance,
and the Purple-headed Glossy [L. purpureus) West Africa, are both
exquisite, and to be seen here in grand condition. A great contrast to
the above is the Bald-headed Starling [Sarcops calvus) from the

Philippine Islands ; grey and black with naked flesh-coloured head, a
very strange bird and rare, brought over, I believe, by Mr. Walter
Goodfellow. There are two varieties of the Amethyst Starling
(.Pholidauges leucogaster) from Gambia, and Verreaux's Amethyst
Starling ( Pholidauges leucogaster verreauxi) ; what a glorious bird this
last-named is ; the Zoo have kept their specimen in the wonderful
condition it is to-day since June, 1921. Seventeen years !
One of the rarest Starlings in the collection is the Chinese [Sturnia
turdiformis) also brought over by Mr. Goodfellow. The Pagoda Starling
(Temenuchus pagodarum ) from India, is beautiful and very amusing,
and the Mandarin Starling [Sturnia sinensis) is very small, white and
grey, with black wings and tail. It is said to breed easily. The Rose-
coloured Starling ( Pastor roseus) is a handsome commonly imported
species, with a crested black head--the rose colour fades in captivity.
It is a peaceful and sociable bird.
Then there is the Chesnut-winged Starling (Amydrus morio) from
South Africa, and finally a grand pair of Rothschild's Grackles, five or
six years in the collection, and like silk, their plumage snow-white
and glistening. I was told they would most likely breed if they
could be given an aviary to themselves. So far only Mr. Ezra has bred
this species in captivity.
The Mynahs are an amusing lot, headed by the large Nepal Hill
Mynah [Eulabes intermedia ), North India. Two specimens in cages are
always surrounded by visitors listening to their distinct talking. They
are not always willing to do it, because a great deal of their time is
taken up in eating. The Crested or Chinese Mynah [Mihiopsar crista-
tatus , syn. Acridoiheres cristatellus) is a good mimic too, for the one
at the Zoo was copying exactly his neighbour in an adjoining aviary,
the Laughing Kingfishers. Then there is the Co mm on Mynah ( Acrido -
theres tristis) India, and the Ceylon Mynah (A. tristis melanosterms ).
The Brown or Jungle Mynah [Mihiopsar fuscus) India, and lastly the
small and very charming Golden-crested Mynah [Ampelicip coronatus),
Burma. While I was watching, one in the outside flight treated me to
a very quaint little song.

During the month of March the membership of the O.P.S. reached \0x25A0
the very satisfactory total of 500 and we are naturally proud of this j
achievement. When the Society was first formed it was thought by j
some doubting " Thomases " that if we could keep an average of 100
members we should feel satisfied but that pessimistic outlook soon
went by the board, for three months after our formation the century
had " gone up ". As this may be considered a landmark for the O.P.S.
it may be as well roughly to review our work and discover if the Society \
has merited the support received. By propaganda work and by the
extensive use of the Press, and especially is this due to the Avicultural
Magazine and Cage Birds, we have increased the number of Pheasant
fanciers by at least 50 per cent, probably the percentage is far greater.
That in itself is highly satisfactory. We have established the showing
of Pheasants and the results of this activity, although not obvious,
must in time prove beneficial to our hobby, as birds of such beautiful
plumage are bound to make an appeal to a larger public sooner or later.
By the formation of the O.P.S. there has been a happy and sincere
exchange regarding the best methods of keeping and rearing these birds.
In this matter our Journal has been a direct method and perhaps
even more important still it has caused many members to correspond
and this has produced an interchange of thoughts regarding the culture.
In one respect the Society cannot yet claim a success. We had hoped
to import for the benefit of our members many rare Pheasants and such
importations would have been carried out under ideal conditions,
the procedure was well in hand but we did not meet with the support
that we anticipated. A reason for this may be found in the fact that
under the scheme members were asked to find 50 per cent of the money
before the birds were shipped and this undoubtedly proved unpalatable
to many. We shall try again, I feel sure, and make the scheme more
" appetizing We must not forget the social side of our activities.
Our two general meetings are well attended and these functions prove
not only interesting but many lasting friendships have been made as a
direct result of members coming together in this social manner. I

Madam, --The question of Keas being sheep-killers or not is still a vexed
one, from an article in another paper recently. All aspects must be studied
before any decision may be made. Anatomically the Keas' " Cruel Beak "
needs mention. Regrettably the Kea (for the Kea) has a very long upper
mandible, which may look dangerous. In truth, Keas have not a strong beak
and are actual "nibblers". A Kea's beak, in captivity, fails to make an
impression on hazel-nuts, walnuts, and brazil-nuts. Compared to other birds,
the Kea's feet are weak and the claws are by no means fearsome. Meal-
worms, which are attractive to most insectivorous birds, are just ignored by
the Kea.
If one can, by aid of a pair of forceps, persuade a Kea to pick up a meal-
worm, the grub is dropped at once. A handful of mealworms will walk away
among several Kea's feet, and meantime these birds are expectant for some-
thing, either the aforesaid forceps or a bunch of keys or peanuts, etc.
In conclusion, one of the Keas here was a bit damaged in a high wind.
The birds pinch fingers if caught, and to save my delicate hands the man who
looks after them actually put his finger in the lion's mouth and allowed
the bird to hold his finger while I examined it.

Madam,-- Could some member of the Avicultural Society tell me some-
thing about a very nice little Finch which I acquired recently, called, I think,
the " Black and White Crested Finch ", and which is new to me.
It was one of a small lot received some months ago by one of the dealers,
two, from the same consignment I imagine, having been shown at the last
Crystal Palace Show. I should be interested to know what is its country
of origin (it looks South American), and what are the sexual differences.
The bird I have is a male, having a sweet though, so far, short song, and is
an elegant and taking little fellow with his slender black vertical crest and
neat black cravat and facial bands. He seems quite hardy and easy to keep.

I have lately received a letter from a friend in the Argentine telling me
that he is sending me a pair of " Corbatitas ", another small greyish Finch,
a nice little singer, also having a neat black cravat (hence the name), and
with which I am very familiar, for several pairs used to build their frail nests
of palm fibres in the peach and " Mandarin " trees in my garden out in
Uruguay, in pleasant years gone by. And yet I do not know his scientific

The consignment of seven Desmarest's Dwarf Parrots recently
brought over by Mr. J. C. Frost introduced a species entirely new
to aviculture, a description of which is rendered unnecessary by the
excellent plate which accompanies this article.
There is always a great excitement and interest about seeing for
the first time in the living state a bird previously only known to one
as a museum skin, and sub-generically quite distinct from anything
one has ever kept.
In size and build Desmarest's Dwarf Parrots are not very unlike
some of the Poiocephali, especially Meyers' Parrot, but there the resem-
blance ends for, in spite of its lack of a brush tongue, in voice and
movements the Dwarf Parrot is almost a typical Lorikeet.
The food appears to consist almost entirely of fruit ; my birds
eat apple, pear, grapes, and banana, on which latter they were, I
believe, imported. They drink a little Lorikeet's food (Dr. Allinson's),
but I have a strong suspicion that they would get on perfectly well
without it. Seed they will not look at, although they like barking
the green twigs of a sycamore branch ; are very fond of mealworms ;

collection. My four are at present living in a flight cage and agree well
together. They are all exceedingly alike in appearance but, as museum
skins show practically no sex difference in plumage, I am hoping
that I may have at least one true pair, as two preen each other's
feathers in an affectionate way.
My birds bathe quite freely, but ignore the sleeping boxes with
which I provided them and which in consequence have now been
removed.
In saying that the Dwarf Parrots' voices resemble those of Lorikeets
I ought, in fairness, to add, " in their more restrained moments."
They make themselves heard, it is true, but do not, as far as I have yet
observed, ever indulged in anything approaching the ear-piercing noises
of which Swainson's are so fond.
The flight is swift and direct, the wings being pointed and rather
short.

While realizing that there are fellow members who are in a very
much better position to write on this subject than I am, it might be
of some little interest to give some of my personal experiences as an
amateur importer of foreign birds mainly for my own aviaries.
At first one is liable to be over enthusiastic ; one hears that such
and such a bird can be bought in its native habitat for a matter of 5s.
or so, while its market value over in this country (England) is perhaps
#10. Well, it all sounds very easy to get someone to send the birds
on in charge of the butcher on a certain ship ; to be at the docks
when the birds arrive and carry one's treasures home, saving at least
#8 or #9 on the transaction. It may sound all right according to theory,
but take it from me, you will find it far cheaper in the end to purchase
your birds from a reputable dealer or collector in London than import

them for yourself. The trouble and worry will be likely to lead, if not to
a nervous breakdown, at least to premature grey hairs. I notice that
I have quite a few myself now, which I am sure is due to long contact
with the Customs Authorities !
The first birds I ever received were five rare Parrakeets, but this
was in the good old days before there were any customs duties or
restrictions on the importations of Parrots. In those days one heard
of no such things as cc Bills of Lading ", Certificates of Origin, and other
such complicated things, one simply walked on to the ship, told those
in authority who one was, tipped the butcher, and walked off with the
birds. Nothing could be simpler. Then came all the various import
restrictions and customs duties. Some time afterwards some more
birds arrived from a friend in New Zealand : they consisted of New
Zealand Zosterops and a pair of Black Swans. The birds were duly
landed. A friend in London lent me a fast car and a chauffeur, if it
hadn't have been for these I might have been at the docks yet!
The birds were brought off the ship, the Zosterops put on the back
seat and the Swans loose in the back part of the car. All was set,
and we were ready to start back. A customs officer now appeared on
the scene : Had I signed form number " so-and-so 55 relating to the
" Ad valorem duties " ? No, I hadn't, but I would do so as soon as
I could get one, where could I get one from ? It wasn't his duty to
give advice ! There was about a mile's walk to the nearest custom
house on the docks ; could I have form number 12345/12345/12345,
or whatever it was ? No. Well, where could I get it from ? They
didn't know, I must find out. Well, the best thing to do, apparently,
was to go to the office of the shipping company in the City, six or
seven miles away through London's worst traffic. No, they couldn't
tell me where I could get the form from, their responsibility ceased
when the birds were taken off the ship. If I went to Thames House,
I was told, I might get the form there. After being rebuffed several
times at Thames House, I waited meekly with hundreds of other
seemingly disappointed clients on the forms in the main hall. At
last plucking up courage, I demanded the said form from the nearest
clerk in the main hall. " What was it for % " Live birds--better see

after inquiring from about a dozen officials, each one more discourteous
than the last, I received the cherished form. This I bore back in triumph
to the customs man at the Dock. Here were more officials and delays.
No, I had the wrong form! Well, where could I get the right form from ?
I must find out! What did I think the customs officers were there
for--to act as an information bureau ? In the meantime, the birds
had been unloaded into one of the wharf sheds and there seemed little
likelihood of my retrieving them before they died of old age. To cut
a long story short, after two days&apos; oscillation between Thames House,
Adelaide House, the Port of London Authority, the shippers, and to
say nothing of frequent visits to the Docks to see how the birds were
getting on, and travelling several hundred miles in London's worst
traffic, I was about to give up the quest and evidently looking very
despondent in Adelaide House (one of London's chief custom offices)
when I was approached by an individual who politely inquired if he
could be of any service. I realized by his attitude that he could not
possibly be connected with the Customs so I told him my trouble
and he proved to be an importer's agent.
In less than two hours we had obtained the form from one of
H.M. Stationers in an obscure street in the City, and the birds were
duly taken away from the docks. The agent's fee was 5s. and it was
well worth it. Though I think this was only a kind of bait, as his price
gradually went up to five guineas. After then I got someone else.
But I think at the time I would have paid #5, so desperate had
I become. The agent's advice regarding getting the customs officers
to do anything was certainly very unflattering from their point
of view.
It is practically impossible for the lay person to get birds out of
the London Docks unless he employs an agent who is well up in the
tricks of the trade. Now, I never go down to the docks : upon the
rare occasions when I do receive birds I leave it in the hands of an
agent. Unfortunately this is rather an expensive business, for besides
the agent's fee of several guineas there are dock fees, Port of London
Authority charges, tips, cartage charges, carriage, duty, etc., etc.

S. Porter--Experiences of an Amateur Importer of Foreign Birds 153
Often the charges exceed the value of the birds themselves. The
customs officials, instead of being helpful, place every obstacle in one's
way, not only that, but they treat one as though one were asking for
the loan of a " fiver " ! After some years of importing birds by the
means of agents, I gave it up as a disastrous failure. Many exceedingly
rare and valuable birds have been lost through lack of attention given
them on board the ship, and bad food and ignorance on the part of
those supposed to look after them. Sometimes, if the birds have not
died on the voyage, they have arrived in such a condition that they have
succumbed soon afterwards.
Consignments of birds which I have sent in exchange to friends
overseas have proved equally disastrous. Perhaps, owing to some
trouble with the customs officers, the birds have been left on the dock
side in a biting cold wind for the best part of a day, consequently
in a short time they have died of pneumonia. The cost of shipping
birds from this country is excessive ; there are a hundred and one
expenses which, individually, are not large, but which all mount up
and in the end assume an alarming total.
At last so distressing did the mortality become and so heavy the
debit that I decided if I wanted any more birds I would fetch them
myself and not leave them to the tender mercies of butchers, bakers,
and suchlike on the ship. Having through circumstance beyond my
control to spend a certain part of every year abroad, I usually choose
as my place of residence the habitat of some bird which I desire and
when there use every effort to procure it.
At first when one is " green " there are many pitfalls. One always
forgets something, food runs short, cages are inadequate, and a hundred
and one other things, but through bitter experience, which is the best
teacher, one soon learns.
In the first place, when I contemplate such a trip, a number of
rough cages are prepared, usually " Tate " sugar boxes which are
obtainable from the family grocer at the cost of a few pence. These
are divided into two compartments, each one will hold a bird the
size of a Thrush ; the great thing is never to overcrowd your birds
and it is usually better to bring birds over in cages to themselves.
Overcrowding is the cause of 90 per cent of the mortality in importing

birds. When once a bird becomes messed up it soon loses heart and
dies. Besides, birds often fight badly when confined together in a small
space. It is really no advantage to economize on the cubic space,
even if one does pay a little more, one's birds arrive healthy and in
perfect condition. To get back to the sugar boxes, I get wire fronts
made to fit, also trays for the bottoms. The cages are then knocked to
pieces in sections and packed flat so that they will travel easily on the
ship, and in this way one hasn't to pay freight on them. It is advisable
to take a few yards of |-inch wire netting in case one runs short of
cages. In that case, boxes or cases can often be obtained from ports
en route or at one's destination and the ship's carpenter will, for a
consideration, soon knock up a cage for one. It is essential for one to
take food, especially such stuff as Mellin's or Horlick's, for Lories
or Sunbirds, for often in small obscure parts of the world these are
unobtainable. Honey and condensed milk can usually be bought
anywhere, but usually the honey is of poor quality or contains pre-
servatives, as I know to my cost, when I lost a whole lot of Sunbirds
through giving them cheap honey, all I could get, in Singapore. It is
well to take seed, Parrot seed particularly, especially if one goes to
obscure tropical countries and also " soft food " which is often quite
unobtainable. Of course, with New Zealand and Australia it is a
different matter and one can usually obtain all one wants in the matter
of food.
The ship's chef or butcher will, also for a consideration, supply
one with hard-boiled eggs, sponge cakes, and also chopped-up fresh
meat for such birds as Kingfishers, Birds of Prey, etc.
What I find is most essential is a bundle of old newspapers, this is
by far the best covering for the bottoms of the cages. Cut to fit the
trays and laid down in several thicknesses, the soiled sheets can be
changed several times a day and in this way the birds do not dirty
themselves. A bucket, a scrubbing brush or two, a bundle of mixed
thicknesses of dowelling from the local woodwork shop for perches,
some " bird-cage " wire, plenty of food pots and tins, and an escape-
proof box of mealworms are about all the amateur importer needs,
except, and which is perhaps the most essential of all, plenty of tact.
This latter is very necessary in making friends with the following of

the ship's personnel, firstly the chief cook and the butcher, though in
very small ships one man often combines the two jobs. These two are
the most important people on board to gain favour with, for on them
one relies for all manner of things such as extra food in the shape
of fresh vegetables, eggs, fresh meat, hot water, extra culinary utensils
(perhaps a very large meat tin or stew pans so that one's ducks can
have a swim). They will also put any perishable food in the cold
storage. If one falls out with the cook or butcher one has a very
difficult task on board ship, but one usually finds the men in either
of these capacities very affable kinds of individuals, as indeed nearly
all seafaring men are.
The next person to get on good terms with is the chief officer, for
he has to do with the accommodation and it is very essential to have
heated quarters for birds from tropical climates when they reach the
so-called " temperate zones I find that it is better when booking
one's passage to mention the question of accommodation for the
birds and if possible to see it beforehand. Very often one is assigned
very unsuitable quarters, such as in the paint house or in a dark
store with no light. If one threatens to book by a rival company one
is quickly alloted more suitable accommodation for one's livestock.
Once a ship's doctor had to give up his cabin for my birds, con-
sequently we were hardly on speaking terms the whole voyage, which
was a very long one. Fortunately I had no need for medical assistance
on the voyage home, or I may not have been writing this !
The carpenter is another person with whom it is advisable to get
acquainted, he can help one a great deal in the making and fitting
up of cages, etc. One often finds that after a few days a couple of birds
in one cage will take a dislike to each other and start to fight : this
usually ends in death unless each bird is caged separately or a division
put in their cage. He is useful for borrowing such tools from, which
one may have come without.
Taken on the average one finds sailors much more affable and
congenial than " landlubbers ", their very calling seems to demand
more tolerance and forbearance than is required on shore.
One's fellow passengers often prove a great trial, wanting to see
the birds at all kinds of inconvenient times and offering all kinds of

advice and bringing to see tbe " pretty dicky-birds " spoilt children
who bang on the cage fronts to make the birds fly.
To get away from all these needless distractions, I always travel
by " intermediate " steamers or cargo boats which carry only a few
passengers. On these there are few if any women or children, no
wearying rounds of deck sports or cocktail or bridge parties to distract
one's attention from their feathered charges. Only those who have
had to get up at 6 a.m. after a cocktail party to look after one's birds
know what a relief it is to be on a ship where there are no such dis-
tractions or temptations.
It is of little use going to a port and expecting to pick up rare
birds from the native bird sellers, though in such large cities as Buenos
Aires, etc., it is quite possible to pick up rare birds from the various
bird shops. To get some special bird one has often to make long stays
at remote inland settlements and often make journeys through wild
and rough country, consequently one has to put up with a great deal
of discomfort and inconvenience.
It is surprising how quickly one makes friends with the ship's
crew if one has livestock on board, it seems to act as a kind of intro-
duction to everyone from the captain downwards. It certainly opens
up a new subject for conversation, of which there is usually a dearth
on board ship after the first week or two, and in this way I have made
many pleasant friendships between members of the ship's personnel
and myself.
I once heard of a lady who had three unmarried daughters who
were getting dangerously near the " left over " stage, so she sent each
one on a voyage to India and back with a handsome blue Persian
cat, which acted as a kind of " open sesame " in the matters of intro-
ductions--" Does this lovely pussy belong to you ? " kind of thing.
At all events the trick worked and the lady was rewarded with three
sons-in-law ! But I am wandering from my subject.
Sometimes one meets with nasty and officious captains who out
of sheer " cussedness " object to birds being put in empty cabins and
who arrive on their daily tour of inspection just as one is cleaning
out the cages, and make all kinds of sarcastic remarks such as
" kindly remember that human beings have to sleep here after

you've finished with it Fortunately ones like that are not often
encountered.
Occasionally enthusiasm has overrun discretion and I have found
myself on board with dozens of huge crates and cases full of birds.
The climax was when I left Singapore with over 200 birds, mostly
large ones. I had to recruit a Chinese servant from the crew and even
then I was working from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m. with only time off for meals.
Even then I had a very happy voyage, but it cured me of ever bringing
large consignments of birds over again. For one thing I hadn't the
accommodation and I had to sell some of the birds, a thing I hate doing.
Now I only bring, say, a dozen pairs of birds, which I know I can
accommodate and which only take a couple of hours a day to look
after on the ship.
Quite recently, when in Australia, I had the utmost difficulty in
obtaining permission to take even the commonest birds out of the
country, some of the officials being rude and rather discourteous.
Had I been a foreigner armed with a letter from an obscure trading
Continental " Zoo " I should doubtless have been met with open arms
and allowed to depart with innumerable birds. However, the
authorities in New South Wales allowed me to take away a Lemon-
crested Cockatoo, four Waxbills, and a pair of Red-rumps, my
application for other birds being ignored. Through the indefatigable
efforts of Mr. Turner, the leading bird dealer in Sydney, I was able,
at the very last moment, to get permission from the Queensland
authorities to take away amongst others, Regent Birds, Cat Birds,
Satin Bower Birds, etc. Before the ship sailed an official who was in
charge during the absence of the ornithologist from the Museum, and
who advises the authorities in New South Wales regarding the export
of birds, came down to see that I was only taking my proper quota of
one Cockatoo and four Waxbills and the pair of Red-rumps. When
we discovered him examining the other birds, he rather reminded
me of a constable who had just come across a coiner's den ! Armed
with a pencil, note-book, and assistant he was taking down all
particulars, but when we showed the permit--well ! Later, he
got into such a rage that I think half the ship must have heard him
shouting. On the same ship the only place allotted for my birds was

in a very conspicuous place on the " Tourist " deck. The birds con-
stituted a free show for all and sundry.
The crates with the birds in were mainly used as seats by the
passengers who, when the crates were not the convenient height, just
turned them over ! Had the passengers been only provided with
boxes to sit on instead of chairs, no doubt there would have been very
vigorous complaints to the purser. However, I soon found a way of
discouraging this. I just put the droppings and debris from the bottom
of the cages when I cleaned them out, on the top. No doubt people
thought I was filthy but it served my purpose. When a fond mother
was watching her offspring banging the fronts of the cages to frighten
the birds, I turned the boxes round as inconspicuously as possible,
but I heard the parent say in terms of utter disgust, " Just fancy,
wont even let a little child look at his birds." I felt like telling her just
what I'd like to do with her child !
There's a great deal of worry and trouble in importing birds oneself
and I often wonder if it wouldn't be the best to buy one's birds at
Home, and let someone else do all the worrying, but it is very interesting
and one meets in one's travels some very charming and interesting
people and often one gets birds w T hich it would be quite impossible to
get in England. One also gets to know the birds very much more
intimately. " Red-tape " is a joke to most people but when one comes
up against it regarding exporting and importing birds it is far from a
joke and it makes one do things that aren't always compatible with
one's ideas of ethics !

A few hours' drive from London, that is if one is a fast driver,
is a rocky windswept promontory. It used to be a lonely enough spot
before the advent of motor cars, when a few poor farmers struggled
to wrest a livelihood from their small stone-walled fields on the tops
of the crumbling cliffs.

Now all is changed, the little Square of the near-by village is,
during the summer months, thronged with cars and cycles, and the
farmers are now able to buy the luxuries of a modern age by letting
" desirable sites " to the campers and motorists who like to bring
their labour troubles with them in the shape of a tent or caravan.
On the top of the rugged walls of rock is one of Nature's loveliest
gardens, where during the summer months the ground is like a many-
hued carpet, with a thousand and one flowering plants which have been
dwarfed by the bitter winds which drive up from the sea during the
winter time.
Many were the halcyon days spent in this haunt of the " Kusset-
pated Choughs Lying on a carpet of cliffland flowers with the air
thick with swarms of butterflies, delicate Blues, coppery Fritillaries,
gorgeous " Peacocks ", many-hued " Tortoiseshells " and others too
numerous to mention, one could watch many phases in the domestic
economy of these birds. They weren't at all frightened at our intrusion
and sometimes one would surprise a bird only a few feet away from
the top of the cliffs. The Chough would certainly eye one with a
mixture of surprise and curiosity and linger perhaps for a few minutes
before flying off to the opposite face of rock where he no doubt felt a
little more secure. Here in the bright sunlight on the cliff face their
scarlet beak and legs glowed in contrast to their glossy black plumage.
Choughs are great diggers and seem to obtain most of their food
in this manner. They dig with great gusto in the dry turfy soil on the
ledges of the cliff face. I think they must unearth the ants' nests
which abound in the soil on the cliffs. Sometimes a bird would unearth
something, and he and his companions would have a real good feed.
At other times one would see a bird with quite a large white grub
in his beak which would be battered about for quite an appreciable
time before it was finally eaten.
Sometimes, on a large patch of dry earth, the bird would be in the
centre of a cloud of dust caused by its digging operations, or at other
times there would be quite a miniature avalanche of earth and stones
as the bird dug on the steep cliff sides.
I never saw the Choughs away from the face of the cliffs, and
I believe that only when they are very hard pressed for food do they

S. Porter--Choughs
feed on marine life. The flight is much more light and buoyant than
that of a Jackdaw and the large square tail seems to be fastened very
loosely to the body as it pivots from side to side like that of a Kite.
The call is very much like that of a Jackdaw, though some naturalists
say it is very different.
Sometimes it was possible to have within sight at one time six
out of the eight British representatives of the Crow family--the
Magpies and Rooks in the fields on the cliff tops, and Ravens, Carrion
Crows, Jackdaws, and Choughs on the cliff face--and of all of these
birds the Chough is the tamest and most confiding.
Fifty or sixty years ago the Chough was a common enough bird
in the district, and the old inhabitants have told me of having to
stay away from school as children to frighten the Choughs away
from the newly ploughed fields. The farmers thought, seeing the birds
probing in the newly ploughed soil, that they were eating newly planted
wheat, while in reality they were only after the grubs which later
on would feed on the growing wheat. Now all is changed ; the flocks
of Chough have gone, never to return, and to-day it is one of our
rarest resident birds. Its greatest foe at the present time is the egg
collector who, through substantial bribes paid to the local farm workers,
knows the exact location of the nests and the time the full clutch is
laid. The information is telegraphed to the collectors, who arrive in
the early hours of the morning by car, meet their informants, take the
eggs, and are back in their respective homes in a few hours' time.
There seems little hope for the birds, for the old pairs, having their
nests systematically robbed each year, fail to produce any young
ones to take their place when their allotted span is finished. And
so in a few years more the Chough will be placed on the list of our
extinct birds.
Years ago the Chough was a well-known show bird and in the
days of my childhood, just before the War, I have seen as many as
four or five in the class for " Softbills " at the local shows. I never
had one myself, though I have kept the nearly related Alpine Chough,
which is not nearly such an attractive bird as our British Chough.
It was a delightful bird to keep, full of curiosity, and by all accounts
a very long lived one too. There were some in the Wader's Aviary at
the London Zoo which, I believe, had been there for very many years.

REARING BRITISH FINCHES
By Bichard James
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999287875" page_id="56318911"  page_num="161" year="" vol="">
The average bird fancier, keeper, or student cannot afford to be
reticent. The hobby is too involved for one to hope to gain one's
precious data from one's own experiences only.
Often the more ingenious fancier would seem to be too modest to
write of his findings, and it is left to the less ingenious to provoke
him into shedding his modesty.
Dr. Amsler seems to have had considerable experience with
breeding birds and, as an experimentalist, the said fancier is most
enterprising. In reading of this fancier's failures, I have gained more
help, and also, I must confess, have gathered more comfort and
inspiration, than from reading of the easy successes of many other
fanciers.
I invariably keep a few Canaries as possible foster-parents for
chicks from British Finches, but Canaries have never yet obliged by
rearing a single chick of another species for me. Bullfinch, Linnet,
Siskin, Chaffinch, and Bunting eggs have been incubated by Canaries,
but the chicks have always been deserted within twenty-four hours of
hatching. This, of course, was more than half expected with regard
to the Chaffinch and Bunting.
All Chaffinches reared in my aviary were reared almost entirely
on earwigs, my Chaffinches would never feed on gentles to any extent.
The earwigs I obtained by placing dozens of discarded cotton garments
over a garden fence. When a garment was infested with earwigs,
I would drop the garment in a pail of hot water, and would get
thousands of earwigs this way, but, as other insect-eating birds were
in the same aviary, it was necessary to hang an extra nesting basket
in the alcove where the Chaffinches were nesting, The extra nesting
basket was used as a feeding pan, and only the nesting Chaffinches
were able to feed from this basket. The parent birds seemed to welcome
my interest in their nesting operations. I could examine the chicks
and the parent birds would continue to feed before I was out of the
aviary. Their joy was evident when a spider or a daddy-longlegs was

R. James--Rearing British Finches
left with a supply of earwigs. I have never known them feed their
young on anything but insects.
The first eggs I ever had from Yellow Buntings were forsaken
before the clutch was complete : this happened because I was curious
enough, and foolish enough, to try to make the site more secluded.
They made no other attempt to nest that year. On another occasion
a full clutch of eggs were deserted because I was curious enough to
have a peep, after they had been incubating for eight days. On the
last occasion three chicks hatched out and lived for seven days.
I dare not risk trying to provide extra food in the same way as the
Chaffinches were supplied; therefore the Buntings could not get enough
of the required food to feed and rear a brood of three. In the same
aviary were a pair each of Chaffinches, Reed Buntings, and Indian
Buntings. The Reed and Y ellow Buntings do not agree in the breeding
season, in an aviary. The Buntings built their nest between two old
tree stumps, only a few inches from the ground.
Control breeding does not appeal to me, half the charm is lost by
this method, and the chances are, to my way of thinking, almost as
heavily handicapped. In a small aviary, either the urge does not
last long enough for successful rearing, or the birds become bored,
and so develop unnatural habits, such as floor laying, egg breaking,
egg eating, or chicks thrown out of the nest. A healthy brawl with
a neighbour seems to inspire the birds to carry on. If a cock Finch can
defend his nest against something tangible, the breeding urge will
last, but when there is little space to afford interest, and no other
birds for him to drive away, he is likely to get bored, or have a " brain-
storm The confirmed " control breeder 5 ' cannot be expected to take
this summing-up seriously. I can only state that I have seen British
Finches act in the way mentioned. The Goldfinch especially loves to
quarrel and bicker at such times, but if he has nothing to do except
guard his hen from nothing, then he is likely to become uncon-
ventional.

I greatly hoped that a more scientific and experienced pen would
have been employed on this task, but this hope having proved vain,
I must do the best I can and ask my readers to be indulgent.
We met in Rouen on the 8th May and were instructed to betake
ourselves to the Secretariat to be registered members of the Congress
and receive our badges--very pretty little medallions adorned with
a pink Flamingo.
On the 9th the Congress was formally opened at the Hotel de Ville
and in the evening there was a reception at the same place.
On the 10th we were shown some most interesting films, one of
which by Professor A. Allen, of the Cornell University American
Museum of Natural History, not only showed us pictures and move-
ments of rare and disappearing American birds but gave their voices
and calls.
In the afternoon we were assembled in order to have our photo-
graphs taken, and later were invited to the Celebration of the Centenary
of the Jardin des Plantes followed by a garden party at the Orangery.
This was extremely interesting as we were shown the hot houses as
well as the garden where were many rare plants. The garden is very
well kept, and boasts some fine trees ; I was particularly struck with
a magnificent row of horse-chestnut trees, the highest I have ever seen,
and covered with bloom. Serins were seen and heard among the trees.
At night the Cathedral, St. Ouen Church, and the Palais de Justice
were flood-lighted, the effect was magical in its beauty.
The 11th will always be remembered as the day of the garden party
at Cleres. Madame and Monsieur Delacour most hospitably invited us
all to see the wonderful collection of birds in their beautiful grounds,
and gave us a bountiful tea. To see so many birds at liberty, Ducks,
Cranes, Flamingos, and Scarlet Ibises in full colour, feeding and
disporting themselves, gave me and, I do not doubt, all of us, the most
exquisite pleasure. The collection of tropical birds in the hot houses,

164 Account of the International Ornithological Congress
comprising Humming Birds, Fairy Blue Birds, Sun Birds, Cocks of the
Rock, and many others all in perfect condition and health showed
what could be done by means of moist heat.
On the 12th we were taken for a long drive in the lovely valley of
the Seine, through the Forest of Bretonne, Mauny and Roches d'Orivel.
These forests, nearly all beech, just then in their freshest green, are
extremely beautiful, but not very prolific in bird life. It must be
owned, however, that an invasion of from fifty to sixty people, all
talking, was not exactly calculated to encourage birds to show
themselves !
The noteworthy events were the sight of a Goshawk on her nest
which was shown us by the Foresters, finding a Stone Curlew's nest
on an open heath, and a couple of small birds' nests.
In the evening the town gave us a magnificent banquet, followed
by speeches from the President, Professor Ghigi, and the Mayor of
Rouen and others.
On the 13th we saw more films : a wonderful slow motion of a
Humming Bird's flight showing the movement of the wings ; Captain
Knight's " Something New of Africa ", Secretary Birds, Crowned Eagles,
and Hammerheads nesting and feeding young ; the display of the Great
Bustard and, perhaps the best of all, Herr Siewert's " Year in the Life
of an Elk ", which not only showed us these magnificent creatures in
their homes, and as they have their being, but included the birds
to be found there, a Bittern with her nest, Black Storks, and others.
A really marvellous achievement. The same afternoon Captain Sutton
gave a lecture on birds he had seen during his recent expedition in
Mexico, very beautifully painted from life by himself. These showed
many birds which were practically unknown to ornithologists.
Dr. Chapin gave us an account of his newly discovered African
Peacock and encouraged us to hope that it may be seen in this country
before many years have passed, as it should not be difficult to rear.
This brought the first part of the Congress to its close. We left
hospitable, charming Rouen with regret, feeling very grateful for the
kindness shown us, and repaired to Paris, where on the 14th May
we were received by the Director and Professors of the Museum at the
Galerie de Botanique ; on the 15th we were shown round the Zoological

arrangements for the comfort of the animals and their first-rate con-
dition--the giraffes especially, and the bears. We saw the kitchen,
beautifully clean and well arranged, and the stores of food and pro-
visions for the animals. Eeally a model zoo.
Then came one more reception at the close of the Congress.
It should be noticed and will be to the gratification of our Members
that the President of the Congress, Professor Ghigi, and of course
Monsieur Delacour, the Secretary, are eminent Members of the
Avicultural Society. Aviculture, indeed, was much to the fore.
Mr. Sibley's lecture on " Hybridization of American Ducks " and
Mr. L. S. Crandall's on " Display Forms of Birds of Paradise " ;
Dr. Lorenz's amusing film on the Psychology of the Grey Goose,
and Dr. Stolpe's " Flight of Humming Birds ", already mentioned,
were all thoroughly avicultural.
I cannot close this account without saying how much we all owe
to Monsieur Delacour. In spite of grave anxiety and much extra work
through the serious illness of Mr. Fooks, he was always with us, kind,
patient, and most capable, without him the Congress would not have
been anything like the success it undoubtedly was.

methods adopted by this fancier are by no means orthodox, which
makes many of his achievements all the more remarkable. However,
Mr. Conant has kept a film record of some of his experiments, which
leaves no room for doubt, otherwise some of the stories would sound
rather fantastic to most of us.
The Jackdaws in question are hand-reared, 1935 birds. Two hens
from one nest and one male from another district. All three birds
are housed in an aviary, some 30 feet long, 12 feet wide, and 9 feet high.
At each end of the aviary is fixed a box, near the roof, about 18 inches
square, with a round hole cut out of one side of each box, the hole
being 6 inches in diameter. In the spring of 1936 the cock bird mated
with one hen, and has at all times refused to mate with the spare hen,
in spite of repeated invitation to do so. A rough nest was built by the
mated pair--the cock finding most of the material, the hen would
discard anything she considered unsuitable. The owner of the birds,
acting on advice, removed the spare hen, after which all nesting
operations were discontinued and the nest was destroyed by the mated
pair. The spare hen was then returned to the aviary. The mated
pair then built another nest, and five eggs duly appeared, the
eggs were incubated (chiefly by the hen), for a week, and then the
eggs disappeared, it was thought the Jackdaws had eaten the eggs.
In the spring of 1937 the same birds built another nest, in the
same box, and again the spare hen was taken to another aviary ; as
a result, nesting operations again discontinued, and nest destroyed.
The spare hen was again returned to the Jackdaw aviary, nesting
operations were then resumed, and a clutch of eggs duly appeared.
A strict watch was kept as incubation proceeded, the eggs began to
disappear, and it was found that rats were the culprits. This must
have happened in the night, and it seems the Jackdaws would repair
the nest in the morning, and continue to incubate what eggs were
left. All eggs disappeared eventually, and so another season was lost.
The following autumn the aviary was reconstructed and made rat-proof.
The spare hen was kept with the mated pair the whole time after this,
and a nest was built again in the spring of 1938, and six eggs were
counted on the 22nd April. The nest was again examined on the
14th May, when seven eggs were counted. On the 16th May it was

found the eggs had began to hatch ; it is not known how many chicks
there are. It is hoped that Dr. Hopkinson can be persuaded to visit,
examine, and then report, but this must wait until Mr. Conant can
reasonably expect to rear the birds to maturity. After which, I feel
sure, a complete account--giving all detail--would be welcomed for
publication in the Avicultural Magazine. The male Jackdaw will
thrash the spare hen when she calls for a mate, at other times they
are a happy family.
MACAWS BRED IN CONFINEMENT. II
By Dr. E. Hopkinson
Thanks to Mons. Delacour and others I can now amplify the list
of Macaws bred in confinement, which appeared on p. 88 of the
Magazine, and at the same time regret my slip about the red Aras.
I always do (and probably shall) confuse these two names, and should
rather call macao the Scarlet Macaw and chloroptera, the Green-winged.
However, that is by the way, and only shows that nomenclature can
be another pitfall into which one can easily fall, for not only has the
present writer fallen heavily, but the same has happened to the
corrector, for in his notes " Red and Blue Macaw " appears for both
the birds.
In the following list, a summary (as abbreviated as possible),
the Latin names, about which there is more certainty, are given first
place, and I hope that now the list is more or less correct, but further
corrections and additions will be gratefully accepted.

I can now officially announce that the O.P.S. summer general
meeting will take place on Thursday, 21st July, at the offices of the
London Zoological Society. Our meeting will be held at 11 a.m. in the
morning and this will be followed by a luncheon in the Zoological
Gardens. Members of the Avicultural Society will now probably
know that an Avicultural Society general meeting will be held on the
same day but in the afternoon. It is hoped that by holding the two
meetings on the same day many members of both Societies will be
convenienced. I am convinced that all members of the O.P.S. who are
members of the Avicultural Society will attend both meetings and
I am hoping that at the O.P.S. meeting I shall have the pleasure of
taking some names of our members who wish to join the Avicultural
Society. There is no nomination required for membership of the
O.P.S. and so I anticipate that some members of the Avicultural
Society may feel inclined to attend our meeting in the morning and
join at the same time. I will mention that the subscription is a modest
6s. per annum and the two half-yearly journals are inclusive of this

also we publish two coloured plates with each publication. The
Secretary of the American O.P.S., Mr. C. Sibley, is at present in this
country and I shall have the pleasure of meeting him before these
notes are printed. We intend to exchange notes and we are both
confident that our Societies will benefit by such conversations. The
American phasianists have not rallied to this society as Mr. Sibley
had hoped. In a recent issue of the American Modern Gamebreeding
(the organ of the O.P.S.) Mr. Sibley made a most pleading appeal for
more support. My father, stirred by this appeal, wrote some of his
friends and will have the pleasure of informing Mr. Sibley that he has
secured fifteen new members for the American O.P.S., rather good
going that. For the benefit of readers of these notes I will mention
that the subscription to this O.P.S. is 10s. per annum and for this sum
their splendid year book is sent out and also every month the Modern
Gamebreeding. This is a splendid magazine and deals not only with
aviary birds but all varieties of sport such as shooting, fishing, etc.
It is possible, in fact probable, that some of my readers may care to
join and if so I shall be most pleased to receive the subscription and
pass it on to Mr. Sibley. I can also forward a sample copy of the paper
just mentioned, and if anyone cares to send me a card I will post one
by return. In this manner I hope to be able to gladden the heart of
Mr. Sibley. He is an untiring worker and deserves a much larger
membership. Will you help him to carry on ?

My jottings last month said that the Mexican Sandhill Cranes had
gone to nest and were sitting. The first chick hatched out on the
30th April and the other one twenty-four hours later, nice strong
little birds covered with bright foxy red down, with long pink legs
and necks, and a very alert inquiring expression in their round bright
eyes. The old birds were and are most attentive to them, fed them
assiduously, and brooded them at intervals during the day as well as

at night. A store of well-cleaned gentles was in readiness, and on these
and finely-chopped bullock's heart the babies throve and grew apace.
They were quick to learn how to pick up food for themselves in addition
to all the insects and other titbits supplied by their parents. Nor were
they long in displaying something of the family temper, for when
the elder chick was three days old its mother accidentally brushed
against it and toppled it over. As soon as it had righted itself it turned
on the younger chick and pecked it viciously until their mother firmly
sat down on both of them.
As a rule each old bird takes charge of one chick--I do not know if
it is always the same one, I fancy not ; but it is difficult to tell them
apart.
Pheasants have laid well, but a considerable percentage of their
eggs are infertile. This, I understand, has been the common experience
this year, perhaps the abnormal weather accounts for it ? The chicks
that have hatched seem vigorous. Imperial Pheasants produced many
eggs but all infertile, though the birds look to be in the best of health
and condition. Scintillans is another failure: all his bluster and fury
have not produced one fertile egg, but unabashed he still challenges
all and sundry.
The Orinoco Geese only gave us one gosling, a pretty little black
and white thing which lived but twenty-four hours, and whose corpse
was gratefully accepted by the South Kensington Museum bird
department.
They are laying again and may do better this time. Ashy-headed
and Emperor Geese both have eggs and a mixed collection of Ducks'
eggs is gathered daily. Kooks were a menace, even taking eggs out of
the nest-boxes until one or two paid the penalty and were hung up
as a warning to evildoers.
The Blue Crossoptilons laid a vast number of eggs in a common
nest with w r hat result remains to be seen ; they are masterful termagants
who believe in keeping their husbands in subjection and live up to
their theories. The surprising thing is that the husbands, though
armed with good sharp spurs, are magnanimous or chicken-hearted
enough to put up with this treatment.

WADERS, ETC.
By A. F. Moody
In reply to Mr. James' recent articles in the Avicultural
Magazine referring to Waders and the rearing of our commoner
British birds, may I as an aviculturist and a keen lover of birds
in the wild, say that for upwards of thirty years I have never been
without several species of Waders ; that as a group they are charming
birds to study and not difficult to keep. Real success, however, as with
many other families of birds, depends largely upon their owners'
ornithological knowledge and a readiness to make the best of artificial
conditions and render their immediate surroundings as natural as
possible.
Great pleasure also can be derived from the keeping and breeding
of quite common British Finches, etc. At one time and another I have
kept various common species ; our usual procedure being to enjoy
the pleasure (take notes, etc.) of rearing a species once, then liberate
parents and young the first autumn or the following spring.
As of possible interest I append extracts from my diaries for 1907,
1909, and 1911, dealing with the rearing of three well-known species
in the Scampston Hall aviaries.
B rambling (Fringilla montifringilla ).---The species has but once
had an opportunity of nesting here, when, during the summer of
1907, the following observations were taken from a very ragged male
(a dealer's bird) and a fine locally-caught female of the previous
autumn. 30th May : About this time the male completed his nuptial
dress, began to sing and otherwise behave as a breeding bird. 1st July :
The pair began to build, choosing as a nesting site an old and partly
decayed Blackbird's nest which had the year previously been stuffed
into a growing hawthorn bush, at a height of about 4 feet from the
ground.
6th July : Nest completed, in appearance very Chaffinch-like,
differing only in being slightly larger and not so compact. 7th July :
The first of a clutch of five very Chaffinch-like eggs laid. 11th July :
Incubation appeared to commence. 2nd August : Two young males

left the nest. These were successfully reared, and rapidly assumed
a plumage not unlike the adult in winter dress.
Nestlings .--Covered with dull whitish down. Four hatched, two
of which died at an early age.
Siskin (Chrysomitris s&apos;pinus). -- From a pair which enjoyed the
range of a roomy aviary, two broods--a four and a three were reared
in 1909. Nest, rather like that of the Spotted Flycatcher, built in
yew bushes at a height of about 6 feet from the ground. Eggs, five
and four in number ; incubation, thirteen to fourteen days. It was
observed that the broods left the nest on the thirteenth and fourteenth
day respectively, and that on the date when the first brood left the
nest, 10th August, the female ceased to assist the male to feed the
first brood, and commenced to sit upon a second clutch of eggs.
The young males on leaving the nest differed from the females by
showing a greater amount of yellow in their plumage.
Bullfinch [PynJmla europsea). --1911. A pair of Bullfinches were
given an opportunity of nesting. Being hand-reared examples of the
previous season, they were very tame and confiding. At the same time
they proved most indifferent breeders, or rather, I should say, rearers,
for although several typical nests were built and young hatched on
two or three occasions, they only succeeded in rearing two young
(a pair) late in the season, after having neglected the previous broods.
As to the behaviour, etc., of the birds at the nest : It was observed
that an average nest occupied four days in building ; that both took
an equal share in the labour, and at intervals sat in the nest before
the eggs were laid ; after which the female only incubated. The eggs
were laid on successive days, roughly about 8 a.m. Incubation in
the only timed instance lasted thirteen days, the young leaving the
nest on the thirteenth and fourteenth day.
All the species mentioned reared, the parents having access to a
mixed seed pan, a frequently renewed bunch of weeds containing half-
ripened seed heads, and such insects as they could procure.

Madam, --For a bird to display when suffering from a fatal illness is, of
course, a very rare phenomenon and it is indeed strange that it should ever
occur at all. Until recently I had observed it only in two species--Princess of
Wales' Parrakeet and Banksian Cockatoo. A tame male of the latter displayed
slightly to a gardener to whom he was very devoted, when the latter paid him
a visit.

<bodyText confidence="0.984285" page_id="56318923"  page_num="173" year="" vol="">
mates and, when tame, to human friends. I once had a pair of Princess of
Wales' ill at the same time and, when they met in the hospital, they displayed
to each other, a rather pathetic sight as it proved to be the cock's farewell,
for he died a few days later.
Recently a New Guinea King Parrakeet qualified for a place on the list
of heroic invalids. He was suffering from catarrh and cirrhosis of the liver
and was ill for some weeks, but almost up to the last he would display to
a woman visitor. His courtesy in dire adversity was all the more strange
in that the species is one of the most morose of Parrakeets. The Banksian
is a born gentleman and the Princess of Wales a born philanderer, but the
Salwatty King has no manners at all for his own kind and habitually greets
even his wife with an open beak and a volley of bad language.
Yours very truly,
Tavistock.
Madam,-- Replying to Dr. W. L. English's note on the Kea Parrot, it
would, perhaps, be of interest to compare our experience of a pair of N. notabilis
in Dr. J. M. Derscheid's collection, especially as it differs widely in several
respects.
Our Keas were very shy, retiring to the darkest corners of the shelter
on catching sight of anyone, and it was only on account of their great fondness
for mealworms that we were able to gain their confidence : the cock will
now take mealworms from us at the front of the aviary and is often waiting
there for more, but the hen will not, as yet, come within 6 feet.
This pair will quickly destroy perches or any exposed woodwork in the
aviary and it is evident that their beaks are extremely strong and sharp.
The feet certainly appear to be rather weak and no more capable of
effective grasping than are those of the Cyanorhamphus Parrakeets, which,
in general formation, they rather resemble ; but the beak, though hardly
suited to cracking hard nuts, would, I think, be easily capable of making
a deep incision, and I consider that the Kea would find it much more difficult
to cling to the back of a frantic sheep than to tear the hide and flesh.
These birds do not, I believe, readily bite when handled : they seem to be
too intelligent to be easily panic-stricken.

A few days ago our pair somehow caught a Sparrow on the roof of the
aviary and pulled it through the wire-netting; they appeared to have eaten
most of it, for the total amount of wreckage we found was far less than the
bulk of a Sparrow.
The Keas are extremely amusing and are great personalities, making
by comparison most other Parrots appear quite characterless.

J. J. Ye ALL AND.
Dear Sir,-- In reply to your inquiry in the Avicultural Magazine.
Your bird must be Lophospingus pusillus from Argentina. A lot arrived about
September last and Palmer, the dealer near the Zoo, had all or most. A first
arrival. He (or friends) called them " Palmer Finches " (sometimes even
"Huntley and Palmer Finches"). Brabourne and Chubb gives them the
English name of " Black-crested Finch ", but that is a name of no standing,
for no one who wants English names like bird-fanciers had ever seen them
before. However, it will do as well as anything else. As regards sex difference,
the B.M. Catalogue only says that the female is similar but slightly smaller.
I hope your " Corbatitas " will arrive safely. I shall be interested to hear
what they are in case they are a rare Sporophila (almost sure to be one of
that genus). They are certainly not " Bib Finches ". They come from
Madagascar.
I send this answer direct as you probably would like it before the Magazine
comes out, but you might let the Editress know that I identify them as
above.
I have seen two or three in friends' collections. They appear reasonably
hardy, and do chiefly on the usual seed plus plenty of green grass.
Yours truly,
(Dr.) E. Hopkinson.
Dear Sir, --I am much obliged to you for the trouble you have taken
in replying to my inquiry in the Avicultural Magazine as to the identity
of the little " Black-crested Finch " I lately purchased and which, I am glad
to say, is doing very well: he has come into nice feather and is now very
tame, being quite content with a plain seed diet and a supply of flowering grass,
which, I agree with you, is a valuable, in fact the natural, food for many small
Finches. He also likes a mealworm now and then.
I think the term " Black-crested " should stand for this elegant little
bird, since the crest is his really very marked feature and, as far as I know,
there is no other small bird which, proportionately, has one so long and graceful.
I see he comes from the Argentine, home of many beautiful birds, some
of which (fortunately, perhaps) are, I know, rarely or never brought over;
but though I resided for some twenty years in the River Plate countries,
I never came across him.
My " Corbatitas " duly arrived, two very sorry little scrubs, but they are
picking up and moulting out nicely, April-May corresponding, of course.

to autumn in their native land. Out there they are common enough and cost
but a trifle, though I do not remember having seen them in England, and they
could only be rare in the sense that they are seldom imported, perhaps because
they are unattractive in coloration.
They are chubby, blunt-billed birds, of about the size and type, I think,
of the " Cuba " Finch : the female is of a dull olive grey throughout, without
markings, and the male generally of a dullish black, darker on the head, and
having a little black " cravat " bordered with white and then a broad band of
black across the breast, the rest of the under parts being light grey : he has
none of the greenish tinge of the female.
So far, they eat only canary seed--and flowering grass--exception made
of a ripe grape, which many Finches, even Canaries, I find get very fond of.
I might add that the friend who brought them over very kindly, by way
of a surprise, added two " Superb " Tanagers which arrived in nice condition,
and (to my chagrin) tried to bring besides from Brazil two Scarlet Tanagers
and two, different, Hang-nests, but he not being an " expert " the poor things
shared the fate of so many beautiful birds bought by passengers and put
on board without proper food supply and in the flimsy, open bamboo cages
which, in the tropics, seem adequate, on shore. Modern motor-ships too are
very " cold " down below, compared with the old steam vessels, when once
they pass the warm latitudes. I have told my friend "Never, never again !"
unless with an adequate travelling-cage, such as the Finches and " Superbs ' '
occupied.
I will pass on your letter to the Editress of the Avicultural Magazine,
and thanking you again for the information you have given me, I am,
Yours faithfully,
H. C. Martin.
PS.--I may say that I found the Crested Finch at Gamage's and could
not resist buying the last but one : I note that Palmer's had some too, at about
the same time, so they will probably come again.

Birds of Canada. By P. A. Taverner. Published by John
Murray, Albermarle Street, London, W. 1. 18s. net.
This large handsome volume deals with all kinds of birds known
to occur in Canada, with the purpose of awakening and stimulating
interest in their study and to assist in identifying native species, and
certainly anyone who makes this book his companion can claim more
than a nodding acquaintance with them.

The numerous coloured plates are by the Museum's bird artist,
Allan Brooks, the text-figures with few exceptions are from the pen
of the author, P. A. Taverner.
A lengthy and very clearly written " introduction " is followed
by an illustrated " key " to enable students to determine the species
of any bird they may come across. Following on this we have the
description of all species found in Canada with small illustrations in
the text, the name in French as well as in English, distinctions, field
works, nesting, and distribution, the economic status, food and habits,
and whether in need of and deserving protection. The index is in
English and French, and another to check list numbers, in short no
pains have been spared to make the book useful and attractive to
the student as well as the man who without specializing likes to know
something of the birds he comes across in his daily life.
The only objection to the book is its size and weight, which render
it a formidable addition to one's luggage if travelling, and altogether
impossible to carry about on bird-watching expeditions. Perhaps
when another edition is called for it would be possible to split the book
into two or even three parts for convenience' sake. As it stands it is
a volume to adorn the bookshelf and one which every Canadian should
be proud to possess.

THE PAIRING DISPLAY OF BULWER'S
PHEASANT
(Lobiophasis bulweri Sharpe)
By 0. Heinroth

Reprinted from Journal fur Ornithologie, 86, No. 1, 1938, by kind permission of
the Author.
In the last few years a few Bulwer Pheasants of both sexes have
reached Europe, first of all the London Zoological Gardens and the
Pheasantry of J. Spedan Lewis near London, then M. J. Delacour at
Cleres, to the north of Paris. On 27th November, 1930, a cock not in
plumage arrived at the Berlin Zoological Garden, which during the
following summer assumed its gorgeous feathers and lived until the
21st July, 1932.
The species Lobiophasis, which only consists of one kind and is
distributed over the interior of Borneo, resembles most closely the
Lophura ; in his monograph on Pheasants, vol. ii, pp. 146-165,
Beebe has collected probably all that is known about their life in natural
surroundings. According to his observations, the birds have two chicks
which are accompanied by the parents. The cock, which is very
conspicuous through its white tail, leaves the nest at the least alarm,
whereas the insignificant chicks and hens remain motionless and quiet.

The shape and colour of the cock bird may be seen from the accom-
panying illustrations ^ besides the blue facial lobes the snow-white
tail is particularly characteristic and on closer examination is remark-
able in that it consists of 15 to 16 pairs of feathers, the largest number
of any bird. According to Beebe, the hen has only 26 tail feathers and
the cock when not in full plumage 24 ; the increase to 30-32 comes
about by the middle upper tail covering growing into tail feathers.
The outer 6-7 pairs are not tipped and have the appearance of being
worn down ; however, they are like this from the beginning, so that
" they come into the world worn I would class them as scraping
feathers, for during pairing they are pressed against the ground as the
bird moves forward and produce a rustling sound among the leaves.
Beebe noticed that in the wild state dry leaves were actually impaled
on these feathers.
In the autumn of 1930 the freshly plumaged cock-bird started to
display (it was kept completely in the open air in a section of the
Pheasantry together with some other Pheasants) and continued to do
so until the cold weather set in, recommencing in the early spring.
One yellow-tailed hen Pheasant (Acomus erythrophthalmus (Raffles)
attached herself to him and became the object of his attentions, but
mating was, however, not observed and the hen laid no eggs. The
cock moulted in the late autumn, when almost all the tail feathers fell,
and about eight weeks later they had completely grown again.
Since the bird generally remained in the rear part of its enclosure
and was often concealed under the leaves and grass, it was very
difficult to photograph. The water-colour in my possession,
which was painted by my wife, Kathe, formed the basis of the
coloured plate and was itself reproduced from a photograph and
also from my observations of the living bird. I can therefore vouch
for its correctness, since I have very frequently seen the cock bird
displaying. In the picture of the bird its lack of corpulence is quite
correct, for it has an incredibly flat appearance which makes it difficult
to ascertain the shape. It looks to a certain extent as if a large white
disc had been inserted from behind into a plaquette, all detail being
rather blurred. The right and left halves of the tail lie evenly on each
other, which is rather strange, as one thinks involuntarily of the wheel-

shaped tail-spread of the Fantailed Pigeon. It is also contrary to one's
conception of anatomy that the front edge of the tail should proceed
along the back as far as behind the head.
The pictures in Beebe's work give an entirely wrong idea of the colour
of the lobes ; when excited they are, strange to say, sky-blue, without
any intermixture of wine-red colouring, and the upper portions deepen
into a velvety black, in strong contrast with the white palette of the
tail. In this condition the beak is not visible and the blue is only relieved
by the ruby-red of the eye, which is particularly noticeable owing to its
red surround. As a rule, when displaying, the bird struts slowly about
and stands still with a jerk when the hen bird comes close up to him.
It is then that the head lobes attain their maximum inflation.
The following results have been found anatomically: Only the
middle tail feathers have grown into one with the bony pygostyle, the
others being rooted in the strong muscles of the rump, so that during
pairing display they can be pressed sideways and down hard on the
ground. In flight only the inner tail feathers would seem to retain their
roof-shaped position, and the others form a horizontal supporting
surface as in the case of other gallinaceous birds. Stresemann makes
the following observations in this connection: " The upper tail
coverings quickly diminish outwardly in length, the upper layer of
feathers of the sixth to the third tail feathers (from outside) is concealed
under the . . . feathers of the back and ' therefore ' not altogether white
but of an inconspicuous brown colour. The first and second tail feathers
(from outside) have absolutely no upper layer of feathers belonging to
them. The lower set of tail covering feathers is completely lacking."
The internal composition of the head lobes was examined by
Ad. Schneider immediately after the death of the cock-bird. Its dilation
during pairing display is caused by the injection of blood and not by
air being pumped in (cf. the work mentioned below).
When frightened, especially when its enclosure is intruded upon,
the cock bird uttered a soft monotonous " Gack " ; at the height of the
pairing season it emitted a shrill, piercing cry, but otherwise was silent,
having no call-note or crowing sound.
Beebe gives the weights of dead cock-birds as being from 2f to

MY BLACKCAPPED LORY

<bodyText confidence="0.998972" page_id="56318940"  page_num="180" year="" vol="">
When I receive our Magazine at the beginning of each month,
my first look is always for articles describing the successful or un-
successful breeding of a rare bird. Tastes differ, but I think a good
many of our members share my opinion, and care less for articles on
birds which are kept as pets.
I must therefore ask them to be lenient with me, when I write
to-day a few lines about a bird which was purely a pet or rather a
companion, to me.
Many years ago, on a hot, sultry afternoon, I was sitting in my
office in Shanghai disgusted with the East and with the world in
general. The thermometer registered 95 degrees in the shade, now and
then a fine shower poured down, making tennis after office hours
impossible, and the temperature felt like a hothouse. On days like
these one hates the East, and longs for the cool mountains of one's
home country.
I was just closing for the day, when the office boy entered and
announced : " Master, birdman have come."
" Well, something interesting after all," I thought, when my
faithful bird-dealer-friend came in and greeted me with his ever-
pleasant smile. Koo's visits were always very welcome, for not only
did they mean a pleasant chat, but as a rule also the arrival of some
rare birds or animals in his shop in the native city. It is true that
these rarities were not always suitable for me. On one occasion it was
a colossal Chinese tiger which Koo offered to me, and another time
when he had told me he had a very nice pair of small wild chickens, I
found a pair of common Moorhens. But this time it was a new Parrot

which Koo wanted me to inspect. " Can he talk," I asked. " By
and by," was Koo's reply, informing me that the parrot in question
could not talk, but would certainly learn it, as all Parrots are supposed
to do, which are offered to a purchaser in China.
To visit the native city on a hot sultry day is not a real pleasure,
so 1 promised my man that I would come as soon as the weather
was better. After a few days we had cooler and drier weather, and
I hurried to my friend's shop, where I found the subject of our conversa-
tion on a wooden stand. If one finds a Parrot on such a stand on which
they are brought from their native habitats, one can be almost sure
that the bird is hand-reared and tame. But the Parrot did not look
at all nice, his wings and his tail were cut, and his whole plumage
was dirty and rough. I saw at once that I had a Lory before me,
but could not feel sure which kind. Lories are charming birds, but
their feeding and keeping entails a good deal more trouble than that
of a seed-eating Parrot. As I had already about a dozen softbills to
care for, I hesitated to buy the bird. Yet he seemed in good health
and tame, and so I could not resist him, and after a little bargaining
without which no deal in China can be completed, I got the treasure
for the moderate sum of $10.0, about one pound English money.
Arrived at home I freed Polly from his coco-nut shackle and put him
in a large bamboo cage. Then I fetched my " Beichenow ", an excellent
book to identify a bird. Soon I had found that my new acquisition
was a black-capped Lory from Dutch New Guinea with the scientific
name Lorius viridicrissals, not a common bird, anyhow. The next
day I tried to make friends with Polly, but he would have nothing to
do with me.
In the dealer's shop I could take him on my hand, but in the big
cage without ring and chain, he retreated into the farthest corner.
" Well, by and by we shall be friends," I thought, and I was certainly
not disappointed. After about two weeks he approached me when
feeding him, soon he tried to examine my hand, and after a month he
had become the tamest and most intelligent bird I ever possessed.
As soon as I opened his cage, he flew on my hand or shoulder, and the
latter was for ever his favourite place. I often took him to the little
garden in front of the house. Here he climbed and jumped about in

the trees, but soon he found it a dull game. Half flying half jumping,
he reached the veranda. If he found me here sitting in my wicker
chair, he was satisfied, was I not on the veranda he looked for me in
the dining and sitting-room. If his search was here also vain, he
flew through pantry and yard into the kitchen, where usually his
second best friend, my Chinese servant, was busy, whose shoulder he
now climbed eagerly. Even upstairs and downstairs he followed me.
Sometimes when my messmate and myself were lying in our easy chairs
on the veranda, both clad in white, Polly climbed by mistake my friend's
chair. But at once he noticed his error, and quickly flew to me. Also
in the evening after dinner he still wanted to be with me, and was often
lying on his back in my lap.
Strangers, however, Polly did not like, and sometimes bit them
severely, while I or my boy could do anything with him without ever
being bitten. During the night his cage stood in my bedroom. As
soon as my boy lifted the cover in the morning and opened the cage,
Polly flew on my bed and played here with me like a little kitten.
When I went to my bathroom, he followed me quickly and took a
great interest in my toilet. When I was sitting in the bath, he flew
on my hand and took from there a really good ablution. Bathiug was
altogether one of Polly's favourite pastimes. On the veranda he had
a big tub in which he rolled and splashed daily to his heart's delight.
Only on very cold days he missed his bath. Consequently he became
a very beautiful bird. When he had been two months in my possession
he went through a complete moult, and was now in full resplendence
of wonderful colours of red, violet, ultramarine, and green. Without
teaching him, he soon started to talk. Of course, he spoke his name,
called my boy " Agar " mostly when he was hungry, and greeted
me with " hallo " when I went to his cage. Often he said, with rather
a deep voice, " Good, good Polly," and immediately afterwards
imitating my boy, " so bad Polly." When I covered his cage for the
night, one could hear " Sleep, Polly, sleep." He never slept on the
perch, but always in a nesting box I had provided for him. Besides
this, he laughed, whistled, imitated my Shama, and tried to accompany
the gramophone in songs without words. Of other Parrots, Polly
was very jealous, small Parakeets he did not mind, but as soon as I

tried to keep an Eclectus or another Lory, he got so excited that I had
to refrain from having another Parrot. As food Polly had the usual
mixture of Mellin's with condensed milk, besides bread and milk, and
often a simple rice pudding, besides all fruit in season. This simple
nourishment suited Polly evidently very well, for he was always in the
best of condition and as lively as a cricket.
To my deep and everlasting regret, Polly had, like so many birds
which are kept as pets, a sad end. I had been on long leave in Europe,
and on my return was living in an hotel.
Soon the guests complained of the noise Polly made in the morning,
and to avoid unpleasantness I took him to my office. Here he was
liked by everybody. Many a hearty laugh I heard from my Chinese
customers when in the middle of an animated conversation and bargain-
ing, Polly shouted " Lalilung " (robber).
On a busy mail day, Polly sat on my shoulder as usual. I had to
leave my little private office to fetch a book, and put Polly on the
chair. I could not find the book, and Polly, missing me, flew into the
general office in search of me.
But unfortunately he missed my shoulder and landed on the floor.
At the same moment a strange cat appeared through the open door
on the scene, and seized Polly. He gave a fearful screech, and the cat
let him go. I carefully examined him, could not detect anything,
and put him into his cage. But the next morning I found Polly on
the bottom of the cage in a very bad condition. His whole head was
swollen, evidently blood-poisoning had set in. T took him out, and he
died in my hand.
You can imagine my feelings. I have possessed hundreds of birds,
but never have I regretted the loss of one as much as that of my Lory.
I tried to replace Polly, and had several Lories afterwards, Black-
caps, Bubras, etc., but none could equal him, and he will never be
forgotten.

Once more this most enjoyable day has come and gone. The weather
this year decided to be tiresome. Why will people pray for rain, when
we want to enjoy the sunshine ? However, as the happy party proceeded
onwards from Hyde Park Corner to Foxwarren Park, the clouds
began to lift, and the rain finally stopped ; and by the time we reached
our destination the sun was shining.
After being cordially greeted by Mr. and Mrs. Ezra and family,
we proceeded to inspect the aviaries, headed as usual by our host.
It was a cool day, and I think we all very much enjoyed the long
ramble through the beautiful grounds seeing all the treasures of
Mr. Ezra's unique collection. These are, as most of you know, under
the very able care of Shearing, who has very kindly supplied me with
some of the names of the varieties kept--not by any means all, as there
are I believe over a thousand birds !
In the big flights so ideally planted with shrubs and containing
large pools there are many Waders, etc., Stilts, Avocets, Water Thick-
knees, Yellow, Yellow-wattled, White-fronted, Banded, Black-winged,
Gaysons, Crowned and Blacksmith's Plovers, the last-named with
two engaging little youngsters, the second year these have been bred.
Reeves and Ruffs, a never failing attraction to visitors with their
amusing display, Curlews, Godwits, Oyster-catchers, Sun Bitterns.
There is a wonderful collection of Pigeons and Doves, including
</bodyText>
<reference confidence="0.969034">
Victoria, and Common Crowned, Crested, Bronzewdngs in several
varieties, Papuan, Golden Heart, Bleeding Heart, and hybrids ; Snow,
Pheasant-tailed, Triangular Spotted, Wonga-Wonga, White and Lilac
Crowned, and several species of exquisite Fruit Pigeons. Doves include
Tambourines, Emerald and Sapphire Spotted, Dwarf Turtle, Bar-
tailed, Necklace, Jobi Island, White-fronted, Zebra, Imperial, Fruit,
and Galapagos. Of Jays and Pies there are Eastern Blue, Stellas,
Japanese, Loochoo, Formosan Blue, Yellow-billed, Blue Lanceolated;
these with Lort's and Broad-billed Rollers all in finest condition look

too wonderful flying about in the ideal surroundings, so do the Weavers
and Wydahs, many of which were still in full colour, the Giants in
two varieties were lovely ; also Grenadiers, Napoleon, Taha,
Reichenow's, Cinnamon, Yellow-backed, Masked, Paradise, Red-
shouldered, and Madagascar.
Other birds in these aviaries were various Bulbuls, Silver-eared
Mesias, Laurina's Mesias Dyal Birds, and Shamas, Fairy Bluebirds,
always lovely, Regent and Satin Bower-birds, Evening Grosbeaks,
Hoopoes, Sulphury Water Tyrant, and the very graceful Fork-tailed
Tyrant, I called it Scissor-tailed last year ! There are also beautiful
Kingfishers, various Partridges including Roulroul, Madagascar,
Mountain, and Californian ; also Chinese Painted Quail and numerous
Waxbills and many kinds of small Finches including the rare Natterers
Finch.
Mr. Ezra has a fine collection of Parakeets, many of them breeding ;
there are two varieties of Ringnecks, the Green and the Yellow.
Alexandrines, Yellow, Blue, and Green ; Bayards, Malabars, Queen
Alexandra most beautiful of all, Hooded, Elegant, Pennant, Mealey,
Rosella, Barraband, Green-winged King, and Crimson-winged.
There is a fine pair of the rare Guilding's Amazon and a pair of the
lovely Leadbeater's Cockatoo. In special aviaries for breeding there
are pairs of Formosan Blue Pies, Hunting Cissas, Short-tailed Ant
Thrushes, Racket-tailed Drongos, Dwarf Hermit Thrushes, Rothschild's
Grackles (bred here already), pairs of Mountain and Western Bluebirds ;
and in solitary splendour an Albino Carrion Crow.
After viewing and duly admiring this magnificent display of birds
Mr. Ezra took us through some of the Crane enclosures ; besides
a flock of the exquisite Demoiselles and many Sarus, he has the graceful
Stanleys, the Manchurian, and others ; and he showed us with pride
a pair of Mexican Sandhill Cranes, he had recently received as a present.
I understand the Sarus nest away from home, what a lovely sight they
must be flying !
We next visited the bird house where there were many rare birds

including Paradise Tanagers, Bolivian Yellow-bellied Tanagers,
Strickland's Shama, Macklots, and the Great China Pitta, the Lesser

The visitors, among whom were many well-known people, were
then asked to go indoors, where the usual sumptuous tea and refresh-
ments were served, and much appreciated by all. Among the large
gathering was a distinguished visitor from New York who came with
Mrs. Seth-Smith, and Sir David Ezra over from India was one of the
family circle.
After tea, I left to visit a friend, who lives not far away ; but
Mr. Terry Jones sent me the following notes of what took place when
the waterfowl, etc., were inspected. He says, " The first birds I noticed
were great numbers of wild Turtle Doves, and a lovel/ flock of domestic
Pigeons, Croppers, and Polish Lynx given to Mrs. Ezra originally by
Mr. Whitby. A Green-winged Trumpeter came running to see us.
By the first pond were Chestnut-breasted Shelduck and Common
Shelduck, Combduck, and on the pond were Bernicle Geese, Tufted
Duck, and Pochard, and a pair of Black Swans. Lower down we met an
Emperor Goose, grey, laced with dark grey, a white head and neck
with a black throat. We saw the two types of specific Peafowl, one
with blue neck and the other with a golden green neck. The Burmese
and the Indo-Chinese I believe. The Madagascar White-backed Duck,
a most curious Grebe-like bird without a trace of white on its back,
is still thriving and breeding. I believe Mr. Ezra is the only one who
breeds them. The Black-necked Swans had a brood. There was a pair
of the lovely Eytons or Plumed Tree Duck, a very rare and beautiful
bird, with long bull flank feathers, curling over its back like Japanese
chrysanthemum petals. Other species seen were the Fulvous, Black-
billed, Wandering, White-faced Java, White-winged Wood Ducks,
Albina, Bahama, Pintail, Pigmy Teal; one very rare Pinkhead Duck.
The whole head and neck is shell pink, the body a rich warm chocolate.
Mandarin and Carolina were nesting in the trees and the Barheaded
Goose was sitting in exactly the same spot as last year. The Orinoco
Geese had a fine and healthy brood of nine I believe. We saw a flock
of Flamingos on the grass. Also, I forgot to mention that while we
were at the bottom, we saw two flocks, one of Ross' Snow Geese, and
one of Red-breasted, both very lovely and very rare."

Psittaspiza riefferi
By P. H. Maxwell
When the members of the Avicultural Society were very kindly
invited to Forwarren Park, Cobham, Surrey, to see Mr. and Mrs. Ezra's
wonderful bird collection, on 28th May, we saw a specimen of this
bird recently brought home by Mr. Webb amongst the new animals.
It is very seldom imported, but Mr. Goodfellow brought home some,
or one for Mr. E. J. Brook. It is brilliant grass-green, upper wing-
coverts brighter, lores, sides of face, chin, and lower part of the belly
chestnut, bill orange, feet yellow ; w&apos;hole length 8 inches, wing 4*5,
tail 3*5. The sexes are similar, but the female is smaller--it has the
general structure of a Saltator, but the bill is shorter and the tail
more squared. It builds a nest of considerable size, made of green
moss, lined thickly within, on the outside prettily ornamented with
long tapering green ferns.
Mr. T. K. Salmon, in his article on " Birds in the State of Antioquia,
United States of Colombia," in the Proceedings of the Zoological
Society of London, 1879, said he only found one egg in the nest of
this bird, but he could not say whether this was always the case.
Besides the typical species there are two sub-races which inhabit
Peruvian and Colombian Andes. This Tanager described inhabits
chiefly the humid temperate zones, but is occasionally found in a sub-
tropical zone. It is an inhabitant of Colombia and Ecuador.

The party left Paris in the evening of Sunday, 15th May, still
shepherded by Monsieur Jean Delacour, the indefatigable Secretary
of the Congress, and arrived at 6.30 the next morning in Arles. At
9.30 the members of the Congress were received by the Mayor in the
Town Hall where they were given a speech of welcome and champagne.
After this the morning was spent in visiting the town and its many
beautiful and interesting Roman buildings, most striking among these
being the open-air theatre, where plays are still produced, and the
large amphitheatre. In the afternoon the whole party was taken to
Nimes where the Natural History Museum was visited and an official
welcome given by the Director. The party then drove to Aigues Mortes
and finally a visit was made to the Petite Camargue to see a colony of
Little Egrets, Night Herons, and Squacco Herons. The colony is
situated in a wood in the sand dunes and as we approached all the
birds rose into the air which made a wonderful sight. There were about
200 nests of Little Egrets and Night Herons and about six of the
Squacco Heron. The wood was also full of Nightingales, all singing ;
in fact this bird is a striking feature of the whole Camargue for w r herever
there is a suitable bush or tree a Nightingale is sure to be heard singing
all day long.
All through the night a Scops Owl was calling from the trees just
outside the hotel and at 6.30 the next morning the party started off
in charabancs for the long excursion to the Grande Camargue, in
torrential rain and a thunderstorm.
The whole Camargue is a wonderful place, triangular in shape,
between the two arms of the Rhone as it branches before flowing into
the Mediterranean, and it is probable that years ago it used to be a
gulf, but has gradually silted up and formed a flat sandy area of very
interesting country. There are a series of shallow brackish lakes, reed
beds, marshland and sand dunes covered with bushes and coarse
grass ; farther inland are sweet water lakes, low growing trees, woods,
and agricultural land. This naturally suits all sorts of birds and is
an excellent stopping place for migrants on their way north after crossing
the Mediterranean ; also, of course, a great number remain to nest.
A large area has been established as a reserve, under the direction
of Monsieur M. Tallon, by the Societe Nationale d'Acclimatation de

France, of which Monsieur Jean Delacour is the President of the
Ornithological Section.
All through the Camargue there are quite good roads between the
lakes so the charabancs were able to proceed without difficulty. After
travelling for about an hour a stop was made to see a herd of the bulls
which inhabit the Camargue. These are used for specialized bull
fights and are very fierce large black animals. They are looked after
by " gardiens " who ride on white horses and look very picturesque
in their large hats and white trousers, carrying long staves in their
hands to control the bulls.
Fortunately the weather cleared and at the next stop, which was
by a large lake, a magnificent flock of Flamingos was seen feeding
in the water. Later a whole lot of these birds rose and flew in a long
line one after each other, their dark pink and black wings and out-
stretched legs and necks against the blue sky making an absolutely
unforgettable, picture. The Flamingos visit the Camargue every year
and the numbers seem to vary very much--sometimes it is as many
as ten thousand. A few hundreds stay for the winter, but the majority
go farther south. The nesting of the Flamingos in the Camargue
seems somewhat of a mystery--they sometimes nest and bring up their
young and then there are long periods of years during which no young
are observed at all, but all the same the birds lay eggs. They apparently
make no attempt at nest building but drop the eggs anywhere and
then, naturally, they come to grief.
Purple Herons rose from the reed beds, Calandra Larks were seen
occasionally, Cetti's Warblers were singing on all sides and the Great
Reed Warbler was most in evidence of all. Avocets and Little Egrets
were feeding by the lake-side and a good number of Black Terns were
fishing. On the other side of the marsh a Marsh Harrier rose and
swung slowly into the distance ; the number of these birds in the
Camargue is remarkable. Montagu and Hen Harriers were also seen,
but in nothing approaching the numbers of the Marsh.
At midday when the watcher's house was reached, a lorry appeared,
yet another example of the magnificent organization of the expedition,
with dozens and dozens of carrier-bags in each of which was a bottle
of wine and a large amount of food, which, as at ten o'clock everyone

had decided it must by then be lunch time, was highly approved.
In a willow near the house a pair of Penduline Tits were completing
a nest, and flying about the outhoi^ses was a Collared Flycatcher. In
the early afternoon nesting Stilts were visited and also the nest of a
Marsh Harrier. Later, near another watcher's house, the nest of a
Fantailed Warbler with young, a Spectacled Warbler's nest, and yet
another Penduline Tit's nest, this time with young, were all seen
within a small area. Flocks of Ruffs, the inevitable Marsh Harrier,
and many other birds were observed even from the charabancs on the
way back to Arles, where, after an unforgettable day, the party
returned in the evening.

By Dr. E. Hopkinson
Since the appearance of Records of Birds Bred in Captivity in 1926
much more material has accumulated and here an attempt is made
to provide a summary of all the records to date on the lines of Part III
of the original work, that is, indicating the values of the various records
by change of type. These values must necessarily differ as the sources of
error are many--from simple mistakes in identification and observation
down to downright mis-statements, as I fear many of the recent claims
for success with British Birds must be considered. We are all familiar
nowadays with the advertisements of aviary- (or cage-) bred Britishers,
and I think nearly every possible British cage-bird has so appeared ;
at any rate I have seen most, " A.B., C.R., etc.," even Nightingales
and Long-tailed Tits, but surely the biscuit must be awarded to the
advertiser (in January) of " Linnets : cage-bred, Is. each, or 9s. a
dozen if a quantity are taken ". Could anybody breed even white
mice or cockroaches, keep them six months and then sell them at 9 d. ?
This sort of thing has naturally made one suspicious of all records,
but that cannot be helped, and I am sure we can be certain that there
are plenty of good records for a great number of birds including British.

Dr. E. Hopkinson--Breeding Records : Summary 191
Here the compiler gives his opinion of the values and hopes with help
from others to amplify the records later on.
Towards an ideal record of the future successful breeders could
give much help by telling us in each case
How many young birds left the nest ?
How many of these lived to moult ?
How many survived a year or longer ?
Did any of the young breed again ?
Except for Canaries, Budgerigars, and a few other species, I am
afraid the answer to the last question would be " none " for the cage-
birds proper, that is excluding Ducks, Game Birds, and the like.
I fear too that in most cases the answers to the other questions would
not be too encouraging.
No details are given here but perhaps I may mention that Records
is still obtainable at 15s. by anyone sufficiently interested and that
the publishers are Messrs. Witherby, High Holborn, London. It is
on this that most of the present effort is based. Some fifty pages of
additions appeared in the Magazine in 1932-3 and those of more
recent date are included here. Any information I have is at the service
of anyone really interested.
The figures with each entry, and the letters for the hybrids are those
of the original book. Capitals indicate that the species (or hybrid)
has certainly been bred : large capitals that the record is self-sufficient,
small ones that the actual breeding can be (at least in my opinion)
taken as certain, but that further detail is desirable. When a name
appears in ordinary print, it means that the record is not entirely
satisfactory, when brackets enclose an entry it is considered at best
doubtful, and when a query (?) is added real doubt is indicated, and
more queries, more doubt.

By P. J. Lambert
One is invariably intrigued with the arrival of one's weekly bird
paper and still more the monthly Magazine issued by the Avicultural
Society. They are papers that are eagerly devoured by all bird
lovers for one imbibes knowledge by the perusal thereof. In
the weekly papers such as Cage Birds one reads of the treatment
necessary for such birds as Budgerigars, Canaries, and some of
the foreign Finches; the charm of these birds is ably set
forth by various writers. Pheasants are extolled in the weekly
papers and also our Avicultural Magazine. In the latter one reads of
the very rare exotic birds from all parts of the world and such articles
make charming reading. Waterfowl are occasionally mentioned in
these papers but there is one group of birds that rarely receive mention,
I refer to that group of birds called Waders. May I be allowed to extol
their virtues and tell you of their charm ? Possibly very few of our
members have kept these birds ; let me assure those readers that they
have missed an avicultural pursuit which teems with interest, for
Waders have an indefinable charm which will captivate any lover of
nature. The term " Wader " covers a large group of birds and although
the word has a most pleasing suggestion, it is not altogether appropriate;
but for our purpose we can pass over the name by calling to mind the
expression : " What's in a name ? " Why such birds as Lapwings are
included in this group I fail to understand. I have never seen a Lapwing
wade. I must admit that my experience has been very limited with

P. J . Lambert--Waders
this form of bird life, but during the past four years I have kept the
following : the Dunlin, Ruff and Reeve, Redshank, Common Sandpiper,
the Black- and Bar-tailed Godwit, Curlew, Whirnbrel (I like to think
of this bird as the Lesser Curlew), Lapwing, and Oyster Catcher.
I was told that if one mixed many varieties in an aviary, fighting would
take place, and this of a continuous nature. However, I tried the
experiment and the trouble has never materialized. My Wader aviary
is 12 yards long and 6 yards wide. At the south end I have enclosed
a space of 2 yards long by the width of the aviary. I used boards and
covered these with heather and this included the roof. This makes
quite a pleasing effect and the front of this shelter is open to the width
of one yard. In the middle of the aviary I have a shallow pond covering
about 8 square yards, and this is built of concrete; a rockery relieves
the harshness of concrete and I find that Waders do not eat the plant
life I introduce. I do find it necessary to renew the water every week
in hot weather, but with the aid of a garden hose I find it a simple
matter to empty and refill. Feeding is not difficult; scalded biscuit-
meal (coarse!, a little boiled rice, and dried shrimps scalded with the
meal. These shrimps are obtainable from Messrs. Rudd and Co.,
180 Bishopsgate Road, E.C., and are inexpensive. Titbits in the form
of ground worms and occasionally a little raw fish and meat is relished.
When I feel sufficiently energetic I go back to my boyhood days and
with a fishing rod and line and " fish kettle " visit the local stream
where I catch minnows and sticklebacks ; these fish meet with a hearty
welcome from the Waders and the fish enjoy their new quarters for a
very limited space of time. When I first kept Waders I discovered
that some varieties, especially Godwits, easily went lame. I think
the hard ground was to blame, and I covered the aviary with about
an inch of sand. This gave the surroundings a very natural aspect and
further lameness ceased. I have kept a great number and variety of
birds in my time but I will emphatically state that of all birds I have
found Waders the most interesting. They are continually active and
rarely at rest, their antics will keep one amused for long hours. Let
us have a look at my Waders and watch their habits. There is a Ruff
facing another Ruff, they both extend their peculiar collars and one
will imagine a mortal and bloody combat is about to take place ;

they spring at one another, but instead of the deadly fight we anticipated,
one finds it is merely a friendly spar and off one dashes for further
fun ; he runs into a Whimbrel and the latter immediately seizes the
Ruff's beak, shakes it, and releases it. A Godwit comes chatting along
and inquisitively inquires what all the trouble is about; both the Ruff
and Whimbrel attack the new arrival and then the whole group of
birds give vent to their various calls. It is great and youthful fun and
of a most entertaining nature as it never ceases. Now a Godwit standing
behind a large stone sees a Curlew approaching, it backs just as a
boy would hide, the Curlew passes and the Godwit springs from its
lair, another spar and as usual no damage is done, but if that Godwit
did not smile then I have made a grievous miscalculation of bird life.
Now we will throw them some worms. A Lapwing, which incidentally
is a marvellously quick bird, has seized a lob worm and the other
Waders near by are after it, a Ruff seizes the other end, and a Godwit
intervening decides the " middle cut " may prove profitable and thus
the unhappy worms meets its " Waterloo ". So the fun goes on.
Now a Whimbrel decides on a bath and what is more pleasing than to
watch such birds perform their ablutions ? Others, jealous of the fun,
join him and within a few moments seven or eight have joined the
bathing party. Such is their daily fife, endless activity and playful
excursions : that, after all, is the secret of their charm. One must not
expect gay colouring, they are generally of sombre nature. The Ruff,
however, is a bird of most extraordinary plumage, no two Ruffs are
alike and surely this is one of the most amazing peculiarities known
to aviculture ? The colouring of their collars varies in a marvellous
manner, some white, others grey or brown ; moreover the facial skin
varies and yet the Reeve (female of the variety) are all alike, and
these birds are not given to playful habits as are the males.
I have kept Waders with Pheasants ; the Waders ignore the
Pheasant and vice versa, thus they live together in perfect content. I
will confess that I have not yet tried to induce these birds to
breed in confinement, but I feel convinced that there will be no
insuperable difficulties. One imagines that small aviaries will be
necessary, and that in the spring pairs must be housed in these.
Next autumn I intend to build a few such aviaries. Small ponds

with rushes, sedges, and water plants will be introduced. I shall
be surprised and disappointed if I fail. I do not anticipate causing
such as Oyster Catchers to propagate, but many of the others
should not be extremely difficult--we will see. I have just
mentioned small ponds but I do not think that ponds are essential
for Waders. I tried a few in a Pheasant aviary and merely gave
them a fair sized bowl of water ; they were quite content and kept
in splendid condition. I mention this for the benefit of those who have
no facilities for making ponds or do not wish for them.
I am hoping that many more aviculturists will keep these birds.
I can assure readers that they will find them most pleasing and
captivating pets. They are naturally tame. At the moment I have
about fifty Waders in my aviary and all of them will approach to
within about a foot or so if they think any titbits are on the point of
being dispensed.

By Olive St. A. S.
Alfred was a Black-capped Lory, a lovely thing of glowing scarlet
and flashing Kingfisher-blue, soft verdant green, and velvety black.
We bought him in a Chinese bird-shop, and from the first he
hated me.
Alfred's vocabulary was very free, and fortunately for most of his
hearers was in a Malay dialect not very widely spoken. But there
was no doubt as to the import of most of the raucous remarks that used
to be flung at my innocent and inoffensive head, so packed with meaning
were they. Let anyone of the male sex approach him though. What
a transformation ! Gone was the flashing eye and snapping beak,
and with what honeyed words did he spread his burnished quivering
wings and bow his dusky head in humble adoration.
Those who could understand Alfred's speech assured us that he
was unusually clever, and I have seen Malays sit for hours listening
to his flow of conversation and, judging by the smiles of the audience
and slightly anxious side-glances in my direction, one assumes his

type of humour must have been rather Rabelaisian at times. He never
learned to speak one word of English, and his little brain must have
been so packed with other things that it could not absorb any more
knowledge.
Alfred was our first Lory, and I shudder to think of what his fate
would have been if a naturalist friend had not arrived the day after
his purchase and told us how to make up the equivalent of the bird's
natural food. Until then he had sat gloomily picking to pieces the
Parrot food with which we had provided him, and as all Lories are
nectar-feeders one can imagine his inward comments.
We've kept many Lories since Alfred, but only two are outstanding
in my memory. One a Black Lory, a soft bronzy black, washed under-
neath the body with a delicate sapphire-blue, a bird which followed
me about like a dog, and which would clamber on to my shoulder
and " chuss " around my neck, keeping up a running commentary of
soft mutterings. You could give this bird a piece of paper rolled up
into a ball, and it would play for hours like a kitten, lying on its side
and " back-pedalling " it till quite exhausted. The other, a little
Rosenberg's Lorikeet, " Ikey," a tiny green-jewelled thing, was a
bundle of nerves and intelligence. One morning he was found dead
in his cage and we never discovered the cause of his untimely end.
Now Alfred was a bird of altogether different fibre. If one coughed
or sneezed in the night there was an instant reply, a hollow cough or
sneeze followed, I regret to say, by the usual " postscript " which
is universal throughout the East, and generally accompanies a heavy
cold. The daily bath was a great event. A bowl of water would be
placed invitingly near, and after many coughs and sneezes (and PSS.)
he would clamber carefully down and perch on the edge and splash
and shriek and drink and--yes--gargle to his heart's content.
One early morning, when the birds were all being put out to enjoy
the first rays of the sun, an unusual clamour of human voices arose
through the cool dew-drenched air, and hurrying feet were heard
approaching from all sides. All these sounds being so very odd at that
hour of the morning I was compelled to tip-toe to the edge of the
veranda and peer cautiously over. Never shall I forget the expression
in the topaz eye that was turned up to meet mine ! What pride,

tinged with, self-consciousness ! What an air of slightly guilty smugness !
Alfred, bless " his " heart, had laid an egg.
I can remember when I was very young asking my mother if
Parrots ever laid eggs, and I can hear her reply now, after a second's
modest hesitation : " Well, not &apos;private Parrots." So, you see !
Alfred's " shame " reposes in the Singapore Museum. A Lory's
egg is rather rare in captivity.

The O.P.S. will be holding its annual summer meeting on 21st July,
at the offices of the London Zoological Society. We are most grateful
to this Society for once more placing their Council room at our disposal,
and our members appreciate this kindly gesture. I understand that
the Avicultural Society will be holding their meeting in the afternoon
of that day and our meeting will be at 11 a.m. I do hope that any
members of the Avicultural Society who are not members of the O.P.S.
and who are travelling to London for the Avicultural Society meeting
will join our Society and attend our meeting. This meeting will be
followed by a luncheon, and this will be served in the Zoological
Gardens. In case any reader of these notes may wish to join our
Society, I may mention that the subscription is only 6s. per annum,
and no entrance fee is required. This subscription can be sent to
me at Nawton, York. On receipt of same I shall be pleased to send
the July issue of our Journal. This Journal is, as usual, most interesting
to all bird lovers. Two magnificent coloured plates adorn the pages,
and the articles are by famous aviculturists, our President, M. Delacour,
is at his best. Monsieur Malisoux brings his scientific knowledge of
his subject to bear, and Madam Malisoux for the first time has honoured
our pages. Baron Carpinello of Sicily entertains us with a description
of his aviaries and general methods. Mr. Mackie writes about Partridges
in his usual graceful style. Mr. Beever, a phasianist of long standing,
tells us of his twenty years' experiences with his favoured hobby.
Monsieur Hannens also writes of the extraordinary difficulties that

other writers who prove most pleasing. There are some charming
aviary designs. The results of the photographic competition are shown
for us all to appreciate the judgment of Mr. E. R. W. Lincoln, the
editor of Cage Birds , six plates are shown, and they are most interesting.
Great Britain did not shine in this competition. Mr. Jones, of
Vancouver Island being first and third, Mr. Schmidt, of Yugoslavia,
second and fourth, Madame Piret fifth, and Mr. Mackie, of Leeds, just
managed to save Great Britain from being amongst the " also rans ".
I hope that every member of the Avicultural Society will see this

Madam, --With reference to Mr. H. C. Martin's inquiry : Corbatita is the
name given in Argentine, Uruguay, etc., to Sporophila czerulescens (English
name Bluish Finch), a Southern variety of Sporophila ornata of Brazil.
G. DE SOUTHOFF, C.M.Z.S.
Madam, --Speaking for myself, the article by A. F. Moody (published
in the June issue of the Magazine) was much appreciated. The notes on the
Brambling were of special interest, because although I have bred its near
relation, the Chaffinch, into the third generation, I have never known even
captive-bred birds feed their young, to any extent, on anything but insect
food.
Have bred with " captive-bred " birds, solely for the experiment suggested.
The captive-bred Chaffinches have never seen an insect since they were self-
supporting, except such insects as they could find for themselves in the
aviary, even so, they would not attempt to feed a brood unless such food was
supplied. My experiences with other Finches would seem to coincide with
the experiences of Mr. Moody.
I would like to add that my original article was intended as an invitation
to such people as : Mr. A. F. Moody, Mr. G. H. Edwards, Mr. W. H. Workman,
Dr. Amsler, and Mr. P. Lambert. I suspect such fanciers to be in a position
to supply much interesting and valuable data with regard to the common
but neglected British species, including the Waders, the latter group being
worthy of almost unlimited space. At least such is my humble opinion.

BREEDING OF BLACK-HEADED NUN
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.963918230769231" page_id="56318964"  page_num="204" year="" vol="">
Madam, -- I am submitting hereunder an extract from a paper which
I read at the last meeting of the Avicultural Society of South Africa, and
which you could use if you think it is of sufficient interest to members :---
" The Black-headed Nun has just been bred by me, and although
it is found in so many aviaries, it has very rarely been bred in captivity.
This bird is fairly common. It is a seed-eater coming from India, and
is a bright chestnut-brown with a black head and breast and blue bill.
It is of the same species as the White-headed Nun and the Tri-coloured
Nun. It is an excellent bird for any mixed collection, as it does not
interfere with other birds. It is a good bird for the beginner, as it is
comparatively cheap in this country, and from my experience fairly
hardy.
" As far as I can ascertain no medal has been claimed from any
Avicultural Society in England for a first breeding. However, the bird
has bred here, and I think with proper facilities it is not a difficult matter.
When breeding the parents are very timid and require a very secluded
place. I do not think they will breed in tins or nesting-boxes. The pair
which produced the young ones made their nest in an old privet tree
which was covered with teff. They made a tunnel about 18 inches long
leading to a dome nest. It is only by chance a nest can be discovered.
The young are a plain light brown, but in about a month's time small
traces of black start to appear. The birds feed on Canary seed, millet,
manna, maggots, and mealworms."
I would very much like to know something more about these birds, and
although I have looked up a number of books can find nothing about the
Nuns.

THE SHORT-BILLED MINIVET
(.Pericrocotus crevirostris)
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.995738722222222" page_id="56318973"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
Minivets are strikingly beautiful birds, and everyone who has
lived or travelled in Northern India, Burma, China, Indo-China, or the
Malay countries has noticed the marvellous flocks of brilliantly
coloured birds flying high or feeding in trees. They are usually common
enough in jungle and open country with numerous trees, which are
essential to their life.
There are a good many species, most of them scarlet, pink, or
orange with black bands, and black tails and wings in the males,
yellow and grey in the hens. A few are black, white, and grey.
The commonest Indian and Indo-Chinese species is probably the
well-known Scarlet Mini vet (Pericrocotus speciosus), which is brought
over alive in small numbers almost every year. The Short-billed
Minivet, depicted on the adjoining plate, is very similar, but a great
deal smaller, rather richer in colour, with a proportionally shorter and
thinner bill. It also comes to us, but not so often, and it is not so
common as the larger species in the wild state, although by no
means rare.
I have possessed the Short-billed Minivet on two or three occasions.

The Short-billed Minivet
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99913134375" page_id="56318974"  page_num="206" year="" vol="">
A very fine male brought over by Mr. Frost, lived over a year in one
of my tropical greenhouses. It would probably still be alive now if
it had not been fed so many mealworms, which prove extremely
dangerous to small insectivorous birds. If offered liberally, they soon
become the only food accepted ; the birds become light, and die
after a few months. I strongly advise our members to cut them off
entirely from the bill of fare of their Minivet's, Flycatchers, and
other small insect-eaters. A good insectile mixture, with a few flies,
ant-cocoons, clean maggots, and other small insects is what they
want. If insects are unobtainable, boiled yolk of egg and a little
raw meat, cut-up fine, will often be just as satisfactory .
At liberty Mini vets are high flyers. Their short legs and weak
feet only allow them to stand on small branches, and nearly all their
movements are effected on the wing. Their natural food consists of
small berries and insects. In captivity they are no cage-birds, as can
be easily understood. They need a roomy aviary, where they can fly
freely, or better a large tropical house. They usually become exceed-
ingly tame, but they cannot be said to be very easy to keep in good
condition. The Short-billed Minivet is decidedly one of the prettiest
and most desirable species, and their marvellous colours and pretty
shape are well worth the care they require. One drawback, however,
is the loss of the red in the male plumage after the first moult in
captivity. Even in a tropical house wdiere such birds as the Ked Sun-
bird [Mthiojpyga seherix) keep their scarlet plumage perfectly, my
Short-billed Minivet became pale pinky orange. An elaborate colour
food would have to be discovered and tried, and there is no doubt
that it could be found. Perhaps one of our ingenious members will
be tempted by this problem.
A not unusual but unforgettable sight in the forested parts of
India and the Far East is certainly that of a flock of fifty or more
Minivets, scarlet and black, or yellow and grey, flying high above the
green jungle trees, against a turquoise-blue sky.

Notwithstanding the fact that Rio de Janeiro is probably the most
beautiful of all tropical cities and that it is the capital of a state which is
nearly half the size of Europe and also that it contains more species of
birds than any other country in the world, its Zoological Gardens are
the poorest I have ever visited.
In what could be a magnificent park are a few dilapidated pens and
aviaries which contain, besides a few indigenous mammals, such as
jaguars, pumas, coatis, etc., a very poor collection of native birds
under conditions which leave very much to be desired. In a small
aviary were a few desiderata, including three very tame Orinoco Geese,
a bird I have always desired to possess, about half a dozen Great White
Egrets, all in full breeding plumage and far whiter than any I have ever
seen in Europe. Egrets kept in captivity in Europe always lack the
immaculate whiteness of the wild birds. There were also a few White-
faced Tree Ducks.
In some shockingly small and dirty aviaries were a few Scarlet
Ibis faded almost to a dirty white, a Cocoi Heron, a Boat-bill, and a
Night Heron (Nycticorax obscurus). On a stand resembling that of a
Macaw was a female Frigate Bird ; ofi this the wretched bird
apparently never moved.
One noticed a few indigenous Parrots and, considering Brazil's
great wealth of Parrot life, the collection was exceedingly poor. There
were various species of Macaws, Illiger's, Red and Blue, Red and Yellow,
and Blue and Yellow, an odd Amazon of the Blue-front variety, and a
single Festive, but what took my eye was a pair of the very rare and
beautiful Violet-bellied Parrots, birds looking like a small cock Eclectus
Parrot, with brilliant purple-blue underparts. Then there were a pair
of small Parrots of which I did not know the name and I think must
have been quite rare. They were about the size of a Caique and of a
uniform pale mealy green. I recently saw a specimen of this bird in the
Dudley Zoo labelled as an 44 Antipodes Island Parrakeet " ! ! There
were a great many Yellow-breasted Caiques, a good many together

in a cage much smaller than those used at the London Zoo. Besides an
odd Nanday Conure this completed the Parrots.
Of birds of prey, I noticed a Condor with a broken wing, several
Caracaras (Polyborus tharus ), a very common bird of prey in South
America, a Chimango (Milvago chimango) or Common Carrion Hawk,
a still commoner bird. There were several large eagles including a
European White-tailed Sea Eagle which had been presented in 1914.
There was also a female King Vulture.
One rather expected to see hosts of Trumpeters, Curassows, Guans,
etc., of the former there were none ; in all the places I visited in Brazil
I did not see a single Trumpeter, although it was for these birds that
I really went to that country. Of the Curassow r s, there were four
specimens of three varieties, there was also a pair of Guans and a
single pair of Penelopes and two pairs of those charming birds, the
Seriamas. There were, as one would expect in a South American Zoo,
a few Rheas of the common variety. Of exotic birds there were a few
Red-billed Weavers in a canary cage, a tame Raven which was fed
upon nothing else but bread, a pair of Emus, and, what really surprised
me, a magnificent specimen of a male Argus Pheasant, the best I have
ever seen; evidently the damp hot climate and the maize upon which it
was fed suited it.
As for the mammals, these were housed under appalling conditions
which had perhaps better not be described.
I expected to be able to pick up a few rare birds in Brazil for my
aviaries, my chief objective being, as mentioned above, Trumpeters,
but I found very few, if any, native birds offered for sale. Strict laws
now prohibit the killing or catching of almost every bird. Before these
laws were enacted, Brazil's bird life was being exploited to a shocking
degree. It supplied, after Venezuela, the largest amount of Egret
feathers for the millinery trade and an enormous number of bales of
brightly coloured bird skins were exported to Europe and America,
especially the skins of Humming Birds.
After seeing the crates of brilliantly coloured Tanagers which used
to arrive in this country looking as though the birds had been dipped in
treacle, only to linger a few weeks in the dealer's shops, one was not
sorry that an end had been put to this nefarious traffic.

I visited several bird shops in Rio and Santos but found that their
stock-in-trade consisted mainly of Canaries, Java Sparrows, various
species of African Waxbills, and Weavers, and the commoner varieties
of Pheasants. One man did show me two Black-headed Siskins and a
dying Grackle which he kept under his writing desk for fear the police
should see them.
Unless one goes into the interior of Brazil, one sees very few birds,
except an occasional Humming Bird around the banana flowers in the
gardens, a few Spermophila Finches and small flocks of Brotogerys,
and Parrakeets at the tops of the high trees and palms, far too high up
to be able to distinguish their species.
I was also anxious to get hold of a few Scarlet Ibis but only once
did I see any of these and they were in a garden with some White-faced
Tree Ducks.
Tyrants of various species were extremely common in the inhabited
parts of Brazil and in some of the parks their cries were almost deafening.
Purple Grackles seemed to take the place of Starlings and one saw
Thrushes which were very reminiscent of our own birds. I think, as on
the Continent, these birds must be eaten, for I frequently saw, but never
sampled, " Merle " on the menus of various restaurants.
The only places where I saw any Brazilian birds offered for sale
were Rio Grande do Sul and Maceio, the former a delightful town just
inside a great lake or lagoon at the far south of Brazil. The birds were
in the very picturesque market place and they consisted of Naked-
throated Bellbirds and a few Red-crested Cardinals, several Thrushes
which I think were the Red-breasted (Turdus rufiventris), a few
Spermophila Finches of which there are a great many varieties in
Brazil, and a single Purple Grackle ; why these birds should have been
on sale when the laws regarding the sale of birds are so strict, I do not
know. I certainly saw a good many cage birds in Rio Grande do Sul
belonging to private people, these mainly consisted of Budgies, Canaries,
Red-crested Cardinals, the local Thrushes and an occasional Bellbird.
In fact when I was walking in the streets one Sunday, I heard the
discordant clanging of church bells and after a time they stopped,
except one which went on for a little while and then stopped and went
on again and, as we moved in the direction from whence the sound came,

we found that it was made by a Bellbird. It was an adult bird in very
fine condition with snow-white plumage and bright green naked
throat.
Some miles outside Bio Grande do Sul on the Atlantic Coast was
a wonderful stretch of sandy shore, hundreds of miles long and an ideal
haunt for seabirds. A bird which I saw here for the first time was the
Skimmer or Scissor-bill, a strange black and white, Tern-like bird
possessing an extraordinary beak. Darwin describing it says, " The
beak is flattened laterally, that is in a plane at right angles to that of a
Duck or Spoonbill. It is as flat and elastic as an ivory paper knife and
the lower mandible, different from any other bird, is an inch longer than
the upper." The bird obtains its food by flying low over the water and
ploughing the surface with the lower mandible, thus catching small
fish which swim near the top of the water. The beak gives the bird an
extremely grotesque appearance.
In the marsh lands near the sea were to be seen the conspicuous
and graceful forms of numerous Great White Egrets, now safe at last
from persecution. I brought a fine pair of these back with me from the
Argentine and unfortunately lost them through my own foolishness.
Their plumage was rather soiled and one day on board the ship on the
homeward voyage I thought I would put them out in a shower of rain
to enable the birds to wash themselves, unfortunately the " shower "
proved to be a torrential tropical downpour of such severity, that one
bird sustained a broken wing and thigh and the other died the next
day. I cursed myself for being such a fool to lose though my own fault
these two splendid birds. Strange to say the rain had no such effect
on two pairs of Snowy Egrets which I also put out.
On this wonderful sandy beach which stretched as far as the eye
could see on either hand, we saw a Great Grebe (JEcJimo&apos;phorus major)
laying out on the sands ; at a distance it looked a very strange creature,
almost like a prehistoric reptile with its large flattened body and long
narrow head. The Grebe was surrounded by many other shore birds
such as Sandpipers, Oyster-catchers, and others which I was unable to
identify. As we approached, the bird turned round and made off towards
the sea with motion like that of a seal, undulating its body along the
sand ; as the sea was very shallow, it was quite a long time before it

could reach a depth where it was able to swim. I have seldom seen a bird
so ungainly on land as this one.
One of the most beautiful birds which I saw in Brazil was the Widow-
tyrant, a bird which at a distance looked like a large cabbage white
butterfly. In fact so butterfly-like is its flight that at first I mistook
it for a huge white butterfly. It has a habit of perching on wire fences
or telegraph wires on the sides of the road. Tyrants of many species
are very common in all parts of Brazil.
One of the most interesting places visited, at least as far as local
colour was concerned, was Maceio, a small port in the north of Brazil
which still retains much of its old Portuguese atmosphere and is seldom
visited by European travellers. Here there were birds in abundance,
expecially in the market, in fact almost every stall-holder seemed to
have one or more as a pet. The variety, however, was not very great, and
the most commonly kept birds were various kinds of the Spermophila
Finches, one species in particular, a black and chestnut bird with a
huge thick beak, seemed to be an exceptionally sweet singer ; there
were also Saffron Finches and Red-headed Cardinals. In one place,
a kind of lottery exchange, there was a Bellbird in the transitional
plumage, which was white spotted with green. It seemed to be in a
perfect frenzy to make itself heard above the general hubbub of the
swarming crowds and in this it seemed quite successful for its clanging
notes could be heard several streets away. The call of a Bellbird when
heard at close quarters is terribly penetrating and makes one's ears
ring for a long time afterwards. There were also some beautiful blue-
eyed Black and Yellow Cassiques, pouring forth volumes of song. In
fact all the hundreds of caged birds I saw seemed to be singing. In the
extremely quaint and picturesque market place, where one could buy
anything from snake skins to sewing machines, and where every old
nigger woman seemed to be smoking a huge pipe, there was but a
single bird stall, here were only a few Archbishop Tanagers, Red-headed
Cardinals, Cassiques, Saffron Finches and a good many varieties of
Spermophila Finches.
I have never seen so many cage birds anywhere as in this remote
town ; every house seemed to have one or more cages and even the
ships in the bay had them to. All the birds appeared to be well looked
after and to be singing.

Sydney Porter--Notes from South America
I spent about a month in Brazil but saw very few birds in a wild
state ; as with most other countries, Brazil is destroying its forests,
and when the indigenous flora goes so does the avifauna, especially if
it is the forest type. Cutting down the forests and planting with crops
means despoiling the country as far as the naturalist is concerned, and
ultimately as far as the farmer is concerned. Over the miles of country
where the native vegetation is destroyed there is no cover or under-
growth for the birds in which to hide and nest, and with the destruction
of the plants, so vanish the insects and fruits upon which the birds
feed, consequently in the cultivated districts one sees very few birds
whatever.
Had I have gone into the far interior where the tropical forests
are I should doubtless have seen a great many birds, but unfortunately
I had no time for that.
The commonest bird in South America is the familiar Southern
Turkey Vulture, which is to be seen flying in hundreds, with out-
stretched, motionless pinions, above the smaller towns, on the lookout
for any edible garbage or carrion. When the fishermen haul in the
catches, these birds may be seen in hundreds on the beach waiting for
an odd inedible fish or the offal from the others.
As I had very little time in Montevideo I did not go to the Zoo there,
which I was given to understand was very little better than the one in
Bio. As there seem to be no laws prohibiting the catching of birds in
Uruguay, one sees many native birds kept by the inhabitants of
Montevideo, chiefly Bed-crested Cardinals, the various Spermophila
Finches, and various local Thrushes. I discovered one good bird shop
where I saw many birds of local origin.
There were several specimens of the local Mocking Bird (Mimus
modulator ), a bird very much larger than the North American species,
these were priced at about 355. a pair. I noticed several species of
waders, Stilts were 16s. a pair, there were also various Plovers and
Bedshank. There were also some very fine Marsh or Military Starlings
(Trupialis defilippii), a bird clad in the most vivid scarlet and varying
shades of brown ; some beautiful Blue and Yellow Tanagers (Tanagra
honariensi ), Ovenbirds, Grackles, many local Thrushes which are great
favourites on account of their song, and, strange to say, a Fieldfare,

but how this came to be in Uruguay is a bit of a mystery. I also noticed
other exotics in the way of Java Sparrows, Waxbills, and Ring-necked
and Silver Pheasants. There were a few Amazons and a very fine Red
and Blue Macaw priced at #3, which I would have bought had I not
anticipated staying for some time in Buenos Aires.

(N. Chrysogaster)
By J. F. M. Floyd
Some nine years ago, a party of ornithologists who were in the
south-east of South Australia on a bird observing expedition, noticed
some Parrots of the Neophema group feeding on the grass near a lake.
There were about twenty of these birds, and, as they rose in flight,
one was shot for purposes of identification.
When the bird was picked up, it was found to be the Orange-
bellied Grass Parrakeet which had been thought to be extinct or
nearly so.
No report of the existence of these birds had been received for
many years. Early in the twentieth century one had been shot by a
resident of Robe, and forwarded to the Museum for identification.
The news of the reappearance of this rare Parrot naturally caused
some excitement among the ornithologists, and also among the avi-
culturists, several of whom decided that they would like to see a
pair of these birds in their aviaries.
Many years ago when that great ornithologist, Gould, toured
Australia and classified most of its birds, the Orange-bellied Parrot
at that time had its habitat in the southern portion of Tasmania.
It was known to nest in or on the low broken-oif ti-tree stumps,
2 or 3 feet from the ground, and it was this rather foolish habit which
made it an easy prey to foxes and other enemies, and it was considered
that these factors might ultimately lead to its extinction.

Even in those days the Parrots were known to migrate, at certain
seasons of the year, to the south-eastern coast of Australia between
Kingston in South Australia and Portland in Victoria, a habit that
was shared, and still is, by the Tasmanian Firetail Finch.
This Finch is also to be found in the south-east and now nests
there, as I observed the parent Finches with two young ones recently
when trying to catch the Orange-bellied Grass Parrot.
In 1927, 1928, and 1929 I made three trips to the south-east in
search of this Parrot. On one occasion I heard some Neophema calling
as they flew some distance away but I was never lucky enough to
see one. On one trip I picked up a dead one in some reeds ; it had
been shot some months before, but there were enough feathers attached
to the skeleton to enable me to identify it. Sandwiched in between
these trips had been two others in search of the Scarlet-chested Parrot,
which were unsuccessful, but while I was in England it is now avi-
cultural history how the Splendids were located, caught, and bred
in captivity.
On my return from England I made another attempt on the Orange-
bellies at the end of 1933 and once more failed to sight the
bird.
Then came 1934, and at the end of October, after a fast trip
averaging 49 miles per hour, I arrived at our destination and proceeded
to take a walk. My son aged 14 accompanied me. Within five minutes
we flushed three birds from under a bush and they only flew about
10 yards and perched on another small bush about 2 feet high.
It was 4.30 in the afternoon and the light was good. Can you
imagine the rate of my heart beats, when I recognized the Parrot I
had been chasing for seven years ?
A little farther on we came across two more and that was enough
--the birds were there ! I did not like my chance of catching any
as it was on a hillside with a large bare area and to hope that the
birds would land anywhere near my nets seemed to be asking for
a miracle.
Hurrying back to the car, we brought the trapping gear up the
hill, set a net, built a hide, and, while doing so, saw two flocks of over
twenty of these birds flying overhead.

After dinner the time was spent overhauling all the devices which
are part and parcel of any attempt to catch birds.
Next morning we arose at 4 a.m. and stayed in the hide until
9 a.m. The only exciting incident occurred when, on walking up the
hill, I nearly trod on a 4 ft. Black Snake which one would hardly
expect to meet at that chilly hour of the morning, I killed him with
a piece of fencing wire which was lying handy and kept a sharp look
out while hiding in the bushes. Not a bird was seen or heard and at
9 a.m. we adjourned for breakfast.
After breakfast it commenced to rain and continuing all day
managed to register 2 inches. That settled all bird catching and
later in the afternoon I went for a drive out to a station about 10
miles away to see if the people there had ever seen any of these Parrots.
On the way we flushed twenty-five in a new spot and decided to try
our luck there the next morning.
Awake again at 4 a.m. and off to the new ground--into the hide
after seeing that all preparations were made, and at 6.20 we heard
the Zit-Zit of approaching Neophema. Twrn landed close to me--
within 12 feet, and as I had a good look at them I thought the old
heart wmuld burst with excitement.
Unless you have tried trapping birds you could never realize what
one goes through w&apos;hen the longed for bird arrives within range of
one's nets, I was able to observe the birds closely and the bottle green
back and wing feathers were very noticeable and very different
from the Elegant, Blue wing, and Rock Parrot shade. These two
birds fed on some fine native grass seeds, the grass being about
3 inches high.
Dandelions were also very numerous and as the sun was behind
clouds, these were closed up. I was interested to see these birds
nibbling at the closed dandelion heads and as they had now worked
to within 5 feet of my hide, there could be no mistake about this.
Can you imagine how still one has to keep in a flimsy hide of bushes
when the birds are as close as that ?
Cramp--rheumatism--sitting on the wrong leg or w'ith one foot
asleep are all in the day's work, and the pain must be endured
until the birds are caught or have flown away. At 6.50 one

bird had worked its way into the area covered by the net--the other
was still some distance away. I could not take the risk of trying to
get both so with a prayer that my nets would work fast, I pulled and
shot out of the hide, hopping down the slope on one leg, as the other
had been asleep for fifteen minutes. Under the net was a glorious
orange bellied cock bird which I promptly withdrew and put into a
specially prepared cage protected inside by soft netting.
The other bird had flown away but I did not mind that because
I was now the possessor of a live N. Chrysogaster. Re-set the nets
and back to the hide, there to gloat over my trophy. He was beautiful
and as fat as butter. By 7.20 another bird had come my way and this
I also caught. Another cock. Nothing more before 9 o'clock, so off
to breakfast with the two Parrots.
They proved to be remarkably tame and quiet and when I put
a hand inside the door one jumped upon it, and sat there for five
minutes while the various inmates of the house came and admired it.
The remainder of the day was a blank until 4 o'clock--blank as
to catching birds but not as to seeing them. On one occasion I had
seventeen of them feeding within 10 feet of the net. They had been
feeding for a long time and had fed from 50 feet away until quite
close to the net. I had hopes and had hardly breathed for over an
hour when a motor car passing along the Millicent Road disturbed
them and off they flew.
Golf is not the only game that acquires a vocabulary.
At another period fifteen were close handy but would not notice
the call bird--I had risked one of my first birds as a call bird. However,
before daylight faded I had caught two more and so ended a most
satisfactory day. Four birds--three cocks and one hen.
Next morning we only caught one but that was a hen so I w&apos;as
very thankful, but, as I could not stay any longer, we packed up and
returned to Adelaide with five birds--and were we excited ?
All told I made three more trips--hasty ones of a day and a half
and found each time that the birds were getting less plentiful and
much wilder. All told we caught ten--three pairs I am certain of and
possibly a fourth. The last trip was a blank as the birds had migrated.
Although I did not catch many, I had a wonderful opportunity

of studying the birds and came to certain conclusions regarding them.
These may be incorrect (further observation has proved this, 1935
and 1936) but until more certain information comes to hand they
will do as a working hypothesis.
In all the time I watched these birds (over eighty hours' hiding in
bushes) I never saw a young one, so concluded that the birds had
not yet nested, although it was nesting time for all the birds we
know.
They were in excellent condition, breeding condition in fact, but
apparently had not bred and were all in adult plumage. Also at times
one would see an odd hen arrive on a tree and in a few minutes fly
down to feed. A little later three more would arrive and perch on a
tree--two cocks and a hen. Some chat would take place between the
hen on the ground and the three on the tree. A few moments later
the odd cock would fly down and feed alongside the lone hen, chattering
in between nibbles at the grass seeds. This incident occurred on many
occasions and it seemed obvious they were choosing their mates.
As they apparently had not nested, it seemed likely that they did
not live in Australia, but came, probably, still from Tasmania and, I
should imagine, from the farthest south it is possible to go, where
the scrub is almost impenetrable. It is cold there, and the grasses
seed about two months later than on the mainland, so I came to the
following conclusion :--\0x25A0
(N.B.--These sounded fairly reasonable and satisfactory, but I
have since proved they were wrong.)

which they regard as a trysting place, there to feed on the special
grasses they like, get themselves into breeding condition, choose their
mates, and when the seeds are withered they fly back to Tasmania
and there nest, finding their later grasses seeding about the time the
young would be hatched, which I imagine to be toward the end of
December.
Other facts noticed about them are that they are much more
sociable among themselves than Elegants and Blue wings.

218 J. F. M. Floyd--The Orange-bellied Grass Parrot
It is unusual for Elegants or Bluewings to join forces with other
parties who may be feeding, in fact they rather tend to ignore them.
The Orange-belly is much more friendly and will join any party
that he sees perching or feeding and will enter into conversation wdth
all and sundry. He is a slow feeder and spends a long time over this
business, an hour and a half being nothing at all.
A very fast flyer and difficult to catch.
There is a certain burr which grows in profusion in his district;
it has a very bright dark green leaf and is covered with burrs which
break into hundreds of points and stick all over ones socks and clothes
when the burr is ripe.
At the time of the bird's presence in Australia they are green and
he is exactly the colour of the leaf, so much so that it is impossible to
locate him when he has walked into a patch of this burr unless he
moves his head.
There is a difference between the cock and the hen which is more
noticeable at a distance than close up.
The hen is a trifle duller in plumage but not much and has a one-
colour frontal band of turquoise whereas the cock has a two colour
band--royal blue edged with turquoise. The hen's body colour looks
the same as the cock's would look with a little dust sprinkled on it.
The bottle green back is very distinctive and is much the colour of
the Turquoisine.
This green shades from the neck over the breast, slightly olive in
colour, tapering to lime green below the breast to the abdomen, where
between the thighs is a large orange patch which is some specimens
may be up to 1J inches in length.
The cock has a yellow tinge in the inside of the thighs which is
missing in the hen. The wings are edged with a rather wide band of
royal blue which merges into the green by mixing the colour with it.
Call much like the Elegant, but there is a difference which I cannot
convey. The young have a faint orange patch showing and faint frontal
band and the sex can be distinguished even two weeks from the nest.
By going farther afield I have proved my theories wrong by the
following facts :--
The birds migrate from Tasmania by June. They nest over in

South Australia in July. The young leave the nest about the end
of August.
Largest clutch with parents that I have seen is four.
They return to Tasmania by December. They like the same food
as other Neophema. They are more friendly to each other than
Elegants, Bluewings, and Docks, because there are not many of them,
only a small community or a few small communities.
Fortunately their breeding place is not known, although from
observations in the past two years I know it within a radius of five
miles and could find it on horseback. One would get bushed on foot
as well as getting very tired walking over scrub covered hills. It is
as hardy as other Neophema and has the same delicate skull.
They have hatched for me, but the young had their heads eaten
(by mice I am afraid) three days later. This article was mislaid when
written owing to changing my abode and has just been rediscovered,
so I have added my later knowledge to it.
(This is the last sheet in the block and there are a few more words
to add.)
I agree with Lord Tavistock that they are one of the three Neophema
and the other three are Neononades.
From their colours I cannot see the Elegant and Bluewing existing
as a hybrid between Orange-belly and Rock. I believe there is some-
one writing to this effect although I have not read the article.
There is no yellow on the face below the eye but just a tinge of
lime green which also shows round the eye as a faint ring.
My only hatching experience was four eggs laid and three hatched.
They have not had a fair chance with me as at both breeding seasons
they had to be caught while I was changing my home and they have
now had one year in which to get used to their new quarters so I think
they will not be more difficult to breed than the other members. The
hen comes into breeding condition much later than the cock.

I have always longed to breed this very beautiful weaver, but hens
were difficult to get. I was lucky enough to get a few of these birds
from our well-known collector, Mr. Frost, a couple of years ago and
some of them turned out to be hens. Some were turned out in one of
my large aviaries, they have always done well. A nest was made of grass
only and was pear-shaped, with a large entrance hole on the side.
The top of a Cupressus was chosen for the nest. By the 17th May
four eggs were laid. Three young were hatched out by the 28th May.
The fourth egg was infertile. All the young left the nest on the 15th June.
They are almost identical with the female but are a trifle smaller and
darker in colour. The young were reared on flies caught by the hen
bird on the wire of the aviary and a few mealworms. Although the
parent birds had access to mixed seed, insectivorous food, and fruit,
they were never seen to be eating any of them. On the 20th June, two
of the young were seen eating seed and one was seen eating insectivorous
food on the 21st. I am very pleased to have bred this beautiful bird,
especially as hardly any of them come over nowadays. I do not believe
this pretty Weaver has been bred in Great Britain before.

and kindly gave me two pairs. I consider them the prettiest of all
the Bluebirds I have seen--the cock being all blue of a beautiful

they did not attempt to nest. This spring I gave them numerous
nest-boxes of different shapes, pans, and a laurel bush to choose from,

and one pair chose a box that is in general use here, measuring 14 inches
high by 8 by 8 inches with an entrance hole near the top 2 J inches in
diameter. The nest was built of dried grass and moss. Actual date
of the laying of the first egg is not known. When examining all the
boxes on the 5th June the nest contained six eggs. Five young were
hatched off on the 17th June. On 22nd June a terrible smell was
detected, and on examining the nest we found that four of the young
were crushed at the bottom of the nest, but the remaining young one
was growing fast. The young one was fed on gentles, live ants eggs,
and mealworms. The ants eggs were thrown on the ground mixed with
earth which was raked over several times a day so as to bring the
eggs to the top. The male bird was the most attentive to the young,
and he was always carrying food to the young, whereas the female
usually had a good fill herself first. The young left the nest on 8th July.
Colour of young, like female with exception of breast which is speckled
as in the other Bluebirds. The young bird is a strong and healthy
bird and very soon began to feed itself. As soon as this bird was fully
reared the hen bird laid another four eggs and is incubating them now.
As this bird is never seen here and is strictly protected I am more
than delighted at having bred one, and hope to have another clutch
soon. The other pair in another aviary has not attempted to nest.
This I am sure is the first time this lovely bird has been bred in captivity.

Our member, Alastair Morrison, came down from Cambridge last
summer and forthwith departed for Peru to collect and study the wild
life there. He has recently returned with his collections and is now
working on them. Of these and his experiences generally we may,
I hope, shortly have a full account from his pen. In the meantime I
give a list of the rarer birds he brought home alive with notes as to
previous importation, etc., as far as the records I have go.
Andean Teal, Anas fiavirostris oxyptera Meyen. Delacour in
Avicultural Magazine, 1933, 21, tells us that he saw this duck in
the Berlin Zoo in 1932, and I think this is the only previous importation.
The typical species, A. f. fiavirostris V., has been in the London Zoo,
according to the list of animals kept (Low, 1929).
Puna Teal, A. versicolor puna Tschudi. Versicolor used to be fairly
commonly imported, but then disappeared till about 1935 ; this is a
first arrival of A. v. puna.
Crested Duck, A. specularioides alticola Meneg. Another first
arrival, though the typical race (from Chile southwards to the Falklands)
has once been in the London Zoo, and once at Berlin.
Andean Goose, Chlo&apos;ephaga melanoptera (Eyton.) Bare, but has
been at the Zoo and elsewhere, and has been bred in captivity.

Andean Buddy Duck, Oxyura ferruginea (Eyton). One of the Still-

first arrival in Europe, but has, I think, been imported for American
collections.
Whiteley's Ground-tyrant, Agriornis s. insolens Scl. The typical
race, A. s. solitaria, Scl. has been in the London Zoo (one specimen in
1932), but this is the first arrival of insolens.
Sharpe's Yellow-rumped Ground-finch, Pseudochloris u. sharpei
Berl. and Stolzmann. New. Common in the Puna, teste Morrison.
All the above came from the Andes, 14,000 feet up, in the Lake
Junin district, where the collector made his headquarters. The next
three were collected on or near the coast.
Peruvian Brown Grosbeak, Neorhynchus d. masesus (Bp.).
Capt. Hammond had a Sporophila-like bird for a year or more, about
1930, which had been identified at the Nat. Hist. Museum as
" Neorhynchus ? species I saw it ; it was rather different from the
birds brought by Morrison, who has kindly given me a true pair.
Another was mentioned in our pages (1931, 227, 289) as having been
seen in a German collection, and this bird was, I believe,
Capt. Hammond's. Except for this, this consignment is quite new.
Streaked Saltator, Saltator striatipectus Lafr. There v/ere two in
the Zoo in 1908, " new," and the only previous arrival.
Bonaparte's Warbling Finch, Poospiza bonapartei Scl. Also new.
A few other species of this genus have arrived within the last year or
two, and one, P. whitei, was bred by Allen Silver in 1937 :

224 W. C. Osman Hill--Breeding of the New Guinea Red-sided Parrot
intelligent cage birds, but the females are almost invariably sullen and
spiteful, though I did have one female E. corneliae that became tame
enough to handle and present her head to be scratched.
This same Cornelian Eclectus was later put into an aviary with a
pair of the New Guinea species (E. jpectoralis) early in 1934. In the
following year they were all transferred to a larger aviary 18 feet long
by 6 feet wide and 9 feet high, with some protection behind and provided
with some old soap boxes with holes in one end, near the top, to serve
as nest-boxes. The nests were all in the sheltered part of the cage. The
female Cornelian almost at once showed inclination to go to nest, but,
curiously enough, the male took no notice of her, being too busy
bestowing his attention on the female of his own kind, who persistently
refused to go to nest, despite the encouragement of her partner. The
Cornelian female was sitting on three eggs in January, 1936, but two
of these were stolen in the middle of the day by a Eat Snake ( Ptyas
mucosus), after which mishap the aviary had to be rendered snake-
proof. The remaining egg, and all the later ones she laid proved infertile,
but she persistently sat on them, spending most of her time in the nest-
box, until May, 1937, when the female E. pectoralis decided that she
would like the same nest-box. This decision resulted in some serious
bickering between the two females, and, if I had used better judgment,
I should have removed the E. corneliae, which was the more valuable
bird. But I did not. Instead, I placed an extra nest-box in the aviary
in the hope that the other female would take a fancy to it. But she
did not; with the result that the E. corneliae was killed by the
E. &apos;pectoralis in the nest-box during the night of 9/10th May, 1937.
Having cleaned out the nest-box, it was replaced. There were
now in the cage only the pair of New Guinea Eclecti. The female took
to her stolen nest and was sitting steadily within a couple of weeks from
the calamity related above. She has continued to sit steadily ever
since, and during that time has reared three families, each consisting
of a single bird, and is at present engaged in dealing with a fourth.
She is very solicitous for her eggs and her babies, and will sit in the box
even it is taken down for the purpose of repairs, which has happened on
one occasion when a hole was found in it, through which her eggs kept
falling out and getting smashed.

W. C. Osman Hill--Breeding of the New Guinea Red-sided Parrot 225
As far as I have been able to ascertain, the incubation period is
between six and seven weeks. Although the nestlings are very silent
as a rule, they occasionally make a faint squeaking noise, and the
first time this was heard was on July 1st--seven and a half weeks after
the death of the Cornelian Eclectus. This squeak has been heard at
least once with all the broods so far produced. The babies remain in
the nest until they are fully fledged, making a dramatic appearance
beside their parents, whom they almost approach in size and beauty
of plumage. This gives them three to three and a half months in the
nest after hatching. The mother's habits suddenly change when her
eggs have hatched. Whereas she sits tightly during the incubation
period, rarely leaving the nest, and being fed by the male, once the
babies are out, she comes out more frequently and for longer periods.
She still has to be fed by the male, but whilst this is being done she makes
a peculiar guttural sound, repeated many times as if demanding the
job to be speeded up so that she can carry the nourishment to her
family, which, when the male has disgorged sufficient, she promptly
does. This process is repeated every quarter of an hour or twenty
minutes for the first week or two, but thereafter, it slackens off, and
the female takes some food herself from the seed-tin, in addition to what
she receives from the male.
Eggs. --The eggs are of the usual type among Parrots, rather rounded
and pure white in colour. They are about the size of a pigeon's egg,
but more rounded and less glossy. They are thus rather on the small
size considering the size of the bird.
The Newly-hatched Young. --This has not yet been seen, as I have
never disturbed the female by peeping into the nest when she has a
baby within. I presume, however, that the young are hatched naked,
as in other members of the family.
The Fully-fledged Young. --Although Eclecii have been bred in
captivity before on at least two occasions, according to Tavistock
(1929), once in Germany and once in Perthshire, Scotland, no certain
record seems to have been made regarding the occurrence or otherwise
of sexual dichromatism in the newly-fledged young. The German record
seems to be the same as the one mentioned by Russ as that of Frenzel
of Freiburg. Anyway, I can now positively affirm that the sexes are

The baby does not leave the nest on first looking out from the entrance
hole. In two cases it was not till the following day, but in the last
case, the baby crept out the same day. The baby goes back to the nest-
box to sleep at night for a night or two, but afterwards roosts on a
perch beside its father or elder brothers and sisters.
Although in general colour the newly fledged young resemble their
parents, according to sex, there are differences, rendering the young
easily distinguishable. In both cases the young is not quite so large
as its parent, though this was more noticeable in the case of the young
male than with the two female babies. The other differences concern
coloration and are different in the two sexes, as follows :--
Female .--The red in the plumage, especially on the neck and breast,
is duller than in the adult. The baby lacks the ring of blue feathers
round the eye. There is less yellowish colour in the tips of the tail
feathers. The beak is patchy, being a dirty yellow with black smudges.
The iris is dark thoughout, thus lacking the hawk-like aspect produced
by the creamy-white iris of the adult female. The beak gradually
blackens to a uniform black tint, but the light iridial ring does not
appear till the bird is about a year old. The same applies to the ring of
blue feathers around the eye.
Male .--Green like the adult, but the hair-like feathers of the head,
neck and breast are duller and coarser in appearance. The red on the
flanks is present and may extend in a patchy manner on to the tips
of some of the breast feathers. In the single male so far produced, this
condition was present in the left side only. The bill is patchy, as in the
young female, but is more black than yellowish, the black areas

gradually being lost till the adult condition is attained. The iris
is uniformly dark, as in the young female.
In conclusion I should add that the breeding of Eclectus seems to
be a continuous process once having begun. As soon as one baby
leaves the nest the mother proceeds to deposit another egg and to
commence its incubation. She has no resting period between broods.
It may even occur, though I have not proved this, that eggs are laid *
before the previous brood has left the nest, so that the latter assist
in the incubation of the next brood.

BREEDING OF MITCHELL'S LORIKEET
{TRICHOGLOSSUS MITCHELL !, G. R Gray)
IN CAPTIVITY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9270202" page_id="56318995"  page_num="227" year="" vol="">
By W. C. Osman Hill, M.D.
Mitchell's Lorikeet ( Trichoglossus mitchelli G. B. Gray) is one of
the rarer Streaked-headed Lories and is believed to come from Lombok,
thus being the most westerly of the whole family in its distribution.
Specimens are not often come across in captivity, and, as far as I can
gather, it does not appear to have been bred ; hence my putting on
record the following details.
I commenced with six birds of this species, purchased on board a
ship in Colombo harbour in April and May, 1932. They were put into a
large flight cage with some Swainson's Lorikeets ( T . moluccanus ),
but neither they, nor the Swainson's, had made any efforts to nest till
1937. By this time the Mitchell's had dwindled to a single pair, having
been killed off, one at a time, by injuries from other birds or from
unknown causes. The last two, however, were suspected to be a true
pair on account of their behaviour, and the presumed male was note-
worthy for his deeper scarlet chest. For a period during early 1937
they were the sole occupants of the aviary and the female made several
ineffectual attempts at nesting in hollowed stems of coco-nut palms, the
centre of which had begun to go rotten, so that she was able to excavate
quite a long tunnel. All the efforts came to nought and, as no further

indication of nesting was evident, I placed a pair of Swainson's in with
them again.
In October, 1937, however, they were again prospecting for a
suitable nesting site, and by the end of that month the female was
believed to be sitting on eggs in an artificially hollowed tree stem,
18 inches long, with a hole, 3 inches in diameter, near the top. Except
at night, the mother bird spent little time on the eggs, and it was not
until 29th November, when babies' voices were heard in the nest-box,
that one could be really certain that a family was in fact being reared.
I looked into the nest-box, with the aid of a torch and mirror, on
14th December, and saw one baby, of fair size, covered all over with
grey down. I should not have interfered to this extent, had it not been
for the fact that I w r as forced to enter the aviary to catch up the
Swainson's as the parent Mitchell's were worried for their family and
were boldly attacking the innocent Swainson's. As I happened to be
in the cage, therefore, I decided to peep in the nest-box, with the above
result.
All went well after the removal of the Swainson's, and, as the
Mitchell's did not mind my looking in their nest, I had several peeps at
intervals, and found that the grey down was gradually replaced by
coloured contour feathers, and that the flight feathers had made their
appearance. The beak, however, appeared black, not red like that of
the parents.
A baby appeared at the nest hole on the 10th January, 1938--
almost three months after the parents had first been noted to become
inclined to breed. It stayed at the nest hole for some time and was fed
by its mother in this position. It did not leave the nest till the fourth
day, on which day also a second baby peeped out. This one left the nest
two days after, and was apparently the last of the brood.
Characters of the Fledgling .--Both babies were alike in size, form, and
colour. They were smaller than their parents, but not markedly so.
The heads were more affected than the trunk. The most
striking difference was the uniformly black beak. The head was sepia-
brown, with a greenish tinge, looking very dull in comparison with the
purplish-brown of the adult bird. The scarlet on the neck and chest
was much duller than in the adult. The voice was also very different,
being a shrill " cheep

<bodyText confidence="0.990797916666667" page_id="56318997"  page_num="229" year="" vol="">
In ten days the beaks of the young birds were beginning to show
some red, this commencing as a median stripe on the culmen. In
another week some reddening was taking place on the sides. They were
still being fed by the parents at this stage. At the age of six months the
heads have not changed colour.
Further Breeding. --On the 5th March, 1938, the mother Mitchell's
Lorikeet was back in the same nest-box, but spent comparatively little
time there during the day, though both she and the male spent
the night there. A baby's voice was again heard about the middle
of April, and on the 18th of that month a baby covered with grey down
was seen in the box. Its voice was heard at night, and was easily
distinguishable from the parents. The two older babies were roosting
elsewhere. On 3rd May the new baby was again seen, and found to be
well feathered on head and body. It appeared at the nest hole on the
8th May, but went back again not to reappear till three days later. It
left the nest altogether on the 18th May, and appears to be the sole
member of the brood. Its characters agreed with those already
described.
The mother is again at the nest at the time of writing (mid-June,
1938), which means that, here again, as with the Eclecti I have already
written about, breeding, once started, seems to be almost a continuous
process, but there is a definite, though short, resting period with the
Lorikeets, whilst the mother bird is not tied down to the nest nearly to
same extent as with the Eclecti.

<bodyText confidence="0.993398648648648" page_id="56318998"  page_num="230" year="" vol="">
The author, by means of elaborate ringing and by the convenient
individuality of the cock Song Sparrow's song, has been able to keep
track of individual birds for a number of years to an almost incredible
extent, such as makes her results unique : and this although the
boy Ohioan harries her Sparrows along with the "English" for sake of
State bounty, whilst the unemployed are set to remove her beloved
thickets and deposit town refuse in their place. It makes one gasp.
In warning please note the express statement--Song sparrows
not only abound, or did; they do not readily desert their nests and show
great attachment to their homes. They must need it all, though
obviously M. M. Nice has a way with birds. The havoc promiscuous
adoption of her methods might spread ! (Consisting of goodness knows
how many varicoloured anklets on each leg, with trappings for
weighings and wing measurements--moreover the strain for years
on the human, let alone the bird ! And at that, some nests have evaded
the authoress.) Nests badly hidden were found more liable to destruction
by " predators " ; and the removal of natural cover is reducing this
particular population (Interpont. Ohio --Melospize melodia beata)
from year to year ; and with thinning, comes intenser parasitism by
the Cowbird (Molotkrus ater ater) who also has a homing instinct and
a chapter to himself.
Male Song Sparrows have very strong territorial instinct. Half
of them keep to their territories all winter, one at least eight winters,
though they only fight about it on fine days--they take in visitors,
winter only, free--and not at all while in moult. The other half go
south with four-fifths of the females. This makes remating of birds in
successive seasons rare, as late returning hens turn up much too late--
only eight cases, less than 4 per cent.
Migration or residence has nothing to do with age or inheritance--
behold genealogies. A brother and sister from the same nest resided
a winter and mated in spring, only one other instance being given
among wild birds, a case of Downy Woodpeckers.
One male migrated two winters, remained the third. Three males
and one female resided one winter, migrated next, and returned in
spring. Two males resided two winters, migrated third, and returned
in spring. No differences were found between migrants and residents.
Bad seasons, and motors, levy toll on migrants.

Weight is at a miimmum in fall; increases from December to
maximum in January ; decreasing to standard weight in April.
Spring migration is in an early (late February) flight, and a distinct
one later. Some birds consistently arrive early or late ; some vary.
Warmth has a strong influence on arrival dates of earlies, but it takes
marked cold to delay the lates. Young hens arrive late their first
spring, but do better in following years.
The ceremonial proclamation of territorial rights, in which song
plays the chief part, does not occur in years with a depleted population.
Young males warble continuously, but on staking a claim assume the
adult song at once and never warble again. Singing in January and
February is correlated to temperature but not sunshine. Maps of the
district show the same males holding the same territory from year to
year, or closely adjoining. Females return to the same territory or
settle close by. Maps show young males and females returning to within
an average 280 and 270 metres of their birthplace ; of interest to
fauna-preservers. There are maps of nesting sites for several generations.
Cocks arriving late retake their territories from any first year
residents that have settled on them. Late hens usually find the old
place occupied, but there are always mateless cocks. They are said to
pay no attention to beauty in plumage or song, easily discernible in
their degree, in the male ; or even desirability of residence. Beauty and
melody are prerogative of the cock Sparrow. Cocks make bigamous
advances about their boundaries, but they only make the hens furious:
unless mischance has befallen their mates a young cock may fail to
establish himself his first spring but return next year and succeed.
A young hen builds her first nest as efficiently as her last. The ages
are given of seven birds on laying their first egg. The start of egg
laying depends on temperature alone.
And much more--weights and numbers of eggs in successive
clutches--percentages of hatching and of fully fledged young
population problems--but this first volume is only a breaking of the
ground--a rough sketch of the Song Sparrow ; detail is to follow in a
second volume. May it be bound in a permanent cover.

The Zoological Society very kindly lent the Ornamental Pheasant
Society their Offices for the Society's Summer General Meeting, which was
held on 21st July.
The Meeting was a success and there were very few of the thirty-
one members present who did not express their feelings on some of the
important subjects on the Agenda.
After Monsieur Delacour had been elected to the Chair and the Secretary
had read the Minutes, a discussion followed on the possibility of establishing
a " Standard of Perfection " for Pheasants. The subject was raised as the
result of a letter to the President from Mr. W. J. Parsonson, and it
was eventually decided that the Society should complete a paper on the
Golden and Amherst Pheasants, but the other species could not be definitely
defined.
The meeting agreed that Mrs. Cawley's suggestion of the Society having
its own Christmas Cards should be carried out. The nature of the card should
be left for the Committee to decide later.
A subscription of 10s. was proposed by Mr. Beever. It did not meet lively
support and was turned down after obtaining 7 votes out of 31. Whilst on
the subject of subscriptions the Society passed a proposal that annual sub-
scriptions should be paid on 1st January of every year.
The important subject of showing was next on the agenda and Mr. Bennett
pointed out to the meeting that there was a deficiency of rules for members to
follow. This will be corrected, as Major Elliot Benham kindly offered to post
every possible exhibitor a fist of rules to apply to every patronized show.
The only possible improvement for the Journal was suggested by
Miss Knobel. In future the list of members' names will have the initials after
the surname instead of before.
The meeting offered its apologies to Monsieur Malisoux for omitting his
name from the list of editors in the last Journal and also passed a vote of
thanks to the Secretary and Editors.
After a long discussion the meeting passed Major Elliot Benham's sugges-
tion of the Society publishing a Bulletin every other month. He agreed to
become the Editor of this Bulletin in conjunction with Mr. P. J. Lambert.
The paper will contain small articles, news of the Society, and space for
members advertisements.
The question of the importation of Pheasants brought a lot of speakers
to their feet. Rev. Venner was prominent in this discussion and on the motion
of the Chairman it was decided that the best the Society could do was to
support the International Society for the Protection of Birds.
This very productive meeting was closed after a hearty vote of thanks
to the Chairman.
A pleasing luncheon followed at which there were forty-one members
present.

Turdus reevei
By P. H. Maxwell
We have in the Zoological Gardens of London a most interesting
bird from Ecuador called Reeve's Thrush--it has been given various
scientific names by different naturalists. I have chosen to use here
the most simple one. The sexes are similar in this bird. The following
is a description of the bird :--
The general colour of the upper parts is slate grey, shading into dark
slate on the head ; lores brown, ear coverts dark slate grey, no trace of
eye-stripe ; wings brown, the wing coverts, innermost secondaries,
and unmarginated portions of the outer webs of the quills, slate grey ;
tail brown, the central feathers and outside web of other tail feathers
slate grey. Chin and throat nearly white, streaked with nearly black ;
rest of underparts pale brownish grey, shading into nearly white ;
axillaries and wing-coverts pale brownish grey ; inner margins of
quills pale slate grey. Bill bright yellow. Wing with third, fourth,
and fifth primaries nearly equal and longest, second primary inter-
mediate in length between the seventh and eighth, bastard primary
1 * 1 to 0 * 95 in. Legs, feet, and claws pale yellow. Length of wing 4 * 68

to 4*45 in., tail 3-93 to 3*55in., culmen 0*9 in., tarsus 1 -25 to 1-21 in.
The immature bird is dark olive brown, streaked with buff down centre
of feathers, which have also triangular spots at the tip of the wing
coverts and inner secondaries. The under surface of the body is
brownish buff, mottled with black bars at the end of the feathers.
The under wing coverts and axillaries are orange buff. Bill brown
towards the tip. Total length 8 inches, culmen 0*91 in., wing 4-6 in.,
tail 3-3 in., tarsus 1-25 in. It has been placed by scientists in the genus
Cossyphopsis ; nothing seems to have been recorded about its habits.
The habitat of the bird is the arid tropical zone of Western Ecuador
and Northern Peru.

The Summary of Breeding Becords, published in the July issue
of the Avicultural Magazine should be appreciated by all fanciers
interested in the study of birds in captivity. For surely every breeder,
or would-be breeder, will appreciate having so much authentic material
to work on. The preceding article, written by the recorder, gives food
for much thought, and is not only worthy of comment but comment
would seem to be necessary in justice to the vendor, recorder, and the
breeder--especially the latter.
With regard to the " familiar advertisements of aviary (or cage)
bred Britishers being offered for sale at 9s. a dozen ". Now, surely,
no fancier with any experience at all, would take such an advertisement
seriously; as a claim to breeding, indeed, it is doubtful if the vendor
would expect to be taken seriously. I well remember my first visit to
a famous bird market. A vendor was proclaiming : " Bullies, half a
crown each, all bred in my own aviary."
I suggested to the man in a jocular tone : "Is not your aviary the
wide, wide world ? " To which the vendor promptly replied: " You
have guessed right, governor." Anyway, it is well known that
Dr. Hopkinson is far too conscious of the possibilities and probabilities
with regard to breeding to be likely to accept mis-statements or

mistakes for facts. I would be the first to admit that the author of
Breeding Records cannot afford to be incautious, and do not know of
a more cautious and capable man in that particular direction. Even
so, I venture to suggest, a more malicious pretender or wiseacre might
well have been given as an example rather than the man who will
offer aviary-bred birds for sale at 9s. per dozen.
I have not been so fortunate as to meet a fancier who claims to
have bred Nightingales, but have been fortunate enough to meet such
a one capable of doing so.
I have, however, investigated more absurd claims, and am willing to
admit having enjoyed such experiences, and regard such experiences
as part of my incomplete education. The ideal record suggested by
Dr. Hopkinson should be possible with a little well-deserved co-operation
from other fanciers.
Most of our popular Finches have been bred and, in many instances,
have been bred from captive-bred birds. One must hesitate to offer
details for an ideal record unless other breeders involved will give
an authenticated report of their co-operation. At the moment I may,
however, state Chaffinches have been bred in my aviary into the third
generation, but have never succeeded in rearing a full brood. A pair
of Goldfinches bred by myself in 1937 went to nest in the aviary of
Mr. A. E. P. Conant in 1938. The young in this instance were not
reared because the aviary was too crowded.
This seems a fitting opportunity to remark that breeding results
must be poor if Zebra Finches are kept with other breeding pairs.
With regard to the four questions, which if answered would help
towards an ideal record, we must bear in mind that no claim could be
of any real value or help unless duly authenticated and particulars
given. Therefore I must be content to state : " I have bred dozens of
Goldfinches, and many of these birds are still living in the aviaries of
other fanciers, and if they have not reared young themselves, then
their present owners are more likely to be at fault than are the birds."
Goldfinches invariably rear full broods and the chicks uniform as
to size. Details with regard to the breeding of Buntings, Warblers,
Flycatchers, and Waders would seem to be most unsatisfactory, and
therefore there is scope for the maker of history. My own activities

are at present restricted ; at the moment a pair of Goldfinches are
incubating their third round this season. This is quite usual with
captive Goldfinches. The first brood, all reared " on purchased food "
(for the first time in my experience), are all quite healthy birds, and it is
hoped these chicks will themselves rear young for, and in the aviaries
of, fellow members. The said birds were reared almost entirely on
soaked teazle, with the addition of soaked niger and soaked sunflower-
seeds. If sunflower-seeds are omitted from their diet then the niger
must also be withheld.
The second brood, for some unknown reason, seemed poor specimens ;
three of the chicks seemed to have rickets when they left the nest,
which was two days too soon, or too early ; even so one of the weak
chicks has quite recovered and is now self-supporting. This is as
well, because the third brood are almost due to hatch and no
difficulty is anticipated in rearing the last brood, as by that time an
abundance of ripe thistle heads should be obtainable, and at such
times the purchased seeds are not necessary. From the point of view
of the student, the first brood (fed on purchased food) are more
interesting material than are the last. I cannot quite understand why
many fanciers insist on liberating their captive-bred birds. The interest
such birds are likely to afford is by no means exhausted when they
have reached the adult stage ; apart from the fact that it is now more
difficult for many fanciers to obtain their breeding pairs, to breed
with captive-bred birds offers scope for more extensive observations.
It is, of course, better to liberate them than hand them over to a
fancier who will not make a serious attempt to breed with them.
Finch breeding would seem to be trivial when compared with
Wader breeding or breeding migratory softbills, and anyone ambitious
enough to wish to breed the latter would be well advised to
acquire hand-reared specimens as possible breeders. The man who
has enough knowledge, patience, and ingenuity to hand-rear Warblers,
Flycatchers, and Chats is the man who is worthy of profound respect.
I have been privileged to call on Mr. A. E. Phillips, of Harefield, on
two occasions during the last few weeks, and was amazed with admira-
tion at this young man's seemingly casual yet efficient method of
hand-rearing such birds. Such a fancier is worthy of mention in our

Magazine and his capabilities worthy of infinite respect. Mr. Phillips
is singularly gifted, and takes anything in his stride--Finches, Fly-
catchers, Warblers, and Wagtails. One may see such birds as Crows,
Starlings, Shrikes, Wagtails, Chats, Nightingales, Wrens, Thrushes, and
Wading birds, all finger tame and in perfect condition. A few years
ago an article was published in Cage Birds on breeding the Wren.
The article, complete and full, was written by the breeder. I, for one,
am sorry not to have heard more of this fancier's activities, since with
so many of us our enthusiasm does exceed our capabilities. If any
of our members insist on keeping their findings to themselves we
are likely to fall short of our objective. May the writer suggest it
would be helpful if fanciers would hand over surplus birds to other
members.

By kind permission of Mrs. Bunn
By A. Martin
During the late summer of 1936 Mrs. Dunn purchased a very fine
pair of the above species. As I had never had a true pair of these birds
under my care before I was very anxious to see what they would do in
the way of breeding. Early in 1937 a large aviary, specially built for
them, was erected. During early March a natural log was placed in their
flight, and very quickly they became interested. During April eggs
were laid and two young were hatched. The birds seemed to be feeding
very well and I had great hopes of having young Leadbeaters for the
first time ; but disaster was in store for me. Going into the enclosure
one morning when the young were about fourteen days old, I saw two
young Leadbeaters lying on the grass with their heads almost severed ;
it was no doubt the work of the old hen. So ended our first try at
breeding Leadbeaters. About three weeks later they again went to nest,
and this time I thought I might perhaps try my hand at feeding the
young myself if only the parents would rear them to about ten or

twelve days old. The young were duly hatched, as I could hear faint
squeaks coming from the nesting log. After two days, however, they
were thrown out of the nest, and one evening I found three dead. So
ended our hopes of young Leadbeater's for 1937, and I said to myself,
as I have said many times before, now we must wait until next
year ; but it was a sad disappointment.
Then came the spring of 1938 and during early March the old
Leadbeater's began using the nesting log which had been left in their
flight all the winter. I made up my mind, however, I would not even
take a peep.
It was during middle April that one morning I heard the unmistak-
able sound of young coming from the log. The old birds had by now
become very savage, attacking anyone who entered, even to feed them,
and more than once I had to defend myself as they were really dangerous.
All their food had to be thrown through the wires on to the floor,
but I think this served a good purpose, for they seemed very fond of
germinated seed and fed their young quite freely with it. As time went
on I wondered if the same thing would happen as in the previous year,
and that they would murder the young again ; but they seemed to
have amended their ways, and were quite good parents. At about
seven weeks I saw a beautiful young Leadbeater peeping out of the
log, and at eight weeks he was out of the log and flying strongly.
Three days later two more were out, and I have never seen a more
beautiful sight as they sat side by side wflth their parents.
After they had been out about fourteen days the old hen attacked
one of the young so badly that I had to remove all three. I thought
I should lose the one that had been pecked and bitten so badly. It was
covered with blood, but happily after it had been caged a few days it
made a complete recovery, and all three are now doing well and
fending for themselves, and the old birds seem to be going to nest
again. The breeding of these birds has given me great pleasure, and
I firmly believe that this success was partly gained by throwing the
seed on the floor.

It is fitting that Buenos Aires, which is perhaps the world's most
beautiful city, should also possess the most beautiful Zoological Gardens.
The grounds cover a very large area, are finely laid out, planted with a
great amount of tropical and sub-tropical vegetation and also possess
a large area of water which is a great asset to a Zoological Gardens.
In fact the water was the greatest attraction to me as it harboured a
vast number of indigenous aquatic birds. The great charm of this
" Zoo ", at least to a foreigner like myself, was the large amount of
indigenous fauna, large numbers of which were at liberty in the park.
If I sat quietly, I was passed by all manner of creatures, Rheas,
Screamers, Patagonian cavies, llamas, nutria, Flamingos, Egrets,
Seriamas, etc., all the birds seemed quite at home in spite of the crowds,
and most of them, except the Rheas, seemed to restrict themselves to a
certain area. I noticed this especially with the Screamers. It was a
great treat to see these fine birds flying about like Sparrows. The
Screamers are a strange genus of bird confined to South America.

Sydney Porter Notes from South America
They are considerably larger than Turkeys and possess very stout,
long legs, which look as though they were meant to support a bird twice
the weight. Possessing huge wings, they have great powers of flight.
Hudson the famous naturalist, who spent his early days in the Argentine,
speaking about these birds, says, " The Screamer is a very heavy bird
and rises from the ground laboriously, the wings, as in the case of the
Swan, making a loud noise. Nevertheless it loves soaring and will rise
in an immense spiral until it wholly disappears from sight in the zenith,
even in the brightest weather ; and considering its great bulk and dark
colour, the height it attains must be very great. On sunny, windless
days, especially in winter and spring, they often spend hours at a time
in these sublime aerial exercises, slowly floating round and round in
vast circles and singing at intervals. How so heavy and comparatively
short-winged a bird can sustain itself for such long periods in the thin
upper air to which it rises has not yet been explained."
The Screamers have fairly large hooked beaks but feed on grass and
other plants, especially clover which they crop like a Goose. Each wing
is armed with two very large spurs with which they can easily rip up
a dog or cat, and I should imagine the bird would prove dangerous to
humans in the breeding season. When the birds are approached they
will emit a hissing sound and slowly raise each wing in a threatening
attitude. I think they breed in the gardens, for I saw several birds in
the downy stage, looking very much like young Cranes. I secured five
of these birds to bring home but met with an awful tragedy at Rosario
which I will relate farther on in this chapter.
There were many species of Ducks in the Gardens, but strange to say,
in spite of the abundance of water, the majority were kept in small
and overcrowded pens and aviaries. The rarest of all, the Magellan
Steamer Ducks, were kept in a small overcrowded aviary containing
various Geese, Ibis, and other w&apos;ater fowl, although the receptacle for
water was only large enough for a couple of Mandarin Ducks. Yet in
the gardens there seemed to be acres of water with no birds on at all.
Steamer Ducks were the most aquatic of them all and need the most
water and, given proper conditions, they would doubtless have bred.
These large Ducks are mainly marine and live around the coast of
Tierra-del-Fuego in the extreme south of the continent, also in the

Falkland Islands. There are four species all closely related, two being
flightless and the other two being slightly lighter in colour and larger
winged and able to fly. They are a mottled slate grey and rather call
to mind an Eider. The birds derive their name from the velocity with
which they can move upon the surface of the water in a sort of half-
running, half-flying motion. These birds have been greatly reduced in
their natural haunts owing to shooting by so-called scientists, who have
collected the skins for museums in America. It is to be hoped that some-
thing will be done to save these birds, expecially the Falkland Island
species which come under British jurisdiction. In with the Steamer
Ducks was a female of the very rare Abyssinian Blue-winged Goose.
I understood that there was originally a pair but the cock died. I
should imagine it would, if confined to such close quarters.
The South American Geese were, strange to say, very poorly
represented, I only saw pairs of the well-known Magellan Geese,
but as most of these birds were also confined to small aviaries they did
not appear to be in good condition. This seemed a great pity as these
birds could quite easily have been kept at liberty as were a large number
of Egyptian Geese.
There was one specimen of the African Spur-winged Goose. This
bird was in a large enclosure with a good many very fine Pelicans all
in the most perfect condition, and also a host of other birds including
a flock of Maguari Storks, a well-known South American bird, looking
like a very large edition of the familiar European Stork. These birds,
I understand, are very voracious, and it would be impossible to have them
at liberty where young birds were reared. There were also pairs of the
well-known American Jabiru, a huge Stork-like bird which brings to
mind the better known Marabout. The entire plumage of these giant
birds is snow-white, but the naked head and parts of the neck are black,
and below this are two scarlet bands. The birds were kept in rather a
small and very derelict aviary. There were also specimens of the Wood
Ibis, another Stork-like bird, but which is in no way related to the
Ibis. I was familiar with a very closely allied species in Rhodesia.
I noted many kinds of Ibis in the aviaries, especially noticeable
was the fine Black-faced Ibis, one of the largest and finest coloured of
the whole family and a bird which is common in the Argentine. There

Sydney Porter--Notes from South America
were examples of the White-faced Ibis which is the South American
representative of the well-known Glossy Ibis. I occasionally saw these
birds in the marshy spots on the pampas. The flight is very peculiar,
especially when they rise with slow wing-beats and long, dangling legs,
and the extended neck and beak which hang down as though the bird
was held by the wings. An Ibis in flight can never be mistaken for any
other bird. The Whispering Ibis, which is a rare bird in the Argentine,
was also represented. Hudson speaking of this bird says, " It seems
quite silent unless one comes near to it and listens very intently, when
he will be able to hear little sigh-like puffs as the bird flies away. It
seems strange that this member of a loquacious, loud-voiced family
should be reduced to speak in whispers ! " There were specimens of
the beautiful Scarlet Ibis but they were in pale plumage. I was informed
by Dr. Orfila that during the breeding season the birds resumed their
scarlet finery. This Ibis is probably one of the most brilliant birds in
existence, being a uniform intense geranium red, the legs and beak
included. It is impossible to retain the red in the birds in captivity in
England. After the first moult they fade to a dirty pink. It was a great
disappointment not being able to get hold of any of these birds in South
America.
Of Waders, there were some American Oyster-catchers and also
several Black Oyster-catchers, a rare bird found in the southern
extremity of South America. It is larger than the common kind and of a
more or less uniform blackish brown.
Of Cranes, there were several varieties including Stanley, Crowned,
and Sarus, and unfortunately these were confined to very small
aviaries.
In numerous aviaries was a large collection of the smaller Argentine
birds such as the various Troupials in which the Argentine is particularly
rich, the most noticeable being the lovely Scarlet-headed Marsh Birds,
intense black in colour, with the head, neck, and upper breast, also the
thighs, brilliant scarlet. This is one of the most beautiful of the
Argentine birds and I saw several of them in the bird shop in the
Sarmiento, but as I already had quite a few birds I resisted temptation.
There were also various Cow-birds, Mocking Birds, etc. The Mocking
Bird from the Argentine is much larger and finer than the one from

North America and is a wonderful songster. I saw quite a few of these
birds in the trees in the streets of Montevideo. I also saw some of them
being hawked around in the streets of Buenos Aires in small aviaries
on wheels. It was a pathetic sight to see these structures filled with
terrified birds being trundled along in the midst of all the rushing
traffic, with no shade from the blazing sun, crouching in the corners
too frightened to move. The victims were mainly Chingolo Song
Sparrows, Mocking Birds, Cow-birds, and Red-bellied Thrushes, the
latter being a favourite cage bird in South America and one sees dozens
of them in the bird shops in Buenos Aires, the price varies according to
the vocal accomplishments of the bird.
In a small aviary in the Gardens were three species of Tinamus,
the Rufous, the Spotted, and the Martinita : why they weren't in a
larger aviary where they could breed is beyond me.
The Tinamus are a group of peculiar Partridge-like birds with no
affinities to the Partridges though they are called Partridges in South
America, in fact scientists say they are related to the Ratites or Ostrich-
like birds. They are confined to the pampas regions of South America,
and are reported to be fast disappearing, but judging by the fact that
" Martinita " figured almost every day on the ship's menu the birds
cannot be as scarce as supposed.
These birds form a very peculiar group which differs from all other
birds by their habits and general characteristics which are too lengthy
to describe here. Sufficient to say that they lay the most remarkable
eggs of any bird known, and these an ordinary person seeing for the first
time would refuse to believe were eggs at all. Some are purple, others
brilliant green, and some deep leaden black, all are most highly glazed
and resemble china.
The smaller species of Tinamus are very attractive as aviary birds
and I would have liked to have brought some back with me but I had
to draw the line somewhere. I had had enough of bringing so many
birds back that I had not a minute's spare time on board the ship, and
having to overstock my aviaries when I got home.
A bird seen at liberty in the Gardens was the well-known Spur-
winged Plover, one of the most familiar birds of the Argentine, where
it is known as the " Teru-Teru " from its call; a great many of these

oioubtedly a bird of great character. Years ago I had a couple but
;ey were killed by a pair of Occipital Blue Pies.
I noticed in the Gardens quite a few of those delightful birds the
Brazilian Stilts, one of the most beautiful and graceful of the waders.
Their grace is comparable with that of the smaller Egrets. I did not
bring many birds back with me as I had little room in my aviaries,
but besides the birds already mentioned I did purchase a pair of these
birds from the shop in the Sarmiento. " Brazilian " is rather a misnomer
as the birds are found throughout the whole of South America. They
are the most delightful creatures but very sensitive to cold and they
cannot stand the cold, wet ground outdoors in England. I lost my
pair through letting them run about in a damp spot near my duck
pond. The damp, cold clay affected their feet even though it was summer
time and they died. The central aviary in the Small Bird House at the
London Zoo is an ideal place for these birds.
I tried also to get hold of some of those strange birds, the Seed
Snipes, though quite why they are called " Snipe " I do not know.
However I was unable to get any as I was not in the Argentine when
they were due to arrive on migration from Patagonia.
There were numerous Rails, the most attractive of these I thought
was a tiny red bird, only about the size of a Sparrow, and which I
believe is known scientifically as Laterallus melanphius.
There were a great many Egrets, both the large, Ardea egretta, and
the small A. candidissima , or Snowy Egret. With the exception of some
of the latter birds in an aviary, all the Egrets were at liberty and full-
winged. These birds were to be seen in small flocks and very lovely
they looked in the full finery of their nuptual plumage, sporting them-
selves in the dark foliaged trees overhanging the water. The Great
White Egrets were particularly attractive and it was a great joy to see

these stately white birds with their gleaming, ethereal, white plumage
and long trains of delicate plumes trailing behind them, slowly wading
about in the shallow waters of the lakes. No living animal possesses
such grace as these birds. Seen in a European Zoo minus their long
aigrettes and with their plumage soiled and stained from the sooty
atmosphere, they bear no resemblance to these birds in a state of
freedom.
There was one fairly large aviary planted with oleanda trees
in which were a good many Snowy Egrets besides other small wading
birds ; Dr. Orfila, the director of ornithology, told me that the Egrets
bred regularly in this aviary and reared their young solely on raw meat.
I noticed, however, that the birds were continually fighting, though
whether they ever seriously injured each other I do not know. Egrets
are certainly very quarrelsome birds, even though they are gregarious
in their wild state, but even at the nesting colonies there is a great deal
of squabbling. The stock-in-trade of the bird shop in the Sarmiento
in Buenos Aires appeared to be Snowy Egrets, these, compared to the
wild birds were almost unrecognizable, being a very miserable state
and very dirty ; there was only one fully plumaged male amongst
them and this I purchased with three others. I never saw birds bicker
and squabble as they did on board the ship coming home. I had them
in a large crate and, incredible as it may seem, one pair tried to nest.
Since I have had them in a large pond aviary at home they have made
no further attempt to reproduce.
Many years ago when seeing my first wild Egret in the full glory
of its filmy nuptial plumage, with its dazzling whiteness and perfect
shape, I thought it the most beautiful bird in the world and after many
years and seeing many of the world's most beautiful birds I still think
the same. These lovely birds were the chief victims of the plume
hunter, and years ago in spite of the birds' having a very wide range,
it seemed as though they would be brought to extinction. Even now,
after years of rigid protection in nearly every country where they are
found, there is but the merest semblance of their former numbers.
Unfortunately at the present time in spite of the prohibition of the
importation of plumage into this country, large consignments of
Egret feathers are smuggled in and the " Osprey ", as these feathers

are called, are to-day as common in the West End of London Millinery
shops as before the prohibition. In fact " Ospreys " are now used for
dress trimmings and one sees in the windows of some of the exclusive
dress-making establishments evening dresses with the whole corsage
made of Egret feathers. Quite a lot of these feathers are smuggled in
the false bottoms of egg crates from China.
The filamentous plumes grow on the head, breast, and back of the
bird and when it is displaying or fighting the bird seems enveloped in
a filmy haze of these plumes. The Great White Egret only possesses
the elongated plumes on the back. These are not erectile as in the smaller
bird but the feathers form a graceful train which covers the back and
projects some length beyond the tail. There were other species of
Herons in the Gardens but, with the exception of several magnificent
Cocoi Herons, they were not at liberty like the Egrets. The Cocoi
Heron which is found throughout the whole of South America is one
of the finest Herons in existence and old adult birds seem to be a mass
of beautiful elongated pale grey plumes. The birds both in shape and
movements are always the acme of stately dignity.
There were specimens of the beautiful Whistling Heron ( Ardei
sibilatrix) a local bird, clad in raiment of the softest pastel greys,
primrose yellow, chestnut, black and white. I noticed also a specimen
of the Pileated Heron [Philherodias jpileatus), another of the lovely
South American Herons, its beauty being enhanced by a large patch
of brilliant verdigris-blue skin on the face, which contrasted vividly
with the snow-white plumage and black cap. There were many other
local species, such as Butoridus striata, B. cyanurus, A. involucris,
N. obscurus, Ixobrychus involucries, Syrigma sibilatrix, and a magnificent
pair of Tiger Bitterns ( Tigrisoma marmortum). All these birds looked
in perfect condition, which I suppose was mainly due to the fine climate
of Buenos Aires, for all the birds were fed solely on raw meat and some
were confined in not too large aviaries.
There was a large flock of Koseate Spoonbills {Ajaja rosea), perhaps
the most beautiful of all the waders. These birds were at complete
liberty and were not pinioned ; they lived around one of the lakes
where they could be seen wading up to the thighs and " spooning "
the water with a systematic left and right swinging movement as they

stalked along. These birds are a lovely rich raspberry pink, looking
almost as though they had been dyed, the lesser wing coverts, tail
coverts, and a tuft at the base of the neck are brilliant carmine, the
feathers being hair-like and resemble spun glass, by a strange contrast
the tail is orange buff, the feathers having red shafts. The head of
this bird is bare of feathers and the skin wrinkled : this rather detracts
from its beauty and give the head a rather vulturine look. I was told
that although the birds had been in the gardens for many years, they
had never attempted to nest; which in a w^ay was not to be wondered at,
as there was no suitable nesting site in the way of a natural reed bed.
I thought I was fortunate in being able to secure a pair of these beautiful
birds but I lost the male in the awful holocaust at Rosario, but more of
that anon. These Spoonbills lose their red in captivity and never
regain it even though fed on live food ; after the moult the birds are a
dirty pale pink, and they never seem to regain the spun-glass-like
feathers.
There were a good many Flamingos in the Gardens. These, too, were
at liberty, but I suppose they must have been pinioned. They were
in perfect condition and looked very lovely, either wading in the
water, almost submerged, or standing beneath the great sub-tropical
trees. These birds, like the Spoonbills, retained their red plumage.
I only noticed the one species, P. chilensis, though there are two species
in South America, the other being P. andenus, which is the most
beautiful of all the Flamingos.
I noticed a few specimens of that strange, Goose-like Swan, the
Coscoroba Swan. I saw but few of these birds in the Argentine, and
should judge that they are not common. The legs, feet, and beak of
these birds look as though they had been painted with a very crude kind
of brilliant pink paint. There were only five specimens of the Black-
necked Swan. I think this species has greatly decreased ; once it was
found in countless thousands. I very much regretted to see at Rio
Grande do Sul in Brazil that there was quite a large industry in the
skins of this species and at a local industries exhibitioij was shown a
great number of articles made from the skins of these birds, from which
the feathers had been removed, leaving the down. There were powder
puffs, women's jackets, bedspreads, trimmings for dresses, etc. I was

very surprised indeed at this, because of the strict bird protection now
prevailing in Brazil, but no doubt this bird is exempt from protection
as it is a commercial proposition. It is very difficult to bring about the
protection of any bird if there are commercial interests at stake. It is
a pity that some international bird protection society cannot do some-
thing about this, for I am sure that a few more years will see the
extinction of this fine bird. I was told that the great Lac do Patos,
once the home of millions of waterfowl, used to be the home of thousands
of these Swans, but now few, if any, were ever seen. Hudson states
that in his day (the mid-nineteenth century) these birds were very
common in the Argentine.

that some twenty quarto pages will scarcely suffice to list the orders,
families, genera, and species of birds in East and West Canada--as
many volumes might be filled in describing them.
In this short paper it is necessary to confine attention to three or
four birds of interest, the hope being that such an account, brief and
bare as it must necessarily be, will induce a few readers to bestow at
least a few hours' study on the Birds of Canada. One of the best and
most useful books to consult before visiting the Dominion for research
is that published by the Musson Book Co., Ltd., of Toronto, this year,
which is worth its weight in gold to those ardently seeking reliable
information on the subject, unloaded with extraneous matter. The
scope of the book is such that it deals with all kinds of birds known to
occur in Canada and its commonsense systematic arrangement avoids
the antiquated misleading statements made by some authors of the
elder school.

J. Cassidy -- The Birds of Canada 255
The Loon
The Loon Family, Gavidas, includes the Common Loon, the
Yellow-billed Loon, the Arctic Loon, and the Ked-throated Loon.
The Common Loon is a great plunger. Probably few people who
know well the waterways and lakes of Canada have missed the loud
laugh of the Loon, or the strange wild notes that it gives forth at
times. Up, up, up goes the initial note, then a fall, sudden and
unexpected.
The Loon is a great weather-prophet. Sometimes, perhaps at night,
before the coming of a storm the Loons call to each other and seem
to utter warnings, maybe comments, on the approaching disturbances.
Here is a precise description of the bird, given by that Prince of
Ornithologists, P. A. Taverner, to whose book we have already directed
attention, as published by Messrs. Musson, of Toronto. He writes :
" The Loons are large divers, with straight, sharply-pointed bills and
with the feet fully webbed. In the adult state they are coloured in
strikingly contrasting patterns, mostly black and white. They are
larger than Ducks and with shorter necks than Geese ; tails more
evident than in the Grebes (near relatives of the Loons) ; their size,
length of neck and bill, the trailing feet behind the tail, are reliable
field marks. They nest on low shores in the immediate vicinity of
water where they can dive almost directly from the nest."
It is one thing to dive, but quite another to rise from the water.
The Grebes can do both easily, but although the Loon is a better diver
than the Grebe it certainly rises far less easily from the water. A
good breeze helps the Loon over the surface of the water and prevents
the long splashing start which otherwise they seem to require before
becoming wing-borne.
The food of the Loon consists of small fish, but as only few Loons
are found in any one locality they cannot be blamed for economic
consequences.
The Loons do not like to have neighbours too close to them. Their
method of driving away such is curious. To free their immediate
neighbourhood from Ducks, Coots, and similar water birds they
attack from under water, harassing the unwelcome neighbours until
they quit to escape the trouble. As though to make up for this

J. Cassidy--The Birds of Canada
propensity the Loons seldom resort to waters that are attractive to
other birds. This generally ensures them the solitude they prefer.
It is interesting to notice the smallness of the gullet of the Loon
in proportion to the size of the bird. This natural distinction ensures
that only small fish are taken. The few Loons on small lakes and the
small number of fish in such lakes together with the large number of
fish in large lakes makes the fishing done by the Loon quite unimportant
economically, thus removing any justification for the destruction of
Loons.
Leaving any further consideration of the Loon family we now
consider, briefly, the largest of Canadian birds. This bird is found in
the Sub-Order Pelicani ; Family Pelicanoidea. The two species we
have in mind are the White Pelican and the Brown Pelican.
The White Pelican is a huge bird, about 5 ft. 4 hi. long. Its body
is pure white ; its wings black ; its bill is flattened and frequently
measures over 1 foot. Its most distinguishing feature is a great yellow
throat-pouch, capable of holding several quarts. Mr. Taverner's
remarkable description deserves quotation word by word. He writes :
" The ponderously serious flight of these great white birds, with their
slow beat, beat, beat and then a long dignified sail, is a common sight
near the larger prairie waters as they wing back and forth between
the lakes and feeding grounds. They fly in long evenly-spaced lines,
abreast, in tandem, or in V's. Pelicans are communists, individualism
is unknown among them. The way one faces they all face ; as one
poses they all pose. Standing on a bare sand-bar, they line up in
military formation and digest their dinners together. Plying they
assume their appointed positions, and taking the beat from their
leader keep time with him, flapping and sailing together. No more
beautiful sight may be seen on the prairies than a long line of the
great white birds, black pinioned, with golden pouches tucked under
their chins, all sparkling in the sunlight in brilliant contrast with the
deep blue water or azure sky."
It is absorbingly interesting to watch the Pelicans feeding as, with
head held high, the long bill turned down against the breast, they paddle
about in the water below.
Suddenly the bill is opened and plunged down and forward, the

food has been sighted, probably some small and sluggish fish of the
weedy shallows. The victim is scooped up and either swallowed at
once or stowed away in the roomy pouch to be fed later to the fledglings
at home. Pelicans work hard for their living, frequently travelling
many miles in their food-hunts. It may certainly be claimed that they
offer one of the finest and most attractive features of the prairies.
Their nests are made in large communities, generally on islands in
the larger lakes. Thus they ensure comparative freedom from their
natural enemies. Unfortunately this immunity from attack by foxes,
coyotes, etc., does not secure them from attacks by men who, when
it suited them, have not hesitated to fatten their pigs on the eggs and
young of the Pelican.
The home of the Brown Pelican is the United States rather than
Canada. This bird is smaller than the White Pelican. It makes occasional
visits to Nova Scotia and Southern British Columbia. Its habits are
similar to those of the White Pelican. Its throat-pouch is dark brown
in colour.
One of the most beautiful and useful of the small birds of Canada
is the " Cardinal " or " Bed-Bird
For careful and commonsense description of this bird the palm
should be awarded to Mr. A. P. Taverner. His clear and concise
description runs thus : " The male is bright cardinal-red with a black
splash about the base of the bill and throat. Both sexes have a decided
crest as prominent as that of the Blue Jay. The female is warm buff
in colour, almost white below and olive-buff on the back, the wings,
tail, and crest approaching the rosy colour of the male. The black face
and throat of the male is faintly indicated.
The " Cardinal " nests in bushes ; the nest is constructed of twigs
and rootlets and strips of bark. It is made snug by a lining of grasses
and shredded roots.
The bird is found in the United States and Canada, but wherever
it is found its permanency of residence may be assumed.
A second asset besides that of its gorgeous colouring is its brilliant
whistling, delighting all who are lucky enough to hear it. It is of great
value economically, as w T ell as for its beauty and its exquisite notes,
its food consisting of " locusts, cicadas, potato-bugs, rose-chafers,

plum and cherry scales, cutworms, weevils, and other destructive
pests. Not content with all this helpful work it takes weed-seeds in
considerable amount and some wild fruit There is not a shred of
evidence that this bird touches cultivated fruit. Another species
is the Rose-breasted Grosbeak. This most beautiful little bird has a
pleasant song resembling that of the Robin. In his spring plumage
the male looks a gay little fellow, his rose-red breast, with pure white
below and his smart black back, tail, head, and wings give him a dressy
appearance. The female presents a somewhat dull appearance not
unlike that of the Sparrow-stripings. In autumn male and female are
much alike in colouring, the distinction being a slightly warmer
colouring and an under-colouring of rose-red on the breast of the male.
This bird nests in bushes or low standing trees, is a poor builder,
putting together a loose untidy affair of fine twigs, rootlets, and weed-
stalks. It haunts tangled thickets and large trees, woodland clearing
along the rivers, and sometimes orchards. It is, indeed, invaluable to
the potato farmer, as it eats potato-bugs and other insect pests.
Investigation of its food habits has revealed that the Black-headed
Grosbeak eats three times the insect food to what it eats of vegetable
food, the insects including codling moth, canker-worm, and several
kinds of scale. It should be carefully protected if only for its great
economic value.

A few years ago I received a young pair of Gang-Gangs. The hen
was a nice bird but the cock was a useless creature for not only was
he pinioned (which was not his fault), but he was also a confirmed biter
of his mate's plumage and, in a lesser degree, of his own. I finally gave
him away and last year obtained the loan of a cock from the Zoological
Gardens. The new arrival was not too promising in appearance as he,
too, had been much plucked and was said to be a plucker and, from
long confinement in a cage, he was quite unable to fly. However, he

proved a bird of good intentions, for he left the hen's plumage alone ;
in time grew a new suit himself ; and even got as far as going into the
nest and pairing, though no eggs were laid that year.
After many months the cock regained the use of his wings, and when
spring came round again, he and his mate began to indulge in hostile
demonstrations and bad language towards human intruders, though
they did not venture actually to attack. The hen had been friendly
towards me while she was a spinster and would come up and display
if spoken to, but now her heart was elsewhere and surly snarls were all
that I received. Gang-Gangs are quaint birds in that a mated pair,
though really most devoted, love to engage in mock disputes accom-
panied by much bad language --real bad language, the same that is
directed against an enemy. There is also much pretence of biting
although not a feather is ever damaged. Strange to say a single young
cock at present in my possession uses the same abusive language when
playing with a branch which at present has to do duty for a wife ! This
year the cock Gang-Gang of the pair began to take an interest in the
nest--a hollow tree trunk placed in the flight and filled with peat and
decayed wood--in April, but it was not until 20th May that the
pair were obviously taking turns in sitting.
We did not examine the nest and very little was heard of the young
which, unlike young Roseates and Leadbeaters, make only a very sub-
dued noise when hungry or when being fed.
Early in August a young hen was seen looking out and on the 7th
she emerged--a lovely big bird, much like her mother save that she had
a darker head and some white on the culmen and tip of the upper
mandible. Her appearance annoyed X, who two days later apparently
set about her, with the result that the following morning we found
her very lame and with a fractured wing--injuries from which she is
now slowly recovering. Her parents show great affection for her and
do not neglect her because of her misfortune. About this time a second
head appeared at the nest-entrance and in due course a young cock
emerged who so far has escaped X's attentions. He resembles his
mother in colour, showing the same greenish tint on the wing and the
same breast markings, but his crest and the centre of the crown of the
head as far as the beak, are red.

Both old birds feed their offspring but strange to say are less
aggressive now that they are fledged and do not seem to credit us with
evil intentions towards them.
The young were reared mainly on sunflower, peanuts, apple and
bread-and-milk, of which latter Gang-Gangs are rather fond. They also
like an occasional small piece of cooked beef fat. Hemp should never
be given, nor that abomination--safflower--which figures largely in

When we were all invited to Leckford to see Mr. Spedan Lewis's
birds we knew we were in for a treat, and we certainly were not
disappointed. We had heard that for the last year or two Mr. Lewis
had been re-stocking his aviaries with all that is rare and beautiful in
Pheasants, Water-fowl, and Cranes.
Saturday, 23rd July, turned out to be a lovely day: we travelled
down very comfortably from Waterloo to Winchester, and we were
taken by special motor coach to Leckford. We drove right in, close to
the cricket pavilion, where our hosts, Mr. and Mrs. Spedan Lewis,
greeted us very cordially, and we then sat down to a delicious and
well-served lunch.
Owing to the danger of unduly alarming the birds, it was wisely
decided to split the party into several groups, so that the enclosures
should never be overcrowded with visitors. This worked very well.
Miss Chawner our Editor, who has been in charge of Mr. Lewis's birds
for many years, headed one party, the Head Keeper another, Mr. Terry
Jones, who is now at Leckford, took a third, and Mr. Lewis himself the
remainder. I was one of this last group. Immediately after lunch we
set forth to see the Pheasants, etc. They are admirably housed, in
very large grassy enclosures each with a roomy shed, and a group of
suitable flowering shrubs, conifers, etc., is planted in each, to provide
cover and shelter in the future.
The Pheasants are magnificent, many of the rarest and most

beautiful varieties are gathered together here. There are Tragopans
in four varieties, the lovely Satyr or Crimson-homed, the very red
Temminck's, Myth&apos;s, and Cabots, all beautiful and tame. A cock of
the last-named species especially took food not only from his owner's
hand, but came round to all of us to see if we had anything for him !
Then there are two lovely pairs of the very rare Palawan Peacock
Pheasant from the Island of Palawan, between the Philippines and
Borneo. This must be the greatest treasure ; for when I asked
Mr. Weaver, well known as one of the most experienced of Pheasant
keepers, what he thought most wonderful among the Pheasants, he
answered, " the two pairs of Palawans." There are also pairs of the
Imperial Pheasant, very rare indeed : this is a lovely variety, and so is
Edward's Pheasant, also rare--a near relation with a white crest and
shining green wings. Besides these there are Rheinhardt's Argus, a
glorious pair, Mikado, Siamese Firebacks, Monauls, Swinhoes, Bronze-
tails, Copper Pheasants, Blue Crossoptilon.
In the Pheasant enclosures there are various other birds such as
Touracous, of which there are several exquisite varieties, Pink-crested,
Donaldson's, Senegal, South African Grey, and Violaceous Plantain-
eaters. Mr. Lewis thought, if he were faced with having to keep one
bird only, his choice would be a Touracou ! I noticed also some fine
Green Glossy Starlings, Bartlett's Bleeding-heart Pigeons, and Jobi
Island Doves, Australian Plumed Ground Doves, the cock displaying
to the hen in the most enchanting manner. I hear from Mr. Terry Jones
that the hen is now sitting, the nest is on the open ground. I hope
all goes well---what a delight if young hatch out.
From the Pheasantry our party went on to the quarantine room,
passing on the way pens full of young Pheasants, etc., a
credit to the keeper in charge ! The quarantine room is a building
divided in three parts, one for preparing and storing food, etc.,
one for isolating in case of illness, and a third large portion is divided
into various aviaries, where are housed some of the Owls for which this
establishment has long been noted. Here are Bouvier's Owl from

262 N. Wliarton-Tigar--Visit of Avicultural Society to Leckford
The Cranes at Leckford are a great feature. All are in wonderful
condition and they are housed in large grassy enclosures about the
grounds. Mr. Lewis showed us his pair of Sandhill Cranes and their
two fine youngsters, we also saw an exquisite and tame specimen of
the Cape Crowned Crane ; afterwards on seeing the two pairs of the
Manchurian Cranes I exclaimed to Dr. Hopkinson that their beauty
was more subtle, but he emphatically disagreed with me, in his opinion
the Crowned Crane is unsurpassed !
Besides these there is a Hooded Crane, White-necked Cranes, Native
Companion Cranes, Asiatic White, the graceful Stanley, Black-necked
Crowned, and Lilford's Cranes, and the lovely little Demoiselle, in
fact every variety known except the following : Wattled, Whooper,
Black-necked Grey, and Canadian.
We were afterwards driven down to the water-meadows, to see the
third wonderful collection, namely the water-fowl. Here is a veritable
paradise for these birds. A very large space has been enclosed and
made vermin and fox proof, no small undertaking ! and it is divided
into many wired enclosures, each with clear running water; an island is
being formed also, to house Gibbons' Monkeys, this will in the future
be a great attraction. Mr. Lewis means the Gibbons' home to be con-
structed to resemble a ship. One can well imagine how delightful this
will be, and the whole of the water-fowl enclosure can, and no doubt
will be, transformed into a beautiful wild water garden--many water-
loving plants will delight in the moist situation. A clear stream runs
through this land, noted for its wonderful fishing; owing to this clearness
it was a sight to see the Ducks diving and swimming at the bottom
of the stream.
I noticed three varieties of Swan, the Whooper, the Black-necked,
and the Black. Among the fine collection of Geese were several Ashy-
headed Geese, a pair and a male of the Andean Geese recently brought
over by Mr. Morrison, a pair of Ruddy-headed Geese, four pairs Red-
breasted Geese, a truly lovely sight, two pairs of Emperor Geese, one
pair of Ross's Snow Geese, two pairs Blue Snow Geese, one pair Snow
Geese, and a pair each of Orinoco Geese, Egyptian, Cereopsis, and
Abyssinian Blue-winged Geese.
Among the Ducks there are pairs of Hottentot Teal, Versicolour Teal,

Red-billed Pintail, Cape Shovellers, Rajah Sheldnck, Australian
Shelduck, and one female Cape Teal. There are also Flamingos and
Spoonbills.
After seeing all these, and being most impressed with their beauty,
variety, and the efficient way they are housed and cared for, we were
driven back to the Pavilion where tea was served and much enjoyed
by all of us. We then, took leave of our hosts and were driven back to
Winchester and so home. I know I voice the sentiments of all those
present in thanking Mr. and Mrs. Spedan Lewis for their kind
hospitality ; all were enthusiastic about the lovely collection we had
seen. I should also like to add to this a vote of thanks to our energetic
Secretary, Miss Knobel, for the trouble and extra correspondence that
was entailed in arranging for this most enjoyable day.

As mentioned in my notes last month, our Society propose to issue
Christmas cards for the use of members. The details of this innovation
have not yet been settled and the Committee has been left to make
final decisions. The main feature, however, will be the painting of an
Amherst cock by a well-known artist. It has been felt for a long time
that such a painting has been sorely needed. The Amherst has been
crossed with its near relative, the Golden, for many years, with the
result that to-day it is most difficult to obtain genuine pure Amhersts,
or for that matter Goldens. Many phasianists imagine they have pure
birds, but in reality they are hybrids, perhaps in many cases 90 per cent
pure, but that is not as it should be. Therefore, this plate will give
all details and characteristics of the pure Amherst cock, and will, we feel
sure, be appreciated by our members and others. Ten years ago there
were, perhaps, 100 Amhersts in this country, of which possibly more
than 50 per cent were pure birds. To-day there must be nearly 2,000
so-called Amhersts in Great Britain and it is safe to say that not more
than 20 per cent are pure, a very sad state of affairs. Yet things are
improving, four years ago there were not 5 per cent pure, since then
matters have been steadily improving and in a few years time hybrid
Amherst X Golden will be almost entirely eliminated. One of our

prominent members visited a well-known store in the West End of
London recently and was shown a pair of Amhersts. Now both cock and
hen were out and out hybrids and yet the attendant was most indignant
at being informed they were not pure. That only serves to prove that
our public needs educating to the true facts.
By the issue of this card our members will have a guide, and thus
be able to distinguish the pure from those that have Golden blood in
their veins. The pleasing factor of this painting is the fact that our
President, Monsieur Delacour, is leaving no stone unturned to make it
an absolutely perfect portraiture of an Amherst cock. He will himself
interview the artist and point out the vital points ; the artist will view
a pure bird and will then finish his work from a specimen at the British
Museum. What is the lesson to be learned from this necessity ? On
only one small and seemingly unimportant matter, but so vital, let us
keep all birds, whether Pheasants or other birds, pure, and do not waste
time in hybridization unless there is some specific point to be gained :
this let our scientific friends carry out, for the average man it is useless
foolish, and futile.

A Peksonal Appeal by David Seth-Smith
I would like to make a personal appeal to every member of the
Avicultural Society, of which I am one of the oldest members, to give
their support to the British Section of the International Committee
for Bird Preservation. Aviculturists are people who are very fond of
birds, and wish above all things to preserve the birds of the world,
and especially those species that are in special need of protection, but
they have always been rather suspicious of certain societies which
obtain much of their support from a section of the public who are
rather sentimentalists than naturalists and who have the mistaken
idea that to keep any bird in captivity is cruel. Such people are the
very life blood of certain organizations which have grown rich as a
result. It is high time that a wider view of bird preservation should be
taken and bird preservation and aviculture should march hand in
hand.

<bodyText confidence="0.980356411764706" page_id="56319050"  page_num="266" year="" vol="">
The International Committee consists of genuine bird-lovers who
are not opposed to sport or aviculture. Monsieur Delacour, who we all
know as one of the leading ornithologists and aviculturists of the
world, is the President of the whole Committee, while on the British
Section of it we have Mr. Alfred Ezra, and many aviculturists are either
Patrons or Associates.
The British Section has already done valuable work in drafting and
getting passed into law a bill prohibiting the importation of live
European Quail into Great Britain during the breeding season. It is
common knowledge that this species was becoming far scarcer than
formerly, owing to the wholesale netting that was going on, in order
to supply the demands of restaurants and hotels. Another of their
objects is to secure the adequate preservation of Waterfowl, both in
the British Isles and throughout Europe, before it is too late.
Still another matter which the Committee have in hand, is the
better treatment of live birds during transit to Europe from Africa and
the East. We all know the overcrowded and insanitary condition in
which foreign birds are sometimes received by European dealers, and
the International Committee would like to see such importations
inspected before dispatch to insure that the cages are suitable and the
numbers in each cage limited to avoid overcrowding, and that proper
attention is given on the voyage. This is a matter that has been
exercising the minds of many people for some time past, and unless
tackled by a reasonable body like the International Committee may
lead to stringent laws which will affect aviculture generally.
These are a few of the matters that are being taken up by the
International Committee, and I feel strongly that in the interests of
aviculture, if for no other reason, it is the duty of the Avicultural
Society to do all it can to support the British Section of this organization.
With this number of the Magazine is enclosed a leaflet, setting forth
the aims and objects of the International Committee, and as Treasurer
of the British Section, I feel that I may apply with confidence to my
many friends of the Avicultural Society each and all to become either
Patrons or Associates.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9947894375" page_id="56319051"  page_num="267" year="" vol="">
To all people interested in birds tbe name New Guinea spells
romance and high adventure. Now in these days of rapid transit,
when the last frontiers to the unknown are crumbling New Guinea
has been added to the list of accessible places to be visited. Accessible
indeed even to the most casual traveller. To any bird-lover, then, who
has happened, in the course of his wanderings, to arrive either in
Singapore or anywhere within the Dutch East Indies, the writer would
hasten to advise a trip to Dutch New Guinea. To be sure, it is a fact
that even in Batavia, Sourabaya, or Singapore, nine out of ten people
who live there will be just as convinced that New Guinea is horribly
dangerous and inhabited solely by fearsome cannibals as any inhabitant
of England or America. I cannot entirely refute that opinion, having
lived with cannibals in Dutch New Guinea for a period of months, but
that it is a dangerous place to visit, I am strongly inclined to doubt.
Nowadays the K.P.M. Line, the largest of the Dutch Lines, runs
two monthly mail and cargo steamers to Dutch New Guinea from
Makassar, the principal port of the island of Celebes, itself a two-day
steamer journey from Sourabaya in Java, or four days from Singapore.
The boats are comfortable, with good service and both Sourabaya and
Makassar have excellent hotels.
While in Java I went to the bird markets, in Batavia and Sourabaya,
but was disappointed as the variety of birds was small. Bulbuls and
Barbets were the common varieties of insectivora. Of the former the
Yellow-vented and Ruby-throated were the commonest, both Java
species ; and of the latter the Blue-crowned and the Dull. Java
Sparrows were in large numbers and of course the lit lie Zebra Dove,
or barred Ground Dove, much admired by the natives, as well as the
larger Double-Collared or Island Turtle Dove. A few shops had good
talking Mynahs, but their owners knew their value. Paroquets were
fairly common, all of the " Alexandriform, but in one shop I was very
tempted by a tiny cage full of the Vernal Hanging Loriquets. No
Pheasants or Jungle Fowl were to be seen, but in Sourabaya I saw a

sad looking specimen of Specific Peafowl, in much too small a cage.
But the casual visitor to the Indies would do much better to call in at
the homes of the European dealers of whom there are three in this
area : the proprietor of the Singapore Zoo, who has some lovely birds,
including Birds of Paradise ; the owner of the Zoo in Belawan Deli,
Sumatra (a port which most liners stop at nowadays for a few hours) ;
or a German dealer in Makassar. In all of these places one can feast
one's eyes on rarities that might be months getting into the bird market
shops. Fairy Bluebirds, Pittas, Doves, rare Hawks, Pheasants of many
species, Sunbirds, and even Birds of Paradise can be secured. As to
the latter : a permit must now be obtained before they can be exported
from the Dutch East Indies (not from Singapore) so one must not
expect to travel to Dutch New Guinea for Paradise Birds unless one
has previously applied to the Department of Economic Affairs in
Batavia. Other birds, too, such as Crowned Doves and Kingfishers are
on the forbidden list. A trip to Dutch New Guinea is still an exciting
thing, however, whether one has such a permit or not, and also one
should not be deterred by the thought of such a permit alone. It's
always worth trying for even if one does not get it.
And now on to Dutch New Guinea. Arriving in Makassar, there are
usually a few days to wait for the New Guinea mail boat. The most
interesting place to stay here is Mahno, a hill station about four hours'
drive from Makassar where electric light, good food, and a comfortable
dak bungalow, plus the cool breeze and superb scenery, make an ideal
refuge from the heat of the lowlands. There are two mail boats going
on different routes, one along the north shore of Dutch New Guinea,
the other along the south shore. The more attractive route, both from
the point of scenery and of climate, is the northern one, and an amusing
feature of it is that it skirts so close to the Equator that it is possible
to return from one's trip of a month a veteran of ten or twelve crossings.
I say a month's trip, because for those with limited time at their disposal
and no desire to bring along a certain amount of equipment, such as
camp beds, et cetera , it is far more advisable and pleasant to stay on
board the mail boat all the time with a comfortable cabin and regular
meals at one's* disposal. From this vantage point one can sally out to
see the sights at the different ports without having to live ashore. The

mail boat leaves early in the month from Makassar and returns early
the following month.
Before calling at New Guinea, it stops at Ambon, a small island
south of Ceram, where the head offices of the administration of this
area are situated. In Ambon there is a dealer who is, however, mostly
interested in Parrots. I bought a lovely pair of the Giant Rajah
Cockatoos, Prohosciger aterrimus, from him as I had only secured one
in New Guinea and it had died. These rare birds only seem to do well
on a local form of almond called " Kanari ", although some have tried
them with grated coco-nut meat. This dealer also had a beautiful
Ceram Cockatoo, salmon crested and salmon tinted, surely, next to
Leadbeaters, the most beautiful of that tribe ; and a comical young
Wreathed Hornbill of the kind which is so common in New Guinea.
Another attraction was a beautiful breeding pair of Ceram Ecleetus.
From Ambon one goes north to Halmahera, skirting around the
coast of this curiously-shaped island and stopping at many places of
interest such as Batchian and Ternate--both ruled by local Sultans,
the latter place surrounded by a breath-taking series of gorgeous
island volcanoes. Everywhere here one sees the Halmahera Lory,
Domicella garmla , perched outside the doors of native houses, shining
green wings contrasting with vivid red bodies. Batchian is the home of
the rare Wallace Standard Wing Bird of Paradise. Wallace's description
of the sight of these birds is exciting to read even to-day, and no traveller
to the far East Indies should be without a copy of the classic Malay
Archipelago which describes so well the hardships and thrills encountered
by the great naturalist in the early eighteen-sixties. But this bird is
too rare ever to be met with in a few hours' stay. The advantage of the
mail boat, however, is that it calls at most of the same ports on the
return journey. Now that I have left New Guinea and Halmahera,
I have regretted that I did not bestir myself sufficiently to meet the
powers that be in Batchian, tell them when I was passing through again,
and beg and implore them to send out some bird hunters for me.
People in the East Indies and New Guinea are kind and generous to
passing travellers. I suppose it is in che frontier tradition to be so.
I always&apos; found their understanding and helpfulness to be unfailing,
though sometimes I-wondered why it should be so ; why they should

be patient with a hurry-scurry, wild-eyed person like myself who,
whenever birds were mentioned, was of! in a torrent of conversation and
usually was asking all sorts of favours before he was done.
From Halmahera, the course lies to New Guinea via the famous
island of Waigeo, ten miles or so north-west of the mainland. Waigeo
is the home of the Red Bird of Paradise. It is one of the really beautiful
islands of the world. At Saonek, the port of the island, natives paddled
out to the mail boat with samples of the local arts and crafts--weaving
with palm, orchid and pandannas leaves, wood carving, and also
with a few birds. If they know that there is someone on the boat
interested in birds they will bring many more out when it stops on its
return trip. I saw Rajah Cockatoos, Crowned Pigeons, small Lories,
principally the Black-capped, and a pair of the beautiful White Torres
Strait Pigeon, Ducula spillorohoa. I bought a tame young female
Eclectus here.
Sorong, the next stop, is a tiny island about fifteen minutes, by native
canoe, from the extreme western mainland of Dutch New Guinea.
Here there are many natives acquainted with bird trapping and a word
to the native magistrate of the island should net many birds on the
return trip. Most of the birds which I have seen offered for sale were
from near Sorong. Lesser, Twelve Wired, King, and sometimes
Magnificent Birds of Paradise are all moderately easy to obtain.
Parrots are numerous and of many kinds, from Cockatoos down to even
the tiny Micropsitta Parrotlets, including the unusual Black Lories
and the pale-tinted, big-eyed Geoffroyus Parrots. Also Pigeons are
common. I bought a lovely Megaloprepia Fruit Pigeon, grey head,
neck, and throat, green back with yellow spotted wings and cherry
coloured breast and belly ; a delight to the eye and exceedingly tame.
I also bought a young Podargus, the Giant Frogmouth of Papua, which
sat solemnly on a branch in the hand of its native captor, blinking
its enormous eyes, more like an owl at first sight than anything else.
Here, too, I was offered several Megapodes for sale and was tempted
to take them, except that they seemed too wild ever to learn to eat
properly. At another time, living in the mountains of New Guinea, I
tried to tame some full-grown wild trapped birds without success.
Also some of the big Pheasant-like Ground Pigeons, Otidiphaps nobilis,

but all without success. Even Megapode and Brush Turkey chicks
seemed quite senseless and wild in cages, and would break their necks
if allowed in too big a cage where they could move freely.
From Sorong the boat moves on to Manokwari, the largest town in
northern Dutch New Guinea. There is a rest house here with furniture
in it but no servants. This is the one place which would be most
comfortable to stop over in, either for eight days until the boat comes
back from its stops to the East, or a little over a month until the
next boat stops. A knowledge of the Malay language is essential,
however, if one were to hire a servant from the town for cooking.
Two factors commonly met with in the East present a minimum of
difficulty in Dutch New Guinea : petty thievery and malaria. The
former is almost unknown and the latter, provided one observes the
ordinary precautions, is not by any means to be worried about. In
Manokwari there are a few good roads and paths, of course no auto-
mobiles, and in fifteen minutes' walking to the west of the town I was
able to feel myself really in the jungle. Hornbills flew overhead in the
giant trees, two by two, grunting mournfully, and the gong-like calls
of the Lesser Bird of Paradise were frequent, though the bird itself
was not too easily seen. In a giant fig tree I found a small flock of the
little-known Desmarest's Parrot, Psittaculirostris, while all about
sounded the strange calliope notes of the pied Piping Crow, Cracticus
cassicus. A pair of big Fruit Pigeons attracted my attention, the male
performing his swooping flight--a dive with set wings and than a lift,
just like English Wood Pigeons. Farther on there is a big patch of
mangroves and here may be seen Cuckoo Buzzards, blue and white
Kingfishers, brilliant against the mangroves, and many flocks of
Sunbirds and Flower Peckers along the edge of the road. In Manokwari
I was offered mostly Lories, Lorikeets, and Cockatoos for sale. The
Dutch government believes that New Guinea is a psittacosis-free area
and have empowered the local customs authorities to issue a clearance
paper for Parrots bought there. But it is doubtful how much weight
such a paper would carry unless the birds had been strictly quarantined.
I did, however, buy a pair of pretty green Fruit Pigeons, Ptilinopus
iozonus , and a male Spider Hunter, Xanthotis, a delicate brownish
long-billed bird, which would have done better if I had remembered to

bring ant&apos;s eggs along from Java. There are quite good Chinese shops
in Manokwari where one may buy a large variety of canned food (and
even iced beer, a Papuan rarity). Also there is a fairly recently-
established supply of good green vegetables grown by a colony of
Dutch-Javanese colonist farmers imported a few years ago by the
government. When I left Manokwari an electric light plant had just
been installed so one can see that the amenities, so called, are just
around the comer for this outpost of civilization.
Manokwari lies on the north-west shore of Geelvink Bay, a large
area of water dotted with islands, which nearly cuts the mainland of
New Guinea in two at this point. The mail boat stops at three or
four lesser ports in the bay, one of which is almost sure to be Bosnik
on the large island of Biak. This island, very little known ornitho-
logically, is the home of a large sub-species of the Black-capped Lory,
Domicella lory cyanauchen , which strangely enough is the only member
of the family showing a marked precocity for talking. I purchased a
splendid male, " Jacob, 5 ' whose conversational powers were a constant
source of wonder. He would rattle along for minutes on end in a mixture
of the Biak language and Malay. The tone of his voice was low and so
quaintly pitched that one could never fail to drop all work and stop
to listen to his endearing chatter. He was very neat and tidy, constantly
bathing and preening his vivid blue and red feathers in the half coco-nut
shell tied to his perch. In this he delighted to bathe, becoming so
drenched that he looked more like a bunch of badly chewed rags than
a trim little Lory. But a few shakes, twists, and nervous preenings and
he was himself again, even more glossy than before. But, alas, the chain
to his perch was none of the best. One day in Sorong a dog scared him
and he broke off, never to return. Such are the trials and griefs of a
bird-lover.
Biak is also famous for the carved wooden images of the natives'
ancestors' spirits. These are made by the islanders, who differ a good
deal in type from the natives of the mainland. These images, called
" Korwars ", are among the finest examples of primitive art to be found
in New Guinea.
The port of Hollandia on the mainland is the farthest east that the
mail boat goes, not so very many miles from the border of the Australian-

mandated territory of New Guinea. Strangely enough Dutch and
Australian Papua have virtually no contact with each other : no boats
go between the two places and the border line, drawn down the centre
of New Guinea, might as well divide it into two separate islands.
Hollandia is poorer in birds than the other ports and the short stop
of the boat allows only a brief walk on the shore. The situation of the
village is very beautiful though. The mountains, little bays, and native
villages raised out over the water, for all the world like a picture of
early Swiss lake dwellers, make a beautiful scene. The natives here are
good carvers and often have interesting things for sale. Dutch New
Guinea is refreshing in this way. It has no tourist trade and so the few
articles for sale are most likely to have been made only for Papuan use
and sold as an afterthought.
Serui on the island of Japen in Geelvink Bay is in another picturesque
harbour with mountains on three sides and on the fourth, across the
shallow waters of the bay, the foothills of the great Snow Mountain
range, the backbone of New Guinea, can sometimes be seen. Japen
contains many interesting varieties of birds. I have seen Victoria
Crowned Pigeons for sale, and there are different sub-species of both
and King and the Lesser Birds of Paradise, as well as of many smaller
birds. Insectivora are, naturally, both hard to obtain and hard to keep
on the long journey home. Some of the species of Fantails and Fly-
catchers tame readily enough, however, and I kept a pair of the common
" Willy Wagtail ", Rhipidura leucophrys, for some time. A delicate
little bird which would have done well enough, I am convinced, if I
had had more experience, was the Buby-chested Honeysucker,
Myzomela eques, a dun-coloured bird with a flaming scarlet patch on
the lower throat and breast. It may well be that the honey from which
I made nectar for it was artificially made and possibly contained some
harmful element. New Guinea has a family of Kingfishers lovely beyond
all others--the stunning cerulean and white Bacquet-tailed, Tanysiptera.
They are birds of the lowland forest and some natives are fairly good at
catching them with a sort of bird lime of native manufacture called
" gutta " made from the sap of a tree. But this is a bird too difficult
save for the aviculturist of genius. They fade and droop in captivity
and seem to absorb no nourishment even when forcibly fed.

And so the small boat completes its round and turns back again
towards civilization. At Pulu Dua, a two hours' stop for loading copra,
a Besarese came out to the boat in a " prahu " and offered me his
treasure, trapped in the mangroves of these tiny coral islands. It
seemed well worth his price of half a shilling so I bought it. A delicate
little Yellow Bittern, Ixohrychus , faintly striped yellow on brown : a
veritable miniature Bittern. I let it out of its palm leaf cage, into a
bigger one, but it sulked and refused all the delicate morsels I could
offer it. Passing Sorong for the last time with the tiny island of Earn
just off to leeward, I lifted the tiny bundle of feathers out on deck
and perched it on the rail. Without a backward glance it stretched out
its neck, tucked its gangling feet behind it, and went fluttering and
swooping off to a new home in the mangroves.
And so the mainland of New G-uinea dips behind the horizon and a
memorable trip is over. Evening comes down over the calm water, the
ship heads towards Makassar, and the tropic moon comes up as I go
below to see that the night air is not too chill for my cargo of birds.

Under the trade name of " Pigmy Cardinal ", I believe the first
importation of these neat, soberly attired little birds occurred sometime
in 1937. I acquired a pair of them, in March of this year, and turned
them out into a large, planted aviary, containing a mixed collection
of&apos;little birds. It was not until towards the end of July that they began
to carry nesting material. The site chosen was in the angle formed by
the supports to one of the main cross-bars of the aviary, and very
exposed. The nest was cup-shaped, fairly tidy, and made almost entirely
of moss, and fined with feathers. The eggs, two in number, were
deep cream with reddish spots ; incubation took fourteen days. Both
eggs hatched, the young covered with grey down feathered very quickly ;

the old birds fed on regurgitated seeds, insects caught in the aviary,
fresh ant eggs, gentles, and a few mealworms. On the tenth day, one of
the young fell out of the nest and was picked up dead. The other bird
continued to do well and at a fortnight left the nest, but as it was too
young to fly very strongly, and insisted on disappearing into the thickest
undergrowth, it was thought best to place it in a small cage, which
was hung up on the site of the old nest. The young bird was fed
assiduously by both parents through the bars, and also both parents
used a small trap-door in the top of the cage, which was left open when
someone was in the aviary. From time to time the young bird was let
out of the cage for exercise, and would have been left out entirely but
for the wet weather. By this time it was almost as large as the parents,
sported a crest, and had the same ashen grey appearance of the hen.
Sad to relate I had to be away for a few days, and on coming back
found it looking far from well. It was let out of the cage and fed with
tremendous energy by the parents, but the next morning I found it
dead. I can only imagine that the parents could not feed it properly
through the bars, and the trap-door not being in use, it died from
starvation.
So far, 29th August, the old birds have not made any attempt to
nest again.

its decorative crest. Male and female are alike, except that the female

other birds of different kinds. They built a nest in some pampas grass
at the foot of a holly bush which is covered with ivy--just a hollow
in the ground, lined with leaves and feathers.--The first egg was laid
on 4th May. After three eggs had been laid the nest appeared to be
deserted, but on the 28th May four eggs were noticed and the birds
started to take an interest in the nest. On examining the nest
on 10th June, eight eggs were found and these were quite warm.
A few days later the hen was seen incubating, and several times after-
wards both the hen and the cock were seen on the nest. Four young
were hatched by the 30th June, one egg contained a dead chick and the
other three eggs were infertile. The young and the adults were caught
up and placed in a small enclosure measuring 5 feet by 4 feet by 4 feet
high at front and 3 feet at back, with a wooden floor. The young were
at first fed on mealworms, grasshoppers, insectivorous food, maw seed
and chick food. Three of the young died on the 5th, 11th, and 14th July
respectively. After this we decided to discontinue giving the remaining
young one mealworms, grasshoppers and the insectivorous food and
fed him on maw seed and chick food only. This had the desired effect
and this young one has been fully reared and is quite a healthy and
strong bird. It shows that a good many birds do not require a lot of
insectivorous food and certainly not many mealworms. The chick
resembles the chick of a Californian Quail. As this bird is rare in this
country I am pleased to have bred it. I believe it has not been bred
before.

of breeding in captivity in the United Kingdom, but I think it may
be worth while to mention other cases of successful rearing of that
interesting kind of Lorikeet on the Continent.
First Record in Belgium. --In December, 1935, I bought from a
well-known German fancier a pair of Mitchell's Lorikeets which were
reported to have at least once tried to nest at his place. Established
here in an indoor aviary they nested for the first time in April, 1936,
but they threw their two fertile eggs out of the nest after about fifteen
days' incubation, partly eating the contents.
The pair was put in an outdoor aviary at the beginning of July,
and on the 15th August two newly-born youngsters, covered with
grey down, were seen in the nest ; the 29th August the two young
were still covered with grey down. On the 10th September they were
nearly full size, but not yet feathered except in a few parts ; the wing
and tail quills were showing themselves in sheaths and there were
a few red feathers at the front edge of the wing ; but by far the most
astonishing thing was that all the fore part of the head was covered
with velvety jay black feathers ; nothing to be compared with the
bluish feathers of the young Swainsons and Red-collared Lorikeets ;
the black colour is even more intense than in the adult Masked Love
bird ; the whole of the bill is also deep black at this stage. In the young
Swainsons and Red-collared, when leaving the nest, the bill is reddish-
black.
The above observations were of some ornithological interest,
specially as some modern Ornithologists have supported the view that
most of the recognized species of Trichoglossus were nothing else than
local races of Trichoglossus heematodus. The fact that the nestling
plumage of a Malayan species [T. mitchelU) shows such difference with
the corresponding stage in two well-known Australian species ( T .
moluccanus and T. rubritorques) is definitely opposed to that
hypothesis.
The two young birds mentioned above left the nest at the end of
September, practically undistinguishable from their parents, except by
their blackish bill; they are still alive in my collection (September,
1938).
The above breeding record was brought to the knowledge of

Dr. E. Hopkinson by letter dated 11th September, 1936, and was duly
confirmed the same month by MM. Meerschaert and Happe, members
of the Council of the Belgian Ornithological Society.
In March, 1937, the same pair of Mitchell's Lorikeets, having been
wintered in their outdoor aviary (or more exactly in their brick shelter),
nested again, one healthy young being this time reared to maturity.
This bird is also still alive, but a little later I had the misfortune of
losing the female of my breeding pair.
Nesting records in Holland. --A pair of Mitchell's Lorikeets, owned
by Mr. P. W. Louwman of Wassenaar, started to nest in the beginning
of February, 1937, and I am told, without definite details, that a young
bird was reared. In September, 1937, the pair nested for the second time,
but when one of the youngsters was about three weeks old, he died in
the nesting box, and the other one died a few days later. A pair of
young from the same old pair was born in December, 1937, and reared
this time to maturity, the birds being apparently fully adult by mid-
March, 1938.
I shall only mention pro memoria the first record of the Mitchell's
Lorikeets nesting in captivity, which took place in 1897 at the Berlin
Zoo, when two eggs were laid but no young reared.
I am trying at the present time to rear in captivity other Lorikeets
of the same group ( Trichoglossus cyanogrammus and Trichoglossus
massense) especially in order to describe their nestling plumage, which
I expect will be of the black headed type. Up to now they have not yet
shown any desire to nest.

AN EXPERIMENT WITH GRASS PARRAKEETS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9662554" page_id="56319070"  page_num="286" year="" vol="">
By A. Allen
Towards the end of January this year three aviaries were completed
to a specification designed by Lord Tavistock. They were built
exclusively for Grass Parrakeets. The chief factors incorporated
were : thermostatically controlled electric heating, a roomy shelter
occupying approximately one quarter of the whole aviary, and a tiled
flight containing two recessed openings which permitted contact
with the soil, one containing peat and the other filled to the level of
the tiling with clean soil. These openings are wired to exclude vermin.
The exact measurements are not of vital importance ; I may remark,
however, that the general design and size are the outcome of experience
and collaboration with other aviculturists. They are the result of
an analysis of factors found in practice suitable for the promotion of
avian virility.
Two aviaries were intended to house, respectively, one pair of
Splendid Grass Parrakeets (Neophema splendida) and one pair of
Turquoisines. The third was to house the young, if any.
The stock needs describing, because perfect breeding pairs of
Splendids and Turquoisines cannot be had to order. Here then is
the known history of the two pairs. Both Splendids were imported

A. Allen--An Experiment with Grass Parrakeets 287
from their breeder, Mr. Harvey, of Australia. The hen came to England
in 1932, and prior to coming to us had the following record. In 1933
she reared three rickety young. 1934, one good young one ; 1935, laid
but did not hatch ; 1936, laid did not sit. She was tried with two
different cocks.
The Cock Splendid was imported in 1937, being then a young
bird barely mature.
The Turquoisines' history was as follows : The cock was bred in
1937 by Doctor Derscheid of Belgium. The hen whose age and previous
record is unknown, came from Mr. Whitley of Devon. The cock was
wintered in one of our bird rooms, and became addicted to plucking,
indulging in bouts of gradually diminishing violence. He was not
in perfect plumage when we were forced to introduce him to his spouse.
The arrangements for breeding were identical in the case of both
pairs. Grandfather clock nest boxes were made and fitted over the gap
containing soil. These boxes were constructed of four boards screwed
together and lined, in the nesting area, inside and out, with particularly
rough bark, there being no perch, and a small hinged inspection door
was constructed just above the actual nest level. This was made so
as to prevent the entry of draughts and daylight, but was not
camouflaged.
The Splendids soon settled down, and in a few days gave evidence
of appreciating their environment. The Turquoisines, too, lost no
time, and soon nesting operations were in full swing. During incubation
the behaviour of the male birds gave some indication of what was
happening. At times when the hens were off the nest feeding, the
nest-boxes were swiftly examined. The Splendids' nest-box revealed
eight eggs, three of which proved infertile and were removed. The
Turquoisines had six fertile eggs.
A few days later intensive feeding by both parents indicated the
presence of young ; this was soon confirmed by sound. The old birds
are eating almost incessantly when the nestlings are growing big,
and a considerable amount of food is consumed. Seeding grasses are
much appreciated, these having been wisely planted so as to ripen
when most wanted. There was also a peat heap on which seed had
been thrown down to sprout. Groundsel was supplied, and a blob of

bread and milk was patronized by the Turquoisines. Of course, the
normal seed diet consisting of millet, canary, hemp, oats, and sun-
flower was available, and a liberal supply of spray millet.
A few days before the young were expected to leave the nests,
tbe aviaries were systematically furnished with branches, and in due
course five Splendids and six Turquoisines made their debut.
Just prior to the launching of both broods, the hens, who had
previously shown signs of wanting to nest again, were given similar
nest-boxes, which were installed near the former sites. They were
tenanted without delay.
Our next step was to ascertain when the young were independent
feeders. Here we had a surprise, for it appeared that when they found
food, they recognized it as such, and tackled it almost from the day of
leaving the nest. This observation was confirmed in the case of the
second broods. Nevertheless, a short period was allowed to elapse
to make sure that the young were independent. They were then
transferred to the third aviary, which in the meantime had been
furnished with branches and feeding arrangements in a similar fashion
to the aviary from which they were removed.
Now we were all set for the second round, which, as far as manage-
ment and results were concerned, was a repetition of the first, except
that on this occasion all eggs were fertile, and we bred eight more
Splendids and five Turquoisines.
Meanwhile, the first broods had been shown to expert visitors, and
Mr. Boosey of Keston, whose work with Grass Parrakeets makes his
opinion an extremely valuable one, pronounced them as very
satisfactory.
In summing up the lessons from this experiment, I would like
to emphasize the point, that the aim of Lord Tavistock was to try
to arrive at a type of aviary and aviary management so suitable
that all who would like to keep Grass Parrakeets might be able to
follow really successful methods.
As far as the Barrington House aviaries are concerned, we have
found certain minor details capable of improvement. The changes
when made should facilitate routine work, and we hope that eventually
we shall assist in evolving an aviary which really is perfect for Grass

{Continued from, p. 254)
Perhaps one of the most difficult birds to keep in captivity is a
Grebe, but I saw several of these birds on the small lakes in the Buenos
Aires Zoo. I can hardly see how they obtained much fish when there
were so many Pelicans, Cormorants, Egrets, Storks, and Herons about
on the same stretch of water, but they must have obtained their food
somehow, for they looked in excellent condition. The species exhibited
was the Great Grebe, one of the largest of the Grebes, and is more
Cormorant-like in shape than the well-known Great Crested Grebe.
I noticed a few examples of Belcher's Gull (Larus helcheri) a bird
which seems to be restricted to the coasts of the Argentine ; there
were also some Kelp or Dominican Gulls ; in one of the Duck pens
were quite a few of these Gulls only a few weeks old. I never saw them
being fed with anything, or any food about. I suppose they must have
been hand fed by someone.
In the pen with the Ducks were some Penguins, the Magellanic and
another which I don't remember and which was very similar to the
Little Blue Penguin from the Antipodes, but it was considerably larger.
In with these Penguins was a large assortment of indigenous Duck,
amongst them were Kosy-bills, Bahama Pintails, Brown Pintails,
Grey Teal, which is one of the prettiest of the smaller Duck, Fulvous and
White-faced Tree Duck, Blue-winged and Yellow-billed Teal, and last
but not least the beautiful little Red Shoveler, a bird I tried hard to

obtain but was not successful. It is the most desirable of the
Shovelers.
I had long desired to possess some Screamers, but, never having been
able to purchase any in Europe, one of my main objects in coming to
the Argentine was to try to obtain some. I felt very elated when I was
promised two pairs of these birds by Dr. Orfila but, after being warned
that Argentine promises seldom materialized, I refrained from getting
too enthusiastic. True to tradition there was the usual last minute
hitch and I was unable to obtain them. I rushed back to the bird shop
in the Sarmiento where I had purchased a few birds and asked them
if they could get me a few " chajas ", which is the Argentine name for
them, and is pronounced " Shacar " after their cry, which is said to
sound like the vernacular for " Come back The dealer promised to
do his best in the short time and in a couple of days he obtained five
birds, three young ones and two adults, and although they were quite
tame they were wild caught birds. They were kept for me by the dealer
in a room with five Rheas which I had previously purchased. Here
they were kept for a week before I left for Rosario, a city some good way
up the Parana River. I found out afterwards that the wretched birds
had only been given alfalfa, which is a kind of lucerne, and soaked
bread. Of course being only freshly caught and grazers, they refused
the bread and as the alfalfa was very quickly eaten by the Rheas, the
birds were, by the time I was ready to go, practically starved to death.
I did not see the birds put on the train but when I arrived at Rosario,
a long journey from Buenos Aires, 1 could see that they were dying. We
were taken by the shipping agent of the " Royal Mail " onto the docks
and, on his promising to get a launch to transport us to the ship which
lay some way down the river, we settled down on the quay to await its
arrival.
To cut a long story short, we were just dumped on the wharf and
left to our fate. For a whole day my wretched birds boiled in the blazing
sun on the open quay. I was nearly frantic. I must have 'phoned up
at least a hundred times to the agent and used language, for which
had the authorities known English I should doubtless have been
arrested ! At last I managed to get hold of a motor and found the office
in the city and I refused to move until a launch was found. By this time

it was evening and my fine male Roseate Spoonbill was dead, my
Screamers almost dead, and so were my Rheas. It was terrible. I did
everything I could when I got over to the ship, but four of the Screamers
died, as did three of the Rheas. The other birds were almost at their
last gasp. The only excuse the agent was able to offer was that he
expected something might happen ! !
The surviver of the Screamers, a young bird, managed to come
round after being hand-fed for a long time on tender lettuce. It was
almost too weak to eat this and we had very little of it on board as I
had previously ordered a quantity of cabbages ; I thought the bird
would eat this, but it refused it and no amount of subterfuge, such as
chopping the lettuce and cabbage up finely, would make it. At the next
port of call, which happened to be Rio Grande do Sul again, there was a
rush to the local market to procure lettuce for the remaining bird which
was by now consuming about twenty large ones or fifty small ones a
day ! At each port my chief objective was lettuce ; I must have used
hundreds ; at all events I got the bird home all right but later on when
it was turned into the garden it ate some poisonous plants and died ;
so all my labour was in vain. Later on one of the officers of the ship
brought me another male bird back with him on his next trip, this was
very tame but unfortunately it got into a nearby allotment garden,
where the owner beat it to death, his excuse being that he thought it
was a wild bird and wanted killing ! Later, he was fined five shillings
at the local police court, where the magistrates look upon cruelty as a
very minor offence, hardly worth bothering about. So it seems as though
I was fated to never possess these birds.
To get back to Buenos Aires, one of the features of the Zoo is the
Condors' aviary, certainly the most colossal structure ever built for an
aviary. It makes the bird of prey aviaries at the London Zoo look
like canary cages ! It must be about sixty feet or more high and is
roughly four hundred or five hundred feet in circumference. Here, one
saw, besides a whole flock of Condors which could perform their aerial
activities with ease, dozens of other birds of prey including many
Caracaras of which there were several albino examples and very lovely
they looked. There were also the two species of Turkey Vultures and
Chillean Sea Eagles, etc. In the centre of the aviary was a huge rock

of granite formation which must have been there in the first
instance.
Partly covering this huge aviary was an enormous flowering creeper
and flitting in and out of the aviary amongst the Condors were lots of
tiny Humming Birds, attracted by the blossoms. It was a unique sight
to see in the same aviary the world's smallest and largest flying birds
both on the wing together. The Condors took no more notice of the
Hummers than if they had been the flies they looked like when compared
with the huge birds of prey.
This aviary was certainly unique and it is a pity there are not
similar aviaries in European Zoos for the birds of prey ; for I am sure
the birds would do better than in the confined spaces where they cannot
possibly get any sustained wing exercise.
The Parrot House in the Gardens is an amazing structure, resembling
some Eastern Mosque, with towers, domes, and minarets. I rather think
that the builder, in his enthusiasm, forgot about the parrots or whatever
kind of birds the place was intended to house ; consequently the
aviaries which seem to be quite an afterthought, resemble nothing so
much as enlarged eighteenth century Canary cages, stuck on the main
building at various angles, and appear to be the acme of futility and
inconvenience.
There were quite a few interesting parrots however, the rarest of
which was a Glaucous Macaw. It was the first time I had seen
an example of this very rare bird. It had, I was given to understand,
been in the collection for over twenty years and was known to be over
forty-five years of age. Although its plumage was in very good condition
the bird was evidently suffering from senile decay. Besides this, were
Hyacinthine, Red and Blue, Red and Yellow, and Blue and Yellow
Macaws, also such exotics as Grey Parrots, Lesser Lemon Crested,
and Leadbeater's Cockatoos and the Ara maracana or Illiger's Macaw.
Of native parrots there were several of the very rare Maximilian's
Pionus from the North Argentine, the most beautiful of the Pionus
Parrots and a bird I had not seen before. These I understand are not
uncommon in the remote districts where they live and are shot as a pest.
There were many Quaker Parrakeets, which are still common in the
Argentine. I saw a cage full of baby ones in the Sarmiento bird shop

and I was very tempted to buy them, but I felt that I had enough parrots
at home. In one of the aviaries of this grotesque Parrot house were a
great many Nanday Conures looking much larger and brighter than
any I have ever seen in England. There were also specimens of the large
and dull-coloured Patagonian Conure, a bird which many years ago
was common around Buenos Aires. It has long since disappeared and
is now only found in the remote parts of the Argentine and Patagonia.
I met one very old settler who knew a good deal about the Argentine,
and he told me that though the bird was common in the old days he
had not seen any for many years. This Parrot had more or less adapted
itself to life on the treeless pampas, living and feeding on the ground,
also nesting in holes in the cliffs or high banks, and it was known as the
Bank or Burrowing Parrot. It must be many years now since these
birds were imported into this country but I remember seeing a specimen
a few years ago at the London Zoo.
I looked in vain for examples of another Argentine Parrakeet, the
Slight-billed Parrakeet ( Bolborhynchus aymara), a small, delicately
coloured parrakeet not much larger than a Budgerigar which I under-
stand is not uncommon in the southerly parts of the Argentine.
There were several other rare Parrakeets and Conures but I lost
my notes regarding these.
As I have run on a greater length than I intended regarding the
birds in the Buenos Aires Zoo, I must not enumerate any more, sufficient
to say that there were a great many other birds, such as Darwin's
Rheas, a rare relative of the Common Rhea which inhabits the chilly
regions of Patagonia, Jabirus, also many Ibis, Herons, Guans (including
a very rare black and white one, Pi&apos;pile jacutinga ,) Curassows, Penelopes,
many birds of prey, native Doves and Pigeons and Waders too numerous
to mention.
I hoped whilst in the Argentine to make a stay in some out of the way
district in the far north of that country, and made a short study of the
bird life there, particularly that of the Waders and Herons, but the
attractions of Buenos Aires proved too great, hence the scrappiness of
these notes. There are few more attractive places in the world than
Buenos Aires, and none I regretted leaving so much as that beautiful
city. However I made excursions to the Delta of the Parana River and

Sydney Porter--Notes from South America
there saw, for the first time in a state of freedom, an old favourite of
mine, namely the Guira Cuckoo, to my mind one of the strangest
of birds. I had kept these birds some years ago and always fancied
that they were not in good condition, their feathers always seemed
loose and ill-fitting, their wings and tail always blowing about as though
they were not properly fixed to the body. They never seemed at home
either in the trees or on the ground. In his own home I expected to find
him a different bird, sleek and happy and in his proper environment,
but no, he was the same unfinished kind of bird that I knew as my pets
years ago. The first I saw was when we were sailing down the Parana
River ; they were in the weeping willows and the upstanding poplars,
and they seemed equally as ill at ease as the ones I had had at home.
Hudson in his Birds of La Plata , says, " it is not yet quite in harmony
with its environment. Everywhere its habit is to feed exclusively on
the ground in spite of possessing feet formed for climbing ; but its
very scanty plumage, slow laborious flight, and long, square tail, so
unsuitable in cold boisterous weather, show that the species is a still
unmodified intruder from the region of perpetual summer many degrees
nearer to the equator."
In general appearance, especially in general shape and plumage,
they look like a very small edition of that unique bird, the Hoatazin,
and one is apt to think that the resemblance is perhaps more than
superficial, and I would think that from its general demeanour it is
nearer to that bird than to the Cuckoos to which it is supposed to be
related. This may sound very ridiculous to the museum ornithologist,
but he has only dried skins to go by.
I was once wandering round a well-known bird store and happened
to see three of these birds and was at once struck by their very quaint
appearance, so I agreed to take a pair, but seeing that they were so
devoted to each other and hating to leave the odd one which would, no
doubt, linger in the store indefinitely, I took all three and never regretted
my purchase.
From the first, all three were absolutely fearless. The minute I
entered their aviary, they were all over me, on my arms, head, or
shoulders. Whatever one did the others did : the three seemed to move
in unison, in a kind of " follow&apos; my leader style The birds seemed to

be mainly terrestrial, but they always used to perch at night, though
in the day-time, if not on the ground, they perched on the
lowest branches.
In appearance they were extremely un-Cuckoo like, being exceedingly
long and thin, and I think they could have passed with ease through a
napkin ring. Of a light fawny brown, they are heavily striped
on the upper parts with dark brown and black. With their long loose
and upstanding crests and peculiar white iris of the eyes, they had a
strange wild and un-bird-like look.
Unfortunately they appear to be delicate and very sensitive to cold
and during one winter, when I was ill, the heating was allowed to go
off in the bird room, consequently I lost all three of these charming
birds. They fed mainly on soft food with a liberal supply of raw meat
and mealworms.
When I first had them, they would only feed from the hand, so
I suppose that they must have been hand-reared. They were one of the
few birds I have kept which did not mind being handled and they might
have been for all the world some strange mechanical toys. If one picked
them up by the back they would keep quite still until they were put
down again when they would make a short almost automatic run and
then stand still again waiting to be picked up. Their cry w&apos;as certainly
like that make by an automaton and was something like the sound made
by a very loud rattle. I was very sorry to lose them, for I have never
again had such delightful pets.
The eggs of this bird are certainly the most remarkable in the
world. They are large for the size of the bird, being about the size of a
Wood Pigeon's. Hudson says, " They are elliptical in form and beautiful
beyond comparison, being of an exquisite turquoise blue, the whole
shell roughly spattered with white. The white spots are composed of a
soft calcareous substance, apparently deposited on the surface of the
shell after its complete formation: they are raised, and look like snow-
flakes, and when the egg is freshly laid may be easily washed off with
cold water, and are so extremely delicate that their purity is lost on the
eggs being taken into the hand."
Closely allied to this bird is the Ani, another strange bird whose
general demeanour is very much like that of the Guira Cuckoo. It is

very common in the West Indies and in Central America, where it
usually lives around meadows in which cattle are kept. Strange to say
I saw many of these birds around the docks at Santos in Brazil, usually
perched on the telephone wire.
The first " birdy " sound one hears upon entering the Argentine is
the loud, joyous chortle of the Oven-bird, and after being in that country
for a short time one finds that it is the most characteristic sound of that
land. To quote Hudson again, he says, " At frequent intervals during
dhe day, the male and female meet and express their joy in clear resonant
notes sung in concert. . . . While thus singing they stand facing each
\0x25A0other, their necks outstretched, wings hanging, and tail spread, the
first bird trembling with its rapid utterances, the second beating on the
branch with its wings."
In gardens, in the public parks, out on the pampas, by the sides of
broad, slow flowing rivers, one continually hears these bursts of joyous
melody, though perhaps the birds are not always to be seen. At first
one thinks he looks rather Thrush-like, that is when he is standing still,
but when he moves he had the quicker, business-like gait of a Starling.
The Oven-bird is equally at home in the trees, on the ground, or on the
house itself.
In colour the bird is an earthy brown, the back and tail being bright
\0x25A0chestnut, which rather gives it a Thrush-like appearance, but on close
.acquaintance, one sees the long, slender beak and legs.
The most remarkable characteristic about the bird is the unique nest
which it builds and from which it gets its name. It is a large structure,
shaped like an old-fashioned baker's oven, with the entrance at one
side, but this is long and narrow and leads to an inner chamber. These
nests take a considerable time to make, often many months, as the birds
can only work during wet weather when there is plenty of mud. The
birds take pieces of fibrous material such as hairs, roots, etc., to a
puddle and work them into small balls which they then work into the
nests. These nests are usually built in the most conspicuous places,
such as the top of a gate post, a low horizontal branch of a tree, on a
house, etc., and they are so strong that it is very difficult to
break them.
The only nests which I saw were on the stout limbs of fruit trees

and the entrance always seemed to face the trunk. I imagine that
trying to breed Oven-birds in an aviary would be a fascinating study.
I once had the chance of buying some, and had I have known as much
about them as I do now I should not have let the opportunity slip.
I was unable to get hold of any in the Argentine.
I purchased a pair of beautiful Jays which I think are seldom
imported into this country, namely the Azure Jay from Paraguay ;
a bird somewhat larger than the European Jay, the male deep black,
slightly crested, -with the back, wings, and tail a bright smalt blue, the
hen being a peculiar shade of ashy-violet.
In the bird shop in Buenos Aires were many Owls, mainly the well-
known South American Burrowing Owl, but there was one pair of
tiny Owls not much larger than Sparrows, looking like miniature editions
of the well-known Tawny Owl. They were very tame and quite the
most attractive Owls I have ever seen, so I thought I would buy them
and give them, to a Zoological Garden, as I do not usually keep birds
of prey ; however when I got them home everyone was so attracted
by them that I decided to keep them. After they had moulted they
seemed very much larger than they were before, I suppose it was
because previously their feathers were worn and bedraggled. These
birds were either Glaucidium brasiliensis or G. obscuro, the former I
think is known as the Brazilian Pigmy Owl.
These birds did an extraordinary thing, which showed they must
have a fair share of intelligence. Of course I could only feed them on
the voyage home on meat. On their cage, which was an a 11-wire one,
was a piece of old sacking to keep out the draughts. Before the birds
ate their meat they pulled a large quantity of the sacking into a
fine hair-like fluff, and in this they rolled their meat so that they
would be able to cast up pellets which are necessary for their digestion.
Their beaks are so tiny that one can hardly feel a nip if they try and
bite one's finger.
I saw many other birds in the Argentine, but I am afraid that I
must desist now, for I think I have already overrun my allotted space.
There are, however, two others which I feel I must mention because they
are so characteristic of the Argentine, namely the Spur-wing Plover
(mentioned before) and the Ypecaha Bail. The former are extremely

aggressive and in the breeding season they will not hesitate to attack
anything which approaches the nest. They are very much in evidence
on the pampas, their habits seem very much the same as the European
Lapwing, except that they do not seem to flock and their demeanour
is much more obtrusive. They become very attached to certain
territories and never leave them ; hence when once they are domiciled
in a garden they " stay put " as our American friends say. There were
many of these birds at liberty in the Buenos Aires Zoo, which came up
to visitors in the hopes of some tit-bits or scraps left over from a picnic
lunch. I didn't see anyone feeding them on peanuts, as they doubtless
would have done had they have been in the London Zoo !
The other bird, the Ypecaha Rail, is a bird of outstanding personality,
and in its bold and aggressive demeanour reminds one of the Wekas of
New Zealand. It is a large bird about the size of a Fowl. Although not
possessing any brilliant colours, it is a very beautiful bird. There w&apos;ere
quite a few loose in the Buenos Aires Zoo and these seemed very
aggressive, coming up and snatching food from the hands of the visitors,
especially from children who were perhaps eating a biscuit or piece of
chocolate. When these birds are not persecuted they become very
bold, entering villages and even houses. I would have liked to have
brought a pair of both species home with me, but they are noted for
their extreme loquacity. The noise this bird can make is well-nigh
incredible, so I had to desist for unfortunately I am continually
receiving letters from irate neighbours threatening law proceedings if
I do not keep my birds quiet, but I can hardly blame them, for the calls
of either Eclectus or Argus Pheasants are hardly soothing to one's
nerves !

THE RED-BELLIED TANAGER
Poecilothraupis lunulata atricrissa Cab.
By C. S. Webb

<bodyText confidence="0.995979" page_id="56319095"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
The Red-bellied Tanager is found in the Andes of South America at
high altitudes from Colombia to Peru, but the race P. 1. atricissa is
confined to the Eastern and Western Andes of Ecuador.
It inhabits the well-wooded temperate regions where the nights are
very cold and where, especially in the rainy season, the countryside
is frequently enveloped in cold mist.
It belongs to a group of large Tanagers which might be called
Mountain Tanagers as they are confined to the Andes and include such
magnificent genera as Poecilothraupis, Buthraupis, and Compsocoma.
They are all large and mostly very beautiful.
The Red-bellied Tanager is usually to be seen at altitudes ranging
from 10,000 to 12,000 feet, but it is now getting very scarce on the
western slopes of the Andes owing to rapid destruction of the forest
by woodcutters and charcoal burners who get an easy living supplying
Quito with fuel. Fortunately the eastern Andes are rather distant
from the capital and a journey there necessitates travelling three
days by mule, with a pass 14,000 feet high to be crossed. When this
freezing cold atmosphere is left behind and one descends to about
12,000 feet, the scene changes to wonderful dense primitive forest,
untouched by the ravages of civilization, where birds can easily find an

abundance of their natural food in mountain scenery of indescribable
beauty. It is here that Red-bellied Tanagers thrive, there being an
endless variety of edible berries on which they subsist, supplemented
with a few insects.
They are conspicuous birds and can frequently be seen perched on
the top of a bush or tree piping their cheerful call-notes which remind
one of the African Bulbuls ( Pyenonotus ). In contrast with some of the
Tanagers from lower regions they are easily approached in their wild
state and become tame almost immediately after capture, a fact which
applies equally to nearly all high Andean birds. In captivity I imagined
they would be suited to an aviary rather than a cage life as they are
active creatures and when allowed plenty of exercise can stand any
amount of cold wet weather. It is also when in flight that the exquisite
coloration of the back and wing-coverts (shining blue) is seen to
advantage. This contrasting with the black of the upper parts and the
scarlet of the lower parts combines to make the Red-bellied Tanager
one of the most beautiful of the larger Tanagridse. There is very little
difference in the coloration of the sexes, but the red parts of the
female are not quite so brilliant. They are usually to be seen in pairs,
although a number may congregate in a tree which is laden with their
favourite berries. Their local Spanish name is " Platero

THE BLACK AND CRIMSON ORIOLE
Oriolus cruentus malazanus
By P. H. Maxwell
In the London Zoo are two most beautiful birds from Malay--the
Black and Crimson Orioles. The adult male of this bird has glossy
black plumage with a greenish cast, primary coverts decomposed
deep blood-red, the primaries beneath them white, a large patch of
deep crimson on the breast, bases of feather white, inner aspect of
wing sooty brownish black. The female is almost as glossy as the
male above, but has no blood-red on the primary coverts, the lower
breast and belly is greyish, broadly mottled with black and a faint
suggestion of wine-red on the edge of the feathers. The young are like
the female but duller and the lower surface is paler and greyer, some-
times with rusty edges, the red feathers gradually appearing in the
young males--the primary are the last to become completely red--it
is probable that it takes about two years to acquire complete adult
plumage. The iris of this bird is chestnut, red bill, and the feet are bluish
horn coloured. The total length is 9 to 9*5 inches, wing 5*2 to 5*7
inches, tail 3*9 to 4*1 inches, tarsus 0*9 to 1 inch, bill from gape 1*25
inches, culmen 1 inch. The nesting habits of this bird are unrecorded.
It is nearly always found about 3,000 feet, but it has been seen in
Kinta, Perak, at quite low altitudes. Being quiet and retiring in its
habits, it is not often observed--living alone or in pairs in heavy
forests where big trees abound. Its range is from Northern Perak
to Southern Selengor in the Malay Peninsula. There is a very closely
allied Oriole to this species which has the primary coverts entirely
blood-red, except for a narrow basal black bar, and the patch of blood-
red on the breast is of larger extent.

My visit to Australia was undertaken, not so much because I wanted
to go there, although I always hoped to visit it one day, but more
or less as a kind of duty. People knowing that I travelled a good
deal always used to say, " Now when you were in Australia, etc.,"
and I shamefacedly had to admit that I had never been there !
Australia had never seemed a far distant or even remote country ;
it had always seemed strangely near and familiar, possibly because
I had always been interested in the Australian avifauna and for years
had made a study of it. And as it so often is with familiar places we
seem to have a habit of putting off visiting them until we have seen
other places first. Algeria, Sicily, Egypt, Ehodesia, all seemed to me so
much farther away than Australia.
Perhaps it was a good thing that I did visit other countries first for
had I gone to Australia in the first place I might not have wanted to
go elsewhere ! From the little I saw of it during a two months' stay
or more I can definitely say it is one of the most attractive countries
I have ever been to, and one which every English person, if he has the
time and cash, should visit. Its cities, Adelaide, Melbourne, and Sydney,
are finer, cleaner, and more friendly than any cities in Europe, but it
is the birds we want to talk about, so perhaps we had better leave the
cities to be described by a more facile pen than mine. Sufficient to say
that I shall live for the time when I can visit its shores again and
renew all too short friendships which I made there.
There is little doubt that the bird life of Australia is fast decreasing.
A great many agencies are at work and combined together they make
an opposing force which it is impossible for the avifauna to withstand.
Haphazard shooting with pea-rifles by youths on sheep and cattle
ranches is a great factor in the diminution of the bird life. These
" larrikins " as they are called in Australia go out armed with a pea-
rifle or small shot-gun and shoot everything on sight. I was told of
youths who go out in the district where the very rare Orange-bellied
Grass Parrakeets live and shoot these birds and just leave them lying
on the ground. I met some individuals in South Australia who had

been out to shoot Duck, in the close season by the way, and had failed
to get any--r so we just shot some ' Major Mitchell's ' " (Leadbeater's
Cockatoos). I asked why. " Well, we had to shoot something and they
make a rotten noise anyway That is the spirit everywhere in
the Australian bush. Kill it because it's alive. Of the disgusting
kangaroo hunts, when these wretched animals are chased down at
night by motors and when exhausted are held down by dogs released
from the cars and bludgeoned to death by the " sportsmen " I can
still hardly believe that it was Britishers who stooped to such utter
brutality. A wild bird or animal is, to most of the people in the back
blocks, just something to be killed.
Then there are the Italian settlers who are now being allowed in
owing to the Catholic bias of the chief members of the Government.
These people, as in their own country, kill every small bird for food,
and in the districts where they are settled it is almost impossible to
see any kind of bird.
There are also bush fires. There are very few parts of the indigenous
bush or forest that have not seen the fire through it at some time or
other during the " white " settlement of the country. Every month
vast areas of forest land are burnt, sometimes inadvertently, often
deliberately. These fires destroy a great number of nesting and also
ground birds as well as destroying the food of the birds in the way of
insects or fruit or seeds. Another important factor in the diminution
of bird fife is erosion, which is only in its initial stages yet but in a few
more years will be a very serious problem in Australia. Owing to over-
grazing by sheep and the senseless cutting down and burning of the
scrub, vast areas are eroding and turning into barren wastes ; enormous
shallow lagoons, once the home of teeming millions of waterfowl, now
look like miniature Saharas. As the vegetation is eaten down by the
sheep, the soil is left uncovered and is thus unable to retain its moisture ;
consequently it dries up, winds whip the baked soil into dust storms,
which in time choke up and destroy the remaining vegetation. In
this way grasses, shrubs, and trees are prevented from re-seeding
themselves. Even in places where the vegetation does manage to re-seed
it is quickly eaten off: by the sheep. It is tragic to see vast areas of dying
vegetation slowly turning to what in a another generation will be utter

desert. All this, of course, means death to the various birds, as their
food supply is now cut oil.
Many hitherto scarce Parrakeets and Finches now appear to be much
more plentiful on the bird market and people who do not know the
cause are apt to think that these species are now increasing. The truth
is that these birds are being forced out of their hitherto remote habitats
by erosion and are trying to seek pastures new and thus coming nearer
to civilization. Also owing to the extension of travel facilities to the
remote parts the habitats of the rarer birds are being discovered, and
as soon as this becomes known the trappers hurry to the spot and are
not content until most of the birds have been trapped. This is especially
so in the case of Turquoisine Parrakeet and the Painted Finch.
The introduced fox is playing havoc with the ground birds such as
the Pigeons, Lyrebirds, Mallee Fowl, Brush Turkeys, Bustards, etc.
The fox has no enemies so increases unchecked and I suppose in the
end will exterminate most of the larger ground birds.
Another serious factor, and one which could be controlled, is poison
in various forms. When rabbits were so very plentiful as to become a
menace the " Poison Cart " was employed. This laid poison (strychnine
mixed with bran) in furrows on the land and a great deal of this was
eaten by birds especially Parrots.
A good many sheep-grazers poison the water in the troughs about
the wells to kill the foxes and dingoes which come to drink, but in the
meantime countless thousands of birds are destroyed, as this is often
the only water for miles and most birds come to these troughs to
drink twice a day. One person I met stated that he recently saw and
counted over five thousand various Parrots, including many Lead-
beater's Cockatoos, at one drinking place which had been poisoned.
I was told of fruit-growers who sprayed their fruit trees with poison
to kill the Lorikeets and in one large orchard four dray loads of Musky
Lorikeets were carted away. Yet I was refused permission by the
authorities to take away one single pair of these birds.
Many thousands of Gouldian and other Finches are exported each
year from the Northern Territories, and it is probable that the species
will not be able to stand this continual drain on their numerical strength
for many more years.

Sydney Porter--Notes from Australia
In the face of all these things it is impossible for the bird life of
Australia, as an entirety, to survive. At least a high percentage of the
most interesting and unique birds, like those of our own country where
most of the interesting avifauna has long disappeared, will in the course
of time vanish, and Australia will be reduced to certain birds like the
Crow-Shrikes (Magpies), Kookaburras (Giant Kingfishers), Magpie
Larks, Starlings, Mynahs, etc., and such common birds which have
been able to adapt themselves to the altered conditions.
It would be presumptuous to make all these deductions from my
own observations, but I talked with many eminent ornithologists and
bird protectionists and from them as well as from my own limited
observations, I gleaned the foregoing.
Whilst appreciating every measure which is for the protection and
the preservation of the bird life, and also agreeing that there should
rightly be restrictions against the wholesale export of Australian birds,
I came up against some extremely galling and utterly ludicrous
restrictions. The most ridiculous part of the whole business was when
I was refused permission to take away with me a single pair of Ducks,
yet had I so wished I could have purchased a gun licence for 5s. and
have shot twelve Ducks per day for four and a half months,
thus making a total of over 1,600 Duck which I could have
officially slaughtered. When I mentioned this fact I was practically
told to mind my own business. Barnard's Parrakeets were being shot
in hundreds in the district where I had been staying, but I was refused
permission to take away one pair. When I mentioned the matter of
the shooting of the Parrakeets to the official I was told it was quite legal,
and that " an Englishman's home was his castle ". Quite what that had
to do with it I don't know, but when I further argued it was again
intimated that I should mind my own business.
I naturally hoped whilst in Australia to be able to collect a few
choice Parrakeets for my own aviaries in England. My first application,
for a very modest number of protected species, was rather rudely
rebuffed by the authorities, who only allowed me to take away ten of
the very common Parrakeets which were unprotected. In this
they were powerless to prevent me, but they gave me the impression
that this was a great favour on their part. I was asked in the presence

of the Minister concerned what I did with any young Parrakeets which
I bred. I said I sometimes exchanged them for fresh blood ; upon
this I was informed that I was therefore a dealer !
The official attitude regarding the export of birds from Australia
is almost incomprehensible. Foreigners of any nationality other than
British are more or less received with open arms so long as they bring
with them a letter from any kind of fun-fair, menagerie, or similar
trading concern which likes to call itself a " Zoo ", and they are then
allowed to take away, not hundreds, but thousands of Australia's
choicest birds. Most of these birds, though one cannot prove it, are for
sale in the respective countries to which they go. Unofficially the
collectors admit that the birds will be sold when they arrive in their
own country.
During the short time I was in Australia three such large collections
left bound for foreign countries. It was rather galling for a Britisher,
an aviculturist like myself with decent aviaries, wanting a few pairs of
birds for legitimate breeding purposes, being refused a single pair of
protected birds, yet seeing hundreds of them leaving for sale in foreign
countries ; my only method of getting these birds legitimately being
to buy them, when I arrived home, from the foreign countries where
they were imported ! These things possibly appear sense to the official
mind but they certainly don't to the lay mind.
However, these things, galling as they appeared to be at the time,
were only pinpricks and were compensated for by the kindness and
hospitality I met with almost everywhere I went.
I suppose all of us deep down in our hearts have some longing or
desire ; maybe to have that little dream house all of our own ... to
win a colossal sweepstake so that we can live a life of crowded fullness
... to meet that friend who understands and loves us in spite of our
failings ... or to find that far away land where our dreams come true.
My secret longing was to find in the heart of a vast forest a little wooden
house that was part of the forest itself and where I could feel that the
trees, the birds, and myself were all just part of the scheme of things
---where the only sounds were the song of the birds, and the sighing
of the wind in the tree-tops, and where one could see ranges and ranges
of vast blue forest-covered mountains on whose tops the white clouds

rested and which turned to pink in the setting sun--where all was peace
and quietness and where one could forget the sordid life of the cities.
How seldom those dreams come true. Mine did. It was only a fleeting
vision, a few short weeks of peace and quietness, of vast deep green
forests with trees so huge that they seemed to pierce the very clouds
themselves, of the songs of many birds and the soothing sound of the
sighing wind in the tree-tops, and the house that was part of the forest
itself. The recollection of those Elysian realms will always be fresh in
the storehouse of memory and I shall live for the days when I can
return. It was in the home of the Lyrebirds in the great green forests
on the mountains of the Great Divide in the heart of Victoria that
I found the land of my heart's desire. This spectacular and unique
bird is restricted to the dense mountain forests which cover the ranges
of mountains in the south-east of Australia, and it was for the purpose
of seeing this bird that I made my home for a short time at the remote
house set amid the virgin forests on the mountains of the Great Divide.
At first I explored the lower gullies where dense masses of tree-ferns
canopied the trickling mountain streams, but although I saw the
semblance of one bird, they were not to be found in these districts.
I made my way to the top of the ranges and there, in a setting of such
awe-inspiring grandeur as almost held one breathless, I found my
quarry. I had never liked the inevitable " blue gums " which one sees
in almost every tropical and sub-tropical country--poor ragged things
with scaling bark, lining dusty roads in some squalid African town . . .
planted as wind brakes on the veldt... on the pampas in South America
. . . along dusty roads in Algeria or around any ramshackle corrugated-
iron hut where no other trees would grow--but in their proper setting
they assumed a majesty unknown outside their native land. Here
these giant trees towered up to between two and three hundred feet
high with their tops literally in the clouds. Beneath these forest giants,
living in the dense and often impenetrable undergrowth, I found the
Lyrebird. He is as elusive as a phantom. One finds his scratchings
everywhere, for the Lyrebird gets his living by scratching in the forest
debris with his strong feet and thus procuring an abundance of small
Crustacea and grubs. Everywhere in the area where the birds five one
sees evidence of their work, but oh ! how seldom does one ever get but

the most fleeting a glimpse of the bird itself. A flash of dark brown
and he is gone.
The first time I went on my quest to find the bird I had walked many
miles up the mountain sides and was resting on a log by the side of the
track in the dense forest, when suddenly, from quite near at hand,
I heard a burst of melody which I instantly knew must come from a
Lyrebird. The voice was of such depth, power, and richness that I was
held spellbound. First there was a song like that of a Thrush,
but the notes were far richer and of an amazing quality. Then followed
the songs of a dozen other birds, and being yet unacquainted with most
of the Australian bird songs I failed to recognize some of them, but
there was the creaking call of the Gang-gang, the " whip " of the Coach-
whip Bird, the " laugh " of the Kookaburra, the rich notes of the
Yellow Kobin and many others, for the Lyrebird is the greatest of all
bird mimics and these songs, added to his own repertoire of wonderful
melody, make this bird's song unique. I looked round for the bird but
he was invisible, so I moved a little towards the sound but in a
second there was a movement, a flash of brown and the songster
had gone. He had been giving his concert on a fallen log some
yards away.
Later on I found the dancing mounds. These are in a clearing and
are heaps of bare earth about 2 feet high and perhaps 5 to 6 feet
across ; these the bird scratches up with his powerful feet and on them
the marvellous tail is displayed. The bird bends forward throwing the
widely spread tail over its head so that from the front only the under-
side of the huge fan-like tail is seen completely hiding the body. The
upper side of the tail is dark brown and no doubt this is very necessary
from a protective point of view, but the underside is a silvery grey.
The wonderful lyre-like outer tail feathers, which are marked with rich
chestnut and have transparent patches on them, are held out sideways
like the outer supports of a fan, while the fine aigrette-like inner feathers
are quivered and give the impression of a lace-like silvery fan. While
the tail is held in this position the bird dances and also indulges in a
torrent of song. I never saw the actual display as it was not the time
for it, but I did see many photos of it and it is far more spectacular
than any display of a Bird of Paradise.

Sydney Porter--Notes from Australia
The extraordinary thing about this bird is that it nests in the mid-
winter, which in the mountain ranges is usually quite severe, sharp
frosts and deep snow are not of unusual occurrence. The birds then
leave the higher ranges and come down to the densely wooded gullies ;
but here it is still very cold, even in mid-summer we used to have
fires in the evenings. The nest is a huge affair, domed, with the entrance
at one side. It is composed of fine roots and dead leaves, and is large
enough inside for a dog the size of a small fox terrier to sleep in. The
nests I saw were empty, as the birds had gone higher up the ranges,
but they use the same nest when not disturbed year after year. Only
one egg is laid and the incubation lasts for six weeks. Although the
male neither helps in building the nest nor in feeding the young he is
usually in the vicinity of the nest. The young are supposed to keep
with the parents for three or four years, after that the eldest is driven
off to fend for itself. Each pair of birds have their own territory, but
they are said to pay visits to neighbouring couples.
The birds were quite plentiful in Big Tree Gully, so called
because of a giant Eucalyptus r eg nans, nearly 300 feet high and over
60 feet in circumference, an ideal spot for the birds, where the dense
forest covered the steeply sloping ground and tree ferns and other
forest undergrowth kept the place in perpetual twilight. The mould
was deep, rich, and damp, which is very necessary for the food supply
of the bird. Tiny streams trickled in all directions, often lost beneath
the thick humus of untold centuries. In such spots only can the Lyre-
bird exist, for it is only here that it can obtain its food, which mainly
consists of a small crustacean which lives just below the surface of the
mould. Almost everywhere one finds evidences of the birds' scratchings,
often they go quite deeply into the humus; also they dig into the rotten
tree trunks ; one also finds numerous feathers about. But in this part
of its range seldom does one ever get but the merest glimpse of this
elusive creature. After perhaps an hour or more of watching, we would
hear one treading its way through the forest, but fifty yards or more away
this wary creature invariably caught sight of us and in a second made
off. Sometimes we managed to get quite close up to a bird which was
singing in a dense clump of undergrowth ; I must have been within
three yards of one bird, but he must have seen me before I saw him,

for his song suddenly stopped and I heard him slip quietly into the
undergrowth.
For a long time I once listened to a male bird exercising his vocal
talents ; he w^as singing his own song but it seemed to remind me of
some other song. I tried for a long time to remember, then it suddenly
dawned on me--it was the soft, sweet, pleasing chortle of another
Australian bird, but from a district which was the very antithesis from
that in which I was in, the Queen Alexandra Parrakeet ; but the song
was much richer and deeper. I have never heard the " song " of this
Parrakeet mentioned because I suppose no one imagines a Parrakeet
has a song, but this one has. I have a male bird which will sit with
his head in a corner and sing for often half an hour at a time, and quite
a pleasant song it is.
To get back to the Lyrebird, the future of this bird is quite bright,
for perhaps no bird in the world is more rigidly protected than this
one. No one (with rare exceptions) outside a skin collector would
dream of killing one, and even a collector would have to have a great
deal of moral courage to do such a thing, for I'm sure that if he were
found out (in Victoria at least) he would be very severely dealt with.
An odd egg collector may upon rare occasions take an egg, which is
really a serious thing as the bird only lays one egg and that not every
year. It is illegal to own a Lyrebird's egg or feathers in Australia.
No Zoos in Australia are allowed to keep these birds, and there is
as much chance of anyone getting permission to export one as there
would be for him to ask the British Government for the loan of the
Crown Jewels, unless the applicant was a foreigner.
There was a sinister rumour that at a certain holiday guest house
in the Sherbrook Forest where these birds are common they were
served up at times under the nom de plume of " Pheasant " ; inquiries
were made and since then " Pheasant " has not appeared again on the
menu. I think if it were proved to be true the proprietor would be
nearly lynched.
In pre-settlement days the birds had few or no enemies, as evinced
by its slow reproductive activities, but now its chief enemy is the
European fox which has spread into the districts where the bird is found.
It is said that owing to this the bird is now building its nest higher up

from the ground ; previously the nest was only 3 or 4 feet from
the ground, and all those I saw were not more than this distance from
the floor of the forest and readily accessible to a fox. Dingoes in the
remote districts also take a few, but these animals are rare now in the
forested areas. The forest fires no doubt take a toll of the young and
sitting birds.
We came upon one tragedy, a large quantity of Lyrebird's feathers,
including some of the beautiful aigrette-like tail feathers, where
obviously the bird had been sprung upon by some carnivorous mammal
and taken away to be eaten, no doubt a fox.
Sitting one day in a hollow forest tree sheltering from a torrential
rain storm, I heard a Lyrebird calling and scratching only a few yards
away, but try as I might I was unable to see him. Eventually I was able
to creep up within a yard or two, but was still unable to see the bird for
the intervening undergrowth ; then there was a sudden alarm note, a
flash of silvery white, and I saw the underside of the tail of a male bird
as he quickly disappeared in the dense vegetation. Many times in the
forest on Mount Monda I saw but a momentary glimpse of a bird, and
I came to the conclusion that it was the shyest and most elusive bird
I'd ever tried to study in its native haunts. However, in the Sherbrook
Forest near Melbourne my acquaintance with this bird, though of short
duration, was much more intimate, for here this apparently elusive
creature was comparatively tame. The undergrowth was not nearly
so impenetrable as at Mount Monda. Soon after I arrived in the forest I
heard the loud melodious calls of the birds and we crept in the direction
of the sounds ; but it was rather difficult to know which sound to follow,
for after being on the track of one for a few minutes this would suddenly
stop and another would start in the opposite direction. Eventually
we saw one in the distance and I crept slowly up to it. It turned out
to be a young male, perhaps two years old, and also a hen bird. I crept
closer and closer hardly daring to breathe, for I knew from previous
experience how very wary these birds were . . . just a flash of brown and
the bird is gone . . . each moment I expected the birds to disappear ;
but no, they still stood their ground though they must have seen us
long before we saw them. At last I was within about twenty yards of
them, the hen moved away but the young male remained. I followed

up and at last got within 20 feet of him. That hour I watched
him I shall never forget. I remember every minute of it. His scratching
was totally unlike that of any other bird. He got great clawsful of
forest debris and flung them aside, sometimes he clutched large boughs
and fallen tree-fern trunks and dragged them away. He used his feet
in the same manner as one would use a hand. My companion told me
that the way these birds tear huge decaying trunks of the fallen forest
trees to pieces with their feet is nothing short of incredible. Quite
large holes are made that one would think were the work of rabbits.
The Lyrebird scratches with one foot at once and it does not scratch
in the accepted sense, but rather rakes over the mould, and any large
obstructions are firmly grasped and flung aside. The main food and
what I actually saw the birds eating, was a small crustacean of a brown
colour which greatly resembled a sand-hopper and which lives in
countless thousands just below the top of the loose forest soil. I also
noticed this particular bird eating an odd worm at times. The sight
of sights was when five birds came into view at once and indulged in
a kind of wild ecstatic dance, the kind of thing Pheasants occasionally
do in moments of uncontrolled exuberance. Before the male gets his
adult tail the feathers resemble a bunch of long ribbon-like plumes
curving towards the ground and held in an ill-assorted bunch. The outer
tail feathers which eventually give place to the Lyre-like feathers, are
noticeably patterned underneath. When the bird is digging or scratching
the tail is held at a high angle above the ground. The throat is coloured
like the breast of an English Robin and the eye is large and of a deep
liquid brown. The bird when not singing utters a series of loud calls
which sounds rather like the word " Chop " many times slowly
repeated.
The Lyrebird is about the size of a large Pheasant, but much slimmer
in build and is of a general rich earthy brown. The magnificent tail
of the fully adult male, which superficially resembles a lyre, is too com-
plicated to describe fully and must be seen to be appreciated, there is
certainly nothing else like it in Nature. Stuffed birds in museums give
a very erroneous idea of what the living bird is like.
It is generally agreed that the Lyrebird is not related to another
type of bird and that it stands out on its own with habits quite unique
from any other feathered form.

There is a little book published in Australia, called The Lore of
the Lyrebird , and although it is written in a style of highly coloured
and sentimental journalism it gives quite a fair idea of the habits of
the Lyrebird, contains some excellent photographs, and is well worth
reading. It is the story of how one of these elusive birds made friends
with a woman who lived in a lonely cottage by a forest, and how it
used to come every day to display and sing for her on her veranda.

THE PERCHING BIRDS OF CANADA

The Order of Passeriformes or Perching Birds is to-day the largest
and quite the most important division of modem birds and heads
the classification by Systematists.
Of course, the perching birds have many characteristics in common
with birds that are not perchers but they have also a great number of
characteristics unshared by other orders.
One of the most remarkable is their capacity for song. The larynx
is highly developed as a singing organ with complicated muscular
control.
The feet are particularly well adapted for perching. They are not
webbed. The hind toe is nearly as long as the middle one. The bill
is not soft at the base but hard and horny and the nostril tubes are
free from communication with each other.
It is desirable to state that the Order Passeriformes has the sub-
division into the songless perchers (Tyranni) and the song-birds
(Passeres). Here we shall interest ourselves with a few of the songsters.
Both sub-orders are well-represented in Canada.
One of the best beloved birds of the plains of Canada is the Western
Meadow Lark. Its brown and yellow, jet black and white are easy
marks of distinction. West of the Great Lakes in Canada this little
bird, about the size of a large Robin, is not to be mistaken for any
other species, not even for the Eastern Meadow Lark, but this latter
bird is seldom to be found west of the Great Lakes. Its throat, which
is lemon-coloured, shows oft the black necklace to great advantage.

Mr. A. P. Taverner, writing in his inimitable manner of this bird,
says regarding its voice : " One of its most characteristic calls has been
well syllabized by a Western ornithologist as King-chigle-a-bunk *
in contrast with the Eastern Meadow Lark which says ' Toodle-de-
you It is an extremely valuable bird to the farmer. The crop
analysis shows that its food consists of 75 per cent insects, 12 per cent
weed-seeds, and 13 per cent grain. The grain is taken at the season of
the year when insects are very scarce.
The little creature is not only beautiful and economically useful
but it is famous, and deservedly, for its lovely voice which rings " rich
and full and true " over the open fields and prairies. It is impossible
to describe the voice. One distinctive effect may be mentioned, its
ventriloquistic quality. The song sounds loud and close to the ear ;
one looks up at a nearby fence, but no bird is to be seen. The trilling
continues, and the volume of sound increases, but the songster is a
hundred yards or more away ! Perhaps this beautiful voice is the most
welcome as the herald of spring, which comes when the trade-winds
have melted the dreary waste of snow encircling the ranch, and the
Western plainsman hears the notes that announce so unmistakably
the coming of spring.
We pass on with the song of the Western Meadow Lark yet ringing
out, to a brief consideration of the Yellow-headed and Bed-winged
Blackbirds. The Yellow-headed is the larger of the two. The two birds,
however, have much in common.
Not by any means a quiet spot is the nesting place of a colony.
Noise and constant coming and going, excursions and incursions
and other alarms, croaking, gurgling of rough harsh voices, with
intermittent outbreak of strenuous and raucous objections, the flashing
and fluttering of brilliant colours and of black wings, both species taking
a part in the activities, distinguish the nesting marshes of the colonies.
Here is a spirited account of a Blackbird roost just before sunset
given by Mr. A. P. Taverner. " The birds come in from every direction
talking and croaking loudly, in vast black clouds, looking on the
horizon like wisps of smoke blowing before the wind. They pitch
into a bed of reeds already occupied by earlier arrivals, until each

stalk seems strung with big black beads. At the onslaught of the
incoming contingent birds are dislodged right and left, there is a babel
of protesting voices and a fluttering of many wings that whirr loudly
in the still air as the surface of the green marsh boils with black forms
seeking new resting-places. The confusion gradually subsides until
the next arriving flock starts the hubbub over again. Thus it goes on
as the sun sinks, until all are in and then the evening wind chases waves
over the soft green surface of the reed-beds without revealing a hint
of the hordes of black bodies beneath, that are resting through the
stillness of the night."
The Yellow-headed and the Eed-headed Blackbirds are both
ground-feeders. The greater portion of their food consists of insects
harmful to vegetation and weed-seeds. The rest is waste grain. Farmers
have much for which to thank these birds.
By no stretch of imagination can their song be said to be melodious.
It has been described in such harsh utterances as 44 Kluck-Kluck-
Klee-Klee-Klo-Klee-Klu-Klel-Kriz Krizz zzzzzzzzzzz eeee "
on the part of the Yellow-headed bird, and 4 4 O-Ke-Leee O-Ke-reeee "
on that of the Red-headed bird. These notes are characteristic as a
song of the marshes.
We now spend a few minutes with the family Paridse--Titmice--
the bright happy little Chickadees. Three subspecies are recognized in
Canada. The Eastern Chickadee, the Long-tailed Chickadee, and the
Oregon Chickadee. No matter what the weather, be it blustery or
wet or raw, this cheerful little bird keeps up a 44 Chickadeeing ".
It is chronicled that ornithologists know nothing of a 44 discouraged
Chickadee When winter renders birds scarce, and human hopes
seem sogging and fears in the ascendant, still one may hear the cheery
call 44 Chica-Chica-dee-de " as one little feathered hope constitutes
himself the leader of a party of other congenial spirits and, like 44 Pippa "
of the famous poem, brings a better spirit and outlook as he passes
with his cheerful notes. Warblers of other species gather to the rallying
notes, contributing their parts to the fascinating, spontaneous, choral
service. As winter withdraws the approach of spring is heralded by the
Chickadees with a new song, two whistled notes, high and clear, the

first prolonged, the second two tones lower, which translated are
i Spring's here
The Chickadee works hard for its little living all the year round.
With its small companions, the Nuthatch and the Creeper, they achieve
much. Being of an inquisitive turn of mind the Chickadee and its
friends examine minutely the crevices of trees where insects hide and
hibernate, and in company with the allied species (the Nuthatch and
Creeper) the total of insect eggs taken must be very considerable.
The intense cold sharpens the birds' appetites and as their food is
very tiny everything points to their incalculable use to the farmer
and agriculturist. An examination of the Chickadee's food shows
68 per cent insect, and 32 per cent vegetable. An analysis reveals
insect eggs, larvse, chrysalids, and small insects, small weed-seeds,
and wild fruit.
The bright-spirited and lively Chickadee is easily persuaded to
frequent the home grounds in winter and soon yields to coaxing to
alight on the finger and feed from the hand. Its gentle, inquisitive
nature assists its approach.
Chickadees nest in old stumps, holes of trees, and other well-
protected places. They line them with grasses, feathers, plant-down,
moss, felted-fur, and other soft materials.

Whatever avicultural achievements may be attributed to Patricia R.
Cholmeley, the fancier mentioned must have experienced a most
enviable thrill with regard to the breeding and almost successful
rearing of the Black-crested Finch. A year ago this unique and amiable
bird was unknown to many of us. The breeding pair mentioned in the
article published in the October issue went to nest in an aviary con-
taining a mixed collection of little birds. I wonder if many fanciers,
like myself, will wonder what species the mixed collection included.
" To what extent can the species be mixed ? " There is a question
that has not been sufficiently emphasized. The question is the theme of
this article. Many aviculturalists begin as sentimentalists, thinking

birds are angels, and wish to create a heaven for them in the form of
an aviary. After a series of shocks such fanciers either give up or
become serious-minded and useful students.
I contend that no man or woman should be allowed to have a
voice in the making of laws relating to bird protection or bird preserva-
tion until that person has made a study of their peculiarities, both in
freedom and captivity. No useful purpose can be served in that
particular direction by keeping isolated birds or isolated breeding
pairs. An aviary can be a heaven for birds, or it can also be the worst
possible hell. Progress in the form of the builder has restricted the
breeding area for birds, and the congestion must make life more simple
for the natural enemies of birds. The weasel shall not live by mice
alone, also the squirrel does not eat only nuts. The Great Tit will eat
the brains out of the Yellow Bunting, the Bullfinch, and others. The
Tit will attack such birds before they are self-supporting ; the Blue Tit
is also an offender, this sweet creature will raid a nest of small birds
when they are ten days old. Not one chick is ever spared once a Tit
has dated a nest. The Owl makes a raid just before dark, four journeys
in eight or ten minutes and four fresh-killed young, feathered, Black-
birds are in the larder. Every Cuckoo reared means that four or
five peaceful birds have been sacrificed. Consider the deleterious
habits of the Jay, Jackdaw, Shrike, and Hawk. Then we may appreciate
the importance of the question : " To what extent can the species be
safely mixed ? " Also we can admit an aviary can be a bird's heaven
if we take our hobby seriously. If we consider to what extent the general
public can compromise in their attitude towards bird protection,
then we are likely to find it difficult to dissociate sentimentality
from humbug. To any reader who may consider these remarks exagger-
ated or too trivial for publication I would like to state that any
remarks are the direct result of my own observations, and can hardly
be trivial since I have from time to time received letters from fellow-
fanciers asking questions relating to all the subjects and species
mentioned. Now to revert to the question regarding a mixed collection.
So many species may seem safe with each other until the birds come
into breeding condition. The fact that an aviary is not intended as a
breeding aviary is of no help. Each healthy bird must come into

condition at some time or other--the birds then act or react as
instinct dictates. And here are some of the writer's impressions.
All the Whydahs are egg-eaters, the Pintailed Whydah is a killer,
likely to scalp any other inmate from a Waxbill to a Java Sparrow.
The Gouldian Finch is peaceful and tolerant to all smaller birds, but
only one pair can be kept in an aviary in the breeding season. A breeding
pair of Gouldians may object to the company of a Goldfinch in the
breeding season, the Goldfinch being the only possible exception
I know of. The Avadavat will agree with anything in, or out of the
breeding season, but an unmated bird may cause trouble in the breeding
season. The Orange Cheek and the Grey Waxbill will agree in flocks
at all times, though unlikely to make a sincere attempt to rear young.
Golden-breasted Waxbills will agree in quantities and go to nest
without undue quarrelling. The Cordon Bleu will enjoy the company
of others of the same kind, but when in breeding condition they
object to another pair in the same aviary ; strangely enough they do
not object to a crowd of others. They are never aggressive to birds less
colourful than themselves in the breeding season, but likely to be
at war with such birds as Gouldians and Goldfinches. This war will
last until the breeding urge leaves the birds. Not more than one pair of
Lavender Finches can be kept together at any time, and only a true
pair can ever be kept, they are then not always to be trusted
with other birds. The Tits are not safe with anything at any time.
The Zebra Finch will upset the nesting arrangements of any
breeding pair from a Waxbill to a Canary. If the aviary is large
enough, and not too much traffic, then the following may successfully
rear young, even though two or more pairs are in the same aviary :
Twites, Greenfinches, Goldfinches, and Linnets. The writer can never
at any time trust two adult Bullfinch cocks together. Chaffinches
are amiable to each other and all other species, except when in breeding
condition, and at such times they only object to their own kind.
The Thrush family will tolerate smaller birds only until they have
young of their own, then they are likely to kill Finch-like birds and
also eat Finch chicks. The Skylark is likely to be most spiteful to
other birds when in breeding trim. Diamond Finches and Grass Finches
may be trusted with other breeding pairs if the aviary is of fair size,

but only one pair of each species ; the same remarks apply to the Fire-
finch, Cuba Finch, and the Singing Finch--both green and grey.
The Saffron Finch is likely to become aggressive to other breeding
pairs when he is himself in breeding condition. The Song Sparrow
is likely to scalp any other bird in or out of the breeding season.
Most of the foreign birds mentioned above will, if acquired in good
condition early in July, become acclimatized and live for many years
in an out-door aviary, and enjoy good health without artificial heat.
Wagtails are at all times aggressive and often murderous. Siskins and
Kedpolls are at all times amiable, the latter mentioned far too amiable
for comfort. Most small birds that will breed in captivity are more
prolific than are the same species in the wild state, and such birds will
come into full colour earlier than the average wild-bred birds. The only
exceptions are the Greenfinch and the Chaffinch. The Buntings are
not popular captive breeders. A pair of Goldfinches will produce up to
seventeen healthy youngsters in one season, against nine in the wild
state. I have never known a pair of Linnets rear more than three
youngsters per round in the wild state, and never less than four
youngsters per nest in captivity.

By Frances E. Matthews
Owing to adverse weather conditions, it was late this year before
my birds were installed in our small garden aviaries. Though they
took some time to decide about breeding, hope ran high when good
starts were made by most of them. Now at the end of the season
" So near, and yet so far " describes many of the results to date.
A pair of Shamas seemed very pleased with their abode, the hen
choosing a nestbox under cover, where she brooded five eggs in an
exemplary manner. Sad to relate, these were infertile. In her second
nest two eggs were fertile, but from some cause these were chilled just
when due to hatch. In the third nest I saw one bird of some days old,
and I believe another egg was fertile. Then to my dismay these were
thrown out, and the hen gave up sitting. All through the hen fed well
on insectivorous food. She flew to me every night and morning as

soon as I appeared and took her mealworms on the wing, returning
to her nest shortly afterwards. This third nest was outdoors at the
end of the flight. The cock (though the pair agreed well) held aloof
from his domestic duty--to feed the young ones. I never saw him
enter the nest. I wonder whether he, or the hen, were to blame for
the failures ? I fancy somehow he was. The hen was entirely satisfactory
until the end. Have any of my readers had a similar experience ? In
this district, owing to the low flying of 'planes overhead birds are liable
to be disturbed if not steady sitters.
In a small adjacent flight a steady pair of Dufresnes prepared a
marvellous nest inside a covered box. The hen sat well, the cock
sharing duty. These little birds had evidently great hopes, but no
young birds appeared ; it was a long time before they gave up. Their
second effort yielded no results. Their nest was composed, I should
think, of everything they could find. The cock never wearied of adding
to it, until the box became quite an Early Victorian abode, feathers,
coloured wools, sacking fibre, forming an enveloping cloud to the tiny
eggs almost concealed. The cock was on the watch ; if I put another
strand of wool in a wee basket on the door of the flight, before my back
was turned it had been added to the clutter surrounding his wee mate.
These birds certainly deserved a family !
A pair of Violet Ears, put out during the warmer spell, quickly
started nesting. During last autumn and winter they nested indoors
several times. The hen has been a very prolific layer, always starting
well, the cock also brooding the eggs. From some cause they failed at
the end to bring it off, though the eggs in several instances were
fertile. My efforts to employ Bengalese as foster parents fell through.
I feel they will do better themselves sometime as they are such steady
birds. When this last damp weather started, reluctantly, I brought them
indoors. The change in no wise upset the hen ; she started feeding
at once, and then laid an egg in her usual rush nest fixed in their cage.
I find that most birds prefer these closely plaited rush nests, resting in
the fork of a branch and fixed high up in their dwelling, to ordinary
boxes. I make a good number of them. Most breeders, I think, love
Violet Ears, and with reason. My two are very tame, especially at this
season. You can go close up and converse with them ; they chirp back
in reply. All new kinds of food are sampled at once. A millet spray

stem, dipped in honey and fixed somewhere, is a joy to them. If you
ask the cock to sing he tries to start, and is especially good when the
sun comes oufc. His song is like that of the Reed Bunting ; some notes
are comparable to those of the Lark when receding from sight. The
hen can sing a bit, too, on occasion.
Having acquired a cock Pintail Nonpareil without a mate, I placed
with him a good Blue-faced Parrot Pinch. She has laid a good many
eggs, some in a nestbox, but does not suggest brooding them--probably
she deems it might be waste of time ! Both birds are fit, and they are
also excellent feeders.
A pair of Ruficaudas promised well, the hen choosing a nest,
though apparently she never produced any eggs. She was found dead
after some weeks when the nest was examined.
A pair of Emblema Picta have been outdoors all the summer.
They have just come out of a moult; possibly owing to this no progress
has been made in house hunting.
A steady pair of Longtail Grassfinches have nested several times,
hatching every egg. They are feeding a family of five at the moment
still in their nestbox.
My Gouldians were late in going to nest--even the well-seasoned
pairs. Two pairs imported this year have now got over the inevitable
moult. They are in fine health and starting nests. A seasoned pair are
jealously nursing a good many eggs in one of the cone-shaped rush
nests. The results are yet unknown.
I attribute success with these birds to careful feeding of the right
kind, and plenty of seeding grass.
I have followed the advice in all respects given in Practical Hints
on the Keeping and Breeding of Gouldian Finches, by P. W. Teague.
I believe it is due to this that the colour of the seasoned birds is so
vivid, more so than that of the new arrivals. These red heads are truly
red, whereas the red head cock of the former might be called a " Crimson
head " ; this colour is so much richer, and the other colours purer.
I should like to hear if others have found this to be so ? In an outdoor
aviary, not well placed, Bengalese have flourished. By them the
soaked seed is greatly appreciated ; it has produced strong young
birds. This is noticeable with some pure whites, who fledged rapidly
and are good on the wing.

A History of Sussex Birds. By John Walpole-Bond. 3 vols.
H. F. and G. Witherby, Ltd., 326 High Holborn, W.C. 1. Price
#5 5 s. net.
This imposing work deals very fully and carefully with all recorded
bird residents and visitors to Sussex, amounting to nearly 450 species
and subspecies ; some breeding regularly, others that used to do so ;
occasional breeders and passage migrants, accidental visitors, and
probable escapes from captivity. The evidence, written and hearsay,
is carefully sifted for and against, and copious footnotes added. The
author began to amass material for the work thirty years ago but as he
says in his Introduction, no one man can pretend even with all the help
obtainable to cope with the whole of a county completely, and for this
reason no county book can be done really satisfactorily by one man,
though most readers will agree that Mr. Walpole-Bond has come as
near to the ideal as any one could hope. He writes very interestingly, no
dry-as-dust chronicle, gives his reasons for or against the records
quoted, and adds distribution through the county, nesting notes with
number and colouring of the eggs and the kind of place where the nests
are likely to be found.
The result is eminently readable and packed with information
which will appeal to the general reader as much as to the ornithologist.
The fifty-three coloured plates by Philip Bickman add much to the
charm of the book.
Natives of Sussex may well be proud of their long list of records
and it is hoped that further notices of occurrences with data will be
sent to Mr. Walpole-Bond for inclusion in the next edition of his fine
book.

technical discussion. Among other interesting information he explains
how habitat affects flight, as instanced in the rise of the Pheasant which
is almost vertical, " a necessary quality in a bird which lives in woods
where the only way of escape may lie through a small opening in the
vegetation immediately overhead ", while the Partridge, living in
open fields, escapes usually by horizontal flight. As a general rule,
he points out, long pointed wings are typical of birds of open country
and short rounded ones of dwellers in woods and hedgerows.
Many people have marvelled at the flight of birds, but the successful
study and clearing up of its difficulties demands a technical knowledge
both of zoology and aerodynamics, combined with opportunities for
watching birds in open country. The latter are now supplemented by
the beautiful film pictures showing the flight of different birds in slow
motion and at normal pace. High speed cameras and telephotolenses
also show permanent and detailed records of flight under varying
emotions, such as fear, when pursued by an enemy, hunting, search
for food as exemplified in the hovering of a Kestrel engaged in quartering
a field for its prey, and especially love flights which range from simple
flutterings to the elaborate tossing, somersaulting, and swooping of the
Lapwing. There is also flock flight in formation, where each bird has its
recognized place, as for example the Y-shaped ordered flight of wild
Geese.
The book is freely illustrated with plates and figures depicting types
of flight, the positions of the wings when a bird is rising or alighting,
the structure of feathers, and their insertion into the wing. There is
also a useful glossary of technical terms and a good index.

In Dr. Derscheid's article in the October issue, on page 277, line 1,
replace the words " in the United Kingdom " by the words " in the
British Empire It seems that Mr. W. C. Osman Hill's success in
breeding the said species was achieved in Colombo, Ceylon, although
no definite mention is made of the locality in the course of its account

This exceedingly beautiful Long-tailed Pheasant was introduced
to Europe by Mr. Walter Goodfellow in 1912. He captured living
specimens on Mount Arizan in Central Formosa and successfully brought
them back to Europe. The first to reach England were housed in
Mrs. Johnstone's aviaries, where they bred freely. Though the bird
had not previously been seen, it was known to exist, because a collector
in Formosa twenty years previously had observed two of its tail-
feathers in the headdress of a savage.
The Mikado is essentially a mountain species. Mr. Goodfellow
collected it on Mount Arizan " at any altitude above 6,000 feet, never
lower They feed chiefly on the leaves of a common plant also only
found at these altitudes, and are very difficult to get on to grain,
but once this is accomplished they live well and give little trouble.
The egg is pale creamy white, smooth and glossy, the period of incuba-
tion twenty-eight days.

nine Orinoco Geese, any number of Black-shouldered Peafowl, two
splendid Stanley Cranes. The Chukor Partridges have done splendidly
this year, and in my gardens near the house I have counted over

The most interesting birds to nest were my pair of Guildings
Amazon Parrots, which laid three eggs, but they were all infertile.
As these are only young birds it is hoped that next year they
will produce young. No birds this year suffered from egg-binding.

Part I: The Parrot Order
The Adelaide Zoo has long been noted for its collection of the birds
of this order, particularly the Australian representatives, of which
fifty out of the fifty-nine known species were exhibited during the past
year. We shall deal with the families in the usually accepted order.
(a) The Nestoridje
The only representative of this small but interesting family is the
Kea (Nestor notahilis). Two males have been in the Zoo for a good
many years, and two females were recently acquired.

<bodyText confidence="0.993452333333333" page_id="56319143"  page_num="335" year="" vol="">
The only Lory exhibited during the year was an example of the
common Black-capped (Domicilla lory). Of the Lorikeets there is a
solitary Forsten's (Trichoglossus forsteni) and two Blue-faced
(T. hsematodus), one of which has laid. The common Blue Mountain
or Swainson's (T. moluccanus) is always represented in the collection
by a few examples, and has bred in the Gardens. The rarer Red-
collared ( T. ruhritorques) is at present represented by four pairs in
beautiful condition. The Scaly-breasted Lorikeet (Eutelipsitta chloro-
lepidota), formerly a common bird in captivity, is now represented by
a single example, while a small flock of the attractive little Varied
Lorikeet (Psitteuteles versicolor) has dwindled also to a single specimen.
The Musk Lorikeet (Glossopsitta concinna) is hardy and represented

by several pairs at present, but the little Purple-crowned (G. porphyro-
cephala), though common in the streets and parks of Adelaide and at
times in the trees in the Zoo itself, was only represented during the
year by a single bird, and is always difficult to keep in good health.
The Little Lorikeet (G. pusilla) is the only Australian species
missing and it has never been exhibited.
(c) The Cacatuim
The black species are well represented though generally rarities
in collections. The Great Black Cockatoo (Probosciger aterrimus) is
well represented with six specimens in fine condition, and they are
almost certainly of the island form and not the Australian sub-species.
The Banksian Cockatoo (Calyptorhynchus banksi) is represented by a
pair, of which the male is one of the oldest aviary inhabitants of the
Zoo. The female is of one of the small races and has laid eggs on several
occasions. The Glossy Black Cockatoo (C. lathami) is also represented,
a pair having recently been acquired. It is probable that this species
has never been exhibited in captivity before.
The Yellow-tailed Black Cockatoo ( C . funereus ) is rare in captivity.
A pair have been exhibited for some considerable time, and a third
has recently been acquired. The White-tailed Black Cockatoo
(C. daudini) is not represented, but one fine example was a temporary
inhabitant this year on its way from Perth to the United States.
The Gang-gang Cockatoo (Callocephalon fimbriatus) is represented by
an adult pair and two immature males, all in excellent condition and
so far not given to their favourite vice of feather-plucking.
The commoner Australian Cockatoos, namely the Sulphur-crested
[Kakatoe galerita), Leadbeater's ( K . leadbeateri), Bare-eyed (K.
symnopis), and Roseate (K. roseicapillus) are all housed together
in a large aviary together with a single example of the Long-billed
(K. tenuirostris), and the Western Long-billed ( K . t. pastinator), the
latter being more like the Bare-eyed, only somewhat larger and with
a longer bill. The only non-Australian Cockatoo exhibited at present
is the Great White Cockatoo ( K . alba), of which there are five examples.
The Cockatiel [Leptolophus hollandicus) is represented by a small
flock which breed freely.

(d) The Psittacim
Six species of Macaws are exhibited. They are as follows : Two
perfect examples of the Hyacinthine Macaw (Anodorhynchus hyacin-
thinus ) ; two fine Blue and Yellow Macaws (Ara ararauna), one only
recently acquired, the other a very old inhabitant ; six or seven of
the commonest species ; the Bed and Blue ( A . macao ) ; a single Bed
and Green (A. chloroptera), the survivor of a pair which made several
unsuccessful attempts at breeding; three Military Macaws (A. militaris);
and a pair of the little Illiger's (A. maracana) which have laid frequently
but the eggs have invariably been infertile. The Conures are represented
by the Green ( Aratinga leucophthalma), of which a pair have been in
the Gardens for a good many years and last year succeeded in rearing
a single young one, believed to be the first recorded breeding, several
each of the Aztec and Mexican Conures ( Conurus aztec and holochlorus)
recently received, and a single Cactus ( C . cactorum).
Of the Amazons, there are a number of Levaillants (A. levaillanti),
one or two of both the Blue-fronted Yellow-naped (A. aestiva and
auropalliata), and a recently acquired pair identified as the Yellow-
cheeked Amazon ( A . autumnalis), one of which exhibits marked lutinistic
tendencies. African species exhibited are a pair of Grey Parrots
(Psitiacus erithacus), a single Senegal Parrot (Poicephalus senegalus ),
and seven species of Lovebird, viz. the Nyassa ( Agapornis lilianae),
Black-cheeked (A. nigrigenis), Fischer's (A. fischeri ), Masked
(A. personata ), Peach-faced (A. roseicollis), Madagascar (A. cana),
and Bed-faced (A. pullaria). The first five mentioned all breed
freely. The Asiatic Parrakeets shown are three in number, namely
the Alexandrine ( Psittacula nipalensis ), and Bing-necked (P. torquata)
and Javan (P. alexandri ), all of which breed freely ; that of the
last named is thought to be the first recorded breeding in captivity.
Coming now to the Australian species, the first group comprises the
three beautiful birds belonging to the genus Polytelis. Of the first
of these, Barraband's Parrakeet (P. barrabandi), about a dozen
examples are shown, but so far they have not reproduced. The
second, the Bock Peplar Parrakeet (P. anthopeplus) is a fairly
common bird in South Australia and several specimens are exhibited.
Of the third, Queen Alexandra's Parrakeet (P. alexandrse), there

are at present about twenty examples in the Gardens, no less than
sixteen having been reared from three breeding pairs last season, and
thirteen from two pairs in the previous season.
About five pairs of the King Parrakeet (Aprosmictus scapularis)
are on exhibition. One pair nested last season but failed to rear their
young.
Two fine pairs of the Crimson-winged Parrakeet [Aprosmictus
erythropterus) are always much admired. One pair which have been in
the Zoo for many years reared a single young one last year, the first
occasion on which they have nested, the second pair, recently acquired,
nested in captivity a few seasons ago. One pair of the Red-sided
Eclectus [Lorius pectoralis) show indications of going to nest at the
present time, they are probably the New Guinea race. The other
New Guinea bird wffiich has been discovered in Northern Australia
fairly recently, the Red-cheeked Parrot [Geoffroyus geoffroyi), has never
been exhibited. A single Shining Parrakeet [Pyrrhulopsis splendens)
was exhibited during the year. It was a very old bird and did not
survive very long.
Turning now to the Broad-tailed Parrakeets, several examples of
all the eight species of Rosella are exhibited, namely the Crimson or
Pennants [Platycercus elegans), the Adelaide [P. adelaidse), the Yellow
or Yellow-rumped [P. flaveolus), the Green or Yellow-bellied [P. cale-
donicus), the Pale-headed or Mealy [P. adseitus), the Northern or
Brown's [P. venustus), the Eastern (P. eximius), and the Western or
Stanley (P. icterotis). Most of these birds are common and no particular
effort has been made to breed from them with the exception of Brown's,
of which there are two pairs. The eggs from one of these have always
been infertile, while the second pair, recently acquired, hatched but
failed to rear their young. All the Rosellas are hardy birds with the
exception of the Mealy which is difficult to acclimatize in the southern
states. There are about a dozen specimens of the rare Pileated or
Red-capped Parrakeet [Porpureicephalus spurius), a near ally of the
Rosellas, in excellent condition and one pair at the present time show
every indication of going to nest.
The Australian Ring-necked Parrakeets [Barnardius) are with
one exception common birds and at present one pair of the Mallee or

Barnard's ( B . harnardi), the Port Lincoln or Bauer's (B. zonarius),
and the Yellow-naped or Twenty-eight (B. semitorquatus) are shown.
The exception is the Cloncurry ( B . macgillivrayi) which has never
been exhibited but which it is hoped will be obtained shortly. Of the
lesser broadtails, the Blue Bonnet (Psephotus hsematogaster ) is always
represented by a few specimens of the common yellow-vented variety,
and there is an attractive pair of the rare Little Blue Bonnet or Naretha
Parrakeet (P. narethae) which has only been known in captivity for
the past two years and has probably not been seen alive in Europe.
The common Many-coloured and Red-rumped Parrakeets (P. varius
and haematonotus) are always on exhibition, the former occasionally
breeding when given suitable accommodation in which to do so. The
Hooded Parrakeet (P. dissimilis) is represented by a pair in fine con-
dition and has been bred frequently in recent years, but its near allies,
the Golden-shouldered (P. chrysopterygius) and the supposedly nearly
extinct Paradise (P. pulcherimmus), are not and probably never have
been exhibited.
Coming now to the attractive little Grass Parrakeets we find all
seven known species exhibited, probably for the only time in any
collection, private or public, in the world. The Bourke Grass Parrakeet
(Neophema bourki) breeds very freely and there are usually at least
a dozen specimens on view. The Blue-winged ( N . chrysostoma) at
present represented by a small flock of about twenty, has been bred on
several occasions, and like all members of the genus, is always in
demand for purposes of exchange. The Elegant (N. elegans), probably
the commonest species in this State, also breeds regularly and there are
well over a dozen specimens exhibited at present. The Rock (N. petro-
phila) has never been bred in the Gardens, although eggs were laid
last year. It is the least brilliantly attired of this interesting group,
and is at present represented by some half-dozen birds. The Orange-
bellied ( N . chrysogastra ) is easily the rarest member of the genus.
An adult male was obtained from Tasmania last year, but unfortunately
did not survive long and just recently three more immature birds have
been obtained. The Turquoisine (N. pulchella) is the only member of
the genus which does not occur in South Australia and is represented
at present by a single pair. Strangely enough, this usually prolific

species has not very often been bred in the Gardens. The very beautiful
Scarlet-chested (N. splendida) has been a very prolific breeder in recent
seasons and four or five breeding pairs are on exhibition as well as a
good many of their progeny.
The Pacific Island Parrakeets on view are two male Norfolk Island
(Cyanorhampus cooki). For a short time a pair of Yellow-fronted New
Zealands (C. auriceps ) were on view, but unfortunately they did not
survive long. A pair of the very unusual looking and rare Uvean
Parrakeets (Nymphicus uvaensis) have just lately been acquired.
The Swift Parrakeet (Lathamus discolor ), that queer brush-tongued,
honey feeding bird which is, nevertheless, said not to be a Lorikeet,
is only represented by a single specimen. The ubiquitous Budgerigar
(Melopsittacus undulatus) is, of course, represented, as also are several
of the common colour varieties.
Last, but not least, is the rarest Parrot in the collection, a single
example of the Ground Parrakeet (Pezoporus wallicus) obtained nearly
a year ago by exchange. It is in excellent condition and quite tame ;
though often stated not to have the power of either perching or
climbing, this bird has frequently been seen to climb several feet from
the ground and perch in a small bush growing in its enclosure. It is
much to be hoped that a mate can be procured for it. Its nearest
ally, the Night Parrakeet (Geopsittacus occidentalism is considered by
many to be extinct.
E. and F.--The Opopsittidse (Fig Parrots) and Stringopidae (Owl
Parrots) are not represented in the collection.

Unless visited by some quite abnormal catastrophe, the owner of
a large collection of Parrakeets, if he manages his stock properly, should
never experience a really bad season ; on the other hand X, the evil
spirit who specializes in blasting the hopes of aviculturalists, will take
good care to make sure that he never has as good a one as he hopes
for ! On the whole, however, in spite of X being in his usual form,

the breeding season of 1938 has been above, rather than below, the
average.
The earliest young birds to be reared were a couple of Tahiti Blue
Lories, which left the nest about the middle of March, their parents
having reared another youngster which had been fledged about mid-
winter. In spite of my efforts to prevent them, the old birds unwisely
insisted in laying a third clutch, which, however, proved infertile.
Solitary Lories also nested early in the year, their grandfather-
clock nesting being, of course, in the heated shelter. They hatched a
young one about 14th March, but killed it almost immediately, going
to nest again a few days later. Another young one was observed to
be in the nest about 20th April, and for a considerable time all went
well, until X, irritated by the prospect of success with this rare species,
invented a horrible parasitic mite of the genus Hypoaspis, of a species
new to Science, which attacked the poor little Lory when it was just
feathering nicely and so weakened its constitution that it succumbed
on the 16th of May.
The very rare Goupil's Lories made three attempts at breeding during
the year, all of which unfortunately proved unsuccessful. The hen
is readier to go to nest than any Parrot-like bird I have ever owned.
One has only got to put the box into the aviary shelter at any time of
year, and she rushes into it and attempts to lay within a few days.
Unfortunately her success is not equal to her zeal, possibly owing to
the fact that her constitution was seriously undermined before I
discovered the correct food for the species.
She produced one egg in May, which she and her mate incubated
assiduously, but although fertile, unfortunately it did not hatch. The
greater part of the incubation was performed by the hen, the cock
sitting occasionally but not as long or as much as the cock C. peruvianus.
Later in the summer she made another attempt, but became egg-bound
and had to be removed to the hospital. The egg was, however, laid
successfully and she took to it when returned to the aviary. It was
again fertile, but was unfortunately slightly damaged during incuba-
tion, with the result that the embryo was destroyed. In early autumn
she made a third attempt, but this time produced a misshapen soft-
shelled egg, which made her ill for a time. I therefore determined to

<bodyText confidence="0.994348305555556" page_id="56319150"  page_num="342" year="" vol="">
stop her from making any more attempts at breeding before 1939, but
in order to do so was obliged to separate ber from ber mate, as otherwise
she would undoubtedly have tried to lay again, even though deprived
both of nest-box and roosting-box.
Hen Blue Lories are rather liable to suffer from egg-laying troubles,
and require a high temperature in their aviary shelter when laying,
combined with ample facilities for exercise in the fresh air, and a course
of lime-water in their food for some time before the nests are put in.
The Palm Cockatoos came into breeding condition in March, and
for a time raised my hopes greatly. Both cock and hen went into a
natural hollow tree-trunk in the aviary flight, paired, and appeared
to be on the point of laying. When all seemed to be going well, however,
I went out one morning to discover that they had had a violent disagree-
ment and the cock was attacking the hen angrily, and refusing to
allow her on the perches at all. After a time they became reconciled,
but there was a further disagreement of the same kind a few days later.
This was followed by another reconciliation, after which they appeared
to take to a log in the aviary shelter and to be sitting, as they took turns
in being inside. When, however, we examined the log after some
weeks had passed, we discovered nothing in it at all, and the cock's
curious behaviour was then explained. His wife had forgotten to lay
any eggs, and he was naturally incensed at the serious omission, and
was only with difficulty persuaded to embark on the thankless task of
incubating the abstract idea of eggs which weren't there ! Always a
strange and quaint bird, the Palm Cockatoo is certainly at its oddest
when love-making, the advances of the two sexes to each other being
most amusing to watch. Out of the breeding season, a pair are not
on particularly affectionate terms, and the hen is apt to be rather
afraid of the cock, and to keep out of his way. When they are thinking
of nesting, however, all this is changed, and she becomes very demon-
strative, tickling his face with the long feathers of her crest in order
to induce him to preen the back of her head. As this hen disappointed
me in a similar way last year, I have decided to get rid of her and have
replaced her by another who, I hope, will be less forgetful in the matter
of eggs !

of the aviary shelter late in the year, and incubated the egg which,
as usual, proved infertile. It is doubtful if she paired with the cock,
who is a comparatively new arrival.
The Leadbeater's Cockatoos, which reared two good young ones in
1936 and two rickety young in 1937, this season murdered their young
ones when they were a few weeks old, a vice, I understand, not un-
common in captive Leadbeaters. Being disgusted with their bad
behaviour, I decided to train them as liberty birds, and so far they
are staying well. The cock had always flown in a slightly lopsided
manner, but it was only when I released him that I realized that he
was partly pinioned. However, though his wings are very decidedly
uneven, he seems able to get about well enough, and the pair look
very lovely in flight. Unfortunately, my appreciation of their appear-
ance was not shared by the other inmates of the aviaries, all of whom,
from the biggest to the smallest, were absolutely terrified of them,
and convinced that they were birds of prey of the most bloodthirsty
description ! That the Asiatic Parrakeets should have been alarmed
was perhaps excusable, but the Australians were every bit as bad, even
though the wild-bred ones must have seen Cockatoos by the hundred
in their native land. This curious weakness in the ornithology of
Australian Parrakeets I observed many years ago when I had a
Banksian Cockatoo at liberty, of whose appearance in the air they
also were extremely terrified.
Roseate Cockatoos did not do well. A grey hen* paired to her
white-bred son, had young which only lived a few days, possibly owing
to the parents being too nearly related. The white pair appeared to
be about to nest in a grandfather-clock box, but at the last moment
the hen took a dislike to it, perhaps because it contained too thin a
layer of rotten wood above the peat, and dropped her eggs from the
perch in the aviary shelter. A white-bred hen which laid last year
did not take any interest in her nest this season, the reason, I think,
being that she had no proper mate. There was a white bird in the
same aviary, but it is a rather curious creature, and I have never been
able to be quite sure of its sex, nor do I believe it knows itself!
Gang-gang Cockatoos, as described in another article, nested
successfully, and reared two young. Unfortunately the young hen,

a few days after leaving the nest, received, during the night, mysterious
and severe injuries, and although she recovered, she will never be
able to fly.
Broad-tailed Parrakeets on the whole did well. My old pair of
Yellow-mantled Parrakeets reared nine young in two broods.
The old hen Mealy duplicated, on a slightly extended scale, her
rather remarkable performance of last year. She laid six eggs on
alternate days, starting to sit almost with the first, and then getting
egg-bound with the seventh. On being returned to the aviary, she
was a very long time settling down, and did not begin to sit until
more than ten days were past. However, she hatched six eggs and
reared six healthy young ones, the seventh egg disappearing.
Her daughter of 1937, mated to an imported cock, also put up a
very fine record for a young bird, rearing nine young in two broods,
all as strong and well grown as could be desired.
Stanley Parrakeets which lost their young in the nest last year
successfully reared four this season, although two succumbed later
to ailments of microbic origin, which always seem to carry off a certain
percentage of one's immature Broadtails, no matter how carefully
they are housed and treated.
Tasmanian Yellow-bellied Parrakeets reared nine in one brood,
the largest number of young Broadtails I have ever had from the
same nest.
Yellow-rumped Parrakeets, which bred successfully in 1935, proved
a failure, as they did last year. The hen was a very long time in taking
to a nest, although the cock used both persuasion and force in trying
to induce her to do so. On one occasion, when she had been messing
about for an inordinate length of time, half in and half out of the nest-
box, he lost all patience, and made one dive at her to inflict a bite on
the rear portion of her person ! Eventually, when the summer was
well advanced, she began to behave as though she had laid, and my
aviary attendant even thought that later he heard young, but when
we came to examine the nest, there was no sign of anything, so that
what happened remains somewhat of a mystery.
The two pairs of Blue-bonnets did nothing, although both hens
entered the nest occasionally, and one pair looked decidedly hopeful,

the cock driving the hen about a lot in the way they do when they mean
real business. It is possible that the nest-boxes were too big, as Blue-
bonnets prefer their breeding accommodation to be very much on
the small side.
The pair of Barnard's Parrakeets, imported last year, never properly
settled down, or took to a nest, and finally dropped into moult. The
remaining pair reared three nice young ones.
Brown's Parrakeets nested rather early in the year, and the hen
hatched one of the three eggs laid, and reared a nice young cock.
She nested again after an interval of several weeks, and hatched another
strong young one, but allowed it to die through giving up brooding it
too soon. She herself was bred on the Continent a few years ago.
Rock Peplar Parrakeets came into breeding condition early in the
year, and although for a long time the hen seemed very discontented
with the natural tree-trunk with which I provided her, she eventually
condescended to make the best of a bad job, and three strong young
ones were reared.
Barrabands proved a disappointment. The hen of one pair, pur-
chased from an English dealer during the winter, had looked a little
bit doubtful about the eyes from the time of her arrival, but it was
only in May wfhen she should have been coming into breeding condition,
that she developed definite eye-disease. She is still alive, but her
case has proved a very intractable one, and has entirely failed to
respond to the perchloride of mercury treatment which is often
successful in curing this troublesome ailment.
The other pair of Barrabands also proved a disappointment, for the
cock, although a breeding bird in former seasons, and apparently
much attached to the hen, persistently refused to pair with her, and
the four eggs were infertile. I tried her with another cock, but she
did not nest again.
Late in the summer I obtained an imported pair of Princess of
Wales' which, as this species not infrequently does, came into breeding
condition almost immediately after arrival. The hen laid a large
number of eggs, both in a nest in the flight and on the floor of the
aviary shelter, but proved completely hopeless as a parent, and
broke nearly all of them. Owfing to the season of the year, no

satisfactory foster-parents were available for the few eggs I managed
to rescue intact. In these days of constant disappointments, with,
presumably, " rogue " stock discarded from Australian aviaries, one
longs for the Princess of Wales' of pre-War days--lovely big birds of a
brilliantly coloured race, now seldom or never imported, the hens
of which, at any rate, had some idea of the correct way of discharging
their family responsibilities !
The hen of my old pair of Crimson-wings, now, I fear, past her
best by reason of advancing years, laid but a single egg from which
a good young bird was reared. Feeling that this solitary effort was
a somewhat meagre one, she laid again, but did not sit the full period.
I have never known Crimson-wings to do any good with the second
nest. There is always disaster, either to the eggs, young, or to the
hen herself, and it is wiser not to allow more than one attempt at
breeding to be made, unless, of course, the first lot of eggs is accidentally
destroyed. It is rather interesting to note that a young bird bred
from this pair in 1937 has assumed practically full adult male plumage
with his first moult.
Another pair of Crimson-wings, the hen of which was bred by
Mr. Ezra, reared two good young ones, and might have done even better
had the hen not laid one egg from the perch in the aviary shelter.
Pennant's repeated their good performance of last year, and reared
six nice young ones, somewhat early in the season for this late-nesting
species.
Adelaide's did not settle down properly or get beyond a casual
examination of their nest-box. Although themselves bred in my collec-
tion, they are the wildest and most intractable birds I possess.
The breeding pair of Australian Kings reared four good young, and
the hen nested again, but did not hatch. The young of the first brood
showed very decided individual differences in their nesting plumage,
and one has traces of a pale green wing-bar, as has his mother who,
for one of her sex, shows, indeed, a remarkably well-developed one.
Many of the Australian Parrakeets seem to be in the middle of interesting
stages of evolutionary development and, as a result, show far more
individual variation than is common in wild birds of the same age,
sex, and species. Pennant's are reaching the final stage in bright-

colour evolution and soon, as one may use the term " soon " when
speaking of the normally age-long process of natural change and
development, will have, at all ages, the brilliant plumage of the adult
male. Crimson-wings are beginning to hasten their slow attainment
of adult coloration, and female and immature male King's are
beginning to progress towards the assumption of the colour and
markings of the adult male.
The hen of another pair of King's laid about a dozen eggs, but was
a long time in starting to sit, and also broke some of them. The
remainder proved addled.
The hen Green-winged King, imported the previous year, took
some interest in her nest, but got no further, mainly, I think, because
the cock, although the only adult male in my collection, was not as
much in breeding condition as he might have been.
Owing to the loss of a breeding cock, and some mistakes in sexing
a species which is less easy to sex than I at one time thought, I started
the season with a considerable excess of hen Swifts--four and only
one cock, a young bird of the previous year. As Swifts are said to be
not averse to bigamy, I tried the experiment of two mates for the
youngster, with considerable success. Although, when his first choice
was going to nest, he made some show of regard for the laws of pro-
priety by a mild bullying of the second hen, as soon as his first wife
was sitting, he quickly responded to the advances of the second, and
two and three young, respectively, were reared from the two nests.
I obtained the loan of a second cock, but only one of the two other
hens nested, and her eggs were clear.
The breeding pair of Malabars hatched and reared three good
young, but after that my luck deserted me, and I lost one of the
young ones and the old hen as well.
The second pair had infertile eggs.
Of two pairs of Lutinistic Plum-heads, one came into breeding
condition, but did not lay owing, I think, to my failure to provide
the hen soon enough with a nest which entirely suited her fancy.
The other hen ignored the proper portion of her hollow tree-trunk,
and scooped out for herself a rather exposed nest quite low down.
In this she reared three young, one strong, one very slightly rickety,

and one more seriously affected with rickets, which could not fly for a
considerable time, although now it flies strongly.
Derbyans, as last year, reared three good young ones.
The breeding pair of Layards also produced three young ones,
two of them good and one, though not rickety in the ordinary way,
at first somewhat defective. It was a very long time leaving the nest,
and when it did so, had difficulty in perching, although it could fly
strongly. Oddly enough, it was its parents 5 favourite, and they rather
neglected their more healthy offspring in its favour. I eventually
gave it to the wife of my aviary attendant, under whose care it throve,
and it has become a great pet and is learning to talk.
The second pair of Layard&apos;s hatched one young one in their first
nest, but lost it almost immediately. They laid again and, in spite
of being in heavy moult, had hatched and nearly reared three young
ones, when I let out the Leadbeater's Cockatoos above alluded to.
On the appearance of these frightful apparitions, they promptly gave
up feeding, and immured themselves permanently in the aviary
shelter, and we were obliged to finish hand-rearing their offspring.
Although in this we were ultimately successful, they proved consider-
ably more troublesome than I anticipated, being strangely nervous and
temperamental, even after fairly prolonged caging and handling.
Splendid Grass Parrakeets, as recorded in another article, did
extremely well, rearing five good young in their first nest, and eight
in their second, and showing considerable disappointment at being
prevented from undertaking yet a third venture !
Turquoisines made an equally promising start, but ended less
happily. Six good young were reared in their first brood, but when
the second brood of five were barely half-grown, the hen suddenly
died. As the cock would not feed them by himself, we had to hand-
rear them, and for a time they did well on a somewhat unnatural
mixture consisting of raw egg and milk, bread, finely chewed shelled
peanuts, crushed soaked hemp, crushed groundsel, and finely chewed-
up wheat, given very warm and presented on the end of a paint-brush.
For a considerable time all five nestlings grew and throve, and the
three eldest were reared and have made fine birds. The two younger
ones, when well feathered and apparently also safe, rather mysteriously

started to go back, and eventually died, from what cause it is rather
difficult to know.
A green hen Ringneck, paired to a young lutino-bred cock, failed
to hatch her first clutch of eggs, but produced two young in a second
clutch, which later she killed, probably owing to being subjected to a
good deal of unavoidable disturbance which birds of the Ringneck
family are very apt to refuse to tolerate.
My best lutino-bred cock, paired to a lutino hen, produced a very
creditable brood of five--three lutinos and two greens.
The lutino mother of the above cock, paired to a young lutino-bred
male, had two lutinos and a green, but her mate, after this happy
result, disgraced himself by suddenly attacking her for no apparent
reason, and very nearly murdering her. Another lutino hen, sister of
the above, paired to a lutino-bred cock, reared two greens, the result
from the three nests thus working out, as regards colour, on an exact
fifty-fifty basis--five lutinos and five greens.

What a thrill it was after only three days in Australia to see my
first wild Gang-gangs as they flew screeching over a forested gully ;
the hen stayed for a time on the topmost branches of a mighty gum
tree. I could tell it was the female for I noticed through my glasses
her grey head.
Afterwards when I stayed at the house in the forest these birds
woke me up each morning as they flew from their roosting places. In
fact this was the first bird sound to be heard in the mornings ; the noise
is like that made by a cork when it is difficult to draw it out of a
bottle, but a hundred times louder.
The Gang-gang is not rare in certain spots and is confined to the
heavily forested and mountainous country in the south-east of Australia.
It is rarely seen in captivity and I only saw about five birds in private

hands. It is very difficult to obtain, as it frequents the tops of the high
forest trees and is strictly protected. Upon the rare occasions when one
does meet with the bird in captivity it has been taken from the nest
and hand-reared.
The flight of the Gang-gang is wonderfully light and buoyant, the
birds seeming to float in the air, there is none of that hard swift flight
which most Parrots possess.
I was told that some months before I arrived there was a flock of
about fifty of these birds around the house feeding upon certain wattle
seeds ( Falcifermis) and the seeds of the great forest eucalyptus,
E. regnans. I often used to watch the birds feeding in the gum trees
in a forested gully. They usually seemed to be in pairs or small parties;
these were no doubt the pair and young ones. When feeding in the trees
the birds are remarkably hard to distinguish ; the plumage, especially
that of the female, harmonizing perfectly with the greyish green foliage
of the tall gum trees ; the cock's body seemed invisible, but the bright
scarlet head and upstanding crest looked like some brilliant blossom
against the sombre foliage.
The Gang-gang seems never to trespass in the fruit gardens or to
partake of any cultivated fruits. It is a bird exclusively of the high
mountain forests and subsists on its products. It does not appear
to be shot or persecuted in any way and seems to have few natural
enemies except the forest fires which destroy the nestlings and also its
food. I heard of a pair for sale in Sydney but was unable to trace them.
I had always imagined Pennant's Parrakeets to be inhabitants of
Australia's sparsely timbered plains, like so many of that country's
psittacian forms, I don't know why I did; but I was surprised to find it,
at least where I stayed, inhabiting the deep vast forests on the moun-
tains of Victoria. How splendid they looked when I first caught sight
of them flying through a cutting in the forest, their brilliant crimson and
pale violet making a vivid contrast against the sombre greenery of the
undergrowth.
As I write these notes, sitting in the heart of a deep forest beneath
a green roof of exquisite fan-vaulting made by the masses of tree ferns,
a pair of these gorgeous birds are feeding on the pungent green seeds
of a highly aromatic forest shrub called Zieria smithii. The birds are

quite unafraid. Why should they be anything else, this is a sanctuary
for Australia's much persecuted Parrot life. The birds slowly climb
about, pulling the branches towards them with their feet, biting off the
bunches of seeds and holding them in their feet until the spray is
finished ; during the time keeping up a kind of conversation with each
other with a soft " whit-whit ".
As I shave in the mornings in the bathroom I watch in the branches
of a rowan tree, which almost reaches into the room through the open
window, family parties of these Parrakeets feeding on the scarlet
berries ; in fact it is the only time shaving becomes a pleasure for it
serves as an excuse to linger long, looking at these beautiful birds. So
long did this operation take that I was always late for meals and it
was a good thing that I was the only male member of the household.
The birds I am watching in the forest are only about three yards
away and I could almost touch them ; they are not alert or watchful
or ready for instant flight as one would expect them to be, but they go
on feeding as though I were not there. The mosquitos and leeches
make sitting still a matter of great fortitude, so it is I and not the birds
that will soon have to take flight.
There are a lot of young ones in the trees around the house and they
are in the undress plumage of mottled green and crimson, and even
though they feed with as much gusto as their parents they are
always keeping up a continual whining to be fed. These young birds
are more or less uniform green on the wings and body, with a patch of
blue on the chin and surrounding the lower mandible ; the forehead,
upper breast, throat, and the part surrounding the blue patch are
crimson. I have seen some very mottled birds, almost red but with
green patches on the wings and breast; I think these must have been
in their second year. Sometimes I have noticed young ones, from the
rear, and I have been struck by the resemblance to a Norfolk Island
Parrakeet, a uniform grass green with a red cap. It is not to be wondered
at that the inhabitants of Norfolk Island where these two Parrakeets
are found, think that they interbreed and that the mottled young
ones are the progeny of these two birds.
Sometimes as I lie in a hammock beneath one of the large trees
I am continually showered with the scarlet skins of the rowan berries

as the birds feed. It is surprising what acid and extremely astringent
fruits Parrots will eat. Rowan berries are especially bitter and astringent
but they are greatly relished by the birds.
Unfortunately these lovely Parrakeets are considered a pest for
the damage they do to the fruit crops, especially apples, and are shot
at every opportunity by the farmers and the fruit growers. In some
districts they are shot and made into pies. At the house where I am
staying the birds even come into the horse's manger and eat the corn,
and one day, says the owner, she'll have to shoot them. So tame and
plentiful are the birds in the timbered districts that they are found
in dozens around the timber-felling camps, and in the winter when food
is short the birds feed from the horses' mangers, getting so tame that
the birds and horses feed together. Of all the Parrakeets which I saw
wild in Australia I think this one the most beautiful. Its habitat seems
to enhance its beauty, for it lives mainly in the shady groves and deep
forests where its brilliant plumage makes a startling contrast to the
sombre greenery.
Another gorgeous bird was the King Parrakeet, which was fairly
plentiful around the house in the forest. They were the first Parrakeets
I saw there, but they were not nearly as numerous or as familiar as
the foregoing bird, which stayed around the house all day. How lovely
they looked against the dark greenery of the forest trees. They were
a great menace to the fruit and devoured all and sundry, but what
amazed me was their predilection for potatoes. It was impossible to
dig these up and leave them while one went for a meal, for the birds
were sure to find them and not being content with one or two would
bite up the whole lot; they are also one of the few birds which will eat
tomatoes, and they do a great deal of damage where these are grown.
They prove a pest in the fruit-growing districts, eating the unripe
apples and pears ; they are also very fond of the sweet or Spanish
chestnut.
These birds, like the last-mentioned species, look very lovely when
flying through the forests, but they do not seem to come down as low
as the Pennants. The light green wing coverts always look particularly
brilliant when the birds are in flight. There were a lot in captivity
in the Colin McKenzie Reserve at Healsville. They were in a large

aviary, but seemed very neglected and some bad bad eye trouble.
There were a few wild ones outside the aviary trying to get inside, either
to reach the food or to be with their mates, as the birds had all been
trapped in the vicinity.
I watched a family party one morning, they were in the tops of the
giant gum trees and I had almost to lie on my back to watch them
through my binoculars. There was the old pair and a pair of young
ones, these latter persistently chased their parents round the whole time
uttering a loud querulous cry. They seemed insatiable, no matter how
much they were fed they cried for more. Each parent seemed to take
charge of one youngster. Often the male would feed his charge, quite
a lengthy process, and he would endeavour to rest awhile, but the
youngster would wag his head crying for more only a few inches from
his parent's beak. The cock stood it for a while in stony silence,
and then let out the most ear-piercing shriek as though telling his
progeny to " shut up After a time he flew off to another tree, but
the youngster followed him only a few inches behind his tail, still
clamouring for food.
The beautiful Blue Bonnets seem almost unknown at the present
time in captivity in Europe. I cannot quite understand this as they
were frequently imported and kept by aviculturists in pre-War days.
I wonder if we have lost the art of feeding them. That they are difficult
birds I know from sad experience ; it seems almost impossible to keep
them these days unless they are hand-reared, but when they are they
prove to be long-lived and most delightful birds as pets. Mr. Wadell, of
Melbourne, had three hand-reared specimens in his aviaries and they
were quite the most delightfully tame birds I have ever seen. As soon
as one appeared the birds literally threw themselves at the wire netting
demanding to be taken notice of, and as soon as one was in the aviary
they were all over one, racing round one's shoulders or running up and
down one's arm with head feathers erect and all the time chortling
their little warbling song and displaying their exquisite turquoise blue
shoulders. They were some of the few birds I have ever seen which
didn't mind one holding them in the hand, in fact they almost reminded
one of puppies in their delight at being played with. It is only when
tame that their chief beauty is shown, i.e. their beautiful waxy blue

wings. The trouble is that no one who has hand-reared these birds
ever wants to part with them. But a friend in South Australia has
promised to hand-rear me some this next summer and I hope to pick
them up when I visit Australia again, which I hope to do at the end of
this year.
On the first day I landed in Australia I saw six fine Blue Bonnets
in a bird shop in Melbourne, and knowing that opportunities seldom
come twice, I secured the lot. I was glad I did at the time, for I saw
no more offered for sale whilst in Australia. The birds were supposed
to be aviary-moulted specimens, but I rather doubt it, though they
were in perfect feather and quite tame. The dealer kept them for a time
until I went to Adelaide, when Mr. Harvey kindly let me have them
at his place, but he warned me that it was almost impossible to keep
wild caught ones alive. Before I left Adelaide one hen was so ill that
I left her ; later on in Sydney two cocks died, after that I used to give
seed which had been soaked in cod-liver oil for 48 hours ; this seemed
to revive the other three and they lived for almost two months in New
Zealand, then they went. The birds seemed in perfect condition---fat,
lively, and in perfectly normal condition--then one morning one finds
them with their head feathers erected and looking rather " puffy "
about the head ; their droppings become a peculiar yellow colour and
look like custard, the bird goes thin very quickly, and in a week it is
all over, the bird by that time being almost a skeleton. I cannot under-
stand it unless it is that the bird needs some kind of food which we do
not know of. Maybe they are like some of the Australian marsupials
which seem to need special kinds of food at certain times of the year
when they (the foods) generate certain chemicals which are necessary
to the animal's welfare. It was a great disappointment as they were
such fine specimens.
The first wild Blue Bonnets I saw were at Lagoon Sheep Station
in the east central districts of South Australia. Here I found them
quite common, being most numerous around the homestead where
they seemed to congregate in small flocks or family parties of from four
to ten. They spent a good deal of their time on the ground, searching
no doubt for small seeds, and when disturbed flew into a nearby tree.
If disturbed again they always flew away in pairs. The cock's tail when

he flew away was noticeably convex. The birds were not at all timid
and allowed an approach to within a few yards of where they were
sitting. Their voices were not loud or harsh and their usual call was like
the distant squeaking of a rusty hinge. There are three species of
Blue Bonnets, though some ornithologists maintain that there are only
two ; they state that the Yellow-vented and Bed-vented are one and
the same, and they state that the red under-tail coverts are only a
matter of age ; they bring out a long series of skins to show how the
birds graduate from the yellow to the red. I think, and other avicul-
turists in Australia also, that there are two species which gradually
merge into one another. The Yellow-vented form is found in South and
South-Eastern Australia and this merges into the Bed-vented form
which is found in Northern New South Wales and South Queensland.
Dr. Lendon had the three forms in his aviaries in Adelaide ; the
Yellow-vents are quite distinct from the Bed-vents, and this is not a
matter of age. The third species, the Naretha, is quite distinct from
the other two, and besides a difference in plumage is much smaller.

It may be amusing to your readers to know of one fairly enthusiastic
aviculturist, who fell into the hobby quite by accident, who now has
about 250 birds, and who now has achieved--he hopes--an avicultural
success also by accident.
The desire and wish for the hobby arose some years ago, after
considerable thought as to the most advantageous manner in which
I might utilize a well-built and quite substantial little house in my
garden, which had been left to the tender mercy of the gardener and
used for no other purpose than that of storing tools ; surely some better
use might be made of this little structure with cemented floor and well
match-boarded throughout, strong enough in the event of another

crisis to stand up even better than the present-day bungalow, and so
at last--why not an aviary ? How thrilling to keep exotic birds,
particularly those with long tails !
On completion of the aviary, I journeyed to a famous London
bird shop and here I must pay tribute to a most sensible and very
excellent salesman, who simply told me " not to be too ambitious
at the start ", and insisted on my commencing with just a dozen
Waxbills and six Finches. That I am grateful for his advice, I frankly
admit, but within forty-eight hours I had lost all my birds ; not that
the sleeping quarters had let me down, but the flight, where I had
foolishly " planted " artificial trees, and consequently my first venture
was a complete fiasco.. The post-mortem disclosed arsenical poisoning,
so out came the manufactured trees. Having learnt my lesson and with
that characteristic which is possibly peculiar to my race, I again
visited the bird shop and needless to say still make further calls to this
and other bird shops, which has resulted, so my friends tell me, in
my having a fair collection, ranging as they do from Argus Pheasants
to Zosterops.
My aviaries might be called large, and as their occupants in every
case are " gentlemen only ", peace reigns supreme with Pheasants
and birds. I decided at this stage not to attempt breeding, as the
aviaries were considered unsuitable, and instead stocked them entirely
with male birds whom nature has so gloriously and richly endowed.
It is an endless pleasure for me to behold such a galaxy of colour, where
are housed together (and I emphasize living quite happily) Touracous,
Golden Orioles, various Tanagers including Scarlets, Troupials, Hang-
nests, Giant Whydahs, Fruit Suckers, Pittas, etc.
Not infrequently I am asked why I do not show my birds, and
whilst I am not anxious to cross swords with my friends in the " fancy ",
I do feel they impose an almost impossible condition at their shows
by insisting that a bird's chief merit lies in complete steadiness, which
in my opinion can only be obtained by continual confinement in cages,
whilst an enthusiast like myself keeps his birds in spacious surroundings,
and I for one find it utterly impossible to comply with such a ruling.
It is interesting to recall how a few years ago, whilst on holiday, I rang
up an eminently successful lady exhibitor, being naturally anxious

to view her collection, although as a showman I was unknown to her,
but with the usual courtesy found with fellow aviculturists I and my
family were subsequently received with the utmost cordiality and
hospitality. Her collection, may I add, just served to increase the fever
that by this time had gripped me strongly.
I now turn to my solitary breeding success (achieved, of course,
by accident) after six years' experience of this delightful hobby. The
spring of 1933 took me on a memorable visit to Cleres, where I acquired
among a few others a glorious Magpie Tanager, and although he had
been housed in their tropical quarters, he has proved himself as hard
as nails. He naturally joined the other bachelors and the tranquillity of
the aviary remained undisturbed until the spring of this year when
I was fortunately able to acquire another of these glorious birds. That
it was a " cock " I was positive, for were they not alike as two peas,
and why should I not have at least two bachelors of a kind. All went
well for several weeks and if close and almost continuous observation
is made of one's birds how easy is it to detect even a disturbing influence
in an aviary--suddenly the old cock Tanager wages war and the Scarlet
Tanager becomes his arch enemy. Fortunately no casualties occurred,
but what could be the explanation of his sudden ferocity, surely the
newly acquired " cock " was not to blame, but closer observation
convinced me they were a pair and that they should be removed to
more suitable quarters with as little delay as possible, for after all
why shouldn't I have a shot at breeding.
In May they were transferred to an aviary, of which the only other
occupants were a pair of docile Argus Pheasants, but here I blundered
badly as this particular aviary was sadly lacking in cover, and con-
sequently they made no attempt at nesting. The season was by this
time over, and we were now in the second week of September, and so
for the purpose of communal feeding they were again transferred to
yet another aviary which happened to be well planted, particularly
the back wall, with a mass of creeper. To my consternation one
evening only one Magpie Tanager was on view, but on close examination
the hen emerged from the trellis-covered wall, where we located a
soundly constructed nest containing two eggs. The problem then
presented itself that, provided the eggs were fertile, how were the

young to be reared, also what possible chance had they of surviving
the rigours of a typical English autumn. I duly approached our good
friends, the Keston Foreign Bird Farm, who offered most helpful,
but by no means optimistic advice, so I just hoped for the best. The
eggs were slightly smaller than those of a Thrush, light greyish colour
with dark markings ; period of incubation fourteen days. One bird
only was hatched, 24th September, which left the nest 8th October,
and is already able to fly a matter of four to five yards. The parent
birds were offered a plentiful supply of fruit, gentles, insects, yolk
of hard-boiled egg, and, of course, mealworms.
I have no knowledge of this specimen having bred in captivity and
Keston also expressed a similar view. Need I add my Magpie Tanagers
will be offered every inducement to carry on their good work again
next year.
16 th November , 1938.
I am very happy to state that the young Magpie Tanager is pro-
gressing quite satisfactorily. At this stage it is now almost impossible
to note any real difference between " him " and his parents, except
that in the case of the youngster the beak is considerably duller than
that of the older bird.
21st November, 1938.
The young Magpie Tanager is still making excellent progress, and
is now completely independent and almost identical with the parent
birds. It was observed that the young bird on leaving the nest on
8th October, did not return, but settled down each night in the cover
provided in the flight, whilst the parents took up their positions quite
near him. At this period the nights were cold and very stormy, and
it seemed desirable that they should now be confined to the sleeping
quarters at night, and after a little persuasion we did manage to get
them inside, where the youngster chose for himself the highest possible
perch, and the parents were apparently content to remain just near him.
One curious point, however, was the fact that although a good
supply of food was provided in the shelter, they simply touched nothing,
not even mealworms, and consequently had to be let out very early

Our members will be very grateful to Miss Chawner for the large
amount of work she has done for the Society during her term of editor-
ship and all will regret that she now finds that she must relinquish
the post. Miss Chawner is one of our most experienced aviculturists
who has successfully kept and bred many birds, notably Owls. During
several years past she has held the important post of Curator to
Mr. Spedan Lewis's fine and ever-growing collection, and under her
charge this has become one of the most important private collections
in Europe. We are very glad to be able to report that Miss Chawner
has consented to serve on the Council, and her knowledge and experience
will still be at the disposal of the Society.
To find a suitable Editor for our Magazine is no easy task, for such
a post involves a knowledge of ornithology with its terms and nomencla-
ture and also of editing scientific matter, for we would wish our
Magazine to be regarded as a scientific as well as a practical journal.
The Council, with the advice of M. Delacour, has asked Miss Phyllis
Barclay-Smith to undertake this task and has every confidence in its
choice.
Miss Barclay-Smith is a Fellow of the Zoological Society of London
and a Member of the British, Czechoslovakian, Dutch, and German
Ornithologists' Unions ; Corresponding Member of the Royal Hungarian
Institute of Ornithology, Honorary Member of the British Falconers'
Club, and Secretary of the International Committee of Bird Preserva-
tion. Further, she is Editor of The Naturalist&apos;s Calendar and a con-
tributor to Nature , Country Life , The Field , Discovery , etc. She is also
one of the Official Observers of birds in the Royal Parks for H.M. Office
of Works, and was Secretary of the section which includes aviculture

enables her to keep in touch with aviculturists and ornithologists
in all parts of the world.
It is hoped that all members will do their best to help the new
Editor by sending her contributions for the Magazine. Every member
who keeps birds, as well as those who make interesting observations
on birds in the wild, should write an account of his or her experiences ;
so please do so.

Two zoologists, who with four others are to spend six months
studying bird life on the lonely Galapagos Islands, off the West Coast
of South America, sailed from Liverpool in the P.S.N.C. liner
Reina del Pacifico. They were David Lambert Lack, the leader
of the expedition, and Mr. Hugh Thompson. They are travelling about
seven thousand miles to Ecuador in the Reina del Pacifico, and will
cross from the mainland of South America to the Galapagos Islands,
which are on the Equator, a voyage of about six hundred miles, in a
small ship.
The expedition is on behalf of the London Zoological Society and
the Royal Society. "We shall make our headquarters on an island
called ' Indefatigable ' and we shall live in tents," said Mr. Lack in
an interview at Liverpool. " There are only a few people on the island,
about a dozen or so of various nationalities. We shall study the habits
of the living birds, and hope to be the first to bring back alive to England

size of a Sparrow, were written about by Charles Darwin in The Voyage
of the Beagle and the Origin of the Species , following a visit he paid to
the islands more than a century ago. The birds present a unique
biological problem, and we want to find out why they have turned
into so many different kinds. Our study may help to increase our
knowledge of evolution. We are taking much equipment with us,
including a quantity of tinned food presented to the expedition. The

Taking a stroll round the small Bird House, looking about for
something of interest to readers, especially distant ones, I bethought
myself of the Tanagers. I found that there are at present few of these
beautiful birds in the collection.
First to catch my eye, darting about the large middle aviary,
were several very fine Superbs, Tanagra fastuosa, usually acknowledged
to be the most lovely of all; a native of the state of Pernambuco,
Brazil, where it must be plentiful indeed, since countless thousands
have been shipped from there and they still appear to come over
fairly often in spite of restrictions placed by Brazil on the export of
birds. In this same aviary is a perfect pair of that charming little
Tanager, Nemosia pileata, which I brought for the first time to this
country in 1933. Pretty little things, blue grey above and white
below, with a black hood in the cock which is absent in the hen ;
both sexes have a bright yellow eye. Also in this aviary is a pair of
the Ornate Tanager, Thmupis ornata, South-East Brazil, and the
well-known Scarlet Tanager, Rhamphocelus brasilius, and its near
relative, the Maroon Tanager, Rhamphocelus carbo.
In one of the large cages there is a very fine pair of the Magpie
Tanager, Cissopsis leveriana, Pernambuco, Brazil, a striking black and
white species with a long tail. For a number of years a grand pair of

the White-capped Tanager, Stephanophorus diadematus, has been a
feature in another of these cages ; alas, one died this year, but I see
its place is already filled by another of this species. This is a difficult
bird to establish when first imported, and they look so dull giving no
idea of the beauty that they afterwards attain, a lovely shining dark
blue, with a white cap on which rests a tuft of red feathers. The Zoo
has had since 1923 a Silent Tanager, Arremon silens, others of this
species have come and gone but he goes on !
And lastly there is a specimen of a large Tanager, very rare and
beautiful, brought over by Mr. C. S. Webb, the Scarlet-bellied, Pcecilo-
thraupis lunulata, found at a height of ten to twelve thousand feet.
So far this species has not proved easy to keep fit in captivity. I believe
Mr. Webb is writing an article which will no doubt tell fully of the
difficulties encountered in collecting these and other birds which he
has recently brought over.

In the Society's very interesting report it is stated that there are
on exhibit no less than fifty of the fifty-nine species of Australian
Parrots, the largest collection of these birds known to exist. The
Society has the good fortune to possess one of the extremely rare
Ground Parrakeets and to be able so far to keep it in good health.
Three pairs of Queen Alexandra's Parrakeets have between them

The Handbook of British Birds. Vol. II (Warblers to Owls). By
H. F. Witherby, Bev. F. C. B. Jourdain, Norman Ticehurst,
Barnard W. Tucker. Price 21s. Published by H. F. and G.
Witherby, Ltd., 326 High Holborn, London.
The second volume of this handsome " handbook " fully maintains
the high standard set by the first, and the information it contains
concerning the life history of British birds from Warblers to Owls
is exhaustive and full of interest to all bird lovers, whether they be
experts or beginners. The plates, as in vol. i, show male, female, and
juvenile plumage in summer and winter, and will be particularly helpful
to observers of such difficult birds to distinguish as the various Warblers.
Accidental visitors are included, and the localities recorded in which
they were seen and usually " procured ".
The book deserves a place on every ornithologist's bookshelf; it
would be invaluable in public libraries, where it could be consulted
by students whose means will not allow them to buy it.

Madam, --F. E. Mathew's lack of success with Shamas was probably due
to interference from the cock bird. Insectivorous species which are given their
liberty when young are hatched, I believe, seldom misbehave in this manner.
Where this is not practicable, and, unless one lives in the country it
seldom is, the difficulty can sometimes be overcome by segregating the
cock in such a position that the pair can still see each other, after the hen has
commenced sitting.
The hen will then often rear the young by herself with only the cock's
moral support!
